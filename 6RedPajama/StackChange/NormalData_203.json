["Q: Backup ubuntu and eliminate windows Laptop is currently configured for dual boot of Ubuntu and Windows7, Windows7 was the original OS, Ubuntu 14.4 was added later. 500G harddrive has multiple partitions. VirtualBox was added under Ubuntu and has multiple VMs.\nI want to eliminate the old Windows7, eliminate the harddrive multiple partitions, run Ubuntu as the single bootable OS & keep the multiple VMs under VirtualBox.\nKeeping the multiple VirtualBox VMs looks doable, if complex and I have plenty of backup disk space. I would rather not re-install Ubuntu as I have been adding to it regularly but will if I have to.\nAny suggestions, guidance would be helpful.\n\nA: First off, make sure you backup everything you've got on the Windows partitions. I would then suggest trying gparted. It might let you remove the existing Windows partitions and expand the Ubuntu partitions without losing any data (depending on how the partitions are laid out).\n\nA: use \nsudo cfdisk\n\nIf you dont know how to use cfdisk this might help\n", "Q: Whitelist for migration of kubuntu configuration files I am looking into migrating from kubuntu 14.04 which has KDE 4 to a newer version which has Plasma and Framworks 5. \nMy previous experience is that it is no good to copy all user configuration files in ~/.kde/ and ~/.local/. In some cases this seems to give unexpected behavior of applications. On the other hand there are many configuration intense applications for which I successfully migrated them in the past. In some cases I would want to avoid to copy them because I know that they cannot be consistently reused (e.g. desktop scheme settings). In other cases I would want to migrate the settings but do not know where they are stored (e.g. system wide shortcuts).\nSince many users will want to copy their configuration to save time, it would be good to share a whitelist for configuration files and application data which can rather safely be copied. Is there any such list to start from?\n\nA: I don't know of a whitelist, but based on my experience in the past with similar types of situations, if you can't find a whitelist, I would copy all of your config files to a different directory, such as old_config. Then, when you start an application and it isn't configured the way you like, copy the file for just that application from old_config to the real config file location and see if it works. This allows you to get the config files you need on a case-by-case basis. I've used this strategy, for example, on a new linux computer with configuration files in my home directory (.emacs, .vimrc, .bashrc, .mozilla, .dropbox, .purple, etc)\n", "Q: How to see what is new when I get a ubuntu touch update? I'm working with my Ubuntu Touch BQ Aquaris phone for a month now but I can't seem to find out what the new features are when I get an update.\nFor instance, today I got an update to 14.10 (R21).

Ubuntu supports EFI perfectly. I'm pretty sure your problem is that the EFI version of Windows 8 was installed, while you installed the BIOS/Legacy version of Ubuntu. \nTry to boot into the legacy part of Windows when it is EFI won't work. You could also try this, in case you don't want to reinstall Ubuntu. Start up Ubuntu and open a terminal window. Then run \nsudo update-grub \n\nThis might work, but I think the first method will work a lot better.\n\nA: If you can set the BIOS back to legacy and boot back into Ubuntu you could attempt to reinstall the bootloader specifying UEFI rather than BIOS. Using something similar to:\ngrub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi\nI've only ever manually installed grub when using Arch but I think it's relatively the same process under Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How to I restore ubuntu-desktop / unity / gnome back to it's original state I tried to install KDE on ubuntu, which involved me doing an sudo apt remove --purge *unity, a full install of kde and other involved packages. The problem is that somewhere in between I really screwed up and it didn't work, so I gave up and tried going back to unity, but now after getting rid of KDE and reinstalling ubuntu-desktop and unity it does not look at all like it was before, windows don't have the exit/minimize/maximize buttons, there is no dash, CTRL+SHIFT+T doesn't work, the top bar is missing all of the system control buttons (shutdown, settings, etc). I do not know how to fix this and I've tried everything, how can I completely reset ubuntu-desktop and unity?\nThe top bar that is always visible:\n\nWindow control bar in nautilus (and every other window):\n\n\nA: Perhaps try this method of reinstalling unity:\nHow do I reinstall Unity?\nI've had similar issues in the past when exploring additional desktop environments and this is the procedure I used to get Unity back up and running.\n", "Q: Force Pidgin to acept an invalid certificate I am getting the following error on Pidgin 2.10.10-3.fc20 (libpurple 2.10.10).\nHow can I force it to accept an invalid certificate? \n(According to this bug report it should be capable).\n\nHere's what I have done:\n\n\n*\n\n*visited the domain on Firefox, and exported the certificate\n\n*imported the certificate on Pidgin tools->certificates\n\n*Imported the certificate on seahorse (gnome keyring GUI)\n\n\nA: It seems to be important that the name you enter when importing the certificate via Tools→Certificates matches the connect server in the XMPP account configuration. This is the only way I was able to get it to work for the same error.\n\n\nA: Another workaround is to import the name of the server specified in the error like myserver.chat.com. For example:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Firefox browser and put the URL: HTTPS://mysever.chat.com, you'll get an error:\n\n\n\n*Select, Advanced option then Add Exception. A popup for the certificate will open.\n\n\n*Then click Advanced -> Details -> Export\n\n\n\n*Save the certificate somewhere\n\n\n*Open Pidgin, go to Tools -> Certificates -> Add\nNow save the certificate with the same common name as the error in the beginning.\nFinally, try to reconnect.\n\nA: Easy Way,\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Pidgin\n\n*Find your certificates folder (Win­dows: %appdata%\\.purple) \n(Linux: /home/<Username>/.purple/certificates/x509/tls_peers)\n\n*Delete everything in the certificate folder.\n\n*Restart pid­gin and eventually you should get a new certificate that works.\n\n\nP.S: Windows users who aren’t familiar with %app­data% just type %appdata%\\.purple in your address bar and press enter.\n\nA: As alternative you can download the ssl certificate by hand. Afterwards pidgin starts without problems.\nTo download the certificate you can use openssl command line utility.\n~/.purple/certificates/x509/tls_peers$ openssl s_client -connect YOUR_SERVER:PORTNUMBER  \n\nWhen the above command fails with \"no peer certificate available\" then maybe the server uses STARTTLS instead of SSL. In this case use the following command:\n~/.purple/certificates/x509/tls_peers$ openssl s_client -connect YOUR_SERVER:PORTNUMBER -starttls xmpp\n\nNow copy the part beginning with \"----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----\".

If the certificate\n  is not cached yet (e.g. after a fresh windows/pidgin installation) the\n  connection fails.\n\nUpgrading to 2.10.11 fixes the issue. If you're using an older Ubuntu version like me, you can use the PPA (12.04, 14.04 and 14.10)\n\nA: You can use Pidgin-developers PPA to resolve it. I installed pidgin packages and libpurple from that source and it solved my problem with accessing Lync 2013 resources. Now it can automatically allow certificates (show dialog to accept or reject unknown certificate). Have you tried that? If you used 15.04 there is also a workaround to download a few packages and replace old ones with new. I tested it on 15.04 already, it works.\n\nA: I was able to get around the certificate issue by manually replacing it with a saved copy a couple of times.  Stopped working after that, and upgrading to 2.11 didn't seem to help.\nIf you build from source, one thing to try is to modify the source code for libpurple/certificates.c ; moving the PURPLE_CERTIFICATE_FATALS_MASK check under the PURPLE_CERTIFICATE_NON_FATALS_MASK check to prompt the user but allow the certificate if accepted.  Probably not the safest thing to do, but worked for me. \n\nA: Force pidgin to download new certificates.\nrm ~/.purple/certificates/x509/tls_peers/*\n\nClose and re-open pidgin.\nls ~/.purple/certificates/x509/tls_peers/*\n\nNow this should list newly downloaded certificates.\n", "Q: Resume from suspend not working on Macbook Pro 5,5 with Nouveau Resume from suspend used to work perfectly on my Macbook Pro 5,5.

I have to perform two hard-reboots to restore the system.\nI checked my disk and memory to make sure it wasn't a hardware fault, but they both check out, leaving me to suspect it's something wrong with the driver. Unfortunately, since I have to reboot, all the logs are being cleared, so I have no idea how to find an error message or how to debug this.\nHow do I figure out what's wrong?\n\nA: The issue may just be trying to use the non-Nvidia drivers.

It would probably look something like\nsudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nor (recommended)\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\n\nBut it may differ because the support page for your laptop lists wireless drivers for Broadcom, Atheros, and Intel.\n", "Q: stuck in a login loop after updating drivers Alright so I updated my amd drivers to the latest catalyst version, after almost two hours of trouble updating the drivers I somehow managed to complete the catalyst installing.\nI rebooted my machine, and something has changed, I no longer had a GUI and a command line shell has appeared, now I entered the following command:\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nrebooted, this seemed to solve the problem yet of course a new one has started, I am now stuck in a login loop, whenever I login, it starts loading the desktop page and then immediately sends me back to the login screen, this goes on and on and on unless I enter a false password, in that case it just says:\nIncorrect password\n\nI already tried playing with the Xauthority and reinstalling the xorg Ubuntu desktop, yet no luck.\n\nA: I installed a AMD - fglrx driver package once and ended up in the same state. Here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the login screen Ctrl+Alt+F2 to get into a tty\n\n*enter username and password\n\n*did sudo apt-get remove fglrx-core\n\n*Press ctrl+Alt+F7 to get back to login screen, reboot, it should be fixed.\n\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu to try to resolve a problem I have a Lenovo L430. Mousepad and trackpoint don't work in W7. I was advised to try Ubuntu to see if the problem is in software or hardware. I have no experience with Ubuntu. \nCan I do a \"dry run\" or partial installation to see how does Ubuntu work without actually installing it? If yes, how? \nWill I be able to restore W7 after I try Ubuntu? How? \nAm I in danger of losing user files? \nAll advice is appreciated.\nThanks.\n\nA: You can actually try ubuntu without actually installing it, but you need a USB flash drive withat least 1GB of space to have it on. Here is a good tutorial on how to set it up.\nAfter you have a LiveUSB created you just reboot the computer with the flash drive still connected. you might have to go into BIOS and give boot priority to the flash drive. Then your computer will boot into ubuntu, which you can then use to play around with.\n", "Q: During repo sync progress, regularly to appear the message: \"invalid clone.bundle file; ignoring\" I'm trying to port a new device for ubuntu-touch. During the progress, after a \"repo sync\" in terminal, it often appears the message: \"Invalid clone.bundle file; ignoring\".\nI don't know what it is, and is the progress getting a potential failure, could you clarify?\n\nA: That message is not an error. The clone.bundle for that repository doesn't exist, so repo chose to ignore it.\nI ran repo with --trace (verbose mode) and found an example clone.bundle file hosted on Ubuntu's website. If you go to that link, you'll notice that it just redirects to a status page. It's not acually a clone.bundle file! \nNow, to make sure that I'm not getting anything wrong, let's compare this webpage to another clone.bundle file located on googlesource. Notice how it is an actual file and downloads.\n", "Q: Like Mac. Close Tap (lid) and active hybrid-suspend 14.04 I would like to configure my OS, to Close the lid of the laptop, block the access and later of 10 or 20 minute active hybrid-suspend.\nsomeone can help?..\nI know to close the lid and active the hybrid-suspend, but I would like to add timer.\nThe hibernate is working correctly\nUbuntu mate 64bit 14.04\n\nA: You may be able to do this by configuring logind.conf - this will also override any of your user's power settings, and will work whether you are logged in or not (system-wide). You can configure it via running:\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/logind.conf\n\nYou should like something like this:\n\nChange the below lines to this:\nHandleLidSwitch=lock\nIdleAction=hybrid-sleep\nIdleActionSec=1200\n\nwith no # at the beginning of any of the lines- a # at the beginning of the line means it is a comment and will be ignored and the defaults will be used\nThis should mean that when the lid is closed the computer locks; and when it is left idle (for 20 minutes (20x60=1200 seconds) it will enter a hybrid-sleep state - the idle action will also take place with the lid open, and the configuration file may accept the time in minutes: IdleActionSec=30min.\nNote that after making the changes you may need to restart logind or the system to see if the changes work.\nHere is a quote from the manual page - note other values like lock, poweroff etc can be used.\n\nHandlePowerKey=, HandleSuspendKey=, HandleHibernateKey=, HandleLidSwitch=\nControls whether logind shall handle the system power and sleep keys and the lid switch to trigger actions such as system power-off or\n  suspend. Can be one of \"ignore\", \"poweroff\", \"reboot\", \"halt\",\n  \"kexec\", \"suspend\", \"hibernate\", \"hybrid-sleep\" and \"lock\". If\n  \"ignore\", logind will never handle these keys. If \"lock\", all running\n  sessions will be screen-locked; otherwise, the specified action will\n  be taken in the respective event. Only input devices with the\n  \"power-switch\" udev tag will be watched for key/lid switch events.\n  HandlePowerKey= defaults to \"poweroff\". HandleSuspendKey= and\n  HandleLidSwitch= defaults to \"suspend\". HandleHibernateKey= defaults to\n  \"hibernate\".\nIdleAction=\nConfigures the action to take when the system is idle. Takes one of \"ignore\", \"poweroff\", \"reboot\", \"halt\", \"kexec\", \"suspend\",\n  \"hibernate\", \"hybrid-sleep\", and \"lock\". Defaults to \"ignore\".\nNote that this requires that user sessions correctly report the idle status to the system. The system will execute the action after\n  all sessions report that they are idle, no idle inhibitor lock is\n  active, and subsequently, the time configured with IdleActionSec= (see\n  below) has expired.\nIdleActionSec=\nConfigures the delay after which the action configured in IdleAction= (see above) is taken after the system is idle.\n\n", "Q: Install additional drivers to USB from mac? I have a problem,\nI have no Ethernet cable and I want to bypass the need of using it to install the WLAN and Wi-Fi Ubuntu driver.

In fact, looking up an application in Dash is based on the presence of its name. A \"nameless\" application would therefore clash with the concept of Dash.\nI can imagine it would be(-come) a setting option in \"Appearance\" as far as it concerns the Launcher.\n", "Q: Where are SMS and MMS stored?

I would like to have a personal website for me and a few friends to host a few files. I created the website and all is running smoothly. To test file hosting, I created a \"test.txt\" file in the /var/www/html directory and created a link on the page to the file. In the file, I had this string:\nThis is a test file.\n\nWhen I click the link in my browser on my computer, however, instead of the file downloading, the string \"This is a test file.\" appears in my browser. Tested on multiple browsers. Any suggestions? I am very new to website hosting... is there something I forgot? Thanks in advance.\n-Ryan\n\nA: You can force it to be downloaded by making Apache report it's content type to be application/octet-stream, instead of the usual text/html. This is not something I would recommend doing to .txt files. In your .htaccess  (or other Apache configuration files) add:\nAddType application/octect-stream .txt\n\nAnother approach is to use ForceType within a Files or a Directory block, as outlined in this SO answer:\n\n<Files *.mp4>\n  ForceType application/octet-stream\n  Header set Content-Disposition attachment\n</Files>\n\n\nThe advantage is that the matching criterion for a Files block is more flexible than that of a plain AddType.\n\nA: A text file can be read by apache and will be read and displayed by it, you can still save the file with the browser, though.\nTry again, with another ending like text.zip. Doesn't even need to be a real zip, changing the ending will change the behaviour.\nOn a personal note: Make sure to secure your server with .htaccess and a user/password combination if these files are not for the public!\n\nA: if you need to push file that is simple text down to client in the browser you'll have to use something like php and create some for ex. index.php file in root: /var/www/html directory and add something like this:\n<?php\n$file = 'test.txt';\n\nif (file_exists($file)) {\n    header('Content-Description: File Transfer');\n    header('Content-Type: application/octet-stream');\n    header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename='.basename($file));\n    header('Expires: 0');\n    header('Cache-Control: must-revalidate');\n    header('Pragma: public');\n    header('Content-Length: ' . filesize($file));\n    readfile($file);\n    exit;\n}\n?>\n\nI'm afraind that you'll have to install php on your apache first to be able to use the code for that..\nI google-ed it and it's something like this -> sudo apt-get install php5\nGood luck, and let me know if it worked..\nk\n", "Q: u410 SSD BIOS Problems I am all out of idea, can someone help a newb?\nI have successfully installed Ubuntu 14.04 on a Lenovo u410 with UEFI on, secure boot on and with optimus enabled but with several issues at hand. \n\n\n*\n\n*I have deleted all existence of Windows in the HDD and now when I try to access the BIOS via the Novo button, the BIOS takes a long, long time to load..about 10mins.

your firmware setup utility, try downloading the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. Prepare a medium and boot from it. With any luck, there'll be a menu option on the second row of icons to reboot into the firmware setup utility. (The icon is of a computer chip.) Try that option. If it takes less time, then you might consider installing rEFInd on your disk and using it instead of or in addition to GRUB. I vaguely recall that a similar feature is available in GRUB, but I don't know offhand how to activate it.\nConcerning your SSD, I don't see any evidence of it in your hardware list. My suspicion is that your kernel lacks a driver that's required to access it. What's your kernel version? (You can get it by typing uname -r.) If it's something in the 3.13 series, you can update it to a 3.16-series kernel as described here. It's conceivable, but not certain, that a kernel update will enable the hardware.\nAs to booting to busy-box, are you sure that's what's happening? If X can't start, or if you mistakenly installed the server version of Ubuntu, the OS will boot to text mode, with a login: prompt and the ability to use the OS in text mode but without X. If you installed the server version, I recommend trying again with the desktop version. If you installed the desktop version and are booting to text mode, then you should post your /var/log/Xorg.0.log file to a pastebin site and then post a link to your document here. If you're really booting to a busybox shell, then something more serious is wrong, and you need to post more information, such as any error messages you see on the screen. Posting a digital photo of the screen may be in order, particularly if the messages are complex.\n", "Q: How to remove after login screen (annoyingly slow)? I've just installed Ubuntu Server LTS. After login, the screen slooooowwwwwlllllyyyy mutates into a splash screen with a gear and other icons and then sloooowwwwwllllyyyy presents the desktop.\nHow can I disable/remove this? Seems a lot of wasted time to get to the desktop.\nThanks, Caesar.\n\nA: The KDE desktop uses quite a lot of effects (transparency, glowing things, blur etc). You should be able to speed up login by disabling the Login splash screen, as well as extra effect under 'Desktop Effects' > 'All Effects', extra services under 'Startup and Shutdown' > 'Seervice Manager', and by reducing resource usage under 'Application Apperance' > 'Style' > 'Fine tuning'.\nThis page in the Ubuntu wiki may help, which suggests installing the latest updates and disabling the effects.\nAs @bodhiz.zazen suggests, using a interface such as webmin may be better for the running of a server. Another lighter environment (without unnecessary effects) such as Xfce or LXDE may also work faster.\n\nA: Here is how to disable it:\n1. Menu -> Settings -> System Settings -> Workspace Appearance -> Splash Screen\n2. Choose \"None\" for Manager for Splash Screen Themes \nThe next time you login, the annoying post login screen is gone.\nEnjoy!\n", "Q: please help installing missing pkgs I tried to install exploration software for multirobot but i got many errors regarding dependency problems\ni tried several times to install them but I couldnot\ncould anyone help me please \nthanks\nnao@nao-Lab:~/Downloads$ sudo dpkg -i mrxt_1.1-1_i386.deb\n[sudo] password for nao: \n(Reading database ... 263936 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack mrxt_1.1-1_i386.deb ...\nUnpacking mrxt (1.1-1) over (1.1-1) ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of mrxt:\n mrxt depends on libopencv-highgui2.3.\n mrxt depends on libqtcore4 (>= 4:4.7.0~beta1); however:\n  Package libqtcore4:i386 is not installed.\n mrxt depends on libqtgui4 (>= 4:4.6.2); however:\n  Package libqtgui4:i386 is not installed.\n\ndpkg: error processing package mrxt (--install):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n mrxt\n\n\nA: Well, seems like mrxt needs some packages, too.

I recently received an error telling me that there was a problem on line 52. I am trying to learn what the best method is for finding lines instead of actually counting them.\nIn Windows, I often used Notepad++ which displayed the lines directly to the left, so users could easily scroll to the specific line they were looking for -- However I do not see this option in Linux.\nMaybe a certain application is needed?\n\nUPDATE: I currently can not open software-store and the only text editor I have is the default nano and gedit. So please restrict your answers to solutions that don't involve me installing software.\n**NOTE: ** I am not looking to find a 'String' of some sort. I am looking to quickly find the line NUMBER that the string appears on.\n\nA: Let's create a test file;\n$ seq 100 >file\n\nNow, let's display line 52:\n$ sed -n 52p file\n52\n\nOr:\n$ awk 'NR==52' file\n52\n\nOr, if you have the file open in vim, you can type 52G to jump to line 52.\nUsing nano\nSuppose that your file is called file.txt.  To edit the file in nano with line, column, and character count displayed, run\nnano -c file.txt\n\nThis is what nano looks like with the cursor on line 7 of a 21-line file:\n\n\nA: If you're looking for a GUI approach, you can display line numbers in the default text editor, gedit. To do this, go to Edit -> Preferences and tick the box that says \"Display line numbers.\"\nYou can also jump to a specific line number by using Ctrl+I.\n\nA: You can display the file with less. Use less -N to display line numbers, type \"52\" to less to get to line 52. See man less.  \nOr, you could open the file with the vim editor (type vim thefile), then typing \":52\" will get you to line 52.

Kudos :)\n\nA: Use efibootmanager to change to boot order\nToo keep things simple, you should try to Change boot order using efibootmgr. Just run sudo efibootmgr -v and look for the line that says Windows Boot Manager. Please add the output of the command  in your question to be safe.\nHere is the key quote from Rod's answer:\n\nsudo efibootmgr -o 0,1,2\nThis command will set the two ubuntu instances first, followed by the\n  Windows Boot Manager entry.\n\nIn this example with this explanation you would want to run sudo efibootmgr -o 2,0 to set Windows as the default.\nThe background is, that this depends on a properly working UEFI setup with a standard compliant firmware. Since you write that you run Windows 8.1 without a particular model number of the computer you are using or any modifications that you made and you haven't experienced any issues I have to assume that this is the case.\nNote that Windows doesn't detect other operating systems by default and I don't recommend changing the BCD configuration by hand or with 3rd party utilities. This is exactly what you asked for and you would need explicitly choose Ubuntu during the boot process, which can be very annoying too.\nMy recommendation\nI recommend looking at the answer from keepitsimpleengineer which has been suggested in the comments. It works independently from UEFI or BIOS and is the most convenient solution I can think of. From my point of view it's standard functionality within GRUB and doesn't require any 3rd party utilities.\n", "Q: How do I restart a wget download? I use the wget application.

Either the server is overloaded or there was an error in a CGI script.\n\nIf you think this is a server error, please contact the webmaster.\n\nError 500\n\nlocalhost\nApache/2.4.9 (Unix) OpenSSL/1.0.1g PHP/5.5.11 mod_perl/2.0.8-dev Perl/v5.16.3\n\nI have given all permission to the folder how can i fix this ?\n\nA: The http status code 500 itself probably won't tell you what went wrong.\nMost http status codes are relatively \"talkative\", they tell you what's wrong in some detail. Take for example \"404 Not Found\". With this code, the server tells the client (for example, a web browser), \"what you asked me to send you is not at that address\". Or \"403 Forbidden\" (\"You are not allowed to access that address\"). Or, to take an example out of the range of problems on the server, \"507 Insufficient Storage\" (\"The server does not have enough storage capacity left to do what you asked for\").\nIn contrast to that, \"500 Internal Server Error\" is (somewhat deliberately) relatively vague. It just tells the client, \"Something went wrong at the server's side of things\", nothing more. It's like a \"catchall\" for everything that goes wrong while processing the client's request. It's used if the server (or the server's administrator) doesn't know what more to tell the client - or it doesn't want to tell the client anything more, because the details are none of the client's business ;)\nSo, \"500 Internal Server Error\" can be caused by a multitude of different things going wrong. To get further information you can consult the error logs of your server. In a typical setup, the server keeps two kinds of log files. In the access log, it notes down every request from a client it gets (\"At time such and such a client from that IP address asked for that URL\"). You mostly use the access log for statistic evaluations.\nThe other kind of log is the error log. Here, the client notes down everything that goes wrong. So you should take a look in your server's error log and search for the time the error occured. That should give you a log message that tells you more about what went wrong. \nWhere the server stores its logs depends on the server's configuration. The directives you should be looking for in the server's config files are AccessLog and ErrorLog.\n", "Q: Office 2010 on 14.04 under wine? How do I run Office 2010 on Ubuntu 14.04 under wine?

Would installing Trusty directly on my SSD potentially help with these problems?\n\nA: Update, ~10 days later: I reinstalled Trusty directly on my Chromebook's internal SSD under Crouton, and have had no problems since. I believe the issues above were related to an issue with Crouton resuming after the computer has gone to sleep (see issue #288). It also may have been caused by accidentally removing the SD card without properly ejecting it.\n", "Q: How to switch/disable functionality of fn keys on Ubuntu - USB keyboard Hi I have a problem with my new USB Lenovo keyboard, I can't (don't know how) switch Fn keys in Linux, on windows it was very easy.\nBut I don't know what I can do on Linux to switch Fn keys (or disable), do you know any solution?

I have a .7z file containing ~360,000 images in multiple directories. I'd like to convert it to a .tar so that I can open it in another computer. Is there a better way than extracting it to files and compressing them again? Is it possible to do the conversion directly?\n\nA: It's not too hard to write something to do the job. Here's an example Perl script (requires the module Archive::Libarchive::XS).\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\nuse Archive::Libarchive::XS qw(:all);\n\ndie \"Usage: $0 in.7z out.tar\" unless @ARGV == 2;\nmy ($infile, $outfile) = @ARGV;\n\nmy $in = archive_read_new();\narchive_read_support_filter_none($in);\narchive_read_support_format_7zip($in);\n\narchive_read_open_filename($in, $infile, 10240) == ARCHIVE_OK\n  or die \"Error opening $infile: \", archive_error_string($in);\n\nmy $out = archive_write_new();\narchive_write_set_format_ustar($out);\narchive_write_open_filename($out, $outfile) == ARCHIVE_OK\n  or die \"Error opening $outfile: \", archive_error_string($out);\n\nwhile (archive_read_next_header($in, my $entry) == ARCHIVE_OK) {\n  archive_write_header($out, $entry) == ARCHIVE_OK\n    or die archive_error_string($out);\n  while (1) {\n    my $size = archive_read_data($in, my $buff, 65536);\n    die archive_error_string($in) if $size < 0; \n    last if $size == 0;\n    archive_write_data($out, $buff) >= 0\n      or die archive_error_string($out);\n  }\n} \n\narchive_read_free($in);\narchive_write_close($out);\narchive_write_free($out);\n\nIf you wanted a tar.gz / tar.bz2 / tar.xz archive, add the line archive_write_add_filter_gzip($out); or archive_write_add_filter_bzip2($out); or archive_tar_add_filter_xz($out); after the archive_write_set_format line.\nThis uses no temporary disk space (just the space for the output tar file) and very little RAM (just a few MB for perl, but it works with the files a block at a time, so it's not a problem if your files are bigger than your RAM).\n\nA: .7z archives are archives often compressed with some kind of algorithm, while .tar archives are just archives.\nThey differ in their scope, and in most cases a conversion would require an optional decompression always followed by an extraction of the source archive. Even if a .7z archive wouldn't use any compression it would still require an extraction.\nThat being said, If you meant to [decompress] / extract / rearchive the source archive at once, the answer is you can't, at least not using Ubuntu's default tools because tar can't read from stdin, so you can't pipe 7z and tar. Anyway it's very easy to automate everything in a single command:\nmkdir tmp && 7z x <path_to_source_archive> -otmp && tar cf archive.tar tmp && rm -rf tmp\n\n* <path_to_archive> = path to the source .7z archive\nAlso the time required for the source archive's files to be written to the disk and for the extracted files to be read in order to [decompress] / extract / rearchive the source archive in two steps is a bottleneck for the whole task mostly (altough not only) because of a potential disk's low I/O speed, so a partial solution would be to store the temporary files to a ramdisk in order to almost void the overall bottleneck: \n\n\n*\n\n*Create the mount point for the ramdisk's filesystem: sudo mkdir /mnt/tmpfs\n\n*Mount the ramdisk's filesystem: sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=<tmpfs_size> tmpfs /mnt/ramdisk* <tmpfs_size> = size of the filesystem in bytes * 103 (1, 1K, 1M, 1G, ...)\n\n*Run mkdir /mnt/tmpfs/tmp && 7z x <path_to_source_archive> -o/mnt/tmpfs/tmp && tar cf archive.tar /mnt/tmpfs/tmp && rm -rf /mnt/tmpfs/tmp* <path_to_archive> = path to the source .7z archive\n\n*Unmount the ramdisk's filesystem: sudo umount\n\n*Remove the mount point for the ramdisk's filesystem: sudo rmdir /mnt/tmpfs\n", "Q: How to get back the Ubuntu 14.10 default login screen When i lock my PC after successful login it's show the default Ubuntu lock screen but when i reboot my PC it shows the login screen of the theme K Ubuntu that i removed\n\nA: you can easily do it by following steps\n\n\n*\n\n*type the following code in the terminal to reconfigure lightdm\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nthen a dialog box appears to asking to choose the default login manager\nlightdm or kdm i guess, after that restart the lightdm by typing\nsudo lightdm restart\n\nor you can do it by the following way\n\n\n*\n\n*edit the /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d file by\npressing ctrl+alt+t and typing\nsudo nano /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d\n\nand add the following line\n    [SeatDefaults]\n\n    greeter-session=unity-greeter\n\nsave the file pressing ctrl+x and type y and restart lightdm\n", "Q: What functionality does the Ubuntu Restricted Extras provide?

You will not be able to watch movies(DVDS), use any site the need a Flash player, listen to MP3's.

Some purchased MP3 will not play without them)\nIF you use Google's Chrome (not chromium) it will include flash in the browser but no other browsers will.\nShort answer here is: you do need to install them, but if you want all the functionality that you have become accustomed to in Windows you will want to install them.\n", "Q: Text becomes unreadable after high memory usage I currently use an old laptop running ubuntu 14.04.2. I am using the default unity desktop. It has an integrated intel graphics card.\nAfter using the laptop for a while, the text becomes unreadable. this usually happens after my RAM usage becomes really high. The text remains unreadable even after the my memory usage lowers. The text only becomes normal after I reboot or log out and log back in but this is time consuming.\nI know that this is probably because my laptop is old and not very powerful and I don't really think there is permanent fix for this issue but I would like to know if there is a command that I can run that will make my text readable again without having to reboot my laptop.\nI have considered switching over to another desktop environment like Xfce but I really like unity and I haven't had any problems other than this with unity.\nIt is hard to explain exactly how the text looks but it becomes really glitchy and becomes nearly impossible to read. In some applications like nautilus, the text becomes clear if I hover the mouse over it but it becomes unreadable again if the mouse is moved.\nI have tried running some commands to fix this issue but none of them have worked. I ran unity --replacebut it didnt ake any difference to the text. I really hope that someone from this community can help me fix this problem.\n\n\nA: An old Laptop with integrated Intel graphics has to split conventional memory into OS usage and video ram. There is the possibility that Unity is buggy in low video ram conditions and that the high OS ram usage is a byproduct of the same origin: Too many applications at once.\nTry to increase video ram in the BIOS settings. If this does not help, you can still switch to xfce, should not hurt too much.\n\nA: Reseat the memory (ie take it out and put it in again while wearing an anti-static strap). This is common where the memory connectors begin to tarnish with age. While you are at it, it's worth reseating anything pluggable, eg power connectors, at the same time. \n", "Q: Can I add un-suspend when lid is open I am running Ubuntu 14.04 and 12.04 dual-boot.

The feature that some laptops have where they wake up as soon as the lid is open is a BIOS controlled feature.

Updated 2015-04-19, 15:56 - I am using a Lenovo x240 notebook and the problem is valid for Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10 at least.\nGeneral description of the problem\nIf I close the notebook's lid, the system will be put into suspend mode (usually suspend to ram). However I notice an unintended resume from this suspend mode very often.\nIt happens while carrying the notebook in a bag as well as without any movement when the notebook stands on my desk for hours.\nI am wondering that there is no question like this already.\nDo you have any idea how to tell Ubuntu that if and only if the lid opens it should resume from suspend mode?\nInvestigation that has be done so far\nI started to investigate this issue. This is what happened when the described problem appears:\n\n\n*\n\n*2015-04-18 - 18:21 - Lid closed and laptop put into a sideboard. The\nLED shows that suspend was successful.

Can you help me?\n\nA: If Windows 8 is pre-installed it is booting in UEFI mode and requires gpt partitioning. \nBut the error you are getting is because you are installing BIOS boot mode on a gpt partitioned drive. If you really want BIOS boot for Ubuntu then you need a tiny 1 or 2MB unformatted partition with the bios_grub flag in gparted. If you use gdisk to create partition it is code ef02. It actually is a very long GUID that is assigned with these short flags or codes.\nBut you probably do not want Ubuntu in BIOS boot and Windows in UEFI boot. You may have to go into UEFI boot menu and turn on/off UEFI or CSM/BIOS each time you reboot into the other system. Much better to install Ubuntu in UEFI boot mode.\nHow you boot install media is how it installs. Your UEFI boot menu for the Ubuntu installer with have two entries.

I am attempting to create a video file from a set of JPG images. I have adapted the instructions given in this question but have experienced some issues. \nFirstly, not all of the required packages are available, but are replaced by libav-tools, which is already installed - so I think that's not an actual problem? \nMy files are named image-NN.jpg (NN being an integer) and I have used the command\navconv -i \"image-%d.jpg\" -r 25 -c:v libx264 -crf 20  -pix_fmt yuv420p movie.mov\n\nas per the linked question, but this just gives a No such file image-%d.jpg error. I \nI tried changing it to \navconv -i \"image-*.jpg\" -r 25 -c:v libx264 -crf 20  -pix_fmt yuv420p movie.mov\n\nand this produces a video file of length 0:00 that appears to only contain one frame. (I am guessing that the * has used the first match, rather than every match). \nThis question gives a slightly different way of formatting the file name, so I tried \navconv -i \"image-%02d.jpg\" -r 25 -c:v libx264 -crf 20  -pix_fmt yuv420p movie.mov\n\nThis produces a larger file, and makes a video that lasts for about 3 seconds (approx the length I was expecting) but it contains just the first frame. \nAnother answer on the first linked question suggests using ImageMagick, so I gave this a try\nconvert -delay 1 image-*.jpg output.mp4\n\nBut this produced an error \nconvert.im6: delegate failed `\"ffmpeg\" -v -1 -mbd rd -trellis 2 -cmp 2 -subcmp 2 -g 300 -i \"%M%%d.jpg\" \"%u.%m\" 2> \"%Z\"' @ error/delegate.c/InvokeDelegate/1065.\n\nThe version of avconv is\ncarl@number1 ~/Scott's stop-motion/1 $ avconv -version\navconv version 9.18-6:9.18-0ubuntu0.14.04.1, Copyright (c) 2000-2014 the Libav developers\nbuilt on Mar 16 2015 13:19:10 with gcc 4.8 (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1)\navconv 9.18-6:9.18-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nlibavutil     52.  3. 0 / 52.  3. 0\nlibavcodec    54. 35. 0 / 54. 35. 0\nlibavformat   54. 20. 4 / 54. 20. 4\nlibavdevice   53.  2. 0 / 53.  2. 0\nlibavfilter    3.  3. 0 /  3.  3. 0\nlibavresample  1.  0. 1 /  1.  0. 1\nlibswscale     2.  1. 1 /  2.  1. 1\n\nWhere am I going wrong, and what do I need to do?   \nAdditional:\nIt was suggested that I list every file individually, so with a bit of Python I generated this\navconv -i image-01.jpg image-02.jpg image-03.jpg image-04.jpg image-05.jpg image-06.jpg image-07.jpg image-08.jpg image-09.jpg image-10.jpg image-11.jpg image-12.jpg image-13.jpg image-14.jpg image-15.jpg image-16.jpg image-17.jpg image-18.jpg image-19.jpg image-20.jpg image-21.jpg image-22.jpg image-23.jpg image-24.jpg image-25.jpg image-26.jpg image-27.jpg image-28.jpg image-29.jpg image-30.jpg image-31.jpg image-32.jpg image-33.jpg image-34.jpg image-35.jpg image-36.jpg image-37.jpg image-38.jpg image-39.jpg image-40.jpg image-41.jpg image-42.jpg image-43.jpg image-44.jpg image-45.jpg image-46.jpg image-47.jpg image-48.jpg image-49.jpg image-50.jpg image-51.jpg image-52.jpg image-53.jpg image-54.jpg image-55.jpg image-56.jpg image-57.jpg image-58.jpg image-59.jpg image-60.jpg image-61.jpg image-62.jpg image-63.jpg image-64.jpg image-65.jpg image-66.jpg image-67.jpg image-68.jpg image-69.jpg image-70.jpg image-71.jpg image-72.jpg image-73.jpg image-74.jpg image-75.jpg image-76.jpg image-77.jpg image-78.jpg image-79.jpg image-80.jpg image-81.jpg image-82.jpg image-83.jpg image-84.jpg image-85.jpg image-86.jpg image-87.jpg image-88.jpg  -r 25 -c:v libx264 -crf 20  -pix_fmt yuv420p movie.mov\n\nThis had the same effect as previous - only the first frame is used.\nAdditional: This question has been suggested as a possible duplicate, but it relates to acquiring images using a webcam connected to a PC. This is not the issue I am having. I already have the photos; they were taken with an ordinary digital camera. \n\nA: You can use ffmpeg, which you can install with the command:\nsudo apt install ffmpeg\n\nThis is the command all together:\nffmpeg -framerate 25 -i image-%05d.jpg -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -crf 20 -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n\nLet me break it down:\n-framerate\n\nis the number of frames (images) per second,\n-i image-%05d.jpg\n\nthis determines the file name sequence it looks for. image- means all of the files start with this. The d indicates decimal integers, 5 is number of digits, the leading zero indicates that numbers requiring fewer digits will be filled, in the left, with zeroes so that every number contains exactly 5 digits. Thus the files it will detect are everything from image-00000 to image-99999.\n-c:v libx264 -profile:v high -crf 20 -pix_fmt yuv420p\n\n-c:v libx264 - the video codec is libx264 (H.264).\n-profile:v high - use H.264 High Profile (advanced features, better quality).\n-crf 20 - constant quality mode, very high quality (lower numbers are higher quality, 18 is the smallest you would want to use).\n-pix_fmt yuv420p - use YUV pixel format and 4:2:0 Chroma subsampling\noutput.mp4\n\nThe file name (output.mp4)\nRemember that ffmpeg needs a continuous sequence of images to load in. If it jumps from image-00001 to image-00003 it will stop.\nIf your images are named like this:\nimage-1\nimage-2\n...\nimage-35\n\nthen change the -i part to -i image-%00d.\n\nUpdate. Your edit says the pattern is image-01.jpg to image-02.jpg. That means you need the image-%02d.jpg pattern.\n\nA: If you don't want to waste your time with the file naming and order I would recommend to take a look into:\n-pattern_type glob\n\nCredits for this goes this very comprehensive answer to How to create a video from images with FFmpeg?\nIt will also provide several examples.\n", "Q: Webapp notifications (Ubuntu Phone) I just published my first Webapp (Flowdock) with the Webbapp generator.\nNow my question is how to enable notifications sent by this app. Flowdock supports desktop notifications.

So it's the same as Alt-Tab but without the popup. \n\nA: Alt+Tab switches between different programs on the same workspace (if activated) with a popup.\nAlt+Esc switches between different programs without a popup.\nAlt+` (key below Esc) switches between different instances of a program.\nSuper+Tab switches between all programs regardless of the workspace (if activated) with a popup.\n\nA: ALT + Esc looks like it's a custom keyboard shortcut that either you, some program or someone else put into place.

I created a couple of VM's successfully and can log into them by associating an IP. \nNow here comes the issues, after I created a few vm's, every time I try now I get a waiting on network error. I have found fixes that state to add a timeout value to the nova.conf. Then when I search through all the LXC contains and find the nova.conf file, it say it is managed by juju and changes will be overwritten.\nThe real question I have is how do you troubleshoot an install like this? Its hard to know where everything is when it installs so many lxc containers and most I can't get into as there all ssh-key access. Is there any easier way to find things? I feel like I am making this harder than it should be. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I'd suggest looking over this question.  It will direct you how to access the inner juju environment where you can start looking over things.\nAfter you follow the above, you can explore your juju environment at a high level with juju status.  I wouldn't suggest attempting to poke through machines and lxcs by hand without that high level tool.  It would be very confusing indeed.  Like navigating around a city without a map.\nFor instance, if you want to go to the nova-compute node, you type juju ssh nova-compute/0.  Nice and easy, see juju help ssh for more details on ways to access the systems.\nAlso, many configuration options are tweakable through charm parameters:\njuju get nova-compute\njuju get nova-cloud-controller\njuju set nova-cloud-controller \"key=value\"\njuju ssh keystone/0\n\nYou get the idea.\nNote also that Juju is not like Puppet.  There is no periodic wipe of your settings files.  It will only do that as a result of external actions.  Like:\n\n\n*\n\n*You running juju set\n\n*You rebooting the system (at reboot, it will probably reset values)\n\n*You relating another service to play with things/try things out.\n\n\nI'd suggest reading more here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Juju Docs\n\n*Manual installation of openstack with Juju\n\n*Reference Architecture Description\n\n*Charm Web pages, Ex: Nova-cloud-controller Juju Charm Webpage\nAlso the many links off those pages.  Of course, those are all Ubuntu/Canonical/Juju links.  I often find it helpful to follow up on the many general openstack resources when I need to dig in deeper.  Which you seem to already be familiar with, so I'll spare you linking those here.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: Are you talking about network errors on LXC containers that you created inside VMs that you spawned in the cloud? If yes, then it's an MTU problem and there is no automatic fix yet. You need to lower the MTU of the container interfaces to 1454. If you look at the VM interfaces, they already have that MTU.\n", "Q: My computer won't boot up My computer won't boot up and I get the error messages shown below including the following message: \nInput/output error  \nFilesystem check or mount failed.    \nA maintenance shell will now be started.  \n\nWhat is going on in this screenshot? \n\n\nA: Do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot into the GRUB menu.\n\n*Select the Advanced options for Ubuntu choice.\n\n*Select a Recovery Mode kernel (doesn't matter which).\n\n*On the next window that pops up, select root.\n\n*Run umount /dev/sda1.\n\n*Run fsck -f /dev/sda1.\n\n*When that finishes, reboot.\n\n", "Q: Will dual booting windows 8.1 with Ubuntu affect the future Windows 10 upgrade? I currently have Windows 8.1 installed on my Lenovo Flex 2 15 laptop. It comes with Windows 8.1 pre-installed. I want to dual boot my laptop with Ubuntu 14.04, however, I am concerned that it may affect the ability for me to easily upgrade to Windows 10 when it comes out? \nPlus, as I have the Lenovo Flex, it can flip around into tent mode. Would it be possible on Ubuntu for it to be able to detect it and rotate the display to match it?\nPS. How would I easily be able to remove Ubuntu completely if it clashes with Windows?\nThanks\n\nA: I don't see a reason why you should be concerned. As long as you have enough free disk space on the Windows partition to do the upgrade there should be no further issues. I did an upgrade from Windows 8 to 8.1, where disk space was the only issue I had.\n\nA: It shouldn't, Windows 10 will be released via Windows Update, and it's highly unlikely. I'm using the Insider Preview of Windows 10, and it hasn't done anything to Ubuntu, but if you're unsure, wait until around June, when it will be released to Windows Update. If it did break, you could always use the fix install option when you use the Live CD.\n", "Q: \"Mail Authentication Request\" prompt My brother uses Thunderbird 31.6.0 on Linux Mint 17.1 (Cinnamon) and when he forwards me a message (I am on Lubuntu 14.04.1), it prompts me with a \"Mail Authentication Request\" for my email provider's password.  \n\nMail authentication request\n  Please enter the password for mail account \"1and1.net\"\n\nHow may that be stopped?\nWill responding send my email password back to the sender?\nSince I have already logged in, why do I need to relogin?\nUsing the correct password did not solve the issue.\n\nA: Your ISP is asking you to login to your SMTP server so that you can respond to a return receipt request.\n", "Q: ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Connection refused So I followed the guide on how to add a SSH key to GitHub, and added a new SSH key with a passphrase to GitHub and the SSH agent.

I'm currently reading \"The Linux Command\" and there is written:\n\nInstall Linux on a (not so new) computer. It doesn't matter which distribution you choose, though most people today start out with either Ubuntu, Fedora, or OpenSUSE. If in doubt, try Ubuntu first. Installing a modern Linux distribution can be ridiculously easy or ridiculously difficult depending on your hardware. I suggest a desktop computer that is a couple of years old and has at least 256 megabytes of RAM and 6 gigabytes of free hard disk space. Avoid laptops and wireless networks if at all possible, as these are often more difficult to get working.\n\nWhy shouldn't I install it on a new computer?\nMy system's specifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*AMD FX-6300 6x3.5GHz CPU\n\n*8GB Memory @ 1600 MHz\n\n*GeForce GTX 960 2GB GDDR5\n\n*2TB HDD\n\n\nCan I still install it?\n\nA: You should install it on a newer computer, if you can! That said, it's fine to install Linux on an older computer if you want.\nIt is unlikely that anything will go really wrong if you do install it. However, bear this in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Toshiba heat management isn't very well supported (I don't know how good kernel 4.0 is yet, I haven't updated my toshiba recently)\n\n*Ubuntu may not be as fast as the latest Windows is (Windows 10 is pretty good)\n\n*Not all hardware is compatible.\n\n*It might be worthwhile to dual boot, so you still have Windows if you ever need it.\n\nA: You should not install Ubuntu on a not so new computer, you should rather install it on a supported computer.\nThe problem is that sometimes the two things coincide.\nThat's because most hardware manufacturers either don't ship any driver for Linux or they ship them as proprietary.\nUbuntu distributions, per Ubuntu's philosophy, don't include any proprietary driver, plus to provide the hardware support is all on Canonical.\nFor those two things, it might happen that even the latest distribution could, upon installation, lack the support for some hardware.\nBut that again doesn't mean that you should install it on a not so new computer, rather just that, if you're buying a new computer for Ubuntu, you'll want to pay attenction on whether the hardware is supported or not.\nIf you're buying a new computer, here is the list of the officially supported desktops and laptops, but you can install Ubuntu on whatever desktop / laptop you want, it's just for your own ease that you'll want to choose one that is fully supported and that you might want to choose one that is fully supported out-of-the-box (even outside of that list of course).\n\nA: Why shouldn't I install it on a new computer?\nYou should, actually. The article suggests Ubuntu since it's much gentle for the beginners (although this is a subjective, but was true for me).\nYour machine has sufficient RAM and nice CPU. Feel free to install it; Unity, which is default desktop, should run alright with your graphics card, but if you have any issues, there's plenty of other choices\n\nA: you can install Ubuntu Linux as long as\n\n*\n\n*the computer has the minimum specification for the distribution\n\n\n*the machine's warranty is not invalidated and\n\n\n*your machine is not corporate and being administered by an IT department\nNew or old - it doesn't matter - as long as you do not try to install a 64 bit version on a 32 bit (older) machine.  As has already been mentioned, laptops - especially older ones, can be tricky to set up with WIFI - but with a bit of determination, they can be made to work with NDISWRAPPER. If your machine does not have enough resources to run Ubuntu, there are some lightweight Ubuntu variants such as Lubuntu which are intended for older machines with less processing/memory.\nIt is possible to buy a new machine online to a custom specification where you can specify no Windows. In not buying Windows with the machine, you can save money here!   When I did this, the manufacturer put a 30 day free trial version of Windows on the machine.  The first thing I did on boot up was to install Ubuntu on the machine using the opportunity remove the pre-installed Windows OS.\n\nA: I don't think it matters whether you install Ubuntu on new computer or old one.\nMy suggestion is you try to do this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get your hands on any computer (supported or not supported, windows or without windows, laptop or desktop or supercomputer, it doesn't really matter)\n\n*Try Ubuntu(or any Linux OS of your choice) in live run and see if everything works properly.\n\n*If everything is fine, install Ubuntu and see if the speed with which it works is acceptable to you.\n\n*If it is acceptable, go with it. If not, try another distro. If it doesn't work even after trying a few distros, then go with windows)\n\n", "Q: When I log in there is nothing except the default wallpaper, is there anything I can do?

If the removal failed,\nan  error message is issued.  If -delete fails, find's exit sta‐\ntus will be nonzero (when it eventually exits).  Use of  -delete\nautomatically turns on the -depth option.\n\n\nA: You missed the a ; at the end (and a space too between {} and ;). The correct command is:\nfind . -type f -name \"IMAG1806.jpg\" -exec rm -f {} \\;\n\n; indicates the end of -exec predicate of find. \nAlso note that we have used \\; i.e. \\ in front of ; to escape the interpretation of ; by shell, otherwise shell will treat ; as end of the whole find command and find will throw the same error. You can also use ';' instead of \\;. \nYou were using \\ at the end, this indicates your shell will continue to take input via PS2 (indicated by >), you typed IMAG1806.jpg again, so the whole command becomes:\nfind . -type f -name \"IMAG1806.jpg\" -exec rm -f {}IMAG1806.jpg\n\nAs you can see this is not a valid command at all with IMAG1806.jpg at the end, no closing of -exec predicate and without a space between {} and \\;.\n", "Q: Restore Windows Installation I've got the following problem: I had a ssd (sda) with windows 8 installed.

I have run the command:\nsed 's/http:\\/\\//www/' filename\n\nIn output,this command didn't replace \"http://\" with \"www\" why?\nand how to change delimiter in sed command?\n\nA: Your original command is alright provided you want to substitute only the first occurrence of http:// of the line with www:\n$ cat file.txt \nfoo http:// bar http:// spam\negg http:// test http://\n\n$ sed 's/http:\\/\\//www/' file.txt \nfoo www bar http:// spam\negg www test http://\n\nNow, as you want to replace all occurrences of http:// with www, just add the modifier g at the end:\n$ sed 's/http:\\/\\//www/g' file.txt \nfoo www bar www spam\negg www test www\n\nIf you want to set a character other than / as the delimiter, you can choose a character that has no special meaning to sed and easier to implement in the test case e.g. underscore (_)will be good choice in this case:\n$ sed 's_http://_www_g' file.txt \nfoo www bar www spam\negg www test www\n\nIf you want to modify the original file with the changed contents, you need -i option to edit the file in place:\n$ sed -i 's_http://_www_g' file.txt\n\nIf you want to take a backup of original file at the same time:\n$ sed -i.bak 's_http://_www_g' file.txt\n\nAfter this operation, the original file will be kept as file.txt.bak and the modified file as file.txt.\n\nA: That won't actually replace the contents of the existing file, you will need to redirect the output to a file. \nsed 's/http:\\/\\//www/' filename > filename.new\n\nor by using the -i option,\nsed -i.bak 's/http:\\/\\//www/' filename\n\nThis will make a copy with .bak extension of the file, then overwrite the original with the output of the sed command. \nAlso That will also leave you without a . between the domain, might wanna drop a . after www.\nEDIT:\nAs for the delimiter question, please check this. Examples are given,\nFrom: using-different-delimiters-in-sed\nBasically, sed takes whatever follows the \"s\" as the separator. \nsed 's_/a/b/c/_/d/e/f/_' \nIn this example _ is the delimeter. \n", "Q: Battle.net Won't Open I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 a few weeks ago on my system and everything was working fine.

I hope someone here can help.\nI have a Thinkpad T420 with two hard disks. The first hard disk is internal and contains Windows 10 Technical Preview. The second hard disk is in the DVD bay, and contains Ubuntu. I have reinstalled both operating systems multiple times trying to get this to work. One time I managed to boot Ubuntu, but then Windows was invisible. At this point I can boot Windows, but not Ubuntu.\nI'm using EFI, not BIOS. The second disk, with Ubuntu, is partitioned as follows:\n(1) Space for BIOS (bios-grub flag) because boot-repair insisted. But when I reinstalled with this partition, boot-repair deleted everything in it.\n(2) EFI partition (about 1GB), boot flag.\n(3) Swap partition, about 10GB because I have 8GB of RAM. I didn't want to include this because it's an SSD drive, but dire warnings from the Ubuntu install program caused me to include it.\n(4) Root, mounted at /.\nThe first time I did this, I could boot Ubuntu, but Windows was no where to be found. I tried adding Windows to the Grub menu with custom_40 (then run update-grub), but it was (and still is) completely ignored. This is another problem - maybe I should post it separately.\nI reinstalled Windows 10, and now Ubuntu is on the Windows boot menu (did boot-repair put it there?). When I choose Ubuntu, the Grub menu comes up. But when I choose Ubuntu (first item) from this menu, it fails to boot. I get the message, \"Booting in insecure mode\", and then it hangs.\nThis ThinkPad originally came with Windows 7, and it does not have Secure Mode to turn off - no secure mode.\nI've tried every boot-repair option, and it is not set up to handle this configuration. I need to edit the Windows and Grub bootloaders manually somehow, but I don't know enough about them to know what's wrong or how to fix it.\nHere is the output from boot-repair. I wish I knew what any of it meant. I've spent hours and hours on this. Can anyone help me?\nForget that - I can't paste it here because it's too long. Also, I don't know how to put this in a code block - I'm not going to manually type spaces in front of each line! Here's the link:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/10842921\n\nA: Both your disks use the GUID Partition Table (GPT), which means that Windows is booting in EFI/UEFI mode. This is your starting point for any repair, since this detail is not easily changed.\nThe fact that Boot Repair once said you needed to create a BIOS Boot Partition (the \"bios-grub flag\" you mentioned) means that that boot of the system was in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Installing GRUB (or Ubuntu) in that mode would do nothing useful. There's evidence that your /dev/sdb has such an installation of GRUB. It's conceivable that other remnants of this GRUB installation are lurking and causing problems. OTOH, the Boot Repair output you posted is from a run that was clearly in EFI/UEFI mode, since it's got efibootmgr output (lines 708-738, 1115-1145, and 1179-1209), which can be produced only in an EFI-mode boot. Thus, your attempts to boot Ubuntu and related tools have been inconsistent in the boot mode, which introduces a variable that greatly impacts how everything works.\nAs a first step to recovery, I recommend you enter your firmware setup utility and look for options related to support for \"BIOS,\" \"CSM,\" or \"legacy\" booting. If you find such an option, disable it, since any BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode boot will be a waste of time. Note that there may be options related to \"legacy USB\" support or something else. These options are not a problem. You just want to be sure the computer boots in EFI/UEFI mode, not in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Unfortunately, there's no standardization of option names or behaviors, so it's hard to say precisely what you should adjust.\nWith that task done, my recommendation is to download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. Prepare a medium and try to boot it. Its menu should show options for both Windows and Linux. Try them both. If you can boot both OSes, then the simplest solution is to install the rEFInd Debian package or PPA. When you reboot after doing this, rEFInd should appear and you'll be good to go. (You might want to clean up unwanted boot options or change rEFInd defaults, but you'll at least be booting.)\nIf rEFInd doesn't boot both Windows and Linux, add to your question details of what happens when you try.\n\nEDIT:\nrEFInd is my program. It's a fork of rEFIt, which has been abandoned. Much of the information on rEFIt's pages applies specifically to Macs and/or is outdated, so I wouldn't trust the rEFIt documentation in your case. The rEFInd documentation more up-to-date and more general, as it's written for both EFI-based Macs and UEFI-based PCs.\nGRUB 2 supports both MBR and GPT, when booted with either BIOS or EFI. GRUB is different for each boot mode (BIOS vs. EFI), though -- BIOS-mode GRUB is not identical to EFI-mode GRUB, although the two are very similar. Windows ties the partition table type (MBR vs. GPT) to the boot mode (BIOS vs. EFI). If Windows insists on installing to MBR, then that means that you booted the installer in BIOS mode; if it insists on installing to GPT, then that means that you booted the installer in EFI mode. As a general rule, it's best to stick to this linkage, even in Ubuntu, because it can head off problems down the road. (There are some situations in which you must use GPT even in BIOS mode, though. Most notably, this is the case when using an over-2TiB disk on an old computer that doesn't use EFI.)\nThe symptom of an empty partition table in GParted or the Ubuntu installer when you've created partitions in Windows is caused by \"damage\" to the partition table by the Windows partitioning tools. I put \"damage\" in quotes because some of these problems are not technically damage. In your case, the \"damage\" is most likely the presence of leftover GPT data on a disk that's been converted from GPT to MBR. I've written a Web page on this subject. The easiest fix is to run FixParts (the fixparts command, in the Ubuntu gdisk package) on the disk.\nNote that if Windows is installed on your MBR disk, then that means that your Windows installation, at least, is now in BIOS mode, not in EFI mode, as it was when you began. You can keep booting in that way, but if you want GRUB to manage the boot process, GRUB will also have to be the BIOS version; EFI-mode GRUB can't redirect to a BIOS-mode OS. (BIOS-mode GRUB also can't redirect to an EFI-mode OS.)\n\nA: I finally resolved this - without resorting to a third bootloader, and without running boot-repair, which was causing problems rather than fixing them. Maybe my settings were wrong, but I didn't end up needing it.\nI used 3 partitions for Ubuntu:\n(1) 1GB for /boot/efi\n(2) 8GB swap (I have 8GB of memory)\n(3) root, mounted at /\nA Ubuntu menu item magically appeared in the Windows bootloader, and a Windows menu item magically appeared in Grub  (well, after I fixed my Windows installation and ran \"sudo update-grub\").\nChoosing Ubuntu from the Windows bootloader chains to Grub2, from which I can launch Ubuntu. Selecting Windows from Grub2 also chained to a second menu at first - the Windows boot selection menu - but the second menu contained only the one item (Windows 10 Technical Preview). Since it was unnecessary, I bypassed it with this Windows command, entered as an administrator:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} displaybootmenu no\nSince the Grub2 bootloader was more efficient, I changed the boot order on my computer so Ubuntu booted before Windows Boot Loader. Now the computer boots directly in the Grub2 menu, from where I can select Ubuntu or Windows with a single click.\nI created a lot of problems on disk 0 (Windows) by repeated installs - sometimes using BIOS/MBR and sometimes using UEFI/GPT. The MBR got screwed up, and so did the Boot Configuration Data. First I booted to a command prompt on a Windows 10 setup disk (DVD or USB flash drive) and ran diskpart. I ran the \"clean\" command, which deleted all the partitions, set the disk to GPT partitioning, and reinstalled Windows. That solved my Windows boot problems.\nFor some reason, deleting all the partitions did not clear the corrupted BCD, so I did that manually. I used the BCDEDIT command line utility that comes with Windows 10 (and earlier versions).\nEverything is now working perfectly.

I'm using xubuntu 14.04. I recently got a wireless usb working by following the steps here.\nThe instructions say that anytime the kernel updates, I must recompile by entering the following into the terminal:\ncd ~/mt7601/src\nmake clean\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo modprobe mt7601Usta\n\nI'd like to know if there's anyway to create an icon on my desktop that I can just double click that will have the effect of entering the above commands into the terminal?\n\nA: You can make a script that can do these commands for you. Simply create a text file located on your desktop that contains the following.\n#!/bin/bash\ncd ~/mt7601/src\nmake clean\nmake\nmake install\nmodprobe mt7601Usta\n\nSave it to the desktop as kernelupdate.sh \nYou should then open up a terminal and run the followings commands\ncd ~/Desktop/\nchmod +x kernelupdate.sh\n\nThe script is now executable. You can execute it via the terminal using the following commands:\ncd ~/Desktop\nsudo ./kernelupdate.sh\n\nHere is the link to a related question that explains how to make it executable via clicking on the icon. How to execute sh script from a desktop shortcut?\n\nA: Low reputation disallows commenting, so the answer instead of comment to Brian's answer.\nThe script in discussion must be run with root privileges. To avoid some confusion, the shortcut for it's launch should look like\ngksudo script_name\n\nThe gksudo/gksu command brings up graphical dialogue for entering password\nAlso, the better place to store executables is not desktop, but your home folder. You may\nmkdir ~/bin\n\nAnd then use this bin directory to store this script. It is not strictly required, but strictly recommended to store programs and data in different places, not in one.\n\nA: How to create an icon on your desktop to perform the recompile-job\n\n\n*\n\n*Open gedit, paste the lines below into the file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Recompile\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"cd ~/mt7601/src&&make clean&&make&&sudo make install&&sudo modprobe mt7601Usta\"\nType=Application\nTerminal=true\n\n\n*Save the file as recompile.desktop on your desktop\n\n*Make the file executable by the command:\nchmod +x /path/to/recompile.desktop\n\nAfter you made it executable, a generic icon will show up on the file (not necessarily the same as in the image, depending on your icon theme).\n\n\n*Simply double click on the file to run it. it will open a terminal window and ask for your password to run the sudo part of the command:\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop files (with the extension .desktop) can be used to perform all kinds of applications or tasks. To make it run shell commands, the format is:\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"<command>\"\n\nIn this case, in the Exec= -line, the commands mentioned in your question are separated by &&, which is effectively the same as placing each command on a new line.\nThis makes it unnecessary to create a separate script; all is included in one launcher.\n\n*To make a .desktop file run from your desktop, you have to make it executable.\nAfter you made it executable, the name as it appears on your desktop is the name, defined in the line:\nName=Recompile\n\n\n*The line:\nTerminal=true\n\nmakes the command(s) run in a terminal window.\n\n*The example file is a very basic one.

Did it happened while you where running a update and the screen locked by automatic screenlocker? That was what happened to me, and had the same problem, but i did run the update again in tty and problem was solved. Maybe it works also with you.\n\nA: Reinstalling Unity would be\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\nbut I don't know if this will help.\nOf course you can access and copy your files from the TTY - you can do everything there if you don't mind a little typing...\nYou know the directory and file name of your document? Super!\nJust run the following command to copy it wherever you want:\ncp /PATH/TO/YOUR/DOCUMENT.FILE /PATH/TO/YOUR/TARGET.FILE\n\nIf you can't remember the path, use find. Let's assume you know the file name contains \"personal\" and is a .pdf file, then you can run\nfind ~ -iname \"*personal*.pdf\" 2> /dev/null\n\nwhere the ~ (= your home directory) is the path to search in and * are wildcards which can stand for anything. The command could e.g. spot the file /home/YOURUSERNAME/Documents/PersonalDocument.PDF\nIf you want to copy the file to an external drive or another partition which does not get automounted at boot, you have to mount it manually. Therefore you need to know the device path which you can find out with lsblk. Search through the output for a partition (name sdXN, where X is a letter and N a number) that fits the size of your drive. If you are not sure, compare the outputs before and after plugging the drive in. I will assume your drive's partition is /dev/sdc1.\nTo mount the partition /dev/sdc1 of your device, you first need to create a folder as mount point. You may chose the name and location randomly, but I would recommend you to put it inside /mnt (which requires root permissions). After that, you mount the partition to this directory:\nsudo md /mnt/MYDEVICE\nsudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/MYDEVICE\n\nNow you can access the files and folders in your device as if they were located inside the directory /mnt/MYDEVICE.\nAfter you are finished, unmount the device with umount (not unmount)\nsudo umount /dev/sdc1\n\n", "Q: Ctrl+Alt+F1 or stopping causes screen to go blank I need to install my Nvidia driver.

Very confused.\n\nA: setup.py is the file that will handle the installation of your packages. you execute it by prefixing it with the python command and by passing install as a parameter, hence, the \"python setup.py install\".\n.pyc are the compiled bytecode of your python code (for faster execution).

Couldn't you press this combination unintentionally?\nTry to boot from LiveCD - does it detect the TP?\n", "Q: 14.04 Lubuntu install randomly loses wired Internet connection I recently moved and ever since setting up my desktop, I've had seemingly random losses of my wired connection, although high bandwidth stuff (Netflix, maximizing an HD YouTube video) seems to trigger it fairly reliably.\nI'm fairly certain it's something to do with Lubuntu.  After the last outage, I hooked up a laptop to the same port on the router with the same cable and it connected just fine.  My wireless phone and tablet also maintain their Internet connection.\nRebooting temporarily fixes the issue.  Sometimes I need to reboot twice.\nWhat do you need from me to diagnose? :)\n\nA: you said you hooked up a laptop to the same cable/port etc but you were not using the same ethernet hw that you have in what I assume is a desktop?\nRebooting your PC also reinitializes the hw in the PC including the ethernet port.\nBefore you assume its Lubuntu... why don't you boot up a \"liveCD\" of ubuntu or lubuntu etc on the PC and see if it then works.   If you still have network problems then you might have to assume its the ethernet card/hw in the PC causing your problems.\nIf it is a desktop PC, if the ethernet is an add-in card .. maybe it got knocked loose in the move and isn't seated correctly?\n", "Q: ACPI Package problem on boot Ubuntu 14.04.02 I've been using Ubuntu for pretty long time and am quite experienced with it. But recently I discovered a new problem that I can't resolve on my own.\nMy system is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*AMD E-450 1.65\n\n*AMD Radeon HD 6320 with latest ATI Catalyst linux drivers\n\n*(AMD Catalyst 14.12 Omega linux drivers)\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04.02 64 bit system is up to date - a fresh installation\n\n*kernel - Linux 3.16.0-34-generic\n\n*4 Partitions: Swap 4GB, Ubuntu 80 GB, Windows 7 160 GB, Data over 200 GB\n\n*using burg for system choose with better splash look\n\n\nWhen the system is booting I see a line with:\n[    2.459938] ACPI : [Package] has zero elements (ffff880232749800)\n\nAfter that the system seems to work as it should maybe slower sometimes it stuck for a few sec and work again and it's quite annoying to see that kind of line under boot.\nA few months back when 14.04.01 was the latest Ubuntu version everything was perfect until 14.04.02 came out. I tried every possible way to resolve that problem: I wiped and did a fresh install again, changed drivers, kernel etc. But without success. It must be something do with 14.04.02. Something seems to have changed and created the problem but I don't know what exactly.\nIt doesn't matter if I change drivers or even kernel version. I tried from 3.13. to 3.19 last stable and problem still is there.\nWhen I add acpi=off noapic to boot line the problem is gone but the system doesn't work normally.\nAs I wrote above even after a fresh installation without any changes the problem still shows. I though maybe it happen after my changes in system but its not true.\nI read a few topics with ACPI has zero elements but all goes to use line acpi=off and they were very old for Ubuntu 11.04 or 12.10.\nDoes anyone have a idea how to resolve this?\n\nA: What are the problems that you are facing with acpi=off ? Have you tried acpi=force -- that has been also noted to have been helpful to some (but was causing some other problems to me)? Also, have you tried setting the acpi= parameter (either off or force) to BOTH /etc/default/grub's \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" line AND GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX= line (but to only one at a time, of course!)?\nYour problem doesn't seem exactly like what I've had and have. But similar enough that you might want to see if this would be the same issue.\nAs things are I have gotten Ubuntu installed ok with the details linked below and am having problems with powering down and the internal keyboard/trackpad. I can live with these, however -- until I've solved them.\nThe solution that allowed me to install Ubuntu together + details of the two (new) problems I have have -- is here. I'll be looking next into the shutdown/reboot problem, probably using this thread as the first step.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How to install a desktop environment in Ubuntu server? I installed Ubuntu Server 14.x for use as a server. It comes with a plain vanilla terminal UI.\nHow can I install a graphical desktop on it?\n\nA: Hmm... do you really need the xDE on server?\nIt's upto yours of course, but in my thoughts the server should not waste its resources for such things.\nAnyway, if you really want to lower its productivity, you may:\napt-get install *-desktop\n\nwhere asterisk stands for ubuntu, xubuntu, gnome etc... Consult available repositories.\nTo avoid significant productivity decrease, I'll suggest to install low resource consuming DE like XFCE.\nAll my servers have no DEs, and all administering tasks I do via WebMin or (mostly) via ssh.

Any ideas? Much thanks in advance. \n\nA: Try this link, I think it will tell you how to accomplish your objective.\n\nHow does one create emblems to work with Thunar?\n[...] Add the correct files to the \"emblems\" folder of your icon theme. Make sure you prefix the name of the file with \"emblem-\" and run \"gtk-update-icon-cache\" on the theme's directory file containing the \"index.theme\" file. Should show up immediately.\n\n\nA: I found the answer at the link. However, I could not get the emblem to stay for a partition. This is documented in the comments there.\nHow do I set emblems in Thunar without the GUI? \n\nA: Based on ManyRoads's answer:\n\n*\n\n*Create an emblem image file; filename should be prefixed with emblem- (for instance, emblem-drive.svg).\n\n\n*Put the emblem file inside the emblems folder of the icon theme folder (for instance, inside /usr/share/icons/elementary-xfce/emblems/symbolic).\n\n\n*Update the icon theme cache by running:\nsudo gtk-update-icon-cache PATH-TO-THEME-FOLDER\n\nwhere PATH-TO-THEME-FOLDER contains the index.theme file.\n\n\n*The emblem should be available if you click folder's Properties... → Emblems tab.\n", "Q: How to find disk path of a process If a process is running how can I find its disk path using command on terminal ?

My expert friend said there was a problem with how the HDD treated the computer.\nplease help me mankind, i really need to retrieve those files...:( please\n\nA: Reliable, but dangerous method is\n\n\n*\n\n*acquire (for while) equal hard drive\n\n*replace your HDD PCB with one from equal HDD\n\n*copy information to another storage (aside of two HDDs mentioned above)\n\n*replace PCBs back\n\n*give the equal HDD back to its owner\n\n\nBut, it may be disconnection inside the enclosure, so one should disassemble the enclosure and check, if the drive itself securely connected to converter.\n", "Q: Anyone else having trouble accessing dynamic windows partitions from Ubuntu? I have been trying to access my striped software raid disk from Ubuntu for at least six months.

I think everything is covered in terms of applications, as on a daily basis I use Skype, Word, Adobe Reader, and print via my WiFi network. \nHowever, my company uses Kerio and Outlook.  Is there a nice and powerful app like Outlook in Linux I can use for email, tasks, and calendars? \n\nA: Kerio supports Linux and MacOS as well as Windows, and is web-based, so your company made the right choice to enable you to go Linux. It gives you a number of choices, and I can think of three Outlook replacements which provide the functionality you seek:\n\n\n*\n\n*Evolution   \n\n*Thunderbird plus Lightning   \n\n*Kontact with its Kmail and Korganizer\nAlso, you need not use Adobe Reader, as there are many apps which will read and display PDF files. Linux also has PDF editing apps available which will give you power beyond that of Adobe's Reader.\n\nA: Another suggestion is Zimbra Desktop - it is strange enough thing, but it works and may be familiar enough for Outlook users.\nedit: The Zimbra site was reworked, and to ease the downloading, here the link to download page\nFrom its FAQ: Is Zimbra Desktop really free?\nYes. Zimbra Desktop is open source and free. We make both the software code and the application itself available to anyone at no charge.\n", "Q: Ubuntu installer won't let me install to my USB? I am new to these forums and I have limited experience with linux so bear with me.\nI am using my 16 gigabyte usb stick to install xubuntu onto itself. I had entered the installer and chose to manually partition the drive, creating a partition for root and another for swap. When I pressed okay, I got a dialog box saying \"Failed to create partition for swap partition (1024 megabytes)\" and I got sent back to the previous steps in the installation process. I even tried creating a partition table that did't even include a swap partition and that time I got a message saying \"Failed to create partition for root partition (15 gigabytes, formatted to ext4)\". Why is it that every time I create a partition, I get a message that says that it has failed to be created? \n\nA: I think the easier way to do this is either use a Linux Image that allows for persistence, or you need to do this with the use of a CD/DVD/USB and a Separate USB stick.  This way the Kubuntu install doesn't get upset when you are running gparted to edit the partition structure.  Universal USB Installer(for Windows) allows for persistence with certain images.  (This essentially allows you to install Linux to the usb and boot it keeping your changes every boot.  It is NOT as good as having it truly installed to a USB however.  You do know that all USB sticks have a maximum number of read and writes before they fail, so I would suggest an external HDD for maximum system life)\n", "Q: GRUB not showing Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04.2 after Ubuntu 14.10 installation I have Windows 8.1, Ubuntu 14.04.2 and Ubuntu 14.10 on my machine.

What is the right way to do it? Also, if there's a way to overwrite the original file, I'll be too happy.\n\nA: lame cannot read in filenames from input. You will have to use find's -exec or xargs to run it over each file found:\nfind . -iname '*.mp3' -exec lame -b {} \\;\n\nIf a second filename isn't specified, lame will attach another .mp3 to the given filename and write to that file. lame does not support writing to the same file. You'll have to convert to another file, then copy it over the original file:\nfind . -iname '*.mp3' -exec sh -c 'lame -b 160 \"$0\" \"$0\"-160 && mv \"$0\"-160 \"$0\"' {} \\;\n\n\nA: Try a the following:\nStart with removing whitespaces from the file names since these seems to cause trouble:\nfor f in $(find . -name \"*.mp3\"); do rename \"s/\\s+/_/g\" *; done\n\nExecute a loop and traverse through all files:\nfor f in $(find . -name \"*.mp3\"); do lame -b 160 \"$f\" tmp && mv tmp \"$f\"; done\n\nNow you will overwrite the original files with those created by lame.\n", "Q: Desktop files with superuser privileges I have Matlab installed under /home/fer/Matlab, with the main exec file being /home/fer/Matlab/R2014b/bin/matlab. There is something weird with it and it only works if I open it with the terminal using sudo. If I run it without sudo it throws a permission error and closes (I guess it's reading somewhere).\nAnyway, I was trying to create a .desktop file to be able to open it from the menu, and because it needs to run under sudo, in the exec line I wrote:\nExec=gksudo -u root /home/fer/Matlab/R2014b/bin/matlab\n\nWhen I click on the shortcut, it asks me for my password, then the Matlab splash appears, then closes, and nothing happens. This looks a lot like a problem with Matlab itself, but am I doing it right with the exec line of the .desktop file? Do I need to add anything else? If a program requires a terminal to run from, is there anyway I can emulate one from the desktop file?\nEDIT: As asked in comments:\nwhoami outputs fer and all files and subdirectories in Matlab/R2014b are owned by user fer and group fer. The error is written in a Matlab window, saying tht there is not write permission on /home/fer/.matlab/R2014b/temp0x... I will try to look into that directory.\n\nA: Cut out and reworded from @MyUserIsThis' edits to his question:\nOk, I chowned recursively the whole directory /home/<user>/.matlab so I would have permissions to write on it and it was fixed. \nBTW, in case someone else runs into this, the exec line of the desktop file should include the option -desktop for the script to work properly when not called from the terminal:\nExec=/home/<user>/Matlab/R2014b/bin/matlab -desktop\n\n", "Q: unable to edit /etc/hosts file in ubuntu 14.10 I changed the hostname from default name, set during installation to something short and nice, but didn't change it in /etc/hosts file. /etc/hostname is changed after restart but sudo is not working.\nI tried to search for answers on internet.

The easy solution would be to run the script with sudo:\nsudo start-yarn.sh\n\nNote, however, that scripts have no business creating directories in /. What does this script do? Why would it need to create /logs? There is probably a variable you need to set in the script. Either post the script here, or look for a line that has something like:\nPREFIX=\"\"\n\nThat, or something similar, is probably present in your script and will allow you to set the base directory it will be working in. Set that to something like ~/yarn/ instead. You really don't want to be creating random directories in / and if that script is really doing so, I would even go so far as to consider it a bug. \n", "Q: The \"supported packages\" in R From http://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/bin/linux/ubuntu/\n\nSUPPORTED PACKAGES\nA number of R packages are available from the Ubuntu repositories with\n  names starting with r-cran-.

Thank you in advance.\n\nA: This is too long to fit in a comment so I'll have to phrase this as an answer. Sorry for the delay in answering but I'm going through old questions to see if there's any hope at finding a resolution.\nCrack open your terminal and enter this command:\nsudo sed -i 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=False/g' /etc/xdg/autostart/*.desktop\nEnter your password and press enter (note that when you enter your password there are no asterisks or anything).\nNow, open your start menu and preferences and then click on Default Applications for LXSession. In there you will see, on the left, Autostart.\nAny hidden services and programs should now be visible. Is Firefox in there and hidden? If so then untick the box.\nNow, let's put it back because it may complain about updating the database next time. To do that we basically just swap the command around like so:\nsudo sed -i 's/NoDisplay=False/NoDisplay=True/g' /etc/xdg/autostart/*.desktop\nOf course you can also just look in /etc/xdg/autostart and see if something is amiss but where's the fun in that?\nAnyhow, if this doesn't answer your question and you've since resolved the question then please let us know what you did to resolve it so that others may learn from your experience.\n", "Q: Lenovo G50-45 GFX recognition issue I own the above mentioned laptop. I was running Win 8.1 x64 OEM on it up until recently when I decided to go back to Ubuntu.\nThe problem is on Windows with latest drivers it nicely detected, that I have both an AMD R4 w/ 1 GB VRAM and an AMD R5 w/ 2 GB VRAM installed.\nOn Ubuntu with latest Catalyst installed from AMD's website it shows only AMD R4. inxi -F gave the following output:\n Advanced Micro Devices [AMD/ATI] Mullins [Radeon APU A4-6000 with R2 Graphics] \n           X.Org: 1.16.0 driver: fglrx Resolution: 1366x768@60.0hz \n           GLX Renderer: AMD Radeon R4 Graphics GLX Version: 4.4.13283 - CPC 14.501.1003\n\nIs there a way to get most of my system again?\n\nA: Upgrading to 15.04 might resolve this, as doing a brief check with a LiveUSB running both Ubuntu GNOME and Xubuntu w/ kernel 3.19.* confirms both cards being detected with drivers out of the box.\n", "Q: Windows + Ubuntu dual boot not happening This question might be a repeat of several other questions. But I have tried most of the solutions and beaten my head to understand the remaining. To no avail, however.\nSo I basically have two partitions, which I created using Windows's disk management utility. Partition C: has Windows on it. And Partition E: had nothing.\nSo I decided to install Ubuntu on it. I wanted to try Ubuntu out and see whether it was faster than Windows and better to use. I downloaded the latest Ubuntu 14.04 and booted it from the pen drive. On the installation options there was no option of \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\". So I went to \"Something else\" and selected the Partition E: and installed Ubuntu on it. Here's what happened afterwards.\n\n\n*\n\n*When restarting, the computer did no detect the presence of Ubuntu at all. It directly started Windows, without giving me an option to select between the OS. And while in Windows, it did not show the other drive on which Ubuntu was installed.\n\n*So I thought, that maybe bootloader of Ubuntu hasn't been installed. So if I re-install Ubuntu, it might detect the presence of an already installed Ubuntu and then maybe I can do automatic installation instead of \"Something Else\" and install Ubuntu with the bootloader and swap.\n\n*I did that and the program did  detect Ubuntu and gave me two options: \"Erase Disk and install Ubuntu\", \"Install Ubuntu alongside Ubuntu\" and \"Erase Ubuntu and Install Ubuntu\". I chose the last one.\nNow, bootloader only shows Ubuntu. There is no mention of Windows. And moreover, if I select Ubuntu, nothing really happens. The screen turns purple and stays like that. I can only run the test version of Ubuntu from the pendrive. I don't know what to do now.\nIs there a reliable, easy way to use both Windows and Ubuntu? I'm an Ubuntu noob --- so I am really struggling with it all. \nEarlier I had just one partition with Windows on it. When I used the pendrive to install Ubuntu, it never detected the presence of Windows at all. I really want to give Ubuntu a shot, but at this moment I can't take the risk of not having Windows on my PC. So it's either Ubuntu+Windows or no Ubuntu at all!\n\nA: Boot into Ubuntu and open a terminal window. From here, run sudo update-grub. That will search for other operating systems and will hopefully add Windows as an option in GRUB.\n\nA: I have done the same thing after selecting try ubuntu while booting off of the pendrive to see the windows partion and upgrade grub.\n\nA: Try installing it using UnetBootin . You can use 'Try Ubuntu without installing' option\n\nA: Okay what you have done here is, first you have installed Ubuntu in your E drive. (It had Ubuntu and Windows both when you did this, so that it loaded up Windows and not show you your Ubuntu partition on Windows).\nAnd then you have completely flushed your hard drive and installed Ubuntu and Ubuntu alone (I can't quit figure out what is causing Ubuntu to not to boot up). \nNormally how i do Dual boot is, first install Windows. And then install Ubuntu as same as you did in your first step. If the GRUB boot loader which will show you both Windows and Ubuntu is not appearing while you are booting the system, and going into windows. Do the following....\nBoot Ubuntu from the pendrive, Select to Tryout Ubuntu (don't install again). When you are on the Ubuntu desktop, do what i have mentioned on this link.\nAfter this is successful, restart your PC. You will have both Ubuntu and Windows ready to go.\nHave fun exploring, and welcome to the world of Linux...\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu 14.04 have something like Window's DXDiag?

I installed FreeBasic under Ubuntu 14 using the provided shell installer,\nand received a message that the installation was successful. \nBut, when I attempt to run the compiler it gives a list of missing -dev files,\nonly two of which I was able to locate in repositories. \nThe installation README indicates that some of the listed dependencies may have different names in some Linux dialects. \nHow do I locate the missing dependencies in Ubuntu?\n\nA: The FreeBASIC wiki (specifically, http://freebasic.net/wiki/DevBuildLinux) describes how to get FB to compile on Linux, and suggests the following packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*gcc\n\n*make\n\n*libncurses5-dev\n\n*libgpm-dev\n\n*libx11-dev\n\n*libxext-dev\n\n*libxpm-dev\n\n*libxrandr-dev\n\n*libxrender-dev\n\n*libgl1-mesa-dev\n\n*libffi-dev\n\n\nYou can install them all in one command with:\nsudo apt install gcc make lib{ncurses5,gpm,x11,xext,xpm,xrandr,xrender,gl1-mesa,ffi}-dev\n\nSome of the packages may only be needed if you actually plan to build the FreeBASIC compiler and runtime libraries from scratch.  But they are at least sufficient for getting programs to compile and run with fbc.\n\nA: I did a little bit of googling for freeBASIC dependencies , this might help\nsudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib\nsudo apt-get install lib32ncurses5-dev\nsudo apt-get install libx11-dev:i386 libxext-dev:i386 libxrender-dev:i386 libxrandr-dev:i386 libxpm-dev:i386\n\n", "Q: Access other folder then /var/www/html in Apache2 over http JUST FOUND THIS; FOR PPL WITH APACHE PROBLEMS MAYBE.\nALSO THIS SOLUTION SEEMS TO BE FOR THE PATIENT ONES xD\nhttp://sites.duke.edu/workblog/files/2014/12/www.dedoimedo.com-apache-web-server-lm.pdf\nI have been working on this for 3 days now.\nFinally able to acces http://[my.domain].com/\n(installed mySQL and PHPmyAdmin, but I just read that those are not really needed?

Just tell me what you need to know! Also thank you all very much for your time and effort!\nReally appreaciate it!\n\nA: Symlink way\nIf you want you can simply make an symlink to it, like i did on my Raspberry Pi, but I'm not sure if it's safe when your website is public. It works in home network. \nLet's say you want to access /home/j (because \"j\" is my username) from your /var/www. To do that you'll need command ln -s /home/j jhome. Make sure you are in /var/www while running this command. \nNow you should be able to access it simply using cd jhome. You can test it by putting html file inside /home/j and linking to it by for example your index.html.\nYou can do same thing with other directories and names.\nMore professional, Apache configuration way\nAlso, I've found some Apache documentation here and Stack Overflow topic, I think it's more professional way to do same thing and I believe it's right way to do it. \nIt turns out that you need to add Alias /alias_directory /path_on_your_machine line to your Apache config file (which for me is /etc/apache2/apache2.conf). (it also works for me) I recommend backuping file before editing it. \n\nHere are exact commands I used:\n\n\n*\n\n*cp /etc/apache2/apache2.conf{,.bak} - make backup\n\n*echo \"Alias /jhome /home/j\" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf - append line, you can also do that with nano or other text editor.\n\n*service apache2 restart - restart Apache, it won't work without it\nRemember to run commands as root, because You'll get permission errors without it.\nI hope I helped you in some way. :)\n\nA: If you have phpMyAdmin up and running, you probably have installed apache2. The process of mapping an http address to a directory in your localmachine is called a virtual host. Read more on this here. Or google for how to create a virtual host and a domain for my local machine.\nI can guide you if you need more assistance on this matter.\n", "Q: debsums flags some files as broken even after package reinstallation When I run debsums -c in ubuntu it flags the following files as corrupted:\n/usr/lib/aspell/it.rws \n/var/lib/aspell/it.compat\n\nTrough dpkg -S I discovered that those two files belong to the package aspell-it (italian dictionary for GNU Aspell).

Thanks.\n\nA: The \"unknown\" value under \"File System\" for partitions 2-8 and 10 indicates that GParted couldn't recognize the filesystem(s) used on those partitions. The values under the \"Name\" column in your parted -l output indicates that these partitions probably have highly specialized purposes, so there's not much point in even trying to access them from Ubuntu; it would be like trying to access a Linux swap partition from Windows.\nAs a side note, you've got a number of ext4 partitions that are incorrectly marked as being Windows partitions (with the \"msftdata flag\"). I recommend you fix that problem, since it means that the ext4 partitions will show up in Windows as unformatted, and if you try to access them, Windows will erase their contents.\n", "Q: why does /proc/cpuinfo show a single processor on the BQ Aquaris phone? phablet@ubuntu-phablet:~$ cat /proc/cpuinfo \nProcessor   : ARMv7 Processor rev 3 (v7l)\nprocessor   : 0\nBogoMIPS    : 2072.57\n\nFeatures    : swp half thumb fastmult vfp edsp thumbee neon vfpv3 tls vfpv4 idiva idivt \nCPU implementer : 0x41\nCPU architecture: 7\nCPU variant : 0x0\nCPU part    : 0xc07\nCPU revision    : 3\n\nHardware    : MT6582\nRevision    : 0000\nSerial      : 0000000000000000\n\nas this is a quad core device I was kind of expecting more cores to show up here.

The trick is to add the destination IP address as an additional condition. Also you do not need the -m tcp part. So if you wanted to accept traffic to port 80 on both aliased interfaces, the rules would be:\n-A INPUT -i venet0 -d xx.xx.xx.xx -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -i venet0 -d xy.xy.xy.xy -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\n\n", "Q: All system text has shrunk after update The text for the whole system has shrunk a lot. \n\nI think this is since the last update.\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS, with Kernel 3.13.0-49-generic.

Here is the report: report\n\nOS Information:\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.10\nRelease:    14.10\n\n\nA: This is probably just a false positive. /usr/share/mime/mime.cache is a generated file of all known mime types on your system. It's not an executable.\nVirus scanners detect malicious software by sets of known fingerprints (hashes). This model leads to some false positives, inevitably. Perhaps it's a coincedence a known Windows virus matches the fingerprint as found on a Linux system, perhaps it's because the fingerprint just matches a certain MIME type pattern that will match inevitably on any Linux system...\nFor now, I wouldn't worry about it, but just contact the ClamAV team to ask whether this is a known issue with them already.\nAlso make sure to stay updated with the most recent ClamAV fingerprints (freshclam).\n\nA: I had the same    (cache  PUA.Win.Exploit.CVE_2012_0110)    on my Linux.\nSo I booted up from the USB or DISK instillation >  To the try Linux mint out, >  looked for the  file in  (  /usr/share/mime/mime.cache)  and copped it to a USB stick.\n Logged back on to my installed Linux  mint, and replaced the one on my sys,   with the one I copped to my USB stick ( Now it no longer detected as a virus)\n\nA: I have a fresh installation of Ubuntu 15.10 and it appeared as soon as I started browsing the web. I only went to certain websites so far. I took a look inside the file and it does appear to be a collection of various programs on my computer. I changed permissions to /usr/share/mime/mime.cache to 400. I also emptied the file as root using:\n echo \" \" > /usr/share/mime/mime.cache\n\nThe command for changing permissions:\n chmod 400 /usr/share/mime/mime.cache\n\nAlso, ClamAV tends to detect viruses in the ~/.cache/mozilla/firefox/[string].default/cache2/entries/ directory, so I changed the permissions to 400 and nothing is downloaded in that directory anymore. [string] looks like about 10 alphanumeric characters that seem to be different for each user profile. Firefox still works, so this was an easy work-around. I have done the same on a Mac and Windows (different directory paths) for Firefox, Chrome, and Safari, and the browsers work and no entries are downloaded. \n", "Q: Can't install Teamviewer due to libxtst6 I cant seem to install Teamviewer 10, at the Software Center it says: \n\"Dependency is not satisfiable: lib32asound2\" \n\nNot really sure what to do there, I tried:\nsudo apt-get install lib32asound2\n\nbut it said:\nE: Unable to locate package lib32asound2   \n\n\nA: According to this possible duplicate, you need to install the 32-bit version instead of the 64-bit.

Had it installed on my desktop, played some games with Steam and playonlinux... \nBut it was easy, because Ubuntu detected everything automaticaly. I installed on my parents notebook too, and it was smooth. \nThey all had 3 or more years old hardware.\nBut my laptop requires skills beyond me, that I still do not possess.\nThe history with my laptop and ubuntu started with 14.04.\nIt booted from USB, worked for some time then freezed. I think it had something to do the touchpad. While I was using a mouse, the system seamed stable.\nI could play some games with it too, but when I started any 3D GAME, my video card cooler whent max speed and didnt stop before a reboot.\nMy Wifi worked, but not so well.. Connection kept droping. \nWhen 14.04.1 came, I tried once again. Same thing, and my wifi didnt work at all.\nWhen 14.04.2 came, It wouldnt even boot. It got stuck at a nouveaux error. Booting with noacpi, it started X. But, when I made a click with the mouse, or touched the touchpad, it freezed.\nWifi, didnt work at all too.\n-> About my notebook:\nIts a sager equivalent Gaming PC.\nIt has a 4th Gen i7 mobile.\nA GTX 780M Nvidia + Intel\nWhat I did so far:\n- About the touchpad: I red somewhere that Unity had some problems with some kinds of touchpads. I tried Xubuntu and Mint, and it ALMOST worked. X freezed in a much lower rate, and I could Ctrl + Alt + F2 to a shell, then Ctrl + Alt + F7 back to X, that it worked. With Unity, hole system freezed.\n- About video-card: instaled xorg-edger drivers, updated kernel to the latest version, tried others distros. All distros based on kernel 3.16 or higher wouldnt even boot.\n- About wifi: Installed WDCI, removing network-manager and network-manager-gnome, but it didnt work. I red some posts saying to increase the signal power, but I'm afraid of frying my network adapter, so i didn't do it.\n\n-> A light at the end of the tunel:\nLast week I had an idea. I created a real fisical disk with vmware pointing to a PenDrive with 32Gb.\nI installed the new Elementary OS Freya in it, then apt-get update, upgrade and dist-upgrade.\nSince VMWARE had no nvidia card, no bublebee, nvidia, nouveaux were installed by default.\nWith a clean system, I added xorg-edger ppa and installed the latest nvidia nvidia-prime.\nWhen I booted my laptop using the USB stick, evertying worked! \n- Wifi could connect, and althoug much better, with still connection dropping, but in a smaller rate. (im using my smartfone thethering trough USB for a stable connection)\n- Played some games from harddisk with playonlinux and video card cooler worked like a charm.\n- Touchpad had no problem at all.\n-> What I want:\nI want to install Ubuntu. If Unity still have issues with touchpad, I dont mind installing Pantheon or XFCE later.\nBut, how do I do it? How can I make ubuntu install without nouveaux, nvidia drivers so I can boot into it? Could be even on shell without X. (i would need some help connecting wifi in shell)\nAbout my wifi, when my sistem is up and running, I will look further into it.\nI'm open to sugestions.\nTnks in advance, and sorry for the long post. If it was 9gag, I would post a Potato.\n\nA: How can I make Ubuntu install without nouveaux and nvidia drivers?\nMy suggestion for this one is a very advanced one. You could make a custom ubuntu image that will allow you to remove packages you don't want, and add packages that you do. Including changing grub before you make your image so it won't boot into a graphical mode. Here's the link to a guide that walks you through it step by step. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization \nHow can I can I boot Ubuntu without X?\nYou can use this guide How do I disable X at boot time so that the system boots in text mode? to edit grub and boot without x at startup. However, this guide requires you to be logged into the system to make changes, so you may have to edit grub at boot. If you boot directly into grub, and pres 'e' (for edit) you should get some code displayed. If you look for the \"quiet splash\" line and manually change it to \"text\". Once you save and edit, you will boot into Ubuntu without an X.\nIt may be possible to boot into Ubuntu without graphics and remove the other packages you want rid of without starting x. This might be the simplest solution.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 ethernet connection using graphical network manager I am trying to connect Ubuntu 14.04 to the internet with an ethernet cable.

First of all: Thank you for taking the time to read this and provide some help. Any advice is appreciated.\nI am using Nautilus-Actions to add a custom context menu's action to create a copy of a JPG image and reduce its quality (and the file size) while preserving the image's dimensions.\nLet's say I have this picture with 2.3 MB (2 261 588 bytes) file size and:\n\nAfter opening the file in GIMP 2.8 in order to just export a copy and use the JPG Export dialogue box to reduce the quality of the image to 30%:\n\nI get these properties in the image copy (251.8 kB (251 797 bytes) file size):\n\nI am using Nautilus Actions to batch process a lot of images to reproduce the same behaviour via context menu by selecting a bunch of files in Nautilus, right click on any of these selected files, and choose the proper Nautilus Actions action. The result is a file containing the image in the same dimensions as the original, with less quality of course and the file size is a bit greater (275.3 kB (275 265 bytes) file size) but that's not a major problem for me.\nThe problem is happening when I try to batch process several image files, which results in the first file name cloned into several file names containing a different image each one. With the properties I set in this set of commands:\n\nBasically, each Nautilus Action is using these parameters:\nCommand: convert\n\n*\n\n*From (imagemagick)\n\nParameters: %F.jpg -quality 80%% %F-80q.jpg\n\n*\n\n*Which is interpreted as: convert path/to/file1.mid.jpg -quality=80% path/to/file1.mid-80q.jpg\nWorking directory: %d\nSo, the result is:\n\nHere we can see each image processed in a different file but just the first file name is used to assign the new names to the copied files. I want a result like:\nFile1.jpg === File1-80q.jpg\nFile2.jpg === File2-80q.jpg\nFile3.jpg === File3-80q.jpg\nFile4.jpg === File4-80q.jpg\n\nAnd so on...\nI have used Phatch to do such tasks but what I want is to just right click on the selected files and process in a single action.\nIs it there a better way to do this? or... Can I improve in some way what I am doing already?\nThank you very much for your support.\nP.S. I have seen How can I batch convert images to b/w while preserving the folder structure and Is there a way to batch export SVGs to PNGs? but I am not trying to run this from a terminal but from a context menu. If I am omitting something in this exercise don't hesitate to let me know! I'll appreciate it a lot. Thank you!\nEdit\nAfter using muru's answer I find that solution partially does what I expect.\nMore specifically it solves the file names problem. Nevertheless, I also expected to get smaller file sizes by running the proper convert file.jpg -quality 30% command and it is dropping bigger file sizes as you can see:\n\nDoes anyone know if there's something else I should add to the parameters seen in muru's answer? I appreciate a lot your efforts to provide help on this issue.\nUpdate\nI am writing this just to let people know I have seen where the problem was with the compression. The file I was trying to compress was already fully compressed so (as mentioned in muru's answer):\n\nThe process was just adding overhead without gaining anything.\n\n\nA: You cannot use %F twice in a command like that, because %F gets replaced by the names of every file selected. For example, a command of sh with parameters -c 'printf \"%%s\\n\" \"$@\" > foo' %F %F will create a file named foo with the names of every file selected, twice. Therefore the convert command that actually runs is:\nconvert file1.jpg file2.jpg ... -quality 80% file1.jpg file2.jpg ... fileN.jpg-80q.jpg\n\nAnd since the last file is taken to be the output file name, only it will matter.\nWhat you can do is wrap your command in bash -c and run a for loop:\nbash -c 'for i; do convert \"$i\" -quality 80% \"${i/%.jpg/-80q.jpg}\"; done'\n\n(where I am assuming that all files end with .jpg)\nIn an action, you will have bash as the command, and for the parameters:\n-c 'for i; do convert \"$i\" -quality 80%% \"${i/%%.jpg/-80q.jpg}\"; done' - %F\n\nYou can make this more complicated to handle any extension, at which point you might as well skip Actions and use scripting.\n", "Q: how can i fix this vlc problem I use ubuntu 14.04LTS, when I type in:\nsudo apt-get install vlc    \n\nI receive this error:\nReading package lists...

These data can be 'anything anywhere', and might confuse the partitioning tool, that you intend to use afterwards, because the tool expects a certain structure (partition table and file system).\n\nClone from an iso file to create a USB boot drive\nWhen you clone an Ubuntu iso file to a USB drive, the USB drive will be a bootable live drive, that can be run to 'Try Ubuntu' or to install Ubuntu into an internal drive. dd is a cloning tool, when used as described in the original question. There are also other cloning tools, for example 'Disks' alias gnome-disks, the 'Ubuntu Startup Disk Creator' in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and newer versions, 'mkusb' and 'Win32 Disk Imager'. USB drives that are cloned from iso files have the ISO9660 file system which is read-only. This is a feature of the system, that can be used on CD/DVD drives and it is inherited when cloned to USB drives.\nExtract from an iso file to create a USB boot drive\nThere are other tools, that extract the files from an Ubuntu iso file to a file system in a USB drive. 'Unetbootin', 'LinuxLive' and 'Rufus' are extracting tools. 'mkusb' is an extracting tool, when it is creating a persistent live drive. An extracted system in a USB drive can be read-write.\nMake the USB drive read/write again\nPersistent live drive\nIf you want to use the pendrive both to boot Ubuntu live and to store files, I suggest that you create a persistent live drive. This can be done in Windows with 'LinuxLive' and 'Unetbootin', and in Ubuntu with 'mkusb' and 'Unetbootin'. See the following links and links from them,\naskubuntu.com/.../how-do-i-make-a-persistent-live-usb-of-ubuntu-...\nwww.linuxliveusb.com/\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb/persistent\nunetbootin.github.io/\nRestore the USB drive to a standard storage device\nOtherwise you can restore the USB drive to a standard storage device with 'mkusb-dus'. The first megabyte of the drive is wiped and a new MSDOS partition table with a FAT32 file system is created automatically. This method works also when other tools are confused by some data.\n\nSee the following links and links from them,\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb/wipe\n\nA: These instructions worked for me to reformat an 8GB USB flash drive that was made useless after I used dd to write a bootable iso file to the flash drive. I reformatted the flash drive to its original FAT32 format as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Remove all of your USB devices except for the 8GB USB flash drive that you want to reformat, so you won't get confused about the device name of the USB flash drive later on.\n\n\n*List all the partitions.\n sudo fdisk -l\n\nSearch the results of the command for output that looks like this:\n Disk /dev/sdc: 7864 MB, 7864320000 bytes\n 30 heads, 33 sectors/track, 15515 cylinders, total 15360000 sectors\n Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\n Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\n I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\n Disk identifier: 0x00016288\n\n    Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n /dev/sdc1   *        2048    15359999     7678976    b  W95 FAT32\n\nIf you see something like 7864 MB (8GB) in the output (see the example output above), then that is your 8GB USB flash drive. In this example it is called /dev/sdc. Now open the Disks application from the Dash and check again to make sure that the device name of your 8GB flash drive is the same as what you got from running the command: sudo fdisk -l.\n\n\n*Create a partition table on the disk of type msdos, sometimes known as Master Boot Record (MBR).\n sudo parted /dev/sdc mklabel msdos\n\nIn this example I used /dev/sdc for the name of the device which is what was found in the results of step 2. I can't stress strongly enough how important it is to verify the device name before running this step!\nWarning: If you type the wrong device name you may overwrite your operating system or another one of your partitions containing important personal files!!! So be careful and check the device name a second time. Open the Disks application and check the device name of your 8GB USB flash drive in Disks. It should be the same device name!!! Now check again! You don't want to accidentally type the wrong device name!\n\n\n*Add an empty \"primary\" partition, which will hold a FAT filesystem later.\n sudo parted -a none /dev/sdc mkpart primary fat32 0 8192 \n\nOnce again in this example I used /dev/sdc for the name of the device which is what was found in the results of step 2. The command specifies the start point (from 0 MB) to the end point (8192 MB). If the 8GB USB flash drive does not have the full 8192 MB space, parted will adjust it automatically. If the terminal returns a message that the start point can't start at 0 MB and you have to use some other small number close to 0 MB, type Y to accept this. Note the command is creating a single, primary partition on the whole disk.\nThis newly created partition will have the ID /dev/sdc1. That is because the device name in this example is /dev/sdc and the 1 at the end is because it is the first partition on that device.\n\n\n*Create a FAT filesystem on the /dev/sdc1 partition by formatting the partition.\n mkfs.vfat -n \"8GB-USB\" /dev/sdc1\n\n/dev/sdc1 is the partition ID from step 4. \"8GB-USB\" is the partition label, which can be your own choice of label, just enclose the label inside two double quote characters.\nYou now have a ready-to-use reformatted USB flash drive with an 8GB FAT partition.\n\nA: Flash devices don't last forever. When they fail, they sometimes exhibit symptoms similar to what you're reporting. Although it's worth trying other suggestions here, there's a high probability that your device is simply dead and that you must replace it.\n\nA: If you write an file system image onto a medium, the file system won't know, how much space there actually is, so you'll be restricted to its original size, unless you extend it (if the file system type allows it).\nAdditionally, you probably used an image with a ISO 9660 file system, which doesn't support modification at all. If you want to create a bootable and writable USB drive, use tools like Startup Disk Creator.\n\nA: Run gparted, choose your flash drive, then go to Device -> Create Partition Table and then choose one from thes list, msdos is just fine, then you should be able to create new partition(s).\n\nA: Ok, so Here's what I did :- \n1) Booted into a windows system , formatted the usb as fat32.  \nThe problem was still as it is although on windows I was able to read/write from the usb. \nSo, I rebooted my system and the usb stick worked as before.  \nI don't know why this happened. \n\nA: It sounds like a permissions problem. A few things I've found can cause this quirky problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Saving the data from one account/system, and try to add from another?\n\n*Using a protected name for the folder (such as Documents). That almost always messes with permissions, and locks a user out of the folder or drive. \n\n\nI've found that Gparted is a good tool for diagnosing and re-partitioning thumb drives. Running nautilus as superuser (in the terminal type gksu nautilus, and enter your admin password when prompted) to allow you to check on permissions in files and folders on the drive. \nYou may want to wipe the USB drive and start again (there are geeky ways around the permissions problems, but do-overs are often faster--just be sure you don't create the same problem again). \nHope that helps. \n", "Q: Change lockscreen in MATE?

I put an executable script in /etc/cron.hourly, but that script didn't run every hour actually it never runs at all.\nHere is the script(Hour-sound) that i made:\n\n#!/bin/bash\nmplayer ~/Music/sfx_msg-highlight.wv &> /dev/null &\nspd-say -r -50 -p 50 -t male3  \"The time now is $(date +\"%l %p\")\"\nnotify-send \"It's: \" \"$(date +\"%l %p\") now.\" -i ~/Pictures/\"first tee.png\" -t 5000\n\nMy crontab is:\nDISPLAY=\":0.0\"\nXAUTHORITY=\"/home/naruto/.Xauthority\"\nXDG_RUNTIME_DIR=\"/run/user/1000\"\n\n0 * * * * /home/naruto/Hour-sound.sh\n\nWhile the mplayer and spd-say commands are run correctly, the notify-send is not. I also tried redirecting error to a file:\n0 * * * * /home/naruto/Hour-sound.sh 2>/tmp/error\n\nBut that showed no output. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: One problem is that you're trying to run a graphical application (notify-send) from cron. That takes  a little tweaking. You need to set XAUTHORITY and DISPLAY variables in the crontab so that it can connect to your running X session and you need to set XDG_RUNTIME_DIR so it can connect to your pulseaudio session. Unfortunately, these need to be set in the crontab itself, so you can't use /etc/cron.hourly. Instead, run crontab -e and add these lines:\nDISPLAY=\":0.0\"\nXAUTHORITY=\"/home/YOURUSERNAME/.Xauthority\"\nXDG_RUNTIME_DIR=\"/run/user/1000\"\n\n0 * * * * /path/to/script.sh \n\nChange the value of  XDG_RUNTIME_DIR to whatever is returned when you echo them from a terminal. On my system, this is:\n$ echo $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR\n/run/user/1001\n\nIt will probably be the same on yours, but check first. Now, your script will run every hour and should work as expected.\n\nA: A script ending with .sh is not executed in /etc/cron.hourly folder:\n\nhttps://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=308911\n  Links or binaries inside a directory handled by run-pars (like\n  /etc/cron.daily) will not run if a period is part of their name.\n\nrename the script\nmv /etc/cron.hourly/Hour-sound.sh /etc/cron.hourly/Hour-sound\n\nor put the script-call into \n/etc/crontab\n\nwhich allows the .sh ending\n\nA: As you've probably seen in the comments to your question, the cronjobs in /etc/cron.hourly (and the other, similar directories) are executed by run-parts. run-parts is a little picky about filenames. By default it doesn't execute files whose filenames contain anything other than (all of those from ASCII)\n\n\n*\n\n*uppercase letters\n\n*lowercase letters\n\n*digits\n\n*underscores\n\n*dashes (\"minus signs\")\n\n\nSo if your script has a filename of for example \"myscript.sh\", it just is ignored, because run-parts does not like the dot.\n\nA: Don't use script with extension (abc.sh) and add your need place. (cron.hours).\nadd your code stuff to abc file and save.(for your need) (this should be bash command)\nuse \nsudo chmod +x abc\n\ncommand to make executable file.\nedit etc/cronrtab file\n\nthere has a predefined few lines.edit from your minutes to hours line and save it.\nthen it will run properly.\n\nA: An addition to the accepted answer.\nYou can test your scripts under /etc/cron.* first to ensure it will be executed.\nExample, you have this script: /etc/cron.hourly/sample-script. Execute the below command to check if it is accepted by run-parts:\nrun-parts --test /etc/cron.hourly\n\nThe output should be something like this:\n/etc/cron.hourly/sample-script\n/etc/cron.hourly/some-other-script\n...\n\nIf your script is listed in the output, then you're good to go.\n", "Q: How update pygobject without breaking any dependency?

When pressing it again the text that was on the line gets capped at about ~15 characters and the new command in the history (that is supposed to be displayed) gets capped by a few characters in the beginning, and they are sort of merged together on the command line.\nE.g. my two most recent commands are\nJava Test4 words-250.txt words-250-in.txt\nJavac Test4.java\n\nWhen pressing the arrow-up key once, the first line is displayed, as it should. When pressing it a second time, this is displayed:\nJava Test4 worc Test4.java\n\nDespite this weird output, the terminal works fine. If for instance I press enter after doing the above, Javac Test4.java will run.

It's hard to describe so here is a video of it and this is my current setup:\nlspci -nn | grep VGA \n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

So then I wondered why the problem had not occured with my old installation of Ubuntu 14.04. The only difference is that I'm now running a 64bit version.\nSo I think I'm stuck with the open source drivers, i.e. xserver-xorg-video-radeon, but that wouldn't be such a bad thing if this flickering problem could somehow be fixed. I did a lot of research and tried a bunch of things such as defining other options of the driver in /etc/X11/xorg.conf or specifying options for the module in /root/defaults/grub an running grub-update but none of this changed anything. I can't think of anything more to do.\n\nA: One of my laptops has the same problem.\nThe workaround for me is NOT to use any kernel above version 3.13.x-xx\n(see the launchpad bug about this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1479136 )\n\nA: Here is a workaround for flickering like this. First, install Compiz Config Settings Manager (CCSM) by typing into your terminal sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager, or search for it in the software center. When it's finished, open it up and scroll down to the Utility section. Make sure \"Workarounds\" is enabled. Click on it, and scroll down to the bottom. Enable \"Force full screen redraws (buffer swap) on repaint\". If that doesn't solve the issue, also enable \"Force complete redraw on initial damage\".\n", "Q: Dark and black colors on screen have fuzzy 'noise' The closest thing to this problem I can find is Fuzzy static noise on screen, but that is not the same problem I am having.\nI'm running Ubuntu 15.04 on an Asus G750JW laptop.

Now I could use the extra space it was occupying. LVM2 is in use on the Linux side but the Windows partition which has since been removed pre-dates the LVM setup. The space in question is to be added to the /home partition. I've created an admin user who has a home dir that is not in /home so that I can log in as him and get this done. Procedure?

Edit/add the xorg.conf file, and put the following in it:\n/etc/xorg.conf\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"touchpad\"\n    Driver \"synaptics\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n        Option \"ClickPad\" \"true\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n   Identifier  \"Intel Graphics\"\n   Driver      \"intel\"\n   Option      \"AccelMethod\"  \"uxa\"\nEndSection\n\nIf you use sleep (ex. lid close/open) then you may encounter that touchpad is not working when the computer wakes up.

I am not aware of any direct method using redirection that can achieve what you need.\nAlthough it is possible using the script program. It will basically save everything printed on the terminal in that script session.\nFrom man script:\nscript makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal. \nIt is useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an \ninteractive session as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file \ncan be printed out later with lpr(1).\n\nYou can start a script session by just typing script in the terminal, all the subsequent commands and their outputs will all be saved in a file named typescript in the current directory. You can save the result to a different file too by just starting script like:\nscript output.txt\n\nTo logout of the screen session (stop saving the contents), just type exit.\nHere is an example:\n$ script output.txt\nScript started, file is output.txt\n\n$ ls\noutput.txt  testfile.txt  foo.txt\n\n$ exit\nexit\nScript done, file is output.txt\n\nNow if i read the file:\n$ cat output.txt\n\nScript started on Mon 20 Apr 2015 08:00:14 AM BDT\n$ ls\noutput.txt  testfile.txt  foo.txt\n$ exit\nexit\n\nScript done on Mon 20 Apr 2015 08:00:21 AM BDT\n\nscript also has many options e.g. running quietly -q (--quiet) without showing/saving program messages, it can also run a specific command -c (--command) rather than a session, it also has many other options. Check man script to get more idea.\n\nA: You would need to create a script with the following:\necho 'command -params/r' > file.lst\ncommand -params >> file.lst \n", "Q: How to use GTK/GNOME notifications services in Java? I've started learning Java and to have some project to actually put knowledge to the practice, I decided to make a custom notifications service. I know that Java is not the best option, but that's what I decided, it's just for me.\nSo my question is: what APIs do I need to use to create it? I guess it's GTK...\nAnd one more: can you give any tutorial about actually programming that kind of notifications?\nThank you.\n\nA: Short Answer (TL;DR):\nUse Java-Gnome bindings, it is a native library that enables Java applications to use GTK and GNOME APIs/Services.\nLong Answer:\nJava official slogan is \"write once, run anywhere\", where it states that Java programs can be run on various platforms (processors) and operating systems. To do that, the Java programming language provides a generic platform and operating system (a virtual machine) for \napplication development (API), instead of native (operating system) one.\nThus, to use a specific operating system API, one must do native calls. By doing that, Java cannot guarantee that your code is portable anymore. \nJava-Gnome is a native library that exposes GTK and GNOME APIs to Java applications.\nSee an example in: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6030004/java-program-using-gnome-java-will-not-compile\n", "Q: How do I get xstarfish wallpapers to work in Ubuntu 14.04 xstarfish is a command that generates a random wallpaper.  I am attempting to use it with Ubuntu 14.04 and Unity.\nAnyways, I've set all of the following gsettings to false, but I still just have a black wallpaper, the xstarfish one becomes visible sometimes just as I log out.\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.background false\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background draw-background false\n\nI have no idea where to go from there.  It just seems to me as if xstarfish doesn't want to draw the desktop background, not a problem with something else drawing on top of it.\n\nA: I just stumbled across this page, and thought I should point out that I just (like, tonight!) released an HTML5/JavaScript port of Starfish/xstarfish at http://micah.cowan.name/starfishjs/, fulfilling my personal desired to have an easy-to-use cross-platform version of Starfish (though, sadly, it of course can't automatically set your desktop background - you have to right-click the image to save it and do that yourself!)\n\nA: The program does not seem to work with modern desktops.\nAs you say, it generates an image. By default, it generates a pattern with a size of 256x256.\nI do not know if there is a better way, but you could do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install ImageMagick (for the composite command):\nsudo apt-get install imagemagick\n\n\n*Create a new pattern with this command:\nxstarfish --outfile wallpaper_tile.png\n\n\n*Create a new wallpaper (e.g. 1920x1200)\ncomposite -tile wallpaper_tile.png -size 1920x1200  xc:none wallpaper_out.png\n\n\n*Set the new wallpaper (change this: <your_absolute_image_path>):\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file://<your_absolute_image_path>/wallpaper_out.png\n\nHere is a small script. It creates a 1920x1200 image (change the dimensions in the script). Place the code in a new file (e.g. \"set_wallpaper\").\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsize=\"1920x1200\"\n\nxstarfish --outfile \"$HOME\"/wallpaper_tile.png\ncomposite -tile \"$HOME\"/wallpaper_tile.png -size \"$size\"  xc:none \"$HOME\"/wallpaper_out.png\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file://\"$HOME\"/wallpaper_out.png\n\nexit 0\n\nSave file and make it executable:\nchmod +x set_wallpaper\n\nand start it for a test.\nSo that the image is changed after a time, you can create a new CRON job:\ncrontab -e\n\nand add a line like this:\n15 * * * *       <script_path>\n\neg:\n15 * * * *       myapps/set_wallpaper\n\nThat your wallpaper is changed every 15 minutes.\n\nA: I fixed this by telling xstarfish to create an output file\nxstarfish --outfile /location/of/file.png -d 60\n\nThis tells xstarfish to update the background file every 60 seconds.\nThen I just set the background to that file in the unity menus, when xstarfish updates the background, the wallpaper also updates(for some reason).\n", "Q: My Viber aborts unexpectedly while launching on my ubuntu 14.04 LTS Im using ubuntu 14.04.\nI have downloaded the latest version of viber for linux from the official source.\nI installed it though terminal\nsudo dpkg -i viber.deb\n\nand it got installed successfully without any error, but whenever I try to open it from dash or anywhere it closes within 2 second.

Why?\n\nA: If gedit opens up after the download is complete, that's because your browser is set up to open downloaded files automatically and to open them in the system's default application.\nIf gedit opens up because you double-clicked on the .sh file in nautilus, that's because of the default behavior of nautilus, which is to open .sh files in the system's default text editor rather than to run them.\nTo change nautilus' default behavior:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Files from the Unity Launcher\n\n*On the Unity Panel, click on \"Edit\" > \"Preferences\"\n\n*Select the \"Behavior\" tab and under \"Executable Text Files\" select \"Run executable files when they are opened\" and click on the \"Close\" button.\n\n\nOn why gedit freezes, it might be that the .sh file is very long.\nIf the .sh is not very long, it might be that it is encoded with some exotic encoding that gedit cannot handle.\nIf the .sh file is not encoded with any exotic encoding, try to reinstall / update gedit by running this command in a Terminal: sudo apt-get remove gedit && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gedit\n\nA: sh files aren't double-click executables; they need to be run from the terminal.

I also want the terminal to exit once it opens the pdf file.\nI have tried adding exit to the end of my script however that does not close the terminal. I did try to search online for an answer to my question but I couldn't find any proper one, I would really appreciate it if you guys could help.\nI need an answer that only kills the terminal from which I run the command not all the terminals would this be possible? The previous answer which I accepted kills all the terminal windows that are open. I did not realize this was the case until today.\n\nA: You can use exec ./your-script.\nA terminal emulator like GNOME Terminal quits when the initial process running inside it--which is usually a shell--quits.\nIf you are already in a terminal and the only thing you want to do before quitting that terminal is to run a particular script (or program), then this means you no longer really need the shell that's running in it anymore. Thus you can use the shell's exec builtin to make the shell replace itself with the process created by your command.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the case of your script, that's another shell process--just as how a second shell process is created when you run a script without exec.\n\n\nThe syntax is exec command, e.g., exec ./your-script.\nexec: an Example\nFor example, suppose I have a shell script called count, marked executable, and located in the current directory. It contains:\n\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nfor i in {5..1}; do echo $i; sleep 1; done\n\nAnd, in a terminal, I run:\n\nexec ./count\n\nThis prints the numerals 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, one per second, and then the terminal window closes.\nIf you run this from something other than the first process run in your terminal--for example, if you ran bash first to start another shell instance--then this brings you back to the shell that created that process, rather than quitting the terminal. (This caveat applies equally to exit-based methods.)\nYou can use ./your-script; exit.\nIf you don't want to tell your shell to replace itself with the new process (via exec), you can tell it to stick around but quit itself immediately after the new process finishes.\nTo do this, run your command and the exit command, separated by ; so they can be given on one line.\nThe syntax is command; exit, e.g., ./your-script; exit.\ncommand; exit vs. command && exit\nYou may notice this looks similar to the ./your-script && exit method suggested in kos's and heemayl's answers. The difference is that:\n\n\n*\n\n*&& runs the second command only if the first command reported that it succeeded by returning an exit code of zero.\n\n*; runs the second command regardless of whether or not the first command reported success.\n\n\nWhich one you want depends on the specific situation. If the command fails, do you want the calling shell (and hosting terminal) to stay up? If so, use &&; if not, use ;.\nThere is also command || exit, which quits the calling shell only if command reported failure.\n\nA: This script terminates the terminal and thus the shell and himself.\nIt  mercilessly kills all processes. If you have multiple tabs open in a terminal, then these are also closed.\nThe problem is, if several terminals are opened and these are child processes of gnome-terminal-server, all terminals will be killed.\nIn this case, the script should be started in an independent terminal, eg xterm\n<your_command> & disown\n\nPPPID=$(awk '{print $4}' \"/proc/$PPID/stat\")\nkill $PPPID\n\n\n\n*\n\n*PPID\nThe PPID is the parent process id, in this case the shell (e.g. /bin/bash)\n\n*PPPID\nThe PPPID is the parent process id of PPID, in this case, the terminal window\n\n*<your_command> & disown\nIn the bash shell, the disown builtin command is used to remove jobs from the job table, or to mark jobs so that a SIGHUP signal is not sent to them if the parent shell receives it (e.g. if the user logs out).\n\n*awk '{print $4}' \"/proc/$PPID/stat\"\nGets the value of the fourth column of the file /proc/$PPID/stat (e.g. for /proc/1/stat it returns 0) \n\nA: You could source your script instead of running it e.g\n$ cat run.sh\nexit;\n$ ./run.sh #will not close\n$ . ./run.sh # will close\n\n\nA: If you're opening just one file, you don't really need to use a script, because a script is meant to be an easy way to run multiple commands in a row, while here you just need to run two commands (including exit).\nIf you want to run exit after a command or after a chain of commands, you can chain it to what you have already by using the && operator (which on success of the previous command / chain of commands will execute the next command) or by using the ; operator (which both on success and on failure of the previous command / chain of commands will execute the next command).\nIn this case it would be something like that:\ngnome-open <path_to_pdf_file> && exit\n\n*<path_to_pfd_file> = path of the pdf file \nexit put at the end of a script doesn't work because it just exits the bash instance in which the script is run, which is another bash instance than the Terminal's inner bash instance.\nIf you want to use a script anyway, the most straightforward way it's to just call the script like so:\n<path_to_script> && exit\n\nOr if the script is in the Terminal's current working directory like so:\n./<script> && exit\n\nIf you really don't want to / can't do that, the second most straightforward way is to add this line at the end of your script:\nkill -9 $PPID\n\nThis will send a SIGKILL signal to the to the script's parent process (the bash instance linked to the Terminal). If only one bash instance is linked to the Terminal, that being killed will cause Terminal to close itself. If multiple bash instances are linked to the Terminal, that being killed won't cause Terminal to close itself.\n\nA: Personally I would execute the command to open pdf or other files in subshell, put a delay to let the files open, and then exit. Basically, here's what I've tested (nohup gnome-open *.pdf &); sleep 2; exit\nVariation on this would be nohup gnome-open *.pdf && sleep 2 && exit\n\nA: The simplest solution would be:\nxdg-open file.pdf && exit\n\nUnlike other similar command nohup is not needed to make the command ignoring SIGHUP, the reason being xdg-open will exit spawning a child process which is preferred application to open the pdf file. As the actual process started from the terminal is no longer there to be killed, nohup is not needed.\n&& indicates the next command will be run if the previous command is successful i.e. returns the exit code 0 ($?=0) and exit will simply close the terminal.\n\nA: To explicitly answer the title question,\n\"Exit terminal after running a bash script\":\nRun only your script in the terminal\nWithout looking at the details what the script does, a script can be directly run inside a terminal with the option -e (--command), without starting a shell - it is used instead of the shell then:\ngnome-terminal -e ./script.sh\n\nUse the option -x (--execute) when you want to provide arguments to the script. With this, just the whole remainder of the commandline is taken as command and arguments.\ngnome-terminal -x ./script.sh foo bar\n\nIf your script exits, there is no interactive shell that could hold up anything by waiting for user input.\nExamples\nThe teminal will just exit after the command running in it exits - like this, closing after sleep has run 4 seconds, with no shell:\ngnome-terminal -x sleep 4\n\nOf course, you can stil use shell scripting, because your script is using a different shell instance anyway.\nAlso, you can run a shell with an explicit script - it will not be interactive:\ngnome-terminal -x bash -c \"echo 'Hello!'; sleep 4\"\n\n\nA: With \"When script exits, close terminal\" in the terminal settings, I place this at the bottom of an executable bash script to close it:\necho \"Automatically Closing in 3 seconds...\"\n\nsleep 3\n\nexit\n\nread # show terminal output\n\nWhen I put the exit after the read, script and terminal window don't close.\nAnother nice one that I often use to reload a script from its startpoint in the same terminal:\necho \"Enter = Restart\"\necho \"Ctrl+c or Close button to Close\"\n\nread\n\nexec bash \"$0\" \"$@\" # Restart script from the beginning\n\nHere the restarting rule follows 'read'.\nCheerio.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu on more than one machines with same configuration?

Once said Image is ripped CloneZilla should let you use the image and distribute it to several hard drives at once, (given they are all in the same computer).

A copy of a GoPro, I think.\nWhen connected via USB it  asks whether it should be used as a PC camera or a mass storage device.\nWhichever is chosen, the PC cannot 'see' it at all.\nIs there a work-around?\nAm I missing a 'driver'? \n\nA: Firstly, SCJAM is not a copy of GoPro. It is a Chinese manufacturer of miniature cameras, and one of their product lines are cuboid cameras.\nI've spent 50+ hours going through reviews and eventually decided to go for their top model - SJCAM SJ5000+ Ambarella (with Panasonic's \"Ambarella\" processor), because it is almost as good as GoPro Hero 4 Black and 4 times cheaper. When I say \"almost\" I mean \"white balance is slightly different - in my view better, and slightly worse video stabilisation\". And yes, housings of the SJ**** line are compatible with GoPro mounts for a reason - GoPro has the largest number of available mounts. Worth noting that \"SJ****\" is a fake of \"SJCAM SJ****\".\nWith that out of the way... I've got Ubuntu 14.04.02 LTS, clean install with no extra drivers, software, etc., and my SJCAM SJ5000+ Ambarella with software ver. 2.4 mounts with no problem as \"storage\" (set up on camera end). Ubuntu recognises it with no problems.\nI'd suggest: firstly check if you have a microSD card in the camera. Is not the camera itself that the OS mounts but the microSD card.\nSecondly, I'd perhaps upgrade packages - just in case. In terminal type\nsudo apt-get update && upgrade\n\nFinally, it is time to see what devices plugged into all USB ports your computer can see. In terminal type:\nlsusb\n\nAnd check if you can see a line with no micro-controller description. This will be the SJCAM. For example mine looks like this:\nme@mylaptop:~$ lsusb\nBus 002 Device 003: ID 8087:07da Intel Corp. \nBus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp.

I'll be sure to update this post when it's released but also keep an eye on the blog http://blog.jujugui.org/ and the twitter account https://twitter.com/jujuui\nIn the interim you can copy the bundle file to your computer, modify its contents, then drag and drop it onto the GUI to deploy it.\n", "Q: Are there any security issues with making my /etc/sudoers publicly readable? I've recently started to use my GitHub account as a way to synchronize my various config files across computers, including my /etc/sudoers. Are there any security vulnerabilities that this exposes? \nEdit: If it makes a difference, I'm on 14.10.\n\nA: My initial reaction was to say it's a bad idea. However, having looked at your specific personal sudoers file, I'd say, no; it looks pretty standard for an Ubuntu system. You're not exposing any of\n\n\n*\n\n*specific software versions (that may have vulnerabilities) \n\n*non-standard usernames (though if I was a bad guy, I'd be trying 'josh' or 'joshua'\n\n\nI quickly looked at the other config files in your GitHub repo and they seem fine -- for the moment! For the future, you'd have to very careful when changing your config files, always remaining conscious that such changes will be public.\nIn general, I'd prefer to use a private repo to save having to think about the possible ramifications of each and every change being committed. I have my own remote repos set up on my personal Ubuntu server for this reason but AIUI, Bitbucket provide free private repos.\nManaging /etc\nI don't actually store /etc files in my repos. For re-running changes to configuration files, I make those changes using sed commands, e.g., to automatically change the amount of information being reported by logwatch, I run:\nsudo sed -i.bak \"s/^Detail.*$/Detail = High/\" /usr/share/logwatch/default.conf/logwatch.conf\n\nTo add an email alias for webmaster if one doesn't already exist, I run:\ngrep -i webmaster /etc/aliases || sudo sed -i.bak '1 a\\webmaster:\\troot' /etc/aliases\n\nI also use a package called etckeeper to keep track of all changes to the /etc directory tree using git. However, so far I've only ever used it as a historical record for the system in question and as a means to roll back any changes to /etc which don't work out. It has an option to push its commit to a remote repo but haven't (yet) used it.\nOther more complicated solutions (which I haven't yet got around to learning) are configuration management tools such as Chef or Puppet which can be used for quickly recreating system configurations.\n\nA: I would advise you not to publish anything in a public repository, which is located in the /etc directory. This information will make you vulnerable in the worst case. The risk that you overlook a file containing sensitive data is too large.\nMaybe it's enough if you only commit the data, but do not push.

I'm trying to get all of these to talk between themselves, while being on different subnets, and I can't figure how, yet.\nProblem is that my ISP provides a router for the TV, phone and internet. We cannot change the hub's lan range (192.168.2.0/24), while my lan with my own router is on 10.0.0.0/13 (and I don't want to change it).\nHere's the setup: \nMy ISP's hub/router is on 192.168.2.1, so that's the gw facing internet.\nMy own router is connected (DHCP) to this router, its LAN address is thus in 192.168.2.0/24 .\nI have PC1, PC2 and PC3 in 10.0.0.0/13, going on the Net thru my own router, which is connected onto my ISP-provided router in 192.168.2.0/24.

Will Ubuntu Phone have that feature in near future. Will we be able just to connect phone to a monitor and work with it in office ?\n\nA: To answer this properly, yes, it is possible to use a phone as a PC replacement, if all your computing needs can be met by the apps available, and hardware. Ubuntu Touch is still actively developed and supported by UBports community, and still with the goal of building a converged OS and applications.\nIncluded is an experimental feature, Libertine, which allows to install legacy applications in a container. These generally do not work well on a phone screen, and the feature is still quite buggy, but it provides a way to run some necessary legacy applications when needed. When connecting a phone to an external display, keyboard, and mouse, these applications are much more usable. However, ideally fully converged native applications would be available to use, so you could work on any screen with any input methods, whenever you needed to.\nAs for the hardware side, it depends on the phone/tablet being used. If your devices supports wired external display, either directly or via Slimport or MHL adapters, you should be able to get a nice full resolution external display. For devices which don't support that, UT does have Miracast support, which presents a compressed/scaled windowed mode view over WiFi. For keyboard/mouse options, this again depends on the hardware. Devices that need to use wireless display will be more responsive with USB OTG adapter to use wired mouse and keyboard. Devices with wired display and direct display out (mini-HDMI or mini-DisplayPort) that also have a USB port can use either wired or Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Devices which require a Slimport or MHL adapter over micro-USB, will require Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. And devices which have USB 3.0 or 3.1 on type C connector, with Slimport, HDMI alt mode, MHL, etc… should be able to use either wired or Bluetooth mouse and keyboard. These may also be able to use wired ethernet via a docking station, such as the Samsung DeX dock. Beware adapters and hubs that require DisplayLink though, as it is a proprietary protocol, and no drivers available when running Ubuntu Touch, though they may work OK if you want to use an Android device in this manner. \nGiven all the above, yes, it is very much possible to use a phone as a replacement for a PC, and even Android itself is moving more toward this possibility. For Ubuntu Touch, see the list of supported devices, in case you want to choose one to try this with.\n\nA: Unless phones move away from the ARM processor architecture and are equipped with HDMI or VGA outputs, we will always have separate apps and OSes for them. The reason many apps aren't available for phones is because developers don't want the extra work of compiling their apps for ARM. Normal Ubuntu can't be installed on phones because of how they work. If mobile devices went to Intel or AMD processors, then normal Ubuntu would work, but until that happens fully (which will be a while) we're not going to see normal Ubuntu on phones anytime soon.\n", "Q: Need script to display Usage message if non option is chosen from menu I have managed to get my program to function fine except for posting a usage message should the user attempt a non-menu option.

My question is, what does ubuntu offer me while using a Chromebook? Does it support Arabic language? \n\nA: What does Ubuntu offer me while using a Chromebook?\nUbuntu can offer everything it has to offer in general when installed in a Chromebook.\nThere are two popular ways of installing Ubuntu on a Chromebook known as Chrubuntu and Crouton. Only Chrubuntu uses the official version of Ubuntu. Under some conditions one can install standard Ubuntu without using either scripts. For this answer I will consider a standard stand-alone Ubuntu installation. That is, the situation where the default ChromeOS is completely replaced by Ubuntu.\nMost of these will also apply for a dual boot using the Chrubuntu script.\nNote: the Crouton install method uses the ChromeOS kernel and thus is not an official version of Ubuntu. This answer does not apply to Crouton.\nAdvantages\n\n*\n\n*Unlike ChromeOS, Ubuntu does not depend as much on having an Internet connection for most tasks. For example, one can write a poem or some programming codes in Ubuntu while there is no internet. To be fair, some of these things can be done without the Internet in ChromeOS as well.\n\n\n*If you are used to all the software that works in Ubuntu, they will work in Ubuntu installed in a Chromebook. For example, you can use Skype (if you care about Skype) in Ubuntu in a Chromebook, you can't do that with the ChromeOS.\n\n\n*You can use the Chrome browser in Ubuntu installed in a Chromebook. This means anything that can be done in a standard Chromebook, can be done with Ubuntu on a Chromebook.\nDisadvantages\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu won't install or work on all Chromebooks. Only Chromebooks with Intel processors work well with Ubuntu. However, some of the Intel Chromebooks don't work at all as they can't be booted into Legacy mode.\n\n\n*Installing Ubuntu in a Chromebook will void the warranty. And installation isn't easy. Depending on the version of Ubuntu and the make and model of the Chromebook, some parts may not work at all or not work well without further tinkering.\n\n\n*Chromebooks are not designed for Ubuntu. In particular, Chromebooks come with either 16GB or 32GB of internal storage. If you replace ChromeOS with Ubuntu there is enough space for a standard Ubuntu install. However, there may not be enough space for your music, video etc. in the internal storage. Replacing the internal SSD with something bigger may or may not be possible depending on the make and model. If you want to dual-boot ChromeOS and Ubuntu, you may want to buy a bigger SSD and replace the original one.\nSimilarly, Chromebooks come with either 2GB or 4GB of RAM. In most models the RAM is not up-gradable. So, if you want to use an app in Ubuntu that needs a lot of RAM, this will not work for you.\n\nA: As far as languages go this link might be helpful\nhttp://people.ubuntu.com/~dpm/ubuntu-10.04-translation-stats.html\nAs far as installing on a Chromebook, it would probably depend on which exact one you're looking at. As far as I know they don't all share any kind of unified hardware specifications so an install may be possible on one, but not on another.\n", "Q: How to run 'ufw' without interactive mode?

Among them: going html5 fullscreen, playing \"empty\" audio file and so on. But nothing seems to work and I haven’t found anything in the API documentation regarding this.\nHas anybody successfully managed to do this or know how to do it? \n\nA: Apps cannot prevent the screen from locking.\nThe only way to keep the screen from locking, is for the user to go into System Settings and change the screen lock timeout to Never.\n", "Q: Does Steam install games to the / (root) partition? As far as I know, Steam (and pretty much every other application) is installed to the \"/\" partition.  If that's the case, why is such a small \"/\" partition recommended?  Couldn't one or two Steam games wipe out your \"/\" fairly easily?  It seems like a \"/\" partition of 20GB max is usually recommended.\nAm I missing something, or if I plan on installing games and applications should I make a larger \"/\" partition?\nEDIT:  I'm asking because I haven't actually seen anyone mention this before. The general recommendation is to have a seperate /boot, /, /home, and swap partition, and the general consensus is that a \"/\" partition doesn't need to be any bigger than 10GB - 20GB. It seems as though everyone recommends something like this: \n/boot - 500MB \n/ - 10GB - 20GB\nswap - same as RAM\n/home - rest. \nMaybe I'm weird, but looking at my Windows 7 install \"Program Files accounts for nearly 700GB of disk usage, and everything else (including Windows 7) is barely 100GB.   Is that not normal?  It just seems more normal in my mind to have \"/\" and /home switched.\n\nA: By default Steam stores games in your home directory (hence home partition) under ~/.local/share/Steam, not in the root partition - Steam I don't think is made to have games available system-wide. When you install a game it gives you a option to install it elsewhere:\n\nAs you can see above, I have created a folder extra in the root partition under which I install steam games that won't fit in my home directory (this folder also means I have somewhere to put stuff if I run out of space on another partition):\n\nHere are the commands I created that directory with (you could easily call it something else):\nsudo mkdir /extra\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /extra\n\nThe first step creates the directory, the seconds makes sure you can access it as a normal user.\nI don't where you got your drive size recommendations from, but I would say a / partition with a minimum size of 20GB (mine contains 25 Gb of files excluding the above Steam installed game, possibly due to other non-steam games and VM programs installed to the root partition), to allow enough space to install various programs to meet your needs (total size of my root partition is 50 Gb). Swap needs to be sized to meet your RAM size (also depending on whether you want to hibernate the computer or not - a opinion on how to do this is here). With swap you can also create a swap file which is one of the partitions, see here\n\nA: U don't need to create /boot.\nIf u want have 2 systems, u can install grub on /.(/ would have 10/20 GB)\nSo 2 partition(/,/home) will be good and u can choose where install game on steam.\nIf u have more than 4/8 GB don't create swap cause it ll be not used.\n", "Q: How to resolve dpkg: error (--configure) So this error occurs when installing Prey Anti-theft software:\nInstalling init scripts.\ndpkg: error processing package prey (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n prey\n\nYou can use this link to understand the error message.\nSo this error message tells us there is an error with the post-installation script...which does not help us very much.\nHas anybody encountered such a problem before and know how to remedy it?\n(Similar questions have been posted on the forum at https://help.preyproject.com/topics but without any useful answers)\n-- Edit --\nThis is the prey.postinst script:\n    #!/bin/bash -x\n####################################################################\n# Prey Debian Postinst Script\n# Written by Tomás Pollak <tomas@forkhq.com> - (c) 2011 Fork Ltd.\n# License: GPLv3\n####################################################################\n\nset -e\n\nVERSION='1.3.8'\nBASE_PATH=\"/usr/lib/prey\"\nINSTALL_PATH=\"${BASE_PATH}/versions/${VERSION}\"\nPREY_BIN=\"bin/prey\"\nPREY_USER=\"prey\"\nTEMP_OLD_CONFIG=\"/tmp/prey-config.old\"\n\nget_current_user() {\n  export PS_FORMAT=user:16,command\n  ps ax | grep ssh-agent | grep -v grep | cut -d' ' -f1 | head -1\n}\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n  configure)\n\n    if [ -d /usr/share/prey ]; then\n      echo \"Previous installation found.

It will never appear in the Ubuntu Software Center, as that is for traditional Debian packaged applications. Apps packaged as clicks will appear in the click store scope in Unity8.\nIf you wish to ship your application in Ubuntu Software Center, you will need to create a traditional Debian package, following the guidelines on the developer site.

It should be noted that the command sudo apt-get install grive in the linked answer is correct because after adding the PPA it will indeed install grive2 that works instead of the old not upgraded version of grive that doesn't work anymore.\n\nA: You can use the grive2 package From GitHub \nInstallation\nsudo apt-get install git cmake build-essential libgcrypt11-dev libyajl-dev libboost-all-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libexpat1-dev libcppunit-dev binutils-dev\n\nI also needed these, which are not listed on the github page of the package.\nsudo apt-get install debhelper pkg-config zlib1g-dev\n\nAlso this didn't work:\ndpkg-buildpackage -j4 \n\nI got this error: \ndpkg-buildpackage: error: failed to sign .dsc and .changes file\n\nThis worked instead:\nsudo dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us\n\nOr the manual build worked also:\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nmake -j4\nsudo make install\n\nUsage\nTo sync, you must run the program manually (there is no «real-time watching» yet).

As of around 9AM PST we stopped serving these API requests. This is why the Grive client is receiving '400 Bad Request' responses.\nLooking at the project, it appears to be unmaintained for almost a year and definitely hasn't been updated (here & here) to the new API that was released in 2012 when Documents List was officially deprecated.\n\nA: try this https://github.com/astrada/google-drive-ocamlfuse , it is slow somehow as it synchronize files immediately while you save , it is also converting google docs and sheets to open office formats ( odt & ods ) but in read-only mode ,\n\nA: That  might also be an alternative although I have only played with it a little so far\nhttp://rclone.org\nIt is open source, written in Go.

I tried to add ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa but cmakes  find_package(Qt5X11Extras REQUIRED) still fails. Where the heck does ubuntu hide the qt stuff?\n\nA: Are you sure you're talking about Ubuntu 12.04? Qt5 doesn't seem to be available in Ubuntu 12.04.\nIf you're talking about Ubuntu 14.04 or later, I think the package you want is named libqt5x11extras5-dev. Check if it's installed:\nsudo apt-get install libqt5x11extras5-dev\n\n\nUPDATE:\nQt X11 Extras was introduced in Qt 5.1, but the Ubuntu SDK team PPA (ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa), provides only Qt 5.0 for Ubuntu 12.04. After an extensive search, I failed to find a PPA that you could use. IMHO, you're left with 2 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall all Qt5 packages that you installed from PPA and install the latest Qt5 using the Qt Installer.\n\n*Upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04 (or later) and install libqt5x11extras5-dev.\n\n\n\nUPDATE 2:\nIf you're still interested, there's new PPAs by Stephan Binner with recent Qt versions for Precise and Trusty. In order to not mess with Qt system packages, they're installed in /opt so you'll have to inform the correct path (/opt/qtXX/include/QtX11Extras) to your build tool.\nExample: if you want x11extras from Qt 5.1, you could add the Qt 5.1.1 PPA:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:beineri/opt-qt511\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen install qt-latest and qt51x11extras:\nsudo apt-get install qt-latest qt51x11extras\n\nThe include files for x11extras will be in /opt/qt51/include/QtX11Extras.\n\nA: If you compile Qt5 on your own, you need to clone the git submodule qtx11extras.

Mount is telling you that it can't figure out what kind of filesystem it is ( which does not bode well for being able to access your filesystem at all ) and so it wants to you tell it with -t ntfs, but since it couldn't figure this out on its own, this likely won't work either because your filesystem is so damaged.

Shouldn't it do what I tell it to do despite what is set in Software & Updates? Or is it just designed this way?\nEdit\nA small edition to the question to clarify it a bit more, I don't want to receive graphical notifications about new available updates or releases or whatsoever, so in Software & Updates I set updates & notifications to Never because I'd like to do this via terminal and everything works except do-release-upgrade \n\nA: The do-release-upgrade command, the Update Manager, the Software Sources program and the Software Centre all share a few common libraries and  configuration files. \nThe particular aspect you are looking at (the next version of Ubuntu you wanted to be prompted for), is set in the file /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades.\nYou can edit it, and set the value of the Prompt option. Quoting the comments:\nDefault prompting behavior, valid options:\n\n never  - Never check for a new release.\n normal - Check to see if a new release is available.  If more than one new\n          release is found, the release upgrader will attempt to upgrade to\n          the release that immediately succeeds the currently-running\n          release.\n lts    - Check to see if a new LTS release is available.  The upgrader\n          will attempt to upgrade to the first LTS release available after\n          the currently-running one.  Note that this option should not be\n          used if the currently-running release is not itself an LTS\n          release, since in that case the upgrader won't be able to\n          determine if a newer release is available.\n\nBoth the GUI and the command line derive these settings (since eventually, they all end up using the Python class UpdateManager.Core.MetaRelease.MetaReleaseCore, in which:\n # some constants\n CONF = \"/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades\"\n CONF_METARELEASE = \"/etc/update-manager/meta-release\"\n\nAnd\nif parser.has_option(\"DEFAULT\", \"Prompt\"):\n    type = parser.get(\"DEFAULT\", \"Prompt\").lower()\n    if (type == \"never\" or type == \"no\"):\n        # nothing to do for this object\n        # FIXME: what about no longer supported?\n        self.downloaded.set()\n        return\n\nSo, this is how it has been coded, without any option to override the configuration file.\nTherefore, if you want to disable the GUI notification, but be able to use do-release-upgrade, you will have to edit the configuration file. This can be done easily enough (replacing lts with normal, if you prefer):\nsed -i.bak 's/^Prompt=.*$/Prompt=lts/' /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades\ndo-release-upgrade -c\nsed -i.bak 's/^Prompt=.*$/Prompt=never/' /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades\n\nNote that there seems to be a directory for extensible configuration  (/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades.d), but it seems to be unused as of now.\n\nA: This one is the best understandable explanation for me now e.g. when in Software & Updates --> Updates --> Notify me of a new Ubuntu version and set it to for long-term support versions then the output of do-release-upgrade -d will >= true, as do-release-upgrade -d stands for:\nCheck if upgrading to the latest devel (*development) release is possible\n\nThat would be >= (greater) release that you're currently running but not LTS release rather the one that is being developed (unstable).\nBut do-release-upgrade -c will >= false as it stands for:\nCheck only if a new distribution release is available\nand report the result via the exit code\n\nAnd that would be the LTS release (stable). And it will work only if there's greater LTS release available than you're currently running.\nBut if you set in Software & Updates --> Updates --> Notify me of a new Ubuntu version for any versions and that would mean for stable and unstable (devel) releases. Then both commands do-release-upgrade -d and do-release-upgrade -c or -c -d together will return positive. In this case -c can even be dropped as -d would make it work for both if any.\nAnd in a case if notifications set to Never both commands will return negative. That could even be called a blocking feature as if you won't be able to upgrade release to any new version using either -c or -d in do-release-upgrade command. I except this as it was designed this way probably.\nP.S.\n@muru's answer works for me even better than mine. Thanks :). But I'm also going to leave this one in a matter of iterest.\n", "Q: Experimenting boot issues Hi and thanks for your time\nI turn on my PC and i get this message in the screen \n\"GNU GRUB 0.97 Minimal bash-like line editing...\"\n\nFrom an Ubuntu live CD i installed boot-repair utility, i tried recommended repair without success, then i created a boot info summary in order to share it and get some help.

I was thinking if it is possible to make an script to send to a friend to fix some problems on his computer. I want to give executable permissions to a file so my friend just have to double-click in the file, something like this:\nhttps://github.com/fletom/ACLr8\nBut when I use the chmod a+x with my file and I send the file to my friend (in this case I send it to myself), he (I) cannot execute because the file has lost the +x permissions.\nIs there a way (there is, the man of the link is able to do it) to send a bash script with executable permissions just to double-click and execute it?\n\nA: \nNOTE: The question at the time addressed Email transfer (per comments from the OP on the question).  This answer is written to address that question as it was, in that email is the transfer method available here.\n\nWhen using email to transfer files between systems, you can't 'preserve' all the file permissions as you want them to be when just sending the file.  This is because it's a 'new download' that is a 'new file' created per the terms and requirements of the system policy for 'new file creation permissions' in the download location, on the download system, etc.  This is also because email protocols do not have any mechanisms to outwardly preserve the permissions from the source system.\nThe GitHub example you show will 'save' the permission states for the files as a part of the version control system.  Email doesn't have that mechanism.\n\nSince we've established that Email does not let you preserve file permissions as such, you need to evaluate other methods.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a tarball.  You can create a directory with the file in it, and create a tarball to hold the system.  When extracted on a Linux system, it will try and 'preserve' those permissions as things were when you zipped up the files.  tar -pczf name_of_your_archive.tar.gz /path/to/directory is the general command structure to use.  However, if they can't run tar xzf or similar on the other end, this won't work.\n\n*Use a Version Control System to hold the data, such as a GitHub repository.  You could create a github repository to hold the shell script, then have the other person clone it down to their system.  This should preserve the executable bit, but no guarantees.\n\n*Instruct the other user in how to set the executable bit via the command line.  If they download the file to /home/USERNAME/Downloads, where USERNAME is their username, you can then instruct them to login to the terminal and run chmod a+x /home/USERNAME/Downloads/FileName.sh, and then they can run it by double click or by the command line.\n\n*If email is the only transfer option, then run the script with the shell language you wrote it in (likely Bash, is my guess).   This won't need any changes to the permissions or the execute bit anywhere.  Assuming that this is a Bash script, then, simply have the remote user who downloaded the script execute the following (from the Command Line): bash /path/to/script.sh (and replace /path/to/script.sh with the actual file path, likely /home/USERNAME/Downloads or a default email download location or if downloaded via webmail in a web browser where USERNAME is the user's username)\nOther than the first three methods, which I am aware of, I don't believe you will be able to 'preserve' the permissions when sending the file to the other user.  This is a limitation of Email - it can't preserve permissions in that way, because there's no way to save the permissions as part of that file in a way that is preserved during the transport over email.  The fourth option gives a method to not even need the executable bit and not mess with permissions at all.\n", "Q: Creating Your Own Mount Point for USB Drive I have an external USB drive which is always plugged in. I have modified fstab and created a folder in media so that the drive is mounted at media/drive_name.

I would like to keep automount on for other devices, but for this specific one have my own mount point.

To fix this, you can try using boot-repair, which should bring GRUB back to the default.\n\nA: When using UEFI you should not add a non-Windows OS like Linux to Windows boot menu. \nIt makes no sense as Windows boot manager cannot (chain)load \"foreign\" systems using Windows UEFI boot manager.\nEvery installed system(Linux, Windows etc.) on UEFI firmware writes its UEFI boot related data in NVRAM. \nIt is UEFI firmware boot manager which starts a selected Linux/Windows UEFI boot manager/loader.\nTo sum up - boot menu entries for Linux/Windows dual/multi boot installations on UEFI are stored in NVRAM ! \nNote:\nWindows makes a copy of some common and some proprietary(Linux, Ubuntu) UEFI NVRAM variables to BCD and in system registry not belonging to Windows boot chain so you can really chain load Linux from Windows BUT using UEFI firmware boot manager - see BootNext utility)\n", "Q: When one disables the root account via the terminal, what output can one expect?

And what will the terminal say when I disable the account (here, the terminal said passwd: password expiry information changed).\nThank you guys for helping me.\n\nA: I'm going to say that, if you try to disable the root account when it's not enabled, Ubuntu will just tell you so and exit. I think that's what you're asking.\n\nA: When you try to disable the root account but it is already disabled, passwd does not inform you that the root account was already disabled. But this is not a problem.\npasswd: password expiry information changed. is the expected output of a successful run of passwd -dl root, even if the root password is already disabled. As muru says, passwd commands that change something will produce this output if they were able to write to the password database (which is usually /etc/shadow).\npasswd was able to write the entry successfully. That it wrote the same thing that was already there doesn't mean it wasn't successful.\nWhen passwd does fail, then you'll get another message reporting the error.

Could anyone help me?\n\nA: You cannot have both private IPs and public IPs with a home network existing with more than one host on the network.  Once you have added a router into your network, the most common IP addresses you will get usually start with 192.168.1.x or 192.168.0.x.  The public IP is supplied by your ISP.  If your computer is getting the public IP address there is the possibility that your MAC address of your network card maybe exposed to their service via being located in a DMZ through the firewall of your router, or you have a modem that is connected directly to your computer that is doing bridging.\nMore information about Public vs Private IP Addresses:  https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc958825.aspx\nOne thing that I mean by a modem being connected directly to your computer doing bridging, is that DSL Modems can support RFC 1483 Transparent bridging.  When the DSL modem is set to RFC 1483, the public IP is then passed to the next network device.  The DSL modem is now only used for the DSL handshake connection.  The login information is now handled by the next network device whether it be a router or the computer itself.  \n", "Q: How do you make your terminal play a sound or offer a notification when it has finished executing its command? I do sudo apt-get update from time to time, and find it frustrating to have to check when it is done doing its thing. Is there anyway I can get it to offer a notification popup or play a sound when it has finished executing, so I can get on with my work?\n\nA: What you want is sudo apt-get update; alert. What follows is explanation and rationale.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*From the terminal, you can list many commands to be run in sequence. So what you want is first the command which takes a long time, and second a notification command.\n\n*To run commands in sequence, you separate them with either && or ;. These have two distinct meanings: command-a && command-b means that command-a will run first, and then, if it was successful, command-b will run; command-a; command-b means that command-a will run first and then command-b will run, whether or not command-a was successful. You probably want the semi-colon: you want to be notified when the update or upgrade has stopped running, whether or not it has exited successfully.\n\n*Other answerers have given you suggested audio and on-screen alerts. My own preference is for notify-send, which takes two parameters: a title and content: sudo apt-get update; notify-send update finished (if either parameter contains spaces, enclose them in quotation marks).\n\n*Much quicker and easier to type than notify-send title content is alert. This alias is built into bash by default in at least some versions of Ubuntu, and is easy enough to add if it’s missing from yours (use type alert to check whether it’s present). You should get the response,\nalert is aliased to `notify-send --urgency=low -i \"$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)\" \"$(history|tail -n1|sed -e 's/^\\s*[0-9]\\+\\s*//;s/[;&|]\\s*alert$//')\"'\n\nThis means that it will simply pull out the last command and send it to notify-send, and that the accompanying icon will be an image of a terminal (for a successful command) or an error image (for a failed command).\nLife has now become even simpler: command; alert is very quick and easy to type.

I was taking a look at the game DEFCON, and it froze my PC. Unfortunately, I only discovered the REISUB thing after a cold reboot.\nNow, what harm the cold reboot caused into my computer? Any type of hardware harm, or software or security harm?\nIn my case, I only had Steam, the game and the system log open.\n\nA: When a computer is shut off or loses power unexpectedly, it has no chance to finish writing data on its drives, that was only about to be written there. This can leave files and file systems in an inconsistent state.\nFile System Integrity\nModern file systems like ext4 (the default in Ubuntu), NTFS (default in Windows), and HPFS+ (default in OS X) can (almost) fully mitigate the risk of file system corruption, by writing a journal onto the disk, that lets them revert or complete the partial changes leading to inconsistencies. There's one popular file system still in wide use without this capability: FAT32 (or even FAT16 and FAT12).\nAt each boot Ubuntu verifies automatically, that there are no half-finished actions written to journals of file system mounted during boot (with an entry in /etc/fstab), and fixes all such journal entries. File systems mounted manually at a later time cannot be mounted normally, if they contain such journal entries, until they are fixed.\nFile Integrity\nWhat a file system journal doesn't (normally) protect against, is applications writing incomplete data, because they were interrupted at shut-off. While the file system can be restored to consistency, such an application may have partially overwritten a file or multiple files, so they now contain half of the previous and half of the new state, which typically leaves them unusable or flawed. This is especially problematic, if such a file has an important role in the operating system or an essential program. In such a case one must often resort to a minimal recovery environment or a live DVD/USB medium to re-install the packages with the affected file.\nTo detect file corruption in less critical, less noticeable packages, you can have the system verify their integrity on a regular basis with debsums.\n\nA: If you are referring to holding down the power button or unplugging the cord I know on windows computers it can corrupt your files espiclly .dll files i wouldn't make a habit of it I've done It on Ubuntu a few times and haven't seen any issues here's what you can do if a game becomes unresponsive \nCtrl alt and f1\nSign in \nHtop\nFind the game and kill it (f9)\nCtrl alt f7 to get back to GUI \nIf you don't have htop use \n     Sudo apt-get install htop\n\nI hope this helps you :)\n", "Q: Gparted Error \"Unable to satisfy all the constraints on the partition\" I have dual booted Windows 7 & Ubuntu 14.04 with EasyBCD, i.e. I have installed grub on the Ubuntu root partition & added entry of linux to Windows bootloader using EasyBCD.\nSo effectively i am using Windows Bootloader to boot into either of them.

In the case of your /dev/sda6 and /dev/sda7, though, there's no gap between those two partition. This is legal, provided the EBR can be tucked away somewhere else. (sfdisk can do this, for instance.) It's possible that libparted (upon which parted, GParted, and several other tools are based) is becoming confused by this. I've not tested how libparted reacts to such disks, though, so I can't be sure that my guess is right.\nIf this is the problem, then I can think of at least two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using any tool that will enable you to do so, delete /dev/sda7. It's swap space, so it doesn't hold any critical data. You can re-create it later, with a gap between it and /dev/sda6. When you re-create your swap partition, you'll probably have to edit /etc/fstab to point to the new swap space.\n\n*You've got one free primary partition, so you can use FixParts (part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu) or the EaseUS tool you used initially to convert /dev/sda7 into a primary partition. Primary partitions don't need EBRs, so the problem should then go away. This method has the advantage that you won't need to edit /etc/fstab, but you'll also have no free primary partitions. If you really want your swap to be on a logical partition, you can shrink either partition by 1MiB, which will open up enough of a gap that you'll be able to convert back and have it work.\n\n", "Q: How to broadcast a folder in network of class B network?

Any misconception?\n\nA: Your first to third points seem alright, although stdin, stdout and stderr are still bound to the terminal is not a right notion. stdin is always bound to terminal in the sense that you would always input the file name to a command via terminal or ways using terminal. stdout and stderr are still bound to the terminal is alright.\nYour have stdin, stdout and stderr are not still bound to the terminal in the fourth point which is not right as mentioned in my earlier paragraph. Also here you are using /dev/null as the input file to the command, for example if the command is cat, you are using it as cat /dev/null. \nThe command on your 5th point is not correctly put, you used nohup <command> & disown, while using any one of nohup or disown the other one is not needed. Their purposes are the same (to ignore the SIGHUP) but they function in a bit different way. So the command can be simplified as nohup <command> &.\n\nA: Your understanding is basically correct. Both disown and nohup are used to allow you to exit a running shell session without stopping running jobs. Some clarifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's no reason to run nohup command & disown, nohup will already disown it for you.\n\n*nohup is defined by POSIX while disown is not. This means that while many shells (e.g. bash, zsh, ksh) have it, others (for example tcsh, csh, dash and sh) won't have it. \n\n*disown can be used after a command has been launched while nohup must be used before. \nAs far as I can tell, the actual effect of the two commands is the same. They each have features that the other lacks (see help disown and man nohup) but their basic function is the same, yes.\nFor a far more detailed discussion of these tools and the differences between them, have a look at the answers here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do disown -h and nohup work effectively the same?\n\n*Difference between nohup, disown and &\n", "Q: How to improve Ubuntu 14.04 LTS boot time on a laptop?

So I don't know that does e4rat work with Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: If you got the HDD version of the laptop this could be a IO thing, as im aware the HDD only has 5400rpm.\nYou might as well check the autostart applications and remove unnecessary software.\nSince unity is probably demanding to your hardware, you could try the slim XCFE , LXDE or any other performance oriented desktop environment.\nThere are also ubuntu based distros which come with those out of the box.\nXubuntu http://xubuntu.org\nLubuntu http://lubuntu.net\nYou can also install and replace the desktop environment from the commandline/window manager/packet manager.\n\nA: If you have a standard spinning harddrive, E4rat can improve the loading of your system. Link to how to install it-\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/69753/how-to-cut-your-linux-pcs-boot-time-in-half-with-e4rat/?PageSpeed=noscript\nAlso, if you are not using btrfs, this can delay your bootup by several seconds. You can safely uninstall btrfs-tools.\nsudo apt-get purge btrfs-tools\n\n", "Q: Can I emulate graphical DOS applications inside a TTY? Can I play DOS games inside a hard terminal (like the ones that open with Control+Alt+F1)?\nI want to be able to close the Xsession because the PC I'm doing this is on is really slow. The PC has enough power to run Xubuntu and a dos emulator on it but I'd just like to learn if there is a way to play games with just a plain terminal.\n\nA: Sure, with dosbox; enable the universe repository in Software & Updates then search it within Ubuntu Software Center, or run this command in a Terminal:\nsudo apt-get install dosbox\n\nThen switch to a TTY with, e.g. Ctrl+Alt+F1 and run it with this command:\ndosbox\n\n", "Q: How to register an upstart service? I wrote an upstart service following the Ubuntu wiki article and created a .conf file in /etc/init/. There're no instructions on how to proceed to make the script available in initctl list and for upstart management commands, like start and service. The official upstart cookbook doesn't explain this matter.\nThe start fails with\n$ start archiva\nstart: Unknown job: archiva\n$ service archiva start\narchiva: unrecognized service\n\n\nA: Probably there are some errors in you conf file. To verify it use:\n init-checkconf archiva.conf\n\nor\ninitctl check-config archiva\n\nas described in upstart cookbook: 10.1.6.2   initctl check-config and 10.1.7   init-checkconf.\nUpstart use init daemon that, according to man page:\n\nOn startup, the Upstart init(8) daemon reads its job configuration\n  from files  in  the  /etc/init/ directory, and watches for future\n  changes to these files using inotify(7).\n\nSo, once you place your configuration file in /etc/init, your service is enabled and on the next reboot the init daemon will start it.\n\nA: Upstart uses inotify. If you drop a configuration file into /etc/init/, Upstart should detect and make the job available automatically. If you don't see it appear, there may be a problem in your new configuration. Try checking the logs for errors.\n\nA: Defining a variable in the /etc/init/scriptname.conf file in the form of NAME=value like you'd do in an initd script causes upstart to give this rather nonsense feedback (telling that there's a syntax error is much more suitable than saying that the script doesn't exist). Removing the line causes the script to be recognized and startable randomly (see my suggested improvement as bug 1446577 on launchpad.net for details).\n", "Q: Display problems in ubuntu 15.04 I have recently updated Ubuntu from 14.10 to 15.04.

Verisign has provided me two crt files IntermediateCA and ssl_certificate.  Can somebody tell me how can I install \nI also want to add full URL to my apache how can I do that.\nHope somebody can give me reply.\n\nA: Thank you very much for @gertvdijk pointing me to right direction. As I told you I had generated CSR from windows server and also certificate was install on windows server. So I did as below \n\n\n*\n\n*I exported my certificate to pfx file \n\n*Then copied pfx file Ubuntu server\n\n*Then I use this command openssl pkcs12 -in file.pfx -out file.pem\n\n*When this step is complete, I have a PEM file that I can read in a text editor. Open the file in a text editor and copy the private key and certificate to different files. Remember to keep the dashed lines intact when you copy the certificates – this is important. There is some additional text above the key, and also between the key and certificate – this text should be ignored and should not be included in the certificate and key files.\n\n*Now that I have the key and certificate separated, I need to decrypt the private key (or face the wrath of Apache every time you restart the server). You can decrypt the private key like this:\nopenssl rsa -in file.key -out file.key\n\n*Then I make directory by sudo mkdir /etc/apache2/ssl\n\n*Copied my SSL, PrivateKey and Intermidate crt files in that directory\n\n*Then I add this in my configuration file\n\n\n\n", "Q: How to use double substitution in awk? To print the fields at 29th column in two files I used\npaste <(awk -F, '{print $29}' PreRefFile.csv) <(awk -F, '{print $29}' Txlog.csv)\n\nThis worked fine.\nTo print all the fields starting from 29 to 189. I wrote a script as follows\n y=29\n while [ $y -le 189 ]\n do\n   x=\"\\$$y\"\n   paste <(awk -F, '{print \"'\"$x\"'\"}' PreRefFile.csv) <(awk -F, '{print \"'\"$x\"'\"}' Txlog.csv)\n   y=`expr $y + 1`\n done\n\nHere the value of x is replaced by \"$\" followed by number (First round of substitution) and it is printing \"$\" follwed by that number instead of printing the field at that location. How to get that field in this way.\nI cannot write the same line for so many times. Suggest a method to proceed.\nAlso suggest another tool to do this, other than awk\n\nA: All what you need is the power of awk and a for Statement:\npaste <(awk -F, '{ for (i=29;i<=188; i++) print $i }' PreRefFile.csv) <(awk -F, '{ for (i= 29;i<= 188;i++) print $i }' Txlog.csv)\n\nMy test case:\npaste <(awk -F, '{ for (i=2;i<=3;i++) print $i }' foo1) <(awk -F, '{ for (i=2;i<=3;i++) print $i }' foo2)\n\nFile foo1:\n1,2,3,4,5,6\n7,8,9,10,11,12\n\nFile foo2:\na,b,c,d,e,f,g\nA,B,C,D,E,F,G\n\nOutput:\n2   b\n3   c\n8   B\n9   C\n\n\nA: The variable you set x=\"\\$$y\" is not available in the subshells <(...). Thats the problem. Use export to make it available in subsequently executed commands, but it will anyway be expanded by the parent shell. The subshells never see the variable, but instead see the value the parent shell substituted for it. As @EliahKagan noticed in the comments.\nAlso your awk can be a bit simpler. See the example (I used echo to simulate a file with 2 fields):\nx=2\npaste <(echo \"a1,a2\" | awk -F, '{print $'$x'}' ) <(echo \"b1,b2\" | awk -F, '{print $'$x'}')\n\nThe output would then be:\na2      b2\n\n\nA: Using bash:\n#!/bin/bash\npaste PreRefFile.csv Txlog.csv | while IFS=$'\\t' read a b; do\n  i=29\n  while [[ $i -le 189 ]]; do\n    printf \"$(cut -d, -f$i<<<\"$a\")\\t$(cut -d, -f$i<<<\"$b\")\\n\"\n    i=$((i+1))\n  done\ndone\n\nUsing python:\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\nimport csv, itertools\nwith open('PreRefFile.csv') as a, open('PreRefFile.csv') as b:\n    for i, j in itertools.izip_longest(csv.reader(a), csv.reader(b)):\n        check = 28\n        while check <= 188:\n            print i[check] + '\\t' + j[check]\n            check += 1\n\n", "Q: Install programs from terminal i am a newbie to linux!i am having a trouble to install adobe flash player plugin! can any one please tell me how to install it clearly? \nMany thanks in advance!\n\nA: Open terminal and type: \nsudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer\n\nThis will install flash\nEDIT: For chrome: \n sudo apt-get install pepperflashplugin-nonfree \n\n", "Q: How to login from terminal using launchpad.net credentials?

Now I decided to refuse of LVM usage. Can I disable LVM and reformat filesystem so that regular file system will be used?\n\nA: That's actually easier than you'd think: If you have a spare-partition or -harddisk around that is at least the size of the logical volume that you'd like to convert to a partition, you can easily do this with dd. \nImagine that /dev/vg/volume is a logical volume that consists of only one partition, /dev/sday:\n# dd if=/dev/vg/volume of=/dev/sdbx bs=8M\n# dd if=/dev/sdbx of=/dev/sday bs=8M\n\nThat's it. This will back up the logical, continuous data that's hosted on the lvm to a partition. After the first dd you'll be able to mount /dev/sdbx and see how the content of /dev/vg/volume has been copied.\ncheck the source\n", "Q: Install linux package in iso into ubuntu here I want to ask, I am familiar with ubuntu, with unity, shortcuts, etc.\nI have learned about Kali linux, I have installed Kali linux in my PC but I am not familiar with the environment,\nI've had Kali linux Iso,\nMy Laptops is installed Ubuntu LTS 12.04,\nCan I install a Kali Linux Package from iso into my ubuntu,\n\nA: Supposing that you want to keep Ubuntu OS, you can install Kali linux within Ubuntu with a virtual machine (VirtualBox, etc), or you can create another partition and install Kali linux in that partition, so you can dual boot either to Ubuntu or Kali linux when you start the machine.\n", "Q: Ubuntu MAAS node deployment I'm running ubuntu maas 1.7 and I have a node deployment problem.\nI use one physical server and an VM as node for deployment.\nNodes commissioning and provisionning goes well, but when I prepare\nmy node for ubuntu installation (juju charm is configured), my nodes boot\nbut I can see in boot sequence that the image loaded by the PXE is unable \nto find / partition on my server and on my system.\nAny idea of how I can solve this ?\nThanks\n\nA: A few things to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Verify that MAAS has the images you want to deploy in terms of Ubuntu releases and architecture.\n\n*Verify that your VM has a big enough disk for an Ubuntu installation (say, give it 10G)\n\n*Verify in MAAS that the node (VM) hardware is correct, i.e., that MAAS discovered the hardware correctly specially regarding the disk.\n\n*I don't remember if virt-io for disks is supported, so if you have that in your VM, try switching to SCSI or SATA (and recommission or even re-enlist so the new hardware is detected).\n\n*Check in the MAAS server logs if there is something fishy (/var/log/maas/*.log) during the boot. Maybe it's not finding the right image and that's the right failure.\n\n\nIf you change the hardware of the VM, don't forget to recommission, or even re-enlist if you suspect it wasn't updated in MAAS.\nOther than that, you will need to supply some logs or screenshots.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Have Unattended-Upgrade perform check before restarting Unattended-Upgrade upgrades and restarts my machine without any issues. However, I have a python script that runs infrequently, but when it runs it may take days to complete.

Make sure it is enabled.\n\n*Go to the Corners / Edges tab and change the Corner options to their corresponding corners.\n\n\nA: You can use tmux, a terminal multiplexer.\nsudo apt-get install tmux\n\nFor four panels you can use this script 4pSession, create the script with\nmkdir -p ~/bin\ntouch ~/bin/4pSession\nchmod +x ~/bin/4pSession\nnano ~/bin/4pSession\n\nand add the code below\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n# if the session is already running, just attach to it.\ntmux has-session -t 4panel\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n  sleep 1\n  tmux attach -t 4panel\nelse \n  tmux new-session -d -s 4panel\n  tmux split-window -v\n  tmux split-window -h\n  tmux select-pane -t 0\n  tmux split-window -h\n  tmux select-pane -t 0\n  tmux -2 attach-session -d\nfi\n\nThan you can create a desktop file:\nnano ~/.local/share/applications/tmux.desktop\n\nwith this content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=tmux\nComment=a terminal multiplexer\nExec=/<path_to_script>/4pSession\nIcon=terminal\nTerminal=true\nType=Application\nCategories=Terminal;\n\nMove between the panes with Ctrl+B and than → or ← or ↑ or ↓\n\n\nA: You can start 4 Terminals with Ctrl+Alt+T and fit them to the edges of your screen with Ctrl+Alt+Numpad[1,3,7,9] or left/right with Ctrl+Alt+Numpad[4/6] or top/bottom Ctrl+Alt+Numpad[8/2] and switch with Alt+Tab to ONE Terminal and with Alt+key above Tab between the terminals if one is active.\nOr\nYou can use tabs with Ctrl+Shift+T and switch between the terminals with Alt+Page-Up/Page-Down.\n\nA: You need Terminator:\nsudo apt-get install terminator\n\n\nFor four terminals at start-up, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start terminator\n\n*Split the terminal Ctrl+Shift+O\n\n*Split the upper terminal Ctrl+Shift+O\n\n*Split the lower terminal Ctrl+Shift+O\n\n*Open Preferences and select Layouts\n\n*Click Add and enter a usefull layout name and Enter\n\n*Close Preferences and Terminator\n\n*Open Terminator with this command:\nterminator --maximise --layout=<your_layout_name>\n\nor with this command:\nterminator --maximise --borderless --layout=<your_layout_name>\n\n\nJump between the terminal windows with Ctrl+Tab.\nYou can assign your personal terminator command to Ctrl+Alt+T in Keyboard Settings > Shortcuts. (Thx @Wilf)\nOf course you can also create a terminator.desktop file. Copy the original desktop file and make your changes:\ncp /usr/share/applications/terminator.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/\nnano ~/.local/share/applications/terminator.desktop\n\n\nA: As another alternative, I would suggest using byobu.\n\nByobu is a GPLv3 open source text-based window manager and terminal multiplexer. It was originally designed to provide elegant enhancements to the otherwise functional, plain, practical GNU Screen, for the Ubuntu server distribution. Byobu now includes an enhanced profiles, convenient keybindings, configuration utilities, and toggle-able system status notifications for both the GNU Screen window manager and the more modern Tmux terminal multiplexer, and works on most Linux, BSD, and Mac distributions.\n\nThe advantage is that it is text-based, meaning you can use it without a graphical environment! This is very useful when dealing with servers, which often don't have a GUI.\nYou even have a bottom status bar with a lot of useful information, like the date/time, the load average, etc.\nThe shortcuts you have to know if you use Byobu are:\n\n\n*\n\n*F2 creates a new tab.\n\n*Shift+F2 creates a new split tab (this splits your current tab horizontally).\n\n*F3 and F4 to switch between tabs.\n\n*F9 to configure Byobu.\n\n\nsudo apt-get install byobu will install Byobu.\nAs a bonus, being a terminal multiplexer, it means you won't lose your session and your tabs if you closed the terminal by mistake. And you can run byobu in another terminal and get synchronised outputs.\nThere are even scripts to save the layouts if you wish to persist the session across reboots.\n\nA: Personally, I use emacs with M-x ansi-term or M-x shell depending on what I am doing.\nBut if you are looking for just a terminal multiplexer then there is always the quietly revered tmux:\nhttps://github.com/tmux/tmux\nEdit: JoKeR pointed out that you can install tmux with apt-get:\n$ sudo apt-get install tmux\n\n\nA: My crude contribution to this question: install wmctrl and adjust the script bellow,that opens and positions four terminal windows, to your screen. \nFirst  find out the size of your screen with xwininfo -root and then adjust -e parameters (they are in this order 0,x-position,y-position,width,height). Numbers I use bellow are just example\n#!/bin/bash\n# Author: Serg Kolo\n# Date: 2/18/2015\n# Description: Open 4 terminals and position them\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngnome-terminal -t WINDOW-ONE &\ngnome-terminal -t WINDOW-TWO &\ngnome-terminal -t WINDOW-THREE &\ngnome-terminal -t WINDOW-FOUR &\n\nsleep 0.5\nwmctrl -r WINDOW-ONE -e 0,0,0,500,250 &\nsleep 0.5\nwmctrl -r WINDOW-TWO -e 0,0,384,500,250 &\nsleep 0.5\nwmctrl -r WINDOW-THREE -e 0,500,0,500,250 &\nsleep 0.5\nwmctrl -r WINDOW-FOUR -e 0,500,384,500,250 &\n\nYou could bind this as a shortcut, for instance to Ctrl+I or whatever. Another idea, without installing wmctrl, is to open 4 --geometry= option\n\nA: I would strongly recommend tmux. It offers a whole lot of customizations and total independence from the mouse (if that is concern). You can split screens horizontally, vertically, switch between them with some keystrokes, leave sessions open and reconnect to them later, etc.\n\nA: With 4 terminal windows open, and while working in one of them, I can simply switch among them with Alt+` (left tick) if want to use keyboard, or simply click on the launcher icon of the terminal to bring up all its windows and click on the chosen one.  \n\nMy installation is Ubuntu 14.04, with the default (Unity 3D) desktop, and updated to-date.  \nI don't get it why people complicate things and install 3rd party products when the default Ubuntu installation already provides the feature.  \n\nA: you can use Gnu Screen for this also, and use a vertical split, and horizontal split.  \nyou can put these in your ~/.screenrc config file.  I have been able to split using most any gnu screen, with proper adjustments to .screenrc file.\nSome combo of below should do you in your .screenrc. \nscreen -t tl 1 bash\nsplit \nfocus down\nscreen -t bl 3 bash\nsplit -v\nfocus down\nscreen -t br 4 bash\nselect 1\nsplit -v\nfocus down\nscreen -t tr 2 bash\n\nI had it set for 6 screen once. heres my residual config from that\n 30 ## 1 a local bash\n 31 # screen -t host03 1 bash\n 32 #sessinoname blamb1\n 33\n 34 ## 2 ssh to host04\n 35 # split -v\n 36 # focus\n 37 # select 2\n 38 # resize -6\n 39 # screen -t host04 2 ssh host04\n 40 # caption string \"%{kk}XXXXXXX\"\n 41\n 42 ## 3 bashed\n 43 # focus\n 44 # select 1\n 45 # split\n 46 # focus\n 47 # select 3\n 48 # screen -t bashed 3  bash\n 49 #exec ssh host04\n 50 # caption string \"%{kk}XXXXXXX\"\n 51\n 52 ## 4 bashedup\n 53 # split\n 54 # focus down\n 55 # screen -t bashedup 4 bash\n 56 # caption string \"%{kk}XXXXXXX\"\n 57\n 58 ## 5 compass\n 59 # split\n 60 # focus down\n 61 # resize -14\n 62 # screen -t compass 5 bash\n 63 # leave caption commented till resize works\n 64 #caption string \"%{kk}XXXXXXX\"\n 65\n 66 #focus up\n 67\n 68\n 69 ## 5mysql\n 70 # exec mysql -p\n 71 # screen -t mysql 5 mysql\n 72\n 73 ## 6php\n 74 # screen -t php.ini 6 vim /etc/php/php.ini\n 75 # select php.ini\n 76 # chdir /etc/php\n 77 # exec vim php.ini\n\n\nA: you can use the application \"screen\"\nInstall screen by running the following command:\napt-get install screen\n\nTo verify that screen has been installed, run \nscreen -v\n\nwithin a screen session, you can create a new window by pressing CTRL + A, then C.

I heard that while installing via USB (or Live CD), all files are loaded into ramdisk? And as far as I know, ramdisk is just RAM that behave as HDD.\nMy RAM is 4GB and ubuntu installation media is just (more or less) 1 GB. So basically, if all the files are loaded to RAM, RAM still have 3 GB to be used as actual RAM. So, is it save (or possible) to unplug Installation media while installing?\n\nA: Not all of the information is loaded into RAM.

Even if everything gets copied to RAM (which is highly unlikely), There is always going to be a time when the installation reads from the media. I have observed my USB stick flashing during the installation, so even if it's not copying anything, it might be reading certain files (ones that don't get installed).

That means that in my system /dev/zero can generate up to 16,1 GB/s of zeros, so it definetly should be fast enough for your purpose.\n\nA: Not always.  I was recently testing a disk in exactly the same way and /dev/zero tricked me into thinking I had the performance I needed because the external disk was using NTFS disk compression.  At first I tried using /dev/urandom to fix this problem, but I discovered that tricked me into thinking that things were going too slowly.  If you want to do this without being tricked then you need to write a random file to a tmpfs location and copy that file to the destination disk.\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/temp-random.img bs=1G count=1 iflag=fullblock oflag=dsync\ndd if=/tmp/temp-random.img of=/path/to/device/temp-random.img bs=1G count=1 iflag=fullblock oflag=dsync\n\nPlease note that this assumes that /tmp is mounted as tmpfs, if that's not the case then you should mount a temporary filesystem and use that instead:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/tmp\nsudo mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt/tmp/\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=/mnt/tmp/temp-random.img bs=1G count=1 iflag=fullblock oflag=dsync\ndd if=/mnt/tmp/temp-random.img of=/path/to/device/temp-random.img bs=1G count=1 iflag=fullblock oflag=dsync\nsudo umount /mnt/tmp/\nsudo rmdir /mnt/tmp\n\nAlso note that you need to make sure that your file is large enough to be bigger than the cache of the disk (set count=N much bigger than the cache size in GiB).\n\nA: Perhaps /dev/zero isn't a realistic source; stable but not realistic. You'll get maybe the fastest rate, but IRL the information isn't usually that organized. In order to check this, run a couple of tests using /dev/zero and /dev/urandom and compare the rates. Another point you must take into account is the bs parameter. If you don't optimize this value, the precision will be poor once again. The optimal size depends on a number of factors (i.e. the SO, the architecture, some characteristics of the device you're writing on,...). I've just run this test against my SSD; just ten seconds of writing:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=./output_file \n2968447+0 records in\n2968447+0 records out\n1519844864 bytes (1,5 GB, 1,4 GiB) copied, 8,52739 s, 178 MB/s\n\ndd if=/dev/zero of=./output_file bs=4096\n942211+0 records in\n942211+0 records out\n3859296256 bytes (3,9 GB, 3,6 GiB) copied, 17,3544 s, 222 MB/s\n\nSo, 4096 looks a good block size in my hardware but I needed to run a long battery of tests in order to determine it.

I have the MacBook12,1 model. When I attempt to run the installer, I see the usual GUI but every window contains no text. I've tried both USB and CDs as a means of installing Ubuntu with the same results. I have the same symptoms when I run the trial version as well. Is there a compatibility issue with the newer MacBooks and 14.04 and 14.10 versions when it comes to fonts? I've tried Googling and searched several forums but it seems I can't find anyone with this problem. I've never seen this before installing Ubuntu an any machine. Any help is appreciated. :)\n\n\nA: I tried version 15.04 and all appears to be well now. I suppose that 14.04 and 14.10 is not entirely compatible with the latest MacBook models. \n\nA: For what it's worth, I had the exact same thing happen to me when installing 15.04 on my desktop. No text on the GUI installer. It was really annoying to figure out what was going wrong. \nTurns out the noveau driver was doing weird things so I had to manually append \"nomodeset\" in the boot options.\nSolution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit Spacebar on first purple screen when booting from the installer. This will take you to some extra installer options.\n\n*Highlight \"Install Ubuntu\" by using your arrow keys.\n\n*Add \"nomodeset\" to the Boot options command line (I added it at the end before the \"--\")\n\n*Hit Enter to start the installer without mode setting.\n\n\nIf this worked you should see the Ubuntu splash screen start in a low-res mode.\nNOTE: I had to manually append \"nomodeset\". There is an F6 menu that can select nomodeset too but that did not work for me.\n", "Q: Firewall Ports for Filesharing With OSX I tried searching for this but I'm coming up short. Maybe my wording is wrong.\nI have my Ubuntu machine showing on my LAN - and I can see it from the Finder Window in OSX - but it won't connect when my firewall on Ubuntu is running. Of course, I want this on and running at all times. What are the ports I need to open up to accept the incoming traffic for file sharing? \n\nA: For some reason I don't see an option to add a comment on my iPhone using the StackExchange app, so I'll offer an answer that finally worked for me. I gave up on trying to configure Samba, it never worked, ever. What does work is BitTorrent Sync 2.0 and it is fast, it costs money though, I'm fine with that, it is absolutely the easiest and fastest way to share files between OS X and Ubuntu\n\nA: 5353 UDP - Multicast DNS - (mdns) is the answer here.

It's a 4tb WD green which was formatted using a GPT table and as ext4 less than 8 months ago, but now, it seems like it's lost.\nsudo blkid and sudo fdisk -l both yield nothing more than a list of existing, working drives - the problematic drive is definitely not listed.\nI've tried putting the drive in a SATA connected hot swap trayless drive alongside the others and it doesn't show up whatsoever, under any command.\nHowever, running ls /dev/ | grep sd before attaching the drive in an external USB caddy, gives me all disks, but running it after shows an extra disk /dev/sdg, but with no partition (ie. there is no /dev/sdg1). Trying to mount the disk reports bad superblock, or words to that effect.\nSo I looked to Tesdisk to help me out, but when I run sudo testdisk, it fails to show the USB attached disk (/dev/sdg), it shows all the other disks available to me. I've used testdisk before and got great results, but it doesn't seem to like this scenario. Am I doing something wrong?\nI've searched for days now for a solution and this is my last resort, is there anything I can do or should I reluctantly give up on the drive?

This was after the POST beep. That was not a good idea... now, POST takes very long to finish, and when booting, Ubuntu says \"gave up waiting for boot device\" and something like \"ALERT! /something/ubuntu--vg-mapper does not exist. Dropping to shell!\" (I forgot the exact file name), although typing \"exit\" in the shell will continue booting normally. My data (secondary) hard drive is also gone from the list! I think it's broken, but it does spin up after power on.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Thanks to @Zacharee1 for helping me with this one.\nFour simple steps to solve this (make sure the power is OFF before doing this!):\n\n\n*\n\n*Pull out the power cord. On a phone, remove the battery.\n\n*Press the power button. The power led will likely turn on and briefly after that turn back off.\n\n*Put the cord or battery back in.\n\n*Turn the power back on, and everything should work again.\n\n\nWhat you just did is reset your PC/phone. It means that all volatile memories (such as the RAM or BIOS cache) that may possibly have retained some bad data will be reset, although any non-volatile memories such as your hard drive will be unaffected, so don't worry.\nYou may have to boot into the system once more for it to fully fix the problem. After that, the next boot will succeed normally.\nAlso, don't forget to go back into the BIOS setup after doing this, as many settings will reset to factory defaults when you power cycle a device. Usually, the time will remain in order, unless you took so long that the battery that powers the clock will have died. But that takes several months.\n", "Q: Non-Free Module for P7zip (p7zip-rar) I've installed P7zip from the Ubuntu Software Center. Under \"Optional add-ons\" I see a non-free rar module. Is this add-on a trial only? If so, how can I buy the full version?\n\nA: Free as in speech, not free as in beer. The principle license of the rar module is the unRAR license. From the copyright:\n\nFiles in folders  \nCPP/7zip/Compress/Rar/   \n\nare licensed under \"unRAR license + GNU LGPL\" license.\n\"unRAR license + GNU LGPL\" means that you must follow  GNU LGPL in all\n  aspects while it is in agreement  with unRAR license. But you can not\n  break unRAR license rules. It means that unRAR license is main license\n  in that pair.\n\nThe unRAR license is not a free licence, hence the module is non-free.

When I booted it back up I was met with a grub screen giving me the choice of loading a Ubuntu previous installation, continuing to my existing installation, going to BIOS or opening the terminal. \nWhichever Ubuntu install I chose would error on me and display /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root does not exist alongside a few other errors like check root delay.\nI ran boot-repair and shut down the machine.

It says something about squashfs which is a compressed file system that is hardly used in a regular environment. In a menu entry it says something about testing Ubuntu without installing which is a dead giveaway that we're dealing with a live cd.\nI suspect you didn't install at all to your hard drive or at least you appear to only have the live cd version right now and I recommend to insert the live cd again then really install Ubuntu and see what it says about a possible existing install. \n", "Q: Can I limit how much wifi I use I don't want to be hogging up my wifi network. Can I limit how much wifi I use so I don't hog up the network I am using and if so how? \n\nA: There is probably a way to limit the speed at which your wifi connects. This question was already answered.\nPerhaps wondershaper will do what you need. It will limit upload and download speeds independently. Quoting from the article:\nsudo apt-get install wondershaper\n\nNow issue a command similar to following (replacing eth0 with your interface name):\nsudo wondershaper eth0 1024 256\n\nthis will limit the download speed to 1024 Kbps and upload to 256 Kbps. Remember that this limit is for all internet traffic i.e torrent, ftp, browsing and any thing else.\nIf you want to remove these limits use\nsudo wondershaper clear eth0\n\n", "Q: \"mv file\" and now it's missing In a terminal window, I typed:\nmv filename ..\\..      [Note the wrong slash.]\n\nNow I can't find it. Gone. I ran some searches and looked through recoverable deleted files. Nothing. Poof. Serves me right for using a Windows machine right before.\nAnyone know where it might have gone?\n\nA: It has gone nowhere, its in the current directory. It has been renamed as .... (four dots).\nAs any filename having a . in front is treated a hidden file, so it has become hidden. So, if you do ls, you won't find it. Like always, you need the -a (or -A) option of ls to view the hidden files i.e. ls -a (or ls -A) to see it.\nLet me break it down, you ran mv filename ..\\.. , the first two dots would mean the parent directory if it were ../, but you have used backward slash ..\\ which indicates shell to escape the next character but a dot . has no special meaning to shell. So, it will treat it as a literal . and the last . also added, so you got four dots .... as a filename.\nTo revert back to the previous (original) name, run mv .... filename.\n\nA: it is still in the same directory, just a 'hidden' file now. You can recover it by \"mv .... filename\". \n\nA: Run mv .... filename to rename it back. (mv ..\\.. filename would work too, but the \\ is superfluous--as it was in your original command.)\n\n\n*\n\n*The file hasn't been deleted, which is why searching for recoverable deleted files didn't find it.\n\n*Like in Windows, . and .. entries are present in every directory and refer to the \"current\" and \"parent\" directories respectively. But unlike in Windows, sequences of more than two dots don't have any special meaning. Though it's unusual, you're perfectly free to name an ordinary file with a name consisting entirely of dots, so long as it is at least three dots long.\n\n*Unlike in Windows, in Ubuntu the shell uses \\ as an escape character, ensuring the shell treats the following character literally rather than giving it a special meaning. The . character has no special meaning in the shell (in particular, the shell is not what's responsible for making the . and .. entries work). Therefore, in your command, \\. was equivalent to ..\n\n*As heemayl says, by default most utilities don't show files and directories whose names start with a .. Since .... starts with ., running ls without the -A or -a flag did not reveal it.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu characters missing with Nvidia GeForce 840M and Nouveau driver I recently bought a new laptop (ASUS-X555LN) with a 840M graphics card in it.

What is a guaranteed way of having no problems with my graphics card? Is there such a way?\nCurrently my driver options are: (also another example of my problem :) )\n\nWhich driver should I use?\nThanks for any help!\n\nA: While there is no way of not having graphics card problems, you can choose the newest, stable driver that can help.  NVIDIA is listing version 349.16 as the newest driver, so that is the one that I would choose.\nAfter choosing that driver, use the nvidia-settings as a elevated user to configure higher settings.  From a terminal window type in sudo nvidia-settings.

This is a project of mine, so I'd like to build my own rather than use something already built.\nThanks for the help in advance...\n\nA: Instead of specifying --geometry parameter, try specifying it with -g parameter. If it still doesn't work, I would consider this a bug. \nAn alternative to using the nautilus' native --geometry parameter, would be to use wmctrl , which can be used to control any other type of graphical window. This app doesn't come by default, so  you have to download it with sudo apt-get install wmctrl.\nThe command to position and scale the window would be wmctrl -r WINDOW_TITLE -e 0,XOFFSET,YOFFSET,WIDTH,HEIGHT. I've used this method on another question, to position two terminal windows with specific size and location (refer here)\nAnother , slightly better way , is to find out window id (a hex number) with xprop or wmctrl itself, and use that with -i -r parameters. Title of the Nautilus window changes as file folder changes, so this would be slightly more reliable.\nLet me know if you'd like me to elaborate more on this.\n\nA: Similar to Serge's answer this works for me:\nnautilus && sleep .1 && wmctrl -Fr \"Home\" -e '0,3633,1605,930,514'\n\n\n\n*\n\n*sleep .1 (sleep for 1/10th second for nautilus startup time) is how fast my system works.

When it will fail it will fail on popupvim.vim ~4-6 failed tests\nDo a diff -aq on a clean upstream tar extract with your building directory after running make clean\nOtherwise try outside debuild and see if tests fail.\nIf and when you try to create a package, take note:\nThe tests will fail if they are run as make test this is where you get a LOT of failed tests, like ~33-60 and it will screw up your terminal when it comes to test_gui.vim or test_alot.vim.

It says no such file or directory. \nCan somebody tell me what causes this?\n\nA: The core of this question: Directory names are case sensitive. Type cd /home/username/Downloads instead of lowercase.\nAdditional information\nFinding out directory names:\nYou can use ls to list files and directories in any directory , to see their names. For instance, on a fresh install,  you most likely would find the following directories\n$ ls /home/newuser\nDesktop/    Downloads/        Music/     Public/     Videos/\nDocuments/  examples.desktop  Pictures/  Templates/\n\nSee how they are all capitalized? This is not the case with most of system directories, such as /etc or /bin. Traditionally, Unix/Linux commands and directories are all lower-case, though it's not a rule set in stone.\nAnd by the way, there is dir, same as in Windows' cmd, a command which performs the same action - listing files in your current working directory. \nThere is an alternative: many file managers support an Open Terminal Here or Open in Terminal option. Nautilus, the default file manager for Ubuntu, does not have this feature by default as of 14.04 LTS, however there is a plugin you can install to enable this feature or use some work arounds. Refer to this question and answers to it for more information on opening a terminal from the file manager. \nNavigating in Terminal\nIn order to navigate around your home directory, there are two \"shortcuts\", one is cd $HOME/Downloads and second is cd ~/Downloads.\nIn  the first case, $HOME is an environment variable. If you run env | sort or set | sort you will see a long list of values sorted alphabetically, among which you will see a line HOME=/home/yourusername. When you run cd $HOME/Downloads the shell automatically expands $HOME to mean /home/yourusername and adds it to whatever else comes after $HOME.\nFor the second case, ~ also automatically gets substituted with the path to your home directory. There is a historical reason for this particular character to represent the home directory\nThere are also  a few tricks with cd command to make navigation even easier. cd - works kind of like a go back button in a browser; if you are in one directory but want to return from where you came and do not want to type full path, just enter cd -. For instance, if I jumped from /home/Serg to /etc, I can go back to my home folder by using that cd - command.\ncd .. will let you go up one directory. For example cd .. from /home/Serg will  bring me up to /home. \nAnd what if you want to jump from anywhere back to your home directory ? Just run cd by itself.\nHitting TAB will give you some suggestions on where to navigate, kind of works like auto-completion.\nOccasionally you may want to enter a hidden directory with your settings, which will be initialized with a single dot, e.g. .config in your home directory. You might want to list them with ls -a. Of course you will need to type it exactly as it is listed , cd .config\nAnd what if a directory has space or special characters in it? Again, use TAB button, or type everything by yourself, prepending spaces with backslash, e.g. cd Folder\\ With\\ Spaces\\ In\\ Name\nSuggestion: Invest in a book with basic information on linux or shell programming. In my case, I found very helpful Ubuntu Linux Toolbox  and Unix Shells by Example. The power of Linux lies exactly in command line. \nAnd the most important tip - have fun with it all, love what you do!\n", "Q: gnome-terminal can't set 256 color support correctly with or without tmux I've been trying to set up 256 color support correctly for quite some time but it seems to never work for me so I'm not even remotely sure what I'm doing wrong. \nHow it looks in the terminal vs gVIM: \n\nWhat I've tried so far, and just in case I use zsh (also tried with bash) \n\n\n*\n\n*added export TERM=xterm-256color, the screenshot is the current outcome of it. \n\n*then changed it to TERM=gnome-256color, same outcome\n\n*then changed it to TERM=screen-256color (this was so I could use tmux, and yes I used tmux -2 and added the set -g default-terminal \"screen-256color\" to .tmux.conf.

I'm just not sure if I need to install additional packages or something. \n\nA: Just to leave the answer here to those who are still chasing this. I guess I have learned my lesson in misunderstanding 256 color support in a way. \nSo I found my answer here. To sum it up, themes like Gotham offers 256 support, and I had in mind that it would go both ways in terms of appearances (terminal and gui). This is not the case of course, one would have to use gVim (you can get it with apt-get install vim-gtk) to use themes like Gotham. \nAnother answer by visit_muc in reddit: \n\nYou also need to understand, that the terminal will never look 100%\n  like gvim. Most vim themes consist of two color schemes. One for vim\n  (256 color) and one for gvim (24bit Truecolor HTML codes).\n\n", "Q: Need help with .sh script I’m trying to get this ~/Desktop/Tor/tor-browser_en-US/ && ./start-tor-browser to run as a .sh.

In order to search for a process you can use ps with grep.\nFor example to search for firefox\nps aux | grep firefox\n\nHow to get the same answer without using grep?\n\nA: The pgrep command, and its sibling pkill, exists precisely for this purpose:\n\n\n*\n\n*pgrep firefox will list all processes whose commands match firefox\n\n*pgrep -f firefox will list all processes whose entire command lines match firefox \n\n*pgrep -x firefox will list all processes whose commands exactly match firefox\n\n*... and so on.\n\n\nAnd naturally, pgrep will exclude itself from the match, so none of the grep rituals associated with ps | grep are needed.\n\nThe other set of tools for this are the pidof and killall commands.

I am using Ubuntu GNOME 15.04 64-bits.\nDuring the installation, I selected Portuguese (Brazil) as system language, and time zone as Warsaw (since I'm in Poland). I think the system got a little bit confused with this configuration and now it is displaying date and time in a mix of Portuguese and Polish.\nFor example, my calendar says that today is: Środka, 22 de kwiecień de 2015. Bold is brazilian formatting, italic is polish language.\nTo put in perspective, this would be as : Wednesday, 22 de April de 2015, if it would be same case but with english and portuguese.\nThis kind of mix repeats system-wide, on Cinnamon and on GNOME Shell (both are GTK3-based, so it is expected).\nI can't find a place which I can fix regional and locale settings, so how could I fix this? and which is the correct place to search and report this bug if it wasn't already?\n\nA: I have struggled with this issue in a few cases, and found that calendars are usually not displaying the expected language in case of a mixed locale.\nI'm not 100% sure as regards Ubuntu GNOME, but assuming that you want to keep Polish formats for other aspects (number formats, currency symbol, etc.), you may want to add this line to your ~/.profile file:\nexport LC_TIME=pt_BR.UTF-8\n\nThen, next time you log in, the calendar ought to be consistently in Portuguese.\n", "Q: Install stable release of xfce 4.12 I want to install the stable release of xfce 4.12 on my Xubuntu 14.04.2.\nHowever, when I add the repository (ppa:xubuntu-dev/xfce-4.12) via terminal I get a message about these being pre-releases and to wait for the final release date... Yet, the final release is already up (xfce website, two months ago).\n\n*\n\n*Why do I get a warning message if the stable version was released already? That is slightly misleading.\nFurthermore, all posts and info I see about installing xfce 4.12, either old (pre-release, this or this) or new (post release,this) follow the same proceedure (add dev-ppa).\n\n\n*How should I properly install a stable release if it doesn't appear on the main repos?\n\nA: When you run this command:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xubuntu-dev/xfce-4.12\n\nand this message appears:\nXfce 4.12 packages for currently supported versions of Xubuntu. Please note that these are pre-release versions, which may contain annoying bugs and/or crash.\n\nThen it's just a warning. There is the potential possibility that this PPA can also supply unstable versions.\n\nBut you can compile the stable version.\nHere are the instructions to compile from source, e.g. for xfce-4.12:\nwget http://archive.xfce.org/xfce/4.12/fat_tarballs/xfce-4.12.tar.bz2\ntar xf xfce-4.12.tar.bz2\ncd src\nfor f in *.tar.bz2; do tar xf $f; done\n\nThen in each folder, e.g. Thunar-1.6.6\ncd Thunar-1.6.6\n./configure\nmake\n\nand install with:\nmake install\n\nor with checkinstall for .deb packages:\nsudo apt-get install checkinstall\nsudo checkinstall\n\n\nA: Ok, got the answer for my first question. I added the repo and looked at its content in synaptic. What you see there is a bunch of packages. Some I have installed (since I have xfce 4.10). For those, some are up-to-date but others have a newer release. The key is then to contrast the version of those newer packages with the stable release. And, voila, for many they differ! This is, some packages have a newer release, beyond the stable one, which makes perfect sense. The dev ppa gives you access to the newest versions of packages, not to the stable ones. The central issue here then is that xubuntu-dev do not provide another ppa with only the newest and stable versions.\nAll these means that you cannot install the stable version of a meta-package (xfce) from the dev-ppa! Which implies that this,this,this, and part of this posts are wrong (for the latter I invite A.B to write the correct answer).\nThus, I will delete the ppa and compile the stable release as A.B. showed in another answer.\n(Nice to learn something new about linux/ubuntu!)\n", "Q: Compression support for PHPMyAdmin I have installed phpmyadmin on ubuntu with sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin.\nNow I like to activate compression support for databases.

How can I determine all packages that depend on the libsslcommon source package?\n\nA: The reverse-depends software doesn't automatically detect the source package from which a given binary package is generated. The src: label is used to indicate that what follows is the name of a source package. It so happens that the name of the source package for bash is, well, bash. But for libsslcommon2, the source package is named qpid-cpp:\n$ reverse-depends -r utopic src:qpid-cpp\nReverse-Depends\n===============\n* qpidd-msgstore                (for qpidd)\n* qpidd-msgstore                (for libqpidbroker2)\n* qpidd-msgstore                (for libqpidcommon2)\n\nPackages without architectures listed are reverse-dependencies in: amd64, armhf, i386, ppc64el\n\napt-get, on the other hand, knows the source packages (check the output of apt-cache show libsslcommon2).\n\nA: TL;DR: You can use reverse-depends src:$(what-source libsslcommon2).\nThere is no libsslcommon2 source package. Instead, libsslcommon2 is one of a number of binary packages built from the qpid-cpp source package. In general, a binary package may or may not have the same name as the source package used to build it, and source packages may provide multiple binary packages.\nThe name of the source package for bash is also bash, but source package names cannot always be guessed from binary package names.\nTwo of the ways to check what source package is used to build a binary package are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for the binary package name under \"Packages\" at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu.\n\n*Use the what-source command. (You must install what-utils  first. To do that from the command line, run sudo apt-get install what-utils.) For example, what-source libsslcommon2 outputs qpid-cpp.\n\n\nIn practice I usually use Launchpad because it often has other handy information I'm looking for at the same time. But with what-source and reverse-depends, you can write a single command to list the reverse dependencies associated with the source package for a particular binary package:\nreverse-depends src:$(what-source libsslcommon2)\n\nThis uses command substitution--a $( ) expression is replaced by the output of the command written inside the parentheses.\nYou may be surprised at the output of that command, which, at least when run from my 15.04 system, is:\nNo reverse dependencies found\n\nBut really this is not so surprising. It means no binary packages except those built from the qpid-cpp source package depend on any binary packages built from the qpid-cpp source package. For example:\nek@Io:~$ reverse-depends libsslcommon2\nReverse-Depends\n===============\n* libsslcommon2-dev\n* qpid-client\n* qpidd\n\nPackages without architectures listed are reverse-dependencies in: amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, powerpc, ppc64el\nek@Io:~$ what-source libsslcommon2-dev\nqpid-cpp\nek@Io:~$ what-source qpid-client\nqpid-cpp\nek@Io:~$ what-source qpidd\nqpid-cpp\n\nFinally, take note:\n\n\n*\n\n*You do not need to run reverse-depends (nor what-source) as root. That is, sudo reverse-depends ... is unnecessary; run reverse-depends ... instead.\n\n*As far as the reverse-depends utility is concerned, a source package's reverse dependencies are the reverse dependencies of the binary packages that are built from the source package. The specific binary package they depend on is listed in parentheses to the right of the package name, in the output of reverse-depends src:....\nThe reverse dependencies of a source package, as listed by reverse-depends, are still binary packages, not source packages. For example, the output of reverse-depends src:bash includes:\n* netscript-2.4                 (for bash)\n* netscript-2.4-upstart         (for bash)\n\nThis is even though there is no netscript-2.4-upstart source package. Instead, the netscript-2.4 and netscript-2.4-upstart binary packages are both built from the netscript-2.4 source package.\n\n*The reverse dependencies of a source package are not the same as the reverse build dependencies of a package. The reverse build dependencies of a package are the other packages that require the package in order to be built, but not necessarily to be installed once built. If you're looking for reverse build dependencies, invoke reverse-depends with the -b flag.\n", "Q: Is there a way to enable tap to click for the Thinkpad trackpoint using systemd in 15.04? Is there a way to enable tap to click for the Thinkpad trackpoint using systemd in 15.04? I know sensitivity can be adjusted, but I have not seen a way to enable tap to click. There's instructions here on how to adjust sensitivity under systemd:\nIncrease Trackpoint Sensititvity with SystemD (Ubuntu 15.04 or later)\nI've not found out how to enable tap to click though\n\nA: As per http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_configure_the_TrackPoint#Configuration_using_sysfs, on my X200 (which has no touchpad) with Ubuntu 16.04, I used sudu -i to become superuser, then echo -n 1 > /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/press_to_select to turn it on and now it works, though it's a little more sensitive than I might like so it'll take some getting used to. Thinkpads with a touchpad will have a slightly different path in the command, see the link. Also in the link is info on making the change permanent, if desired.\nEdit: Found the related https://askubuntu.com/a/761504/392539, which happens to include a possibly simpler way to make this permanent (along with other trackpoint settings), but haven't tried it myself.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut responds very slow The shortcut for print screen became very slow on my Ubuntu 14.04.2. It takes about 10-15 seconds after pressing the key to showing a print screen region selection controls. I tried to use shutter as a screenshot tool (shutter -s -C -e -n -o '/tmp/screenshot.%d-%m-%y.%T.png'), and assigned a custom shortcut to it, but it didn't change things. When I run the same command in terminal, the app shows instantly. So the problem seems to be in keyboard shortcut system.\nActually, for the sake of testing, I even assigned a shortcut to simple commands like bash -c 'ls /tmp' or gnome-terminal -e 'ls /tmp'. They still take 10+ seconds to be executed.\nOn the whole, the system works fast. Slow keys setting is turned off. Standard shortcuts work fast. The problem is only with shortcuts for print screen and custom commands.\n\nA: After an hour of googling and trying, I've found a workaround to this weird problem. Install and run CompizConfig Settings Manager:\nsudo apt-get install ccsm\nccsm\n\nClick Commands in General category. Ensure the module is activated. Add your custom command on the first tab and set a shortcut on the second one. I set the same command (shutter with options) and the same key (Print) as I'd set before in \"regular\" system settings. Now the command began to be run instantly.\n\nA: Run the below command to kill the service:\nsudo killall gnome-keyring-daemon\n\nThe service starts automatically after you killed it, and that fixes the shortcut delay issue until reboot.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14 intermittently can't come out of hibernation / sleep mode Sometimes when my Ubuntu 14 goes into hibernation mode then pressing a key won't bring it back. What could be wrong? Now I must make a hard powercycling to get back to my desktop if the screensaver starts. What is wrong and how can it be fixed?\n\nA: Hibernation mode isn't the same as sleep mode. Hibernation actually turns the computer off, meaning you need to press the power button to wake it up. For sleep, it's possible that your computer isn't designed to wake up by key-press. Try pressing the power button to wake it up instead.\n", "Q: Export kra (a krita document) as png How can I export a krita (kra) document with many layers to a png using command line?\n\nA: There is Calligra Converter:\nsudo apt-get install calligra-libs\n\nrun with \ncalligraconverter input_file output_file\n\n\nor you could try this solution:\n\nArtscript in Files/Nautilus\nArtscript is a software to convert/watermark/glue-together on the fly\n  a big range of images format.

Around 50 users are using shared user (in this case gitlab) to connect to the box to sync their repositories. This method works quite fine but unluckily it totally nukes my /var/log/auth.log which easily grows to 10 gigs per day with lines like this:\nApr 22 14:10:25 gitlab sshd[7434]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user git by (uid=227)\nApr 22 14:10:25 gitlab sshd[7435]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session closed for user gitlab\n\nIs there a method to suppress this messages for this user and stop flooding my logfile?\n\nA: You can configure rsyslogd to discard messages mentioning the gitlab user. Create a file in /etc/rsyslog.d/ (say, 10-filter-git.conf), containing:\nif $syslogfacility-text startswith 'auth' and $msg contains 'gitlab' and  not ($msg contains 'failure') then ~\n\nThis is an expression-based filter that:\n\n\n*\n\n*matches messages coming from facilities whose name begin with auth.

I used to use xorg-edgers ppa on it but I took it off about a year ago while back when it was no longer needed as Trusty did the display properly (or it might have been as it no longer worked properly). I've tried putting the ppa back again & upgrading but still the same. Also, the mouse cursor moves but clicking it on an icon's area does not work. Unfortunately I used Ubuntu Tweak to remove old Linux stuff. Any ideas?\n\nA: I suspect the problem could be a quirk in your video card.\nI have a older Dell (approximately 9 years old) that I bought used, and on which I have run Ubuntu exclusively for quite a few years. Starting with Ubuntu 12.04 I found the Unity Dash was unusable. (When I clicked the Dash button, the screen would flicker but none of the Dash overlay would appear on the screen, so there was no way to select any icon in the Dash at all.) Back in 12.04 you could login using Unity 2D, which avoided the bug in the video card's firmware. By the time 14.04 was released, Unity 2D was gone, so I knew I wouldn't be able to upgrade my machine if I wanted to use \"stock\" Ubuntu. \nSO I copied Ubuntu 14.04 to a USB stick and carried the machine to a local computer repair shop and asked them for a cheap generic video card (using a different chipset, just to be sure). The folks at the shop installed their video card and I booted from the USB stick to test it. I rejected a bad one, but ultimately got a working card that works fine, and the replacement cost me very little. \nAnother even cheaper option (if your Dell system works this way) might be to try the Intel video built into the motherboard. On my system, I have to remove a plastic cap blocking the video port and also activate the onboard video in the BIOS.\nNowadays the limited RAM in my old machine (4 GB maximum) has begun to become more of an issue with modern RAM-hungry applications, and there's not as easy a workaround... except that your local computer shop might sell you a four- or five-year-old machine with a more modern upgradeable motherboard and processor.\n", "Q: vmlinuz and initrd strange files appeared in \"/\" directory I have recently noticed that four new files have appeared in my / directory:\nlrwxrwxrwx   1 root root    33 Apr  9 14:07 initrd.img -> boot/initrd.img-3.16.0-34-generic\nlrwxrwxrwx   1 root root    33 Mar 23 19:42 initrd.img.old -> boot/initrd.img-3.16.0-33-generic\nlrwxrwxrwx   1 root root    30 Apr  9 14:07 vmlinuz -> boot/vmlinuz-3.16.0-34-generic\nlrwxrwxrwx   1 root root    30 Mar 23 19:42 vmlinuz.old -> boot/vmlinuz-3.16.0-33-generic\n\nAs I have not seen them there before I was wondering what they are and why they are now there.

The OS naturally I installed on the SSD. after using it for a week or so, configuring everything and downloading stuff I decided it's time to partition and mount the additional HDD. I partitioned the disk successfully and then I decided it would be a good idea to store the /home folder on the HDD. I followed this guide for moving the /home folder. I completed the process and everything seemed to work fine. Then I realised I still have the /media/home folder, although it was just supposed to be temporal. So I looked again in that guide, and I saw that when it says to make this dir it also says you can delete it after you finished:\n\n\n\n*Save and Close the fstab file, then type the following command:\n\nsudo mkdir /media/home\nThis command will create a new directory, later used for temporarily mounting the new partition. At the end of the procedure this directory can be removed.\n\nI went on in doing so, and it seemed as if I can't delete that dir:\n\nrm: cannot remove ‘/media/home’: Device or resource busy\n\nonly it did delete /home.\nI did install and configure some stuff before deleting /home but not many, so the failure burns but the damage is not crucial. I still want to know what am I doing wrong? wasn't I suppoesd to delete /media/home?\nWhat should I do now? What should I do differently next time I follow this guide? help.\nthanks!\n\nA: Apparently your new home partition was mounted on both /home and /media/home when you ran rm -r /media/home.\nrm -r removes a directory recursively. It removes all the files in the directory first. It's possible to mount a device on multiple mount points simultaneously. If the new home partition was still (or automatically) mounted on /media/home when you ran that command, then its contents are removed. That it was also mounted on /home does not prevent this.\nThis also explains the rm: cannot remove ‘/media/home’: Device or resource busy error. After removing everything inside /media/home (i.e., all the files on the partition mounted at that mount point), rm attempted to remove /media/home itself. But a directory that has a filesystem mounted on it cannot be removed; attempting to do so always fails with a \"Device or resource busy\" error.\n/media/home was a mount point. It didn't really contain any files, it was just a place in one filesystem to attach the contents of another filesystem. When nothing is mounted on it, it should be empty. Therefore, rm -r is not necessary for removing it--you don't need to recursively delete something when it has no contents to recurse. The usual rmdir command is sufficient to remove an empty directory that is not being used.\nNext time, do two things differently to ensure this problem does not recur:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure nothing is mounted on /media/home before you attempt to remove it. To see what is currently mounted and where, you can run mount. Or just run:\nsudo umount /media/home\n\nThat command is harmless even if the mount point is not being used. (Also, you should pay attention to the output. If the filesystem is currently being accessed through that mount point, it won't unmount the filesystem--but it will tell you that it has failed.)\nThis is really mainly to ensure that the /media/home mountpoint actually can be removed. But it will also prevent you from accidentally deleting the contents of the new home partition.\n\n*Once you are ready to remove the /media/home mount point, use this command:\nsudo rmdir /media/home\n\nBy using that command instead of a recursive rm, you avoid deleting anything inside, in case you have made a mistake and something exists inside.\nThis is for safety. Using rm -r would work too, but if you made a mistake, you can remove more than you intend. (It is good general practice to avoid rm -r ... anytime you know or believe that rmdir ... will suffice.)\nFinally, note that removing your old /media/home mount point is a totally unrelated step from removing the backup of your old home directory residing on the original partition. For that, you do have to use rm -r /old_home, because there the goal is actually to delete a bunch of files rather than merely an empty directory.\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu 14.10 on flash drive How to install ubuntu 14.10 on a 16gb usb flash drive.

I have used it to install on a few computers as well as running Ubuntu Live from the stick itself.\n", "Q: How can I remove the old kernels I have upgraded my OS version a few times. What is the best way to remove the old kernels and free space?\n\nA: Having extra kernels take space up.  You can look for your old kernels manually in the /usr/src folder.  However, the following command can remove the linux kernels quickly and easily.\nFrom a Terminal window, type in:\ndpkg -l 'linux-*' | \\\n   sed '/^ii/!d;/'\"$(uname -r | sed \"s/\\(.*\\)-\\([^0-9]\\+\\)/\\1/\")\"'/d;s/^[^ ]* [^ ]* \\([^ ]*\\).*/\\1/;/[0-9]/!d' | \\\n   xargs sudo apt-get purge\n\nThe above line should only be used if you know that your present kernel is working the way you want it and any other kernels you are not concerned about.  This will remove all kernels but the current active one that is running on your system.  It will remove even newer kernels if you are booted to an older kernel.\n", "Q: Landscape's OpenStack Autopilot: Launch instance getting network error I need some help in troubleshooting the network portion of my openstack setup.

I installed the xorg-edgers PPA, which provides more recent versions of these drivers. I identified a total of 7 different nvidia-* packages, and decided to try each one, starting with the most recent, nvidia-349. I manually checked to see if they passed these tests:\n\n\n*\n\n*rendered non-garbled login screen\n\n*allowed me to login\n\n*rendered non-garbled desktop\n\n*supported dual monitors\n\n*supported suspend/resume\n\n\nThe most recent one to pass all tests was the nvidia-340, so that's the one I used.\nI did not use the Additional Drivers dialog, and installed everything through apt-get. Oddly enough, Additional Drivers now shows I'm using the open source Xorg driver, even though I'm using nvidia. I think this is because I'm using the xorg-edgers PPA, which lists several nvidia packages not shown in the dialog, so that's probably the default if it doesn't match any of its nvidia options.\nWhile I was trying things out, I removed the quiet and splash parameters from /etc/default/grub to capture debug information during boot.\nTo fix the login loop I used\nsudo rm ~/.Xauthority\nsudo rm ~/.config/autostart\n\nSince my issues were worst on Unity, I actually uninstalled Unity and Compiz [Editor's note - Unity is the whole desktop environment.

Therefore this is the best time for you to move from WUBI to full install.\nA full install of Ubuntu needs two partitions that Windows do not understand. (a) First, a root partition, also called a / partition in the ext4 format. (b) a Swap partition in its own format. This should not be a problem unless you already have four primary partitions (the maximum possible) in your computer.\nSteps for removing WUBI Ubuntu 13.04 and installing Ubuntu 14.04 in its own partitions.\n\n*\n\n*Backup all your files both in Windows and Ubuntu.

The installation process should find the unallocated empty space where J:\\ was and create its own partitions there and install the GRUB boot loader at the proper place.\nFor more information see How do I install Ubuntu?\nIf you don't have an WUBI install, you can go straight to step 4 above.

When I go to the Network Icon in the Linux I only get a dialog box showing that I can only connect using a Ethernet cable.\nI have tried to manually enter my ISP and WEP key and still can not connect.\nDid I miss out on something when installing the OS. The drivers seem to be missing.\nI am also a complete novice to computing and really don't know how to enter any code or where to enter code if it needs it.\nI would appreciate any information that someone could provide. I see lots of people posting a similar problem but I don't see the correct fix.\nThank you,\nTed  \n\nA: I had the same problem with an HP laptop, I was able to connect via network cable and download the solution following the instructions on this page, works great now! Hope this helps!\n12.04 (Precise Pangolin) - 14.04 (Trusty Tahr)\nOpen a Terminal and if you haven't already done so, update your package list:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nIf you have a b43 card use the command\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\n\nor, if you need the b43legacy driver, use:\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43legacy-installer\n\nor, (12.04 - 12.10) if you need a LP-PHY version (e.g BCM4312), use:\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-lpphy-installer\n\nRestart the computer\n", "Q: Dual booting machines Is it possible to run a dual boot machine by installing Windows on one hard drive in the machine, and installing Ubuntu on a second hard drive inside the machine?\n\nA: No problem at all. But you need to install Windows first so grub can identify it and add an entry for it in the menu.\nYou can find further information about dual booting here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot\n", "Q: Video Player in Ububtu 14.04 I am trying to download vlc to play movies but it is not working.

I am convinced this printer can be setup to work with Ubuntu but I am at the point I need some help/guidance on what to do???? Even after installing all but iscan there is not printer that appears to be installed. \n\nA: This is very late, but for anyone else searching for the driver, it is in the package printer-driver-escpr which can be installed via apt-get or any of the graphical package managers (but not the software center).\n\nA: sudo apt-get install printer-driver-escpr\n\nworked like a charm for me on Ubuntu Xenial 16.04.\n\nA: As far as I know, epkowa is the proprietary scanner driver by Epson. If it says you need the epkowa component (i.e. sane-epkowa back-end), that likely means you need to follow the below guides:\nHow to install printer component/driver: http://tutorialforlinux.com/2014/08/23/how-to-install-epson-wf-3640-all-in-one-printer-drivers-quick-start-scanning-on-ubuntu-14-04-trusty-linux-easy-guide/\nHow to install scanner component/driver: http://tutorialforlinux.com/2014/08/23/quick-start-with-epson-scanner-for-ubuntu-14-04-trusty-lts-with-iscan-easy-guide/\nHope I was helpful :-)\n\nA: A very late addition - hopefully somebody will benefit from this.\nAbove procedure (sudo apt-get install printer-driver-escpr, then add a printer in GUI) will result in a working printer, however it will not report ink levels, as it seems to create an IPP printer.\nIf you create a 2nd driver based on URI, enter \"dnssd://EPSON%20WF-3640%20Series._ipp._tcp.local/\" this will have the same functionality PLUS be able to report ink levels.\nMarkus\n\nA: Came up with a driver for a Epson 3540 instead of a 3640 which is what I wanted, but it worked fine for what I needed to print.\nThank you.\n", "Q: Why is the server version of 14.04.1 (supported until 2019) not available for download? On the ubuntu.com download page for Server, I can only download 14.04.2. But this version is not LTS (EOL is august 2016). \n14.04.1 is supported until 2019 according to the LTS Enablement Stack page of the Ubuntu wiki, but is not available in the \"alternative downloads\". The folder 14.04 is a link to 14.04.2. \nIs it a mistake?\nBy the way, the download page seems misleading when it says 14.04.2 is a LTS version supported until 2019.\n\nA: Direct solution to the original problem\nYou can find all old point releases of 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS via these links.\nhttp://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/trusty/\nhttp://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/xenial/\nFor Ubuntu Server 14.04.1 via torrent,\nhttp://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/trusty/ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso.torrent\nhttp://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/trusty/ubuntu-14.04.1-server-i386.iso.torrent\nand the iso files directly (if it does not work with torrents),\nhttp://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/trusty/ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\nhttp://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/trusty/ubuntu-14.04.1-server-i386.iso\nYou find the corresponding md5sums at\nhttp://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/trusty/MD5SUMS\nComment to upgrading from the second point release (14.04.2 LTS)\nOnly the first and fifth point release have LTS. See this link (and scroll down),\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/info/release-end-of-life\nYou can keep upgrading from the second point release by upgrading the LTS enablement stack, but it is risky (known to cause problems with hardware drivers, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\"). Therefore I would say that it is best to stay with the first point release until the fifth point release is available (14.04.1 LTS and 16.04.1 LTS ...) particularly for servers.\n\nA: Ok I think I have finally figure it out. \n14.04.2 will be updated to 14.04.5 in august 2016 with a standard \"dist-upgrade\". So my server with the version 14.04.2 is supported until 2019.\nThanks!\n", "Q: Ubuntu Shutdown Timeout too short I am using Ubuntu 14.04.2. I have Virtual Box 4.3.26 installed running a headless CentOS VM. I use the vboxautostart-service to start and save the virtual box at startup and shutdown as described here.  \nIn general this works well, however suspending the virtual machine during shutdown takes some time. Unfortunately, the Ubuntu shutdown process does not wait long enough, so that the virtual machine is killed before it is completely saved. \nHow can I increase the timeout, so that the virtual machine has a chance to suspend?\n\nA: I added simple sleep command to the stop section of the init script as suggested by @user1133275. This works well. Of course this could be optimized, but it is good enough for the time being. \n`stop() {\n    [ -z \"$VBOXAUTOSTART_DB\" ] && exit 0\n    [ -z \"$VBOXAUTOSTART_CONFIG\" ] && exit 0\nPARAMS=\"--stop --config $VBOXAUTOSTART_CONFIG\"\n# prevent inheriting this setting to VBoxSVC\nunset VBOX_RELEASE_LOG_DEST\n\nfor user in `ls $VBOXAUTOSTART_DB/*.stop`\ndo\n    start_daemon `basename $user | sed -ne \"s/\\(.*\\).stop/\\1/p\"` $binary $PARAMS\ndone\nsleep 40\nreturn $RETVAL\n\n}\n`\n", "Q: Ubuntu on Chromebook So, I recently bought a Toshiba Chromebook 2 and have I've tried everything to wipe Chrome Os off the SSD or to \"Legacy Dual Boot\" to run a full blown Linux Distro. So in my efforts to get a full Linux Distro I created a partition which I have no idea how to get rid of. So, if anyone knows how to delete the partition or how to install a full OS I would love some input. \nThanks  \n\nA: user68186 is right you need to flash your chromebook with a modified bios. Thanks to John's hard work you can now download it from his website.\nThe main steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable developer mode on your chromebook\n\n*Disable write-protect so that you can write to the BIOS\n\n*Flash the BIOS with the modified version downloaded from John's site\n\n*Boot your chromebook from a live Ubuntu USB drive and\ninstall in the normal way (it's a good idea to wipe all the chrome OS\npartitions).\n\n\nIf you need a step by step process for this, see my post on wiping Chrome OS and installing Ubuntu.\n", "Q: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgfortran (matlab) I try to use mex some toolbox using matlab.

It will automatically continue if all goes well, and will only stop to prompt the user to ask whether they want to add the PPA and whether they want to install the package. It may also work better than the three-liner if all the exit codes produced by the programs are accurate, as the user may continue to enter the commands and not noticed the first or second failed.\nIf you want to go all the way of automatically continuing: \n sudo add-apt-repository -y example/ppa && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y example-program\n\nIf you want to use it that's fine (just be prepared that apt-get can have a ‘nice’ habit of destroying things if not used wisely, so don't use a odd ppa or much around too muck with dependencies), but if you want to document about installing a program I would recommend use one of the two or three liners (without -y), as it allows the user more control over what happens, making them happier and preventing nasty accidents (and as @Zacharee1 says, it is easier to understand, learn, & remember as separate lines - new users may not understand that they can separate the lines out, or may assume that as the command(s) in one string are so long that they obviously may do something evil)\nSome && etc examples:\n $ true && echo \"this will show output as that thing ← said it exited successfully\"\nthis will show output as that thing ← said it exited successfully\n $ false && echo \"this won't\"\n $ false || echo \"but this will\"\nbut this will\n $ true || echo \"weird init?\"\n $ true ; echo \" ← and this\"\nand this\n $ false ; echo \"doesn't care\"\ndoesn't care\n $ echo $?\n0\n $ echo \"previous exit code ↑\" ; true\nprevious exit code ↑\n $ echo \"previous exit code ↑\"\nprevious exit code ↑\n $ \n\n\nA: Everything there is the same thing. I think the reason it's usually listed the way it is is because it looks better and is easier to remember, since the commands are split up.\n", "Q: 15.04 - very slow boot After upgrading to 15.04 , one computer is very, very slow to boot -several minutes, instead of ~20sec.\nI do not know if this helps:\ngraphical.target @1min 40.961s\n└─multi-user.target @1min 40.961s\n └─kerneloops.service @1min 36.392s +16ms\n └─network-online.target @1min 36.391s\n  └─network.target @1min 30.948s\n    └─wpa_supplicant.service @1min 31.430s +6ms\n      └─basic.target @1min 30.414s\n        └─sockets.target @1min 30.414s\n          └─acpid.socket @1min 30.414s\n            └─sysinit.target @1min 30.412s\n              └─networking.service @1.941s +49ms\n                └─apparmor.service @1.383s +555ms\n                  └─local-fs.target @1.381s\n                    └─media-andre-6564\\x2d3236.mount @2min 17.386s\n                      └─local-fs-pre.target @1.375s\n                        └─systemd-remount-fs.service @1.328s +41ms\n                          └─systemd-fsck-root.service @1.197s +129ms\n                            └─system.slice @324ms\n                              └─-.slice @323ms\n\nandre@andre-Latitude-E5520:~$ systemd \nFailed to create root cgroup hierarchy: Permission denied\nFailed to allocate manager object: Permission denied\n\n\nA: The problem was caused by bad swap partition reference in /etc/crypttab.\nIt waited 90 seconds before giving up on that.\nFor some reason swap was defined on an non-existing drive, once the line was deleted, everything works fine.\n\nA: I had the same error - it was related to the UUIDs in /etc/fstab.

Choose the 1:1 copy and select an image file as target.\nIn general there are some DVD that have additional protections. In some cases it helps to try playing the DVD in different media players first. \n\nA: Assuming you own the DVD, use MakeMKV to rip it into an MKV. The MKV can then be converted with Handbrake, or your weapon of choice, if needed. You also need to install libdvdcss2, I thought MakeMKV took care of this but it was a good while ago that I installed it.\n\nA: SimpleBurn works very well, it rips to an AVI file, you can select the quality of the output video as well. However, it still depends on libdvdcss2.\n\nA: Handbrake isn't exactly a 1:1 copy. It worked for me with a troublesome dvd, but without converting it wasn't best format to play on my 1GHz AMD Series-6 (hey its still capable of playing MPEG2 in HD and it's not main PC)\nYou might also run into problems with old tv/players and those new formats. I would try with makemkv first as it does use libdvdcss2 and does convert into a container format from which you can get something a lot closer to original. You can try dvdrecord too which uses libdvdcss as well I think, but just copy it to your HD. You can then make a DVD copy to a writeable DVD.\nI understand why they are protecting their products. But it is frustrating not make a true copy for your personal use whether it is preserve and  backup to compact library in a time where >8TB disks become more and more common. Esp. since DVDs are mostly a thing of the past that we cling onto and everyone are streaming anyway.\n\nA: Make MKV will simply backup your DVD as mkv files (one for the main content, and separate ones for the others, if there are any). The VOB files are joined and put in the new container without altering the streams (no re-encoding).\nIn 20.04 it is available from PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:heyarje/makemkv-beta\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install makemkv-bin\n\nThe program is also available as snap here. A snap needs supplementary access to the dvd drive as said here:\nsnap connect makemkv:optical-write\nsnap connect makemkv:removable-media\n\n", "Q: Creating an SD disk image from scratch: \"you must specify a filesystem type\" The really short version:\nI am trying to create a disk image that includes an MBR/bootloader provided in another image, and one partition with a root filesystem provided in a tarball. Creating the image file, partitioning it, associating it with a loopback using kpartx, and applying a filesystem all seem to work, but when I try to mount /dev/mapper/loopXp1, mount says you must specify a filesystem type. Doing so, of course, doesn't help.\nDetails:\nI've seen tons of tutorials on how to make an image from an existing SD and then write it to another, but that would mean making my users download an image that may not match the size of their SD, much of which is just zeros or other junk, since the starting filesystem isn't very full. \nThus, it seems sensible to just have people download a dd of just the bootloader, plus a tarball of the root fs, then run a script that creates an image of the desired size for local distribution. \nUnfortunately, although I could swear these steps have worked in the past, I keep running into the problem described above.   \nHere's exactly what I'm doing:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Adapted from instructions at http://linux-sunxi.org/Bootable_SD_card\n\n# Settings\nimg_fn=test.img\nimg_size=2 #Gigs\nimg_mountpoint=\"fs\"\nimg_bootsect=\"bootsect.img\"\nimg_rootfs=\"rootfs.tar.bz2\"\n\n# Start a disk image file\ndd if=/dev/zero of=$img_fn bs=1024 count=10 || exit\n\n# Apply the bootloader\ndd if=$img_bootsect of=$img_fn bs=1024 seek=8 || exit\n\n# Extend the image to the desired size\ntruncate -s ${img_size}G $img_fn || exit\n\n# Create one partition that fills the \"disk\"\n# Using '0 -0' or '0 -1' here warns produces a warning that  the\n# partition \"is not properly aligned for best performance.\"\nparted -s $img_fn 'mklabel msdos mkpart primary 1 -1 print' || exit\n\n# Associate the file with a loopback device\nsudo kpartx -a $img_fn || exit\n\n# Get the name of the loopback device\nrootfs_dev=/dev/mapper/$(sudo kpartx -l $img_fn | awk '{print $1}')\n\n# Create mountpoint and filesystem, mount the new FS\n[ -e $img_mountpoint ] || mkdir -p $img_mountpoint  || exit\nsudo mkfs.ext4 $rootfs_dev  || exit\n\n###\n### THINGS BREAK HERE \n### mkfs appears to succeed, but mount fails with:\n### \"mount: you must specify the filesystem type\"\n###\nsudo mount $rootfs_dev $img_mountpoint  || exit\n\nsudo tar -C $img_mountpoint -jxf $img_rootfs  || exit\n\nsudo umount $img_mountpoint\nsudo kpartx -d $img_fn\nrmdir $img_mountpoint\n\nHeres's the complete bash -x output if anyone wants it.

Could use different version if necessary.\n\nA: Currently, if this thread is anything to go off of, cross-fade in VLC is not easily feasible as the core of the program does not support gapless music and any add-on enabling cross-fade would have to \"edit\" the core of the program.

I've spent a ton of time searching for this on Google, and I still can't seem to find it. Please read fully before answering, because the majority of the answers I'm finding are about preventing screen-dimming while already logged in. I'm looking to prevent screen-dimming while on the lockscreen. \nWhen I manually lock my screen, 5 seconds or so later, it dims to off. I don't want this behavior. I've set the display to never turn off in the GUI settings:\n\nand from the terminal, I've tried all of the following:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver idle-activation-enabled false\n\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 0\n\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power idle-dim false\n\nI know this is possible, because I have done this before on 14.04. I recently reinstalled Ubuntu and of course forgot to document the change I made to make it do that.\nOne thing I do notice is that if I lock the screen, wait for it to start dimming, and then move my mouse around, it stays on. This tells me there is some function that starts a countdown immediately after you lock the screen, and then dims the screen once it runs out. I'm trying to figure out how to disable that. \nI am running a fully updated copy of 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04.2 on a Lenovo T540p. \nAny ideas would be really helpful. \n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04\nI have also been trying to figure out how to stop the lock screen from dimming. I can not seem to find anything associated with the screen dimming when going to the lock screen that I can edit/tweak.\nI tried all the usual suggestions of\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver idle-activation-enabled false\n\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 0\n\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power idle-dim false\n\nbut none of them worked.\n**** WORKAROUND ****\nHowever invoking an activity once the dimming starts seems to then follow what ever settings you have enabled in the system settings > Brightness & Lock > settings.\nThe way you can stop it is by locking the screen then typing a few random characters into the password prompt. It will now no longer dim.\n", "Q: How to recover an HDD after using it for SWAP Last night I was working on my linux box using a CFD solver where I needed more than the 16 GB RAM that I already have installed. So I took one of my external HDDs (total of 360G capacity with about 100G remaining) and issued the command to let it be used as a SWAP space.\nThe program ran till about midnight and I left machine running as the job was still going. In the morning, I saw the machine was frozen (maybe still busy) so I rebooted the machine.\nThen I checked my external drive I used as SWAP and it was not accessible. I disconnected it and checked on Windows and it asked me to reformat. Since then I have used \"testdisk\" and I see that it appears to be OK but I cannot access the original contents (windows files).\nHow could I access or recover the data left on that disk?\nThanks.\n\nA: You wrote:\n\nSo I took one of my external HDDs (total of 360G capacity with about 100G remaining) and issued the command to let it be used as a SWAP space.\n\nThe antecedent of \"it\" is unclear, and the answer to your question depends on that detail:\n\"It\" = 100GiB Free Space\nIf \"it\" refers to the 100GiB of free space you mention, then the appropriate commands would have been:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use fdisk, parted, GParted, or some other tool to create a new partition in that unpartitioned space.\n\n*Use mkswap or GParted to prepare the new partition as swap space.\n\n*Use swapon to activate the swap space.\n\n\nThere are variants of this. For instance, you might have created a swap file rather than a swap partition. In any event, the key point here is that only part of the disk was used as swap space, leaving the used portions of the disk untouched by Linux's swap tools.\nIn this case, your original data should be accessible. If it's not, further diagnostics are required, as noted below....\n\"It\" = Whole Disk\nIf you did not prepare a swap partition or swap file, and simply issued mkswap on the whole-disk device (/dev/sdb or whatever it is) or on the existing partition(s) on the disk (/dev/sdb1, for example), then you've destroyed at least some of your existing data. You might be able to recover some file using a tool such as PhotoRec, but how many files you'll be able to recover depends on how much swap space your software consumed while you left it running. If little swap space was used, you might be able to get back most of your files; but if your software chewed up most of the available disk space, or if you were simply unlucky in what specific sectors it used, you could have already lost most or all of your files.\nIf the damaged disk used NTFS, note that there are Windows-specific programs similar to PhotoRec that do the same job, and may do it better. The times I've used it, PhotoRec has never recovered filenames for me; but some Windows-specific tools may do so. Thus, you may want to look into such tools.\nIn Either Case....\nThere are two commands that you may want to run if you're not sure what you've done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type sudo parted -l to learn how your disks are partitioned.\n\n*Type sudo blkid to learn how each partition is prepared (what filesystem it uses, or if it's swap space).\n\n\nIf you're not sure how to interpret the data, edit your question to add it or post a link to a pastebin site that holds the output.\nThese commands may turn up the cause of your problems if you did not wipe it all out as swap space. You might need to do something more in that case, though. For instance, if your external disk uses NTFS, you might need to run CHKDSK on it from Windows. (There are no adequate NTFS-repair tools in Linux, so a system crash when NTFS is mounted requires repair in Windows.)\n", "Q: One user can view files in Samba share from Win7 PC, other user cannot (from same PC) I mapped a mounted drive to a share (named \"Docs\") in Samba.  This drive automatically mounts.  I'm using User security for share access.

When using smbclient I'm prompted for my password, which I enter, and it works.

For some reason, it did not work well with my system, the mouse did not respond, and neither did my network. So I booted using an older kernel (3.13.0-37) and it worked fine.\nBut every time I booted I had to press shift and choose the working kernel, so I looked around on how to configure my boot so it loaded the previous one. \nNot knowing exactly what I was doing, i followed the steps on this thread, basically editing the /etc/default/grub file where it read GRUB_DEFAULT=0 to GRUB_DEFAULT=2. And then running sudo update-grub on Terminal. \nThen I restarted my PC and all I got was the ASUS UEFI BIOS Utility. No Grub, no Ubuntu, no nothing. Holding shift or c did not do anything. I made a Live USB from a freshly downloaded .iso of Ubuntu and now I'm running Ubuntu from the USB drive. But I can't recover my old grub file (I did had it backed up before messing with it). I can access my HDD, with three partitions: sda1,  where I think (as I am very ignorant in these matters) my PC boots from; sda2 (not sure what it is) and sda3, where most of my files are, but it is in a file system called \"crypto_LUKS\"\nI got this by reading in the BootInfo summary from boot-repair. \nI've tried solving the problem three different ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*using boot-repair recommended repair (like this) -- it says it finds the /boot, says it does the repairing, but after booting I just go back to my UEFI BIOS.

So I decided to try to upgrade pip, following this reference: \nhttps://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html#install-pip\nSo I ran : \nsudo pip install -U pip\n\nThat output was:\nDownloading/unpacking pip from https://pypi.python.org/packages/py2.py3/p/pip/pip-6.1.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl#md5=172eb5abab25a5e0f7a7b63c7a49378d\n  Downloading pip-6.1.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl (1.1MB): 1.1MB downloaded\nInstalling collected packages: pip\n  Found existing installation: pip 1.5.4\n    Uninstalling pip:\n      Successfully uninstalled pip\nSuccessfully installed pip\nCleaning up...\n\nNow however when I run:\npip install <package>\n\nI get:\n\"bash: /usr/bin/pip: No such file or directory\"\n\nWhat can I do to get the new pip working? \n(And hopefully not have to re-install all of the packages that the older version of pip had installed).\nI am very new Ubuntu and to using pip.\nAdditional:\nI tried running:\neasy_install pip\n\nThis gave me:\nSearching for pip\nBest match: pip 6.1.1\nAdding pip 6.1.1 to easy-install.pth file\nInstalling pip script to /usr/local/bin\nInstalling pip3.4 script to /usr/local/bin\nInstalling pip3 script to /usr/local/bin\n\nUsing /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages\nProcessing dependencies for pip\nFinished processing dependencies for pip\n\nStill the pip command is not being recognized.\npip --version\n\nbash: /usr/bin/pip: No such file or directory\n\nMore additional:\nI downloaded the get-pip.py and then ran python get-pip.py.\nThis gave me an error something like \"InsecurePlatformWarning\"\n\nA: Once you have upgraded pip you only needed to update your link to your new pip on /usr/bin\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/pip /usr/bin/\n\nsince the old one has been removed when you upgrade the pip package using pip ;-)\nThen, you are ready to go :)\n\nA: This is merely an issue of bash remembering where executables are located. The Ubuntu python-pip package installs the pip executable to /usr/bin/pip, but anything installed via pip goes to /usr/local, meaning it installs the pip executable to /usr/local/bin/pip. However, bash remembers that the command pip is located at /usr/bin/pip, because it has looked up the command before, and tries to execute that without actually searching the path.\nYou can fix this by running hash -r in all open bash shells, or by opening a new shell, or rebooting. Reinstalling the Ubuntu python-pip package means you will have two different versions of pip installed simultaneously - but /usr/local will be used before /usr, so it ends up working. It's just not an efficient way to do things. :)\n\nA: Try using the package from the repository,\nsudo apt-get install python-pip\n\nIf this gives you errors, you might first want to do a \nsudo apt-get remove python-pip\nand then try again with install. \nThis also shouldn't interfere or remove the modules you already installed.\n", "Q: Rhythmbox: Cannot edit properties Could you help me out with a noob problem?\nI used to be able to edit song properties in Rhythmbox (14.04) via generic user GUI stuff. Right click, hit edit properties, type what you need to, right? Approximately two months ago, whenever I hit 'Properties' on one of my songs to edit its properties, it won't let me delete the 'Unknown' placeholder so I can organize my music.\nThis has been a long-term issue that didn't occur in the past. This is getting to be quite annoying, and I would love it if someone would help me fix this. A list of commands or a package download would be helpful.

Need to Ctrl Alt Del to reach grub Turning the machine on or rebooting leads to a black screen right after the brand logo (Acer) splash screen. Nothing happens until I hit Ctrl+Alt+Del, which kind of reboots but shows the grub menu. At this point I can choose the system and boot normally. The system works fine, but having to do this each time I turn the computer on is not nice. Related question without answer.\nAny ideas? \n\nA: It is likely that your /etc/default/grub file contains these two lines:\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\n\nCan't understand why they leave these options there, since they are deprecated in favor of GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE according to info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration'.\nCommenting out these two options make the grub menu appears right away when booting (idea taken from here). This leads to another problem that initially I didn't have: after choosing the option from grub, the system hangs in a black screen. To solve this one, go back to /etc/default/grub and change the line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"nomodeset\"\n\nBesides commenting out the two hidden timeout options mentioned, I also added GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden and set GRUB_TIMEOUT=2. This way the grub menu is hidden but if during the 2 seconds interval you press ESC you get the menu back. Otherwise you boot to your default option.\nUPDATE:\nYou might leave quiet splash before nomodeset to keep the good looking boot process:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\"\n\nThe nomodeset introduced a new problem for me: can't control brightness anymore with fn keys. Once I figure a solution I'll update this.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Gnome: screen \"zoomed\" in and stuck I tried switching from Gnome (Metacity) to Ubuntu (default) because I wanted to try something with Unity. The screen appeared WAY zoomed in, with the Gnome menu bar still at the top, and the side dock momentarily visible, then disappeared. I tried switching back and logging in, and the desktop is screwed up: menus and icons about 4x the size they should be, the upper menu bar almost useless. \nThe screen resolution reports as 1920x1080, but is actually 1/4 of that, zoomed into the upper left quadrant. xrandr also reports 1920x1080, but if I use --scale 2.0 x 2.0, it refreshes at the correct resolution (but the menus, cursor, etc. are all wrong).\nOther users are still fine; it's just my account. \nAny ideas how I can \"reset\" this back to its correct size, etc.?\n\nA: What a mess...\nI got stuck in this after kids mash the keyboard.\nThis worked for me:\nSettings -> Universal Access -> Seeing -> Zoom.\nSwitch it to off.\n\n\nA: I ended up restoring all my configuration files (ie those files and directories in my home directory whose names begin with a . or have paths beginning ~/.) from a backup and that fixed it. But I never figured out what caused it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu touch on Windows 8 (x86-64) tablet A note to readers: Yes, this question has already been asked. However, most of the questions asked about this topic never received an answer, and those questions that did receive an answer are grossly outdated and don't apply to the current versions of Ubuntu Touch. Circumstances have changed, therefore, this question is NOT a duplicate. Any off topic answers will be flagged.\nI was reading up on the current Ubuntu daily builds yesterday, and I noticed that X86 support has officially been implemented into the current dev builds of Ubuntu touch.\n\nThis opens up a WHOLE bunch of new opportunities. I got to tinkering with an X86 emulator, using a modified Nexus 7 android bootloader in place of the traditional BIOS. I was able to get Ubuntu Touch running (slow as molasses, and not without the odd graphical issue), it was all going great, until U-T tried initializing the battery and the radio. It all crashed after that, even corrupted the image I was using to do it. However, this proves that Ubuntu Touch is capable of running on X86 hardware.\nNow I'm pretty good with virtual hardware, but I suck when it comes to actually trying anything out on real hardware. I have no idea how to port an android bootloader to specific devices, much less attempting to manipulate Ubuntu touch into running on the disgraceful 32-bit UEFI firmware that comes with the majority of Windows (baytrail) tablets.\nHonestly, getting an android bootloader to run in a virtual machine was bad enough, I had to create a virtual dynamic CPU that could switch between the ARM and x86 architecture inside of a running environment, without crashing, or even causing catastrophic damage to everything loaded in RAM.\nSo really, I just wanted to know if anyone had figured out how to get past these limitations, and in general, install Ubuntu Touch on a 32 or 64-bit Windows 8 tablet.\n\nA: *\n\n*Try to download the newest image from Ubuntu Next. (This should be Unity8)\n\n*Then download and add bootia32.efi to .../EFI/boot/ on your install-USB-Stick to boot on that crappy 32-bit UEFI.\nThis worked on my Pipo W1 Tablet, although touchscreen was not working and the wifi/blutooth driver also. Tried it on my desktop, worked but most apps crashed seconds after starting. :(\nIf it wont work with touch-ui (mir),\n\n\n*\n\n*try to:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unity8-lxc\n\n\n*reboot and then\nsudo unity8-lxc-setup\n\n\n*You can now choose the display manager at logging in. It runs in LXC-Mode, so the rest of the system should not be destroyed if something goes wrong (i hope XD).\nEDIT:\nAlso Touch is working on my Pipo W1, but i think it needs to be calibrated, i can not swipe in from the outside etc.\n", "Q: Recovering Data from TOSHIBA MK4026GAX (0201)?

The bug hasn't been fixed yet, but luckily there is a workaround.\nYou'll need:\n\n\n*\n\n*A working computer with Ubuntu already installed\n\n*1 minute of your time\n\n\nThe workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug your created Live USB into a computer with Ubuntu already installed.\n\n*Navigate to /usr/lib/syslinux/bios/ in your file manager (in some installations the path you need is /usr/lib/syslinux/modules/bios/).\n\n*Select the following three files: libcom32.c32, menu.c32, and libutil.c32.\n\n*Copy (not cut) the above files over to the root directory of your Live USB drive.\n\n*Unmount the USB drive, and you're good to go!\n\n\nThis solution was based off a blog post found on AjoPaul.com\nAlternative Workaround From the command line:\nAfter you install Ubuntu 14.10 to your USB drive, run the following commands:\ncd /usr/lib/syslinux/modules/bios/\ncp libcom32.c32 /media/path/to/usb/drive/\ncp libutil.c32 /media/path/to/usb/drive/\ncp menu.c32 /media/path/to/usb/drive/\n\n\nA: There is a very simple solution to this, I had the same issue when I used Startup Disk Creator from my laptop running Ubuntu. All you Have to do is press Tab when you get the error. When you press tab, you will see some new options like 'Live'. just type live on your keyboard and press enter. This will allow you to run Xubuntu from the usb drive. Once you have successfully booted into Xubuntu you can install the OS to your netbook from there. \nAlso you may want to install Xubuntu 14.04 or 16.04 as these versions will be supported for a longer period of time.\nThis method worked for me when I tried to boot into Ubuntu 14.10.

There were multiple instances of cron script running (around thousands) and multiple instances of \"sleep\".\nWhen I killed one of the sleep process, cron script associated with it also completed.\nDoes sleep hangs often? Is it required to restart the machine to avoid this? Any other method to avoid this.\n\nA: I think you have created a loop of things.\nFor example consider the following (bad) script, lets call it check.sh:\nwhile :; du -sh /home/user >> /some/file 2>/dev/null; sleep 5; done\n\nNow create a cron entry so that check.sh will run after every 30 minutes:\n*\\30 * * * * bash /path/to/check.sh\n\nLets consider the script first run at 10:00, the disk space will be checked and saved in a file. The tricky part is sleep 5, if you don't put a valid condition for closing it, it will pause the script for 5 secs and then will continue from the top meaning the same checking and writing operation. This loop will go on and on.\nAgain after 30 mins, cron starts a new process that will do the same thing over and over again. Remember the first process started by cron at 10:00 is still running.\nThis cycle will continue and in 6 hours you will have 13 of the same processes triggered by cron and most importantly every process is running in a indefinite loop.\nIn summary, while using cron you don't need things like sleep 5 unless your operation demands something like that, in the latter case put a valid condition so that the process does not run indefinitely.\n", "Q: apt-get /usr/bin/datetime.so wrong ELF class I'm trying to add a repo to apt-get bit it fails complaining over ELF headers\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:chris-lea/node.js\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/add-apt-repository\", line 11, in <module>\n    from softwareproperties.SoftwareProperties import SoftwareProperties, shortcut_handler\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/softwareproperties/SoftwareProperties.py\", line 44, in <module>\n    from xml.sax.saxutils import escape\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/xml/sax/saxutils.py\", line 6, in <module>\n    import os, urllib.parse, urllib.request\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py\", line 88, in <module>\n    import http.client\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/http/client.py\", line 69, in <module>\n    import email.parser\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/email/parser.py\", line 12, in <module>\n    from email.feedparser import FeedParser, BytesFeedParser\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/email/feedparser.py\", line 27, in <module>\n    from email import message\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/email/message.py\", line 15, in <module>\n    from email import utils\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/email/utils.py\", line 30, in <module>\n    import datetime\nImportError: /usr/bin/datetime.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32\nError in sys.excepthook:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/apport_python_hook.py\", line 63, in apport_excepthook\n    from apport.fileutils import likely_packaged, get_recent_crashes\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/apport/__init__.py\", line 5, in <module>\n    from apport.report import Report\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/apport/report.py\", line 21, in <module>\n    from urllib.request import urlopen\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py\", line 88, in <module>\n    import http.client\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/http/client.py\", line 69, in <module>\n    import email.parser\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/email/parser.py\", line 12, in <module>\n    from email.feedparser import FeedParser, BytesFeedParser\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/email/feedparser.py\", line 27, in <module>\n    from email import message\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/email/message.py\", line 15, in <module>\n    from email import utils\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/email/utils.py\", line 30, in <module>\n    import datetime\nImportError: /usr/bin/datetime.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32\n\nI've already tried reinstalling the datetime libary using sudo apt-get install --reinstall --purge libpython3.4-stdlib libpython2.7-stdlib\nAny idea on how to fix this problem?

The ESP holds both GRUB and the Windows EFI boot loader, and the MBR holds the first-stage GRUB BIOS boot loader.\n\n\nNote that you've got both BIOS and EFI boot loaders for both Windows and Linux, so it's unclear how either of your OSes is booting -- in BIOS mode or in EFI mode. Given that Windows is installed to an MBR disk, my hunch is it was installed (and should boot) in BIOS mode; but it's conceivable it's booting in EFI mode, since you seem to have a Windows EFI boot loader in your ESP, even though it's on the other disk. (OTOH, those files may have been placed there by Boot Repair, which sometimes \"hijacks\" those names for copies of GRUB.) Both your Boot Repair and your Boot Info Script outputs include efibootmgr runs, which indicates that they were run from an EFI-mode boot; but it looks like they may have been run from a live CD, so that's not necessarily diagnostic of how your regular installation boots. Your grub.cfg file has some EFI-specific features, which also suggests an EFI-mode installation of Ubuntu, but that could be misleading.\nUntangling this setup is possible but would be quite tricky. There is a potential shortcut, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Prepare a boot medium from the files you download.\n\n*Boot to the rEFInd medium. Its menu should appear, showing options for both Ubuntu and Windows. Note that the point of using rEFInd up to here (and in the next couple of steps) is to ensure that Ubuntu boots in EFI mode and not in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\n\n*Test the boot options. I expect that at least one Ubuntu option will boot normally, but Windows is up in the air. (The option might start and then hang or present an error message.)\n\n*If rEFInd can boot Ubuntu normally, and especially if it can also boot Windows, install the rEFInd PPA or Debian package in Ubuntu.\n\n*Reboot with the rEFInd USB drive or CD-R removed. rEFInd should come up, booted off your hard disk.\n\n*Boot to Ubuntu from rEFInd.\n\n*If rEFInd did not boot Windows, edit the /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf file: Uncomment the scanfor line and ensure that hdbios is among the options. This action activates rEFInd's support to switch from EFI-mode booting to BIOS-mode booting. The idea is to get rEFInd to show you an option to boot Windows in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\n\n*When you reboot, you should see a new gray diamond-shaped option with a hard disk badge. With any luck, this will boot Windows (in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode).\n\n*If the new BIOS/CSM/legacy option does not boot Windows, uncomment the uefi_deep_legacy_scan option from refind.conf and try again.\n\n\nNote that you can delay installing rEFInd to your hard disk and edit the EFI/refind/refind.conf file on the USB flash drive if you want to test rEFInd's ability to boot Windows in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. You might do this if you want to be sure rEFInd can boot both OSes before installing it.\nThe end result is that you'll boot Ubuntu in EFI mode and Windows in either EFI mode or BIOS mode, whichever was used for its installation. You may have extra boot options on rEFInd's menu, but you can trim those by further edits to refind.conf. In particular, you'd use dont_scan_files, dont_scan_dirs, or dont_scan_volumes. You can also delete pointless boot files, such as if the \"Windows\" boot files (/boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/*.efi) are copies of GRUB created by Boot Repair.\n\nA: I managed to figure this one out however I had to reinstall both Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04. I had to ensure that both operating systems were installed on UEFI by disabling CSM and booting from UEFI mode.\nI also followed this guide:\nhttp://www.linuxbsdos.com/2014/05/31/dual-boot-ubuntu-14-04-windows-7-on-a-pc-with-2-hdds-and-uefi-firmware/\nThank you so much for everyone's help, especially @Rod Smith for clearing up my bootloader situation.\n", "Q: uninstallation didn't work I recently installed \"Battle for Wesnoth\" and  the \"BfW map editor\" from software center. \nI uninstalled it with Software Center and now the game is shown as uninstalled there.\nHowever, I can still start and play the game, \"re-uninstalling\" doesn't seem to be possible.\nCan anyone please help me uninstalling the game and the map editor?

If the RAM in your graphics card is failing, sometimes just a small fraction of the RAM goes bad while the rest of the RAM continues to work properly.

From the Security Team FAQ:\n\nWhat software is officially supported by the Ubuntu Security team?  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Ubuntu is currently divided into four components: main, restricted, universe and multiverse. All binary packages in\n  main and restricted are supported by the Ubuntu Security team for\n  the life of an Ubuntu release, while binary packages in universe\n  and multiverse are supported by the Ubuntu community.\n  \n\nTypically, only the packages in the standard Ubuntu flavour's installation disks are in main or restricted. That means that a lot of software in Ubuntu GNOME, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, etc. are not in main:\n$ apt-cache show gnome-shell konqueror | grep Section \nSection: universe/gnome\nSection: universe/web\n\nNote how both these packages, crucial to Ubuntu GNOME and Kubuntu respectively, are from the universe section.\nSupport for the universe and multiverse sections is done by the community, specifically, the Masters of the Universe (MOTU). This means that Canonical makes no guarantees about them. The MOTU Update Procedures describe when and how they provide updates.\nSo, no matter which flavour you install, you will get the same level of support for some software, and a different level for the rest - after all, even with the standard Ubuntu, after installation, you might install software from the universe section, such as VLC.\n", "Q: Issues with executable: file not found after using chmod to fix permissions I have downloaded and extracted the Linux binary for the blackbox PDDL planner, and I'm trying to get the blackbox file to execute. I changed to the directory with the file and tried ./blackbox, which gave me a permissions error. No big deal, just run chmod 755 blackbox to give it executable permissions. But then, when I try ./blackbox again, I get the following error:\nbash: ./blackbox: No such file or directory\n\nIt does the same when I give the command arguments. When I run ls -l though, I see the blackbox file and it has -rwxr-xr-x permissions, so I'm not sure why it's \"losing\" the file.\nI'm running Ubuntu 14.04 as a dual boot with Windows 7, if that matters.\nEDIT: I found a helpful question over on Superuser, which has gotten me partially there. I ran readelf -l ./blackbox | grep ld-linux to find what I needed, then did a package content search to find out I needed the libc6-i386 package.

Here's the (somewhat hacky) steps I took to resolve this issue (partially chronicled in this question on Superuser):\n\n\n*\n\n*uname -m told me I have a 64-bit OS, but file blackbox told me that this exe was 32-bit.\n\n*ldd blackbox (strangely) told me that the file was not a dynamic executable, even though I also saw this from file. Trying readelf -l ./blackbox | grep ld-linux told me [Requesting program interpreter: /lib/ld-linux.so.2], which was a shared library that I didn't have at that location.\n\n*sudo apt-get install libc6-i386 to get that library file (found that with a package search on packages.ubuntu.com).\n\n*Now ldd gave me output, and I was missing libstdc++.so.6 and libgcc_s.so.1 (see my edit), so I needed to get these files.\n\n*After a bit more pacakage searching, I found that the gcc-snapshot package had the two files I was missing. This is probably a massive hammer for my tiny nail, and there are likely better solutions, but sudo apt-get install gcc-snapshot got me the files I needed.\n\n*After running ldd again, this resolved the issue with libgcc_s.so.1, but libstdc++.so.6 was still not found. I ended up going to the place where ldd found libgcc_s.so.1 and running sudo ln -s /usr/lib/gcc-snapshot/lib32/libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6 to get a symlink to the recently installed file.\n\n", "Q: Will it be possible to develop ubuntu phone apps on ubuntu phones? I was hoping that the ubuntu phone would bring true convergence of desktop and mobile operating systems and allow me to ditch all my other devices.

I dreamed of developing ubuntu phone apps on an ubuntu phone.\nI can only find ubuntu SDK downloads for desktop versions of ubuntu.\nAm I just missing something? If it's not possible, is this at all intended? Is there any official statement on the matter?\n\nA: Full convergence is not yet implemented, and even when it is, many things still will not be entirely feasible on commodity phone hardware, simply due to available resources. When that convergence story is complete, it may be possible to install the SDK directly on the phone, but depending on the hardware you have, it may not actually be feasible to use it; just as it is currently not entirely feasible to use many of the applications on an Ubuntu PC, on extremely low end, or older, hardware.\nThat said, you can create a chroot install of Ubuntu in the home directory of the phone, and install all the console tools needed to develop and build an application.

I'd like somebody could tell what is currently the best solution to play youtube videos with a desktop app?\nI like minitube app but since 2015 Google updates its policy so often so the app seems to be redundant or left to constant updates. I tried lots of ppas all of them reached up to 2.3.1 version max. \nAnd as of today SMtube browser in SMPlayer stopped working at all, Google reconstructed their API completely, so as its developer said regardly SMtube needs to be completely rebuild and not sure if that's gonna happen soon.\nOther suggestions I heard is to use the new engine fork of mplayer mpv+youtube-dl. Does anybody managed to do so? I would appreciate if somebody explain any tutorial on that.

This is how you can do it: in Youtube Viewer navigate to \"Menu\" --> \"Preferences\", you'll get a script opened, find these lines:\nvideo_player_selected      => \"mplayer\",\nvideo_players              => {\n                            mplayer => {\n                              arg   => \"-prefer-ipv4 -really-quiet-cache %d -cache-min %d\",\n                              audio => \"-audiofile *AUDIO*\",\n                              cmd   => \"/usr/bin/mplayer\",\n                              fs    => \"-fs\",\n                              srt   => \"-sub *SUB*\",\n                            },\n                            mpv => {\n                              arg   => \"--really-quiet\",\n\nthen simply change the line:\ncmd   => \"/usr/bin/mplayer\",\n\nto e.g.:\ncmd   => \"/usr/bin/smplayer\",\n\nNext open SMPlayer and navigate to \"SMPlayer Preferences\" --> \"Network\" tab and put the marks at Enable Youtube internal support and Enable MPV's support for streaming sites that's it. Now go back to Youtube Viewer and click on any video it will launch it with SMPlayer.\nEdit\nA small fix/improvement when using SMPlayer if you want to avoid breaking a link into threads when clicking on the video to play remove this argument line from mplayer section:\narg   => \"-prefer-ipv4 -really-quiet -cache %d -cache-min %d\",\n\n\nA: I found 3 Options:\n1 Install Kodi app and use the YouTube addon works very smooth\n2 Install smplayer and smtube \n3 Install chrome browser and use an extension call user agent swticher this addon forces chrome and firefox to use ur browser as a mobile browser and youtube loads pretty fast!

(normally even 480p doesn't run real smooth). Nice: Fully integrated in Firefox.\n\n*YouTube Browser for SMPlayer: Runs 720p completeley smooth and switching timeline is absolutley smooth as well. (SMPlayer can be made more beautiful with just selecting another icon set)\n\n*QMPlay2 this is hot: It runs 1080p quite smooth on my laptop (!!! wouah). I just have an 1366x768 display, so 720p youtube is quite good, but 1080p is noticeley better (also because youtube doesn't provide top bitrate for each resolution, so e.g. if you have a full hd monitor, your 1440p youtube will look significant better than 1080p and even 4k has a small improvement to 1440p on an 1080p display, esspecially on fast scenes).

When I want to log into my account, Ubuntu claims my password is wrong.\nEven after a fresh install, Ubuntu still does not accept my password at login.\nWhat is wrong here and how should I proceed?\n\nA: Do you use symbols or special letters in your password? I once had a problem with the same symptoms you described. In my case, I set Ubuntu's keyboard layout during the installation to the correct setting (German for me) and entered my password into the installation wizard with the correct German layout.\nAfter the initial reboot I wanted to login again and Ubuntu refused to accept the password. \nI tried to open the on-screen keyboard (from the accessibility menu - that is the stick-man symbol in your panel on top of your screen) and saw that a completely different keyboard layout was set, so of course I was unable to enter the correct password, as the labels on my keyboard did not match the characters they were interpreted as.\nTo log in, you can just use this on-screen keyboard and enter the password by clicking.\nAnother possibility would be to reinstall it again (or at least remember this for the next installation!) and just use a password like \"123456789\". Numbers only is the best, because they should be placed on the same buttons in every keyboard layout. \nOf course you will not have to use the simple password from now on or type it always on-screen. Once you managed to login, you must go to the System Settings and correctly chose your keyboard layout. This time the setting will stay persistent and you should be able to log in in future without any problems.\n", "Q: How to copy a Ubuntu repository on a hard disk?

How can I pipe grep output as an argument to the cd command?\nFor example:\n[root@xxx xxx]# pip install django | grep '/usr.*'  \nRequirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): django in   /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages\n\nHere /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages is highlighted and I want to pass this string to cd.\n\nA: Depending on what you do and don't know beforehand about what pip will output, you might decide to grep for something other than /usr.*.\nIf you know the directory starts with /usr (and that it appears at the end of the line of output from pip, and that /usr does not appear anywhere on the line before the directory name), then that's a fine choice; heemayl's answer tells you how.\nIf the reason you know it starts with /usr is that you have just run the command and know the directory you want to change to, I suggest the simpler solution of running the command cd /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages. This is less typing even if you don't make use of tab completion.\nOtherwise, you might choose a different regexp depending on what you know about the output being parsed. All the alternatives below still assume the directory name appears at the end of the line, but the other assumptions vary.\nIf you know the directory name is absolute (i.e., starts with a /) and no / appears on the line before the directory name, you can use the same regexp as in heemayl's answer but with / instead of /usr:\ncd \"$(pip install django | grep -o '/.*')\"\n\nThis matches a / followed by zero or more (*) of any character (.).\nIf you know the directory name contains no horizontal whitespace (no spaces or tabs) and appears at the end of the line, you can use:\ncd \"$(pip install django | grep -oP '[^\\h]+$')\"\n\nHere I've used a Perl regexp (-P) because the \\h abbreviation (for [:blank:]) makes this easier to type and to read than an equivalent extended regexp (-E). This matches one or more (+) of any character in a class of characters ([ ]) that is not (^) a space or tab (\\h).\nIf you know the directory name is immediately preceded by in surrounded by horizontal whitespace (i.e., padded on both the left and the right with blanks), and that this is the only such occurrence of in on the line, you can use:\ncd \"$(pip install django | grep -oP '\\hin\\h+\\K.+')\"\n\nThis uses a zero-width positive look-behind assertion (\\K) to match one or more characters (.+) that appear after a space or tab (\\h), in, and another one or more spaces or tabs (\\h+), without actually including in and the blank spaces surrounding it in the match. Look-around assertions are a feature of Perl regular expressions.\nThe pattern \\h+in\\h+\\K.+ would have worked also, but we only need to look for one blank before in, regardless of how many are present. In contrast, we must match all the blanks after in, or they wouldn't be discarded by \\K and they would be matched as part of the directory name.\nIf you know the directory name is immediately preceded by the line's last occurrence of in followed by horizontal whitespace, you can use:\nset +H\ncd \"$(pip install django | grep -oP '\\hin\\h+(?!.*\\hin\\h.*)\\K.*')\"\nset -H\n\nThere, the zero-width positive look-behind assertion itself contains a zero-width negative look-ahead assertion ((?! )).\nThe ! appears in such a way as to be difficult to escape elegantly; the method I have used to prevent it from triggering shell history expansion before being passed to grep is to temporarily disable history expansion (set +H) before running the command and re-enable it (set -H) afterwards. If you're using this in a script and your script doesn't contain set -H, you don't need to do this as history expansion is enabled automatically only when a shell runs interactively.\nFinally, note that none of these, nor heemayl's answer, are actually piping the output of grep to cd (though the output of pip is still being piped to grep). Rather than pipes, the appropriate tool for this job is command substitution.\n\nA: Use Bash's command substitution $(), you also need -o with grep to only select the matched portion:\ncd \"$(pip install django | grep -o '/usr.*')\"\n\nNote that although you will get away in this case but you should always enclose the command substitution with double quotes so that the shell does not perform word splitting on whitespaces (by default space, tab and newline, depends on the IFS variable in case of bash).\n", "Q: How do I bring back the \"Lower\" option when middle clicking on the title bar in Ubuntu 15.04?

But I still have to upgrade my laptop to Ubuntu 15.04 so if I run in the same problem I will definitely test the solution from below.\nEdit 2:\nSo I finaly got around to upgrade my laptop to Ubuntu 15.04 and I runned into the same problem so I gave the first fix from @Shengolol a try. And I can tell you that it did work :D.\nSo thanks a lot Shengolol :).\n\nA: Yesterday I stumbled into the same problem. I upgraded from 14.10 to 15.04 and during the upgrade I got the same errors as you get. Luckily I was able to pinpoint the cause of the issue. There are two ways to fix this:\n\nFirst way (EASY) Go to the terminal and execute the command sudo groupdel input. Now run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.\n\nOnly read the second way if you are interested in the cause of the issue or if the first way didn't work.\n\nSecond way (I just posted this to explain the issue)\nA certain line in the dpkg configuration script is the problem, we\n  want to delete this line. First open the file via terminal:\nsudo nano /var/lib/dpkg/info/udev.postinst\n\nNow search for the line addgroup --quiet --system input and delete\n  it. This line is the first part of the config script. It adds the\n  group 'input' to your system. Strangely it crashes the whole script\n  when the group already exists. Obviously members of this group have\n  access to your systems input, but it isn't needed, as input also works\n  without this group. Save your edited file and run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.\n\nI hope this fixed the issue for you and will be helpful for other users in the future. Until this is fixed we have to apply one of the fixes everytime there is an update for udev.

But when I activate them, they replace the graphics driver also for regular booting of Ubuntu.\nSo right now I can choose between either a virtual machine with full graphic support but a genuine Ubuntu environment with a loud graphic fan and incomplete graphic support, or a virtual machine with no graphic support at all but a fully functional Ubuntu system. Switching requires re- or deinstalling fglrx each time.\nSo my question is:\nIs it possible to let the system switch between the fglrx driver and the Virtualbox-guest-addition-driver, depending on whether it is booted regularly or in a virtual machine?   \n\nA: I have managed to succeed in my efforts to get this undoubtedly exotic setup to work as I want it too.\nAfter a reinstall of Ubuntu, the problems with installed guest additions for the natively booted system disappeared.\nThe only remaining problem was being unable to login into the virtual machine desktop with fglrx drivers installed. Although the kernel modules always adopted correctly to the corresponding environment (vbox modules only running inside the virtual machine and fglrx module only running when booted natively) there seemed to be something still preventing the start of the desktop environment inside the virtual machine.\nThis turned out to be the AMD libglx libraries, which were still in use for the virtual machine. \nFortunately, the fglrx driver software provides an easy switch command from amd to intel, so all that needed to be done was executing   \nsudo /usr/lib/fglrx/switchlibglx intel\n\nand restart lightdm.\nTo have this executed automatically during boot, I created a file named \"checkvga.conf\" in /etc/init/ reading\n# Checks if VGA belongs to virtual machine\n\ndescription      \"Checks if VGA belongs to virtual machine\"\n\n\nstart on starting lightdm\n\n\nscript\n    if test -f /proc/modules &&  grep -q vboxguest /proc/modules 2>/dev/null; then\n    /usr/lib/fglrx/switchlibglx intel\n    restart lightdm\n    fi\nend script\n\nI had to put in the \"restart lightdm\" command to get it to work reliable, although I originally had assumed that \"start on starting lightdm\" would have been enough to have this command executed before lightdm was launched the first time. The reason might be that actually, X is required to be restarted, since there might have already been an instance of it to display the splash screen during boot.

Does the message mean that ruby has replaced it, and that I do not need it?\n\n\nA: rubygems is a virtual package, check the Ubuntu package archive. A virtual package is not an actual package, it has no .deb file associated with it. A group of packages that provide some generic functionalities are represented by using a virtual package so that any given package can depend on the virtual package rather than needing to know whats the actual package providing the functionalities.\nIn your case the virtual package is rubygems and the physical package is ruby.

It just does not appear on the screen.\n\nA: Before doing the next steps, remove any Spotify ppa's.\nInstall the Spotify ppa:\nsudo apt-add-repository -y \"deb http://repository.spotify.com stable non-free\" && sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 94558F59 && sudo apt-get update -qq && sudo apt-get install spotify-client\n\nThen install the following:\nwget http://ftp.au.debian.org/debian/pool/main/libg/libgcrypt11/libgcrypt11_1.5.0-5+deb7u2_amd64.deb\n\nsudo dpkg -i libgcrypt11_1.5.0-5+deb7u2_amd64.deb\n\nEnjoy!\n\nA: This worked for me:\nwget http://security.debian.org/debian-security/pool/updates/main/libg/libgcrypt11/libgcrypt11_1.5.0-5+deb7u3_amd64.deb\n\nsudo dpkg -i libgcrypt11_1.5.0-5+deb7u3_amd64.deb\n\nsource: \nhttp://www.burakgon.com/2015/04/how-to-fix-error-while-loading-shared-libraries-libgcrypt-so-11-cannot-open-shared-object-file-error-on-ubuntu-15-04/\n\nA: There is a tutorial so you can fix it (beneath reinstalling).\nJust execute these two commands, it worked for me:\n$ wget http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/libg/libgcrypt11/libgcrypt11_1.5.4-2ubuntu1.1_amd64.deb\n$ sudo dpkg -i libgcrypt11_1.5.4-2ubuntu1.1_amd64.deb\n\nLink to the source/tutorial:\nhttp://dgzen.pw/2015/04/21/installing-spotify-in-ubuntu-15-04/\n\nA: Installing libgcrypt11 is said to involve security issues (see this Spotify forum post which links to this NVD page).\nAs mentioned in the Spotify forum post linked above, it's probably better to use the testing version of the Spotify client, available for download on this repository-origin.spotify.com page.\nIt's not ideal either, but probably the best option.\n\nA: Your version of Spotify uses a library called libgcrypt11 which was replaced in Ubuntu 15.04 by libgcrypt20. \nA version of Spotify that doesn't require libgcrypt11 is available in the testing repository. That is the Spotify that eventually (after it has been tested and any serious bugs have been fixed) will replace the one from the stable repository you have now. \nEdit your software sources to change the Spotify repository from stable to testing and then update your Spotify client. \nSome things will be different from before, for better or worse, but at least it starts. \n", "Q: gnome-terminal is getting environment variables that other terminals don't This is obviously easy to fix, I just want to understand it.  I know Linux, but I'm not very familiar with Ubuntu.\ngnome-terminal is getting environment variables that other terminals (xterm, rxvt-unicode, Linux console) are not.  In particular, gnome-terminal gets http_proxy, https_proxy, ftp_proxy, all_proxy, and all caps versions of those.  Those variables are not in /etc/profile, /etc/profile.d/*, /etc/environment.  \n\nA: It is gnome-terminal itself that sets these variables. The relevant code resides in gnome-terminal's source, src/terminal-util.c, method terminal_util_add_proxy_env(). The values are taken from Gnome's settings, and the feature serves the purpose to have Gnome's proxy settings take effect on as many apps/utilities as possible, including console ones.\n", "Q: Format partitions 5 and 6 when installing?

My computer suspends and resumes with no trouble, however every time I resume, after about 30 seconds the computer goes back into suspend. If I resume, the same pattern continues.\nSuspending from virtual console (ctrl+alt+F2) using sudo pm-suspend does not cause the same problem, and I can safely switch to ctrl+alt+F2, suspend, then switch back to ctrl+alt+F7 without running into the auto-suspend problem.\nHowever, if I suspend from the graphical screen (ctrl+alt+F7), and then switch to the virtual console, it will still automatically suspend. This happens even if within the virtual console I force a suspend before the computer automatically does it and resume, and stay within the virtual console. Every time the computer will automatically suspend again within about 30 seconds.\nThis makes my computer effectively unusable until I restart, after which it works fine (until I suspend from the graphical interface again, at which point I must restart).\nAny ideas on what might be wrong? I have a 2013 Razer Blade 14, which has always worked with previous version of Ubuntu. Thanks!\n\nA: I'm seeing the same problem on my Sony Vaio. Once I manage to get logged into the Lubuntu desktop, it stops suspending every 30 seconds. I think this is because xfce4-power-manager is taking over. \nHowever, if I switch to a console, it immediately suspends, and resumes its \"suspend after 30 seconds\" behavior. I also see the \"suspends after 30 seconds\" behavior on the default Unity desktop.\nI've found I can put an end to this behavior by making /sys/power/state non-writable (chmod 444), and I can get this to persist between boots by adding the chmod command to /etc/rc.local, before the \"cgroup\" commands.\nNow that I have made /sys/power/sleep non-writable, I'm seeing evidence in syslog of what's going on. Every 30 seconds, I see this: \nApr 28 11:08:48 socrates systemd-sleep[8831]: Failed to open /sys/power/state: Permission denied\nI'm also seeing other writes to syslog every 30 seconds related to whatever is trying to put the system to sleep, starting with:\nApr 28 11:31:10 socrates NetworkManager[825]: <info> sleep requested (sleeping: no enabled: yes)\nAfter the \"Permission denied\" error, there are a bunch of messages from NetworkManager waking back up, named reloading its configuration, etc.\nThese writes to syslog only occur when I'm on the virual console, and stop when I switch back to the Lubuntu desktop.\nUpdate: Issues mostly resolved by switching back to Upstart, as detailed here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SystemdForUpstartUsers\nStill seeing this every 30 seconds in syslog:\nApr 28 12:45:51 socrates dbus[775]: [system] Activating service name='org.freedesktop.systemd1' (using servicehelper)\nThis is followed by anacron running.

Failing that, how to uninstall Ubuntu so that I can try it again?\n\nA: Sorry I can't paste links here from my device.

I've reinstalled many times, and now I'm having trouble booting from disk 0. Booting is very slow, and hangs unless I bring up the boot manager and select disk 0. The Boot Manager entry used to boot Windows, but doesn't anymore. I also can't boot from my USB drive anymore.\nI believe this is because the boot information is a little screwed up. In one of my many reinstalls, a Ubuntu link somehow was added to Windows Boot Manager - I think by boot-repair, though I'm not sure. Despite deleting all partitions in DiskPart, running Clean, and recreating everything, that Ubuntu entry is still there. So I think the data is corrupted, but I can't figure out how to clear it.\nWhy is the boot manager data not cleared when I delete every partition on the disk and run \"clean\"? Where is this information stored? Is EasyBCD the only way to access and edit this data?\n\nA: I fixed the BCD problem with BCDEdit - the command line version that comes with Windows. But I still can't figure out why deleting all the partitions and running the \"clean\" command doesn't delete the database. I read that the database is stored in the hidden system partition. So if the partition is blown away, how is the data retained?? Mysterious.\nI have a working dual boot now - two disks, both using UEFI and GPT partitioning. But I have Setup configured to allow both UEFI and BIOS because otherwise I can't boot from USB drives. \nI added a Ubuntu entry to the Windows boot manager. That chains to Grub2 which loads Ubuntu. But it's more efficient to do it the other way - boot into Grub2 and select Windows if I want it. Originally that went to a second menu, too - the Windows boot selection menu - containing just one item: Windows 10 Technical Preview. I got it to bypass the second menu and boot straight into Windows with this command, issued from the command line as an administrator:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} displaybootmenu no\nEverything is working now.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 with Cinnamon desktop missing trash can icon on desktop Missing Trash can desktop icon on Ubuntu 14.10 with Cinnamon GUI.

Ubuntu will now automatically try to find hardware and their additional drivers and packages to have a better more stable (hopefully) system with less user hassle. For example in 14.10 nvidia optimus GPU drivers had to be installed from a separate PPA but in 15.04 the system knows that they are there and they show up in additional drivers section. \nAs for what the microcode is:\n\nThe microcode data file contains the latest microcode definitions for all Intel processors. Intel releases microcode updates to correct processor behavior as documented in the respective processor specification updates. While the regular approach to getting this microcode update is via a BIOS upgrade, Intel realizes that this can be an administrative hassle. The Linux Operating System and VMware ESX products have a mechanism to update the microcode after booting. \n\nFrom: https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/14303/Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-File\nWhich basically means that Ubuntu is getting driver updates (performance enhancements and bug fixes) from intel to make your system run better.

So, I rebooted.\nEven after rebooting, with no cable connection of any kind, then running xrandr, I continue to get a VGA is connected message.\nWhat can I correct this?\n\nA: You have to add a new mode with a new resolution...\nYou can do it and apply the new resolution using the command:\nxrandr --addmode <connection_type> 1200x1000_60.00\n\nWhere <connection_type> is usually VGA1, DP1 or HDMI1. \n\nA: I guess VGA1 is your laptop screen.

For instance, the exploit in the jdk package has a cvss v2 base value of 10.0 (follow link to NVD here), highest possible, but the priority from ubuntu view is only \"medium\", whereas heartbleed with cvss v2 base of 5.0 got a priority of \"high\".\nIs this priority field just a result of human investigation or do I mix anything?\n\nA: There's also the consideration of installed base and usage. Bash is present on practically every Ubuntu installation out there, is at the heart of an extremely large number of scripts, whereas Java ... not so much. I'd any day grant a higher priority to a bash exploit than a Java exploit. (And to hear people speak of it, Java exploits pop up every now and then anyway.)\n\nThe Security Team Wiki links to the CVE Tracker's README, which describes the priorites:\nnegligible        Something that is technically a security problem, but is\n                  only theoretical in nature, requires a very special\n                  situation, has almost no install base, or does no real\n                  damage.  These tend not to get backport from upstreams,\n                  and will likely not be included in security updates unless\n                  there is an easy fix and some other issue causes an update.\n\nlow               Something that is a security problem, but is hard to\n                  exploit due to environment, requires a user-assisted\n                  attack, a small install base, or does very little damage.\n                  These tend to be included in security updates only when\n                  higher priority issues require an update, or if many\n                  low priority issues have built up.\n\nmedium            Something is a real security problem, and is exploitable\n                  for many people.  Includes network daemon denial of service \n                  attacks, cross-site scripting, and gaining user privileges.\n                  Updates should be made soon for this priority of issue.\n\nhigh              A real problem, exploitable for many people in a default\n                  installation.  Includes serious remote denial of services,\n                  local root privilege escalations, or data loss.\n\ncritical          A world-burning problem, exploitable for nearly all people\n                  in a default installation of Ubuntu.  Includes remote root\n                  privilege escalations, or massive data loss.\n\nIn this case, Shellshock was a bug affecting a software that's part of the default installation - bash. Therefore, it's high priority.\nAs far as I can tell, the priority is set by people during bug triaging.\n", "Q: Error when trying to install Steam on 14.04 LTS I just started using Ubuntu and am trying to install Steam, but I get the error messsage\n\nyou are missing the following 32-bit libraries, and Steam may not run:\n  libc.so.6\n\nWhat does this mean? \n\nA: Do those commands:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n\nthen:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThen install libc\nsudo apt-get install libc-bin:i386\n\n", "Q: Bash script to rename files in a directory I am trying to write a script that takes a directory as a command line parameter and iterates over the files in the directory changing their extension to .bu .\nI thought this would work but I'm getting the output '.bu' is not a target directory\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor  f in $1; do\n  mv \"$f\".* .bu\ndone\n\n\nA: Try that instead (assuming that $1 is a folder):\nfor f in $1/*; do \n  mv \"$f\" \"$f.bu\"\ndone\n\nOr use the rename utility:\nrename -v 's/$/\\.bu/' $1/*\n\nThose commands add an extension.

I read that first sector on any partition needs to be reserved for bootloader, regardless of weather it is used or not. But sector sizes changed from 512 to 4096 bytes. So how much space must really be reserved?\n\nA: First, you don't need to worry about such details unless you're designing filesystems, filesystem utilities, etc.; system tools like mkfs create the filesystems you ask in the appropriate way, no matter what the filesystem type. (If they don't, then that constitutes a bug.)\nIf you're asking about this out of curiosity, then you've pretty much answered your own question: If the first sector must be reserved, then the number of bytes reserved depends on the sector size of the device under discussion. If the data structure, such as a filesystem, uses bytes rather than sectors as its primary unit of measure, then it will either reserve enough bytes to cover all likely sector sizes or risk damage should some tool overwrite its entire first sector on a disk with over-512-byte sectors.\nOne more point: Although reserving the first sector (or sometimes several sectors) for boot loader code is common, I don't believe it's universal -- certainly not when you count non-filesystem partitions. An extended partition, for instance, stores partition data in its first sector. Although there's room there that's unused, a partition boot loader that used the whole of the first sector would trash an extended partition. I've heard that putting a boot loader in a Linux swap partition will cause problems, but I've never investigated this in any depth.\n", "Q: Can Ubuntu 32-bit access 8GB RAM?

Is there a way to utilise all 8GB of RAM with a 32-bit Ubuntu install? Does Ubuntu do this out of the box?\n\nA: \nDoes Ubuntu do this out of the box?\n\nUbuntu will automatically turn on Physical Address Extension (PAE) if it is available; otherwise it will not even install.\nWikipedia, important parts (see the link for more):\n\nIn computing, Physical Address Extension (PAE) is a memory management feature for the IA-32 architecture, first introduced in the Pentium Pro. It defines a page table hierarchy of three levels, with table entries of 64 bits each instead of 32, allowing these CPUs to access a physical address space larger than 4 gigabytes (232 bytes).\nLinux\nThe Linux kernel includes full PAE mode support starting with version 2.3.23,enabling access of up to 64 GB of memory on 32-bit machines. A PAE-enabled Linux kernel requires that the CPU also support PAE. The Linux kernel supports PAE as a build option and major distributions provide a PAE kernel either as the default or as an option.\nLinux distributions now commonly use a PAE-enabled kernel as the default, a trend that began in 2009. As of 2012 many, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux / CentOS, Ubuntu have stopped distributing non-PAE kernels, thus making PAE hardware mandatory.\n\n", "Q: Problem in installing mysql2 in ubuntu 14.04 in virtual box When I run this command, I got this error \n$ sudo gem install mysql2\nBuilding native extensions.

The rest is just for formating needs, replace / in file names to space, and cut away the path to those files, leaving filenames themselves.\nThe !/#/ part is to address possibly commented out start directives, which I had personally added manually. \nAmong other things,there is /etc/rc2.d where (if I understand correctly ) you have lesser priority scripts. \nCrude one-liner for that is:\nls /etc/rc2.d/* | grep S | awk '{sub(\"S\",\" \"); print $2}\nScripts that in that folder that actually run on runlevel 2 are named starting with S and followed by priority number.

Here are the known issues. All of which affect every Ubuntu flavour.\n**You may not be able to enter your pass phrase if you use full disk encryption.\n    LP: #1386005**\n\n\nA: I had this issue with 16.04.1. The workaround is to edit grub settings to use \"nosplash\" instead of \"splash\". (Note that simply removing \"splash\" does not fix the problem, at least in my case.)\nFrom grub you can do this for the current boot by pressing e on the menu, and then searching for the line that says splash (should be close to the end), and then hit F10 to boot.\nInstead of getting the graphical progress display and passphrase prompt you'll get a text-based prompt, and your keyboard should work. (On my machine I'll still occasionally get a blank screen instead of the prompt, but entering my passphrase at this screen still works, despite the lack of feedback.)\nIf this works for you, you can edit /etc/default/grub (again, change \"splash\" to \"nosplash\") and run update-grub.\nEven with this setting, my machine (still running 16.04 LTS) will occasionally give me a blank screen (very dark gray, but slightly light lighter than the black of the BIOS startup) instead of the passphrase prompt. It turns out that you can still enter your passphrase at this point, though there will be no feedback unless you enter it correctly. (In my case, the drive light starts blinking, and the screen \"unblanks\" to continue the boot process.) This happens for about 25% of reboots. Thankfully, I don't reboot that often.\n\nA: I was struggling with this and in some page I saw something about this and drivers AMD... and then I remembered that when I installed Ubuntu on my fresh last install and use the full encryption all was working fine until I installed the AMD propietary drivers. So, I decided to switch from AMD drivers to Xorg and it just work. I don't know what does it have to do but it just work for me.

About a week ago Firefox started crashing very frequently, 20 to 30 times a day. On random pages, doing random things, sometimes even when it is minimised. I ran the updates and checked the system for malware with rkhunter. After trying that and a few more suggestions from the Firefox help pages without visible results, I submitted a report to the Firefox Forum.\nMeanwhile other programmes such as Eclipse or pgAdmin started hanging occasionally (but not crashing). But this morning Rhythmbox started yielding a similar behaviour: it crashed some 20 times in little over on hour, to the point I had to switch to VLC for audio playing.\nNow, before I go through the painstaking process of submitting a crash report to the Rythmbox folk, I would like to understand if there isn't something wrong with the system itself that may be prompting these crashes. /var/log/messages is empty and dmesg shows nothing extraordinary, even though I am not sure what should I look for.\nWhat else could I try to guarantee the system is not struggling with something?\nUpdate\nI ran the memory test and it reported a few errors.

Thanks a lot!\n\nA: You can choose another kernel at the beginning of the booting sequence, maybe your old 14.04 one.\nOr you can run terminal/x-term etc., chroot to the directory (chroot /mnt (in case you have mounted your root filesystem there)) and install the old kernel, which should be sufficient in your case.\nYou can also install a new kernel from here:\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/ \nBe sure to add a newer or older kernel, it sometimes doesn't work at all.\nFor example, you could download the kernel from here:\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.18.12-vivid/ \nOr you can try any directory you desire. If you have AMD64 architecture, you can download the kernels with generic and amd64.\nI don't have the necessary reputation to write it all for you. In directory, you have downloaded these kernels (be sure you are chrooted and that they are in the same location) run:\ndpkg -i *.deb  \nI hope it works for you.\n", "Q: why my mouse pointer is blinking and suddenly disapear recently I have installed the new ubuntu 15.04 and my pointer starts to blink and when I open an application it disapear.

We're deploying an Active Directory domain controller slash file server in a small NGO, using Ubuntu Server/Samba and a conventional HDD, due to budgetary concerns.\nI'm concerned about the dismal random 4K access rate of conventional spinning drives when it comes to downloading and uploading Windows roaming profiles. So, I'm thinking about getting a very small SSD for caching purposes. Network bandwidth is 1G, so anything beyond ~100MBps is wasted, therefore the larger files (which are accessed more sequentially) should be excluded from the SSD cache.\nCan we configure dm-cache to cache only files below certain file sizes on the caching SSD?\n\nA: So, to answer my own question: I found the required information in the documentation of dm-cache, more precisely in cache-policies.txt.\nAccording to the documentation, dm-cache differentiates between random and sequential transfers right out of the box. To cite cache-policies.txt:\n\nMessage and constructor argument pairs are:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*'sequential_threshold <#nr_sequential_ios>'\n  \n*'random_threshold <#nr_random_ios>'\n  \n*'read_promote_adjustment '\n  \n*'write_promote_adjustment ' \n  \n*'discard_promote_adjustment '\n  \n  \n  The sequential threshold indicates the number of contiguous I/Os\n  required before a stream is treated as sequential.  The random\n  threshold is the number of intervening non-contiguous I/Os that must\n  be seen before the stream is treated as random again.\nThe sequential and random thresholds default to 512 and 4\n  respectively.\nLarge, sequential ios are probably better left on the origin device\n  since spindles tend to have good bandwidth. The io_tracker counts\n  contiguous I/Os to try to spot when the io is in one of these\n  sequential modes.\n\nThis is different from file-level differentiation (which the original question asked for), since presumably randomly read blocks from fragmented large files will also be cached. But this is a similarly feasible (and indeed, much more robust) solution to the problem. So, the original question wrongly assumed that the caching solution works with files; in fact it works on the level of file system blocks.\n", "Q: Cairo dock startup issues on ubuntu 15.04 Cairo Dock doesn't start on startup, I always have to start it automatically.\n\nA: Solved in comments:\n\nRun this command: ls ~/.config/autostart –  Tim\nThere is no output with that –  nana\nRun this command: ls /usr/share/applications/ | grep cairo –  Tim\nThe output: cairo-dock-cairo.desktop and cairo-dock.desktop –   nana\nRun this command cp /usr/share/applications/cairo ~/.config/autostart/ –  Tim\n\nThe issue was the launcher wasn't in the autostart folder.

Background\nDuring my periodic auditing of installed packages, I encountered an error. For this auditing, an application generates a graph of installed packages, using dpkg-query. During this process, it checks in the while, all dependencies are indeed satisfied, as this would otherwise mean either something is wrong in the system or something is wrong with the application generating the graph. It happened today the application stopped on an error, telling it found a package with an unsatisfied dependency to python:any. However, the depending package is fine. I checked python:any is a virtual package provided by the package python. Synaptic says python provides python:any, but my application don't receive this information from dpkg-query.\nHere is a test you may execute from the command line, which show the issue (assuming Ubuntu 14.04):\n$ dpkg-query --showformat='${Package}\\n${Provides}\\n' --show python3\n> python3\n> python3-profiler\n# Note `python3:any` does not appear\n\nAbout the same package, Synaptic says it provides python3:any and python3-profiler. The former is missing from the informations returned by dpkg-query.\nWhen appearing as a dependency, it's fine:\n$ dpkg-query --showformat='${Package}\\n${Depends}\\n' --show apturl-common\n# Note the second item in the format is now `Depends`\n> apturl-common\n> python3:any (>= 3.3.2-2~), python3-apt, python3-update-manager\n\nQuestion\nIs this a bug in dpkg-query? Or is this me erroneously expecting it to tell about all virtual packages while I may be supposed to infer this kind of virtual packages “myself”? Are they some rules I don't know about what is returned in ${Provides}?\n\nA: python3:any (>= 3.3.2-2~) is not a virtual package, it's a substitution string created by the ${python3:Depends} pattern and filled by dh_python3 when called from dh_gencontrol when the package was built. Take a look at the debian/control file of the apturl source package:\nPackage: apturl-common\nArchitecture: any\nDepends: ${python3:Depends},\n ${shlibs:Depends},\n ${misc:Depends},\n python3-apt,\n python3-update-manager\nReplaces: apturl (<< 0.3.6ubuntu2)\nDescription: install packages using the apt protocol - common data\n AptUrl is a simple graphical application that takes an URL (which follows the\n apt-protocol) as a command line option, parses it and carries out the\n operations that the URL describes (that is, it asks the user if he wants the\n indicated packages to be installed and if the answer is positive does so for\n him).\n\nNow why python3:any? Let's quote the debian policy:\n\nSpecifying only any indicates that the source package isn't dependent\n  on any particular architecture and should compile fine on any one. The\n  produced binary package(s) will be specific to whatever the current\n  build architecture is.\n\nAnd this is exactly the case for the python3 binary package:\nPackage: python3\nArchitecture: any\nMulti-Arch: allowed\nPre-Depends: python3-minimal (= ${binary:Version})\nDepends: python3.4 (>= 3.4.3-1), libpython3-stdlib (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}, dh-python\nSuggests: python3-doc (>= ${binary:Version}), python3-tk (>= 3.4.3-1) , python3-venv (>= ${binary:Version})\nReplaces: python3-minimal (<< 3.1.2-2)\nProvides: python3-profiler\nDescription: interactive high-level object-oriented language (default python3 version)\n Python, the high-level, interactive object oriented language,\n includes an extensive class library with lots of goodies for\n network programming, system administration, sounds and graphics.\n .\n This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default\n Python 3 version (currently v3.4).\n\nSources: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Architecture\n\n*https://alioth.debian.org/scm/loggerhead/pkg-python/python3-defaults-debian/view/head:/debian/control#L17\n\nA: I feel to guess an anwser, still feel free to add your own anwser.\nI've learned there is a /var/lib/dpkg/available database, as raw‑text. I checked for python3 (to go on with the same example as in the question) it says Provides: python3-profiler: there is no python3:any.\nSo may be the anwser is: there is not always a direct match between a requirements returned by dpkg-query and a package provided as returned by dpkg-query too, and probably Synaptic infers a “fake” virtual package, and python3:any is not really a virtual package (I would say Synaptic is misleading here).\nMost probably there is nothing with de provided packages, and it's me who is erroneously reading :xyz at the end of a package dependencies as part of the packag name, while it's not.\n", "Q: Do I need a bootloader in my existing hard disk to boot from USB?

The larger change that comes with Ubuntu 15.04 is the switch from upstart to systemd as the default for managing boot and system service startup.\nCould anyone adequately explain to a non-technical user how and if this affect us at all? And why it is important? \n\nA: As others have already noted here, in theory, this shouldn't affect the non-technical end user - and in theory there is no difference between theory and practice but in practice there is.\nClarification\nI think few things posted here need some clarification:\n\nIt's an init system, not something users traditionally interact with.\n\nIt was the case with SysV init and with Upstart but it's not the case with systemd any more. It does a lot of things that users traditionally interact with:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/tree/NEWS\n\n\nIt should completely replace the functionality provided by Upstart\n  —and do a few extra things\n\nTwo things to clarify - first about completely replacing Upstart:\nNo SysV init scripts\nOne of the issues that people have with systemd is that it doesn't run SysV init scripts. So there's one example that it doesn't completely replace the functionality provided by Upstart.\nThis is something that we could rely on for over 30 years and traditionally you wrote SysV init scripts for maximum portability without repeating yourself (by writing multiple versions of the same scripts), which is not the case any more.\nThis shouldn't be a problem when using only packages from official repositories because presumably all the packages that used to have either SysV init or Upstart scripts would need to have their scripts rewritten before they get packaged.\nIt will be only a problem for people who happen to use any third-party or custom software that have their init scripts written for either SysV init or for Upstart and those will need the init scripts rewritten before upgrading to a system with systemd (or get the upstart installed, which is also an option, or migrate to a system that doesn't use systemd).\nThere is systemd-sysv-generator that is supposed to automatically translate SysV init scripts to systemd scripts but there are some bugs and a long list of explicit incompatibilities.\nNow, the second clarification - about those few extra things:\nFew extra things\nThose \"few extra things\" that systemd is going to cover - according to A Perspective for systemd - What Has Been Achieved, and What Lies Ahead presentation \nby Lennart Poettering in 2014 at GNOME.asia - are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*init system\n\n*journal logging\n\n*login management\n\n*device management\n\n*temporary and volatile file management\n\n*binary format registration\n\n*backlight save/restore\n\n*rfkill save/restore\n\n*bootchart\n\n*readahead\n\n*encrypted storage setup\n\n*EFI/GPT partition discovery\n\n*virtual machine/container registration\n\n*container management\n\n*hostname management\n\n*locale management\n\n*time management\n\n*random seed management\n\n*sysctl variable management\n\n*console managment\n\n*introspection\n\n*auto discovery\n\n*plug and play\n\n*network management\n\n*systemd-networkd\n\n*DNS cache\n\n*mDNS responder\n\n*LLMNR responder\n\n*DNSSEC verification\n\n*IPC in the kernel\n\n*kdbus\n\n*sd-bus\n\n*time synchronisation with NTP\n\n*systemd-timesyncd\n\n*integration with containers\n\n*sandboxing of services\n\n*sandboxing of apps\n\n*OS image format\n\n*Container image format\n\n*App image format\n\n*GPT with auto-discovery\n\n*Stateless systems\n\n*instantiatable systems\n\n*factory reset\n\n*node initialisation and updates\n\n*integration with the cloud\n\n*service management across nodes\n\n*verifiable OS images all the way to the firmware\n\n*Boot Loading\n\n*Building the Internet’s Next Generation OS Unifying pointless differences between distributions\n\n\nSo going back to: \"It's an init system, not something users traditionally interact with.\" - it has to be pointed out that the init system is just one item on that list.\n\nAnd finally, the last thing I'd like to comment:\n\n[T]he only time a non-technical user will see this is when it goes wrong.\n\nOh, what a relief. :)\nChanges\nMost notable changes for end users (other than the scripts themselves) is starting and stopping services and using commands like:\n\n\n*\n\n*screen\n\n*tmux\n\n*nohup\nwhich no longer work as expected. For example, nohup is a POSIX command to make sure that the process keeps running after you log out from your session. It no longer works on systemd. Also programs like screen and tmux need to be invoked in a special way or otherwise the processes that you run with them will get killed (while not getting those processes killed is usually the main reason of running screen or tmux in the first place).\nThis is not a bug, it is a design choice, so it is not likely to get fixed in the future. This is what Lennart Poettering has said about this issue:\n\nIn my view it was actually quite strange of UNIX that it by default let arbitrary user code stay around unrestricted after logout. It has been discussed for ages now among many OS people, that this should possible but certainly not be the default, but nobody dared so far to flip the switch to turn it from a default to an option. Not cleaning up user sessions after logout is not only ugly and somewhat hackish but also a security problem.  systemd 230 now finally flipped the switch and finally by default cleans everything up correctly when the user logs out.\n\nFor more info see:\n\n\n*\n\n*Systemd Starts Killing Your Background Processes By Default\n\n*Systemd v230 kills background processes after user logs out, breaks screen, tmux\n\n*Debian Bug #825394: systemd kill background processes after user logs out\nRunning screen\n\n\n*\n\n*upstart: screen\n\n*systemd: systemd-run --user --scope screen\n(Note: the behavior of \"upstart\" above is really anything except systemd, this is not upstart specific)\nStarting job foo:\n\n\n*\n\n*upstart: start foo\n\n*systemd: systemctl start foo\nStopping job foo:\n\n\n*\n\n*upstart: stop foo\n\n*systemd: systemctl stop foo\nRestarting job foo:\n\n\n*\n\n*upstart: restart foo\n\n*systemd: systemctl restart foo\nListing jobs with their status:\n\n\n*\n\n*upstart: initctl list\n\n*systemd: systemctl status\n(See my answer to What are the pros/cons of Upstart and systemd? for more details that are out of the scope for this question.)\nLogs\nThere is also a big difference in handling the logs because contrary to the Unix tradition the logs of systemd are stored in binary files in a custom format, so instead of:\ncat /var/log/upstart/foo.log\ntail -f /var/log/upstart/foo.log\n\nyou need to use special commands to access your logs:\nsudo journalctl -u foo\nsudo journalctl -u foo -f\n\nControversies\nThe introduction of systemd first to Debian and later to Ubuntu was not without controversies and vast opposition as is known to anyone who wrote one of the following articles:\n\n\n*\n\n*Meet Devuan, the Debian fork born from a bitter systemd revolt (PCWorld)\n\n*Grab your pitchforks: Ubuntu to switch to systemd on Monday (The Register)\n\n*Linus Torvalds and others on Linux's systemd (ZDNet)\n\n*About the systemd controversy (Errata Security)\n\n\nThe official Debian position on systemd and the resulting controversy has led to the Exodus declaration in 2014 and ended with Ian Jackson's resignation.\nThe Init Freedom, Without-Systemd.org and Systemd-Free.org initiatives were born, with a lot of discussion on Hacker News.\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*Sad news today: systemd-resolved to be deployed in Ubuntu 16.10 by Paul Wouters\n\n*Arguments against systemd on Without Systemd\n\n*List of incompatibilities of systemd with SysV (official docs)\n\n*Re-enable Upstart on Ubuntu 15.04 by Derrik Diener\n\n*systemd sysv init compatibility mode: how it works and troubleshooting when it breaks\n\n*What are the pros/cons of Upstart and systemd? on unix.stackexchange.com\n\n\nA: Layman users shouldn't notice any change, by design. It's an init system, not something users traditionally interact with. It should completely replace the functionality provided by Upstart —and do a few extra things— but the only time a non-technical user will see this is when it goes wrong.\nUsers, sysadmins and developers who have been actively using and developing for Upstart are the people who need to address things. There is a migration document on the Ubuntu Wiki to help developers convert their init scripts, but users and sysops can carry on using Upstart by sticking with 14.04 (which is supported until 2019).\nThe reason and rationale for change really wasn't from Ubuntu's side. Canonical were happy enough with Upstart (their project) but many Debian users wanted to move to a modern init engine to get better concurrency at boot and better monitoring functionality across all services.\nThat meant a fight between various options (the rationales) and systemd eventually won.\nCanonical went along with Debian because it's easiest and probably best. They get to drop a project and aren't fighting upstream. It also brings us in line with other distributions (Red Hat, Fedora, etc) who are also moving to systemd. More focus and less duplication of effort.\ntl;dr To a non technical person, this shouldn't affect you at all. For Ubuntu it should mean less work and a better init system.\n\nA: \nCould anyone adequately explain to a non-technical user how and if this affect us at all?\n\nIn theory, this shouldn't affect the non-technical end user who doesn't get involved in the nitty gritty of how the system actually works.  In practice, there are a lot of things that you're going to see.\nHere's an incomplete list:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you had add-on softwares that used upstart job definition files for starting programs, they'll stop working.  You'll have to install (and possibly write but more commonly just nick off someone else who has already written) systemd service unit files.  Example: https://askubuntu.com/questions/613785\n\n*Various design assumptions by systemd developers about things like power management result in defaults that are at odds with what you might have become used to.  The systemd developers have very definite ideas about what should happen in response to the the lid switches on laptops, for example.\n\n*If you are using the nvidia proprietary display driver, then there are various design decisions in systemd that affect you.  Example: https://askubuntu.com/questions/613773\n\n*It's not really relevant when coming from upstart, as Ubuntu users have had a manual page telling them this for some years now, but I mention it for the non-Ubuntu users who might read this: Other Linux operating systems users coming from System 5 init+rc are bitten by the fact that systemd is only backwards compatible with System 5 rc.  Like upstart, and indeed most other systems, it professes, and supplies, no backwards compatibility with System 5 init and its configuration file /etc/inittab.So people who followed the advice from from the 30-some years of people advising \"Well, you can just edit this into /etc/inittab …\", or people who use softwares that followed that advice now have softwares that don't start at bootstrap.  Example: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/196197/5132\n\n*You cannot get to single-user mode via the systemd shutdown command, as you could with previous shutdown commands.  Aside from the fact that it's called rescue mode in systemd jargon, rescue mode is not considered a shut down state in the systemd worldview.  It's regarded as a running state.  shutdown now will power off the machine.  It's systemctl rescue to reach single-user mode in the systemd world.  Further reading:  https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/196471/5132\n\n*Further to that last subject: If you haven't thrown away the idea of run levels already, now is the time to do so.  Futher reading: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/196014/5132\n\n*You're going to have to be careful about following general systemd advice found by random WWW browsing, because you \"know\" that \"it's all systemd now\".  You're going to see people talking about running commands with the --user option to systemctl.  That doesn't apply to Ubuntu (yet).  upstart and systemd differ significantly in this area, and Ubuntu version 15 still uses the upstart per-session init rather than a systemd per-user instance.  So https://superuser.com/a/860598/38062 won't apply, for example.  ☺\n\n", "Q: No audio after updating to 15.04 Missing sound after updating form 14.10 to 15.04, installing \"Ubuntu restricted extras\" doesn’t help.

This persisted after I closed the Pi session (except for the task bar: it is gone).\nThis is what I did in the terminal:\npi@raspberrypi ~ $ startx\n\nX.Org X Server 1.12.4\nRelease Date: 2012-08-27\nX Protocol Version 11, Revision 0\nBuild Operating System: Linux 3.2.0-2-mx5 armv7l Debian\nCurrent Operating System: Linux raspberrypi 3.18.7+ #755 PREEMPT Thu Feb 12 17:14:31 GMT 2015 armv6l\nKernel command line: dma.dmachans=0x7f35 bcm2708_fb.fbwidth=656 bcm2708_fb.fbheight=416 bcm2708.boardrev=0xe bcm2708.serial=0xc4895bc4 smsc95xx.macaddr=B8:27:EB:89:5B:C4 bcm2708_fb.fbswap=1 sdhci-bcm2708.emmc_clock_freq=250000000 vc_mem.mem_base=0x1ec00000 vc_mem.mem_size=0x20000000  dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait\nBuild Date: 11 February 2015  09:31:17PM\nxorg-server 2:1.12.4-6+deb7u6 (Julien Cristau <jcristau@debian.org>) \nCurrent version of pixman: 0.33.1\n    Before reporting problems, check http://wiki.x.org\n    to make sure that you have the latest version.\nMarkers: (--) probed, (**) from config file, (==) default setting,\n    (++) from command line, (!!) notice, (II) informational,\n    (WW) warning, (EE) error, (NI) not implemented, (??) unknown.\n(==) Log file: \"/var/log/Xorg.0.log\", Time: Fri Apr 24 02:10:24 2015\n(==) Using system config directory \"/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d\"\nFATAL: Module g2d_23 not found.\n^Cxinit: connection to X server lost\n\nwaiting for X server to shut down Server terminated successfully (0).

Will a reboot on the Ubuntu machine get back the Ubuntu look, or will it make this permanent?\nThis is what my Firefox browser looks like now. Most noticeably, the tabs and scroll bars look different:\n\nEDIT: I fixed it by rebooting, but I'd still be interested to know why this happens.\n\nA: The Fix\nRebooting is sufficient to fix this, but not necessary. You can fix your desktop by logging out and back in. You would do this on the affected system, that is, the system whose desktop was messed up, the Ubuntu system that was used as the SSH client, not the Rapsberry Pi that was the SSH server. Note that just locking and unlocking the screen will not work--but logging out is enough.\nIf you're using Unity, it's likely running compiz --replace on the affected machine would also work and avoid the need to log out, but I recommend logging out and back in.\nRebooting fixed the problem because it involved logging out and back in. It's okay, but not necessary.\n\nWhat Happened\nWhen you use ssh -X and run a graphical program, the program:\n\n*\n\n*runs on the SSH server (here, the Raspberry Pi)\n\n*displays on the SSH client (here, your Ubuntu system)\n\nLXSession is LXDE's session manager. Running lxsession on the SSH server from within the ssh -X session starts a graphical LXDE session on the server using the client's display. This produces the two major changes you noticed:\nlxsession runs lxpanel. LXDE uses LXPanel as its panel. It somewhat resembles the Windows taskbar in that it has a single panel defaulting to the lower edge of the screen that, unless customized, has (a) a single nested menu openable from the left edge of the panel from which applications are placed in groups and (b) a window list inside the panel itself that facilitates switching between applications.\nlxsession runs openbox. LXDE uses Openbox as its window manager (see also this article and this page). Window managers control how windows are displayed; they are what allow you to switch, move, and resize windows; and they provide borders and styling. Your Unity interface uses the Compiz window manager. Because it was connected to the display on the SSH client, the openbox instance running on the SSH sever attempted to manage the windows on the SSH client.\nWhen you shut down and disconnected from the SSH server, all programs running on the SSH server that were using the SSH client's display stopped. The panel disappeared, as you observed. Openbox also stopped attempting to manage windows on the SSH client, but it had already displaced Compiz.\nOther Possible Fixes\nThose were the two major changes, but probably not the only ones. If you really wanted to know everything lsession ran, you could consult both its documentation and read the configuration files on the Raspberry Pi that it uses, or you could try replicating the problem and running pstree on the SSH server to see everything lxsession started. But this is unnecessary. Logging out and back in is sufficient to set everything right again. Rebooting, as you did, is also sufficient.\nBecause the major problem was that Compiz was no longer working properly, running compiz --replace on your Ubuntu system (the SSH client) would have fixed that. But logging out and back in is easy, simple, and doesn't require you to spend more time analyzing the problem.\nWhy You Didn't Find lxsession on the SSH Client\nAfter you closed the connection to the Raspberry PI (the SSH server), you tried the commands man lxsession and lxsession on your Ubuntu system that was the SSH client. You didn't have that manpage or that executable, however, because lxsession wasn't installed--or running--on the SSH client. It was running on the SSH server and some of the programs it ran affected the SSH client.\nIf this were a Lubuntu system or you had otherwise installed LXDE--or lxsession specifically--then you would have been able to view the manual page and run the program. This would not necessarily have been the same version of lxsession as you have on the Raspberry Pi. You can try SSHing to the Raspberry Pi and running man lxsession there. (Unless you are trying to reproduce the problem, I recommend against running lxsession on the Raspberry Pi.)\n\nWhat You Meant To Do\nYou could run X11 on Ubuntu without a session manager or even a window manager, and you could run ssh -X and then lxsession on the Raspberry Pi. With nothing like a existing X session already running, your desktop would not be disrupted. But I doubt this is what you want. You probably want one of three things:\n\n*\n\n*To run individual graphical programs that are installed on the SSH server through ssh -X. In that case, just run those programs, e.g., xclock, firefox, libreoffice. SSH will forward them to the GUI on the SSH client. (If you want to be able to disconnect and reconnect without quitting the program, then one of the next two options may interest you, but see this answer and that one.)\n\n*To run a persistent graphical desktop on the SSH server that you can disconnect from and connect to, without ending and restarting the desktop session. In that case, you won't want programs like lxsession to be limited to one SSH session or to directly use and rely on the SSH client's display. In this situation, one solution is to keep a graphical desktop running on the SSH server and connect to it from the client. This can be done, for example, with VNC or xrdp. (Remmina is a popular client.) Readers may need to ask new questions based on their specific situations, but see How do I set up xrdp session that reuses an existing session?\n\n*To make the SSH server fully manage a desktop on the SSH client. If you really want this, and you're already using a GUI on the client that you don't want to be disrupted--which is what happened to you--then you can run a second X server at the same time on the SSH client. Of these three options, I think this is the one you are least likely to want--though it is the most similar to what you did--and specific details of how to do it are beyond the scope of this answer. But see this question and that one.\n\n\nA: It was because you did lxsession& not just lxsession.\nWhen you put & at the end of a command, it will run in the background, so when you closed the session, the process was still active.\nThis is why rebooting fixed it as all the processes got shut down. including the background ones you created like lxsession&.\nMaybe next time try running it without the &.\n\nA: Rebooting fixes the problem, giving me a normal screen again:\n\nHowever, when I rebooted, I was shown a giant raspberry on my desktop momentarily, as would be seen when shutting down the Pi with a GUI started. (At this point, the raspberry pi was turned off and disconnected for quite some time.)\nSo, if anyone has this problem, rebooting your computer will fix it.\n", "Q: Yoga 3 Pro black screen on wakeup from sleep When I wakeup my computer from sleep there is a blank black screen with just the cursor.

Enable the service with this command:\nsystemctl enable lwsmd.service\n\nIt should give some feedback about creating some symlinks.\nThen reboot your comp and all should be working.\nI hope it was clear enough, and please forgive any typos...

Evidently, part of the upgrade to Ubuntu 15.04 involves an upgrade to gnome-terminal that removes the old feature that allows new terminal windows to be opened as a tab, instead of a new window.\nIf I had known this before the upgrade, I literally wouldn't have upgraded. Full stop. I manage many servers, and having an SSH client that allows new sessions in a tab is essential. Opening new windows for 15 servers is completely unmanageable. \nIn this screenshot, you can see the \"open sessions\" menu option.

I've got it running on my system now since gnome-terminal removed that tabs feature.\nIt's nearly identical but it's not missing features! Hooray!\n\n\nA: gnome-terminal is now so broken it is basically a bad joke. Profiles are difficult or impossible to manage, edit or delete.\nIf I ignore the recent transparency issues I got mate-terminal finally working by making my old profiles more accurate. Apparently mate-terminal now employs more stricter error checking mechanism and no longer work with undefined profile names ie. --tab-with-profile=Default only works in one profile (the first one.) Your next profile must be named differently (Default2 or for instance \"Servers\" like in my example below) and it must reflect in the new profile custom command.\nexample:\nmate-terminal --tab-with-profile=Servers -t \"server1\" -e \"ssh root@server1.domain.com -t screen -dRRS main\"\n--tab-with-profile=Servers -t \"server2\" -e \"ssh root@server2.domain.com -t screen -dRRS main\"\n\nBy using more precise Profile definitions and custom commands in mate-terminal I can ones again get all my profiles and 100 or so Tabs in good order up and re-connected with a click of a button :)\nGotto love the screen -dRRS main command. This allows you to reboot and return to your previous work with one click.

And for some reason (maybe it's just me), I'm not able to find where their binaries are nor their manpages (whereis prints no information). which gives no output. The commands themselves work just fine, though.\nI ran commands like find /bin bg, but with no hits. I also ran find / bg to cast a wide net.\n\nA: They are shell built-ins - you can get basic usage information by typing help fg or help jobs at the bash shell prompt, or more detailed information from the bash manpage.\n\nA: Adding to heemayl's answer, it's worth pointing out that fg, bg, and jobs have to be built into the shell, because they manipulate data structures in the shell's memory and/or the kernel state associated with the shell's process.  It would not be possible to write an external command that does what fg does.\nOther commands that have to be built in include cd,\neval,\nexec,\nexit,\nexport,\nhistory,\nread,\nset,\nsource (aka .),\nshift,\ntrap,\nulimit,\numask, \nand wait.  Your shell may have a longer list, depending on how much extended functionality it implements.  POSIX has a different, but overlapping, list of \"special built-in utilities\" -- I'm not sure why things like break and continue count as commands rather than control-structure keywords, or why POSIX doesn't consider things like umask must-build-in when they can't be implemented any other way.  (You could write a program called /bin/umask that called umask(2), but it would only change the setting for itself, not for subsequent processes created by the shell, so it wouldn't fulfill its specification.)\n\nA: You are not getting any files against those commands because they are shell (bash) built-ins, not separate executable files (e.g. binary files, scripts). Actually, shell built-ins are compiled into the shell executable; if you want you can check the source code to be sure of it. As which or whereis only looks for external executable files, you are not getting any output for the built-ins.\nTo find if a command is a built-in or alias or function or external file, the best way is to use the type built-in:\n$ type fg\nfg is a shell builtin\n\n$ type bg\nbg is a shell builtin\n\n$ type jobs\njobs is a shell builtin\n\nAlso note that your find command is not syntactically correct. The correct (simplest) syntax is find /where/to/search -name 'name_to_search'.\nAlso note that few commands are implemented as both a shell built-in and a separate standalone executable. For such commands, always remember that the built-in command will take precedence over the external one. So, when you run echo something, the built-in echo is run. If you want to run the binary executable echo you need to call it in a different way. One way is to use the full path to the executable: /bin/echo something.\nTo display all available versions of a command, run type with the -a option:\n$ type -a echo\necho is a shell builtin\necho is /bin/echo\n\nTo get documentation for shell built-ins, you can check the manpage of bash or use the help command (which is a built-in command):\nhelp jobs\n\nAlso as @terdon pointed out you should use type instead of which.\n\nA: fg, bg and jobs are not separate utilities, but they are part of bash(shell builtin commands).\nyou can find more about them in bash manual using the command \nman bash\n\n\nA: This are shell builtin commands. There is no binary for them as they are a part of Bash (or whatever shell you are using). \nThey are documented for example in the Bash manpage (see the section \"SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\")\n", "Q: Ubuntu Phone on bq: How to show which sim is used while incoming call Is there any possibility to see on which sim the incoming call is coming ?\n\nA: Following the suggestion, I have open request about it.

To close voters: This question is different from the question linked, because its scope is to find the options passed to ./configure during the building of a generic Debian package, not only to find the options passed to ./configure during the building of the Debian packages available in the repositories.\nAs the title said, I've unpacked a Debian package in order to recompile / rebuild it adding a custom option, but I can't sort out how to find the options passed to ./configure when the package was compiled / built in first place. Is finding such options feasible?\n\nA: It may not be possible in a fully general sense, but if your deb came from Debian or Ubuntu directly (i.e., not a third-party deb), then it is required to be reproducible by autobuilders which do something like the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start with a bare system- all Essential: yes or Priority: Required packages, plus build-essential, and any extra dependencies of these\n\n*Satisfy the build-depends and build-conflicts of the package to be built\n\n*Also satisfy build-depends-indep and build-conflicts-indep if appropriate, as determined by build type\n\n*Run debuild\nYou can read the precise steps that debuild takes in its man page, but the parts you probably care about are\n\n\n*\n\n*debian/rules build  (this should do all the configuration and building)\n\n*fakeroot debian/rules binary (this should \"install\" the built package into a directory tree which will be assembled into the final deb)\n\n\ntl;dr: If the package build procedure did any ./configure-ing at all, you should find it in debian/rules.\n", "Q: Automatic switching between performance and powersave mode on plugging in/out the power supply Recently I've been trying to investigate why my laptop is so slow. I found out that it runs at ~600Mhz, regardless of the power supply being plugged in or not. Note that it's  Intel i5-2540M nominally running at 2.60GHz. So I find it very strange to be clocked at ~600Mhz all the time, even if it's loaded with some computations. This even affect web browsing, so it's quite annoying.\nI further investigated this issue and it turns out the clock is related to so called CPU governor mode. On my system it's always set to powersave, no matter if the power supply is plugged in or not. I think it should be switched to performance mode (or something in between, if possible) when the power supply is plugged in. Note that switching to performance mode manually solves the problem - the laptop becomes much more responsive.\nDoes Ubuntu have any support for such automatic switching of CPU governor modes? Is there any package I should install or a configuration file which I need to edit?\nI am aware of the pm-utils package which provides some power related notifications so I could use it as the foundation of a simple script which does the CPU governor switching fully automatically. Still I might be unaware of some limitations or gotchas of such an approach.

This sounds too old but hdmi with an hdmi cable would work too. \nNow with only half of the screen you may want to modify the panel settings so right click on the panel. Then hit panel settings. IF the bottom half was broken and you can't see the panel press control alt t to open a terminal and then supe plus up to get it entirely in the working half of the monitor. then you will need to run lxpanelctl config & to launch the configuration dialog and then press super plus up to make it in the visible top half of the screen. Since the bottom is broken you would likely want to move it to the top. http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/utopic/en/man1/lxpanelctl.1.html is the same as on vivid just there aren't 15.04 manpages on manpages.ubuntu.com yet for more info see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-manpage-repository/+bug/1448306. \nIf the right of left half of the monitor is broken you can right click on panel and panel settings and align to the working side of the monitor. as a panel on the broken part of the screen won't help you much. So right click panel settings and appernce under geometry select alignment on the left or right side of the screen that is working. and make it 50 percent. This may result in a rather crowded panel so \nAlso setting a margin in openbox configuration manager so that maximized windows do not cover the broken half of the screen. To do this you will need to know the resolution which can be found using xrandr in terminal. Then for the side of the screen that is broken in openbox configuration manager. \nThe line that says current will be important. \nAlternitively using your monitor to fix panel settings may be really helpful.\nYou can set a huge margin in openbox configuration manager so that windows will not take up the broken part of the screen. Set the margin to half the resolution along the broken side of the monitor. So if the left half of the monitor is broken set the margin equal to left half of the monitor.

Are there any foreseeable problems with doing this?\n\nA: yes.. you have done basic things to install Ubuntu. \nbut if you wish to run heavy application in Ubuntu such as video editing or such kind of heavy works, then it is good to create another partition for SWAP space. simple idea of swap space is that it behaves like a virtual memory when the RAM is full.you could shrink a partition of size as same as RAM or recommended is 1.5 times of RAM. I recommend you to create this swap space if you have plenty of free space in hard Disk.\nand when installing Ubuntu, don't choose \"install alongside with Ubuntu\" option in setup.sometimes it makes problems. So choose \"Something Else\" option out there and proceed.\nGood Luck\n\nA: As minion91 said:\n-Choose \"something else\"\n-Make a swap-partition (primary partition, ext4-journaling format,size it about 1,5x your RAM)\n-Make a root-partition (the \"/\" symbol, primary, about 15 GiB)\n-Make a home-partition (logical, ext4-journaling, use the free space remaining)\nInstall and enjoy your dualboot-PC.\nCheers. \n", "Q: Cron can't find file at night? I have a cron job written to root (I'm writing to a log in /var/log so need root permission). The problem is that sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.\nThe cron job is simply to call a python script in my home directory, this then does all the hard work.\nI set the job to go off in the middle of the night so it doesn't interfere with what I'm doing and so that the API it interacts with is less likely to change (the API is updated throughout the day).\nBut every morning I check the logs and get the following error:\npython3: can't open file '/home/myUser/path/to/the/main.py': \n[Errno 2] No such file or directory\n\nMy response to this is to change the timing on the crontab to a few minutes beyond the time I am checking the logs, wait a few minutes, and the file starts running. The only thing I change is the timing, and suddenly it works.\nSo I know, for sure, that the file exists.\nI've tried a variation of times at night (30 23 * * *, 01 01 * * *, 10 02 * * *) none have worked, but whenever I set it off for 2 minutes after I check in the morning, it is fine.\nHere is the crontab as it currently stands: \nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\n\n01 01 * * * python3 /home/myUser/path/to/the/main.py >> /var/log/thisjobs.log 2>&1\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that there is an additional newline after this job (I've heard that it is necessary).\nHas anyone seen this before? Is there anything I can try to get this file found without me having to manually change the script each time?\nEDIT: here is my env output for cron:\nLANGUAGE=en_GB:en\nHOME=/root\nLOGNAME=root\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\nLANG=en_GB.UTF-8\nSHELL=/bin/sh\nPWD=/root\n\nAlso thought I'd mention that I have tried using the following command (after the timing) to no avail (same error, but only with the main.py instead of the full path):\ncd /home/myUser/path/to/the; python3 main.py\n\n\nA: Turns out this was the answer: Cron fails at night\nI'm running this on my server (which I only ssh into) over night. So having an encrypted home drive meant that when I'm not logged in nothing is accessible to anything outside of home, including cron.\nI moved my script to /usr/local/bin (there may be a better place to put it, but I didn't feel anything else was suitable) which incidentally meant that I can call it without any path at all (assuming you've set the PATH variable).\nNow everything runs as it should.\n", "Q: how can I upgrade to 15.04 if the required 'Saucy' dir does not exist when updating to 15.04 from 14.04 Iget the follwing errors\nW:Fehlschlag beim Holen von http : // us.archive.ubuntu.com / ubuntu/dists   / saucy / universe / source / Sources  404  Not Found [IP: 2001:67c:1562::17 80]\nW:Fehlschlag beim Holen von http : // us.archive.ubuntu.com / ubuntu / dists / saucy / multiverse / source / Sources  404  Not Found [IP: 2001:67c:1562::17 80]\nW:Fehlschlag beim Holen von http : // us.archive.ubuntu.com / ubuntu / dists / saucy-updates / universe / source / Sources  404  Not Found [IP: 2001:67c:1562::17 80]\nW:Fehlschlag beim Holen von http : // us.archive.ubuntu.com / ubuntu / dists / saucy-updates / multiverse / source / Sources  404  Not Found [IP: 2001:67c:1562::17 80]\nE:Einige Indexdateien konnten nicht heruntergeladen werden.

I have got a folder that contains private stuff and I don't want others to be able to see its content. I will frequently open it and the folder is quite large. I know I can password protect it by encrypting or compressing, but then the loading time is quite long and it is inconvenient. I don't care the content being disclose, so there is no point in encrypting it. All I need is just to hide it.\nIs there a way I can password protect it without encrypting or compressing the folder? \n\nA: you can use steganography method its not also protect your files it also hide your files\nhttps://scottlinux.com/2014/08/12/steganography-in-linux-from-the-command-line/\nfirst install  steghide\nsudo apt-get install steghide\n\n2nd \nsteghide embed -cf tux.jpg -ef mytext.txt \nEnter passphrase: \nRe-Enter passphrase: \nembedding \"mytext.txt\" in \"tux.jpg\"... done\n\nto extract\nsteghide extract -sf tux.jpg\nEnter passphrase: \nwrote extracted data to \"mytext.txt\".\n\n\nA: You can just change the directories permissions to 700 (which equals to rwx------ which means no access at all for everybody, except full access for the owner).\nThat way, no normal user (except your user account!) can enter the directory. They will still be able to see the folder from the outside, but they neither can open it to list its content nor can anybody open files inside it, even if they know the full path and name.\nHowever, when you are logged in and walk away, there is no protection, as this does not affect your own account. You can also decline your own account any permission (set to 000 then), but this can be reverted from your account without password, if one knows how to do so.\nSo the best option is to change the permissions to 700 (only owner has access) and additionally change the owner to be root. That way, nobody can enter the directory, not even you. And you can not change the permissions of the directory back.\nTo access your folder anyway, you would then have to be root, which requires one to be logged in with an admin account and to use gksu/gksudo to open a file manager or media viewers like Nautilus and VLC. This however prompts you again for your admin account password, so you are protected from anybody who is no admin and can not become root.\nSo how to set this up is ridiculously simple. Let's assume the folder you want to protect is /home/MYUSERNAME/Videos/private.\n\n\n*\n\n*Option 1: Full access for owner (you), but no access for other accounts.\nchmod 700 /home/MYUSERNAME/Videos/private\n\nThis setting can be undone from your account without password by typing\nchmod 775 /home/MYUSERNAME/Videos/private\n\n\n*Option 2: No access for any user including you, so you need to become root to enter the directory.\nchmod 000 /home/MYUSERNAME/Videos/private\n\nThis can also be reverted from your account without password by\nchmod 775 /home/MYUSERNAME/Videos/private\n\n\n*Option 3: No access for any user including you and no chance to revert it from your account, so every action can only be performed as root.\nchmod 700 /home/MYUSERNAME/Videos/private\nsudo chown root: /home/MYUSERNAME/Videos/private\n\nTo revert this setting, you have to do the following (which needs sudo and therefore requires your account password):\nsudo chown MYUSERNAME: /home/MYUSERNAME/Videos/private\nchmod 775 /home/MYUSERNAME/Videos/private\n\nNote that options 2 recommends and 3 requires you to have an admin account and that all options only can protect you from users without admin accounts and passwords!\nAdditionally I should mention that one with enough experience and physical access to the machine can also boot it in recovery mode and be root user without having to enter any password. But there is no more secure way unless you use encryption, which you explicitly said you do not want.\n\nA: I faced exactly the same problem. Limit the opening to root. \nWhat I suggest you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a hidden directory in a place you will remember. \ncd /home/user1\nmkdir ./.very_private_directory\n\n*Change the ownership of the directory to root. Create a file you want to protect.\nsudo chown root:root ./.very_private_directory\nsudo touch ./.very_private_directory/dont_read_me.txt\n\n*Open the file as root\nsudo vi /home/user1/.very_private_directory/dont_read_me.txt\nThe idea is that only root can open the file. Follow the same strategy for videos, etc. Normal users don't know anything on the directory and even if they do then they can't do anything except than using sudo to process the file.\n\nA: One solution can be creating a separate partition and add password for mountation. This way you can access that folder by just double clicking and entering the password. When you are done just click unmount, now no one can access that without password from ubuntu.\nHowever that partition is accessigble from different OS without password, so it has some vulnerabilities.\n\n*\n\n*Go to disk, select a partition that has some free space.\n\n*Click on settings icon, select resize\n\n*Adjust volume size and click on create.\n\n*Resizing takes some time, when done select the new unallocated partition\n\n*You will see a option create beside setting option, click on it.\n\n*It will show some option, check protect with password, click create\n\nYou can unmount by clicking here\n\n", "Q: Getting Full User Name Wrong Why when I issue a command like:\nawk -F: -v U=\"$LOGNAME\" '$1==U{print $5}' /etc/passwd\n\nor  \ngrep $USER /etc/passwd | awk 'BEGIN { FS=\":\" } { print $5 }'\n\nis displayed Diogo Saraiva,,, instead of Diogo Saraiva?\nWhen I installed Ubuntu 14.04 I wrote Diogo Saraiva, not Diogo Saraiva,,, in Full name field...\n\nresult of cat /etc/passwd | grep diogosaraiva:\ndiogosaraiva:x:1000:1000:Diogo Saraiva,,,:/home/diogosaraiva:/bin/bash\n\nCan I change that line for\ndiogosaraiva:x:1000:1000:Diogo Saraiva:/home/diogosaraiva:/bin/bash\n\nwithout any problem?\n\nAnd my user isn't the unique issue.\nIn /etc/passwd file:\n...    \ndiogosaraiva:x:1000:1000:Diogo Saraiva,,,:/home/diogosaraiva:/bin/bash\nsshd:x:116:65534::/var/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin\nmysql:x:117:125:MySQL Server,,,:/nonexistent:/bin/false\nsysop:x:1001:1001::/home/sysop:/bin/bash\ndovecot:x:118:126:Dovecot mail server,,,:/usr/lib/dovecot:/bin/false\ndovenull:x:119:127:Dovecot login user,,,:/nonexistent:/bin/false\npostfix:x:120:128::/var/spool/postfix:/bin/false\nvmail:x:5000:5000::/var/mail:\n...\n\n\nA: The fifth field of /etc/passwd is known as the GECOS field, it is reserved for saving user's name and comments.

[Y/n] \n\n$ getent passwd foobar\nfoobar:x:1002:1002:foobar foobar,,,:/home/foobar:/bin/bash\n\nAs you can see in the 5th field the comments that i have not given any input are kept blank with commas , separating them.\nSECOND CASE: All info are given:\n$ sudo adduser foobar\nAdding user `foobar' ...\nAdding new group `foobar' (1002) ...\n\n..........Truncated...............\npasswd: password updated successfully\nChanging the user information for foobar\nEnter the new value, or press ENTER for the default\n    Full Name []: foobar foobar\n    Room Number []: 10\n    Work Phone []: 1010\n    Home Phone []: 1234\n    Other []: spamegg\nIs the information correct? [Y/n] \n\n$ getent passwd foobar\nfoobar:x:1002:1002:foobar foobar,10,1010,1234,spamegg:/home/foobar:/bin/bash\n\nAs you can see all parts of 5th field are now populated with the comma separated values given as input.\nCHANGING VALUE: If you want to change the value of the comment field to something else you can use usermod command with -c (--comment) option:\n$ sudo usermod -c \"spamegg\" foobar \n\n$ getent passwd foobar\nfoobar:x:1002:1002:spamegg:/home/foobar:/bin/bash\n\nOr the better way as @muru suggested in the comment, use chfn. If you are logged on as the user foobar (in this example), then you can use just chfn, or as root sudo chfn foobar. It will prompt you for entering values one by one again, you can also change any individual value by using appropriate option of chfn.

Conventional (passphrase-only) encryption works too:\ntar -cz --files-from=addthese.txt | gpg --cipher-algo AES256 -z 0 --output archive.tar.gz.gpg -c \n\nThis avoids making any extra unencrypted copies of the data, that you'd have to find & wipe (or wipe all free space) if that's a concern. Any programs that use standard output can be piped into gpg too, in case it's not just plain files you're backing up.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 freezing on shutdown/reset and having problem with AMD Having upgraded from 14.10 to 15.04 my AMD graphics were still working but going to TTY, reset or shutdown would result in a freeze. The logs gave no real clues as to what is going on.\nWhat I found so far:\n- Selecting the 3.16 kernel in Grub prevents the freeze problem, but also prevents you from using fglrx\n- Manually selecting the X.org driver (in Software & updates) prevents the freezing too, which makes me think it is purely driver related\n- Changing /etc/default/grub to \"quiet\", as mentioned elsewhere for freezing issues on shutdown, does not change anything\nWhat I would really like is to have the fglrx driver again, but I cannot tolerate a freeze everytime X is closing down. I will probably need to downgrade Ubuntu I guess, but if someone has an easier solution then please let me know.\n\nA: Sorry for bad English:)\nHad same issue on my Lenovo laptop (intel hd video card) - had a freeze on restart/shutdown/sleep with Kubuntu 15.04.

In my case I even was unable to switch to tty.\nOn my laptop i had no fglrx, tried to modify grub config with all found \"solutions\" as reboot=bios & etc. - nothing helped.\nFinally I fixed this on Kubuntu 15.04 by installing older kernel and headers (3.16.0 vs 3.19.6) + marked them as \"hold\" in aptitude + removed 3.19.6 kernel completely for now. Maybe you'll find other less aggressive solution but I needed fully working laptop asap.\nHere're links to save you some googling time:)\nInstall 3.16.0 kernel (look at the accepted answer):\nHow can I install 3.16 kernel on Ubuntu 14.04\nMark kernel and headers as \"hold\" to prevent upgrade (easy way through aptitude):\nIf you haven't got aptitude installed\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\n\nRun aptitude\nsudo aptitude\n\nFind installed kernel and headers under \"Obsolete packages\" section (don't remember exact name, sorry) and click \"Package\" -> \"Hold\" while selecting kernel or headers.\nRemove 3.19.* kernel using Synaptics Package Manager:\nhttp://connectwww.com/how-to-remove-old-linux-kernels-in-ubuntu-via-synaptic-package-manager/614/\nHope it will help someone.\nIn my case restart/shutdown and sleep are working fine now.\nBR.\n", "Q: can i add space to sda1 boot from sda2 extended I tried getting help in another post \n(SDA1 almost full.

What do i do? \n\nThese are the steps to increase the size of sda1:\nStep 1: Backup your data to an external medium. \nStep 2: Boot from the Live DVD/USB and use the Try Ubuntu without installing option. \nDisable Swap: Open a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and enter\nsudo swapoff -a\n\nThen open Gparted. Make sure the correct drive is selected at the top right corner.\nStep 3: Select sda6 Make sure you have not selected the whole of sda2. And right click on it. From the context menu select Resize/Move. Drag the right edge with a black triangle to the left to make it smaller until you have created enough empty space you need for sda.\nStep 4: This is a little tougher. Now select sda2 and repeat the same process and shrink sda2 as far as possible. \nStep 5 Using the Resize/Move menu, move sda2 all the way to the right. This will create empty space to the right of sda1.\nStep 6: Using the Resize/Move menu on sda1 expand it to fill up the empty space.\nStep 7: Use the Green check mark button to apply all the changes. And wait a long time till everything is done.\nHope this helps \n", "Q: How to press ENTER in Nano on Ubuntu-touch via abd?

Googling it only taught me what a Java Agent is. Now:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does this message appear?\n\n*Does anybody else observe this?\n\n*Can it be disabled?\n\n\nA: This PPA is to get Unity AppMenu and HUD support for applications like NetBeans IDE, IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio etc., as described here. So, unless you want this you can delete the package using sudo apt-get remove jayatana (and as the stackoverflow thread suggests, removing /usr/share/upstart/sessions/jayatana.conf and restarting your computer). I am not sure if this is by default installed by 15.04 because it is not listed in the author's repo.\n\nA: \nWhy does this message appear?\n\nApparently it's reporting that the environment variable JAVA_TOOLS_OPTIONS has been set.\n\nDoes anybody else observe this?\n\nYes, I see it and am annoyed by it as well.\n\nCan it be disabled?\n\nA couple of sites suggest uninstalling jayatana, but I'm reluctant to do that since I don't really know why Ubuntu installed it in the most recent release.\n\nA: If you just want to remove the message you can just edit your $HOME/.bashrc (if using bash) or $HOME/.profile and unset the variable with:\nunset JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS\nThis way jayatana will still be there and can just be enabled again if you remove the unset JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS from your .bashrc / .profile. \nNote unsetting the variable is NOT equivalent to setting it to null. If you set it to null as follows you will still see a message when running any java based application:\nJAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=\n\nA: This is because of Jayatana, which is added to Ubuntu 15.04 in order to enable global menu for Java Swing applications. You can safely remove this message by entering the following command in a terminal. This command will remove the auto-start configuration of Jayatana.\nsudo rm /usr/share/upstart/sessions/jayatana.conf\n\nHowever, removing this option will disable the global menu support of Java Swing applications like Netbeans, IntelliJ IDEA.

The workaround is:\nbash yourscript.sh\n\n\nA: After some (preliminary) testing, it appears to me that this is not a bug with the ubuntu-terminal-app, but is instead to do with not being allowed to launch executable files from within the home directory. That's why bash /path/to/file worked, but /path/to/file didn't, because bash resides in /bin.\nI have tried running a bash script, a python script, and a hello-world g++ compiled c++ program, all with the executable bit set, and none will run when in a subdirectory of /home. None will run, whilst scripts and applications in other subdirectories of root run fine.\nUnfortunately, I am yet to find a solution: there is nothing in /etc/fstab to suggest /home is mounted as noexec:\n/userdata/user-data /home none bind 0 0\n\nI have even tried remounting it explicitly as exec using mount -o remount,rw,exec /home to no avail. Will update if I find a solution.\nSo far the only workaround is to use an interpreter to run scripts (Bash/Python etc.) or /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3 /path/to/file for binary applications.\nMinor update: A slightly more elegant workaround is to move the script/application to another directory, such as /opt, and then symlink to it. That way you can run it just by /path/to/symlink. For example, you could do:\nsudo mv /path/to/SCRIPT.sh /opt\nln -s /opt/SCRIPT.sh /path/to\n\nThen you could just type /path/to/SCRIPT.sh to run it.\n\nUPDATE WITH SOLUTION\nFound out the problem is to do with the apparmor security profile for the terminal app. See my question and answer here: Ubuntu touch – executable files won't launch in /home directory\n\nA: Try changing the shabang line to\n#!/bin/bash\n\nrather than\n#!/bin/sh\n\nThis will default the interpreter to bash, rather than sh.

My system is pretty solid running on a dual core i5, 8gb, 512ssd, hd3000. I'm a newer Linux user and I don't do a lot of CLI foo, only How To's that seem interesting. Any thoughts on this issue? Should this be asked in the chat?\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 was released as an LTS (Long Term Support) where it is stable, and the patches / updates will continue for years.  Ubuntu 15.04 is a non-LTS release, and will only be supported for a short time, like a only a few months.  I prefer the LTS releases for my everyday usage system, and when I want to test things out I use the non-LTS releases to check out the newer features that can be in future releases.  I just have to remember that non-LTS are not stable, and can be prone to crashes and very little hardware support.

It only exists for 14.04 if you are using Windows 7 or previous. It has to do with bootloader differences. Canonical is no longer promoting Wubi has an optimal solution to install Ubuntu from within Windows (and thus, Wubi is hard to find if you don't know to look for it), and this is because more PCs ship with Windows 8 or higher now. \nAdditionally, there are concerns about filesystem integrity when running Ubuntu \"inside\" the Windows filesystem in this way. \nI strongly suggest you install Ubuntu the normal way. The setup is extremely easy and will safely guide you through the entire dualboot process. Documentation on this process is also widely available. \n", "Q: pm-hibernate freezes and/or fails to resume on Dell XPS 13, 14.04, 3.19 kernel I'm running 14.04 on a new XPS 13. In order to support the newer hardware, I'm running a mainline 3.19 kernel. \nHibernate resume has been iffy with the entire 3.19 kernel line, but recently (3.19.5) pm-hibernate no longer works at all. The screen will either a) switch off momentarily, then back on with all inputs frozen or b) switch off entirely, and fail to resume upon power on (despite displaying the correct resume-from-uuid message).\nI have enough swap space (and it has worked in the past), I have checked that the uuid is being correctly referenced, and nothing seems particularly amiss in /var/log/pm-suspend.log (last 200 lines here: http://pastebin.com/1dvyHhmQ)\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: For the situation I described running a non-stock kernel, the following solution worked. Depending on what kernel series you're using, YMMV:\nYou'll need to do these to get grub/initramfs set up correctly:\nsudo blkid | grep swap <-- get your swap uuid\nsudo <your_text_editor_here> /etc/default/grub <-- edit your grub file    \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"RESUME=UUID=<your_swap_uuid>\" <-- add this to grub file\nuname -r <-- get running kernel name\nsudo update-initramfs -u -k <your_kernel_name> <-- init with the right kernel\nsudo update-grub\n\nReboot, and then check for hibernate compatibility by doing pm-hibernate at the command line. Hope this helps someone else!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 freezes for a second every 6-10 seconds, PCI/Radeon related messages in kern.log Tonight I made a fresh install of Xubuntu 15.04 on my laptop, an Acer Aspire TimelineX 4820TG. I was running 14.04 LTS before, and all was fine. I didn't have lot of stuffs to save, so I went for a complete uninstall and fresh re-installation, in order to have a cleaner system.\nUnfortunately I'm experiencing periodical freezes since first boot. The freeze occurs every 6-10 seconds and lasts about 1 second. During freeze mouse and keyboard are not responsive, and so it looks all the system. It is very annoying.\nAdditionally, I can hear fan speeds up every time the freeze occurs. And system hangs on shutdown (I had to long-press the power button).\nI noticed that during every freeze these exact lines in /var/log/kern.log are printed:\n[  159.876643] snd_hda_intel 0000:01:00.1: Disabling via VGA-switcheroo\n[  160.097085] snd_hda_intel 0000:01:00.1: Cannot lock devices!\n[  160.844851] i915 0000:00:02.0: BAR 6: [???

I hope they can ship the fix soon in next kernel releases.\n\nA: I had this same issue with Ubuntu 15.04.

Can we run it on single machine under linux?

The -e is the script that is applied to each line. \n\n\n*\n\n*/^\\*(.*)/ : match lines that start with an asterisk and save everything after the asterisk as $1 (that's what the parentheses do). \n\n*|| print \"$_$1\"' : the || is a logical OR. Therefore, the print will only be executed if the current line did not start with an asterisk. If so, we print the current line ($_) along with whatever is currently saved as $1 (the pattern following the asterisk).\n\nAs usual, there are many ways of doing this.

After you extracted the deb, you'll have, among others, a usr/ dir which should contain everything you need to run git.\nUpload that dir to your phone, so that its in your home, then just run\n/home/phablet/usr/bin/git\n\nand it should work.

I recently compiled and installed diffutils-3.3 as I needed the --no-dereference switch that is unavailable in the included version of diff.

What I did to resolve the problem was to use the command export $PATH$ which worked for me. \nFurther research indicates that you can find out if the path is cached (hashed) by using the command type - type diff (in my case) which returns the full path of the command similar to diff is /usr/bin/diff\nYou can take the surgical approach and remove the cache (hash) for a single command with the command hash -d *command* or in my case hash -d diff which reports success with output of bash: hash: diff: not found\nyou can also take the less elegant and just as successful approach of dumping the entire cache (hash) table with hash -r which reports nothing.\nSources:\nExperience\nHow get rid of -bash: /usr/{package}: No such file or directory\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/5609/how-do-i-clear-bashs-cache-of-paths-to-executables\n", "Q: KDE start Screen becomes unresponsive I installed KDE alongside unity.

On the other hand, BSSID is a numeric ID of the access point (something like the MAC address of the router). For instance, on my college campus we have many different access points with the same name, but BSSIDs are different for each router.\nYou can list networks with their respective ESSID and BSSID with\nnmcli dev wifi\n\nOr for cleaner output you can do nmcli -f SSID,BSSID dev wifi.\nAlso with iwlist, for example:\nsudo iwlist wlp2s0 scan\n\n\nA: Types of Service Sets:\n\n*\n\n*BSS (Basic Service Set)\n\n*ESS (Extended Service Set). ESSs consists of one or more infrastructure-BBSs (the usual mode). Are associated with multiple access points. All the APs beacons will broadcast same SSID but different BSSID. It involves roaming. The user gets connected to the AP that has maximum strength. Usually nearby BSSs broadcast on different channels/frequencies.\n\n\nIDentification:\n\n*\n\n*SSID: Network name (friendly, text, even with non-ISO basic Latin characters, up to 64 characters). Could be hidden (no broadcast). Sometimes \"wrongly\" called ESSID since might group a set of APs under one name, but there is formally no such thing as an ESSID in 802.11 standards.\n\n*BSSID: MAC address of the access point, it uniquely identifies each one.\n\nYou can use these commands to get a lot of information of nearby networks:\nnmcli -f NAME,SSID,SSID-HEX,BSSID,MODE,CHAN,FREQ,RATE,SIGNAL,BARS,SECURITY,WPA-FLAGS,RSN-FLAGS,DEVICE,ACTIVE,IN-USE,DBUS-PATH device wifi\n# Or just nmcli device wifi\n\nor iwlist wlp2s0 scanning, but since commands from net-tools and wireless-tools packages seems to be deprecated in Linux you could try to get familiar with modern iw from iproute2 package:\niw dev wlp2s0 scan dump\n\nReference\n\n*\n\n*Understanding the Network Terms SSID, BSSID, and ESSID\n\n*What's the difference between a BSSID and an ESSID? - Quora\nSee also\n\n*\n\n*Fast BSS Transition (AKA 802.11r, AKA Fast Roaming)\n\n", "Q: Stuck on \"Removing conflicting operating system files\" while upgrading from 14.04 to 15.04 I'm trying to update to Ubuntu 15.04 from 14.04.

Is it supposed to take this long? If not, what can I do about it?\n\nA: This error was common while trying out 12.04.\nIt happened when you want to keep your old /home partition. Chances are you’ve come across the installation hanging on a process \n\nRemoving conflicting operating system files\n\nThis seems to be a common bug and there’s a pretty easy work around.\nContinue with the installation, without asking for the /home partition to be mounted. Only set the root partition (/) and your swap space.\nOnce the installation is complete, reboot and load it up.\nNow, you’ll want to find the partition that /home is mounted under, this will likely be /dev/sdxN, where x is the drive letter and N is the partition number.\nIf you’re unsure, you can list the possible drives using the following command:\nls /dev/\n\nAnd then you can mount each drive under in a temp directory and check what’s in there:\nmkdir temp\nmount /dev/sda1 temp\n\nOnce you know which partition you want, it’s time to edit your /etc/fstab/\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nFor those who don’t go digging around in the config files of Linux, this may look pretty daunting, but it's quite straightforward. All you really need to do is add a new line to mount your home partition. Here’s mine:\n /dev/sda5  /home/      ext4    defaults    0   2\n\nThe first part is the label of the partition that’s being used, next the mount point, /home. It is followed by the file system type, ext4 in this case. Finally there are the options default dump and pass values.\nOnce you’ve saved this file with the appended line, reboot your system. Now you should find your old home partition is mounted normally and you can get on with your install.\nFor further information visit this article.\n", "Q: Why does ps output show a process even if it is not running? Why does the ps shows a process even if it is not running. While Firefox is running:\n$ echo $(ps aux | awk  '/firefox/{print $2}')\n5964 6041\n\nBut when Firefox is not running, I tried to run the same command. It showed  a different PID each time.\nI tried grepping it:\n$ ps aux | grep firefox\ngreenpa+  6056  0.0  0.0  15956   948 pts/11   S+   09:29   0:00 grep --color=auto firefox\n\nWhat does it mean? \n\nA: And this is why you shouldn't grep or otherwise parse the output of ps for matching commands, but use tools like pgrep and pidof.\nWhen you run ps | grep foo, the grep foo process is also listed by ps - therefore grep foo matches itself along with any other foo processes. The exact same thing happens when you do echo $(ps aux | awk  '/firefox/...) - the awk command matches itself. \nIndeed, depending on what output you want from ps, you might be better off using pgrep's output with ps. For example, the states of all Google Chrome processes in my system:\nps -p $(pgrep -d, chrome) -o pid,state\n\npgrep's flexibility in this regard is very useful - note how I can specify an output delimiter with -d, then use it as PID list argument to ps. pgrep and pkill are also capable of reading from a PID file. \n\nA: As muru already pointed out grep leaves trace of itself in the ps, however, there is a small workaround for using grep with ps : use double quotes and brackets on the first letter like so  ps aux | grep \"[f]irefox\" (Source: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/74186/85039).\n", "Q: How can I make background image changed as time goes?

In addition, all the windows are now flushed to the external monitor. This seems like a deliberate feature and not a bug.\nHow do I configure the laptop to suspend even if it's connected to an external monitor?\nThis is Lenovo Thinkpad T440s on Ubuntu 15.04/15.10 with Intel graphics.\n\nA: Welcome to Ubuntu with systemd rather than with upstart.\nThis is systemd bug #76267.  Lennart Poettering's initial explanation was:The [nvidia] binary driver does not implement the DRM interfaces in /sys. This means we cannot detect how many displays are connected and then we decide not to handle the lid switch since we cannot be sure about whether the device is in \"docking\" mode, or not.A \"fix\" is to use nouveau.\nBecause of systemd bug #82485 this behaviour is now configurable.  If you have a non-DRM driver, like the nvidia one, the default behaviour with multiple monitors will be to ignore the lid switch. But the recent HandleLidSwitchDocked setting in logind.conf can be used to change this.\n(For completeness: There is GNOME bug #734964, still open, that introduces complications for GNOME 3 users.)\n\nA: I think this feature is now configurable. You can change the option as user with the dconf-editor:\nSchema:\norg.cinnamon.settings-daemon.plugins.power\n\nor (depending on what desktop environment you use)\norg.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power\n\nKey:\nlid-close-suspend-with-external-monitor\n\nSet to:\ntrue\n\nDescription:\n\nWith no external monitors plugged in, closing a laptop's lid will\n  suspend the machine (as set by the lid-close-battery-action and\n  lid-close-ac-action keys). By default, however, closing the lid when\n  an external monitor is present will not suspend the machine, so that\n  one can keep working on that monitor (e.g. for docking stations or\n  media viewers). Set this key to False to keep the default behavior, or\n  to True to suspend the laptop whenever the lid is closed and\n  regardless of external monitors.\n\n\nA: I ran into the same problem upgrading from 14.10 to 15.04 (Xubuntu). Although I was using Nouveau (Xorg driver), I wasn't able to go into Suspend mode closing the lid. Every other way worked just fine e.g. \"Sleep Button\", \"Suspend\" from Menu etc.\nMy workaround was to uncheck the following option in gnome-settings (a.k.a Settings Editor):\nxfce4-power-manager > logind-handle-lid-switch (unchecked)\nAfter doing this I can suspend closing my lid anytime.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: This is a new systemd default which is not configurable yet.\nTo Workaround, type in a terminal\necho \"HandleLidSwitchDocked=suspend\" |sudo tee -a /etc/systemd/logind.conf\n\nthen reboot(!).\nThis changes the default from \"ignore\" to \"suspend\".\n\nA: I was facing similar issue this answer solved my issue. Install Unity Tweak Tool and in System > Security all the options should be unticked. The Desktop Lock was ticked in my case uncheck this.\nSee this img:\n\nIf the above mentioned option is ticked then in System Settings > Brightness and Lock the lock option is disabled which causes all the problem.\nSee this img:\n\n", "Q: In Ubuntu 15.04 can't do graphical log in I have done clean install recently of Ubuntu Desktop 15.04.\nAnd I was able to log in to the graphical environment until I enabled \"boot to text\" like said there: How do I disable X at boot time so that the system boots in text mode?\n 1. commented out GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n 2. added \"text\" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"text\"\n 3. uncommented GRUB_TERMINAL=console\n 4. sudo update-grub\n 5. sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target\nNow system does not load gui, just text prompt.\nWhen I want the GUI, I start it usingsudo systemctl start lightdmgraphical login prompt appear, but when I pass the password screen flickers and again password prompt appears.\nI even reverted all changes back: grub file and sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target\nHow can I log in to the GUI now, please?\n\nA: Based on the bug report,  reported March 21, 2015 Ubuntu 15.04 Xserver does not start or freezes with systemd + lightdm. More detail regarding the impact of this change  and how to switch from systemd to upstart and back again is available on this page.\nTo check to see if your system is using systemd vs. upstart you can test by issuing the command sudo initctl version which will return upstart if upstart is handling init. another useful method is to issue the command dpkg -S /sbin/init which will tell you which package installed it (in my case on 14.04 it's upstart)  you can find more very good answers on how to do so from our friends at Unix & Linux. Further detail regarding identifying the init system is also available.\nTo see if your lightdm works under upstart as designed, you can install the upstart-sysv package, which will remove ubuntu-standard and systemd-sysv (but should not remove anything else. Give the developers a heads up if it does!), and run sudo update-initramfs -u. After that, grub's \"Advanced options\" menu will have a corresponding \"Ubuntu, with Linux ... (systemd)\" entry where you can do an one-time boot with systemd. \nYou can revert back to systemd installing systemd-sysv and ubuntu-standard packages.\nAnother option appears to be to use gdm under systemd instead of lightdm under upstart.\nFurther sources (not linked elsewhere):\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/196166/how-to-find-out-if-a-system-uses-sysv-upstart-or-systemd-initsystem\n\nA: I am also having problems with lightdm refusing to show up. In my case, I have both \"plain\" ubuntu and kubuntu-desktop, so I chose sddm as login screen (sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm allowed me to select which login manager I wanted). Maybe installing sddm (if you don't want all of Kubuntu desktop) might be a workaround (I don't know detailed steps on how to install and configure ONLY sddm, though). I'm on a Haswell integrated graphics setup.\ngdm seems to work, too: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lightdm/+bug/1434799\n\nA: I had this problems after upgrading from 14.04. I restarted the system and went in to a terminal and tested the login at the terminal and determined my logins worked. I logged in as root and did apt-get update and saw an error that stated that I needed to run dpkg --configure -a. I ran the command and let it reconfigure the system. After it was finished( about an hour) I rebooted the system and was able to log in to the graphical login.\n\nA: To solve my problem I have to change ownership of .Xauthority file from root to my user like this:\nchown myusername:myusername .Xauthority\n\nwhere myusername is my username.\n\nA: My ordeal has been with adding or removing *.desktop files on my machine, and getting a black screen with only a cursor and the \"search bar\" from alt-F2. \nThe first time, I tried to manually add a *.desktop file to /.local/share/application for Sublime Text, and that messed up my machine.\nThe second time I added a launcher for Android Studio using the software's shortcut to do so, which creates a *.desktop automatically and places it in /.local/share/applications. Right after that, my OS crashed, and when I tried to reboot and log back in, I saw the black screen. \nThe third time, which happened 3 hours ago, I deleted a duplicate *.desktop file from /.local/share/applications, then logged out. When I logged back in, I encountered, yet again, this issue. \nI'm at my wit's end with this. I had to reinstall Kubuntu 15.04 after the first occurrence. For the second, I had to do some convoluted things which I wish I had made a note of, but also included creating a new user and transferring all my data from the old user account. \nI guess I will have to go through the whole ordeal again, but this is concerning. If it's happened 3 times in one week, it is bound to happen for the next who knows how long until a fix is in place....\nUPDATE\nI was able to get my desktop back by running sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop. How the hell did this get uninstalled, I have no idea, but there you go. I hope this helps someone out there.\n\nA: I had similar issues after trying to add some startup scripts (black screen with cursor and a half-active search box). In my case deleting .cache directory from home dir unlocked my system. At this point I think that my problems originate from sudo not respecting -S switch when used in script. No idea why, as in Konsole it works OK... \n\nA: After updating 14.04 to 14.10 and then 15.04 I got caught in the login loop.  After much poking around at problems with nVidia drivers, they were not much help.  I have an HP Pavillion with AMD CPU & Drivers.  Here were the simple steps that worked:\nCtrl-Alt-F1 to get a console prompt (non-gui)\ndkms status #shows that fglrx-core was installed\nsudo apt-get purge fglrx-core\nsudo apt-get fglrx-updates\ndkms status\nsudo reboot now\n\nThen all was well.\n\nA: I too suffered the same problem today. I was unable to login onto 15.04\ngraphical system with the latest kernel.\nI own a DELL vostro 3546 ubuntu laptop with nvidia 2gb graphic card.\nSo i went into grub-> Advanced options for Ubuntu -> Ubuntu kernel 13.13 generic (used by 14.04 Ubuntu) and I was able to boot into 15.04 Ubuntu.\nHence i guess the graphic driver is unsupported for new kernel.We have to wait till the fix.\nNow i'm figuring out how to load 13.13 generic kernel by default.\n", "Q: Can't get online after installing Lubuntu 15.04 I upgraded to Lubuntu 15.04 yesterday. \nI originally installed Lubuntu at school several months back, so it was done using the school's Ethernet connection.

They give the next solution:\n\nThere is just one thing systemd cannot do (as of systemd-204): power\n  management depending on whether the system is running on AC or\n  battery. To fill this gap, you can create a single udev rule that runs\n  a script when the AC adapter is plugged and unplugged:\n/etc/udev/rules.d/powersave.rules\nSUBSYSTEM==\"power_supply\", ATTR{online}==\"0\", RUN+=\"/path/to/your/script true\"\nSUBSYSTEM==\"power_supply\", ATTR{online}==\"1\", RUN+=\"/path/to/your/script false\"\n\n\nFor my Sony Vaio, I have this as my personal setup:\n/etc/udev/rules.d/99-laptopac.rules\nSUBSYSTEM==\"power_supply\", ATTR{online}==\"0\", RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/sony-thermal.sh true\"\nSUBSYSTEM==\"power_supply\", ATTR{online}==\"1\", RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/sony-thermal.sh false\"\n\n/usr/local/bin/sony-thermal.sh\n#!/bin/sh\n\nhelp() {\n    cat <&ltEOF\n$0: SONY laptop thermal profile management\n\nThis script selects between \"performance\" and \"silent\" modes depending\non whether laptop runs on AC power or battery power.\n\nEOF\n}\n\nset_sony_thermal_profile() {\n    [ ! -d /sys/devices/platform/sony-laptop ] && exit $NA\n    [ ! -f /sys/devices/platform/sony-laptop/thermal_control ] && exit $NA\n    case $1 in\n    performance) \n        printf \"Setting SONY thermal control to performace mode.\"\n        thermal_control=performance ;;\n    silent)\n        printf \"Setting SONY thermal control to silent mode.\"\n        thermal_control=silent ;;\n    *)\n        printf \"Setting SONY thermal control to balanced mode.\"\n        thermal_control=balanced ;;\n    esac\n    echo \"$thermal_control\" > /sys/devices/platform/sony-laptop/thermal_control && echo Done. || \\\n    echo Failed.\n}\n\ncase $1 in\n    true) set_sony_thermal_profile silent ;;\n    false) set_sony_thermal_profile performance ;;\n    help) help ;;\n    *) exit $NA ;;\nesac\n\nexit 0\n\nThis prevents CPU in my notebook to go into \"throttling\" continuously even at light loading conditions with great performance and user experience losses.\n\nA: Default Ubuntu power scripts can be triggered this way.\nAdd a file pm-utils with this content\nSUBSYSTEM==\"power_supply\", ATTR{online}==\"0\", RUN+=\"/usr/sbin/pm-powersave true\"\nSUBSYSTEM==\"power_supply\", ATTR{online}==\"1\", RUN+=\"/usr/sbin pm-powersave false\"\n\nto /etc/udev/rules.d/\nAnd the default Ubuntu powersave features will be applied when you switch from the battery to AC and back.\nThere is a problem that it is not triggered on boot.

I have Caixa Mágica 22LTS (based on Ubuntu 14.04) installed on my laptop. I want to know if is possible to convert it to Ubuntu 14.04 or 15.04 (in Portuguese). If yes, then I need to install the HP OfficeJet 7500A, which I can't install with my Caixa Mágica.\n\nA: Short answer: you can't upgrade.\nLong answer: I think there is a confusion in your mind. Please, allow me to clear that for you. \nYour distribution Caixa Mágica 22LTS is based on Ubuntu 14.04, which means, it is a different distribution. Even if they have a lot in common - Ubuntu can be considered the \"parent\" distro for Caixa Mágica, from the moment when \"daughter\" distro - in your case, Caixa - split up from the \"parent\" distro, - in this case, Ubuntu - , they all evolve on different paths. \nMaybe you'd find easier to understand that, if you'd think about the Biology class and the evolution of species - well, in Linux world, things are pretty much the same. \nIf you need to upgrade, then you should upgrade your distribution Caixa Mágica 22LTS to its last stable version. If you want to use Ubuntu instead, then forget about Caixa Mágica and do a fresh Ubuntu install. \nBut under no circumstances, don't make the mistake to upgrade your older version of Caixa Mágica to the newer version of Ubuntu! Because if you do so, you risk messing up everything. The resulting \"distro\" would be neighter Caixa Mágica, nor Ubuntu. That if it will be functional! \nI'll give you another example, just to show you that you are not the only non-Ubuntu user \"lurking\" on Askubuntu. I use Zorin OS 6 Core, a distro which is based on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. Now that Ubuntu 14.04 is already released, I keep getting messages from the system asking me to do the upgrade to Ubuntu14.04. But I don't upgrade, I ignore the messages. Why? Because, like I've said, I know that Ubuntu and Zorin OS are two different distributions. \nStill, coming here, in the very hart of Ubuntu community is the best thing that any user of Ubuntu-derived distros can do, as long as he/she keeps in mind the way Linux distributions relate, what they have in common, what makes them different, what are the characteristics of a specific distribution, etc.\n", "Q: Reset hibernation delay from command line My hibernation on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS works fine.

So you can't remove openjdk-7 without removing also\n  default-jre and break a lot of other dependencies.\n\nIs it the same on Ubuntu 15.04?\n\nA: If you remove OpenJDK, it will break dependencies, but these dependencies are only related to Java.

You can still access your other partition (Windows, I am assuming) by opening file manager (search in dash for files or nautilus) and clicking on the disk icon on the left side, which carries the name or id of your hard drive\nIn the screenshot bellow (the red square is totally unrelated to the answer, by the way) you see this user have 4 other partitions in addition to \"File system\", which is actually Ubuntu partition\n\nIn addition, you can list all the partitions on your drive with these commands: lsblk, sudo parted --list, and sudo fdisks -l. The first one will show partitions as block devices with specific numeric id. Typically your whole drive is called /dev/sda and partitions are numbered /dev/sda1,/dev/sda2,/dev/sda3 . . ./dev/sdaX, you can recognize partitions by size. As for parted --list it's a little more detailed, and it will actually tell  you if a partition belongs to windows type of file system or not(it will say NTFS).\n", "Q: libMagicWand.so.5 cannot open shared object file?

Sometimes I want to install a program when offline. But apt-get downloads as you install.\nIs there a way to install a program, like you would install a .exe, on Ubuntu?\n\nA: You can use:\napt-get install -d\n\nTo download software and dependencies without installing them. The .deb files (pretty much equivalent to Windows .exe installers), are then downloaded to /var/cache/apt/archives/\nUnless you've issued apt-get clean pretty much anything you've ever installed via apt-get should have the .deb files stored there.\nAlso you can install the .deb files via dpgk -i but you have to remember to install the dependencies (and their dependencies and so on), first. Or you should also just be able to double click a .deb file in your file browser and Software Center should take care of it for you.\nFor example: I want to install gedit (which is included with Ubuntu normally so it won't download tons of dependency .deb files). But I have a system that, for whatever reason, doesn't have gedit and has no internet connect.\nSo first, on a computer connected to the internet, I run apt-get install --reinstall -d gedit (because if you try running apt-get install -d gedit on a system with gedit already installed to the latest version it just tells you it is already installed), which then goes through the normal process of downloading the package (in this case there are no dependencies), and then stops.\n\nThen I locate the file under /var/cache/apt/archives/ ...\n\n... and move it to the computer which needs gedit installed and install it, in this case using the Software Center.\n\nOr I could install it using cd /var/cache/apt/archives and dpkg -i gedit_3.10.4-0ubuntu4_amd64.deb \n", "Q: Installation hangs on partitioning step on 15.04 x64 As titled, I tried to install today the 15.04 x64 but it hangs at the partitioning step. \nI have a partition for window and one for ubuntu, I already formatted the ubuntu one so now I am stuck because there is no grub that can boot even windows.\nIt hangs after I select the ubuntu partition, select the ext4, format flag, point /, then I confirm my changes and then it hangs\nI tried to wait something like one hour, nothing..\nI tried also to not select the update and the third part software in the previous step (I read it helped in some cases) but no success.\nI also noticed I can access the linux partition at the begin, before starting on \"installing ubuntu\" from the live desktop.

So I imagined I could install Ubuntu on the ext4 partition by choosing \"install ubuntu along windows\", but I was wrong, once I clicked this, I had the choise to distribute my space outside win partition to two additional partitions, one for data (photo, documents, music, video, etc) and another for ubuntu itself. \nSo I clicked back, I chose the second one, \"format the whole hd and install only ubuntu\" but just for playing with the menu and check out if there were other options, I didn't go further than the confirmation menu and then I went back. \nI tried once again the \"manual choise\", I set up my ex4 partition by selecting the format option and the / mount point, then I confirmed and then when the bottoms went grey, I tried to play a little with the keyboard, especially pressing randomly the arrows keys.\nIt accessed the following menu, I couldn't believe that..\nAnyway, if this last time would have failed too, I was going to install it on the ssd through one of my laptop as last chance before downgrading to 14.10 and then upgrade.\nI am sorry I can't give a rational explanation to this, but it worked, I wish anyone with my same problem to solve it too, good luck with that!\n\nA: Had the some problem. \nMy solution was to Try Ubuntu, then open GParted Partition Editor, format the previous Ubuntu partition and then install worked fine!\n", "Q: What should I do?

Or perhaps with the key that it would have been signed with I can still test without a reinstall of Google Chrome?\n\n*Where can I find the official MD5 for Google Chrome? I have been unable to find this on their website.\n\nA: Well, the easiest method of verifying a deb is via apt\nSee How secure is the apt-get install command against man in the middle attacks and the Securing Debian Manual for details.\nThis does not help you, however, if you did not install the package via apt.\nIt then depends on how the .deb was packaged. If it was \"properly\" packaged it should include md5sums of the files\nLook in /var/lib/dpkg/info/google-chrome.md5sums I am not sure of the exact file name here.\nYou can also use the -V or dpkg --verify options\ndpkg --verify google-chrome\n\n-V, --verify [package-name...]\n          Verifies  the  integrity  of  package-name  or  all  packages if\n          omitted, by comparing information from the installed paths  with\n          the database metadata.\n\n          The output format is selectable with the --verify-format option,\n          which by default uses the rpm format, but that might  change  in\n          the  future,  and  as  such programs parsing this command output\n          should be explicit about the format they expect.\n\nMan page\nIf you installed a compromised package and the person was good, or the person who packaged the .deb did not follow standard protocols, you really can not verify the package as the md5sums will be good (in the first case) or missing (in the second case).\nThis is an example of why you should not install packages outside of the ubuntu repositories (use Chromium) and why I advise people who package follow the packaging guidelines. Although the guidelines are a hassle, they are important.\n", "Q: Bumblebee in Ubuntu 15.04 (Optirun/Primus) Error I recently upgraded to 15.04 and after successful installation I noticed that Bumblebee has stopped working.

When this happens, you can rename the folder that contains these files (or delete it), which effectively clears the profile and causes a new one to be automatically generated, usually without the problem.\nMost graphical applications store their user-specific configuration data in a folder inside the .config folder which is itself in your home directory:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+H in Nautilus (this also works in most other file browsers) to show files and folders whose name start with ..\n\n*Go into the .config folder in your home folder.\n\n*Find the folder (inside .config) named libreoffice.\n\n*Make sure LibreOffice is not running. In this specific case it appears to be exiting completely after giving you the error, so you don't have to do anything for this step.\n\n*Rename this libreoffice folder to libreoffice.old.\n\n\nOr if you prefer a console way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T).\n\n*Make sure LibreOffice is not running.\n\n*Rename the profile folder with the command:\ncd ~/.config && mv libreoffice libreoffice.old\nIt appears from your comments that moving the libreoffice user profile folder aside like this has worked for you. In cases where you don't still need to use any information from the old profile, this is a complete solution. (In other cases, this is a workaround or partial solution.)\nIf you don't need your old LibreOffice settings, words added to spell-checking dictionaries, or any other user-specific configuration data for LibreOffice, then this solution is all that you need.\n\nMore generally, this technique is especially likely to work when there is an indication that the problem is user-specific. In your case, troubleshooting revealed:\n\n\n*\n\n*LibreOffice ran successfully when you logged in as a Guest.\n\n*LibreOffice ran successfully when launched with gksu, which ran it as root. While sometimes this succeeds by overcoming permissions problems (when it does, this should be considered a workaround rather than an ultimate solution except for utilities that do actually require root privileges), often this succeeds simply because it uses a different user account with a different profile.\nUnlike running it with straight sudo (which should not be done), gksu libreoffice, gksudo libreoffice, sudo -H libreoffice, or sudo -i libreoffice make libreoffice use the LibreOffice profile in the root user's home folder (/root), creating it if it doesn't already exist.\nOf course, you should not run LibreOffice to do actual work with it, as it is best to avoid running programs--especially large graphical programs that may contain security vulnerabilities due to their compexity--as the root user.\n\nA: If you have more time for trouble shooting and want to save as much of your personal stuff as you can, then instead of deleting the whole /home/*USERNAME*/.config/libreoffice folder, try to rename just the /home/*USERNAME*/.config/libreoffice/*VERSION#*/user/config/ folder.  It worked for me, but I still have to test to see what all is now missing or different from how it was before the incident, and that happens over time when you discover stuff mid work flow.\nYou could even narrow it down by sub folder or even single (suspect) files within those.  Pinpointing the problem better will help with bug reports, and may give others a better starting place for trouble shooting.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.02 LTS Workstation Installer Doesn't Recognize Windows 7 I'm a new user evaluating Linux distros.

Now I recently did this with a Linux Mint partition a couple weeks ago and it worked fine, but I have heard Ubuntu is a better OS so this is the reason for me switching to Ubuntu.\nI wiped the Linux mint from the drive and used Universal USB installer (same as I did with Linux mint) to load Ubuntu onto my USB drive and attempted to to install on my blank partition.\nBut instead of being able to load from the USB, it boots up into GNU GRUB. I have done some research and all the instances I can find of this happening are when Ubuntu is already installed on the PC, nothing stating about it appearing when actually trying to install it.\nAny help or advice would be much appreciated as I was really looking forward to learning this OS.\nIn reference to the questions asked - \nYes I set my computer to boot from the USB, and yes as stated above I used the program Universal USB installer which takes the .iso file and 'installs it' into the USB device. \nI will tell you exactly what happens. I select the USB device as the boot device, computer restarts and when it restarts it brings this up:\nGNU GRUB  version 2.02~beta2-9ubuntu1\nMinimal BASH-like line editing is supported. For the first word, TAB lists possibile comand completions. Anywhere else TAB lists possible device or file completions.\ngrub>\nAnd from there on I have no idea what I am supposed to do. It obviously wants me to do something in this cli but I have no clue as to what to put. I most definitely do not have GRUB installed on my windows partition, so it has to be drawing it from my USB. \nI have previously tried the advice in the link they posted above and the suggestions that were listed did not work for me, hence why I decided to post it here.\nI do not know why this is so difficult to install Ubuntu (spend 5 hours now trying to figure out what to do) and Linux mint I was able to install within minutes. I would think both being Linux operating systems (and being similar in coding from what my OS teacher at my college has told me) that both should be able to be installed without a hitch.\nIf someone can just explain to me why GNU GRUB is appearing the way it is, and at least point me in the right direction as to what 'possible issue' there is I would be very thankful. As the only record of something like this happening is a grub rescue, which is not this. \n\nA: What I understand, is that your computer is not starting from the USB device.\nDid you set in your BIOS to boot from USB? Did you burn the image on the USB device the right was or did you just copy the iso like a file to the USB device?\nWhat do you mean by: It boot into Grub? Grub is the bootloader. Which Grub? On your harddisc or from USB?\n", "Q: How can I start up an application with a pre-defined window size and position? I'm wondering is there any way to achieve the affect of the Ctrl-Alt-Keypad shortcuts in Unity using terminal commands instead? I want a command that sets a gui window to half the size of the screen, either left or right aligned.\nBy way of background, I'm writing a script that runs after log in. It uses Zenity to ask whether or not I want to open my development environment (GVim and IPython side-by-side). I have been trying to achieve two equal-sized windows for these programmes by using set lines= columns= in my .gvimrc and c.IPythonWidget.width = and c.IPythonWidget.height = in my ipython_qtconsole_config.py. However, there are problems associated with this approach.\n\nA: The actual command you want is something like \nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,maximized_vert && \nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -e 0,0,0,$HALF,-1\n\nThat will make the current window take up half the screen (change $HALF to the dimensions of your screen) and snap to the left hand side. To snap to the right, use\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,maximized_vert && \nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -e 0,$HALF,0,$HALF,-1 \n\nYou can also play with wmctrl to get the ID of the windows you're interested in instead of using :ACTIVE:. I can't help there though since that depends on the windows in question. Have a look at man wmctrl for more. \n\nI've written a script for that. I don't use Unity so I can't guarantee that it will work with it, but I see no reason why not. It needs wmctrl, xdpyinfo and disper to be installed:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl x11-utils disper\n\nThen, save the script below as ~/bin/snap_windows.sh, make it executable with chmod a+x ~/bin/snap_windows.sh and you can run\nsnap_windows.sh r\n\nTo snap to the right hand side. Use l for the left side and no arguments to maximize the window. Note that it runs on the current window so you'll need to assign a shortcut to it if you want it to run on anything but the terminal.\nThe script is a bit more complicated than what you ask for because I've written it to work on both single and dual-monitor setups. \n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n## If no side has been given, maximize the current window and exit\nif [ ! $1 ]\nthen\n    wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b toggle,maximized_vert,maximized_horz\n    exit\nfi\n\n## If a side has been given, continue\nside=$1;\n## How many screens are there?\nscreens=`disper -l | grep -c display`\n## Get screen dimensions\nWIDTH=`xdpyinfo | grep 'dimensions:' | cut -f 2 -d ':' | cut -f 1 -d 'x'`;\nHALF=$(($WIDTH/2));\n\n## If we are running on one screen, snap to edge of screen\nif [ $screens == '1' ]\nthen\n    ## Snap to the left hand side\n    if [ $side == 'l' ]\n    then\n        ## wmctrl format: gravity,posx,posy,width,height\n    wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,maximized_vert && wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -e 0,0,0,$HALF,-1\n    ## Snap to the right hand side\n    else\n    wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,maximized_vert && wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -e 0,$HALF,0,$HALF,-1 \n    fi\n## If we are running on two screens, snap to edge of right hand screen\n## I use 1600 because I know it is the size of my laptop display\n## and that it is not the same as that of my 2nd monitor.\nelse\n    LAPTOP=1600; ## Change this as approrpiate for your setup.\n    let \"WIDTH-=LAPTOP\";\n    SCREEN=$LAPTOP;\n    HALF=$(($WIDTH/2));\n    if [ $side == 'l' ]\n    then\n        wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,maximized_vert && wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -e 0,$LAPTOP,0,$HALF,-1\n    else\n    let \"SCREEN += HALF+2\";\n    wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,maximized_vert && wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -e 0,$SCREEN,0,$HALF,-1;\n    fi\nfi\n\n\nA: I have build an application named Worksets (on github) for Unity that lets you do this easily through a graphical user interface - It's free and open source.\n\nIt's basically a wrapper for the wmctrl and xdotool solutions listed as answers here, and provides an easy way to quickly make and save such setups.\n\nA: You can do this using xdotool.\nTo install xdotool you can run:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nThen to send a Ctrl+Alt+<keypad_key> keystroke to the terminal X window you can run:\nxdotool key Ctrl+Alt+<keypad_key_value>\n\n*<keypad_key_value> = keypad key's value in the list below\nTo run a GUI program and send the keystroke to its X window (which in this case is the active window at the time of the xdotool command execution) you can run:\n<command> && window=\"$(xdotool getactivewindow)\" xdotool key --delay <delay> --window \"$window\" <keypad_key_value>\n\n*<command> = command that opens the window you want to send the keystroke to; <delay> = time to wait in milliseconds before sending the keystroke; <keypad_key_value> = keypad key's value in the list below\nNotice that in most cases you'll need to run the command you're issuing as a stand-alone process (e.g. by running nohup <command> & instead of <command> in the example above), otherwise xdotool won't be run until <command>'s execution is complete.\nAlso you'll need to set some delay, otherwise the keystroke will be sent before the target window is fully loaded in X (a delay around 500ms should do).\nThe possible values for <keypad_key_value> are:\n\n\n*\n\n*0: 90\n\n*1: 87\n\n*2: 88\n\n*3: 89\n\n*4: 83\n\n*5: 84\n\n*6: 85\n\n*7: 79\n\n*8: 80\n\n*9: 81\nAs a thumb rule, to find out the the value of any key on the keyboard within the X environment, one can run xev and hit the key to output its value inside the terminal.\n\nA: What you will run into\nIf you want to first call an application and, subsequently, place its window on a specific position and size, the time between calling the application and the moment the window actually appears, is unpredictable. If your system is occupied, it can be significantly longer than if it is idle.\nYou need a \"smart\" way to make sure the positioning/resizing is done (immediately) after the window appears.\nScript to call an application, wait for it to appear and position it on the screen\nWith the script below, you can call an application and set the position and size it should appear on with the command:\n<script> <application> <x-position> <y-position> <h-size> <v-size>\n\nAn few examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*To call gnome-terminal and resize its window to 50% and place it on the right half:\n<script> gnome-terminal 840 0 50 100\n\n\n\n*To call gedit, place its window on the left and call gnome-terminal, place it on the right (setting its v-size 46% to give it a little space between the windows):\n<script> gedit 0 0 46 100&&<script> gnome-terminal 860 0 46 100\n\n\n\n*To call Inkscape, place its window in the left/upper quarter of the screen:\n<script> inkscape 0 0 50 50\n\n\nThe script and how to use it\n\n\n*\n\n*install both xdotool and wmctrl. I used both since resizing with wmctrl can cause some peculiarities on (specifically) Unity.\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as setwindow (no extension) in ~/bin; create the directory if necessary.\n\n*Make the script executable (!)\n\n*If you just created ~bin, run: source ~/.profile\n\n*Test-run the script with the command (e.g.)\nsetwindow gnome-terminal 0 0 50 100\n\nIn other words:\nsetwindow <application> <horizontal-position> <vertical-position> <horizontal-size (%)> <vertical-size (%)>\n\nIf all works fine, use the command wherever you need it.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport sys\n\napp = sys.argv[1]\n\nget = lambda x: subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", x]).decode(\"utf-8\")\nws1 = get(\"wmctrl -lp\"); t = 0\nsubprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", app])\n\nwhile t < 30:      \n    ws2 = [w.split()[0:3] for w in get(\"wmctrl -lp\").splitlines() if not w in ws1]\n    procs = [[(p, w[0]) for p in get(\"ps -e ww\").splitlines() \\\n              if app in p and w[2] in p] for w in ws2]\n    if len(procs) > 0:\n        w_id = procs[0][0][1]\n        cmd1 = \"wmctrl -ir \"+w_id+\" -b remove,maximized_horz\"\n        cmd2 = \"wmctrl -ir \"+w_id+\" -b remove,maximized_vert\"\n        cmd3 = \"xdotool windowsize --sync \"+procs[0][0][1]+\" \"+sys.argv[4]+\"% \"+sys.argv[5]+\"%\"\n        cmd4 = \"xdotool windowmove \"+procs[0][0][1]+\" \"+sys.argv[2]+\" \"+sys.argv[3]\n        for cmd in [cmd1, cmd2, cmd3, cmd4]:   \n            subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd])\n        break\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    t = t+1\n\nWhat it does\nWhen the script is called, it:\n\n\n*\n\n*starts up the application\n\n*keeps an eye on the window list (usingwmctrl -lp)\n\n*if a new window appears, it checks if the new window belongs to the called application (using ps -ef ww, comparing the pid of the window to the pid of the application)\n\n*if so, it sets the size and position, according to your arguments.\nIn case an application does not \"show up\" within appr. 15 seconds, the script assumes the application will not run due to an error. The script then terminates to prevent waiting for the new window infinitely. \n\n\nMinor issue\nIn Unity, when you (re-)position and (re-)size a window with either wmctrl or xdotool, the window will always keep a small marge to the borders of your screen, unless you set it to 100%. You can see that in the image (3) above; while the inkscape window was placed on x position 0, you can still see a minor marge between the Unity Launcher and the inkscape window.\n\nA: I don't have the rep to comment directly on Jacob Vlijm's excellent post, but I modified the script to permit starting an application with arguments (necessary to use setwindow with gedit --new-window).

Bear with me here, people. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: The Swap total given by free reflects the swap space configured on your system, which is the amount of space that the system can use on disk if the amount of RAM is insufficient. An overview on swap can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq.\nIn the output you posted we can see that none of the swap is actually used, which means that the system has enough available RAM and doesn't need to page out any data to the swap space on the disk.\nReducing the available swap space won't help with any performance issues, it would just free up some more disk space.\nThe free output doesn't show any lack of RAM on your system, you have 1397 MB available for programs to use. I would guess that the problem lies either in CPU power or in networking issues. You could try to run top while the Minecraft server is running and post the content of the %Cpu(s) line to determine whether the CPU is the cause for the lag.\n", "Q: Eclipse install from USC fails I selected Eclipse from within USC and clicked the 'Use this source' button.

I tried to debug it using: \njuju debug-hooks discourse/0 install\n\nBut the folder where this shell that was started (~) doesn't have the hooks subfolder, as the documentation states. What is more, when I manually navigate to /var/lib/juju/agents/unit-discourse-0/charm/ and run the hook from there, using\n./hooks/install\n\nI get errors about environment variables being not set (like $CHARM_DIR) and commands not available (like config-get). The point is, the script does not even get to the GPG stuff that failed before, it fails on one of the first lines.\nWhat could have caused this? Is it my misunderstanding of the docs, or a bug in juju?\n\nA: The problem is possibly that your debug session is not in time to catch the install hook failing (https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/developer-debugging#debugging-early-hooks). In this case, the debugging terminal which is opened is merely waiting for a watched hook to activate (you get a new window for a hook event and the prompt will reflect the name of the hook). This is covered in the documentation.\nThe subsequent errors when you try to run the hook manually are because hooks need to be run from within the hook environment to access the runtime environment variables.\nYou can either modify the install hook (as mentioned in the link above) or it may be possible to infer what has happened simply by looking at the logs:\nhttps://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/developer-debugging#the-%27debug-log%27-command\n", "Q: How to deploy a charm to a specific machine in Amulet?

I have a fairly old desktop with a Pentium 4 and 1GB of RAM. I use it as a TeamSpeak server and to browse the web, not a lot of heavy-duty stuff, although I am considering building a website, in which case I would use it as a server. I currently run Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS. I tried the server version once but the installation process took too long and it wasn't absolutely necessary.\nRecently, the hard disk drive suffered a failure and lost data, so I will re-install Ubuntu. Given the hardware and purpose, is 14.04.2 LTS enough, or does the server version really bring more to the table? Or is 15.04 a great improvement, especially performance-wise?\nOverall, my question is this: Running Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS with a GUI as a small-scale server on an old system, is the server version or the desktop version more efficient in terms of required processing power?\n\nA: You are asking different questions essentially, and are also requesting an opinion.\nLet's split these analyses up then I'll add my two cents.\n\nDesktop vs. Server Edition\nWhich do you want to work with more, a GUI or a command line?  Better question, do you want to deal with the overhead of a graphical interface which will need memory cycles and video memory to run (in addition to the extra software you want to run)?  Another question: Do you need the GUI for Firefox or a web browser?\nIf all you are running are server processes I would ditch the GUI and use the Server variant instead.  This recommendation is based on the need of graphical interfaces vs. my knowledge of the command line.  Most of what servers need is on the command line. The Server edition doesn't come with a GUI installed and is command line driven compared to GUI driven (the GUI is just a graphical front end to run the commands the terminal would need transparently).\nIf you need the computer for Internet browsing and things which need the graphical environment (line word processors, spreadsheet stuff, etc.) as well, then don't use Server variant, just install the relevant server processes alongside the GUI.  Lubuntu will be the 'quickest' GUI for those specs as its lightest weight compared to the other variants.\n\nLTS or Newer Release (Non-LTS)\nThis is an easier question to answer in my opinion.\nThe LTS (14.04 currently) has a 5 year support cycle, meaning it gets security updates and patches for five years from its release date.  The trade off is that you don't get newer software versions (typically).  You trade cutting edge software (and newer features in them) for stability.\nThe non-LTS releases have a much shorter support period.  This means you will need to upgrade to a new OS version very frequently.  With each upgrade you run the risk of more things exploding.  After the support period ends you get no more security updates or bug fix patches for that release, and have to upgrade.  The trade off is that you get newer software versions but may sacrifice the stability of operation / version change differences and having to adapt software for each set of changes.\nI suggest using the LTS regardless of Server or Desktop edition.\n\nPerformance Comparison between 14.04 and 15.04\nI have no basis for comparison.  However, the GUI will be just as slow in 14.04 vs. 15.04 and will operate at similar speeds.  (this applies to 14.10 as well but as that EOLs in a couple months I would not use it)  Use Lubuntu with the LXDE environment for the lightest GUI (it won't lag or be slow as much compared to Unity on Ubuntu).\nThe server software will run about equally fast between 14.04 and 15.04.  The huge main difference between 14.04 and 15.04 is the init system - systemd is in 15.04 as primary instead of upstart as the primary.  The other big comparison point is the kernel version as well as the software versions available in each release.\nHowever, for just server functions, both will operate about equally well compared to each other.\n\nMy Opinion\nIf all you're running on this is server processes, like TeamSpeak server or a file server, and nothing large scale, it's up to you.  However, I would suggest using 14.04 LTS Server.\nI suggest this because stability of software version will likely be more useful than upgrading every new release.  I also suggest this because the graphics overhead is nonexistent and you have more resources freed up to the system and server processes.\nIf you want a GUI though, use Lubuntu 14.04 which has the LXDE GUI which is relatively lightweight compared to Ubuntu or the other variants.  It also will likely get core security updates for 5 years as well.\nYou should consider using newer equipment for GUI stuff, though.  GUIs are fine and all, but they add additional attack vectors on servers, and with the hardware you have listed GUIs will still likely be slower than on newer, more updated, hardware.\n", "Q: Using MAAS on Ubuntu 15.04 (Vivid Vervet) i have just downloaded Ubuntu 15.04 Server AMD64 (Vivid Vervet) ISO and wanted to setup MAAS.

I just want to know if its possible to save files on a live dvd and still have them on when you boot again. If it's impossible then thats fine, i'll be getting some thumb drives pretty soon. Thanks!\n\nA: I do not believe it is possible to make a LiveDVD on its own persistent without a USB to hold the persistence, and I also believe that the reason you can't comes down to the medium and why you can't sanely/safely write/erase/rewrite on CDs/DVDs so much compared to SSD/HDD/USB drives.\nUSB sticks are inherently reusable.  That is to say, data is written, erased, and rewritten on the drive until the memory chips wear out (there is a point where the equipment does just wear out and stop working either due to hardware fatigue and the chips stop working, or part breakage at the USB connector, or any other problem)\nDVDs are different.  Data is written to the disk by lasers and physically carved into the metal layer of the disk.  Persistence would need to be able to write to the disk, erase from the disk, and rewrite, which is only able to be one on DVD-RW, and even then it can only be done so many times (far less than USB) before the disk is no longer usable.  To do persistence you would need a USB to still hold the persistence.\nAlso, given the difference in read/write IO speed between DVD and USB (substantially different!) you may prefer to just use a LiveUSB to expedite boot, read/write, and execution times.\n\nA: In a short answer, yes, it can be done, but it has to be done with a USB for the persistence.  The LiveCD can still be used with it just fine.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCD/Persistence\nDVD/RW discs require to be over-written each time they are written to as the table of contents has to be recreated each and every time.  Thus, they would not be a good choice for a persistent LiveCD.\n", "Q: Netgear N600 router not connecting to wifi - help!

ACL is installed and active.\nI'm at a loss of what to do next. Obviously, without being able to copy files to the server, there's not much of a point. Thanks in advance for any guidance.\n\nA: For those who land on this page for solution.\nThis happens with Windows Server 2012 R2 not just Windows 8.\nIncreasing SEND and RECEIVE buffer might fix the issue.\nAdd the following line in your smb.conf and restart the services.\nsocket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192\n\nAnother alternative is to  edit /etc/sysctl.conf and add \nnet.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 32768 131072\nnet.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 174760\n\nThen run sysctl -p for the changes to  take  effect. But this only helps for smaller size files (100Mb). It gets transferred fast enough before it errors out. Large file transfer (above 1Gb) still fail. It might helpful for other applications though.\n", "Q: Unable to get execute bit on Samba share working with Windows 7 client I keep most of my files on an Ubuntu 14.04 box in Samba shares and access them from Windows 7 client machines.

So you should look at motherboards (not graphic cards) of the same line of the HP Compaq 6910p.\nThat being said, it might be very easy to upgrade a desktop's graphic card, while the same is not true for laptops.\nLaptops are not meant to be assembled / disassembled, and the internal parts (beside the HDD and the memory, and expecially the motherboard) are usually unaccessible prior to a complete disassembly of the laptop.

Looking at the examples from the systemd docs, an assignment should be a single string:\n\nExample:\nEnvironment=\"ONE=one\" 'TWO=two two'\nExecStart=/bin/echo $ONE $TWO ${TWO}\n\nThis will execute /bin/echo with four arguments: one, two, two,\n  and two two.\nExample:\nEnvironment=ONE='one' \"TWO='two two' too\" THREE=\nExecStart=/bin/echo ${ONE} ${TWO} ${THREE}\nExecStart=/bin/echo $ONE $TWO $THREE\n\nThis results in echo being called twice, the first time with arguments\n  'one', 'two two' too, , and the second time with arguments\n  one, two two, too.\n\nI tested this with the following service (note the quotes around the entire assignment):\n[Unit]\nDescription=My Daemon\n\n[Service]\nEnvironment='CATALINA_OPTS=-Dappserver.home=/var/lib/archiva/apache-tomcat-current -Dappserver.base=/var/lib/archiva/apache-tomcat-current'\nExecStart=/bin/echo ${CATALINA_OPTS}\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nAnd got the desired output in journalctl:\nApr 26 08:19:29 laptop echo[28439]: -Dappserver.home=/var/lib/archiva/apache-tomcat-current -Dappserver.base=/var/lib/archiva/apache-tomcat-current\n\n\nOf course, it would be simpler to use EnvironmentFile instead.

All I can say is that $ENV_NAME syntax worked to treat each argument in the variable which is separated by space, as distinct arguments, whereas the ${ENV_NAME}, treated them all as one argument.\nMaybe using echo is not the best way to tell this difference. I suggest anyone looking to test it to use something like /usr/bin/printf \"%s\\n\" ${ENV_NAME} vs /usr/bin/printf \"%s\\n\" $ENV_NAME, and see what they get.\n\nEDIT\nI found the documentation, thanks to another answer:\n\nBasic environment variable substitution is supported. Use \"${FOO}\" as\npart of a word, or as a word of its own, on the command line, in which\ncase it will be erased and replaced by the exact value of the\nenvironment variable (if any) including all whitespace it contains,\nalways resulting in exactly a single argument. Use \"$FOO\" as a\nseparate word on the command line, in which case it will be replaced\nby the value of the environment variable split at whitespace,\nresulting in zero or more arguments.

On an old Dell PC that originally ran Windows XP 32 bit that I erased the Windows XP 32 bit and installed Ubuntu 32 bit on with less than 2 gigs of RAM. I would like to upgrade the RAM above 2 gigs. So now that if I have more than 2 gigs of RAM should I then also upgrade the Ubuntu to the 64 bit OS?\n\nA: With regards to RAM, the only benefit is when you have more than 4gb installed.  Be sure that your motherboard will actually support more than 4gb, then go for 64bit.\nEither way though my opinion on 32bit vs 64bit is that running 32bit is like wasting half of your processor. Your OS can only handle 32 bits at a time but your processor can do double that. Mathematically speaking that is true.  \nI have but one question. Why have you not gone 64bit already?\n", "Q: btrfs: Resultant copy is twice the size of source I just got an SSD and wanted to migrate my current Ubuntu installation to take advantage of its performance.\nSo I booted to an Ubuntu live CD, mounted source (ext4) and target (SSD, btrfs mounted with compress-force=zlib,nodatacow,noatime,rw,ssd) drives and began copying files using rsync:\nsudo rsync -av --exclude=/home/ '/media/username/source/' '/media/username/target'\n\n# /home stays on HDD for now\n\nRsync finished the job without problems. The file count is similar (about 1.2 million files average, number obtained by right click > properties on Nautilus), but the resultant copy is 31GB, way larger than the source which is only 18GB.\nChecked sizes by various methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*df\n\n*Right click > Properties\n\n*btrfs filesystem df\n\n*Baobab\n\n\nAll gave similar results, source is way smaller.\nI know that btrfs uses some kind of metadata journal and \"shadow copies\" of files when COW is on. But COW is off and even if it were on, is the first population of data plus noway 12GB out of 31GB could be metadata; right? o.o\nAny idea on WTH is going on? or better yet, how to fix it?\n\nA: By default, btrfs puts files smaller than 4 KiB into metadata blocks (to avoid the extra seeks that would occur if the data were placed far away from the metadata); this is controlled by the max_inline mount option. In addition, btrfs will duplicate metadata by default unless mkfs.btrfs detects that the selected device is non-rotational when creating the filesystem; this is controlled by the --metadata option in mkfs.btrfs. Taken together, this means that the on-disk size of each file less than 4 KiB is at least twice its actual data size.\nAt 1.2 million files and 18 GB, the average size of your files is 16 KB, and I suspect a lot of these are smaller than 4 KiB. This might explain the significant increase in disk space usage over ext4.\nHowever, this explanation is suspicious because ext4—like most filesystems—is also inefficient in storing files less than 4 KiB since it defaults to a sector size of 4 KiB, which means that every file occupies at least that much space on disk. Btrfs is different here in that it tightly packs the inlined data in its metadata blocks. I expect btrfs to become more space-efficient than ext4 (under current default options) for files smaller than 2 KiB.\nThus, I think my explanation here is wrong unless you have a lot of files that are between 2 KiB and 4 KiB, or you are using non-default options for ext4 or btrfs.\nBut if this explanation is right, then you can reduce disk space usage in btrfs by not duplicating metadata: simply specify the --metadata single option when invoking mkfs.btrfs (obviously, this reduces redundancy, so the filesystem will be less resilient against metadata corruption). For an existing btrfs filesystem, you can convert duplicated metadata into single metadata using balance filters.\nIt is possible to disable data inlining using the max_inline=0 mount option, but I don't recommend this because it runs into the space-efficiency problem for small files that ext4 and other filesystems face.\n", "Q: Magnet Links open Deluge but don't start the torrent Initially, clicking a magnet link would do nothing, but after some research, I ran the following command:\nxdg-mime default deluge.desktop x-scheme-handler/magnet\n\nNow, as the title says, clicking a magnet link will open Deluge, but it won't actually start the torrent. \nI can't find any behavior similar to this and I'm stumped.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: When you click the magnet link and Deluge opens, does it actually add the torrent to the queue?\nI currently have the issue where clicking a magnet link will open Deluge but will not add the torrent. \nAs a workaround, you should be able to right click on the magnet link and copy the link address, then in Deluge go to File > Add Torrent > URL\n\nA: Non answer here, but I cant add a comment yet so adding this as an [non] answer.\nFor Chrome, it seems to run \"xdg-open\" when a magnet link is clicked with the magnet URL passed in as the $1 to the command.  This does successfully trigger Deluge to open, but it fails to actually add the torrent.\nIt used to work just fine for me in 14.04 and I just recently took the dive and upgraded to 14.04 -> 14.10 -> 15.04 and now it's broken.

How I can tell Synaptic Package Manager / Sofware manager to use the space available in /mnt directory (a separate partition) or alternative how I can move my installed applications to that partition?\n\nA: You should look at it the other way around: find your personal files and put those on the 2nd disk. Since it is a /mnt it will be external, if it is ntfs it is useless for Linux except for storing your personal files. The Linux system itself needs it to be ext. \nDon't move /home/ itself to an external partition. You can also link the directories in /home/ to the external disk (move the normal directories in /home/$USER/ to the external disk and from command line do ln -s Desktop /mnt/Desktop for every directory and after doing Desktop press F5 on your desktop; the icons should refresh). Make sure though the external disk is  mounted during boot otherwise you will see nothing on your desktop. \nIf you still lack space after moving documents and downloads from for instance /home/ to that partition it might be worth while investing in a bigger or a second internal hard disk. \n", "Q: Mounting Other partitions like windows does I have Ubuntu 15.04 and windows 8.1 dual booted in my dell laptop, whenever I boot my Ubuntu OS i have to manually click on the drive [say D drive on windows] to mount and open it.

That is not an option for me.\n\n*Running smartctl -t short /dev/sd[bcd] and later smartctl -l selftest /dev/sd[bcd] did not reveal any errors.\n\n*A number of resources that I found on the topic (1, 2) are not very specific about how (which commands) to change certain settings, not do they explain very well what they do & why they help.\n\n\nSome Background\nHow I set up the raid array\nI just added three 2TB Western Digital SATA (their \"green\" series) drives to my Ubuntu 14.04 server. They are /dev/sd[bcd].\nI decided to use them in a raid5 array and set everything up like this:\n1) Create one partition on each disk:\nfdisk /dev/sdb (same for sdc and sdd)\nBased on this blog post I chose 2048 and 3907029128 as the respective first and last sector on each disk. These numbers are divisible by 4, since these drives are 4K sector drives.\nThe fs type was set to da (Non-FS data), as per that blog post, which reads \n\nThis stops distribution auto-mount startup scripts for searching for superblocks on drives marked as “fd” and trying to mount them up in a funny order.\n\nSince the raid array is non-essential for booting up the system, that makes sense to me.\n2) create raid array using mdadm:\nmdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=5 --chunk=2048 --raid-devices=3 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 --spare-devices=0 --force\nThe --chunk=2048 option was also inspired by the same blog post, \"bear[ing] in mind the 'should be divisible by 4' logic.\"\nThe --spare-devices=0 --force options are my own creation, since without them the mdadm command would start the inital resync process, but quickly slow down to < 200K/sec, and then bail out with a message in /var/mail/root that /dev/sdd \"might have failed\". After that happening, the output of mdadm --detail /dev/md0 would show that /dev/sdd1 had been moved to be a spare drive.\nSince adding these options, the resync is continued running. It first slowed down to < 100K/sec but then speed increased to about 30000K/sec and stayed there.\nAbout the running resync process\natop reveals that /dev/sdd is the slowest\nDSK |          sdd  | busy    103% | read     930  | write    304 | KiB/r    512  |              |  KiB/w    512 | MBr/s  46.50 |  MBw/s  15.20 | avq   112.12 |  avio 8.10 ms |\nDSK |          sdc  | busy     85% | read     942  | write    384 | KiB/r    508  |              |  KiB/w    410 | MBr/s  46.75 |  MBw/s  15.40 | avq    20.59 |  avio 6.21 ms |\nDSK |          sdb  | busy     73% | read     942  | write    387 | KiB/r    508  |              |  KiB/w    411 | MBr/s  46.75 |  MBw/s  15.55 | avq    17.31 |  avio 5.31 ms |\n\nAbout the WD Green drives\nAll drives were bought at a different time (so I suspect they're from different production runs, months apart).\n/dev/sdb and /dev/sdc are the youngest and have 64MB cache. /dev/sdd has 32MB cache.\n\nA: Only minutes after posting this question, the initial resync cancelled itself again by moving the oldest of my disks to a \"spare\" location, before even hitting 100%.\nEven though the device did not reveal any smartclt issues, it turned out that it was in fact broken. This was established by badblocks, which revealed thousands of broken sectors.\nReplacing that disk with a new one fixed the issue for me.\n", "Q: Audio via NVIDIA HDMI skipping Everything else regarding audio, HDMI (video) ja the video card works, except seemingly not randomly the audio skips if I direct it over HDMI to my TV. And by seemingly not randomly it is very reproducible, though I cannot tell what exactly triggers it.\nThings that trigger a skip are definitely things like Variety changing the desktop wallpaper. This happens just about every time, causing 1-2 skips (each skip is under a second). Lots of typing (like I am doing now, causes skips every sentence or so). Lots of web page scrolling seems to trigger quite a bit of skipping too.\nI thought at first it was disk activity, but it is not - for example opening a 200mb bz2 file doesn't cause a skip at all. Also, not doing anything, causes no skips, if I turn off Variety and don't do anything, I get perfect no skipping audio (streaming video or watching an AVI for example).\nIf the computer is busy, like after boot, the audio is very crackly at first, skipping more than playing. Once things settle down, skipping becomes only intermittent.\nThe computer is not out of resources and skipping happens even with a few programs open.\nAn insanely annoying problem which I've tried many ways to tackle, including;\n\n\n*\n\n*newer kernel\n\n*newer HDMI drivers (via xedgers)\n\n*various audio debugging tips from community help\n\n\nWhen I use HDMI audio, I usually have a dual monitor setup.

However my problem is that every time I try to install Windows 7 on my computer, the installer reformats the drive to GPT, even thought I know it was MBR before. Here is my current setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*MB: Asus Rampage IV Black Edition (UEFI)\n\n*250GB SSD\n\n*Software to install: Windows 7 Professional 64Bit + Ubuntu 14.10 64Bit\n\n\nCurrently I am running Windows 7 Professional 64Bit on a GPT Partition table, I have a few flash drives that have a good amount of space, and finally I have experience in installing both Windows and Ubuntu.\nP.S. If you need more info, just ask, also I am still learning how to ask questions and answer them in the proper way here on AskUbuntu, so please recommend some changes to the question that would make it better, easier to read, simpler, etc... Thank You!! \n\nA: Fundamentally, the issue is not the partition table type (GPT vs. MBR); it's the firmware type and boot mode (EFI/UEFI vs. BIOS/CSM/legacy). Windows ties them together quite tightly -- Windows may boot in EFI/UEFI mode only from GPT disks, whereas it may boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode only from MBR disks. Because of this, if you boot the Windows installer in EFI/UEFI mode and it sees an MBR disk (or in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and it sees a GPT disk), the installer will complain or convert the partition table type.\nThe boot mode for the Windows installer can be controlled by the user, but the methods for doing this are non-obvious and vary from one computer to another. At best, when you enter the computer's boot manager (typically by hitting a system-specific function key soon after you power on the computer), you'll see two options for the boot medium, one of which includes \"UEFI\" in the description and one of which doesn't. The item with \"UEFI\" in the description boots to EFI/UEFI mode and the other one boots to BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Note that one mode or the other might be unavailable depending on how the boot medium was prepared; some tools set up boot media to boot in only one mode.\nUbuntu is not so limited; you can install to a GPT disk in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and the installer won't complain. I don't recall offhand how the installer reacts to an EFI-mode installation to an MBR disk. It might or might not work, but you can definitely coerce an MBR installation to boot in EFI mode if you know what you're doing and if your firmware doesn't freak out about it.\nThe critical detail is to get both your OSes' boot modes to be the same, since switching boot modes is usually awkward.\nIncidentally, I disagree with your assertion that it's easier to dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows with MBR (and, by implication, under BIOS/CSM/legacy mode). This was true with old computers that simply did not use EFI; but with modern EFI-based computers that support both boot modes, enabling both modes (which is normally required for BIOS/CSM/legacy support) creates additional boot paths and therefore additional ways to screw things up. It's this, not EFI mode per se, that causes most EFI-related headaches. Unfortunately, there's a lot of bad advice out there to enable BIOS/CSM/legacy support, install Ubuntu in that mode, and then clean up the mess with Boot Repair. Getting the Ubuntu installer to boot in EFI mode perplexes a lot of people because of the aforementioned non-obvious and non-standardized controls of initial boot mode; but overcoming this hurdle is likely to be much easier than fixing the problems created by trying to bypass the problem by doing a BIOS-mode install.\nThere is one caveat to my advice on this score, though: Some EFIs are still buggy and don't remember the OS they're supposed to boot. Thus, you can end up booting straight to Windows after Ubuntu is installed. There are various fixes and workarounds for such problems, and finding the one that's minimally invasive requires a certain level of expertise. I've answered questions about this many times on this forum.

I want to change the grub2 menu color to black and white, also if it's related I wanted to change the purple color that appear between transitions when the PC boot.\nI'm using Ubuntu 15.04.\n\nA: Instead of changing the background color, you could make an image the background.\nChoose a  PNG image, copy it, open terminal, run the command sudo nautilus /boot/grub, input password and Nautilus (Ubuntu explorer) will be opened. Paste your image in the folder you were redirected to. \nOpen a new Terminal window, run sudo update-grub, wait for the process to end and reboot your computer. The chosen image should be your GRUB background then.\nAbout the letters' color, it will be the perfect opposite of the background color.\nSo, if you want a black background, you could use this image.\n\nA: I would recommend checking out the site here.\nhttp://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/04/install-grub-customizer-ubuntu-1404/\nBut if you want the command for the program suggested in website, it is here:\nThe program is called Grub Customizer and I have used it before and recommend it.

As in, when I access the account when I am offline, will the attachment be available in cache?\n\nA: yes, by setting the 'set message_cachedir=/some/dir/' you specify the cache for full mail bodies including attachments. Whether it is available when you are offline depends on whether you downloaded/read the mail before.\nNote however that mutt does not allow offline reading. This means that you will have to use some external tools like grep in /some/dir/ to search for a mail and then extract an attachment.\nAlso note that each mail is a separate file and usually an attachment will be in base64 format, so you will have to extract the attachment from the text file manually and 'base64 -d' to decode it.\nThe recommended way is to use offlineimap.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 - Bluetooth - No adapters found - Dell Precision M4800 Post Ubuntu 15.04 upgrade, I found that the bluetooth was disabled on my machine.

I have searched the web but no luck.\n\nA: I wrote a blog post about this problem here:  http://cloojure.blogspot.com/2015/05/how-to-install-nvidia-video-card.html\n...which is pasted below. Please see the blog post for the missing screenshots.\n\nTuesday, May 26, 2015\nHow to Install NVIDIA Video Card Drivers for Ubuntu/Kubuntu Install or Kernel Upgrade\nI have a nice new Linux computer I got from ZaReason this past Christmas, and I decided to install Kubuntu (KDE + Ubuntu) in order to more nearly match my (really slick) XPS 13 Sputnik system from Dell, which comes pre-installed with Ubuntu.  I had previously used Fedora 20 on my desktop computer, but wanted to keep the OS on both computers more in sync, and Ubuntu also has better integration with sound, video, peripherals, and other desktop (i.e. non-server) hardware concerns.\nThe problem is that my nice new EVGA brand video card (with NVIDIA GPU) is not natively supported by Linux, so you have to download and install the drivers from the NVIDIA website. A current driver as of this writing can be found at http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html (it might be easier to google \"nvidia linux driver download\" than to directly navigate the NVIDIA website).  Look under the \"Linux x86_64\" category.  I always choose the \"Latest Short Lived Branch\" since it will have the most bug fixes (e.g. Latest Short Lived Branch version: 349.16).  Download this file to your computer, the do a power-off restart.\nThe power-off part here is important. In configuring the video card, we have a fundamental conflict between the motherboard's built-in video output and the \"non-standard\" video card output.  When you perform a fresh Linux install or upgrade the OS kernel, you are starting from ground zero and the video card will no longer work.  Unfortunately, the Ubuntu software update system seems to come up with a semi-major patch every month or two which requires the re-installation of the video drivers. While I could avoid the problem by refusing to perform software updates, I am always eager to get bug fixes and new features in all my other packages, and I just try to minimize the inconvenience of re-installing the video card driver on the new OS kernel.\nThe problem is that, when the video card quits working, you can't tell what is going on, much less fix it!  The following steps are the fastest way I've found to get around these difficulties.\nMy video card has three (yes, count 'em, three!) video outputs, and I have become addicted to using all three monitors.  Yes, I know, it might seem excessive, but trust me:  once you've tried three monitors, you'll never (voluntarily) go back to dual monitors again.  Of course, the motherboard built-in video output makes it four video output ports in total.\nMost monitors (I prefer the excellent 27 inch LG IPS 27MP65) have at least 2 inputs, both HDMI and VGA.  The trick is to use all three HDMI outputs from the NVIDIA video card to the three HDMI monitor inputs, and also connect a VGA cable from the motherboard built-in video output to one of the monitors (preferably the least-used monitor as the NVIDIA card sees it).\nIf only one video input is active, your monitor should normally be able to switch to the active input (HDMI or VGA) port automatically (especially when the monitor powers up).  If this sometimes fails, there should be a button labled \"Input\" or similar that will allow you to manually switch to the desired video input port.  Remember this, in case the monitor is displaying the VGA input and what you need to see is on the HDMI input, or vice versa.  If you find this problem is occurring, move the VGA cable to a monitor that is not trying to display HDMI.  It is much easier if you can see all active inputs simultaneously on different monitors.\nWhen you first install Linux (or after a kernel upgrade), the new kernel will not find the drivers for the NVIDIA video card and the built-in video output will be used.  The monitor connected to the built-in VGA output should show the single-monitor display, and you'll be able to install Linux and boot up. At this point, you need to learn a few tricks.\nThe first trick is knowing that the NVIDIA driver cannot be installed when Linux is in the normal multi-user mode with the graphical X-Windows display active.  You must boot into a single-user, text-only mode before installing the driver.  On Kubuntu (my favorite) or plain Ubuntu this requires a power-off restart.\nWhen booting, the GRUB bootloader will give you a 10-12 second countdown allowing you to select boot options before it attempts to auto-boot the newest kernel.  One of the options is to type the letter \"e\" in order to Edit the boot options.  This is what we need.  Type the \"e\" before the countdown timer expires.\nAt this point, you should see a screen such as this one:\nThe important part is in the lower-right-hand corner, where you can see the words \"quiet splash\" near the end of the next-to-the-last line.  The \"quiet\" part means that status messages to the console during boot are suppressed.  The \"splash\" part means that the OS boots into the multi-user, graphical X-Windows mode.  Both of these must be disabled in order to install the NVIDIA video driver.\nUsing the arrow keys, maneuver to the \"quite splash\" words, then use the Backspace or Delete key to remove the offending words and replace them with the single word \"text\".  When you are done, the screen should appear like this:\nYou may now follow the instructions at the bottom of the screen to continue the boot with your modified boot params (e.g. Crtl-X). You should see boot status/progress messages scrolling past on your VGA-port connected monitor.  Upon successful boot, the VGA-port monitor will look like this:\nVoila!  You have booted into single-user text mode.  Go ahead & login and navigate to the directory containing the new video driver (typically ~/Downloads).\nIn this screen shot, you can see that I have three NVIDIA drivers downloaded (I keep forgetting to delete the older two).  Note that I don't always download the absolute most recent driver for each OS kernel update (maybe 2-3 times/year I'll download the latest driver from the NVIDIA website). Pick the newest (or only) driver you have, and invoke it as shown with \"sudo bash NVIDIA-xxxxyyyyzzz.run\":\nWhile the driver is a shell script, I find it easier to invoke it using bash rather than change permissions and invoke it directly.  You need the \"sudo\" part since the video driver installation script must run with root permissions.  At this point, the driver will use \"ASCII graphics\" to complete the installation process.  It will stop about a half-dozen times to ask your permission for things.  Use the arrow keys to highlight the \"Yes\" answer, then hit  to invoke your selection.  Keep doing this until the installation is complete.\nAt the end of the installation, your VGA screen will be blank, and you'll be back at the command prompt.  Here, we need another power-off reboot.  Using \"sudo poweroff\" is a quick & easy way to do that.\nOnce the system has powered-off, hit the power button and begin a normal boot.  After the GRUB timer countdown, you will likely see an \"Ubuntu\" splash screen for a few seconds on the VGA output.  At this time, the computer should recognize your new video driver and switch to the three HDMI outputs of the video card and complete the boot process.  The VGA output will be unused from here on.\nIf your monitor is like mine, it may be confused by having VGA input that is active for 5-10 seconds, but then dies.  It keeps looking for the VGA input to come back and does not switch over the the (now active) HDMI input.  You can either use the monitor's Input switch to manually switch over to the HDMI input, or perform a quick power-cycle which should cause it to recognize the active HDMI input and ignore the inactive VGA input.\nThat's all, folks!

Then I wiped the hard drive partition that Ubuntu was installed on. After that the grub bootloader was still there when I turned my computer on. Today I merged, wiped, and formatted some partitions and when the pc tried to boot it displayed the grub rescue command line. I searched online for help but the Is command doesn't work. Can you please help me?\n\nA: If you're just sticking with Windows, I would recommend making a usb boot disk to boot into windows and restore the boot partition. I would recommend the same with Linux if you are keeping that.\n\nA: So I guess you must have installed the boot-loader sda1 while installing Ubuntu and hence you are landing at grub-rescue. As already pointed out, it is best to use windows DVD and repair the corrupted MBR. If you do not have windows DVD, you can also try using Rescatux tool.\n\nA: Well, I would NEVER recommend to delete any GRUB files. After you install Ubuntu, GRUB will be set as default. When you formatted those partitions, you removed essential GRUB files. First you need to know if the vmlinuz file is still in that partition. \nOn grub rescue prompt, type:\nfind vmlinuz\n\nAnd then press ENTER.\nIf this file is still there, then after you run the command above something like (hd0,0) will be prompted.

If anyone can help by posting a step by step process, it would be of great help \nThank you\n\nA: There is a very famous Linux and Mac program called Wine. You can use it to run Windows programs. There is no LoL Linux support, so you will have to do it through Wine.\nOpen a Terminal window (Ctrl + Alt + T) and type:\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nPress ENTER. You will be prompted for your password. Type it and press ENTER.\nWine installation will begin. It will download about 350 MB of data and then install Wine.\nAfter the installation ended, run winecfg in a terminal. Set default emulated Windows as Windows 7, apply and click OK.\nSome errors may occur (we are playing with luck), but anyway, download League of Legends, install it (just double-click the installer or whatever and Wine will do it by itself) and run the game. This should work, but if it does not, I do not know what to do. It is a very long process, but you have to understand LoL is not a game made for Linux, and issues are common, normally with 3D Windows games. \nIf this does not work, do not worry: There are many games for Linux. You can install Steam (sudo apt-get install steam in a Terminal) and many games that run natively, like Wolfenstein, Urban Terror, Counter Strike, Team Fortress and so on.\nUPDATE1: Hey, look: WineHQ LoL link! This website shows how Windows programs run under Wine, and LoL has Gold rate. This means that people can play it and there is no issue!

If you mistrust debootstrap or a library which it uses for the validation, you need to perform a sophisticated security review based on the source code.\n\nA: If someone searches for more details:\nI solved my problem with the fingerprints of the keyfiles (you can get them with apt-key finger) and compared them with other (secure) systems.\nMaybe helpful is this thread: How do I know my system updates are trustworthy?\n", "Q: Firefox reinstalled, but not xul-ext-webaccounts I wanted to reinstall Firefox, so what I did was:\nsudo apt-get purge firefox\n\nAnd this was the output:\nReading package lists...

How can I remove Ubuntu without having to worry about this?\n\nA: \nI read I could just delete the partition which I was about to do through windows 8's Disk managment,\n\nGo ahead. Mind though it will remove anything from disk. In case you need to save something use the Ubuntu installation disk to save it. By the way: there is not need to remove it from Windows. You will be prompted to replace a current Ubuntu installation during the setup. \n\nbut also read it removes grub which I need to boot my PC\n\nNo you do not. If there is just Windows on it you do not need it. Plus when removing your Ubuntu installation and installing a new version it will also install Grub.\n\nHow can I remove Ubuntu without having to worry about this?\n\nYou assume there is something to worry about ;) Mind though: when messing with partitions make sure if there is anything important on that machine to make a backup even if you do not intend to mess with the partition that important stuff is on (like the Windows partition).\n", "Q: Bash always evaluate Regex as true In a script, there's these lines\n#!/bin/bash\n\n...\n\nif !

What am I missing?\nUpdate\nFollowing comments and answers, I echoed $SCREEN_NAME, and nothing seemed wrong... until I did\necho \"*$SCREEN_NAME*\"\n\nand saw that the second asterisk was put on a new line. Here's how $SCREEN_NAME is set :\nSCREEN_NAME=$(grep -i 'server_screen_title' server.properties  | cut -f2 -d'=')\n\nThe value is read from the INI like config file.

I've read man for cut, but I'm not sure how to fix this, nor if I'm right on this one.\n\nA: I was too quick on this one, your test works. I suspect you somehow have set $SCREEN_NAME either globally or previously in the script as a string containing an illegal character.\n^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$ matches a non-NULL string containing only the allowed characters, so if $SCREEN_NAME is a non-NULL string containing only the allowed characters, $SCREEN_NAME =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$'s value is 0.\n! inverts its value, so if $SCREEN_NAME is a non-NULL string containing only the allowed characters, ! [[ $SCREEN_NAME =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$ ]]'s value is 1.\nSo the condition is ok.\nRun echo $SCREEN_NAME in both bash and your script and check whether the actual output matches what's expected.\nEdit: To remove the trailing carriage return, one solution is to pipe grep's output to tr before cut:\nSCREEN_NAME=$(grep -i 'server_screen_title' server.properties | tr -d '\\r' | cut -f2 -d'=')\n\n", "Q: Unable to login to Gnome-Shell in Ubuntu 14.04 How do you fix being unable to login to Gnome-Shell?\nI upgraded to 14.04 from 12.04 on a Macbook, and after some initial trouble configuring video, I was finally able to get the Nvidia driver to work and login as normal. My system was running fine for several weeks until after a routine package update that didn't require a reboot, when I suddenly became unable to login to Gnome-Shell. I only discovered the problem when I did Alt+F2 and entered \"r\" to reload Gnome-Shell to test how much memory would be freed up. \nInstead of reloading all the windows on my desktop, it closed everything and kicked me back to the lightdm login screen. From there, trying to login just makes the screen flicker, briefly shows me the Nvidia logo, then kicks me back to the login screen.\nI've tried all the solutions mentioned here, for similar problems logging in, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*deleting my ~/.Xauthority file and rebooting\n\n*reinstalling the ubuntu-desktop package and rebooting\n\n*ensuring everyone has access to write to /tmp\n\n*ensure all files in ~ are owned by me\n\n*checking ~/.xsession-errors for explanation (nothing's listed)\n\n*checking my ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile and ~/.bash_aliases files for any strange commands that might be erroring out.

How can I recover my partitons without loosing data.\nNote that GRUB Menu is not showing the option to boot into Windows 8.1.\nHere's the output of sudo parted -l, run from a live Ubuntu:\n\n\nA: From the screen photo, It seems like the installer wiped your hard drive. This was a known issue before 14.04, but it should have been fixed since, according to the bug status. If it really is as you said, please  file a new bug report for the Ubiquity package.\n\nI hope you made a backup before attempting a reinstall. If not, let this be you a lecture.\nIf you are using a SSD, you can basically give up all hopes. SSDs use a feature called TRIM, which erases deleted and invalid data blocks as to keep the drive fast.\nIf you need to recover files, stop using the installed system immediately and find another harddrive which you can use to back up your data, preferrably empty and big enough to hold your files - at least those which you manage to recover. Please always keep in mind that file recovery is basically gambling, no matter which tools you use.\nNow boot the Live Ubuntu on the installation medium (\"Try without installation\") and open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T). In there, use the following command to install the recovery suite TestDisk:\nsudo apt-get install testdisk\n\nThis will not affect your problematic hard drive, as the program will be installed to RAM (or live system persistency, if set up) only.\nNow, TestDisk is a pretty straight-forward, interactive recovery suite. To start it, you use the following command:\nsudo testdisk\n\nYou may first want to search for lost partitions. It should be TestDisk's first menu option. (Partition table Intel/PC/msdos). If you are lucky, TestDisk will manage to find the deleted partitions and gives you the option to create a new partition table. This will likely make the installed system unbootable.\nWhen the program manages to restore the partition table (even partially), you should be able to mount the formerly lost partitions and you may find your personal files. If so, copy them to an external hard drive (the one I advised you to get before.)\nIf not, use another tool called PhotoRec. It should already be installed with TestDisk and is also very simple to use. In this case, you may however not be able to restore the files' names.\nFor further information, read this very good article.\nGood luck! (You'll need it, if you don't have a backup)\n\nAs for your Windows, the default recovery partition is now gone. If you want to reinstall it, get a installation disk image from Microsoft (I hope they still provide any), put it on an USB or DVD and install it using the product key provided with your computer (may be inside the case). If you can't find any PK sticker, you should contact the PC manufacturer and ask for help. Some don't provide those stickers any more.\nEdit: Sometimes, the PK is stored in the BIOS, so a destroyed partition won't erase it. You will know, if your Windows activates itself without you entering a PK.\n\nBtw. you can take screenshots using the PrtSc key in Ubuntu, and they will be saved in ~/Pictures.\n\nA: Try opening a Terminal window (Ctrl + Alt + T) and run these commands:\nsudo su\nupdate-initramfs\nupdate-grub\n\nReboot and see if Windows is added as a menu entry.\n", "Q: OpenCL on Ubuntu 14.04 I am running Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 with a nvidia GTX 760 and I want to start working with OpenCL and C++. \nI installed the CUDA Toolkit 7.0 for Ubuntu 64Bit version and the current nvidia driver, but the function:\nunsigned int platformIdCount = 0;\nclGetPlatformIDs(0, nullptr, &platformIdCount);\nreturns always 0 in platformIdCount.

I noticed it happens when I put Kubuntu to sleep or shut it down with a dual monitor set-up and then trying to start it with the laptop screen only. Anyway, here's what I found - one particular folder is responsible for this mess. Deleting it fixes my problem.\nHere's what to do.

After going through few blogs and forums I came across solution but it didn't work for me. It's worth trying following commands and see if it solves your problem. \nmv ~/.kde ~/.kde.old\nshutdown -r now\n\n\n\nA: Following steps worked for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*From the grub menu select \"system settings\" which will put you to\nthe bios menu.\n\n*View boot order (no changes are required).\n\n*Save change and exit.\n\n\nBoot after steps 1-3 prevents blank screen. I do not know how but it worked for me well.\n\nA: So I faced this issue after changing my user password, and was only able to solve this after changing it back to the old one via 'passwd' command.\n\nA: TL;DR: Check if you have sufficient space in /var, /, /home. Insufficient space prevents xOrg server to start.\nTo get the system back, you can run startx in the terminal, which should give you some hints, as indicated by this reddit thread. This command starts the xOrg server. The proposed solution in the reddit thread with changing ~/.xinitrc didn't work for me.\nIf startx did indeed get your system back, you could reboot, back into the terminal and look if the xserver isn't running by running xset q as indicated here. Since echo $DISPLAY didn't return anything for me, I found these solutions, as startkde didn't work either (startkde would start the kde session). Most importantly, /var, /, /home should have enough space (check disk usage with df -h).\nThese solutions finally proved to be worthy, as I simply had no space left. After cleaning up some files and rebooting, KDE did start as usual. \n", "Q: Network problem after upgrading to Kubuntu 15.04 This problem started to occur after I upgraded to 15.04.\nI connect to wifi, after some time it disconnects, and after I try to re-connect it shows following:\n\n* Blured area are wifi names.\n\nA: Ok, as Guest I am unable to edit my Answer so I put it in this post.\nFor me it worked out just typing:\nsudo apt-get install -d --reinstall network-manager\nsudo apt-get install -d --reinstall plasma-nm\n\nSorry for the Post before...\nCheers Kaitsh\n\nA: if that is not working try this \nsudo sh -c 'echo \"options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf' \ndescribed in  Unstable wireless with Intel 7260 + iwlwifi after upgrade to 15.04 or here.\nGood Luck\n~Kaitsh\n", "Q: Swap doesn't seem to mount after update I updated to Ubuntu 15.04 and now my swap partition does not seem to mount.

There are several users on one PC - user1, user2... User2 has a scheduled daily backup. Will Deja Dup make user2's daily incremental backup, while user1 is logged in and using the PC?\n\nA: From the deja dup page:\n\nDuplicity\nDéjà Dup is really just a clever graphical wrapper around the command\nline backup tool duplicity. You can read more about it on its\nhomepage, but basically, it uses rsync to generate incremental,\nencrypted backup volumes.\nScheduling\nDéjà Dup does not use cron or similar schedulers. Rather, it starts a\nprogram deja-dup-monitor when you log into your session. This keeps\ntrack of when you last successfully backed up and will wait until the\nnext scheduled backup.\nIt determines exactly when the next scheduled backup is largely on its\nown, based on the user's preferences about whether to backup once a\nday, once a week, etc.\nWhy Not Cron?\nOne disadvantage is that a backup can not be started while a user is not logged in. The primary use case for Déjà Dup is backing up user data, so this is not a large concern, as user data is unlikely to change while the user are not logged in.\n\nSo no.\nBut Deja Dup is just a graphical front end for duplicity.

It is supposed that built in WiFi is enough for doing the 'conventional' stuff for using webapps(tweeting, fasebooking, and so on) or staring to UT calendar or calculating 1+1. Not cool by default.

The images are in a particular order, and need to renamed and numbered in the SAME order as before, just with a proper prefix and suffix.\nPyrenamer can accomplish the suffix, but only allows renaming using the current directory (not parent), making it useless the needed prefix.\nMy terminal knowledge is limited, as is my programming knowledge.

If I understood it correctly, it can emit a 2.4 (b/g) or a 5GHz (a/n) signal, but only the latter is suitable for a 300Mbs connection. I think the algorithm just chooses the one more stable, with less noise.

If you use the sudo blkid command to view partitions with their uuids or just view the /etc/fstab (considering you have got some NTFS partitions) you will probably notice that UUIDs of the NTFS partitions are 16 characters long with no dashes while ext2/3/4 and swap partitions have got traditional 32-char (16-byte) long UUIDs with dashes. Why so?\n\nA: The Microsoft filesystems (NTFS and the FAT brothers) don't support UUIDs the way ext*/btrfs/other Unixy filesystems do. What you see reported as UUIDs are some sort of serial numbers (64 bits long for NTFS, 32 bits long for FAT32). The only concrete information I can dig up from the Linux world is from the ntfslabel(8) manpage:\n--new-serial[=ssssssssssssssss], or\n\n--new-half-serial[=ssssssss]\n      Set  a  new  serial  number  to  the device, either the argument\n      value, or a random one if  no  argument  is  given.  The  serial\n      number  is  a  64  bit  number,  represented  as a sixteen-digit\n      hexadecimal number, used  to  identify  the  device  during  the\n      mounting  process.  As  a consequence, two devices with the same\n      serial number cannot be mounted at the same  time  on  the  same\n      computer.  This is not the volume UUID used by Windows to locate\n      files which have been moved to another volume.\n\n      The option --new-half-serial only changes the upper part of  the\n      serial  number,  keeping the lower part which is used by Windows\n      unchanged.  In this case the optional argument is an eight-digit\n      hexadecimal number.\n\nI suspect that these \"UUID\"s maybe the same as the serial number report by fsutil on Windows.\n\nA: Because those values aren't UUIDs; they're NTFS serial numbers. They're identified as UUIDs in /etc/fstab (and elsewhere) because the developers chose to use the identifier \"UUID\" for fundamentally non-UUID data, rather than use some other identifier.\nThe same is true of FAT, by the way, but FAT serial numbers are even shorter than NTFS serial numbers.\n", "Q: Cannot get wifi working on macbook pro retina I just installed Ubuntu on my MacBook Pro Retina, but am having trouble getting the wifi working.

I would like to know if there is any software out there for Ubuntu for using this device to capture videos from external devices.\n\nA: Using VLC I was able to get video to work on Ubuntu 16.04 by opening VLC and then choosing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Media -> Open Capture Device... Set Capture Mode to \"TV - analog\"\n\n*Device name to /dev/video1 Video standard to PAL (but will vary\ndepending on your output device)\n\n\nI can't get the audio to work with VLC but can record it in Audacity by choosing the \"usbtv:\" device.\n\nA: Easycap DC60 has been supported by versions 3 of the Linux kernel for some time. So it should all be a matter of plug'n'pray...,I mean, play.\nWith the cabling correctly plugged, VLC (available from the Software Centre) can be used to capture sound and image. You must access the menu Media > Open Capture Device and set the EasyCap device (e.g. /dev/video0) for recording (it can also be set for streaming). The Video For Linux 2 library is usually recommended for the job.\nThere are a few detailed guides out there on this, including videos. I suggested you take a careful look at this guide.\n\nA: Try the regular mpeg audio codec with any video format whenst recording-converting with VLC. After choosing the right audio input.\nUsing e.g. h/x264 mp4/mkv video with the usually well-corresponding aac-audio codec means havoc in VLC.\nVLC is probably the only relativily decent thing Linux has for recording from e.g. a tv or recorder with scart/AV/composite/s-video to usb (v4l).\nBut also VLC is far from ideal. Too messed up/complex interface, and it all also depends on the force of the used machine and the used libraries.\nThe recording button of VLC works well many a time, but the resulting avi-files are really unacceptably large (1 min recording = 1 Gb file size here).\nThe VLC makers say that recording like this takes the raw stream from the recorded device 'as-is' and that there is nothing to do about it. Not completely true. Take the EasyCap stick e.g., I used it with software from Arcsoft in Windows - I'm sorry - which gave me the choice to record directly to mpeg1 or mpeg2 (also from PAL). The resulting files could be easily cut up and transcoded afterwards. Considering the large transcoding times one would even stick to the original mpeg(2)-format. Anything not to get these ENORMOUS raw avi's which are only viewable with VLC itself.\nMore hardware-software testing required maybe?\nA to more acceptable videoformats configurable recording button with the same pause and continue functionality as with raw streams would be great in VLC.\nWell functioning recording-audio evenso.\n\nA: The best way is to use OBS studio to pull in and capture the combined video and audio streams using it's local record.\n\nA: This is a solution to capturing the audio (along with the video) from a camcorder using EasyCAP and VLC.\nAll posts I found use three different software to capture video and audio: \n\n\n*\n\n*VLC to capture video\n\n*Other audio tool, like Audacity, to capture audio\n\n*Then a third software to merge the video and audio\n\n\nThis solution consists of using just VLC to capture both audio and video.\nHere are the steps under Ubuntu 16.04 and VLC 2.2.7\n\n\n*\n\n*On VLC go to Media -> Open Capture Device... \n\n*Set Capture Mode to \"TV - analog\"\n\n*Set Device name to /dev/video1 \n\n*Set Audio device name to alsa://hw:2,0 (see the output of audio commands in my case, below)\n\n*Set Video standard to PAL (but will vary depending on your output device)\n\n*Click on Convert (In the drop down next to Play button) \n\n*Select file name\n\n*Enjoy\n\n\nThe outputs from audio commands on my box:\n$ arecord -l\n**** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****\ncard 1: Generic_1 [HD-Audio Generic], device 0: ALC269VC Analog [ALC269VC Analog]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 2: STK1160 [STK1160], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 \n\n$ cat /proc/asound/cards\n 0 [Generic        ]: HDA-Intel - HD-Audio Generic\n                      HD-Audio Generic at 0xf0344000 irq 35\n 1 [Generic_1      ]: HDA-Intel - HD-Audio Generic\n                      HD-Audio Generic at 0xf0340000 irq 36\n 2 [STK1160        ]: USB-Audio - STK1160\n                      Syntek STK1160 at usb-0000:00:12.2-2, high speed\n\n$ amixer -c 2 \nSimple mixer control 'Mic',0\n  Capabilities: cswitch cswitch-joined\n  Capture channels: Mono\n  Mono: Capture [on]\n\n$ amixer -c STK1160\nSimple mixer control 'Mic',0\n  Capabilities: cswitch cswitch-joined\n  Capture channels: Mono\n  Mono: Capture [on]\n\n", "Q: Wallpaper broken after version upgrade from 14.10 to 15.04 Yesterday I updated from 14.10 to 15.04.

I figured it just needed to be refreshed so I changed the wallpaper to another image. However instead of the image I still just got what looks to be a garbled mess of memory. It was however slightly different for every image I tried. \nOn the login screen the background image appears correctly.\nDoes anybody know why this is happening or what I might be able to do to fix it?\n\nA: It seems that my upgrade from 14.10 to 15.04 some how got messed up and failed to upgrade a large majority of packages. Re-running \nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nseemed to fix the problem.\n\nA: Try to insert a custom background, as the default backgrounds may have changed names. Also, if you have Unity tweak tool, hence the numix theme, reinstall it. It may be causing some problems with Unity, but you will keep the icon theme without the program installed. If none of that helps, compiz might have a bug. In this case you may want to consult the launchpad bug database to see if it has been filed.\n", "Q: Stream audio from VNC/RDP server My server is running Ubuntu 14.04.

I googled how to properly delete a package and now it wont work, at all.\n(Reading database ... 95881 files and directories currently installed.)\nRemoving spotify-client ...\n/var/lib/dpkg/info/spotify-client.prerm: 9: cd: can't cd to /opt/spotify/spotify-client\ndpkg: error processing spotify-client (--remove):\nsubprocess installed pre-removal script returned error exit status 2\n/var/lib/dpkg/info/spotify-client.postinst: 5: cd: can't cd to /opt/spotify/spotify-client\ndpkg: error while cleaning up:\nsubprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 2\nErrors were encountered while processing:\nspotify-client\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nI am more lost than I was before, please help.\nContent of /var/lib/dpkg/info/spotify-client.prerm:\n#!/bin/sh\n#\n# Copyright (c) 2012 Spotify AB\n\n# We could be smart and not clean up on upgrade,\n# but I worry that we'll leave old crap around\n# when we change things.\n\ncd /opt/spotify/spotify-client && ./unregister.sh\n\n\nA: The removal is failing because the pre-removal script can't be executed with success due to the failure of the cd command (such directory doesn't exist anymore); comment this line in /var/lib/dpkg/info/spotify-client.prerm by putting a # at the start:\ncd /opt/spotify/spotify-client && ./unregister.sh\n\nso that it becomes like this one:\n# cd /opt/spotify/spotify-client && ./unregister.sh\n\n\nA: You could always re-install Spotify, then use the proper method to remove it.  That way, you will have all the needed files on the system again.\n", "Q: How to install latest version of R on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS? I am not able to download the latest R version on my Dell Vostro 14 3000 Series laptop running on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. \nI typed in the standard commands on Terminal:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install r-base\n\nsudo apt-get install r-base-dev\n\nBut the net result is R 2.14.1 getting installed instead of R 3.2.0 (latest version) or even 3.1.1\nI'm a Linux / Ubuntu newb, so please do guide keeping that in mind. Cheers!\n\nA: GUI method\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Ubuntu Software Center, click \"Edit > Software sources...\"\n\n*On the \"other software\" tab, click \"Add...\"\n\n*Enter the following settings:\n\n*\n\n*Type: Binary\n\n*URI: http://cran.fhcrc.org/bin/linux/ubuntu\n\n*Distribution: trusty/\n\n*Components: \n\n*Comment: R CRAN\n\n\n\nThis creates a new \"software source\" that will be checked alongside the regular Ubuntu/Canonical software repositories. After you do this, you need to re-run sudo apt-get update to query the new repository. After that, your system will default to installing R from the CRAN source rather than Canonical, since the CRAN source will always have an equal or greater version number.\nImportant notes\n\n\n*\n\n*the URI line can have lots of different values, and you should pick one that is geographically close to you from the list of CRAN mirrors. cran.fhcrc.org is in Seattle, USA.\n\n*the Distribution line should match the \"codename\" of your Ubuntu version, which you can get by typing lsb_release -cs in a terminal window.\n\n\nTerminal method\nThere are good instructions here. Briefly:\ncodename=$(lsb_release -c -s)\necho \"deb http://cran.fhcrc.org/bin/linux/ubuntu $codename/\" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list > /dev/null\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E084DAB9\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:marutter/rdev\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev\n\nAgain, replace cran.fhcrc.org with a geographically appropriate choice from the list of CRAN mirrors.\n", "Q: Disable authentication prompts in 15.04? I'd like to know how I can disable the authentication prompts when opening apps such as Synaptic, mounting disks and so.\nI got my user as passwordless set in sudoers, but seems the change to systemd changed something and now I keep getting prompted. Is there any way to set it like sudo in /etc/sudoers so my user can open such apps unprompted?\nI am aware of the security risk, but this computer is not connected to the internet and no one else has access to it, I am aware of the safety risk, but I want to do this anyway, for convenience.\n\nA: As I understand it, these prompts use Polkit, not sudo, for authorization. Therefore, setting NOPASSWD in sudoers won't make any difference to it. To make Polkit skip password prompts, create a .pkla file in /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/ (say /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/99-nopassword.pkla) containing:\n[No password prompt]\nIdentity=unix-group:sudo\nAction=*\nResultActive=yes\n\nSee the pklocalauthority manpage for more information.\n", "Q: How to get xfce4 desktop at startup without the bloat? I'm trying to keep things fairly minimal, but it's tough!\n(Judging by what I read online, I have to pick for myself one of each of these:\n\n\n*\n\n*a display manager\n\n*a greeter\n\n*a window manager\n\n*a desktop environment\n\n\nSheesh.\nI don't know, maybe I don't need all of the above, but it's hard for me to tell what of this I really need, and what's bloat.)\nRight now, the way I have it is that I get a text-only login interface, and, after I log in, I run\n% exec startxfce4\n\nThis works OK, but I'd like to automate away that obligatory call to exec startxfce4.  I already have this very same command in ~/.xinitrc (in fact, it's all I have in this file), but apparently it's not enough.  What do I need to do instead (or in addition)?\nAlso, the text-only interface is OK, except that the font is tiny (I have a high-rez screen), hard to read.  I wouldn't mind having a graphical login screen, but I have not been able to find one that I can install without installing a bazillion other packages alongside, many of them with names featuring the word \"gnome\", which I want to avoid.\nIs there a really minimal graphic login that I can use to log into xfce4?\n\nA: Actually, you have already picked (4) - that's what XFCE is, a desktop environment, and thereby (3), the XFCE Window manager (xfwm). XFCE doesn't include a display manager, but other desktop environments do (GNOME has GDM, LXDE as LXDM, KDE has KDM, Unity has LightDM), and most display managers come with a default greeter. So, in effect, once you pick a desktop environment, you usually have the other three choices made for you.\n\n\nafter I log in, I run\n% exec startxfce4\n\n... I already have this very same command in ~/.xinitrc...\n\nThat's what startx does:\nTo  determine  the  client to run, startx first looks for a file called\n.xinitrc in the user's home directory.  If that is not found,  it  uses\nthe  file  xinitrc  in  the  xinit  library directory.\n\nSo you need to run startx on login to a TTY. The Arch Wiki offers a nice snippet for doing this:\n[[ -z $DISPLAY && $XDG_VTNR -eq 1 ]] && exec startx\n\nYou can add this to .bashrc, and when you login to TTY1 (see the check for XDG_VTNR), it will start the GUI.\n\nAs for display managers, the Arch Wiki lists quite a few, some of which are lightweight. You may have some luck with SLiM, whose dependencies are pretty minimal. It's also on the list of recommended apps by XFCE.\n", "Q: How to get mysql-server setup on Ubuntu 15.04?

I have Windows 10 and xubuntu installed on my laptop (dual boot) and divided the hard drive into three (+1) partitions: windows, ubuntu (+swap) and 'exchange'. 'Exchange' is thought as an partition for storing common data between Windows and Linux. It is automatically mounted under Windows and Linux.\nUnfortunately, the Windows \"hybrid\" shut down does not only lock the Windows partition but also the 'exchange' partition. When starting xubuntu after a regular (=hybrid) shutdown of Windows, xubuntu cannot auto-mount the 'exchange' partition.\nIn order to find out whether this is the case, one should use the command systemctl --failed. In my case it returned the information that the mounting of 'exchange' failed. \n\nA: The root cause was a change I did in fstab based on recommendations for solid state drives (SSD). I removed these lines and was able to reach the login screen with systemd:\n# ramdisks\ntmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults 0 0\ntmpfs /var/lock tmpfs defaults 0 0\ntmpfs /var/log tmpfs defaults 0 0\ntmpfs /var/run tmpfs defaults 0 0\ntmpfs /var/tmp tmpfs defaults 0 0\n\nMy opinion is that it is unnecessary to configure RAM disks for temporary folders in fstab. SSD can handle enough erase cycles to be used for temporary folders; where it makes sense systemd will configure a RAM disk itself (see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Tmpfs#Usage) so there is no need fot the user to tweak fstab.\n", "Q: Use rsync to backup .ecryptfs, but also use exclude some folders inside I want to backup the /home/.ecryptfs folder on my machine using rsync.

The best option I've found is the classic pm-hibernate, which works with no issues:\nsudo pm-hibernate\n\nYou also have the option of a hybrid suspend/hibernate. From the man pages:\npm-suspend-hybrid\n    Hybrid-suspend is the process where the system does everything it needs to hibernate, but suspends instead of shutting down.

I chose the former, but still the latter was installed and causes problems (how do I switch between them ?)\nIn particular I now cannot unlock a locked screen: after I type my password, it blacks out briefly then comes back to the login screen. I can't start a new session either. After I reboot I get a crash screen about a sddm-greeter crash. Also there's no [Off]/[Reboot] buttons on the login screen.\nOnce logged in, if I try to log out or reboot I get plenty of crash window for various kde and sddm components and can't cleanly logout/reboot.\nSomething else very annoying: there's no more console in Ctrl-Alt-F2 and others.

The TERM environment variable defaults to xterm so the .bashrc file does not provide full color in the shell by default.\nHow to I change the TERM environment variable to xterm-color for the gnome terminal emulator app only?\nUpdate: By full color I mean changes the command prompt to use color in addition to displaying output such as directory listing in color too.\n\nA: There are two issues here.\nOne is how to detect if you're running inside gnome-terminal (or any other app using the same vte widget for the current terminal emulation). Assuming you're on a recent enough Ubuntu, the presence of the $VTE_VERSION variable tells you this. You could edit your .bashrc to contain something like\nif [ -n \"$VTE_VERSION\" ]; then\n    # Gnome-terminal and other vte3-based emulators\n    color_prompt=yes\nfi\n\nThe other issue is that for some reason Ubuntu's default .bashrc tries to look for xterm-color which is not really used nowadays. Either the standard xterm (which supports colors anyways), or the more modern xterm-256color are the popular choices, the default slowly moving towards the latter. (gnome-terminal changed its default from xterm to xterm-256color in 3.16, which is present in Ubuntu 15.10 beyond)\nIf you would like to move forward and already enjoy plenty of colors in several applications, I recommend that you already switch to TERM=xterm-256color, which you could also do in the if-branch above.\nUbuntu's .bashrc is obsolete for using xterm-color. I much rather recommend modifying these bits in the script around whatever $TERM you already have (xterm) or would prefer to have (maybe xterm-256color), rather than the other way around, modifying $TERM to match .bashrc's requirement.\n\nA: For gnome-terminal\nEdit the profile settings in gnome-termninal:\n\nReplace /bin/bash with your shell command and use your parameter for TERM.\nYou can also edit the entries with dconf.

As I see it, there are 3 possible solutions depending on your situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're using open-source graphics drivers, install proprietary drivers with proper hardware acceleration.\n\n*Get a more powerful graphics adapter with proper Linux drivers.\n\n*If the message comes from the guest system of a virtual machine, you may need to set up “guest extensions” and an appropriate set of graphics drivers to make use of hardware acceleration.

Help on how to activate such debug logs would be appreciated.\n\nA: So your node is a VM, right?\nMAAS will call virsh as the \"maas\" user, so ~maas/.ssh/id_rsa has to exist, be correct in terms of permissions and be a private key allowed to login on the host where the VM is running.\nYou can test it by becoming the maas user on the MAAS machine and trying to use virsh as MAAS would. For example:\nsudo -H -u maas virsh -c qemu+ssh://you@<host-where-vm-is>/system list --all\n\nAlso note you need libvirt-bin installed on the MAAS server, since that's where the virsh command comes from.

So, how can I get the original condition from my USB drive like it was before I tortured it?\nI don't mean to make it as new as when I buy it for the first time. I just don't know, when it was new is it NTFS or FAT32? Is it /dev/sdx or /dev/sdx with /dev/sdxy inside it?\n\nA: It was probably FAT32. The question of \"naming\" the device depends on how many devices you have connected. You can see the current filesystem by executing mount.\n\nA: There's no way to estabilish the filesystem the drive was shipped with, anyway if you're going to use the drive with Startup Disk Creator that's irrelevant because the drive will be repartiotioned / reformatted by Startup Disk Creator itself.\nWhether/dev/sdX or /dev/sdY is used, that's irrelevant as well, because the naming just reflects the internal order in which the drives were enumerated; e.g. if a system uses two SATA hard disks and an USB drive, the first SATA device detected at boot time (which is usually the drive using the first used SATA connector between SATA1, SATA2, SATA3 [...]) will always be /dev/sda, while an USB drive connected after /dev/sda and /dev/sdb after the boot is complete will always be /dev/sdc.\nAlso note that /dev/sdX is used to reference a device, while /dev/sdXx is used to reference a single partition.\n", "Q: What is an origin and solution for \"port 9000: Connection refused\" error?

I tried to follow Hadoop Wiki suggestions on this error (hadoop/ConnectionRefused) but I did not succed (I am a beginner Ubuntu user and find it difficult even to 100% understand the suggestions given). I posted a stackoverflow question from which I conclude that I have some general problem with port 9000 Connection.\ntelnet output:\nmartakarass@marta-komputer:~$ telnet localhost 9000\nTrying 127.0.0.1...\ntelnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused\n\nnmap output: \nmartakarass@marta-komputer:~$ nmap localhost\n\nStarting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-04-27 11:09 CEST\nNmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)\nHost is up (0.00022s latency).\nNot shown: 995 closed ports\nPORT    STATE SERVICE\n22/tcp  open  ssh\n139/tcp open  netbios-ssn\n445/tcp open  microsoft-ds\n631/tcp open  ipp\n902/tcp open  iss-realsecure\n\nNmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.08 seconds\n\nNetcat configuration:\nI tried to make use of the following command to force the 9000 port to be open:\nnc -k -l 9000\n\nbut it did not work well (I was still not able to perform the standlone operation mentioned and linked above).\nJudging from my google research results, I see that the problem is quite common and poses a huge struggle especially for those who are not good at \"admin-job-related issues\". As I belong to those, I kindly ask for answers to the following questions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Q1: What is the origin of such problem in general? (Some for a layman introductory words / references about basic issues connected to ports / connections etc. would be very very welome).\n\n*Q2: How to deal with this problem? \nUpdate. \nsudo netstat -nlp | grep :9000 \nreturns nothing. \n\nA: TL;DR first, more details following:\n\"Connection refused\" is the error you get when you try to connect to a service on a computer or server (or locally on your own computer) when the said service is either not listening on the specified TCP port (wrong port or service not started), or when a firewall explicitly rejects a connection instead of ignoring the request (not very common behavior).\nAnd now a little more detail:\nIt can only happen with TCP (UDP services are sessionless) and this error is indeed very common for sys admins.\nWhen a client application connects to a TCP service, it'll send a first packet with the SYN flag set. If we simplify, there are two possible answers to that:\n\n\n*\n\n*The server actualy listens on the required TCP port and replies with a SYN-ACK packet to acknowledge the SYN packet, after which the clients rends an ACK packet to \"confirm\" to the server that the SYN-ACK was received. That's the moment where you have established a TCP session, and when you can start \"talking\" with the server.\n\n*The server receives your SYN packet, but isn't listening on the requested port. The connection is rejected with a packet that has the RST (reset) flag set. This is 99% of the time when you get the infamous \"connection refused\".\n\n\nHow do I fix this ?\nWell, there are a few things you can check: Are you querying the right port on the client side ? Is your service started ? Is it listening on the right port ?\nThose three questions will generally help you solve your issue.\nQuick generic command to be entered on the server (the machine that runs the service)\nChecking that the service is listening on the expected port\nss -nat | grep <enter port number here> | grep LISTEN\n\nSome people on older systems might also use this\nnetstat -an | grep <enter port number here> | grep LISTEN\n\nIf you don't see anything here that looks like your port number, your service is either not started or not listening on the port number you specified.\nChecking that the service is running\nservice <service name> status\n\n\nA: Try do disable iptables:\nsudo service iptables stop && sudo service ip6tables stop\n\nThen restart hadoop.

If money is no objection, I would advice a Mac. \nMany people want or need MS Office or Photoshop. If so, bad luck! Using Wine to get that working is a nightmare. I've tried it, and it doesn't work. After a while some problem will emerge, and it will be ugly. Virtualbox for these things is no option either, even a windowless VM will be confusing, with different GUIs. And it will result in the question - if Linux can't do this, why would I want it?\nIf they only browse the net, use Gmail or Hotmail or other online stuff, maybe Thunderbird, then you might get lucky. If they only use simple Excel sheets, without macros, and Word documents where layout it not important, then LibreOffice might be an alternative. \nI see Ubuntu as a better alternative for Chrome OS for \"normal\" people. I use it as work desktop and may switch to it from my Mac in the future, although to be honest there are just too many apps that I can't do without. \nIf security and money are issues, then Ubuntu is a good choice. It runs on old hardware, it's easy to update and maintain if you stick to a default setup. \nI can understand what you want, but be honest and think what is best for your clients. And if Windows fails often, doesn't that mean more money for you?\n\nA: You can say that there is a possibility to install Windows software using Wine and maybe show them a computer with working Windows software. I also strongly recommend using MATE. And I presume you are installing software for them, so tell them about Windows software available as Linux versions. Also, you can point out that almost everything in Linux is free, show them how does apt work and how easy is to install software using apt-get or aptitude. Also, there is a plenty of software available as equivalents but for free.\n", "Q: How to install Ansys15 in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?

I did it manually (that means I do not want to use tools like uck or remastersys). \nI used this tutorial (German) that works fine in general. The part with chroot I changed, of course, so that all runs without interaction in a script.\nThe CD boots fine after building the ISO in VirtualBox.\nMy question now is: I want to set some user-settings (e.g. .mozilla profile in home folder).\nI think I should put this in /etc/skel. The script copies e.g. \".mozilla\" to /etc/skel (confirmed), but \".mozilla\" is not in live user's home folder (/home/ubuntu/).\nIt seems that what I copied to /etc/skel is completely ignored, but I do not know why. Could you help me?\n\nA: Files in /etc/skel must be in place before first user login.\nP.S.: I think what I find the problem - your script creates home directory for user:\nsudo mkdir -p \"${WORK}/new/home/xubuntu/\"\nsudo mkdir -p \"${WORK}/new/home/xubuntu/Desktop/Anleitungen\"\n\nYou need to use /etc/skel for this too.\n", "Q: Spotify not starting since updating to 15.04 Since updating to to 15.04 my spotify will not open.

Of course, I did have multiple .conf files corresponding to the prefixes specified in the /etc/rsyslog.d directory.\nLogging to the same file does work.\nCan someone explain how the --log-prefix works? Does the last one override all previous specifications? Or are we supposed to get multiple log files as I expected? Or is it an error to provide multiple prefixes?

I am managing a few dedicated game servers on a Ubuntu server 14.04 machine. These games are downloaded and updated by the SteamCMD tool, which for some games, requires login from the command line arguments, which are plain readable text.\nI created a few scripts to automate the processes of updating the servers every time the machine restarts, which are run by the user's cron.\nAnyway, long story short: I need to find a way to securely store a password in a executable script. I'm thinking of storing just the encrypted password and somehow decrypt it before plugging it to the steamcmd arguments, and of course set user permissions to let just the owner user read it (or even just execute, is it possible?). Any advice on that?\n\nA: *\n\n*For highest security, you would want to store the password in only one place, that is your mind. But this is not a option as you want to completely automate the process and this method will require you to enter the password everytime.\n\n*You might have a look at hashing encrypting technology like gpg. But even here, you will need to remember and enter a passphrase, so bad option.\n\n*You might think that you will store the password in encrypted text file and hard-code the passphrase. But that isn't going to make any change.\nThe best midway solution would be,\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the password in a simple or encrypted text file. Make the file readable only by root user. Otherwise, just hard-code it into the program.\n\n*Make the program readable and executable only by root user.\n\n*If possible, deny all access to the computer by other users or guests.\n\n*Encrypt your partition, so even an attempt to reset root password won't help to read your files.\n\n", "Q: How do I add my own Python program to the terminal?

I have recently imported my shotwell photo library to a new installation of 15.10 'standard' ubuntu. All seems ok except that it is not displaying the key event images. Even if I set a new key event image, I still just have grey boxes in the event view.\nAny ideas how to restore these images?\nShotwell v 0.22.0\nThanks!\n\nA: If you start shotwell from the terminal, you'll probably see messages like\nUnable to fetch preview for Event ... Failed to open file <file_name>: No such file or directory\n\nUsually shotwell recreates missing thumbnail files on demand, but this feature seems not to work for key images of events.\nSo in principle you should be able to recreate your event preview by opening the event and browsing the preview of all the contained images, which will trigger the thumbnail creation.\nThere is another caveat with the thumbnail recreation though: As only needed thumbnails are created, the size you set for the preview images when browsing the event does matter. At first I browsed the images using a small preview size in order to fit as many images as possible on one screen, but this triggered thumbnail creation only for the lowest resolution thumbnails and the event image was still not shown. After setting the preview size to max and browsing the event again the required thumbnail was finally available :-)\nWhich thumbnail size you need to generate for your event image is shown in the error message on the terminal as part of the name of the missing file. The path usually contains the folder thumbs360 for high resolution thumbnails or thumbs128 for low resolution thumbnails (I think these two are the only sizes used by shotwell).\nWhen browsing your event to trigger thumbnail creation do not scroll through your images to fast! shotwell will only work on visible images (so just opening the event or jumping to the last image won't create any thumbnails for the images in between) and it needs some time to process the images (in my version it creates a low resolution thumbnail first and I needed to wait for the preview to improve from scaled low resolution to high resolution thumbnail before scrolling to the next screen).\n", "Q: How to install Gnome Software Center in Ubuntu Gnome 15.04?

Or am I totally offtrack?\n\nA: You do not need to depend on the NAT in the DSL modem, you can still do it on the Ubuntu router box, even with a dynamic public IP address.\nYou wouldn't want to do it unless you are confident in the security of your iptables rule set.\nSometimes DSL modem/routers have no option to turn off the router (NAT) stuff, in which case what you are doing is fine.\nAnd yes, with default policies of ACCEPT, and forwarding enabled,\n$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n1\n\nit is as simple as the one POSTROUTING rule (copied from your comment):\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o em2 -j SNAT --to 192.168.2.2\n\n", "Q: aircrack-ng : airmon-ng stop working after updating to 15.04 ( ioctl(SIOCSIWMODE) failed: Device or resource busy ) my aircrack-ng suite was working correctly until i updated to 15.04\ni unsintal evrything and intsaled again form repositories to discard weird stuff and the problem is stil there:\n sudo airmon-ng \n\n\nInterface   Chipset     Driver\n\nwlan0       Atheros AR9565  ath9k - [phy0]\n\n    kcdtv@profezorapplestruff:~$ sudo airmon-ng start wlan0\n\n\n    Found 5 processes that could cause trouble.\n    If airodump-ng, aireplay-ng or airtun-ng stops working after\n    a short period of time, you may want to kill (some of) them!\n\n    PID Name\n    595 avahi-daemon\n    599 NetworkManager\n    678 avahi-daemon\n    749 wpa_supplicant\n    795 dhclient\n\n\n    Interface   Chipset     Driver\n\n    wlan0       Atheros AR9565  ath9k - [phy0]SIOCSIFFLAGS: Le nom n'est pas unique sur le réseau\n\n                    (monitor mode enabled on mon0)\n\n    kcdtv@profezorapplestruff:~$ sudo airodump-ng mon0\n    ioctl(SIOCSIFFLAGS) failed: Name not unique on network\n\nI tryed to habilitate and deshabilitate network manger etc...\nthe only walk around i found is to bring down the interface and activate mode monitor with iwconfig \nWhich does not satisfy me.\nif i install aircrack-ng svn version i get the same fail but a more details in the shell:\n    kcdtv@profezorapplestruff:~$ sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon\n[sudo] password for kcdtv: \nioctl(SIOCSIWMODE) failed: Device or resource busy\n\nARP linktype is set to 1 (Ethernet) - expected ARPHRD_IEEE80211,\nARPHRD_IEEE80211_FULL or ARPHRD_IEEE80211_PRISM instead.

Open your network manager configuration file as root in order to edit it\nsudo gedit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\n2. Add the following lines to prevent network manager from interfering  with airmon-ng\n[keyfile]\nunmanaged-devices=interface-name:wlan0mon;interface-name:wlan1mon;interface-name:wlan2mon;interface-name:wlan3mon;interface-name:wlan4mon;interface-name:wlan5mon;interface-name:wlan6mon;interface-name:wlan7mon;interface-name:wlan8mon;interface-name:wlan9mon;interface-name:wlan10mon;interface-name:wlan11mon;interface-name:wlan12mon    #  avoid conflicts with airmon-ng\n\nThe wlanXmon interfaces are just for monitor mode... So there is no problems if network manager can't manage them : It shouldn't!\n  You can add as many interfaces as you want, 12 should be enough unless you are a addicted to buy wireless USB. Use the separator ; between every interfaces.\n3. Saves the changes. Effects are immediate: you can now use mode monitor on one interface while you are connected to the Internet through network manager with another interface.\nSolution previously published in aircrack-ng forum >\nEdit NewtorkManager.conf to prevent conflicts with airmon-ng (no check kill)\n\nA: Forget about airmon-ng script and try this:\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 down\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 up\n\nNow you can use airodump-ng with your interface in monitor mode:\nsudo airodump-ng wlan0\n\nHope it helps.

How can I do that?\n\nA: You can do this fairly easily with the rename command. The only problem is preserving the extension. We start by replacing all the dots, but then replace _png with .png. You'll obviously need to adapt that for other extension types.\ncd /path/to/images\nrename 's/\\./_/g; s/_png$/.png/' *.png -vn\n\nNote: the -vn on the end will only demonstrate what it would do.

It could fairly easily be extended to a general .ext extension if you have more than one file type, for example\nfor f in *.*; do g=\"${f%.*}\"; e=\"${f##*.}\"; echo mv -- \"$f\" \"${g//./_}.$e\"; done\n\n", "Q: no sound after upgrading to 15.04 I have upgraded my system to ubuntu 15.04.

And becuase Wine hates you, it stores all the filetype icons not in mimetypes directory but in app directory of every resolution. In my case this file was named text-plain.png but that will depend on it's mimetype.

This shifted processing of events from the hardware (the touchpad) to software (the Linux input driver stack).\nThis results in the Logitech T650 touchpad not sending keyboard events such as Back for three fingers. Since there is no multi-touch driver that processes gestures, you do not get the event either.\nWorkarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install a kernel version before 3.19 (or just the hid-logitech-dj driver from previous versions).\n\n*Enable both reporting of gestures as well as raw events. Since the events reporting is very sluggish after this method, I won't explain it here.\n\n\nA forward solution should recognize the multi-touch functionality of the Logitech T650 touchpad and then generate appropriate events for gestures.\n", "Q: How can I re-enable ASLR?

And the answer is: ALL of them are incompatible. xUbuntu or any Linux based operating system is 100% different compared to Windows. Except for some software where the creators decided to make 2 versions, 1 for us and 1 for Windows you can use the same software. Examples of those are Libre Office/Open Office, Apache, MySQL.  Libre Office/Open Office are replacements for Microsoft office though it works differently and has other names for similar tasks. Basically it has a Writer program to create documents, A Calc to create sheets and many more.\nFor Adobe Fireworks see Is there an alternative to Adobe Fireworks?\nAnd yes there is WINE/Play On Linux to support windows software but this has its limits, problems and generally is not a good experience. If you need Windows software you are better of with a Virtual Machine or using a dual boot with xUbuntu and Windows.\n\nMy Windows XP CD for my laptop is lost\n\nIt is legal to download a copy of Windows XP from the web if you have a serial sticker on your machine. You paid for the license not for the medium the software was on.\n\nA: Photoshop and Microsoft Office can be run on Xubuntu with the Wine program. For information about the rest of the programs on your list, just check the programs at the WineHQ Application Database one at a time to see if they will run in Wine. WineHQ not only tells you if an application will run in Wine, it also tells you a rating of how well the application will run in Wine and tips for how to install it. \nThere is no need to do a reverse search from a list of programs that are not supported by Wine. The way the WineHQ Application Database works is you do a keyword search at WineHQ for the Windows application that you want to install and WineHQ returns links to webpages about installing that application in the search results. In other words WineHQ works the way Google works by doing a keyword search and returning results that are related to the search term.  \nWine is a large application and there is a lot to know about how to get the best results from Wine. In addition to the Wine application itself, there are other applications like PlayOnLinux and CodeWeavers CrossOver that extend the functionality of Wine.

Now in PHPMyAdmin, I see the following:\nServer: Localhost via UNIX socket\nServer type: MySQL\nServer version: 5.5.43-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 - (Ubuntu)\nProtocol version: 10\nWeb server\nApache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)\nDatabase client version: libmysql - 5.5.43\nPHP extension: mysqli Documentation\n\nMySQL version is 5.5.43-0ubuntu0.14.04.1.  How can I safely and securely install and use mysql 5.6.4+ as I need to use FULLTEXT with INNODB. I see the packages in the Ubuntu repository, but I really should avoid any conflict or installation problems.\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: \nHow can I securely safely install \n\nIt will always be tricky.\nPlease read the 5.5/5.6 compatibility page before doing anything. Mind 1 big difference between the 2:\n\nBeginning with MySQL 5.6.6, several MySQL Server parameters have defaults that differ from previous releases. The motivation for these changes is to provide better out-of-box performance and to reduce the need for the database administrator to change settings manually. These changes are subject to possible revision in future releases as we gain feedback.\n\n1 of the big changes is that 5.5 uses 1 big file as a transactions log and 5.6 uses several: \n\nTherefore, if you are upgrading an existing MySQL installation, have\n  not already changed the values of these parameters from their previous\n  defaults, and backward compatibility is a concern, you may want to\n  explicitly set these parameters to their previous defaults. For\n  example, put these lines in the server option file:\n [mysqld] \n innodb_file_per_table=0 \n innodb_checksum_algorithm=INNODB\n binlog_checksum=NONE\n\n\nIf you use replication pay attention to this part of the link:\n\nTo upgrade servers used for replication, upgrade the slaves first,\n  then the master. Replication between the master and its slaves should\n  work provided that all use the same value of explicit_defaults_for_timestamp:\nBring down the slaves, upgrade them, configure them with the desired\n  value of explicit_defaults_for_timestamp, and bring them back up.\nThe slaves will recognize from the format of the binary logs received\n  from the master that the master is older (predates the introduction of\n  explicit_defaults_for_timestamp) and that operations on TIMESTAMP\n  columns coming from the master use the old TIMESTAMP behavior.\nBring down the master, upgrade it, and configure it with the same\n  explicit_defaults_for_timestamp value used on the slaves, and bring it\n  back up.\n\nIf this is a production server I would advice to first attempt this on a testing machine. We have had a rather difficult transition from 5.5 to 5.6 and opted to install another machine that was installed with 5.6 and use mysldump to create backups and load them into our databases on that machine. Mind though that this will take a long time if you have a large database (due to the recreation of the innodb transactions files). \nA general method:\n\n\n*\n\n*use mysqldump to create backups of your database (users, trable structure and table data) and of your config file (probably /etc/mysql/my.cnf)\n\n*Remove 5.5. After removing 5.5 check that the innodb transactions files are gone (ibdata1, ib_logfile0 and ib_logfile1). As 5.6 uses the better version of transactioning I assume you also would to use this...\n\n*Install 5.6 \n\n*Change the new config file and add in what you changed for 5.5 (mind though the link above and check if any of the changes have become invalid).\n\n*Upload your backup into 5.6 (users first). Mind that this can take a bit of time since it will recreate new transaction files.\n\n\n\nIn commands (after making the backup):\nsudo apt-get remove mysql-server\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get install mysql-client-5.6 mysql-client-core-5.6\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.6\n\n", "Q: Bash sed to read auth into debconf-set-selections for Vagrant VM I have a Vagrantfile that uses a bash script to set up a VM.

I have a laptop, and most of the times I use it it's connected to a monitor. But this monitor has a different resolution than the screen of my laptop, so the background image I use on my monitor doesn't fit on my laptop screen. Is there any way that I can make Ubuntu change the wallpapers when my monitor is connected/disconnected?\n\nA: It will take a background script to keep track of whether the second monitor is connected or not. \nThe script below checks every five seconds if that is the case, and sets the wallpaper accordingly.\nThe script also remembers the set wallpaper for the two states (connected/disconnected) in a hidden file. The file is automatically updated if you change the wallpaper for either one of the situations.\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as change_wallpaper.py\n\n*In the head section of the script, set the name of your second screen (run the command xrandr from a terminal window, to see the screen's name in the output). I left \"VGA-0\" as an example.\n\n*Start the script with the command (from the terminal):\npython3 /path/to/change_wallpaper.py\n\n\n*Connect the second screen, wait a few seconds and set the wallpaper. (the wallpaper has to be changed to remember it). Again wait a few seconds. Disconnect the second monitor, set the wallpaper for the single- monitor situation.\nIf the wallpaper is set for both situations, the script should change the wallpaper automatically. If you change the wallpaper as usual, the script will remember it for the corresponding situation (connected/disconnected)\nIf all works fine, add it to your Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15&&python3 /path/to/change_wallpaper.py\"\n\nThe script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport time\n\n#--- set the name of your secundary screen below\nsecond = \"VGA-0\"\n#---\n# the script uses the key org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri to set/change the wallpaper\nkey = [\"gsettings get \", \"gsettings set \",\n    \"org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri\"]\n# set the name of the wallpaper- datafile(s)    \nwallbody = os.environ[\"HOME\"]+\"/.wallpaperset\"\n# define the string to be found (or not) in the output of xrandr\ntocheck = second+\" connected\"\n\ndef set_wallpaper(w):\n    try:\n        cmd = key[1]+key[2]+' \"'+open(wallbody+str(w)).read().strip()+'\"'\n        subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd])\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        pass\n\ncheck = lambda cmd: subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n# first call of xrandr, and get the current wallpaper\nxr1 = tocheck in check(\"xrandr\")\nif xr1 == True:\n    set_wallpaper(2)\nelse:\n    set_wallpaper(1)\nwall1 = check(key[0]+key[2])\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(5)\n    # second call of xrandr, and get the current wallpaper\n    xr2 = tocheck in check(\"xrandr\")\n    wall2 = check(key[0]+key[2])\n    # if the second screen either connects or disconnects, change the wallpaper\n    if (xr1, xr2).count(True) == 1:\n        w = 2 if xr2 == True else 1\n        set_wallpaper(w)\n    # if wallpaper is changed, remember the new wallpaper\n    elif wall2 != wall1:\n        w = 2 if xr2 == True else 1\n        open(wallbody+str(w), \"wt\").write(wall2)\n    xr1 = xr2\n    wall1 = wall2\n\n", "Q: How to fix these problems installing imgdupes I'm trying to install imgdupes, but the terminal says pip command not found.\nhttps://github.com/jesjimher/imgdupes\nsudo apt-get install python-cffi python-dev libjpeg-dev gir1.2-gexiv2-0.10\nsudo pip install texttable\nsudo pip install jpegtran-cffi\n\nI entered:\nsudo apt-get install python-cffi python-dev libjpeg-dev gir1.2-gexiv2-0.10\n\nSo why is pip unknown?

If I run it:\n    $ /usr/lib/gnome-terminal/gnome-terminal-server\n    Non UTF-8 locale (ANSI_X3.4-1968) is not supported!\n    $ \n\nSo a simple fix is to start gnome-terminal as follows:\n    $ LANG=en_US.utf8 /usr/bin/gnome-terminal\n\nYou can add the LANG=en_US.utf8 to your ~/.bashrc by adding the following line to it:\n    export LANG=en_US.utf8\n\nand logging out and logging back in. (or rebooting)  (Note, that if you are not in the USA, substitute your own locale, as long as it ends in utf8)\nNow, as to why either gnome-terminal-server requires this or why the proper LANG isn't set, I don't know.  Strangely, my Ubuntu box at home has no problem running gnome-terminal, but my work box does.  I have compared the two systems and cannot immediately find the difference.  (I don't set the LANG variable on the machine that works!)\nOh, and on the system where gnome-terminal doesn't work, I simply started xterm instead...  Not perfect, but good enough to get a terminal running to examine things.\n\nA: I had the same problem as the initial question. Since my initial upgrade failed, I installed 15.04 by first removing the old installation in the initial install process. After installation terminal would not launch. Still it was running several times according to System monitor.\nIn another discussion someone suggested that if you check System Settings > Language Support the system suggest that internationalisation or language support installation was not finalised. After finalisation (I'm using three languages) the terminal started working.\n\nA: To fix this problem, you have to\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out your user name. It is NOT your display name. Most likely it won't contain capital letters, nor spaces. If you remember it from somewhere, it is good, jump to 5. If not, do as follows:\n\n*Press Alt+F2, then enter \"gedit\" in the window. It will something like \"Text Editor\" or so, open it.\n\n*Click Open, then Other Documents, then browse to Computer, and select the file /etc/passwd.\n\n*Search for the line that has the number 1000 after x, that is, [YOUR_USER_NAME]:x:1000:33:Default User,,,:/home/[YOUR_USER_NAME]:/bin/bash or something similar. Look for the 1000, and that line will start with your user name.\n\n*Switch to \"regular tty\" (character console) using Ctrl+Alt+F1. Please remember in time that you can switch back with Ctrl+Alt+F7 anytime.\n\n*At the login prompt, enter your user name (found above or known), then your password. You will get logged in to a \"full screen terminal\".\n\n*Enter sudo -s at the prompt. (You can also use \"sudo su\", if you read that on the Internet, but it is better knowing what you actually do; -s is the \"shell\" switch, it is DESIGNED for this function.)\nThen enter your password - again.\n\n*At the root prompt # enter dpkg-reconfigure locales. You will have a scary blue window with a grey area, and a lot of locales available under Locales to be generated:. Use the cursor keys to pick en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 and en_US UTF-8, plus anything else you might need (but be sure that locales having your language AND ending in UTF-8, if it is not US English, also be selected). You should use space bar to toggle a locale.\n\n*When all picked, press TAB to select \"Ok\", and press ENTER.\n\n*Now you have the window for selecting the default locale for the system. Pick one from the list, but do not leave it on None, then press ENTER again.\n\n*Now the system will generate your selected locales and configure the system accordingly.\n\n*When all this is done, you should reboot your computer to make sure that the environment will be updated. For this, switch back to the graphical terminal with Ctrl+Alt+F7 then reboot as usual, or just enter reboot at the root prompt.\nIn fact, in the last step, restarting the display manager with service lightdm restart should suffice, but if not, you will need to reboot anyway.\nNow your terminal should operate as expected.\n", "Q: Deja dup crashes while restoring backup I wanted to upgrade from 14.04 to 15.04.

Select a mirror that is both close to you and also seems unlikely to be too slow or interrupted.\nHere is how to ensure that you will have a successfully completed download. Open the terminal. Change directories using the cd command to a directory where you can easily find the OpenSUSE iso file after you have downloaded it. For example to change directories to your desktop use the command: cd ~/Desktop/. Next run the following command:\nwget -c 'download-link-of-OpenSUSE-iso-file'  \n\nwhere you replace download-link-of-OpenSUSE-iso-file with the link of the OpenSUSE iso file that you want to download. The -c flag in wget -c will enable the download to continue from the same place it was stopped if it is paused or interrupted. Unless you stop the download manually, it will resume the download automatically from the same place in the file where the download was interrupted. You can even pause the download and continue the download from a different mirror from the same place it was stopped, in case the first mirror that you selected is downloading the file too slowly. For example, if you intend to download the openSUSE-13.2-DVD-x86_64.iso file here is that file's worldwide Mirror List, and you can be sure that some of the mirrors on the list are much faster than others.\n\nA: Two interesting programs, wget and aria2. Although I would recommend aria2. Aria2 can download a file from multiple sources/protocols and tries to utilize your maximum download bandwidth. Really speeds up your download experience.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal: Ctrl+Shift+T\n\n*Pick a mirror from this list\n\n*Download the file with a download manager:\n\n\n*\n\n*aria2\nInterrupted downloads automatically continue\nCan download a file from multiple sources/protocols and tries to utilize your maximum download bandwidth\n\n\n*\n\n*Install aria2\nsudo apt-get install aria2\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\n*\n\n*Start a download with this command:\naria2c -x2 http://ftp.uni-kl.de/pub/linux/opensuse/distribution/13.2/iso/openSUSE-13.2-DVD-x86_64.iso\n\nThe -x option specified the number of allowed connections, while the -k option specified the size of chunks.\n\n\n*wget\nEXAMPLE\n\n\n*\n\n*Start a download with this command:\nwget --continue http://ftp.uni-kl.de/pub/linux/opensuse/distribution/13.2/iso/openSUSE-13.2-DVD-x86_64.iso\n\nfrom man wget:\n--continue\nContinue getting a partially-downloaded file.

An example of a path that I'd like to exclude is /var/websites/com.site1/backup and all of its subdirectories.\n\nA: Use find in this way:\nfind /var/websites -type f -mtime -3 -not -path '*/backup/*'\n\n-not -path '*/backup/*' will cause find to ignore the files that have /backup/ in their path. The trailing / in /backup/ is to ensure that this will only consider backup as directory names.\nAlso note that to get precise result regarding time you should use -mmin instead of -mtime.

I have started my upgrade process in the morning, after more than 12 hours it is still installing the upgrades?\nIs it normal or something went wrong?\n\nA: There's a bug where the installer hangs instead of formatting the partition in some cases.  I ran into it doing a \"Something Else\" install, but managed to press on by starting over with an \"Upgrade\" install.\nIf you provide more info, someone may be able to tell if this is your situation.\n", "Q: Mac only booting into Ubuntu and not rEFInd I installed rEFInd on my Mid-2010 13-inch MBP and installed Ubuntu on another partition. The Mac does not boot into rEFInd to select OS X or Ubuntu, it only boots into Ubuntu. I can still access the data on my OS X partition from Ubuntu, but I can't boot into the OS X partition.\n\nA: Try holding down the Option (or Alt) key as you start up the computer. This should provide you with a menu you can use to select the OS to boot. Using that menu, boot to OS X. You can then re-install rEFInd. With any luck that will fix the problem.\nIf you continue to boot straight to Ubuntu, look for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode; if it's absent, you've booted in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. If you boot Ubuntu in EFI mode, you may be able to use efibootmgr to adjust the boot order -- but Macs are a bit weird and doing this may not work in quite the normal way.\n", "Q: Need my random effects to show the full line I am working on a script for random predictions and unfortunately instead of the script taking the full lines from the two random lists (Things and Effects) it prints a random word from each.

In your primary script the array is being created out of the entries of variable separated on the default IFS value i.e. space, tab and newline.\nIn a nutshell, you need to change those two array declaration lines to:\nIFS=$'\\n' things=( $Things )\nIFS=$'\\n' effects=( $Effects )\n\nSo, your final script:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Random lists picks\n# This is a script for picking random choices as a prediction.\n\n\nThings=\"Walk\nSong\nTalk\nFriend\nSpontaneous act\nCall\"\n\nEffects=\"will bless you\nwill lift your spirit\nis healthy\ncan help\nwill touch you\nwill make you smile\nis what what you need\nmakes a difference in your life\ncan add comfort\nisn't necessarily without virtue\nadds something to your day\"\n\n\n\nIFS=$'\\n' things=( $Things )\nIFS=$'\\n' effects=( $Effects )\n\nnum_things=${#things[*]}\nnum_effects=${#effects[*]}\n\necho -n \"A ${things[$((RANDOM%num_things))]} \"\necho \"${effects[$((RANDOM%num_effects))]}\"\n\n\nA: I think you had a little misunderstanding with the use of arrays.\n#!/bin/bash\n# Random lists picks\n# This is a script for picking random choices as a prediction.\n\n# Create array \"things\"\nthings=('Walk'\n'Song'\n'Talk'\n'Friend'\n'Spontaneous act'\n'Call')\n\n# Create array \"effects\"\neffects=('will bless you'\n'will lift your spirit'\n'is healthy'\n'can help'\n'will touch you'\n'will make you smile'\n'is what what you need'\n'makes a difference in your life'\n'can add comfort'\n\"isn't necessarily without virtue\"\n'adds something to your day')\n\n# Place the array size\nnum_things=${#things[@]}\nnum_effects=${#effects[@]}\n\necho -n \" A ${things[$((RANDOM%num_things))]} \"\necho \"${effects[$((RANDOM%num_effects))]}\"\n\n", "Q: vivid - failed to connect to upstart: connection refused Just updated via do-release-upgrade and now certain upstart jobs such as fail2ban and plexmediaserver will not start (have tried reinstalling)\n$ sudo service fail2ban start\nJob for fail2ban.service failed.

The recommended practice is to change your upstart jobs to systemd jobs (see the wiki article for more info). You can also switch back to upstart if you want, which is certainly the quicker fix.

I'm trying to setup a dual boot with Ubuntu 15.04 and OS X using refind.\nI shrunk the OS X partition and have freed up enough space for Ubuntu.  Now I'm trying to create the Ubuntu partition, but I'm not sure what I should pick for these two questions?\nType for the new partition: Primary or Logical\nMount point: /, /boot, /home, /tmp, /usr, /var, /srv, /opt, /usr/local\n\nA: On a GPT disk (which is what Macs normally use), there's no such thing as a \"logical partition\"; that's a partition type that's unique to MBR disks. Some Linux partitioning tools, such as GParted and perhaps the Ubuntu installer's partitioning tool, ask you to identify GPT partitions as primary vs. logical, but this question is unnecessary and confusing on a GPT disk. Note, however, that a logical volume management (LVM) configuration uses logical volumes. These have nothing to do with logical partitions. LVM may be used as a layer atop either MBR or GPT.\nEvery Ubuntu installation requires a root (/) partition. Other partitions (/boot, /home, /tmp, /usr, and so on) are useful or necessary in some situations, but aren't strictly required for most installations. Ubuntu's default partitioning scheme gives most disk space to / and some (typically a bit more than your RAM capacity) to a swap partition (which has no mount point). Personally, I recommend doing it this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*10-40GiB for /\n\n*\n\n*Use low values if your disk space is low or if you know you want a minimal setup\n\n*Use high values if you've got disk space to burn or you know you'll want to install tons of software\n\n\n*A bit more than your RAM for swap\n\n*Whatever's left for /home\nIf you know enough to create additional partitions or use RAID or LVM, you can certainly deviate from this. I don't mean to imply this setup is perfect for all uses; it's just a first-pass recommendation for users who are relatively new to Ubuntu and who want to control partitioning themselves rather than rely on Ubuntu's defaults.\n", "Q: Multiple problems when upgrading from 12.04 to 14.04 I initially experienced problems in attempting to upgrade from 14.04 to 14.10, and gave up attempting this. \nAs a result of these failures, I had to return to factory settings, namely 12.04.\nNow, when I try to upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04, one or a combination of the following happens, apparently in random order/frequency:\n\n\n*\n\n*Password loop when logging on \n\n*Screen freezes on wallpaper setting when I have logged in\n\n*Laptop will not connect to the Internet by wireless (or, it seems, wired) connection\n\n\nI have tried to solve these problems separately as they have arisen, but with little success.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Is it feasible for you to install 14.10, rather than upgrading to it?  I find upgrading to be frequently problematic.\nI moved to a Debian flavor of Linux Mint (based on Ubuntu), because it has rolling releases and never needs to be 'upgraded'.  As a general rule, you should also partition your harddrive so you can perform full install 'upgrades' without affecting your user files/settings/apps/etc.\n", "Q: Skyrim with PlayOnLinux audio is choppy I've been playing The Elder Scrolls V on Ubuntu 14.10 with wine (PlayOnLinux).

I haven't figured out why, but the unity settings are probably messed up.\nYou need to start the compiz config settings tool. I couldn't figure out how to start it from command line so I started up a cinnamon session where I could start the settings tool. In the settings tool I, quite frankly, messed around a bit. Checked and unchecked the OpenGL plugin and the unity plugin. I think the latter is probably what made it work, since it yelled back at me with warnings and conflicts.\nAfter this.

Help please!    \n\nA: It is literally impossible for them to be monitoring your computer screen via the OS in real-time if you are not connected to the network. I go through some possibilities below.\nDelayed Logging\nThey could be logging everything to a file somewhere on the computer and then uploading the log when the computer returns to the network. This is the common practice with keyloggers.\nIf they are making comments in real time this cannot be the case.\nYou are Still Connected\nYou could still be connected to the network even though you think you aren't. Perhaps you only disconnected ethernet but are still connected on wifi. Or perhaps they have hijacked your network manager to always stay connected. You can make sure this isn't the case by physically disconnecting your ethernet cable and wifi card.\nThis is very unlikely since you said the problem persisted from Windows to Linux. Assuming they have infected your computer with some virus, the hack must be below the operating system, and thus running at a privilege higher than the kernel. If this is the case, you are dealing with pro hackers, and \"wiping\" the hard drive might not remove the hack; depending on the attack vector they could have told the hard drive never to overwrite those sectors.\nButton Camera\nThey could have a spy camera somewhere watching what you do.\nCheck your laptop, work area, and person thoroughly for anything resembling a camera. Also try covering different areas with paper to see if this stops them.\nDirect Observation\nSomeone could be looking over your shoulder.\nThis could be the most likely option.

Everytime I try to login on a remote server via SSH or try git pull/push on a git repository I get the prompt:\nEnter passphrase for key '/home/th0th/.ssh/id_rsa':\n\nI want to add my key to the keyring and I want the keyring to be unlocked when I login without being asked for passphrase (I think this was the default behaviour on gnome-shell on Arch Linux). I tried adding my key using seahorse but even my key is visible under Gnome2 Key Storage category in seahorse I get prompted for my passphrase on terminal. Is this a bug or am I missing a step here?\nEDIT: Preventing seahorse from prompting for password is another issue. My problem is that, SSH key passphrases are not remembered by gnome keyring.\nI am on 15.04 BTW.\n\nA: The core problem is that you have a password-protected SSH key.  What this means is that the private key is actually encrypted, and needs to be decrypted for use, hence the need for a passphrase.  (This same logic applies to PGP key actions such as signing, where you need to use the private key to generate a signature).  There should be an SSH authentication agent, or at least an agent working with gnome-keyring (14.04) which would be handling the 'prompts' and the 'gnome-keyring', however consider that this is not always the case when working in a CLI environment.\n\nSeahorse should present your SSH keys under \"Secure Shell\" and nothing else, which may be causing one problem.  But the main issue is that the SSH key's private key half is encrypted and password protected, and the password is needed to initiate the 'secure' negotiation section with the key.  However, it isn't actually seahorse which controls the authentication, it's actually part of gnome-keyring which has to memorize things.  While it should be able to remember your password, it's apparently not able to operate in the way it needs to to provide you a GUI prompt to put in the password and then store the password in the keyring.\n\nThe only true way to remove the password prompt there on all cases is to remove the password from the SSH key.  While SSH keys should ideally have passwords as an additional layer of protection, ideally you will only store the password for the private key for the duration of the session, or the duration of the GUI session until you log off or reboot, or even ideally for the short time that you are doing the SSH key authentication.  This is done for security purposes, but in some cases it's not feasible or necessary.\nIf you wish to remove the password from your SSH key, then you will need to follow these steps: (source)\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the passphrase.\nopenssl rsa -in ~/.ssh/id_rsa -out ~/.ssh/id_rsa_new\n\n*Backup and replace your private SSH key.\nmv ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa.backup\nmv ~/.ssh/id_rsa_new ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\n*Set key permissions, as private keys are owner-readable only (this is OpenSSH enforced)\nchmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\n*Test the connection via SSH, and there should be no password prompt.\n", "Q: Can't Load Windows 8 after removing Ubuntu Dual Boot I deleted Ubuntu and I can't load in windows 8 I get grub rescue.

How would I move the panel across monitors? I tried looking at the settings for the panel, but I can't move it across monitors. How can I acomplish this?\nOn a side note, what are some ways to snaz up Lubuntu and get a dark theme?\n\nA: If you right-click in the panel and select \"Panel Settings\", on the \"Geometry\" tab, there is a \"Monitor\" selection box. This allows you to choose which monitor the panel displays on, and also has an \"All\" option, which will stretch it across multiple displays. There doesn't appear to be a way (in this settings UI) to duplicate it on every display, but this covers most use cases.\n\nA: Extending the lxpanel across two monitors can be done easily,  See http://lxlinux.com/#14.  It has a step by step explanation of how to set up your two monitors and the lxpanel either on the bottom or the top of the screens. To establish dual monitors with LXDE, install Arandr from Synaptics. Arandr can set-up placement, orientation and resolution for each monitor. Before saving, set up the geometry of any horizontal panels. For a bottom panel across both monitors, align the bottoms of the displays as in the image on the right; for a top panel, align the tops. A second horizontal panel can be only set-up on the display whose unaligned edge is outermost, since any extension onto the smaller display will be hidden. Otherwise, the horizontal placement and geometry in general can be achieved in the usual way. For an lxpanel, right click an open spot on the panel and choose Panel Settings.\nWith regard to your second question, there are several themes that have a dark appearance.  Try them all.

See questions such as Problems starting plexmediaserver on Kubuntu 15.04 for starters.\nUse the systemd unit.\nYou don't say what list of instructions you are following in order to install SickRage on Ubuntu, but somewhere in those instructions it told you to run these commands as the superuser:\n\ncp sickrage/init.ubuntu /etc/init.d/sickrage\nchmod +x /etc/init.d/sickrage\nupdate-rc.d sickrage defaults\n\nThese instructions are wrong for Ubuntu version 15, which as you say uses systemd not upstart.  Fortunately, SickRage comes with a systemd service unit for systemd operating systems, whose installation instructions are\n\ncp sickrage/init.systemd /etc/systemd/system/sickrage.service\nsystemctl preset sickrage.service\n\nImprove upon the systemd unit that is supplied.\nFor what it's worth, I recommend editing that unit.\n\n\n*\n\n*The program's \"daemonization\" is not a correct implementation of the forking readiness protocol.  And what it does do is superfluous; one is already getting that for free from systemd's service management.  (And upstart's as a matter of fact.)\n\n*The \"quiet\" option gets rid of something that is actually useful under systemd.  It stops log output being sent to standard output.  But systemd will log all of the program's standard output, and make it available in the journal and in the output of commands such as systemctl status sickrage.service\n\n*The whole PID file nonsense is entirely superfluous.\n\n\nReally, this has not been tailored very well to systemd at all.  But then, neither has it been tailored well to much else.  The init.ubuntu supplied with SickRage for upstart-based Ubuntu isn't even an upstart job.  An upstart job has only existed for just over a month.  And the developers have been doing daft things like making the systemd unit file executable.

I think I have everything working except I am unable to stop mysql.service; the systemctl command just hangs and mysql just keeps on running. Has anyone else experienced this or might know what's going on?\n\nA: I had the same problem (upgrade to 15.04, using official files and config).\nI had to make the following changes to be able to stop the mysql daemon manually with sytemctl and automatically on system reboot/shutdown:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make /etc/mysql/debian.cnf readable for the mysql user with\nsudo chgrp mysql /etc/mysql/debian.cnf; sudo chmod 640 /etc/mysql/debian.cnf\n\n\n*Provide a slightly modified mysql.service file:\nsudo cp /lib/systemd/system/mysql.service /etc/systemd/system/\nsudo chmod 755 /etc/systemd/system/mysql.service\n\n\n*Provide an explicit stop command by opening the copied file in an editor:\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mysql.service\n\nand adding the following line under the [Service] section:\nExecStop=/usr/bin/mysqladmin --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf shutdown\n\nIn Nano, use Ctrl+O to save (Linux way!), Ctrl+X to exit.\n\n*Make the new service file known to system:\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\n\n\nA: I had the same problem with Ubuntu 15.10 Desktop and I found way to fix it:\nlog_error parameter in /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf was commented out. After uncommenting the parameter, systemd does mysqld shutdown without problems.\n\nA: Your problem is thread_pool_size. If it's much higher than the number of cores/threads, you'll not be able to shutdown properly unless by using mysqladmin shutdown command.\nEg.: You have 2 cores CPU with 4 threads. If you set it 1-4 - it will work fine. If you set it to 16, as advised in many 'high performance' blogs, it'll get pooched.\n\nA: I had a similar issue with mysql / mariadb failing to stop when instructed by systemd, either on shutdown or called manually with sudo service mysql stop.\nIn my case I am dual-booting Ubuntu / Windows in UEFI mode, and these OS interpret different hardware time, so both OSs sync against Internet time servers when they start up.\nMySQL (and Mariadb) was failing to stop if the hardware time changed while it are running.\nYou need to defer starting MySQL until after the timesync. Ideally this would be done by inserting a temporal dependency on mysql with After: time-sync but that didn't work for me. \nThe solution that worked for me (You can replace mysql with mariadb for the same effect):\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable mysql with\nsudo systemctl disabled mysql.service\n\n*Create a script (ensure it's executable) that will start mysql after some delay\n/usr/bin/delay_mysql with contents:\n#!/bin/sh\nsleep 30s\n/etc/init.d/mysql start\n\n\n*Create a systemd service to run your new script\n/etc/systemd/system/delay_mysql.service\nwith contents:\n[Unit]\nDescription=Delay start of MySQL / MariaDB\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nExecStart=/usr/bin/delay_mysql\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target  \n\n\n*Register your new service with sudo systemctl enable delay_mysql.service\nThis will cause your script to run at multi-user levels, which on Ubuntu are 3,4,5.\n\nA: Just when copying mysql.service you'll have to do a chmod after.\ncp /lib/systemd/system/mysql.service /etc/systemd/system/\nchmod 755 /etc/systemd/system/mysql.service\n\n\nA: in my case it was password mismatch for maintenance user debian-sys-maint between one in /etc/mysql/debian.cnf and one in MySQL database.\nThis user is used for MySQL shutdown and other functions. After MySQL update it might happened that there is a pass mismatch between file and database. \nThis could also happen if you move your database from one MySQL to another. If you will import all databases and users from other MySQL on different machine you need to re-sync your maintenance user ( debian-sys-maint ) password.\nYou need to do:\ncheck your current password in ubuntu/debian file:\nsudo cat /etc/mysql/debian.cnf\n\n# Automatically generated for Debian scripts. DO NOT TOUCH!\n[client]\nhost     = localhost\nuser     = debian-sys-maint\npassword = n4aSHUP04s1J32X5\nsocket   = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock\n[mysql_upgrade]\nuser     = debian-sys-maint\npassword = n4aSHUP04s1J32X5\nsocket   = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock\nbasedir  = /usr\n\nYou can see your password that system will use here: password = n4aSHUP04s1J32X5\nNext step is to update MySQL to same password:\nLog into MySQL:\n~$ mysql -u root -p\n\nType your password to access MySQL\nmysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'debian-sys-maint'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'n4aSHUP04s1J32X5';**\n\nAfter that no more issues with shutdown, no 10 min wait, no issues with installing apps that use this maintenance account like phpmyadmin.\nUPDATE: So unfortunately this did not solve the issue. It made it kind of random - sometimes I can stop the service without issue another time it will freeze on service stop.\n", "Q: upgrade from Ubuntu 12.04lts to Lubuntu 13.10 I want to upgrade from Ubuntu 12.04lts to Lubuntu 14.04lts----but understand that the preferred method is to advance one step at a time so lubuntu 13.10 would be the best option--- however my concern is unity desktop  since I understand it is not fully supported in Lubuntu----  \nPlease advise    Vince.F\n\nA: muru's comments are spot on.  Since you already have Ubuntu 12.04 which is a LTS version, upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04 which is a LTS version.  That is the easiest way.  Once that is accomplished you can change your distro to Lubuntu by adding LXDE which will make it Lubuntu.  You will still have all of the Ubuntu applications and the Lubuntu applications.  For instance LibreOffice Writer and Abiword.  You can uninstall all of the Ubuntu applications or just leave them installed.  There is no direct method to go directly from Ubuntu 12.04 to Lubuntu 14.04.  The only Lubuntu releases that have not reached their End Of Life are; 14.04 (LTS), 14.10, and the newly released 15.04.  You have one other option and that is to back up your data to an external source, which should be done anyway, and to do a fresh install.\n", "Q: How to remove index.php from each folder and subfolder?

However hacker placed index.php in each subdirectory. How can delete them? Can a script be used to recursively to delete index.php? Or is it better to apply backup?\n\nA: It would be better to use your backups, if you have them. If not, you can use find to delete the files:\nfind /path/to/site/folder -type f -iname 'index.php' -delete\n\nThis deletes regular files (-type f, so not directories) named index.php (ignoring case).\n", "Q: Log in into Ubuntu using a Windows machine like it was a new session Context\nI have two machines at home\n\n\n*\n\n*a laptop with Ubuntu Desktop 14.10 \n\n*a laptop with Windows 7 Professional\n\n\nThe thing is that I used to use the Ubuntu machine a lot, but some time ago I forgot the laptop on the dinning table and my son took it and drop it on the ground...  as you might have inferred correctly, the screen was destroyed.  The funny thing is that I connected the laptop to my TV, and it was working properly - no damages other than the LCD screen. \nAs of today, the Ubuntu laptop is mainly used to watch Netflix and YouTube in the living room. \nWhat I want to do\nI want to be able to connect to the Ubuntu machine using the Windows machine, but I don´t want to do it just by sharing the desktop screen...  Using vnc works ok, but I want to be able to login into the Ubuntu machine in a standalone session.  The reason for this is that I want to do some work like I would do it when using the Ubuntu machine, but without interferring with what the Ubuntu machine is currently doing.  \nFor example, if my family is watching a movie using the Ubuntu laptop, I want to be able to login using my own session (even a different user), a la NoMachine style, and do some work without affecting the current session in the TV.  I mention NoMachine because that is what I have used in the past (back in the day of Gnome 2) to achieve the same, but as Ubuntu uses Unity, NoMachine does not work at all. \nPS: I believe the name of this concept is desktop virtualization, but I couldn't find a tag like that in the tag selector. \nPS 2: I'd like to use Unity as well, that is, not having to install another desktop environment like xfce or gnome. \n\nA: You can use VNC Server to accomplish this.\nYou will want to run a Virtual Mode session on the laptop (either write an init.d file, or add a cron job for when powered on).\nConfigure this to use the LXDE or XFCE desktop environment (instructions here) and you can then connect using IP:1 from another machine with a viewer, and it will not interfere with the console session being shown on the TV.\n", "Q: How to make X.org listen tcp port to remote connections?

I recently bombed my Zorin OS 9 system by unsuccessfully installing kernel 4.0 so I decided to go back to Ubuntu - which I haven't used since 10.04 - and am stumbling across some issues. First is when I boot. ACPI PPC Probe failed. Starting version 219 NVIDIA. Evem after I ran the troubleshooting steps here ACPI PPC PROBE I still get the error after purging all nVidia drivers, though it does eventually boot using the noveau driver. But therein lies a second problem. The second issue is I can't get Steam to star. It won't launch at all from the GUI and when I try to open from terminal I get the following errors:\nlerner@ubuntu15:~$ steam\nRunning Steam on ubuntu 15.04 32-bit\nSTEAM_RUNTIME is enabled automatically\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1428965940)\nlibGL error: unable to load driver: nouveau_dri.so\nlibGL error: driver pointer missing\nlibGL error: failed to load driver: nouveau\nlibGL error: unable to load driver: swrast_dri.so\nlibGL error: failed to load driver: swrast\n\nI've tried the answer here and while it works there's a ton of artifacts on my system when I attempt to play a game.

Please note that if you're using a 64 bit version at the end of the wget command you'll want to change that to _amd64.deb\n$ wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.0-vivid/linux-headers-4.0.0-040000_4.0.0-040000.201504121935_all.deb\n\n$ wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.0-vivid/linux-headers-4.0.0-040000-generic_4.0.0-040000.201504121935_i386.deb\n\n$ wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.0-vivid/linux-image-4.0.0-040000-generic_4.0.0-040000.201504121935_i386.deb\n\nsudo dpkg -i linux-headers-4.0.0*.deb linux-image-4.0.0*.deb\n\nsudo reboot\n\nFrom there what you want to do (and be patient, it takes a bit for the first time to load after installing 4.0) is open another terminal and do the following. My preferred driver of choice that works best with my card is nVidia-346 but insert your version where I put my 346\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-346\nsudo reboot\n\nAgain, it may take a bit for it to start, but besides the strange Starting version 219 (which I think I read has to do with the systemd version, could be wrong) your Ubuntu system should boot without issue, as well as Steam starting.

What I would like to do is to connect to another monitor (same make and model). Since I already have a Dell dockstation, using it would be my preferred method. \nAccording to this answer to a very similar question, upgrading the kernel to 3.17 should work for me. The main difference from that question is that the OP's latop has an Intel HD Graphics 4600.\nAfter upgrading and rebooting, I tried to do a dry-run by connecting a single monitor to the dockstation. Sadly, the external monitor was not recognized either connecting via VGA or DVI, which leads to assume that connecting two monitors, one via dock station and one via VGA to mini DP, will not work.  \nI am doing something wrong here? How could I connect 2 external monitor to my computer?\n\nA: I assume, you connect the dockingstation to the laptop via USB, right?\nThen the used technology would be DisplayLink which is unfortunately not supported on Linux (or just experimental on ArchLinux). As far as I know there are just driver for Windows and Mac OS.\nI stumbled accross the same problem when trying to use this Dell USB 3.0 Adapter. What you can do to connect multiple monitors, according to the links you already posted, is to use MST/DaisyChaining. Therefore you need a monitor with an Displayport output. \nBut check the specs of your graphics card if it supports MST before.\n\nA: Use a Port Replicator.\nI use Ubuntu 15.04 on Toshiba Z30 Ultrabook with Toshiba Hi-speed port replicator (slightly different to docking station but similar functionality) to connect to two external monitors (one with via VGA and HDMI on port replicator) and everything works fine :)\nIt supports hot Docking/undocking out of the box and three displays (including laptop in-build one) works smoothly. \nFYI, I tried to use Targus docking station with this laptop initially but no luck. I think docking stations have propitiatory connectors and stuff, hence less support for Linux.\n\nA: Update 04.12.2016\nUsing Ubuntu 16.04 with the latest DisplayLinkDrivers and the issues are now gone. Two external monitors are now possible without much fuss in my set-up.\nI am now in a position to answer this: \n- DisplayLink is now supported for Linux which makes thinks much easier.\nCurrent working* set-up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04\n\n*Linux kernel 3.19.0-43\n\n*DisplayLink drivers v1.0.335\n\n*Dell USB 3.0-Dockingstation D3100​\n\n*2 external monitors Dell UltraSharp U2412M\n\n*No changes where made to the \n\n\nOne monitor is connected directly to the laptop with a mini Display port to VGA adaptor; the other to the docking station via a DVI cable. Each external monitor plus the laptop monitor works independently.\n*Issues:\n- mouse pointer flickering in the laptop and one of the external monitors. Not too disturbing most of the time but it gets annoying sometimes.\n- Sometimes when connecting the end monitor (DVI, from dock) is not recognized. Disconnecting both monitors and attaching in the order DVI -> DP, will solve the issue.\n- Newer kernels (and updates to 3.19) appear to make the flickering issue much worst, to the point where the pointer disappears in those monitors.      \nIf someone comes up with a solution for the flickering I will accept that answer instead.\n", "Q: Is Nautilus same as Files on 14.04? 14.04 fully updated on notebook and desktop.  But Nautilus on notebook and Files on desktop.  Why and can I install same on both?\nUnity on both.  Files on desktop does not show free space as Nautilus does on note book.  And Files still sometime greys out copy etc options, as in previously reported bugs, for no apparent reason.\n\nA: Unless you've changed the default file manager in your Ubuntu:\nFiles or File Manager are terms that are more easily understood by new users then the actual package name of nautilus.\nFor that you find this new naming but in deed they are both same.\nFiles is nautilus.\nTo get sure of what I'm talking about open your terminal and run the command nautilus from your desktop Pc. You'll notice that Files will open which means they are same.\nYou can think of Files as an alias for nautilus\n", "Q: Mail-server how-to What I need is a basic mail server, I'm going to send e-mail from internal systems to it and then fetch the e-mail externally(gmail). \nI have installed Ubuntu 15.04 server and mail-server component that comes with the installation.

Is this the default text editor I am using?\nWhen I open text files, It opens with gedit\nWhat command in terminal must be specified to get the default text editor that I am using, and have it returned to e in terminal?\n\nA: First of all you should notice that there are two types of text editors..\n\n\n*\n\n*The command line editors such as vim, nano, emacs, etc..\n\n*GUI text editors such as gedit, kate, ...\n\n\nThe default text editor when using the GUI is not the same as the command line text editors so when you are opening a file using GUI you probably are using the GUI text editors which is gedit by default.

Let's say that since I did that, last Friday, I didn't notice major drawbacks (except for some strange lock-screen issue) until today. \nYesterday evening I forgot to shut down the computer and today after I logged in I started to see some strange increased CPU usage. There was a /usr/lib/apt/methods/http process that took 100% of the CPU constantly. Seeing this, I thought doing a software update (graphically) would terminate the process, but instead I got a message like apt-get cannot exit, or something like that. I thought perhaps some other process locked apt, so I tried to unlock it by removing the lock files /var/lib/apt/lists/lock and /var/cache/apt/archives/lock but nothing changed, the process was still running. \nThen I thought perhaps a reboot will fix the issue, so I rebooted the computer. After the reboot the /usr/lib/apt/methods/http process was indeed gone, so I tried updating the software sources manually to see what was going on. When I ran apt-get update I noticed that at the end the update is stuck with a line such as 100% [15 Packages 25.6 GB/25.6 GB 100%], where the total amount of data (the size in GB) is increasing, it does not stop. I had to interrupt the command because I didn't know what it was doing.\nWhat should be the problem ? How can I fix this ?\n\nA: I had the same issue. It seems as there are some problems with the repositories for universe and multiverse. After I removed all of these sources the update runs again without any issue.\nGreetings  \n", "Q: What does ubuntu install dvd/cd do?

You can use it to check on multiple scripts or processes in one step.\n\nAfter the time limit has passed and sent its message, the script terminates\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as proc_check.py in a permanent :) location.\n\n*In the head of the script, set the list of processes (script names) to keep an eye on, and set the time limit.\n\n*Make sure the processes (to check) are not running, and test-run the script with the command:\npython3 /path/to/proc_check.py\n\nIt should send a warning after the time limit has passed.\n\n*If all works fine, add the command below to your Startup Applications:\npython3 /path/to/proc_check.py\n\nNote:\nIf you have notify-send available (sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin), you can also uncomment the before-last line, to get a confirmation if all went well: \n\nThe advantage of that is that you will either get a notification that all went well, or a warning, mentioning which of the processes did not start up successfully. \nYou will notice then if you accidentally moved this script. :)\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport getpass\nimport time\n\n#--- set the processes (script names) to check below\nprocs = [\"pscript_2.py\", \"monkey.py\"]\n#--- set the time limit below (seconds)\nwait = 30\n#---\n\n# define the user to fetch the current user's process list\nuser = getpass.getuser()\n# create an (empty) list of succesful process startups\nsucceeded = []\n\ndef get():\n    return subprocess.check_output([\"ps\", \"-u\", user, \"ww\"]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\nt = 1\nwhile t < wait:\n    # add succesful processes to the \"succeeded\" list\n    for p in [proc for proc in procs if proc in get()]:\n        succeeded.append(p)\n    time.sleep(1)\n    t = t+1\n\n# list the failures\nfails = [p for p in procs if not succeeded.count(p) > 2]\n# if there are any, send a message\nif len(fails) > 0:\n    subprocess.Popen([\"zenity\", \"--info\", \"--text\", \"failed to run: \"+(\", \").join(fails)])\n# if all was successfull, send a message; n.b. comment out the line if notify-send is not available\nelse:\n    # subprocess.Popen([\"notify-send\", \"All processes started succesfully\"])\n    pass\n\n\nA: It is assumed that your startup programs are in /home/<your_username>/.config/autostart/.\nAnd than something like this in your crontab:\nawk -F'[= ]' '/^Exec/{print $2}' /home/<your_username>/.config/autostart/*.desktop | while IFS= read -r target; do [ ! -x \"${target/\\~/$HOME}\" ] &&  ! type \"${target/\\~/$HOME}\" &> /dev/null  && echo \"Not executable: $target\" | mail -s \"Missing commands\" <your_username>; done\n\nOpen your crontab with:\ncrontab -e\n\nand add this line:\n* */2 * * *       awk -F'[= ]' '/^Exec/{print $2}' /home/<your_username>/.config/autostart/*.desktop | while IFS= read -r target; do [ ! -x \"$target\" ] &&  ! type \"$target\" &> /dev/null  && echo \"Not executable: $target\" | mail -s \"Missing commands\" <your_username>; done\n\nThis will check your files in .config/autostart/ every two hours and send a mail, if there is a problem.\nThanks @terdon\n", "Q: Fail2ban fails to start after update? I have been using fail2ban for a while on my Ubuntu server.

This didn't used to happen in Thunar on Xubuntu.\n\nA: It is normal behaviour. Well sort of. Be careful with regards to NTFS. Those partitions  tend to be mounted as executable making all files ... executable. \nThis one-liner will remove execute from .txt from the directory you execute it: \nfind . -type f -iname \"*.txt\" -exec chmod -x {} \\;\n\nWhen a text file has executable permissions set or is recognized as executable generally it will ask for it to be executed or to be viewed. \nNautilus also has a setting for this in \"Edit\" \"preferences\" \"Behavior\".

Also happens at least five times while it initializes the desktop session (after login screen).\nRelevant system specifications:\n$ inxi -G\nGraphics:  Card: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD/ATI] RV535 [Radeon X1650 PRO]\n           Display Server: X.Org 1.17.1 drivers: ati,radeon (unloaded: fbdev,vesa)\n           Resolution: 1280x1024@85.0hz\n           GLX Renderer: Gallium 0.4 on ATI RV530 GLX Version: 2.1 Mesa 10.5.2\n\non a Belinea 10 60 75 CRT-monitor.\nWhen this happens, there are no messages appearing in the dmesg output.\nAnybody knows what the reason could be and how to fix it?\nDo you need more detailed information or command outputs?\n\nUpdate:\nTrying different resolutions I found out that the monitor's native resolution (1600x1200, 75Hz) does not change the problematic behavior at all, while switching to the lower 1024x786, 75Hz, the screen still goes black for a second in the same situations as before, but there are no two clicking sounds any more as if the resolution was going to change. Just a short time of black.

Ubuntu 14.04 For a number of years I have happily used Ubuntu. However, I am having all sorts of problems now since I upgraded my video card and monitor. My monitor is a Benq 4k monitor, but I decided to upgrade my video card to a AMD R9 270. \nI have installed the latest drivers from AMD, fglrx. This is when my problems started as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can no longer play flash in firefox, the Adobe Flash plugin keeps crashing.\n\n*Playing Youtube videos at full screen is like watching a slideshow, really slow, it seems like there is no hardware acceleration. Flash or HTML5 both are slow.\n\n*I tried switching to Chrome as a workaround for the flash issue, which worked fine at the start, but now Chrome is unusable as all it does its keep flickering on my desktop when I start it up.\n\n\nIs this all fixable? Or is a combination of 4k, AMD etc unusable on Ubuntu?\n\nA: I ended up upgrading and re-installing Ubuntu 14.10. As soon as I did this the video acceleration in YouTube and Flash worked a treat. I have now upgraded further to 15.04, and this version also works well for video playback on 4K.\nMy recommendation based on my experience is that you should install the AMD Proprietary drivers as doing this caused me all sorts of problems.

Instead:\nsudo apt-get install open-vm-tools-desktop\nThe -desktop part is important!

Let's say I have a large e-mail thread. This e-mail thread is mostly ok, but a key e-mail is missing from the thread because someone didn't reply appropriately at one point. Is there an easy way for me to add this missing e-mail to the thread when I reply, maintaining the appropriate indentation appearance? If yes, how?\n\nA: Well, in principle you can. In practice however, don't try it. For this to work, you would need to edit the corresponding .msf file. This is an index to the emails, which themselves are all stored in a single file with no structure. The index keeps track of which mails have been viewed, which are replies to other mails, etc. Your thread structure is contained in it. However, the .msf file (mail folder summary) has the Mork database format, which is very, very hard to parse, let alone edit, for humans.\n", "Q: Installed ubuntu 14.04 and grub is not showing windows 7 tried grub update and boot-repair but none working.\nthis is the link which boot repair gave me\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/10923998/\n\nA: Windows only boots from primary NTFS partitions with the boot flag. Since your install is in sda6 a logical partition, you cannot repair it directly to be bootable. You have to have a primary partition with bootmgr & BCD (and other files not normally shown in Summary repport).\nYou need to convert sda2 back to NTFS. It also shows some old DOS type boot files, so you must have converted it. But it has your bootmgr & BCD and boot flag, so it must have been your NTFS boot partition.\nYou may be able to use Disks or Disk Utility to just convert to NTFS or 07 type, but then may need to restore backup PBR or partition boot sector using testdisk. If you reformat be sure to first backup bootmgr, BCD & other Windows boot files. \nBest to have a Windows repairCD or flash drive as then you can run those repairs.\nAnd best to have Windows on primary partitions and Linux on the logical partitions. Linux does not care, but Windows really only likes primary NTFS partitions. \n", "Q: Connect button grayed out in 802.1x authentication dialog Since I upgraded to 15.04 I can't connect to our office wired network anymore since I can't press connect in the authentication dialog.\n\n\nA: Came across this issue as well on 15.04.

Note you also have to adapt to IPv4 and IPv6.\n\nIPv4\nFirst, examine your iptables rules (iptables -L -n).  Assuming a default installation, then you'll have no rules.\niptables -A INPUT -s SOURCEIP/CIDR -p tcp --dport PORTNUM -j ACCEPT is the general syntax to add a rule to the end of the INPUT table, specifically stating that \"I want to permit the source IP adddress (and range of IPs, if a CIDR suffix is provided - it's not necessary) access to my server when requests come to port PORTNUM via TCP\".  If you want to only permit one IP address, then omit the /CIDR part with SOURCEIP.\nIf you have any rules in the INPUT table to deny access (at the end) you will need to use iptables -I INPUT RULENUMBER (where RULENUMBER is the line number in the INPUT table where you want to insert this rule).\nMake sure, however, that you also add rules such as these:\niptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT - Accept anything over the localhost loopback (127.0.0.1, etc.)\niptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT - Accept traffic related to already established connections (required to make sure communication back to your server and your remote client works)\nAfter that configuration is done, you now need to add a rule to deny all other connections.  Such a rule would be this, added to the end of the INPUT table:\niptables -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-unreachable.\n\nIPv6\nFirst, examine your ip6tables rules (ip6tables -L -n).  Assuming a default installation, then you'll have no rules.\nip6tables -A INPUT -s SOURCEIP/CIDR -p tcp --dport PORTNUM -j ACCEPT is the general syntax to add a rule to the end of the INPUT table, specifically stating that \"I want to permit the source IP adddress (and range of IPs, if a CIDR suffix is provided - it's not necessary) access to my server when requests come to port PORTNUM via TCP\".  If you want to only permit one IP address, then omit the /CIDR part with SOURCEIP.\nIf you have any rules in the INPUT table to deny access (at the end) you will need to use ip6tables -I INPUT RULENUMBER (where RULENUMBER is the line number in the INPUT table where you want to insert this rule).\nMake sure, however, that you also add rules such as these:\nip6tables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT - Accept anything over the localhost loopback (127.0.0.1, etc.)\nip6tables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT - Accept traffic related to already established connections (required to make sure communication back to your server and your remote client works)\nAdditionally with IPv6, you need to actually accept pretty much every ICMPv6 packet as it's far more required than in IPv4.  This would achieve that:\nip6tables -A INPUT -p ipv6-icmp -j ACCPET\nAfter that configuration is done, you now need to add a rule to deny all other connections.  Such a rule would be this, added to the end of the INPUT table:\nip6tables -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp6-addr-unreachable.\n\nMake these rules persistent (`iptables` only solutions need this)\nTime to make the rules stick persistently.  Lets install iptables-persistent.   apt-get install iptables-persistent.\nThe installation will ask if you want to save your current rules.  Tell it \"yes\" for both IPv4 and IPv6 prompts.  The ruleset we just 'added' to or created will now be persistently available.\n(If you use ufw instead of iptables, you will not need to install this package)\n\nWhile ufw will automatically manage the ruleset to make sure it's in the right order, iptables is the 'sysadmin' way of doing advanced firewalling.  UFW just does easy rules and functions - complex ones you have to do with iptables or add manually to the configuration files for ufw with iptables syntax.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install LXD directly on a Ubuntu Snappy Core?

I use dual booting and in one drive Windows 7 is installed and in another drive Ubuntu 14.04 LTS is installed. My first O/S was windows 7. There was few drives like Workshop, Movies, Soft etc. Now I was about to change drives in terminal to access files stored in different drives. After spending couple of hours I discovered a way to access different files in different drives. What I did is first of all I mounted lets say /dev/sda2 drive in /media/username folder using this command....\n\n$ sudo mount /dev/sda2/ media/username\n\nOnce mounted then I can easily change directories by using cd command.\nNow my questions are...\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this really a correct way to change drives to access files?\n\n*I can go forward like $cd /media/username but how to go backward?\nI mean go back to root or go back to media? In windows CMD I am\nusing cd.. to go one folder back. Is there any similar command for\nterminal?\n\n*What is the difference between drive and partition?\n\n*How to unmount a drive or any file?\n\n*My last question is as far as I know in Linux files are arranged\nunder root / directory. If so then it might don't respect windows\ndrive systems. If so then all files should be accessed without\nmounting any drive to /media/username folder?\n\n\nA: First, note there is a typo in mount your command. It should be:\n$ sudo mount /dev/sda2 /media/username\n\nHere /dev/sda2 is the device (in this case, a hard drive's partition) you want to access, and /media/username is your mountpoint, i.e., the location in the filesystem where you want to mount the device.\nTo answer your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, using cd is the normal way to change directories. And mount is perfectly fine to mount devices that are not already mounted. If you mount it often, you may want to make an entry in /etc/fstab so that in the future you can mount a particular device to a particular mountpoint with self-defined options, e.g., by simply writing mount /media/username. You may even want to consider mounting it automatically, at boot time. There is a lot of excellent documentation on the subject. Just search for fstab.\n\n*I guess you want to do a bit of reading about the Linux filesystem. There's also good documentation for this, see, e.g., here for a short overview. / is the root folder in which everything is contained, organized in various subfolders. Here's a few hints concerning cd:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd (without arguments) will get you to your home folder, typically /home/username\n\n*cd - will get you to the previous folder (where you were before you changed to the current folder)\n\n*cd .. will get you to the parent folder (one level up). This is equivalent to cd.. in Windows CMD.\n\n*cd / will get you to the root folder, though I personally rarely need that.\n\n\n*A (hard) drive is actually a disk that you can store data on. It is usually divided into several partitions. Perhaps confusingly, in the Windows world these partitions are also called drives. This is not the case in the Linux world, though. We simply  call them partitions, or perhaps \"devices\" in a technical context.\n\n*To unmount a mounted device, use the command sudo umount <MOUNTPOINT>, e.g., in your example,\nsudo umount /media/username\n\n...where /media/username is a mounted partition (you could also use sudo umount /dev/sda2, though this is perhaps less intuitive). Simply write mount (without arguments) to see a list of all currently mounted devices with their mountpoints.\n\n*In Linux, you have to mount each of your Windows \"drives\" on a separate mountpoint. You are completely free to choose where, and you already know how to do it, as you showed with your mount command. :)\n", "Q: Removed lots of files on /boot but still the availble space is 0 I need to install some applications on my ubuntu, but apparently my /boot partition is full.\nrunning apt-get -f install\n\nUnpacking linux-image-3.13.0-49-generic (3.13.0-49.83) ... dpkg: error\n  processing archive\n  /var/cache/apt/archives/linux-image-3.13.0-49-generic_3.13.0-49.83_amd64.deb\n  (--unpack):\ncannot copy extracted data for './boot/abi-3.13.0-49-generic' to\n  '/boot/abi-3.13.0-49-generic.dpkg-new': failed to write (No space left\n  on device)\n\nI just removed lots of old kernels from boot folder.

Since the events reporting is very sluggish after this method, I won't explain it here.\n\n\nA forward solution should recognize the multi-touch functionality of the >Logitech T650 touchpad and then generate appropriate events for gestures.\n\nI am experiencing the same issues as you, I've also noticed that the right click button doesn't seem to do anything either,over all the touchpad is barely usable on my system, installing\n\ngpointing-device-settings\n\nseems to give more options for tweaking the touchpad, but doesn't restore the functions that no longer work, and in all honesty for me it didn't improve the performance of the touchpad.\nEdit :\nSince writing this I have been doing some experimenting, and I have found at least for me a way to get 3 fingered swiping, I basically use it for browser navigation, but with more tweaking it might be possible to get a lot more of the touchpads functions working.\nAfter searching I came across this - multitouch gestures it's taken a bit of messing about with, but that's more my lack of knowledge than anything else, I did have some issues when running some of the commands (specifically the make commands) turns out this might be down to glibc, but I found that using this source solved the make issues clone from here if having make issues\nI still have some issues with the touchpad, but this seems to be a step in the right direction, hope it helps.\nEdit : I'm currently running ubuntu 16.04 and have up until recently not had much luck getting this touch pad to work in a useful way, but the other day I came across libinput-gestures - https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures\nI found it easy to set up and works well, some putting it here as people may find it useful.\n", "Q: useradd doesn't allow the user to log on On an Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS the following command:\nadduser fu\n\nand then entering a password bar and just pressing Enter on all other questions, creates a user that allows me to log on and has the following characteristics in /etc/passwd:\nfu:x:1002:1002:,,,:/home/fu:/bin/bash\n\nHowever, doing a:\nuseradd fu --password bar --groups adm,cdrom,sudo,dip,plugdev,lpadmin --shell /bin/bash --create-home\n\ncreates in /etc/passwd\nfu:x:1002:1002::/home/fu:/bin/bash\n\nand does not allow me to log on and adding --user-group does not help neither...\nAs I need useradd (for a docker script) how do I proceed?\nP.S. I've had a look at /usr/sbin/adduser already, but as it's perl it's not obvious to me which parameters to add to adduser to have the same functionality as useradd\n\nA: This might not be working because your password bar is not encrypted. The man page for useradd states:\n\nThe encrypted password, as returned by crypt(3).\n\nThis question on Stack Overflow has a few answers which might help you with your script, as the question asks about adding a user along with a password.\nAs the accepted answer was not updated on that question based on user comments, I will reproduce the solution here:\necho -e \"bar\\nbar\\n\" | passwd fu\n\nThat command will change the password for a user fu to bar. The user needs to have been created using useradd, of course.\nAnother solution would be to use chpasswd, as the second highest voted answer suggests:\necho fu:bar | chpasswd\n\nI have tested both of these solutions, and they both work.\nEdited to remove adduser info and indicate which suggestions from linked question actually work.\n\nA: Problem #1:\nThe commas in the user entry in /etc/passwd are just field separators for user's informations such as \"Full Name\", \"Room Number\", \"Work Phone\" and \"Home Phone\", so I guess that omitting them is the same as having them with blank fields;\nProblem #2:\nFrom the Trusty man page for useradd:\n\n[...]\n       -p, --password PASSWORD\n           The encrypted password, as returned by crypt(3).

I once had a problem with maven that the proxy replaced a jar by a html page containing a virus warning. The html got saved as .jar but because it was broken nothing worked anymore.\nAnyway: it's safe to delete everything from the directory /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/ (and also from /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/).\nFor troubleshooting, I recommend the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try another mirror, eg. http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ instead of http://ch.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ or even the main archive http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/\n\n*Try another protocol: ftp:// instead of http:// - the rest of the path remains for default mirrors\n\n*Try to analyze the transfer using wireshark (use the context menu option 'Follow TCP stream'). Interesting are both HTTP headers and content. If you get answers with HTTP status code 200 (which means ok) but human-readable content, something is seriously wrong on your proxy. A regular bzip2 file shouldn't contain any human-readable text.\n\n*Use wget or curl for checking what you get from the server when downloading without apt-get.\n\n", "Q: How to disable \"Remember forever\" option in mounting encrypted disks Whenever you mount an LUKS encrypted disk, Ubuntu gives you 3 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Forget immediately\n\n*Remember for this session\n\n*Remember forever\n\n\nI wanted to know how to reset this choice after choosing the \"Remember forever\" one, and make the window appear again.\n\nA: I was looking for a similar information and came across this question of yours. Actually I was trying to understand how was this \"remembered password\" stored, and if it was safely stored.\nThen I stumbled into @Gilles answer to a similar question in Stack Exchange.\nBased on that answer, you can go to \"Show applications\" -> \"Passwords and keys\". Your stored password should be found under \"Login\", and can be deleted.\n\n\nUnder the default configuration in Ubuntu, passwords are stored in the\n  GNOME keyring. This\n  applies to all passwords stored by Nautilus, as well as most other\n  applications including web browsers.\n(Let me reiterate: default configuration, most. This can be\n  changed and there are applications that don't support the Gnome\n  keyring.)\nYou can use the Seahorse GUI\n  program or the\n  secret-tool\n  command line utility to view and modify the contents of the keyring. \nThere is some official documentation about Gnome\n  Keyring, including a\n  “security\n  philosophy”\n  and a more concrete security\n  architecture.\nData in memory (“Remember password until you logout”) is present in\n  the memory of the gnome-keyring-daemon process, which allows any\n  process running as your user to query it. Gnome-keyring avoids\n  swapping if\n  possible; however, if you have any encrypted storage, you should have\n  encrypted swap, because the programs that manipulate the confidential\n  data could themselves be swapped out.\nData on disk (“Remember forever”) is stored in the file\n  ~/.gnome2/keyrings/login.keyring. It is\n  encrypted\n  with a key that's derived from a password; normally, that's your login\n  password, and Ubuntu is set up to unlock the keyring with your login\n  password. The key\n  is derived from the password with a salted, slow\n  hash\n  but I don't know exactly what the derivation function is.\n\n\nA: A few more 18.10 tips in addition to gusbrs answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*if the password list is empty, try going into:\n\n\n*\n\n*Menu\n\n*View\n\n*Show Any\n\n\n*LUKS passwords show as: \"Encryption Passphrase for <disk name>\"\n", "Q: Where is input source in ubuntu gnome 15.04 I want to set my input source to ibus-unikey(i installed it and set my input to ibus) but can't find it anywhere in setting.\nIn 14.10 there are a input source tab in Region and Language but now it isn't.\nI opened the language section but there is nothing in it.\nIs there any way to open ibus please help me.\n\n\nA: Install the Gnome Tweak Tool:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nSelect Keyboard and Mouse and switch Show all input sources on.\n\n\nA: After having installed ibus-unikey, you probably need to log out and log in again.

That can be changed via the DirectoryIndex directive in etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf. However, to be consistent with how most people do it, you should rename fotoboek.html to index.html.

I enabled nested virtualization and managed them via virsh. For the networking to work I had to enable so called promiscuous mode on the ESXi portgroup and hence turned it into a hub (it's a shame that vSwitch does not support MAC learning). \nAs the virtual switch was connected using two NICs to uplink switches, promiscuous mode somehow caused the packets to be duplicated (despite the fact that all the communication was happening within single ESXi host!). The Linux bridge detected those duplicates and hence refused to bridge the packets. \nRemoving one physical NIC from the vmware switch solved the problem (disabling one NIC or setting as Standby or Unused did not). As removing NIC from switch was not a good solution for me I created a virtual switch without any NICs attached and created a Linux box that routed traffic to it. After that the installation went without any further issues.\nI was not able to resolve it purely on the Linux bridge level.\n", "Q: PHP.ini change not reflected I am trying to install Zabbix and the following errors appeared during pre-installation \n\nI proceeded to change the setting in PHP.ini file to the minimum requirements\n\n\nThe problem is that though i have made the changes to the PHP.ini file , it is not being reflected and I am still getting the error.

You need to add the \"actual\" entries, for example\ndate.timezone = \"Asia/Tokyo\"\n\ninstead of\n;date.timezone = \"Asia/Tokyo\"\n\nI'd recommend to add your entries instead of editing the existing, out-commented entries. So you can go back to the default just by deleting your own additions.\nAdditionally, there may be multiple php.ini files. You need to check which one is used. It mostly depends on the method you chose to integrate PHP with your webserver (probably Apache http server). If you're using the mod_php module, you need to look for php.ini in a subdirectory \"apache2\".

The installer does everything on it's own.\nThe more interesting question is: Why are you running this kernel on 15.04? It's only kept as a backup for certain events and this is not one of it. Also it's not the kernel that GRUB runs by default.\nYour problem here is that you run an unnecessary command which you do not understand (it installs headers for the currently running kernel) in a context where it's not supposed to be run and you interpret the message as a \"computer error\" without checking what you could have done wrong. It's not the machine that looks like it does anything wrong or stupid here from my perspective.

I reported a bug but nothing changed.\n\nA: Ubuntu has a program called Apport that is responsible for detecting such crashes and upon user consent, report these crashes to developers. This process intends to get the problem fixed by the developers.\nHowever it can be very annoying to common users, and there is no point in showing errors to users when they cannot do anything about it themselves. So you might want to disable them.\nThe apport system creates crash report files in the /var/crash directory. These crash report files cause the error message to appear everytime Ubuntu boots.\nTurn off apport\n$ gksudo gedit /etc/default/apport\n\nJust set the value of enabled to 0, and this will disable apport.\nenabled=0\n\nSave the file and close it. From the next boot onwards, there should be no error messages ever. If you do not want to restart the system then restart apport from the command line.\n$ sudo service apport restart\n\n\nA: (Writing a new answer, because I can not comment yet.)\nAdding to @Vlad Savitsky's answer:\nApport's task is to report crashes to the Ubuntu developers. As such it is benign and should not be simply turned off.\nApport is supposed to show you every problem only once. The issue seems to be that apport itself can become confused and fails to record that it already reported a problem, or forgets that it did. This can lead to whole series of dialogs, which is annoying. This might happen when upgrading the system.\nOne solution is to delete all crash reports in the /var/crash directory. This command can do that for you:\nsudo rm /var/crash/*\n\nOf course, if new crashes occur, apport will notify you about those, which it should.\nIf apport continues to be annoying, turning it off entirely is a different solution. As Vlad described, you need to\nsudo ${EDITOR-gedit} /etc/default/apport\n\nand set enabled=0. To activate that change, on 16.04 and above, a different syntax than just restart is needed to restart apport. 16.04 uses systemd to manage services, so that the systemctl command can be used:\nsudo systemctl restart apport\n\n", "Q: How can I capture shell variable output to use in my capistrano task I am using capistrano to deploy a Ruby on Rails application. I previously was using Centos. In converting my task to be used with Ubuntu, I have a task that I was using for Centos was:\n capture(\"env | grep ENV_VAR\").split(\"=\").last\n\nThis would capture the output of that variable on the remote system to be used in my code. However this code doesn't seem to work with Ubuntu. Can anyone tell me how I can capture the output of a variable using capistrano and ubuntu?\nI have tried\ncapture(\"echo $ENV_VAR\")\n\nBut that prints out an empty string. I am assuming the issue is reated to \"$\" but I am not sure.\nThanks for any help in advance.\n\nA: Use printenv instead, which does not require a shell:\ncapture('printenv ENV_VAR')\nReplace ENV_VAR with the name of the environment variable you want. Do not prepend $.\nAlthough printenv is not POSIX, GNU/Linux systems like Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS support it because GNU Coreutils provides it, and it works on many other *nix systems, like FreeBSD. The reason you need to use printenv instead of env is that printenv ENV_VAR outputs the value of ENV_VAR, while env ENV_VAR tries to run a command called ENV_VAR, which is not what you want.\n\nThe rest of this post covers other methods, their limitations, and how they can be improved. This is optional reading, since printenv is simple and solves the problem fully.\nYour original method, capture(\"env | grep ENV_VAR\").split(\"=\").last, should not be used even on a system where it does appear to work, because it is unreliable. It greps for the variable name everywhere in the VAR=val line, and thus will return results for variables whose names--or even values--contain the name of the desired variable. Using ^ENV_VAR= instead of ENV_VAR fixes this problem by matching the name only when it appears at the beginning of the line (^) and requiring a = character to appear right after it. However, it is possible for the value of an environment variable to contain an = character, and since you call split and last, you are actually getting the longest trailing substring of the value that contains no =. Even if you fixed that, the method is still needlessly complex when all you need is printenv.\nThe solution you found, capture(\"/bin/sh -c 'echo $ENV_VAR'\"), will work most of the time, but will return an incorrect value when the variable (a) contains whitespace other than single space characters surrounded by non-whitespace, or (b) contains globbing characters like *, ?, and [ if they happen to match any filenames. The problem is that, in the shell command echo $ENV_VAR, the parameter expansion $ENV_VAR is not quoted, so word splitting and globbing are performed. echo reinserts whitespace but not always in the same way: echo foo bar prints foo bar, but so does echo foo   bar. This problem can be solved by placing \" \" quotes around the expansion, though you will have to either escape them so the Ruby interpreter doesn't take them as ending the \"-quoted string and starting a new one, or you can '-quote the Ruby string and escape any internal ' characters.\nYou also get a wrong result in the less common situation that the value of ENV_VAR begins with an option that echo supports. Different echo implementations support different options; -n and -e are common. Most shells have echo as a builtin and may support different options from other shells and from /bin/echo. This is to say that echo is not very portable. It's reasonable for inspecting environment variables interactively, when you'll probably realize if something odd is happening, but less so for scripting. echo's portability woes are exacerbated by how /bin/sh is not always bash. In Ubuntu it is dash. This can be avoided by using printf '%s\\n' or printf \"%s\\n\" instead of echo (or, in your case, printf %s might suffice).\nThus your solution can be improved to capture('/bin/sh -c \\'printf \"%s\\n\" \"$ENV_VAR\"\\''). This may look wrong to experienced shell scripters who do not know Ruby; note that Ruby, unlike Bash and other Bourne-style shells, treats \\' as a literal ' inside a ' '-quoted string. Even though it's correct, your colleagues will have to look at it twice to satisfy themselves of that, even if they are proficient in both Ruby and shell scripting. capture('printenv ENV_VAR') is simpler.\n\nA: I finally stumbled across this answer. The way to do this is to load the bash shell and pass  the command to it.\ncapture(\"/bin/sh -c 'echo $ENV_VAR'\")\n\n", "Q: Missing icons from system settings KDE 15.04 i have a missing icons from the Kubuntu System Settings panel, installed from kubuntu-ppa/backports in ubuntu 15.04 with kubuntu-desktop\nany ideas?\n\nA: I have the same problem, I not use ppa from kubuntu but I use UbuntuStudio 15.04 and have the same problem, I only can make appear one icon, installing this package(the package systemsettings must be installed):\nkde-config-gtk-style\nsee this picture (the other icons are missing):\n\nNote: You can open from terminal with: \nsystemsettings5\nI do not find the way to make appear the other icons, I need to configure the search option in dolphin file manager that not working because I use dolphin under UbuntuStudio 15.04, and I use kdenlive that have fonts very small, see:\n \nAt the momento I found a solution for the fonts on dolphin that is install this package:\nqt4-qtconf\nsee this picture:\n\nThis run from terminal with:\nqtconfig-qt4\nor from system config UbuntuStudio\n\nOnly I don't understant why not working on kdenlive, there must be some missing package to install that I don't know what is (on UbntuStudio 14.04 this problem there is no)\n", "Q: apt-mirror: can't create /dir:/mirror directory at /usr/bin/apt-mirror line 342 The title of this question is the error message I receive after installing apt-mirror and apache2.

I tried different printing protocols including AppSocket, LPD and IPP but this does not seem to make a difference. \nIs there a way to avoid disconnecting from my separate wired network simply to print? Can I specify a network adapter or path for this printer somehow?\n\nA: It seems to me that Ubuntu favours the ethernet connection when resolving the address. \nThis means that when you try to reach 10.23.161.x, you get the 'outside' connection; your traffic is blocked by 10.23.161.x's router firewall.\nIf you can use the printer's internal (private) address through the wireless network, you could try the solution from \nhttps://superuser.com/questions/216678/ubuntu-network-priority/217510#217510 :\nRight click the network icon -> Edit connections -> wlan0 [or whatever your wireless interface is called] -> ipv4 Settings -> Routes...\nTick the box with \"Use this connection only for resources on its network\"\nAfter 'OK'-ing and 'Apply'-ing your way through all opened dialog boxes, you should be able to print while being connected to the wired network.\n(Except perhaps if both the wired and wireless network use the same private network space (e.g. both use 192.168.002.xxx).

Basically this should be an outgoing-only SMTP server. \nThe problem arises when I need to use the SMTP server as user1@sampledomain.xxx to user2@sampledomain.xxx because Postfix thinks that mail should be relayed internally, but it doesn't find the address in the virtual domain's mailboxes and thus fail to send the e-mail.\nHow can I configure Postfix to not relay internally such e-mails and instead resolve MX records and send them as classic e-mails?\nMany thanks!\n\nA: Open your postfix configuration file (usually /etc/postfix/main.cf) in a text editor.  I like vim.\n$ sudo vim /etc/postfix/main.cf\n\nFind the line where mydestination is set.  It probably looks something like this:\nmydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost\n\nComment that line out by prefixing it with a #.\n# mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost\n\nAdd the following line and then save the file.\nmydestination =\n\nRestart postfix\n$ service postfix stop\n$ service postfix start\n\nPostfix will no longer try to deliver 'local' email to this server but will use the SMTP server given by the DNS MX record.\n\nA: You may want to exclude only $mydomain from mydestination list, i.e:\n    mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain\nin case your hostname was .sampledomain.xxx\nThis setup would still allow receive local system notifications, such as root\n", "Q: Install Skype for Ubuntu 15.04 I have Ubuntu 15.04 installed, but I can't find Skype in it.

I installed Ubuntu on an external hard drive (Seagate 2 Terabytes usb3) and everything seems normal.\nBut when I unplug the external hard drive and plug it again and then start the computer, I cannot boot from this external hard drive.\nDo you know how can I resolve this issue?\nThanks!\nNote: I know I can repair the boot by launching bootrepair utility, but that's not something I want to do everytime I unplug my external hard drive.\nNote2: Changing the harddrive isn't something I want to do. I had CentOS on it before and it worked just great.\n\nA: If the computer is booting in EFI mode, as your \"UEFI\" tag and the symptoms imply, then you should first be aware of the cause of the problem: External media normally boot using the default/fallback boot filename, which is EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi on the EFI System Partition (ESP) on x86-64/AMD64 systems. Most OS installations are to internal disks, which boot using customized entries stored in NVRAM. External media can also boot with such entries; but some EFIs delete entries that they can't see when you boot, so customized entries for external media can disappear if the external medium is unplugged while the system boots another OS.\nThree solutions occur to me:\n\n\n*\n\n*The most straightforward solution is to move/rename your boot loader. Ubuntu installs its boot loader as EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi and EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi on the ESP, which is normally mounted at /boot/efi in Ubuntu. Rename EFI/ubuntu on the ESP to EFI/BOOT on the ESP. You must then rename shimx64.efi to bootx64.efi. (If your system does not use Secure Boot, you may optionally rename grubx64.efi to bootx64.efi instead of renaming shimx64.efi.) This solution has the advantage that your external disk should be bootable on most EFI-based computers of the same architecture as the original computer.\n\n*Install my rEFInd boot manager to your internal disk's ESP and set it as the default boot program. You could do this in Ubuntu by unmounting the external ESP from /boot/efi, mounting the internal ESP to /boot/efi, and installing the Debian package (but not the PPA version). Do not edit /etc/fstab. Once set up in this way, rEFInd should launch on every boot, even when your external disk is unplugged; but because rEFInd builds its boot list on every boot, ignoring NVRAM entries, Ubuntu entries will appear only when the external disk is plugged in. This solution has the advantage of per-boot adaptability. You can even set rEFInd's defaults so that Ubuntu is the default boot option when the external disk is plugged in but Windows takes top spot when the disk is removed. One caveat: If you're using Secure Boot, you'll have to jump through some extra hoops to get it working. Copying the EFI/ubuntu directory tree from the external ESP to the internal one before installing rEFInd, then deleting EFI/ubuntu from the internal ESP, should do the job.\n\n*You can re-install GRUB to an ESP on an internal hard disk. To do this, you'll need to unmount /boot/efi from Ubuntu, mount an internal disk's ESP to /boot/efi, and re-install GRUB. You may want to update your /etc/fstab, too. This approach can be tricky, though; some GRUB configurations rely on a GRUB configuration file in /boot/grub, and if yours does this, /boot will also need to be on the internal disk or else GRUB will stop working when you unplug that disk, which means you won't be able to boot anything except by using the computer's built-in boot manager. I haven't been following the details of where Ubuntu stores its GRUB configuration file, so I'm not sure how likely you are to run into this problem.\n\n\nPersonally, I'd go with one of the first two solutions, since I'm not entirely sure where Ubuntu stores its grub.cfg file these days. That third option might be viable if you know that file gets stored on the same ESP as GRUB, or if you're willing to create a /boot partition on your internal disk.\n\nA: I do have the same external HDD (seagate 1 TB) and i have installed elemantry os luna in it.In your case you should go to the boot device selection menu when your computer boots up and choose to boot your external HDD.\n\nA: Make sure you got the device correctly connected to the computer before power it up.\nIf you can't see the device in the boot device selection menu, try to select it manually in the bios menu. You should be able to order a boot device priority here and put it on the top of all devices. If you can't see it here, make sure the device actually works connecting it to another computer.\n\nA: My story (can be useful to someone with the same problem):\nI’ve installed Ubuntu on external USB 3.0 hard drive on an iMac late 2013. I created the following partition scheme on that external drive:\nEFI (200MB FAT), BOOT (200MB EXT2) and / (20GB EXT4)\n\nI choose to add a bootloader to the External drive (not the iMac drive)\nAfter the successful installation, I was shocked when I couldn’t boot my OS X. It's strange because I didn't install any bootloader on main drive.\nIf I removed the external drive, I get a black screen with the grub prompt command!\nIn panic, I researched online and I decided to give a try to rEFInd.

After 15 seconds, it terminates anyway to prevent running infinitely if no window appears.\nNote\nThe script assumes the screens are top-alligned. If there is a large difference, the script might need a little tweaking to prevent windows from \"bumping\" against the border of the other screen.\n\nA: Here's an idea for a startup script or at least a script that can be bound to a shortcut to launch windows for the first time:\nStep 1\nFind out your root window width and height. This can be done with \nxwininfo -root | awk '/Width/,/Height/ {print}'\nor\nxprop -root | awk '$1~/NET_DESKTOP_GEOMETRY/ {print }\nSample outputs are bellow\n$ xwininfo -root | awk '/Width/,/Height/ {print}'                           \n  Width: 1366\n  Height: 768\n$ xprop -root | awk '$1~/NET_DESKTOP_GEOMETRY/ {print}'                                                      \n_NET_DESKTOP_GEOMETRY(CARDINAL) = 1366, 768\n\nStep 2\nInstall wmctrl with sudo apt-get install wmctrl\nThis tool allows for altering some of the windows properties by referring to their hex id or the window title. I've explained how it works on another question which i will link later here\nStep 3\nCreate this script in your ~/bin folder or somewhere that is part of your path. You can also bind the full path to this script to shortcut or create a .desktop shortcut. Notice that since my screen is 1366 x 768, I use 1300 as my max right side x-offset. Adapt the script according to your specs in step 1. Notice that if you have duplicate windows, this might break, so this is good mostly for launching two program windows for the first time\n#!/bin/sh\n# Author: Serg Kolo\n# Description: Send two different applications to different windows\nset -x\n\nLEFT=$(zenity --entry --text=\"What to put on the left?\")\nRIGHT=$(zenity --entry --text=\"What to put on the right?\")\n\n$LEFT &\n$RIGHT &\nsleep 1\n\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n    # Get title of the left window\n    LEFT_TITLE=\"$(wmctrl -l | grep -i $LEFT | awk '{$1=$2=$3=\"\";print}')\"\n    # Get title of the right window\n    RIGHT_TITLE=\"$(wmctrl -l | grep -i $RIGHT | awk '{$1=$2=$3=\"\";print }')\"\nprintf \"THIS IS A TEST %s\",$LEFT_TITLE\nprintf \"THIS IS A TEST 2 %s\",$RIGHT_TITLE\n    wmctrl -r $LEFT_TITLE -e 0,0,0,600,600\n\n    sleep 0.5\n\n    wmctrl -r $RIGHT_TITLE -e 0,1300,0,600,600\n\nfi\n\nNow, you could adapt this script to behave as a launcher for just one window and specify if you want that to be on right side or left. I will work on this idea a little bit later in the day, but basic idea is to again, use two popups and if statement. Another idea that I have is to use awk to extract relevant info from single popup. I'll edit my answer once I complete the scripts\nEdit\nAnd here is the launcher for single window; type in programname,L for left placement, and programname,R for right placement\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# set -x\nPROG=$(zenity --entry --text=\"Program,L or R ?\")\n\nNAME=$(echo $PROG | cut -d ',' -f1)\nSIDE=$(echo $PROG | cut -d ',' -f2)\n$NAME &\nsleep 1\n\nif [ $? -eq 0 ] \nthen\n\n    TITLE=$( wmctrl -l | grep -i $NAME| awk '{$1=$2=$3=\"\"; print}' )\n\n    sleep 0.5\nif [ $SIDE = \"L\" ];then\n    wmctrl -r $TITLE -e 0,0,0,600,600\nelse\n    wmctrl -r $TITLE -e 0,1300,0,600,600\nfi\n\nfi\n\n", "Q: Maximum time for which a Linux PC can be UP? Actually I had a linux system ( running Ubuntu 12.04.3 ) for days without reboot.\nI ran in to some errors like sleep getting hang and some network mounted file system not getting mount even able to ping it (verified via other PC, the network mount was working fine).\nWanted to check if Linux also requires to reboot the machine after some time frame to avoid these types of weired errors which are non repeatable. \nWhat is the maximum time we can maintain the PC up? \nAre there some other problems that could occur if we have a system up for year or more without reboot?\n\nA: While I'm certain that there are servers with a higher uptime, I present the following from one of mine as an example of what is possible:\n# uptime\n04:58:44 up 2186 days, 23:15,  1 user,  load average: 0.02, 0.02, 0.00\n\nThis server was installed shortly after the DC it's in went live and hasn't been turned off since.  Thus far it has continued happily doing what it was originally intended for and when that purpose gets moved to a different server I'll put something on there just to monitor the uptime and it will probably stay up until I can't justify keeping it alive any longer.\nThus I think \"There is no maximum\" is quite definitely the correct answer.\n\nA: I was in a class once with a sysadmin who claimed he had a linux server which was running with no reboots for over a decade. There is no inherent reason a system needs to be rebooted regularly. It is only required in limited instances such as kernel updates.\nFWIW, I usually leave my Windows home computer running. It will usually run just fine for weeks without rebooting.\n\nA: Linux (the kernel) is very good at freeing resources when programs exit.  GNU/Linux, the entire OS, is generally fine to run indefinitely.  Restarting user-space programs after you update them is generally a good idea, and often the easiest way to get everything using an updated glibc is to reboot the system.\nOn systems with driver bugs (typically graphics driver bugs, everything else is usually rock solid), you sometimes get weird behaviour that gets weirder if you don't reboot soon.  If you see a kernel OOPS in your dmesg output, you should reboot as soon as is convenient, and report it (or google around for other people with similar problems on similar hardware, in case it's a known problem).  Distros don't ship the very latest dev versions of the graphics stack, so sometimes the bug is already fixed upstream, and your graphics card is just too new for the drivers on the distro version you're running to be stable.  In that case, look for a PPA with updated builds of mesa/drm/xorg.  (I'm not sure what the best choice for running Ubuntu with a bleeding edge graphics stack is ATM).\nAnyway, barring driver or other kernel bugs, Linux can run indefinitely without needing a reboot to clear memory fragmentation or anything like that.\nI have a Linux router/firewall/mailserver/shell box (P3 450MHz, OCed to 500MHz) which routinely sees uptimes of hundreds of days.  I reboot only to rearrange power cords, or to replace a failing power supply.  It's been going steady with the same CPU/RAM/hard drives for probably 15 years.  I've never had to reboot \"because it was getting unstable\".  It was always for a specific reason, like failing power supply, or kernel upgrade, or power outage and my UPS battery was almost drained (triggering auto shutdown with apcupsd).\nIf your system is acting weird, check dmesg for problems.  If it's just your desktop, then if you just installed some non-kernel package updates, log out / log in (or reboot, but you don't have to).  I've found Kubuntu 15.04 will easily run into problems after package updates, I think due to binary incompatibility between upgraded / non-upgraded versions of the same library running in the same binary.  (See discussion on this bug).\nMy go-to for checking for hardware problems is to boot memtest86+.  (aptitude install memtest86+)  Let that run a full pass, or run overnight.  That doesn't guarantee a stable system, since power supply voltage dips on spike loads can happen with CPUs these days, and memtest won't rule that out.  Nor will it get your CPU hot, like Prime95.\n\nA: Working as a system administrator, I see Linux servers up for over 700-800 days without reboot, so there are no uptime limitations; the errors you got are not related to Linux (the kernel) itself.\nA lot of services can be restarted and most errors can be solved on production systems.\n\nA: My machine only restarted today for the 15.04 after being up for 11 days without any strange errors which I can recall. If you are doing heavy work and development on a system, it can sometimes be the only option to reboot, but it's only ever on a need-basis.\n\nA: There is no technical need to restart your computer after a certain time period. I've had mine running for months (incl. kernel module updates) with some suspensions (to RAM and disk) in between.\nThere are occasions where\n\n\n*\n\n*it's absolutely necessary to reboot, like kernel updates (but those aren't urgent in many situations, and in some cases you can replace a running kernel with a new one on a live system. See kexec and Ksplice)\n\n*it may be easier to restart the whole system instead of just a particular (set of) subsystem(s).\n\n\nThere may be some issues that “become worse” over time (e. g. hardware driver issues, leaky processes), but those are considered bugs and can often be fixed with a software upgrade or worked around by a reload/restart of that particular subsystem (also see above).\n\nA: I don't know whether this has an impact over system's stability, but the maximum uptime shown in Ubuntu with kernel 3.19-xx is 68,0962597349822 years on a 32-bit machine and 292471208677,8627 years on a 64-bit machine.\nThat's because the system's current uptime, which is returned by the sysinfo() syscall, is returned as a __kernel_long_t type, which is a declared as a long in a 32-bit kernel and as a long long in a 64-bit kernel;\nA long on a 32-bit machine has a maximum value of 2147483647;\nA long long on a 64-bit machine has a maximum value of 9223372036854775807;\nDoing the math, 2147483647s = 68,0962597349822 years and 9223372036854775807s = 292471208677,8627 years.\nOnce this value increases exceeding its type's capability, an arithmetic overflow takes place and it's set to the smallest value allowed by its type (in both cases a negative number): this might be an issue for programs relying on it.\n\nA: Technically there are no limits. you just have to set it to not sleep or shut down.\n\nA: Not specific to Ubuntu, but I've got a 1997 vintage laptop (300 MHz, 288 MB RAM) running a Debian-based distro that has had uptime upwards of 60 days, while running a single program (plus system stuff and conky) and not starting and stopping other software except a terminal to load updates weekly.  Eventually, it crashed when loading the updates, at around 63 days.  By contrast, my Kubuntu 14.04 desktop system will freeze in screen lock after around two weeks.  I agree with other answers; it's more about what software you run and how often you start and stop other programs, than about Linux as such.\n\nA: Personally I wouldn't want to run my laptop or PC for days with out rebooting or shutting it down. \nSimply because of the main components that generate heat can speed up the wear and tear on the MB. \n(Thats if you don't have the proper cooling and ventilation)\n", "Q: How to give an applet shutdown privileges? I'm using the Mate Sensor Applet (/usr/lib/mate-sensors-applet/mate-sensors-applet) and to prevent high temperatures I added this shutdown command:\nshutdown -h 1\n\nBut it doesn't has an effect... I think it hasn't sudo/shutdown privileges.\nIs there a way to assign only shutdown privileges?\n\nA: The easiest way for this without using sudo everytime is giving shutdown command special permissions, so that if the user runs shutdown it will run with root permissions for this do\nsudo chmod u+s /sbin/shutdown\n\nnow the shutdown command won't need root everytime you issue the command and if you wan't to revert it you can always do\n sudo chmod u-s /sbin/shutdown \n\nand user will need to be root to execute shutdown again.\n\nA: In /etc/sudoers file add a line:\n%sudo ALL=  NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown\n\nTo edit /etc/sudoers file, run visudo command.\n", "Q: Xubuntu 15.04 goes to sleep when the screen is locked Since I did the upgrade to 15.04 there is a very strange behaviour whenever I lock the screen. \nRight after the screen is locked and the monitor turns black the computer goes to sleep (or suspend mode, I don't know exactly what's the correct term for this). To wake it up I have to first press the enter key. Then the computer is revived, but the monitor is all grey and I have to click on it for the login screen to show up. This is the moment where I can finally introduce my password to login. And of course, going to sleep it means that my network connection is disconnected every time (very annoying because it terminates all my active connections). \nThis never happened before, everything worked fine with the lock screen process up until the upgrade. I checked the settings for power management and light locker but there are no options that I can use to forbid the computer to go to sleep when the screen is locked.\nWhat should I do ?\n\nA: This behaviour has been around since at least Ubuntu 14.04 (i.e. kernel 3.13) and is reported as Bug #1350513. On Sony models Ctrl+Alt+F1 and Ctrl+Alt+L can start the shut-down procedure; on Lenovo models it sends the system to sleeping mode.\nIn all likelihood these are all symptoms of a same issue with the kernel. I would suggest you jump over to Launchpad and report there in detail your computer model and all the procedures that unexpectedly send the system to sleeping mode.\n\nA: Perhaps it is related with this change of terminals:\n\nOne thing that changes for users is the fact that locking with LightDM means that a new virtual terminal is opened. In a default single-user session, the user’s X session rests at VT7 (reachable with the keyboard-shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F7). When you lock your session, LightDM sends a lock signal, light-locker locks the session on VT7 and you get forwarded to VT8, where you’re presented with the login greeter, which serves as the unlock dialog.\nThe aforementioned change introduces one inconvenience you might (or might not) notice: when light-locker switches the VT, there is some screenflickering and it could take a second or two on older machines.\n\nThe behaviour you described happened to me in 14.04 and continues to do so in 16.04. I never had 15.04, but you see/saw it there too. I do not know any actual answer, but wanted to point at that quote nonetheless :)\n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu 15.04 alongside Win8 with something else option in a new partition of HDD.

Or is it required to load it expressly? Some related questions I am running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I believe the following shows which iptables matching modules are loaded:\n    sudo cat /proc/net/ip_tables_matches\n\nQuestion: I see conntrack listed three times. Why?\nSo I tried to see what .so are there which come part of iptables. Listed the .so files under /var/lib/dpkg/info/iptables.list. There are multiple .so there.\nAll this arose because I wanted to load -m mac module. The following iptables rule was giving an error:\niptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.88 -m mac --mac-source 00-27-0E-33-4B-B2 -j DROP\n\nI figured I needed to load mac to have the error go away. How do I load the matching mac-address iptables module? And if I want to load any other iptables match module? Are these not loaded automatically by the kernel on an as needed basis?\n\nA: You ask 4 questions. I can answer 3 of them.\nAny required module will be loaded automatically by iptables when it is required. Some years ago, modules had to be specifically loaded. Some critical applications still force load the modules, so that there is no delay when iptables realizes it needs the module.\nNow, the issue with your MAC related iptables rule, is bad syntax and not module loaded or not loaded. This line:\niptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.88 -m mac --mac-source 00-27-0E-33-4B-B2 -j DROP\n\nShould be this:\niptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.88 -m mac --mac-source 00:27:0E:33:4B:B2 -j DROP\n\nYour question about conntrack module listed 3 times, I do not know why. Perhaps because you are using it in 3 different ways, but that is just a guess. \n", "Q: Make nautilus to adjust icons size In the following picture, I want nautilus to scale up mp3 icon so that it seems as same size as two other thumbnails.\n\nWhat I've done but seemed with no luck:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manipulating org.gnome.nautilus.icon-view settings.\n\n*Trying to making icons larger or smaller with Ctrl++\nSuch bevaiour already has been provided by the Dolphin file manager and in which all icons, either default icons or thumbnails, are approximately in the same size. But unfortunately Nautilus cannot be replaced by Dolphin.\n\nA: The thumbnail indeed is not an icon. Thumbnails are reduced-size versions of pictures, used to help in recognizing and organizing them.\nReally, what you are talking about is not a problem  since nautilus deals with each file type as the same.\nWhat I want to say take a look for all directories in your system. All icons have the same size.\nTake a look at the icons of the applications, you'll notice that they are affected by size provided by the system and all of them has the same size. for example look at /usr/share/applications.\nBut Sure a thumbnail maybe with a different size of icons since it's a small sized of a picture that it will take a rate of the original picture and thus varies according to the size of the original one.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 - Keyboard shortcuts I saw a keyboard shortcuts list when I first installed Ubuntu 15.04.

You must try to reduce the amount of data you are making and try again. \"\nSolutions please\n\nA: relinux and remastersys create a bootable .iso from your current system, which means that a good portion of your filesystem is directly copied (and compressed) to the .iso file.\nIf your filesystem is larger than 4GB, it will bail, since 4GB is the largest file size that the ISO 9660 Level 2 specification allows.\nKeep the size of your filesystem under 4GB, if at all possible (although, /home will not be included, so that can be as large as you want). Slightly more than that (say, 5GB) probably won't matter (depending on the type of data that exists on your filesystem), since it is compressed, but don't go much larger than that.\n", "Q: Will my Live USB stick work if it already has another OS on it?
