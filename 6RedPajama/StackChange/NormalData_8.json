["Q: How to resolve error: \"Couldn't modify partition map because file system verification failed\"? I upgraded to Lion and decided I no longer want 100 GB of my drive devoted to Boot Camp, I never boot into Windows, I just use it as a VM anyways. So I deleted the boot camp partition using disk utility and then attempted to expand the main partition to fill this now unallocated space. I also deleted the boot camp from inside VMWare Fusion. When I go to expand it, I get the error in the title of this question.\nAfter searching this forum and Google, I found a lot of people with similar problems but none receiving this exact error with any resolution. I do not want to do a clean install if at all possible. I have enabled debug mode in Disk Utility and tried other stuff, but to no avail. \nI've tried editing it in normal and in debug mode while running Lion, and I've tried in recovery mode.\nHere are screenshots of the error and whatnot. Any ideas?\n\n\nUPDATE: I verified my disk and got these errors. Attempting to repair but worried that my Snow Leopard disk will overwrite the Lion recovery partition....\n\n\nA: OK, this isn't too bad. Reboot while holding Command ⌘-S to enter single user mode. When it gives you a prompt, type\nfsck -fy\n\nthen press return. it will repair your disk. When it's done, type \nreboot\n\nand try partitioning again.\n\nA: The solution ended up being to create a Lion install disk, boot from the disk, run disk utility repair on the drive and volume, then resize the partition. Easier than I thought it would be.\n\nA: This solution worked for me after receiving the same error:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down.\n\n*Start up holding down Command ⌘ + S. (This will boot you into Single User Mode.)\n\n*At the prompt, type in the command fsck -fy.\n\n*When that finishes, type reboot.\n\n*Try resizing again in Disk Utility.\n\n\nA: I had this issue and couldn't resolve it this way because I had a 4gb swap drive (ubuntu linux) that needed to be turned off before disk utility could remove it.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot to to Ubuntu Live CD (I used an EFI boot via usb)\n\n*open gparted via terminal $ sudo gparted\n\n*look for a partition with a key symbol on it's same line\n\n*right click the key symbol and select \"swap off\"\n\n*reboot back to mac then follow steps above\n\n\nCheers\n", "Q: Can the macbook air trackpad play nice with the iOS simulator? Does anyone knows if (and how) I can get my MacBook Air trackpad to feel more natural when used with the iOS simulator ?\nIt should be easier to use the iOS simulator with the trackpad - but it's not, it's way more difficult to scroll :-( It feels weird but it's the only time I wish I had a mouse on my mac book air - to emulate a touch screen :-|\n\nA: Unfortunatly the simulator was not built to understand multi-touch gestures which is strange considering the rest of the OS has. I think you will just need to wait until Apple updates the simulator.\n\nA: This might help, I posted this elsewhere:\nEnable 3 finger drag: \n\n\n*\n\n*From the Apple menu, choose System Preferences.\n\n*Click the Accessibility icon\n\n*Choose Mouse & Trackpad from the options on the left\n\n*Click Trackpad Options\n\n*Place a checkmark next to \"Enable dragging\" \n\n*From the related pop-up menu, choose “three finger drag” so there's a checkmark next to it\n\n*Click OK\n\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204609\n\nA: Have a look at the iOS Simulator Plus utility I wrote.

I'm looking to get myself a Mini DisplayPort -> VGA adapter so that I can attach a hand-me-down LCD display. The LCD display has a native resolution of 1280 x 1024.\nCan the MacBook Pro use both displays at once, with the main notebook display at 1280x800 and the external display at 1280x1024?\nIn general, can the Mini DisplayPort output a resolution different from the main notebook display?\n\nA: Yes, mismatched resolutions are no problem. I'm running a similar set up right now. You can arrange them however you like in the Displays section of System Preferences.\n", "Q: How do I update the Icon of a program running from /usr/local/bin on the Dock? I often run mvim from iTerm, and it pops up on the Dock with the default vim icon. A friend gave me a nice icon for mvim, how do I go about updating the icon for mvim launched from a console?\n\nA: There's two main ways of changing the icon for an application.\nThe first (and free) way is to navigate to the application itself (most likely in your /Applications folder). Right-click the app (MacVim.app), and select \"Get Info\". Then, drag the new icon onto existing icon displayed in the Get Info pane. In this Adium example, you'd drag the new icon over the Adium duck icon. A password pane will most likely pop up - enter your password and you should be all set.\n\nThe other way is to buy CandyBar for $30. CandyBar is a much easier to way to manage large scale icon changes, plus provides an interfaces for organized vast icon libraries. But if you are just looking to change one icon, it is probably overkill.\n\nA: LiteIcon is a free alternative to Candybar. I've used it quite a bit and I really like it.\n", "Q: How to set a Reminder on iOS5 for a location AND date? I'd like to set a Reminder on iOS5 for my iPhone 4 for when I leave work on Friday... However, the app seems to allow only location OR date/time notifications (or you can have both independently). Is there any way to get them to work in conjunction with one another as I'd like?\n\nA: This is not currently possible. The Location and Time conditions are applied in a disjunctive manner. \n", "Q: What software is best for taking notes fast and keeping in sync between iOS and web? My requirements are very simple- I want notes that I can access quickly and easily via the web (from my Mac or PC) and also via iPhone and iPad.\nFor iOS, it's critical that I can go from having an idea to typing it out immediately- think the level of speed of the default \"Notes\" app in iOS app.\nA rich text editor would be nice, but not necessary at all.\nThe iOS built in Notes app would be perfect if I could sync it to Google Docs, but I don't think it can. Google Docs itself is great on Mac/PC, but takes much too long to get started writing a note on iOS devices. I've tried Evernote, which is almost good, but unfortunately I've found that editing notes back and forth between web and iOS usually tends to revert back changes and get other very bad behavior. \nAny ideas very welcome. Bells and whistles like rich text, tagging, etc. would be swell but not necessary at all, all I really care is being super fast, and able to sync.\n\nA: Simplenote has an iOS app and it syncs back to the Web, so can be accessed from the iOS device, and/or your Mac or PC. \nhttp://simplenoteapp.com/\nOn your Mac, apps like Notational Velocity will also sync. There are apps for PCs well.\n\nA: Evernote is to me the simplest i know. And works well.\n\nA: There are a million ways to do this, but the gist of all of them is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put your notes in the cloud. This is the essential step. Choosing where in the cloud is a matter of which apps you'll use.\n\n*Use a good app on the desktop to edit them. Candidates are:\n\n*\n\n*Notational Velocity syncs with SimpleNote or Dropbox. You can back the notes with simple text files so other apps on your computer can see them.\n\n*nvAlt is a fork of Notational Velocity that also syncs with SimpleNote or Dropbox. Again with the files, which is nice.\n\n*Evernote syncs via their own service (no direct file access), but lets you store images, and does OCR in the cloud.\n\n\n*Use a good app on iOS to edit them. Candidates are:\n\n*\n\n*Elements is a nice Dropbox editor with Markdown support\n\n*PlainText is another Dropbox editor\n\n*SimpleNote has a nice editor for talking to their service.\n\n*Evernote has their own app to talk to their service\n\n\n\nChoosing an option depends entirely on your needs: if you need to put up images or want to take pictures of whiteboards and OCR them, Evernote is great. If you don't, use nvAlt and SimpleNote. If you prefer to have direct file access and make everything UNIXy, or like the Markdown features, go with nvAlt and Elements over Dropbox.\nPersonally, I've moved through exactly that progression. I started looking for the neat features of Evernote, then decided I disliked their interface and didn't use the features, so dropped down to Notational Velocity/SimpleNote, then realized that I wrote Markdown everywhere and wanted to see that on iOS so moved to nvAlt/Dropbox/SimpleNote.\n\nA: I use dropbox.\ni store all my notes as txt files in a folder called notes in dropbox, and just use a text editor app on my iphone and ipad that supports dropbox.\nwhen i get home my macbook and windows pc have all the updated notes on them.\ni currently use textastic for editing, as i use it for writing code and ftp also.\nthere are probably some more simplified note editors that support dropbox on the app store.\n\nA: The answer above by TALlama is nice but doesn't pick a single solution.\nI propose Simplenote on iOS and nvALT for the Mac [OS X] as the best combination to accomplish your goal of quick, easy and fast. Simplenote also has some of the bells and whistles like tagging and can be used for free or a paid option. The author of nvALT is well known for covering this space with an excellent review of an amazingly comprehensive review of text editors on iOS.\n\nA: AwesomeNote may satisfy your needs on the iPhone / iPad end - it can sync to either EverNote or Google Documents.\nIt also has folders (which can be individually password protected), multiple note formats (Normal, To-do, Anniversary/Reminder, and Diary), and tagging. The folders themselves also have a number of formats that interact well with the note formats. That said, it only takes one click to start writing a note after starting the app - click on '+' in the upper right hand corner. You can also backup via iTunes File Sharing or through a simple web interface over Wi-Fi.\n\nA: Nothing beats Evernote. \nWhy: \nA. It's free\nB. It syncs across multiple computers (both PC and Mac) and multiple smartphones. \nC. You're given a free and unique email address which allows you to quickly email your EN account any new notes (especially good for turning any existing email into notes).\nC. It has 4 really fast and powerful ways of adding notes: \nAll of the different ways to quickly get outside information into Evernote as a to-do: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open EN directly, hit the New Note icon (or shortcut Command-N/Control-N) and type away. \n\n*Globally from anywhere on your computer, hit Control-Command-N for Mac, xxx for Windows. \n\n*From inside your email program, send any email to EN by emailing it to your unique EN email address (if you've forgotten it, you'll find it under the menu: Evernote: Account Info…)\n\n*From inside your web browser, you can use the Evernote Web Clipper, which once installed, will show up in your browser tab row. Clicking it will give you the choice to either save the entire page's contents, or just the URL. \n", "Q: How to setup iTunes account in a business environment and can you share app purchases? I'm considering switching to Mac's for our new in-house marketing and graphic design department. Currently we use CS5 master suite collection and the licenses can be reappointed from pc to Mac.\nI don't have access to a Mac or the Mac App Store and have questions about licensing. I'd like to have each computer to have the respective user to load their private iTunes account with their own private purchases.  Is it possible to then login to an company iTunes account and install a program like FCP, the switch back to the users account?\n\nA: Below is the Apple license agreement for the Mac App store, accessed on 24 January 2012.\nAccording to a layman's reading of the text (I am not and do not pretend to be a lawyer), what you describe should be both possible and allowed under the terms of the license.\nYou or your IT staff would log in to the Macs, authenticate to the Mac App Store with your  company Apple ID, install the App(s), then sign out of the Mac App Store.  Your employees could then log in with their personal accounts and install any Apps they may have purchased, although according to the text in section i, they shouldn't do company work with their personal apps.\nI hope this is helpful.\nFrom http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/us/terms.html\n\nMAC APP STORE PRODUCT USAGE RULES\nExcept as otherwise set forth herein,\n(i) If you are an individual acting in your personal capacity, you may\n  download and use an application from the Mac App Store (“Mac App Store\n  Product”) for personal, non-commercial use on any Apple-branded\n  products running Mac OS X (“Mac Computer”) that you own or control.\n(ii) If you are a commercial enterprise or educational institution,\n  you may download a Mac App Store Product for use by either (a) a\n  single individual on each of the Mac Computer(s) used by that\n  individual that you own or control or (b) multiple individuals on a\n  single shared Mac Computer that you own or control. For example, a\n  single employee may use a Mac App Store Product on both the employee’s\n  desktop Mac Computer and laptop Mac Computer, or multiple students may\n  serially use a Mac App Store Product on a single Mac Computer located\n  at a resource center or library. For the sake of clarity, each Mac\n  Computer used serially by multiple users requires a separate license.\n(iii) Use may require sign-in with the Apple ID used to download the\n  Mac App Store Product from the Mac App Store. Mac App Store Products\n  can be updated through the Mac App Store only.\n\n\nA: In short: Yes.\nYou can log in and out of iTunes multiple times with different accounts. The applications will be linked to the correct account automatically. Updates will need to be processed by login in and out of the correct account.\nI did this for a while between a US and SA account and effectually ended up moving all my purchases to the US account for convenience sake.\nThe Mac AppStore, unlike the iTunes store, does not offer gifting of Apps or the ability to by volume licenses yet, so creating a single corporate account would be the only option in this scenario.\nFor clarification, the Mac App Store is separate from iTunes. The iOS App Store is only for purchases on iDevices, where the Mac App Store, a separate application, is for purchases on Mac Desktops/Laptops. You can use the same Apple ID on both thought.\n", "Q: Guest login got enabled even though FileVault 2 is enabled and Guest login is disabled I rebooted my Mac yesterday after installing the Apple update TS4088. Even though I disabled Guest Logins in my Users Preferences and have enabled FileVault 2 since the start, I am able to see Guest Login which is showing the following notice\n\nThe computer will restart to a secure, safari only system for the guest user\n\nIs there a way to disable the Guest user ? The whole drive is supposed to be encrypted ideally, but looks like there is a bug ?\n\n\nRelated Questions/Articles:\nFile Vault 2 - Apple KB article\nCan FileVault show the login window as 'name and password', not 'list of users'?\nUnable to create Guest Account after enabling FileVault\nHow to create a pseudo-guest account in Lion with FileVault 2?\n\nA: How to disable that “Guest User” from appearing at the OS X 10.7.2 login screen\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Click on “Security & Privacy”\n\n*Click the lock in the lower corner and type in your administrative\npassword to unlock the control panel\n\n*Check the box next to “Disable restarting to Safari when screen is\nlocked”\n\n\nThis prevents the Guest User account from being visible at the login screen both during reboot and at the login screen. Again, it’s highly recommended to keep this enabled for security purposes, but if your Mac is locked down with a security cable or you don’t have any use for Find My Mac, you could disable this and not feel too bad about it.\n\nIf you haven’t tried it yet, clicking on the Guest User account gives you this message:\nThis computer will restart to a secure, Safari-only system for the Guest user.\nThe reboot process is quick and opens directly to Safari, there is no access to anything else. No Finder, no preferences, nothing.\nSource: osxdaily\n\nA: This appears to be by design.\nKeep in mind, the whole drive is still encrypted with File Vault. The 10.7.2 Guest/Safari-only User only has access to / runs off the Recovery partition, not the main volume where your user data and applications are stored. \nIf someone does login to the Guest User, they have no access to the system partition, and as a bonus, the Mac is findable via Find-My-Mac.\n\nA: This a common issue, specially with the latest version of OS X like 10.11. The issue you guys are facing is mostly caused by settings new Macs with \"Find My Mac\" and File Vault enabled at the first boot.\nYou can remove the guest account by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable \"Find My Mac\" at System Preferences > iCloud > Find My Mac\n\n*Disable the guest account at System Preferences > Users > Guest User\n\n\nHowever it might not be enough!! File Vault login screen is not part of the system - it's built right on the EFI. When you setup a new computer / change users accounts the OS actually notifies the EFI of changes and apparently there might be a but where disabling the guest user won't make the system notify the EFI.\nAfter some thought, I came up with a solution to force the EFI login screen update:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure \"Find My Mac\" and the Guest User are disabled and reboot (if the problem persists continue);\n\n*Check if \"System Integrity Protection\" (rootless) is enabled: Run csrutil status at the Terminal App and if it says \"System Integrity Protection status: enabled.\" (if it says disabled, only do 2.4 and 2.7):\n2.1. Reboot your computer in \"Recovery Mode\": Shutdown and hold Command + R right after pressing the power button;\n2.2.  Go into \"Utilities > Terminal\" and run the command: csrutil disable;\n2.3. Reboot the computer;\n2.4. After login open the Terminal app and run: sudo touch /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/EFILogin.framework/Resources/EFIResourceBuilder.bundle/Contents/Resources this will force the EFI login update;\n2.5. Reboot your computer (again) in \"Recovery Mode\": Shutdown and hold Command + R right after pressing the power button;\n2.6.  Go into \"Utilities > Terminal\" and run the command: csrutil enable;\n2.7. Reboot the computer.\nYour problem should be fixed, I used this fix on two different machines and it seems to work perfectly. Enjoy. ;)\n\nA: With 10.7.2 iCloud is installed. If you set it up, if I remember correctly, Find My Mac is enabled by default. Regardless of your options in Users & Groups the Guest User will show up.\nTo remove the guest User go to iCloud preference pane and turn off Find My Mac. \n\n", "Q: Is it possible to add a song on my iTunes Library on the Mac, and sync it to my iPhone through iCloud? Seems like iCloud is not for songs that I ripped from CD and add to my iTunes Library?\nIt seems that I have to hook up the device one by one, the iPhone, the iPad, the iPod, and then drag the song from the iTunes's Library or Playlist to that device?\nI tried that on the iCloud on my PC and it seems to be able to sync the bookmarks, Outlook data, Photos, but not for songs.  Is that correct?  It works for songs that I purchased, but not for songs I ripped from a CD myself?  I haven't tried that on the Mac yet as I am still running Snow Leopard, but upgrading to Lion still might not be able to sync the songs I ripped from CD through iCloud?\niCloud in Control Panel of Windows 7:\n\n\nA: iCloud does not handle music at this time, and likely never will since that content is handled by iTunes, although only for purchased content:\n\nBecause purchased content runs through Apple's servers, it's easy on them to just push the newly purchased song to any device connected to the respective Apple ID yet still retain control of the media, so to speak.\nAs for iCloud on OS X, it only includes a few more features over the Windows version, but none of them deal with music:\n\nI don't doubt they could add the functionality, but it might ruffle feathers (RIAA) and certainly put considerable load on their data centers.\n\nA: As of October 2011, no. iTunes in the Cloud only works for songs you've purchased from the iTunes store. \nHowever, in a few months or so, Apple's iTunes Match service will do exactly what you want. For $25 a year, it uploads all your songs, purchased from iTunes, ripped from CDs, or even those downloaded from unscrupulous sources to iCloud. If iTunes Match finds a match for a song in the iTunes Store, it'll give you access to that song without you having to spend the time uploading it. If it can't find the song, then it uploads it.\nIn short, for free, iTunes in the Cloud will sync songs purchased songs from iTunes. For $25, iTunes Match will sync all of your songs.\niTunes Match has been in beta for a few months now. I believe it was originally due for release in October, though now on Apple's site its release data has just changed to \"Coming Soon\".\n\nA: I think iTunes Match will add this functionality to iCloud at some point although I'm not sure about all the particulars, read here:  \nhttp://www.apple.com/icloud/features/\n", "Q: How do I get Siri to pronounce my name correctly? Siri doesn't pronounce my name correctly. I tried editing the phonetic spelling as it says on many sites, but it doesn't fix the problem. How do I fix this problem?\n\nA: Tell Siri, \"That is not how you pronounce that.\" She will ask you how to pronounce it. Then tell her how and click the correct pronounciation.\n\nA: When this happens, it's usually because the nickname field is also filled in. The nickname field trumps the phonetic first name field. So if you ever used the Siri command \"Call me ...\" she would automatically fill in the nickname field, making the phonetic field useless.\nTo fix the problem, either write the phonetic spelling inside the nickname field, or delete the nickname field and write the phonetic spelling in the phonetic first name field.\nTip: To hear her pronounce your name, you can ask her, \"What is my name?\"\nThe advantage of using the phonetic spelling field is that it expresses the property more accurately. However, I noticed that it has a flaw in that it messes with the sorting in the Contacts app (especially if you sort by first name and include an accented character to help with the pronunciation). Therefore, you might want to use the nickname field instead of phonetic spelling.\n", "Q: What OS X tweaks, hacks, or modifications couldn't you live without?

From their site:\n\nCinch gives you simple, mouse-driven window management by defining the left, right, and top edges of your screen as 'hot zones'. Drag a window until the mouse cursor enters one of these zones then drop the window to have it cinch into place. Cinching to the left or right edges of the screen will resize the window to fill exactly half the screen, allowing you to easily compare two windows side-by-side (splitscreen).

It's a window management tool that lets you draw the desired location of the window on a grid. I believe it was the first on the Mac to use that particular bit of UI genius. \nIt's more configurable, as well; you can control the number of rows and columns in the grid, and optionally include margins between them. You can configure shortcut keys for any possible size and position on any possible grid, not just the top/bottom/left/right halves.\nDivvy is also available for Windows; which means that if you are virtualizing Windows with e.g. VMware Fusion in Unity mode (like Coherence on Parallels) and the Mac-flavour Divvy can't control the layout of Windows' windows, you could trigger the Win-Divvy and adjust the layout.\n\nA: TinkerTool\nAllows you to change additional preference settings Apple has built into Mac OS X.

For example, by pressing Fn and moving my cursor I can move the window under it and pressing Shift-Fn instead resizes the window as I move my cursor.\nWhen people see me using the features, they think I'm a Jedi.

I was under the impression this was a killer feature of iOS5. I'm running the latest versions of OSX, iTunes and iOS.\n\nA: iOS 5 does not do automatic Podcast download or subscription. OTA downloads are available only for Music, Apps and Books under the Settings -> Store screen.\nFor podcast management, you're still required to sync with iTunes. This might change in future versions, but it is not in the current version, nor can I find any references that it will be.\n\nA: If your podcasts are automatically being downloaded by iTunes on your computer, you leave your iTunes running, and you have Wi-Fi Sync enabled, podcasts will be automatically synced to your iOS 5 device when it is charging. \nThis works great for me -- a computer with iTunes constantly running, and my iOS 5 iPhone 4 plugged in to the charger on my bedside table. \n\nA: Doesn't quite answer your question, but there are a number of fantastic iOS podcasting apps that do download automatically over the air and let you stream podcasts as they download as well. \nMy favorite is Instacast. I've switched completely to using Instacast to manage podcasts. No more syncing to iTunes, no more managing podcasts, just subscribe and play. Can't recommend the app enough.\n\n\nA: If you are downloading the podcasts to iTunes first - then you can set up your iPhone/iPad to over the air sync and, YES your podcasts can be included with that. \nYou'll need to leave iTunes running on your computer. Then either start the wireless sync manually on the iDevice (go to \"Settings\", choose \"General\", then click on \"iTunes Wi-Fi Sync\", and finally hit \"Sync Now\") or by setting up iTunes so that it automatically syncs when the device is plugged in to power. (then it just goes over the air when you plug it in)\nHope that's helpful.. \nStruck me that lots of the answers here implied 'no', but the answer is actually 'yes'. \n", "Q: Web Sharing does not work with FileVault? I want to use both Web Sharing and FileVault however when I turned on FileVault, my home directory Sites folder came up in the browser as permission denied, even though the Unix permissions were 777, meaning anyone can access it.\nHow to resolve this?\nAnd by the way where is the toplevel web directory? I am tired of trying to use my ~/Sites directory anyway.\n\nA: I'm assuming you aren't using Lion, since your description sounds more like FileVault 1 (through Snow Leopard) than FileVault 2 (Lion).\nFileVault 1 protects the entire home folder, with encryption when you aren't logged in and permissions when you are. In order to get to files in your Sites folder, the web server process would have to go through your home folder -- since it can't get into your home folder, it also can't get at anything inside it, so the permissions on your Sites folder are irrelevant.  (I'd recommend setting the perms on Sites back to 755, though -- 777 is just a bad idea.)\nAs a result of this, ~/Sites is pretty much useless in FileVault accounts.  Same with ~/Public -- normally, it's for sharing files both locally and (if the services are enabled) over AFP and/or SMB, but with FV it's not reachable.\nBut you do have an alternative: the top level web directory, /Library/WebServer/Documents.  Just replace the default files with your own and you should be good to go.\n\nA: I had a similar experience with filevault 2 and apache (in El Capitan). I run several virtual host at various ports via a custom .conf file that all point to ~/Sites/xxxxx/. After enabling filevault they all went dead w/ permission denied even though file perms were 755 all the way to ~/Sites.\nThen I noticed :80 was still working with the default \"It works!\" test page so I tried to mimic /Library/WebServer/ by making a /Sites at root alongside /Library and set the perms including ACLs to match /Library, but even that failed. At that point, I began to think the permissions thing wasn't totally related to filesystem permission settings, so I cracked open httpd.conf to find out why :80 was working. That's when I found this line...\n\n    #\n    # Controls who can get stuff from this server.\n    #\n    Require all granted\n</Directory>\n\n\nThat was the key. Just add Require all granted to each of your virtual host <Directory> objects and restart Apache.\nAfter that all my stuffed worked and I was able to keep my stuff in ~/Sites.\n", "Q: How can I restore my iPad from iOS 5 to iOS 4? I updated my iPad from iOS 4 to iOS 5 yesterday, without making any backup. However, I  found that it is not convenient for me to debug my programs.

The error is:\n\nthis device isn't eligible for the requested build\n\nCan anyone give me an idea?\n\nA: iTunes will not willingly load a lower iOS onto a device. Have you looked into the tiny umbrella program to see alternate methods to trick iTunes into doing what you wish. \niOS 4 requires an shsh key to sign the 4.3.3 package for your specific device. This key normally comes from the itunes actication servers.

Now before I go off and buy a new keyboard to replace it, is there a way to tell if it is a keyboard problem, or if it might be the logic board? Please, any suggestions would be appreciated. I did not spill anything on it.\n\nA: If the only thing that's broken is the keyboard/typing, your logic board is most likely fine.\nThe logic board (motherboard) will cause lots of problems if it's broken. The fact that your computer is working (mostly) normally means that the logic board is probably fine.\nIf you want to know for sure, you can run Apple Hardware Test to find out.\nIt is entirely possible that your keyboard isn't working, but before you buy a new one you may as well look to make sure it isn't a software problem.\nCan you detect any pattern in when you have this problem? Are some apps worse than others? If so, it's likely that this is a software problem instead of a hardware problem.\nTo troubleshoot a software problem, I recommend that you do a safe boot and try typing. If the problem doesn't occur, you know that it is being caused by something related to your account.

Will upgrading my GPUs work?\nOr is my 'bleeding-edge' workstation now a relic of the past ...?\n\nA: Here is the answer from Chrome help article: \nYou'll need Mac OS 10.5 and Mac OS 10.6 (recommended).\n10.7 I believe is also supported.\nIf you have the following graphics cards, WebGL is unsupported and is disabled by default:\n\n\n*\n\n*NVIDIA GeForce FX Go5200\n\n*ATI Radeon HD2400\n\n*ATI Radeon 2600 series\n\n*ATI Radeon X1900\n\n*GeForce 7300 GT\n\n\nSo, yes, upgrade videocard for WebGL to work.\n", "Q: Icons as whole program I am new to mac. I was wondering something.\nWhen I download something from Internet (i.e. filezilla) it appears as a single file contained in a single icon. However when I double click it runs, and it doesn't need to install something.\nWhen I move the file it still works. What I wonder are these programs single files. On windows same programs need installing and have multiple files etc...\nWhat I wonder are this icons are containers or single file programs. How is this different from installable programs?\n\nA: This is one of the wonders of the Mac. Most Mac applications are packaged up in what's called an \"application bundle.\" It's basically a glorified folder that contains all of the code and data for the application. So, instead of having an application installed to C:/Program Files for example, the app is self-contained. These programs don't have to be \"installed\" as everything they need is already present in that app bundle. Most apps save user preferences and other user data to the ~/Library folder, but the app itself can normally be placed anywhere on your system.\nYou can run those apps from the Downloads folder, though it's generally better to drag them to the /Applications folder on your Mac. This keeps your apps better organized. And occasionally, some apps are improperly coded to work only from the /Applications folder. It's just best practice to keep everything there, but it's by no means required.\nSome Mac apps do have an installer (such as Microsoft Office) as they install files in various places on the machine that are required for the app (such as fonts). \n\nA: The Mac OS X Finder displays a single icon for an app bundle directory.  This directory usually contains several files, including the executable(s), icon files, some data and information files (such as plists), and etc.\nYou can see all this stuff by using unix file listing commands from the Terminal command-line.\n", "Q: How can I discover which files were deleted by `rm -rf`? I had a little problem when running a script: this script reads a config file on $HOME, and it had ~/Downloads inside it.\nInstead of saving a file inside ~/Downloads when I executed the script, since I executed it inside ~/Library, it created ~/Library/~/Downloads.\nInside ~/Library, I did rm -rf ~. After 1-2s I realized my mistake and stopped using ˆ-C - it was deleting my $HOME.\nI know some files were deleted, but don't know which ones. Some hidden files (bash_functions, bash_aliases) were deleted and I had a backup, but some files on $HOME aren't backed up.\nI did a quick verification on my files (seeing the modified dates of the folder on $HOME), it seemed okay, but I know I can't trust my eyes using this approac.\nI know that if I change a file inside a Folder, Mac will change the \"modified\" flag for that folder, but only if a direct child of that folder was changed. Example:\n~/Downloads\n    - file.txt\n    /Mp3\n        - music.mp3\n\nSo, if you change file.txt, ~/Downloads will have it's modified flag changed, but if you change music.mp3, ~/Downloads will not have it's modified flag changed.\nSo here lies the problem: I don't know how rm -rf starts deleting my files. Is is sequentially? Is it in an arbitrary order? Could it be it started deleting ~/Pictures/Wedding and suddenly went do ~/Videos? I don't know. I believe it doesn't delete sequentially, so now I can have a really deep directory without important files after my rm -rfmistake.\nIs there some place on the mac where all deleted files with rm -rf are kept (just the filenames)? I didn't find anything like that, so I did\nfind ~ -type d -mtime -1 > modified_folders.txt\n\non my terminal since I did the mistaken rm -rf today. The result of the find command, the changed folders (if you delete a file, Mac changes modified flag of it's direct folder parent) seems to not have a \"deep arbitrary\" structure like ~/Pictures/Personal/Birthday/2010/Cake... can I then assume rm -rf didn't touch the wrong files and I were able to stop the armageddon just by stopping rm -rf ~ after 1-2s (so it deleted just some of the hidden files on $HOME)?\n(I have already restarted my machine, it's working fine. I'm on Snow Leopard, so tmutil isn't a solution I think...)\n(I already know some solutions to recover like TestDisk exist, but I'm trying to use it as a last approach (if I'm wrong in my assumptions about the find snippet).\n\nA: There is no way to know for certain exactly which files were deleted. There's no list stored, no trash can, this is unix (well BSD) and you don't get any nice second chances with rm -rf\nAs you have seen though, you can infer what might have been deleted first by observing the rm command's behaviour.\nI created a folder with a few subfolders, including some with a period at the beginning of the name and threw a few files into each.\nThe order is always alphabetical with the hidden, period prefixed directories getting deleted first.\nIf you compare a backup with your directory structure, once you have moved through alphabetically and started to find files in the backup that are still on your main drive, I think you can rest assured that you haven't missed any other files.\n\nA: rm deletes the inode structure / directory entries without making a log. You would be saved if you have file auditing turned on, but that's not a default thing on Mac OS X.\nTo my take of the situation described, you have the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*engage an undelete software to attempt to find fragments of files or data that resembles file entries / inodes and filter those results for potential files modified in the time range of the rm.\n\n*compare the current directory structure with a recent backup (tmutil compare would be an ideal Lion tool, but you can use BackupLoupe or others if your backup is TimeMachine)\n\n\nA: \nIs there some place on the mac where all deleted files with rm -rf are kept (just the filenames)?\n\nAs others have already pointed out: no such place exists unless you happened to have your filesystem set up with auditing and snapshotting.\nHowever, you can use Time Machine to figure out what has changed. You were taking a regular Time Machine backup of your drive that held your home directory, right?\nIf so: open up Time Machine for your home directory and go back in time to just before you ran the rm. You should be able to see files that have changed or are missing. And even restore them. It's not a great view in to the system, but it'll do in a pinch.\n", "Q: Is kill -15 the same as File -> Quit? I want to quit a process but without force quitting it. Is that possible from the terminal?\n\nA: kill acts on Unix level, the targeted process is free to ignore any signal besides kill -9. And depending on the internal structure of the process you are looking at, kill -15 will not be the same as 'File->Quit'. \nAs an alternative you could do something like osascript -e 'tell application \"Safari\" to quit'. \n", "Q: Downgrade pre-installed Lion to Snow Leopard on a 2011 Macbook Pro? I have very recently purchased a Macbook Pro pre-installed with Lion.  After spending several days unsuccessfully trying to get it to play nicely with Active Directory I purchased a retail copy of Snow Leopard, booted it from an external DVD drive (wouldn't read the disc) erased the HDD and attempted to install Snow Leopard.  No go.  Forums suggest it cannot be done. I now have a blank HDD.\nHas anyone successfully downgraded from Lion to Snow Leopard on a pre-installed Lion system?  If so, can you give instructions or point me in the direction of how to do this please?\n\nA: I'm not sure if this will work in your case. But I have a 2010 MacBook Pro I cannot install the retail copy of Snow Leopard onto. That retail disc is 10.6.3, and the laptop needs a higher version. \nTo overcome this, I installed Snow Leopard on an external drive connected to an older Mac. I then updated Snow Leopard to 10.6.8 and copied the contents of that drive back to my MacBook Pro via SuperDuper.\nNow, in your case, I'm not sure if Snow Leopard will work at all on the recent MacBook Pro. But, if you have access to an older Mac, give my solution a try.\n\nA: Although in general running an older OS than what ships is not something that works, during the transition there is often more leeway for the drivers needed to be in a late enough version\nSince you just bought a retail version of the OS - call Apple immediately and ask if they can assist to see if they need to ship a different build to you at no cost. (You usually have to pay if you lose a disc, but in this case, if the mac supports Snow Leopard there may be an install disc for that specific model or a newer pressing of the DVD may be the only thing you need.)\n\nYou can also research it here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X versions (builds) for computers\n\n*Key in your serial number here - http://support.apple.com/manuals/\n\n*Finding your Mac OS X version and build information\nChances are you have an Early 2011 model MacBook Pro, but it pays to be sure by running the serial number (and even that can be wrong - but Apple support can help in that case...)\nIf my guess is correct, you just need 10.6.6 and a build of 10J3210 or newer. I haven't seen a retail Snow Leopard disc that is newer than 10.6.3 Build 10D575 so you may need a newer build to get going. \nArmed with this information, you now can understand why \"Retail copies of Mac OS X may not always work properly with new Macs\" Do call Apple Care and see if they can and will get you a machine specific build since you are a paying customer :-)\n\nA: Walter, this excellent page is the solution I will be using on my recently purchased hexacore Mac Pro:\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/downgradeyourmac/the-procedure\nHope this helps anyone else who is in a similar position!\n\nA: You can do it fairly easily via target disk mode if you have another Mac running 10.6.8. \nYou need:\n- OS X 10.6 retail disc\n- OS X combo update 10.6.8\n- firewire cable (400/800) depending on the mac you're using to target the machine you want to downgrade\nConnect the computers via firewire cable, hold down \"T\" on the computer you wish to downgrade while starting up. There should be a firewire icon on the screen of the downgrading computer, so you know it's connected properly.\nFrom there, format the hard drive in the computer you wish to downgrade - you should be able to select it using Disk Utility. Make sure there's 1 partition and format it. Then, insert your Snow Leopard retail disk and install it on the freshly formatted hard drive.\nOnce Snow Leopard is done installing, it will restart and boot up using the freshly downgraded computer's hard drive. From there, you can install the Mac OS X 10.6.8. combo update - either have it already downloaded and on a USB drive, or you can download it from apple's site. Once that installs, you should be able to disconnect the computers and boot normally into Snow Leopard on the early 2011 MBP.\nIt worked perfectly for me. Good luck.\n", "Q: Printing the current date/time with sub-second precision GNU date(1) understands the %N format spec, which outputs nanoseconds, so:\n$ date +%H:%m:%S.%N\n\noutputs 19:10:03.725196000\nBSD date doesn't understand %N. How can I print the current time with sub-second precision on OS X?\n\nA: As you said, BSD date doesn't support %N. So the straightforward solution is to download GNU's date and install it to either ~/bin or /usr/local/bin and call that when you need to use %N.\nHowever, I would not advise replacing the version that ships with your Mac with the new one. Most of these coreutil programs are written such that their output can be understood by other programs, not necessarily humans, so reliability in output is a necessity. There might be several scripts in your mac that parse the output of BSD's date and any possible changes introduced by replacing with GNU's might or might not break things.\n\nThe simplest way to do this safely on a Mac is to use homebrew and install coreutils.\nbrew info coreutils\ncoreutils 8.16\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils\n...   \n==> Caveats\nAll commands have been installed with the prefix 'g'.\n\nThe GNU equivalent will be named gdate and is located in /usr/local/Cellar/coreutils/8.16/bin/. You can also set an alias in your .bashrc or its equivalent as \nalias date='gdate'\n\n\nA: Use python. It's built into macOS, so you don't need to install additional software!\npython -c 'import datetime; print datetime.datetime.now()'\n\nIf you want the output to be formatted differently, take a look at https://stackoverflow.com/a/18944849/6358721\n", "Q: Display Issues for Early 2011 Macbook Pro I am currently experiencing an undocumented problem for my 15 inch Macbook Pro (Early 2011 Version), and was hoping to get some help diagnosing what the issue might be. \nThe problem is that whenever I am doing anything that is computationally expensive (i.e. streaming video or using parallel processing in MATLAB), my screen goes haywire and shows up noisy green lines on anything that is supposed to black. Similarly I get noisy light blue lines on anything that is supposed to be white. The problem is hard to describe, so here is a picture of my screen when this happens:\n\nChanging the color profile does not change anything. Taking a screenshot does not change anything. Also, the issue seems to pop up regardless of whether or not I have the onboard graphics card enabled.I am fairly certain that is a hardware issue, but I would appreciate any input in regards to finding out what it may be. I have an appointment coming up at the local Mac store, but I'm almost dreading going in since I do not want to have to send the computer in for repair.\nUPDATE: After running the tests you suggested, I was able to nail down the issue to the GFX card instead of the screen. In order to be sure, I downloaded the gfxCardStatus app from Macupdate and ran a quick experiment to see what happened when I I switch from the ATI Graphics Card to the Integrated Intel Graphics Card. As it turns out, the weird behavior only occurs when the ATI Graphics Card were in use, and switching to the Intel Graphics Card resolved the issue. I'm still headed to the Apple Store tomorrow, but I think this will help expedite the repair process :) \n\nA: This is almost certainly a hardware problem.  To determine whether it's the screen or the graphics card/motherboard you can plug in an external monitor.  If you get the same problem on the external monitor then it's likely a fault with the graphics card/motherboard, if you don't get the same issue on the external screen then there's a problem with your MacBook's display.  \nSince it's an early 2011 model it should still be in warranty.  I'd bring it to an Apple store and have it checked out for repair or replacement.  On the plus side, you may get a brand new MacBook out of it.\n\nA: It'a an old thread, but right now Apple have repair program for Macbooks 2011-2013 which have video card problems. Details can be found here.\n\nApple has determined that a small percentage of MacBook Pro systems may exhibit distorted video, no video, or unexpected system restarts. These MacBook Pro systems were sold between February 2011 and December 2013.\nApple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider will repair affected MacBook Pro systems, free of charge.\n\n", "Q: How can I force an app to uninstall? I just installed an app that was a waste of my time. The problem is, when I long-pressed the app to delete it, it didn't show an (x).  How can I delete it?  I've looked through the settings.  I'm kind of new to iPods so if this is simple, just say it bluntly.\n\nA: You open up Cydia>Manage and then delete the app. Enjoy!\n", "Q: Does saving photos on iPad from Photo Stream save the full resolution? When saving photos from the Photo Stream to the Camera Roll, is the full resolution picture stored? \nI ask this because the the Apple FAQ states that iDevices only get an \"optimized\" resolution (approx 3MP) whereas PC/Mac gets the original full resolution picture. However, it also states that you can permanently save a picture on the device by copying it to an album. It seems that if the picture that is saved is not full resolution, then saving it permanently on the iPad does not make much sense, as it would be better to save it only on the PC.\n\nA: All photos on Photo Stream are stored in the cloud in full resolution.  When they are pushed to an iPhone, iPad, iPod touch or Apple TV, they are downsized to make the best use of bandwidth available to those devices.  So when you save a photo which was taken by another device from Photo Stream to your iPad's Camera Roll, it doesn't receive the full resolution photo.  \nHowever, if you take a photo with an iPad (or iPhone/iPod Touch), you will have a full resolution version of the photo in Camera Roll.  You will also have a full resolution photo pushed to Photo Stream and on any Mac or PC which is synced with that Photo Stream account and a downsized version on any other iOS devices synced with that account also.  \nFrom Apple Support:\n\nOn your Mac or PC, your photos are downloaded and stored in full\n  resolution. On your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Apple TV, your Photo\n  Stream photos are delivered in a device-optimized resolution that\n  speeds downloads and saves storage space.

She went to play a white noise app through the dock connector connected to a Sony ICF-C1iPMKZ.  It plays through the Sony clock until the auto-lock is triggered.  Is there any way to keep it playing through the dock connector when the screen locks?  It use to do this before the iOS 5 upgrade.\n\nA: This is a problem I had with my app as well. Since iOS 5 an app is paused as if you had hit the home button when the screen locks. Unless the developer of the app in question adopts background audio, there isn't anything you can do.\nMy recommendation would be to find a few mp3s to relax, since Apple's music app runs just fine even if the screen is locked.\n", "Q: How do I enable Wi-Fi-only email push? Is it possible to get iOS's email push feature to work only when I'm on Wi-Fi?\n\nA: As far as I know, not with the stock options. You may be able to do this on a jailbroken phone if there's a jailbreak community app for that. Short of that, you'd have to make one yourself.\nOtherwise, you're down to changing these settings manually when you're away from WiFi.\n", "Q: App to replace some of my acronyms I saw a video at some point recent.  In the video, the guy had an app that would replace certain phrases with other phrases. \nExample: \nI type \"afaik\" and it replaces it with \"as far as I know\".\nMy iPod is a gen2 running iOS v4.x and jailbroken.\n\nA: The most prominent app would by TextExpander, available for Mac OS and iOS. Another alternative would be Typinator only Mac OS.\nAnother option (on iOS 5) would be shortcuts (Settings -> General -> Keyboard). You can add shortcuts and replacements as in your example. This is probably the best solutions as it is free and works in all apps. (TextExpander works only in some, that explicitly support it.) \n", "Q: How can I change the OS X Lion Glossy Dock Notifications/Badges? Is there a way to change the little glossy dock notification icons that have been changed from their pleasant form pre Lion to a glossy style badge like iOS?\nAn example would be the incremented indicator that notifies you of how many unread emails you have in the Mail application. It displays in the dock.\n\nA: I'm not sure if I understand the problem without seeing a screenshot, but you can change the dock appearance to use the classic flat Dock style instead of the 3D glass style.\nPaste this into a Terminal window and press return:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean true && killall Dock\n\nI much prefer the flat look myself. The glass shelf is so tacky.\n\nA: I don't think he is asking about the 3D reflectiveness of the dock. He is asking about the dock icon badges (like the unread count on Mail.app). Lion changed to a glossy style badge like iOS, but it used to be flat looking. From what I can tell, this can't be changed. You might want to try sending feedback to Apple if you dislike it.\n\nA: I like this site (secrets.blacktree.com). It's community driven. The site offer hundreds of tweaks which you can copy and/or use their preference pane (secrets).\nOf course, use at your own risk, and know how to reverse an effect before you activate it. A number of items are greyed out as new information is being generated for 10.7\nHowever, from their site, their recommendation to your specific question is:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -float\n\nThen logout/login.

I noticed that there is a setting under Phone > My Number which displays my phone number. What does changing this setting do, and why would someone want to do that?\nIs there any Apple documentation that explains the feature?\n\nA: It changes your number everywhere on your iPhone (That is, it doesn't change your number on the SIM or the network). \nAn example where your number is used is under contacts in your phone app. If you scroll to the very top it displays the number you've set in the preferences. So really, it doesn't change much.\n\nA: It seems to not do much when you are in the US with a standard phone plan. Whenever I change it, it's only a temporary change. It gets reset back to my real phone number after a minute or so.\nThe only change it seems to have is, as voidStern said, in the Phone > Contacts app: it just displays your phone number on the top.\nIf I go into Settings > FaceTime, it shows my original phone number there grayed out, and it says \"Verifying\". The same exact thing happens in Settings > Messages > Receive At. After a minute, it will no longer say verifying. When this happens, it means that the phone number was reset. You can verify this by going back to the Settings > Phone > My Number setting.\nIf I enable Airplane mode right after changing the number, it freezes the number change (so it doesn't get reset automatically), but the FaceTime and Messages settings are also frozen on the verifying stage. Even if I enable Wi-Fi the phone number doesn't get reset. Note that after disabling Airplane mode, it took a little longer to reset the phone number, about 3 minutes.\nI couldn't find any documentation about it in the iPhone User Guide. However, I did find a few posts on Apple's forms which mention this setting and why you may want to change it. One of them mentions that it changes the number on the Sim card; the other seems to fix a problem when porting over a new number to your carrier.\n\nA: I have done it before myself (manually changed my number under settings > iPhone) it grayed out my number everywhere else it was displayed on my phone, and when I would look at it back on settings > iPhone it would say \"verifying.\" This only lasted for about a minute and a half. The number reset itself to my real number, and it appeared correctly back in all the other places it's displayed on my phone too. I did this about seven months ago, and my phone works with no problems to this day, it didn't change anything permanently. \n", "Q: Is there any way to change the snooze time for alarms on the iPhone? It seems that the default snooze time for alarms is 9 minutes. Is there any way I can change this setting?\n\nA: There's no obvious way to change the snooze interval for the built-in iOS alarm. However, there are a few free apps available from iTunes App Store that offer this functionality:\n\n\n*\n\n*Theme Clock Alarm: Snooze timer configuration (up to 60 minutes)\n\n*Alarmed: offer multiple snooze timings - Drop-down panel for easy access to key features, including Nag-Me, snoozing options...\n\nA: An alternative to the alarm app are CalAlarm and Snooze Me.

Both turn your work computer into an Airplay destination, so you can stream audio directly from your iPhone to your computer. This lets you play music from your iPhone without worrying about syncing, copying songs, etc. \nOn the Mac, there's the open source app called Airmac. And on Windows, you can try the application Shairport. Both do the same thing, and turn your computer into an Airplay destination.\nOnce you have turned on one of these apps, start playing a song from your iPhone. If everything is on the same network, you should see the Airplay icon (shown here in the lower right, the rectangle + triangle). Tap that, you should see your computer listed, tap that, and then your phone will stream the iTunes audio to your computer.\n\n", "Q: Disable / Uninstall Mail app in Lion I'm running Sparrow mail client and would love to disable Mail.app, which keeps opening from time to time.\n\nA: You could try selecting the Mail icon in the Applications folder, select Get Info (⌘I), and under permissions, set Everyone to no access. That should prevent the program from launching.\n\nA: From Apple Support, the steps to switch to a different mail reader are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Mail (/Applications/Mail)\n\n*From the Mail menu, choose Preferences\n\n*Click the General button\n\n*Choose your desired default email application from the \"Default email reader\" pop-up menu.\n\n\nThis article also provides instructions to change the default mail app by editing the appropriate plist configuration.\nTo change the default email application, use Webmailer.

(\"Device has been jailbroken.\") I figured that work>jailbreaking (duh) and restored my iPad. I tried to open Bloomberg once more, and it said \"Device has been jailbroken.\"\nWhat does jailbreaking do that is irreparably detectable?\n\nA: As far as I know, only iBooks has the power to truly block a jailbroken device. It does this by writing an unsigned executable to the root of the system. If the device is locked (not jailbroken) it can't run. But if the device is jailbroken the executable is run and iBooks quits (crashes). But this is Apple's proprietary app and third party software isn't given this level of control. In fact, all third party apps are sandboxed and can't touch anything outside of their respective installation directory.\nSo what it's it looking for? Rumors claim it looks for Cydia. But again, that would require the app have access to the system as Cydia isn't installed in your user's installation directory (/private/var/mobile/Applications) but rather at the system root \n(/private/var/stash/Applications). And even if that were true, it would mean that once you wipe your jailbreak, it should work as expected. In this case, that doesn't look to be the case (unless it has saved the device state in the app's preferences).\nBut there is still one file that maybe it can access:\n/private/var/mobile/Library/Preferences/com.saurik.cydia.plist\nAdditionally, this file is carried along with your backups whether the device is jailbroken or not once it has been created.\nEither that or the app simply queried your device's state when jailbroken and has saved that information, carrying it over even after you removed the jailbreak (as mentioned above). However, if you've uninstalled and reinstalled the app after the jailbreak, then you needn't worry about that. But if you have any preference files left over from the jailbreak, you might have to clear them out. Either re-jailbreak and remove them via ssh or reinstall iOS but choose rather than setting up your device using a backup, start clean.\nThis doesn't look like the only app that checks for a jailbreak. Time Warner Cable and Skype both have a history of doing this. Unfortunately still no credible information on how they achieve this. Since they are bound to restrictive APIs like all third party apps in the App Store, I don't think it's all that sophisticated.\n\nA: There are many ways to identify a computer/device. For example, your MAC address or UUID may have been blacklisted. \n\nA: Im not sure if this is what is happening in your particular case however, as part of the JailBrake the 'hosts' file is altered so that the device will not contact apple for updates rather the JailBrake update site. I would search for articles which discuss how to reset the hosts file.\n", "Q: Is there an iPad app that lets me program animations? I've started using my iPad for my lectures (giving them, not listening to them) and it's working Just Fine ( Is there a PDF annotation app for the iPad with minimal (or no!) annoying page transitions?).  But I want more.\nSometimes, I like to have a little animation to demonstrate something, such as a pendulum under different conditions (friction, coupling, that sort of thing).  Prior to using my iPad, I wrote these using processing which is a set of Java libraries that make it easy to write the sort of thing that I want.  It has the bonus that I can export the programs as java applets to put on the web.\nI'd like to be able to do this on the iPad.  Since it doesn't support Java, I can't just run the applets in a web browser (which would be the easiest).  So I need a different system.  Initially, I thought that this was a hopeless task since programming directly on the iPad seemed not possible.\nBut then I ran across iLuaBox, Luna, and PyPad which seem to suggest that it is possible to have a limited programming environment on the iPad.\nBut searching for programming stuff on the App Store is fairly tricky as one gets a whole host of books on the topic and things that turn out to be just text editors (and searching for it off the App Store just turns up stuff about programming for the iPad).  And I'd like to get a sense of all that's out there before experimenting since it seems certain that I'll have to learn a new programming language (and I'm no programmer).\nSo what apps are there that would allow me to write a simple graphical animation program?\nA pendulum is a good example of what would be needed.  It should:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have basic graphical capabilities: \"draw a pendulum of length l at angle alpha\"\n\n*Be able to do basic maths: \"the position of the pendulum at time t+h is computed from its position and velocity at time t by applying Newton's Laws\"\n\n*Have basic programming capabilities: loops, conditionals, variables, and so forth.\n\n\nOne that I have found that would seem to have all of that is this one.  I have to admit that the temptation to write my animations on an iPad using CBM64 BASIC is very strong (plus it doesn't have such a steep learning curve as, say, Lua since once long ago I used to program in BASIC on a CBM64), but if there's something a little more practical then I might just find the strength to resist.\n\nA: You may want to take a look at Codify. It's meant for creating games, but it should do animations just fine.\n", "Q: Change PHP $PATH setting?

But I'd like which is the best configuration I should go for? \nIs it necessary to have a dedicated graphics card? Because I was looking at cheaper options like the 13' ones which only have integrated graphics memory.\n\nA: Unless you're planning on working with an external monitor I'd always go at least with 15\" Pro or the 13\" Air. Both are fine machines for coding iPhone apps. Working in Xcode on an 13\" Pro (1280x800) is doable, but rather unpleasant. \nIf it'll be your only machine I would recommend the 15\" MBP, as you might need Photoshop (or similar) for UI design. At that point you would notice the weaker CPU and graphics in the Air or 13\" MBP.\n", "Q: Is there a iOS5 bug regarding the video app forgetting at which time a video has to be resume? After upgrading my iPhone 4 to iOS 5 I recognized, whenever I close a movie mid-play by clicking Done and selecting it again, it will just restart and not remember where it was before.\nThis was remembered in the previous iOS release when videos where still located in the Music app.\nThe videos were not purchased through iTunes but converted from avi with ffmpeg (just to be complete).\nIs this a known issue?\n\nA: No - this general behavior wasn't changed in iOS 5 as part of the video / music app split. \n\nA: It is a regression in IOS 5.0 and 5.0.1 as video can not be resumed from the paused position. There is a workaround to temporarily fix the issue:\nFirstly you should copy a video to your iTunes library.\nAfter that copy it from \"Films\" in your iTunes library to your device.\nVoila, now you can watch your movie, pause it, do something else, and after returning back it will resume from the last position. \n", "Q: Issues with 2nd gen iPod touch I have a 2nd gen iPod touch (bought around 3 years back)...Off late, I am facing some issues with it; Date/Time gets reset on a few ocassions even though I charge it regularly (mostly seems to be a battery issue)\nBut the major issue is with AppStore downloads.

This way you will be able to rectify software problems.\nThen you may try to restore iPod in Recovery mode.\nIf it will not help then it is either network issue or you do try to install iOS4+ only apps.\nMore on restore process.\n", "Q: Disable mounting Internal Macintosh HD at boot My iMac (mid-2010 model, Snow Leopard) has a problem with S.M.A.R.T status: Failing and it has become read-only. Because I didn't want to waste money on the repair, I bought an external HD, so the internal HD is now unnecessary.

For a company, in order to be able to publish an app for iPhone/iPad to the App Store what hardware does it need to register?\nI know that you need to register your development devices. What is the minimum that you need to register? Is a MacBook Air enough? Or do you also need to register an iPhone, iPad? \nI am just starting and I prefer to test it on friends devices, as I don't have the money to buy them now...\n\nA: Technically, the submission of apps and music and books happens over a web page, so you don't need any Mac hardware to publish the end results of your creative work.\nFor iOS, the Xcode tools run only on Macs, so you simply need to pick a version of Xcode and find a mac that meets the minimum specs. Pretty much any mac made in the last 5 years is good enough. Do make sure the mac will run Lion as you won't want to be stuck on Xcode 3 for long. You do not need to have any iOS devices to submit an app to the App store.\nHowever, having iOS devices is highly encouraged for testing and development, but you don't need one for publication. Testing on actual devices is very important for a quality app as there's no replacement for getting the gestures and the UI tweaked on a real device. Plus, the simulator isn't quite a perfect simulation, especially when it comes to memory, so you may miss bugs you would otherwise find on an iOS device. Apple will surely run your app on several devices and you will lose time and perhaps not be approved if you ship apps that run fine in the simulator, but not so well on real devices.\nThe simulator runs Intel Processor code, the devices run ARM code - so your one code project gets built into two apps - you only submit the iOS app for approval / distribution and it's better for you to test that exact build and find the bugs yourself rather then when the app is under review.\n\nA: Realistically, you need an Intel Mac, the cheapest possible one will do, and access to at least 1 to 3 iOS devices.  One device for the current OS release, one device running the OS release of the oldest OS you plan on supporting, and perhaps one dedicated test device for doing beta OS app testing.  If you want to do Universal apps, at least 1 iPad and one non-iPad, as there are many things that can't be fully tested on the iOS Simulator.\nGoing forward, a Mac that can run Lion may end up being required to keep up with the latest SDK frameworks, codesigning tools and app submission tools.\nYou need to register any iOS devices that you want to use for app testing.  They don't need to belong to you or your company.  Multiple developers can register the same shared devices.  \nYou don't need to \"register\" any Macs.  You do need to create and/or copy private keys and certificates to each Mac that you want to use for device testing development or app store submission.\nUnrealistically, you could get by with none.  No devices or owned Macs are required.  (There are online tools that will pretty much construct an entire native app Xcode project.)  Have a friend or consultant with a Mac get your certificates and do the final codesigning; and let your customers be your beta testers.  But the latter could easily lead to apps that get rejected or that crash for most of your customers.  And the non-Mac development tools all have various (some severe) deficiencies.\n", "Q: How to install a .qtz screensaver in Lion? What are the instructions to install a .qtz screensaver in Lion?\n\nA: Move it into ~/Library/Screen Savers if you are the only one who wants to use it, or into /Library/screen Savers if you want all users on the machine to have access to it (note ~/Library is hidden by default in Lion: you can access it by holding Option when clicking the “Go To” menu in Finder).\n", "Q: Best Camera setup for iPad Demonstration need to do a live demo of an ipad app to be shown on a projector.  tried using a flip cam but there is a ton of reflection / glare.  i've seen folks put the ipad on what looks like an overhead projector with a camera attached to the top, so the ipad sits flat on the table area and the camera is on an arm above it pointing down.\nanyone know what this setup is or what type of camera is used and where to get it?\nthanks!\n\nA: First, you need to soft your light source by using light softener or light diffusor.

The current iTunes Plus feature will replace selected purchased iTunes tracks with a 256-Kbps AAC DRM-free version. The soon to be released iTunes Match (for iCloud users) will store all tracks (including ripped tracks that Apple can match) in the cloud as 256-Kbps AAC DRM-free versions. Does that mean that Match replaces Plus?\nSpecifically, if I'm planning to sign up for Match once it launches, is there any reason do any Plus upgrades now, or should I simply wait for Match.\n\nA: iTunes Match, when turned on, actually suppresses the Store link for iTunes Plus in the iTunes app on a Mac or PC.  The option to upgrade no longer appears to Match subscribers.  There is no reason to upgrade.  My personal old-school drm-sullied iTunes songs are now available to me without DRM through Match now that I've subscribed and synced my library.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by replace. But let's have a look.\niTunes Plus is a designator for DRM-free 256kbps tracks. iTunes Match is a fee based service that provide you with said tracks.\niTunes Plus tracks are available in many markets. AFAIK iTunes Match is going to be US only at launch.\nMy answer is no, it's not a replacement.\n\nA: iTunes Plus is the moniker for high-end (256 Kbps AAC), DRM-free tracks. Several years ago, Apple stopped serving the traditional 192 Kbps songs that were locked down using FairPlay (Apple's DRM schema). Apple not only began releasing all new content using this new system, but also replacing the old content. So, for marketing sake, they had to give it a name (to differentiate between the old 192 Kbps songs and the new DRM-free 256 Kbps): enter iTunes Plus.\nAs is the Apple way, to bolster its use and cement the new order, it offered to replace all your old content with these new tracks (for a nominal fee). This meant customers could eventually remove all their old DRM, low quality tracks over time. \niTunes Match is a new service designed to move all your music to iCloud, so it can be shared among all your devices seamlessly. It works by \"matching\" your current content with the stuff available in the iTunes Store, wether or not your purchased it from Apple. For example, if you ripped a CD and the songs are available in iTunes, Apple will replace it with their version for you. If its not available, your songs get uploaded and stores for future use. \nThe songs it replaces them with are all high-end, DRM-free, 256 Kbps (so iTunes Plus).\niTunes Plus is the mark of the song's quality, while iTunes Match is a new service meant to store all your music in the cloud. They are two very different things and in no way linked. \n", "Q: How can I screen share into a remote coworker's Mac? I have a coworker who should do some testing on a Mac but is a Windows user who has no desire to learn the Mac.

What do I do next? After a forced shutdown, my white MacBook hangs at the gray screen with the Apple logo and an infinitely spinning progress wheel.\nI can boot in verbose mode, but I didn't see any particular error, just a timeout (I can provide the verbose text, but I'm at work and my Mac is at home).\nI can't boot into single-user mode. It just sits at a similar point as the verbose mode.\nI booted off my Snow Leopard install DVD. It took nearly 10 minutes! Once it got the install screens, I ran Disk Utility. It sees the internal hard drive. It sees the partition. Info on the partition shows that it is an HFS partition. But, it's grayed out and unmounted. If you click \"Mount\" it says that it cannot be mounted - run First Aid.\n\"Verify\" runs for about 8-10 minutes, shows messages for each step, no errors, and then says Verify has passed. Still won't mount. \"Repair\" runs for about as long, shows no errors, shows no repairs. Still won't mount. Grrr.\nI hooked up an external drive and created an Image of the drive. This took hours. Completed with no errors. I then tried to mount the disk image (.dmg). It ran a full Verify (I don't know how long - I fell asleep). It Verified, but said it couldn't be mounted and suggested I run First Aid. Verify passed. Repair is grayed out. Won't mount.\nWhat should I do next?

Any other utilities (particularly free ones) to try? Bootable Linux utilities?\nAlso, assuming file-system corruption, could my external disk image be processed by disk utilities just as easily as the hard drive? In other words, if I erased my hard drive and repartitioned and reinstalled the OS, would I be any worse off in regards to maybe recovering files if I just deal with the external Image? \nOtherwise, I'll probably replace the internal drive, reinstall, then but the internal drive in an external SATA-to-USB enclosure and work on it from there...\n\nA: When this happens to me, I've found that resetting the PRAM/NVRAM often works.  (Sometimes it takes a couple restarts to see any results.)\nAlso, if you haven't already done so, take a look at Apple's troubleshooting steps for this problem.\n\nA: I did put my mac book pro's disk on a case, the from another mac I erased all the /System/Library/Extension/AMD*.

For a time, I though that perhaps the older image, on the machines we were migrating from, is to blame.  However, I see these sorts of issues using a freshly installed version of Leopard on both machines, either 10.5.0, or 10.5.8.\nIf I use the Setup Assistant (which occurs at first boot) to try to migrate files, it will claim that the other computer does not have Mac OS X installed.  (Sorry, I don't have the exact wording handy).\n[Incidentally, if no one has an answer, have other people managed to migrate users from Leopard to Leopard successfully?  I could swear we've done it in the past, but I haven't been able to reproduce it!]\n\n*: I am assuming this question fits here better than at serverfault, because it is a procedure regular users can perform.\n\nA: Yes, i'm the IT Manager for an Ad Agency using mostly Macs, and i've done it all, 10.4-10.7 and it's almost never a problem.

Then plug the old one in target disk mode, and just copy the folders from the user profile over one at a time.\nIt's not the same as a migrate, but it will get you there.\nAs for Applejack, i've always ran it twice, the first time as Applejack AUTO restart.

If you sell your Apple-branded hardware to a third party, you must remove the Apple Software from the Apple- branded hardware before doing so, and you may restore your system to the version of the Apple operating system software that originally came with your Apple hardware (the “Original Apple OS”) and permanently transfer the Original Apple OS together with your Apple hardware, provided that: (i) the transfer must include all of the Original Apple OS, including all its component parts, printed materials and its license; (ii) you do not retain any copies of the Original Apple OS, full or partial, including copies stored on a computer or other storage device; and (iii) the party receiving the Original Apple OS reads and agrees to accept the terms and conditions of the Original Apple OS license.\n\nIf you sell your computer, and it didn't ship with Lion, but rather you upgraded it via the Mac App Store, you are not allowed to transfer your copy of Lion to the new owner. You are told to re-install the operating system that shipped with your computer, which, in this case, should be Leopard or earlier. So you can't downgrade to Snow Leopard, because you've transferred your rights to that operating system to someone else.\nAll in all, if you want to be sure, seek legal advice from a competent lawyer, but from a layman's reading of this, it sounds legitimate to me to sell SL once you've upgraded to Lion.\n\nA: Technically, there is nothing preventing you from using a single-user copy on more than one computer at the same time. The system is the same as if you had purchased a family pack. What you are actually paying for is the license. The single-user license states that it can be used on one computer at any given time, while the family license can be used on more than one computer. This means that, once you upgrade to Lion, you can install Snow Leopard on a different computer without breaking the license agreement. The license also allows you to transfer ownership to a different person, which means you can sell the disk and they can install it on their computer. However, if your hard drive fails and you don't have a backup or recovery drive, you will need to purchase either another copy of Snow Leopard or a Lion installer, since you won't be able to download it again.\n", "Q: How do you edit the favorites list on Lion finder? Dragging in and out doesn't seem to be working for me, but I can see the ones I dragged in there before I upgraded:\n\n\nA: You should still be able to drag items on to the sidebar. To remove them either right/command(⌘)-click and select Remove from Sidebar or drag while holding ⌘.\n\nA: I don't think you can drag folders out anymore (to prevent accidental deletions), but if you right click you should have a \"remove from sidebar\" item in the context menu.\n\nA: Command/drag works for me - as does the right click.\n", "Q: Prevent dictionary from coming up in Lion On Lion, a three finger double tap brings up the dictionary.

Can I have some definitive answers? Also, what are you forced to do on a Windows machine that is not required on a Mac?\n\nA: A Mac is licensed to run some Apple software that is not licensed to run on non-Mac hardware.  Other than that, they are both Turing-complete computational engines that can emulate any other computational engine given enough time and memory.\n\nA: It can be taken to the Genius Bar at an Apple store for diagnosis and cure.\nIt entitles one to purchase AppleCare, which includes unlimited telephone support for the duration of the contract.\nIt can connect to Thunderbolt peripherals.\nIt can survive a user tripping over its power cord, because the power cord is held in place on the machine by a magnet rather than by friction.\nIt can legally run both Lion and Windows 7.\n", "Q: How does one a base a podcast playlist off of release date? I'd like to be able to make a playlist that is all recently released podcasts.\nUnfortunately release date is not a field available for selection in a smart playlist in iTunes.\nSimilar-ish dates like date added and modified date won't be close to release date when downloading the back-catalogue of newly added podcast.\nThe best solution I've come up with is to close itunes, truncate the iTunes Library.itl file, copy the release date field values in the iTunes Music Library.xml file into the date added field, and then relaunch iTunes, and letting it rebuild the itl file from the xml file. \nHowever, my library file is large enough that the rebuild takes 20-30 min, and even with no hacking of the xml, fails more often than not.\nIs there a method for me to either or both of: \n\n\n*\n\n*hack the itl file to set the date added to the release date?\n\n*be able to select the release date either in rules for a smart playlist or the \"limit to... selected by\" dropdown of a smart playlist?\n\n\nA: I'm not much of an AppleScripter, so this is modified from some scripts at Doug's AppleScripts website, but it's GPLed, so derivative works are allowed as long as they're also GPLed.\nMy idea was to make a script that could take the release date, which can't be used in smart playlists, and store it in the last skipped date, which can be used in smart playlists. If you just want to do this for podcasts (not for songs, for which you might actually use the last skipped field), just select your podcasts before running this script.\nOnce you do that, you can create a smart playlist selected on the \"Last skipped\" field to get the recently released podcasts.\n\nSo here we go:\n (*\n You can rename this script to whatever you want\n but please keep this information intact.

I like how Lion gathers everything in All My Files.\nI often use it to download and post pictures without thinking where exactly they are saved (Desktop, Downloads, whatever).\nHowever it really annoys me that Music is displayed above Pictures, and therefore I have to go through my entire music library just to get to the pics.\n\nI'd love to completely remove Music from All My Files because it only messes up the organization and doesn't help at all. Is this possible?\n\nA: Given that the results of “All My Files” smart search respects Spotlight Preference Pane's search results, if you uncheck or drag music below pictures, that order is respected.\nI infer this, because I have music disabled in Spotlight and I don't see music in my “All My Files”.\nI see PDF, Images, Spreadsheets, Developer and Documents (in that order). Which more or less mirrors what I have in my Spotlight: (considering that the canned search doesn't look for contacts, apps, etc.) \n\nYou will need to log off and on again for changes to take effect.\nNOTE: I don't use All My Files anyway, I have it removed from my finder Sidebar\n\nA: All My Files is basically a Smart Folder with a custom icon, prepositioned in the Finder sidebar. So you can easily change or replicate its functionality to suit your purposes.\nYou can either make a new Smart Folder (⌥⌘N or File→New Smart Folder) and add it to your Finder sidebar, or right click on All My Files and choose Edit Search Criteria. While testing this, the editing seemed a bit buggy, so I'd suggest making a new Smart Folder instead.\nWhichever way you choose, you want to edit the search parameters to match this screenshot:\n\nTo get the second and third lines, option-click on the \"+\", it will turn into \"…\" and give you the advanced options.\nTo get the sorting in a new folder to match that of All My Files, goto View→Arrange by→Kind (or of course set it however you prefer).\n\nA: The All My Files search appears to be saved at /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Resources/MyLibraries/myDocuments.cannedSearch.  One should always be cautious modifying System files, but one might be able to modify the search query in this file to exclude Music files.\n\n", "Q: How can I identify the chipset of an (old) MacBook? I am not a mac person, but I am trying to buy a used MacBook for XCode purposes and I want to figure out how much RAM it can take. However, I am having trouble identifying the chipset in the MacBook. \nThe computer is listed as being a May, 2007 white MacBook with a 2.4Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo processor.\nI found a FAQ online which states states that there are two Intel chipsets which this MacBook could have, the Calistoga chipset which supports up to 3.3Gb of RAM or the Crestline which supports up to 4Gb (maybe 6Gb). Then it states that, \"To find out which C2D MacBook you have you can check the FSB clock or the GPU: If you have a 667 MHz FSB and a GMA 950 you have a Calistoga C2D MB. If you have a 800 MHz FSB and a GMA X3100 you have a Crestline C2D MacBook.\"\nHowever, the specs listed for the computer do not match either of these descriptions. For the GPU, it states \n\"Video\nGraphic Processor:  Intel Graphics Media Accelerator (GMA) X3100\nInstalled Video Memory: 64 MB,\" which would imply that it uses the Crestline chipset and can support 4Gb RAM. However, for the mobo FSB it states \"Motherboard Bus Speed:   667 MHz,\" which would imply that it is a Calistoga board which only supports 3.3Gb of RAM. \nI attempted to look up the exact computer to see the specs on everymac.com, but I was unable to find the correct model. Every listing for a white 2007 MacBook on that website said it had the GMA950 GPU, not the X3100. Additionally, the computer for sale says it has a 2.4Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo processor (there is a picture of the \"About this Mac\" window) and that isn't listed as an available option for any 2007 MacBook.  (Since the specs are automatically generated based on the date the seller enters, perhaps it is not actually a May 2007 MacBook? I don't know if macs are overclockable but it is definitely running at 2.4Ghz)\nThe RAM is definitely 667Mhz DDR2, as that is listed in the same picture from the actual computer screen as the processor speed. The hard drive was upgraded by the user and thus cannot be used for identification purposes. The computer is running Lion. Can anyone provide any assistance in identifying which chipset is in this MacBook?\nTo clarify: If the specs generated based on the May 2007 date are wrong, the only specs I know for certain are that it has a 2.4Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo processor and it currently has 2 GB 667Mhz DDR2 SDRAM, because these are shown in the screenshot. However, the seller says he upgraded the RAM himself, and that it initially came with only 1Gb of RAM.\n\nA: The first MacBook to fully support 4GB of RAM (with unofficial support for up to 6GB) was the MacBook (13-inch Late 2007). This was also the first MacBook to feature a 800MHz FSB and the GMA X3100 graphics chip.\nI'd be interested to know where you're getting your system specs from, but I'd suspect that somewhere along the line the FSB and RAM speed are getting confused.\nCheck your system's specification from the System Profiler application found in /Applications/Utilities. Under the Hardware section look at the \"Model Identifier\". \nIf you get MacBook3,1 then you're in luck - that's the newer (Late 2007) model with greater RAM support and graphics. Anything prior to that (Macbook2,1 or MacBook1,1) and you're looking at (approx) 3GB limit or even 2GB (for the very first gen model).\n\nA: If the seller will divulge the serial number, you can check online at http://support.apple.com/manuals. \nThe RamJet web site is the first place to go for a very good laymans tool to figure out what macs will run what memory.  In several cases, they work reliably with more RAM than apple officially supports. \n\nA: If it's a plastic one then\nBecause of 2.4GHz CPU it must be Macbook4,1(Early 2008) with Santa Rosa chipset.\nIt has Intel X3100 GPU and may accept as much as 6GB of DDR2 RAM. Still it was shipped with 2GB contrary to sellers claims. Here is a latest Mactracker app for Windows to check on this info.\nIf you end up buying it I would recommend buying 9.5mm PATA bay from ebay and swapping HDD with SSD for this, well, a bit old machine to be really joyful to use.

I am trying to edit a line of code within a program that I use for work.\nI need to use the insert key to be able to add additional spaces that I can then type letters, numbers or characters.\nHow to get this function to work on my MacBook Air?\n\nA: It depends on the physical keyboard and on the keyboard layout.

However, it seems that you can only add one Twitter (and Facebook) account per contact, which is rather inconvenient as I know several people who have 2 Twitter accounts.\nIs there a way to add a second Twitter field to iOS Contacts or iCloud? I know I could add a twitter:@username URL, but I was wondering if it's possible to natively add a second account.\n\nA: It is possible to assign multiple twitter ids to a contact. You have 2 ways of achieving this. Through iOS or through the Address Book app on Mac OS.\nOn iOS 5 you can add multiple Twitter accounts to a contact on the device like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Chose a contact\n\n*Edit\n\n*Add field ...\n\n*Select Twitter\n\n*Enter the twitter account\n\n\nWhen you already have a Twitter account field you can't add another one like this anymore.

It uses 802.1X Authentication. I can't ping my iPad from my Macbook. Is there any way I can make Bonjour or AirPlay work? Is there a tool that proxies or routes the Bonjour service somehow?\n\nA: If all else fails you can create a wireless LAN directly on your Mac and connect your iPad to this WLAN. TUAW has some good instructions on how to do this. To start pick the appropriate option in the Airport/Wi-Fi menu (picture shamelessly taken from the linked TUAW article):\n\nThe rest is pretty self-explaining.\n\nA: if you have an ethernet port in your dorm, what about using an Airport Express to connect to your college's LAN network and use it as a wireless router?\n\nA: It seems you have enough information to surmise the end at this point. If it's unicast, then there's clearly some limiting going on from inside the network. If routers are not allowed (I fail to see how they'd be able to tell), then you're out of luck; It's ad hoc or nothing.\n\nA: Nambrot: What David said is exactly right. The college network is also almost certainly not able to detect if you're using a router, and routers are probably only not permitted in dorms in the sense that they make you potentially vulnerable to network breaches, packet sniffing, or incorrect subnets. If your college network doesn't permit static, externally visible IP addresses, and also (naturally) doesn't work with Bonjour, I think you're out of luck. I'm basing this strictly off of my own IT experience working at my university though, so YMMV.\n", "Q: My MacBook seems to be an insomniac (won't sleep) As of several days ago, my MacBook refuses to go to sleep either automatically or manually. I have taken the following troubleshooting measures to no effect:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset PRAM\n\n*Rest SMC\n\n*Boot in SafeMode\n\n*Verified that the lid sensor was working (my MacBooks's status light responds when it's closed)\n\n\nAnyone have any ideas would could be causing my MacBook's incompetence?\nI'm on 10.7.2 btw.\nUPDATE: I found the solution to the problem: I had unnecessary sharing services enabled despite not using them for weeks.

Turning these off fixed the problem :)\n\nA: You've tried the few things I'd recommend before going down this route, but trashing the sleepimage and changing hibernate settings can help. Note I take no responsibility if your Mac eats your dog.\nAside from that I'd suggest checking the syslogs when you shut the lid to see if the hibernate signal is actually being fired and what OS X is doing, and see if there's any errant processes that could keep waking it. \n\nA: Do you have a Magic mouse and do you have bluetooth turned on?

Is it possible to do this with Chrome? \n(I was able to do this with Quicksilver on my old G5 Mac, although I used Firefox on that machine.)\n\nA: There is now a Google Chrome plugin for Quicksilver (with documentation).

I've upgraded my iPhone 3GS to iOS 5 and hence changed my baseband to 5.16.05. Now it is not possible for me to unlock the phone. Is there any way I could get both GPS and phone working?. I've done jailbreak with redsnow. I don't need iOS 5 and is willing to downgrade without breaking anything. Is it possible to do it?\n\nA: No. You are out of luck.\nEven if you had saved the SHSH blobs for iOS 4.X (which are what you'll require to rollback), you can't revert the baseband, which is required for the unlock. So even if you did manage to install iOS 4.X, you'd still be running baseband 5.16.05.\n\nA: By now it is possible to down-grade your baseband - at least for the iPhone 3G and 3GS (unfortunately not 4/S) - from the iPad's 06.15 to 05.13.04 (un-lockable) thanks to the great work of the iPhone Dev Team:\n\nThe iPhone Dev Team is happy to announce a baseband downgrade option in redsn0w for those who are using the iPad’s 06.15 baseband on the iPhone3G or iPhone3GS.\nTypically you’d have the 06.15 baseband if you unlock with ultrasn0w but updated your iPhone baseband past 05.13.04.  With this new capability, you can now downgrade specifically from 06.15 to 05.13.04 (even if you never had 05.13.04 on that device before).  This gives you the best of both worlds: ultrasn0w compatibility and a normal iPhone baseband with full GPS and the ability to use stock IPSWs again.\n\nSee this post on their blog.\n", "Q: Changing OS X Spotlight priorities for specific applications I'd like to fiddle with Spotlight's priorities so that when I enter 'photo', my first returned result is Adobe Photoshop, and not Photo Booth.\nI understand how to change priorities for or disable entire file types, but I'd rather just remove Photo Booth from Spotlight search.\nFailing that, I could just delete Photo Booth. I don't use it. I think Photo Booth can't normally be deleted on Lion, so what's the command to delete it via Terminal?\n\nA: You don't need to delete anything. And I strongly advise you not too, since it's a built-in app. It could be useful to other part of the system, and it will probably be added back on a system update.\n\nAbout your problem, Spotlight is smart, it will learn that when you type \"photo\" you want to open iPhoto over the time.\nJust keep on typing photo, and selecting iPhoto over PhotoBooth.\n\nIf Spotlight is not smart enough or fast enough for you, you can try an alternative launcher, such as Alfred. It may be faster to learn than Spotlight (at least, it's what I found happened for me).\n\nA: Have been running into this myself, and I decided to tweak a little. Here's what I ended up with...\nOpen the photoshop directory through applications.\n'Get info' on the Photoshop executable.

While it's great that Terminal now has built-in support for changing the ANSI colors, I find it annoying that it automatically adjusts the colors to improve contrast, which means the colors that I actually pick often end up washed out or off in some other way. Here's a screenshot explaining the problem: \n\nThis bugs me because I like to use the same color scheme in Terminal and MacVim, and with this handling of colors by Terminal, they don't match up to the ones in MacVim.\nDoes anyone know of a solution to this, besides switching to iTerm 2 (which I'd rather not – I like the rest of Terminal, especially some GUI touches like the pulsating visual bell). Thanks!\n\nA: Color profiles are definitely important, but there's another issue lurking here: Terminal.app automatically brightens any color when displayed over the default background. Here, for example, are the colors output by Terminal.app running the Solarized color theme, as measured with DigitalColor Meter in sRGB mode, and compared against the canonical Solarized sRGB values.\nWhen presented over a black (or any other color) background, Terminal.app produces approximately the correct colors; however, on the default background, all colors except the default and default bold text are substantially too bright.\n\n\nA: In short: no, there's no supported means to disable this.\nTerminal automatically applies a minimum contrast when displaying an ANSI (or extended 256-color table) color on the terminal background color, or when displaying the terminal foreground/text color on an ANSI background color.\nThis is meant to be a convenience, so that one can set a background or foreground color and have them contrast with the ANSI colors without having to adjust all the ANSI colors. This was especially important in earlier versions of Terminal, which lacked Preferences support for customizing the ANSI colors.\nOlder versions of Terminal applied the minimum-contrast for all color combinations, but that meant that, e.g., ANSI red-on-red text could be readable, but some programs intentionally display text with the same foreground and background color in order to hide it (for displaying game hints or joke punchlines, for example). Because of that, newer versions of Terminal do not apply the minimum-contrast when displaying one ANSI color upon another.\nNow, rather than just address the same-color case, Terminal avoids applying the minimum-contrast for all combinations of ANSI colors, because it is assumed that if the user customizes any ANSI colors they will customize them all to contrast with each other as desired. It is also assumed that those users will adjust or take into account the terminal background and foreground colors to fit their desired color scheme.\nIf the workaround of using colors with different color spaces—suggested in other answer(s)—works, it's likely relying upon a bug in the color-handling code, which is supposed to work with any color, and may stop working in the future when that bug is fixed.\nIf being able to explicitly disable or adjust the minimum-contrast behavior is important to you, I recommend letting Apple know by filing a report at https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/ using any Apple ID.\n\nA: Here's the trick that you need to know: Values set via RGB get mangled, those set via HSB do not.\nI had a similar problem using the (great) Solarized color scheme: MacVim had a darker (and correct) background color than Terminal, even though I was setting all of the correct RGB values per the Solarized spec. See here:\n\nBasically you need to know what your color values are supposed to be for each of the Terminal ANSI, text, and Background (note this one is on the Window tab) colors and then set them via the HSB picker instead of RGB. See this example:\n\nFor whatever reason (I suspect some type of profile thing, or perhaps a contrast tweak as you suggest), the RGB color you enter is not what you get. You'll also notice that once you've set the values via HSB, switching to the RGB picker will show options different than you'd expect. The Solarized value conversions all agree according to Photoshop; it seems to be something that the Apple color picker is doing for you.\n\nA: Open Window settings for your theme, toggle background color, set blur to 0% and Opacity to 100%. After this your colors will be same as you want. Also you should check every color you pick for text for this parameters.\n\n\nA: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the color picker\n\n*Choose the sliders tab\n\n*Click on the swatch below the magnifying glass, to the left of the slider dropdown\n\n*Choose Device RGB\nNow colors specified by hex value will not be subjected to color space conversion.\nIn Sierra, the color space picker has changed to the gear icon:\n\nSource\n", "Q: What can I do to increase the performance of my Mac Pro? I have a stock early 2007 Mac Pro (8GB RAM, 2 x NVIDIA GeForce 7300 GT (256 MB). It has a RAID0 bootdrive and is running Lion. I've had it for >5years and I really love it.\nHowever, recent attempts to do stuff, including running WebGL demos, has led to a realisation that its actually now quite an old machine. This isn't a problem for me day-to-day - its still a monster able to rip CDs, play DVDs, run a Windows VM simultaneously without breaking a sweat - but as a developer I'd like to stay abreast of current tech like WebGL and whatever other else.\nI'm not prepared to spend thousands on a newer machine, mine is just fine for day-to-day purposes, but I would like to soup it up. Upgrading GPUs has been mentioned, but I was wondering if other parts of the system could be swapped out with newer ones.\nDoes anyone have any experience of upgrading older Mac Pros?\n\nA: You have few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU: Now you have two two-cores XEONs. You may upgrade them to two 4-cores XEONs. Here is a crowd-sourced experience on this. AFAIK the best you can add is X5355 or even X5365. Here is a good discussion on this matter. And these are pictures.\n\n*SSD: Just put in the place reserved for second ODD(Can't remember if your model have wires in place already). Or buy 3.5\" adapter like IcyDock 2.5\" to 3.5\" SSD & SATA Hard Drive Converter or OWC's MountPro. Yes, it is much faster for boot drive than conventional HDD, RAIDed or not.\n\n*GPU: look at this blog and forums there if you are interested in flashing cheap PC card for your Mac.\n\n*Memory: You may add as much as much as 32Gb with 240-pin PC2-5300 (667MHz) DDR2 ECC fully-buffered DIMM (FB-DIMM) (matched pairs) 4GB modules. If you need them.\nRight now I would choose SSD. And then I would check if prices for those CPU are stable or keep falling and then decide on time and need for CPU upgrade.\n\nA: You could consider an SSD. While you can buy a 3.5\" SSD, most SSDs are 2.5\" so you would need some kind of adaptor like an icydock if you chose one of those.\n", "Q: Does iMessage fallback to SMS on a per message basis? As we know, the messages app in the iPhone will detect if the party you are texting to is iMessage compatible or not, and will then send an iMessage instead of an SMS. This is great, and works as advertised with other iPhone users that have data plans.\nHowever, what happens with an iPhone with NO data plan? (bought it unlocked, for example). The ideal situation for me, would be that the message is first tried to be delivered as an iMessage, and after some time it would time out and be delivered as an SMS instead, but I don't think that's the case.\nDoes anyone has experience with this? Will iMessage fall back to SMS on a per message basis?\n\nA: Yes, it will.\nI've experienced it a few times, if the message stays undelivered for something between one to five minutes (I haven't checked exactly), it will fallback to SMS.\nThis behavior can be changed in Settings > Messages > Send As SMS, checking it off will not send the message as SMS if iMessage is not available. Rechecking it will send the message not delivered (even if they were sent before).\n\nA: A couple of answers I have found since I am in the USA for a vaction from Canada and HAve the Data Roaming turned off, I have a friend with a 4S Phone and if I am using wifi I can send an iMessage but if I am not on wifi it will not deliver the message till after I go back on Wifi.\nI have found two possible answers that will send those messages by SMS instead\nOption One....\nUsing Siri say \"Siri, send Mary Jones a text\"\nDoing this will send a SMS rather than an iMessage\nOption Two...\nIf writing a message in iMessage when done press \"Send\" then Tap and hold the message itself this will give you the option of sneding it as a SMS Message.\nHope that helps people, I think it works for me, will test it later tonight.\n\nA: My experience of this is less friendly. iMessage is chosen automatically for recipients with iOS devices. But it often fails (no clear reason why). When it does so, it throws a \"message not delivered\" error. At this point I can choose to send via SMS, but it doesn't happen automatically (over several hours).\nThis is typically when I'm connected via 3G on Vodafone in the UK. I have \"Send as SMS\" turned on.\n", "Q: Is there a way to automate restarting with a different boot disk? I have Lion and Snow Leopard installed on my machine, and I switch between them all the time (I develop for compatibility on both platforms).

FWIW, it's a Western Digital internal 3.5\" SATA drive in an Antec HD enclosure.  Anyway, of course every so often I have to unplug it so that I can take my MacBook places, so I eject the drive as usual and everything's cool.\nBut when I plug the drive back in, it doesn't mount.  If I plug it in and then power-cycle the drive itself, then it mounts just fine, but due to how my office is laid out, this is inconvenient.  And, too, I shouldn't have to power-cycle the drive, right?  I should be able just to plug it in and have the MacBook recognize it, no?\nSo: what's going on and how can I fix it?\nThanks in advance for any and all help.\n\nA: There is a workaround, sometimes the drive will detect but not mount. If you open Disk Utility it should be listed on the sidebar and you can manually mount it from there.\nThis doesn't resolve the underlying issue of why OS X hasn't automounted, but if you check in the system logs when you plug it in you might get a clue towards that.\n\nA: The requirement to power the drive enclosure off, then (quickly) on, suggests to me that: \n\n\n*\n\n*the drive does not spin up in good time\n\n*maybe the extra power required, for a timely spin up, is insufficient or too short. \n\n\nIf it were a LaCie drive, I would say try a new power supply. \n\nAlso, adapted from my answer about a random connection issue: \nIf the file system is dirty at time of connection of the disk, then the operating system will run fsck_hfs until (hopefully) repairs seem to succeed. During this period the volume will be not mounted, and the OS presents no alert. \n(An alert appears only if, for example, repairs are unsuccessful.)\nFor a file system that includes backups written by Time Machine: if repairs are necessary, fsck_hfs may take an extraordinarily long time. \nWith Console you can browse\n/var/log/fsck_hfs.log\n", "Q: Lion (10.7.2) -- CPU heats to 90-degrees and Java apps crash -- why?

I'd start by looking at Activity Monitor to spot which particular process has decided it wants a supercomputer cooling system.\nIf it turns out to be Java (which is likely), trash Java from your system and then reinstall it from there. It could be a damaged cache file, the application might have corrupt preferences, or some other combination.  \n\nA: I reinstalled Lion.

I haven't installed, upgraded or updated anything at all: it just happened. Do you guys have any suggestions about this?

If you are subscribed to Wired magazine (paid subscription) you can download the Wired iPad app free and enter your Subscription # and view it on the iPad.\n\nA: No, Apple doesn't get any payment this way. There are a lot of newspapers, magazines etc. providing apps which allow electronic access. If they would offer in-app purchases Apple would take the usual 30%. \n", "Q: How can I gain screen share/ssh access to a G5 connected by ethernet to a Mac Mini on my wireless Airport Extreme Network from my MacBook Pro? Ok, so the scenario is this:\nI have a G5 Quad (running Leopard) with no wireless card.\nThe G5 is connected by ethernet to a Mac-Mini (running Lion), which is picking up my AirPort Extreme network over WiFi. The Mac-Mini shares it's internet connection over ethernet to the G5 enabling it to connect to the internet perfectly. I can also screen share or ssh into the G5 from the Mac-Mini without any problems.\nNow comes the trouble:\nI have a MacBook Pro (running Lion) which also connects to the same WiFi network as the Mac-Mini. I can see (and connect to) the Mac-Mini from the MBP without trouble, but I cannot see or connect to the G5 from the MBP. How can I configure this so that I can ssh or screen share the G5 from my MBP?\nIPs and subnets of machines:\nMac-Mini\nIP: 10.0.0.9\nSubnet Mask: 255.255.255.0\nMBP\nIP: 10.0.0.4\nSubnet Mask: 255.255.255.0\nG5\nIP: 192.168.2.3 \nSubnet Mask: 255.255.255.0\n\nA: This is happening because the two machines are not on the same subnet. \nThe G5 is on the Mac Mini's subnet, while the Mac Mini is on your Wi-Fi's subnet. The IP address of the G5 has been handed out by the Internet Sharing DHCP service on your Mac Mini, while the Mac Mini's IP address has been handed out by the DHCP service on your router. \nYour best bet would be to connect your G5 via Ethernet to your router. \nIf that is not possible because of location constraints, there is a piece of software for Mac called IPNetRouterX that may do the job. It allows Ethernet bridging, which is what you want. The only problem with this software is that it costs money. It seems like there might be a free trial of it, however.\n\nA: iChat + Chax (Relogin/Auto-accept Screen Share requiest) on G5 would be an easy way to achieve that, I believe.\n\nA: What if, in the G5 network preferences pane you click on Ethernet, then advanced, then tcp/ip, and as Configure IPv4 you select Manual, and as IPv4 address you use 10.0.0.5, Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0, and as Router 10.0.0.9? Then from the Macbook Pro you can say\nssh user@10.0.0.5\nDoes that work?\nEDIT: Of course \"Remote Login\" has to be on the G5 as well.\n", "Q: Is it preferable to use the same SSID name when creating multiple WiFi zones? I have an Airport Extreme and Airport Express connected via an ethernet cable to different parts of my home. Is it preferable to used the same SSID name? Will my devices automatically connect to the stronger signal?\n\nA: I have a similar setup: same SSID and same password. My devices (laptop, iPhone, iPad) connect automatically. Roaming from one zone to the other is failing from time to time but generally I have no problems.\n\nA: Just my two cents here, but I would suggest the opposite of what Matteo does. I have different names, because in this way I know which one is the strongest, dependent on where I am (the two networks cover the whole house, but not with the same strength).\nFor a Mac, it connects following the order specified in System Preferences, Network, Wi-fi, Advanced, Wi-fi.\nFor iDevices, I have no idea, but the problem, at least for me, it that when I move to the part of the house where the other network is stronger, I can manually change the Wi-fi, and I'll immediately know which one I have to choose (not trivial if the names are the same).\n\nA: Yes, your devices will automatically connect to the stronger signal.\nThey will not switch between signals if one becomes stronger, they will only make this decision when they are looking for a network. Once on a network they'll stay on it until something causes them to disconnect (user, loss of signal, going to sleep, etc).\nThe advantage of having the same SSID everywhere is minimising configuration. Users don't need to separately enter the details for each access point. This isn't a big deal for two APs and one or two clients, but in a school/workplace/boarding house/etc you want to keep it simple. This applies not only to new devices being set up, but also changes to the network password. It also makes it easier for novices to use (may or may not be relevant depending on typical residents/guests at your home).\nThe advantage of having unique SSIDs for each AP is that you can intentionally choose which AP to connect to. Sometimes this is useful, though I tend to think most cases where it's useful are because of a bad network design. Sometimes that design is out of your control, or correcting it is beyond your budget, so it doesn't make it wrong to have unique SSIDs, just a little more fiddly/annoying than if access points were in better places, were more evenly distributed, more evenly utilised, had better antennas, etc.\nIn either case, it can be helpful to ensure there's an access point very close to the most common places devices are used, and overlap between access points is around places you move through (corridors/hallways) rather than places you use the devices. This can mean, counterintuitively, turning down the power on an access point, or moving it, to intentionally reduce the overlap between APs. That way, the switch will happen automatically (whether SSIDs are unique or not) if you move from one region to the other. Something like NetSpot can help with this.\nIn either case, the setup complexity is O(NxM) for N = number of SSIDs, M = number of devices. So let's try some examples, assuming 30 seconds to (re-)enter each wifi password.\n\n\n*\n\n*In a typical home network, say 2 APs, 5 devices = 10, it might take 5 minutes to setup/adjust for unique SSIDs, or 1.5 minutes for a common SSID.\n\n*In a small organisation, say 6 APs, 60 devices (30 users, each with laptop + smartphone), it'd take 3 hours total time to update for unique SSIDs, or half an hour with a common SSID.\n\n\nA: It depends on what you want from your network. If you'd like to have devices/computers connecting on either the Airport Extreme/Express to be on the same network, you can use the Airport Express to extend your network (see this Apple support page for details):\n\nQuestion: Can AirPort Express act as a bridge?\nAnswer: AirPort Express can act as a bridge in three different ways:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*If you have an existing wired network, it can bridge this network to wireless clients.\n  \n*If it is set up as a WDS remote or relay station, it can bridge the wireless network to wired clients.\n  \n*If it is set up as a WDS remote or relay station, it can bridge the wireless network to wireless clients (or \"wirelessly extend\" the range of the network).\n  \n\nMore info from Apple about using Airports to extend your wireless network is available on this article.\nIf you want your devices to be on separate networks, having different SSIDs on each of your Airports would provide that separation.\n\nA: On my ground floor I have an internet connected dsl wifi-router (fritzbox) from my provider with the possibility of wifi on 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz or both. I have both and distinguished them by adding 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz to the ssid names.\nOn my second floor I have a Time Capsule.\nI had configured it first with a different ssid names than the machine on the ground floor but then my devices did not reconnect to the stronger signal.\nThey kept as long as possible connected to the machine below.\nWhen I changed the ssid names on the Time Capsule exactly to the ssid names below with the same passwords, the switch works perfect.\nYou can test it by walking with connected device (iPhone) from the ground floor to the second floor. Halfway I saw my wifi reception getting lower but more upstairs it took the stronger signal from the Time Capsule automatically.\n", "Q: How can I switch terminal settings using a keyboard shortcut? Usually I need different settings in my terminal depending on what I'm working on. For example, change the opacity to see some info on the back.\nI think an option is to set different setting schemas, and then switch between them with a keyboard shortcut. Any ideas on how to achieve this?\n\nA: You can do this via Terminal's AppleScript interface, for example to set the background colour of the first tab in the first window to green:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    set tabsettings to current settings of tab 0 of window 0\n    set background color of tabsettings to {0, 32768, 0} -- colours are 16-bit\nend tell\n\nThat's the good news. The bad news is that the background opacity is not exposed to AppleScript in Lion (this seems like an oversight by Apple). You can change pretty much everything else like this though (see the Library in the AppleScript Editor for the full list). There are a few crazy AppleScripts out there that adjust the background opacity by emulating keypresses to Terminal, but that approach is too horrible to even link to.\nOnce you have the AppleScript code to change the settings to your liking there are many ways of binding your script to a key.\n", "Q: Bad battery life on iPhone 3GS used as iPod Touch My spouse got an iPhone 4 recently and we want to use the old iPhone 3GS as an iPod for the daughter.  They switched him over at the AT&T store so I don't know if the old phone has a SIM card in it or not right this minute (not at home).\nThe WIFI works fine.  On the top left of the screen where it would show bars and \"AT&T\", it displays NO SERVICE.\nThe issue is this:  the battery drains over night when it is asleep.  I have charged it the last few days and the next time the kid wants it, the battery is dead.  The iphone was only 1 year old so the battery shouldn't be fading.\nIs the phone searching for service and draining the battery even when asleep?  \nI have disabled the location services and made sure push notifications are set to manual or disabled.  \nAny thoughts?  \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Remove the SIM. That should solve your problem. It will complain about no SIM whenever it is restarted but apart from that will work fine. I presume you want the WiFi to remain functional.\n\nA: To conserve battery, put the phone into airplane mode and then turn on Wifi. Also, if you are not using Bluetooth, turn it off.\n\nA: When the iPhone has no service, what it does is continually search for a signal that it can connect to. This is why the battery drains so quickly when you have no signal, especially over a long period such as over night (this is also, incidentally, why the battery drains so fast when you have Wifi on but have no network to connect to).\nAs you are using it as an iPod essentially, I would recommend you go into Settings, and put Airplane Mode into 'On.' This turns off all outside connections (GPS, carrier etc) with the phone. That way, the unit will not be searching and therefore drain battery, but you can still turn on Wifi or Bluetooth when you wish.\nHope this helps! \n", "Q: Is there a Game Boy Color emulator for Lion?

I haven't personally tried it out, but if it's at all as good as their program for PC you'll be set.\nBest of luck\n\nA: VisualBoyAdvance is apparently a PowerPC Application that is able to run on Macs up to OS X Snow Leopard because those versions include a feature of being able to convert Power PC apps to Intel, which is what Macs are now with their Intel chipset. \nUnfortunately they took out this feature from OS X Lion so it now ONLY ACCEPTS Intel applications.

Edit away the on screen keyboard from the shot later if you want to.\n\nA: Try using the on screen keyboard and hitting the prt scrn button\n", "Q: Doing a clean install of Lion on a system purchased with Snow Leopard results in iPhoto lost. How to recover? I am not terribly dependent on iPhoto, but I'd prefer not to purchase it via the App Store, as I already owned the app in Snow Leopard.\nHowever, now that I have done a clean install of OS X Lion (did a complete format and used recovery mode to install Lion), it is not there.\nHow can I install iPhoto on my system without repurchasing it?\n\nA: You shouldnt need to buy it as it is included as part of the iLife suite which comes with all Macs. \nFrom: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2604 \n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the Applications installation disc and double-click the Install Bundled Software icon. \n\n*If your computer came with an iLife installation disc, or you purchased a newer version of iLife, insert that disc instead.\n\n*Follow the onscreen instructions. Then, in the Installation Type pane, click Customize.\n\n*Click the disclosure triangle next to Bundled Applications, select the checkbox next to the application you want to install, then click Install.\n\n\nA: Your Mac should have come with recovery disks, one with applications and another with the OS. You should be able to use the applications disk to install iPhoto and anything else that shipped with your Mac.\nI tested this myself when I did the same thing at Lion's launch.\n", "Q: How can i diagnose a failed Install of Snow Leopard? I'm trying to upgrade from Leopard 10.5.8 to Snow Leopard, using the install CD.\nThe steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the DVD\n\n*Start the installation\n\n*When is about the 40-50% of the installation, the system restarts\n\n*Then ejects the DVD\n\n*Snow Leopard is not installed\n\n\nHow can I know what's going wrong? What I have to do to fix it?\n\nA: This has happened to me in the past. The solution that worked for me was making sure that the disc surface is clean and scratch free, and I mean very clean. Using normal CD wipes is good to get dirt off, but if it is scratched more than slightly, then you may have problems.\nOr the disc may be defective from the factory, it does happen and they do exist. \nTry talking to your local Apple Store about a possible replacement, or if worst comes to the worst, you can order one here (Apple still stocks them).\nHope this helps!\n\nA: In addition to the answer above, it is worth pointing out that failed Snow Leopard installations can be recovered. This is useful knowledge if you have more than one copy of the media available (as a disc or a partition on a drive etc.). \nAgain, it'd be a good idea to head somewhere like an Apple store where they would likely help you finish off this install!\n", "Q: Connect iPhone to USB HardDrive I have a unique situation at my company.  We are trying to develop a mobile service app that connects to slot machines.  If you connect a PC to the slot machine, an external HD pops up in Windows and you can copy files to it.\nWe want to do the same thing through an iPad.\nI know this would be all custom code, but I was wondering if it was possible for iOS to read an external USB drive through it's doc connector.\n\nA: No. iOS/iPad is only able to act as a USB host with the Camera Connection Kit (Apple Store). Even then, it only works to import/export pictures and videos between the iPad and camera.\n\nA: It may be overkill in your situation, but take a look at the Apple's APIs for programming External Accessories (ADC link). It may require changes to the hardware, but may serve your needs for use with future devices.\n", "Q: Is there simple note-taking tool available for Mac? I am looking for a simple note taking tool for, with only requirement for backing data, and code highlight support\n\nA: The PearNote app is one I can recommend with no caveats. It is simple, beautiful and powerful. \nYou don't have to use all of its features, but they are there if you ever wish to add audio or video. \n\nA: I recommend CodeBox. Simple interface with support for syntax highlighting, sync with Dropbox and etc.. Available in the Mac App Store\n\nA: Yes, it's called \"Stickies\" it's an App you already have on your Mac. Very simple but more powerful than most realize.

The problem is that the Terminal pops up and asks me for the password. Is there a way to allow Sidekick to execute sudo without asking for a password?\n\nA: You can disable password prompt when calling sudo in combination with certain commands by editing the sudoers file. This is done by opening a terminal and running sudo visudo. You have to add the follwing lines\nCmnd_Alias SIDEKICK_CMDS = /full/path/to/the/command1,  /full/path/to/the/command2\n\nyourUsername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: SIDEKICK_CMDS\n\nBe careful with this, as it may lead to security risks.

Is there a way to use punctuation in Siri dictation? For instance, if I tell Siri to text someone \"want to meet for dinner?\" - it won't track inflection, right? How can I add the question mark via voice?\n\nA: http://howto.cnet.com/how-to-make-siri-use-punctuation/8301-11310_39-20124379-285.html\nTo get Siri to use punctuation, you only need to speak the punctuation during the composition of your message. For example:\n\nHi comma how are you question mark did you see the game last night\n  exclamation point question mark.\n\nSpeaking that exact line to Siri would equate to the following message:\n\nHi, how are you?

See iTunes for more information.\" Every time I sync my iPhone or iPad (both running iOS 5) with iTunes, I get this error. iTunes displays no information that I can find about what the mystery six unsynced items are. How do I find out - any ideas?\n\n\nA: I haven't got a solution to this yet, but I get the same error (342 items though). The reason appears to be that the iPhone contains 342 hidden voice memos, not appearing within the voice memo app, but viewable (and playable while the iPhone is connected through USB) in the iPhone Device list in iTunes (click the triangle left to the device, see the voice memo playlist).\nI will backup and restore to factory setting now. But I'm fearing that the voice memos will be back there when I restore the backup. But then again, I might be lucky.. :) \nUPDATE; It did in fact work, I did get rid of the hidden voice memos and the \"could not sync\" message! Great.\nThoughts on how the hidden memos got there in the first place; I did mess around with the location of the Voice Memos playlist in iTunes, moved it in under a playlist folder, back and forth a couple of times, synced between, in addition to choosing to sync voice memos and not. It was all me testing how the (not intuitive) Voice Memos syncing works. Not sure if this produced the problems though.. but date stamps etc support the thoughts..\n\nA: I've typically seen this when some thing is trying to be synced from the computer to the device that is incompatible - like videos. Try syncing again (with usb), but uncheck each category of items (Books, Music, Movies, etc) each time before you test. At least you should be able to narrow down the issue.\n\nA: I was getting the error message that there were 2 items that could not be sync'd.  For me it was ring tones.  In the \"Tones\" window in iTunes the \"all tones\" button was selected (probably a default).  There were 7 ring tones in iTunes that were checked but only 5 tomes physically on my iPhone.  I selected \"only checked tones\" and then unchecked the 2 tones that were not listed on my phone.  Did a sync and the message did not reappear.  I would suggest looking in each of the tabs for your device in iTunes and then comparing what is there with what is on your device in the same category.  You will likely find the same type of thing that I found with \"Tones\"  From there it is as simple as making iTunes look like your device and the issue should go away.  \n\nA: I have figured out how to see what items it is having a problem syncing. Once the sync has completed click on your iPod/iPhone at the top left. On the left hand side is a grey label that says \"On My Device\". Under that are all tabs listed. Click through each one and it will show you all the items that are on your device, and it will also have the items that it has not been able to complete syncing on there. However, these items will be greyed out and will have a broken circle to the left of them.\n\nA: This can be a storage issue on your phone, maybe you don't have enough free space on your phone. Try deleting some pictures.\n", "Q: Does Inkscape work properly with large files on Mac OS? I am not a Mac user yet, but I am used to working with Inkscape on Linux platforms.

I have a 2TB external drive I use for Time Machine. At random intervals, it will decide to spin up and my entire UI freezes until it's finished. This is incredibly annoying.\nIt appears that this is due to Spotlight indexing.

Is there something I don't know about the usage of separated video and music folders on iOS 5?\n\nA: It is very annoying and it took me some time to figure it out. Before iOS 5 it could be done in the device itself, in the ipod app. \nNow you can still do it in, but only in Itunes: on the lft hand side just create a playlist and drag videos from the \"Movies\" section into the playlist created, then sync itunes with the device, and you are done.\n\nA: Try killing the Videos app and restarting it.

A couple of months ago, after updating my iPad I think, my iTunes password expired all of a sudden. I've had this iTunes account for about 4 year now and back then it was first time it happened.\nFast forward to today when I got my 4S. I choose to set it up as a new phone (as in: no restore from previous backups) and when I tried logging in with my iTunes account, it didn't work (wrong password).\nSo I headed over to appleid.apple.com on my mac, where I was again prompted with the message that my password was expired. \nSince there doesn't appear to be a set time between the 2 events, nor was there any inactivity, I'm wondering what causes the expiration.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: \n \nI've had this problem several times and was stumped and annoyed that I had to keep changing my password and fixing it in all the places I'm logged in with my Apple ID.\nI have the answer! I called Apple tech support and they know why this is happening!!!\nAt some point in the past, when you went to appleid.apple.com and logged in, under the \"Password and Security\" option, there was a setting that allowed you to manage how often your password would expire, ie. every 1, 3, 6, 12 months... you get the idea. Well, in the recent past Apple made some changes and security enhancements to better protect peoples' private information, and guess what? They have since removed this option. One of the Senior Technical Advisors who knew exactly what I was talking about (and had intentionally turned this setting on for themselves) went into their own account, but alas, it the option was not there.\n \nSolution?\nUnfortunately, at this time, however often your password was set to keep expiring, it will continue to do so.\n\nA possible solution in the future?\nCall AppleCare 1-800-275-2273 and ask them (try to speak to a Senior Advisor) to put in a formal request to the \"powers that be\" to either permanently stop all accounts from having their passwords expire, or make a request that Apple return the user's option to change their password expiration setting. Or both. The more people need something to change, the more likely Apple will be able to make it a priority.\n\nA: It appears that the login gets blocked after the wrong password is entered too often (see TS2446). Maybe somebody else has a AppleID similar to yours (or you fell victim to a DOS attack).\n\nA: I got it. They just updated it so if you go to appleid.apple.com and enter your current \"expired\" login, it will have you enter the old password and change it to a new one! Done!\n\nA: I got this exact same message. \nI logged into appleid.apple.com\nI was very unhappy about having to reset my password so when it asked for a the old password I entered it and when it asked for my new one I entered it again. \nSuddenly everything was working using the original password I had always been using. \nNo change no problem :) \n", "Q: How can I get control functionalities in the notification center like in Android?

How can I get all 3 modes and easily change between them on iPhone?\n\nA: iOS is different than android in this aspect. \nVibrate is implemented as two software binary switches in iOS.  Vibrate can be on or off in silent and independently on or off in non-silent. \nVolume is a software slider that can optionally be controlled by the external buttons.  When the silent switch is orange / down / silent most sounds are muted. \nThere are plenty of apps that control volume but not vibrate status outside the settings app. Take Five is my favorite. \nUnless there is a jailbreak app that someone has created to emulate android, there is no program that does precisely what you ask. \nWhen I want zero chance of any sound or vibration, I power down my device. \n", "Q: Alternative to iTunes Album Art I'm looking for an alternative to iTunes' Album Art.

After deleting several files, one of which had the word notification in it, I don't see the popup anymore.

I just got my new Macbook Pro 15\" - it had OS X Lion pre-installed.\nIs there a way I can download the OS X Lion ISO (legitimately) so I will be able to have it in case I need to reinstall ?\nIf I look in the app store it doesn't appear that I purchased Lion (since it came pre-installed). I am aware of the internet recovery option but am looking for a way to download the file now so I can recover later without an internet connection.\n\nA: You can use the Recovery partition or Internet Recovery to download the full installer. The basic method is, tell it to re-install on an external drive, let it download, interrupt it before it reboots your system, then you can grab the DMG file and write it to a USB drive so that you'll have a full (no internet required) installer when you need it.\nFull details here: Mac OS X Hints: 10.7: How to get a full Lion install disc for a new MacBook Air or Pro\nYou'll want to have a spare external drive handy to use as the install target so that you don't risk overwriting your boot drive.\n\nA: Recovery options for Macs with Lion pre-installed are documented in HT4718:\n\n\n*\n\n*Recovery HD: recovery partition on hard drive, accessible by booting with Cmd-R pressed til the Apple logo is displayed\n\n*Internet Recovery: If you got a new (empty) hard drive, your Mac will boot into an internet recovery mode\nRecovery in both cases requires internet connectivity.\nYou can use this to your benefit by rebooting your Mac into recovery and connect a USB drive. Go through the steps to link your Apple ID to that Mac for a Lion reinstall. Choose the external drive for the install. You should be able to catch the process at a reboot and save the 10.7.2 installer for later. Worst case is you miss it and the system deleted the installer application. Just open the App Store and hold option when selecting Purchased. You can generally re-download things once the store knows you get a copy of Lion. \n\nA: I created a USB stick with Lion DiskMaker which seems to be the best method for USB.  For DVDs, if you browse inside the Lion Installer you should find installESD.dmg.  According to internet sources, burning this file to DVD creates a bootable disk (I have not tried this approach).\nWith regard to the Lion redownload, holding the option key while clicking on Purchased in the App store gives you the redownload option.\n\nA: I'm not sure it works for MacBook Pros that came with Lion pre-installed, but you can download it from the Mac App Store—just option-click on the \"Purchased\" tab.\n", "Q: Which software to batch join videos AND add a chapter for each? I have 55 short clips (<1min) that have the same characteristics (only the content and length change) and I want to combine them into one big chaptered video.\nI know with QTPro how to combine 2 videos and how to add chapters to 1 file. Now I need a Mac OS X tool that's gonna do it automagically.\n\nA: You can easily combine many files into one with free MPEG Streamclip's Batch mode — cmd+b. But it will not automatically add chapters at the start of every clip included.\nUpdate: Just checked that you can add chapters manually with free tool Subler.\nYou may also add chapters with usually included with every Mac iMovie app. Here is how to do it with iMovie'09-11 but I believe the latter will re-compress the video degrading quality.\n", "Q: Use Apple TV as airport express If I buy an Apple TV and connect my HiFi system to the optical out, will the sound go to the TV through the HDMI cable, and the through the optical cable? \nOr will the optical cable take precedent over the HDMI? \nBasically can I use the Apple TV as an Airport Express for my HiFi, when the TV is turned off, without plugging cables in and out?\n\nA: The audio signal is sent to both the HDMI and the optical outputs at the same time, so yes, what you want to do is possible.\n", "Q: I want to sync my previously never synced iPhone to a Mac. Is there a risk of data loss? I want to sync my previously never synced iPhone (filled with 2 years of pics & music) to my mother's Mac. Is there any risk of data loss?\nIt has never been linked to a computer. I have many pictures & videos of my baby & don't want to lose them!\n\nA: Yes - there always is a risk of data loss even though the software (iTunes and iOS) are designed to let you make a backup and transfer all data before it erases anything. \nBest to go online / call apple or visit a store and research how to prevent an automatic sync for your version of iTunes and the steps to back up / transfer that content before you start. \nWithout knowing your iOS version and iTunes version it's hard to be more specific. It should go fine, but best to be prepared beforehand. \n\nA: Here's how to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone via USB to the Mac.\n\n*Start iTunes\n\n*On the left menu in iTunes, your iPhone should appear.\n\n*Do a right click on your iPhone\n\n*You have two options now:\n\n\n\nFirst: Select Backup. So your iPhone creates a local backup of your\n  whole iPhone data. \n  Second: Select \"Transfer Purchases\"\n\nSo all your Music, Videos etc. should be transfered to the Mac. \n\nI would prefer to create a backup first, and then transfer all your\n  purchased data.\n\n\nA: You have to use an iTunes where no iPhone have been previously set up.\nSo even a second computer, or you set up another account for the OS (Windows or Mac OS). Then you will have the choice to backup the phone...\n\nA: You can transfer all music and pictures on to her Mac.\nOpen finder and navigate to the iPhone, you can then extract all the images as you would with a digital camera. \nTo take the music files you will need to use a piece of software such as Xilisoft you cannot manually take the audio from an iPhone as it appears as a camera unlike an iPod which appears as a harddrive.\n", "Q: Repository of .qtz s in system files? Apparently there is a place within the OS's system files that have lots of .qtz s that you can use for your desktop background. \nCould someone tell me the location of the files?\n\nA: Open Terminal and run locate qtz to get the list for your system. You may need to install Xcode to get the full set, with the added benefit of being able to run \"/Developer/Applications/Quartz Composer.app\" to develop your own.\n\nA: You might be looking for:\n/System/Library/Graphics/Quartz Composer Patches/\n\n..which are the examples that show in Quartz Composer's Library at launch, on 10.6.8 anyway.\n\nA: You're probably looking for ./System/Library/Compositions, which is where the Quartz files are located for iTunes and Photo Booth (and a couple other system things I believe).\nAs for setting it as your desktop, I'm not sure about that. Simply dragging one to the image well in the Desktop & Screen Saver pane doesn't do anything, but if you know of a way to make it work I'd love to find out.\n\nA: Although I do not know where you can find the QuartzFiles, here is an application that will allow you to set them to your backgrounds if and when you find them:\nhttp://wallsaver.en.softonic.com/mac\n", "Q: Use GarageBand's metronome for practice In GarageBand '09, I find that the Metronome plays only when I'm recording.\nHow do I use the Metronome just for practice?\n\nA: Well, you could just start a recording every time you practice and delete it at the end. Not very practical probably.\nAlternatively you could download Metronome which \"is designed with the practicing musician in mind which means that it's fast and easy to use. Nearly all of Metronome's functions and settings can be changed by using a single key.\" Actually there are probably a lot of other metronome applications, this was just the first I found in Google.\n", "Q: 3GS iPhone will not update to iOS 5 According the iOS 5 features page on Apple's web site, the 3GS is supported. When I push the \"Check for Update\" button in iTunes, it says \"This version of the iPhone software (4.2.1) is the current version.\" I'm running iTunes 10.5.142 on Windows. I have also used this same setup to upgrade my iPhone 4.\nIs there something else I need to do here? Could it be refusing because this phone does not have a carrier anymore and I use it only over WiFi?\n\nA: Simple answer: You don't have a 3GS, but rather a 3G. The last iOS update for the 3G was 4.2.1. A 3GS ran all the way up to 4.3.5, which was the last public release of iOS 4. If you are running 4.2.1 and iTunes doesn't even see the 4.3.5 update, then, well, that's pretty telling that you don't actually have a 3GS but a 3G.\n\nA: Could be a couple of things, most likely your iTunes version\n\n\n*\n\n*verify that you are running the latest version of iTunes (version 10.5)\n\n*The latest version of iTunes requires Mac OS 10.5 or above\n\nA: As above, The 3GS does support IOS 5, Update your itunes to the latest version should sort that out. Also try on a different computer, maybe your host files have corrupted.\n", "Q: If i am not on 3G nor WiFi, do iMessage get sent via SMS? How does iMessage work? I had messaged one of my friend with iMessage, and he replied to me. However, I had disabled 3G and was not on a WiFi network. Were the subsequent replies routed via regular text message/SMS?\n\nA: Yes, as long as the message was sent to your mobile phone number, and not your registered email address you will get a text message instead of an iMessage if you have no data connection when a message is sent.\niMessage is designed to seamlessly integrate with the messages application on your iPhone. Once set up and configured, your device will automatically decide whether to send an iMessage or a text message when you send a message to a contact on your phone.\nBasically, when you compose a message and click send, your device checks with Apple to see if the recipient has iMessage enabled for their device. If they do, your iPhone will attempt to send your text to them via iMessage.\nYour iPhone will then wait for a notification from apple that this message has been delivered. If this notification is received your message will have \"Delivered\" written under your message. \nHowever, if the message is not delivered after a few minutes your iPhone will delete the iMessage, and send your text as a regular text message instead.\nIn the case of your example, your friends device would have attempted to send an iMessage, then after getting no delivery notification, would have sent you a text message instead.\nYou can ensure that an iMessage is always sent by composing your message to your friends iMessage registered email address instead of their phone number. \nYou can also set the \"Caller ID\", that your phone sends when it sends an iMessage, to your email address instead of your phone number in the Settings application. This will mean that your friend replies back to your email address instead of your phone number ensuring that only an iMessage is sent, as email addresses cannot receive regular text messages.\n", "Q: Web Sharing Can't Start It worked before, and I'm not sure when it stopped working, but I'm unable to start Web Sharing at the moment.  Attempting to start it from the Sharing screen results in \"Web Sharing Starting...\" immediately followed by \"Web Sharing: Off\".  I've tried reverting to the httpd.conf in /etc/apache2/original, but the result is the same.\nWhat else could I try?\n\nA: First, take the time to check your httpd.conf with:\nsudo apachectl configtest\n\nIf it's all ok, then try to restart Apach once or twice (look at the log):\nsudo apachectl start (or restart)\n\nIt worked for me. If it still doesn't start try finding another default httpd.conf\n\nA: In /usr/lib there is a file libpq.5.3.dylib\nwhile apache looks for libpq.5.dylib.\nAfter I copied the file and named it libpq.5.dylib it worked.\n\nA: There are a couple of solutions in the Apple Support Forums. I remember having the same problems and I think the module was the problem.\n\nA: Run this Terminal command to symlink the different versions of libpq:\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/libpq.5.3.dylib /usr/lib/libpq.5.dylib\n\n", "Q: How do you md5 an entire disk in OS X? I want to validate a \"dd\" image of a USB disk in OS X using the terminal.

I am OS X Lion.\n\nA: If you are not trying to checksum disk the running system resides on (this won't ever be consistent) you may try\n\ndd if=/dev/disk2 | md5 -\n\n\nA: You could mount both filesystems (read-only, if possible) and then recursively checksum each file.  \nEDIT:\nexample command:\ncd /Volumes/xyz\nfind . -type f -exec md5 {} \\; | cut -c15- > log1.txt \n15 in this case is the string length of /Volumes/xyz or what ever your mount point is.\nDo this on both file systems and make sure the filenames do not have the starting root path (by using cut).  Then use the 'diff' command to compare the 2 files.\n\nA: Hmm...Is the dd image functional?  \nWhat you are seeing might be a result of the dd command possibly putting some junk at the tail end of the transfer so that you get a copy of an even number of records. \nYou do not say, but it is assummed that you are dd'ing/md5'ing a quiet/unmounted/unused disk to make the image file.\n\nA: I know this question is old, but I thought for other people that may read this they would find this helpful... I found that OS X is mounting and writing to the volume immediately upon dd completing. This makes it impossible to checksum the newly written volume and compare with the file. I had to use a forensics tool call DiskArbitrator to prevent volumes from being mounted after dd completes. This allows there to be time to checksum the volume before spotlight messes it up.\n", "Q: iPod Touch WiFi strength declining Over the last few weeks I have noticed that some WiFi access points just aren't registering on my iPod Touch. It used to connect to my home WiFi as soon as I pulled up in the car outside, and got that 'meep' noise as emailed synced.\nNow whenever I turn it on, it doesn't always connect to the Access Point. Even when it is connected the signal strength is only 1 bar, whereas before it was always full(ish) strength. The Access Point is 8 feet away outside my bedroom, on the landing.\nI don't know if it's related but about 4 months ago the iPod Touch went down the toilet. So I washed it with plenty of clean water, and left in a tub of silica gel type stuff for a few days before charging and it's worked pretty much fine ever since. Apart from one brief episode a couple of months ago when the screen was flashing between the icons and a full white display for a few seconds.\nThanks in advance for any suggestions / recommendations.\n\nA: Sounds like corrosion in either the antenna or antenna connection.  If you are a DIY-type, you could open it up, check it, and perhaps fix it if it is the antenna connection.  Otherwise, time for a new Touch.\n\nA: I lost the damn thing now.\nI was going to look into a 'refurbishment programme' that I believe Apple did, but isn't widely publicised.\n", "Q: Change an AT&T iPhone 3G to another provider? How can I change my no-longer under AT&T service iPhone 3G to my new sprint service? Sprint doesn't use sim cards. \n\nA: You can't.  AT&T and Sprint use incompatible technologies.\n", "Q: Quadruple contacts on my iPhone 4S I sync'd the contact of my old iPhone 3G with my yahoo mail contacts. That worked ok for while, then at some point all the the Yahoo contacts were duplicated (every contact appeared twice in my contacts list) on the iPhone. This was annoying, but I could not find a quick fix, so I lived with it. \nYesterday I bought a 4S and set up my various accounts and set up iCloud. Now the phone has 4 copies of my yahoo contacts. I don't know that point during the setup the contacts got duped(again). \nNow I want to clean it all up. How?\nEdit in response to comment. There are two copies of each contact in the yahoo account.and two copies in the iCloud account. And 4 copies in \"all contacts\". \n\nA: You can sign up to google voice and sync with google voice and them go on desk top link onto your gv account and press get rid of duplicates \n", "Q: Long time ago I bound my right shift key to F3, how can I undo that? Basically, my shift key is being random. A long time ago, I set it to act like F3 (whatever that's called), and undid it. Now it's doing it again. How can I change it back to just shift? I can't seem to find the correct option in System Preferences>Keyboard>Keyboard shortcuts\n\nA: I did exactly as you described recently and you are right that there seems to be no trace to go back to that function to undo it. After talking to several Mac users, including store staff, it got resolved by trial and error by an Apple Store senior support person;\nhe expressed himself that it was an odd solution to the problem and that the key mapping may be faulty but it worked.\nNone of the people I talked to are aware of this capability to alter the function of the right shift key; if it wasn't for your post, they would have convinced me that there was no such function. Anyway, this is what he did:\n\n\n*\n\n*go to System Preferences, then Exposé/Spaces.\n\n*in Exposé, for the \"Application Windows\" setting, choose \"-\"\n\n\nA: On a Mac, Shift functions similarly to Option or Command in that they are modifier keys. You generally cannot assign a shortcut to just one of those keys. They must be used in concert with another (ie. Shift + Option + X).\nRegardless of memory on how it was assigned, if it has reverted to incorrect function, and your keyboard is configured properly for QWERTY English, you may have a corrupted preferences file. The easiest way to determine how deep the issue runs is to test this in another User account.\n", "Q: How can I move files by using the keyboard only? I'm looking for some kind of a utility that lets me select a file(s) and then say hit a command key and then move to a difference directory and hit the command key again and have those files moved to the new location.\nI think I have seen some similar apps where you could drop files onto a dock icon to gather them but I cant recall the names.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Have a look at Move files using just keyboard in Mac Finder? for a discussion of the same topic, listing a lot of options.\nAssuming you are running Lion you can move files by using Cmd-C to pick them up and Cmd-Opt-V to move them to the target location. \n", "Q: How to activate mod_rewrite on MacOSX Lion I tried to activate the mod_rewrite module in the httpd.conf, but I do not succeed to make it work.\nI'm running Lion, and my goal is to do URL rewriting in ~USER/Sites/mysite\nCan someone help me please?\n\nA: You need to add a conf file to the following dir\n/etc/apache2/users/yourname.conf\n<Directory \"/Users/yourname/Sites/\">\n     Options Indexes MultiViews\n     AllowOverride All\n     Order allow,deny\n     Allow from All\n</Directory>\n\n", "Q: Many programs notify me that \"grep/sed/uname/... not found\"; some run, some don't.

So, we've been purchasing everything twice (or 3 times in some cases).  We want to share music, apps, etc but how?  Home sharing is turned on...I even asked an apple \"genius\" and he had no idea how to share content with multiple apple logins but all managed on one computer.  Any help would be appreciated!\n\nA: Sharing apps is actually pretty easy.\nOn your iDevice, just go to Settings > Store and sign into the account you want to download purchased apps from, and then when you go to install them, it will act like it's going to purchase them again, start to download, and then pop up a dialog saying you've already purchased this app, click OK to download again for Free.\nI do this on a weekly basis with 2 other accounts and have been doing it for over a year so I know it works.  Even on iOS 5.0.\nJust be careful to switch to the right accounts when you make your purchases.  Since it does not necessarily say that you have already purchased the app, you could look up the wrong app (a HD universal version instead of the normal version, for instance) and end up purchasing it by mistake. \nFinally, note that you could sign into your alternate Store account, then go to App Store >  Updates > Purchased and see a list of what's available for download on that account, BUT NOTICE that this will LOCK your device to THAT account's past Purchases for the next 90 days!  \nSee: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4627\n\"When you turn on Automatic Downloads or download past purchases on an iOS device or computer, your device or computer will be associated with your Apple ID.

How can I get rid of this problem?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Finally got it. I was pressing option keys lot of times and pressing it 5 times enables mouse keys (which disables keyboard keys).\nTo reverse, go to \"Settings -> Accessibility -> Mouse and Trackpad\" and uncheck \"Press the option key five times to turn Mouse keys on of off\" or simply uncheck \"Enable Mouse Keys.\"\n\nA: Note:  This issue (function keys only working) can occur using the Apple wireless keyboard with an iPad as well.  Unfortunately, iPads don't have the same Accessibility settings mentioned above.  Replacing the wireless keyboard batteries (thus powering it down completely) and disconnecting/reconnecting the keyboard connection did NOT have any effect correcting this problem.  However, powering down the iPad completely seemed to do the trick; after cold boot of iPad, the standard keyboard keys were re-enabled.\n", "Q: How can I keep track of source code changes with git and box.net? I have a school project where I have to make a program(java), therefore I need some way to keep track of the changes I make to the sources; I decided the best way to do this it to create a git repository on my box.net account. How is this done?\n\nA: Go with Git. If you want a GUI client take a look at Gitbox (paid) or Github for Mac (free)\n\nA: The best version control system I have tried is GIT together with GitHub.\nIf you are just a single developer that works on a project then SVN is okayish.

While working on the wording for another question, I wanted to refer to the parts of the Apple environment which are, by design, the same in Lion and in iOS 5.  \nFor example, it is reasonable to expect that the available relationship types will be the same for iOS 5 Contacts and Lion Address Book.  It is surprising that Siri understands son, but that iOS 5 Contacts knows only child; this is attributable to Siri's beta status.\nFor items that sync in iCloud, Lion and iOS 5 probably use a single canonical structure specification or separate structure specifications which are kept conformant by engineering discipline.\nWhat is the name of the set to which these item's structures belong?  Would one write \"the iCloud address book entry format\", \"the Mac address book entry format\", \"the Winesap1 address book entry format\", or what?\n\n1speculative\n\nA: I happen to be writing a book on iCloud now, and I've had to deal with some of these issues. It's instructive to note that although the respective applications on Lion, iOS 5, and the iCloud Web site are Address Book, Contacts, and Contacts, respectively. They all are containers for one thing, which they use the same terminology: Contacts. \nI do not plan to use the terms you suggest above; rather, I am saying things like \"entering contacts in Address Book,\" \"entering contacts in Contacts,\" \"changing contacts on the iCloud Web site.\" It's the context that matters, since the set of data is the same, and enforced by syncing.\n", "Q: Which uses more battery when tethering - Wifi or BT on iPhone 4S? I'm not really bothered which is quicker - I'm guessing this is wifi anyway. I just want to know which would allow me to get the most life out of my iPhone 4S when tethering to it with may MBP. Thanks!\n\nA: Speed is primarily limited by your 3G network connection.\nBattery wise, Bluetooth should use less power (especially in the 4S) but the difference may be quite small anyway.\nIf you tether it with a MBP you may be better of with using the cable between iPhone and computer.\n\nA: Although Bluetooth might use less instantaneous power, it will be slower and thus leave the radios turned on longer.  Having the cellular radio turned on for data tethering will burn the most power by far, especially if you are far from the nearest cell tower.\n\nA: I am writing this from a taxi cab between Baltimore and DC. Bluetooth connection between iPad and iPhone 4s giving me over 500kb speed up and down. Last hour use took less than 5% of the battery on either device. Wifi uses a lot more.\n", "Q: Cmd+Tab switches to the correct space, but doesn't bring app up to front I have a problem (bug?) with application switching on Lion.\nI use two Spaces. Say one has Postbox open, and another has Firefox and Vim.\nVim is in the foreground, and Firefox's window is behind it.\nWhen I Cmd+Tab from Postbox to Firefox, the space is switched correctly, but Firefox remains in the background.\nIf I Cmd+Tab to Firefox again, or select it in the Dock, the window comes up front normally.\nThe bug isn't limited to Firefox only, seen it with many apps.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: I agree with jerseyboy, it is pretty much a bug.  So, under Lion 10.7.3, in mail, I switch to safari, which is in a different space.  Then I switch back to mail, and the space duly switches to where I was.  However, the window that was previously on top is now hidden behind terminal and a few other windows I have open on that space.  This is an annoying interference in rapid switching between applications.\nOne slightly less awkward approach to get the application back to the front again is to cmd-tab to the application in question, release (which switches to the right space), and then hit cmd-tab cmd-shift-tab (faking a switch to another application but actually going back to the same one).  This sequence is really awkward being 3 combos when one ought to be enough.  Come on Apple, at least let us select this behavior in system prefs or a mysterious plist command line thingy.\n\nA: KeyRemap4Macbook allows remapping command+tab to command+tab+option, if you want this to be the default behavior. It also has some very cool/powerful customizations like remapping keyboard shortcuts only for specific applications - e.g. remap command+tab in Firefox to control+tab to switch between browser tabs.\n\nA: It's a feature not a bug :-)\nStart tabbing with Cmd-Tab until you get to the application you want to switch to, then press and hold Option before releasing Cmd-Tab.\n\nA: To the original poster, you weren't doing anything wrong. \nWhether it was intended as a feature or not, it is clearly a usability issue, aka a bug. The problem is that often the affected app window was left stacked on top of all other windows, not behind them. Upon switching back and forth with Spaces Mission Control, the app often gets stuck under other open windows. \nThe finger-twisting CMD-TAB-OPTION-release fails more often than not: it either doesn't do anything differently or it is impossible to accomplish due to autorepeating keys, making it a worthless gesture. \nIt is definitely a bug, not a feature. Keep flipping back and forth with CMD-TAB, and the window will pop back to the top, then drop down again, erratically. \nOh, it doesn't appear to affect Spaces, so it seems to be a regression. \n", "Q: How can I average numbers using Soulver? I have a license for the excellent app, Soulver. I'd like to use it to find the average of some integers. I'd like to do something like:\navg(199, 262, 219, 268, 285, 293)\n\nHowever, that doesn't work:\n\nAny suggestions on how to do this with Soulver?\n\nA: Soulver doesn't let you do this with an operation, but there are a few ways to do it. First of all, there's the old fashioned way:\n\nAdd your numbers up (in parentheses) and then divide by the number of numbers.\nThere's also a more automated but less convenient way. Soulver can calculate the average of the results (blue column) that are currently in your document:\n\nBut, if you want to use that average later, you'll have to do a bit more.\nSelect Average, then click on Copy Selected Statistic.\nAdd a new line to your Soulver document: avg = and then paste in the average. You now have an average that you can rever to via avg:\n\n\nA: Soulver can only calculate the average of the results in the right column. To display you have to click on the \"Total:\" in the bottom line of the window:\n\n", "Q: Mail autocomplete is different for search and compose It annoys me that Mail “To” field autocomplete doesn't match that of the search bar.\nWhen I start typing name of a person I've had conversation with in the search bar, I can see their full name along with the address. Clearly, Mail knows about them.\n\nWhen I hit Compose and start typing in “To” field, I see a tiny loading wheel image appearing on the right for a fraction of second—and then, nothing, no autocomplete, no suggestions. \n\nThe search field looks among all the people you've ever talked to  but the compose form only offers your address book contacts.\nCan I change it to work the same way as Search bar, or do I have to add each person in my address book to have them in autocomplete?\nI'm using Gmail.\n\nA: The difference in autocomplete stems from the fact there is no “Mail knows about”. The lookup happens on two different sets of data:\n\n\n*\n\n*Autocomplete in search happens on the Spotlight index of all received and sent mails in Mail.app’s database (since version 2 of Mail.app).\n\n*Autocomplete on compose happens on Mail.app’s potential recipients list, which is a compound of contacts with an email address in Addressbook and a list of previous recipients stored by Mail.app (a list you can see and edit under Window » Previous Recipients).\n\n\nNotice the difference: search knows about people you have only received mail from, compose does not. Hence different autocomplete results.\n", "Q: Static IP address per wifi connection? Configuration in router doesn't seem to take, am I doing it wrong? I have a MacBook Pro, and a home WIFI setup that I'd like to assign a very specific IP address to the MBP on.\nThe router is a Jensen Airlink AL59300, and it has the ability to assign static IP addresses of up 16 devices through their MAC address.\nSo I added my MBP's MAC address and assigned it an address.\nHowever, how do I get my MBP to get that address now? If I simply enter the network preferences and click on the Renew Lease button, it gets the same, dynamic, address every time. Well, sometimes the router has assigned addresses differently, probably due to timing of reconnects, but my MBP never gets the address I set it up with, it always gets a new one from the dynamic pool.\nIf I set up the IP address manually on my Mac, is that per WIFI connection? Or is the IP address common for all the WIFI networks? Meaning, if I configure my MBP to have 192.168.0.199, and then connect to WIFI at work, will it then try to use that same address there, or can I use dynamic DHCP there, or even assign a different IP address on that network?\n\nA: The airport settings go by location, not which of the possible SSID you join, so make a home (or Jensen) location and use manual IP or DHCP with manual address to get things going. \nCheck your firewall as it can block DHCP responses, but I'd guess the router has issues before the Mac, but something is broken for it not to just work. \n", "Q: How to share internet connection via thunderbolt? I have a recent iMac and will buy a new MacBook Air.\nAnd I'm finding fastest way to connect internet to the Air. Wi-Fi is still too slow and USB-Ethernet converter offers only 100-Mbit speed. But both of them have Thunderbolt port, so I expected internet sharing via the port. It could be fantastic.\nBut I couldn't fine any way to do that. In configuration panel, it shows only old options like Firewire. Is sharing internet connection via Thunderbolt possible? If it is, how can I do this?\n\nA: I don't think you can do this. Thunderbolt doesn't really have a \"native\" protocol like Firewire or Ethernet, it's just fancy PCIe transport. It might be possible in the future, but it would require Apple to add the functionality.\nHowever it's worth noting that it's unlikely Thunderbolt would speed up your connection at all. Unless you have a seriously heavy duty internet connection (think corporate/university fiber), the limiting factor in your internet speeds won't be the connection between local machines, it's the cable/dsl your ISP provides. It's possible wifi could be limiting if you have a bad connection with a lot of interference, but most wifi should be able to keep up with your internet connection.\n\nA: Now OS X(Mavericks) supports Thunderbolt networking just like any other networking interfaces. Then, you can share internet just like any other interfaces.\nAnyway Thunderbolt interface is pretty picky, then sometimes you will not able to make connection. I don't know why, but if established, it provides at least 100MiB/s bandwidth! I expect this is limited by HDD in my iMac, and if I have both SSD, it will be even more faster.\n\nA: I believe it is possible.\nBut it's a bit bulky since it comes with a 27 inch display attached.\nMaybe there will be other options later but don't expect them to be cheap since it will have to use Thunderbolt chips.\n\nA: It would be just as easy for Apple to emulate a PCIe adapter as it is for Parallels, VMWare, Xen, Virtualbox or any of the others to emulate it.  They haven't.  My guess it's because not enough people have complained about it.  Write your congressman.\nThere's no reason that the other peripherals such as sound from an iMac cannot be shared (again, look at Parallels or Fusion).\nFWIW, the reason I want this is because I currently have to plug three cables into my Macbook to do target display mode on my iMac.  I should only have to do two -- the Thunderbolt and the power cable.\nApple has patented the ability to put fiber optic over the middle pin of the power cable, presumably for Thunderbolt.  If that worked with Ethernet and sound over Thunderbolt, one could simply connect a single MagSafe.  \n", "Q: How do I find out the hostname of my Mac OS X server? I'm trying to connect with mysql_connect using PHP.\nI was wondering how to find the hostname when I turn my MacBook into a server by turning on the personal webpage. \nI have Apache, MySQL and PHP enabled. \nIs the hostname what you ssh into? It says that my computer's name is spiderman and it could be accessed with spiderman.local, but it doesn't seem to work. I've also tried using my IP address.\n\nA: In general, you get the hostname by typing\necho $HOSTNAME \n\nin Terminal.\nBut for your server setup, if no one has messed with configuration, localhost will be the hostname to use; in safe mode, localhost:3306 (that is port 3306) is the default. \n(cf. http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-connect.php )\nBUT: You should make sure that you actually started the MySQL server. Starting command depends on your installation.\n\nA: In a terminal run the command:\n$ hostname\n\nThe environment variable $HOSTNAME may not necessarily be set.\n\nA: If you want to connect to MySQL running locally, try 127.0.0.1 or localhost. \n\nA: It depends if you are doing it from within a script program where the environment has been set up correctly, either the following may work or suit you:\n~$ uname -n\nroberts.e.co.za\n~$ echo $HOSTNAME\nroberts.e.co.za\n\n\nA: System Preferences.app > Sharing > Computer Name\n\n", "Q: How can I schedule sending the day’s iCal events via email? I followed this tutorial on creating a workflow using Automator that will email the events of the day from iCal to an email address.\nI would like this to be executed every morning at, say 4am, so it is in my inbox when I wake up. What would be the best way to do this? I was thinking of perhaps creating a daily iCal event to execute the workflow, but then wouldn't that event also be included in the email?\n\nA: The easiest way to schedule a workflow is to use iCal for the scheduling: if you have followed the steps of the tutorial you linked to to the letter and have saved the workflow as an iCal reminder, Automator will have added a new event named like your workflow to a local calendar called “Automator” (creating it if it does’t exist yet). This event has a reminder set to execute the workflow 0 minutes before the event.\nTo execute it every day on 4 a.m., just schedule the event that way (you could also set it to only repeat on weekdays – or to anything iCal will let you do with a scheduled event). To make sure the triggering event itself is not included, make sure the “Filter iCal Calendar” action (the 1st step of your workflow) excludes the “Automator” calendar – either because filter conditions will bypass it anyway, or by setting a filter condition to “Name is not Automator”.\nYou can hide the “Automator” calendar from displaying in iCal by unchecking its checkbox in iCal’s calendar list, thus making your workflow execute invisibly for all practical purposes. Also note iCal does not need to run for the event to be triggered, but you must be logged in and the computer should not be sleeping (a workaround for that last gotcha is to set the machine to wake up shortly before the scheduled time in Power Saving System Settings – this would also be necessary if you scheduled with launchd or cron). The actual workflow is to be found in ~/Library/Workflows/Applications/iCal and can be set to a “open file” reminder on any event, should you ever need to do so.\n", "Q: Is there a difference between the \"configurable\" and installable memory limit? On Apple's iMac page, it says:\n\nConfigurable to 8GB (all models) or 16GB (select models)\n\nHowever both Apple's iMac: How to remove or install memory page and Crucial.com indicate that all of the 2011 iMac models are configurable to 16 GB. Does the above quote simply mean than select models are only configurable to 16 GB on the Apple online store? If I buy the $1200 iMac (MC309LL/A), I should be able to install 16 GB of RAM bought separately from Crucial, correct?\n\nA: Correct. You may even upgrade it to 32GB.\n\nA: Apple offers CTO and will let you fill your iMac (Late 2011) with RAM modules sized at 2 GB and 4 GB each. \nFrom Apple, the entry level MC309LL/A has two RAM slots so you can take it to 8 GB (2 x 4 GB SO-DIMM) but many reputable vendors are selling 8 GB modules that seem to work well and without issue on that hardware - 16 GB (2 x 8 GB SO-DIMM).\nThe rest of the Late 2011 iMacs have 4 RAM slots, so you can take them to 32 GB (4 x 8 GB SO-DIMM) even though Apple intends / configures / supports / recommends a max of 16 GB (4 x 4 GB SO-DIMM) for the rest of the lineup.\n", "Q: Glitchy behavior with my Magic Trackpad My Magic Trackpad (on a 2011 iMac) keeps randomly clicking, which causes random text selects, etc. Also the cursor seems glitchy while it's happening too, it'll slow down and erratically move around.\nI'm not using any extra tools like BetterTouchTool, and it's worked fine for the past few months since I got it. I've tried new batteries and a new OS X user account.\nAnyone know what the issue could be? Is it a known issue, should I just ring Apple to get a replacement?\nEDIT: Just tried it on Windows via Bootcamp, and it does the same thing, so it must be a hardware problem.\n\nA: Turns out it was a hardware issue. Got a replacement from Apple, and it works fine!\n\nA: I had this happen just the other day! Suddenly my trackpad was stuck \"dragging\". I couldn't click. I could right-click (two finger tap), but I couldn't normal-click. And when I tried, it locked down a drag point and I was selecting everything under it. \nAnd then also occasionally it would fire a mouse click when I bumped my desk. I could literally drop my fist on my desk and fire a mouse click. I knew I had to deal with this when I deleted an email in Mail.app and then took a phone call, leaving the mouse pointer over the trashcan button. I sort of paced around my office talking (like I do), and when I got back to my desk.... inbox zero!\nTurns out my KEYBOARD was failing. The shift key was getting stuck down (hence the sticking in select mode) and somehow it was also submitting mouse clicks. I've had that keyboard for quite a while, eaten lots of lunches over it, etc. I replaced it, and it's been flawless ever since.\nTry unplugging your keyboard and see if the behavior persists. At first, I could plug it back in and it would behave for a while. Then even that quit working.\n\nA: I discovered that a small pile of computer screws near mine were somehow interfering. Removing the metal from the vicinity of the trackpad fixed the glitches.\nThis page also recommends giving the trackpad a physical click to wake it up: http://www.trackpadmagic.com/magic-trackpad/help/slow-mouse-pointer\n\nA: I’ve only experienced something similar in two cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*after enabling tip-tap to select with locking (it’s in the Assistive System Preferences) before actually mastering the tip-tap :). \n\n*when there was interference on the Bluetooth channel. In my case, the Trackpad didn’t agree with a pair of wireless headphones (I ended up shutting the trackpad off whenever I used the headphones). Check for any other device broadcasting on the 2.4 GHz band. Also, insufficiently shielded electrical devices can run high frequency interference.\nIf neither of these match your case, the Trackpad itself might be behaving erratically. Try unpairing it from the Mac (shut it off, connect a mouse, delete the trackpad from the list of known devices in the Bluetooth System Preferences), putting fresh batteries in and then pairing it again.\nFinally, try using the trackpad with another Mac if you have the option – considering your other question, it is entirely possible the iMac is acting up, not the trackpad, be it from external interference or a hardware problem.\n", "Q: iPhoto crashes on import Every time I import photos with iPhoto, it crashes!\n\n\n*\n\n*I have no idea how to diagnose.

I know the basics of the Season Pass from the iTunes store for current TV shows - you can buy the pass in either HD or SD. Episodes that are currently available will download immediately, and future episodes will enter your download queue as they become available.\nIt looks like there is a slight discount for buying by the season, which I definitely like. I'd like to be able to do the season path math, but I do not know how to determine how many episodes for a season. A typical network season airs 23 episodes for a given show. So The Good Wife in HD, for example, costs 52.99 for Season 3. If 23 shows are delivered the cost is 2.30 per episode a discount of .69 per episode, or a savings of 15.78 on the season. But what if it is cancelled after only 10 episodes? Did I just pay 5.30 per episode? Will I get a refund?\nI know this situation is unlikely on a show like The Good Wife, but it possible on this show and even likely on some new shows. Please do not answer with speculation, if you have personal experience with this issue, or can find an apple support document on this topic (my google search was not fruitful) I would appreciate it.\nI have asked this question of Apple Support and I will post their answer if I do not get a definitive answer here.\n\nA: It is stated in the terms and conditions that you get a credit for the pro-rated shortfall should the studio fail to deliver the quantity of episodes you purchased. \nRetail price means the price you paid divided equally by the episodes promised and not whatever a la carte pricing might also be available outside the bundled pass price. \n", "Q: How can I determine what is causing my iPhone to buzz? I recently got an iPhone 4 (with iOS5). I almost never have the ringer on, so the phone is mute and alerts (like incoming calls) come with a buzz. Periodically, while the phone is idle and no call in coming, the phone buzzes. I figure this results from some notification, however no recent notification shows up in the notification finder, nor have I recently received any emails. \nHow can I figure out what is causing these alerts?\n\nA: Go to Settings->Notifications on your iPhone and then look in the section Not In Notification Center. If there are any apps listed there, you can see if notification is turned on or off for them. If any are turned on, you can turn them off one by one to see which one is trying to get your attention.\nYou may also be able to see badge numbers changing on one of your apps which would be a clue that there might be a notification too.\n", "Q: What is \"memory swapping\" in Fusion? In VMware's RAM setting, if allocated memory goes higher than the recommended maximum, it warns \"if higher, memory swapping may occur\".  \nWhat is \"memory swapping\" in this context? And what will I see?\n\nA: It means the virtual memory for the virtual machine may be swapped to disk, massively slowing down both the guest and the host computers.  \nIf you need to know about \"swapping\" in general, well, I was going to point you to the Wikipedia page on it, but that redirects to a page on \"paging\" which is caught up in some geek war about the difference between swapping, paging, segments, and even overlays, so it may be more work than it is worth to understand it from there.  The article on Virtual Memory is easier to read, but in a different kind of Wiki-unhappiness.  \nThe short story is that if you only have 4GB of memory but want to run 4 programs, each of which wants to use 2GB of memory, the OS can let you do that by suspending the programs you are not using and saving the state of their memory to disk in a section of the disk called the \"swap space\".  When computers such as laptops do that with the whole OS, we now call it \"hibernating\".  When it was first done to entire individual applications while the system is running, lots of people called it \"swapping\" because you were swapping one active process for another. Now it's done differently, with small blocks of memory called \"pages\" rather than whole applications, and lots of other optimizations (and consequent complications), but it's the same general idea. \nIf anyone has better reference material to point to, please add them to this answer, but please read them first and make sure they are appropriate for those not-so-few ordinary Mac users who do not much care about the details of how computers work. \n", "Q: How to drag and drop between guests in VMware Fusion My host is Mac OS X 10.6, and on my VWware Fusion, I have Windows 7 and Windows XP as my guest. I can drag and drop files between my guest and my host, but not between my guests (cannto drag and drop files between Windows 7 and Windows XP). Is it possible?\n\nA: No you cannot as of, and up to VMWare 4 drag and drop files between VMware guests directly. VMware's tools are only noted to support drag and drop between the guest and the Host Operating system (a.k.a. the Mac in this Case), there is no mention of guest to guest support for drag and drop as noted in the VMware fusion documentation.\n\nMoving and Copying Files and Text Between Virtual Machines and Your Mac\nYou can drag files and folders to move and copy them between your virtual machines and your Mac.\nYou can move text by copying and pasting or cutting and pasting.\nYou can also drag images between Windows applications and Mac applications.\nYou can drag Outlook attachments from a Windows virtual machine to your Mac.\nYou can drag files in a virtual machine directly onto Mac applications.\nYou can copy and paste images and formatted text between a Windows or Linux virtual machine and your Mac.\nThese features require VMware Tools.\n\nThat quoted above is likely why drag and drop is not working between your Windows 7 and Windows XP guest virtual machines and that is because it is simply not supported.\nA quick fix is to drag the files to the Mac host first, then drag to the other VM. Otherwise setting up File Sharing between the VMs may be the best way to transfer files directly between VMs without having to go though the host first.\n\nA: Are you using Fast User Switching on XP?

I have the iPad the most (and utilize it's deeper features most), and want to start benefiting more from Notifications Center. At this point, when I open up notification center it lists all new messages for all of the accounts stored on the iPad, which is distracting for me. I just want to see my new messages at a glance.\nI've set just my accounts to fetch automatically every 15 minutes, but as soon as I've opened the mail app, then all of the other unread messages populate in the notification list. Is there any way to control which accounts get sent to Notification center? \nI'm imagining no, but maybe someone has an idea.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the Mail configuration in Notification Center does not currently allow for the selection of individual email accounts (assuming that your device isn't jailbroken).\n", "Q: Verifying my email address for AppleID: Where is the verification link?

Since address book doesn't consider nickname as a name when sorting, contacts with no first/last name end up and the end of the address book as unnamed. What I do is I put the nickname as the first name. And that works flawlessly. But whenever I reply to an email from a person that exists in my address book as a first-name-is-nickname it updates the contact information with the last name based on the From/Reply-To header in the email.\nHow do I prevent this?\n-- edit --\nNo solutions here so far so I've posted the same question on Apple Communities.\n\nA: I believe the solution to the problem is to prevent Mail.app from tracking Previous Recipients. To permanently disable this feature you have to use this terminal command:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail SuppressAddressHistory -bool true\n\nOnce you've done that, make sure you delete your Previous Recipients history. To do this, in Mail.app, open up Previous Recipients window (Windows > Previous Recipients), select all existing records present there and hit \"Remove From List\".\nFrom now on, your Address Book will not get updated by Mail.app.\nNote, that this will change the way address autocompletion works in Mail.app. From now on only addresses present in your Address Book (and optionally in LDAP if configured) will be auto-completed. Previous Recipients which are not present in your Address Book will not be auto-completed.\nThe whole problem seems to be quite unusual for Apple standards. A hidden and undocumented sync feature, with no obvious way to disable.\n", "Q: Instant send feature in quicksilver I just switched back to quicksilver and I was wondering if there is an instant send feature in QS like Launchbar.\nin Launchbar, you can define a hotkey which will send the selected file/folder as a context to launchbar, and you can perform an action on it like open in TextMate.\n\nA: There are several ways to use the currently selected thing (files/folders in finder, selected text in other applications, ...) in Quicksilver.\nThere is the ⌘⎋ (command-escape) shortcut. It opens the Quicksilver interface with the selected thing in the first pane\nOr you can open the Quicksilver interface and use the \"Current Selection\" proxy object. That does the same thing as above, but when the interface is already active. For that, you need to activate \"Enable advanced features\" in Preferences -> Application.\nUsing the \"Current Selection\" proxy object, you can also make your own triggers that use the thing that's selected at the time you use the trigger. Check out the Quicksilver Manual somewhere around page 38 for more information on that.\n", "Q: SYNC-Bluetooth Audio 'jumbled' on car start I have an iPhone 4 and a 2011 Mustang with SYNC. The system works fairly well (outside Of the connection issues many others have experienced) but I have an annoying problem whenever I start my vehicle (maybe 95% of the time).\nUpon starting the vehicle, Bluetooth Audio comes on and begins playing my music from my phone. However, for the first ten seconds or so, the sound is jumbled/garbled in a peculiar way: it's really sped up for a second or so, and then silent for a second or so, then sped up etc. It does this cycle about 3-5 times before it finally starts playing normally. If I'm listening to a Car Talk podcast, it might sound something like this:\n\"Yourelisteningtoc............artalkonnation............alpublicradiowithcl.............ickandclackthetap............pet brothers, and on today's show...\"\nIt's like pinching a hose for a second, and then letting go and having a bunch of words come out at once, then pinching it again.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Generally when a vehicle cranks the engine there is a lot of stress on the electrical system, in some cases the power supply to ECUs, such as the SYNC module or the ACM can go below the minimum required for them to function, so straight after a crank they can be doing a lot of initialising processes at the same time as trying to play your audio.\nI'm sure that the SYNC module uses a 400MHz processor, which isn't really that powerful compared to modules that other automotive manufacturers are using.\n", "Q: High quality drivers for Huawei E160X modem? I am using a Huawei E160X mobile dongle on OS X (10.6.8). I am connecting via Orange in the UK using the driver/GUI which is supplied on the device (it's rebranded Huawei software, I believe). If it helps, it is Internet Everywhere 2.0 (build: 090924.164852).\nUnfortunately, this software is terrible. It opens the Orange home page upon every connection, and this \"feature\" cannot be turned off. It dumps errors every few seconds into the logs, and has a memory leak that means its memory consumption rises to 500MB-1GB if left on for an extended period of time.\nI tend to prefer OS-based or open source drivers for modems, since they are less likely to contain phone-home or diagnostic transmission features. However a good googling has not revealed any such thing - any ideas?

I'm sure the fellow who wrote TinkerTool, which lets me change the Finder title bar font among other things, is a fine fellow and surely TinkerTool is not malware. Nevertheless... I want to change the Finder font without installing software. Is there a way to do it from the command line?\nThanks.\n\nA: Got it. It's in ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist\nModify the following entry:\n<key>NSTitleBarFontSize</key>\n<integer>11</integer>\n\nwith your desired font size. This file actually contains a lot of your system's preferences, from your locale setting, to the antialias threshold, to the scrollbar behavior.

At the moment none of my devices are syncing because it insists I set up a new me.com account - help!!!!\n\nA: You need to clarify your questions a little, but it sounds like you are trying to set up a new iCloud account directly on your iOS devices, and wanting to use your own Mobile Me account as the template (as it were).\nThe best way to do this, is to go to a computer and log into me.com using your Mobile Me account to verify it's still active. From there, you can move your MobileMe account to iCloud by visiting me.com/move. \nYou also will want to read over two articles that discuss FAQ about the transition...\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating an iCloud account: Frequently Asked Questions\n\n*Apple IDs and iCloud\nOnce complete, you will then be able to include your iCloud details during the account setup on your iOS device, and it should just work as the existing me.com address will already be converted to an iCloud one.\n", "Q: iCloud PhotoStream syncing to seperate Windows devices with shared App/Music/iTunes sync I have been asked to help out with a friends iTunes/iOS/Phot syncing setup, they have 4 iOS devices (all iOS 5 compatible except one 3G iPhone) and a range of iTunes libraries that they have previously synced to.\nWhat they want to acheive is to share an Apple ID for purchases from the App Store, and also all sync to a single iTunes library on a shared Windows PC for music syncing etc.  This bit is simple enough.\nWhere it get's complicated is that want to be able to maintain their photos seperately on their own PCs (no Macs anywhere...sigh).  I know that previously in Windows you could select a folder to sync pics to (as a crappy iPhoto replacement) and there was also some vague album support from a couple of Windows Apps (Photoship Elements?), but they dont have any of the apps.  I also know about the Scanner & Camera Wizard/Windows Live Photo wizard also, which may still be the only option for the 3G iPhone which will not support iOS5, and thus iCloud accounts (I think this is true, corrections welcomed).\nWhat I want to propose to them, if possible, is to use the single Apple ID and sync to a single iTunes library for music/apps/backups etc for all devices, but each have their own iCloud account, and use Photo Stream to  keep their photos seperate and not have them all sync to the same shared PC that the iTunes software runs on.\nI have no idea how Photostream works on a Windows machine, it is possible to log into iCloud through a control panel widget like you did with Mobile Me on Windows, and sign into iCloud and turn on Photostream to sync photos (either to a folder, or an app) on a per iCloud account basis, allowing them to all sync photos to their individual machines while keeping the iTunes sync relationship to a shared device?\n(Note, the Apple ID/Music bit is included for reference and completeness, I am only querying the capabilities of iCloud/Photostream, and would appreciate replies on that, not any suggestions to do anything different with the Apps/Music bit - just setting expactations, thanks)\n\nA: Simple.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use one AppleID for purchasing.\n\n*Use one or many computers to download this content. Remember that iTunes can sync apps to computer A and music to computer B and photos to computer C. Each person can decide to join the communal computer for App syncing / backup / downloading without it affecting their Photo browsing.\n\n*If they each get an iCloud account and use it for the rest - they can use the iCloud software on their PC to get the pictures or sync manually like any other photo device connected via USB.\n\n\nI haven't tested it, but WiFI sync might also be available on the PC side of iTunes.

If I accidentally delete a photo from my Photo Stream (or get a corrupted disk or lose a laptop) and later want to recover that picture from the online Photo Stream that has my pictures stored for 30 days in full resolution, how do I do that?\nI tried turning the Photo Stream on and off, and it does not download the existing pictures again. If the photos are being stored for 30 days, it would be a natural thing to want to re-download on-demand. The current way it works seems like the photos are stored for 30 days as long as any one registered device has not downloaded, but once all \"registered\" devices downloads it, it is removed. In this context a registered device is one that was signed in to iCloud BEFORE a picture is taken. Is this correct? \n\nA: For the PC the way I got it to redownload the photo stream is first go to Control Panel then open up iCloud control panel.\nTurn Photo Stream to off and close the iCloud control panel.\nJust as a precaution, rename the old Photo Stream folder just to have a backup of what was in there before.  This is up to you.\nThen go to C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer and rename the MediaStream folder to something like MediaStream-old.\nThen go back to Control Panel, open up iCloud control panel and renable the Photo Stream.\nIf you chose a custom download location for Photo Stream then you have to choose it again.  The photos should start coming in, but just remember it will only grab the last 1,000 photos you have taken.\nThanks.\n\nA: The only way I see so far that you can do this Directly is from a Mac.\nBy using iPhoto or Aperture to copy (drag N drop) the photo/s from a album back into Photostream.\nFrom an iOs device. Indirectly.\nif You have iPhoto you can select the photo and use the share button to add it to  Camera Roll. This will then add it to you normal iOs device photos.app and from there it will go into Photostream.\nIt does mean you will have a dupe in the Camera Roll.\nBut I cannot see away to add it back to Photostream directly in photos.app\n\nA: The simplest way to re-download your entire stream is to set up a second account on a Mac computer and fire up a clean iPhoto library.\nYou can turn on Photo Stream syncing and have it automatically import all photos. Once that is complete, you can export them to a shared folder or external drive and then delete the temporary account and all of it's data.\nOn your main account you can then turn on Photo Stream or not, but import the missing photos as desired from the export.\n\nA: If you are using a Mac and either iPhoto or Aperture, you can configure them to automatically copy any picture getting pushed through the stream into the local library. In iPhoto's Preferences this looks like\n\nOn a PC you can accomplish the same task by following the setup instructions.\nAs Apple recommends to toggle the Photo Stream settings to flush the stream it really seems to be the case that you can't redownload them easily.\n", "Q: iCloud: How can I create a calendar event for next 3 days for a specific time? Is there a quick way to make calendar events for 3 days in a row for like 8am to 4pm without having to make 3 seperate events?\nEg.  Make event for 8am to 4pm and repeat for next 3 days ONLY.\nCan't see anyway of doing this using the iPhone interface or the iCloud interface.\n\nA: Create an Event, and then select \"Repeat => Every Day\" and click \"Done\" - you'll now see a new option below \"Repeat\" called \"End Repeat\" where you then choose e.g. a date 3 days from today.\n\n\n\nA: Create a new event in iOS 5 Calender and select \"Repeat\":\n\nSet repeat to \"Daily\" and go back to \"Add Event\" dialog.

I wonder if is there any app for the iOS 5 that will let me edit the artist or title of my music?\nThe music is currently synced through iTunes and stored in the music app, but please let me know if there are any alternatives. I am open to jail breaking the device if there are no other alternatives.\n\nA: Given the rather strict sandboxing applied in iOS this is most probably impossible to achieve without jailbraking the device.\n\nA: To date, it is still not possible to edit song metadata on an iOS device, nor it be recommended if it was possible. Songs you get from sources directly onto the device (Spotify, GrooveShark, iTunes Store) all contain correct information. If you have damaged metadata inside media you've acquired elsewhere, look into software that will clean it up before syncing it over.\n\nA: Thumbgenius just released an app called TuneUp that does exactly this and more.\n\nA: To follow up on @patrix's answer, this Yahoo Answers post indicates that there isn't currently any app that will do it, even on a jailbroken device. This Stack Overflow post also indicates that there are no APIs to do this at the moment.\nHowever, there are music editors like Houkusai (iTunes link). In its app description, it claims to:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Import tracks from your iPod music library\n  \n\nHowever, it's likely to be overkill for what you're looking for, since it's meant to be a music editor and not as a track editor.\nIn summary, in a search for track/id3 editors, I've found only applications that will work on a computer, not on an iDevice.\n\nA: If you want do it with iOS program, you have to jailbreak it.\nAlso you can try iTunes, MediaMonkey or other same software\n\nA: YouTubetoMp3 - allows you to name artist, album, etc. metadata and then import to library, even if one already exists.\n", "Q: Is there an app to chat on Facebook on iOS?

Is there a safe, stable application for reading from and writing to ext4 file systems on Mac OS X?\nIf not, what's the best way to access the contents of an ext4 file system on Mac OS X?\n\nA: I had an ext4 formatted USB drive that I was able to mount after I installed osxfuse. Reading from it works great, but I am not sure if writing is safe.\nAlso, for moving files from OS X's filesystem (HFS+) to ext4, you may first want to remove those hidden .DS_Store files the OS X filesystem sneaks in as they occasionally cause bad inodes.\nfind /my/data/to/move -name '*.DS_Store' -type f -delete\n\nIt is better than having to fix them after with an fsck command.\n\nA: The answer depends on you willingness to invest in commercial software:\nIf you don’t mind spending some money on a commercial product, Paragon’s extFS for Mac will give you read and write access to ext2 / ext3 / ext4 file systems. The current version supports all versions of OS X / macOS from 10.10 upwards.\nIf you are looking for a free solution, you can setup a Linux virtual machine, mount your volume(s) there and share it / them via Samba or (S)FTP. This post has some details on how to achieve this using VirtualBox, a free virtual machine application. Note this is not exactly a lightweight solution, even if using a prebuilt VirtualBox VM will spare you installing and configuring a Linux distro from scratch.\n\nA: There is also e2fsprogs available in MacPorts. I haven't tested it yet myself but looks promising.\n\nA: Building on Ken's answer: I used fuse4x and fuse-ext2 successfully, and I recommend fuse-ext2 over ext4fuse. fuse-ext2 provides write access while ext4fuse provides only read access. Note that despite its name, fuse-ext2 supports EXT2/EXT3/EXT4.\next4fuse was a hassle for me, because it requires manual compilation and has no support for fuse4x options that would allow me to set access control. fuse-ext2 provides downloadable packages, and the 0.0.7 version worked just fine. I copied a few large ISOs over without any problem.\nEdit: It should be mentioned that as of 12/22, the fuse-ext2 Github page still lists unstable write support as a bug and recommends not using it \"unless you have nothing to lose.\"\n\nA: One can also install OSXFUSE completely via the brew command line package manager:\nbrew install homebrew/fuse/ext4fuse\n\nNote that the installation tells certain commands need to be run as 'sudo' in addition to this. \n\nWith Yosemite better have a look at this. And then make sure the directory is readable by your user by doing this. For it to work I had to use the wheel group like this:\nsudo dscl . append /Groups/wheel GroupMembership $(whoami)\n\n\nA: With recent changes to homebrew, this should be as simple as:\nbrew cask install osxfuse\nbrew install ext4fuse\n\nYou may have to reboot.\next4fuse is read-only, unfortunately. And you may need to use a flag to get it to work as a normal user.\nOthers viewing this question may be interested in libguestfs. I'm not aware of an OS X port, but considering that VirtualBox has an API, it's not out of the question.\nI wonder why no one has written a compatibility layer to allow Linux kernel filesystem code to run in userspace/fuse. Or has someone?\n\nA: For recent versions of MacOS ext4fuse works stably for read access only. While other answers already give some usage examples I'll repeat it once again with some important details:\n\n*\n\n*Install macFUSE manually or with:\n\nbrew install macfuse\n\n\n\n*Install ext4fuse with:\n\n\nbrew install ext4fuse\n\n\nIf the command above fails with Error: ext4fuse has been disabled then follow the steps at https://github.com/gerard/ext4fuse/issues/66#issuecomment-819943409\n\n\n\n*You can mount as a regular user but that will only provide access to world-readable files. To access all files you'll need to  sudo, e.g.:\n\nsudo ext4fuse -o allow_other,defer_permissions /dev/disk2s1\n\n\nNOTE: -o allow_other,defer_permissions are needed in order to allow accessing the files from finder or terminal as a regular user.\n\n\n\n*You might also need to add your user to the operators group:\n\n# $USER is an ootb env variable that stores your mac user name\nsudo dscl . append /Groups/operator GroupMembership $USER\n\nThe bash script below can be used to automate the mounting. It will loop over the Linux partitions found and prompt to mount them one by one. The mount points will be created  under ~/mnt/<device-name> (if not present):\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nfor device in $(diskutil list | awk '/Linux/  {print $NF}') ; do\n    \n    read -p \">>> Found linux device: $device.

IMPORTANT: Once you launch the PKG installer, make sure you select MacFUSE Compatibility Layer in the wizard (it is not enabled by default) - without it mounting fails.\n\n*Manually download FUSE-EXT2 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse-ext2/ or for Sierra/El Capitan from https://github.com/gpz500/fuse-ext2/releases and run the PKG installer.\n\nOnce OSXFUSE and FUSE-EXT2 are installed you can mount ext2/ext3/ext4 partitions as described in other answers:\n\n*\n\n*Find the device name for the EXT partition you want to mount (e.g. disk0s2 in the example below, (UPDATE) in some MacOS versions ext3/ext4 partitions might be labelled Microsoft Basic Data and not Linux):\n\n# diskutil list | grep Linux\n1:     Linux_Swap    8.2 GB     disk0s1\n2:     Linux         119.9 GB   disk0s2\n\n\n\n*Mount the partition to an existing mount point:\n\nsudo mkdir -p /Volumes/ext4\nsudo mount -t fuse-ext2 /dev/disk0s2 /Volumes/ext4\n\nMounting as a regular user does not seem to work hence the need for sudo.\n❗️ Known issues and limitations\nApparently, after waking from sleep mode ext4 fuse mounts stop working and trying to remount throws an error because the previous mount is still present. The workaround is to do a diskutil umount <mount_point> or diskutil umount force <mount_point> before remounting. An alternative workaround is to temporarily prevent sleeping while you are using the partitions with something like caffeinate -sdi.\n\nA: If you're wondering what the command line is to mount an ext4 partition using fuse and ext2fuse (e.g. when installed using MacPorts port install ext2fuse) - then firstly you need to work out where the Linux partition is:\ndiskutil list\n\nThis will list all partitions for all disks and amongst them you should see the relevant ones listed under the TYPE column as Linux. Combine the diskX and partition number Y like this /dev/diskXsY - e.g:\nmount -t fuse-ext2 /dev/disk1s2 ~/my_mount_point\n\nIt may complain about not being able to write to the log file but it should still mount the partition into your home mount point. But if you want to mount the partition into a system directory then you need to run it as root e.g:\nsudo mount -t fuse-ext2 /dev/disk1s2 /sys_mount_point\n\nIf that doesn't work try:\nsudo ext2fuse /dev/disk1s2 /sys_mount_point\n\nUpdate: More recently I've found that fuse-ext2 has problems with certain newer ext4 features, so instead it is better to use ext4fuse (port install ext4fuse or brew install ext4fuse). Use the ext4fuse command directly:\next4fuse /dev/disk1s2 ~/mount_point\n\nAlso as mentioned by Timothy in the comments you usually only need to use sudo if you're mounting outside your home directory or the disk (/dev/diskX) is only accessible by root:\nsudo ext4fuse /dev/disk1s2 /sys_mount_point\n\nIt should be noted that you can only access that mounted filesystem as root/sudo. e.g.\nsudo ls /sys_mount_point\n\nAnd to unmount the filesystem you just use normal umount command (with sudo if used to mount the partition):\numount ~/mount_point\n\n\nA: Just for the record, I have tested Paragon ExtFS driver (trial version) on my MacBook Pro to write to ext4 partition in Linux. I found that the driver was very unstable, and it created corruptions to the filesystem that fsck was not able to repair neither in Linux nor in Disk Utility.\nMy idea was to have access to my /home partition from Mac OS X using this Paragon driver, but I don't suggest to do this setup. So far, I have my /home partition in Linux formatted to hfsplus with no journaling, and then I can access my files from Mac OS X. Of course, from time to time I get some problems in my FS but is not very frequent. However, I don't suggest this setup either (at least that you have an up to date backup for your daily work).\nFinally, I believe that Paragon is more suitable maybe to use for external hard disks but anyways it is not very reliable for being software which license is expensive.\nUpdate: As of May 2015, I have formatted my /home to ext4, and I mount the filesystem using fuse-ext2 in combination with FUSE for OS X. I can access the ext4 partition to read and write. It is more solid setup than the one I previously described above. \n\nA: You can boot Linux VM quickly on your OS X using Vagrant. You require to install VM provider such as VirtualBox and Vagrant either via .dmg file from the site or using brew cask.\nOnce you have vagrant command installed, run this in any selected folder:\nvagrant init ubuntu/trusty64; vagrant up --provider virtualbox\n\nThis will generate Vagrantfile config file and .vagrant folder.\nand you'll have Linux box booted within few minutes (downloaded from Atlas Hashicorp repository).\nThen connect to the box via command: vagrant ssh and try to mount your device inside Linux.\nBy default your current folder will be synched with /vagrant folder in VM. For more advanced options, you can modify Vagrantfile with required configuration.\nSo if you mount your filesystem within /vagrant folder, it will be automatically synched back to your macOS.\n\nAlternatively you just need to install a VirtualBox, run the GUI app, install and boot a minimal version of Linux e.g. Ubuntu in order to achieve the same as explained above.\n\nAbove non-native solution are not ideal, but at least your macOS would be more stable rather than installing unstable kernel extensions which may cause a lot of system crashes.\n\nA: Take a look at --> https://github.com/alperakcan/fuse-ext2\nThis is what I will be trying next.\nFor ext2, there is a macports version: https://ports.macports.org/port/ext2fuse/summary\nThere is an ext4 module for osxfuse (which you can install via macports) but it is read only!\nThe multitude of versions is a bit confusing but at one point I had managed to get it to work, I will be trying again and updating this answer if it does. :)\nosxfuse is available on macports and as a standalone package.

I don't know if this is even possible, but how can I import an iDVD project into DVD Studio Pro? I really want to be able to copy an iDVD project and tweak it in DVDSP.\nI am using DVDSP 4.2.2 and iDVD 7.1.2.\n\nA: This seems to be a way to go about it, but this only seems to work for iDVD 4.0 or earlier.\nI'm not sure how relevant this is to you though, because I don't know the versions of the software you are using.\nI have zero experience working with iDVD but maybe it is possible to save your project in an older format / convert it to an older format, to make sure it can be imported.\n", "Q: How can I stop my screen from dimming while it's plugged in? Every once in a while my screen dims, I don't want that to happen. Just now it did it while I was moving the mouse.\n\nA: Under displays in system preferences there is a checkbox (along with a brightness slider) to enable/disable automatic brightness.\n\n\nA: It's true that the Ambient Light Sensor causes this problem in many cases. But I want to present an alternative answer.\nIf your power adapter is plugged into a wall socket or a power strip and the connection is loose, the computer will switch between Battery mode and Power Adapter mode.  Since many of us have different power settings for Battery vs. Power Adapter mode, this will cause the screen to randomly dim and undim.\nThe fix is simple. \n\n\nA: Go to System Preferences » Energy Saver\nIf you never want your display to dim and then turn off, set Display Sleep for Never. You can also deselect Automatically reduce brightness before display goes to sleep if you want.\n\n\nA: I'd suggest you install a brilliant app called Caffeine. It's free and will do exactly what you're after. It sits nicely in your menu bar and with a simple click toggle you can enable activate/deactivate it. It also allows it to be activate for a set amount of time.\nIf you don't want to use a 3rd party app you can always disable Display sleep via Energy Saver preference pane.\n", "Q: Bose docking station is not working with new ipod touch \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhy won't my iPod Touch play in Bose SoundDock speakers anymore? \n\nI just purchased a new ipod touch and it is not working on my bose docking station. Both my daughters have older ipods and they are working. On my new ipod, when it is plugged into the docking station it appears to be playing, when discounected it plays on its own speaker and ear phones... Any ideas what may be the problem?   \n\nA: Depending on the age of the docking station (is it a Wave?  If so, version 1 or 2?) it may not allow a full range of functions on newer/older iPods etc (depending on the combination - i.e. an old one will not work with new iPods fully, a new one should work with old iPods tho) - this is because they changed the pinouts on the dock connector as part of changing from Firewire to USB.  Basically all iPods used to be Firewire based, then when they became windows compatible they changed to USB, but the dock connector maintained pin options for both, regardless of what was at the other end.  Even with USB iPods, older docks would still allow power to be sent over the Firewire pins for charging the device (as it allowed higher currents, and thus faster charging) - eventually Apple removed this capability, meaning that the dock would appear not to be able to charge your device, but 3rd party hardware manufacturers were too slow to modify their products (even though they had been warned prior to the change to stop using Firewire connections).\n", "Q: How do I change my (non-interactive shell) PATH? For example, when I launch Emacs from the terminal (an interactive shell), I can use \"M-x shell\".\nWhen I launch Emacs from the dock (which spawns process from some other shell), I cannot, because \"grep isn't found\" (or 'ls' or 'some other universal UNIX command'). Also, half my non-default applications have stopped working (MATLAB, DrRacket, X11, etc).\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I change the environment of the shell that is called by the dock?\n\n*What shell does the dock call / what else ought I know about different shells on a mac?\n\n\nA: You should create the file ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist with inside\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n<key>PATH</key>\n<string>/Users/gio/.dotfiles/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin/:/usr/sbin/:/bin:/sbin</string>\n<key>PYTHONPATH</key>\n<string>/Users/gio/.local:/Users/gio/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nWhat I wrote above is just an example, but I think you get the main point here.

This is fairly easy to do with many shareware programs on a PC. I figured there would be some uber-powerful shell command to do this in one line, but I can't find it.\nI want to send NMEA data into one port, and have Google earth read the data out of the other.\nAny tips?\nEDIT\nMrDaniel's /dev/ptypx comment seemed to be interesting - I can pull it out of /dev/ttypx just fine in terminal.\nBut Google earth seems to be reading cu.deviceName instead of the /ttypx deveices..\nspecifically (Old Pro):\nWhen trying to import the current location using a GPS (or NMEA stream piped through our virtual serial port), we go: Tools > GPS > Realtime to get to the import screen.\nAfter selecting the NMEA option, and enabling realtime tracking, it looks for connected devices, and seems to look at:\n\n\n*\n\n*usb:\n\n*/dev/cu.Bluetooth-PDA-Sync\n\n*/dev/cu.Bluetooth-Modem\n\n*/dev/cu.iPhone-WirelessAP\n\n\nEven with our ttypx serial port operating ok, it doesn't look for it.\nI would like to get the data from that device into Google Earth.\n\nA: I think what you are looking for is a Pseudo Terminal, as noted in Text-Terminal-HOWTO. It looks like Mac OS X has built in in /dev and it seems like this can do what you want to do, e.g. two programs talking together via a \"virtual\" serial port.\n\nPseudo terminals are pairs of devices such as /dev/ptyp3 and /dev/ttyp3. There is no physical device directly associated with either of them, not even a serial port connector. But if a program treats ttyp3 like it was a serial port, what is read and written to that port appears on the other member of the pair ptyp3 which another program uses to read and write to. Thus two programs talk to each other via this method and one program on ttyp3 thinks it's talking to a serial port. It's something like a \"pipe\" between these two tty's.\n\nAdditionally, the screen program may be useful to you as well.\n\nA: Google has an extremely useful tool for Arduino developers and it simulates serial ports very well on OS X for testing purposes. It only works until 10.6\nhttps://github.com/clokey/PublicCode/tree/master/MacOSXVirtualSerialPort\n(previously available from http://code.google.com/p/macosxvirtualserialport/ )\nMight this help you?\n\nA: There are several angles to your question here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do you just want to convert NMEA tracks etc. into something Google Earth can read (and display)? GPSBabel is the tool of choice for these kind of things.\n\n*Do you want to attach your GPS and read its content via a serial port? Macs don't have serial ports, you will need something like Keyspan USA-19HS to connect serial devices via USB.\n\n*Do you want to create virtual serial devices out of curiosity? That's definitively possible but beyond my knowledge...\n\n\nA: It's not clear you can fake out the built in serial port detection but I would start with a named pipe (mkfifo) in /dev/cu.fake.ttypx and have some data ready to be read when you enable the realtime.\nMy copy of Google Earth appears to poll each potential source in order and continues to do nothing but scan since I have no NMEA data being provided.\nYou'll of course need a small [shell|perl|python] script to read from /dev/ttypx and write to your \"fake\" fifo file.\n\nA: There is a windows tool called GooPs http://goopstechnologies.com/?page_id=12 which handles some similar tasks.\nYou can also make a placemark that reads coordinates from a file and refreshes every second.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/7249565/how-to-properly-update-google-earth-kml-using-networklinkcontrol-and-the-java-ap\n\nA: I've used a Posix pseudoterminal to create a virtual comm port into an OSX C program.

When you first open Safari and only have one page (one tab), the tab bar is not shown. When you open your second tab (e.g. by center-clicking a link to open it in a new tab), the tab bar then appears, which makes the content of the original page jump down a bit.\nI expected to find an \"Always show the tab bar\" checkbox in Preferences, but apparently not.\nIs there a way to force the tab bar to always appear, even if there's only one tab open?\n\nA: As it turns out, you do this through the \"View\" menu, rather than through \"Preferences\":\n\n\n*\n\n*Close all tabs but one, so you only have one tab open\n\n*In the \"View\" menu, click \"Show Tab Bar\" which will make the tab bar appear\n\n*This preference will stick, even if you close and reopen Safari\n\n\nSimple, but not what I expected!\n", "Q: Does the iPhone Mail app mark gmail messages as spam? If I move a message to the Spam folder using the native mail app on the iPhone, will it be marked as spam on the gmail server? Or will the message just be moved to that folder?

Now, I want to create two more partitions for Linux - LINUX and LINUXSWAP. I open Disk Utility and specify new partitions using + button in the mas disk. Then I click apply. Application returns strange message partition failed with the error: couldn't modify partition map because file system verification failed. I googled for that problem and everywhere people advice to repair disk using boot CD with MacOS which leads to deinstalling all applications, perhaps, losing windows partition and very time consuming. I don't like this way. Do you have an idea how I can create just two partitions for my Linux?\n\nA: There might be a misconception somewhere in what you say. You can run Disk Utility from the original system disc WITHOUT re-installing OS X. \nI ran into a similar problem recently, on which running Disk Utility from any of the existing partitions would not work. I then tried running Disk Utility from a restore disk I had copied to an external USB-drive and to my surprise it was not successful either. Ultimately, the only way I was able to get Disk Utility to re-partition my drive was when I executed it from the original system CD that shipped with my Mac. \nAgain, you can launch Disk Utility from the setup start up screen by selecting it from one of the menus. You do not require to re-install OS X. Hope this helps. \n\nA: Background: To create the extra partitions, the current Mac OS partition, which probably occupies all space on the disk, needs to be reduced in size. Disk Utility can resize Mac OS volumes, but only if they have no logical errors on them.\nWhat you described sounds like your Mac OS volume was having errors. You should have let Disk Utility repair the volume. This doesn't necessarily lead to losing files. Often, it's only a little inconsistency on the disk that Disk Utility fixes without any problems. Only if Disk Utility would then say that it can't repair it, you'd need to consider saving your files to another disk and then reformat your disk. But if all is repaired, then you could go back and add the extra partitions.\nAlso, if you really know what you're doing (this is rather directed to others as the originally asking person surely isn't), you can use a tool like iBored to manually mess with the partition table to make room. Expect data loss if you don't know what that means, though :)\n\nA: The best way to add, remove, or modify partitions if you aren't a tech guru is to use disk utility. If disk utility fails the best thing to try is using the OS X DVD or on Lion the recovery partition. You do not have to reinstall the operating system to use this method. The OS X DVD can be used to run disk utility or to reinstall the operating system. Select disk utility from the DVD or the recovery partition and repair the disk and disk permissions. Once it is finished try to partition the disk again.\n", "Q: How do I restore the audio balance to default? On my iPod Touch, I was playing around with the audio balance setting (settings -> general -> accessibility)\nHow can I reset the balance setting so that it is precisely at the midpoint (i.e. the default)?\n\n\nA: It should automatically snap to midpoint if you manually move it there.\n\nA: An alternative solution:\n\n*\n\n*Try you best to move the silder to center.\n\n*Grab /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Accessibility.plist by either jailbreaking or making backup.\n\n*Find the item named MasterStereoBalance.

I can't seem to get my podcasts to sync like they used to (before ios5).\nI have iTunes set up to only transfer SELECTED UNPLAYED podcasts... however, it keeps transferring all of the SELECTED podcasts, played or not.\nDo others have this same issue? If not, any suggestions on how I could get it to stop?\nI've tried disabling, and re-enabling podcast syncing. Turning off and on SELECTED... turning off and on UNPLAYED... but this doesn't seem to resolve it.\nAny advice appreciated.\n\nA: I definitely feel your pain when dealing with managing podcasts with iTunes on iOS devices. With the challenges of either creating a smart playlist that I can't then order (at least I've generally found this to be impossible) or the idea of having to micromanage my podcasts through a standard playlist as well as the oddities of what podcasts get synced and why I've generally given up.\nWhat I recommend is a specific podcasting app. There are a few out there. I started with Instacast, but it became a little unstable for me recently. I've since gone to Podcaster, and aside from the initial learning curve, I like it more. The nice thing about either of them is that you never have to use iTunes to sync your podcasts either, as they'll download them over wifi or 3G.\nSorry that I can't provide a solution directly related to your iTunes challenge, but I've been happier going this route and maybe you would be as well.\n\nA: Same issue. All podcasts either played or unplayed sync from device to computer. You must manually delete old podcast from device. \n", "Q: Reorder items in Reminders app Can't find a way to reorder tasks in Reminders. Am I missing something or it really is not possible?\nUpdate: Apple added this feature to iOS 6. \n\nA: Currently, there is no method to change the order of reminders. Neither priority nor due date of a reminder has an influence on the position in the list.\n\nA: I just figured out how to re-order reminders. The secret is to click on a list item to the right of the text. In other words, if the item reads, \"Pick up dry cleaning\", click in the empty area to the right of the word \"cleaning\". This will cause the entire item to turn slightly darker, as if highlighted. Then, just click it and drag it up or down to the desired location.\nThe secret is in where you click. If you click on the text, you'll get a cursor, enabling you to edit the entry. Click out to the right, however, and you can highlight the item for dragging.\n\nA: It can be done!  On an iPhone 7, I tap on the item and hold for about one second.  The background darkens and then I'm free to move the item up or down the list.\n\nA: On MacBook I have ordered my Reminders by selecting Title as the order of sorting (under 'View'), and prefixing each item with a 2-digit sequential number, to act as the sort key.  If you wish to insert an item between two that you have already numbered, you can simply add another digit to the sort number of that item, as in the Dewey Decimal system used in libraries. E.G. If you already have '01 See to animals', '02 Put out bins' and you want to add 'Put on washing' between those two, give it the number '011'   \n\nA: The only work around that I have found is to drag your reminder to another list, then bring it back to the list you want it in. It will bring that reminder to the bottom of the list.\n\nA: Click edit and then touch the 3 lined icon on the right hand side of the reminder item, and you can move it up and down!\n\nA: click the task on the list your want to move. when it highlighted, you can move it up and down.\n\nA: I cannot reorder tasks on my iPhone 5S, either. However, in the iCloud desktop (WIN7),there is a category that doesn't appear on my 5S. It's called \"Scheduled.\" That is where you will find tasks in day and time order, scheduled automatically by the app. The tasks, et all, you store in the categories that you set up on your phone, pad, or computer can be highlighted, but not moved. Rather, you can move them, but they won't stay!\n\nA: Using the main list on the computer select for each list: View, Sort By, Manual. Drag them manually into the correct order and this will then be duplicated in your other devices. The previous comment about dragging your reminder to another list may help too but I haven't tried it. Making the new list Manual before importing may also help.\n\nA: Choose Edit. Press and hold the lines on right of item to be moved. Slowly drag the item left then right until the grey circle/slash disappears, then drag the item to new position and let go.\n", "Q: What is the best way to backup photos & videos from iPhoto online? I'd love to use Dropbox to back up all my photos and videos, especially from iPhoto.  But I'm not exactly sure the best way to do this is, given that I know that my 2 computers with iPhoto directories will conflict with each other within dropbox.  And my video collection (with 2 little kids) is getting massive.  100 GB from Dropbox won't cut it.\nI understand flickr is a good option, in that they integrate directly from iPhoto and have unlimited uploads (how is this possible for only $25/year?).  Can they also automatically synchronize photo/video folders?\n\nA: First option, there are some excellent services that provide online backup solutions for a reasonable price. Two examples are Mozy and Backblaze. The advantage is that you can set it and forget it, and it will back up all your files (with options for some things you might want to exclude).\nAnother option is using Dropbox. You can move your iPhoto Library from your Pictures folder to the Dropbox folder and alias it to the original location (drag using ⌘option to make an alias instead of a copy). If you don't alias it, iPhoto should just ask you where the library is stored when you relaunch it anyway.\nI don't really think of services like Flickr as backup, they're more of an online photo organizer, but yes they can be used that way too. There is no synchronization, so you have to upload your updated files manually.\n\nA: My Library lives on my iMac. It’s Backed up to  two external hard disks every day. These disks are permanently attached to the iMac. These back ups run automatically. One is done by Time Machine, one is a bootable back up done by SuperDuper\nIt’s also backed up to a portable hard disk when ever new photos are added. This hard disk lives in my car. For security, this disk is password protected.\nI have a second off-site back up at a relative’s house across town. That’s updated every 3 or 4 months.\nMy Photos are backed up online. There are many options: Flickr, Picasa, SmugMug etc. However, check the terms of your account carefully. While most sites have free uploading, you will often find that these uploads are limited in terms of the file size or the bandwidth you can use per month. For access that allows you to upload full size pics with no restrictions you may need to pay. \nEvery couple of months I test the back ups to make sure they are working correctly. It’s very easy to mis-configure a back up application, and the only way to protect against that is to do a trial restore. \n", "Q: In which countries can I use 3G service with a Wi-Fi + 3G model of the iPad 2 that was purchased in the U.S.?

For what it's worth, I am specifically interested in using the iPad 2 in Japan.\nMy question is related to Will an iPad 2 3G from UK work on a Poland's (or another country's) 3G network? I was a bit troubled by the following quote in the answer.\n\nThe broader situation is that the only problematic (less interoperable) 3G iPad is the Verizon-specific model sold in the USA\n\nDoes this mean that any iPad 2 purchased in the U.S. is incompatible with 3G service abroad?\n\nA: A GSM iPad should work in any country where GSM carriers operate and offer data plans.\nmobileworldlive.com is a great resource. They have a list which is up-to-date with live and planned availability as well as supported frequencies.\nOf course you can use your iPad in any country where your carrier has roaming agreements. But at a very high rate. And you might have to call your carrier in advance to activate the option. But this will cost you much more than getting your data access from a local carrier.\nIf you chose to get your data access from a local carrier here are a few things to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*The carrier will not necessarily offer a micro SIM. In that case you will have to trim the sim to the right dimensions yourself.\n\n*You will have to setup the APN settings yourself on most networks.\n\n*Internet access could mean something else than data plan. Beware of obsolete offers with WAP or very limited access.\n\n*Some carriers will have better coverage than others. Check the coverage of each carrier before committing.\n\n*Some carriers will not sell prepaid data.\n\n*In some countries there could be restrictions for foreigners or non residents and you might have to get your SIM from someone who can buy it for you.\n\n\n\nDoes this mean that any iPad 2 purchased in the U.S. is incompatible with 3G service abroad?\n\nNo. The GSM version (AT&T) will work in most countries. The same cannot be said of the CDMA version (Verizon).\nWikipedia tels us the iPad supports UMTS / HSDPA (850, 1900, 2100 MHz) GSM / EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)\nTwo networks are referenced as providing support for GSM based 3G in japan :\n\n\n*\n\n*NTT DOCOMO, INC. (DOCOMO) 3G on 2100 MHz\n\n*SOFTBANK MOBILE Corp. (SoftBank) 3G 2100 MHz\n\n\n\nNote: I would recommend a 3rd party solution if you go abroad for a short period of time. There are mobile WiFi modems like the huawei-mifi-e585 that could offer a better alternative if you need internet access on more than one device at a time.\n\nA: Purchasing iPad 2 Wi-Fi + 3G in US you have two 3G options — Verizon and AT&T.\nAT&T model supports UMTS/HSDPA/HSUPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz); GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz). And Verizon does CDMA EV-DO Rev. A (800, 1900 MHz).\nSince iPhone 3G and above model that Apple was selling in Japan is UMTS I believe you should pick AT&T model to be safe. Even if you'll be able to use Verizon model in Japan (not sure), still with UMTS (AT&T) model you will definitely have better luck finding supported network. Here is a list of UMTS networks around the world. Even if there is no 3G coverage it will fallback to EDGE and GPRS.\niPad comes unlocked.\n\nA: There is no simple answer.  In general, an 3G iPad2 can work in any country that supports 3G on one of the frequencies supported by the iPad2.  A Verizon iPad2 can work in countries that have compatible CDMA networks with data roaming agreements with Verizon.  The big gotcha is that international data roaming charges are extremely expensive on US carriers (for example, Verizon charges $5/MB) so taking more than an occasional, small sip from the data pipe is impractical for non-billionaires.  Regular folks need to get a micro-SIM and a data plan from a local carrier.  The Verizon iPad doesn't use a SIM, it's not really an option for this approach.\nAs far as Japan goes, DoCoMo and Softbank support 3G but everything I read makes me think it's not possible for short-term visitors to actually buy a micro-SIM from these carriers.  Your only practical option might be to get a roaming SIM from somebody like https://www.iphonetrip.com/.  It's much more expensive than a local micro-SIM option but much, much, much less expensive than data roaming on AT&T or Verizon.\n", "Q: Removing favorite styles does not work in Lion’s TextEdit In TextEdit on OS X 10.7 Lion, I want to remove some custom text styles I created previously (see screenshot). I have tried the “Remove from favorites” button in the “Show Styles > Favourite Styles” dialog, however this only removes them until TextEdit is reopened. How do I delete the styles permanently?\n\n\nA: It looks like you have run into a bug in Lion’s version of TextEdit. For reasons unknown, the designers of TextEdit opted for storing favorite styles in the global preferences file (~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist) when they introduced the feature. They might have intended to create a user global stored styles system for NSText based rich text editors (not the only oddity of the system – this post has a good write-up of TextEdit’s style implementation). This has worked up to and including OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.\nIn OS X 10.7 Lion however, TextEdit has been sandboxed (sandboxing means, in layman’s terms: the operating system only grants an application discrete rights to access the file system, network, OS services etc. as defined by the app – so called entitlements. Anything a sandboxed application tries beyond that what is covered by its entitlements will be denied and logged by the sandbox daemon sandbox). A look at the log, where you will find an entry similar to this one\n02.11.11 14:44:54,659 sandboxd: ([73342]) TextEdit(73342) deny file-write-create /Users/<user>/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist.c2n4nCb\n\neach time you try to store a new favorite style shows that writing to .GlobalPreferences is not among TextEdit’s entitlements. The result: Lion’s TextEdit can neither store new favorite styles*, nor delete ones written ether by previous versions of TextEdit (your case).\nTo get rid of the old styles, you need to remove the NSFavoriteStyles key from the global preferences list. If you have Xcode installed, invoking\nopen ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist\n\nwill open the file in Xcode’s plist Editor, where you can remove / modify it manually. If you don’t,\ndefaults delete -g NSFavoriteStyles\n\nwill get rid of all stored (“favorite”) styles.\n\n* it might look like it does, as these are stored in memory while TextEdit runs, and with Lion’s revamped process management, it is difficult to tell when textEdit really quits. Still, once it does, the favorite styles disappear.\n\nADDENDUM: Reported as a bug to Apple (OpenRadar rdar://10385163).\nAccording to Apple Developer Relations, this bug has been quashed as of OS X 10.8\n\nA: @kopischke, nice explanation, I had been wondering about this issue for some time.\nA little workaround I found useful:\nIt seems MacJournal uses the same favorite styles as TextEdit (that's one place where those global styles are actually useful). As MacJournal is not (yet) sandboxed, I could edit (add/delete) my favorite styles from there and they were saved correctly. And after that I could use them in TextEdit also.\n\nA: For all tweaking their Favorite Styles (aka NSFavoriteStyles) in following Mac OS's after Snow Leopard like Mountain Lion or Mavericks: The settings (NSFavoriteStyles) have been moved to: \n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.AppKit.TextFavorites.plist\n\n", "Q: Screenshot reader for Mac Is there a screenshot reader similar to ABBYY Screenshot Reader (you are just selecting area on the screen and getting text into the buffer, something like that)?\n\nA: how about using FreeOCR?

I'm talking about the charger that comes with their new Bluetooth trackpad and keyboard.\nIf I put 2 empty batteries in it now, how long till they're full?\n\nA: Apple has said that it may take up to five hours to charge the batteries.\n\nA: Usually 4 to 5 hours for me to recharge the 2 AA batteries.  Basically I recharge the batteries when its power is lower than 10%.\n\nA: Mine usually seems to take about 3 hours for completely drained batteries.\n", "Q: Can I automatically show keyboard viewer on certain layouts? I work with non-ASCII alphabets like Hebrew and Greek just a little bit, so I have the appropriate keyboard layouts available in the language and text menu in the top panel. However, I don't quite know all the characters yet, so I have to bring up the keyboard viewer when I want to type in those languages so that I can hunt for the characters I want. Is there a way to automatically bring up the keyboard viewer when certain keyboard layouts are selected and then make it go away when I switch back to normal?\n\nA: OK, building off of a post on SuperUser, here goes:\nYou can create AppleScripts to change to the various languages. If you make Services that take no input and just call this one script, they'll all live happily in the Services menu when you want them. Otherwise, use your AppleScript trigger method of choice.\nTo switch to, say, Greek, and bring up the keyboard viewer when you do, run this script:\n tell application \"System Events\"\n     if exists process \"Keyboard Viewer\" then\n         display alert \"running\"\n         try\n             tell application \"KeyboardViewer\" to quit\n         end try\n     end if\n end tell\n tell application \"Finder\"\n     open item \"System:Library:Input Methods:KeyboardViewer.app\" of the startup disk\n end tell\n changeKeyboardLayout(\"Greek\")\n\n on changeKeyboardLayout(layoutName)\n     tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"SystemUIServer\"\n         tell (1st menu bar item of menu bar 1 whose description is \"text input\") to {click, click (menu 1's menu item layoutName)}\n     end tell\n end changeKeyboardLayout\n\nTo switch back to the U.S. layout, killing the viewer when you do, use this:\n tell application \"System Events\"\n     if exists process \"Keyboard Viewer\" then\n         display alert \"running\"\n         try\n             tell application \"KeyboardViewer\" to quit\n         end try\n     end if\n end tell\n changeKeyboardLayout(\"U.S.\")\n\n on changeKeyboardLayout(layoutName)\n     tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"SystemUIServer\"\n         tell (1st menu bar item of menu bar 1 whose description is \"text input\") to {click, click (menu 1's menu item layoutName)}\n     end tell\n end changeKeyboardLayout\n\nSubstitute the names of whatever keyboard layouts you want in the changeKeyboardLayout(\"layout name\") command.\n", "Q: How can I modify the Date Added field in iTunes 10 I haven't tried doing this in quite some time (iTunes 7 era), but I seem to remember simply editing the XML file iTunes creates was NOT sufficient in updating the Date Added field in iTunes.\nIn case you're curious why I would want to edit Date Added, it is because I most often enjoy listening to music with iTunes sorted on Date Added field. Most of the time this is a logical order for me, but occasionally (when importing more than one album at a time) iTunes imports a batch of songs in a seemingly random order, so I might have very differing albums intermixed. In these cases, I'd like to go in and make sure the Date Added times are grouped by album.\n\nA: Just change the system clock and add the file again:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the track. \n\n*Change the date on your system clock to the desired date. \n\n*Add the track. \n\n\nA: You could try sorting by the Date Modified field. Date Added is readonly, but you can modify Date Modified. There's an app called SortHelper for iTunes.\n\nA: The Date Added field is officially read only. AppleScript can't change it, nor can any menu or command within iTunes. iTunes Music Library.xml is a text file, so in theory it could be edited to modify the Date Added information, then force iTunes to rebuild the iTunes Library.itl file. Not particularly easy.\nIf there's a better solution, I'd love to see it, but I'm afraid Apple made the Date Added field difficult to modify.\n", "Q: Why did I lose the ability to print to a networked printer? I have a Canon iP3600 printer connected to a networked hard drive and up until a few days ago I was able to print from it. however, i have now lost the ability to print ever since i downloaded Apple's updated software for the printer!\nI have my mac partitioned and running Windows 7 and can still print perfectly from there, so the cables are obviously not the problem. I can still print perfectly if I connect the printer via USB directly to the Mac. I can even print a test page from the Print preferences page.\nI just cannot print from a document. Print Queue keeps saying \"Copying print data\" but nothing happens! Have downloaded the latest driver from the Canon website and deleted and re-installed the printer several times and several ways to no avail.\nAny ideas most welcome...\n\nA: I had the same problem and this is what I did to fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to http://localhost:631/\nIf you get the \"Web Interface is Disabled\" message, run cupsctl WebInterface=yes in Terminal.\n\n*Choose the Administration tab.\n\n\n*Click Add Printer.\n\nIf you are required to login, use a local Administrator account.\n\n*Select the printer (in my case it was automatically found).\n\n\nA: I have exactly the same problem, installed driver numerous times, repaired permissions etc.. Then I installed Gutenprint (main page, Mac OSX page) and can print using that, although it seems to be terribly slow on my MP800R. Would still love to hear a different solution for getting the Canon drivers to work.\n[edit]\nAfter some more fiddling I got it working. Instead of adding the printer as an IP printer using LPD I added it via CUPS (http://localhost:631) and there for the connection I could choose canonijnetwork://Canon/MP800R?00.00.85.62.b9.2f The last bit will be different for everyone as it is the printer model and mac address. But after doing that I could print using the canon driver and also see the supply levels.\n", "Q: AirPort Extreme Drops Out Periodically (Every 2-3 Days) Requiring Unplug/Replug to Restart I have an AirPort Extreme that drops connection every two to three days.  When my client indicates no signal/SSID present, it searches and does show my AirPort Extreme SSID.  However, selecting it results in a timeout error.  Unplugging and replugging the AE and allowing it to reboot does fix the problem until the next 2-3 days dropout.\nFimware is 5.7.  I am using WPA2 Personal encryption, automatic channel selection, 802.11b/g combined mode, multicast of 2Mbps, transmit power 100%, and WPA Group Key timeout of 1 hour.  I am not using closed network or interface robustness suppression or MAC access control.\nEverything else is pretty straightforward; using DHCP, DHCP leases for 4 hours, etc.  At any give time, I probably have 4-6 clients connected to the router.\nI obviously can't access the log when the event occurs since I can't connect to the router even through AirPort Utility.  I guess I could try a LAN connection to read the log. \nAny similar experiences or suggestions?\n\nA: Make sure you don't have any 2.4Ghz cordless phones near your Airport Extreme. Some of this phone will tend to do what you describe when they interfere with your Airport Extreme, at least that used to happen to me with an Airport Express I had.  \n\nA: The best solution I've found so far (and this is obviously a bit of a hack) is to put the Airport onto a light timer so it turns off and then on again at 4:45 am every day. This causes it to reboot and seems to end the problems, but it's at a time of day I don't find myself wanting to use the network.\n\nA: Strangely, I've found that this occurs to me as well, only when I have guest networking activated.  When I turn it off, it stays online for weeks without interruption.\n\nA: If you see a lot of other networks in your neighborhood then you may have to switch over to 802.11g/n to reduce interference and/or get a dual-band wireless router that support 5GHz 802.11a/n because there's more channels and likely fewer of your neighbors using 5GHz frequency spectrum.\n\nA: I've had the same problem ever since buying my Time Capsule. \nOriginally it would drop out for a minute, which was when it changed channels so I set that to manual.\nWith that problem fixes I was getting drop outs every few days and the only way to resolve this was to power cycle the box.\nThe last two days I've had two laptops on the guest network and it's been dropping out every hour. (I think it may be load related as I've been heavily using the wireless downloading ISO images on both private and guest networks)\nThanks for the tip! I'll try disabling the guest network and see if that improves things. \n", "Q: How do I stop iCal from automatically adding alarms to new events?

There are a lot of public wi-fi networks (diners, restaurants, cafes, universities). They are password protected. The password rarely (if ever) changes (only mcdonalds prints a temp password on the receipt).\nI'm so very tired of asking for the password. I need to find a waiter. Sometimes they tell you a password that is not correct. Means I have to ask again.\nIs there an application that shares wi-fi passwords between different people? \nFor example, someone goes to Joe's Cafe, gets the wi-fi password from the waitress, and in the background (ideally) an application puts the password on a server. Then another guy/gal enters the cafe and automatically has the password from the same server and connects, to the wi-fi without having to talk to the waitress.\nThanks,\n\nA: I've searched in the iOS AppStore. I didn't find such an application. I also looked in Cydia, but no such application exists. Android's Market also said no.\nHere are my thoughts on why such an application does not exist:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sharing someone else's wifi password is an issue. He/she gave it to you so you can have internet. He/she hasn't agreed that you share it with the world. In the case of internet cafes, they have passwords so that only clients can use their wi-fi.\n\n*I spoke with an company that develops iOS applications. They said no public API exists that allows the application to get saved wi-fi passwords or to make the phone connect to a new wi-fi network.\n\n*Such an application most probably will not be accepted in the iOS AppStore (I have been told from the same company)\n\n*There are issues with implementation. How without an internet would one get the password that is needed for a concrete wi-fi network? Preload all passwords in the application? Use 3g to get that specific password?\n\n\nEven though I think such an application would make people's lives a bit easier, I think there are too many problems for it to be implemented.\n", "Q: How do I rate songs on the 5th gen iPod nano? How do I rate songs on the 5th generation iPod nano?  Is it possible?

A week ago I noticed a weird Lion symptom, and posted a vague description of one this problem.\nToday, after some tests, I came to a conclusion that this bug reproduces whenever a the computer is logged into while plugged to a certain display, and then being plugged to a different display.\nThe only thing I can think of is that the display data is saved, and a conflict occurs upon the plugging of a different display.\nAny idea as to how I can delete or reset this data?\n\nA: I am unable to reproduce the problem.\nMaybe this will work: System Preferences > Displays > Detect Displays\n", "Q: How to restore the AddressBook database from backup How do I transfer my address book files in the abcdp format to my new MacBook Pro with Mac OS X Lion?  \nThe files are from a 2008 MacBook running Mac OS X 10.6; the hard drive crashed, and the computer won't start up at all. Luckily, I had everything backed up with Mozy. I restored the files on the new MacBook, but I cannot read the abcdp format. I've tried a few other solutions such as copying the abcdp files into the metadata folder with no luck.\n\nA: First, the database file is ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/*.abcddb (with abcddb meaning Address Book CoreData database). The files in ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/Metadata have extensions like .abcdp (Address Book CoreData person) and .abcdg (Address Book CoreData group). The metadata files can serve as a backup if the .abcddb goes bad or missing. So if you want to restore those abcdp files, you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your Address Book data\n\n*Quit all applications\n\n*Move, rename, or delete the .abcddb file mentioned above\n\n*Put the abcdp files into the Metadata subdirectory listed above\n\n*Launch Address Book.app\n\n*Select and drag the contacts out to save them in one or more vCard files\n\n*Restore your Address Book backup created in step 1\n\n*Import the vCard(s) created in step 6\n\n\nIf you need any help or clarification on this technique, please leave a comment. I hope this works for you!\n\nA: Assuming that you mean an abcddb (not abcddp) file, what you have is the SQL Lite database file AddressBook is storing all contacts in. Quitting AddressBook, copying that file to\n~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/AddressBook-v22.abcddb\n\n(where ~ is your home directory – note the Libraryfolder is hidden by default in Lion; click “Go To” while holding Alt in Finder or do a open $HOME/Library in Terminal to reveal it) and restarting AddressBook should be your ticket to a successful restore. \n\nA: If you have not only .abcdp files but the whole Library/Application Support/AddressBook backed up, just copy directory somewhere, add .abbu extension and open it (.abbu should be associated with Contacts.app). One downside is that it does not propose to merge contacts but to replace them.\n", "Q: Is there a way to keep my iPhone from receiving calls/texts/alerts while listening to music? I like to listen to music on my iPhone when running, but it's really annoying for the music to be interrupted by calls/texts/alerts. I know I can put it in airplane mode, but that will keep me from using the GPS to track my mileage through apps like RunKeeper. Is there another way to \"silence\" calls/texts/alerts and just have them show up as missed when I'm finished listening to music?\n\nA: Before iOS6 the short answer is no. The iPhone's and iOS flexibility in certain aspects is really (sometimes for the good) small. iOS doesn't support the old traditional \"modes\" where you could set your old phone in \"meeting\" or \"some name\" and then set the ringtones for each individual mode, and even silence and turn off vibrate. I remember an old Nokia phone almost 10 years ago was capable of doing this :)\nYour other bet (albeit an annoying one) would be to setup a \"silence\" ringtone and turn off vibration, but I believe your music will be \"paused\" while the phone is ringing while there's a cross fade from your music to the ring tone. \nThe drawback is that you'll have to put them back after your session.\nYour other alternative is to Jailbreak the phone and seek Cydia repositories and other \"unknown sources\" to find something like this (which I'm sure exists out there).\n\nA: The easiest solution I can think of is just to forward your calls. On my AT&T phone, I can do this right from the settings app — send them to another number (Google Voice is a good suggestion, though make sure GVoice won't just send the call right back to your iPhone!) I think I remember reading that CDMA phones don't support this automatic forwarding feature because the network doesn't support it. This was pre-Sprint days, so it may have only been a Verizon limitation. At any rate, I'm sure there's some way to turn on call forwarding through the Verizon website or by calling into your non-visual voicemail or something.\n\nA: Note sure why nobody has mentioned this: Just switch your phone to SILENT on the side. \n\nMusic and Podcasts will still play, but it will stop your phone from interrupting the music/podcast to alert you about phone calls, texts and emails. I do it all the time and it works a charm.\n\nA: In iOS7 You can now use Do Not Disturb mode to both prevent unwanted notifications and calls/alerts etc, and unlike in iOS6 you can choose to have this setting effective whether or not the phone is unlocked, meaning that if a call comes in while you have the Music apps open to select a new playlist etc, you can still avoid the disturbance if you choose.\nSettings > Do Not Disturb > Silence: Always/Only while iPhone is locked\n\nA: Coming in iOS 6, you'll have the option to set \"Do Not Disturb\" mode in the device's Settings.  DND allows you to block out a time window where calls and alerts will be silenced.\nYou can optionally configure it to allow calls from \"favorites\" or repeated calls to still come through.\n\nA: If you have a GSM phone, you can just pop out the SIM card. You've now got a GPS capable iPod touch while you run. \nIf you normally have notifications coming in over WiFi networks that your phone might join during the run, optionally turn WiFi off to be safe.\n\nIf you don't have service through a SIM, getting rid of everything but the voice call interruption is easy. Most carriers will let you forward your voice calls temporarily - say to google voice if you are into a free solution. Combine the two and you have your solution. \nAll of these work in the Settings App:\nIn Sound:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the Ringer and Alerts volume to zero\n\n*Set Change with Buttons to OFF\n\n*Set Vibrate to OFF when Silent\n\n\nIn General -> Network\n\n\n*\n\n*Set Cellular Data to OFF\n\n\nAt this point when you have the side switch to silent, only an incoming call should silently pause your music. You can then press any hardware button to get right back to the music. Not exactly what you ask, but the best you can do without modifying the iOS software.\n\nA: Just flip the volume switch on the side to off.  It works for music and podcast apps.  I can now listen to them and not have the volume go down.\n\nA: I use the do not disturb mode during my workouts. Works also on long road trips or bike rides when I don't want to have my music paused.\n\nA: Go into settings and switch to aeroplane mode!! No calls or texts what so ever will come through yet you can listen to music. \nThe only problem is, you can't get Internet using this option so if your using a gps then this option is no good for you.  \n\nA: I recently learned, and personally tested with my iPhone 4, if you go into your Settings, then turn on Airplane Mode, it will stop your phone from receiving phone calls and text messages. You will be able to retrieve voicemails and text messages when you turn the Airplane Mode back to the Off position. If you want to have access to WiFi capabilities like GPS, maps, email, etc. turn your WiFi on in Settings. It's right underneath the Airplane Mode feature. Of course, if you have any APPS that have push notifications on, it will effect the volume of your iPod. To remedy that just change your Notifications to the Off position in Settings. All 3 of these features are in Settings, all next to each other at the very top. So it makes it very easy and convenient. \n\nA: The RIGHT answer is to flip the silent switch on the side of the phone.\n", "Q: How can I change default settings for HP Laserjet Pro 100 Color MFP 175?

My aim here is to make my iPhone 4S (running iOS 5.0) serve its music library over SMB/Samba (Windows File Sharing protocol) so any computer on the LAN can access it.\nAre there any iPhone apps available (for a non-jailbroken phone) that can act as a Samba file server for the iPhone's filesystem (or at least music library)?\n\nA: Out of the box it's definitively not possible. To share music you need an Airplay capable counterpart (speakers etc.).\nAlso you can share music with iTunes. \n\nA: There are various examples on the Internet of the iPhone being turned into a server for basic content serving. The issue is that it's not multimedia, which is your request.\nJailbreaking is about the only way you can create a server to allow access on a per-file basis, but will only allow downloading of files, not streaming. There are various legit apps on the App Store that allow one to make the iPhone into network storage, but I've yet to experiment with media and streaming possibilities.

The missing print to PDF feature on iPad (like that of Mac OS X) has been written about in a couple places on the web, but they all reference iPad apps that are no longer present in the App Store.\nIs there a way to get PDF generation in the iPad print dialog?\nHas Apple decided to pull such products from the App Store?\n\nA: On iPadOS 15 and other recent releases, taking a screen shot of Safari lets you capture the entire page as PDF. All apps can now share and print to PDF out of the box and only very specific apps that intentionally try to disable sharing can’t print these days. What a welcome change for iPad and iPadOS.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205751\nThe mark up tools are excellent and I find iPad so much better for this than even Windows 10 and macOS with Acrobat Pro installed.\n\nThose products didn't currently (and don't today) follow the accepted API that Apple provides for apps submitted to the App Store. Basically, Apple provides the print code and apps can't modify or extend the print function that iOS provides.\nUntil this changes, you will be bound to workarounds:\n\n*\n\n*Jailbreak the device and look for something that enables this function.\n\n*Print to a device that will render the job as PDF. I know of Printopia that will do explicitly this. You can even control which folder on the mac gets the PDF and have it uploaded back to the phone or to a private cloud so you can get at the PDF again systematically from iOS.\n\n*Use apps that can save to PDF like Pages and many others, but this is an app feature, not built into the main print settings.\n\n\nA: I'm using \"Print n Share Pro\" for document, web page and email conversion to PDF. It has its own full email and web browser so doesn't need AirPrint. It also supports \"Open in\" from other apps and cloud servers. Product page or iTunes\nIt saved my bacon when I had to submit a load of emails in PDF format for a customer support presentation.\n", "Q: How can I make an automator service always show up? I have an AppleScript that adds the subject of a selected email in Mail to my task manager.\nI have put this AppleScript in an Automator service so I can hotkey it.\nOnly problem is this: Lion insists on only showing the service when I have text selected. Somehow OS X thinks its a text based script even though I specified there is no input.\nIs there any way to have the service show up in the services menu independent of the selection I have?\n\nA: In Automator at the very top of your workflow, there is a dropdown box for which the prompt reads Service receives selected. If you are getting the results you report, the word text likely appears in the dropdown box. Change it to no input and save the service.\n\n", "Q: Can I connect a resistive touch panel to the iPad? I am wondering if it would be possible to connect a resistive touch panel (manufactured with a 30-pin connector) to the iPad through the 30-pin connection and use that for input?\n\nA: No chance I'm afraid, the limiting factor is software more than anything though, it's possible that an App could be written to talk to said accessory, but using it outside of that App would not be possible unless you are talking about a highly modified jailbroken solution.\nUnless you already have a device in mind that exists which you actually want to use, I can't imagine anyone creating one, and if they did not by the dock connector, but more likely over a custom Bluetooth protocol which is allowed (see the i-Cade games cabinet for example of a custom controller using Bluetooth that only works with supported apps).\nYou may be better mentioning what you wish to achieve to allow alternate answers, as I am almost positive that this method will never fly.\n\nA: it is possible to connect an external touchscreen capable of sending input to iphone:\nhttp://www.macstories.net/iphone/the-external-touchscreen-that-can-control-an-iphone/\n", "Q: Sanding off a MacBook's sharp edges The edges of both the MacBook Pro (aluminum case) and the MacBook (polycarbonate) are exceedingly sharp. Depending on my typing position, they dig in my wrists, an unpleasant and painful experience. Can you suggest a solution?\nSanding is one option. Did you perhaps sand-off the edges by using fine-sanding paper made for wood? Could you post an image of the result? It's understood it will not be as pretty afterwards, but being plain ugly is not an option either.\nGuards are another idea. People sometime use guards on furniture with sharp features to save their kids when bumping into them. Can you think of a similar product (off-the-shelf or homemade) for the edges of a MacBook?\nAddendum\nLooking back at this old question years later I'm puzzled at the critiques of ergonomics. It's a laptop (FHS). You can switch it on anywhere and start typing. It may be the least ergonomic desk and typing positions ever. Coffee shops, for one, do not appear to particularly choose heights for tables with an eye to typing positions, understandably.\nWhether polycarbonate or aluminum, the hard edge is painful on bare skin. The simplest solution (maybe this should technically be an answer, albeit a cheeky one) is to wear long sleeves. (If it's just too warm, ) The second-simplest solution is to carry a handkerchief along with the laptop and fold it to protect your skin. Either mimics the suggested glue-on solutions, but avoids ruining the clinically clean closure of a Macbook's screen.\nApple, if You're reading this, chamfer the (expletive) sharp front edges.\n\nA: I posted this DIY solution to the Apple Discussions thread here as well with a bit more \"story line\" as this isn't the place for that.\nI created a vinyl wrap for the front edge with some sort of \"padding\" under just the corner! This is just a prototype and I intend to have my wife use her Cameo to cut a custom design for the vinyl wraps.\n \nHere you can see that the vinyl is very thin and adds almost no thickness to the wrist area:\n\nYou can see the slight padding I have under the vinyl that just wraps the edge. For this \"prototype\" I just cut about a 1/4 inch strip of a paper towel. I used a \"towel\" type paper towel, not that harsh rough stuff. I had Viva brand on hand:\n\nIt's not impacting closing the MacBook at all as you can see here:\n\nI've used this for 2 days now working for approx 12 hours each day and I have no more harsh edge lines on my wrist. And she happened to have some scrap black vinyl that happens to match the keyboard perfectly. Looks pretty sweet. Of course I could find a brushed or just aluminum color so they would virtually be unnoticable.\nAlso, these are completely removeable without leaving any residue. If there is any left, it's very minor and removed by just slight rubbing of the residue. This is the same vinyl used for signs or crafts.\nI may have my wife cut these on her Cameo with the theme of the OS releases. Lion (would have been) lion paws, Mavericks will be waves and Yosemite will be silhouettes of El Capitan and maybe Sentinel Rock. But who knows, maybe they will be flames or something else fun. We'll see.  \n\nA: Here are some alternatives that you could consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*Silicone case that wraps around to the keyboard - see this macrumors thread. Note: it's a bit dated (2007), so not sure if they still sell these types of ccases/covers anymore.\n\n*Guard strip - example from Amazon here. Product description indicates that the main purpose is to address the issue of sharp edges for the MBP. Something like that probably fits the bill perfectly.\n\n*Wrist rest (foam/leather) - example from Amazon here. The rest may be able to put enough distance between your wrists and the edge.\n\n\nCaveat: I don't have any problem with the edge, so I've never used any of these products. But one of these might address your comfort without necessitating the filing down of your MBP's edge, which would probably hurt its resale value.\n\nA: A dremel type grinder would work for both. You'd want to mask off the case so you know when you're chewing too far into the top case. A guide or jig to hold the grinding wheel stationary would be better since you'd be less likely to go too far into the battery for example on the Polycarbonite model.\nIf you are dead set against changing your ergonomics so your wrists never know whether the edge is sharp or beveled, I would get help from someone in a machine shop that has experience with grinding. They will have practiced on many other items and likely have far better technique. The tools to both cut and polish polycarbonate and aluminum are different, but knowing how to clamp down the mac and use a metal file properly would come in handy - especially if the shop has the tools and clamps needed and you only have to supply the patient and perhaps the finishing abrasive and social lubricant to get the job done.\nIf you are going to go the DIY route, emery board might be better and less risky and you can control the amount of material that is removed over time. Start with that, even on the aluminum and work up to a metal file if needed.\nYou'll want a fine emery board to polish things either way, but do try to get a scrap case to test on before you start (or at least get a quote to replace the part should you like the modified case worse than the new edge.)\n\nA: The edges are sharp but they are also brittle. I never wore watches or bracelets but the angle of my aluminum MacBook Pro of 2011 was threadbare (like saw teeth).\nI used an old sticker (brand Venilia) of my grandmother who used to pad the inside of cupboards (strange old French modes!).\n\nPrice : $ 0! Risk: no! The material is soft to the touch, MacBook's closes well and I purposely hide the diode (\"Sleep indicator light\"), which for me was too bright at night!\n\nDesign inspiration come from this Latvian handywoman from Etsy :\nwww.etsy.com/listing/259580847/soot-sprite-macbook-decal-vinyl-laptop\n(It's my first post, not enough reputation to give you more pictures, sorry)\n\nA: Here's a youtube tutorial by a very brave person on how to file the edge off a MacBook Pro: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnGAlf1hjs4\nMore information is available here: http://onemansblog.com/2010/03/11/video-rant-taking-the-sharp-edge-off-the-macbook-pro/\n\nA: I used a small file to carefully round the sharp edge that was digging into my palms. It worked really well but left some scratch marks from the file. \nI finished cleaning it up with some light sandpaper. \nIf you do this, be very careful to ensure no aluminum dust gets inside the keys, speakers, or case. That would not be good.\n", "Q: Publicly sharing an iCal calendar to allow web viewing When using iCal in Snow Leopard, I shared a calendar.\nI had two options for this - either a privately shared, editable calendar, or a publicably shared, view-only calendar. I used the latter option, and was provided with two URLs - one of which allowed my friends and colleagues to subscribe (via their own iCal or other software) and the other of which was an ordinary web address, that allowed them to view my calendar in their web browser.\nIt's this latter type that I'm now trying to set up in iCloud, but I can't seem to find an option to do so - neither in iCloud itself nor on iCal running on Lion.\nAny ideas, please?\n\nA: In iCal, click the \"Calendars\" button in the upper-left corner, just under the traffic light. Right-click on the calendar you want to share, then select \"Share Calendar...\" This will open a new dialog, allowing the choice you mentioned between sharing read-only with everyone, or editable with invitees; make your selection and hit \"Share\".\nOnce the calendar is shared, again click the Calendar button and right-click the calendar you just shared, this time selecting \"Copy URL to Clipboard\".\n(There's also a \"Stop Sharing\" option, in case you ever change your mind.)\n", "Q: LilyPond on Lion Did you succeed in installing LilyPond on Lion?

Should I update to iOS 5 and will it run as smooth as iOS 4?\n\nA: No rush. If you're having a smooth experience with OS 4 for now, keep using that OS and wait a few updates... the first version (in this case 5.0) always has a few bumps. I know I have!\nBut if you need any one of the new gadgets (like iCloud, or iMessage), then you can switch anytime. Just make sure you do a full sync before with your iTunes (the one the iPod has always been synched to) and do a restore, not an update. It'll clean up the whole iPod and start fresh, then sync your personal data. Installing a fresh OS from time to time really does help... :-)\n", "Q: Where will the incident with the sudo command be reported to? If a non-admin types a sudo command in Terminal, this will appear after they enter their password:\nUser is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported.\nWhere is this reported to?\n\nA: \nIn older versions of OS X (through 10.6 or maybe 10.7), the disallowed sudo attempt would be logged in /var/log/secure.log; in more recent versions it's recorded in the ASL (Apple System Log) database, in /var/log/asl/*. You can read this with the Console.app utility (select ALL MESSAGES in the sidebar, then if you can't find them use the search field in the upper right to search for sudo). You can also use the command-line syslog command to query the database (syslog -k Facility authpriv -k Sender sudo should do it). Note that with either Console.app or syslog, the entries will only be visible if you are running as an admin or root.\n\nSource\n\nA: The event will be logged in /var/log/secure.log and a mail will be sent to root (which by default goes to /dev/null which is Unix speak for it is discarded).\n\nA: it will be emailed to their apple id, i have found\n", "Q: Contacts details not displayed on iPad I'm having a problem with the Contacts app on my iPad. Basically I can't see anymore the contact details. This is what I can see on the right page:\n\nI've rebooted my iPad, closed the app from the multitasking bar, synced etc. but it still doesn't work.\nI'm wondering if the only solution is to restore my device (I would like to not have to do it..)\n\nA: I managed to fix the problem by adding a dummy contact - when I saved it, the contact information was visible again. Just deleted the dummy contact afterwards.\n\nA: I have experience with iCloud and my guess is iCloud is causing the problem. If you've checked what's on iCloud (gone to your address book in the cloud) and it's complete, uncheck iCloud's Contacts checkbox on the iPad and when you set it up again, don't merge but replace what's on the iPad with what's on iCloud. I had problems when I started with iCloud and it took a few tries to get things all working together.\n\nA: Simple solution - works for many people (worked for me, after several weeks of frustration!): create a new user - type in a few details, then save. Hey presto, you can see the contact details on the right-hand side again!\n\nA: Unfortunately, I've only been able to solve it by resetting the iPad.\n", "Q: Is it possible to run a shell script when the iChat online status changes on Lion?

For some reason it doesn't work anymore in Lion.\nIs there a way to trigger a shell script on online/offline status change in 10.7 without even launching iChat?\n\nA: Option 1: run a script like this every minute or so with cron or launchd:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd=~/Library/Caches/me.lri.scripts\nmkdir -p $cd\ncf=$cd/ichatstatuscheck\nstatus=$(osascript -e \"tell app \\\"iChat\\\" to status\")\n[[ -f $cf && \"$status\" != $(cat $cf) ]] && say \"$status\"\necho \"$status\" > $cf\n\n(The script activates iChat every time it's run.)\n\nOption 2: save this as a stay open application in AppleScript Editor:\nrepeat\n    tell application \"iChat\"\n        set prev to status\n        delay 5\n        if status is not prev then do shell script \"say \" & quoted form of status\n    end tell\nend repeat\n\n(Also activates iChat every time it gets the status.)\n\nOption 3: use an iChat event handler (thanks Kopischke)\n\nThis worked for me on Lion, but only when iChat was active.

The default data directory is /Library/PostgreSQL/$VERSION/data, so rm -rf that directory (or wherever you instructed the installer to create it).\nTo remove your postgres user (assuming it is named 'postgres'), first list your users to verify that the user 'postgres' and group 'postgres' are what you expect: (just a safe check) before deleting anything.\n\nsudo dscl . -read /Users/postgres\n\n\nsudo dscl . -read /Groups/postgres\n\nLook for the \"real name\" field, to ensure that it matches the version of the db you are removing. \nThen remove the user and groups:\n\nsudo dscl . -delete /Users/postgres\n\n\nsudo dscl . -delete /Groups/postgres\n\nObviously, be careful when using sudo. \n\nA: The uninstallation instructions are at the bottom of the installation guide linked from that download page.\n", "Q: Is iCloud is not backing up my iPhone completely? My iCloud is not backing up my device (iPhone 4 with iOS 5.0.0) completely.\nWhen I try to backup my Contact List or Mails via iCloud; It only backups the newest added contacts or recent mails. (Beginning from last restore) For example. I have 220 contacts, I added 10 more after updating to iOS 5 (fresh restore) When I run iCloud. It only backups the 10 contacts. \nIs this how it is supposed to work?\n\nA: Here a link to a Macworld article that contains a terrific explanation of how iCloud backups work. The answer to your question is that iCloud performs incremental backups--only what has changed since the last backup will be sent to iCloud on the following backup. \nThis means that, for example, if the initial iCloud backup contained 2.0 GB of data and then only 0.1 GB of data changed (say, Address Book contacts), then only those 0.1 GB will be sent to iCloud. This saves battery and avoids transferring data that iCloud already knows about. This is the same principle behind Time Machine on the Mac. \n(There are other nice things that iCloud does for the sake of efficiency. For instance, your iTunes purchases are not sent to the iCloud backup, only their references, since Apple already has the songs themselves in iTunes)\nIn general, I would say that if you backup regularly, then each subsequent backup should stay relatively small and should complete in a short time. The exception is, naturally, when you have recently added large amounts of media like photographs or video taken from the Camera app. \nI recommend giving that article a read. It is very comprehensive. Hope this helps. \n\nA: Well, Apple will likely be doing incremental backups in order to keep space requirements down, so it means it will only backup the changes from last time. However, that assumes that a complete backup has been done once first, not sure if this is the case for you? (e.g. the first backup should be of all your contacts).\n", "Q: Time capsule router performance Just bought latest generation 2Tb Time Capsule that replaced my old USB drive for Time Machine backups and my Belkin G router. Everything runs fine except when I start downloading torrents. With Belkin, I could run several downloads, work remotely on three machines, and my wife could be streaming Netflix over Apple TV. Now, with Transmission running a 2.1MB/s download and no Netflix streaming, my remote connections feel like I am on dial-up. This is really disappointing. Any suggestions on how to fix it? I know I can throttle the torrents but I also frequently download large files for work and I can't just sit there waiting for download to finish before I can continue working remotely. \n\nA: The TC router really isn't as great as it could be, I would go back to using the belkin as your wireless network and have the TC running from it.\nI have a 500gb TC used on a SKY router, I have used it as a router, but also found it was slow.\n\nA: Don't forget about latency.\nTorrenting has a tendency to open an unusually high number of concurrent connections that create a lot of chatter on the network and exhaust the router's memory by overloading the NAT cache. 'Feels like a 56k connection' can be a symptom that your router is having difficulty handling the load. A high number of dropped packets (requiring re-transmission) is another.\nAn quick fix is to simply reduce the number of connections. Unless you're swarm peers all have very slow upstream bandwidth, it shouldn't impact your download speed much.\nNote: The NAT Cache is where the router stores the mapping of connections between the remote user public IP and the local user's private IP.\nYou can configure it in Transmission under...\nTransmission->Preferences->Peers->Global Number of Connections\n\nManufacturers (incl Apple) have a tendency to cheap out on the router hardware because it won't have a negative impact on the 'average' user.\nSideNote: The lack of QOS capabilities on the TC is pretty lame.\n", "Q: Why can't my MacBook Air run Software Update? One of the first things that I tried to do when I got my new MacBook Air out of the box was upgrade iTunes to 10.5 (through Software Update). It downloaded the files (four different updates in total), verified data, then started to write the files, at which point it stopped and said that it couldn’t complete the update.\nSince then I’ve also downloaded the .dmg file for the iTunes upgrade and for the Lion 10.7.2 combo.  My .dmgs can't be verified though; I get an invalid checksum error. I’ve downloaded them a bunch of times too just in case they were corrupted.\nThen thinking that because it’s a new machine, I can just refresh the OS and start again, I tried the cmd+r boot and tried to just reinstall and it said:\n\nCan’t install the additional components needed to install Mac OS X.\n\n\nA: This is an ancient question (bumped by Community♦), but invalid checksum doesn't have anything to do with admin privileges, it is a bad download.\nSince you tried multiple times you are either not getting the file despite the multiple tries, or the original file you are downloading is not complete. \nI would look for another way to get the update. \n\nA: Have you tried checking if you are an admin user of the system? Did you set an admin password when you first booted the system?\nYou can check this by opening the Terminal app (press Cmd+Space to call Spotlight and type \"Terminal\" there or go to Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal) and enter\nsudo ls\n\nYou will be asked for a password. Enter the password for your user.\nIf it doesn't give an error message, you are the admin of the system and the error could be something else (go to Apple Store asap, you can get a LOT of help from them in resolving such issues).\nIf it gives you an error, that could just be the root cause of your problem. Open the System Preferences app and go to Users and Groups under the System section. There, select your user and tick the \"Allow user to administer this computer\" option and restart/log out and log back in. \nThis should resolve your problem. Else call/email/go to the Apple Store and get their help (for free).\nSilly note- When I read just the question, I thought you are a tech admin and are having a problem in your organization as an MBA grad who is using a Mac is not able to install updates on his machine! :)\n", "Q: How to shrink a Windows XP VMWare Fusion virtual machine?

I am a video editor and I want to split up my 42 inch TV into multiple desktops. I want to shrink the display into multiple shrunk sections, so the Mac Pro thinks that there are 2 or 4 monitors hooked up but there is actually only one super freaking huge TV, made to look like 4 monitor displays. I want to have sharper resolution. Just having a bigger screen isn't doing it for me. I need 2 monitors for Final Cut Pro - not just big Final Cut Pro windows.\nI do not want to \"Size Up\" or Split the screen into multiple windows, I want multiple displays. I want to trick my monitor into thinking that there more than one display. \nAny ideas. It looks like Microsoft has similar programs but nothing for Mac. \n\nA: You wouldn't necessarily get \"sharper\" resolution - splitting a 1080p HDTV into two monitors side-by-side would result in two 960x1080 displays:\n+----------------+    +--------+--------+\n|                |    |        |        |\n|                | -> |        |        |\n|                | -> |        |        |\n|                |    |        |        |\n+----------------+    +--------+--------+\n\nIs that what you're looking for? Despite the admonishments in your question, I don't think that's really what you're looking for. You'll get the exact same thing by just resizing your FCP windows to take up half the screen and putting both of them on the same screen. (You're stuck with the 1920x1080 pixels your display has any way you slice it.)\nIn (more-direct) answer to your question: no, I don't think such programs exist.\nNote: I'm not familiar with Final Cut Pro, so I'm assuming it's multi-screen behavior is implemented with multiple windows. \n\nA: You can use BetterDummy to make your virtual displays, then do PIP window streaming without title bar. NOTE that the PIP streaming is only available with the $15 Pro version.\n", "Q: Cancelled wireless Migration Assistant... best way to start over? I was using the Migration Assistant utility to transfer data from my old MacBook Pro to my new Mac.  I didn't anticipate issues using Wi-Fi, but the transfer of 250 GB of data using wasn't going to end within a day of starting, so I interrupted it and I intend on starting over using a wired network (or target mode disk connection) to speed the transfer.\nHowever, now it says my HD on the new one has 60 GB occupied and I dont know where this exists. My created account has no documents/apps/etc.  I want to delete this and start fresh if the software won't clean up an aborted transfer reliably.\nWhat is the best way to start over?\n\nA: If the destination MBP is brand new, save yourself some trouble, restore it from factory and run the Migration Assistant again.\nHowever you can probably run it again and everything should be ok, it really depends what you have and what has been copied. Check /Library/ and ~/Library (use the Terminal), for example if you had GarageBand or Garage Band Jam Packs, those may have been partially copied. \nI did that when I brought an MBAir. It was taking so much that I aborted, cloned my other Mac's drive and used a USB drive to do the migration.\n\nA: The Mac will intelligently continue where it left off on the Migration Assistant. You do not need to worry about removing any duplicate files.\n", "Q: Getting 10.6.7 Build 10J869 installed on an 17\" MacBook Pro 8,3 (Early 2011)  I have a MacBook Pro8,3 (Early 2011) with 10.6.7 build 10J4139 installed on it and I need to get Build 10J869 installed. \nNow, I can obtain a combo or delta update for build 10J869 from https://developer.apple.com/downloads, but neither seem to want to install on top of build 10J4139.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Have you tried simply installing 10J869 to an external drive? Then you could migrate the data over and finally use disk utility or deploy studio to clone the external OS back over the internal drive. \nIn your case, the drivers needed to properly install (or at least pass the preinstall script checking for the correct hardware) were never included in a build earlier than 10.6.6 / 10J3210\nYou can consult the list of builds that supported each Mac Model upon release at Mac OS X versions (builds) for computers.\nSince you are trying to get an older build running - do expect things like slow performance, odd fan behavior, graphics issues and perhaps worse if you manage to get the 10J869 build running.\nAt this point, you have two less than optimal avenues for getting the build on the mac you intend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the install from a mac that will run 10J869 - you can install to the MacBook Pro in target mode or use a disk tool to transfer the data.\n\n*Modify Apple's install package to disable the check for this hardware ( or flip the comparison ) and hope the install goes well running from your mac.\n\n\nSometimes running an older version of the OS is harmless, so depending on how urgently you need this, you might give it a go and report back how it works.\n", "Q: Is it possible to always start an application fullscreen? After searching online for some time I was unable to find a real answer. \nIt it possible to start an application (i.e. Chrome) in a way that it always goes fullscreen?\n\nA: Yes.\nJust leave the app in full screen mode when you quit the application. As long as it's using Lion's full screen library (and not some hack of its own), the next time you start the app it will start back up in full screen mode.\nJust tested this with Safari and Sparrow and they both restarted in full screen mode. Chrome 15.0.874.106, however, did not. I don't think Chrome's full screen support on Lion is quite right, it might not be using Lion's full screen window methods in the ways necessary to have it resume in full screen mode.\n\nA: The best solution I can find is the shortcut \"alt+⌘+F\" for Full Screen mode. \nFind the shortcut for the one you want in the View menu.\n", "Q: What does \"when iMessage is unavailable\" mean? In the settings for the iOS 5 Messages app there is an option to send messages as SMS \"when iMessage is unavailable\". Under what conditions is this the case? Is it merely the obvious (no data connection available or the iMessage server is down, or the message sits undelivered for a time), or is it more subtle (for example, the service simply not having had time to confirm that the recipient has iMessage enabled, or that the recipient's device cannot be contacted at the time of sending)? \nPhrased another way: what are the conditions under which an (intended) iMessage wold go undelivered, and are there other events that would cause a message to be delivered as an SMS?\n\nA: It means either \n\n\n*\n\n*when the device is unable to determine if a message has been delivered over the iMessage transport successfully. When a successful delivery occurs you see a little 'Delivered' notification below the message in the history, and after a period you should have the option to resend as an SMS\n\n*or the recipient has no registration with the iMessage server to indicate that it could use the iMessage transport and will use SMS instead.\n\nA: Another scenario I've discovered is when I'm connected to a WiFi signal that requires HTTP authentication. If I bring up the browser and authenticate, I'm fine. However, if I just let the iPhone connect to the WiFi, but I don't bring up the browser to authenticate, then the data network will be seen as dead, and any iMessage attempts will fallback to SMS (green dialog boxes). But then, as soon as I bring up the browser to authenticate, my conversation will switch back to iMessage (blue dialog boxes). So unless I remember to keep re-authenticating to the wireless network with the browser, my best bet it to just \"Forget this network\" and allow the iMessage to be sent over the AT&T data network, then it will remain as an iMessage.\n\nA: An example of a failed iMessage: I do not have a data plan. If I send or am sent an iMessage, and I happen to walk outside of the Wi-Fi point I'm connected to, it can fail to send, forcing me to then send as SMS.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: iMessage uses an internet connection to send a message to another Apple device, if you do not have a 3G data plan or internet connection it will not work, that also goes for the person who is receiving the message, if they do not have a connection it will fail to deliver.\nI know someone with a 3G without a 3G data plan (dont ask) and in order to send a SMS you will need to double tap the sent message and choose 'send as SMS'\n\nA: My understanding is that what this setting controls is the choice between SMS and MMS when iMessage is unavailable.  Apple has a support document iOS: Using Messages that says \n\nOn iPhone, if iMessage is unavailable, the message may be sent as SMS\n  or MMS, depending on content. Carrier messaging rates may apply. You\n  can adjust this behavior in iPhone at Settings > Messages > Send As\n  SMS. Messages sent using iMessage appear in a light blue bubble, while\n  messages sent using SMS or MMS appear in a green bubble.\n\nSo, as I interpret it, if you have this setting off, then a message that can't be sent via iMessage may be sent as either an SMS or an MMS.  If you turn the setting on, a message that can't be sent via iMessage will only be sent as an SMS.\n\nA: @Kristy, you are confusing a few different things.  To clarify:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMessage sends messages (not necessarily SMS texts).\n\n*iMessage is capable of sending messages in three ways: within iMessage, as SMS text, and as MMS messages.\n\n*iMessage attempts to send messages within iMessage.  This is only possible when you have enabled iMessage and are sending to recipients who have Apple devices with iMessage enabled.\n\n*When a message cannot be sent within iMessage, it might be sent as an SMS or MMS\n\n*If the message has multiple recipients or contains attachments (such as pictures or video), iMessage normally sends it as as an MMS since it exceeds the capability of SMS\n\n*If you set the option to send as SMS, that tells iMessage to not send it as MMS\n\n\nHere are some reasons why you or your recipients might either prefer or want to avoid sending messages within iMessage or as MMS:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMessage uses your data service\n\n*SMS is its own service\n\n*Depending on your cell service company (carrier), MMS may be its own service or might use your data service\n\n\niMessage is not really free but rather, because it uses your data service, it depends on your data service package.  There is no special or secret \"deal\" between Apple and the carriers specifically for iMessage.\n\n\n*\n\n*Some cell plans have monthly data caps, while others offer \"unlimited\" data.  Even with \"unlimited\" data, usually data usage over a certain amount is throttled down to lower speeds.\n\n*Some cell plans charge per each SMS, others have monthly limits on SMS, while some have unlimited SMS\n\n*MMS may be charged against data usage or may have a per-MMS charge or may come in blocks of MMS\n\n\nSo, if you or your recipients have a cell plan that offers, say, unlimited SMS but capped data, you or your recipients might prefer to disable iMessage and use SMS instead.  Or, if you have an unlimited data plan and pay a per-SMS charge, you might prefer to send as much as possible via iMessage.  Even with an \"unlimited\" data plan, if you use enough data to be throttled down to lower speeds later in the month, you might prefer to disable iMessage. Or you might enjoy the extra benefits of iMessage and keep it enabled.\n\nA: Okay peeps, listen up! iMessage is an IOS 5+ ONLY software that sends sms texts between 2 or more IDevices that BOTH have IOS 5+. It uses your cellphones internet connection to do this. If iMessage is enabled, and you send a message to another user that has IOS 5 or IOS 5.1, the message will show up on your screen colored blue instead of the usual green color of texts (Note: This is a good way to check if iMessage is working, as well as a way to check if the person you are texting has IOS 5)\nNow for the perks of iMessage. When using iMessage, all texts sent using this feature are completely free through a deal Apple made with AT&T, Verizon and Sprint (Altough Sprint is like a secondary company, so if you are using google voice, and have a different number on Google Voice then your actual cell number, iMessage MIGHT be disabled) so if you bought an IPhone, and are using a SIM card from a different company, well, tough luck I guess. There IS a reason why only SOME companies sell Iphones you know.\nWhen using iMessage, if you leave the screen on the messages app, waiting for the person to reply, it kind of has a Skype-looking feature, that whenever the person is typing, you will actually get a \"dot dot dot\" (...) on the bottom left, right above the keyboard.\nThe option in settings to send messages as SMS \"when iMessage is unavailable\" simply means if you are using the Sprint/Google Voice combo mentioned above, or if the person you are messaging does NOT have the IOS 5+ software (meaning they can NOT receive iMessages) then the phone will send a normal text message (carrier rates apply).\nHope this helped out. If I figure out anything else, I'll edit this later.\n\nA: On iPhone, if iMessage is unavailable, the message may be sent as SMS or MMS, depending on content. Carrier messaging rates may apply. You can adjust this behavior in iPhone at Settings > Messages > Send As SMS. Messages sent using iMessage appear in a light blue bubble, while messages sent using SMS or MMS appear in a green bubble.\nThe above comes from Apple's support article.\n", "Q: Why is my computer name new-host-2.home on the network? I configured my computer name to \"Macbook of Matthieu\" in the network sharing preferences.\nHowever, this name end up being used: new-host-2.home, how can I change that?\n\nA: The \".home\" domain sounds like it might be something your router is providing. Check your router's settings for a DNS server configuration. If you want to use the Bonjour/mDNS \".local\" names, then turn off the router's DNS server, or tell it to act only as a proxy for your ISP's DNS service.\nUnfortunately, the specifics of these settings, and even how they are named, vary widely across routers. You will have to look up instructions for your specific router model.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences, then the Sharing Pane. You can change the name of the computer there. \nThis sometimes happens when a new computer replaces an old one, or a new version of an OS is installed.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: If you are looking at the shared Mac from a Windows machine, the discovery is done through Microsoft Network, which uses NetBIOS layer to get the name of the hosts. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS\nThe NetBIOS name is set up in OS X from the Network Properties panel, as shown in the image bellow.\nIf, you are having issues with the name seen under OS X, than you might have a synchronisation name problem, as described in the topic bellow:\nWhy does my iMac have one name under sharing, but then say 'new-host3.home' as well?\n\nA: If your able to find the mac then you wil see its your own the answer you find her: whatismyipaddress.com/ipv4-parts\nAs you see the mac's are al the same as one of my pc's\nYou can copy past it in macvendor to find whitch pc\n", "Q: Why are some Mail messages shown as empty with \"This message has no content\"? Sometimes new messages come in and Mail (on OS X Lion and Mountain Lion) shows them as empty, with \"This message has no content\" in the preview column. The message is empty in the full message view window.\nI'm connected to Exchange 2010 on the backend.\nWhen I open Outlook for Mac I can see the mail, and it's definitely not empty.\nWhen I quit and restart Mail the message appears in its entirety, but the middle Mail column (with the subject/from/snippet in it) still says \"This message has no content\".\nSo a Mail restart sort of fixes the problem, but it's quite annoying.\nI didn't have this problem pre-Lion with the same Exchange backend.\n\nA: This is a sync issue that periodically affects exchange clients (Outlook included from time to time).  It is particularly prevalent if you have large numbers of messages in your inbox (rather than in sub-folders).\nThe quick fix is to drag the message to a local folder, the mail will generally display correctly at that point.  If it is dragged back to the exchange folders it will remain displayed since the message is now correctly stored in the local cache.\n\nA: In my case: Select the message; Choose from menu View > Message > 'Raw Source'. Now close the 'Source window'. Select that message again. Contents appear now.\n\nA: I just had a user with a similar problem in Yosemite. She could read the original message, but once she moved into a new folder on the IMAP email server, she couldn't see anything other than the header info.\nTurns out the folder had a semi-colon in its name. Once I changed it to a dash, all the messages appeared correctly.\n\nA: I don't know why this happens either, but did I find a workaround that's a bit more lightweight than restarting Mail.app:\n\nDelete the message, and hit CMD-Z (undo delete) immediately after that. This brings back the message, including its lost content.\n\n\nA: I can confirm in MacOS Sierra 10.12.6 this issue still exists. I am getting undeliverable mail messages from GMAIL for my newsletter sign up. On my gmail account I can see the MIME encapsulated content. In the mail.app I only get a \"This message has no content\" message.\nHowever, when viewing Raw Source as the above comment says, the display window will now show the content of the email, but the 4-line snippet still says \"This message has no content\".\nI also get these kinds of issues for my Google Groups post approval/rejection emails from Google.\nSince both of these are auto-generated emails I get from Google, I suspect Google is either not conforming to an email rule or Apple is not conforming to an email rule.\n\nA: I had this issue on macOS Monterey (12.2.1), and other solutions didn't work for me. However, disabling the option Privacy > Protect Mail Activity worked for me. I left on Hide IP address and it still worked. Since that option is half of what Protect Mail Activity does, I'm guessing the background loading of remote content has a bug.\n", "Q: How can I sync places between iPhone and computer?

If so, either replace it with a copy from another Mac (so it can be disabled properly), or reboot the computer (since it doesn't exist, it won't get loaded on reboot).\n\nA: Perhaps try sudo killall httpd? I'd also check Console to see if there's any errors.\n\nA: If you're missing launch daemons from your /System/ folder, the best long-term solution is to perform an Archive and Install so that you keep your content and simply rebuild your damaged operating system.\n\nA: The only way to fix it was to reinstall OS X.\n", "Q: Can you get a line-in port on a MBA via an external device? I have a macbook air and I really want to plug in my guitar to garage band, but unfortunately the air doesn't have a line-in port.

I am working on some bash shell scripting for a local login script and it works fine on Leopard and Snow Leopard but fails on Lion.  I was curious if there was a place that listed the differences in bash on Lion?\n\nA: Assuming a SnowLeopard or Lion installation that has the latest software updates, the version of Bash is the same. 3.2.48(1)-release.\nOn SnowLeopard you may have a 32bit compilation in some cases, whereas on Lion it is (by default) 64bit.\nThe command username=\"$(whoami)\" is extemely unlikely to ever change it's output on bash, since doing so would incur the fast moving, brain devouring wrath of an infinite number of ravenous zombie sysadmin types. \n(By the way sysadmins are almost never undead, despite the occasional appearance to the contrary. The description was added for dramatic effect, and no offence to sysadmins was intended. I offer my heartfelt apology to any actual undead sysadmins, and their families, and I urge them to grab a shotgun immediately and barricade the bedroom door, double tap to be sure.)\n\nA: Within bash, the command echo $BASH_VERSION shows the version of bash. You can then look up what changed in the changelog file, which is bash's case is called CHANGES. (There's a more complete changelog in the sources, but it's mainly of interest to people who write and maintain bash.)\nIf your machines are up-to-date, they'll be running the same version. Make sure all the external programs used in the script are up-to-date too: the script may behave differently because one of these programs produces different output.\nYou can watch what your script is doing more closely by running bash -x /path/to/script. The -x option makes bash print a trace for each command that it runs. You can also put set -x in a script to turn tracing on, and set +x to turn it off.\n", "Q: Can I view the list of songs within a podcast while playing it?

(for using Time Machine) I just plugged in an external hard drive that has Firewire 800 and started Time Machine, but it seems that both the internal hard drive and external hard drive work frantically copying about 75GB of data from the iMac to the external hard drive.\nAnd in fact, I dare not use the computer while it is copying that much data, as I don't want to over work the hard drive's head.\nIf it is the case of Time Capsule, backing up using Wireless, then won't it actually work better, because if Wireless-G is limited to 1 or 1.5MB of data per second, then it won't stress the hard drive, and user can work on anything without affecting the hard drive's hard work?\n(Updated: Details: 1MB/s, instead of about 75MB per second if using the Firewire 800.  In that case, the user can use the Mac and won't stress the hard drives, especially if the Mac OS X might read 50MB at a time, and put that data in RAM (as a hard disk cache), and just pass this data to TIme Capsule by Wireless-G -- then there is no need to read any data again until 50 seconds later, if assuming the copy speed is about 1MB/s.  Would this be true?)\n\nA: That last paragraph is very difficult to understand, but if I follow, creating a RAM disk is not going to help...primarily because there's no problem to fix in the first place; Your concerns are unwarranted. \nTime Capsule hard drives in particular are very low failure rate, and above that, Time Machine does not tax your system indefinitely. When the timer starts a new backup, the hard drive will spin up. On completion, it will spin down as necessary. These drives, like most of decent quality today have a high MTBF & MTTF, so relax.\n\nA: There is nothing to worry about. Hard drives are designed to work in high-load environments. Furthermore, that data access is not very common (most backups will be very little data after the initial backup completes) and rather elastic - either you're reading 50MB/sec for a minute, or reading 1MB/sec for fifty minutes. Both produce an similar amount of \"work\" for the drive.\n", "Q: Lion: Application's window size doesn't persist after quit/re-open (Disclaimer: I'm not sure if my question is isolated to Skim.app – if so, it's fine if someone changes the title to reflect that – or if it's a Lion thing.)\nI'm using Skim to read PDFs.\nEvery time I …\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a document\n\n*Resize the window to cover my whole screen\n\n*Quit the application\n\n*Re-open the document\n\n\n… the application's window revert to small size (about 2/3 of my screen instead of the whole screen.\nI find this very annoying, as I expect the application's window size to persist after closing and re-opening the app.\n\nA: If you find the window size of one app not retaining the window size value after closing it, the suspect is the .plist for that app. ~/Library/Preferences/ should contain the file. Deleting it while the app is closed and re-opening it will forcibly rebuild it with minimal negative impact to the app itself.\n", "Q: Use Apple Wireless Keyboard for PC and Mac I need a wireless keyboard and mouse that I can switch between my MacBook Pro and PC.\nI was looking at the Apple Wireless Keyboard, but I'm not sure if I can change from PC to Mac usage easily enough.\nDoes anyone have a similar setup?\n\nA: As per Bluetooth functionality, one would have to pair/unpair with the chosen device to switch to another system. It's worth noting that Apple by no means supports PC's to work with their accessories, and a quick search will show you plenty of people having a less-than-stellar experience trying to make it work. A more appropriate long-term solution is a wired keyboard and a KVM to switch between systems.\n\nA: The Bluetooth Apple Wireless Keyboard is able to be connected and used with a Win PC as long as the Win PC supports bluetooth.\n", "Q: Using two 30\" LCD screens with a MacBook Pro How can I use two 30\" LCD screens with my 2011 MacBook Pro?\n\nA: The problem with the USB2VGA is that you won't be able to drive the full resolution of a 30 in, which is 2560x1600.\nTechnically, the 2011 MB Pro is capable to drive the 2 monitors, but since there is only one thunderbolt connector you can only connect one Mini Display Monitor. You can however connect two Apple Thunderbolt displays, since they connect to the MB Pro using Thunderbolt and not Display Port. Then you would have the use of the full resolution of both displays.\nSorry, but a 30 in monitor is the biggest one that can be connected to any computer, adding one is asking a lot from a connectors-limited portable...\nGood luck!\n\nA: Connect your first LCD with the miniDisplayPort to VGA/DVI converter.  And connect your second LCD with a USB2VGA cable.\n", "Q: How can I image my Macbook Pro's hard drive prior to sending to Apple for repair? I don't just want to back up my data. In case the hard drive comes back completely wiped I want to avoid the hassle of reinsalling everying OS X as well as a Bootcamped Windows install.\nWhat tools can I use to backup/image my hard drive such that when I got my laptop back and if I needed to, I could just dump the image back onto the hard drive and be right back where I was last?\n\nA: I would choose either SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner. Make a clone of your hard drive that is a bit-perfect bootable copy. You can either use an external drive or one of those docks that you pop bare drive into. \nSuperDuper costs just under $30. Carbon Copy Cloner is donationware. Either one is great. But I like CCC because it can schedule cloning sessions on a regular basis.\n\nA: If you're running OS X 10.5 (Leopard) or higher, you could just run a Time Machine backup on the system. Restoring from that will return your system to the state at that time.\n", "Q: How can I put a Lion installer on a Flash Drive? Could someone please list the steps to make a backup Lion install on a flash drive? Is it as simple as copying the Lion installer?\n\nA: Your best bet is to follow the instructions on this page.\nThings you'll need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Flash drive bigger than 4 GB (8 GB+ would be best)\n\n*InstallESD.dmg (extracted from the OS X Lion App, if you've saved it prior to the upgrade)\n\n\nThere's an alternate method mentioned here.\nNote: If you don't have the  Lion Install App, follow the instructions on this page to download it again.\n", "Q: Is there some kind of app that will allow other people to make my iPhone beep while in silent mode So first here's the problem.  I used to be a Blackberry user and could selectively turn things silent/off/loud but with the iPhone it seems to be an all or nothing deal.  I run a small company so I need to be able to be reached in the event something goes wrong and I'm sleeping.  My old system for this was to turn everything to silent except for voice calls which would play a loud ringtone to wake me up.  I don't get many voice calls except for work related stuff so this worked perfectly.\nThe question is can I replicate this somehow on the iPhone?  Even if there was some kind of app that could play a noise and notify me when someone needed something.  I know it's possible based on this StackOverflow question but short of writing my own app is there anything out there that can help?\n\nA: You can use Find my iPhone to remotely play a sound, even if your phone is in silent mode. Requires someone to trigger it in the web interface or iOS app.\n\nA: I haven't tried this but ... assuming you are running iOS 5, under Settings -> Sounds where you can pick a tone for each kind of alert, it looks like \"None\" is a choice in all the categories. So you could turn off sounds for everything except the Ringtone.\n", "Q: How to make emacs style ASCII-art table in Mail?

To automate it, you should use QuickCursor (available in the Mac App Store), and a special build of Emacs, which you can do by checking out the latest source code from ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest and then using the patches available from ftp://ftp.math.s.chiba-u.ac.jp/emacs\nInstruction on how to build are available in the archive containing the patch file. Once you've done that, editing between Emacs and Mail (or whatever else), should be extremely easy.\n\nA: How about creating a table in HTML and attaching it? I just emailed one to myself (with Mail), and I had to click on the attachment to view it in a web browser (Safari).

I don't want to sort the files and folders using the \"Labels\" (because of the colors). I just want to have the list ordered the way I want...\nIs this possible ?\n\nA: You could make a custom sort order using Spotlight Comments. Show the Comments column in your Finder window (View > Show View Options), then enter Spotlight Comments into your files (File > Get Info) so that they sort in the order you want. You could also use these comments for Spotlight searches and smart folders.\n\nYou can use Automator to add the same comment to a whole batch of files by creating an Automator Service (for contextual menu) or Application (for drag & drop) and using the \"Set Spotlight Comments for Finder Items\" action. Make sure to change \"Service receives selected\" to files or folders. To have Automator ask you what text to use for the comment, show the Options for the \"Set Spotlight Comments\" action and check Show this action when the workflow runs.\n\n", "Q: How do you get a printer's IP in lion?

I would like to make a quite simple \"special effect\" in a short movie : showing \"me\" two times in the same room (for instance sitting at the same table and talking to each other). \nCan I do this with iMovie and how ?\n\nA: There are some good tutorials on this on Youtube here and here. The problem in both of these examples is the obvious lines where you can see the contrast and lightness changes.\nHowever if you had either Adobe Premiere Elements or Adobe After effects this effect is a lot easier, and more professional like this you can find those tutorials here (Premiere) and here (After effects)\nHave a rummage around the Creative Cow website for good tutorials\n\nA: For that you need to put the first video if yourself in one layer, and the other one on the layer on top of it, and crop the top one (cropping tutorial).

But when I plug in the iPhone 4 (the old one) into the iMac, then I can't drag Music, Movies, or iTunes Univ videos into this old iPhone. (in iTunes 10.5 on the iMac, I can't drag and drop any Music to the iPhone 4 under DEVICES)\nWhat is a proper way to start sync'ing with the iMac if it was sync'ing with the PC before?  I just want the iPhone 4 \"as is\", but sync'ing to the iMac instead of the PC.  (want to keep iOS 4.3.5 because I might do some development work and want to test on iOS 4.3.5)  Are there other precautions to take note of when changing which machine to sync to?\n\nA: You can only sync a device to one computer, however if you can locate the backup folder, these contain lots of files which all need to be moved across to the other computer and it thinks it has always backed up this device. Locate it on your PC depending on the OS below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows XP: %AppData%\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\n\n*Windows Vista: %AppData%\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\n\n*Windows 7: %AppData%\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\nand transfer this file to your Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS: ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup\nYou will need to authorise your new iTunes account and transfer all your music and apps.\n", "Q: How can I get my own apps onto my jailbroken iPhone? I want to be able to test the apps I am creating on my jaikbroken iPhone 3Gs, and I want to know how I can get my apps from xCode onto my device without a developer account.\n\nA: This article really helped me.\nI'm not sure if it's still that relevant though. I remember just setting my xCode to \"Don't code sign\" or something similar. I can't really check it right now, I'll get back to this. Make sure you have appsync installed on your iPhone though, that is a must.\nAfter that you might be able to run the app on the iPhone, but you won't be able to debug it live.\n", "Q: Can't save files in some applications I some application, such as Xcode, Pages and Pixelmator 2, when I save, I get an error about not having the permissions to save the file:\n\"The document “[document name]” could not be saved. You don’t have permission. To view or change permissions, select the item in the Finder and choose File > Get Info.\"\nThere's nothing wrong with the permissions. I can edit and save the same files from other applications, such as Textmate, Text Edit and Preview, without problems. I can also create a new project in Xcode, and it generates all the files without problem, but I still get the error message when trying to save any changes in these.\nI'm running Lion, clean installed.\nEdit: here's an example ls -l on some files I can't edit:\n-rw-r--r--  1 ulrikdamm  staff  4221 Nov  1 08:36 french.strings\n-rw-r--r--  1 ulrikdamm  staff  3755 Nov  1 10:53 german.strings\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 ulrikdamm  staff  4147 Oct 31 23:49 hungarian.strings\n\neven with full permissions, I can't save them.

Can it has something to do with some user settings being messed up?\n\nA: Since you haven't used ls -le as recommended, we don't know what the access control list looks like, but there might be something going on there that is preventing you from being able to write the files. The fact that a newly created user CAN edit the files makes me even more suspicious.\nThis command will remove ALL access control list entries from the folder and all its subfolders and files:\nsudo chmod -RN path/to/folder/containing/files\n\nOnce you've cleared the access control list, try resetting the ownership like so:\nsudo chown -R ulrikdamn:staff path/to/folder/containing/files\n\nNow grant permissions like so:\nsudo chmod -R u+rwX,g+rX,o+rX path/to/folder/containing/files\n\nThis gives you full read/write permissions. The \"staff\" group and all other users get full read permissions. Using an uppercase X, sets the execute bit for all directories within the tree, but leaves the execute bit for regular files as is. \nLowercase x would set the execute bit for all folders AND files. The execute bit must be set for a directory in order to read its contents. If you'd like to give write permissions to the group or others, switch out for g+rwX or o+rwX as necessary in the last command.\nHere I'm passing in a folder path. If you want to pass in a single file, just remove the -R from each command. The R makes the command recursive, applying it to an entire directory tree. Without it, the command will modify the permissions for a single file or folder passed in.\n\nA: It might be just an ownership issue with some of your files. To fix run\nsudo chown $USER:staff ~/\n\nin Terminal to change the ownership of all files and folders in your home folder to yourself.\n", "Q: Extreme MacBook Pro Slowdown/Freeze My MacBook Pro (2007) on Lion has a strange behaviour.\n\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes Chrome browser stops working.

At first I thought about my HDD but my S.M.A.R.T. Status is Verified. Any additional ideas are highly appreciated!\nUpdate :  Activity Monitor shows \n\nA: Try to retrace your steps. What have you installed on you Mac since the freezes started? Some suspicious software/freeware from the internet, maybe some illegal software... If you can think of something like this, try to uninstall/delete the software.  \nTry to detect which process is running (Activity monitor) when the freezes happened. If you detect the mall function service or software, try to figure out if the software is installed correctly.   \nWorst case scenario, you can back up your data (not software!!) via TimeMachine or just an external hard drive, and completely reïnstall you OS. It quite radical (and unnecessary if you ask me if you can figure out the bad software/process described in the above paragraphs). In this way, you have a completely new OS and you can restore your documents and reïnstall your software (be aware on what you install).\nMy advice, figure out your bad piece of software/process and fix it. So you can keep your documents without reïnstalling the whole Mac...\n\nA: \n@Michiel Got in his words first, albeit less step-by-step. If you find\n  the information helpful, please vote his answer before mine.\n\nIf you're experiencing issues across the system, and they don't correlate to one specific application, the first thing to do is replicate the problem, and observe the processes in your Activity Monitor. If you've never viewed this window, the default view by the Filter search will say My Processes. You'll want to set this to All Processes. If you sort by % CPU and don't see anything consuming a large amount of resources in the system, the causes may not pinpoint to one source.\nUltimately an issue that may have been present in the OS before you upgraded to Lion may have been exacerbated by the upgrade. I've seen it with plenty of customers.\nShould you fail to find any connection through Activity Monitor, you're best to reinstall Lion. By default it will Archive your data in the process, so you don't lose anything, but it's wise to back up just in case. Holding Command + R when starting up will get you to the Recovery Partition.\n", "Q: Adding templates to mail software in OSX Lion I have downloaded a couple of stationery templates for Apple's Mail application, but I don't know how to add them to the software so I can use them when composing messages. Anyone know how?\n\nA: These stationery files must follow strict Apple rules, meaning they have to be created in certain ways. If you bought them from Apple they will be fine, however, they should have told you where to place those files. \nHaving tried unsuccessfully to create my own, I at least learned where to  keep them. Here is the path where the files should be placed:\n(your) Hard Drive:Library:Application Support:Apple:Mail:Stationery:Apple:Contents:Resources:Photos:Contents:Resources:Air Mail.mailstationery\nAir Mail is just one of the Apple stationery packages.

Mac OS X is already loaded with Apple Spotlight, why use Alfred?\nWhat does Alfred bring to the table that Spotlight doesn't?\n\nA: You already have several answers on the web, like here or there.\nI personally use Alfred (+ optional powerpack) for a long time now and cannot live without it. It's (very) fast. I use it to obviously (and efficiently as drummin explained) launch applications, but also do simple calculations, search for files (and then take actions on thoses files, copy, email, open, ...), get definition from dictionary. I also command iTunes, added extensions for currency conversion, .dmg creation, etc...  \nCan you do all of this with Spotlight? I anyway kept Spotlight on Alt+Space but never used it again ;)\nI'm a keyboard guy and do a million things in seconds with Alfred. Clear productivity boost.\nPS: a 'spell personnaly' helped me write it correctly in my second sentence, english not being my native language, great help for me... ;)\n\nA: Alfred is not just an app launcher. It has:\n- Custom searches, which I found to be a \"must-have\" for app launchers these days.\n- Extensions (shell script, Apple Script, etc..).\n- Global Hotkey\n- iTunes controller\n- etc ...  \nAnd many other features. You better download the free core version and start using it.\nSpotlight isn't anywhere near it.\n\nA: One thing is speed. I believe Alfred is currently faster than Spotlight. And, this is specifically for Lion I believe, Alfred learns where Spotlight doesn't.\nIf I want to launch Adobe Photoshop and start to type 'Ph' Alfred will offer Photoshop as an option and move it to the top with the more I select it.\nWith Spotlight, Photo Booth with be the first choice, and it will not learn what I want with repeated use. I believe at one point it did, but lost the ability in Lion.\n\nA: Alfred and Launchbar are amazing tools that run all the time and provide further benefits and integrations with apps unlike spotlight.\nIf you only need to search for files and apps and you don't have specific reasons why the Apple provided spotlight is not meeting your needs, I'd be the contrarian here and say, don't add anything to your Mac that runs all the time and you don't have a good reason to add it.\nWhen you know what you need, have a look at the tools and try the one you feel is worth your time to take for a test drive.\n\nA: I have not switch. It seems like spotlight is working fine for me. I store doc on my computer and spotlight pulls them up. While it would be nice for spotlight to, search the web like alfred?, it does not mean that i need an entire app for that purpose. plus, most of the greatest things about alfred requires Plus or about five or ten bucks for it.

But, it isn't the first time.  Some of these are applications that I use daily.  \nI seem to be getting more of these after an OS upgrade, almost as if some database got reset.  Can I do something to get these warnings to be generated properly?\n\nA: This warning pops up every time an application wants to register a URI handler (a something:// protocol). Normally, your approval is saved by LaunchServices, but that database can become corrupted. Try resetting it by doing a\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -all local,system,user\n\nin Terminal. The warnings should pop up once for each application again after that, then be gone for good. If they keep coming, something is resetting the database on its own (a clue would be that the default browser / mail app / RSS app / FTP app you set keep resetting to the Apple provided ones).\n\nA: I had the same problem (only with SourceTree, after an update), and seeing @kopischke's answer reminded me of another Ask Different thread, on another LaunchServices database problem:\nWhy does my Mac's list of \"Open with\" applications start listing the apps twice and sometimes three times?\nThe LaunchServices reset command provided there is slightly different from the one @kopischke provided:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n\nI tried that, and it solved my \"Opening application for the first time\" problem. But it did not require me to re-okay every other application as well (only a few; I didn't see an obvious pattern in which). So it may be worth trying this before trying the earlier suggestion.\n", "Q: Is there any way for me to use the original Mac Plus or Mac 128k mouse with a modern Macbook Pro? I gather the original Macs used a serial port for the mouse with a RS-422 DE-9 connector. Totally nonstandard today. But surely, at some point some company (Apple?) must have made an adapter to use the early mice with USB-based Macs?\nThanks for any info...\n\nA: As far as I know, the old mac mice used a DE-9 connector, but this isn't RS-232-compatible. If it was, you could have used an adaptor from RS-232 to PS/2 and then a standard ps/2-usb-converter (both must be active converters).\nIf you get an ADB-mouse you will be able to use them as there are adaptors for these.\nIf you're into electronics and programming, you could build your own converter eg. using a teensy-board for few bucks. It shouldn't be too hard as the old apple mouse just sends quadrature signals which should easily be translated into pointer movements.\n\nA: Ancient thread - but I was searching for the same thought\nIt's possible to use an arduino/teensy with HID capability to covert the quadrature to be used on a USB device.\nThe DE9 pinout (with arduino pins for code below) is:\nDB9     Pro Micro\n    1       GND\n    2       VCC\n    3       GND\n    4       D0      (pin 3)\n    5       D1      (pin 2)\n    6       -       (not connected)\n    7       B3      (pin 14)\n    8       D3      (pin TXO)\n    9       D2      (pin RXI)\n\nAnd some sample code originally from GuilleAcoustic and modified by Johan Berglund:\n/* ================================================================================\n   Author  : GuilleAcoustic\n   Date    : 2015-05-22\n   Revision: V1.0\n   Purpose : Opto-mechanical trackball firmware\n   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Wiring informations: Sparkfun Pro micro (Atmega32u4)\n   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     - Red    : Gnd                          |   Pin: Gnd\n     - Orange : Vcc (+5V)                    |   Pin: Vcc\n     - Yellow : X axis encoder / channel A   |   Pin: PD3 - (INT0)\n     - Green  : X axis encoder / channel B   |   Pin: PD2 - (INT1)\n     - Blue   : Y axis encoder / channel A   |   Pin: PD0 - (INT2)\n     - Violet : Y axis encoder / channel B   |   Pin: PD1 - (INT3)\n     - Grey   : Switch 1                     |   Pin: PB3\n     - White  : Switch 2                     |   Pin: PB2\n     - Black  : Switch 3                     |   Pin: PB1\n\n   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Modified for use with Apple M0100 mouse\n   By Johan Berglund, 2015-08-10\n\n   Changes in code:\n   - Internal pullup set for pin 14 (B3)\n   - State check for right and middle buttons commented out\n\n   Connection to DB9:\n\n   DB9     Pro Micro\n    1       GND\n    2       VCC\n    3       GND\n    4       D0      (pin 3)\n    5       D1      (pin 2)\n    6       -       (not connected)\n    7       B3      (pin 14)\n    8       D3      (pin TXO)\n    9       D2      (pin RXI)\n\n   ================================================================================ */\n\n// =================================================================================\n// Type definition\n// =================================================================================\ntypedef struct\n{\n  int8_t  coordinate = 0;\n  uint8_t index      = 0;\n} ENCODER_;\n\n// =================================================================================\n// Constant definition\n// =================================================================================\nconst int8_t lookupTable[] = {0, 1, -1, 0, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, -1, 0, -1,  1,  0};\n\n// =================================================================================\n// Volatile variables\n// =================================================================================\nvolatile ENCODER_ xAxis;\nvolatile ENCODER_ yAxis;\n\n// =================================================================================\n// Setup function\n// =================================================================================\nvoid setup()\n{\n\n  // Set pull-up for mouse switch on M0100\n  pinMode(14, INPUT_PULLUP);\n\n  // Attach interruption to encoders channels\n  attachInterrupt(0, ISR_HANDLER_X, CHANGE);\n  attachInterrupt(1, ISR_HANDLER_X, CHANGE);\n  attachInterrupt(2, ISR_HANDLER_Y, CHANGE);\n  attachInterrupt(3, ISR_HANDLER_Y, CHANGE);\n\n  // Start the mouse function\n  Mouse.begin();\n}\n\n// =================================================================================\n// Main program loop\n// =================================================================================\nvoid loop()\n{\n  // Update mouse coordinates\n  if (xAxis.coordinate != 0 || yAxis.coordinate != 0)\n  {\n    Mouse.move(xAxis.coordinate, yAxis.coordinate);\n    xAxis.coordinate = 0;\n    yAxis.coordinate = 0;\n  }\n\n  // Update buttons state\n  !(PINB & 0b1000) ?

When the process was over, she was missing her apps.  I reinstalled these from the App Store via the Purchased section.  However, she was missing data from her apps.  At the time, it didn't seem like a big deal, because her emails were still on the server.  Over the past few weeks, however, it has become more of a pain, from the trivial (lost Angry Bird levels) to the more major (lost appointments).  \nSo, if I was to connect the iPhone up to the computer from which iOS 5 was installed, I'm thinking I could restore the data.  However, I'm afraid that if I did so it would erase any data accumulated over the past 3 weeks.  \nSo I have two questions\na)  If I restore data on the iPhone from a few weeks ago, will it indeed erase data that has been accumulated since then?  Is there a way to merge data?\nb)  Is there a way to restore data for only particular apps?\nThe end goal is to somehow retrieve all the data from before the iOS 5 updateand the data since the update.\n\nA: The sad and short answer is No.\n\n\n*\n\n*Restoring to an old backup will erase any data accumulated on the phone in the meantime. There is no way to merge backups or such.\n\n*App-specific restores are possible for apps which offer some sort of cloud support. So if she is syncing her contacts with iCloud or Google they should still be here after the restore.\n\n\n\nHowever, the long answer is maybe.\nFirst, make a list of the programs where you do want to attempt to merge or replace her data. You will need to rename the current device so the backup is saved, then restore the device to get at the old data. At that point you can extract the \"old\" data to a computer. Then you would restore the \"new\" backup and merge the data back for each case where you could get it onto a computer.\nYou can see how this is tedious, prone to error, and requires you to learn the specifics of each app where you want to get your data. All great things to know, but you have to balance it against the time it would take you to simple re-create the data in the first place.\nThis also serves as the perfect use case for iCloud backup. In this case, you would never have not restored the backup since the cloud is so much more accessible than a computer and a USB cable.\n\n\n*\n\n*Angry Birds used to store the game settings in a file that you can use a utility like PhoneView to read onto the computer.\n\n\nI would say - once you have a list of the apps you want to \"pick\" - come back and ask that single question - how can I access the saved game levels for game X and people here will step up if it's an easy google search or they know how to get that one file off the device.\n", "Q: Operations: how to filter text messages on iPhone Question for operations people. I work at a place that believes in configuring Nagios to send SMS alerts on all priorities of issues - even non-urgent ones that I don't need to wake me up in the middle of the night.\nIs there a way on my iPhone to filter these texts based on words in the body or subject? I've got an iPhone 3GS, I think it's running iOS 4.x something but I can upgrade to iOS 5 if needed.\n\nA: You could send the SMSes through an online service like Google Voice that might be able to do content filtering (or at least would forward certain ones to email to filter).\n\nA: Unless disabled, the iOS Spotlight search and the in-app Messages search can find terms you might otherwise filter. Automating this in any way is strictly reliant on jailbreaking  the unit for a 3rd-party offering (of which I'm not aware).\n\nA: You can use GroupMe as a proxy Text service and set notifications to mute for that contact. That way you can take a look at the conversation if you want to, but don't get disturbed by it.\n\nA: There's no way to do this in iOS unless you can have the messages sent from different addresses.  Then you could put the phone in Do Not Disturb mode, but allow the email address of the urgent contact to pass through by putting them in Favorites. \nAlternatively, you could send the notifications to an email address and use IFTTT or email filters to forward those with, for example, \"urgent\" in the subject to your cell phone's email address.  \n", "Q: How do I split a Bootcamp Partition on a second drive? I have a Mac Mini Server 2011, which has 2 Hard disks of 750GB  each.\nI want to install Windows 7 on the second disk, but i want to split this disk on two partitions: One of 450 GB for Windows and one of 300 GB with exFat to share data between Windows and OS X (is Lion by the way). \nI tried with the Bootcamp assistant, but it took for the Bootcamp partition the whole disk, and so I installed that way, but I prefer to have both partitions as I mentioned above.\nCan I split it the way I want? I don't mind if I have to reinstall Windows as long as I have the best compatible solution for this.\n\nA: Open Disk Utility and format second HDD with Partition Map Scheme to be Master Boot Record.\nThen start up from Windows Install Disk by pressing Alt or C and create partitions from there.\nYou should probably use Bootcamp Assistant before (or after) just to save Windows drivers and Bootcamp taskbar utility to the flash disk or elsewhere.\n\nA: Should work without problems, but didn't try: Open Disk Utility. Create two partitions, an exFAT-partition and a mac-partition. Then, start bootcamp assistant and use the mac partition to install windows.\n", "Q: Why does the App Store think Xcode 4.2 is installed? I'm trying to upgrade Xcode from 4.1 to 4.2. \nHowever App Store thinks that it's already up to date, which it is not.\n\n\nI am a registered Mac and iOS developer. I don't think 4.2 is under NDA. \nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Delete the XCode installer in /Applications, restart App Store. Now you will have an \"Install\" button for XCode. Download the installer and run it.\n\nA: Actually, chances are the installer is for Xcode 4.2. The App Store is a bit misleading, since it doesn't actually install Xcode, but downloads the installer and puts it in /Applications/Install Xcode.app. You still need to run the installer. The App Store knows nothing about if you've done that or not.\n", "Q: Does the MacBook Air draw power from the battery or wall socket when the battery is at 100% and plugged in? I have a MacBook Air 13\" (late 2010 model). I use it both as a portable computer (i.e. not plugged in, drawing power from the battery) and as a desktop (i.e. plugged into the wall socket) regularly. I'm wondering what's happening when I use it in the latter situation.\nFrom what I learned at Battery University, I know that you should minimize battery usage because the more charge cycles a batter has, the less charge it will be able to hold. In other words, when I use it in \"desktop mode\", I would ideally take out the battery and only use the wall socket as a power source. However, this is not an option on the MacBook Air.\nSo my question is if the battery is at 100%, the laptop is plugged into a wall outlet, and I'm using the laptop, where is the laptop drawing its power from? Which of the following scenarios is happening?\n\n\n*\n\n*Wall Outlet -> Laptop\n\n*Wall Outlet -> Battery -> Laptop\n\n*Wall Outlet + Battery -> Laptop\n\n\nIf it's #1, that means I don't need to worry about keeping the laptop plugged in all the time.\nI'm looking for empirical evidence of what's happening, rather than speculation made by individual observations. Here's an example of an answer I'm not looking for:\n\nI notice that the battery icon stays at 100% when my laptop is plugged in, therefore it must mean that the power outlet is the one supplying power.\n\nWho said that? Where's the evidence that that's what's really happening? What if Apple is purposely hiding the fact that the battery is being drained a bit and then refilled? What if the power is going from 100% down to 99.6%, then back up to 100% constantly? Although it may seem like this wouldn't affect battery life as much as going from 100% down to 60%, the nature of Lithium ion batteries makes it so that 100 of these mini cycles is almost exactly like the one larger cycle.\nAlso, does heavy usage of the laptop affect where it draws its power from? For example, say I'm running a CPU intensive game (e.g. near 100% CPU usage), would it be able to draw all the power it needs from the wall outlet, or does it go into the battery reserves?\n\nA: Don't worry. It will use the wall outlet if that offers enough power which it should using the original AC adaptor.\n\nWhat if the power is going from 100% down to 99.6%, then back up to 100% constantly?\n\nThat was until about a decade ago or so. Modern laptops even don't charge your battery if it is eg. at 98% for reducing unnecessary cycles. Don't bother about your battery in your computer.\nIf you want to care for your battery, just remember every cycle shortens battery life, no matter if 10 minutes on battery or completely emptied it. The battery has also some natural aging, so it will die after some years even if you never touch it.\n\nA: According to Apple's Website and I quote \"Apple does not recommend leaving your portable plugged in all the time.\"\nThat means your initial assumption \"If it's #1, that means I don't need to worry about keeping the laptop plugged in all the time\" is incorrect. \nHave a read more on that website on how to look after and maintain a battery which they manufacture on your MacBook Air.\n\nA: I don't have an answer for you (and you should probably accept Ranon's answer, since your comment to that makes it seem like that's the answer you wanted).  I do, however, have a test you can do to determine the answer for yourself:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Check the cycle count.  \n\n*Leave it plugged in for several days straight (weeks would be better).\n\n*Check the cycle count again.\n\n\nIf the cycle count hasn't changed, then it's not draining the battery at all.\n", "Q: How do I view the list of podcast chapters on an iPad using iOS 5? I subscribe to Tiesto's Club Life Podcast, and the episodes are released as very superbly crafted AAC files. Aside from containing audio data, they also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Define Podcast \"Chapters\" marked at the start/end of each song.\n\n*Define custom artwork per chapter.\n\n*Name chapters appropriately by attributing artist/title (and often remixer) of the particular track.\n\n\nAs of iOS 5, none of this appears to work. During playback art never changes, and there is no indication of the chapter information (making it hard to look up the song after the fact).\nHas this information disappeared from being easily accessed? Or has it just been moved somewhere that isn't obvious for me to find?\n\nA: There really doesn't seem to be a way to view this info at all on iOS 5 iPads, in Apple's \"Music\" app. \nFurther iPad iOS 5 podcast annoyances:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the main \"Music\" you listen to is podcasts, it's really annoying that you can no longer promote the \"Podcasts\" button from \"More\" to the main view: so you always have to go to \"More\" to see your podcasts.\n\n*If you have a mixture of video and audio podcasts, you have to switch between the \"Videos\" and \"Music\" apps to see them.\n\n\nFor all these reasons, I gave up on the built-in iOS 5 podcast tools, and switched to Podcaster. It costs a small amount of money, but has so many convenience features built in that it's well worth it.\n(It's actually iPhone only - but works fine on iPad, at 2x size, even for showing videos)\nI particularly like:\n\n\n*\n\n*It downloads the latest episode of shows you subscribe to, but seamlessly shows you earlier ones too, so you can easily stream them\n\n*Automatic downloading via WiFi - so no more need to connect my device to a PC to update lots of podcasts\n\n*Back and forward buttons to go move 30 seconds back or forwards - or you can change the settings, and make these buttons go back/forward 10, then 20 then 30 seconds if clicked in quick succession.\n\n*Small icon at top-right of screen shows/hide details of podcasts.\n\n*Sleep facility (15, 30, 45, 60, 90 minutes)\n\n\n(I'd like to include a link to the original question here where I saw Podcaster first mentioned, but there are so many answers singing its praises, I really don't remember which one I saw.)\nEdit\nAnd to answer your question about Tiesto's Club Life Podcast, yes, Podcaster displays that well. It shows the images as you listen, and at bottom-right of the screen there's a little chapters icon that shows name of each chapter, and its position (in minutes and seconds)\nFurthermore, you can swipe upwards on the screen, when playing, to show the chapters.\n", "Q: Solving a problem on a MacBook Pro 5,1 with an OCZ Agility 3 SSD I installed Mac OS X lion on an SSD (through USB) after checking the firmware was the latest version (2.15).

I plugged an external drive into Time Capsule using the USB input on the back.\nThen I used Finder to move data from the Time Capsule's drive to the USB drive.\nFinder says it'll take over 24 hours to move that data.\nThere must be a faster way. Do you know how I can do that?\n\nA: If you want an exact copy of the TC drive, the fastest way is to connect the USB drive directly to the TC and use the archiving option in Airport Utility:\n\nOther things to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*Transfering data over wire (ethernet) is faster than over Wi-Fi\n\n*Connecting the USB drive directly to the computer (than to the TC) gives better results if you use the Finder to copy data.\n\n\nA: I can't say for sure (so someone can correct me if AFP (which I assume is being used) works differently) but a common problem with Windows network transfers from one remote device to another is it will pull the file TO the computer you use to initiate the transfer, then move it to the destination, which is much slower than a direct transfer.\nIf Time Capsule has a function in its interface for transferring files to a connected drive (or can be connected to via ssh to do the same), that will probably be a better solution than initiating the transfer via Finder.\n\nA: If you are not going to take apart Time Capsule then connect USB drive to your Mac and connect your Mac to TM by wire if possible. That would be the fastest way to copy.\n", "Q: My headphone set doesn't play any sound After plugging in my headphone into my iphone 4s no sound comes through.

Also try using other headphones in the iPhone.\n\nA: Maybe you are not pushing it in all the way.  I thought mine were defective until I pushed harder than I thought I should.\nIf you have any kind of phone protector make sure the jack hole opening is not not obstructed by the cover! You might have to stretch the cover hole a little to push headphone jack all the way in! That was my problem it works fine when in all the way.\n", "Q: Automatically Load LaunchDaemon? I wrote a little script to automatically update my Network Location based on a couple of conditions, and have coupled that with a launchd plist to have it run every couple of minutes.\nHowever, I've noticed that my launchd plist doesn't seem to get loaded when my computer reboots.  My plist is in ~/Library/LaunchDaemons and is fairly simple:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.davedelong.location-updater</string>\n    <key>Program</key>\n    <string>/path/to/my/location_updater.rb</string>\n    <key>StartInterval</key>\n    <integer>180</integer>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nMy LaunchDaemons folder has the expected 700 permissions, and running launchctl load with my plist makes things work just fine.  It's just that when I reboot, it's not getting loaded.\nI was under the impression that everything in ~/Library/LaunchDaemons and ~/Library/LaunchAgents got loaded automatically by launchd.  Is this not the case?  If this is the case (and I think it is), then why isn't my plist getting loaded?\n\nA: ~/Library/LaunchDaemons isn't a valid location for either launch agents or launch daemons. You are misunderstanding the terminology. LaunchDaemons are system-wide processes, while LaunchAgents are run per-user. From the launchd man page:\n~/Library/LaunchAgents         Per-user agents provided by the user.\n/Library/LaunchAgents          Per-user agents provided by the administrator.\n/Library/LaunchDaemons         System-wide daemons provided by the administrator.\n/System/Library/LaunchAgents   Per-user agents provided by Mac OS X.\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons  System-wide daemons provided by Mac OS X.\n\nMove your plist to ~/Library/LaunchAgents, and it should just work. \n", "Q: What is the quality of SSDs included on a Mac? Are the SSDs used by Apple high in quality in terms of Speed and longevity (which is a particular issue with SSD). If not would you recommend buying a separate SSD and installing it after purchasing a mac?\n\nA: Apple uses a mix of Toshiba and Samsung SSDs in the current lineup of Macs (pre-2011 they used Toshiba only). Neither are the fastest drives around, but they're still pretty speedy, and in most day-to-day cases you wouldn't notice the difference between a Toshiba or Samsung and the fastest Sandforce, Intel or Crucial/Micron drive. The reason for this is that almost all SSDs are so much faster than a traditional hard drive that the relative difference in SSDs is fairly small.\nThe Toshiba and Samsung drives are both respectable performers but trade that extra x% that differentiates the top performers for better reliability. From Apple's perspective it's a pretty smart trade, as the perceived performance in 95% of cases is still great, and the long term customer satisfaction is more important. For more specifics see the SSD section of Anandtech's 2011 MacBook Air review.\nAs to whether you should get a 3rd party drive or an Apple one, here's my advice:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you know you need the best possible sequential read/write performance for a specific purpose, get a 3rd party drive. If you're not certain you need the extra performance, you probably don't.\n\n*If you're going to be getting a small drive (~128 GB or so), go with the Apple one. In a MBP you can get a 128 GB drive for $200, which is pretty competitive with prices at NewEgg, etc.\n\n*If you're want a bigger drive, you can generally save yourself ~$150-200 by going with a 3rd party 256 GB drive, but if that money matters less to you than reliability (and the reduced hassle of having Apple warranty cover the drive), get the Apple one.\n\nA: I dont know the exact drives Apple uses, but I would say that when buying an SSD, its good to take a look at what Jeff Atwood had to say on the hot/crazy scale: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/05/the-hot-crazy-solid-state-drive-scale.html\n\nAs an early advocate of solid state hard drives …\nThe State of Solid State Hard Drives (October 2009)\nRevisiting Solid State Hard Drives (October 2010) \n\n… I feel ethically and morally obligated to let you in on a dirty\n  little secret I've discovered in the last two years of full time SSD\n  ownership. Solid state hard drives fail. A lot. And not just any fail.\n  I'm talking about catastrophic,\n  oh-my-God-what-just-happened-to-all-my-data instant gigafail. It's not\n  pretty.\nThing is, SSDs are so scorching hot that I'm willing to put up with\n  their craziness. Consider that just in the last two years, their\n  performance has doubled. Doubled! And the latest, fastest SSDs can\n  even saturate existing SATA interfaces; they need brand new 6 Gbps\n  interfaces to fully strut their stuff. No CPU or memory upgrade can\n  come close to touching that kind of real world performance increase.\n\n\nA: I've a MacBook Pro and I've updated the disk to a OCZ Velocity 3.\nPro: faster and cheaper than the Apple SSD disk, insanely fast compared to the original disk\nCons: installation is always a problem (one of the screws that keep the bottom lid closed not do not fit properly and it's a little \"outside\", I've tried to refit it more and more times but nothing changed), sometimes computer freezes and it seems it could be a problem in the SSD firmware, support of SSD functionalities from OSX Lion needs to be tuned by hand.\nSo the speed of the SSD it's in the \"insanely fast\" range described by Jeff Atwood (and every time I boot the notebook I use at work with a regular disk I want to cry because of its slow 7200 rpm disk!) and I will never buy another notebook without SSD disk.\nIf I have a MacBook to update then I do not know, I'm quite happy with the upgrade (having done it myself) but maybe having the replacement done with Apple parts in a Apple store could be a good idea (if they do it, I don't know).\nConsider also that almost all SSD drives on the market are designed and supported mainly on Windows, OSX and Macs are often not considered (i.e.: to update the firmware of my OCZ drive no OSX tool is available, I need to boot using Windows or a Linux live CD).\nRegards\nMassimo\n\nA: I upgraded an older MacBook Pro with an OWC SSD a year ago and it was an incredible upgrade:\nhttp://www.richardsnotes.org/archives/2010/12/10/macbook-pro-ssd-upgrade/\nWhen I bought a new MacBook Pro I decided to fork over some serious money and buy Apple's SSD as a stock item rather than do the upgrade myself because the price of the SSD from Apple and the one from OWC is about the same.\nhttp://www.richardsnotes.org/archives/2011/03/23/new-macbook-pro-with-ssd/\nThese MacBook Pros are my only computers and they get a lot of use, in all types of situations and I can honestly say that not only have I had no problems with either SSD (OWC or Apple) but the move from HD to SSD is the best speed boost for a computer you can make. it's incredible.\nI routinely buy AppleCare for my computers and if this Apple SSD fails or slows down they'll replace it in a flash (so to speak). I also back up daily with both SuperDuper! and Time Machine so failure of my main drive isn't as much of a worry as it might be for some.\nI think there's been a lot written about SSDs that scares people but I've experienced none of it and I won't buy a MacBook Pro without an internal SSD, the quiet, the lack of vibration, the almost immediate boot time, launching and quitting applications very fast and more is incredible.\nSolid state is the way to go for at least the system and your main applications if not your entire computer.\n", "Q: How to enable OS X screen sharing (VNC) through SSH?

Is there software for Mac OS X that allows me to watch them while downloading?\n\nA: Yes. There are three requirements:\n\n*\n\n*A video player software that doesn't mind about incomplete video files\n\n*A torrent client that lets you choose the order in which the pieces are downloaded\n\n*A fast–enough broadband connection\n\n# 3 is trivial. Although you could cope with slower connection, if you download enough buffer for playback.\n# 1 is somewhat trivial. VLC can start the playback of a file if the file's headers are downloaded (first pieces of the file). Seeking is a bit limited and I don't remember correctly if VLC stops when encountering a (too long) gaps in video. On Windows I've used GOM Player, which was more laid-back with missing frames.\n# 2 is counter-intuitive. While many clients allow you to prioritise the files, prioritising pieces is less common. This is simply because torrents are designed to transfer big sets of data fast. A large reason why torrents are faster or more efficient than an ordered transfer of a file is due to the fact that torrents pick the easy fruits - whatever parts of the file are available from the least loaded / closest source are what get downloaded first. Statistically, you should expect to be missing key parts of the beginning of the video until the transfer is almost complete.\nThe speed is achieved by initially splitting the file(s) to pieces, sending the pieces to the clients in the network and then all the clients will share and merge the different pieces. The operation is best described with an animation found in BitTorrent's Wikipedia article.\nUnfortunately I can't recommend any torrent clients that give you the option to prioritise the pieces—if there even are any—as I've never really had the need.\nAlso note that BitTorrent isn't exactly designed for playback while downloading (QED), but for just sharing data. You might get better luck with on–demand video rental services available in your area, which usually use software and protocols specifically designed for HD-playback over the net.\nSadly that leaves out lots of great indie content. Maybe the best way to deal with the issue is to gain patience or plan more ahead :-)\n\nA: http://www.qbittorrent.org at least can download sequentially\n\nA: *\n\n*We need a torrent client that can download the movie file parts in order, not randomly.\n\n*We need a player that supports playing incomplete files.\n\n*We need a connection that is faster than the movie’s bitrate (and a torrent with enough peers obviously).\n\n\nThe torrent client\nPreviously I used BitThief. It is developed by a technology institute in Zurich. It didn’t have a polished GUI and took a little bit too much CPU while downloading.\nThere's new client I found thanks to @diimdeep. It is called qbittorrent and it is awesome.\n\nYou can see that while downloading it downloads as a normal torrent client – the parts are downloaded randomly:\n\nBut there is an option:\n\nAfter that we can see that the rest of the file is being downloaded sequentially (blue – downloaded, green – requested):\n\nThe connection speed\nHow can we tell if the speed is good enough?

On Linux there is a layout called US International (AltGr dead keys), which converts the right Alt key into an AltGr key. AltGr+a gives á, AltGr-Shift-a gives Á, AltGr-m gives µ, and AltGr-' followed by another key puts the acute accent on whatever you type next, and so on.\nThis is pretty much my favorite keyboard layout, because it's really convenient both for programming and for typing foreign-language text (both of which I do quite a bit) but unfortunately I can't find an option for this layout. The \"US International - PC\" layout uses ', \", and ` and so on as dead keys directly, which doesn't work because as mentioned I program a lot.\nI found a layout called \"US International w/o Dead Keys\" here, but when I load it into Lion the keyboard simply stops working.

How can I use my SIM?\n\nA: Depending on your carrier, some SIM batches are known to be problematic (Bell is a good example). Outside of that, the most obvious is if the iPhone was jailbroken and unlocked, the restore would remove the modification and return it to proper function. If everything should be working legitimately, you can take it to an Apple Store and they can look up which carrier the unit is locked to (if any).\n\nA: Reboot!\nI had that problem once.

Or any way to take my passcode off besides resetting it on my computer. That option is not possible right now. \nThanks. \n\nA: No. There is no way to bypass the passcode lock on iOS. Either you remember the code/get it from your friend, or you have to restore the iPhone.\n\nA: You'd have to restore the phone using iTunes on a Mac or PC\nTo do that, turn off your phone, than plug your phone in (to the computer) while keeping the home button pressed until an iTunes symbol appears on the iPhone's screen. iTunes should \"detect a phone in restore mode\" and you'll be able to reset your phone. \nApple Article on the topic: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1212?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\nA: If you have a back up from before it was changed you can do a DFU restore then restore back to what it was like before\n", "Q: New restored iPhone getting \"iTunes couldnt not back up the iPhone because the backup session failed\" I looked everywhere and I can't solve this.\nI looked at Error trying to backup both iPhone4 and iPad (1) after 4.3/iTunes/XCode updates and didn't solve my problem\nEDIT: I have a used phone (1st gen) that I restored using the restore feature in iTunes. I close iTunes and start again and I get this error.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: I'm working through the same issue and it seems to have something to do with the sim card. Is your sim card valid? meaning do you plan to actually activate it for voice and data and use it as a real phone? In my case, I already transferred the number to my iPhone 4 and just want to give it to my kids to use as if it were an iPod touch. So I took it to the mac store and the genius had a few suggestions but didn't help very much, He suggested using iTunes 9.x which you can still download.  I tried that on an old mac I had but it didn't help.  He even suggested jail breaking it which I'm technically capable of doing, but from what I've read I think it has to first be functioning and connect with iTunes before it can be broken so it's a chicken and egg thing.  So here is what I think is happening, (no solution yet though). When the first iPhone was originally released, you used to have to take it home and hook it up to iTunes to activate it.  They didn't do anything for it in the store or activate it on the spot. So your phone is currently in the same state after the restore. It's trying to go through the setup process, but the number registered on the sim card is already disabled or somehow marked as invalid and some kind of unexpected error occurs that prevents it from continuing with the setup process.  \nNow here is an interesting thing...  even though I couldn't restore it, I offered to loan it to a friend 2 months ago who lost his iPhone. He just wanted something to use while he waited for the 4S to be released.  He went to the ATT store and told him he lost his original iphone and wanted to use my first-gen instead. They didn't even look at the phone, but they gave him a valid sim card to take home. He was able to do the setup process at home and use it just fine. So I suspect something about having a proper sim that is willing to be activated with a real account helped him get running.  However one other difference is that he is using iTunes on windows, I'm all mac... (Tried this on 3 different machines so far.. powerbook running snow leopard, and an iMac running lion, both with the latest iTunes, And finally mac mini running iTunes 9.2.x).  \nUpdate: I had a bootcamp partition running XP. Used it to download iTunes 9.x for Windows.  Still encountered similar errors. (Sorry, don't have exact code).  I still plan to try simcard replacement to activate old phone with current account.\n", "Q: Will upgrading my 2007 mac-mini from Tiger to Snow Leopard be a performance upgrade?

More specifically, it's very advisable to upgrade from Tiger to Leopard (10.5) at the very least. This will ensure that you can use newer software and hardware that is on the market these days.\nPersonally, I didn't notice massive performance increases between Leopard and Snow Leopard, but on paper it is designed to better take advantage of the hardware in your Mac Mini. You'll also see alot of new features that have been incorporated into 10.5 and 10.6 since Tiger.\nYou'll have to source a copy from eBay or something as now Apple only sell OS X Lion (10.7) through the App Store.\n", "Q: Should I get a SATA 3Gb/s or 6Gb/s hard drive for my MBP? If I am planning to upgrade my Macbook Pro 13\" (Late 2011) with a 7200RPM Hard drive, should I get a SATA 3Gb/s or SATA 6Gb/s drive?\n\nA: As a conventional hard drive wouldn't come close to 3GB/s, I say save some money and go for the cheaper 3GB/s one. If you have money to splash then instead I suggest you go for a SSD, because that would really lift your MBP's performance. It doesn't have to be as large and your current drive, because you can use your current drive as a external one by getting a SATA to USB casing somewhere to take some of the load off.\n\nA: Short answer: it doesn't matter.\nLonger version: Either will work fine. SATA is backwards compatible, so SATA 6Gb/s drives will work on SATA 3Gb/s interfaces and vice-versa. The 2011 Macbook Pros have 6Gb/s ports for the HD (some in the optical bay as well). However, no mechanical hard drive can come close to maxing out SATA 3Gb/s speed, so you'll see no difference from a 6Gb/s drive or interface. It makes a difference with SSDs, but with hard drives, it's merely marketing.\n\nA: Another option, if you don't really need the optical drive is to get an adapter and put a  big conventional drive in the optical bay (via an adapter such as from OWC) and then put a 6Gb/s SSD drive in as your boot drive. Super fast, and very useful. I'm finding optical drives to be less important than they used to be unless you're a gamer.\n", "Q: Is it possible to get the iPad to play videos in the common formats? I was looking for an easy to use device for my mum, who wants to occasionally grab movies to watch on the go. I didn't do my homework properly and just bought an iPad because it seems to be a synonym for \"easy to use\".\nUntil I found out that to watch movies using the built-in player, they have to be transcoded.\nWhat would you recommend to make it easy for my mum to grab a movie from her computer and watch it on the iPad? Is there an app that would just play any format without transcoding? If not, what's the easiest way out? She's got a pretty slow PC; definitely not something I'd want to do video transcoding on.\nP.S. I'm still wondering if I got this wrong, because it's a bit hard to believe. This is anything but easy-to-use at the moment :(  Am I totally misunderstanding something?\n\nA: I use VLC Player for iPhone, but it was removed from the App Store due to an incompatibility between its open source license and the App Store terms.\nI learned that AVPlayer does the same, but it is a payed app. Pretty inexpensive, tough.\n\nA: As lpacheco said, VLC works, but it was removed. I personally think VLC has the better UI of the two and thus easier to use, and since its for your mom, the more preferable app. One way to get it is to jailbreak the iPad (when the iOS 5 untethered jailbreak comes out), and install VLC for iPac via appsync/installous. After that, you add the video file to VLC through \"File Sharing\" under the apps tab of the iPad sync page.  \n\nA: VLC would have been your best bet, if you got a hold of it before it got removed from the App Store.\nI'd say your next best option is Air Video - it comes in two parts: a server component that you install on a Mac or Windows box, and the client app you download to your iPad. It'll let you stream videos from the machine to your iPad (thereby reducing file transfer times), but even better, with transcode it on-the-fly if it's a non-native iPad format.\nI know you say her computer is slow, but how slow? Air Video will scale down the res if the server can't handle it, so it shouldn't choke trying to live transcode a 1080p MKV on a P4.\n", "Q: Do network operations complete if you tap the lock button? If an iPhone app is in the middle of a network operation (e.g., downloading email in Mail,  loading a web page in Safari, posting a photo in Path, upgrading apps via the App store) and I tap the lock button to blank the screen, will the network operation complete? Or will it suspend the operation and only resume it when I tap the lock button again?\nMore generally, what happens to a running app when I tap the lock button? \n\nA: The button on top is not a power button.  It's a lock button which informs the OS to turn off the display to save power and to prevent accidental touch input, but the rest of the device keeps running.  Apps continue to run for a short while after the display and touchscreen is powered off, from a few seconds for most apps, to several minutes, and even longer for a few specific types of apps, such as background music players and VOIP apps under iOS 4 and newer.  Some GPS logging apps can also continue to run in the background as well.\nSome newer networking apps request a few minute to complete operations in the background, but not all older apps could or did.  So it depends on the iOS version, the particular app and version of that app.\n\nA: Generally applications used to keep running normally even if you locked the screen. There were some exceptions, Safari I believe stopped its network operations, as did some others, but most apps would just ignore it.\nSince iOS 5 however, applications get suspended (just as if you hit the home button) when the screen locks, which means outside of a 10 minutes grace period (if the apps actively supports it) applications can't do anything under the lock screen.\n", "Q: Is there a way to setup Yahoo mail for push with iOS5? It seems to check it on a schedule, regardless of what I do.\nI've tried setting it up to masquerade as Exchange, but was not successful.\n\nA: Yes Yahoo mail supports push, but failing sometimes. This is how to enable it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to \"Settings->Mail, Contacts, Calendars\"\n\n*Tap \"Fetch New Data\"\n\n*Slide \"Push\" to ON (you can select Fetch period whatever you like)\n\n*Also from \"Fetch New Data\" page, tap \"Advanced\" and see that Yahoo! mail account has Push text on the right\n\n\nIt is easy to do, but sometimes Yahoo push just doesn't work.\n", "Q: How can an old Apple ID be merged into the newer ID? When I first creed an Apple account, years ago, I used a password which I've been using ever since. Later I joined Me.com and I was assigned an email address that also became another Apple ID for me. More recently, with the new iCloud it looks like only my email address will be accepted as the ID t... So, how do I merge my now \"old\" ID into my newer @me.com address? Thanks.\n\nA: As of now, you cannot merge multiple Apple IDs into one Apple ID. It has been rumored but it is not possible at the moment.\n\nA: Apple still working on it. I know about it from last news.\nhttp://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/18/apple-still-working-on-allowing-merging-of-apple-ids/\n\nA: Here's an idea.  What you can do, if you haven't bought much or anything on your new ID.  You can change the email address on your apple ID once every 90 days (which is important, make sure you do this right the first time).\nSo change your me.com address to something else entirely.  Make a new temporary email on gmail if you have to.  Then change your old apple ID to your current me.com address.  And all your old purchases are now under your brand spanking new email address.\n", "Q: How do I check an iPad 2's supported carrier? I had an AT&T iPad 2 3G which I took back to the Apple store on a warranty, and they gave me a replacement one. When I got back (it was an 1.5 hour drive), I realized that I forgot to specify that it's AT&T, not Verizon. Now I know that, chances are, they gave me the correct one, but how do I verify if the iPad is GSM or CDMA-enabled? I don't have a SIM card handy at the moment, so the easiest solution won't work here.\n\nA: Correct if wrong but I am sure that only the GSM devices have a micro sim card slot. The CDMA or Verizon ones do not have sim cards.\nSo as you are on AT&T they would have seen a SIM and got you one with a SIM.\n\nA: It's impossible for them to give you the wrong one even if they tried, the system doesn't allow it.\n", "Q: How do I use arguments together with bash aliases Today, I learned the very handy trick:\n\nman [some command] -t | open -f -a Preview\n\nI'd like to create an alias in my .bash_profile file as a shortcut. In order for this to work, I need to pass an argument into the aliased command. A little poking around and I came up with this:\n\nalias manp=\"man $1 -t | open -f -a Preview\"\n\nThis almost works, but if I type in, say \"manp ls\", it seems to be expecting the ls manpage to be in whatever my current directory is.\n\nA: You can't pass arguments to aliases. Aliases are just text substitutions without further logic. \nBut you can use shell functions to achieve the same result:\nfunction pman() {\n    if [ -x /usr/bin/open ]; then\n        man -t \"$1\" | open -f -a Preview\n    else\n        man \"$1\"\n    fi\n}\n\nThe if-then-else part is there just to make sure it also works on non-OSX systems.\nTo define a function, just include the definition from above into your ~/.bash_profile. Usage is identical to aliases or any other command: pman ls.\nAs @stuffe pointed out in a comment keeping aliases/functions in a separate file has its advantages (especially it allows you to re-read your aliases/functions into the current shell without executing any setup stuff from .bashrc or .bash_profile). To do this, create a separate file called .alias, .functions or similar and add\ntest -e ~/.alias && . ~/.alias\n\nto .bashrc or .bash_profile.\n\nA: I like @patrix's solution, but I just wanted to give another example, cut from my OSX's .bash_profile file, which in this case is setting TextWrangler to open a file that I pass as a parameter:\nfunction tw() { /usr/bin/open -a /Applications/TextWrangler.app \"$1\" ;}\nI wanted to be able to more easily edit my .bash_profile :-)\n", "Q: Any idea what happened to /Library/Receipts in Mac OS X Lion? Does anyone know why all the .bom files in /Library/Receipts moved to /var/db/receipts? \n\nA: first, /var/db on unix is the location for stuff like that.\nsecond, it's much easier to type as it is in lower case.\nso, not so unreasonable decision by apple's engineers.\n\nA: Receipts are in /var/db, but in my opinion it´s a bad decision because if someone backup /system to keep all applications data now receipts are not there any more.\nIt seems more and more difficult to keep a useful backup of all application files.\n\nA: /var is hidden and thus harder to get to. Apple has hidden ~/Library from the common user for the same reason, makes it harder to foul thing up.\n", "Q: OWC SSD freezes regularly I installed a new 115GB SSD with a clean lion install in my MacBook pro (2010) with the data doubler containing my old seagate hdd.\nThe install took over five hours, which made me pretty suspicious to begin with. \nBut now I'm seeing why: every 30 seconds or so, whatever app is using the disk seems to completely freeze. \nExamples:\nChrome accessing cache\nApp store downloading Xcode\nSublime text saving a file\nSafari doing anything\nDropbox sync\nI've turned off hard drive sleeping, which helped a bit but the benefits appear to be gone. I've also switched te hibernate mode to kill the image and disabled spotlight. The only general solutions google has suggested that I have yet to do are turn on TRIM (which OWC does not recommend for their drive) and add the noatime mount option. \nI'm doing a permissions repair now, but I could use more suggestions. \nFs_usage and logs don't show anything that catches the eye. \n\nA: I've got a OWC Mercury 115GB in my MacBook (2007) and encounter the same problem although never as severe as you describe.  It was fairly frequent (multiple times an hour) while I was running FileVault2 but once I turned it off, it became much less frequent (perhaps once an hour).  Normally, I see a complete freeze of the system, not just the application, for about 30 seconds.\nSSD garbage collection seems like a likely suspect.  In theory, the Sandforce controller plus the larger scratch pool on the OWC drive makes TRIM unneeded but if GC is the issue, maybe TRIM would reduce the frequency.  That said, I read lots of reports of people seeing a similar problem when they hacked their system to support TRIM with 3rd-party SSD's under Snow Leopard.  I stopped following the discussion when I upgraded to Lion so I don't know anything about current experiences.\nI try to keep at least 30GB free.\n5+ hours seems like a crazy long time to do a Lion install so maybe you have a different problem.\n\nA: I wonder why did you put HDD in optical bay. It has no advantage to it whatsoever. On the contrary you loose SMS for HDD and have to turn it off for SSD.\nBy the way the last thing could possibly cause such problems.\n\nA: So, after trying to ignore the problem for a long time, I switched my HDD and my SSD, so my HDD is in the main harddrive channel (where it started) and the SSD is where the optical drive goes.\nlo and behold, it works. I avoided doing this because I remember at one point you could not have your main OS drive be in the optical drive channel, yet it works. and works beautifully.\nso clearly the problem is as suspected with apples SATA3 support on that main harddrive channel.\n\nA: I have freezes on Corsair SSD (SandForce based) a few times per day on Snow Leopard. \nOne things is helped - is a updating SSD firmware to version 5.0.3. \nIts not easy and may be danger — but in my case its resolve problem on 100% — freezes is totally gone.\nI dont have Windows on my Mac Mini - and I use this instructions for updating SSD firmware http://forum.corsair.com/v3/showpost.php?p=635915&postcount=31 and its worked.\n", "Q: Torrent client for OS X that can be shared between multiple user accounts I am looking to transform my macMini into a media server that is shared by all my flat mates. \nI want to fully share: the torrent client, the media centre application and the media library.\nNow the question is what torrent client can be used between several accounts and preferably from Guest account also. If Guest account cannot be used, I will create a generic user instead of goest.\nStill, I would strongly prefer a torrent client that is able to run as daemon, without requiring you to login.\n\nA: You could use Transmission. But instead of just using the app set up the daemon and use the web interface or the remote client GUI to access the service.\nThis way you will be able to access the service even from other computers without having to open a user session on the computer.\n", "Q: iMac excessive GPU heat when using a second display Without a monitor connected (via Thunderbolt/mDP) to my iMac (2011, 3.4 GHz, 6970M 2GB), iStat Menus reports the GPU is using ~15 watts, and has a temperature of 60c. With one connected, it uses ~35 watts, and is ~80c. Both of these are when idling.\nRegardless of it pushing an extra 1920x1200 monitor, 80c seems very excessive. I use my computer near enough everyday for up to 10 hours, and I'm worried about the long-term stress due to such a high temperature.\nIs it normal, and if so, safe long-term?\n(SMC reset, fans working correctly, no dust in air ducts, etc.)\n\nA: Well, yes, driving two monitors requires more work from a GPU. But is 80 C normal, long-term-wise? I think not. You can get yourself badly burned at 80 deg, so why would this be good for a computer part, especially over 2 or 3 years? :-/\nI remember I had a problem with a Mac Pro years ago. All the RAM slots were occupied, and iStat reported 70+ temperatures in these slots, even though the fans were doing their job. But I had a lot of crashes and kernel panics. Then I thought that such temperatures could not be helping. Then I installed a little helper app that enables you to set the minimum speed for any fan in you system. I just set the fans to 1200 rpms instead of the default 800, and everything began behaving smoothly from that point. Putting my hand to the back of the computer I could really feel the difference in temperature. And the modules' temperature went from 70-80 C to 35-45 C in about 5-10 minutes!!\nOf course the fan noises was slightly more annoying, but I was willing to sacrifice a bit of my sanity for a stable computer. :-)\nThe app was named smcFanControl (http://www.eidac.de/). Works with Lion as of v 2.3. And free. There are of course other apps that would do the same, but this one has worked flawlessly for many years.\nI think that Apple is setting it's temperature threshold limits a little too low, all for the sake of silence of operation...\n\nA: I have the exact same model iMac as you, with two monitors. On my system with one monitor plugged in GPU diode is 66C, GPU heatsink is 58C. With both monitors plugged in the GPU diode was 70C (didn't catch heatsink). My ambient temperature is 17C and the system is basically idle. All fans are running at 1200rpm or lower.\nSo while I'm not seeing the same temperature jump you are, my temperatures are generally in the same range as yours. Power usage is about the same, too, and I measured a 25W increase plugging in a monitor via DVI. If you really want to see power usage change, try adjusting the brightness of the iMac LCD.\n80C on a GPU wouldn't worry me. I was unable to find official operating temperature ranges from AMD, but a quick Google search shows the overclocking nerds often operate up to at least 90C. In general I'd trust Apple's hardware design, they put a lot of thought and effort in to iMac cooling.\n\nA: I have been using an extra monitor on a 27\" iMac (2011). The top right area of the iMac gets very hot (I can't leave my hand on it for too long) and the GPU has been working at around 80C for almost a year now.  As soon as I removed the second monitor the GPU temperature dropped under 60C.\nPerhaps it is not related, but my power supply started buzzing (sounds like the 50Hz buzz you get from fluorescent lights) and after about of 1 month the computer turned off and did not go back on until it cooled down enough. \nThis set me back the cost of the PSU (plus some tools) as the iMac is no longer under warranty (I didn't take out AppleCare - but I would expect that something as standard as a PSU would function correctly for longer than a single year).\n", "Q: Crash of anything contacts-related After updating an iPad 2 to iOS 5, I lost the ability to do anything contacts-related:\n\n\n*\n\n*The \"Contacts\" app disappears the moment I start it\n\n*Composing an email works until I try to select a \"To\" address, at which point the compose window disappears\n\n*Opening the \"Mail, Contacts & Calendars\" section of the Settings causes the whole Settings thing to disappear.\n\n\nWhen installing iOS 5, I chose to sync the contacts to iCloud, at which point whatever screen I was using disappeared just like all of the above do.\nThe only advice I've found so far is \"wipe it clean and reinstall\". I tried that, but the crash remains. The crash is fixed only if I don't restore the backup.\nIs there anything I can try that would not involve me retyping all the contacts and re-configuring all the settings?\n\nA: It sounds like a corrupted contacts file. Restore your iPad from backup, then go into iTunes and tell it not to sync contacts to your iPad. This should remove all the contact data. Now try to open Contacts. If it opens and it is empty, it is good. If it still doesn't open, then this method won't work. Assuming it opened, go back into iTunes, tell it to sync contacts again. This will add all the contacts from your computer back onto your iPad. (This assumes that you store your contacts on your computer in the Address Book app. If not, you probably will lose all your contacts...)\n\nA: The only thing that fixed this was a complete wipe, without restoring contacts from backup. Restoring contacts would make the problem return.\n\nA: When I went to Settings -> Mail contacts and turned off contacts for the gmail account, the Contacts app loaded without crashing. But I suspect it is no longer linked to Gmail.  \n", "Q: Will Apple TV work if I connected it to a DVD player? My TV does not have an HDMI input, so I was wondering if I could still use it by connecing the Apple TV to my DVD player's HDMI port instead?\nMy DVD player (Philips DVP3560/F7) is capable of 1080p.\nAlso, will Apple TV work with my (rather old) TV? My TV (Samsung TXN2668WHF) is capable of 1080i and 480p.\n\nA: The apple TV 2 supports 480p. In my case it works through my AV/Amplifier which is connected with an HDMI cable to my TV.\nThe only catch would be HDCP which requires end to end protection of data. But from what I understand HDCP allows non HDCP compliant hardware to receive lower quality image using legacy connectors (RCA, S-Video ...). So it all depends on how your DVD player is connected to the TV.\n\nA: I have an Apple TV so I've been through the setup using an A/V receiver.  If you wish to keep the TV you have, you need an A/V receiver instead of regular DVD player.\nApple TV2 outputs HDMI and the device it connects to will need HDMI inputs.  I have a one year old Panasonic BluRay player plus a Sony progressive scan DVD player and neither supports HDMI inputs.  If you can find a DVD player with an HDMI input, it is probably a combination A/V receiver and DVD player.\nIf connecting the Apple TV2 is your goal, look to an A/V receiver.  You may find a receiver that also plays DVDs if you also want to play DVDs.\nApple TV2 now supports 720P which is better video than the RCA jacks can support.  The good news is your TV supports component video which is a better way than using the RCA port for video.  To use the component ports, you'll need component cables which are a step up from the RCA composite cables.  For audio, you will need to use the composite RCA audio ports but at least you'll be watching an HD quality picture.\n\nA: Highly doubtful.  A $50 DVD player with a single HDMI port is almost certainly an HDMI-output port only.\nIf you don't want to buy an A/V receiver or a new TV, you can buy a standalone HDMI-to-component decoder.  They seem to run $30 to $40.\n", "Q: mds error \"No store registered for scope\" for nonexistent volume My system log is flooded with error messages like the following:\nmds: (Error) Server: No store registered for scope \"/Volumes/Storage\"\n\nThe volume in the error was in use on a previous machine before I migrated to my current machine. Several have suggested adding and removing that volume in the Spotlight Privacy settings, but that volume no longer exists. Is there an mds configuration file somewhere that I can edit so that mds no longer looks for that volume?\n\nA: I use Alfred, a utility similar to Quicksilver. I had previously configured it to search /Volumes/Storage for apps, but never told it to stop trying to index that volume once I migrated to the new machine.\nI removed the /Volumes/Storage entry from Alfred's list of directories to index, and now the console messages have stopped.\n", "Q: What's the App Store refund policy? The Apple FAQ has this same question, but doesn't really have an answer. To quote:\n\nWhat is the Mac App Store refund policy?\nIf you experience a technical issue with an app, first contact the developer of the app for assistance. Their support contact information can be found on the app's page in the Mac App Store. If that does not resolve the issue, contact Mac App Store Customer Support.\n\nSo the policy is that I contact someone for help... but can I actually get a refund? Suppose I buy an app that claims to play avi files, but it only works with three out of four files I throw at it. Would that kind of problem typically result in a refund?\n\nA: Well, in my point of view, if the app works 75% of the time playing AVI files, I would try to contact the developer directly, there might be something required (like a plug-in) or a bug that needs fixing. Like it says in the FAQ, if contacting the developer produces no result, then I guess you could ask for a refund.\nI have heard that they gave refunds to people who were unhappy before, but it was a last-resort solution if I remember correctly. Also, I presume the App store staff will fight for you more if you paid 100$ for your app, and a little less if you only paid a buck... :-)\n\nA: My experience asking the iTunes App Store for a refund: \nWent to my account in iTunes, found the purchase and clicked on Report Problem, filled in brief description, (I had clicked on the wrong item when purchasing.) They responded immediately, had already looked at my records and found I had not asked for a refund before, and credited my account. \nSo whether you ask for refunds a lot is a factor!\n", "Q: what is DELUXE-USR-LOCAL-BIN-INSERT in ~/.profile file? My .profile file includes the following obscure lines.

I just wonder, do they support 1080p playback for MP4/H.264 files?\n\nA: As CanuckSkier said, it won't be reliable, even if it does Full HD. I have a Early 2009 lowest spec Mac Mini and it skipped enough frames to make a Full HD video unplayable when the bit rate was high enough, so i'm guessing a G4 Mac Mini would be far worse.\n\nA: I don't have any first-hand experience, but I'd guess not. At best you could probably get it playing but with lots of dropped frames. The graphics card is too old to have built in h.264 decoding, and I think even G5s couldn't do 1080p reliably.\n", "Q: Can you use the iTunes gift card to buy the cards on the new iOS5 cards app? Can you use the iTunes gift card to buy the cards on the new iOS5 cards app?\n\nA: Cards uses your Apple ID to make purchases rather than your iTunes account, when I ordered a card it asked for my CCV, the security number on the back of my card registered with my Apple ID. You will find the order history in your Apple account and not in your iTunes account.\nThis is the same service as the one found in iPhoto, which uses the same procedure.\n", "Q: Is it possible to adjust Lightroom settings with scroll wheel I'm using Mac OS X 10.7.2 \"Lion\" and Adobe Lightroom 3.5. On Windows, it was possible to adjust settings in the Develop module (exposure, contrast,...) by clicking on that setting and using the scroll wheel. \nOn my Mac, this doesn't work. Does anyone know if I can enable this?\n\nA: I don't think it is easily possible to use your scroll wheel to adjust. The only way I can think of is writing a script that translates your scroll wheel action to a up and down arrow key action. but that would prevent you from using your wheel for other actions.\nPossible alternative options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clicking on the number besides the slider and by holding your (left) mouse button and moving your mouse you can now adjust the slider.\n\n*Click on the number then change the number with your keyboard arrow(up/down) keys.

My 5 year old iPod Nano \"2G\" 8GB has recently began skipping during song playback.  It sounds like when a CD skips, a kind of digital glitching sound.  But lately it's gotten really bad, where it will skip repeatedly over a whole verse of a song.\nI did some research and found that it's actually possible for Flash memory to get fragmented. Does this really apply to my iPod Nano? \nIt is significant to mention this skipping just started happening as I've recently filled the iPod full to capacity.\nHow can I resolve it?  I have a Windows XP computer.  Would I really want to Defragment this iPod like you would with a spinning hard disk?  Would I be safe to simply Cut & Paste everything off the iPod's drive letter in Windows Explorer?  (Move it all temporarily to my hard drive, and then restore it?)\n\nA: I have encountered an issue similar to this on my iPhone, both on the 4S and 3GS. It took an embarrassingly long time to diagnose my headphones as the issue. I have a set of Sennheiser earphones with an inline remote, and if the jack becomes damaged, internal wires can get crossed and can start sending commands to the iPod application. I found that the play button would get hammered repeatedly as a result, and caused playback to stutter.\nSo, if your earphones have an inline remote and a damaged jack, try changing them. You might find a fix is cheaper than expected.\n\nA: Taking all data off the Nano and reinstalling everything might work around the fragmentation issue but I'm not sure how this could relate to the skipping you hear.\nHave you tried working through iPod nano (2nd generation) Troubleshooting Assistant already?\n", "Q: How can I add external Interface to my OS X with a valid IP?

I don't know if I must use bridging or nating or ... . please help find my solution.\n\nA: In System Preferences -> Network click on the + to add a new interface, in the popup choose Ethernet.\nThis will not create an additional en1 or en2 interface, but add an additional address to your en0 interface.\n\nA: What you are looking for is called IP address aliasing. In Mac OSX you can create an aliased address by issuing the following command (see the ifconfig manpage for more details):\nsudo ifconfig en0 alias $ADDRESS $NETMASK\n\nHowever, you cannot receive DHCP leases on these \"virtual NICs\" (see here for why) so you will need to have an available static IP address and know the appropriate gateway, all information you can get from your ISP.

I need to be able to work on a motion project on-the-go on a MacBook Pro, but it really seems to be lagging performance wise, so I want to transfer the project to a iMac while at home, and to transfer it back onto the MacBook when I go out again. So how do I transfer the active project along with all required data easily between two computers?\nEdit:\nNever mind, apparently when you save you can save as a folder, copying all the media into that folder.

That will ensure that PF\n# is disabled only when the last enable reference is released.\n#\n# Care must be taken to ensure that the main ruleset does not get flushed,\n# as the nested anchors rely on the anchor point defined here.\n#\n# See pf.conf(5) for syntax.\n#\n\n#\n# com.apple anchor point\n#\nnat-anchor \"com.apple/*\"\nrdr-anchor \"com.apple/*\"\nanchor \"com.apple/*\"\nload anchor \"com.apple\" from \"/etc/pf.anchors/com.apple\"\ninclude \"/etc/pf.userrules\"\n\nAnd in /etc/pf.userrules which is my own creation that might get overwritten at the next Apple update. \nblock in inet proto tcp from any to port 548\npass in inet proto tcp from { 10.10.10.11, 10.10.10.12 } to port 548\n\nThis works, but I wish I could uses the hosts access files. \n\nA: launchd doesn't use the libwrap, as shown by the command:\nnm -a /sbin/launchd | grep hosts\n\nThe fact that this command doesn't output anything means that\nlaunchd isn't using any entrypoint within the libwrap library\nof TCP wrapper.\nThis answer was checked on Snow Leopard and Lion.\nOn lion for example, libwrap is used by sshd and not telnetd nor launchd:\n\n% nm -a /usr/sbin/sshd | grep hosts\n                 U _hosts_access\n% nm -a /usr/libexec/telnetd | grep hosts\n%\n\nThe libwrap library doesn't exist on Mountain lion.\n", "Q: How do I troubleshoot 3G connection on the iPhone? A particular client whom I provide email hosting support for, has problems connecting to the mail server using iPhone, via IMAP and on the China Mobile 3G data plan in China.\nWhen asked over the phone what error message he got on the iPhone, he says iPhone only reports cannot connect to server. He says when using WiFi everything is fine.\nIn general, are there any ways I can troubleshoot the 3G network?\n\nA: Wow, tough one. Tough because there are many unknowns in this equation... \nNo way to know for sure if China Mobile is not causing the problem by blocking, for example, the ports required to connect to the mail server. The only way to test this would be to change the port settings on both the server and the client, I think. In theory, it is entirely possible for them to block ports they believe can be problematic or some other reason, although I don't see how blocking standard mail ports would be problematic and help their customers...\nAre other services functioning properly when on 3G? Like web-surfing, app updates, chatting, etc.?\nIt might be a case where your client needs to contact China Mobile and ask them for a little help troubleshooting this problem on their side, just to be sure it's not their network that's causing the problem...\n\nA: There is zTools on the App store, like 99 cents, will do Ping, Trace, Whois, Port scan, etc. Maybe this is what you're looking for? This is the only one I know because I have it, perhaps there is other, similar apps on the store.\n", "Q: IP Masquerading Mac OS X I am trying to figure out how to use this command with mac os x\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth2 -j MASQUERADE\n\nThe only thing I have found that seems like it might work is\nipfw add m all from me to 0.0.0.0/0\n\nbut I get: ipfw: invalid action m\\n'\nDoes anybody know how I could translate the iptable code to mac compatible code?\n\nA: If you are just trying to share your internet connection, you can do this from System Preferences > Sharing > Internet Sharing\nIf that's not why you posted this and you still do it manually(see Eir Nym's post). Don't forget to:\n    sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1\n\n\nA: You can try something like following. Please, read all details here.

You'll have to \"sudo su\" from a Terminal session in order to see that directory. Check for any errors being reported in a filed named like this: \"Your-computer-name.local.err\"\nReport back whatever you see that doesn't make sense.\nYou can also check out the startup script to make sure there are no errors. Find that here: /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/MYSQLCOM\n\nA: Starting MySQL server automatically actually means executing the /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld dæmon on startup. If MySQL won't do it for you, it's easy enough to add the necessary instructions yourself.\nFor this, we'll add a launchd job descriptor to the /Library/LaunchDaemons folder. The procedure is very well described in this Mac OS X Hints article.\n\nNote: I would have liked to copy and edit it here, since it adds some details that are unnecessary in this case, but I couldn't find license information about Mac OS X Hints' content, so I'll simply link.\n\nA: Use terminal and paste this snippet:\nsudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mysql.mysqld.plist\n\n", "Q: Does Evernote on the iPad have undo functionality? Am i wrong or it is true that the evernote app on iPad doesn't have undo funcionality ?\nFor example if I delete a line, it is gone for ever ?\n\nA: As with the iPhone, if you shake the iPad vigorously, you get offered the choice of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Undo\n\n*Cancel\n\n\nFor me, this doesn't feel at all natural on the iPad, and I imagine that's why some iPad applications (e.g. Textastic) provide their own Undo/Redo buttons.\nEdit\nThanks to @Lizzan for also pointing out in the comments:\n\nThere's also an Undo button in the bottom left on the numerical keyboard - makes a bit more sense than shaking the iPad.\n\n", "Q: Can I install Snow Leopard over a network? I have a Snow Leopard DMG on one mac, and an empty MacBook I wish to install Snow Leopard onto. I have a Snow Leopard DVD that I can use to get into the installer with, but it's scratched so it won't install.\nWhat are my options for installing Snow Leopard? Over the network? Or putting it on USB stick/HDD? I know I could burn the DMG to a DVD but I was wondering if there were quicker/easier alternatives.\n\nA: You say the MacBook is empty - does this not have any Mac OS on it?\nTo install from a USB or HDD you will need to open disk utility and from there select the restore option of the dvd with the hard drive or USB as destination, so if it does not have disc utility then no you can't, you will need to write a CD/DVD.\n", "Q: Can I create a bootable DiskWarrior disk? I'm in trouble. My Mac won't boot (frozen on gray apple logo with spinning wheel), and it appears to be a disk problem. I ran disk utility from Lion's recovery disk, but it says it can't repair my disk and that I should erase it.\nI want to try diskwarrior, but before buying it I want to know if I can create a bootable disk with the downloadable version. I can't wait for the DVD to ship -- it'd take at least two weeks if not more, and I need it right now.\nI searched on alsoft's site and the web, but I don't understand if it's possible or not. I'm guessing it is, otherwise buying this program is useless in case of emergencies (I'd rather get a new Mac than wait for the DVD to ship). \nSo the question: has anyone managed to create a bootable diskwarrior disk?\n\nA: you could try DasBoot and create a bootable disk with a USB thumb drive and a running OS, obviously not yours, maybe someone who has a similar OS. DasBoot allows you to install custom apps, and then you can boot from it and repair your disk.\nI hope you have a backup. It could be a mechanical problem, which no software in the world can fix.\nDo you hear strange noises coming from the HD? Is it a recent model? Maybe you could bring it to a genius bar so they can make sure it is not a mechanical failure or some other problem...\n\nA: Got a reply from the support. What I asked is not possible -- but you could use two alternative methods (in my case I couldn't do that though).\n\nOur licensing agreement with Apple doesn't permit transmitting the\noperating system via the internet.\n\nAs there are other methods to run the application (as outlined\npreviously [link]) most folks can run the software using the downloaded application.\n\nAlso, DiskWarrior is the type of utility to prevent these problems -\nregular maintenance can help prevent the emergency situation.\n\n\nA: For the future you might want to try installing OS X onto an external hard drive.

In iTunes (v10.5.0) on my PC (Windows 7 - 64 bit), I did a 'add file to library' and they appear under TV shows under library.  \nThen I did a sync with my iPad.  They do not seem to appear in my iPad (iPad 2, now running iOS 5).  The rest of the sync seems to go fine (i.e. recent songs are added to iPad, apps are all fine).  There is no error or warning message. Either I'm failing to see them in the iPad (I looked under TV shows and some other places, where should I look?), or they weren't really pushed to the iPad. \nPerhaps the format is not supported or some other problem?  Like I said, no warning or error.  Finally, I should mention that in iTunes under \"Dave's iPad\", they appear under TV Shows.\nHow can I see my .mp4 files on the iPad?\n\nA: The sordid state of app names for Audio / Video is kind of annoying in iOS' history.\n\n\n*\n\n*On the iPhone, before iOS 5, there was an iPod icon, which did audio and video.\n\n*On the iPod touch, no matter the version, there have always been separate 'Music' and 'Video' icons.\n\n*On the iPad, before iOS 5, there was an iPod icon, which only did audio, and there was a seperate Video icon for videos.\n\n\nAs of iOS 5, all devices now have separate \"Music\" and \"Video\" app icons. At least they're consistent now…\n\nA: Ahh, found it.  It was on the iPad all along.  Under \"Videos\".  [That is there is a \"Videos\" icon on iPad].  I don't recall this is where they appeared for some other material I transfer to iPad (pre-iOS 5), but perhaps I'm mistaken.    I was expecting it in iTunes icon on iPad.

More Information\n@irrantion John, you can't have a long \"random password\" and expect it to be easy to enter whilst keeping it secure. \nYou could just copy and paste from a document (via usb) or printed document.\nMaybe try something 20 characters long, or just accept its going to take forever to enter the password in. Remember keychain can sync your passwords for you.\nSure you can enable WPS on your router but then why have a complex password at all. A 64 character password becomes a 7 (4+3) character (ONLY 11,000 POSSIBILITIES!!) password.\n\nA: OS X doesn't support WPS. You'll have to manually enter the key. To do this, select your wifi network from the drop-down in the menu bar:\n\nThen when prompted type in the wifi password:\n\nIf you don't know your password, you typically get it from your router's web interface (either via another computer, or connect your MacBook Pro via ethernet).

I have a 3 year old 15\" 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo MBP that I upgraded to 4 GB of RAM about a year ago.\nBefore I made the switch to Apple I used to feel the need to upgrade my Windows based laptops every 3 years, that's about when they started to feel sluggish.  After paying double what I would pay for a Windows machine, I'd hoped I might be able to squeeze a bit more life out of my Mac, maybe 4 years.  But it's coming up to its 3rd birthday and it's starting to feel a little sluggish at times.  In fairness, it is mainly when using apps like iPhone 11 and Final Cut Pro X.  \nI replaced the 250GB drive in it with a 500 GB 7200 RPM hard drive about 18 months ago, so I sometimes wonder if that could have introduced a problem that might be causing it to run slow.\nSo my question is: is there a way to test the HD, RAM or other things to see if there's a problem with my setup that could be easily fixed, or am I just expecting to much of my machine?\nAnthony\n\nA: I can't say the drive would have caused issues, as MacBook Pro models form 3 years ago came with 5400rpm hard drives. What does your system say in Activity Monitor? Any additional overhead in CPU or Disk I/O? If it's just system strain, and you have the appropriate amount of RAM, a SSD is the only additional upgrade that comes to mind.\n", "Q: Network problem isolated to this macbook air, where to look next?

So that's what I keep doing.\nMy best guess is I have either have something running on the machine that I haven't identified causing this issue ... or ...?\nVery open to any ideas on where to look or what types of things might cause this :)\n\nA: I advise you to download and run iStumbler http://istumbler.net/ on your Mac.\nRun it around the place where you want to work and at peek hours\nof the day (where your neighbours are also using their Wi-Fi PC and\nrouters).\nThis run should give you a clear indication of which channels are\nreceived at a high power level. You should absolutely avoid these\noverloaded channels (most probably 1, 6 & 11) and pick a channel which\nis either free or received at the lowest signal level where and when you work.\n", "Q: How can I reduce the mobile data used by the iPhone Mail app? I am on a 200 MB/month plan, and feel that Mail is responsible for most of my mobile data usage, sometimes pushing me over the 200 MB, even if I almost never use the iPhone in places where there is no WiFi. I can either setup the phone:\n\n\n*\n\n*To use push or pull at a regular interval. In either case, it will sometimes download new mail in the background, while the phone is locked. And this means it will do so over 3G instead of WiFi, even if there is WiFi where I am.\n\n*To disable push and and set fetch to \"manually\". I guess this will reduce my mobile data usage, but I would then have to wait after launching Mail for it to download my mail.\n\n\nIdeally, I'd like the iPhone to use \"push\" when over WiFi and \"fetch manually\" when over 3G, but there doesn't seem to be an option for this.\nWhat would you say is the optimal setup to reduce the use of  mobile data, without going to \"fetch manually\"?\n\nA: There is no way to do this in iOS.\nFor a workaround you could turn off 3G and turn it on when you need it, just before you open up Mail, that way when you are connected to WiFi you will get push, but manually have to get from 3G.\nIt's not a great situation: I would just increase your data cap, although I know that is not always easy, hence you asking for this workaround.\n\nA: As of iOS 7, you can disable mobile data on a per-app basis. If you are almost never in a place without Wi-Fi access, you could disable mobile data for the Mail app. However, you will then only be able to receive new mail when you have Wi-Fi access.\nTo do this, go to Mobile Data under Settings and scroll down. Each app is listed along with how much mobile data has been used since statistics were last reset, and a toggle to disable/enable mobile data for each app.\nIf you're running iOS 9 or above, you will also see a setting for \"Wi-Fi Assist\". This allows the device to use mobile data when on Wi-Fi if it considers its Wi-Fi connection to be poor. If you are seeing higher than expected mobile data usage you may want to experiment with turning this setting off.\n(I know this question is very old, but I found it while searching for something similar on Google, so thought it could use some up-to-date information.)\n\nA: There is an app called Onavo Extend that helps reduce data usage. \nNote: Onavo sends all your data through their servers for the compression/decompression to work.\n", "Q: Can Mac OS X distribute applications/processes across multiple intel cores? Or does efficient usage of cores depend only on whether a given application is written to take advantage of them? I am deciding between a Mac Mini - Intel dual core i7 2.7Ghz vs. one with a quad core i7 2.0Ghz.\n\nA: Any modern operating system, including OS X of course, will take advantage of multiple cores as best it can. Applications need to be multi-threaded to truly take advantage of this within themselves,  but even when an application is not able to take direct advantage of multiple cores, the OS will still use its resources efficiently by finding something else for the 'idle' cores to do.\n", "Q: sshdfilter and ipfw - why are my rules flushed so often? I have sshdfilter setup to maintain ipfw rules when someone is un invitedly trying to login my system. This has been working quite a while. Since a while - beginning to suspect the last lion upgrade (10.7.2) - I see sshdfilter adding rules and, when I check, I don't see the rules in ipfw using 'ipfw show'. When I add them manually, they show but again, after a while they are gone.\nWhat I found in /var/log/system.log are messages like:\nNov  6 21:53:12 mac servermgrd[31448]: servermgr_ipfilter:ipfw config:Notice:Flushed IPv4 rules\nNov  6 21:53:12 mac servermgrd[31448]: servermgr_ipfilter:ipfw config:Notice:Flushed IPv6 rules\n\nand I assume that after such a flush, my rules are in bit heaven.\nHow can I prevent my blocks are flushed?\nMy setup looks very familiar to sshdfilter improvements \nedit: In the meantime I changed sshdfilterrc to add the rules to /etc/ipfilter/ipfw.conf. This file is imported when the flush is executed. Disadvantage is that this file has to be maintained....\n\nA: Change /etc/sshdfilterrc to add the rules to /etc/ipfilter/ipfw.conf. This file is imported when the flush is executed. Disadvantage is that this file has to be maintained....\nThis prevents the blocks staying in bit heaven when the flush comes along because this file is read after the flush is executed.\nedit: on request added changes I made in /etc/sshdfilterrc\nfirewalladd='/sbin/ipfw add $idx deny all from $ip to any in; echo add $idx deny all from $ip to any in >> /etc/ipfilter/ipfw.conf;echo +`date` $ip >>/etc/ipfilter/sshdfilter_block.log'\nfirewalldel='/sbin/ipfw del $idx deny all from $ip to any in;grep -v \" $ip \">/tmp/ipfw.conf;mv /tmp/ipfw.conf /etc/ipfilter/ipfw.conf;echo -`date` $ip >>/etc/ipfilter/sshdfilter_block.log'\n\nthis takes care of the block and the block Cancel actions, including some block.log to see when and how long an ip has been blocked.\n", "Q: Finder is using over 100% of CPU and makes entire system slow Every since upgrading to Lion my system has started to slow down, big time.  I realized that the Finder was using over 100% of the CPU, even when I am really not doing anything with it.  I restart it, and after a bit, it is back up to over 100%, making everything else crawl.\nI have done a disk repair and permissions repair as suggested elsewhere but that does not seem to help.  Does anyone know how to fix this problem?\n\nA: I figured out what it was a permissions issue.  Running Fix Permissions in Disk Util fixed the issue.  Strange.  But, found one other place online talking about this and how it worked for them.\n\nA: Please attach a screenshot of the Activity Monitor window during this issue, or describe which process in specific. There are a number of these related to functions with Finder or the system that may or may not be connected.\n", "Q: Why aren't some of my songs transferring to my new iPhone? I purchased a new iPhone a couple days ago. During the setup process, I restored from a backup of my old iPhone, from about two weeks ago (the old iPhone was stolen, so the backup was a bit old). When I restored, I got a warning that 21 items could not be synced, and to check iTunes for more details. iTunes did not give me any warnings or information at all.\nI noticed that the 21 songs are all songs I had previously purchased from the iTunes Music Store. They are not on the iPhone; in the iPhone music list view (in iTunes), they all have a sync icon next to them:\n\nI can't seem to get them transferred to my iPhone. I tried removing all the music from the iPhone and resyncing, but they still were not transferred. I then reauthorized all my computers, and re-authorized my computer, but the songs would still not sync.\nWhat's wrong? Is there a way to sync these previous purchases to my iPhone? I should note that this is not happening with all of my songs; some purchased songs were transferred successfully.\n\nA: After trying a series of troubleshooting moves, including restoring my iPhone from an iCloud backup, the only thing that worked was restoring my iPhone from an iTunes backup, as described in this article.\n\nA: I was having a similar problem and had to go into my iphone's settings, under music, and switch on  \"Show All Music\". The songs showed up in my playlists and then I just had to click the cloud to download them.\n\nA: I had the same problem but I just know how to solve it. You simply uncheck all the songs in iTunes and sync. Then all songs in your iPhone are gone, now check all the songs in iTunes again then sync. Everything will show up in your iPhone.\nWhen you hold the command key down, clicking one song's check will toggle all the selected songs (the entire library if you haven't narrowed the search).\n\nA: That totally works!!! Go into iTunes  on your phone then into purchased and hit 'not on this iPhone' at the top of screen. Then start downloading all of your missing songs!\n\nA: First of all, in my opinion this only happens with songs that you have MANUALLY deleted from the iPhone ('swipe and delete' in the music app). These songs are never synched again.\nAnother solution (if you are afraid of restoring your whole iPhone) is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone it appears in the left column\n\n*Select 'manually manage music' on the first tab\n\n*Click on the small arrow on the left side of the iPhone-icon\n\n*Go to music\n\n*Delete all 'greyed out songs'\n\n*Go to your music library, select the songs you want so sync and use Ctrl+C to copy\n\n*Go to your iPhone -> Music again and paste the songs (Ctr+V)\n\n*The file is copied to the iPhone\n\n*Turn 'manually manage music' back off, if desired\n\n\nA: Rename the title of the tracks that are not transferring. You can add a \"1\" at the end of the title or even add an extra space at the end of the title. For example: \"Baby one more time\" to \"Baby one more time \" or Baby one more time1\". Once you rename it, try syncing. This worked for me!\n\nA: I had the same problem, and I solved it by adding all the songs that were grayed out to a playlist. Have your iTunes set so that you manage your music manually and delete the gray songs off your iPhone/iPod. Add the gray songs to a playlist and drag the playlist into your device. This adds all the songs you wanted to your music player, and once that's done syncing, you can disconnect it from the computer and delete the playlist. Voila, your problem is solved.\n\nA: It may seem strange, but I solved this problem by going to iPod → Music → then checked Include music videos and Include voice memos. Doesn't make sense but it worked.\n\nA: are you using the same iTunes account on your iPhone as the one the tracks were purchased from?\nYou could also try locating the original files, convert them into another audio file type, and then put them back into iTunes.\n\nA: The best fix may be to download fresh copies of the previously purchased music.  Log in to iTunes Store and click on \"Purchased\" on the right side of the iTunes store.\nOn this page, choose Music and your purchased songs will appear.  Ideally, you can choose \"Not in my Library\" which should display the 21 missing songs.\nThen download all.  With freshly download purchases from Itunes Store, they should now sync.  Here's Apple's link on the topic.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht2519\n\nA: I see that this thread is several months old so I'm hoping this will help those that experience this problem in the future.  I was transferring music from my iTunes to my new iPhone and I noticed several songs weren't able to be transferred to my phone even though they were listed as such on iTunes.  Similar to the user above, the songs that wouldn't transfer were \"grayed out\" with a \"sync\" icon listed next to each untransferrable song.  \nThis is what worked for me:\nIn iTunes, I simply clicked on my iPhone (for anyone else it will read \"YourName's iPhone\") and then clicked the \"Sync\" button on the lower right-hand corner of your screen.  Doing this immediately synced the untransferrable songs on my iTunes to my iPhone.\n\nA: I had the same problem described here, but syncing and other suggested solutions just weren't working. \nMy solution (discovered by accident) was to open up iTunes ON my iPhone. Once opened I clicked on \"Purchased Music\". You'll see that although your iTunes on your computer has downloaded it, you phone hasn't. \nOn my iPhone I then started clicking on the box next to each song in \"Purchased albums\" that hadn't downladed. The phone immediately started the process of transferring them onto the phone.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Turned out I had just used all of the phone's storage. Deleted a few photos and they started syncing.\n", "Q: How can I quickly type special characters on an iPhone/iPad using a bluetooth keyboard? I have an iPhone with a Bluetooth Logitech keyboard that also works with iPads. The solution works great for me in meetings etc. because it is a lightweight solution. The problem I face (and I am really there is no solution for it) is that I need special characters all the time.\nI write text in Portuguese. In a Windows keyboard (I am a new iPhone user coming from the Windows platform) I can quickly type a character like ' followed by an a and get á. Or ` with an a to get à. Is it possible to quickly type letters with accents in an external iPhone/iPad keyboard and get accents to display quickly and easily? \nThe only methods and recommendations I have found so far are the ones like this. Is there a quicker/better/handier solution with an external keyboard? Thank you.\n\nA: You can use the same keyboard combinations as on OS X to create accented characters. Here are the commands for each:\n\n\n*\n\n*⌥+` then a=à\n\n*⌥+e then a=á\n\n*⌥+u then a=ä\n\n*⌥+i then a=â\n\n*⌥+n then a=ã\n\n\nAfter you press the ⌥ (option/alt key) combination, the accent character will show up. Then, typing the next character will replace the accent with the accented character, if possible. If the character you type cannot have that accent, the accent will stay, followed by the character.\n\nA: On your iOS device, open \"Settings\" and go to \"General\"->\"Keyboard\". If your hardware keyboard is connected to iOS, you will see an entry for \"Hardware Keyboard\" just under \"Keyboards\". \nOpening that, you will see a list of the languages you use under iOS and for each one you'll be able to choose a keyboard layout. Choose \"US International - PC\" and you will be able to form the special characters just like you would on a Windows (or OS X) machine configured with an \"US International\" keyboard: \n\n\n*\n\n*a + ~ = ã\n\n*e + ^ = ê\n\n*u + \" = ü\n\n*n + ~ = ñ\n\n*and so on...\n\n\nIt is also possible to choose other keyboard layouts, if yours doesn't follow the US standard.

I've been having a problem with my iPod now for actually something like 2+ years (yes I probably should have looked into it long ago). It's a 6th generation 80GB iPod Classic.\nIt goes like this: I plug it in to transfer songs to it, and after transferring a limited number of tracks (around 10), iTunes and/or the iPod crashes and I need to kill the iTunes process to get it to disconnect. After this happens, my iPod will not accept any new tracks when re-plugged in, instead crashing on any attempt to transfer a new track, and to get it to work again I need to restore it to factory settings at which time it will accept another 10 or so songs before crashing. Sometimes, after the initial crash, it also wipes it's own hard drive and I lose whatever songs I did manage to transfer.\nObviously, it's a pretty low-chance case, but I can't afford a new iPod right now and this one is getting worse and worse (it used to let me put on a whole 50 songs!), so I would just like to know if there's anything at all I could try to make it work again (it's long out of warranty and I'm not living in a place where I have access to support).\nThings I have tried: Different computers, different cables, waiting a very long time to see if it uncrashes\n\nA: If you are still having no luck after the restore try reinstalling iTunes. Download it from the Apple website restart it, you may need to relocate your library if you have moved it from the original destination.\nIf nothing above works then you should try following the steps on the Apple iPod support website\n", "Q: How can I remove the Finder icon from my Dock? I've started using Forklift as a Finder replacement, so I don't need Finder in my Dock. In fact, I would much rather have Forklift be the farthest left icon so I don't accidentally click on Finder.\nThe usual method of dragging the app out of the Dock doesn't work, and neither does command-dragging. The contextual menu doesn't allow you to remove the icon.\nIs there some way to, on Lion, remove the Finder from the Dock?\nPerhaps there's a database or plist file I can change?\n\nA: There is no easy way to do this, but there is a little hack :)\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/\n\n*Backup DockMenus.plist\n\n*Open DockMenus.plist in your favorite text editor with root access\n\n*Find section finder-running and add new sub-section\n<dict>\n    <key>command</key>\n    <integer>1004</integer>\n    <key>name</key>\n    <string>REMOVE_FROM_DOCK</string>\n</dict>\n\nor just Download my version of DockMenus.plist\n\n*In plist editor file should look like this:\n\n\n*Open Terminal and run killall Dock. \n\n*Right click on Finder icon in Dock - Bingo!\n \np.s After Dock restart (manual relaunch or mac reboot) you need manually remove Finder icon from Dock \n\nA: It works for me on HighSierra (10.13.6) with SIP disabled.\nI have used the following command to edit the .plist file:\nPL=\"/System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/DockMenus.plist\"&&\nsudo -- defaults write $PL finder-running -array-add  '<dict><key>command</key><integer>1004</integer><key>name</key><string>REMOVE_FROM_DOCK</string></dict>'\n\nCheck result with sudo defaults read $PL finder-running.\nIf it looks fine run sudo chmod -v +r $PL; killall Dock.\nHere is the Italian formatted version of that AppleScript:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell UI element \"Finder\" of list 1 of process \"Dock\"\n        perform action \"AXShowMenu\"\n        click menu item \"Rimuovi dal Dock\" of menu 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThat’s all, I hope it is useful as a quick complete recap.\n", "Q: MacBook is sleeping despite being set to \"never\" sleep My 13\" MacBook (late 2006) is set to never sleep but after about 3 hours the whole computer still goes to sleep.\n\n\n*\n\n*Lid is always UP.\n\n*Power Adapter is plugged in and indicator light is green when battery is 100%.\n\n*Recently upgraded to Mac OS 10.6.8 and all system software is up to date.\n\n\nHere are my exact settings...\nSystem Settings -> Energy Saver ->\n\n\n*\n\n*Computer Sleep: Never\n\n*Display Sleep: 15 minutes\n\n*Put the hard disks to sleep when possible:  NOT checked\n\n*Wake for Ethernet:  NOT checked\n\n*Automatically reduce brightness before display sleep: checked\n\n*Startup automatically after power failure:  NOT checked\n\n\n\n(please ignore the \"battery charge: 94%\", it's only because I'm composing this question while using the battery)\nI recently installed Simon for monitoring uptime of websites.  I cannot allow the computer to sleep since it stops the software monitor.  Exactly after three hours of inactivity, the MacBook goes to sleep so then Simon stops.  The console confirms sleep mode.  I can wake it without a problem but it's frustrating to see that my monitoring was interrupted for many hours by this sleep bug.\nIt's like it thinks it's set to sleep after 3 hours despite it being clearly set to \"never\".\nSo where is this thing stuck?  Is there some cache or plist file I need to blow out?

How can I tell the difference between the entire computer sleeping and only the display sleeping?\nI'm trying to diagnose sleep problems, and one of the basic things I need to know is the difference between these two kinds of sleep modes. I can't rely on the times I set in the settings since that is what I'm trying to debug.\nI have a 13\" Macbook Air late 2010, if that makes any difference.\nThings I thought might help:\n\n\n*\n\n*Trackpad move vs. trackpad click. I've noticed that when I force the computer to sleep via the Apple menu, it's not enough to move around the mouse via the trackpad... I must press down on the trackpad or another key.\n\n*Caps Lock light: If I leave caps lock on for testing purposes, sometimes I will see the light turn off, while other times it stays on. I thought that perhaps this could tell me the difference between the two.\n\n*The Apple logo on the back side of the laptop, although its light seems to go off in both cases, so that doesn't help\n\n*Plugging in a USB device which has a light, which indicates when the computer is supplying it power. The light seems to shut off when in sleep mode, but stays on when the display is sleeping. I'm not sure if this is a reliable method, though\n\n\nThe problem with the first two methods is that I was able to recreate a situation where the caps lock key remains on, but the trackpad mouse move does not wake the computer.\nAre there any reliable ways to know if the entire computer has gone to sleep or not?\n\nA: There's a really simple way to test this if you have another Mac, or any other machine really.\nTurn on one of the Sharing features on the Mac in question (File Sharing, Remote Login etc.) and try to connect to it from something else. If the entire machine is asleep it won't work. If just the screen is asleep it will.\nI assume you're connecting to some kind of wireless network with the MacBookAir, so you could also check the list of connected wireless clients on your router. If the entire machine is asleep it should not be connected. It may still show up in the list of DHCP clients (clients that have requested an address from the router recently), but it should not be connected. \n\nA: Use the power led:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the led is off, the computer is either full on or full off.\n\n*If the screen is dark but the led is on the display is off\n\n*If the screen is dark and the led is pulsating the computer is sleeping\n\n\nA: In all of my testing, I closed all running applications, and set the sleep to 1 minute. Normally the screen will dim at 30 seconds and turn off at 1 minute. (Just because the display turns off does not mean that the computer is asleep.)\nCapsLock key:\nThis does not work. The light on the caps lock key seemed to turn off at around 5:50 seconds. However, the computer goes to sleep much earlier than that. In my testing, it seems that it goes to sleep at 1:05 seconds. Also, keeping CapsLock on causes the dim and turn off times to be different. Instead of dimming at 0:30, the screen dims at 0:54 and shuts off at 1:00.\nUSB device:\nThis doesn't work either. There are cases where the light remains on on the USB device, yet the computer is asleep.\nTrackpad touch:\nThis seems to be the most reliable method. The only problem is that it will force the screen to turn on if it wasn't sleeping. This can be annoying during tests such as this because it resets the timer that causes the computer to go to sleep again. If you touch the trackpad and the screen does not turn on, it means the computer is asleep. If you touch it and it turns on, then only the screen went to sleep. Notice that this is different than depressing the trackpad (i.e. physically clicking it).\n", "Q: Can I hide the sync icon in the menu bar on Lion? This menu bar icon is useless and takes up space.\n\nI use iCloud on Mac OS X Lion to sync contacts, calendars, and the like. On Snow Leopard I could use an option in the iSync preferences to remove this icon from my menu bar, but iSync isn't around anymore. Is there any way to get rid of it?\n\nA: Just ⌘ Command-Drag & Drop it away from the menu bar, this way you can also re-arrange your icons. This trick will only work for OSX icons (e.g. Time Machine or WiFi), for non OSX native icons (e.g. Dropbox or GeekTool) you need a third party app like Bartender or Menu Bar Rearranger.\n\nA: That sync icon is also used by MobileMe and another way to get rid of it is to log out of mobileme after migrating to iCloud (System Preferences/MobileMe). I had the same question and finally logged out of mobileme (which wasn't being used anymore) and it disappeared.\n", "Q: Applescript to disable screen saver through sending keystroke I'm trying to write an applescript that will disable the screen saver through sending a keystroke.  Something like sending a \"shift key\" pressed every 30 seconds.\nI don't want to have the applescript actually disable the screen saver through system preferences.\n\nA: Check out the dictionary for the System Events app that's included with Applescript. You can access it from the AppleScript Editor:\n\nFile > Open Dictionary... > System Events.app\n\nThere's a class called \"screen saver preferences object\" in there that should do what you need without having to script the GUI.\nEDIT: Try setting the property \"delay interval\" of the object to 0 to disable the screensaver.\n\nA: You could also use an on idle() handler, like this:\non idle\n   -- Add your code here to keep the computer awake.\n   return 1800 -- The number of seconds the script should delay before being idle again\nend idle\n\nbut the screen saver prefs obj is a better tool. It does exactly what you want.\n\nA: You have defined HOW you want to solve the problem. I don't think that is the right approach. I think you should consider disabling and reenabling the screensaver.\nThis sets the Screen Saver to \"never\":\nosascript -e 'tell app \"System Events\" to tell screen saver preferences to set delay interval to 0'\n\nThis sets the Screen Saver to 5 minutes:\nosascript -e 'tell app \"System Events\" to tell screen saver preferences to set delay interval to 300'\n\nThe interval value is in seconds even though the GUI shows minutes.\nIf your version of OSX has a slider in the Screen Saver System Preferences, the slider will update. Later versions, like Mountain Lion, have a dropdown with a few enumerated options. This does not update.\n", "Q: Problem Updating Xcode 4.1 to 4.2 I had installed Xcode 4.1 on Lion and recently I saw the update for Xcode in the appstore. It was to update my current Xcode 4.1 to 4.2 with iOS5 SDK. It's around 1.8 GB of download and I did update it through app store. But at the end of the update, the update download restarted and I let it happen. But even after second download it restarted the download and started the updates downlad for third time. \nI'm sure there is something wrong with something; either with OS or App Store or Xcode. Is anybody facing similar issue?\n\nA: Downloading Xcode from the AppStore actually downloads an installer package. I can't remember exactly where this downloads to since I've already moved mine to a backup drive in case I need to reinstall, but it's most likely /Applications.\nOnce this is downloaded, you need to run the installer to actually update your Xcode installation. It should be titled something like \"Install Xcode.app\". Run that and you should be OK.\nYou've likely downloaded that package 3 times already though, so check your /Applications folder before downloading it again. :)\n", "Q: How can I create a Link of my Harddisk on the Desktop Once upon a time I had a Link to the Harddisk directly on my desktop. Since I set up Lion, the Link is not there anymore. \nHow can I make it appear again? Drag & Drop from Finder doesn't work.\n\nA: The normal solution is to go to finder preferences, and select the things (including hard disks) you want to show on your desktop. If your hard disk is external, I think you can create an alias (Right Click > Make Alias) and put it on your desktop, to represent it even when the actual disk isn't connected, not that it would allow you access to the files on this hard disk.\n\nA: Go to Finder's Preferences, then in the General Tab, check the \"Hard Disk's\" (or external depending on what hard disk you're talking about) box.  It should show up on your desktop now.\n\nA: The answer from @abc9005 and @theAmateurProgrammer are correct for the case where you have only 1 internal harddisk or have multiple internal hard disks and wish to show them all.\nWhen you have multiple internal hard drives and wish to only make the Startup Disk visible on your OSX Lion desktop, and your Startup Disk is named \"Macintosh HD\" then you can use this Terminal.app command:\n$ ln -s \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD\" ~/Desktop\n\n\nA: You can also go to the \"Go\" menu in Finder. Then type /Volumes. \nCopy the alias to the Macintosh HD, from there to your desktop. \n", "Q: How can I create an event that recurs every other day in the iPhone calendar? How do I create an event on my I phone calendar that would occur every other day without manually putting in the \nEvent on each day in the calendar?\n\nA: If you sync your iPhone calendar with your Mac, either through iTunes, MobileMe, or a free iCloud account you can just set up your event in iCal on your Mac. Choose for repeat Custom. Then choose for frequency Daily and set it to Every 2 days.\n\nA: If you are syncing the calendar via iCloud, you can also set this up using the web interface http://www.icloud.com. When creating a new event (bottom right corner, + button), set repeat to custom and enter your desired interval.\n", "Q: Are purchases from the App store single or mulitple user licencing I have two Macs, I haven't bought any software on the App store yet.\nIf I wanted to buy lets say for example Pages and Numbers, would I be able to install that on one Mac or two macs? just like I can if I download an app from the iTunes app store I can install on both iPad and iPhone for the single price?\nThanks\n\nA: You can install apps on \"any Mac you own or control\"\nhttp://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/us/terms.html\nAbout two thirds down the page\n\nIf you are an individual acting in your personal capacity, you may\n  download and use an application from the Mac App Store (“Mac App Store\n  Product”) for personal, non-commercial use on any Apple-branded\n  products running Mac OS X (“Mac Computer”) that you own or control.\n\n\nA: You can install software from the MAS on multiple Macs. The only limitation in the EULA is that the software either is used by one person on multiple computers, or by multiple users on a single computer. So installing for multiple users on different computers would be a breach of the EULA (even though technically still possible if both computers are linked to the same Apple ID for purchases).\nSee http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/us/terms.html\nEDIT: I'll have to ammend my answer even though it was already accepted. While the above is true for commercial use, for personal, non-commercial use in one and the same household on the other hand the above EULA restriction is not true.\n", "Q: Is there a way to navigate or filter Launchpad using type-selection? Launchpad quickly becomes a mess once you have many apps installed. Especially seeing the fact that stuff like 'Microsoft Silverlight' (which you most likely will never run manually, but runs as a plugin) hooks itself into the Launchpad as well.\nI have a couple of 'Crap' and 'Stuff' folders in which I store apps like these. Still, I'd like to navigate my Launchpad faster. When a person opens Launchpad, he/she usually knows what app he/she wants to start; it would be a lot easier if I'd be able to press the first character of this app, and Launchpad would automatically create a custom filtered screen for me.\nApparently, there is no such feature, but are there perhaps any plans to integrate this into OS X in a later stage? If not, are there any plugins that might be able to do this?\n\nA: I guess you can just forgo launchpad and try Alfred. It's navigated by keyboard anyway, so you can configure it to just show apps when you type something into the bar. Because, as you said, a user probably knows the app their searching for, theres not really a point to look at a grid of all the options in Launchpad, when you know you are only going to need one.\n\nA: If you navigate to your application by keyboard anyway, you can easily\n\n\n*\n\n*press Cmd-Space to activate Spotlight\n\n*start typing the name of the application\n\n*press Return as soon as Spotlight found the application\n\n\nYou may get a few false hits at the beginning but Spotlight learns about your Preferences quite fast. \n", "Q: Disable audible alarm on UPS I would like to add an APC brand of a UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply) device to a Mac only environment.  By default APC has a very loud heart attack invoking, babies crying in the night alarm to indicate power interruption. This audible alarm function can be disabled through a setting in their \"Powerchute\" power management software.  However the APC software seems to be Windows only.\nI understand that the Mac will see the UPS in System Preference in the Energy Saving pane for settings concerning saving and shutting down but not for disabling audible alarms.\nI've re-listened to a very good episode of The Typical Mac User Podcast about UPSs (ref.) http://typicalmacuser.com/wordpress/2010/07/20/tmup-212-a-ups-can-save-your-butt-with-george-starcher/ however I still cannot quite grasp the setup.  It seems one has to initiate the APC device on a Windows computer, disable the audible alarm, then the Mac will recognize this configuration.\nI don't want to make the investment if the audible alarm shut-off is not guaranteed. The closest current solution seems to to be an APC download \"PowerChute® Personal Edition for the Mac OS X operating system\" (ref.) http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/10324/apc-powerchute.  However the only current reviews were not favorable.\nHas anyone gone through this process?\n\nA: There is APC UPS Daemon can do exactly what you want:\n\nApcupsd can be used for power mangement and controlling most of APC's UPS models on Unix and Windows machines. Apcupsd works with most of APC's Smart-UPS models as well as most simple signalling models such a Back-UPS, and BackUPS-Office. During a power failure, apcupsd will inform the users about the power failure and that a shutdown may occur. If power is not restored, a system shutdown will follow when the battery is exhausted, a timeout (seconds) expires, or runtime expires based on internal APC calculations determined by power consumption rates. Apcupsd is licensed under the GPL version 2.\n\n\nA: I have a Back-UPS XS 1500 and the mute button on the front of the unit can be used to mute the unit. No PowerChute required. You simply hold the mute button down for two seconds and it will disable or re-enable all audible alarms emitted by the device. The unit beeps once to indicate audible alarms are no disabled.\nUn-muted, I get a short, fairly quiet, chirp out of the unit when battery kicks in and that's it. It doesn't beep continuously like my old Energizer UPS did.\n\nA: On a Mac, download APC UPS Daemon.\nIt’s not easy to use, but in the documentation, you will see that there is a software called apctest.\nOpen a terminal, type sudo apctest, you will have access to a configuration menu that allow you to change the alarm behavior.\nBefore running apctest, you may have to kill the apcupsd deamon. To do so: in a terminal, ps -A | grep apcupsd\nthen find the process with the apcupsd-start (let say it is 51)\nthen enter: sudo kill 51 (or whatever process id you end up with for apcupsd)\n\nA: I have tried UPSs with a mute button, but they have to be muted every time the power goes out.  When my power goes out, it often goes on and off several times before it finally stays on.  That means that it can wake me up several times at night and I have to get up to mute it every time before I can go back to sleep.  I finally switched from desktop to laptop computers at home because of their built-in battery.\n", "Q: Restored my iPhone from backup, now cannot recover purchased ringtone My iPhone 4 was playing a ringtone that I had purchased from iTunes.\nI updated my phone to the latest operating system, and in the process it said that it had to restore my phone from backup. \nNow:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can still see the purchased ringtone on my local machine when I view it in iTunes on my PC\n\n*I can drag the ringtone onto my phone icon\n\n*When browsing my phone contents from my PC I can see the ringtone\n\n\nBut...\n\n\n*\n\n*When I attempt to change the ringtone in the settings, my purchased ringtone does not appear!\n\n\nI've gone to the iTunes store to attempt to download it directly onto my iPhone. A message box comes up \"You have already purchased this ringtone. Do you wish to purchase it again?\".  Err, why should I have to?!?\nDoes anyone have any suggestions as to what to try?\n\nA: Have you tried removing it from your phone and adding it again (all via iTunes)? Can't think of anything else, and I don't think the iTunes in the cloud re-download everything for free applies to ringtones.\n\nA: I just had the same problem.  Log onto your iTunes account and under your iPhone click on the ringtone category.  Double click on your ring tones and it will ask if you want to delete from your phone.  Say yes and then go to the top of your iTunes menu and open the ringtone folder.  Click and drag the ringtone back to the ringtone folder under your iPhone and it will then add it back to your phone.\n\nA: In case someone experiences the same issue and lands here, I solved it by updating to the latest iOS 8.1.2 Apple had confirmed a bug with ringtones on iOS 8.1.1 and possibly earlier than that. \n", "Q: How do I compile and install a Cydia app?

There you can find the dictionary and you can edit however you want.\nNow I have a question for you, where will you find the complete dictionary of words? :)\n", "Q: Once iOS files are backed up to iCloud, can you access them programmatically? Is there a way to get the same files you can find in a local backup of an iPhone / iOS device from iCloud programmatically? \nIdeally, I would like to access them from a computer, but any access other than just restoring a backup onto an iOS device (and overwriting the current contents) as an intermediate step would be most welcome.\nFor example, it would be useful to be able to retrieve the contents of my iOS address book data every week. Yes, there are other API for address book syncing, but I'm looking for a general case where I could get into iCloud data apart from the official restore procedure.\n\nA: Apple's iCloud programming guide states:\n\nApps that use iCloud must be signed with iCloud-specific entitlements. These entitlements provide a level of security for your app by ensuring that only your apps can access the documents they create. \n\nSo I don't think it's possible to retrieve another app's data without compromising the application's private key, which should be safely stored on the application developer's computer. (And backups, hopefully)\n", "Q: DIY repaired iPhone won't boot fully - flashes Apple logo when powered via USB I recently tried to do a screen repair on an iPhone 4. \nIt won't boot fully, so I may have managed to break something else. Basically it wont turn on, and I only get a flashing Apple logo when plugged into a computer. I believe it could be the motherboard, although I have visually inspected it extensively to determine if i could have physically broken anything. I could not detect any fault. When I use the suspect motherboard on another iPhone frame I get the same problem.\n\nA: Get into DFU mode and do a restore in iTunes.\nFor DFU mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn the iPhone off (not needed in this case :)\n\n*Push the sleep button for 3 seconds (Apple logo should appear)\n\n*Push both buttons for 10 seconds (Apple logo should disappear)\n\n*Release the sleep/wake button and hold the home button for at least 15 seconds.\n\n\nNothing will show up on the screen, but if you connect it to iTunes it should recognise it. Then do a full restore.\nIf that doesn't work, you screwed something up inside, you might want to open it up again and re-check all connections.\n\nA: I had the same issue when a car ran over my partner's 3GS: I changed the broken screen and front glass and all it did was flash on and off with the Apple logo and get hot. \nMy solution was to re-check all connections, start iTunes on my laptop, plug in the phone, hold the power and home button for 15 seconds, and (eventually) it'll go into recovery mode (this took me about 6 tries).\n\nA: try to change the battery. it worked for me\n\nA: More than likely you ripped the battery terminals off the motherboard.  When connected to the computer it tries to boot but fails to detect a battery.  Look very carefully at where the plug attaches to the board.  You'll see one or several little brown patches where terminals for the plug to plug into were once attached.  Look at the battery plug.....that's where they now are.\n\nA: I attempted a battery replacement on my daughter's iPhone 4. After a bettery remove and replace (not the R&R we all hope for!) her phone did similar things as yours.\nCheck the connector on the main board your battery plugs into. Be really careful when you do this and don't remove the battery again if you don't need to. During the R&R, I managed to break the surface-mount solder joints and remove the main board side of the connector with the battery lead. I don't know if the connection was a pre-existing condition, or if my removal technique was sloppy or overly forceful.\nI rectified the condition by upgrading my 4s to a 5 and giving her my \"old\" phone. If you're eligable, now might be a good time to consider a carrier-subsidized upgrade. If you're not, look for a friend with a 4s who is eligible for an upgrade but hasn't exercised it yet. See if you can pay for their upgrade fee, getting them a new phone and you a $200 replacement.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I had the same problem when I did a screen repair if you replace the screw in the EXACT place you removed them from the phone will no work properly ie no wifi, not charging, no call ect I hope this helps you with your problem :) \n\nA: Have you tried DFU mode and restore via iTunes? DFU mode is turn off > home + sleep 10 seconds > release the sleep button, until a \"connect to iTunes\" appears.\n\nA: My iphone 4 is doing the same thing. My diagnosis came down to this... just like my iPhone 4, your iPhone is broken and need a hardware repair.\nI tried this DFU crap 4 times and got unknown error occurred (21) each time.\nFrom my experience, I'm pretty sure unknown error (21) is apple code for completely \"effed\".\n", "Q: How can I change the priority of number and symbol keys? I am a programmer and I use symbols more often than the number keys. I'd like to change the priority of the top row keys so that hitting \"1\" gives me \"!\", and holding shift and pressing \"1\" gives me \"1\".\nI'd prefer a built-in solution even if it requires more effort.\n\nA: To make the keyboard behave differently, you need a different keyboard layout.\nYou could create one by editing an XLM file manually, or you could use a third-party tool to create the keyboard layout (you don't need to be running a third-party program indefinitely once they layout is created and installed).\nUkelele is known for making it fairly easy to create new keyboard layouts for the Mac.\nIn any event, you want to switch the number keys (0-9) and the symbols attached to them. Save your new keyboard in ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts, and then select it as your keyboard.\n\nA: I have not tried this, but I think DoubleCommand might let you do this. And I'm pretty sure you could implement this with TextExpander. I don't think you would necessarily need to create a different keyboard layout as Daniel suggests.\n", "Q: Weird network issues with Lion I recently bought a MacBook Air with Lion. I have had many issues since, especially when connecting to the internet through \"open\" wifi networks that redirect you to a login page in the browser (i.e., where you need to authenticate in-browser, not through some WEP, WPA or 802.1X thing); what follows has occurred with at least two distinct such networks.\nHere's a list of the weird things that happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can only login to the network using Firefox; not with Safari or Chrome.\n\n*When using Safari or Chrome (after logging in to the network using Firefox), I can only visit fairly \"regular\" sites; most https services (Gmail, Facebook, ...) just won't load.\n\n*Most annoyingly (I could just switch to Firefox to \"solve\" the above issues), other apps such as Mail.app or Twitter won't work. Mail and Safari even freeze quite often (I need to kill them to quit), and Safari won't even load anymore after being killed - I need to restart the Mac to have it \"work\" again.\n\n\nMy system is quite new and \"clean\", although I did copy documents and settings from an older Snow Leopard MacBook. I tried creating a new user to override any non-default settings I might have been using, to no avail.\nAny ideas about what's going on?\n\nA: Make sure you don't have any network proxy settings - you might want to try creating a totally new 'location' in System Preferences -> Networks, select AirPort, click Advanced, then make sure that none of the Proxies are checked.\n", "Q: Why can't I  update to iOS 5 my iPod Touch 4th gen? I am trying to upgrade my 4th gen iPod touch to iOS 5.\nFirst I downloaded the IPSW file from iTunes.\nWhen I press shift + \"Restore\" button, I get the following error:\n\nThe iPod cannot be restored at this time because the iPod software update server could not be contacted or is temporarily unavailable.\n\nWhat can I do to prevent that? I have looked into the iPod update logs and see that I am getting error 1602 but don't know how to proceed.\n\nA: In general, you need to be connected to the internet to validate the install iOS packages with Apple's servers at the time of the restore. It is part of the install process that confirms to apple that your software has installed correctly and it generates the user license rather than asking you to enter a serial number for you allowing you to use the software.\nSpecifically for Error 1062 you need to remove iTunes and Apple Mobile device support from you applications. Then install the latest version of the software on your PC/Mac.\n\nA: In case you have Tiny Umbrella installed, make sure to untick \"Set Hosts to Cydia on Exit\" under the Advanced tab! If you did use it and don't have it anymore, open /etc/hosts and add a # in front of\n74.208.10.249  gs.apple.com\n\nso it reads\n#74.208.10.249  gs.apple.com\n\n\nA: The error message you see seems to be different from error 1602.

I'm looking for bluetooth keyboards for use with my iPhone. I'd like a full size keyboard that has a built in iPhone stand. Everything I've found so far with a built in stand is almost full size but not quite. Are there any full size keyboard options with built in iPhone stands? A case for the apple bluetooth keyboard that had a stand built in would also work but I haven't found one of these.\n\nA: For what it's worth, have you taken a look at the Apple iPad Keyboard Dock Wired Keyboard?\nIt doesn't have a number pad but otherwise is a full sized keyboard that shouldn't even need bluetooth.\nOf course I am assuming that it will work with an iPhone even though it was made for an iPad.\n\nA: The best solution I've found for this is the Wing Stand with an Apple bluetooth keyboard. while it isn't the most stable setup it works fine for setting the phone on a table along with the keyboard and typing.\n", "Q: Best tips in regard to calibrating a macbook pro screen My eyes hurt a lot since I have a macbook (current is antiglare 15 inch, last one was 13 inch).\nWhat's the best way to calibrate the screen (hardware calibrator, software, internal calibration)?\nOther best practices in regard to the topic?\n\nA: In my experience, with the exception of my first-gen fluorescent backlit plastic MacBook, which has never looked quite right, Apple displays ship with excellent default calibration.\nUnlike TVs which are optimized to maximize their brightness in already bright fluorescent-lit showrooms, Apple tends to ship their displays calibrated for rooms with normal levels of incandescent light.\nThat said, if you'd like to get into color calibration, try calibrating by eye first. Turn on the advanced settings for a load of controls. Just follow the instructions carefully.\n\nSystem Preferences > Displays > Color > Calibrate\n\nIf you have a good eye, aren't doing color sensitive work, and just want to get your display to \"look good\", this might be all you need. During the calibration, make sure the ambient (room) lighting matches what it will be while you're using the display normally.\nAlso, while doing the test, you might want to get some distance from the screen and squint a bit, especially for the tests that have you judging brightness levels.\nIf you need something more high end, you might want to look into something hardware based like these products: Pantone Huey, Colormunki, Datacolor Spyder.\nDepending on which of these you get, you'll be able to not only calibrate your display so that it displays color accurately, but also generate color profiles for proofing so you can simulate what your work will look like when printed on a specific printer, paper, inks etc.\n\nA: Screen calibration is usually done to a screen to match the properties of a printer, and the instructions are normally found in the printers manual.\nHowever as you say this is hurting your eyes you could invest in a huey which matches the pantone colours.  \nYou could also adjust the brightness before doing anything else as it could be too bright for your eyes.\n\nA: Like all displays Apple's are terribly uncalibrated out of the box. Way too much blue, which is a common issue with displays for two reasons. One, 9300K (cooler, bluer white) is the standard color temperature for Japanese television broadcasts (so Japanese manufacturers, who used to dominate the display market, built a lot of displays with 9300K default white point making it a de facto out-of-the-box standard). Two, a brighter display is more noticeable on the showroom floor, simply because it's more noticeable, so consumers believe bright displays are better and manufacturers indulge this belief. Since 9300K makes colors look brighter and more saturated, even though they are less accurately reproduced, manufacturers ship displays that default to that setting so when display models are put on retailer's shelves they appear as bright as possible next to the competition. Additionally, brightness is a number that can be printed on a spec sheet, and we all know that a larger number on a spec sheet is better irrespective of anything to do with reality.\nYou can maybe get it kind of OK by setting the color temperature to 6500K, using some test patterns, and if you want to go a little bit further get some color filters and use those to adjust tint, etc., with the appropriate patterns, although I'm not sure if those fine grained settings are available anymore like they were on good old CRT monitors.\nI would recommend just getting a calibration dongle. I have a Spyder3 Pro I got for under $100 after rebate a few years ago, and I'm really glad I did, totally great purchase. I'm a programmer, so I don't need a calibrated display for my work, but everything looks so much better and more comfortable to view. You can use it with all your computers and monitors basically forever (at least until the manufacturer drops support for some future OS), and it's pretty much a one-time thing you do after an OS install or monitor change.\nAs a general aside, if you are getting eyestrain you may just need to turn down the brightness. Getting it properly calibrated will help, as you'll be able to see fine detail that was previously blown out and thus won't need it cranked up so much, but unless you turn the brightness down it'll be dumping the same amount of light into your eyeballs.\n", "Q: How can I exit \"bash\"? I don't know how to get my .profile aliases back in to the terminal every time I try them, this error massage comes up:\napaw:~ apaw$ cdp\n-bash: cdp: command not found\n\nHow do i exit this -bash? I strongly believe it was named different while it still worked.\n\nA: I'm not sure I understand your question.  \nThe -bash: prefix you see is simply bash's way of identifying itself as the source of the error message. In this case you entered cdp which is neither an external nor internal shell command nor was it defined as an alias or function.\nWhile in a (bash) terminal, you can simply type exit to leave the terminal and close the shell session.\nThe aliases in your .profile are read when you start a new terminal or shell session, or if you source the files: e.g. source ~/.profile.  That should re-read your .profile and load any changed aliases.\n\nA: Okay, I've found out what the problem was, some script has created a .bash_profile file that was overriding my .profile file, now I've removed the .bash_profile file and it works again!\n", "Q: How to upload the full-resolution pictures taken by Instagram to Flickr? When Instagram takes a pictures, it send a lower resolution version to Flickr, but saves the full resolution in the Camera Roll. Right now, I am:\n\n\n*\n\n*Taking picture and letting Instagram send the lower resolution version to Flickr, so something is available online right away.\n\n*Later on, transfer the pictures to my Mac (through iCloud or sync), and replace one by one the pictures on Flickr with the full resolution version I have locally. \n\n\nThis last step is time consuming and error prone. Ideally, I'd like Instagram to upload the full resolution picture for me when over wifi. But short of that, what would you do to streamline this process? Maybe \"there is an app for that\"?\nAs a side-note, you might wonder why I am using Instagram, and not taking pictures with the Camera app or the Flickr app:\n\n\n*\n\n*I like to enter a title right away, just after taking the picture (so the Camera app wouldn't cut it).\n\n*I like the fact that the version of the picture sent right away is lower resolution, not to kill my limited mobile quota (so the Flickr app wouldn't cut it).\n\n*(I also like the square format: IMHO, it makes framing simpler, and creates pictures that just looks better for online viewing.)\n\nA: I use the Posterous Spaces app to save full resolution photos from the roll to the web and have that linked to push to flickr. You could also use the native flickr app to pick them from the roll.\n\nA: I used PicBackMan's migrate tool to move all my Instagram Pictures to Flickr account.All I did was, associated Instagram & Flickr accounts in the desktop application and it went through like a breeze.\nI highly recommend it.\n", "Q: What is the iPod touch's screen sensitive to? I know that tapping on the screen with an object doesn't cause any reaction in the user interface (e.g. it doesn't cause a click of a button shown from an application). To what is the iPod's screen sensitive, and what can I use to replace my fingers?\nThe problem I am trying to resolve is that, using my finger to play a game, I don't see part of the screen, and my finger hits something that causes the game to end (you know, those little bombs that are launched in the play field when you are trying to slice fruits).\n\nA: Sausages work very well! (not kidding)\n\nA: Something conductive and either soft or flat will register with the capacitive touch screen sensors.  A ball of conductive foam or wadded up aluminum foil, or even a half inch strip of the metallic insides of a power bar wrapper.\nThere are several manufacturers of iPhone stylus's that use variations of the above.  You can google them.\nNon-conductive stuff won't work.  And anything too pointy will also have problems being recognized, as there won't be sufficient electrical field coupling.\n\nA: All answers thus far are somewhat inaccurate or vague. A more detailed answer:\nApple's touchscreen devices and trackpads use capacitive touchscreen sensing. This technology measures capacitance on a grid of points. When a capacitance within a certain threshold of human skin is met, the software reacts to the touch input detected in those points on the screen.\nThis is opposed to, for example, resistive touch screens, which are generally used in older or lower-end electronics. These have a slight squishy feel on the surface, and are much less responsive than capacitive screens, but work with any object as a stylus. This works by having two films of conductive grid lines. When an object causes a depression in the surface which pushes the two layers together, the point of contact can be measured by comparing the resistance of the various grid's lines.\nHaving made this distinction, any object used to interact with a capacitive touch panel must have a similar capacitance to that of skin. Things such as meat would work (sausages were suggested), but aren't very practical. However, styluses made to work specifically with these screens can easily be found online. Those might be the perfect solution for you, since they're like a long thin pen used for the touch screen that doesn't obscure your view as much as fat thumbs might.\n\nA: Anything that generates an electric field. Your finger generates an electric field, so it generates a \"click\" on the screen. Here is a good article on the iPhone's touchscreen.\n\nA: From Wikipedia: \"A stylus designed for resistive touchscreens will not register on capacitive sensors. Styluses that work on capacitive touchscreens primarily designed for fingers are required to simulate the difference in dielectric offered by a human digit.[11]\"\nhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitive_touchscreen#Capacitive\nFor those interested, here's a DIY stylus for Iphone 5: https://snapguide.com/guides/make-a-simple-iphone-stylus/\n", "Q: Photo Stream & iCloud turned on - but Photos taken on iPhone don't appear on iPad I have iOS 5 on my iPhone and have iCloud set up.

I went to my iCloud settings (Storage & Backup to make sure that iCloud backup was on. (It was.) I hit “back up now”.     Only the 10 or so pictures I took that morning with my iPhone appear on my iPad now. I took some more photos and checked it several hours later, and the new ones do not appear on my iPad.\nWhat am I missing? The way I understand it, I shouldn’t have to do anything to get iPhone pics to appear, as long as I have iCloud enabled on both and Photo Stream enabled? \nI suppose there is no way to get older iPhone photos (taken a few weeks ago) to appear on my Photo Stream? At this point, I’d just be happy if I could get it to stream the ones that I’ve taken since I got iOS 5 & iCloud.\n\nA: Photo Stream definitively only works for photos (or screenshots) taken after it was enabled.\nAs for your other problem: Yes, if you are logged into the same iCloud account on both devices and have Photo Stream enabled it should sync whenever you are logged in into a Wi-Fi environment (apparently Photo Stream doesn't sync over 3G).\nWhat else can you try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a screenshot on the iPad, make sure you are in a Wi-Fi environment and see whether the screenshot appears on the iPhone\n\n*Log in to iCloud from your computer (requires Lion or a recent Windows version of course) and see whether the photos get streamed there\n\n", "Q: Making MacPorts Think A Dependency Is Already Installed I like to install some packages by hand that are also available through MacPorts.

Programs can also spawn other programs and communicate with them via process-level I/O techniques like pipes or file handles, etc. But from the OS' perspective these sub-programs are still just collections of threads. It doesn't really matter if the program is spawning multiple threads or if it's spawning sub-processes -- both approaches represent OS-level threads that the OS  will attempt to schedule and execute as efficiently as possible and possibly in parallel.\nIf you have multiple cores and a program's threads aren't being explicitly locked to a core, then the OS can try run them at the same time, in parallel, across all the cores it has available to it in the current machine. If you have multiple programs running, the OS will schedule all those underlying threads across all the cores it has available to it in the current machine.\nPractically speaking there's some amount of I/O, inter-process or inter-thread communication and synchronization that needs to occur and this can cause OS-level threads to block and keep things from running truly parallel all the time. For example: two threads in a multi-threaded program might be pulling values off a shared stack to do some work, so access to the stack has to be co-ordinated to ensure everything is thread safe and that means only one thread can pop from the stack data structure at time. There's a bottleneck in the program's design that's limiting thread parallelism to one here and the OS can't help with that.\nThe same is true for programs that spawn sub-processes. There may be I/O or inter-process synchronization issues that prevent all spawned sub-processes from truly running in parallel all the time.\n\nA: If the application itself is not multithreaded then it will stay to a single core.  If you have a number of single threaded applications that are running it's reasonable to assume OS X will distribute them between he cores appropriately.\n", "Q: Downgrading to iOS 4 on my iPod Touch from iOS 5 I installed iOS 5 on my iPod Touch 3rd Generation, but it slows everything down. I want to put it back to iOS 4. How can I do this?\n\nA: Redmond pie have a good walkthrough on how to do this.\nDue to the security checks that Apple has implemented over the years, it’s just not possible to install an old version of iOS once a new version is out to public on a device without a workaround. In order for this to work, you must have previously backed up SHSH blobs for the version of iOS you’re trying to downgrade to. If you’re still on an old version of iOS, we recommend you run a tool such as iFaith before you upgrade in order to back-up your blobs.\nOnce you’re sure you have what you need just follow the easy steps below.\nStep 1: If you haven’t already, download the version of the iOS firmware you’re planning to downgrade to, which should be in the form of an IPSW file. For your convenience, we have placed the relevant download links below:\niOS 4.3.5\niOS 4.3.4\niOS 4.3.3\nStep 2: Put your device into DFU mode – this will allow you to make some necessary changes in order to downgrade the system. In order to do this, turn your device completely off, press and hold the Power and Home buttons (simultaneously) for 10 seconds, then release the Power button but keep holding the Home button for 10 more seconds. If you’ve entered DFU mode successfully, your screen should now be blank (it shouldn’t display the iTunes logo), otherwise just repeat this step. It might take several tries to get it right.\nStep 3: We now must trick iTunes into accepting an old firmware by preventing it from connecting to Apple’s servers. In order to do this, launch Explorer (on Windows) or Finder (on OS X) and navigate to \\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\ on Windows and /etc/ on the Mac. Locate a file named hosts and open it with your favorite text editor. Remember that you’re advised to back it up before making any changes.\n\n\nAdd the following line to the hosts file and save it, as shown below:\n74.208.105.171 gs.apple.com\n\nStep 4: Launch iTunes, select your device from the program’s sidebar and restore your device to the old firmware you’ve selected earlier. In order to do this, hold the Alt key (if you’re using OS X) or Shift (if you’re on Windows) on your keyboard, press the \"Restore\" button on iTunes and navigate to the desired firmware file.\n\nNote: You might get a 1013 error during this process, which is entirely normal, throwing your device into recovery mode.\n\n\nIn order to get out of this, download TinyUmbrella (Windows, Mac) or Fix Recovery (Windows, Mac). From either one of them, select \"Exit Recovery\" to go back to normal mode.\n\nYou’re done!\n\nA: clean & simple, works under Windows and Mac OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download ipsw firmware you need\n\n*Enter your iPhone into DFU mode\n\n*open iTunes and click \"update\" with alt pressed\n\n*then choose your ipsw and install it.\n\n", "Q: Can I re-download an audiobook that I purchased from iTunes again? Apps purchased from the app store and songs purchased from iTunes can be downloaded again by going to the purchased section in the respective app and clicking the cloud button.\nNeither app shows the audio-books I have purchased and when I look at a specific book I have already purchased in the iTunes store it shows the buy button.\nWill I get charged again if I click the buy button or will it just re-download it?\n\nA: Most of these older answers are incorrect now. In recent versions of iOS you can re-download all your audiobooks purchased through iTunes by starting the iBooks app, and going to the Purchased tab at the bottom right. From there you can choose what to redownload from My Purchases.\n\n\nA: Google shows various links that say that it is not possible to automatically re-download Audio Books in iTunes. \nFor example, this recent one - previously purchased audiobooks not showing up -  from 3-Nov-2011: \n\nYou only get one download of audiobooks and movies.

Then go to the Book store ans navigate to purchased, rather than searching for the book. \nIf it is in this list you will be able to download it again, If it is not in the list, you may be out of luck.\n\nA: Audio books purchased through iTunes on any Mac or iOS devices cannot be redownloaded via iCloud because of, based on my understanding, licensing with Audible which is where all of the audio books on iTunes come from. Apple will regrant you the download if you somehow lost it, but in the future, if you often get audio books through iTunes, you may want to sync your iOS devices with your computer just for audio book purposes and make sure to use Time Machine or other methods to back up your computer. Movies, TV shows, apps, music, and books purchased from iBooks will redownload through iCloud - but not audio books or ring tones.\n\nA: Depends on where you got your audio books there are different ways to Sync Audiobooks in the Cloud. http://www.ifunia.com/blog/how-to-sync-audiobooks-in-the-cloud/\n", "Q: MD5 checksum on multiple file? I have files like this.\nmd1.gz\nmd1.gz.md5\nmd2.gz\nmd2.gz.md5\n....\nmd300.gz\nmd300.gz.md\n\nIs there any application (or command line) to check the md5 of all files ?\nEDIT: Currently I use cfv from macport. work great without any modification\n\nA: The md5 command will check multiple files for you. Simply list all the files you want after the command. I.e. md5 md1.gz md2.gz md3.gz. It will output the md5 hashes like so:\nMD5 (md1.gz) = 1c2c02b085a1bc2fed683eca86c0df02\nMD5 (md1.gz) = c5515451d8f90a822457a4a8e4bf1791\n\nIf you want just the hashes, use the -q flag, it will print only the hash, without the identifying information.\nI'm guessing that you want to compare the hash of the files against that in the corresponding .md5 file. You could write a quick shell script to check each generated hash against the one stored in the .md5 file.\nSomething like this should work:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor file in \"$@\"; do\n  generatedhash=$(md5 -q \"$file\")\n  storedhash=$(< \"$file\".md5)\n  if [[ $generatedhash != $storedhash ]]; then\n    echo \"Hash for file '$file 'does not match\"\n  fi\ndone\n\nSave that to a text file, call it something like checkmd5.sh and do chmod +x checkmd5.sh in the terminal.\nIt will print out a warning for all files that don't have a matching hash. It prints nothing if the hashes do match. It's quick and dirty, so apologies if it doesn't work for your particular case. But based on the examples you gave, if you run ./checkmd5.sh md*.gz it should check the hashes of the .gz files against the corresponding .md5 files and tell you if any are bad.\n\nA: md5deep is a great cross platform tool to generate and check md5/sha hashes.\nWhile it's easy to replicate the recursive hash generation feature in a few lines of shell code, it's not so easy to do that for its hash matching feature.\nhttp://md5deep.sourceforge.net/start-md5deep.html#install\n\nA: Maybe my own product will help you.\nfHash https://github.com/sunjw/fhash\nAn open source files' hash calculator for Windows and Mac OS X.\n\n\n*\n\n*MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and CRC32.\n\n*Drag & drop.\n\n*Integrated with context menu in Explorer/Finder.\n\n*Support multiple files.\n\n\nA: If want to use a gui, you can try with ff_md5drop\n", "Q: Devs, can 3rd party apps access Safari's Reading List?

(Part of the screen is missing) I use the latest model of iMac 27 inch and output to an Samsung 40 inch HDTV, and found that the Menu Bar is missing on the HDTV.   This is usually known as the \"overscan\" issue, that the top 10 or 15 lines are missing (and so are the bottom, left, and right) -- this is because in the old days, there are some signals for TV info piggy-backed in the TV signal (usually at the bottom) and the TV won't want to display it, so the top, left, right, bottom 10 or 15 lines are cut off.\nThis isn't a problem with a Dell Studio 15 Notebook: the notebook computer output HDMI directly, and 100%, every single pixel is visible on the HDTV.\nAlso, I tried both a generic Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable (from Monoprice), as well as an expensive, Belkin cable sold at the Apple Store -- they are the same.\nAlso, this issue happens no matter I choose the \"Mirror Mode\" or the \"Individual Display Mode\" on the iMac -- in either case, the 10 or 15 lines are missing at the top, bottom, left, and right.\nIs there a way to solve this?  To make it work like the Dell notebook? (either by hardware, software, or settings?)\nUpdate: a better solution I found later on was to change the HDTV to not overscan at all, if that's possible.  More details in:  How to solve the \"overscan\" issue if the iMac is connected to an HDTV and using BootCamp and Windows 7?  That solution is to set the TV not to overscan at all.  For example, the setting of 16:9 or 4:3 may both overscan, but the setting of \"Just Scan\" will not overscan at all.\n\nA: I had this same issue and spent ages trying everything to correct it. Turned out it was just the zoom option in the picture settings of my TV menu. It was set to \"Auto\" and after changing to \"Full\" I now have my external display set up perfectly :) I guess the moral of this is to try the simple solutions first!\nEdit - There was a few other options in this menu that helped improve the overall quality also, such as turning \"HDMI true black\" ON\n\nA: There should be an \"Underscan\" adjustment in display preferences. Open up the Displays in System Preferences. Have a look at your available resolutions.

How can I figure out which Apple ID to use for purchasing and not end up with more confusion with @mac.com @me.com and @icloud.com email aliases that all belong to one iCloud account?\n\n(I apoligize for dropping a bit of a mess here, but the back story is how I got here and hopefully has details to help solve my dilemma.)\nI have never really understood the handling of usernames and passwords for iTunes, MobileMe and the app support web site and now with the introduction of iCloud, I sink to another deeper level of confusion. Please bear with me as I described my scenario:\nI restored a backup of my older iPhone to a new iPhone 4s and it won't accept my password to get into the App Store to update apps.\nI think when I first set up the new 4s I might have accidentally given it a version of my username (using pito@mobileme.com when it really was pito@mac.com or something like that.) I think it went and set up a new iCloud account for me. Guessing this I deleted the new iCloud account and was able to get the iPhone to properly log in on my previous iCloud/MobileMe account, pito@mac.com. Anyway, somewhere along the line things got confused.\nHere's where things stand afaik:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can sync with iCloud on my computer and iPhone and they are all talking to the same account\n\n*I see my email, my calendar, my address book and all seems correct\n\n*I can get into the iTunes store on my computer (with the pito@mac.com and the password)\n\n\nHowever!!\n\n\n*\n\n*on the iPhone it refuses to accept my the same password when entering the app store. (Not 100% sure what user  name is used in that particular instance.)\n\n*AND on the Mac, going into the App Store (NOT the iTunes store) I was able to log into that account, but it appeared to have started a new account because the apps that I have bought in the past don't appear. In other words it looks like I have a second APP STORE account.\n\n\nSo we end up with the question at the top of this post - How can I sort out confusion between Apple ID and passwords?\n\nA: The iPhone maintains two separate Apple IDs: one for iCloud, and one for the iTunes Store. These may or may not be the same, and they are set in two separate places.\nTo view and set the Store account, open Settings and scroll down to Store. Beneath the settings for Automatic Downloads, it should show the Apple ID you're currently using on the phone for the Store, e.g.:\nApple ID: pito@mac.com\nTap that, and a dialog will pop up offering three options: View Apple ID, Sign Out, and iForgot (the last is for retrieving a forgotten password).\nIf the Apple ID displayed there is not what you expect, select Sign Out, and you will be able to sign into the Store with a different Apple ID. Note that this will not affect your iCloud settings, which are managed separately through Settings > iCloud.\nGive this a try, and if you are still having troubles, feel free to update your question.\nFurther note: it sounds like you have inadvertently set up a new Apple ID instead of using an existing one. To identify which Apple IDs are associated with your account, check out My Apple ID. The Manage Your Account and \"Not sure if you have an ID? Find out\" links should help you get a handle on the situation.\nUpdate: Regarding your comment about the App Stores, there's definitely confusion to be had here: The \"App Store\" on iOS is part of the iTunes Store - it's the same content that you see when you open iTunes, go to the Store, and browse to Apps, and it uses the same iTunes Account. The Mac App Store, accessed by clicking the App Store icon in your Dock (or under the Apple menu) in OS X is a separate content store containing only OS X apps. That said, it also authenticates using an iTunes Store account, typically the same one you'll use in iTunes.\nAs of today, the easiest way I've found to think about this - and the way I've configured my own accounts - is: \nAn Apple ID for buying things, which you'll use to authenticate in:\n\n\n*\n\n*The iTunes Store\n\n*The App Store on iOS\n\n*The Mac App Store on OS X\n\n\nAnd one for syncing things, which you'll use to authenticate in:\n\n\n*\n\n*The iCloud settings on iOS\n\n*The iCloud preference pane on OS X\n\n*The iCloud website\n\n\nThe thing to note about the above is that you can use the same Apple ID for both sets of tasks, but, depending on what you want to accomplish, knowing where to enter each ID is important.\n", "Q: How do I get my firmware version prior to running jailbreak on a new 3GS? I want to jailbreak my new iPhone 3GS, but I need to find out what firmware it has before downloading the jailbreak software. I can't get past the emergency call only page, and I can't read it with iTunes because I am using an illegal carrier, so not valid Sim as far as Apple is concerned.\n\nA: Recent versions of redsn0w auto-detect the version of iOS running on the connected device, so you can usually just jailbreak it without having to manually figure out the iOS version first. You can always get the latest version of redsn0w from the Dev Team Blog: http://blog.iphone-dev.org/tagged/redsn0w\nJailbreaking with redsn0w also \"hacktivates\" (unofficially activates) unactivated iPhones (although not the iPhone 4S yet), which is convenient for these kinds of situations. Some things don't work on hacktivated iPhones (push notifications, iMessage, FaceTime), and the battery may drain more than usual, but it's fine for a temporary solution when no official SIM cards are available.\n\nA: If you know someone else who has an activated SIM on the correct carrier (AT&T if you're in the US), you can put that into your phone and then plug it in to iTunes to do a soft activation on the phone. This will get you past the emergency call screen.\nWhen you plug it into iTunes, you'll need to be connected to the Internet. iTunes will \"phone home\" really quick and then you should see it ask for registration, etc. in iTunes. You'll get a popup on the phone that it's been activated and then you can go to Settings > General and check the version or check it through iTunes.\nAfter you've activated the phone, you can remove the borrowed SIM without deactivating it again. The phone will just show \"No Service\" at the top.\n", "Q: Is a partial restore from an Address Book .abbu file possible? I have an old Address Book .abbu archive that has some contact data that I need to recover. I do not want to restore the entire address book archive, and I especially do not want to overwrite my current address book.\nBut...  It seems like the only way to access an .abbu file is to entirely replace the current address book in a full restore.\nIs there any way to browse and selectively access contacts in an address book archive?\nThanks!\n\nA: You can\n\n\n*\n\n*store the contents of your current Address Book in an archive (.abbu)\n\n*restore the contents of the old file. \n\n*purge the entries you don't want to keep\n\n*export the remaining ones\n\n*the current archive file (created in step 1)\n\n*import the file from step 4\n\n", "Q: Are there any “sugars” for Espresso which add brace/bracket highlighting to JavaScript editing? By “brace/bracket highlighting” I mean: when you select an opening or closing curly brace or a bracket while editing JavaScript in Espresso, the brace/bracket you’ve selected and its corresponding closing brace/bracket is highlighted with some visual cue (bold, background colour, anything).\nIf not, would it be possible to develop such a sugar?\n\nA: As far as I can see, there is not. Developing such a Sugar might not be possible from my (very limited) understanding of the Espresso plugin documentation – JavaScript text Actions look like the best match, but the API does not seem to offer the kind of access needed for automatic highlighting. Note I haven’t delved into the ObjectiveC plugin docs (because there are none – the headers included with Espresso are the docs, and my understanding of ObjectiveC and Cocoa is slim, to say the least).\n", "Q: Are there any \"App Store quality\" apps for creating animated GIFs from a series of image files? I searched the App Store for \"animated GIF\" but the only returned app was one to convert a movie file into an animated GIF. I need to go the other way: I have a series of screenshots taken of an app that I'm a beta tester for. These are the standard PNG files created by OS X's ⌘+⇧+4 keyboard shortcut. They show the sequence of events I use to reproduce a display bug.\nWhen I say \"App Store quality\" I mean they are native Cocoa apps. These apps generally have attention paid to user interface and usability. You know, all the things that make good Mac apps good.\n\nA: I'd like to revive this question in the hopes of generating a more complete list of the available options which are either Mac apps or command-line tools (not websites).\nThese are the ones I am aware of.\n\n\n*\n\n*GIFQuickMaker [App, no longer free, very simple, but works and creates small images]\n\n*Pixen [App, also no longer free]\n\n*Gifsicle: Command-Line Animated GIFs [Terminal based, available via brew]\n\n*ImageMagick: Convert, Edit, Or Compose Bitmap Images  [specifically the convert program. Terminal based, available via brew]\n(I've marked this answer as a community wiki in the hopes that others will add to it)\n\nA: You could try GraphicConverter  X\nI last used GraphicConverter to make animated GIF files probably 10 years ago. But it worked fine back then and had plenty of options.\nHere's some instructions, although these may be for an older version and may need to be adjusted slightly for the latest version:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Draw your animation cells in a graphics program.\n  \n*Copy the first animation cell and start GraphicConverter.\n  \n*From the Edit menu do \"new picture with clipboard\". This will create a graphic the exact size as the cell in the paste buffer. This\n  will be your first frame.\n  \n*Copy another animation cell.\n  \n*From the Picture menu in GraphicConverter do \"Show movie options\". It will ask you if you want to convert your document to an animation\n  GIF, click \"Convert\"\n  \n*From your movie options window click \"Insert Frame\" button. It will insert the cell you have in your paste buffer into the frame.\n  Continue copying cells and inserting frames until your animation is\n  complete. If you want to make it an endless loop then you can click\n  that box in the movie options.\n  \n*Set the delay between frames in the top of the movie options box. Experiment with this, you can change this when ever you want. The\n  larger the number the longer each frame is displayed.\n  \n*Save your work.\n\n\nA: You could do far worse than to buy GifBrewery. \n\n\n*\n\n*GIF Brewery - http://helloresolven.com/portfolio/gifbrewery/\nIt's a finely crafted tool that really makes professional work of animating gifs. Think of it as iMovie for GIFs. Polished, reliable and full of tools to control the process as opposed to just stacking 8 images together in one animation (take it or leave it style).\n\nA: You might install ImageMagick with brew install imagemagick and then use something like this:\nconvert -delay 4 *.png output.gif\n\n-delay 4 sets the delay between frames to 0.04 s.\nSee http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/anim_basics/ for more information.\n\nA: The app GIFQuickMaker ($1.99) describes itself as: \n\nDescription\n  GIF, TIFF, BMP, PNG, JPEG and GIF image transmission\n  combination and GIF animations can be created.\n\n\nA: As far as high-quality apps in the app store that can produce animated GIFs, there's always Photoshop Elements. It's not cheap, but it's the consumer version of the industry standard for photo manipulation.\n\nA: Don't know if you've heard about this one yet: Look for GIFfun.app \nI do something similar to what you want -- grab several screen shots and drag-n-drop them onto GIFfun.app and it makes them into an animated GIF.  It works great.  If it weren't free I'd'a paid money for it.\n\nA: You can directly convert a video to an animated gif with gifify.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Install homebrew\n\n*Install node: brew install node\n\n*Install/re-install ffmpeg:\n\nbrew uninstall --ignore-dependencies --force ffmpeg\nbrew install ffmpeg --with-libass --with-fontconfig\n\n\n*Install/reinstall imagemagick:\nbrew uninstall --ignore-dependencies imagemagick\nbrew install imagemagick --with-fontconfig\n\n\n*Install gifify:\nnpm install -g gifify\n\nOnce all dependencies are installed the conversion can be done with:\ngifify clip.mp4 -o clip.gif\n\nYou can also set a start and end position in the video and add a text caption:\ngifify clip.mp4 -o clip.gif --from 01:48:23.200 --to 01:48:25.300 --text 'nip!'\n\n❗️ It can take several minutes for the conversion to complete even with smaller videos.\n\nNOTE: Most likely previously installed versions of ffmpeg and imagemagick will need to be removed and reinstalled with the required extra libraries (i.e. libass and fontconfig).\n\n\nA: Gimp can do it very easily.  Here are clear instructions:\nhttp://www.techpraveen.com/2011/01/how-to-make-animated-gif-picture-in-gimp.html\n", "Q: OS X computer name not matching what shows on terminal My computer name in System Preferences > Sharing is set to \"archos\", but is showing as \"iphone\" on Terminal.

Hoover's tip (above),\nI would add these last two steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Flush the DNS cache by typing:\ndscacheutil -flushcache\n\n*Restart your Mac.\n\n\nA: There are some helpful comments below this answer that you might want to read first.\nGo to System Preferences -> Sharing and update your Computer Name.\nThen in Terminal, you can view settings via:\nsudo scutil --get ComputerName\nsudo scutil --get LocalHostName\nsudo scutil --get HostName\n\nYou can also change the values using the scutil command:\nsudo scutil --set ComputerName \"newname\"\nsudo scutil --set LocalHostName \"newname\"\nsudo scutil --set HostName \"newname\"\n\n\nA: I agree that Jeffrey Hoover's tip was the correct answer. Flushing the DNS cache and restarting the Mac is a nice step too. This is variant of Jeff Hoover's reply:\nsudo -i\nPassword:\n\nfor n in HostName ComputerName LocalHostName; do\n    scutil --set $n new_hostname\ndone\n\nexit\n\n\nA: System Preferences -> Sharing -> Computer Name --> set it to whatever\nAnd then restart your computer. No console commands were necessary. Works for OS X 10.10.2\n\nA: I had the problem that only the shell itself (zsh in my case) failed to show the correct computer name. Simply restarting the shell solved it:\nexec /bin/zsh\n\n\nA: Use this\nsudo systemsetup -setcomputername $name\n\n\nA: As mentioned in a separate answer, another option is to override the default PS1 prompt, like executing the following line (or adding it to your ~/.bash_profile file):\n $ PS1=\"$(scutil --get ComputerName):\\W \\u\\\\$ \"\n\nrefs:\nhttps://superuser.com/a/414903/39364\nhttp://www.cnet.com/news/keep-your-command-prompt-host-name-static-in-os-x-and-other-unix-systems/\n\nA: In addition to the previous answer, remember that you can use a static address in your router. You have to enter the static IP and the MAC address of your network card, then you set a name for it. The hostname will be automagically updated to the specified name. That's it.\n\nA: There are two potential reasons for the shell ($HOSTNAME variable, '\\h' in $PS1) and the hostname utility to report a hostname that differs from the one shown in System Preferences > Sharing:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo scutil --set HostName newName was used to persistently change the hostname - unfortunately, this value is independent of the LocalHostName value set by System Preferences behind the scenes - even though man hostname suggests this method, DO NOT USE IT for that reason; run sudo scutil --set HostName '' to remove it, at which point LocalHostName should again be reported; for background, see this post by @Lauri Ranta.\n\n*[Update: The following is no longer true as of OSX 10.10] If your /etc/hosts file has an entry that matches your machine's IP address, that entry's name will be reported.\nOnly if neither of the above is true will the shell and hostname reflect the value set via System Preferences.\n\nIf you want to change your hostname from the shell, run both of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo scutil --set LocalHostName <newName>\n\n*sudo scutil --set ComputerName <newFriendlyName>\nwhere <newFriendlyName> can be a friendlier version (spaces, punctuation) of <newName> (alphanumerics and dashes only).\n\nA: It's perfectly normal for this to occur; when you login Terminal remotely bash does a reverse DNS lookup. It will only be the same if the hostname is not specified on the network you're connecting from and there is no reply from the DHCP server, or the reverse lookup against the remote DNS server fails to resolve.\nYou can easily over-ride the default setting by using this command in Terminal:\nsudo scutil --set HostName archos\n\nYou can check it by using:\nnslookup nn.nn.nn.nn\n\n( or )\nhost nn.nn.nn.nn\n\n(where nn signifies your Mac's ip address)\n", "Q: Compatible SSD for Macbook Pro (replace HDD)? Any special compatibility concerns when replacing the HDD on a MBP with an SSD? I am running Parallels with XP Pro and Ubuntu and have been disk bound for some time. Not too concerned about size, 100GB is probably enough. Hoping to get the absolute fastest IO I can with reliability being a close second. Below are specs in case they are needed.\nHardware Overview:\n  Model Name:   MacBook Pro\n  Model Identifier: MacBookPro5,4\n  Processor Name:   Intel Core 2 Duo\n  Processor Speed:  2.53 GHz\n  Number Of Processors: 1\n  Total Number Of Cores:    2\n  L2 Cache: 3 MB\n  Memory:   4 GB\n  Bus Speed:    1.07 GHz\n  Boot ROM Version: MBP53.00AC.B03\n  SMC Version (system): 1.49f2\n\nHelp me oh wise ones. Thanks ahead of time!\n\nA: I don't think there is compatibility concerns, SSDs are pretty safe nowadays. Your model has SATAII, therefore the best SSD you can get is the Mercury Extreme Pro 3G from OWC (macsales.com). You can get a 115 Gb for roughly 200$, and your experience with your MB Pro will improve considerably.\nI would not choose a smaller capacity though, as all SSDs with a capacity below 110/120 Gb are much slower, no idea why. And OWC's are the absolute best around, with a 3-year warranty.\nNot only that, SSDs require a firmware upgrade from time to time, and OWC is the only company with a native Mac OS X updater. Much better experience in my opinion.\nEnjoy the speed! :-)\n", "Q: How can I change default X11 application? I compiled my own X11 Server for Mac OS X and want it to replace the original outdated X11.app supplied by Lion. How do I do that?\n\nA: *\n\n*cd to /usr/X11/bin \n\n*rename the existing X symlink to Xquartz (to X_orig for example) in case you need to revert in the future to the \"vanilla\" config\n\n*symlink X to your compiled binary.\n\n\nA: The XQuartz install docs have an alternate approach for installing their X11 binary. They use launchctl and set the DISPLAY to point to the socket for their server. I believe the program it runs (launchd_startx) listens on the socket and starts the X server when a connection is made. The nice thing about this approach is it leaves the original X11.app unmodified.\n", "Q: How can I delete an apple account? I have an old account that I don't use.

I'm running 10.6.8 and wondering where my Mac stores my install history -- I'm thinking everything from Ruby gems to full blown web apps. Does such a general file exist?\n\nA: Look in /var/log for install.log and install.log.[something].bz2.  install.log contains the most current logs; the other files are archives of successively older log files, made whenever each one reached a maximum size.\n", "Q: How can I see bandwidth usage on a Mac? I am having internet problems and the ISP technicians suggested that something is using my bandwidth. \nIs there a software to monitor which processes use how much bandwidth?\n\nA: Perhaps Little Snitch might fit your needs.  It's a paid app though, so you can try it out using it's trial version.\n\nA: First, most ISPs can tell you how much bandwidth you're using.  It sounds like you had a technician that either didn't know much or was just trying to shoo you away.\nSecond, the only way to steal bandwidth is if you have a wireless network that isn't properly secured.  This means you'll need to monitor bandwidth from your wireless router, not your laptop/desktop.\nIf you do have a wireless router, I would just change the SSID and secure it with a new (hard to guess) password.  That will immediately cut-off anyone that could be leaching off your network.  It's very simple to do compared to trying to monitor your bandwidth usage.\n\nA: If you're looking for a way to monitor your Internet usage as a whole, including all devices connected to it, you might want to check out PeakHour (Mac Appstore). \nIt uses SNMP or UPnP to talk to routers and computers that can given you a real-time and historical view of bandwidth consumption and activity. This lets you monitor usage of your Internet connection as a whole, not just the computer you're on - useful if you have a few devices on your network.\nKnowing your exact network activity or activity over time can be very helpful for diagnosing ISP issues. You can also monitor individual devices (if they support SNMP) which can be good for tracking down excessive usage.\npeakhourapp.com\n\nHeads up: I'm the developer. \n\nA: If you already have little snitch, here's a tip which you can quickly check how much you've [recently] used. I have limited data on tethering, which I use when there is no wifi available. It is useful to keep an eye on whats going on in short periods.\nOSX Server app also has network monitoring tools. It comes free with the apple developer program.\n\n\nA: Built-in Activity Monitor (Applications → Utilities) shows you network usage. Also you can see open network ports for each running process.\n\n\nA: You can try nettop(1) in the Terminal. It is pre-installed, and refreshes every few seconds to provide a dashboard of all open network connections with their usage. Better than lsof since it shows the usage data too.\n$ nettop\n\nThen hit 'd' and look for odd-looking entries or entries with consistently large traffic in the 'bytes in' or 'bytes out' column. The 'd' instructs nettop to only show differences in each screen refresh.\nPractical usage notes:\nIf you don't recognize the process name, Google it.\nIf you don't want the process around, get the pid (the number next to the process name in nettop), and kill it with kill -9 <pid>. If that doesn't solve it, find out if you can uninstall the process.\nIf you're interested in what the process is transmitting over the network, use the client port number for that particular connection (e.g. '53133' from 10.0.0.1:53133->74.125.68.100:80) to run a tcpdump(1) to see the data in the packets being exchanged: sudo tcpdump -nnvvXSs 1514 port 53133\nIf you're interested in the destination the process is talking to, but the destination IP address doesn't have a reverse DNS hostname (like in the previous example), then try visiting that IP address in a web browser as https://IP, click the broken lock icon in the address bar, and view the certificate details to find out which domain is served there (*.google.com in this case). This won't work if SSL port 443 isn't open on the destination.\n\nA: OsTrack (Mac App Store) tracks how much memory, cpu, and bandwidth each process is using. It may not be accurate to a very specific degree, but it works, has a nice UI, and is free so I suggest you give it a try.\n\nA: This page list four options:\nhttp://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/internet-roundup/4-ways-to-monitor-bandwidth-usage-on-your-mac/\nThe best two seem to be Surplus Meter (free) and Net Monitor($10)\nThere may also be linux tools available but I am not familar with them.\n\nA: I would check what apps use the network or which are listening for connection with lsof -Pi command.\n\nA: I believe that Rubbernet is exactly what you are looking for. \nThe only downside is that Rubbernet cannot distinguish between LAN traffic and WAN traffic. It sounds like you are looking at one computer, so that shouldn't be an issue.\nThere is a demo available on their website, or you can buy it from the Mac App Store for US$25, which seems to be a pretty good deal since they want € 29.99 (about US$42) for a single user copy or € 49.99 (almost $69) for a \"family pack\" if you buy through their website.\n(Hat tip to Macworld.com for bringing it to my attention a few months ago.)\nIf you want something cheaper, NetUse Traffic Monitor might suit you too.\n\nA: Bandwidth+ is a free network usage tracker for Macbooks. It tracks upload & download data and shows monthly data usage as well. It is available on the App Store.\n", "Q: Is there any way to globally or -- at least persistently -- kill OnSwipe for iPad browsing? So, web browsing on the iPad has its quirks and drawbacks, but the one that stands head and shoulders above all others for me is the abomination that is OnSwipe, and especially its incarnation as a WordPress theme. (Thanks so much WP for flipping that global default switch earlier this year.)\nWhile it is notionally possible for a visitor to disable this on a case-by-case basis (assuming that the theme's broken assumptions about window geometry even allow you to reach the relevant link), the cookie setting or whatever seems pretty transient, especially when running in a nested browser window in something like the Twitter app, and before you know it the wretched thing pops back, jiggling and gurning and generally making sites unusable.\nWordPress are apparently content with this situation, and OnSwipe themselves just brag about how they're going to supplant apps for everyone. (These people are allowed to vote and drive cars.)\nIf this were a desktop problem, there would probably be Safari extensions and Firebug scripts aplenty to solve it, but none of that is possible in iOS as far as I can see. So: is there any way to rid oneself of this curse or do we just have to live with great chunks of the web having been wilfully broken without so much as a by-your-leave?\n\nA: I asked OnSwipe for a solution as a global cookie on assets.onswipe.com could be used to do the trick.\nSadly they are unwilling to help in any way.\n\nA: If you have a modem or router that supports content filtering, you can add the domain assets.onswipe.com to its ‘block’ list to prevent OnSwipe from loading on any iPad connected via Wi-Fi to that network.\nIf you're connected via cellular or someone else's Wi-Fi network, I don't think there's any way to avoid it. :/\n\nA: Not sure if this works because I haven't tried it but it's worth a shot.\nhttp://chrisltd.com/blog/2013/12/block-onswipe-ipad-iphone/\n", "Q: Mail and multiple accounts in Gmail I Have a gmail account configured to receive and send emails of a live mail account and I have some services that I need to send emails as live mail to be identified, but in Apple Mail I'm only able to send using the gmail account.\nWhat I need is, using Apple Mail, send emails on behalf live mail account without having to setup the account 'cause I already receive the emails through the gmail account.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open accounts tab in preferences\n\n*Open any mail account you have\n\n*Drop down \"Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP)\"\n\n*Select existing account or select \"Edit SMTP Server List\" to create and/or modify some.\n\n\nA: In the mail account settings inside Mail, you can specify several mail addresses for an account (separated by commas). When you then send mail from this account you can select the mail address to use in the message window.\n", "Q: Screen doesn't turn back on I have a brand-new Macbook Pro, my first mac since 1987, and unfortunately I'm experiencing a severe issue with it. If I leave it by itself for a while, or close the lid and then re-open it, the screen remains black and nothing I do can fix that - I have to forcefully shut down the mac (holding the power button for like 10 seconds) and re-open it.\nI searched for this problem online and found many similar instances of it, but could not find any actual solution. How can I solve this issue? And if it's a still-unsolved problem, is there any work-around I can use to bring the screen back to life without rebooting the laptop?\n\nTechnical details, as copied from the About This Mac dialog:\nMacBook Pro\n15-inch, Late 2011\nProcessor  2.2 GHz Intel Core i7\nMemory  8 GB 1333 MHz DDR3\nGraphics  AMD Radeon HD 6750M 512 MB\nSoftware  Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2 (11C74)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Running software update reports that the laptop is up-to-date.\n\n*I only got it yesterday, and have managed to install a grand total of just 4 applications (Keka, Steam, Syncplicity and Chrome).\n\n*I have no peripherals connected - the only physical connection is the power cord, the only wireless connection is the Wi-Fi. The problem persists whether the mac is connected to the power or not.\n\n*The problem is consistent, once the screen turns off it's always doomed.\n\n\nA: \nI have a brand-new Macbook Pro\n\nWell the obvious first solution that comes to my mind is: use your excellent AppleCare support service! Since it's brand new, presumably it's within the initial complementary AppleCare period. Their tech support is awesome, and if they can't solve the problem, you can take it in to an Apple store for repair, or they'll ship you a box and return shipping label to have the machine shipped to them and fixed, free of charge.\n\nA: I've set the computer to never turn its monitor off and it took care of the problem - even after making the computer sleep and waking it up again it works.\nI am now experienced a different problem, though, but as I cannot be positively sure it's related to this one I've opened a new question about it: Why might a Macbook Pro go back into sleep shortly after waking up?\n", "Q: How many people can you add to an iMessages group? I was curious what the limit was on the number of people you can add to an iMessages group. Assuming everyone was on iMessages (i.e. everyone shows up as blue).\n\nA: I read nothing about a limit in the different user guides for iOS devices (e.g. iPhone User Guide [PDF, 17MB]). Because of that I think there is no limit for groups.\n\nA: Apple has published on April 03, 2020 a limit of 32 people per group iMessage / Messages / FaceTime. You can have many more groups in the app, just not more than 32 distinct AppleID/iCloud per group.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209022\n\nYou can start a Group FaceTime from the FaceTime app or from a group conversation in the Messages app — and you can add up to 32 people.\n\n\nA: I believe 9 members is the maximum amount that can participate in a single iMessage group thread.\nI don't know the reason for this arbitrary number but people in my company have discovered this on their own. We are organized into groups of 12 and have not been able to include the entire group  without a third-party app.  \n\nWith regards to other comments made earlier in this string, there are countless reasons businesses would use group texting in fairly large groups. For example, sales teams, management team, or dept. teams can use messaging for rapid means of communication.\n\nMessaging is quickly becoming the preferred means of communication where I work when rapid responses from groups are required or when everyone is spread out geographically. Email tends to be slower even if it is pushed to users devices. We primarily use email for longer messages and less urgent matters.\n\nA: I just unsuccessfully did 28 for an event here in Denver.\n", "Q: How can I make a 3G video call (not Facetime) from an iPhone 4 to another brand's 3G phone? How can I make a 3G video call (not Facetime) from an iPhone 4 to another brand's 3G phone? Is it possible by default? or any apps?\nEdit 11 November:\nI just found this today: No 3G video calling on iPhone 4\n\nA: Yes, you can use Skype for that, if the app allows 3G video-chat. Skype is available for a lot of platforms. When you are at home, you can also use Skype on your computer so you don't have to use your (probably limited) 3G network.\n\nA: If you mean standard 3G video calls (3G-324M) then no, the iPhone does not support these (and I doubt any (legal) 3rd party apps would be allowed that deep inside the phone).\nIf the other party does not have any other possibilities besides 3G video call, then I guess your only possibility would be to get yourself a phone that supports that. \n\nA: Fring supports many phone types. iPhone, Android, Nokia phones supporting the Ovi store, and many \"classic\" phones with support for mobile Java.\nTango also competes in this space by catering to iPhone, Android, and even Desktops/Laptops, though apparently Windows-only at the moment.\n\nA: I use Qik, made by Skype: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qik-video/id439715497?mt=8 Its product page says \"Compatible with iPhones, iPod Touches that have a built-in cameras and iPad 2's with iOS4+. Place live video calls with other Qik users on iOS4+ devices or on Android 2.1- Android 2.3.3 phones (93% of all Android phones).\"\nI just got the Qik app and only have tested it once, but it worked fine over 3G on Verizon network.\n\nA: Most mobile devices dont allow 3G connections. According to my understanding, VOIP like Skype won't function on 3G either. Video calling requires a stable net connection which 3G definitely isn't, at least in most countries. Hopefully 4G technology will take care of this recurring problem.\n\nA: Unfortunately Facetime is only available for Apple devices and a Mac running Snow Leopard.\nYou can try Skype?\nThis is free to users, by downloading the app and informing your friend of the apps function, you will be able to essentially have a Facetime call. Best of all, you will be able to use an existing Skype account which means if you already have one you will get all your contacts, credits, and data.\n", "Q: How can I turn off a Mac's display without sleeping the Mac itself? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs it possible to put the display to sleep without putting the whole computer to sleep? \n\nI have an iMac, and sometimes I want to play some music over night, without the bright display.

What does it mean? What should I do?\n\nA: From your screenshots, it looks like you had a kernel panic. A kernel panic is an action which an OS takes due to a fatal error. More info on Wikipedia about kernel panics.\nFrom Apple's support doc about kernel panics:\n\nIn most cases, kernel panics are not caused by an issue with your Mac. They are most likely caused by an issue external to your Mac. If the kernel panic doesn't happen again within a few weeks, you don't need to troubleshoot further.\n\nAll you need to do is hold down the power button on your Mac until it shuts down. Then, start it back up. If you are still experiencing kernel panics, Apple recommends that you boot up in safe mode to see if you still have kernel panics. Read the support doc for more information.\nYou shouldn't be too worried about a kernel panic. Usually they are caused by external things, and can be resolved by rebooting. If you continually get kernel panics, then you should start worrying. The support doc gives some advanced troubleshooting for kernel panics.\n", "Q: Time Capsule stuck on makingbackup disk available I am an IT person, and i have set up two Time capsule and the backup is not working.

The dual boot worked by holding the ⌥ alt key upon boot (not rEFIt).\nBlessing the Ubuntu Partition will speed up the boot process. Apparently, all I have to do is this:\nsudo bless –device /dev/disk0s3 –setboot –legacy –verbose\n\nI will do this using the Terminal with the Recovery USB for Lion.\nI do not yet understand in detail what the command does. Also, I do not know how to reverse it.\nYou can see my partition layout here:\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *128.0 GB   disk0\n   1:       Microsoft Basic Data EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            92.7 GB    disk0s2\n   3:       Microsoft Basic Data                         10.5 GB    disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data                         15.7 GB    disk0s4\n   5:                 Linux Swap                         4.2 GB     disk0s5\n   6:                  Apple_HFS FREEDOM                 4.2 GB     disk0s7\n\n\nA: Short Answer: YES, it's reversible, nothing is \"permanent\" in a hard-drive partition (other than deleting partitions and information of course). Almost always you will be able to undo what you did, although sometimes at the cost of data loss, naturally. \nWhile you are at the terminal type:\nman bless\n\nor if you're lazy, you can read it here.\nYou are interested in this part: \n --legacy                 If --setBoot is given, set the firmware to boot a legacy BIOS-based operating\n                          system from the specified disk. The active flag of an MBR-partitioned disk is\n                          not modified, which can be done with fdisk(8) . This is only supported on EFI-\n                          based systems.\n\nupdate: \nYes, the bless command has different modes of operation, one is device, which specifies a device (rather than just a folder or a mount point) as the destination for the 'blessing'. Bear in mind that blessing does two things, it can select the active boot (which is more or less what you want to do) and it can also make sure that a mount point/folder/device has all the required files for booting. (Kind of what the old format c: /s did in DOS. The \"s\" was something like: Copy all system files there so this drive can boot.\nWith the -setBoot option you're also telling the system to boot from the specified device (must be unmounted as far as I can remember).\nThe --legacy basically tells bless that the Operating System that is going to boot doesn't support OpenEFI or EFI and expects a BIOS instead. \nBear in mind that you might need to later use fdisk to set the active partition if ubuntu fails to boot.\nrEFIt usually does all this for you and is easily removable if you don't want it anymore, so in any case, I suggest you give it a try unless you have a specific reason to avoid it.\nYou don't need the --verbose but it's ok to have it to see what's going on.\n\nSo in order to undo the upper command, I would do this: sudo bless\n  -device /dev/disk0s1 -file -setboot -file because EFI on disk0s1 is EFI-based But will the pressing ALT still work to start my recovery\n  stick?\n\nThat command will not work, if you specify --file you have to give the path to an EFI-Blessed boot file. Since you're reverting to OS X, you don't need to pass that, because bless will use a default one. \nThe Option/ALT will always work because it basically tells the EFI in your box: don't boot, just read the drive(s) and tell me which ones are bootable, show me a list and let me select one; this works regardless of your boot drive. \nHope this helps. Bear in mind that I haven't used bless more than a couple of times and was months ago (if not years). I don't remember having problems with it, but then again, I was just probably moving drives or doing something weird. Whenever I installed Linux on an Intel-EFI based Mac, I always used rEFIt.\n", "Q: Best input to connect a monitor to a Macbook Pro I just bought a 24\" monitor (asus pa246q) with dvi/hdmi/displayport inputs. I am wondering which is the best input I should use to connect a MacBook Pro 15\" (late 2010). Someone suggested me HDMI, but the image is not perfect, still looks better on my old white-plastic Cinema Display with ADC adapter. \nI was thinking to display port as an obvious solution, but I have to find a mini display port to display port adapter. \nAny suggestion? thanks\nAndy \n\nA: I'd go with DisplayPort, if for no other reason than it's the native connector for your MacBook, and it's more likely that other devices will have DVI or HDMI, so that if you feel the need to use multiple computers with the monitor in the future you have those ports open.\nMonoprice is my go-to source for cabling. It has a pretty good selection of DisplayPort (mini and full-size) cables and adapters, very cheaply, including  the mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cables you need.\n", "Q: How can I see my IPv6 neighbors?

What gestures/settings do I need to accomplish this?\n\nA: I don't like pressing hard to drag, I use the 3-finger-drag gesture. With this it is easy to right-drag, just hold ctrl on the keyboard and drag with three fingers on the Trackpad.\n\nA: I have the same problem sharing magic tracpad using synergy.  When you tap down with two fingers and lift its a right click, two fingers and hold its a scroll.\nWhat works is two fingers, then press down hard enough to engage the physical mouse button built into the feet.\nThis works, but... the problem is that you can't do locked drags this way; i.e., with a USB or wireless mouse, you can right drag by pressing the right mouse button, and if you run out of mousing space, you can pick the mouse literally off the surface and as long as you continue to hold down the right button, you can continue to drag by repositioning the mouse at a different location on the surface .\nSimilarly, you can do locked drags with the trackpad by momentarily picking your fingers up off the surface and by repositioning them quickly enough, you can continue the drag, ad infinitum.\nBut if you right drag using the above described method with the trackpad, as soon as you release the pressure from the trackpad button, it springs up and the Windows VM immediately at that spot presents you with the right drag context sensitive menu.\nIt would work much better if you could produce the right drag by holding down a key such as Ctrl, Option, etc., with your second hand while performing a normal three-finger drag on the trackpad with your first hand. But contrary to the next most recent answer, this does not produce a right drag action in Windows.\nFeb 2015/Windows 7 in Parallels 10 in Yosemite/ I've found sequence Ctrl+Shift, then 3 finger drag then lift off trackpad THEN release Ctrl+Shift works for me (in Audition 1.0/Frequency Analysis adjusting horizontal scale)\n\nA: In Windows 7 under Parallels I can right-drag with the Magic Trackpad by clicking and dragging with two fingers. I can also click with two fingers and continue dragging with one to get a right drag.

Hover your cursor over the  tag and right click it. Then, select the \"Capture screenshot\" option and save when prompted.\nIf you only want a specific element, just right click on the appropriate bit of html.

I think I saw a progress bar at first as it was deleting the account.\nI've come back to the machine after a few hours. There is no progress bar. System Preferences is open and if I try to quit, it says \"Users & groups is removing a user account and home directory\". In grey writing, it says \"Deleting Account...\" under the user name. In Activity Monitor I can see that 'writeconfig' is using 10+% of the CPU, followed by 'opendirectoryd' and 'mds'.\nIs it doing anything? How long is it supposed to take? It's been 6 hours already.\n\nA: The secure delete option can indeed take a long time. But if you really want all traces of your data to be removed from the media, you need to wait for it to complete.\nIf you want to quickly get all traces of your data off a machine, the quickest way is to physically remove the disk drives (believe it or not). This is what I generally recommend to friends who want to pass along a used machine.\nIf you really just want to preclude casual perusal of your old data, the secure delete option isn't necessary. You can just have System Preferences do a normal deletion.\nA common misconception is that reformatting the drive and re-installing the OS will remove all traces of your data. This is not true! It's not much more secure than doing a normal deletion. (What makes it slightly more secure is that portions of the old data might be overwritten once when you re-install the OS.)\n\nA: Yet another approach that might speed up the deletion process would be to delete a user account without chosing the secure delete account option in System Preferences > Users & Groups.\nAfterwards, on a still existing user account, overwrite the free disk space just once from Terminal.app (see Secure deletion: a single overwrite will do it).\nls -ld /Volumes/*\nman diskutil | less -p secureErase\ndiskutil secureErase freespace 0 '/Volumes/Macintosh HD'\n\n\nA: To add on to the existing answers and offer a different solution, you can securely erase the drive instead of just one user account.\nIf you want to sell your machine but also include installed software, there is a better way to set this up that will ensure none of your personal data is on the machine, as well as provide a better box opening experience for your buyer. \n\n\n*\n\n*I would suggest doing a secure erase of your hard disk first. \n\n*Then, reinstall your OS. \n\n*Configure a dummy user account named \"test\" or \"admin\" or something generic\n\n*Install the software you want to include\n\n*Restart your machine in Single User mode\n\n*Very carefully, do the following:\n\n\n\nmount -uw / (This mounts the root volume so you can make changes to it.\nrm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone  (This removes the flag that tells Setup\n  Assistant that it's done)\nrm /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/\"shortname\".plist (Replace \"shortname\" with the user account name you set up before. This removes the user plist)\nrm -rf /Users/shortname  (Replace \"shortname\" with the user account name you set up before. This removes the User directory)\nrm -rf /Library/Preferences  (This resets preferences)\nshutdown -r now  (This restarts the computer)\n\nVerify that your machine starts up to the Setup Assistant and you're done. That way, your buyer can start up the machine to the Setup Assistant and still retain the software you want to provide them with. \nGood luck.\n\nA: I think you would be better served by wiping and reformatting the entire hard drive and re-installing the version of Mac OS X that came with the machine from the original installation disks. Not only would it be faster, it would be more secure and you would ensure that you are not passing any data that you own along to the new purchaser.\n\nA: The best option in my opinion is to interrupt the process any time you wish. You are correct that only securely deleting the user account is faster than securely deleting all unused space (except for the edge case where the drive it 100% totally full except for this user's data - unlikely in practice and at risk of failing due to no swap space being available). You will have added time to re-do the erase, so unless you are certain it's frozen, letting it run might be the best course until you need to interrupt the process.\n\nAny time you have to halt the mac, there could be some damage to the files being written, but at this point, the mac is simply wiping the user files that are about to be deleted.\nIf you have a recent backup or bootable restore media, you are really in great shape. Once the mac reboots, you will of course have to deal with the complete deletion of the /Users/whatever folder and potentially need to re-do the user deletion if it's still partially left around. You can still choose the secure delete command but this time have a user logged in to inspect the progress. You can also insecurely delete and either skip that security or have the mac run a secure overwrite of all free space when you can afford the time to write over all the free space to ensure security if someone were to try to search for files among the unallocated space.\nI would let the mac delete as long as you can, and then ask back a new question linking to this if you should run into any questions or errors on cleanup. \n", "Q: How to contact Apple about connection issue on bugreport.apple.com?

But why not just give them the keynote?  As most people would probably just watch the presentation only without editing it.  Even if they would want to edit it, they would probably do it after viewing the keynote.  The only other option I can think of is to record your keynote through the File-Export, then choose quicktime and export (Edit the options depending on your needs).  This would make the audience to view it in a movie file instead of a slideshow mode.  Though it might not be the best idea as it wouldn't allow time for the audience to read the things on the slide.

I recently moved my iTunes library to my Netgear ReadyNAS NV+ (all relevant file operations on the NAS are using AFP protocol). The library had previously been on my Mac Pro, in my ~/Music directory. In iTunes Preferences > Advanced, I changed the path of the iTunes Media Folder to the Media volume on the NAS, so that it now has the path /Volumes/media/Music/iTunes Media. In iTunes, I chose File > Library > Organize Library, then chose Consolidate Files from the Organize Library dialog. This made iTunes copy all of the files from the Mac Pro's iTunes Media Folder to the iTunes Media Folder on the NAS. After that, I deleted the 60 GB of files in the Mac Pro's local iTunes Media Folder (the boot drive is an SSD, so I needed the space).\nTwo questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the Mac Pro, the setting for the location of the iTunes Media Folder has changed back from the NAS to the local folder twice now; I've had to reset it back to the NAS. Some apps have been updated, and I discovered that the updates had been downloaded to the local iTunes Media Folder. After I reset that location to the NAS and re-ran Consolidate Files, the apps were copied to the NAS. Any idea what's causing iTunes to \"forget\" the NAS location and revert to the local folder, and how to solve that problem?\n\n*After I moved the library on the Mac Pro to the NAS, I also pointed the copy of iTunes running on my MacBook to the NAS, so that it could share the files (I can still share the files using Home Sharing from the Mac Pro, of course). It appears that the MacBook doesn't seem to simply read the state of the library from the NAS; it erroneously shows that 84 mobile apps need updating, and some TV shows that I downloaded on the Mac Pro don't appear on the MacBook. I'm OK with simply using Home Sharing on the MacBook if necessary, but I was hoping the two machines could share the same library on the NAS and would stay in sync. Can you explain the MacBook behavior? Is there a fix that would keep the iTunes libraries on the two machines in sync? \n\nA: I can answer the second part of your question. Since you just updated the MacBook's iTunes settings to point to the NAS, it's iTunes library file still resides on the MacBook. This is a .itl file in your ~/Music/iTunes folder.\niTunes relies on this database to tell it what's in the media folder. If you add stuff to the media folder without adding it through iTunes (i.e. just dropping files in Finder, or using another copy of iTunes on another machine) then that .itl database does not get updated.\nSo when you add files through iTunes on your Mac Pro, it updates the .itl database on your Mac Pro, but not your MacBook, so the MB can't see those files. If you add anything through iTunes on the MB, the Mac Pro database won't have it, since the copy of iTunes that connects to that database did not process the files.\nI have a similar setup to what you're doing: iTunes media on an external drive connected to my iMac, and a MacBook which I use ONLY Home Sharing on.\nYou might get the idea to move one .itl file to the NAS and open it in iTunes on both machines, and this will work, but you can/should never have it open in both at the same time. That .itl file is really just an SQLite database, and they don't allow simultaneous access, so I've never even attempted this.\nWith respect to your first question, check ~/Music/iTunes and see if there are any old library (.itl) files. It's most likely that iTunes is opening an old copy or a backup of the database. If you duplicated the database or started a new one before moving your media, this might be the cause.\nStart iTunes and make sure the media folder is set correctly or make some other change in iTunes. Now go to ~/Music/iTunes and look for the .itl file that has most recently been modified. Move all the others out of the folder.\nQuit iTunes and restart it while holding the Option/Alt key. This will bring up a dialog that lets you select which database to use. Select the .itl file you left alone and it will continue using that as the default library.\n\nA: This question was from 2011, so you may have figured out what is causing issue one by now, but here is what I have found, as I have a very similar setup to yours.\nIf you open iTunes when the you are not mounted to the music volume on your NAS, the tendency is for iTunes to default the iTunes Media location setting that you set in Preferences>Advanced back to the local music library. \nThen, even if you are connect to the NAS at a later time but don't realize the reset of the iTunes Media location has taken place, any downloads you do, App updates, music, movies, etc., gets add to the local media folder. \nIf you change the iTunes Media back to the NAS, then you can go to iTunes and control + click the asset and select show in finder. Then you just drag it to the NAS location and move it there and iTunes Library should reset it's pointer to the file.\nThe ways that I have tried to prevent this from happening have been to set my NAS Music volume to open at startup automatically and the try and not plug my iPhone into my MBP when I am away from my home network. If you don't open iTunes while the computer is not connected to the NAS, then it will not know that it is missing and will not reset where iTunes Media is stored.\nIf you want to use iTunes when you are on the road, then save some of your assets to the local music folder, and then remember to reset the preferences when you get home.\n\nA: The default library is /users/yourname/music/itunes. Just go to that folder and press Command+I. Then you can do either one of the following. You could do both but you don't have to. \n\n\n*\n\n*At the top of the File Info dialog box, in the General section, check the box labeled \"Locked.\" A lock will appear on the folder.\n\n*At the bottom of the File Info dialog box under Sharing and Permissions, make all three settings \"read only.\"\n\n\nAfter you do that, iTunes can no longer create a library in the default location. If it tries to revert, it will prompt you for the location of the library. That's annoying, but it is much, much better. You don't end up with media files scattered.\nIf you have files in both places, copy the files from the internal library into the external library into the corresponding folders, then Open them with iTunes to add them to the library. \nThis is one of those things, like duplicate files, that is not a bug, annoys the crap out of people, but doesn't cause customers to go away. So Apple will never fix it.\n\nA: You can read that : http://geekmeupscotty.blogspot.fr/2015/01/music-files-in-nas-dont-mean-your.html\n@Vikash: you're very right, when the lib is local, the lib can't really be shared with other devices... unless you decide to define a master computer that manages the lib locally and have it sync'd to a Nas folder. Even though, if a user of one of the other devices that connected to the NAS synced lib files, add his own music to the collection, it will overwrite the NAS lib file, but the master computer will re-overwrite it on sync.\nI wonder what happens when u put your .itl file on a dropbox synced between all the users...it might be a great idea... specially since dropbox (or other sync services keep the many versions of your files).\n\nA: Because the iTunes Library is a database that can be accessed by a single client and Apple has not shown much interest to change and improve all this you currently can only make use of the iTunes Server of your NAS, if your NAS have any.\nTo have the iTunes Library on a remote network location is just not a good idea. It can work, but it can give problems too. And especially it you are going to invoke the Library by multiple computers with iTunes on it.\nSo just better activate the NAS specific iTunes Server application and let it direct to the Library with all the music folders that you first have transferred to the NAS. Then you start iTunes with the Option key pressed to make sure you are going to let it point to a local Library as well and create a new Library. Later when iTunes is started you choose your NAS in the pulldown menu in the upper left corner.\nA downside of all this is that your Library is not managed by the clients, it is play-only. But all clients can use and play from the same Library at the same time.\nIt is needless to say that this is also not an ideal situation. Let's hope for a better solution provided by Apple including a migration of current Library database in something better that has proper network capabilities. \n", "Q: Who makes non-white iPhone earbuds similar in function and design to Apple's default earbuds?

Push the middle for play/pause/skip/previous, and it has volume up/down controls on the extremities. Note that you have to plug the adapter into the phone, it cannot be the other way around.\nThese have worked in an iPhone, iPad, and iPod, and they're chiefly designed for the buttonless iPod shuffle, but work with everything else.\nIf you don't need the mic, you could get by with this, and any pair of headphones you want.\n\nA: This question is so subjective you're better off getting some shopping advice in the store. You probably want to make the comparison yourself, factoring in price, quality and features.\nPersonally I do like the Bose MIE2i a lot. They have volume controls and a play/pause/accept call button, and they feel very comfortable (they go slightly in the ear canal, but not in an irritating way) and stay well into place, even when jogging. The sounds is also a lot better compared to the previous iteration of the Bose earbuds, with richer mid-tones and highs, next to the full bass.\nThen again, that was just my personal opinion, so go do some shopping and compare!\n", "Q: What's the keyboard shortcut to select the non-default button on a pop-up alert?

Specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*When doing this within the MS Office suite (Powerpoint, Word etc.), does the font get embedded within the PDF?\n\n*Does Preview.app embed fonts when “Saving as PDF”?\n\n*If I’m generating the PDF on a Mac, when I view it on other Macs and PCs, would the fonts be embedded?\n\n\nA: Yes to all your questions. OS X’ Quartz PDFContext generator embeds fonts (unless the font forbids it, it seems). I couldn’t find any document that expressly states this (it’s implied in this bit of Pages help, for instance) but I have been sending out PDF proofs with fonts not installed on the recipient’s computer long enough to know it does.\nAs long as you use the OS X routines for PDF generation, i.e. go through either the “Save as PDF” dialog or an option upstream of that, like Pages’ “Export” dialog, your fonts will be embedded – Microsoft’s Office suite is no exception. Anything that uses its own PDF generation routines (like OpenOffice/LibreOffice/NeoOffice do with their “Export” option), however, might or might not embed fonts, depending on its settings.\nFinally, as already stated, “embedded” means “contained in the file”, which in turn means “viewable on other computers without the font installed”.\n\nA: Once the pdf is in preview, chose print, and then \"PDF\" from the Print Dialog.\nThere saying Save as PDF should embed the font. At least it worked for a pdf created from LaTeX for me.\n", "Q: How do I gain permission to generate ssh keys on my Mac?

I find my Mac (Mac Lion) going slower day by day. I think it will be beneficial to defrag the drive but didn't find any Apple tool for it. I want a an effective third party Mac defragmenter for my Mac drive.\n\nA: Speed of access on HFS+ drives is not that affected by fragmentation unlike Windows file systems as OSX will do some defragmentation. A third party investigation is here.\nYou might be better off checking there is enough free space for new files.\nThere are some utilities to do defragmentation like iDefrag\n\nA: On APFS - you don’t need to defragment anything.\nOn HFS+ - DriveGenius does what you ask. It rebuilds the catalog (filesystem) that tracks the files. You don’t need to rearrange the files on the drive as macOS does that for you - just keep 20 GB free or 25% free if you can, and the system optimizes the file location automatically.\n\nThere aren't many apps that do this on mac since actual filesystem fragmentation both rare and rarely a cause of measurable slowdown.\n\nMac OS X automatically defragments files that are likely to cause a slowdown in addition to automatically optimizing hot (often used) files to a fast and not-fragmented part of the drive.\nThe HFS+ filesystem directory / catalog itself can become fragmented over a long time but you can fix that easily. Back up to time machine and an erase install / migration back cures that issue without needing to spend money on a live tool. DiskWarrior also helps to rebuild HFS+ catalogs in addition to the already mentioned Drive Genius.\nBest of luck - keep looking if you find defrag isn't what the doctor ordered on your mac.\n\nA: I agree with Mark. Usually, I don't fill up a drive past 80-85%, as the slower parts of a mechanical drive begins around that point. HDs have different speeds and access time depending on the location on the disk.\nTherefore using an app like iDefrag could help (remember to backup your files before!) but will likely need to be done on a regular basis to provide a continued result, and I'm wondering if the time you're gonna spend on this isn't gonna be for nothing.\nI would suggest using RAID-0 or better yet RAID-5 drives setups. Bit more expansive, but speed will be much more constant over a longer period of time, but this setup also carries more risk (especially RAID-0), therefore you NEED a backup, could get expensive...\nAn SSD is a good solution, the only problem is the capacities. A good, fast and reliable 204 Gb SSD retails for ~500$, a 480 Gb for ~900$.\n\nA: If we go little deeper we see that the HFS+ file system allocates memory not on the basis of first free space first but on the basis of largest free space first. \nThis technique, although reduces the chances of fragmentation but doesn't stops it totally. \nIts right that fragmentation hardly matters when you are a simple home users but for professionals (Like me) a slow Mac matters a lot.\nSo, now I have two programs for defragmentation. One from Stellar drive defrag and another is idefrag from coriolis. \nLet me try them and see if I can get some speed in my Mac.\n\nA: There are many 3rd party apps available in the market which are beneficial for defragging a Mac based hard drive. Below are the top 3 player in this list (i.e. defragging a Mac hard drive): -\n1.Stellar Defrag Drive\n2.iDefrag\n3.Drive Genius\nEach of the above mentioned apps defrag the Mac hard drive and also reduce the boot time.

I've noticed that many downloads are a dmg (disk image) that contains a single pkg file (installation package). Usually the pkg seems to be already compressed since the dmg doesn't reduce the file size much if any.\nExample:\n\n\n*\n\n*MonoFramework-MDK-2.10.6_1.macos10.xamarin.x86.dmg is 119,242,061 bytes (119.2 MB on disk)\n\n*MonoFramework-MDK-2.10.6_1.macos10.xamarin.x86.pkg is 119,979,719 bytes (120 MB on disk)\n\n\nA savings of 737,658 bytes, or 0.6% of the original file size.\nIs there a reason not to just distribute the pkg? Is the 0.6% compression savings that important? Or is it just the way things have always been done on the Mac?\n(Yes, I realize that 737,658 bytes times all the millions of downloads that dmg gets does add up, but it just always seems annoying to have that extra steps in there to mount a dmg, run the installer and then unmount the dmg. Maybe a better question is \"why doesn't Mac OS X recognize a dmg with a single pkg inside it as just a pkg and simply install it without requiring all that mounting and unmounting?\")\n\nA: One possible reason could be that Safari by default automatically mounts DMG files, and that a Finder window would pop up with the contents. In turn the DMG folder could be styled with for example a background image. I assume that could be considered more user-friendly than having to look in your Downloads folder for an installer, but I agree it's pretty moot.\nAnother reason would be the ability to group together other supporting files as well, for example documentation files or even secondary installers.\nHowever, it's not such a common distribution to start with. The majority of apps are distributed as self-contained .app folders inside a DMG file (if not via the App Store now). Your example seems to be rather an exception to me, though maybe it is more common with some particular distribution channels? Personally, I wouldn't dwell on it much further.\n\nA: Technically, a .pkg is not a file, but a folder.  So  maybe collecting it into a single file is essential for downloading.\n\nA: Yet another reason is that you can't run .pkg files directly from Network volumes, but you can run a .dmg from a network volume and then launch the package.\n\nA: Data on DMG image can be checked for integrity with Disk utility. You can make it mandatory for the user to agree to license before mounting dmg. It could be locked from modification. You can easily add hidden files and folders on DMG. You can make background image. You can make it safe from stripping during transit through non-metadata aware file systems like FAT.\nPlenty of reasons actually.\n", "Q: How can I delete some of the built–in text–to–speech voices? I was going to install two additional voices through Speech preference pane. I noticed the size of two voices is 1,3 gigabytes, which is a lot but manageable.\nLooking at the list of already installed/downloaded voices (say -v ? in Terminal) I saw & heard many obscure voices that I probably wouldn't ever use; and I value having a few hundred megabytes (or few gigabytes) of free space a lot more than hearing someone talking while drowning or getting tickled. \nHow can I properly delete some of these (en_US \"Funny\") voices? By properly I mean in a way I don't accidentally break anything in the process. For example, directly deleting files from /System/Library/Speech/Voices feels a bit dubious…\nMany of the voices that say -v ? lists are actually deactivated in the Speech preference pane, but if I tick them I won't get a warning that they have to be downloaded — so they reside somewhere on my Mac.\n\nA: To delete some or all of the voices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the “VoiceOver Utility” (it is in /Applications/Utilities/).\n\n*In the left pane select “Speech”.\n\n*In the table with languages and voices, next to “English” (or any other language) open the drop-down list in the “Voice” column and choose “Customise...”.\n\n*Untick the languages that you want removed.\n\n*Press “OK”. A dialog will pop up asking whether you’d like to keep or delete unchecked languages, choose “Delete”.\n\n\n\n\nA couple of notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*While this method is safer than deleting the files by hand, it will not delete “Compact” versions of the voices. Also, it will not delete “Siri” voices, which are stored in the same directory.\n\n*If later you decide to reinstall removed languages, just follow the same steps and tick the languages you want to install.\n\n\nA: They are in /System/Library/Speech/Voices\nHowever the whole /System/Library/Speech folder is \"only\" .5GB in space, so you wouldn't save much.\n\nA: Removing voices\nAll voices are in /System/Library/Speech/Voices. Just like most other Library items in OS X, they are inherited, which means you could install them in /Library/Speech/Voices and ~/Library/Speech/Voices.\nRemoving items from /System/Library is indeed usually not a good thing to do, but here, it does not have any practical consequences beyond making the deleted voices unavailable. Indeed, the list in the System Preferences is dynamically generated from the items found in the said folder, just like the Sound alerts, or the wallpapers. You can confirm this by adding / removing / renaming elements in the /System/Library/Sounds folder, for example.\nThere's no other way to manage the speech items, but since this one is without consequences as long as you leave at least one voice, it is actually pretty nice to simply manipulate the filesystem. I have personally long removed Alex, along with other /System/Library and /Library items.\nInstalling voices / what to back up\nAs you underlined, Lion provides a “Customize” item in the list of voices that allows you to download voices in many languages. Therefore, if you ever delete the original “Alex” voice (the heavy one, 400+MB), you can download it again through this menu.\nThe “funny” voices, however, are not downloadable. You'll need to back them up if you want to remove them but keep a way to get them back (or you could use a package manager like Pacifist to extract only them from the Lion installer package, but that's a lot of hassle for not much). Nevertheless, considering they weigh, all together, less than 35MB, I'd let them in place.\nPlease note that you must leave at least one voice for the “Customize” item to be accessible. So, even if you want to remove all voices, leave at least one there, or you won't be able to install any again. “Fred” is the lightest “serious” voice, so I'd advise leaving it in any case.\nSize note / a bit of history\nAs for the relative sizes, Alex is very heavy because it is of much higher quality, and is actually from a totally different generation than the others: it shipped with Leopard, while others have been around since Mac OS 7 (had a lot of fun with them, actually ;) ). Of course, Alex would have filled a full hard drive at the time. There's no \"logic\" that's shared between voices in those packages, hence the heavy weight of installing new “modern” voices in other languages.\n", "Q: Is there a good, full-featured EPUB to PDF converter?

I did not configure anything in BetterTouchTool.\n", "Q: Add wallpaper to iPad but not to the list of Photos? The only way I found of adding a custom wallpaper to an iPad leaves that wallpaper mixed with all the photos. Can I somehow specify that it's a wallpaper and should go into the list of wallpapers?\n(couldn't find this by googling...)\n\nA: I don't believe you can, maybe with jailbreaking?\nHowever, after setting the wallpaper, you can remove it from your photo library without affecting your wallpaper selection. This may be a bit inconvenient when you regularly switch between wallpapers, but it is as close as it gets.\n", "Q: How do I see full movie titles in iPad Video browser? On my iPad, long video titles are cut off even though there is lots of blank space everywhere. Even when I tap a video, the detail screen cuts off the title in the exact same location despite there still being lots of blank space everywhere.\nFull movie titles are a lot more useful than blank space... Can I somehow see them at all when I'm away from my PC?\n\nA: Tap and hold, you will get a popover until you let go with the full details.  Same works with music in the ipod app.\n", "Q: Downloading Podcast on iPhone iOS 5.0 No Longer Shows Date In Music App Since I upgraded to iOS 5 when I download podcasts from iTunes on my phone the date the podcast is published is no longer downloaded.\nSee the below screenshot, notice how the last podcast has a published date of 11/3, that one I downloaded via iTunes on my computer.  The others I used the iTunes store on the iPhone to download directly to the phone.  Downloading directly from iTunes on the phone is nice, but then the phone holds all of the podcasts out of order.\nThoughts?\n\n\nA: I think this is a bug in the Music or iTunes app on iOS 5. Something doesn't seem to store the date properly on podcasts downloaded on the phone, they don't show up in the app and if you transfer them back to your computer, iTunes shows the date as Dec 31, 2000 or something nonsensical.\nPodcasts I download in iTunes on my Mac and then sync to my iPhone show the date fine.\n\nA: I had a similar problem. Seems if you had any podcasts in iOS 4, upgrading to iOS 5 is not really painless. The way I fixed it is to untick \"sync podcasts to this device\", then click apply, then tick that box again and sync again.\nThis will also restore the podcast album artwork and time remaining bug.\n", "Q: On the iPad, how do I tell what version of Mobile Safari I have? I'd like to know what precise version of Mobile Safari the iPad I'm using has. Is there any way to find out (preferably from the device itself)? There doesn't seem to be any menu in Safari Mobile, and thus none to choose \"About\" from. If you go to Settings | Safari, you see various useful things, but no \"About\" or \"Version\" or similar, which surprised me.\n\nA: You can get the userAgent string without visiting an external website, by typing the following in the Safari address bar (where you would normally type a URL):\njavascript:alert(navigator.userAgent)\nYou must type it exactly as it appears here, matching case and punctuation.\nAn alert popup will appear with the full useragent string, which contains the version number of Safari and iOS.\n\nA: None of the javascript answers worked for me. I found an easier way!\nThere are several \"what's my IP address?\" pages out there, such as this one. These pages tell you your IP address and, in some cases, what your browser is, what your operating system is, and if your browser is up to date.\n\nA: 2022 update: The easiest way these days it to look at what iOS version you're using (Settings > General > Software Update), because it appears that the iOS Safari version is now synced to iOS version (iOS version 15.4's Safari reports it's Version 15.4, 15.5's Safari reports it's Version 15.5, etc.). (Can't find a citation for that, though, sadly.)\n\nThe only way I've found Ross McNab's way was much better but sadly no longer works (thanks, Apple); Billy Moon's way works but is a bit awkward for one-off checks.\nAnother way to do this is to use an external website (there are plenty to choose from, just search on \"what's my browser\"), which will report my user-agent string back to me.\nSo for instance, these sites will report back to me that my user-agent string is:\nMozilla/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 4_3_5 like Mac OS X; en-gb) AppleWebKit/533.17.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0.2 Mobile/8L1 Safari/6533.18.5\n...the Version/5.0.2 part tells me I'm using Mobile Safari 5.0.2.\nNote: See Jim Grisham's answer — while this will tell you Safari version, the WebKit version it shows you is apparently no longer accurate.\n\nA: 2022 update:\nFor privacy reasons, Mobile Safari on any devices with iOS / iPadOS 11.4.1 or later will only report a maximum WebKit version of 605.1.15 in the User-Agent string (I imagine something similar is true for anything accessible via JavaScript).\n\nIf you know the iOS version of the device, the ‘Safari version history’ chart at Wikipedia is probably the easiest place to look. (That page contains references for the underlying data sources.)\nExample:\n\niOS 12.5.5: Safari 12.1.2 / WebKit 607.1.40\niOS 13.7: Safari 13.1 / WebKit 609.1.20\niOS 14.7: Safari 14.1.2 / WebKit 611.1.21\niOS 15.4: Safari 15.4 / WebKit 613.1.17\n\n\nA: Since Ross McNab's answer appears to no longer work...\nBookmark this (or any) page - then edit the bookmark - call it what you like, but change the url to...\n\njavascript:alert(navigator.userAgent)\n\nNow you can check your user agent any time you feel like conveniently from your bookmarks.

And since the JavaScript is coming from the page and not directly from the browser, it is allowed to display.\n", "Q: Can't pair 13\" MacBook Air with iPhone 4 via Bluetooth I'm not sure why, but I can't get my iPhone 4 to talk to my new MacBook Air 13\".  I turn bluetooth on for both devices, open the Bluetooth Preferences and pair the devices.  This works - the code is displayed on the Mac and the phone, I click OK and it looks busy.  After that I get a message on the iPhone saying \"[mac name] is not supported\".\nI have also tried clicking 'Connect to Network' on the Mac and that results in the error \"The Bluetooth network is unavailable: There was an error connecting to your device. Make sure the device is turned on and in range\".\nI'm running 10.7.2 and iOS 5.0.\nWell the device (iPhone) is on and in range.  Can anyone help?  I want to be able to control Keynote on my Mac using the Keynote Remote app on my phone.\n\nA: Have you followed Apples instructions?  \nIt seems that Keynote works better via WiFi than Bluetooth but the link above shows how to setup both.\n\nA: Had similar problem pairing Mac mini and Ipad with iPhone 3GS.\nTurned out I had to enable Bluetooth AND Tethering on the iPhone. Suddenly it worked as it should.\n\nA: This might be useful to somebody as it relates to a very similar question: \nMy 27\" Mac (purchased February 2012) would not stay paired with my iPad Air 2 (purchased new in January 2015) nor with my Samsung Galaxy S4 mobile phone (purchased November 2013).  They would pair for about 2 seconds, and then I got the message: \"Network Access is unavailable. Make sure network access is enabled\".\nI have seen this issue on several blogs.\nThe answer is that my Mac was built before a time when Bluetooth Low Energy was supported.  That means it cannot connect to other devices by Bluetooth (apart from its own trackpad and wireless keyboard) and it cannot do Air Drop or any of today's similar functions - so hard luck, find another solution, such as Messaging, which does work via wireless.\nTo check for yourself, Click the Apple logo in the top left hand corner -> About This Mac -> Overview Tab -> System Report button -> Hardware -> Bluetooth -> and look for: \" Bluetooth low energy supported\".  If it says \"NO\" then you are in the same boat as myself and you will not be able to use the facility.\nHope this saves someone a headache.\n", "Q: iPhone video input (composite) I know that the iPhone supports video out using the AV cable accessory that Apple sells. This would indicate the possibility of an app which can use said cable to display video. \nDoes anything like this exist? If it isn't possible, why not?\n\nA: There are no known solutions for video input to the iPhone (other than the built-in camera of course). The AV cable you mentioned only provides video output and since there are no pins for video input on the dock connector (although the pinouts have often changed during the history of the dock connector), and the iPhone has no other inputs suitable for video input, this is very unlikely to happen with current iPhone/Pod/Pad models.\nThe closest solution I can think of would be to use an external recording device (a computer with a video capture device for example) and stream the resulting video the the iPhone over Wifi.\n\nA: There may be another way to do this. NTSC Composite Video is the quadrature amplitude modulated mix of the amplitude/brightness/intensity and color portions of the video signal, with two interleaved images being delivered 30 times per second. (525 lines total) it might be possible to sample the analog signal at 48khz and DSP that into a useable digital video - although possibly at reduced size (1/4 VGA) and frame rates (15 FPS) which could then be delivered via the iPhone headphone/mic jack or audio lines in the 30 pin connector.\n", "Q: What iPad app will allow me to present .PDFs or .PPTs that include OTF (and other) fonts? I do quite a bit of presenting using the iPad as a presentation tool, but I am a PC user. I have always created my slides in PowerPoint, converted to PDF and presented using GoodReader. I have done this dozens of times for clients and at conferences but I have run into a problem trying to use a number of more \"sexy\" fonts. \"Museo Slab 500\", \"Lobster Two\", \"Bebas Neue\" being a couple of example fonts… but there are loads more. See FontSquirrel for a comprehensive list.\nHere's the problem: I prepare the slides in PPT, convert to PDF (PDF looks OK on the PC), drop them onto the iPad using DropBox and then open in GoodReader. However GoodReader won't render many of the nice fonts I want to use. Up to now I've just stuck with boring old Calibri, Helvetica, Georgia, etc but this is starting to really hack me off.\nI tried loads of other free/cheap PDF viewers and even a couple of PowerPoint viewers and get the exact same problem even when the PPT is saved with fonts embedded. Before anyone mentions it Slideshark has the same problem not supporting these fonts.\nNow here's the funny thing. I downloaded the latest version of Adobe Reader for iPad and all fonts render perfectly. However Adobe Reader isn't the best presenting tool as you can't display full screen and the file caching isn't the best.\nSo, are there any apps for iPad which have the following properties?\n\n\n*\n\n*Allows PDF or PPT files to be viewed full screen and renders ALL fonts in the same way that Adobe Reader for iPad does?\n\n*Caches files nicely so I don't have to wait for the next slide to load (like GoodReader does)\n\n\nI've tried installing the fonts on my colleague's Mac to create the PDF from Keynote and converting the slides using various other PDF creation tools but that leads to other problems (I haven't found a PDF writer which allows the slides to be created to the correct aspect ratio. Using Keynote for iPad doesn't help because I am limited to the iPad fonts only.\nIf it helps to explain my problem I have uploaded font test slides to my Slideshare account: http://www.slideshare.net/thesaundi/font-test-10088015\n\nA: It might be that the fonts aren't being embedded into the PDF, that would cause them to not render correctly on a computer that did not have the fonts installed and Adobe Reader may be faking the look of fonts that it doesn't have. Open the PDF in Acrobat on your PC and in the \"File\" menu select \"Properties...\" and then click on the \"Fonts\" tab. Each font listed should have a remark like \"Embedded\" or \"Embedded Subset\".\nIf that is the case, you may have to change your PDF creation settings (not sure how you are creating the PDFs, so I'm no help there) to make sure that all fonts are embedded.\n\nA: You could try Presentation Link, a great app for interactive presentations on the iPad. It's available in the App Store, let me know if you like a promocode.\n\nA: Well as for the fonts problem, technically a PDF being a container file format the fonts can be embedded in the file, but this is not an automatic thing, it has to be \"checked\". \nUsually this is called \"font subset\", and although you don't need to, it's preferable to set it to it's maximum, usually 100%. If it's set to 0% (or any other similar setting), fonts might not be included in the file.\nBut usually a good PDF reader will render the fonts correctly when they are embedded.\n", "Q: Fill rectangle with diagonal lines (stripes) in keynote I want to create a rectangle in keynote which is filled with diagonal lines, like shown in the example image.\n\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: After some searching about, it would appear that you cannot do this in Keynote; however, you can import an image (like the one in your question) and then do what you will with it.\n\nA: Old post, I know.\nJust searched for the same question. Read this post, did the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open blank keynote document\n\n*Draw a vertical full height line, 2 point, in my preferred colour.\n\n*Duplicated the line a dozen times\n\n*Selected all and duplicated the selection a few more times\n\n*Used align to make sure all lines were vertically positioned the same way\n\n*Moved one line to the right edge of the slide\n\n*Used distribute to set the distance between objects\n\n*Used rotate in the inspector to rotate all lines 45 degrees\n\n*Exported as a pdf\n\n*Opened my original document and dragged the pdf into it\n\n*Double clicked and used default keynote tools to mask to the shape I wanted\n\n\nHope that helps someone else.\n", "Q: Can I share a 3G connection from an iPhone/iPad by creating a Wi-fi hotspot? I've been wondering about this for awhile. So, is it possible to create a Wi-fi hotspot from an iPhone or 3G iPad?\n\nA: Yes, it's called \"Personal Hotspot\" by Apple and works on iPhone 4 and 4S. Here is an Apple support doc on it.\nNot available on the 3G iPad though, as far as I know.\n\nA: The short answer is yes. Longer answer, there are two ways of doing it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Legal (using contract from your mobile provider)\n\n*Jailbreaking (using Cydia)\n\n\nThis Gadget Review article covers both methods, using both the built-in iOS Personal Hotspot option and the Cydia MyWi app. Other articles include this MacWorld article and the AT&T Wi-Fi main page. Wired has a Verizion-specific article as well.\nFor the iPad 2, it looks like it's possible with the MyWi app, according to this page. Have never tried it myself though.\n", "Q: Text expansion for Mac OS X Lion? Is there a built in feature into OS X Lion which is similar to iOS 5.0's shortcut feature? For example, by default if you type \"omw\" on the iPhone, it gets expanded to \"on my way\" automatically.\nI know that there are probably 3rd party solutions, but I would prefer using an Apple solution.\n\nA: You can do this in System Preferences in the Text tab of the Language & Text pane:\n\nYou can toggle on/off the built-in replacements, as well as create ones of your own.\n\nA: As mentioned, OS X (since 10.6) has built-in text expansion capability. However it's also worth mentioning TextExpander.\nIt does the basic replacement that the built-in utilities do, but it offers a lot more functionality and customizability. For example, you can have it insert variables like the current date, move the insertion point (e.g. you can wrap something in a tag but have the insertion point stay after the word, not the closing tag), or insert new lines.\nFor many people the built-in capabilities will likely be enough, but TextExpander could be consider the Pro version.\n", "Q: Using Airport Express as a wireless repeater - Significant drop in wireless speed I'm trying to extend wireless service to parts of my office that aren't getting a reliable connection. On one end of the office, we have an Airport Extreme, with a 60Mbps internet connection. In that room and the surrounding rooms, I get a pretty reliable 57Mbps or so on speedtest. \nI've set up an Airport express as a repeater to carry the signal further down the hall. While near the airport express, I get full wireless connection (full bars), but on speedtest, I'm getting about 18Mbps. \nWe then tried putting in another Express half way in between, and saw no significant improvement. \nCould the Express be bottlenecking the connection that bad?\n\nA: Any time you try repeat a wireless signal you'll sacrifice data speeds. \nThis \"feature\" isn't highly pushed on the Airports because of this. I've seen no consumer wifi routers/repeaters that do this well. \nYour best bet is to run an Ethernet cable and setup the airport express as a second access point. Use the same SSID and password as your Extreme and your devices will pick the stronger signal. \n", "Q: What is a good 2D scrolling shoot-em-up for iPad in the style of Gradius V I'm looking for a shooter in the style of Gradius V, meaning futuristic, weapon power ups, frantic action.

There is some .m4b files from the iTunes store that I bought, and from what I understand, these files cannot be converted into .mp3, unlike the .m4a files.\nTo put those files into another audio player that I have that can only support mp3, I need to convert it... and it looks a way to do it is to burn the .m4b into a CD-R, by first creating a playlist, and then burn the playlist into a CD-R, and there are up to 7 times that can be done.  Then, once the CD-R is made, then it can be ripped as an .mp3\nBut since I don't really need a CD-R version, so an extra CD-R will be wasted.  Is there a way to burn the .m4b onto some virtual CD-R and then rip it instead?  (for Snow Leopard or Lion).  But if it involves installing questionable shareware that might slow down the machine overall, it may be not as desirable -- so if it is shareware, it'd better be a reliable and trustworthy shareware.\n(as a side note, the .m4b protection doesn't seem very strong... since anybody can just burn it and rip it, and then it is DRM free... the cost is only about 10 cents for CD-R, for about 16 songs... so the use of .m4b as a protection together with the ability to burn it onto a CD-R is somewhat strange to me)\nUpdate: it seems like we can use a CD-RW and write it and erase it... and there won't be any wasted CD-R...  the only thing is I don't know how many times they can be erased...\n\nA: While you can write data to a .iso file in Disk Utility, I don't believe there's any way to do so with the burning functionality built in to iTunes.\nYou could however get a program like Virtual CD-RW, which presents itself as a CD-RW drive to the OS, which iTunes could then burn to. The reviews for that program don't look great, so I'd suggest getting the demo version and seeing if it works for you before paying any money.\nRoxio's Toast Titanium may include similar functionality, but I couldn't find any definite confirmation of that on their site.\n", "Q: iOS5 split keyboard not playing well with some apps, including Apple ones I have noticed some issues with the new split keyboard feature of iOS 5.\nFirst, the when in split-keyboard mode, the screen content is not moved up despite the keyboard covering the content.\nAs you can see below, in iMessage, it's difficult to read the most-recent messages without moving the keyboard up higher.\n\nSecondly, it doesn't seem to play well with some apps, in this case, the new Facebook iPad app.\nIn split-keyboard mode, the \"Send\" button is removed and the return key adds a new line instead of sending a message, making it impossible to send a new message without changing the keyboard mode.\n\nThe \"Send\" button is present with the standard keyboard:\n\nI realize that the latter issue is no doubt an bug on part of the Facebook, but the iMessage bug seems like a pretty big oversight.\nAre there some configuration options I'm just not seeing?\n\nA: The new keyboard abilities in iOS 5 could cause quite a few problems for applications which haven't been updated to detect their use. In order to move content out from under the keyboard when it is shown, the application receives a notification whenever it is shown or hidden. However, if the keyboard isn't in the default position, the notification that it is about to be shown is not sent. Instead, there is a new notification which indicates that the keyboard is about to move. If you go back and forth between the default position and split/undocked, the application receives notifications that the keyboard moved, as well as notifications that it is shown and hidden. My guess is that Apple chose to have the status be \"hidden\" if the keyboard is not in the default position because it might not be necessary to move content in this case, but it doesn't make a lot of sense. \nWhat you are seeing with iMessages is that the keyboard is \"hidden\", so the app doesn't move its content. If your keyboard was undocked but not split, you wouldn't be able to read whatever was under it at all. Since it is split, the system adds a partially transparent box in the middle so that the entry field isn't floating on nothing, so the message is only mostly blocked.\nThe situation for Facebook is similar. It automatically hides the send button when the keyboard is hidden. Since the system doesn't send the \"shown\" notification if it is split, Facebook doesn't show the button if it's split either.\nThe only thing you can do is file a bug with Facebook and Apple. For Facebook, load the page for it in the App Store and click the \"Send Feedback\" button. For Apple, go to https://bugreport.apple.com/ (free developer account required). It is possible that Apple meant to send \"shown\" notifications for the split keyboard, in which case that is the real bug, but they should figure that out when they investigate the hidden messages.\n\nA: You can move the keyboard up the screen so it doesn't block what you want to see. \nupward swipe on the keyboard icon on the lower right corner when the keyboard is split.\n", "Q: How can I convert 60FPS videos to work on an iPhone 4? I have some 60 FPS videos ranging from 640x480 to 1280x720.  I was able to convert a few using H.264 Baseline @ L3.0 and sync them to Photo Albums on the iPhone and they clearly are playing back at 60 FPS.  The smoothness is incredible.  \nApple's tech specifications claim the iPhone can playback up to 30 FPS, but evidently this is not a true limitation.\nMy problem is most 60 FPS videos I have, fail to sync in iTunes and I get a message saying this video is not playable on the iPhone.  \nWhat do I need to do differently to make 60 FPS videos reliably convert to iPhone 4 compatible H.264?  \nTools like MediaCoder iPod Edition and Any Video Converter tend to either force 30 FPS (A.V.C.) or crash outright when handling 60 FPS videos (MediaCoder which uses the x264 project to do the converting).\n\nA: I use Handbrake to encode my files to iPhone and iPad specs.  Handbrake has presets for all the major Apple devices, so you don't even need to know the specifications for each device.  It even differentieates between an iPhone before the iPhone 4 and an iPhone 4.  Works every time for me.\n\nA: I found out the solution!\nIt seems the iPhone 4 can play back 60 FPS H.264 videos up to 640px horizontal resolution.  Anything beyond that gave me the dreaded format not compatible error when syncing to iTunes.\n640x480 or 640x360 work great and boy are they lifelike.  \nI successfully used QuickTime (Export using MPEG-4 Video settings), and MediaCoder iPod Edition to convert videos to the 640xXXX @ 60 FPS H.264 format profile as high as Main@L3.1.\n", "Q: Send message on iPhone 4S using PC Bluetooth keyboard? I have successfully paired a Bluetooth keyboard with my iPhone 4S, and it works great for composing messages.\nHowever, I can't find a way to send a message from the Messages app using just the keyboard.\nI've tried Enter, Alt+Enter, Ctrl+Enter, and Shift+Enter.\nThere's a thread on Apple's site that covers the same topic - one of the posts alluded to a \"send\" button on a full-featured iPhone keyboard.\nDoes anyone know what extended key code or combination the \"official\" keyboard is sending?  If not, is there a way to find out?\n\nA: In Mail for the Mac you can send the current message using Shift + Cmd + D, so maybe try that? \nOn my PC keyboard, the Win key sends a Cmd in Mac OS X, yours is probably the same.\n", "Q: iTunes Home Sharing never updates Play Counts or Ratings from iPhone Ever since iTunes introduced Home Sharing, the Preferences dialog has had a checkbox titled \"Home Sharing computers and devices update play counts\".  But this option has never had any effect whatsoever that I can discern.\nYou can rate the songs on your iPhone and the rating will appear to stick on the iPhone, but when you disconnect from the Home Sharing, the ratings you've just made are discarded.  And the Play Counts in your iTunes library will never update.\nCan this be fixed or is this just a huge bug since the beginning of Home Sharing?\n\nA: This has always worked for me and here is a test I just performed on iOS 5.0.1 (9A405) and iTunes 10.5 (141).\n\n\n*\n\n*make a smart playlist of songs rated higher than three stars and browse it on your iOS device\n\n*the only bug I see is sometimes when you go to settings, the current stars don't show, but when I change the rating it is reflected in the iTunes listing almost instantly (the change pushes over WiFi back to the iTunes and causes the display to refresh after each change).\n\n*play counts get updated at the end of the song, last played is updated correctly.\n\n\nIf this doesn't work for you, you may have to isolate the error in your setup. I would start with a new user account and moving 5 songs to a clean iTunes library. Be sure you quit iTunes on the \"main\" account if you use fast user switching - home sharing might not handle two copies of iTunes running on the same computer well. Another quick check might be to disable any firewall software on your mac. Something is off on your setup and without more testing, it's hard to guess exactly what.\n\nA: After home sharing has been enabled on the desired devices and the main iTunes library, open up music on your device (iPhone/iPad) Down the bottom click on 'More' and then 'Shared' and select your main library. This library then loads to your device which can be shared over your local network.\n", "Q: If I use a prepaid SIM card from AT&T retail store in iPhone, do I get 3G or GSM service?

The Enable 3G and Cellular Data options must be turned on in the Settings.\nSidenote: AT&T requires purchasing a data package for their smartphones; no Pay per use.\nAs AT&T also had a GSM network, you could also access that (and GPRS/EDGE as well).\nUsual Terms and Conditions will probably apply.\n", "Q: Logitech K750 keyboard: § and < have switched places I have Logitech K750 (solar thingy) attached to Lion.

US?\n", "Q: Motion Detection with iSight/FaceTime Camera I'd like to use my iSight camera to detect motion, and if any motion is detected, record a short movie (until the motion stops) for security purposes\n(ok, I want to spy on my cat). \nIs there software available to do this? Free/open is preferable.\n\nA: I've used iAlertU before: takes a screenshot, not a movie, but it is free.\nThere is also SecuritySpy which does record movies but isn't free.\n\nA: I am using witness app successfully for 3 months now. It's incredible. If you combine it with the iPhone app, you can even receive the alert when you are on a remote location.\nThe only bottleneck is that it costs something like 39 USD. But i would definitely recommend it, it works pretty well!\n\nA: iCam looks like it will work.\n\nA: There is a Mac app called iSentry which does what you are asking. \nIt requires a set schedule to work. It saves video or picture to a designated file on your computer and can send email alerts (which works well with the iPhone). \nYou have to be sure not to set the sensitivity too light, or something like a ceiling fan will constantly set it off.\n\nA: I've been using the free iVideon (https://www.ivideon.com/), which let's me record unlimited hours of video locally and has all the schedule and motion detection features. One can pay subscription fee to save the video on the cloud, but I didn't really need it. It works on both Mac and PC.  \nAnother excellent CCTV app for Mac is Sighthound Video, but the free version is limited to 1 camera, and costs $60 for 2 camera license. \nAs for open-source, I recommend Shinobi Video (http://shinobi.video/), but the install process may be more advanced for average users, and requires typing a lot of commands in the Terminal. It is written in javascript/node.js and while it's a little rough around the edge, it's free and works. It's also very promising.\nAnother open-source is ContaCam, and while it is for Windows, it works in Mac with a free software called WINE.  Only thing I didn't like was that the scheduler was too simple, and I needed more advanced scheduling that iVideon had.\n", "Q: Does iTunes 10.5.0.142 not support the original iPhone? I have the original iPhone and I cannot seem to get it recognized by iTunes 10.5.0.142. I followed the troubleshooting advice at http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/assistant/itunes/, but it did not seem to help. Is it no longer supported by iTunes?\n\nA: iTunes does support the original iPhone, there is no where it is written in the requirements of iTunes 10.5 that says that iTunes requires this version of iOS or this particular iPhone or even iPod in order to sync with it. All Apple music devices should be supported unless other wise noted.\nThe only point where it may matter is if you have updated to the latest version of iOS from a newer version of iTunes (e.g. greater than 10.5.0.142) and then are attempting to use that updated iOS on an older version of iTunes 10.5.0.142 in this case. \nIn that situation there may be issues communicating between the two due to apple changing protocols or who knows what else between versions of iTunes and iOS. I suggesting updating to the latest version of iTunes, and then contact Apple or their discussion forms if the problem persists.  \n", "Q: Upgrade SATA connection on MBP 3,1 When replacing my HDD in my MBP 3,1 with a SSD (SATA3), I noticed that the SATA1 cable can be fully removed.\nThus I thought, that it might be possible to replace the SATA 1 cable by a SATA 3 cable in order to boost my SSD use.\nHowever, I do not know whether this is supported by the Logicboard... Any idea?\n\nA: My best suggestion is that you try. Worst case it will downscale to SATA1/2 speed if it's all it can handle.\nThe easiest way to determine if your board will support the speed of SATA3 is to have a look at your Serial ATA settings in system information and check your link speed. It will show the supported speed and negotiated speed.\nI have a MBP 6,2 which does support SATA3 on the board. I know my MB 3,1 only support SATA1, however it was always a low spec model compared to the MBP range and it may have been limited to save cost.\n\n", "Q: Install XCode on Lion fresh install I just received a new Mac, shipping with Lion. There is no install CD or DVD. Where is Xcode ? Do I have to use the App Store and create an Apple ID to get it? \nWhat about X11 ?\n\nA: Correct. Xcode is only available via the App Store to non developers here. Registering an Apple ID is free and any email address can be used. \nAlternatively, if you are a registered developer you can download the DMG from the Developer site here* \nX11 is still a standard part of the Lion installation.\nAlso, note when registering an Apple ID for the App Store you are not required to provide credit card details as seen below. The option for none is available.\n\n* Developer Account Required\n\nA: Indeed, you now need a credit card to get access to the App store. As of Dec 5, 2011, I see no \"None\" option. Either it has changed recently, or it depends on your IP's geographic location. Changing the \"billing country\" does change a few payment options, but after trying a few different countries, including the US, there is still no possibility to continue without a CC or equivalent service.\nHowever, if you have an ID giving you access to https://developer.apple.com/downloads/, you can search for Xcode there. I was able to download xcode_4.2.1_for_lion.dmg with my free Apple ID without updating it to add a credit card.\nI hope this is not a \"loophole\" they will quickly \"fix\"!\nAlso note that this \"installer\" is at least as misleading as the one from the App store. After you have downloaded and opened the usual .dmg file, you see the expected .pkg file: \"InstallXcodeLion.pkg\". But after you have done the full standard install of that .pkg, nothing is actually installed! You only \"installed\" the real installer: \"/Applications/Install Xcode.app\".\n", "Q: How do I keep the new line/line break/end of line in a file consistent across mac and windows I use DropBox on both a windows and a mac.\nWhenever I add lines to a .txt file on my mac and sync it with DropBox to my windows, the \"new lines\" are skrewed up when reading the file on my windows, and vice verse.\nMy mac insists to use it own form of new lines even so that the file was created with a different type of new lines. The end result is a file with mixed new line types.\nI know that new lines are different on windows and mac os x (and on linux for that matter) and I know that this is the problem.\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline\nI would expect textedit in OS X to detect the type of new line used and stick with it.\nIs there anyway that I can accomplish that ?\n\nA: Which editors and viewers do you use?\nThis topic describes how to set newline in BBedit and Textmate. Also you can use TextWrangler and Notepad++ which are freeware\nPS: I commonly use Vim in Windows and Mac (MacVim). In this editor I do \":set fileformat=dos\" to convert to CR-LF\n", "Q: How can I activate the text preview in Finder's column view for an arbitrary filetype or document type I really like the preview functionality that Finder offers in the last column of the column view. However, not all filetypes or document types are associated with a preview. \nFor example when I have a file INSTALL (without file extension), the document type of this file is just Document and the preview column only contains an icon. \nHow do I change the behavior of Finder in such a way that a text preview is displayed for the file INSTALL?\n\nA: Column previews in Finder are in fact provided by QuickLook, not Preview – as are the icons displaying the file contents, the CoverFlow icons and the QuickLook preview proper you invoke by pressing Space or Cmd+Y on a selected file.\nQuickLook uses plugins to display file contents – a piece of code rendering the file contents and telling the QuickLook server it can do so (see the QuickLook Programming Guide if you want the technical details). You need plugins because files can be binary data – without knowledge of its structure, no representation of the file is possible – or textual data that needs processing – HTML for instance, which you’ll probably prefer to preview rendered, not as raw source. They also must be limited to specific, known file types (to be precise: Uniform Type Identifiers, or UTIs for short) for this exact reason – a rendering plugin for HTML will not give you a usable preview for a JPEG. OS X provides quite an impressive default collection of these plugins (located in /System/Library/QuickLook), and applications you install add their own (located in the application package itself, /Library/QuickLook or ~/Library/QuickLook). You can also add some yourself to those two last locations.\nIn the case of text files without an extension, the problem is OS X’s built-in plain-text QuickLook plugin is not assigned to these as they do not correspond to a UTI it handles. However, there is a 3rd party QuickLook plugin adding that functionality: QLStephen. Just download it and install it according to its installation instructions on GitHub and you should be good to go.\n", "Q: Which SSD to choose for a white late 2009 macbook Currently there are many reviews on SSDs, and different types of SSDs as well.\nWhat I would like to hear is what cost effective SSDs that exists that aslo has TRIM support and will work well with Lion.\nThe System Information app says that the SATA interface can do 3 Gb and the link speed is 1.5 Gb (on the stock 250GB HDD)\nI would like around 256 GB.\nWhich models and brands would be a good choice for this model ?\n\nA: If you don't use your optical drive I would recommend Crucial M4 128GB as best bang for a buck SSD from big name manufacturer. And buying SATA 9.5mm caddy from ebay to put SSD inside it. So you still have your 250GB HDD + 128 GB of SSD\n\nA: I'd highly recommend looking at Other World Computering for this purchase.  I've purchased an SSD from them and they were awesome in helping me figure out which one would work best.  They have great sales and support.  They have a nice option of looking at what is compatible with your mac.\n", "Q: To TRIM or not to TRIM on a non Apple installed SSD in Lion According to a source in OWC they do not recommend enabling TRIM on Mercury Extreme SSD\nas TRIM is only supported by Apple on Apple installed SSDs. \nThey suggest that I am better off using the build in data management in the SSD.\nIs this scientifically founded in any way ?\nHave any of you had success, failures or some knowledge with this ?\n\nA: I now know a bit more.\nI see three options after reading a lot of forums, AnandTech and Wikipedia:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I buy a Mac with a pre-installed SSD I'll get the power of TRIM for \"free\". The Apple supplied SSD are not the fastest on earth but they sure is way faster than your normal hard disk. Also, Apple uses well known more or less OEM.\n\n*Buy an aftermarket SSD, clone, install and go. You will loose the power of TRIM but the SSD is still way way faster that your hard disk.\n\n*Buy an aftermarket SSD, hack you kernel, run some kind of Trim Enabler for non Apple approved devices or what ever it takes, then clone, install and hopefully go.\nIf my mom, dad or average Joe were to buy a new Mac I would absolutely recommend #1.\nI'd personally go with #1 or #3 if I were going to buy one for my self.\nIf my mom, dad or average Joe were to upgrade an existing Mac I would have to go with #2 as Apple currently doesn't sell any SSD online (not as far as I can see anyway) and I would not recommend #3 in any form or factor.\nIf I were to upgrade my own Mac I would start with #3 and revert to #2 in case of any problems.\nI hope this didn't end up as a buyers guide as prohibited in the FAQ as I have not recommended any specific model or brand. My intentions is only to share some personal thoughts.\nAll in all, I will try TRIM for myself on my own SSD but I would not recommend anyone that doesn't understand the risk or are unable to fix any problems by them self.\nAny thoughts ? Am I way off scale here ?\n\nA: It depends on which SSD you have. Anand of Anandtech (one of the most comprehensive and knowledgeable sites on SSDs) has confirmed (and others have reported) issues using the TRIM enabler on the latest generation of Sandforce-based SSDs (the SF-2281 controller), which includes newer OWC drives, and many others (including OCZ Vertex and Agility 3, some Corsair Force drives). I have an OCZ Vertex 2 (older generation Sandforce) and haven't tried the TRIM enabler.\nI'd recommend caution - unless you're finding noticeable performance degradation, probably best to stay away. SSD controllers are still somewhat unpredictable, and it's unlikely Apple has done testing of its TRIM implementation with drives other than the Toshiba and Samsung ones it uses.\n\nA: This may not answer your question but it should reassure you.\nI put an OWC SSD in my last MacBook Pro, pre-lion and used it for a year. No trim and it was controlled by an early SandForce disk controller.\nI had absolutely no problems with this SSD, none. It was so fast it blew my mind and gave me another year of use on an older machine. Since then OWC/SandForce has come out with a firmware update to that original SSD although I sold the machine before that happened and now use a machine with an Apple-supplied SSD running with Lion and no doubt trim enabled.\nTruth be told, the Apple supplied SSD isn't quite as fast as the OWC although both are so much faster than a hard disk the difference doesn't bother me.\nI would not worry about the trim issue but I would back up your SSD daily as anyone with any kind of storage (HD, SSD or flash memory) should do.\n\nA: I have a hard time believing TRIM actually causes a problem with any particular SSD. If the SSD manufacturer thinks that the TRIM command causes a problem, they can choose to not execute the command in their firmware. I guess it is possible that OS X's TRIM command is somehow non-standard, maybe it violates some part of the ATA spec for TRIM, but I also find that pretty hard to believe.\nI've been using a Intel X-25M (gen 2) for a couple of years now, and I used the TRIM Enabler many months ago. I got better performance after enabling it and doing some quick maintenance and I haven't had a single problem. I haven't run the enabler for Lion yet as the utility doesn't yet support it.\n\nA: The problem I've found with my 2007 Macbook/Lion and an OWC SSD (Mercury) is frequent 30 second freezes.  They were so frequent with FileVault2 that I had to stop using it and they are much more frequent when OS X starts swapping pages (so I have to restart applications as soon as memory used gets over 3.95GB.  It's not so bad that I've gone back to a hard disk but it is annoying.  I've got 35GB free on the drive and leave it idle for long periods but there's clearly some kind of low-level issue between the controller and OS X.\nThere were similar reports with lots of beach balls when people tried enabling TRIM on non-Apple SSD's under Snow Leopard.  \nOWC Tech support says that they have not had any similar reports but I'd guess that few people are running their SSD's on systems as old a mine.  \nThis is a long-winded way of saying I think it depends on both the SSD and the Mac model so unless you find someone with the exact same configuration, you won't know the answer until you try it.\n\nA: I've had very strange behavior and failure of an Intel 510 in a 2011 Mac mini; with no TRIM support. I've just enabled TRIM for that drive and that seems to have solved it. Check out my post: SSD behaves strangely, then suddenly fails, but checks show no problems\n", "Q: No Shark on OS X Lion? I can't find Shark on OS X Lion. The most recent Xcode is correctly installed, but I can only see Instruments. Has Shark been made obsolete by Instruments ?\n\nA: Correct.\nShark was replaced with Instruments. There is a set of tools from Apple called CHUD that does still include Shark.\nIt's available here. It does require you to have a Developer Account to download. However there has been limited success in getting it to work on Lion.\nIt's safe to assume that Shark has bitten the dust.\n", "Q: Is there a way to view Game Center information on OS X? Is there a way to view Game Center information, such as achievements or friends, on OS X (or any other desktop OS), or is Game Center only accessible from iOS?\n\nA: For the moment it only works on iOS. I would assume there will be plans at some point for Apple to release it to the Mac, however nothing has been mentioned publicly. Apple has also not provided any web interface for it, and I suspect if they do it will be part of iCloud.\n", "Q: Clicking on \"print\" does nothing I've connected to a remote network printer and attempted to print something, but clicking on the \"print\" button does nothing, as if the button wasn't clicked. It doesn't close the window, doesn't alert about any problem, doesn't report a successful printing, and the paper doesn't actually come out. Checking the printer queue also shows no jobs.\nOf course the problem may well be bad printer setup, but I don't see any report about any problem. Opening the printer configuration shows it as idle and ready.\nDoes anyone know how can I troubleshoot this issue?\n\nA: I still couldn't find out how to troubleshoot this issue, but removing and re-installing the printer as a generic postscript printer helped.\n", "Q: Charging iPhone 4S from closed MacBook Air Should an iPhone recharge when plugged in to a MacBook Air which itself is plugged into its wall charger?\nMy MacBook Air was closed and plugged into its wall charger.  The green light on the power cord was lit.  I plugged my iPhone 4S into the MacBook Air USB port under the MagSafe connection.  I went to sleep.  When I awoke seven hours later, the iPhone was at 30% charge.  I thought it would be at 100%. \nIs something wrong?\n\nA: I am not sure about MacBook Air, but in my MacBook Pro (Mid 2010) it will charge my iPhone if the MB is active (powered up and not sleeping) and it will also charge my iPhone when sleeping, but only if the iPhone was plugged in before the MB went to sleep.\nIf your MB is shut down (not active & not sleeping) it will not charge your iPhone.\n\nUPDATE\nOne of OS X/MacBook updates must have changed something at some point. Now, when a MacBook is plugged and sleeping and you plug in an iPhone, the MacBook will silently wake up, start charging the iPhone and fall back to sleep. It all happens with closed lid.\n\nA: If you plug in when the computer is asleep or shut down (even if it is connected to mains) iPhone will discharge slowly\nCharging iPhone requires 1000ma which is more than the standard 500ma draw from a USB port. To allow a high current device to take more than that it must negotiate with the host machine, which will not occur if the machine is not active.\nYou used to be able to look in your console logs while connecting iPhone to see the negotiation happen. Not sure if this is still the case\n\nA: It will only charge when the laptop is active, eg. not sleeping. Prevent sleeping your computer (you will need to leave the lid open and possible adjust your power management settings), or use the adapter for the iPhone to plug it into a wall socket directly. I'd go for option 2, save the electricity.\nI recently also stumbled upon the following accessory, it's pretty neat and probably would serve you well: http://twelvesouth.com/products/plugbug/\n\nA: Looks like with the introduction of the authentication chip in the Lightning cable Apple is requiring the Macbook Air (MBA) to be up and running to charge your iPhone. \nI found that by using a USB-Lightning adapter on an old 30-pin USB cable the laptop charges my iPhone 5 from standby. Tested it a number of times.\n", "Q: How can I get rid of duplicate TV shows in my iPad’s list of Home Sharing shows on my Mac? I’ve got a Mac mini running as a media server-type thingy. It’s running Mac OS X 10.6.8 and iTunes 10.5. I access TV shows on it via my iPad (running iOS 5.0) using Home Sharing.\n(The Mac mini is plugged into an Airport Extreme via ethernet, and the iPad accesses it over wifi.)\nA little while ago, the list of shared TV shows on my iPad seemed to get a bit screwed up. Several seasons of one show were listed several times, and seasons of shows sorted after that show don’t appear.\nI’ve disabled and enabled Home Sharing on the Mac and the iPad, restarted iTunes and the Mac, killed the Video app on the iPad, and restarted the iPad. Still, the list is screwed up.\nHowever, the list of shows is fine on the Mac mini, and on my primary Mac when accessing the TV shows via iTunes. So I’m assuming it’s an iPad problem.\nHas anyone else come across, and found a fix for, this problem?\n\nA: Unfortunately Home Sharing videos on iOS has had some issues for a while now - TV shows out of order and in some cases duplicates. To my knowledge there isn't a proper fix, but some people have suggested that signing out of Home Sharing then back in again on the iPad (i.e. removing your username and password) can fix it some of the time.\n\nA: I just fixed this issue on my iPad. Shared TV Shows had many repeats, one couldn't navigate. This all came from the items I'd ripped from DVDs that I'd purchased on put into iTunes.\nSetting the Artist and Album Artist fields to something appropriate for the show fixes it. (select the similar shows in iTunes and use Command ⌘ + I to edit them all at once) \nDone!\n", "Q: Is there a way to make Lion's scrollbars visible on mouseover them? I have started trying the \"Jump to the spot that's clicked\" option under General System Preferences because I'm pleased by Lion's vanishing scrollbars but they complicate finding the current location before scrolling.\nThere is however one serious problem with the \"Jump to the spot that's clicked\" option : You'll never even see your current location in the document, because scrollbars only become visible when selected, which makes returning challenging.\nIs there an option or tool to either (a) show the scrollbars on mouseover, or else (b) always show transparent scrollbars.\nIf not, can anyone point me towards the most relevant Cocoa documentation? I should be able to implement this myself but any tips might save considerable time.\n\nA: I don't think there is a way to do either of your choices built in, and I don't know of any tool to do them for you. The only way to get this ability in every application would be to have a plugin which is automatically loaded into every application and replaces the default scrollbars. A possible workaround is to scroll just a little bit, so that the page doesn't move much. This will cause the scrollbars to become visible, and they won't hide again as long as either you are moving the mouse on top of that window, or you have the mouse above them. This means you can scroll a little, then move the mouse on top of them, and not worry about them disappearing.\nIf you want to try to implement this yourself you will probably need to create a custom NSScroller subclass, and find a way to make NSScrollView use it instead of the default class (I think NSScrollView has a private method to create a default scrollbar which you could override, but you will have to find it yourself).\n\nA: Jeff, you might find something here that will help. \n", "Q: Can you (semi-)automatically rate all songs with at least X plays with Y stars in iTunes? After reconsolidating my music collection in iTunes, I’m curious if there is any way to programmatically set star ratings based upon the number of plays, but only for songs that I have not yet rated?\nSpecifically, I'd like to set all songs with >1 plays and 0 stars, to 3 stars.\n(3 being the average in that I didn't care enough to rate the song lower because I hated it, higher because I liked it, because I was doing something else at the time.)\nAn AppleScript that I can run occasionally would be sufficient – this way I can passively set song ratings based upon an apathetic impression of the song :).\n\nA: Create a smart playlist in iTunes with criteria set to all of\n\n\n*\n\n*is Music\n\n*rated less than 1 star\n\n*play count greater than whatever count you want\n\n\nCheck “update automatically”. Make sure the contents conform to the list of songs you want to rate automatically.

Someone I know copied a file into a directory over another one and hit \"replace\" accidentally. Is there any way to recover the older version of the file on Mac OS X Leopard 10.5.8?\nEDIT:\nTime Machine was not running at the time.\n\nA: If there was no backup, then I'm afraid that file is gone.  That's exactly why you should always be backing up.\n\nA: This is one of the scenarios that Time Machine is made for.  Hope your friend had it running.\nIf so, then simply navigate to the directory where the file lived in Finder.  Then select the Time Machine icon from your menu bar and choose \"Enter Time Machine\".  The space-themed time machine interface will appear and you can travel back in time to before you (oops, your friend) replaced the file.\n\n", "Q: Command line (or other way) to change proxy config in easy way At the company I work at we use the proxies to connect to the Internet. This works fine until I have to do XCode simulator work(in UIWebView, not Safari browser), at which time I have to turn off all the proxies.\nBut if I do this, I can't connect to the Internet in my mac book. So, I have to change it frequently. It is so boring. \nI have to frequently access this System Preference to change these settings:\n\nSo, there are any easy way to change it with a keyboard shortcut? Can I create a command line script and start it with a keyboard shortcut? Is there a way to make the XCode simulator work with a proxy? Any ideas?\n\nA: No need to create a script:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a proxyless network environment: in the Network pane of System Preferences, click on the “Profile” drop down and select “Manage Profiles…”. Duplicate your standard settings (by clicking on the cog wheel button at the bottom of the list). Give the duplicated profile a unique name (“Proxyless”, say). Disable all proxies in the settings for that profile.\n\n*Assign a keyboard shortcut to your new profile: in the Keyboard pane of System Preferences, create a new Application shortcut for “All Applications”.

My users are requesting that we set up a conference room Mac mini (2009) for videochats using Skype.  \nSince iSights are no longer reliably available (and I'm not going to give up my personal one), has anyone tried any 3rd-party webcams to use under OS X, such as any of Logitech's?  Any other brands you'd recommend?\n\nA: Most modern USB webcams support a generic interface called UVC (Universal Video Class). OSX supports most UVC drivers out-of-the-box (true for me in Snow Leopard) so sometimes there aren't even any third-party drivers to install. (In fact, most third-party webcam \"drivers\" only install useless add-ons that bloat your system.)\nLogitech is very good at providing compliant UVC devices, so they're a good starting point.\nI have a Logitech C525, and it works great at 720p with its built-in microphone, using both Skype and Facetime. No additional drivers required.. plug-and-play!\nOlder webcams that do not support UVC will require drivers of course. Furthermore, super-new UVC devices may require an extension that OSX doesn't yet handle, obviously drivers are inevitable.\nIf you want a list of UVC-supported devices, see the Linux UVC page. (Yes, I know Linux != OSX, but this list can be used as a starting point of other brands you can try.)\n\nA: Another choice which works nicely with OS X is the Logitech c910.\nin order to have 720p work, as well as a fast connection, you need a relatively fast computer. For example, 720 didn't work on my first gen Macbook Air but does work on my new 11 inch model.\n\nA: I've just bought a Logitech C310 and it works perfectly on a 2014 Mac Mini running Yosemite. It cost about £25. I just plugged it in and made a video Skype call immediately. The video and sound quality are excellent. Please note - Logitech doesn't mention that it works on Mac. It does :)\n", "Q: How frequently is Photo Stream synced to Aperture? I've been experiencing considerable delays between the time I take a photo and the time it shows up in Aperture's synced Photo Stream. Specifically, the photos show up on other devices that consume the iCloud Photo Stream, but Aperture seems to lag them substantially.\nIs there a way to force Aperture to refresh its Photo Stream so that it matches the Photo Stream on iOS devices (and thus, presumably, its state in iCloud).\n\nA: Normally Photo Stream should sync across devices within seconds, so long as the device that took the photo is on WiFi. However, I've also run into cases where Aperture's PhotoStream folder lags in showing recent images. When this happens I've been able to fix the issue by disabling and then re-enabling Photo Stream in Aperture's settings. It will re-sync everything in the Photo Stream folder, and new pictures show up almost instantly.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I have multiple Aperture libraries on my computer, and I often notice that Photo Streams don't sync when I switch to one of the libraries synced with my Photo Stream.\nTo fix this problem, I have success most often when I open up 'Photos' on my iOS device, then open the 'Photo Stream' section. Then, I open Aperture, switch to the Library that syncs to my Photo Stream, and quit Aperture. Open Aperture once more, and a refresh/update should be triggered.\nIt would be nice if Apple just gave a simple 'refresh' button, because the syncing isn't as automatic as it should be, at least as far as Aperture is concerned.\n\nA: And my previous answer was also responding to your question's title: there is no frequency for any of iCloud's services, it is a push-only service (most of it I think). So a sync will only happen if there is change.\nAnd so far, I haven't seen any command or buttons or web page to help reset any of iCloud's services. Had a problem today with a friend's calendars, had to use a backup of iCal pre-iCloud: stop the sync, erase all calendars on iCloud's web site, same on his computer, then restore with the pre-iCloud backup, then start sync again. So either Apple believe there is no need for a reset switch (which would be incredibly stupid just looking at the extreme complexity involved behind the thing), or they haven't implemented one yet. I guess future will tell. For now, it looks like we're stuck at doing this manually...\n", "Q: How do I automatically open a subfolder on a SD card when mounted? My camera has a complicated path to the video files, and I'm constantly plugging it in, and then digging to get the videos.  I just want find to automatically popup to the specified subfolder when the card is mounted.\nI've install DSW (Do Something With from Azarhi), but I'm not sure how to set up Automator to open a new finder window with the specific location?\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: With automator you can do this. It'll open a Finder window with the specified folder selected :\n\nYou could also make an alias of the folder, and when you plug the SD card in you just need to open the alias and it'll bring you to the desired location. Right click on the original folder and Select Make Alias and put the alias somewhere easily accessible.\n\n\nA: Perhaps an AppleScript applet could do the trick, as you can set one to start when a card or camera is connected in the Image Transfer app.\nWhat does a typical path look like? Is the name of the card always the same from card to card?\n", "Q: How do I set an icon for a directory via the CLI? \nPossible Duplicate:\nChanging a file or folder icon using the Terminal \n\nThis is a continuation of this thread from Super User. The question is how to set an icon on a directory. At first I was trying cp -R, which did copy the directory with the icon, but it also copied every file and subdirectory in the folder. Then Keith Thompson suggested that one of the invisible files inside a directory might be responsible for the icon (because cp -R would preserve those/bring them with the copy) so I tried copying the 'Icon?' invisible file from a folder with the desired icon to new directory (newly created with mkdir) but that didn't work. He said to ask here, because this is more geared towards Mac- and UNIX-based questions. In that last post, he also suggested the .DS_STORE file  (which I've seen, but I think stores which files to display) but I may try copying that into a new folder too...\n\n\n*\n\n*Empty directory is created\n\n*No invisible files\n\n*Regular files are put into the folder, '.DS_STORE' appears.\n\n*Icon is set manually on the folder, the 'Icon?' file appears.\n\n\nDoes anyone know how to set an icon on a directory through the shell?\n\nA: You can create a shell script and name it something like mkdir_WithIconFrom\n#!/bin/sh\nmkdir $1\ncp $2/Icon\\r $1\nSetFile -a C $1\n\nThis will create a directory at the first path you specify on the command line with the icon from the existing directory whose path you specify second on the command line, assuming the target directory has a custom icon.\n", "Q: Can I move app purchases from one Apple ID to another? Can I move apps purchased with one Apple ID to another Apple ID? I am looking at purchasing a used iOS device and I want to be able to keep all the apps that are on the device (with permission of the original owner of course). How can I do this?\n\nA: You can't, as Apple doesn't provide this ability.\nFrom Apple's support document:\n\nYou cannot merge two or more Apple IDs into a single one. You can, however, use one Apple ID for iCloud services and another Apple ID for store purchases (including iTunes in the Cloud and iTunes Match).\n\nYou can keep using all the old apps, but they won't update without the original password for the original Apple ID. In practice, you will eventually tire of the prompts or delete the apps in question. In the short term, you can use them all without needing the other account name or password.\n\nA: When you buy a used iPhone, just ask a previous owner to delete this phone from his devices at icloud.com > Find iPhone. If you don't restore this iPhone to factory settings all the apps will be kept on this device and you'll be able to use them. Enter your Apple ID details into iCloud and App Store, iTunes Store in Settings. You'll be able to download new apps using your Apple ID and keep apps downloaded by previous owner at the same time. The only thing you won't be able do is to update apps purchased by the other guy.\n", "Q: How can I keep a Java-based pop-up open even when its parent page is closed? I'd like to run the Java client for Runescape but want to quit Safari while the Java pop-up is open. How can I do this?\nMy idea was finding out the URL of the client and running it through the java terminal command, but I'm having huge difficulty location the URL. =/\n\nA: I tried looking a the source, but the website developer has embedded the applet information inside a bunch of JavaScript.  Also, even if you had the jar(s), if the applet requires communication back to the server, it would be a real pain to get it running.\n\nFor future reference, if they hadn't gotten all creative with the applet code, you could have simply run this command line:\n$ appletviewer http://world87.runescape.com/\n\n\nWhat I recommend is to create a dedicated Fluid App for the website.  It's super easy, just point Fluid at the base URL, and it creates a dedicated application wrapped around the website.  The coolest thing is that you can then simply launch your game directly from Applications.\nFluid is 100% free, and I am not affiliated with them in any way.\n\nA: Well, this won't answer the question but will solve your problem: use the downloadable version of Runespace.\nThen, for the question itself: you couldn't do what you're asking for, since Safari is responsible for the Java plugin. The only way would be to download the applet code and use the command @OverZealous gave.\n\nA: The runescape client is running as part of Safari so you can't quit Safari without killing the client. But you can close hide the main Safari window (e.g. with Cmd-H) at least which will keep Safari running and the client open as well.\n", "Q: iTunes crashes when I press refresh on the podcast pane I'm using Mac OS 10.6.8 and I guess I've updated iTunes recently to 10.5 (141).\nI pretty much only use iTunes to get my daily fix of podcasts and now it won't get new episodes and just crashes when I ask for a manual update.\nI'm not syncing to any device and I've to tried to reset the store cache at the Advanced Preferences (no result).\n\nA: It looks like after the last iTunes update a second empty Podcast item appeared on the left side column. The original Podcast pane started crashing as described on the original question.\nI've delete the original Podcast item from the left column (it seems the application treated it as a sort of legacy playlist). And re-subscribed manually to all my podcasts (the new subscriptions get to appear in the new item).\nAfter some frustration, it all seems to work again now.\n", "Q: Secondary click in Lion with two fingers OR bottom-right corner click I just did a clean install of Lion on my 2010 MBP. It seems as though in the system preferences for the built-in trackpad, I have the option of setting the secondary click gesture to \"Click or tap with two fingers\", \"Click in bottom right corner\", or \"Click in bottom left corner\".\nPrevious to this fresh install, I had simply upgraded from Snow Leopard where I had been able to initiate a secondary click either by a two-finger tap or a click in the bottom right corner. That setting was preserved when I upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion. When I simply did a fresh install of Lion, it's now either one or the other. Not both.\nDoes anyone know how I can get the \"both\" behavior back?\n\nA: Sadly, I don't think it's possible to do that without a third party solution. Two popular applications that allow you to tweak the touchpad and mouse are Magic Prefs and Better Touch Tool.\n\nA: Run the following six commands, by pasting them into Terminal.app. You can paste all six lines all at once. (the last two lines aren't required on older versions of OS X, but there's no harm including them) Remember to press the return key:\ndefaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad TrackpadCornerSecondaryClick -int 2\n\ndefaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad TrackpadRightClick -bool true\n\ndefaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.trackpad.trackpadCornerClickBehavior -int 1\n\ndefaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.trackpad.enableSecondaryClick -bool true\n\ndefaults write com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad TrackpadCornerSecondaryClick -int 2\n\ndefaults write com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad TrackpadRightClick -bool true\n\nImportant: now reboot your Mac. \nWhen you log back in, you will be able to right-click both with a two-finger tap, and by clicking in the bottom right-hand corner.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Why does BBC Radio Player fail in Safari on my Mac?

They didn't even know Visual Voicemail existed.\nIs there a way to enable it?\n\nA: Nope.\nVisual Voicemail needs to be activated by the service provider as it uses their services. It requires some work on their side, so I would imagine they need a big group of people wanting it.\nOut of interest, this Wikipedia article briefly covers the topic. There is no open standard for this feature, so it hasn't been deployed on a lot of networks due to the service provider having to provide the required interfaces.\n\nA: Hi if you go to this page on the Apple website you will find a list of carriers that support Visual Voicemail. \nNot all carriers have Visual Voicemail.

Here are some possibly relevant facts:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm using Terminal with the default settings; the character encoding is set to UTF-8 and \"Set locale environment variables on startup\" is checked.\n\n*the output of locale in the shell is:\nLANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ALL=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\n\n\n*TextWrangler's default encoding is UTF-8; trying to reopen the file in any other encoding just makes matters worse.\n\n*I'm running OS 10.6.8.\n\n\nUpdate\nIn response to the comments, here is some more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*The output of od -tx1 test.txt is:\n0000000    6c  65  61  cc  83  6f  2e  70  6e  67  0a  74  65  73  74  2e\n0000020    74  78  74  0a                                                \n0000024\n\n\n*If I do echo leão.png > test2.txt the text shows correctly in TextWrangler\n\n*Opening test.txt in TextEdit displays: leaÃÉo.png\n\n*Opening test.txt in jEdit displays: leaÃÉo.png\n\n*Opening test.txt in AlphaX displays: leaÃÉo.png\n\n*Opening test.txt in emacs from within terminal displays: leão.png\nI'd really like to be able to work with non-ASCII filenames from within the shell. How can I get this to work?\n\nA: I might not be able to fully solve your problem, but I can explain some of what's going on. The shell is behaving correctly; TextWrangler is not coping correctly with a slightly advanced requirement.\nIn test.txt, you have an a (garden-variety lowercase letter A) followed by a combining tilde (Unicode character U+0303). Combining characters generalize characters with accents. For all intents and purposes, ã (U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A followed by U+0303 COMBINING TILDE) should be equivalent to ã (U+00E3 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH TILDE).\nQuite possibly, if Unicode was invented now, only combining characters would exist, and we'd always use a; but Unicode also has many characters for compatibility with earlier existing encodings. Because these are the characters almost everybody uses, many programs do not support combining characters so well, if at all. In particular, it looks like TextWrangler does not support them at all and shows a “I don't know what this is” mark instead.\nGenerally speaking, OSX prefers decomposed characters (i.e. letter + combining accent). In particular, as far as I know, all file names are normalized to this form. Normalizing file names (i.e. making sure that if there are several possible forms of a file name, then a specific one will always be used) is very useful, because it avoids being unable to find leão.png when you're looking for leão.png. (You don't see a difference between the two? Good, your browser handles combining characters correctly.)\nThe ideal solution would be for you to use an editor that handles combining characters correctly. If you want to stick with TextWrangler, make sure you have the latest version, and if you do, contact the authors for support. With TextEdit, jEdit or AlphaX, there's hope yet: they're showing the file as Mac Roman instead of UTF-8; try to switch them to UTF-8.\n", "Q: How to import contacts from Samsung E1170?

I know that many people jailbreak their iOS devices. Is there a risk involved with jailbreaking? If, so what? Can you brick your device by jailbreaking? What's the worst thing that could happen?\n\nA: If you modify the OS, you might not be able to upgrade to an Apple iOS update as soon as it is released, and keep your non-stock modifications.\nSome stock App store apps may refuse to run if they detect a modified OS.\nThere are certainly more ways with a jailbroken OS for you to crash or brick your device (and more ways for a rogue or buggy app to do so as well).\nYou device may also have a different set of security vulnerabilities than a stock OS iOS device, which may or may not be as widely reported, and which Apple might or might not be patching.\n\nA: The absolute worst case scenario is you are forced to revert back to a non-jailbroken device and may lose content if you did not make the necessary backups. That is bar-none the worst case scenario. It is also of note that Apple will turn you away should you bring in a device that is jailbroken. They have a firm stance against the practice and state that it will void your warranty. Of course reinstalling iOS and removing the jailbreak corrects this matter. Additionally, upgrading to future iOS versions will remove the jailbreak (OTA updates in iOS 5 cannot be performed).\nYou cannot \"brick\" your device, rendering it inoperable by using any jailbreak utilities. Repeat, you cannot \"brick\" your device anymore than you can render a Mac inoperable by messing with OS X. A simple restore returns the device back to its original state. The ill-gotten rumor likely started due to the protection schemas in place that safe guard the mobile device from tampering (i.e., breaking Apple's closed system). Apple has set up a gauntlet a jailbreaker must bypass in order to open iOS. During those stages, problems may occur, leaving the phone in a state of \"flux.\" This occurs when the device is left without a working operating system. In this state, it will not graciously look to iTunes for a fix. But rather sit in this state of limbo and require additional software to \"bring it back to life.\" It is, however, always possible to restore it and any coming forward to claim otherwise are only bringing to light their own ignorance and ineptitude at correcting the matter. I think an apt analogy would be to look at someone trying to jump start a car. It's possible to boost any car, but some may reverse the cables, or fail to clamp the negative to a proper ground. Sparks fly and the ECU shorts. Surely if the person knew what they were doing, they would have jump started the car without issue.\nJailbreaking itself does not pose an inherent risk. There have been cases where a jailbreak actually allowed the patching of a known security risk (jailbreak me.com first exploited this security hole and then subsequently provided means to repair it well before Apple stepped in correct the matter upstream). These cases, are however, rare. Most of the time, a jailbreak relies on similar exploits to deliver itself (as is the case with iOS 5.0). So while the jailbreak is safe, it may force a user to remain on a compromised version of iOS and unlike the initial PDF exploit that made jailbreakme.com possible, may not have the means to patch it.\nThe biggest threat is the expansion of capabilities made famous through Cydia. The most prolific is the installation of SSH (a secure file transfer protocol) without changing the two accounts on the device (root and mobile). They both share the same password (alpine) and without changing them, a mischievous hacker only needs to get the device's respective IP address. After which, they will have root access (full control). This, of course, is easy enough to overcome and will likely only affect the most ignorance of user bases. Surely you cannot claim a house is unsafe because the residents refuse to lock their door!\nLastly, the installation of apps through untrusted Cydia repositories may also be a cause for concern. Jailbreaking a device removes Apple's signature checks, so the device is only too happy to run most code thrown at it. While Apple stringently approves what code is given the authority to run on your device (and sandboxes all apps for that matter, greatly restricting their privileges) those checks are removed after the device is jailbroken. Moreover, those apps are no longer sandboxed like the ones found on Apple's App Store. It's possible that a user may come across malicious code, but no such cases have been made public. The jailbreaking community isn't bent on malicious intent, but rather freedom of choice. In that respect, they act as paladins, and anyone seeking to exploit their work would be brought to light before long.\nThe troubles affecting jailbreaking essential revolve around ignorance and naivety. For an experienced and intelligent user, they bring no more risk to one's security than a \"locked\" device. And in some cases, may provide the ability to tighten's one's security and privacy (typically made possible by developers that use Cydia to distribute their wares).\nNote: Cydia itself is a reputable \"store.\" The programs found within it's walls are all safe and typically carry some level of professionalism. The problems arise when users register outside repositories (or repos) that carry untested, pirated, or questionable software. Jailbreaking also does not mean iOS is free to run \"cracked\" software found legitimately in the App Store. Those security measures remain intact even on a jailbroken device and must be circumvented separately, outside of the actual jailbreak. Many are confused by this duality and assume a jailbroken device can natively install pirated apps. That is not the case. \n", "Q: iPhone does not show up on iPhoto anymore Since the update to iOS5 my iPhone 3GS does not show up as a device on iPhoto anymore. Before that, iPhoto was working without any hitch. I'm currently using the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz Intel Core i5, 4 GB, Mac OS X 10.7.2\n\n*iPhoto '09 Version 8.1.2 (424) \n\n*iPhone 3GS, with IOS 5\n\n*iTunes 10.5 (141) 64-bit\n\n\nIs there some way to recover so that I can import photos on iPhoto again, or is the software not compatible anymore?\n\nA: Hmm... Apparently, restarting the computer (with the applications not reopening) seemed to get iPhoto to work again.\nI hope there are other ways of doing this.\n\nA: In iPhoto>preferences>general you're able to choose what happens when a camera connects to your Mac.  If you choose Iphoto, your iPhone should appear as you want it to.\nI discovered this in reverse.  When I first got my iPhone, iPhoto automatically launched and by unchecking this feature in Iphoto, it stopped.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: This has been bugging me for a bit. I already had the above it just stopped working. I went into preferences as above and changed it to open something else when a camera (phone) was attached. There's a couple of options in there I don't remember them now. I plugged the phone in and it launched that app ok. So I went back in and changed it to iPhoto again, took the phone off then reconnected and booshka - back to normal. See if that works...\n\nA: Go to Settings.app, then select General. Scroll down to \"Passcode Lock\". Tap it, enter your passcode, and then proceed to turn passcode lock off.\n", "Q: WiFi Failing and Keychain crashing I have a Macbook Pro 13 from about a year ago running OSX Lion.\nWhenever I connect to my school's WiFi, I can't seem to get to the WiFi Login page\nI was told the problem was probably in Keychain Access, but it crashes as soon as I try to open it whenever this is happening.\nUsing Safari or Chrome, I can't seem to get to any websites, it just hangs or gives me a page load error.\nFirefox works though without any issues.\n\nA: A friend of mine had a similar problem. After trying the usual fixes (restarting, removing wi-fi networks, removing wi-fi network interface, resetting PRAM and SMC, deleting login keychain from ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain), I was able to solve the Keychain Access crashing (and wi-fi issues) using a solution from here: http://www.unsanity.org/archives/security/love_tropicana.php\nIn short, remove the wi-fi network (from System Preferences > Network > Advanced > Preferred Networks), then open Terminal and type in these two lines:\n$ sudo mv /var/db/CodeEquivalenceDatabase\n$ /var/db/CodeEquivalenceDatabase.old\n\n(For more information, read the page I linked to above.)\nThen restart, and see if Keychain Access opens - it did for me. You can then delete any passwords or certificates related to your school's wi-fi. Then try connecting to the network again.\n\nA: You have to make sure your keychain is unlocked before removing entries.\n\n", "Q: How can I keep settings consistent between Macs? I use multiple Macs (OS X Lion). There are a lot of settings, apps, and files I'd like to keep synced up between them. Files are the easiest of the lot -- Dropbox + symlinks, Mercurial repositories, and standalone Puppet manifests are all well-understood and simplish tools. Apps are slightly more difficult, but I'm experimenting with Puppet + PackageMaker + Dropbox to meet this goal.\nThat brings us to settings. These are also the most obnoxious since I set some small thing on my iMac, promptly forget, then rediscover the annoyance on my MacBook a couple weeks later and have to comb through Google to figure out what I did to fix it the first time.\nI discovered the 'defaults' command today and have been exploring it, but I was wondering how everyone else solves this? \n\nBy \"settings\" I mean OS-level configurations like changing the number of Spaces you have, setting hot corners, modifying mouse behavior, etc. App-level configuration would be great, too, but I'm assuming a lot of different apps do this different ways. Oh, how I miss real Unix and its flat configuration files...\n\nA: 1) For most OS X applications, settings are kept in ~/Library/Application Support/ and ~/Library/Preferences/\nIn Terminal.app:\ncd ~/Library/Preferences/\n\nplutil -convert xml1  *.plist\n\nAnd then open any of the plist files in a text editor.\nOr, if your text editor of choice is BBEdit, just open the plist files using the bbedit command, which automatically converts them to XML.\nOr, just use defaults read on any of those plist files - just leave off the .plist. For example, if you want to read com.apple.dock.plist use defaults read com.apple.dock\n2) The defaults command is your friend.\nI setup a function that will log all of the defaults write that I make:\ndefaults ()\n{\n    if [ \"$1\" = \"write\" ]\n    then\n\n        LOG=\"$HOME/Dropbox/dwrites.txt\"\n\n        echo \"default $@\" >>| \"$LOG\" && echo \"[logged defaults change to $LOG]\"\n\n    fi\n\n    /usr/bin/defaults $@\n}\n\nThat way I have a record of all of my changes that I make on the command line.\nBut, of course, there are lots of these sorts of changes that I don't make on the command line, but make through System Preferences or individual app preferences.\nA few of those are even system-level changes that get stored in /Library/Application Support/ or /Library/Preferences/\n3) Also checkout the networksetup and systemsetup commands.\n\nA: Agree with bmike that there really isn't any one size fits all solution besides migrating the user account or cloning one drive into the other periodically.\nI'd recommend checking out something like SpiderOak for syncing directories. It lets you choose which directories on the machine you want to back up and sync, rather than giving a predefined place to put your files like Dropbox. No more messing with symlinks.\nYou should be able to sync most Mac apps by syncing the /Applications folder between machines. Much of your application settings will reside in ~/Library and /Library. You'll probably want to sync your home folder and any other folder you store data files in as well.\nI have this set up for my home folder, and large chunks of my ~/Library and /Library on two of my machines. I've never tried syncing /Applications, but in theory it should work.\nWith regards to settings you've applied via the command line, I suggest writing a shell script that resides in one of these synced folders, and setting both your machines to run it periodically, through cron or some other utility.\nEvery time you find a new command line setting that you like, add it to the shell script. The script's contents will sync across the 2 machines and since they're both being run periodically, it will update the settings on both machines.\nThis isn't 100%, but it gets me far enough that manually handling the rest of stuff isn't that painful.\n\nA: There really isn't a one size fits all answer, but I can think of four ways to accomplish your task if you care to spend some time setting this up.\n\nMacs are Unix, so simply check in your ~/Library/Preferences and /Library/Preferences into some sort of code control system. You can then do diffs and most plists are text or easily converted into text (using PlistBuddy) so you can isolate exactly what you have changed.\nThere are numerous tutorials available - Penn's wiki on Manipulating Plist files is particularly nice and directed to people with unix skills. \n\nThere are plenty of Managed System software like Apple Remote Desktop or others like Casper if you wish to get software designed explicitly to manage user preferences.\n\nServer accounts would be easy to set up for minimal cost if you have a spare machine (or virtual machine). Again - some work, but mobile accounts do work well for many people.\n\nLastly, don't overlook simply migrating the user account from the mac that is correct to the other mac periodically and just making a system where you are disciplined about how you record the times you change a setting.\n", "Q: How do I rebuild the music library on my iphone? Using iTunes, I updated album names and track numbers on my iPhone. But the music library is stuck using the old values. What gives? How can I get the iPhone music library to update?\nI'm on iOS 5\n\nA: Most probably the music library on your phone got confused.\nRemove the music from your phone and re-add it by\n\n\n*\n\n*either removing it manually (if you are managing manually)\n\n*or unchecking music syncing in iTunes\n\n\nThen sync once to clear the iPhone music library, add your music again and re-sync to relead.\nIf that doesn't work, backup your phone, restore to defaults, restore the backup, sync the phone. That will completely clear any cached data on the phone and allow it to sync \"fresh\" to iTunes.\n", "Q: Apple Official iOS Development Certificate Are there any official certification programs by Apple for iOS App Development?\n\nA: There are no iOS certifications currently listed on the Apple Developer web site.\nThe de-facto industry standard base-level certification is getting at least one non-trivial native Objective C (or Swift) app that you've developed approved by Apple into the iOS App store.\n\nA: Apple does now seem to offer a Swift Certification through CertiPort. Info can be found on the Apple developer site here  and on the Certiport site here.\n\nA: Apple has hyperlinks to all of the topics they do provide certification for off of this page.  At this time it is only Mac OS X IT-related and 'Pro Apps', meaning Apple apps used by creative professionals/iWork.\n\nA: I am not aware of Apple-sanctioned certifications for software development. From the Apple Certifications page there are only two tracks - IT and Creative. Becoming an Apple Developer gives you access to Apple material such as Tech Talk and WWDC sessions, but there is no official certification path as far as I can tell. \nI have read wonderful things about training at the Big Nerd Ranch and at the Pragmatic Studio, but I haven't experienced these courses myself (yet). Both of these places are well regarded in the community and while they do no not offer certifications per se, they still seem like terrific alternatives for training. Hope this helps. \n\nA: While not available initially, Apple has recently partnered with a widely recognised, 3rd party training provider LearnQuest. LearnQuest claims to be an Apple Authorised Global Training Provider.\nClicking the Find a course button on Apple Training website directs to the Apple Authorized Training Schedule page on LearnQuest's website.\nThe App Development Training Program mentioned on LearnQuest lists the following training paths as of this writing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Introduction to Swift 4.\n\n*Introduction to the iOS 11 SDK.\n\n*App Development with Swift 4.\nAll three of them are classroom courses. These courses are targeted towards Software Developers, Software Architects and Technology Consultants.\nNote: The hyperlinks mentioned in the answer direct to the courses available in the current country of my residence.

If it hit Alt+E, it brings up the Edit menu.  Is there an OS X equivalent?\nThis is a handy way to get to those windows and choose an option without grabbing the mouse.  I know there are keyboard shortcuts for things inside those menus (say Command+C for copy).  But, is there a way to simply bring up the menu so I an see what's in there, then choose my option with arrow keys and return?\n\nA: You can do this easily; by default, under System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard, an option involving the \"f\" function keys may be unchecked. If this is the case, check it, and then click the \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" tab. Go to \"Keyboard & Text Input\" and find the command for \"move focus to the menu bar\". Use this command (I believe it's control+F2 or control+F8 by default). Then, use the F key for file, the E key for edit, etc. (or use arrow keys) and hit enter (or down) to show the menu.\n", "Q: Is there a way to prevent downloads of purchased items to iTunes? Is there a way to indicate that I do not want a given item to ever be downloaded to iTunes, but prefer to have it remain in the cloud?\nFor example, if I purchase a TV show or movie, iTunes assumes I want it downloaded to my machine, and will attempt to do so several times, even when I cancel the download and delete it from the downloads list. In general, after several tries, iTunes seems to finally give up, but it's hardly a convenient process convincing it to do so. This the issue repeats (automatically) with purchased TV series.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*Click iTunes Store\n\n*Go to the iTunes Store Home\n\n*On the right column is the text \"Purchased\" with a little bubble that says (new). Click \"Purchased\"\n\n*Find the show that you don't want.\n\n*Click it and then a window should pop up containing the show\n\n*There should be an (X) next to the show. Click That\n\n*iTunes will ask you whether you want to make the show hidden. You do.\n\n*Repeat for all other shows.\n\n\nA: There is no way to designate one specific purchased item to not auto-download and remain in the cloud, but you can specify certain kinds of purchased items like videos, music, books, etc. \nIn iTunes > Preferences > Store Preferences on your computer, make sure to uncheck \"Always check for available downloads\" and \"Automatically download pre-orders\". \nInitiate the purchase on a device other your computer. The simplest way would be to initiate the purchase on a Apple TV, as those purchases will now remain in the cloud and not auto-download to iTunes on your computer. \n\n\nA: Same here,\npurchased on ATV3 and not showing up in my itunes as a purchase - but constantly starting the download after a login on itunes. \nI switched all auto downloads off and even shut off TV Series and Movies on my itunes to show up - still did not help...\n", "Q: Sync iCloud TV show purchases between AppleTV and iTunes How do I sync AppleTV purchases from iCloud to iTunes?\nI recently purchased the most recent episode of Psych on my Apple TV but am unable to transfer it to iTunes.\nI was able to do this with a previous episode but can't recall how.\nI've tried going to Store > Check for Available Downloads... but it says I don't have anything to download:\n\nI am using the same Apple Store account between the Apple TV and iTunes.\n\nA: Go to the iTunes store homepage and click \"Purchased\" in the Quick Links section.

They obviously do not know to whom the command is addressed, therefore this happens.\nYou have two choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable infrared remote reception on your Mac. On your Mac, go to 'System Preferences' and then 'Security & Privacy'. Select the 'Advanced' button in the lower right corner. Check the box that says \"Disable remote control infrared receiver\" and click \"OK'. Apple documentation.\n\n*Pair your remote with a particular device. To pair a remote with your Mac, follow instructions above and select the 'Pair' button to the right of the 'Disable remote' checkbox. To pair a remote with your Apple TV, go to 'Settings' > 'general' > 'remotes' from the AppleTV main menu, and then choose 'Pair Apple Remote'. You can pair 2 different remotes with each machine, but you won't be able to pair one remote with both machines. Apple documentation.\n", "Q: How do I force iCal to sync? I've recently set up my Google Calendars to hook into iCal on OS X Lion.  I've noticed though that when I make a change in iCal, it doesn't sync instantly to Google Calendar.  \nI'm sure that iCal will eventually sync when it gets a chance, but because I don't leave iCal open all day, I'd like the ability to force it to sync before I shut down.  \nIs this possible? \n\nA: The equivalent in macOS Sierra's Calendar app is View -> Refresh Calendars.\n\nA: As far as I am aware, invoking iCal's \"refresh\" function, under the Calendar menu should do all server side communication and updates.\n\nRefresh will only update the calendar that hosts the event you currently have (or last had) selected. Refresh All will of course update all of your calendars. This should be a two-way process, and not just pulling down new changes, it should also send local changes back assuming it's not being done automatically.\n", "Q: How can I easily and individually update the Genre tag for a lot of songs? I am a DJ and I have just got a new Mac and transferred all my music to iTunes. A lot of my tunes do have the wrong Genre assigned mis-tagged (e.g.a tune that is TECH HOUSE is maybe tagged as genre House).\nWhat I would love to be able to do very quickly is go through all my tunes and tag them genre-wise how I would like them.  I have so many  tunes that I actually ned to hear them before tagging.  My dream is to be in the 'music' section of my tunes, play a tune, have a little listen then hit a keyboard shortcut that would assign/change the genre to what I think it should be. \nAt the moment, I listen, use a shortcut to get me to 'GET INFO' use the mouse to click in genre, delete it, then type in the new tag!\n\nA: As a quick-fix you might just add the \"Genre\" field to the list of displayed columns (Cmd-J or right-click any column name) and edit the value there directly (double-click on the current value):\n\nThere are also applications available who try to clean song metadata automatically (e.g. Tagalicious) but they only work for \"well-known\" tracks and will probably not tag the genre the way you need it.\n", "Q: Huawei device pairing with Mac I am trying to connect my Huawei phone to my Mac. I get it as a new device and I can see it in the file manager. Now I would like point my Mac to some drivers of this small Huawei device. (I have them as .ini files or as .exe for the full installation package.) The thing is that I am programming for Android and did it easily on Windows (using Mac just for a couple of weeks). In Windows there is a great feature like \"find device\" and then just point it to .ini driver files. Is there any similar feature in Mac? I have installed some applications on Mac, like Huawei driver, Huawei modem something, also some mobilepartner application, but still nothing. Is there any way I can use the adb to connect to my device?\n\nA: Your device should \"just work\" on a Mac. To use adb to connect to your device you do it as usual, meaning you would have to install the android SDK for mac, then enable debugging mode on your phone, and use the Terminal command-line app as you would on the Windows command-line. \n", "Q: Fastest way to get an image from Skitch into OmniFocus? What's the fastest way to get a screenshot from Skitch into OmniFocus?\nWhen you drag and drop an image into OmniFocus, it only creates a link to the image, rather than embedding it. One way to do this is to drag and drop the image from Skitch to finder, and then from finder to OmniFocus by holding down the command key, but this is tedious, especially when I need to do it many times. Another way is to drop onto finder, and then right-click and choose to attach and embed in OmniFocus, but this too is time consuming.\nIs there any way to drag the image directly from Skitch into OmniFocus and have the image be embedded in the task?\n\nA: AFAIK, you can't do it without AppleScript. \nHere is my way to do this:\non adding folder items to this_folder after receiving added_items\n    try\n        repeat with i from 1 to number of items in added_items\n            set this_item to item i of added_items\n            tell application \"Finder\" to set file_name to (name of this_item)\n            tell application \"OmniFocus\"\n                tell quick entry\n                    open\n                    set NewTask to make new inbox task with properties {name:file_name}\n                    tell the note of NewTask\n                        make new file attachment with properties {file name:this_item, embedded:true}\n                    end tell\n                    activate\n                end tell\n            end tell\n        end repeat\n    end try\nend adding folder items to\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Save this AppleScript to /Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts/Add File To Omnifocus.scpt You must use root access.

I have the keyboard set to \"British\" and my locale is Australia, but neither of these seem to affect the spelling suggestions.\n\nA: Spelling is determined by the keyboard setting you're using. Go to Settings > General > International > Keyboards, and make sure that English (UK) is added. It also helps to remove the US keyboard so that you don't accidentally get stuck in that. \n", "Q: My MacBook Pro 15.4\" (A1286 - Late 2008) trackpad is missing clicks and generally not working I notice it when I'm highlighting text as well. Halfway through the a selection it will unselect. It only seems to click right at the very bottom now.\nDo I need to replace or clean it?\n\nA: The battery might be swelling and pushing up against the bottom of the trackpad. If this is the case, as soon as you remove the battery it will work as expected (assuming no permanent damage has been done).\nReplace Immediately! Swollen batteries can be dangerous.\n", "Q: How do I run the iPad simulator to test a website on my mac I've developed a web app which is having some weird issues on iOS safari on my iPad.\nI've never developed an iOS app, although I am a developer (c#) and have downloaded the latest xcode dev tools (just never got round to it).\nIs there an easy way to just get the iPad sim up and start browsing the web on it on my mac?\nthanks\n\nA: In recent versions of Xcode it can be found here:\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications/iPhone Simulator.app\n\n\nA: In  Xcode 6.1.1 (Yosemite & Mavericks) it can be found here:\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/iOS Simulator\n\n\nA: Install XCode, then the simulator is located at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/Simulator.app\nOnce it's running, go to Hardware -> Device, then pick the iOS version and device.  It will boot up, then you can start Safari.\nUpdate: XCode.app is now a package rather than a folder. In Finder, option/right click on XCode.app and select 'Show Package Contents', then follow the path down from there.\n\nA: On OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 and xcode 7.0.1, the simulator is located at\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/Simulator.app\n\n", "Q: How can I stream all audio from my imac into a PC on the same network? I would like all iMac sounds to go through my network into my PC speakers.

I am trying to downgrade to ios 4.3.3 but each time I try this, my iPod Touch 3g goes in a recovery loop with an all black display and I can't do anything but restoring ios5.\nIs it possibile to downgrade to 4.3.3?\n\nA: If you have your SHSH's saved for 4.3.3, then you should be able to get back to 4.3.3 with some help of TinyUmbrella (it also has a button to get out of recovery loop, maybe you can try that?)\nIf you don't have your SHSH's saved, there is no way you can get back to 4.3.3 (or any firmware version for which you didn't save your SHSH's, for that matter...)\nOfficial download links are to the right of this page: http://thefirmwareumbrella.blogspot.com/\n\nA: You cannot get back to older iOS versions because Apple no longer signs them digitally.  The only way to get back further than the ones they're currently signing is using TinyUmbrella where it will sign the package for you.\n", "Q: How can I use iCloud's 5 GB space with a 64 GB iPod? I am trying to understand iCloud backup and how the data from a 64 GB iPod might fit in a 5 GB account.\nI just updated to iOS 5 and the latest iTunes. Now, when I sync, I get a choice to backup to iCloud (instead of backing up to the computer). I see it offers me 5 GB of space, but my as stated my iPod is 64 GB.\nDoes this mean I need to pay for 64 GB of space to be able to use iCloud? What is 5 GB going to do for me?\nAlso, I have an iPhone. Is it 5 GB per device or 5 GB per Apple ID? I use the same Apple ID on all of my devices.\n\nA: A fairly good article to check out in this case is iCloud: Backup and restore overview \nYou receive 5 GB per iCloud account, but you can have separate iCloud and iTunes Store accounts setup, thereby sharing music and apps, while keeping the backups apart. \nFrom the article:\nWhat is backed up:\nYou get unlimited free storage for:\nPurchased music, TV shows, apps, and books\n\nYou get 5GB of free iCloud storage for:\nPhotos and videos in the Camera Roll\nDevice settings (for example: Phone Favorites, Wallpaper, and Mail, Contacts, Calendar accounts)\nApp data\nHome screen and app organization\nMessages (iMessage, SMS, and MMS)\nRingtones\n\n", "Q: How should I demonstrate a functional iOS application to a client? I hope this is the right place to ask this question, since it isn't actually programming related.\nI work at a company which is taking the first steps in iOS development, and we realised that there is a problem on how to demonstrate a fully functional developed application to a client. \nThe situation is quite simple: \nLet us say some company (referred as \"client\") asks us to develop an application about whatever. The client can be geographically distant or even in another country. The client owns its set of iPhones/iPads and at end of development, it would like to run the app on their phones, so they can see it works and is fully functional.\nSo, the question is how to do it? How to make an app demonstration to this client on their iPhones?\nWe haven't done this before, but we realised that there is no other way to install an app from any source apart from the Store, or compiling it from a developer Xcode environment. I mean legally. We also understand that it takes quite a lot of time to deploy an application to the Apple Store, in order for Apple to check it out and other stuff.\nPlease, correct me if I said something wrong, but we are in the baby steps of this, and we would like to understand a bit more about all these issues. \nSo, are there any technical solutions to this problem? I mean, which do not involve sending phones by mail, and anything like that.\n\nA: Yes, there is a way to install apps on stock OS iOS devices, other than from Apple's App store or when tethered directly to the developers Mac.\nAn enrolled iOS Developer can sign an app with an Ad Hoc Distribution certificate and a mobileprovision file which includes the UDID's of the client's devices.  You can email this app and provision file to a client.  Then the client can install this app (and the mobileprovision files required for it to operate) using the iTunes app on their Mac or PC.  Or the client can download direct to their device from a (OTA) web page using HTTPS plus a manifest plist.\nThis is very commonly done for beta testing of iOS apps.\nAd Hoc provisioning expires at least once per year, so these apps are only temporarily useable.  A Developer is limited to no more than 100 UDIDs max total per year, so can only do this for a very limited number of clients.\n\nA: You need to add the UUIDs of your client's devices to a provisioning profile in the Apple Developer Center, then you archive and sign your app with this profile. \nThe easiest way to distribute the .ipa you get then is probably to use a service like TestFlight or if you want to use your own server the app iOS beta builder. \nThe biggest problem with iOS beta distribution is that you are limited to 100 devices per account and year, but other than that it is pretty straighforward.\n\nA: This is very easy to do once you get into how app signing works in iOS.\nIn a nutshell either you or your client will get a certificate from Apple that lets you list certain devices that can run your apps that will be side loaded directly from your build machine and not going through the store.\nXcode will use that certificate to sign the app when built and it won't matter so much how the app got onto your demo device as long as the provisioning profile on that device matches the certificates on the app you built. You can send the app via email to the device, shared as a file to iTunes for the client, or even set up a server to deliver the app over the air (OTA) using a web server.\nYou will have to do some reading and learning on the developer site as well as some trial and error as you learn how picky the certificates are and how things can and will break. There are many books and tools to help you out - but I've found making some efforts to attend cocoa / Xcode / iOS events in your community to be extremely valuable for learning the ropes and having resources to ask and be asked yourself how to get over hurdles.\n", "Q: iMac very slow wifi while macbook is fine I currently have a MacBook Pro (Lion) and my iMac (Leopard) sitting side by side. The MacBook  Pro connects to a wifi network and speeds are as they should be. The iMac has serious problems: it doesn't find the same networks, it gets connection timeouts when trying to connect to the wifi network, when it finally connects the speed is so slow that it's unusable. When I ping yahoo.com I get results of between 100 - 1500ms and sites take minutes to load.\nHow can I start debugging this problem?\n\nA: Here is a general plan to start debugging this problem.  Post your results and we'll help you figure this out.  I'm running an iMac with Snow Leopard and these steps have helped me.\nWrite down key data for each machine for each wifi connection.  I've included my data below.\nGo to the iMac and hold down the option key while clicking the Airport icon in the menu bar.  Write down the PHY, BSSID, Channel, RSSI and Transmit Rate.\nMove over to the MBP and gather the same information.\nPhy Mode this tells you if you joined the network as a B, G or N connection.  I'm on an Airport Extreme N network using the 2.4 Ghz frequency.\nBSSID - This is the access point you are logged into.  They are likely the same on each machine.  If they are different, your machines are logged into different access points.\nChannel - This is the channel each machine is using.  In my case, my neighbor and I were both on channel 1.  I changed over to 11 and my speed improved since I was no longer fighting his interference.\nRSSI - Received signal strength.  Mine is -43 while my neighbor's is -88.\nTransmit Rate - The higher the better.  Mine is 130.  I can't view the neighbor's rate but it's like less due to his lower RSSI.\nIf you see other nearby networks, you can view some information about their signal by moving your cursor over the other network and a small dialog box will pop up with their PHY, BSSID, Channel, and RSSI.  This is how I found my neighbor was using the same channel as me.\nYou can also view this data in System Profiler under Network>Airport.  \n", "Q: Give iOS Developer Program membership as a gift? Is it possible to purchase a one-year iOS Developer Program membership for someone as a gift? I know the Apple ID of the desired recipient, but couldn't find how to offer the program membership.\n\nA: No. Apple checks each developer's identity by checking with their credit card company, so it has to be paid with the developers credit card.\nThere are other ways involving faxing ID to them, but that's rather inconvenient.\n", "Q: Where can I find a pricing guide for used Apple devices? I am looking for a pricing guide for used Apple laptops, desktops, and iOS devices. Does anyone have a recommendation on where to go to find a guide like this? Preferably a free guide.\n\nA: http://www.everymac.com has estimated current price for every model\n(It's at the bottom of the table).\nI'm not sure where they are getting those from though.\n\nA: Check out Gazelle. They buy Apple products, as well as many other consumer electronics.\n\nA: For the most recent price for a particular model in some particular condition, I try to find a bunch of completed sales on eBay with best matching descriptions and pick the median closing bid price.\nNoting the variance in prices is also important, since used devices don't really have any fixed price.  It depends on the buyer, seller, location and date (phase-of-the-moon, last poker hand, etc.).  YMMV.\n\nA: Try eBay or check out Green Star Tronics.\n\nA: I would suggest BuyBackWorld to get the cash trade in value of your Apple products.  Their Apple buyback program lets you sell iPhones, iPads, Macbooks, etc to them instantly.\n", "Q: Cant see MacBook in Windows Network I'm trying to access my MacBook from a Windows PC over the network. The computer is connected to the router, the MacBook is connected to a WAP, which is connected to a switch, which is connected to the router.\nWhen I click on Network on the PC, the MacBook doesn't show up. It has done previously. Sometimes the Windows computer shows in the Finder sidebar and sometimes it doesn't.\nHow can I make the MacBook show in Network [Places] on the Windows machine? And how do I make the Windows machine stay in the Finder sidebar?\n\nA: In my experience there is no quickfix way to get windows and mac machines to always be visible in the others networks list. \nThe best thing you can do is enable Samba filesharing on your mac, then when you want to connect you just type smb://Jonathan's MacBook Pro into the address bar in Explorer (or into the run dialogue).\nTo Enable SMB sharing on your Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Sharing > File Sharing\n\n*Select Options \n\n*Tick Share files and folders using SMB (Windows)\nThis has always worked for me with networking windows machines in Mac environments. \n\nA: Another issue is you might not be in the same workgroup. To fix this go to \nSystem Preferences -> Network -> Advanced -> WINS:\nMake sure his Windows box is set the same. What OrangeBox suggested must be done as well.\n\n\nA: I was able to resolve the issue by copying the name given in the NetBIOS Name field in the answer given by rubixibuc and pasting it into a run dialog, typing \\\\ and then the NetBIOS Name (so in rubixibuc's example the full path would be \\\\MACBOOKPRO-D04A)\nTo open the Run dialog, simply type +R\n\n\nA: Try changing the workgroup name from the iMac and windows PC.

How do I delete the Lion Mac OS X Install Image? I have a one generation old MacBook Air. I upgraded to Lion when it came out. Now I wish to go back to Snow Leopard. I booted from the thumb drive installer for Snow Leopard. There is a Lion installer image that I can't delete. Disk Utility greys out for that partition. It's not the end of the world, but I would like to get that 5 gigs back.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: When booted from the Snow Leopard install drive, you should be able to create a new partition from the partition tab. \n\n\nA: Make certain that you have backed up all of your data before following these steps.\nOnce your bakup is done and confirmed, in Disk Utility's Partition tab, select \"1 Partition\" from the \"Partition Layout\" menu, then click Apply in the lower right corner.  This will effectively erase any Lion install or recovery partitions and leave you with a single volume.\nInstall Snow Leopard on this volume.\n", "Q: iPad app for reading and writing guitar tablature I'm looking for an iPad app for guitar tabs reading and writing.

In OS X Mail, when I enter the name of a person to whom I have sent a previous e-mail, I'm often presented with a suggested e-mail address, corresponding (roughly) to the most recent frequently sent-to person matching the entered name, or part of a name. These suggestions make sense, and I realize that they are coming from my previous recipients list, but what I don't understand is this: often, though the proposed address is associated with a contact in my address book (and is marked as such in the Previous Recipients list), it is not recognized as being associated with the contact in the sent message. For example, if I have a contact, say:\nJoe Stack\njoe@aaa.com\njoe@bbb.com\njoe@ccc.com\n\nand I have been corresponding a lot recently with him at joe@bbb.com then when I begin typing his name in the To field rather than proposing \nJoe Stack\n\nalong with context menu containing a list of all of the e-mail addresses from his contact information, I get\nJoe Stack <joe@bbb.com>\n\nwith no alternate choices of e-mail and no connection to his contact. In fact, in the context menu for this address, I'm given the option to Add To Address Book rather than Show Contact Card (and if I add it, it is added as a distinct additional entry, so that now there are two entries with joe@bbb.com as an e-mail address).\nWhat could be causing Mail to fail to recognize that the joe@bbb.com address is for an existing contact? This behavior has been going on for some time (at least since 10.6) and continues in Mountain Lion.\n\nA: I was having the same issue. To resolve it, I went into the previous recipients list and removed all entries of the offending address, as well as any other email addresses associated with that person. From that point forward, when composing an email it correctly pulled the Address Book entry and not the independent address.\n\nA: This could be due to entries in your previous recipients list. This list is accessed in Mail via the Window > Previous Recipients menu item.\n\nA: Honestly, I believe that this is a bug in mail.app. \nI think that if you report it to https://bugreport.apple.com, they'll give you some scripts to run, and will ask you to send some special logs.\nI know this isn't a \"solution\", but maybe it will help improve the app for all of us..\n", "Q: Bought a new MacBook Pro, how do I transfer the OS X Lion license to my Apple account? I would like to install Lion on a different MacBook Pro in my house, but I can't download/install OS X Lion as it hasn't been linked to my Apple ID. Any suggestions?\n\nA: I think there is a part on booting up a new mac for the first time where it asks you to register with an apple id. If you haven't done that, check in your home folder for something that is a shortcut to register with an apple id. If you already deleted that, or it isn't there, try adding a apple id in the \"Accounts\" section of system preferences (under your picture and name). After you register, Lion should appear under \"Purchased\" in the Mac App Store, which you can redownload on other machines.\n\nA: Well, apart from the obvious solution of simply spending the bucks for Lion in the App Store so you can then legally put it onto all the Macs you own in the future, you could try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup the old MBP (duh!)\n\n*Connect the two MBPs via Firewire\n\n*Put the new one with Lion into Target Disk Mode (reboot with the \"T\" key held down).\n\n*Boot the other one from an medium other than the main boot drive, like an external harddrive or even the Lion MBP you just put into TDM (I think that should work as well). You can do this by connecting the other boot medium before booting and then hold the Option (Alt) key down during boot. You then get a menu where you can select the desired boot drive.\n\n*If you have booted into that alternative boot medium, use Disk Utility to wipe and reformat the usual boot drive of that MBP.\n\n*Then you could use something like Carbon Copy Cloner to then copy the boot drive from the new Lion MBP over to the usual boot drive of the old MBP.\n\n*Finally, select the new Lion boot drive on the old MBP as the default boot drive and reboot.\nSort of complicated for my tastes, but I think that would work. Remember however, that at that point, you have copied over the entire Lion installation from the new MBP and your old installation is wiped out (backup notwithstanding). Thus, you would then have to restore all the files and programs you want to reinstall from your backup, which would take additional time. For a true upgrade installation like you could do with the Lion version from the App Store, you would have to try another solution than mine.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Lion can't see other iOS and OSX devices on the network Context\nAt my house I have one network, and have my iOS 5 iPad and Lion Mac connected to it.\nAt my house, these two devices can see each other on the network.\nAt my girlfriend's house, she has a Snow Leopard Mac, and an Apple Tv 2 with the latest software updates.

If I put a video in a Keynote presentation, and save it as a .ppt file, will the video work in PowerPoint?\n\nA: I just tried it with a QuickTime movie and was able to run the exported .ppt in PowerPoint as well. But this is probably no guarantee that it will work in all cases given the multitude of video formats, codecs, drivers etc. So in your case you probably get the best results if you\n\n\n*\n\n*start with a specific video format/codec on the Mac side (QuickTime and either MPEG4 or H.264 would be my first choice)\n\n*do a test run yourself, maybe involving various target PCs (if this is a scenario you have to be able to work with)\n\n*stick to the setup once you have proven it to work\n\n\nA: I am not sure. The main difference here is that Keynote embeds files within it's own file,  alas Powerpoint does not. But i'm pretty sure Apple thought of that, thus it should export just fine besides the ppt file.\nThe best way to find out is to try it with a blank document in Keynote, import a video, export it as PowerPoint and see the result.\nDid you try it already and did not get the expected result, thus the question?\n", "Q: Fusion Guest OS Opening Files In Host OS MacBook Pro Early 2011 - Mac OSX 10.7.2\nVMWare Fusion 4.0.2\nGuest OS is Win7 64-bit, all the latest updates.

I just upgraded my iPhone to iOS 5 after I did a backup of the device, and during the upgrade another backup was done too. When trying to restore me backup I was asked for a password which I didn't know about and accidentally I deleted the backup file that I created and therefore, I have no contacts, photos, nothing only my apps but as if they were brand new. Please help I need to retrieve my deleted backup file from iTunes and retrieve my contact and photos.\n\nA: Usually the backups are stored in this location:\n\n~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/\n\nJust hop into TimeMachine or whatever your backup solution is and restore the contents of that folder.  \n\nDigging into these files is hit or miss and based on the version of iTunes and encryption settings, they may only be understood by iTunes. There is no easy way to get specific info (like contacts or calendars) from these files. Besides the name of the files are random numbers and letters, so good luck making sense of that...\nAs to the initial dilemma, I don't really understand what happened. iTunes never deleted a backup, unless I did it manually in the Preferences. Do you see some backup files in iTunes Preferences > Devices, especially ones dating before the upgrade to iOS 5? I find it very odd that in the middle of the upgrade it would decide to destroy such important data.\nDo you have a Time Machine backup? Were you subscribing to a sync service like MobileMe, or Google where your contacts and other stuff like that would still be?\nAnd how did you delete the backup files actually?

When phone is hooked to computer itunes only reccognizes one of the photo albums and I can't figure out how to switch...any help out there?\n\nA: Are you running iOS 5?  If so, the new albums you can create in iOS 5 are only for temporarily classifying photos from your Camera Roll.  But once you remove them from Camera Roll, they will also disappear from your Albums.\nThus, there is no circumstance where a photo would ONLY be in your Album and not in your Camera Roll, unless by Album you mean the Sync'ed Photos that have always been available through iTunes.  \n", "Q: How can I get Siri to pronounce Exchange contact names correctly? First of all, I don't use iCloud for my address book on my iPhone 4S; instead, I sync my Gmail contacts (and mail and calendars) using the \"Exchange\" account type. (\"Gmail\" accounts don't sync contacts, so I have to connect via Exchange.)\nThis is all fine and dandy, except Siri pronounces my wife's last name (my last name) incorrectly, and it's driving me crazy.\nI've read every article on the web that I can find about phonetic pronunciation and Siri. Most articles seem to imply that adding a phonetic first or last name will correct Siri's pronunciation (though often people complain in the comments that it doesn't work for them). It doesn't work for me either, and I think I finally may have figured out why, but I'm wondering if anyone can verify this and/or shed some light on how to fix it.\nSiri seems to obey phonetic pronunciation for iCloud contacts, but not for Exchange contacts. Oddly, I've gotten Siri to momentarily use the correct phonetic pronunciation for an Exchange contact, only to immediately revert on second try -- perhaps a result of syncing with Exchange/Gmail?\nHas anyone else had this experience? Does anyone know of a workaround?\n\nA: You can create iCloud contacts that merge with your GMail contacts.  The iPhone will collate the data from both the GMail contact and the iCloud contact.  I have this enabled for Hotmail:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Enabled iCloud syncing for contacts.\n\n*Open Contacts.\n\n*Press the back button (top-left) until you reach Groups.\n\n*Open All iCloud or All from My PC.\n\n*Create a new contact for your wife.

I have an extra pair of speakers. I can connect the speaker to my iPad and listen to music.\nI would like to control my iPad with a remote control. Is there a product that I can use? I'm not talking about a software remote control.\n\nA: There are Bluetooth remotes that can control the media playback functions of an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch—if you can do what you want with the remote on Apple's headphones, these devices should be able to perform the same function. Typically the functions available are play/pause, fast-forward/rewind and volume up/down.\nIf you're using the built-in music player or any app that responds to the iOS media controls (an easy way to check is by double clicking the home button, swipe left-to-right on the task bar and see if the play/pause button works for your app). Because it's based on Bluetooth, the range will be limited to approximately 30 feet.\nThe two such devices I've found are the Satechi Bluetooth Multi-Media Remote Control and the Targus Bluetooth iPad Media Remote (which can also work with an iPhone or iPod Touch). There may be other similar products out there however.\n", "Q: iPad 2 is dead after failed upgrade I upgraded to iOS 5 sometime ago and all was fine.\nLast night I got a message that another upgrade was available, so I followed the prompts.\nDuring the upgrade the connection between my PC and iPad failed.\nNow the iPad will not boot.  It just shows the Apple logo and stops.\nHow do I fix a interupted iOS upgrade?\n\nA: Make sure the iPad is turned off. Hold Home and plugin the Dock Connector cable. If the iPad shows an attach to iTunes screen, you can restore it. If it doesn't, you have to put it into DFU mode. It's a bit tricky, so don't panic if you doesn't manage it the first time. When you're in DFU mode, iTunes will ask you to restore it.\nA tutorial for iPad DFU is this one:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWy2xG0U4u8\nIt's looking as if you would have to have a running iPad, but it does work the same way if it's turned off. This is also true for iPods and iPhones.\nThere is no way to brick your iDevice using software. If you can't get it to work using these two tricks, its hardware is faulty.

I'm having iTunes 10.5 problems (crashes on Podcast refresh) and I've been unable to export the subscriptions (the .opml file generated is empty).\nAre there text-readable iTunes podcast preferences somewhere, so I can copy the RSS URLs to another podcast client?\n\nA: They're in the iTunes .plist-file on a Mac.\nSince you don't specify platform, I can't offer that much. In Windows, they're almost certainly stored in a similar preference file. In Mac OS X, they're not conveniently readable.\nIf you just want to back up your subscription info, locating and backing up the iTunes preferences will do it. If you need to scrape/publish the subscription info, that's beyond my capabilities. Hope this at least gives you a jumping-off point.\n\nA: Under the Library section of iTunes click on Podcasts. Right-click or control-click on one of your subscriptions. Now click on Copy Podcast URL. This will copy the RSS feed of that podcast subscription to the clipboard so you can paste it into a different podcast client.\n", "Q: How can I enable natural scrolling for my trackpad, but disable it for my mouse?

My device refuses to charge both over USB and the charger that came with it.\nI got my iPad 2 with iOS 4.3.5 just about 10 days ago. It has had 2 recharge cycles without problems, now on the third it refuses to charge. Connecting it to a USB port on a PC it shows \"Not Charging\" as it always did, but syncs fine. Connecting it with the charger, the battery icon shows the lightning symbol, indicating that the device thinks it's charging, but even after 10+ hours the battery status never increases by even 1%.\nResearching on other sites and asking friends who own iPads, it seems most people who are having charging problems report that their iPad never even shows the lightning bolt. Mine, however, definitely thinks it's charging, it just doesn't. I tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried charging with a different cable and charger pack from a friend's iPad.\n\n*Did a soft reset\n\n*Did a hard reset\n\n*Did a complete restore back to factory settings (which updated to iOS 5.0.1)\n\n\nHowever, I still cannot charge the battery. Is there anything I can still try, short from bringing the device in?\n\nA: It turns out that it was indeed a faulty battery, and there's nothing that I could have done. I got a new iPad 2 under warranty, and its battery lasts almost twice as long from a full charge as well, so it was in fact broken from the outset.\n", "Q: How exactly do I get Facebook to link my friends to iPhoto's Faces tags when sharing from iPhoto? I'm preparing to upload an iPhoto event to Facebook for the first time (I'm using iPhoto '11 and my Mac runs Mac OS X 10.7), except I can't quite get Facebook to turn iPhoto's Faces tags into links to my friends' profiles.\nBasically, uploading causes the tags on Facebook to show up by themselves without linking to the right profiles. This also means photos of me show up as me... with myself! Like a stunt double, or a clone or something. Anyway, this renders them effectively useless in a sense, as I end up having to manually retag on my browser and remove the tags that came from iPhoto.\nEvery person's face in this event has been tagged, which is one thing, and I've also tried assigning their Facebook email addresses to their contact cards in iPhoto (which is mentioned in this Apple guided tour). I also found this Apple document that suggests signing into Facebook first, then naming faces using Facebook name suggestions. I tried it and then attempted to upload again, but with no luck either.\nWhat exactly do I need to do to get this to work? Or (hopefully not) was anything changed in iPhoto or Facebook that means this integration will no longer work correctly?\n\nA: I bit the bullet, and went with the following 4 Rs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removed all faces from iPhoto who were participating in the event\n\n*Removed my Facebook account\n\n*Reauthenticated my account\n\n*Restored (manually, one by one) the faces, making sure to use Facebook's name suggestions\n\n\nAnd Facebook finally recognized and tagged my friends with links to their profiles correctly. Huzzah!\n", "Q: How can you find out if your iPhone ever got wet? I know that iPhone has some internal sensors that can be used to test if the device was got ever wet. \nApple uses them in order to deny your warranty.\nThe question is how to find out this before sending your device to service?\n\nA: The location of internal sensors varies widely by model, but the iFixit guides do a nice job of calling out some of the indicators that show a soaking amount of water has come into contact with the electronics of the device.\n\n\n*\n\n*On the iPhone 4S - you can see a triangular indicator on step 8.\n\n\nIn practice, just take a lighted magnifying glass to the headphone jack and the 30 pin connector and don't bother taking your phone apart unless you're sure you've got the tools and a static safe environment to avoid damaging the internals.\n\nA: Those sensors are no electrical sensors, but pieces of paper that change from white to red when they get wet. There are up to two spots you can look at without opening the device. Have a look inside your headphone jacket and your dock connector. (use a torch/flashlight as lint or dim light can make these orangish-pink indicators hard to discern!)\nHave a look at this page.\nHere's the diagram for an iPhone 4/4S:\n\n\nA: Headphone jack sensor\n\nYour first sensor is located inside the headphone jack at the bottom. It's the easiest sensor to find and inspect. Shine a flashlight into it and make sure you don't see anything but white. (Red is bad.)\nAs a side note, this sensor can come out or become dislodged occasionally. If you don't see one, just move on and check the next sensor. I wouldn't take it as a sign that the seller is trying to be dishonest (yet).\nDock connector sensor\n\nThe next sensor is a square sensor in the dock connector. To see it, hold the phone screen down in your hand and look inside the dock connector towards the middle. On the upper side you will see a tiny white square (or red square if the device has come into contact with liquid). Make sure this one is white.\nIf both sensors are white, it may not be necessary to proceed any further. The device most likely has never been subjected to water damage. If the headphone jack sensor was missing or you couldn't find one of the sensors, you may want to continue to the next section.\nHow to checking internal iPhone water sensors\nIt may seem silly to bring a screwdriver with you to check out an iPhone but it'll seem a lot less silly when it saves the lost money and headache you'd get for buying a water damaged iPhone 4.\nThere are two sensors on the inside of the iPhone 4 that are easily visible once the back is removed. You can pick up a security screw driver online and a #00 Phillips screwdriver from your local hardware store for a few bucks. You'll need one of the two in order to remove the back.\nIf you're buying a CDMA iPhone 4 off of someone, you'll most certainly need the security screwdriver. Older GSM models still have standard #00 screws while newer ones have security screws. Remove the 2 screws holding the back plate on and gently push the back up and pull it off. This will give you a clear view of the last 2 sensors and a lot of the internals of the device.\nWhile you're checking the last 2 sensors it's always a good idea to look closely at the internals and make sure everything looks ok. You'll want to avoid any devices that show signs of the following:\nObvious corrosion\nTorn cables\nMissing screws\nThe battery tab is torn off\nA large amount of debris or dust inside the device\nIf all those seem good, you'll just need to make sure the water sensors check out okay.\nBattery sensor\n\nThe first sensor is placed directly over the clip that holds the battery down. Again, just make sure it's white and move on the to next and final sensor. If it isn't white but all the rest are, I'd probably still advise against buying the device as the battery or other internal parts could have come into contact with liquid at some point.\nLogic board sensor\n\nThe final sensor is located on a screw holding the logic board in place. If this sensor is white, you're in the clear. If it's not, you'll definitely want to stay away from purchasing the device. This sensor is the closest one to the logic board. If it's red, odds are the logic board has liquid damage and will eventually go out.\n\nA: The page daviesgeek linked to shows the 2 external indicators. There are also two internal indicators.\nI used to work at the Genius Bar. On any phone, we were required to check the two external liquid indicators before working on it. If one of them was red, we had to open the phone and look at the internal ones. If you had one red one external indicator and the internal ones were white, you were cool. If the internal ones were red, SOL- it was considered liquid damage and not covered.\nI've seen phones where the external ones were both white but the internal ones were red too. That would not be covered by warranty either. So if your phone is going to be opened, they'll know anyway.\nOpening an iPhone is super easy. There are two screws on the bottom that you have to remove. If you have a 3G or 3Gs, you can use a suction cup to pop the screen up. If you have a 4 or a 4S, you'll probably need one of those special security screwdrivers, but after taking the bottom screws out you just slide the backplate upward and off.\nThe liquid indicators are on the back side of the phone on the 4 and 4S and underneath the display on the logic board on the 3G and 3GS. You don't have to break the phone down that far to look at them.\nIf it's liquid damaged and you have an Apple store near you, it's probably better to take it there in person because if you're nice they might make an exception for you. Especially if you have AppleCare on your phone.\nIf it's liquid damaged and you can't get an exception, there's a replacement fee of $199 (this cost is in US dollars- just saw the poster's location). They will just replace your phone outright, so back it up.\n", "Q: How can I charge a mobile phone on my MacBook Air (like I used to be able to)? I used to be able to turn my macbook air on, plug in an android phone, then close the lid and the phone would keep charging. Note, this was not the same as charge-and-sleep, which works all the time (like on ThinkPads). There is a link to someone describing this process here:\nhttp://www.gottabemobile.com/2011/07/23/why-i-love-yellow-usb-ports-sleep-and-charge/\nBut, this doesn't work for me anymore. I've managed to replicate this with a friend's android phone on his macbook pro. He's running snow leopard, I'm running lion.\nI'm guessing at some point Apple disabled this. Any ideas how to re-enable it?\nI'd also be curious to hear about people's success with different platforms (i.e., iPhone, etc.)\n\nA: I wish I had a how to but I have a 2010 MBA upgraded to Lion.  Connected my work phone, droid incredible, with the machine on and closed the lid and went to sleep and woke and the droid was charged.  So it is possible just don't know where to tell you to go to make it happen.  Also, meant to plug the MBA into power but forgot to connect the magsafe, so maybe try it without connecting the magsafe see if that was the trick.\n\nA: Looks like your macbook air needs at least 50% battery to charge a phone while on battery and asleep.\n", "Q: How do I \"uneject\" an iPad from iTunes? I have an iPad and I want to sync it via wifi. That works fine. Sometimes I mistakenly eject the iPad from iTunes and then it does not synchronize anymore (\"searching for my MacBook\"). Can I instruct iTunes to search for my iPad again? To undo the eject? I use the newest OS on my MacBook and iPad. \n\nA: I just tested with my iPhone, and I can get it to reappear in the Devices list simply by quitting iTunes and reopening it (waking up your iPad may help iTunes find it faster). If that doesn't work, simply plug it in via USB and it should stay in.\n\nA: You can initiate a sync directly from the iPad, the device will then appear in iTunes again as well.\n", "Q: All photos are gone after updating my iPhone to iOS 5 After installation of iOS 5, once it was done restoring my settings, apps, etc I got an error message -19. All apps restored successfully. But I don't see the photos. I tried to revert to iOS 4.3.3 again but I got stuck again with error -10.\nAt this point, I just want my photos back. After that I can update the iPhone to the latest version. Is there a way to restore the photos from the iPhone's file system? I tried accessing the phone's contents using Ubuntu, there I got error message 15.\n\nA: According to Apple, iTunes should automatically backup your photos and videos:\n\nBacked-up information includes purchased music, TV shows, apps, and books*; photos and video in the Camera Roll; ...\n\nHowever, the format of the backup doesn't make it easy to access those photos. Therefore, you can use a program such as iPhone Backup Extractor which should make it a lot easier to recover data from the backup, including photos. I haven't tried the app, so I can't personally recommend it, but it did get good reviews on CNET.\n\nA: Try searching for previous backup data in iTunes folders:\n\nyour user folder > Library > Application Support > MobileSync > Backup\n\n", "Q: how can I transfer empty space between partitions? I would like to dual-boot OS X Lion and Snow Leopard, because I have a few programs that do not work on OS X Lion yet. \nThat works, but now I have the problem that I have run out of disk space on my OS X Snow Leopard partition, and I would like to resize the partition of Snow Leopard so it takes space from the Lion partition, but in Disk Utility that is apparently not possible...\nIs this really impossible or do I need a special program for this?\n\n\nA: I haven’t tried any way of resizing the partitions through Disk Utility, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. (Before I go on, consider this the ever-important reminder that when fiddling with disk partitions and stuff, have a good backup. And then some. And then another one).\nSo here are my two suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You could try backing up the Snow Leopard partition to two external drives (one for backup, one for the copy). Then delete the original partition, and put in a new one to fill the space. Finally, restore the copy back onto the new (larger) partition\n\n*iPartition from Coriolis Software sounds like it would be able to do what you’re doing. I haven’t used iPartition, but I have used their other product, iDefrag, and that worked fine for what I needed. It costs $46.95, but there’s a free demo that you can try. Not sure what the limitations are, but this seems like the safest option.\n", "Q: Defaults tool equivalent of Ctrl-F7 In OSX one can use Ctrl-F7 to change what the Tab key can move the focus between. By default it is only text boxes and lists but after pressing ctrl-f7 one can move between all ui elements. \nI was wondering if there is a way to toggle this functionality by using the defaults tool.\n\nA: After some searching the equivalent command using the defaults tool is \ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleKeyboardUIMode -int 2\n\nAnyone can verify this by toggling the values and then reading the key value. The default value has a value of 0 and switching it to all ui elements will turn it to a value of 2.\n", "Q: Cant find \"Move Items Here\" option in Max OS Lion? I found online that Mac OS Lion has option similar to \"Cut\" option of windows. I found one link which shows the option as : \nI am using OS Lion, but this option is not visible, even when I copy file/folder.\nAm I missing something or any update?\n\nA: There is a strong hint in the screen shot you posted: Hold down the Alt key. Then the option will appear in the menu.\nOh, and one big difference from Windows: On the Mac, the decision whether to move or copy is made in the second step, not the first: I.e., (1) select file(s), select copy, and (2) move to destination folder, select copy or move item here.\n\nA: Just “Copy” as usual, but when pasting, keep the Option (Alt) key pressed while selecting the “Edit” menu and “Copy selected items” will be replaced by “Move items here”.  Finder will then cut and paste instead of copying and pasting. Works with the keyboard shortcut too (i.e. press Cmd+Option+V ). \n", "Q: How can I use my iPhone 3Gs on T-Mobile? Currently my iPhone 3Gs is on iOS 5.01.  I'd like to use it on the T-Mobile network.  What are the steps required to make it happen?\nI think it's obvious that I need to jailbreak the phone.  However, googling around around it is unclear whether there is a reliable (untethered) jailbreak for 5.0x.\nDo I need to downgrade the OS?  If so, to what version and how?\nAny additional steps I need to take?\n\nA: Tethered jailbreak is available for IOS 5, see Jailbreak iOS 5 5.0/5.0.1 on iPhone 4 iPod Touch iPad with Redsn0w and of course blog.iphone-dev.org.\n\nA: If you are on the stock 5.0.1 firmware, there is no option for you to unlock your iPhone. Ultrasn0w is available for iOS 5(0.1) but you need to have one of these base bands.. 4.26.08, 5.11.07, 5.12.01, 5.13.04, and 6.15.00. The only current supported baseband for iPhone 4 GSM is 1.59.00. \nThere is no option to downgrade your baseband unfortunately. You can downgrade to iOS 4.3.3, but that won't help your problem.\n", "Q: Windows have pinstripes and large corner radius on Lion Somehow, some defaults setting or something in Lion on my MacBook Pro has gotten set terribly wrong, because starting recently, my inactive windows (and certain other window chrome) have gained what I presume to be 10.4 Tiger-style pinstripes.\nBehold the horror:\n\n\nObviously, this is not acceptable in any way. I don't know what I did that made these appear. I've looked through Secrets, but haven't found anything relevant. Does anyone have any ideas?\nEDIT: I just realized that in addition to the pinstripes, windows' corner radii have grown larger, as they were in Tiger and before, as well. What in the world is going on?\n\nA: It turns out that I overlooked the two checkboxes in Secrets depicted below (even though their labels were red and in bold and they are obviously in every way exactly what I was looking for). The second one, \"Use Leopard window values\", was unchecked. Checking it and rebooting restored all windows to their normal appearance. Phew.\n\n", "Q: Downloading, rather than playing, flv files from Safari's Activity window The usual way for downloading youtube's flv files used to be to double-click on the conspicuously largest file in Safari's activity window (cmd-option-a).\nFor some reason doing so now triggers viewing the video using a plugin. The possible culprits are perian and vlc. Disabling perian doesn't help, and vlc does not seem to include a plugin. What to do?\n\nA: Hold Option while you double click on the file to force it to download instead of play. If you have something downloading already (or are using an older version of Safari), you can also copy from the activity window and paste into the downloads window.\n", "Q: How does Parallels handle hard drive usage? I'm used to VirtualBox, which gives the option of either, a) fixed portion of hard drive (i.e. choose 40gb, and 40gb gets taken up in OS X); or b) dynamic usage (i.e. I choose 40gb max cap, and it fills this up as data is written by my VM).\nI have a few problems with these options: \n\n\n*\n\n*for (a), I don't want to lock into 40gb unless I need to (I'm on a SSD, so space is limited).  \n\n*for (b), VirtualBox never frees up space as things get deleted on my VM.  For instance, I may have 20gb taken, then delete 10gb.  The image is still at 20gb.  VirtualBox has ways to resize these, but it is a bit of a pain.\n\n\nMy question: Does parallels do something different that might address my gripes?\n\nA: Parallels allows to compress the virtual hard drive to give unused space back to the host OS. This only works as long as you don't create any snapshots of the virtual OS and don't use the Recovery functionality (which is most probably not an issue).\n\nA: I haven't seen fixed disk support in Parallels Desktop. All my virtual machines has about 64Gb HDD, but space occupied is about 8-10 Gb. I have configuration \"Automatically compress virtual disks\" on (as default value).\n", "Q: Is it possible to change the Bluetooth UUID on my iPod? Is it possible to change the Bluetooth UUID (the 128-bit value) on my iPod (Currently running iOS 5.0)? or is this a factory locked value?\n\nA: No it is not possible. No known private API or jailbreak methods to do so AFAIK.\n\nA: The UDID is locked, but it is possible to spoof a UUID, as for an Bluetooth UUID, I'd think so but I'm not sure there's anything readily available i.e. in Cydia to do so, only a general phone UUID spoofer.\n", "Q: Can I bind a Launchpad shortcut on my [PC] mouse?

No settings were deliberately changed, but there are young children who use the device and could have set something. Is there a simple way to reset the phone and preserve apps and data but make the speaker work again in all apps?\n\nA: The reason why some apps played sound and other didn't is because individual iOS applications can decide whether their audio should play regardless of the mute switch state.\nApple recommend that if audio is critical to the usage of the app, for example a \"teach me German\" speech app then should probably ignore the state of the mute switch. However if the audio is superfluous to the main function of the application then it usually should not play when the mute setting is on.\nAdditionally an application can decide to blend its sound with existing iPod music playback, or to pause iPod playback when the application launches and manage sound exclusively by itself.\nThe mute switch does not affect sound through headphones.\n\nA: When I can't get my music app to play, I restart my iPhone.\nWorks like a charm.  Now it plays music with sound.\n", "Q: How do I password-protect access to specific apps in iOS? currently, I have a 4 digit lock on my phone.\nI know this isn't really secure - and can be broken through if neccessary. It just kind of stops the situation if someone picks up my phone, they won't be able to dial people or write and read my emails straight away.\nWhat I find is that most of the apps I have aren't really worth securing. Like I don't care if someone plays a game or plays a song or checks the weather. And it's really annoying having to unlock the phone every time I want to do anything with it. \nEssentially, it's just the stuff like phone, messages, email that I would like a code for. \nSo I was wondering, are there any features on the phone or any apps that'll allow me to only ask for a keycode when I want to open certain icons or apps?\n\nA: The only way to passcode protect individual applications, including built in system ones is to jailbreak the phone and install a jailbreak tweak like Locktopus or Lockdown Pro. Both of these tweaks let you set a text passcode as well as a numerical one. The reason an AppStore application cannot provide this functionality is because AppStore apps are Sandboxed. This means they are limited in how they can interact with other applications, and the iPhone itself.\nAlternatively, replace the application you are currently using with an AppStore alternative that has a passcode lock built into the application. This wont protect the data in the original app, but if you want to secure data behind a passcode you could move the data into the passcode protected application and delete it from the original application. This obviously wont work for contacts, but could work for photos and notes.\nSee the iOS application \"MyPics\" for an example of a photo app where you can set a passcode to protect access. Another example is the My Secret Folder application which lets you import data into it and set a passcode to prevent people from accessing that data within the app.\n\nA: I've been looking for a while too. \"My Secret Folder\" along with every other security app I've seen on the App Store will only secure contacts, notes, pictures, and videos. And that's only if you import them into that program. It DOES NOT allow you to put an app in the secured folder. You can not lock an \"APP\" without a jailbreak.\nWhen the app comes available to password protect an \"APP\", or even a real folder, I will buy it. (I think Apple should include the option in the next update)\n\nA: You can use the My secret folder app which requires a password to access it. Then your apps would be in there.\n\nA: Doc Vault is a pretty handy app to protect privacy and keep files locked while the iPhone can still be used as usual.\nIt creates a separate area that can only be accessed with a separate pass key. Included is a little browser that allows to hide the history and a tool to create pdf from text.\nCheck it out here:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/doc-vault-individual-access/id551638522?l=de&ls=1&mt=8\n", "Q: Gnu-info page exists, but is visible from neither emacs nor terminal After installing gnuplot on Lion using 'brew gnuplot', the gnuplot info page appears at /usr/local/Cellar/gnuplot/4.4.3/share/info/gnuplot.info\nBut in the info index page (M-x info) in emacs, I see no gnuplot entry.\nHow can one point the \"info system\" (for emacs especially) to the newly installed gnuplot info page?

Is there anyway to track when a restore was done?  (i.e. if I can show that it was done today at 2:45).\nIs there anyway I can prevent the device from being restored (parental controls)?\n\nA: To answer the last question first, no. You can always force a device to be off and then force an erase/restore. You should be able to tell since everything is gone. Worst case someone has an old backup of her content and restored that. \nIt is far more likely the culprit has guessed the passcode and is messing with you all. Second most likely is a jailbreak and known admin password. \nIf the suspect is technically sophisticated, it's possible they can pull this off but the security of passcodes on iOS is quite secure in general. \n", "Q: iPhone Contact List Default Country Wrong My wife's default country for creating contacts is the Netherlands.  The only solution I've found online is to go to:\nSettings -> General -> International -> Region Format\n\nThat doesn't seem to do anything.  It's already set to the United States.  So I went and switched the country to see if it would do anything.  Nothing.\nAnyone know another way I can set the default country? \n\nA: This works perfectly if you have Verizon. My default was set to the Netherlands instead of the United States.   Turn off \"International Assist\" in Settings > Phone, then (because this appears to be a Verizon issue) dial *228 to update the phone service choosing option 1. Follow this by calling a second time to *228 and select option 2. Once those updates are finished, power off the phone and start it up again. For me, that fixed the problem and I was able to turn the \"International Assist\" option back on and it was fine (turning it off may have been an be an extra step, but who knows). This also fixed how the telephone numbers appeared without hyphens.  Now all looks perfect.\n", "Q: What is the most powerful Mac capable of running Mac OS 9? I know that there was a period of time after Mac OS X came out that new Macs still shipped with Mac OS 9 for a number of reasons (OS X was buggy, better compatibility with Classic apps, etc). This is more of a curiosity than anything, but I'm wondering what the most powerful Mac capable of running Mac OS 9 is, and what the maximum specs are.\n\nA: According to Wikipedia, the Power Mac G4 (Mirrored Drive Doors 2003) is the newest and most powerful computer that can run Mac OS 9.\n1.25 GHz PowerPC G4 (7455/7455B); can hold up to 2 GB memory (although OS 9 might not recognize all 2 GB).\n\nA: There is a slight possibility for misunderstanding in the question.\nIf the question is meant to ask for the most powerful 'true' PPC-Mac as shipped by Apple and with native OS 9 installed or installable, then Daniel's answer is correct.\nHowever there are other options eligible to answer the question as is.\nThis involves the cheating option of citing first later Macs, including G5s, that ran OS 9 as the Classic Environment, or even later models emulating OS 9.\nLater G5s were extremely fast at running OS 9 and its applications.\nAccording to enthusiasts there is a second, a less cheating answer that involves upgrades. You could swap the daughter cards of later G4 models into the last native OS 9 machine and enjoy a faster machine. You can also opt for one of the aftermarket options from e.g. Sonnet or Newertech. These are hard to find today. Remnants of their specs are rarely found on the web even if the companies that developed or sold them still exist. Finding the on sale is even more difficult.\nNewertech even sold an upgrade with a G4 chip that Apple never sold: Apple stopped at a beefed up 7447 at 1.67 GHz and 7455 at 1,25 GHz while NewerTech opted for the 7448 in its MAXPowerG4 cards. This came to market after Apple flicked the kill switch for PPC for he transition to x86 processors. \nFor that some benchmarks and some specs are still on the vendors site. For a general overview compare the list here at lowendmac.com.\nTherefore the most powerful true Mac booting natively into OS 9 has to be something like a Power Macintosh G4 'QuickSilver 2002' upgraded with MAXPowerG4 with a single NewerTech G4/2.0GHz 7448 MAXPower G4 or a NewerTech DUAL G4/1.8GHz 7448 MAXPower G4. \nDepending on the usage scenario dual or single is a tough choice speed wise since OS 9 can not take that much of an advantage of two threads. Although the bus speed might hamper the final results quite a bit there are still more options to consider for \"the most powerful\": these things had a few standard PCI and AGP slots. So the graphics card could be upgraded significantly beyond what Apple ever offered and even SSDs could make a bit of an impression considering their latency compared to magnetic drives. \n", "Q: How can I downgrade iTunes 10.5 Beta 7 to the regular iTunes 10.5 I installed iTunes 10.5 Beta. I want to go back to the regular version of iTunes on the iTunes website. When I try and install it, I get an error saying the version on my computer is newer, so it can't.

How can I do this?\n\nA: Did you try to delete the beta before installing the public version?\n\nA: Download version 10.5 of iTunes from Apple: http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/ - and install it - maybe throw the old beta iTunes in the Trash first.\nAnd How-to remove iTunes completely first: http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=4045\n\nA: iTunes 10.5.1 beta 3 was released yesterday, which is a good indicator that it will be formally released Real Soon Now.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro doesn't detect external display after Lion upgrade Asking on behalf of a friend.\nHis 2011 MacBook Pro (no Thunderbolt) was running Snow Leopard and was being connected to a Dell monitor in the standard way.\nHe upgraded to Lion and now the MacBook cannot detect the display.\nWhat can we do to detect the display (my Snow Leopard MacBook still detects the display)?\n\nThe MacBook was taken into an Apple retail store with the monitor. It was hooked up and obviously didn't work, It was then plugged into my 2006 MacBook, and it worked.\nThe chap in the shop was very confused.\nWe then looked at the cables. We used another cable and dvi-mini dvi connector. This changed nothing.\nWe have also done a fresh install of Lion.\nSo as for now the problem is unsolved.\nAs soon as it is fixed I will post the answer.\n\nA: This is from my own experience, I have macbook pro with lion and a dell monitor, I connect via mini displayport to VGA connector, if I connect displayport first to my macbook and then monitor's vga to displayport to VGA, it won't work, I don't know why but maybe some internal implementation detail, just go in this order\n\n\n*\n\n*switch on both devices\n\n*connect monitor's VGA cable to your mini displayport cable,\n\n*connect mini mini displayport  to you macbook.\n\n*wait for a few seconds, it works every time.\n\n\nA: Mine did this because I had Air Display installed (yes, Air Display).  I uninstalled that app and everything works now. \n\nA: Shut down the MacBook. Start it up with the external monitor connected. It should recognise it. Had same problem on Mountain Lion with a projector I had used many times before. Was supposed to be showing a film to a bunch of kids in the Youth Club and had to give up. My wife discovered the next day that restarting with it connected fixed it.\n\nA: Try a SMC reset first - you might also want to test starting in Safe Boot mode and/or creating a new admin user and logging into that account.\n\nA: I had a problem where my mac was only detecting one of my 2 external monitors after I updated to mountain lion. It just plain was not detecting it. I thought it was only detecting the one that was connected via mini display. Turns our I was using something called Display Link. I don't remember if I downloaded that or if something else did when I first set up my monitors. I noticed that in that file it only had the uninstall in the file. So i went to the website and reinstalled the Display link and that worked! Hope that helps someone!!\n", "Q: Disk Utility says: \"Error: This disk doesn't contain an EFI system partition.\" After a clean install of Lion, followed by partitioning which again was followed by a installation of Ubuntu, I noticed some error messages of Disk Utitity.\nWhen verifying the volume I get told that there is no EFI partition. But you can clearly see one in Disk Utility (and with diskutil list). The Mac boots fine. I have no problem choosing between booting into Mac or Linux at boot.\n\n\n\n\nA: The default results of diskutil list on a clean Lion installation should be as follows:\nmac:~ me$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.2 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n\nMy definition of a \"clean install of Lion\" involves letting Disk Utility from the installer partition the drive as GUID and telling it to use all space as a single partition.\nFurthermore, your disk0s1 / EFI partition shouldn't show as partitioned according to disk utility:\nmac:~ me$ diskutil info disk0s1\n   Device Identifier:        disk0s1\n   Device Node:              /dev/disk0s1\n   Part of Whole:            disk0\n   Device / Media Name:      EFI system partition\n\n   Volume Name:              Not applicable (no file system)\n\n   Mounted:                  Not applicable (no file system)\n\n   File System:              None\n\n   Partition Type:           EFI\n   OS Can Be Installed:      No\n   Media Type:               Generic\n   Protocol:                 SATA\n   SMART Status:             Verified\n\n   Total Size:               209.7 MB (209715200 Bytes) (exactly 409600 512-Byte-Blocks)\n   Volume Free Space:        Not applicable (no file system)\n   Device Block Size:        512 Bytes\n\n   Read-Only Media:          No\n   Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (no file system)\n   Ejectable:                No\n\n   Whole:                    No\n   Internal:                 Yes\n   Solid State:              No\n\nSince your mac will boot, it may be overkill to erase everything and start over, but your EFI partition is hitting a check that Apple built into the Disk Utility, so do know that future updates could have problems and you might be forced to re-do things at a time less convenient if the difference between your system and an expected / Apple generated EFI actually breaks something Apple changes down the road (or when certain expected conditions arise like a firmware password, etc...). \nOn the flip side - it could be a simple check to alert you of a non-standard EFI and not that your EFI is in some way ever going to break. Can another vendor support your Microsoft EFI? If so, you might be able to leave it as is since it appears you are clearly using tools designed to make proper changes even if Disk Utility isn't able to guarantee the changes are appropriate.\n", "Q: How to remove extra iPhone calendars? I'm using my university's exchange server to sync my calendar, contacts and todos with my iPhone (iOS 5), and this is working perfectly. \nHowever, there are (besides the \"Birthdays\" calendar) two other calendars \"from my PC\". At least they say they are - I have no idea where they would be on my PC, and why there are two of them (I've only ever synced my iPhone on one Win7 PC under one single user account). \nThey also appear to be completely empty, but I'm not sure how to actually make sure that they are.\n\nWhat's more important, I'd like to remove them (not just hide them), but I don't know how. iTunes on Windows isn't a big help here. But perhaps I'm overlooking something.\nCan I remove those calendars? Or at least one of them?\n\nA: When the device is plugged into iTunes, look under the info tab, you will see an option to sync calendars, you can turn this off by unchecking the sync calendars box.\n\n", "Q: Using other glyphs in Arabic on the iPad Arabic Keyboard on iPad uses GeezaPro font and obviously keys are limited compared to available glyphs, but what should I do if I want to use a glyph that doesn't have its own key. Is there any way I can add/use it somehow?  The reason I need to do this is so I can write in Persian/Farsi.\n\nA: If you search the app store for \"persian\" you should find a few keyboard apps which will make the characters you are missing and which may be useful for email and some other purposes.\n\nA: You may be able to access what you want by using Character Viewer (Edit > Special Characters).  It would help to know exactly what it is you think cannot be made from the keyboard.\n\nA: As far as I know, not with the \"soft\" onscreen keyboard. Unfortunately the Arabic keyboard doesn't have the \"tap and hold for more glyphs\" feature that some of the other keyboards support.\nBut there is support for 3 different hardware keyboard layouts (Arabic, Arabic PC, Arabic QWERTY), so perhaps with an external Bluetooth keyboard you could gain access to more glyphs.\nAnother alternative would be to use a 3rd-party app like Unikey or Unicode Maps that gives you access to a full range of Unicode glyphs and lets you build a custom keyboard. Not as elegant and usable as having what you need built in to the OS, but it could be a stopgap solution until Apple further improves their Arabic support.\nMake sure to submit feedback to Apple to let them know your language needs better support! \n\nA: Yes, there is! Here's how:\nFirst find the character/glyph you want to enter on the Char Map or online or whatever way you prefer. \nThen go to iPad Settings > General > Keyboards > Text Replacementand tap the + button on the top corner. Now paste the glyph in the Phrase field, and enter the desired keyboard shortcut for it. Then press Save.\nThis way whenever you want to enter that particular glyph, you can just type in your shortcut on your Arabic keyboard and it will replace it with your desired character.\nFor instance I used to use the Arabic ' ك' to input the Persian equivalent 'ک' when there was no Persian keyboard available in iOS. You can also use the same approach to input longer phrases when typing a specific shortcut.\n", "Q: Will a sata3 SSD work properly on a Mac mini (Mid 2010) with 2.4 GHz CPU? I have a Mac mini (Mid 2010) with 2.4 GHz CPU and willing to upgrade its HDD to SSD. \nCan I use a sata3 SSD for it?\n\nA: Yes, you can.  \nHere are the theoretical bus speeds \nSATAI   - 150 MB/sec - 1.5 Gb/sec\nSATAII  - 300 MB/sec -  3 Gb/sec \nSATAIII - 600 MB/sec -  6 Gb/sec\nIn theory, a very fast drive could saturate a SATA2 bus, but if it does, it will still send the data, just slower than it's capable of.  If that bothers you, just buy a slower SATA2 SSD drive.\nRegardless, you'll be very happy with the performance upgrade over a slower drive.  It's the best upgrade investment you can make.  \n\nA: SSDs with SATA-X are backward compatible.\n\n\n*\n\n*SATA3 is compatible with SATA3, SATA2 and SATA1 connections\n\n*SATA2 is compatible with SATA2 and SATA1 connections\n\n\nI for example use a SSD with a SATA3 capability on a SATA1 bus. (Crucial m4 in MBP 3.1)\nMy advice:\nAlways take the latest SSDs. They have a more refined garbage collection. It's also preferable to take a SSD with SATA3 in order to profit from the faster bus speed in case you use the SSD in another computer some day.\n\nA: Nope, because SATA3 in a Mini began with the 2011 models, or with Core i5/i7 processors. The SSD would saturate the SATA2 bandwidth, but I don't see why you would spend more money for the little extra speed it's gonna give you. Stick with SATA2 SSDs is my advice.\n", "Q: How do I stop Yahoo Sync? Since upgrading to Max OS X 10.7.2 and converting my MobileMe Account to iCloud I am receiving endless dialog boxes asking about syncing Yahoo Contacts.\nI cannot find settings anywhere to turn this off. I have to manually dismiss these frakking dialogues, which come up at the rate of about one an hour.\n\nA: I was curious about this myself and started by looking in Activity Monitor, found that \"launchd\" was the service that kicked off the Yahoo Contacts Sync.  After some googl'ing I found out that custom scripts for launchd get executed from the ~(user)/Library/LaunchAgents folder.  In there, you'll find the culprit -- at least, I did.  Now I dunno if I should simply delete them (since I don't care about syncing contacts, I don't use the Mail.app) or if I can just disable it by tweaking the plist file.  Hope that helps!\nEDIT: I discovered that going into the AddressBook.app preferences and unchecking the accounts listed caused the plist files to be removed.  If you check them again, they reappear.  Works for me!  :)\n\nA: Here is how I solved this:\n\n\n*\n\n*launch Address Book\n\n*go to Preferences -> Accounts tab -> On My Mac item\n\n*check Synchronize with Yahoo! box (which was unchecked for me)\n\n*choose cancel in the resulting dialogue box\n\n\nI can only guess that checking Synchronize with Yahoo! and canceling the resulting dialogue shook some sense into some forgotten settings.\n\nA: Both Address Book and iTunes have (or had) UI for authenticating with Yahoo and enabling contact sync. When you migrated to iCloud, the UI probably went away.\nOne heavy-handed technique to solve this would be to remove /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/YahooSync.framework from your system.\n", "Q: airplay and wireless headphones I'm trying to find some headsets that will work with airplay from either my mac or an iPhone. \nShould i presume all wireless or bluetooth headsets do? \nbest, Dan.\n\nA: Not at all - you should presume the opposite - that all wireless and bluetooth headsets will not work with AirPlay on a Mac or iOS device.\nAirPlay requires an Apple certified device (you can't just have any old software become an AirPlay destination) and AirPlay goes over a TCP/IP network and generally uses broadcast packets so it won't find speakers on a different subnetwork without advanced network tunneling and setup (generally sender and receiver are on the same router).\nEven though WiFi does share some of the radio frequencies that are the same as Bluetooth - the two do not communicate with each other. At the moment, bluetooth audio connection is much better for stereo headsets as it allows the device to play / pause / control volume as well as sending the music using less battery power than WiFi chipset (to get AirPlay wirelessly) can.\nI would expect things like larger speaker systems, receivers and electronics that plug in to the wall (or at least non-wearable battery power) to get AirPlay and light headsets to remain Bluetooth only due to power, size and features.\n\nA: To my knowledge, there aren't any AirPlay-enabled headphones at the moment, nor have any been announced. I wouldn't count on any ever coming out to be honest.\nWifi is simply more power hungry than Bluetooth, which makes it ill suited for a situation where you want the device to be as light as possible.\n\nA: I think you are a bit confused about what AirPlay actually is. While in iOS both AirPlay speakers, as any Bluetooth headsets can be accessed by the same \"remote speaker\" button, the two technologies are very different.\nAirPlay requires a local wireless or wired network. It transmits an uncompressed audio stream (as opposed to Bluetooth), and given it works across an entire local network, it isn't restricted in distance as Bluetooth is. AirPlay discovery happens automatically across the entire network with Bonjour, while Bluetooth devices need to be paired. Given the power requirements of a (wifi) network adapter, and probably because of licensing costs as well, you will not likely see AirPlay in a wireless headset any time soon.\nHowever, I'm under te impression you are just interested in knowing which Bluetooth headsets are supported by iOS/Mac OS X.\nFor iOS, you can consult the following link on which Bluetooth profiles are supported on which iOS devices. You can probably find matching information for the Bluetooth headphone models too.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht3647\nFor Mac, you should be able to pair the Bluetooth headset just fine, but it is unlikely iTunes will work nice with that in a way you can expect from actual AirPlay devices. You'll probably need to change your primary audio output in System Preferences to have all audio output directed to the headphone.\n\nA: AirPlay isn't possible through Bluetooth as it works on Wi-Fi and wired networks, but it can actually work over Bluetooth through Bluetooth PAN (TCP/IP). So if a Bluetooth device can support connecting through Bluetooth PAN then it can use AirPlay. It just needs another Bluetooth profile. It may not actually be able to connect to your router but just saying it's possible.\n", "Q: Swap Fn and Control key on a MacBook Pro I use a MacBook at work and the Fn is exactly where I expect the Control key to be. Is there any way I can swap the two keys?\n\nA: KeyRemap4MacBook allows you to do this.\n", "Q: Restoring Missing iPhone Messages A friend of mine has an iPhone 3G and around September his phone seemed to lose all of his SMS messages, and now only messages received since then are visible. I have found some sources saying that this can happen when the message database becomes corrupt (or there is a message which is corrupt somewhere and it's breaking things). I understand that the database archive is an SQLite DB and that somebody with similar symptoms solved this by deleting the offending message from the database manually. I'm happy to do this but the iPhone is not jailbroken and I assume I won't have write privileges on the device.\nI've tried backing up the iPhone via iTunes and extracting the messages using a tool but it only found the messages that the device can see, and there are no backups from before the issue occurred.\nIs it likely that the messages still exist on the device and can be extracted? Is it possible to restore them so that the device can read them again?\nEdit in response to mankoff's reply:\nI've now performed a backup of the iPhone in iTunes and have analysed the SQLite database dump and the message with the earliest timestamp is as follows:\nINSERT INTO \"message\" VALUES(2,NULL,1315907872,NULL,131,0,NULL,1,0,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1);\n\nFor reference the table schema is:\nCREATE TABLE message (ROWID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, address TEXT, date INTEGER, text TEXT, flags INTEGER, replace INTEGER, svc_center TEXT, group_id INTEGER, association_id INTEGER, height INTEGER, UIFlags INTEGER, version INTEGER, subject TEXT, country TEXT, headers BLOB, recipients BLOB, read INTEGER);\n\nThis corresponds to Tue, 13 Sep 2011 09:57:52 GMT which is the earliest message that the phone can also see. I'm not sure how a NULL sender could occur and the database seems to contain no instances of this.\nGiven this information is there any way that the data could still be on the phone and extractable (short of forensics)?\nEdit 2\nI'd also like to ask: what could have caused this problem?\n\nA: You should try accessing the SMS db from the command line. Some explanation is here: How can I export SMS text messages from my iPhone?\nIf you see old messages, you can find the corrupt one and retrieve them. If the Sqlite dump command doesn't show them, and the size of the DB implies they are not there, it is likely they are gone.\nIf you can find old copies of that file in backups, look there, otherwise I think the messages are permanently gone.\n", "Q: Mac Book Pro 2.2 (2008) Core 2 Duo, display and trackpad stopped working My Mac Book Pro 2.2 (2008) Core 2 Duo, was working properly, and after waking it up (open the lid), the display was black...\nIt happened to me before and the other times I reckon it was some kind of bug with it not understanding it was meant to wake up (nothing a lid close, wait a bit and open lid wouldn't solve).\nThis time none of my previous solutions worked, and I forced a shutdown and then started it, and it remained with a blank (black) screen.\nI can connect to it via the screen sharing application, and everything is working except the trackpad, the cursor doesn't move. Incidentally, connecting an external USB mouse, doesn't work, the cursor also doesn't move. (the cursor via screen sharing at least works).\nBy connecting to it remotely, I can go to the system preferences and can see that under the monitors preferences, it shows the standard display resolutions, and I connected an external monitor and nothing, so I assume the graphic card is gone.\nSo symptoms are:\n\n\n*\n\n*no display, no external display;\n\n*no USB mouse (but it does read USB pen drives)\n\n\nWhat I've done so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*reseted VRAM\n\n*started from an external system\n\n\nNone of these worked and what puzzles me is why doesn't the USB external mouse work? (the rest seems to indicate the graphic card + trackpad are seriously damaged).\nWhat can I do? is there a solution for this?\n\nA: my 2008 santa rosa 2.2GHz MacBook Pro has suffered both the graphic chip problem (no picture on screen but accessible through screen sharing apps or ext monitor), and the trackpad cable problem (no response from keyboard or trackpad although ext mouse and keyboard function ok). Both are common faults on this model. Graphics prob repairable under the special warranty extension from Apple. Trackpad cable fairly easy using ifixit.com guide.\nWhen my graphics card was in broken mode, (it was intermittent), it would not show up in the Graphics/Displays section of System Information (Lion); the Intel chipset would show up there instead; so thus you can check if you have the graphics chip (poor solderflow) problem. It would however give me the output to an external monitor ok (?!*)\nIt sounds as though you might have suffered both at the same time...although your ext mouse should work(?!*)\n\nA: My Mac arrived today after behing fixed under the extendend warranty for the NVidia graphics card problem (basically NVidia \"admits\" the card has a problem and so the authorized apple support replaces the card).\nStrange that the trackpad was affected and that the external mouse wouldn't work, but averyhing works ok now, so I have to assume it was all related to the graphics card.\n", "Q: I synced my iPhone to my laptop. Can I safely wipe it clean now? I'm planning to buy a new iPhone. I'm going to exchange my current one for the new one. Before I give the old phone to Sprint, I'd like to wipe it clean (by going to Settings > General > Reset, etc).\nI synced the phone to my laptop using iTunes. Before doing so, under \"Info\" I selected \"Sync address book contacts\" and all the rest.\nWill I be able to restore that backup to the new phone?\nOverall, am I going about this the right way? Is there an easier way?\n\nA: Yes, you can. \nAs long as you backup everything to iTunes, you are safe to wipe it clean. \nWhen you connect your new iPhone to iTunes it will ask, \"Do you want to load data from the currently saved backup?\" or, \"Do you want to set up as a new iPhone\".\nYou can also synchronize your iPhone with iCloud, directly from your iPhone. On your new iPhone, during first setup, you can choose to restore from iCloud.\nMake sure you have the latest iTunes installed nonetheless.\n", "Q: Sync playlist to iPod on other networked iMac I have a main iMac with an iTunes library that I share with Apple TV and an iMac my kids use. I want my kids to be able to plug in their iPod and sync it with a playlist I have set up, but the playlists don't appear as options on their computer, even though they can see and play them through the shared library. How am I supposed to accomplish this?\n\nA: iPod/iPhone syncing only work with local files, meaning you have to copy your files to your kids computer or have them sync at yours (yes, it's a pain both ways).\nHome Sharing somewhat helps here because it allows to copy purchased stuff automatically as explained in HT3819:\n\nYou can also choose to have iTunes automatically import purchases you make on any of your Home Sharing computers to your own library. To do so, select the library and use the Settings button at the lower right of the iTunes window to check what you'd like copied.\n\n", "Q: Is my USB drive broken, or is it my MacBook? I have a Kingston DataTraveler 108, which is recognized by any computer I plug it into. When I try copying files to it on my MacBook, it is sometimes suddenly ejected.\nI've had the same problem copying large files off of it. I have no problem when reading files on my MacBook, and I haven't had a problem opening files on other computers. \nI'm running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2. There are two USB ports and the problem happens on both. I've also tested with Windows on the same MacBook — with same problems.\nThe drive gets really hot when it's plugged into my MacBook. Is this a software or hardware problem, and is there a fix for it?\nEdit: \nI've updated to 10.7.3 since posting this question. Also, my second USB drive of the same kind has started the same behavior. I think it's just the kind of USB drive... Can anyone offer a way to verify that it's the drive and not the port?\n\nA: If it happens to your drive only with your macbook (on both OS X and Windows) and works fine with other machines, then the problem is most likely your USB port. \nI suspect that it is supplying more than the stipulated voltage (5V ± 5% for USB 2.0) and your device must not be sophisticated enough to only take what it needs.\nYou can check this using a multimeter and a USB male connector (I chopped a spare USB extension cord when I needed it). It should register the correct voltage and if not, there's your problem.\nIf you're going the chopping an extension cord route like me, here is what it will look like if you strip the wires (image source)\n\nThe white and green wires are for data transfer — you don't want that. The red is +5V and the black is ground. Connect your multimeter to those to check the voltage.\n\nA: I can confirm the warming of USB drives on both of my macs. Drives from various manufacturers.\nThe sudden ejection appeared to when reading old CF cards in a card reader. For me it only happened when having several file accesses at the same time. Seems to me like hardware limitations of the cards - but who knows...\nNow I disable spotlight and the trash on my thumb drives using this suggestions. And the warming of drives seems \"reduced\".\nSo - it looks to me chances are your drives are old but good. But you should keep backups anyway :)\n", "Q: why do iPhoto, Word, and Finder open when I restart Lion? I'm using Lion (10.7.2).  I close all applications and restart the Mac.

does iTunes Match handle metadata? When I purchase songs from iTunes, I often times hate the way the MetaData is presented. For example, I prefer the format\nArtist          Song Name \n-------------------------\nartist_name     song_name f/ featured_artists\n\nBut songs purchased from iTunes usually come in the form\nArtist                                    Song Name\n---------------------------------------------------\nartist_name feat. featured_artists        song_name\n\nMy concern is that once I use iTunes match to match all of my music with the music that exists on Apple's servers, iTunes is going to use the MetaData as stored on their servers as opposed to the MetaData that I have meticulously set in my library.\nIf it is going to use Apple's MetaData instead of my own, this is a complete deal breaker for me.\nDoes anybody who has signed up for/used iTunes Match know the way iTunes Match behaves in this regard?\n\nA: It keeps your custom metadata!\n", "Q: iPhone plays podcasts in seemingly random order Does anyone know why my iPhone has (suddenly) started playing podcasts in seemingly random order? I want podcasts to be played in the order they were downloaded (in iTunes), chronologically.\nHowever, when I start listening to a podcast with more than two entries, the second entry iPhone plays is seldom the second in chronological order, but some seemingly random entry. Why is this and how can I fix it?\nUpdate: Here's how the Music application's interface looks like on my iPhone:\n\nI can't see a shuffle icon anywhere. The icon on the lower right hand side is the airplay icon. Here's a screenshot after tapping the \"album art\":\n\nHere's a screenshot from while playing music:\n\nThere I can see a shuffle icon (finally), but it's not enabled (blue).\n\nA: Did you have shuffle on while listening to music? If you did, the podcasts will also be shuffled.\n\nA: I usually do a playlist and sort it based on whatever criteria I want. The order usually sticks well then.\nUpdate: I use a smart playlist. Kind = Podcast and playcount = 0. From there you sort the playlist based on how you want it sorted. I then added rules to exclude from the podiobooks playlist and the music podcast playlist.\nI had added others one for music and one for podiobooks. They where create by Kind = podcast and album = podcast name. I added one album = for each podcast in the list. I didn't add many after I had it setup so I didn't edit those much. \nThe main list was then dynamically updated based on these other two lists. Simple and maintenance free.\n", "Q: How do you change the behavior of the power button in Lion? On my Macbook Pro, whenever you press the power button it goes into sleep mode. How do I change this to do nothing? \n\nA: You can control whether pressing the power button should put your mac to sleep or present a dialog with options (sleep/restart/shut-down) using the pmset command. The following:\nsudo pmset powerbutton 1\n\nwill put it to sleep right away (presumably your current setting) and changing 1 to 0 will present you with the dialog. \nPay attention to the fact that it's not a per-user setting, and changes the behaviour for all users. Something to keep in mind if you share the device with others. From the man page (explore it for other options):\n\nAll changes made through pmset are saved in a persistent preferences file (per-system, not per-user) at\n       /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.PowerManagement.plist\n\n\nA: defaults write com.apple.loginwindow PowerButtonSleepsSystem -bool no\n\nIs working for me on 10.9.5, and gives behavior very close to how the power button used to work for me on 10.6. Though there is a bit more of a delay, it's definitely not infuriating anymore.\nhttp://www.defaults-write.com/10-9-stop-the-power-button-from-putting-your-mac-in-stand-by-mode/\n", "Q: Does removing the battery while connected to power extend battery life? On regular Windows notebooks people generally remove their battery packs when connected to a power source, in order to extend battery life.\nDoes a similar approach work on the Mac?\n\nA: On many recent Macs, you cannot remove the battery (at least not easily), so this simply wouldn't work.\nIn general, it's kind of pointless to do that, as you're negating a benefit of having the battery: if the power goes out or the cable gets pulled (especially if it's a magnetic cable), you lose power just like a desktop would.\nUltimately, I would recommend not bothering in either the Mac or Windows case.\n\nA: Since OSX has protection built-in to keep from continuously charging the battery, you shouldn't remove it, there is no benefit.\nPart of that protection is that if you plug in your laptop >95% charge, it won't actually charge the battery, and will run off of the power adapter.        \n\nA: Recent versions of MacOS notice when the notebook tends to be run with power connected and stops charging at somewhere between 80 and 90 %, which protect the long-term health of the battery.  \n", "Q: Can I transfer photos that are not in my iPhone's camera roll to my computer? My iPhone was linked to my main computer and it has all my photos stored on it, but not in the camera roll. Since my husband blew the main computer up, my precious photos appear to be in limbo. It does not appear that I can import them anywhere. I could email all them one by one but that seems a little low tech. iTunes tells me that if I upgrade iOS I will lose my photos that are not in the camera roll. Also, the same would seem to be true if I deauthorize my main (now usless) PC. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Yes, you can get the photos back on your computer that you synced to your iPhone. However, they will be a lower quality as iTunes automatically resizes them when it syncs them onto your device.\nOne way to copy photos off an iDevice is through a program called iExplorer (previously iPhone Explorer) that lets you access some of the filesystem on the iPhone.\nInstall the program from the website, then open it. You will be presented with a screen where you should find your iPhone listed. Here are the locations of the photos:\nCamera Roll Photos:\niPhone -> Media -> DCIM\nPreviously Synced Photos:\niPhone -> Media -> PhotoData - > Sync\nTo get the synced photos off your iPhone drag the Sync folder into a folder on your computer and wait for them to copy. The same applies to the camera roll photos if you want to grab them at the same time.\n\nA: I know I'm a bit late but I've just had this problem, but I have an easy fix (providing you have another iOS device capable of AirDrop. I selected all the photos from the iPhone that were synced from the computer (it did take a few minutes but it's self explanatory) and I sent them to my iPad via AirDrop - thus saving the photos onto the camera roll of my iPad, from where you can plug your ipad into your computer, and import the photos that way!\n\nA: One process to get access to synced photos is to duplicate them so they appear in camera roll. The process is lossless. This way you can access these photos in well known ways.\nThe process is described in this answer: How to convert synced photo folders to camera roll folders?\nBasically you open the folder with the synced images, select all of them, then tap on share icon and then tap \"Duplicate\".\n\nA: There is no change you can make photos from nothing.\nYou should recover them before transfer them.\nAlso, check iCloud to see if they were there. If you've backed once on iTunes or iCloud, you may find them there.\nIf you insisted, you may check this guide for further information:\nHow to Transfer Photos from iPhone to Computer\n\nA: I think you can not transfer the photos like in camera roll to your computer. You can try iCloud.\n\nA: Sometimes you can transfer data from iOS to iTunes or icloud . And  you need to download iTunes and iCloud on your PC .Then singing in with your Apple ID and stuffBut .If you want to transfer data from iOS to computer quickly. How to deal it ? You maybe need an easy-to-use iOS transfer tool .\n\nA: After lot of crazy efforts to find a solution to this my brother finally got a way.. download an app called send anywhere on both the devices.. that is your iphone as well as the place you want to send the pics to.. you need good internet connectivity and voila you have your photos transferred in some time to their final destination :P :D\n\nA: There are file browsing apps you can use. They will scan the whole file system on your phone and list all the photos on the device. FoneTrans is a quite nice one to do that though the user interface is a bit ugly.\nTutorial: How to Transfer Photos from iPhone to Computer\n", "Q: How can I set up a local mail server on Lion? I am developing a site with django (email registration) and for testing purposes I would like to set up a local smtp server on my MBA. This has to be local because my main work location does not have an active internet connection. So does anyone know how to do this? Would I have to buy Lion Server or can I just do it through the terminal or some other program?\nAny help or questions please let me know.\n\nA: Lion Server isn't released as a separate OS anymore, so if you're concerned about having to upgrade your entire OS, that isn't necessary. The server programs are distributed as an add-on to a regular Lion install, for $50, through the App Store.\nThere are also ways to do this for free. Being somewhat unfamiliar with running email services on MacOS myself, I would probably just configure a Linux VM and run it in Parallels (or Virtualbox if you don't have it already).

I've noticed the small movies I take on my iPhone 4 result in large .mov files. For example, a 1 minute movie results in almost a 100MB .mov file. This is running through my cloud storage (Dropbox) rather quickly. Is there an easy way to reduce the quality/size after transferring to my Mac? \n\nA: As an alternative to using Quicktime to lower the quality of the video (therefore, reduce the size of the file) is to use VLC Media Player.\nIt works better in the sense that it provides options for codecs, encapsulation and audio codecs as well. This can help to convert the .mov to be playable in specific devices or platforms.\nMoreover, it keeps a better resolution of the videos.\n\n\nA: Most of this is documented:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do you convert video within 10.7 without any 3rd party software\n\n\n\nThe Finder has built in video encoding and you could even use these to set up watch folders and attach a pre-set conversion using Automator if you found one setting that you prefer...\n\nA: You can transcode them while transferring!\nYou can do exactly same automator workflow but make it an Image Capture plug-in. So you can choose in \"Image Capture\" videos from your iOS device and import them transcoded.\nReally easy steps are presented on macworld.com, basically you use\n\nand import your movies using Image Capture.\nIf you check the box [Show this action when the workflow runs] you will be able to choose destination folder and compress options.\n", "Q: What type of database is the iOS 5 SMS db?

Macports?\nBinary?\nRVM-esque tool?\nOther?\nI will be using NumPy/SciPy for a computer vision project, so I want to do it once and do it right.\n\nA: do it with the scipy superpack, by Chris Fonneback. It's very easy, automated and it works (using it right now!).\nIt also takes care of installing Fortran for you, which is mandatory for the python libraries to work.\nPS: If you have Lion, Numpy is already part of it.\n\nA: Depends on what else you want to do.\nthe simplest is probably the binary Enthought distribution especially in the paid for versions - the free version will give you matplotlib, numpy and scipy in 32 bit which might be sufficient for you.\nIf you need other C libraries then macports (and I suspect fink, homebrew) will work. Note that for Lion and 64 bit python you might have to install matplotlib with no tk support (tk is one of the possible gui libraries) e.g. port install py27-matplotlib -tkinter\n", "Q: I sync'ed twice for my iPhone 4S and my iMac, but it still asked me to transfer purchased content to my Library? iOS 5.0.1 is out and I want to do any upgrade, but when I click Update, it will pop out a window that says:\n\nSo I sync'ed the iPhone 4S once, and it pop out the same dialog.

I was trying to create a new user on my OS X Lion machine, and somehow managed to destroy my own user's account. Here are the steps I took; hopefully someone here can recognize what I did, and maybe identify some way around this.\nFirst, I ran these commands:\nsudo dscl localhost -create /Local/Default/Users/elasticsearch\nsudo dscl localhost -create /Local/Default/Users/elasticsearch /bin/bash # mistake!\nsudo dscl localhost -create /Local/Default/Users/elasticsearch UserShell /bin/bash\nsudo dscl localhost -create /Local/Default/Users/elasticsearch RealName \"Elastic Search\"\nsudo dscl localhost -create /Local/Default/Users/elasticsearch UniqueID 503 # MY uniqueID\nsudo dscl localhost -create /Local/Default/Users/elasticsearch PrimaryGroupID 1000\nsudo dscl localhost -create /Local/Default/Users/elasticsearch NFSHomeDirectory /Local/Users/elasticsearch\n\nThe big mistake I made here was using \"503\", which was my user's UniqueID. Immediately my shell username changed to \"elasticsearch\". I fiddled around, tried to change the current user with sudo su -u sritchie, but this didn't work.\nOn restart, only the \"Elastic Search\" user was available. I logged into the Lion Recovery partition and reset the root password.\nAfter logging in as root and checking on the terminal, I made the remarkable discovery that my home folder was totally empty. I deleted the elasticsearch user, but it made no difference.

Is Time Machine smart enough to spread the data over two drives?\nthanks!\n\nA: No. But you may clean HDD to make users and system&library info take no more than 40-45GB (System/Library/Apps) and then use migration assistant ticking only things you need. Or Time Machine if you exclude or move some folders beforehand.\nP.S. I wonder if your MBP is pre-unibody one because it is the only type that will benefit from HDD in the bracket in the place of optical disk.

Now it corrects the word \"me\" to \"^me\" every time.   How can I remove this?\n(I would like a solution to the problem. Pressing the X on the auto correct tooltip or disabling auto correct work, but they don't solve the problem.) \n\nA: Simply reset your Keyboard Dictionary.\nAs you type on iOS, it will begin to learn the words you use frequently. The frequently used words will take precedent after a while (most often seen with names). Sometimes this system makes a mistake and records a typo or a word that you'd rather not have iOS dish up.\nTo correct this matter, simply reset your Keyboard Dictionary. Tap Settings > General. Scroll down to the bottom and tap on Reset.\n\nThis will delete all the entries and restore your keyboard dictionary to its default state, removing the erroneous admission.\n\nA: Try making a note in Notes with the word \"me\" in it. Save the note. The contents of contacts and Notes (along with things like sent email and web searches) are said to be used to populate the autocorrection database.\nAlternatively, you might want to do a search for \"^me\" on your phone and delete it, if it's saved anywhere.\nSee http://tntluoma.com/iphone/ducking-iphone/ and its comments for a discussion of this phenomenon.\n", "Q: How do I restart the iTunes matching process? My main iTunes library was in the process of uploading to iTunes Match when I enabled iTunes Match on iTunes on another computer. I got a message saying that only one computer at a time could upload to iTunes Match, and because there were only a handful of items in my library on my secondary computer, I decided to interrupt the upload on the primary computer and quickly do the match on the secondary computer.\nUnfortunately, once I did that, the \"iTunes Match\" sidebar item disappeared from the primary computer, and going into \"iTunes Match in the \"iTunes Store\" just shows a page describing what I can do with iTunes Match.\nHow do I get my primary computer to resume the upload process?\n\nA: In the menu bar, select \"Store\" -> \"Update iTunes Match\":\n\nThe match and upload process will restart.\n", "Q: How can I change the resolution of a PDF I have scanned a document into a PDF at 300dpi.  The document file is larger than I would like.  Is there a simple way to down-sample the document so that it has a lower resolution?

(Basically, wipe the second iPad 2 and start over.) I thought about maybe \"restoring\" it but then I didn't want iTunes to think that my only iPad had been wiped and then wipe the original the next time I connected it.\n\n\nA: You can wipe the data and return it to factory settings by choosing settings - General - Reset. \nLike the first answer you should now name them differently.\nJust to add to that you will also need to restore one of them to empty, then set it up using iCloud, add iCloud to your other iPad 2 and then they will share data, but you will also be able to add an app to one and delete from the other without losing all data, next time you sync.\n\nA: You can restore safely, iTunes won't try to restore the other. But before you do, you might want to try changing the name of the second iPad to see if iTunes treats it differently. If you have iOS 5, you can do this by opening Settings and going to General > About > Name. If you don't have iOS 5, connect it to your computer and double-click on the name in iTunes. That change shouldn't propagate to the other device.\n", "Q: iCloud bookmark sync with Chrome Apple's iCloud makes syncing of Safari bookmarks easy between Safari on Mac or PC and IE on PC. \nHowever I'm using the Chrome browser on both those platforms and I'm wondering if there's any workaround to have Chrome bookmarks synchronized with iOS devices either by using iCloud or another service / package.\n\nA: Well, as a workaround, you could use Xmarks.\nSyncing your bookmarks with Xmarks works with both Chrome and Safari, so anything you add in Safari will appear in Chrome and visa versa.\nThat way you can also add a bookmark in Chrome, it will sync to Safari over Xmarks and then out to your iOS devices with iCloud.\nProbably not what you wanted, but it will work. It's what I ended up doing.\n\nA: Unfortunately, if you combine X-Marks and iCloud sync you invariably have bookmark and folder duplication that runs rampant. It is nigh impossible for them to play nicely with each other, which is a bummer because it would be nice to sync bookmarks with your desktop browser (ie Chrome) and your iOS browser (ie Safari) and you would think there would be a sensible way to do this.\n", "Q: Use iCloud calendar and contacts with non-Apple devices A friend wants to sync his calendar (also his contacts if possible) with a non-iPhone device.\nIs there a way to connect a device to iCloud via Exchange or CalDav. If so where could the specific parameters like servers and ports be found?\n\nA: I have a way to do this that may help your friend.  My setup does what you're describing.\nI use Microsoft Exchange for work and Gmail for everything else.  I sync my iCal with Google calendar, Addressbook with Google contacts and use mail.app for all emails.  I use 4 devices and all of them have the same contacts and calendar information.  \nSince Addressbook and iCal have my current information, any non-iPhone device with access to Google calendar and contacts could use what I have on my Macs.  The non-iPhone device will need to be capable of syncing with Google calendar and contacts and most apps today have that functionality.  \nI also have a Comcast account that meshes fine with this setup since mail.app uses Addressbook and iCal instead of Comcast's contacts and calendar.  I sync everything by using the sync icon in the menu bar several times a week.

Also possibility to create chapters is important.\nAs far as I know (correct me), just setting the type to audio book for an audio file does not enable all the audiobook features in iTunes.\nDo recommend only solutions that are working in Lion, for example the Audiobook Maker doesn't work because it contains some PPC apps inside.\n\nA: I’m sorry; I don’t know any free apps, but I can suggest two paid apps, if that’s any use.\nThere’s an app called Audiobook Wizard that I used a year or so ago, under Snow Leopard, that seemed reasonably fast and easy to use.\nHowever, it’s a paid app ($4.99) offered through the Mac App Store: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/audiobook-wizard/id460967298?mt=12. This is apparently Lion compatible and a decent audiobook editor. I haven’t tested this version though.\nThe developer also offers a free version, which can be downloaded from his site: http://www.audiobookwizard.com/. This only supports Snow Leopard and below, because it has PowerPC components, but you might like to download it to get a feel for the app.\nThere’s also Audiobook Builder. Again, this is a paid app ($5.99) in the Mac App Store: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/audiobook-builder/id406226796?mt=12. I haven’t used this before, and I’m not sure if it’s Lion compatible. A cursory search of the forums on the developer’s website doesn’t find any problems, so it might be ok. Might be worth trying; not sure.\n\nYou’re right about .m4a and .m4b files. This isn’t so much a problem with iTunes, as the file types. .m4b files have the capacity to “bookmark” parts of the file that .m4a doesn’t. From the Wikipedia page on MPEG-4 Part 14:\n\nAudio book and podcast files, which also contain metadata including chapter markers, images, and hyperlinks, can use the extension .m4a, but more commonly use the .m4b extension. An .m4a audio file cannot \"bookmark\" (remember the last listening spot), whereas .m4b extension files can.\n\n", "Q: How do I force iTunes Match to re-evaluate certain tracks I have a little over 9000 songs. Between yesterday and this morning, iTunes Match is finally done evaluating and uploading songs, and it seems to have made a few mistakes.\nIf I show the iCloud Status column in my song list, in a number of albums I'll see \"Matched\" for most of the tracks, but \"Uploaded\" for one or more track. If I look up that song/album/artist on the iTunes Store, Apple has those songs. I've even looked at the track info to see if they might have been encoded differently, but on the few I've spot checked they have the same encoding as the other songs in the album that were matched.\nI've been able to force iTunes Match to re-evaluate songs that showed \"Error\" before (no errors now), but I can't seem to figure out how to force it to re-evaluate these songs that were non-matches even though they're in the store. How do we do this? Do I turn off iTunes Match and start over again? I've been reluctant to do so considering how long it took yesterday.\n\nA: The least destructive approach I've found is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*On an iOS device, force- or long-press on the song in question in the Music app, and select Delete from Library.\n\n*On the Mac, wait for the iCloud Status to change to Removed.\n\n*On the Mac, right click the track and choose Add to iCloud Music Library.\n\n\nDoing it this way ensures that the song is never removed from your iTunes database, just from the iCloud Music Library.\nUnfortunately, I haven't found a way to force the removal from iCloud Music Library within iTunes, without also deleting song from the local iTunes database. Maybe it would be possible with a second iTunes library that doesn't have the songs locally…\nI originally scanned my library when iTunes Match was first released, and re-adding the Uploaded tracks now is yielding about a 30% Matching rate, with 70% just becoming Uploaded again.\nThis approach is working for me as of iTunes 12.9.5.5 (on macOS 10.14.6) and iOS 13.2.3.\n\nA: When you view your library from the web interface of Apple Music, you can directly remove items from your iCloud Music library, without affecting the files on your local database.\n\nAfter deleting the items, make sure to \"Update Cloud Library\", and check they are \"Removed\"\n\n\nA: You may not be able to get complete matches, but here's what I have been doing in the cases where one or two tracks don't match.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the item(s) to attempt to re-match.\n\n*Right-click on them, and select \"Create AAC Version\"\n\n*When this is complete, hit alt-backspace, and choose to remove both the original and the iCloud version. Also choose to delete the items from disk.\n\n*Go to the \"Store\" -> \"Update iTunes Match\" menu item.\n\n\nNote that this will keep the play counts, etc on your tracks. It may not succeed on every track, and sometimes repeating the process picks up another track.\nOccasionally, I'll get a \"Removed\" icon there after doing this: just right-click and choose \"Add to iCloud\" on these.\n\nA: Try deleting the \"uploaded\" ones from the service & run Match again to see if it does better the second time around.\n\nA: Worth a try: change the tracks \"Kind\" to something else than music and then change back?\n(not able to test myself unfortunately)\n\nA: Select and right click one track or multiple tracks and select \"Check Selection\".

It mainly seems to be repeating events that have the problem. Any ideas about what may be causing this?\n\nA: Have you checked your www.iCloud.com account to see if the events are editable/duplicated or have any errors in fact. Also check your icloud settings and make sure in (Mail-Contacts-Calendars) you only have one calendar synced, and make that one you iCloud one.\n\nA: I had the same problem.

This was all originally created on my Mac.\nThe Fix:\nWhat I did to correct this was, on my iPad, in iCal, touch the \"Calendars\" button in the top left corner.  In \"From my Mac\" I unchecked the Quicken Data calendar.  All the events disappeared.  I created a new calendar and recreated the events I wanted.  Everything works as expected for me now!\n\nA: You can fix this if you use a mac, delete event from your iCal then sync iPhone in itunes and go to info, calendar, sync whatever you save as, i.e, home, work, etc then push sync. If you deleted event from your iCal once you sync the event goes away\n\nA: I had an event in my iPad but it didn't appear on the iPhone or the Mac.  \nThere was no delete or decline option, but as soon as I changed the calendar it was sitting in, Decline showed up and I was able to remove it.\n\nA: I was having this problem also, Here is what I did, Hope it helps someone.\nI had made Calendar events on my iMac which ranged over a week or more, and I was unable to edit these on my iPad.\nI noticed that if the event was only 1 day I had no problem editing on the iPad , and also that I could edit all events even the longer ones from my iPhone or from iCloud.\nWhat is needed on the iPad is to change from month view to day view and then I can edit the long events just fine. \n", "Q: Mac kernel panic - memory problem I have a Early-2011 MacBook Pro base model. It has 4GB of RAM, and I use it for heavy development work. \nIt shows a pattern of continuously dumping into a black screen which asks me to restart (a kernel panic) almost once a week. It seems that I don't have enough RAM, as today I had Xcode, Eclipse and Firefox opened side by side (each of these apps are memory hogs), and when I opened iCal and Safari, I got a kernel panic.\nI tried a free memory application available in the App Store, and it said that before opening these two applications I had 22 MB free memory and 1.1 GB inactive memory out of 4 GB total memory. It looks like inactive memory is not getting freed (my understanding is that inactive memory is what the OS uses for fast app switching), and the OS simply crashes. Safari only had one tab open.\nWill additional RAM help or is there a different problem? I'm also using a Samsung 21.5\" monitor through mini DisplayPort to VGA connector if it matters.\nUpdate: this problem started occuring again: the system becomes slow then I get a kernel panic. Would upgrading RAM help? I have nearly 1GB of inactive memory.\n\nA: Did you disable your swap file? As ghoppe, bmike, and I mention in the top answers to this question, this is a bad idea for exactly the problems you're having.\nThe other option is that you have bad RAM. Run a memory checker (like Memtest86) to see it you have a bad stick or two and remove and replace the offending modules.\n\nA: The current memory in Lion is not suitable for developer-oriented task in my case, so I upgraded my RAM, seems like only thing that worked.\n\nA: I applied recent EFI firmware update v2.3 for early 2011 model and this problem seems to be rectified. And while the device becomes slower, it is not crashing. I opened multiple Android emulators (3), Eclipse, Xcode, everything on my doc and the system still seems to hold.\nSo, all in all, the problem seems to be fixed in new OS X update and hence the question is not relevant anymore.\nEDIT: The asker edited the question to say that they're experiencing the problem again, so this answer seems to be wrong/irrelevant.\n", "Q: Can I use Time Capsule as shared disk Can I use Time Capsule as shared disk (without any extra hardware)? I want to store my media there (e.g. photo)\n\nA: Just to add to the first answer, yes you can use it as a shared drive (I do) It will also work with PC's not just Macs, so for example if someone came round your house with a Dell laptop you could give them access to it. \nThis is a great way to share photos with friends, and also a good way to back up a PC as you will not be able to use Time Machine.\nTo answer the hardware issue, you will not need any additional hardware providing your computers have WiFi cards if not then you will need a WiFi adapter, or you could connect via ETHERNET.\n\nA: Yes you can. When you have the time Capsule connected to your home/office network, all other Mac's should be able to see that Time Capsule and with the right password should be able to access the data. \nYou can also use it as a Time Machine backup drive for various Mac's on the same network. \n", "Q: How to stop iPhone from \"erasing its contents\" when I want to \"manually manage\" it? In iTunes there is a checkbox to \"manually manage music and videos\". However when I tried clicking it, there's a popup saying that I can only do so after erasing all data on the phone:\n\nHow do I \"manually manage\" the phone without it erasing off its data?\n\nAfter trying bmike's answer below, the popup message still appears. Currently my \"Tones\" and \"Books\" are ticked (synced). If I try to unsync them, there's this message:\n\n\nA: The solution is a two part solution.\nIf you routinely want to sync one device with two libraries, the easiest manner is to disable all automatic syncing on the first iTunes library before you bring the iOS device to the second computer.\nYou can always wait for the \"erase\" warning and cancel the sync. (which is the point you have in your screenshot). At that point, go into the current device settings and turn off automatic sync for all of the categories that cause the warning dialog to appear. Keep in mind, that music, ringtones, and other settings can all get the warning to pop up, so your work may not be done by simply un-checking music. The settings on the computer you get the warning are in conflict with the settings from the previous computer so you have to reconcile that before the manual sync can start.\nOnce you have figured out all the \"silos\" that matter to you, you can easily take one device to multiple computers for backup but only certain computers for syncing. Using one computer to sync the data (contacts and calendar) and another for the media is a use case that Apple fully supports in iTunes. Once you set things up, you should not expect to have issues with a one device and many computers situation.\n\nA: Take a look at the answer to this Apple.SE question - it appears to have the answer to your question. You can try to transfer your purchases to the new iTunes account, since you mention that your other iTunes library is gone. Apps and ebooks should be transferable, but you may want to back up your music collection (if any) and handle that separately.\n\nA: I have found the solution for it. \n\n\n*\n\n*First of all download iExplorer on your Mac(Totally free software available)\n\n*Install it- You can click on \"Continue With Demo\"(so no need to purchase full version of it).\n\n*Now, connect your iPhone/iPod/iPad, iExplorer will detect it.\n\n*Now open Media folder, and you will see all your music files and data, now export it to any folder(please make new folder) whichever you like. It will start copying it to that folder - So your backup is ready now. (the names of all files are not as you are expecting).\n\n*Now, You are ready with your backup, so you can Erase and Sync your itunes, and can copy this backup again to your itunes without any risk.\n\n\nNote: Sometimes, in step 4, Apple detects that you are backing it up, so it will delete everything in your folder on mac as well as from your iDevice. If this thing happens to you, then there is another workaround to solve it.\nIn that case, open terminal on your mac and write this command in it, find ./ -name *.mp3 this will find all mp3 files on your mac(change mp3 to other file format whichever you want). Now, here you will find that files hidden in folder where you taken backup or in trash. Once you find that location, then right click on finder-> go to Folder -> paste that link over there, and you will be moved to some hidden folders, copy that files to somewhere else. \n", "Q: Removing songs from iCloud I would like to explicitly remove songs that I uploaded using iTunes Match, from the cloud. How is this done? And if I do remove the song, will it be automatically removed from all my devices?\n\nA: According to this support article from Apple, you have to delete it from your iTunes library and then it will prompt you to delete it from iCloud/iTunes Match as well. I don't know yet if there's a way to delete it from iCloud while keeping it in your iTunes library.\nIt does appear, if you follow these instructions, that it does automatically disappear from any iOS device set up with the same iTunes Match account.\n\nA: After a while I figured out how to do this.\nYou just press alt+Backspace while selecting a song and a windows pops up. Here you can mark the checkbox to remove the song from iCloud.\nApparently, there is no way to remove it from iCloud and keep it in your library, though.\n", "Q: Is \"Delete Duplicate\" offered by iTunes Match different from simple deletion? After enabling iTunes Match, songs that are recognized as duplicates are marked with an icon: \n\nClicking on this icon brings up a dialog offering to delete the duplicate:\n\nDoes \"Delete Duplicate\" do anything different from simply deleting the file in the usual way? In particular, since this approach does not support deletion of multiple files, can one simply select all files marked as duplicates and delete them to achive the same effect as clicking on these icons one by one?\n\nA: Careful.  There seem to be issues as to what iTunes selects as a Duplicate. If you delete any files - make sure that you search the song first. You may be being asked to delete a higher quality version or your DRM-free version.\nDon't delete any until they issue an update or more reviewers have spoken!!!\n\nA: The ways in which iTunes and iTunes Match identify duplicates is frustrating and outdated. If you have a track appear in two separate albums, iTunes Match will indeed identify it as duplicate tracks. I have been forced to use third party software to get rid of iTunes duplicates for real and recover tracks which were deleted by iTunes but were not duplicates.\nYou might want to have a look at this iLounge article concerning iTunes match. Look especially where it refers to the way in which iTunes Match identifies duplicates.\n", "Q: Can I apply my iPhone 3GS backup to my iPhone 4S? As mentioned is a previous question, I made a backup of my old AT&T iPhone 3GS, then exchanged it for a new iPhone 4S at Sprint.\nThey transfered over my contacts. However, there's a lot of other stuff in that backup that I'd like to have on the phone. All my applications and their various configurations. For example, my GPS app has two years worth of saved locations.\nOn top of that, it looks like not all my contacts got transfered over for some reason.\nSo my question is, can I restore the AT&T 3GS backup onto my Sprint 4S phone without messing up it's Sprint-specific configuration? Will doing so cause the phone to think it's connected to AT&T?\nAlso, how exactly do you restore a backup onto an iPhone?\n\nA: To restore from backup\n\n\n*\n\n*connect the iPhone to your computer\n\n*wait for it to appear in iTunes\n\n*right-click on the iPhone listed under Devices and select \"Restore from backup...\"\n\n*select the backup you want to restore (there may be several)\n\n\nRestoring will only touch user-specific content and configurations.\n\nA: You can restore pretty much any iPhone backup onto any other iOS hardware.\nShould you have made some settings changes for hardware that is no longer there, those will sit there unchanged and hidden until you restore that backup back onto a device that can use that setting.\nYou also don't have to worry about being hobbled - the software was designed to let you use all the new features even if you bring an older backup. The device will give you the new default settings for items that are absent in the old device.\n", "Q: How can I extract an .xz archive graphically on Mac OS X 10.4? Recent versions of StuffIt will extract .xz archives, but they will not run on Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger. And using something like Fink, it should be possible to install xz-utils on 10.4, so that .xz archives can be extracted from the Terminal.\nBut is there any graphical application that will run on Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, and which will extract .xz files?\nIt's OK if this application supports extracting .tar.xz archives in a single step, but not necessary, because if it extracts the .tar.xz file to a .tar file, even an older version of StuffIt can extract that.\n\nA: Not graphically, but this showed up in searches so for those of us who want to do it from the command line using Homebrew: \n$ brew install xz\n$ xz -d to-extract.xz\n\n\nA: The tar -xzf command didn't work for me, but I installed XZ utils http://macpkg.sourceforge.net/ and then unxz filename.tar.xz.  Then you can just use the command tar xf filename.tar to open the tarball.  I have OSX Mountain Lion (version 10.8.5).\n\nA: On a mac, you can open up the terminal and use the command tar -xzf filename.xz if you're not looking to download a new App just for .xz archives\n\nA: I've used the following native command on mac:\ngunzip filename.xz \n\nThis won't work on OS X Tiger (which was first released in 2005), but it works fine on more recent versions of macOS.\n\nA: MacOS 10.9 and later natively support xz (but the Finder works only on tar.xz files) according to a comment in reply to the similar excellent question at Can MacOSX 10.7 open tar.lzma files\nMy tests show the MacOS 10.11 Finder fails to graphically decompress plain xz files unless they contain tar format.  MacOS 10.10 suffers the same bug according to the article at https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/archive-utility-xz\nhowever the command line programs gunzip, gzcat and zcat automagically hack all xz files.\n\nA: I'd give The Unarchiver a try. It's free, graphical, supports 10.4 and can extract .xz archives. There is also a CLI version.\nAnother option is Keka it's free (as in beer, newer releases are not open source) and older versions support older releases of macOS. For those that prefer that, it's also available in the Mac App Store.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro screen dimming problems after EFI 2.3 update I recently updated my MacBook Pro to the latest firmware: EFI 2.3. Since then when my screen dims from idleness (while plugged in), it takes at least 5-10 seconds to come back on after I touch the trackpad, keyboard, or mouse. Everything worked fine before the EFI update.\nHas anyone else encountered this problem? If so, are there any solutions?\n\nA: This is what I did and it worked for me:\n\n1.Shut down the computer.\n2.Plug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if >its not already connected.\n3.On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time.\n4.Release all the keys and the power button at the same time.\n5.Press the power button to turn on the computer. \nNote: The LED on the MagSafe power adapter may change states or temporarily turn off when you reset the SMC.\n\n", "Q: How can I remove a site from the reading list in Safari on my iPhone? How do I edit the items in my \"reading list\" in Safari?  Unlike bookmarks, there doesn't seem to be an \"edit\" option.\n\nA: To remove an item, just swipe your finger to left over that particular entry. A red \"delete\" button will pop up. \n", "Q: Can you tunnel iPhone internet traffic through a local proxy on a Mac computer? I want to monitor the requests (and responses) my iPhone is sending via the internet. I have a web debugging proxy called Charles on my Mac, which I would like to use to monitor my iPhone's connections. It basically works by configuring a proxy to localhost and reading that data.\nI tried to share my internet connectiong my Mac, but I cannot both share my internet over Wi-Fi and connect to my Wi-Fi at the same time?\nHow can I accomplish this?\n\nA: You may want a second network adapter, but first try adding a second WiFi connection in the network preference pane.\nYou could pick a static IP address that is valid, but outside the DHCP's range (or reserved and not assigned via DHCP). Then your iPhone could proxy against the static IP and set up IP forwarding from the command line.\nIt would be easier to have a second interface and let the Mac software handle the routing for you. Also, be aware that firewalls should be off or configured to allow inbound traffic from the iPhone.\n", "Q: How can I upload audiobooks to iTunes Match, or sync w/out matching? I have numerous audiobooks that I've manually ripped to <96kbps mp3 format. The steps I've taken to adhere to Apple's iTunes Match policy to get these files available to match are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert track to m4a, automatically up-converted to a higher bit rate; now meets standards.\n\n*File size was over 200mb, so I ran it through splitting software, which brought the total size of each individual m4a down to ~64 MB.\n\n*Attempted to match the file, and received an \"Error\" message in return.\n\n*I followed Apple's recommendation and removed the tracks from iTunes, added again, and received the same message while syncing. \n\n\nIs there something I'm missing? Since these tracks don't sync, is there an alternative way to get these tracks on my iPhone so I can listen to them without syncing through iTunes Match? For some reason I can't set the metadata to AudioBook (Get Info -> Options -> Media Kind) since that is grayed out.\n\nA: First, you can save some space by only up-converting to 128kbps m4a or even mp3, perhaps that is what you did already.\nThe metadata Kind should probably be set as \"Music\" if not already.\nFinally, it's possible that Apple uses the audio fingerprinting to also detect whether it is music at all (but it seems unlikely).\n", "Q: How do you change the size of the images sent from an iPhone using MMS? I have an iPhone 4, my wife has a jailbroken iPhone 3G on Simple Mobile (T-Mobile's network).\nShe's able to send and receive MMS messages, but images that are taken on my iPhone are flagged as too large and she receives a message that she has received an image from me but it has been blocked due to size.\nOlder phones and other limited plans have this implementation, so this question should be useful to others.\nIs there a way to change the size of images when sending them via MMS like you can when emailing a picture on the iPhone?\nIf not, how can I work around this?\n\nA: One option is to add your wife's MMS e-mail address to her contact card and use that e-mail address to e-mail the picture to her phone.  When you send an image via e-mail, the iPhone will ask you what size you want to send (how much compression you want to do to the image). Choosing SMALL may allow it to go through. \nHere are a list of some SMS/MMS gateways that allow you to send a SMS/MMS via e-mail address:  List of SMS Gateways\nYou could also try using the free Adobe Photoshop Express app in the iTunes App Store to crop the image and save as a new image then try sending the smaller sized (both in dimensions and in bytes) image. A bit of a hassle, but the Messaging app does not have any built-in selectors for specifying the size.\n", "Q: Switch Between Apps With Alt-Tab / Command-Tab on iPad or iPhone using Bluetooth Keyboard I have both iOS devices and with keyboards. I could be much more productive if I could do Alt-Tab / Command-Tab app switching using my keyboard. Is there any way to do this? Is there any way to switch between the two most recent apps or anything similar?\n\nA: No, there isn't a way to do this. As an alternative, I would suggest enabling multitasking gestures (Settings > General > Multitasking Gestures). With them on, you can switch to the next/previous app with a four-finger swipe, instead of bringing up the multitasking bar. You can actually swipe through all of the apps in the multitasking bar, in the same order (order of last use). Note that getting to an app through this gesture does not change their order, so if you swipe left to get to an app, you will swipe right to go back.\n\nA: See here: http://richmintz.com/2011/04/ipad-app-switching-using-your-bluetooth-keyboard/\nI haven't tried it, but if your keyboard has a home button, you should be able to double click it to get the task switcher up. So it seems it should be easy.\n\nMethod copied from source\n\nFirst, you activate VoiceOver on the iPad, and specify that a Home button triple-press will turn VoiceOver on or off. Then, you just learn a few simple commands and practice, and a lot of common quickie things (like app switching, scrolling through web pages, etc.) become possible without taking your hands off the keyboard. This is most useful when, e.g., you’re writing a blog post on the iPad, in the WordPress app, using the keyboard, and you want to hop over to a web page for a second to check something. Now you can do that without your hands leaving the keyboard, as follows:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*press ctrl-opt-H twice to bring up the app switcher\n  \n*press right-arrow to move to Safari, then ctrl-opt-spacebar to tap\n  \n*press opt-down-arrow to scroll in Safari (or, if needed, right-arrow to move to the page selection button, etc.)\n  \n*when done, switch back, via ctrl-opt-H twice, then right-arrow as needed, then ctrl-opt-spacebar to tap\n  \n\n\nA: As of iOS 9 the ability to switch between apps is included in the operating system. Just hook up a keyboard and press command+tab to switch between apps.\n\n\nA: Edit: Below is pre-iOS9. See updated (accepted) answer below from Anonymous\nIn brief: It is possible, but not quite \"alt-tab\". Enable VoiceOver.\nThis is described here: http://decadentwaste.net/2011/03/navigate-using-a-bluetooth-keyboard-on-your-ios-device/\nI believe this is also referenced from Graham Wheeler's answer. Sorry that I can't comment directly.\nThe article describes how to use the built-in \"accessibility\" options to navigate pretty much anything with the keyboard. I've tried it out using the basic Apple Wireless keyboard, which doesn't have a home button for example. I can now scroll, launch apps, switch apps from the keyboard. \nNote, for comfort, I recommend setting the home button to enable/disable this voiceover mode. In addition, since the default for VoiceOver is to use spoken navigation for the UI, Opt-Control-S will mute the voiceover speech.\n\nA: If you're jailbroken, you can install BeeKeyboard and Multitasktures to do this.\n\nA: It's been added in iOS 9 or it was on before. I use an Anker Bluetooth keyboard.  I can Alt Tab just fine with it! \n", "Q: Is it possible to use iTunes Match to replace my existing metadata with metadata from the iTunes Store? My music in my iTunes library has come from many sources over the years, and it's filled with incomplete or inaccurate or simply missing data, not to mention the fact that most of my stuff doesn't have album art associated with it.\nI had hoped that as part of the 256kbps 'upgrade' functionality that iTunes would also upgrade the metadata on my songs to the metadata that they ship with the iTunes Store purchases. However, deleting and redownloading a matched song only upgrades the audio data, but keeps the metadata intact. Is there a way to upgrade the metadata as well?\n\nA: No - the design clearly is intended to honor whatever set of metadata you have currently entered into your library. As you have discovered, the matching process can find songs based on other criteria and re-downloading the \"canonical\" AAC 256 kbps stereo will not currently fill in any metadata holes or correct parts of the metadata that do not match what Apple has in the store (or it's Match database for songs that are not for sale like the AC/DC catalog)\nI can see two reasons for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intentional - preserve user customization where the data may be better on the individual customer iTunes database.\n\n*Not automating the process of cleaning up songs that may have been passed or downloaded rather than ripped when connected to a metadata lookup server or otherwise encoded by the official artist when it was sold or released.\n\n\nI specifically have hundreds of Hawaiian songs where I've entered the metadata with the help of a native speaker to have the correct punctuation (and that doesn't match Apple's punctuation). There certainly is a great need for a tool to help people manage this, but iTunes Match isn't that tool today.\n\nA: At least for the missing data you could try out matchTag (German page). It claims that it will replace missing data directly with Apple's data when you (re)load the songs with iTunes Match.\n\nA: I haven't tried iTunes Match yet, so I don't know if the following is already working.\nApple should give the users the ability to \"Get track names\" option in iTunes once you subscribe. For now that service is only allowed for CD's imported directly into iTunes.\nThat way would be the users choice to upgrade the meta-data of the matched songs. And almost everything they need to enable that is already implemented.\nI have been able to fetch some album artwork directly from iTunes, so that part should work already. I suppose the albums it does not get the artwork for are not recognized in their database.\n", "Q: Severe Wifi dropping on Macbook Pro - Have to restart to turn back on I have a 17\" Early 2008 Macbook Pro running lion 10.7.2. And about 3 weeks ago, this problem started occurring where my interent would stop working randomly. I go to toggle the Wi-Fi on and off, but when I try to turn Wi-fi on, it does nothing and the wifi icon remains an empty wedge.\nTrying to turn Wi-Fi on from System preferences also does nothing - same empty signal.\nBut if I restart my Mac I can get on Wi-Ffi normally and it will last from a couple hours to a couple minutes till it drops again and I need to restart to get back on.\nI searched all over the web for a solution and tried to \n\n\n*\n\n*reordering wifi above the other service in System Preferences\n\n*deleting 'SystemConfiguration' folder in under library>preferences\n\n*reinstalling Lion from recovery disk\n\n*Reset PRAM\n\n*Reset SMC\n\n\nNothing works. And I haven't found anyone on the web with the same problem.\nHas anyone seen this problem before? Is it a Lion issue? Or is it hardware, like a messed up airport card?\nAny help would be so greatly appreciated.\nUPDATE\nFor anyone else who may stumble upon this issue, I've been dealing with this issue for a couple weeks and took it to the genius bar. After having me completely wipe my harddrive and do a fresh install of the OS and manual install of all my programs, It is conclusively a hardware problem. And the fix is to have your airport card replaced. Which is about $120.\n\nA: I would strongly agree that in most cases, when WiFi signal starts strong after a reboot (when the hardware is up to normal operating temperatures) and then degrades over minutes, it is most likely a symptom that the amplifier is failing and the WiFi card (or router) needs to be replaced.\nYou can hold the option key down when selecting WiFi in the menu bar and watch the Transmit Rate and RSSI change over time. A repeatable, measurable drop in transmit rate would back up the hardware fault as a cause for this.\n\nA: My macbook (late 2008) refused to get wifi from airport some months ago. The MacCleanse app worked for me. Run \"scan and delete\" with it (loaded recommended set). Now my macbook has kept wi-fi for several days now, without a single drop.\n", "Q: Icon source graphics? I need to create a \"document\" icon for an application on the mac, and I need a source \"blank page\" image to use for it. Is Apple OK with using their own blank page icon as the backing for your icon?

The system provided images, as\n  defined in Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for the Mac OS and the\n  iPhone OS, that are created and owned by Apple (\"System Provided\n  Images\") are licensed to you solely for the purpose of developing Mac\n  and iPhone applications respectively using the Developer Software.\n\nI am not a lawyer, and there are further restrictions, but it is good form to stick with the provided templates unless you have a good reason and the time/skills/money to invent your own.\n", "Q: What is an easy way to back up MacBook running 10.5.8? What's an easy way to back up the files on a Macbook that is running OS 10.5.8  ?\nAs far as I can see, I think iCloud only works with 10.7.2 and above, and MobileMe is not accepting new accounts...\n\nA: TimeMachine might be the easiest way to back things up on a regular basis. You'll need any old external drive and a few clicks of the mouse.\nIf you have more specific needs, feel free to edit your question to refine for what you are looking.\n\nA: Agree with bmike - TimeMachine is your best bet for an integrated system backup solution. If you're only looking to manually back up certain files, then a free solution like DropBox might work for you.\n\nA: While I agree that TimeMachine is an excellent tool (and I use it) I prefer SuperDuper! or Carbon Copy Cloner. They make a complete, bootable clone of your entire hard disk.\nIf anything happens to your computer and you have a complete backup (everything including system and all files in bootable form) you can get a new computer, boot from the backup and be back in business in very short order.\nIf you're serious about this get a decent 7200 rpm firewire 800 external HD and back up your entire computer every day. Both SD and CCC have smart backup features so you're just backing up the differences, not the entire HD again, so, while the first backup takes some time, subsequent backups are quite fast.\nThis setup has saved my bacon a few times and I've been backing up like this for many years. TimeMachine has a wonderful UI for finding individual files you may have lost and I back up with it as well, but I also make a bootable clone of my working computer every day and while no setup is fail safe I feel pretty secure with this process.\nhttp://shirtpocket.com/\nhttp://www.bombich.com/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Rugged-Triple-Firewire-Portable-301983/dp/B0058BDFXA/ref=dp_ob_title_ce\n", "Q: How do I use the keypad on my iPhone to dismiss autocorrect? When I type a word that my iPhone doesn't like I get provided a suggest word. I can press space to accept this word and go onto the next word or I can click on the \"x\" to close it and use the word I typed.\nFor example \"Syndey Gumtree\" gets changed to \"Sydney hunters\".\nIs there a way I can dismiss the suggested word without using my finger to press on the \"x\"? I know I can hit delete and then retype the last letter, but is there a single click way of doing this.\nIt is a hassle because sometimes I need to zoom in or the x is too small.\nI am on iOS 4.2.1\n\nA: If you update to iOS 5, you can go into Settings > General > Keyboard and add \"Sydney Hunters\" to automatically be replaced with \"Sydney gumtree\".\n\nA: I'm not a fan of providing these answers, but here goes.\nNope.\nAs you have already said the only way to do it without hitting the 'x' is to backspace one and retype the letter.\nWhat you can do is remove auto-correct altogether.\nSettings > General > Keyboard > Auto-correction.\nIn iOS 5 if you turn this off you can still have check spelling turned on, which will mark the incorrect spellings so you can change them all at once when you are finished typing.\n\nA: Just so you're aware, when you press the \"x\" on the auto correct suggestion, iOS remembers this preference and will not correct that entry in the future. It may take 1-3 times of pressing \"x\" for it to remember, but after that you're good to go.\n\nA: The 'x' is small, but you don't have to tap directly on it, just tap in the general area/over the word suggestion and it will go away - the area you can hit is quite big.\n", "Q: How can I automatically upload files to remote server when I make changes I want to automatically upload files to a remote server when I make any changes in them using some editor. Is there some app which I can use for this purpose? \nI know that this kind of thing is available in Panic Coda, but I want to continue using my favorite editor instead of switching to Coda.\n\nA: It may depend on what type of files and what type of connection to the server you're using, but a good starting point would probably be Cyberduck, an FTP/SFTP client. You can open files directly off the server with any program on your Mac you choose, edit them as you would a local file (I believe they're actually stored in temporary local storage), and uploaded whenever your changes are saved.\nMost other FTP programs should have this functionality built in as well.\n", "Q: How can I open port 8080 of Mac OS X Lion? How can I open access to port 8080 from the outside world (private lan) on my Mac OS X Lion? I'd like to access a webpage that's running on my lamp stack on my mac (zend server ce) from within the lan. I can access port 80 just fine.  Port 8080 is blocked on the other hand.  I've also disabled the firewall.\n\nA: When you say that you disabled the firewall, do you mean the one in:\nSystem Preferences > Security > Firewall, or the ipfwIP Firewall that you can access from the command line? Or perhaps both?\nTo check to see if you have ipfw rules, you can always go to the terminal and type in:\nsudo ipfw list\nYou might also use nmap to check if the port is open from different places on your internal network. Of course, OS X doesn't comes with nmap by default, so you would have to try that from a Linux machine or use something like Fink or Macports to install it.\nnmap -p 8080 host.domain.com\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: You can disable firewall or you can allow a certain application to accept incoming connections. Plus to allow access to the outside world (e.g www), you'll need to forward traffic to your internal gateway:port via your router settings.\nHere's how to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac->Sys Preferences->Sharing->Enable “Web Sharing” checkbox\n\n*Mac->Sys Preferences->Security-> Turn off firewall, or allow your application to accept incoming connection\n\n*Open a port on the router (via 192.168.1.1) to forward traffic from your_web_ip:port to a local_gateway:port\n\n\n*\n\n*Router Settings -> Port Forwarding -> create rule: forward to local gateway (e.g. 192.168.1.4), custom port, protocol tcp, source=any, destination=3280, all connection types, forward to port = 8080.\n\n\n\nDone. Now from the remote computer, open your browser to your web ip address (find via http://www.whatismyip.com/) + destination port# above, e.g. 72.189.194.65:3280, this will connect to your local 192.168.1.4:8080\n\nA: In MAC OSX - Changing the httpListenAddress for Jenkins on OSX\nI installed Jenkins via homebrew and wanted the web interface to be accessible over the network.

There is no common folder all the shares are in, they are just mounted as \\\\SERVER\\Share_Name. I want to be able to have a script that cycles through all the shares on a server (even if the folder names are unknown at the time the script is created), and create a backup on a local folder on my Mac. Or, if there's an easier way than a script, or drag-and-drop (that doesn't seem to always copy all the files)\n\nA: There's no root in Samba protocol. To list shares on your server you can use smbutil(1):\n$ smbutil view //Administrator@10.211.55.8/ | awk '$2==\"Disk\"{print $1}'\nADMIN$    \nC$        \n\nand then use output with mount_smbfs(8):\nsmbutil view //Administrator@10.211.55.8/ | awk '$2==\"Disk\"{print $1}' | while read sharename; do \n  mkdir ${BASE}/${sharename}; \n  mount_smbfs //Administrator@10.211.55.8/${sharename} ${BASE}/${sharename};\ndone\n\nPlease, read man pages to check other options I haven't used here.\nThe best utility to make backup I know is rsync(1).

It's been working great for several months, but I'm trying to do what I can to get her to make use of its full capabilities.\nOne of the things I wanted to do was help her organize her contacts. Right now she's just using a dumb phone, but it's got Bluetooth and I'd love to find a way to transfer contacts from her iPad to the phones address book. I'm pretty sure this is a no-go with the built-in iOS functionality, but are there any apps that can do this?\n\nA: This is not likely to happen, as you need to mannualy accept a bluetooth data transfer, so it will not sync exactly, what you are doing is basicly sending a contact card to the phone. \nSource - my Mom and her really dumbphone.\n\nA: Take a look at BitPim.\nIt allows you to connect via USB to the filesystem of many dumb phones and extract address, calendar, etc., data therein.\n", "Q: How to tell if it is Wireless-G or Wireless-N that the iMac is using?

I've upgraded to iTunes 10.5.1, which the release notes claim includes the widely publicized iTunes Match feature, but I can't find any way to purchase and enable it. How do I enable iTunes Match?\n\nA: If you're located outside the US, iTunes Match is unavailable for the time being, due to content licensing deals.\nWhen iTunes Match was first announced I believe Apple stated they would be working on bringing it to more countries, but these negotiations always take some time. Hard to give a definite timeframe unless Apple announces something.\n\nA: Users outside the USA as has been mentioned will not have the service due to licensing however for those in the USA searching for the answer, and (if) it rolls out worldwide, you can set up iTunes match by clicking on iTunes Match just under the iTunes store in the left had plane and follow the steps.\nYou will need one of the following devices running iOS 5.0.1 or higher,\niPad / 2\niPhone 3GS or above\niPod Touch 3rd Gen or higher \nYou will get an option to use the paid for service as a yearly subscription or just use the free version.\n\nUpdate\niTunes match was released worldwide in December 2011\n", "Q: what is Siri consuming? is Wifi enough? or 3g celluar data is involved while Siri searches online? So I am concerned if I can save data usage(I have only 200M per month on my account..) by using Siri at home(with a wifi connection)??\n\nA: You will save on data usage if you only use Siri at home with a wifi connection. Siri sends the raw audio of your talking to its servers, so the data usage will be comparable to using VoIP. Although that's only if you talk constantly to Siri (which I'm actually seeing some people at work doing these days).\n", "Q: What is the safest way to move the iTunes Library from one hard drive to another? This may happen later with my iMac, but right now it is happening for my iTunes on PC.  The PC had 60GB of partition to install Windows 7, and right now it is down to about 2GB of free space.  All iTunes purchases, including Music and Movies, are downloaded to\nC:\\Users\\mike\\Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Media\\Music \nC:\\Users\\mike\\Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Media\\Movies\n\nwhich will make the C: drive have less and less free space.  (and C: will be more healthy if it has at least a couple of GB of free space).  What is the safest, most proper way to migrate all the media to an external hard drive J: ?  On J:, the path might be:\nJ:\\iTunes\\iTunes Media\\Music\n\nor\nJ:\\iTunes Media\\Music\n\nMy guess is that we can change the folder in iTunes, but won't iTunes go to that folder or create it, and find nothing, and index everything wrong?\nSo, should an exact copy of C:\\Users\\mike\\Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Media be made as J:\\iTunes Media first (probably 30GB of files copying), and then start iTunes and change the preference for the folder to the J: one?  Is there a standard or official method to do this?\n\nA: Gary Rosenzweig of \"MacMost Now\" video podcasts has done a very nice 6 minute tutorial.\nMacMost Now 631: Moving Your iTunes Media To an External Drive\n\n\"If your internal drive is getting full and you want to move your iTunes music to an external drive, you can do so by using\n  functions built right into iTunes. Keep your iTunes Library on your\n  internal drive, but move your music to an external drive. That way you\n  move the bulk of your files to your external drive, but keep all of\n  the primary functionality of your iTunes Library on your internal\n  one.\"\n\nYou can watch this video at the link below:\nhttp://macmost.com/moving-your-itunes-media-to-an-external-drive.html\n\nA: You're actually on to the right approach. This Apple support article details the following approach for Windows (and this is the approach for a Mac user):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes.\n\n*Choose Edit > Preferences.\n\n*Click the Advanced tab in the Preferences window.\n\n*Select the \"Keep iTunes Media folder organized\" checkbox.\n\n*Click OK.\n\n\nIf you haven't been letting iTunes keep your media organized up until now, you'll have to wait while it sorts everything out. Could take a few hours. Have beverages handy.\nOnce it's done sorting things out you can change the location of the iTunes library and iTunes will shuffle everything over to the new spot. From that article:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes.\n\n*From the Edit menu, choose Preferences.\n\n*Click the Advanced tab in the Preferences window.\n\n*Click the Change button in the iTunes Media folder location pane.\n\n*In the Change Media Folder Location window that appears, navigate to the location where you would like your new Media folder to be created.\n\n*Click the Make New Folder button in the Change Media Folder Location window.\n\n*Enter the name of the new iTunes Media folder.\n\n*Click OK in the Change Media Folder Location window. Click OK in the Advanced window.\n\n*\n\n*For iTunes 9 and 10: Choose File > Library > Organize Library\n\n*For iTunes 8: Choose File > Library > Consolidate Library\n\n*For iTunes 7 or earlier: Choose Advanced > Consolidate Library.\n\n\n*A message will pop up.\n\n*\n\n*For iTunes 9 and 10: Place a check next to \"Consolidate files\" and click OK.\n\n*For iTunes 8 and earlier: Click Consolidate.\n\n\n*After the folder has been copied, locate your original iTunes Media folder, and drag it to the Recycle Bin. Important: Don't remove the iTunes Library files that may be in the same location as the iTunes Media folder. For more information about the iTunes Library files, see What are the iTunes Library files?\n\n*Quit and reopen iTunes.\n\n*\n\n*If you receive the alert: \"The folder containing \"iTunes Library.itl\" cannot be found and is required. Please create or choose an iTunes library,\" you most likely moved the iTunes Library files. If this is the case, move them out of the Recycle Bin and back to where they were.\n\n*If you do not encounter the above alert when opening and closing iTunes, empty the Recycle Bin.\n\n\n\nCirca iTunes 9.x I used this (nearly) same approach to move my library from my main hard drive on my iMac to my Drobo and can confirm that it works.\n\nA: Use mount points or Junctions (similar to hard links/soft links on unix/OS X)\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_junction_point\n(only works on a local directory and is similar to hard links)\nor if you are on a different volume, consider mounting the remove filesystem directly onto the path where you want your data to be stored. (Do this in Disk MAnagement console)\nAnyway, the following utility may help you do it right:\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768\n\nA: Pay the $30 and throw it all up on iTunes Match. Then wait while it syncs. Then you've got it in the cloud to be pulled down on any copy of iTunes or any iOS device you want to get to it from.\nThat's the safest. Not the cheapest, but the safest, and one of the easiest\n", "Q: Limiting network access for individual applications, on a per-WIFI-SSID basis? Today I am out-of-office and have to use my iPhone's tethering abilities to get my MacBook Pro online.\nI have an online backup utility, CrashPlan, that immediately noticed that I had connectivity, and started backing up.\nSince the data plan on my phone does not include unlimited data (at least not without having to pay extra per MB at some point), I stopped it immediately.\nIs there a way for me to configure my MBP so that when I connect to the iPhone's WIFI hotspot, some applications are denied bandwidth, either built-in or through 3rd party applications?\n\nA: Use ipfw to bind a rule to your specific interface, blocking the site in question outright. For example, if CrashPlan's IP is 224.2.2.4, the rule would write as follows:\nipfw deny ip from 224.2.2.4 to me in via en0\n\nThe \"ip\" tag blocks all traffic (tcp and udp, alternatively, you can set either or if you like). The IP address can be set to a range for more efficacy (e.g., 224.2.2.0/24). The \"me\" tag is self-explanatory. Alternatively, you can actually set that up to a specific IP address too. So if your home network assigns you 172.16.1.4 and tethering assigns you 168.128.1.5, then you can further ensure you only block the site when tethered, and not all the time. The \"in\" tag deals with direction of the traffic (in or out). And \"via en0\" deals with binding it to a specific interface.\nYou can also set ipfw to launch during boot, so you don't have to run this manually all the time. It's not a trivial process but does require some cli. Alternatively, you could check out WaterRoof. It's a free ipfw front-end that pretty much automates the entire thing. A terrific ipfw primer and setup assistant.\n\nA: I haven't done this, but this the direction that I would explore: download Sidekick which is a utility that allows you to do all sorts of location based configuration. Setup a Location based on your iPhone's Hotspot and create an actions to turn Crashplan on and off via the command line. \nCrashplan can be stopped via the command line with:\nsudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.crashplan.engine.plist\n\nand started with:\nsudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.crashplan.engine.plist\n\nNot a direct solution for you, but Crashplan now offers a small menu bar app, that allows you to monitor the backup activity and easily manually pause backups.\n\nA: CrashPlan now has a way to block specific wifi networks. http://support.code42.com/CrashPlan/Latest/Configuring/Network. \nWhat I really want is the inverse: to allow only specific (trusted) wifi networks. And to ignore by default anything else, like airport and hotel wifi.\n", "Q: How can I upload my whole iPhoto-Library to flickr? Is there any plugin or other tool that I can use to upload my whole iPhoto Library to flickr? What do I need to do with that tool?\n\nA: You can also do this natively with iPhoto, although FlickrExport by Connected Flow does offer some additional features. If you go to Preferences - Accounts you can add your Flickr account and it will allow you to share your photos and albums natively.\n\n\nA: You can use plugins like Connected Flow its quite cheap at £12.\nOnce installed it adds the ability to share images with a flickr account.\nThis works in the same was as the iPhoto Facebook uploader, you select all the images, at the bottom right where you find the share button (for Facebook, email, etc.) you will also see a Flickr option, use this.\n\nA: The \"sharing\" feature in iPhoto is not designed to upload your whole library to Flickr. Neither is Connected Flow. They work with a subset of selected photos. I came up empty handed in my own search for a tool that would upload and synchronize my iPhoto Library with Flickr. I ended up programming my own tool. I successfully used it to upload my whole iPhoto library to flickr, which took about 3 days for 36,000 photos, including metadata synchronization. Unfortunately, it is not reliable enough to share (sorry for the tease). Flickr has a great API (Application Programming Interface), which is how my program communicates with Flickr. Flickr's App Garden is where applications which use the Flickr API are registered, and also a good place to discover new and existing applications. http://www.flickr.com/services/\nNote that a program that uploads an entire iPhoto library to Flickr would not necessarily need to be a plug-in. It could be a stand alone application. Internally, iPhoto uses an sql database to store data. It is rather accessible for programming purposes. An application that interfaces with this database and the Flickr API could do what you want. \nI recommend monitoring Flickr's App Garden for new applications and hope that one that does what you want appears soon. \n\nA: This is an old question but since I have found a pretty cool solution and none of the listed here, by today, have been useful for me, I just wanted to share it here with you guys.\nI'm using this python script: https://github.com/elek/puploadr\nJust use your iPhoto Library Masters subfolder (it should be at: ~/Pictures/iPhoto Library/Masters/) as parameter and use it.\nIf something goes wrong just re-run the command and it will skip already uploaded pics and/or videos.\n\nA: this works like a charm! \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/backup-to-flickr-for-iphoto/id733300407?mt=12\nFull backup of your iphoto or aperture library. all structure is kept\n", "Q: Is there a way of listening to your podcasts at a faster speed in itunes 10.5 I have a backlog of all my favourite podcasts and i was wondering if I could speed up the rate at which they play to say 1.5 or 2.0 of the normal speed \n\nA: This feature is not available in iTunes, but you can choose the playback speed on the iPod or iPhone. By playing it there and synchronizing back to iTunes, it will mark your backlog items as played.\n\nA: If this podcast was created by you (or you have the audio file), you could try to use Audacity. Here's their description:\n\nAudacity is an easy-to-use, multi-track audio editor and recorder for\n  Windows, Mac OS X, GNU/Linux and other operating systems. Developed by\n  a group of volunteers as open source.\n\nBasically, download it, and then drag your file into the main window. Then select track > Cmd+A > Effect (menu) > Change temp (not rate) > Check Use high quality stretching (slow) > Adjust your rate > click okay. Then, export it (File > Save other). Chose your desired filetype, etc. Drag the file back into iTunes.\nYou'll also need to change the track back to a podcast, so right click it > cmd+i > Options > media kind > Podcast. It'll now be in your podcast folder.\n", "Q: Tab through buttons \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I select buttons with just the keyboard? \n\nHow do I tab through buttons?\nIf I use the tab key it will change the selection (blue background glow) however if I press enter, it will always choose the default option.\nSee the screenshots for what I mean:\n\n\n\nA: You need to press the space bar whilst on the highlighted button (the one with the halo around it).

I have tried AirMusic, but that creates a pull DNLA server, which is not what I want.\n\nA: The easiest way imho would be to buy an AppleTV2. It's cheap, and \"it just works\".\nEdit: For completeness sake, I'll just clarify what you can expect from the AppleTV2. Since it is an AirPlay compatible reciever for both audio and video, you can stream music or videos being played on your iPad (or iPhone/iTunes for that matter) directly to your TV. On your computer, you can even stream any audio source through software like Airfoil. Starting with iOS5, AirPlay even allows you to mirror your iPad on the television set.\nAdditionally, if you enable Home Sharing in iTunes on a connected computer, your iPad can serve as a remote to play content (audio/video) in your iTunes library directly on the TV. For this usecase the content doesn't even need to be on the iPad. You'll just need the Remote app by Apple, available for free in the App Store. The only downside here is that your computer (and iTunes) need to be powered up to access the media.\n", "Q: The Apple TV 2 has 110V/220V PSU or just 110V? I'm going to the USA, and I am planning to buy an Apple TV there for use it in Europe.\nWhy I should do that?\nBecause the $99 Apple TV is sold in Europe for €120 ($170). Why pay almost the double for the same stuff?\nOK, so the core question: is the internal Apple TV 2 PSU 110V/220V, or just 110V for units sold in the USA?\n\nA: This US Apple Store webpage says that the current Apple TV (2) has:\n\nPower: Built-in 6-watt universal power supply\n\nSo yes, it looks like it will be fine in Europe.\n\nA: Yes, according to Apple TV on Apple Online Store description page, the power is a Built-in 6-watt universal power supply. \nBut another important thing needs to check is to see if the power plug matches the socket in your country. \n\nA: I bought it and I confirm that the US version works fine with european 220V/50hz (fine print on the box says also 110V/220V compatibility)\n\nA: Yes it works 100%. I used an old figure 8 cable, ran it straight from 220V 50Hz socket and the Apple TV worked great.\n", "Q: How can I install iPhone Simulator 4.2 on Xcode 4.2?

If I move the Root_Folder/ to ~/, Finder would like to change, while in column view, the view settings for my home directory and so on…\nI'd rather like to know a GUI answer, but if it is much easier via command line, it's OK by me.\nAll in all, the question boils down to: How do I open the active folder's view settings in Finder while browsing in column view?\n\nA: Workaround\n\n\n*\n\n*While in Finder (in any view) drag the Column_Folder/ to the Finder's sidebar.\n\n*Select the Column_Folder/ from the sidebar\n\n*Switch to column view\n\n*Show view settings\n\n*\n\n*You can see the view settings will now affect the intended folder\n\n\n*Tick \"Always open in column view\"; click OK\n\n*Remove Column_Folder/ from the sidebar\n\n\nNow Column_Folder/ will open in column view!\n\nA: Note that if a folder is not shown in the sidebar, it won't usually be the root folder of any window in column view.\nAlso \"Always open in column view\" means \"save a folder-specific view mode for this folder in the .DS_Store file of the parent folder\". If you check \"Always open in column view\" and switch to list view, the folder-specific view mode becomes list view.\nSo if you add ~/Desktop/untitled folder/ to the sidebar, open untitled folder, and check \"Always open in column view\", the folder-specific view mode is saved to ~/Desktop/.DS_Store. If you remove ~/Desktop/untitled folder/ from the sidebar, it will never be the root folder of a column view window. But if you open ~/Desktop/untitled folder/ in list view and close the window, the folder-specific view mode becomes list view.\n", "Q: How can I buy a new 8GB iPhone 3GS that still has iOS 4? My contract with AT&T is up for renewal. My wife has an iPhone 3G. I'd like to use my renewal to score her a free upgrade to a 3GS.\nShe's on T-Moble and so needs to have her phone jailbroken and unlocked. \nI read that all new 3GS models are now bundled with iOS 5. \nHow can I buy a new 8GB iPhone 3GS that still has iOS 4?  Is the packaging any different?  Are there any telltale signs that indicate firmware version before purchase?\n\nA: Firstly im not sure the phone needs to be jailbroken and if a contract is up the carrier is required to give instructions on how to unlock.\nThe packaging is not different.\nNot all 3GS models are bundled with iOS5. I would look at some websites that do not sell a lot of these phones, ask shops how long they have had the particular model in stock, if the had them for over 2 months then you're in luck.\nYou could also look to buy a second hand model, which hasn't had an update.\nCan I ask why you do not want iOS5?\n\nA: In short you can't. Apple has a very efficient supply chain so the window where they sell devices that aren't the latest version is very limited.\nOn occasion a service replacement unit can sit in the \"supply\" chain a bit longer, so I have seen several people still getting phones from the Genius Bar / AppleCare with iOS 4 loaded. I would expect that to be mostly over as well.\nYou will likely have to find a seller of a device and you can always ask for the serial number or look for one with AppleCare still active in case you have suspicions of the motivation of the seller.\n\n(and since you or others may wonder)\nThere really isn't a good way to tell if a phone has been stolen (no police database (and if there were it could always be reported stolen at a later date). Due to privacy concerns you can't get data on prior owners from Apple. You do run the risk of problems if the device you buy ends up being stolen goods. You do run the risk of having to do some work to ensure any return policy is workable if you need to locate the seller if the phone doesn't work as advertised.\n\nGiven your problem you might offer to sell a brand new in-the-box phone and once you had a buyer, use your AT&T subsidy to offset the cost of a new unlocked iPhone for your wife. It all depends how valuable your time is and how hot your local market is for current AT&T phones. I would feel a lot more comfortable buying a phone when I could come to the store with you and see the new phone being bought. You could be sure the buyer had the cash in hand and everyone should end up happy.\n", "Q: How do I use tmutil to figure out what's wrong with my Time Machine? How do I use tmutil to figure out what is wrong with my Time Machine as it keeps backing up huge amounts of data each time it back-ups although nothing has changed since the last back up?\nI'm backing-up to a Drobo FS\n\nA: You can use timedog to see what's being backed up each time. \nUsage:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities)\n\n*cd /Volumes/Time\\ Machine/Backups.backupdb/[Computer Name]\nNote Time Machine may be different on your system.\nReplace [Computer Name] with the name of your computer (see System Preferences => Sharing).\n\n*/path/to/timedog -d 5 -l\nFor instance, if you unzipped timedog to your Desktop, the path would be ~/Desktop/timedog\nAnd then look at the output\n\nA: Use\ntmutil listbackups\n\nto get a list of existing (completed) backups.\nThen run one or both of\ntmutil compare # to compare current drive to latest backup\ntmutil compare /one/path/from/list /other/path/from/list # compare two backups\n\n", "Q: Can you preview a song in iTunes Match before upgrading your local copy? I'm a bit pedantic over my library, in many ways. Clean album art, quality standards, tagging standards, etc. iTunes Match is a boon in many ways, but one problem concerns me.\nI'm not entirely sold on the concept of acoustical audio matching, and I know my file tags occasionally differ enough that some parsers can't match based off song information alone.\nThat said, I've followed Jason Snell's instructions for a Match upgradable Smart Playlist, and I'm at the step where I'm about to delete all the files from my machine locally.\nBut I'm terribly concerned that I may lose a file due to incorrect identification, tagging, or some other issue that I haven't even considered yet.\nIs it possible to preview the iTunes Match supplied version before I delete my local copy?\n\nA: If you move all your songs that you are about to delete to a different directory, iTunes should no longer be able to find them, and you should be able to hear the matched version and inspect its encoding. If you regret it, it should just be to move the songs back to where they were.\nHaven't tried it myself to test it with one or two songs first!\n\nA: You can delete the reference to the local file in iTunes by deleting and selecting \"Keep File\"; then streaming or downloading the song from iCloud won't touch your original file.\n", "Q: How to connect to a FTP server from a Wi-Fi Hotspot that prevents direct FTP connections? I am using the wifi at a library where they prevent me to connect to FTP servers for some reason.

When I turn off Send Read Receipts in iMessage, does that disable me from receiving read receipts from others as well? I have noticed that I only receive read receipts when I have the feature turned on. \n\nA: The functionality is for messages to get delivered via SMS if that is enabled and iMessage is disabled or not available for the sender.\niMessage should / is designed to receive messages whether or not you are sending back read receipts as long as you and the recipient are on devices that match in Apple's database of recipients that are iMessage capable.\nSomething else is up - it could be related to the switch (as software corruption can act in weird ways) but it's certainly not the typical behavior.\n\nA: Read receipts come to you whether or not you have the feature enabled. It shows up under the message you last sent in place of the word \"Delivered\" and it just says \"Read\" ...after a period of time it tacks on the time it was read too.\n\nA: ok, Ian did pretty good, but I think he could have been a bit more clear with it.\nRead Receipts tell the person who sent YOU a message, if you read their message or not. If YOU are SENDING a message, it does NOT matter if YOUR read receipt option is on or off. If the person you sent the message TO have read receipts ON, then directly under the message you sent, if will tell you if they read your message or not. If the person you sent the message to has the option turned OFF, then you will not know if they read your message or not.\nSo if you turn off read receipts, then people who sent you messages will not know if you read them yet. That's all it does.\n", "Q: How do I use chmod on a Mac to make new files inherit parent directory permissions? On MacOS. I want to make it so that any new files/folders that get created within a specific folder have the same permissions (not group, that's already taken care of) as those of the parent directory.\nOn Linux, I would normally use setfacl, but it looks like chmod on MacOS might be able to do what I'm looking for. I've read through the man page for chmod but I still can't figure out how to properly format the command to get what I want.\n\nA: Try adding -R to @gordon's command, like so:\nchmod -R +a \"group:_www allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\" outdoors\n\nThe -R option will (as noted here):\n\nRecurse: Change the mode of file hierarchies rooted in the files\n  instead of just the files themselves.\n\nChanging the file hierarchies seems to be what you're looking for (for new files, directories, etc.).\nYou can also check out this Apple.SE post, which covers a situation somewhat similar to yours (except relating to a shared directory), which required a sudo tacked onto the front.\n\nA: This (-R) is not what most people seek to do; most of the time they would prefer to change the ACL on the topmost directory and do something magical to force all contained objects to inherit flags according to the ACL they specified on the root of that sub-tree. This is much more elegant as the ACLs on the objects will sort these inherited ACEs according to policy.\nAnd yes, I had to write a python script to do this, I didn't find anything appropriate either.\n\nA: First, a bit of background to explain what's going on: Files in OS X can have two quite different kinds of permission settings applied to them: POSIX and ACLs.\nFiles always (well, almost always) have POSIX permissions applied, consisting of an owner, group, and others (with some combination of read, write, and execute for each of those).  There is no way to control inheritance of POSIX permissions: new items are always owned by whatever user created them, the group assignment is inherited from the folder they're in, and the access is determined by the umask (which is pretty much always: owner gets full access, group and others read only + execute for folders).  So POSIX permissions won't work for what you're trying to do.\nFiles can also have an access control list (ACL) applied.  This is a list of access control entries (ACEs), each of which applies to a user or group, specifies types of access (in great detail), whether they're being allowed or denied, and whether the ACE should also be copied to items created inside the folder.  That last bit is the part that makes this useful for you; you need to create an ACE on the folder that specifies the group you want, the types of access you want, and full inheritance.\nchmod on OS X can manipulate ACEs with the +a, -a, etc permissions options.  If I understand what you want, you'd use this (with your group name and folder path substituted) to create the ACE:\nchmod +a \"group:examplegroup allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\" /path/to/folder\n\nNote: the inheritance is not \"live\", i.e:\n\n*\n\n*it doesn't apply to items created before you assigned the ACE\n\n*it doesn't apply to items created somewhere else and then moved into the folder.\n\nYou can apply it to existing contents by using -R (i.e: chmod -R +a ...).  I don't know of a way (except Apple's server admin tools) to force inheritance to items moved into the folder.\n\nA: On a Mac try using PathFinder, it makes it easy to set ACL and POSIX. If you're hosting WordPress on a Mac Server you'll also need to set define('FS_METHOD', 'direct'); in the wp-config.php so that installing plugins and upgrading won't ask you for FTP details.\nSo basically you keep the default POSIX permissions, and add the user _www (not group) to ACL, then click Propagate Permission in the ACL window.\n\nA: chmod +ai, i = inherit acl rules\n", "Q: Send background email alert if Time Machine backup fails Curious if there is an easy way to send a background email alert if a Time Machine backup fails (or continuously fails rather than just one time)\nI've found TM Error Logger however, it cannot run in the background, and also generates the email through the systems default mail client, which then needs to be manually sent.\nIdeally I'd like a solution that does this in the background without any input or action from the end user - so that I can be notified if their machines aren't backing up.\nThe trouble is many users don't realize that Time Machine may not be working for them - they don't know to look for the \"!\" in the TM menu bar icon (or often what it means)\n\nA: This is a great use case for a simple shell or python or ruby script and launchd.\nI'll assume you can find on this site how to configure the launchd item or want to buy Lingon which is a great timesaver. (Be aware Lingon 3 is for Lion and there is another also paid version for Snow Leopard just named Lingon on the App store)\nYou also will need to set up an internal mail server that accepts command line mail from all your clients, so there is that large chunk of setup.\nWith all that \"hand waving\" to explain broad concepts - you now could use these core commands to get the job done:\n\n*\n\n*tmutil startbackup --block\n\n*date \"+%Y-%m-%d\"\n\n*mail -s \"TimeMachine Failure Report from $HOSTNAME\" \"This mac needs attention\"\nDepending on how much fun this sounds, you can pick apart each task and work on them or look into software that is designed to do this for you like Apple Remote Desktop or Robot Cloud.\n\nA: I recently released a Mac app called TMNotifier that will run in the background and notify you when a Time Machine error occurs.

That gives you a valid iTunes URL, that if opened in a browser (that doesn't auto-open iTunes), appears to be the same as if the link were a US link.\nHowever when any iTunes link is opened in iTunes itself, it will attempt to redirect to the version in the user's local store. I.e. when I click on the link you posted, I get sent to the same item in the Canadian store.\nIf the item isn't available in the Canadian store, I get a message like this:\n\nSo, you should be safe using country-specific store links, and iTunes will handle the redirection as appropriate.\n\nA: A \"generic\" or \"global\" iTunes / App Store link has less to do with the two letter country code in the URL and everything to do with ID.  \nIf the link is recognized / available in the \"target\" iTunes / App Store country specific storefront you are golden, if not you just served up an error message. \nFor example (look at the IDs in each link): \nApps (Tetris from EA):\n\n\n*\n\n*US - http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tetris/id479943969?mt=8\n\n*UK - http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tetris/id480807857?mt=8\nMusic (Adele's 21):\n\n\n*\n\n*US - https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/21/id420075073\n\n*UK - https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/21/id405293187\n\n*CA - https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/21/id403988688\n\n*JP - https://itunes.apple.com/jp/album/21/id413208801\n\n*BR - https://itunes.apple.com/br/album/21/id477022345\nWe (GeoRiot) have found that \"artist\" links (either for a musician/band or app developer) are your best bet for an ID that works internationally but still don't have 100% success.  \nFor specific products, we've found the following rates of links not working for international clicks (based on top 300 items in each category, originate from a US based iTunes / App Store link and tested in the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan storefronts): \n\n\n*\n\n*8% to 12% of the time for Apps \n\n*65% to 75% for Music \n\n*50% to 75% for Books (native language plays in here)\n\n*60% to 85% for TV shows / episodes (again language is a major factor)\n\n*50% to 98% for Movies (language again playing in big here)\n\n\nIf you really want to dive into the specific availability of a link then you can check out this tool we put together: GeoRiot Link Availability Tool (beta)\nI hope that helps! \n\nA: sorry for being so late, I recently needed the solution as well.

There seems to be a lot of information about iTunes Match, but I couldn't find any that describes exactly how the algorithm works. Is it something as simple as comparing song names/artists, or is some kind of checksum done? \nI'm asking since I've got some music which isn't even properly tagged (titles/artists mismatched) and since iTunes Match is not yet available in Poland I can't really test how it would be behave with such files. So is it something really complicated and nicely done which involves music analysis or something as trivial as checking song names? Does anyone have detailed information on it? \n\nA: I already answered a related question. I may not know the most definite answer, But I read that iTunes Match uses Gracenote's MusicID program. It seems MusicID uses the following techniques to identify songs.\nMusicID-featured Identification Technologies:\nCD Identification: Using the CD’s unique Table of Content (TOC), MusicID can identify CDs released around the world. Even with multiple pressings and release dates, patented fuzzy matching enables accurate recognition.\nStream Identification: Using an audio waveform fingerprint technology, MusicID can identify music with short audio samples anywhere in the song.\nDigital File Identification: MusicID can identify individual songs or albums in a user’s collection regardless of source, format, or tag information. Utilizing a multi-step process which combines stream identification with textual information analysis from the file’s embedded tags, file name, directory path, and other related files in the user’s collection, individual or groups of songs can be matched to albums.\nMore here. \nTo answer your question, they perform some fuzzy text matching algorithm to map meta data and also perform audio waveform analysis. \n", "Q: Lion not responding to mouse clicks over VNC Under Snow Leopard, I had no problems with VNC connections from my Windows 7 64-bit PC to my Mac mini.

Any help is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: This is a very popular issue.

Throughout my library I'm seeing cases where some songs from a given album that I've imported from CD are matched by iTunes Match, while others — on the same album — are not recognized and are instead uploaded (at a lower bitrate):\n\nWhat accounts for this difference in treatment of tracks from the same album? Is there anything I can do to acquire the high bitrate tracks?\n\nA: It's been confirmed elsewhere that metadata alone will not give success in matching (if it were, someone would quickly find a way to just create thousands of dummy files with the right metadata). Some audio fingerprinting is going on, and you can test it by changing the metadata of one track to that of another one, and see if if matches the audio or the metadata. Still, metadata plays a role as well.\nMacWorld have a note on the problem of one or a few songs not matching from an album:  Basically, it seem to affect specific songs (rather than just randomly failing every n:th song). Two possible reasons for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*The audio or metadata specific to that track confuses the matching algorithm (as we know, audio fingerprinting is not an exact science)\n\n*There is a rights issue with particular tracks that Apple haven't been able to find agreement for.\n\n\nA: I think the problem stems from the fact that the album metadata with Itunes is different to the ones that are in your CD.\nYou can browse that particular album in Itunes store and change the metadata in your local library to match the ones in the store. This way the matching program will find all the songs.\nEdit: The album's Metadata may not be the only dimensions used while performing the matching, but I am sure that, it is among the more dominant dimensions. Itunes match supposedly uses Gracenote's MusicID and it seems to use multiple identification techniques.

I use the Right Option key as my Compose key. I already have a Left Option key so the right one is a bit useless to me. And it somehow matches the position of the Compose key on old Sun keyboards.\nThat would be Right Option on a Mac keyboard. I recommend that.\nStep 2: remap the Compose key\nThe problem is that the Mac OS X keyboard preferences:\n\n*\n\n*do not let you differentiate between Left Option and Right Option keys\n\n*only let you remap modifier keys to another modifier key (or to nothing)\n\nFortunately, there is KeyRemap4MacBook that lets you do very low level things with your keyboard. Install it.\nWe will now remap our compose key to something that the next layer will understand. I chose Shift Control F13 for that. It is very unlikely you will need that key combination.\nIn the file ~/Library/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook/private.xml put the following:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>Send Shift-Ctrl-F13 for Right Option</name>\n    <identifier>private.send_shift_ctrl_f13_for_ropt</identifier>\n    <autogen>--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::OPTION_R,\n                          KeyCode::F13, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L\n                                      | ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L\n    </autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\nFinally, from the System Preferences, open the KeyRemap4MacBook settings and click on the ReloadXML button. Then activate the new option.\nStep 3: create compose bindings\nThe last step is the creation of the actual bindings. I chose to import the rules from /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose on my Debian system.\nBob Kåres wrote a script that lets you convert X11 compose rules into Cocoa key bindings.\nEither convert a Compose file of your own using Bob’s script, or download my DefaultKeyBinding.dict from the article. Save it in ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict.\nBe careful: by default Bob’s script uses F13 instead of Shift Ctrl F13 so in DefaultKeyBinding.dict you need to change:\n\"\\UF710\"\n\ninto:\n\"^$\\UF710\"\n\nIf for some reason you decided to go for another combination, check out this article by Xah Lee to find out the proper syntax.\n\nA: Compose key on dedicated keyboard layout\nI have written U.S. custom, a keyboard layout that implements the compose key.\nOn Mac OS X, there are two ways of implementing the compose key: Either with  can be implemented either with the Cocoa text system (as already described in Sam Hocevar's most helpful answer) or with a dedicated keyboard layout. Both methods have their pros and cons:\n\n\n*\n\n*A compose key implementation with the Cocoa text system will work independently of the chosen keyboard layout. The Cocoa text system settings in the DefaultKeyBinding.dict file are, by comparison, easily modified.\n\n*A compose key implementation with a keyboard layout will work all over the OS in any application, not just in Cocoa applications. It can be switched on and off with the UI by selecting another keyboard layout. There is a visual feedback while typing the compose combination (which slightly changes the behaviour).\n\n\nThe installation of the keyboard layout is easy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and open uscustom.2012-08-28.zip.\n\n*Move the files UScustom.keylayout and UScustom.icns to either of:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/Keyboard Layouts/ (for all users)\n\n*~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/ (just for you, no administrator privileges required)\n\n\n*Activate the U.S. custom keyboard layout in the Input Sources tab of the Language & Text Preference Pane, so you can then select it from the input sources menu bar item – its icon shows a U.S. flag with a little C for “custom” or for “compose”: .\n\n\nThe compose key of the U.S. custom keyboard layout is mapped to two different keys:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a compose key at ISO § (that is the surplus key of an ISO keyboard; ISO keyboards are the ones where the return key is shaped like a turned capital letter L).\n\n*There is another compose key at Shift+Control+F13. This is the same mapping as chosen by Sam Hocevar, so if you want to remap the compose key to you right option key, then you can exactly follow the careful explanations described in his answer.\n\n\nAssigning compose to capslock\nIf you want to assign compose to the capslock key (as in the original question), you need Takayama Fumihiko’s PCKeyboardHack in addition to KeyRemap4MacBook:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install PCKeyboardHack.\n\n*Open the PCKeyboardHack preference pane.\n\n*Check the Change Caps Lock checkbox.\n\n*Doubleclick on the keycode of Change Caps Lock and enter 10 (ISO §).\n\n\nThis works with the U.S. custom keyboard layout compose key. In order to assign the Cocoa text system compose key (as carefully described by Sam Hocevar) to capslock, then you need another step:\nWith KeyRemap4MacBook, remap the ISO § to Shift+Control+F13 (or whereever your compose key is). To do so, follow the steps carefully explained by Sam Hocevar, but changing the code that is to be placed in ~/Library/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook/private.xml thisly:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n<item>\n  <name>Send Shift-Ctrl-F13 for ISO Section</name>\n  <identifier>private.send_shift_ctrl_f13_for_iso_section</identifier>\n  <autogen>\n    --KeyToKey--\n    KeyCode::UK_SECTION, ModifierFlag::NONE,\n    KeyCode::F13, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L\n  </autogen>\n</item>\n</root>\n\n\nA: A \"dead keys\" feature similar to what you want already exists by default. To get the letter é, press Option ⌥+e, then e. \nAfter pressing ⌥+e, you'll see a ´ character highlighted (it's yellow on my computer). Press any letter that will take that accent mark (this will vary based on your keyboard language, for EN-US it's é, ú, í, ó, and á) and you'll get the accented version of the letter. There are other accents possible: ⌥+` gives an agrave accent (```), ⌥+e gives an acute accent (´), ⌥+u gives a diaeresis/umlaut (¨), ⌥+i gives a circumflex accent (ˆ), and ⌥+n gives a tilde (˜). Non-US keyboard layouts (in particular Welsh) have more accents and allow more letters for the same accents. The Keyboard Viewer is useful to help figure out what combinations are currently supported on your layout.\nIf you are on Lion, as @djacobson mentioned, you can hold down some letters to see a variety of accented options for that letter. \n\nA: If you want to remap one of your keys, take a look at KeyRemap4MacBook, which is referenced in this SU post. The documentation notes that Caps Lock can be remapped, and custom mappings are also supported.\n", "Q: How can I use more than one connected drive for Network Time Machine backups on Lion Server? In Leopard Server, via Server Admin, you were able to enable multiple partitions to be Time Machine Backup Destinations. In Lion Server, there seems to only be an option to have one Time Machine Backup location.\n\n\nHow can I select more than one Time Machine Backup Volume to share in Lion Server (like I used to be able to do in Leopard Server).\nAlternatively - is there a way I can pool these partitions together (across about 4 disks) so that I can support up to 4TB of backup space for our workplace? Under Leopard we just shared 4 1TB external drives.\nI've also seen this problem mentioned here, with no resolution.\n\nA: My headhurts from fixing this.\nI found this discussion thread which allowed me to enable Time Machine Sharing for more than one volume. It's not as tricky as it sounds, but you do need to go step by step. \nThe only things I had to do that weren't in this discussion thread were:\n\n\n*\n\n*I had to log in as root. Root was disabled in my server, so I had to enable it.\n\n*I couldn't be bothered downloading xCode, so I used pListEditPro to edit the pLists.\n\n*If you use Server.app's Time Machine service as suggested by the discussion it renames the Time Machine Share to \"Backups\" which is annoying if you're upgrading from a previous set up.  \n\n\n\nI have figured out a way to enable multiple backup targets.\n  However, it's one of these things I wouldn't want to describe to anyone except true programmer types, because everyone else has a 90%+ chance of messing up their system if they do something wrong.\n   It involves turning off file sharing, and then editing the plist files in /private/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/sharepoints/\nThe gist of it is this:\na) first create all the share points you later want to use for TimeMachine, and set them up for afp-only file sharing, also create one TM target, which you can either use later, or have there so the system has one entry it knows how to handle. I just made a bogus one that I'm not actively using.\nb) turn off file sharing in Server.app\nc) turn off TimeMachine in Server.app\nd) now you can edit the files, the easiest is with Xcode, so you may want to install that first\ne) for each sharpoint you made in a) there will be a corresponding .plist file in the location indicated, these are the files that need to be edited.\nf) for each of these files\n       1) the item0 string property in the timeMachineBackup array must be switched from 0 to 1\n       2) a new key of type array with the name timeMachineBackupUUID must be created\n       3) in the newly created array an item of type string must be placed with the value of a UUID, which can be created with the shell command uuidgen\ng) make sure all the edited plist files are saved\nh) turn on TimeMachine in the Server.app again\n\nBig thanks to Ronald C.F. Antony who found this fix on Apple's Discussions. \n", "Q: How can I merge two similar-but-not identical folders? I have a folder (which is filled with many many sub-folders and files) which is on a FireWire drive [source] which I am trying to move to a USB drive [destination].\nI am trying to move all of the files from the Source to the Destination.\nI started doing this via Finder, but it gave me a permissions error about 1/8th of the way through the process and then stopped. \nWhen moving files between drives, I believe the Finder first does a 'copy' and then removes the 'source' only when the copy command has completed successfully.\nThat means that some files were copied successfully, but I have no idea which ones or how many. So I started copying sub-folders from Source to Destination (smaller sets) and removed them from Source when they successfully copied.\nI ended up not being able to complete that process in one sitting, and I lost my \"place\" \nSo now I'm left with two incomplete data sets. The Source probably has some files/folders which are already on the Destination, but not everything has been copied.\nSome of the folders may have been partially copied but not all of their subfolders, etc.\nI'm trying to figure out the best way to move the rest of Source to Destination while minimizing duplication. We're talking about a lot of data here (Source is 420.72 GB in 398,127 items, and Destination is 298.84 GB and 390,149 items) so I'm obviously going to have to try to automate this somehow. I'm just not sure how.\nI've thought about gcp [GNU cp] with --update --archive or ditto or rsync or ChronoSync but I'm just not sure what the best option is and what settings I should use for whichever program would be recommended (do I want --archive with gcp? What flags would I use with ditto or rsync?)\n\nA: You can open Terminal and use one of the following (rsync would probably be the one for you if you want something that won't be completely lost if you halt the process):\nThe standard UNIX way\ncp -R -v source/. destination\n\nThe geeky UNIX way (restartable)\nrsync -vaEW source/ destination\n\nThe OSX \"easy\" way\nditto -V source destination\n\nSource\n\nA: If you use FileMerge from the Developer Tools on the two directory trees, you will be able to see which individual files have copied as it will do a diff between them and show the differences.\nOtherwise rsync might be a bit more automated as mentioned above by cksum.\n", "Q: Why does the OS X Software Update check take so long? Why does it take so long for Software Update in OS X to tell me that I'm up to date? I'm currently running 10.7.2, but this has been the case for all versions of OS X I've run. I just performed a check, and it took three minutes to return.\nI can't think of any reason why it should take so long. Isn't it a fairly quick lookup of applications and versions?\nBy contrast, the same function in the iOS/iTunes Store and Mac App Store takes almost no time.\n\nA: Mac OS X keeps a list of all installed packages in /var/log/receipts.\nWhen software update is run it checks for updates for every (or perhaps only Apple) package individually by sending a HTTP request with a signature of the package to Apple's servers and waiting for a reply. This is necessary because of the wide variety of configurations possible for any system.\nOn my Snow Leopard system running software update sent ~322 HTTP requests to Apple's servers.\nSo basically it is just looking up if there are any updates, but because of the sheer number of separate and sometimes optional (Java, X11, printer drivers, etc.) packages, combined with the fact that it's sending each request separately, it can take awhile.\n\nA: I have never experienced this issue, because I never manually do a \"Software Update\". Lion tells me, with a pop-up of \"Software Update\", whenever an update is ready for me. And then check after the update takes just about one minute.\nThis is a huge improvement from their side.\n", "Q: How to create a simple keyboard macro with Automator? How can I use the built in tool, Automator (rather than a 3rd party app), to create a simple keyboard macro?\nFor example, I want it to press Cmd-Shift Left, then Cmd-U, then Right, etc.\nI tried using the record feature to create this macro, but ran into several problems.\nThe first is that it's copying my mouse events after I press record and as I go into the application I want to run the macro on. For example, in this case I want to run it in Chrome. I ended up deleting the first few steps which involved launching chrome. The reason I deleted them is because I don't want it to be limited to a specific application, and I think that it just adds to the complexity if it tries activating an application. I want it to stick with running keyboard commands only.\nThe second problem is that I'm not sure how to initiate the keyboard macro. Do I save the recorded file? Where to? How do I invoke the macro once I am in Chrome? Is there a way to assign a keyboard shortcut to it?\n\nA: If you don't want to use any third party apps you are really complicating your life. Although I think it's possible.\n1) Open Automator and create a new Service. In your workflow you want to Run Applescript. In there you tell it to press the keys you want.\n\nOnce you save it as a Service you can then set up a keyboard shortcut for it in System Preferences. It should automatically show up under the General group. Make sure it's enabled and give it a keyboard shortcut.\n\nI have gotten this to work by testing the Show history function Cmd-Y. Hopefully the above isn't too cryptic.\nIf you want to set global shortcuts and run scripts you might want to look at BetterTouchTool: http://blog.boastr.net/\n", "Q: ITunes Match: syncing smart playlists that reference other playlists ITunes tells me I cannot sync a smart playlist that references another playlist, but combining playlists is how I like to shuffle my music. I especially like creating individual playlists with \"last played is not in the last\" and \"limit to\" and then combining them. Do I need more cleverly designed rules, or is IMatch not for me? Advice?\n\nI have certainly been disappointed that smart playlists won't live update on the Iphone, but at least I could still combine playlists into \"superplaylists.\"\nImatch won't allow this, and by that I mean, these superplaylists sync to the Iphone through a direct sync (with IMatch turned off), but as soon as I turn Imatch on again, they disappear.\n\nA: I think the best option you have is to recreate your super playlists as a single more complex playlist.\nWhen you are editing a smart playlist you can option click the '+' button (turns into '...' while you are holding option) and this creates a subgroup that can a condition of it's own.  \nThis playlist picks music based on rating and last played choosing higher rated tracks more often:\n\nOne technique I used in some playlists was to put NSFW tracks in a playlist and then build other playlists to exclude NSFW tracks.  Putting tracks in a playlist is an easy way to add additional information about them without having to edit the ID3 tags.  That doesn't work with these more complex smart playlists.\nYou will have to put additional information like that into the ID3 fields.  You can use the comments block for this, but I don't like to do that because I like to be able to add this kind of flag to multiple tracks at once and I can't do that as I may be losing comments already entered. Genre works if you're willing to use that instead.  Any field will work; as I don't have tracks that use grouping I used that for my own NSFW tags.   \nOne slightly more complex place to put these kinds of tags is the 'Category' field.  iTunes keeps a category field but doesn't show that field in the editing UI so it's normally not used for anything.  Doug's Applescripts offers a script that will let you edit this field. (script and instructions)\n\nA: Weird, but I have found a way to nest smartplaylists. If you try to add the other playlist as a criteria pressing the +, the list won't sync with iTunes Match. BUT if you just add the criteria pressing the \"...\" button it will (!) \n\nA: I don't think this is possible at all. So when you're trying to combine normal playlists into \"super playlists\", you are out of luck. Note that, those playlists would still work, just not get synces via iTunes Match.\nHowever, if you only try to combine smart playlists, you can always build more refined rules. Just add the the original rules to the newly created playlist. A somewhat hidden feature is that you can nest conditions to get more complex rules by holding the alt/option key clicking the + button.\n\nA: It's more fundimental, from what I can tell.  For some reason, there are certain tags (meta-data) associated with an iTunes track that DO sync, and some that DO NOT.  To illustrate the scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*I tag 11 songs with grouping XXX.  \n\n*I create a smart playlist with grouping XXX as the criteria.  The list on the mac populates as expected.  The list is created on the IOS device, but it's empty.\n\n*I add a tag of YYY to the artist field on the same tracks\n\n*I modify the smartlist filter to include the artist criteria of YYY. The list on the mac populates as expected.  The list is persisted on the IOS device, but it's still empty. \n\n*I remove the grouping criteria from my smartlist filter, leaving only the artist criteria of YYY.  Suddenly, the list on the IOS device is populated as expected.\n\n\nIt took me about an hour with Apple Support to explain this bug, and in the end they agreed it was a bug.  Any criteria that populates a smartlist should populate the IOS device through iTunes match.\n", "Q: Simple image manipulation application I apologize in advance if this question does not belong, but .. what software do you use for simple image manipulation on your mac?\nTasks I am looking for to do, are no more complicated then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-size existing image to certain, specific size\n\n*Create image with a certain size\n\n\nI am working on an iOS application and have found out that instead of worrying about how to re-size images, scale them etc .. i should just get images of the size i need (doh!)\nI am not looking for things like Photoshop, rather something much simpler (and free if possible)\nThank you for your time.\n\nA: Pixelmator is a great image editor for OS X if you don't need all the bells and whistles of Photoshop. It's only $30USD, an order of magnitude cheaper than PS, and has a free trial.\nI think this is the best choice for beginners or those with more lightweight needs. Because it's Mac only, it integrates with the core technologies of the OS better than even Photoshop does, so it's a very natural learning curve for an OS X user.\nHowever, if you need something totally free, you can also check out the open source GIMP project, but this is starting to approach the complexity and power of something like Photoshop.\n", "Q: Routing all web 'traffic' via tun device on Mac OSX Having checked through Stack Overflow I cannot find a suitable answer, so hope the community are able to help me.\nI am using a DNS tunneling program called iodine, on the Mac as a client device and am currently able to connect to the server correctly, create the tun0 device and ping the server as defined, via the tunnel.\nI am now trying to route my normal browsing traffic via this 'virtual' tun0 device but am failing to do so.

My home machine, where the bulk of my music library lives, is currently syncing itself up to iTunes Match. It's a big library and a long process, and the upstream on my cable modem is tragically slow, so it's taking it a couple days to fully do. I can see on my iPhone and my iPad the status of that, and can pull my music down to my devices from the cloud, and so far it's pretty great.\nMy Mac at work has a smaller subset of my full library on it (pulled out of my iPhone with Senuti). What I want is for it to share and download from my iTunes Match account, like my iOS devices do. When I turn on iTunes Match on my work computer, it does its \"gathering information\" step, and then when it goes to \"match your music\", it tells me another computer is syncing (which it is) and it can't do two at once.\nSo does that imply that when my home machine finally gets done (probably today), I can do the same process on my work machine, and the two accounts and libraries will be synched up with the cloud?\n\nA: Yes, you can add the second Mac once the first has completed.

When I transfer audiobooks to my phone using Overdrive they show up in the book section but are unable to play.  I have to designate each file as Music to be able to play them, but then I am not able to listen to them in chapter format, nor am I able to play in double speed or use the 30 second fast forward button.  I spend more time listening to books on my phone than anything else so this is a major digression in capability.\nIs there a fix to this?\n\nA: I had a similar issue with the default music app and the Steve Jobs biography audiobook (ironically).\nI had to manually delete the audiobook from my device by checking the box for Manually manage music and videos in iTunes, then delete the files, then re-add them again.\nHave a look at the audiobook entries under your device in iTunes - mine had a sync icon next to them as if to indicate that the problem was getting them onto the device, rather than with the player itself.\nI haven't yet tried to uncheck the box for Manually manage music and videos for fear of breaking the audiobook again.\n", "Q: iPhone Music app is displaying a disabled podcast episode After syncing my iPhone with iTunes, I now somehow have a \"disabled\" podcast episode:\n\n\n*\n\n*All of the text is grey and there's no artwork\n\n*I can't play the episode even though it displays \"19m left\"\n\n*I can't delete the episode (swiping to delete does nothing)\n\n\nHow and why did this happen?

Try removing ONE single ipod episode (any episode is good) and sync the iPhone.\nIt should now sync everything but that one episode. You can put it back and sync it again and you're good to go.\n\nA: I ended up fixing it without having to sync anything - I simply went to the iTunes Store on my phone and downloaded the disabled episode. Once it was done, I still couldn't play it, but I could delete it. I did so and now it's gone.\nI still don't know what exactly caused this to happen in the first place though.\n", "Q: Updating iTunes Match metadata/tags? I recently turned Match on in iTunes, and it did its thing and matched/uploaded songs. I then turned it on in my iPhone and to my horror, the tags that I thought I had meticulously organized weren't quite so perfect... mostly due to the \"Album Artist\" tag.\nFor example, the artist list in my iPhone now displays both “Smashing Pumpkins” and “The Smashing Pumpkins”.  I went back to iTunes, corrected all the issues I could find, and hit “Update iTunes Match”, thinking this would send in my corrected tags.  \nOnce it finished, I checked my phone to find that nothing had changed.  I then checked back in iTunes to find that it had actually uncorrected the tags I just fixed. They're now back to the way they were when I sent them into Match.  \nIs there a way to get Match to recognize changes to ID3 tags, or am I forever stuck with what I've got?\n\nA: I had a similar issue, it seems as once the song is uploaded to iCloud via iTunes match it becomes the \"Master\" copy.  Install iTunes 10.5.1 or later on another PC and connect it to iTunes Match but DO NOT download anything!  Then you can delete songs from iCloud, don't worry this won't delete them from your main iTunes library. Once deleted go back to your main iTunes machine and change the metadata, then choose add to iCloud for the song. The new metadata will now be ULd to iCloud.\n\nA: I've had success with a slighly different approach which (as a plus) doesn't require re-adding all your tracks.\nFirst, I turned off iTunes Match on my iMac (desktop) where my library resides.  Then, I cleaned up all my metadata.\nNext, I went to my Macbook Air (laptop), opened iTunes, went into iTunes Match, and deleted everything.  As earlier posts have pointed out, despite the warnings iTunes gives you, this does not have the effect of deleting anything out of your local iTunes library (on my iMac, in my case).\nGo back into iTunes on my desktop, and turn on iTunes Match.  This starts the standard 3 step process, which finishes pretty quickly (in my case - my library is ~8k songs).\nWhen it's done, all my tracks have been re-associated w/ iTunes Match, and have taken the new metadata assigned to them.  Confirmed by going back to my laptop, quitting out of iTunes and re-launching, and waiting for iTunes Match to sync.  After sync, my library appears, and contains the updated metadata.\nWould be interested to know if this works for anybody else!\n", "Q: Replace German keyboard of Macbook Pro MC700 I have a German Macbook Pro, but I dont really like the keyboard layout, I would like to replace about 15 keys to make it easier for typing.

I set the equalizer to what sounded best, but it still sounds awful. Sort of muffled and plain. What did iTunes or the iPod do to my songs that made them this way and how can I fix it?\n\nA: Well, there are actually a number of different things that COULD be wrong. For example, the Auxiliary (or AUX) cord could have been frayed on the inside, or someone might have chipped a bit of their own cord inside which you just didn't notice, or something else had your attention. You might not have pushed the cord in all the way, at the same time, some systems work better with the cord NOT pushed in all the way, in which case I suggest GENTLY and SLOWLY loosening the cord from the hole to see if the sound gets better. \nThe new nano might have come with a (thankfully rare) defect, so you can try taking it to a Genius bar, or if you call Apple about it, depending on the severity of the problem (and if they have nothing to do and are bored) they might charge you, and send you a new iPod in the mail, and wait for you to send yours back to them in the box, pending this return before they give back the money they charged as security (to make sure you didn't try to rob them). Now, if all of the above fail, there are 2 things that could be the problem. One problem could be that your car doesn't support the iOS on the new iPod, or the car just wasn't made for adapting to new iPod versions.\n", "Q: How to prefix an area code when dialing with iPhone? I just moved to Idaho, and here everyone has the same area code (208 for the whole state). Unfortunately I still have my old phone number. So when someone texts or emails me a phone number they never include the area code. When I try to dial it with my iPhone I get an error from AT&T that I need to first dial the area code. \nIf I type the area code, and then try to paste the number in that will replace the area code. I am not able to get a edit point anywhere by the end of the phone number in the keypad screen. The only options I have found is to paste the phone number in notepad or somewhere that allows editing, add the area code, then copy and paste that into the keypad. Either that or cache the phone number outside the phone and then re-enter it manually.\nIs there some way to tell the iPhone to assume 208 is the area code when none is provided, or at least a way to edit a phone number from the keypad to add an area code? \n(I realize there is probably an app for that, but it seems like a pretty common thing that should be supported by the iPhone without an extra app step.)\n\nA: It may not be a perfect solution, but what I do is store all numbers in my contacts with 1 and the area code. That way it dials appropriately no matter where I am (it doesn't change the billing details - a local call is still a local call, whether it includes the area code or not).\nAlso, maybe this is a carrier specific thing, but any texts I receive from numbers not in my contacts show up with the full +1(123)456-7890 formatting.\n\nA: An app called Launcher allows to dial from a notepad, which is editable.\nThat function was already included in the PalmPilot based phones. On that point the iPhone is inferior.\n\nA: I had this problem. Out of nowhere, my Verizon iPhone stopped being able to dial 7 digit numbers. I too live in small area where 7 digit numbers are common.\nI searched but no answers. I turned off my phone and no fix.\nThen, I restarted my phone by holding the power and home button together for 20 seconds until the Apple logo is shown, and it went back to normal! I knew it was something simple.\n\nA: I don't see how you could do it either. Maybe you could use an app on your PC to modify the address book for all numbers without an area code and that is in Idaho? Then sync this to the iPhone… Have you contacted AT&T to see if there is something they can do?\n", "Q: Transform ordering of photos in iPhoto to files I use iPhoto to organize my photos, especially to order them. If I copy a whole album, for example the last holiday trip, to an usb stick, all images are transfered, but not in the order I created in iPhoto (obviously ^^). Is there a way to automatically rename the files so they match the ordering I created in iPhoto?\n\nA: Easy.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select all photos in your manually sorted album (e.g. using cmdA)\n\n*Choose File–Export... from the menu (or hit ⇧cmdE)\n\n*Select \"Sequential\" for File name, and enter a base name (which will be followed by numbers) \n\n*In the next dialog, choose the target folder (e.g. directly on your USB drive). Your photos will be exported there, and sorting them by file name will result in your beloved custom sort order from iPhoto!\n\n\nIn step 3, you might also want to select other options such as picture size and file format – this comes in handy if you don't need the full-resolution versions to be exported.\n", "Q: Paralells Desktop changes default Application to play .mp4 files Even though I have selected the option \"Always Open with\" Quicktime Player for my .mp4 files.

Greasemonkey is explained in this Wikipedia entry.\nI would like to add my own stylesheet to a particularly non-mobile-friendly website. Is there any way to accomplish this? Are there any browser apps that can do it?\n\nA: You can use userscripts on iOS Safari using the new Shortcuts utility (though it seems to be complicated) and a lot easier using the free Safari Snippets app. However, this approach does not load userscripts automatically, they have to be manually loaded on each page load.\nThere seem to be at least two third-party browsers which support userscripts, the Gear Browser and the Alook Browser. I don't have experience with Gear, but in Alook you can create userscripts which are loaded automatically based on custom URL regexes (similar to Tampermonkey). While Alook has a one-time fee, note that Gear requires you to subscribe before you can use their userscript functionality (the monthly cost is currently higher than the one-time fee of Alook).\nFinally, there is an external way of injecting userscripts into sites via a MITM-proxy approach. I found at least two repos, however haven't tried them out yet:\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/SimonAlling/userscript-proxy\n\n*https://github.com/eBay/userscript-proxy\nNote that encrypted websites complicate the proxy approach as you need to decrypt your HTTPS traffic using a certificate.\n\nA: At the moment there is the GreasePocket project in the works.\nHave a look at their website, but it's far from a finished product, it will also probably need to be run on a JailBroken device.\n\nA: Userscripts for Safari is currently in the process of being ported to iOS 15, as a Safari Web Extension.\nIt's a big task though, they'll appreciate help.\n", "Q: Can I screen-share with a computer that has no monitor? Can I screen share with a computer that has no monitor?\nMy computer is OS 10.6.8. \n\nA: Two things to be aware of:\n\n\n*\n\n*The \"virtual\" screen on the headless Mac will be limited to only 4 standard resolutions (800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1024 and 1680x1050). All except the last one are 4:3 aspect ratio. \n\n*The \"login\" screen may be displayed in a completely different resolution than the working desktop. I haven't been able to determine how this screen size is determined, possibly it depends on the last resolution used when a standard monitor was connected. \nIt's a great way to set up a home media server. Good luck.\n\nA: Yes you can. Enable Screen Sharing by connecting the computer to a display (and keyboard) once. Then you can easily unplug display/keyboard and access the computer via Screen Sharing.\nAs long as you do not mess with the network and screen sharing settings of the headless computer you also can turn it off and reboot it without loosing the ability to screen share again.\n\nA: Yes, I do this very thing with a \"headless\" Mac. I encode video on a Pro, but send it to the MDD G4. I can then pull it to any TiVo in the house. In other words, the headless mac acts as a server. I can also see its (non existant) 'screen' through VNC. \n", "Q: How can I keep songs unchecked? I share an iTunes library on another computer in my house. If I uncheck songs so they don't play when I shuffle, the next time I share that library the songs are checked again. No one else re-checked them. How do I keep them unchecked?\n\nA: when you share a library with another computer, you are not sharing prefenences, just the files.\nSo when you check/uncheck files you are doing this for teh duration itunes is sharing, as soon as iTunes stops sharing the library, the computer will \"forget it\" and its settings. \nWhen it is shared again it will see a new fresh library.\n", "Q: Is there a way to remove songs in a playlist from an iOS device? There are situations where (for example to free up storage) on an iOS device with iTunes Match enabled, it would be nice to be able to remove songs on the device, based on certain attributes. For example, it would be convenient to be able to remove all songs one has given low ratings. Match makes the first part of this easy: it is a simple matter to set up a smart playlist that is synced through iCloud to the iOS device; but it appears that (while it is possible to download missing songs from within a playlist) it is not possible to remove them. Is this in fact the case? \nIs there no way to remove songs from a device from within a playlist? \n\nA: From your question it seems you are trying to remove one file from the device.\nI do not believe this is possible to remove individual songs that have been cached over iTunes Match on your iOS device (at this stage). Your alternative is to turn off Match from Settings -> Music -> iTunes Match to clear off all cached items and free up space\n", "Q: Mail.app showing odd characters instead of actual text I have this problem happening on a new 2011 Macbook Air with the latest version of Lion. When viewing emails, the text is coming through as odd characters that look like a capital A in a box (see image below). If I click Reply, and then convert the message to plain text, the entire text of the email displays fine. But in the message list, preview pane, and full message view, I get the odd characters any time I'm display rich text.\nI've verified that my Mail.app is up to date, and in the Fonts & Colors preferences, the message font is set to 12pt Helvetica.\nI can't say for certain, but I believe this started after I installed a trial of Microsoft Office for the Mac. The entire office suite (including Outlook, Word, Excel, everything) was installed.\n\n\nA: We went digging through FontBook and found a bad copy of Georgia installed by Microsoft Office. After going through about a dozen duplicated font files, and removing the older versions of each, we restarted Mail.app. At this point everything is working perfectly.\n\nA: The font selected in the Preferences, is used only for displaying messages what are haven't defined font.

Purchase date May 2013. New macbook pro.\nFind Font Book. How? Push with two fingers on the \"Finder\" icon. Select \"Find\". Then type in \"Font Book\" and a window will pop up.\nclick into the font section and two finger scroll down through the list of fonts.  Some will have a little exclamation point inside a triangle to the right of the font name.\nSelect one that has the triangle and the window to the right will show an example of that font and below it there will be a statement saying there are duplicates for that font with two options. \"Fix automatically\" or \"Fix Manually\". Choose automatic. If it is greyed out, and won't respond to your selection, you have to expand the font to show all the different kinds (normal, bold, italics, etc.) and then select them individually and select fix automatically.\nI had maybe 10 of these. Takes all of a minute.\nClose mail (red x in top left hand corner) and reopen and should be all fixed.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I was suffering the same thing.  For me, it was a bad Arial font...  Once removed, I restarted Apple Mail and all okay.\n\nA: I just fixed the same problem. \nFirst I had to identify what font was bad. I cut and pasted the \"A squares\" into word and it showed up normally as arial. I also played with the font in mail. Making it plain text showed it was fine. I made it Arial bold and it also showed fine, so normal arial was the culprit.\nI then went to Font Book (it is in the applications folder for those new to the Mac) and selected Arial (only the plain, not the bold, italic, etc). I then used the menu command to disable it. I restarted mail. The message now showed up fine but with all the text shown as Arial Bold (regular arial was disabled). I then enabled the Arial font and everything then worked fine.\nI am not sure why disabling and then re-enabling worked but it did.\n", "Q: Downgrade 10.7.2 to 10.7.1? Is it possible to downgrade from Mac OS X 10.7.2 to 10.7.1 without deleting all files?\nI want to do this because of this: https://superuser.com/questions/349740/mac-os-x-lion-10-7-2-update-breaks-ssl\n\nA: No - but you can make a back up, erase and only install 10.7.1 and migrate the user and apps back from the backup.\nIf you run into oddball crashes - you can chase them down if the solution isn't obvious. You can then always go to 10.7.2 or worst case erase and go back to 10.7.2 and re-do the migration a second time from the snapshot you have now.\nIt's not generally good to go back, but sometimes you don't have the things that really matter or the side effects are manageable or you can re-set up those things by hand once you have discovered them.\nSpotlight also makes it very easy to see what has been changed since you went to 10.7.2 and you could just revert to then and move those by hand.\nNothing about this is automatic, but it's certainly doable.\n", "Q: Where can I find alternative alert sounds for my iPhone 4S? There is a very limited set of Alert sounds in Sounds > New Mail > Alert Tones.\nIs there a way to add other sounds to this list?

Luckily, Apple made restoring painless thanks to automatic backups (unless you disabled them, which would be problematic).\nSo really, don't waste time struggling and simply restore, it will take 20-40 minutes depending on the capacity and usage of your iPhone, then you'll be up and running again :)\n", "Q: How can I add movies to my iPad from both my home and work computers?

Ideally I'd like to watch them using the Videos app that comes with the iPad but I'd be fine buying another app if it's necessary.\nthanks!\n\nA: There used to a be a method where by you edited the iTunes Music Library.xml file on the second computer to make your device think the two computers are the same computer. I'm not sure if it works any more though. Explanation guide here\nAlternatively the easier way of doing it is to take advantage of iTunes file sharing and use an application from the app store. The advantage of this is that most app store video playback applications support more file formats than would be supported though the default video playback app so you won't need to do any conversion before copying the videos across.\nThe application I would recommend, and use myself, is AVPlayerHD\n", "Q: Can iTunes Match grab \"invisible\" (placeholder) songs? I have a drive which has a folder full of MP3s on it. At one point, I added all of these MP3s to my iTunes Library; sometime after that, my folder turned into a Unix executable file.\nMy question is this: If I turn on iTunes Match and point it at the list of songs I have in my library -- as the list is still there, even though the files themselves can't be found -- will it scan the info saved in iTunes and use that to match with songs in the cloud? Or will it need the actual files, from which it can scan metadata to check in Gracenote?\n\nA: iTunes Match matches based on the audio fingerprint of the files, simply having the metadata won't do. The process has nothing to do with Gracenote's metadata in any form. If it was just based on the metadata, you could change it and pretend to have whatever songs you want, and clearly that's something Apple wouldn't want you to be able to do.\n", "Q: Sync Services error on Windows 7 when iPhone 4S is plugged in I am currently running iTunes 10.5.1 on a Windows 7 Home PC and when I plug my iPhone 4S into my computer via the USB cable it freezes. iTunes in Task Manager shows up as not responding and after a few minutes it displays the following error:\n\niTunes was unable to load data class information from Sync Services.\n  Reconnect or try again later.\n\nWhat causes this issue and how can I resolve it?\n\nA: I googled your error message and I found this page and this apple support thread.\nHope this helps ! \nEdit:  Solution #2 in the Lei Mobile site seemed to resolve my issue.

I'm considering to replace my existing windows based server on my small business (< 10 employees) with a mac mini server with Lion Server installed. But after a look at the App Store, I noticed a lot of 1-star reviews labeling this OS as \"a toy\", \"unstable\", \"downgrade with respect to Leopard Server\" and so on. My usage for this would be essentially for e-mail management (but using Kerio to have exchange support), calendar, internal web site (web apps), account management, some centralized apps (to be accessed using VNC), iOS based devices management, Windows virtualization to support legacy apps (essentially for accounting), VPN.\nI'm not asking for a complete review of this OS, this is not a right place, bust just a short comment from the users in the community that had the change to work with this new OS. \nBesides, and this is a bonus question, do you have some experience in using Lion server to manage centralized Xcode development? (we currently use our own MacBooks and we keep in sync using Git, I'd like to know for different approaches based on OSX Server).\n\nA: I've never tried any of the Mac Server products. But AnandTech has a pretty good in-depth review of Mac OS X Lion Server. A few of the conclusions:\n\n...server administrators will be happy to know that, in spite of its deeply cut price and consumer-friendly distribution method, Lion Sever stacks up favorably against Snow Leopard Server.\n\nand \n\nOS X Server is most useful in a handful of different scenarios: the first is that you have a small network that’s in need of a full-featured but easy-to-manage and simple-to-license server product. The second is that you’re managing a network of any size that used to be all-Windows, but hosts a growing number of Macs (this is often the case in education, for example) - OS X Server knows that it’s going to be finding its way into a lot of Windows houses, and as such it integrates fairly well with existing Active Directory setups. The last is that you have a bunch of iOS devices flooding your network and you have no idea what to do with them - iOS management may be Lion Server’s ace in the hole.\n\n(emphasis mine)\nSeems to fit your intended usage pretty well.\nAbout your other question:\n\nBesides, and this is a bonus question, do you have some experience in using Lion server to manage centralized Xcode development? (we currently use our own MacBooks and we keep in sync using Git, I'd like to know for different approaches based on OSX Server).\n\nKeep using git, use the OSX server as central repository (maybe consider buying GitHub Enterprise or using an free/open source alternative for managing your git interaction). Install a CI-tool (Jenkins or similar) on the server and use it to create automated builds. Should work quite nicely.\n", "Q: Constant external disk activity when MacBook is in sleep state I am using an external 2.5\" hard drive (the original MacBook HD, which has been replaced by an SSD) in an Icy Box USB3 enclosure on my MacBook (running OSX Lion). When the MacBook goes to sleep, the activity led of the external hard disk gets on and you can hear a humming sound through the enclosure. This means there is some constant hard drive activity going on if the notebook is at sleep, which I find rather strange.\nDoes anyone experience a similar behaviour? Anyone know how I could fix this?\nMaybe there are some people here that also use Icy Box enclosures for external drives, I'd be very interested if this is related to the enclosure?\nThanks for any hints.\n\nA: A couple of questions that might shed some light on your subject:\n\n\n*\n\n*By chance, did you clone your HDD onto the SSD?\n\n*If so, is your original OS X install still on the HDD?\n\n*Are any of your active data files located on the HDD?\n\n*Is the HDD activity constant or intermittent?\n\n\nIf (1&2) or 3 are true, the system on the SSD might be making calls to files on the HDD. This could be happening, especially if you didn't rename the HDD since your transplant. If 4 is constant, the activity cold be due to the USB 3 chipset attached via USB 2.\nHere's a simple way to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*SSD to HDD calls:\n\n*\n\n*Launch a program on the dock\n\n*Does the external HDD activity light start flashing as the program launches or shortly thereafter?\n\n\n*Use your Mac \"normally\" for a while.\n\n*\n\n*Close all obviously open data files.\n\n*Eject your external HDD by dragging the icon to the trash.\n\n*Does the OS show an error that it cannot eject the drive because files are open?\n\n\n*HDD dependency \n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MacBook. \n\n*Disconnect your HHD. \n\n*Reboot your Mac.\n\n*Run programs you don't expect to need anything from the HDD and watch for errors or \"missing\" data that could be attributable to an older data file.\n\n\n\nIf any of the above conditions happen, your Mac has open files on the external drive. \nCompared with \"old\" operating systems, recent editions of OS X are rather advanced operating systems, especially when compared with our \"archaic\" notions of how computers work. Power constraints, most noticeable in notebooks and tablets, are the new target for today's advancements. Newer hardware is often \"asleep\" when we are actively using the computer--not just powering down the processor or video subsystem when it can. Today's systems shut down motherboard-level systems, like the network connection, whenever it can... sometimes even while we're surfing the net!\nToday's Macs have what Apple calls \"power nap\". This is a sleep state where the computer \"wakes up\" portions of the system to download updates, make back ups, and other necessary system maintenance. Even if your MacBook doesn't fully support power nap, your MacBook is probably making periodic updates to various system files.\n\nA: *\n\n*It may be more a IcyBox related problem than a Mac OS related one. Have you tried a different enclosure?\n\n*You could give http://www.stclairsoft.com/Jettison/ a try.\n\n*And last but not least it may be a feature called \"Power Nap\", please see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5394?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US - is your external drive your Time Machine backup location?\n\n", "Q: 15\" MacBook Pro Thunderbolt Display Flickering - Firmware Updates? I've had my 15\" 2011 MacBook Pro for about 6 months now, and I picked up a VGA adapter for it a few weeks ago. (Thunderbolt -> VGA)\nI have the laptop in clamshell mode running an Acer monitor, and will occassionally (every 5 minutes or so) experience a weird flickering, as seen in the first few seconds of this video:\nYouTube Link (Not my video)\nI see the weird flickering/distortion, but it doesn't last nearly as long as shown in the video, it's maybe 0.25 seconds of \"shaking\", then back to normal for another 5 minutes.\nI experience this issue with multiple different VGA adapters, so I'm convinced it's a GPU/port issue.\nI've installed all the EFI/SMC/Thunderbolt updates available in Software Update, but I've heard that there was a separate firmware update being passed around the Apple Discussion forums, but not released publicly.\nMy question, is whether I should take this in to an Apple Store to have it checked out, or whether there's a firmware update I can install to test? I've seen firmware updates for cinema displays, EFI updates, etc. but they haven't fixed my problem, so I'm wondering if there are any last efforts I should try before scheduling an appointment.\nEdit: I'm not using an Apple adapter, but a Monoprice version. I have used a friend's Apple adapter however, and the problem continued to occur. Also, I'm running Lion 10.7.2\n\nA: Since your MBP is a 2011 (and we're still in 2011), I'll assume it's still under AppleCare 1st year warranty. If so, consider getting it checked at the nearest Apple Store. Do mention you tried applying the firmware update. The list of Apple firmware and SMC updates is here.\nIf you don't live near an Apple Store, and if you're curious, you could try to diagnose if there's a hardware problem using Apple Hardware Test (AHT) which is a software in one of the DVD that came with your MBP. \n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the DVD\n\n*shut down the MBP, then \n\n*hold down the D (for diagnostic) while you power on your MBP\n\n*Follow the on-screen menu and note down (or take a photo of the\nscreen) any errors reported before you call Apple Phone Support.\n\n\nA: I saw this on a few external VGA monitors of various types, finally pinned it down to one or two specific mDP-VGA adapters - problem was resolved when I installed this update on them.\n", "Q: Commercial application for cataloging & categorizing images? The marketing team where I work is looking for an application that would allow their team to categorize and sort a slew of images and have them be read/write for the whole team. My understanding of the request is that they're looking for iPhoto or Adobe Bridge on a commercial level. The database and images would need to be accessible from multiple people, on multiple machines; preferably stored on a Windows file share. The number of people using the application could range from 5-50 people depending on how widely the solution gets adopted.\n\nA: Often the first step in finding a solution is to put a name to it and in this case it sounds very much like you are after a Digital Asset Management package. \nThere are many of these available;\n iView Media Pro used to be held as a benchmark and this has had a few transitions of ownership and is now sold as Media Pro 1 by Phase One. Another option could be the Portfolio Suite of products from Extensis. \nYou might even find that Apple Aperture or Adobe Lightroom  would fit the bill although these are targeted at photographers shooting in RAW format than being general DAM solutions\nThere are many more each with their own strengths and you need to review these along with the marketing team to find the best fit for their workflow.\n", "Q: Is there a cost for submitting an application to the AppStore?

I've also tried using Systems Events in AppleScript but I can't get the \"click\" command to work at all.\nThanks!\n\nA: Keyboard Maestro supports both creating macros by recording them and recording and playing back temporary macros:\n\n\nA: I've tried out a whole ton of software for doing this, but Sikuli is now by far the best automation software I've come across.\nIt uses computer vision to automate any part of the GUI. For example, you can just take a small screenshot of the button you want to click on and paste it into your script and Sikuli will click on it. It also provides a series of really easy to use functions for automating keyboard input and mouse clicks. Plus, it uses Jython for its automation scripts so you can use Python or Java in your scripts too!\nReally recommended.

What about with the same app? I am getting an iPad and my mate has an iPad as well. We have a bit of a band and want to know if it's possible to 'sync' 2 iPads together to use music making apps that will play at the same tempo and be on beat with each other?\nIs there some way to do this or something we need to do? How can we achieve true syncing of 2 iPads for music app usage?\n\nA: This is something that the app itself would have to have supportfor.  There's no support for this inherently in the iPad or in iOS.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible, and great fun!\nOne way to synchronize apps is using Korg's WiST technology. This allows apps on multiple iDevices to synchronize over WiFi. They maintain a list of compatible apps on their site. \nAnother method is to slave all of your iDevices to a single MIDI clock (e.g. a drum machine that sends clock over MIDI). There are multiple ways to get MIDI into your device including the Alesis IO Dock, the iRig MIDI, and the Line6 MIDI Mobilizer. This is a little more hassle than the WiST approach because you have to wire up a bunch of cables, but it opens up a larger group of apps since there are many apps that support CoreMIDI that do not support WiST. When shopping for apps in the App Store, look for any that say they support CoreMIDI. This page has a good starting list, but is by no means comprehensive.\nFinally, in addition to this multiple-iPad fun, you can also make use of MIDI between apps on a single iPad. e.g. Running a sequencer that is controlling a synth app running in the background. Not all CoreMIDI apps support it, but many do. I've been having a great time using the Genome sequencer app to control synths such as Animoog.\nIt's a great time to be a musician and have an iDevice....much is possible now that was impossible only months ago!\n", "Q: What is the best way to consolidate two iPhoto libraries into one library? On the family's iMac my wife and daughter have separate user accounts, each with their own iPhoto library. My wife has asked me to consolidate both libraries into a single library for convenience.\nWhat is the best way to do this? Can it be done with the existing software and utilities that come with Snow Leopard or is there a 3rd party utility that facilitates the process?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: There's a third party application named iPhoto Library Manager which seems to have a good reputation for merging, splitting and generally managing your iPhoto Library:\n\n(source: fatcatsoftware.com)\n\nA: If you have Aperture 3.3, you can merge multiple iPhoto libraries as shown in this Apple KB:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open Aperture 3.3 or later.\n  \n*Click the File menu and choose Switch to Library > Other/New. Use the library selector to choose one of the iPhoto libraries you'd like\n  to merge.\n  \n*Choose File > Import > Library\n  \n*Select one of the remaining iPhoto libraries you wish to merge.\n  \n*Repeat steps 3-4 for each additional iPhoto library you wish to merge.\n  \n  \n  The library you started with in step 2 above includes content from all\n  the merged libraries. The other libraries are still present (and\n  useable) on your computer. Once you have confirmed that the unified\n  library is working correctly, you may wish to remove the other\n  libraries from your hard drive.

Let me repeat that, following this method will not preserve the albums from one of your libraries.  Ok, lets go.\nDetermine which library will be your primary library, this lucky library WILL be able to preserve its albums.  (In your case, probably your wife's library, your daughter will just have to recreate her albums)\nIf you have an external drive:  Copy this primary library onto the external HDD, Get Info on the external and enable Ignore Permissions on the drive.  Reference:  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1198\nIf you don't have an external drive: Make copies of both iPhoto libraries in the  /Users/Shared/ folder.  Use chmod or finder to change permissions for all users to read and write to these libraries and apply to contents. i.e.  sudo chmod -R 777 Example_iPhotoLib\nOpen your primary library with iPhoto.  Find the secondary library in Finder, right click and chose \"Show Package Contents\".  Look for a folder called 'Masters', or possibly 'Originals' depending on your version of iPhoto.

Instead use the Gmail account method directly via Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Add account... > Gmail, enter your Gmail account credentials and enable contact sync. \nYou can alternatively export your iPhone contacts to your computer to a single vCard file and then import the contacts file to your Gmail account. \n\n\nA: Look at this thread in Google forums. \nMy personal best way to sync with Google is iTunes (without Mac OS X) or AddressBook.app (on Mac OS X) at the moment.\nSome answers are below, but have a look to the page:\n\n\n*\n\n*(iCloud control panel for Windows)\n\n*You have to stop sharing your contacts in iCloud, and then preferences you sync Address book as you did before and sync with iTunes\n\n*Export contacts from GMail & import them into Address Book and then… merge yourself.\n\n*Set up your Gmail contacts via Exchange on your iPhone. http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=138740 . This is the only way I know of to actually synchronize your Gmail Contacts to your iPhone directly from Gmail’s servers over the Internet via Push.\n\n*Third-party services like Soocial, NuevaSync and others.\n\n*Third-party programs for your phone\n\n\nA: This may work for you.\nYou can get an iCloud account free using your iPhone. or the via the PC.\nYou can sync your contacts to the iCloud. From there you can export all your contacts out as a vCard file from the iCloud Addressbook web interface.\nThen in gmail import the file.\nHere  is a link to my answer to a similar question that shows you how to export from the iCloud Addresbook.\n\nA: If you prefer not to synchronize your adressbook with your computer it is easy to synchonize your iPhone Contacs directly to Gmail.\nI followed the instructions from Contacts sync between the iPhone and Gmail using CardCAV.\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iPhone open “Settings” then go to “Mail, Contacts, Calendars” and choose “Add Account”\n\n*Select “Other” and look under “Contacts” to choose “Add CardDav Account”\n\n*Enter the following details into the fields, then tap “Next”. Server: google.com, User Name: googleemailaddress@gmail.com, Password: your password\n\n*Syncing starts immediately, exit out of Settings and launch the “Contacts” app to check on the progress, the entire process may take a while for large address books\n\n\nThis approach works well to solve another problem where you only want to see contacts with phone numbers on your iPhone.\n\nA: There are several approaches to transfer iPhone contacts to GMAIL\nA) from SIM card using iPhone only\nB) using iTunes\nC) using vCard file\nbut FIRST you need to establish a sync between your iPhone and GMAIL\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up your GMAIL account on your iPhone for calendar sync:\n\n*\n\n*on iPhone open Settings>Mail, Contacts, Calendars>Add Account> Google\n\n*enter your credentials\n\n*enable 'Contacts'\n\n*OR follow Google's instructions.\n\n\n*on the iPhone, open Settings>Mail, Contacts, Calendars\n\n*\n\n*scroll to section 'Contacts'\n\n*open Default Account\n\n*select your GMAIL account\n\n\n\nA) transfer contacts from SIM card to GMAIL directly\nStraight foward but only applies to contacts on the SIM card.\nOn your iPhone, open  Settings>Mail, Contacts, Calendars>Import SIM Contacts. Choose to import SIM Contacts to \"Google Mail Calendar\".\nB) transfer contacts from iPhone using iTunes\nSorry, the answers given here referring to iTunes syncinc Contacts to Google Contacts do not apply any longer as this option was removed from iTunes 11.1 and later.\nC) transfer contacts from iPhone using iCloud & vCard file\nFollow the instructions provided here.\nBasically, you enable syncinc your contacts to the iCloud and then download the contacts from the iCloud as vCard file using the browser. You can then import this file into GMAIL.\nPS: Instructions tested on iOS 8.x\n\nA: As I understand your contacts are not on iCloud, but just synced locally with your Mac. What I would do is to share them to Gmail from your Mac: Preferences > On my Mac > synchronize with Google.\nThat way you'll have two ways syncing between Gmail and your Mac + your Mac will sync with your iPhone.\n\nA: If you're looking to just move your contacts in bulk, you could buy this $5 app and be done in a few seconds - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/contact-mover/id456984826\n", "Q: Scheduling Application to Modify Its Settings How does one go about scheduling \"settings\" to change on applications given certain criteria? For e.g., I am using Adium, and between the hours of 8am and 5pm, I would like that status to set to \"Available\", and outside of these hours go \"Invisible\" or \"Away\". \n\nA: The easiest way to do this is via Applescript. The commands you need are both single line. To make Adium go online the Applescript code is:\ntell application \"Adium\" to go online\n\nTo make it go invisible, the Applescript code is:\ntell application \"Adium\" to go invisible\n\nPretty simple. You can also tell Adium to go away. Open the Applescript Editor App in your /Applications/Utilities directory and create two Applescript files; one has just the command to go online and the other the command to go invisible/away. Save them as .scpt files with appropriate names.\nThat was the easy part. The next question is how do you trigger the right script at the right time? You essentially need to create the following two scheduled tasks:\n\"run adium_invisible.scpt at 5pm everyday\"\n\"run adium_online.scpt at 8am everyday\"\nThe default way to do this, built into OS X, is to use the UNIX 'cron' daemon. It's documentation can be found here. If you find the cron interface intimidating, there is a GUI app you can use to set tasks up, called Cronnix. \nYou'll still need to understand the timing syntax that crontab files use though. Wikipedia can get you up speed on that. Inside your user crontab you want to create two scheduled tasks. They should look like this:\n0 8 * * * osascript path/to/adium_online.scpt\n\nand\n0 17 * * * osascript path/to/adium_invisible.scpt\n\nosascript is an Apple specific command that lets the shell call and run an Applescript. You give it the path to the .scpt file as a paramater. Once you have the two cron tasks set up you should be good to go.\nIf editing the crontab file by hand, and not using Cronnix, don't copy and paste these verbatim, as tabs are required between the hours, minutes, days etc., not spaces as I have here.\nAlso, you could create cron tasks that use osascript and pass the Applescript directly like this:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Adium\" to go online'\n\nHowever, storing the Applescript commands in a separate file gives you flexibility in the likely event that you need to change what commands get run later on. You can add to or remove from the .scpt files without needing to interfere with the crontab file.\n", "Q: How can I recover iPhone data lost after iOS upgrade? I've had my iPhone 4  for about 3 months and when I connected it to my computer today I was prompted to update the iOS, so I did. But somehow I didn't realise that it meant I was going to need some kind of password once the update had been downloaded etc... having failed to remember it after a few attempts I simply left iTunes to get some troubleshooting advice. When I got back it seems that the password prompt had disappeared and my phone seems to be back to its original settings.\nHow can I restore the data that was on the phone?\n\nA: Right click your iPhone in your iTunes' sidebar, then select \"Restore from Backup\". iTunes should ask you now what backup you want to restore from, just select the latest one (should be preselected) and it should start restoring all you data.\n\nA: If the iPhone backup was made using iTunes on OS X, here's something that you can try to find the password to to the device backup:\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Keychain Access app (an OS X system utility)\n\n\n*Look for \"iPhone Backup\" in the name column.\n\n\n*If you see that phrase, double-click on that entry to see something like this window/dialog box:\n\n\n\n*Click on the Show password checkbox a\n\n\n*Enter the requested password (likely to be either your OS X account password or the admin password).\n\n\n*If successful, the password will be displayed in plain text\n\n\n*Use this password to attempt the restore again.\nUnfortunately, if you're using Windows this tip won't be applicable.\nNote: This technique will only work if you've elected to save the password in the Keychain\n", "Q: Wireless or bluetooth stero for streaming from imac? Looking for info from mac users who stream audio from imac to a stereo in the home. \nafter a bit of research, I have narrowd my choices down to \nSoundfreaq SFQ-1 (bluetooth) or the Pioneer X-SMC3-S Music Tap AirPlay Music System (airplay)\nCan anyone tell me the difference between airplay and bluetooth for streaming audio  (only about 10 feet).\n\nA: In short, Apple's proprietary version of DLNA, which they call AirPlay, is based on WiFi hardware. Bluetooth speakers, obviously use Bluetooth hardware. WiFi has a far greater bandwidth, so go with that. You shouldn't have any problems.\nIn theory, Bluetooth could work, but in many implementations bandwidth can be limited, so it's not uncommon for your audio to be decoded from its original format (mp3 aac etc.) by your player (iPod, iPad etc.), then re-encoded to an intermediate format for transfer over BT, and then decoded once again before actual playback.\nThis extra encoding step obviously degrades the quality. This doesn't happen with AirPlay. Since the bandwidth of WiFi is much larger than any implementation of Bluetooth, even if the audio file is decompressed on the player side, it could be sent to the receiver without any re-compression at all.\n", "Q: Any problems adding a new SSD to iMac 2011? I have an iMac 2011 mid-model. I bought this without a SSD, now I want to add one.\nI heard the model have several problems, when it comes to adding extra SSD's. Including TRIM support and Temperature Sensor. But I want to add it if those problems are acceptable.\nI want to know if there are any problems, with adding a SSD, and workarounds for the problems.\nIs there any Apple certified SSD that I can purchase now or later? I will bring my iMac to Apple's service center, and let them to add it, to keep AppleCare.\n\nUpdate.\nI'm living in Korea. And here is no Apple retail store and Genius bar. So I asked this question here.\n\nA: The German IT magazine computerbase has done tests comparing the efficiency of  TRIM and garbage collection in SSDs of 2010.\nThe result is that recent SSD have a very effecient garbage collection so that the performace difference to TRIM vanishes. (source, German)\nUpgrading the HDD on a Macbook does not void the warrenty (source). However, it does on a Macbook Pro (I think). Since replacing the hard drive on an iMac will require lots of tinkering, I'm pretty sure that you will void your warrenty.\nDetailed guides as to how you replace your harddrive can be found here:\nThey include pictures, step-by-step guide and info on what kind of screwdrivers you need.\n\nA: I asked a Genius about replacing hard drives in Macs, and he replied that there is no problem warranty wise as long as it's not an iMac. For this machine only you need a technician to do the work. Has to do with temp sensors.\nAs a side note, RAM modules in every Mac except the MacBook Air (because they are soldered on the motherboard) can be replaced by the user without voiding the warranty, including the iMac.\nAlso, unless I am mistaken, if you did not order the iMac with an SSD built-in you cannot put one in later on as it misses the support brackets for a 2.5 in HD, therefore it gets tricky. Perhaps an Apple tech can prove me wrong. This is really odd from Apple, because it must not cost a 100$ to put support in the machine, and it gives options to buyers… Oh well.\n", "Q: How can I create a Lion USB recovery stick without Mac OS? I have a serious problem that I need help with.\nBackground\nWhen I installed Lion, the install of a recovery partition failed. This is not good, since the offical Lion recovery disk assistant (http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1433) is only able to create a recovery USB with an existing Recovery HD on the mac.\nMy attempt to fix\nThere are many (inofficial) workarounds: Since they are all the same, I'm sure that you're familiar with it:\n\n*\n\n*Open the package contents of the Lion installer from the Mac App store to get the InstallESD.dmg.\n\n\n*Restore the InstallESD.dmg onto the HFS+ formatted USB (GUID). I used a 8GB USB stick.\nSource: create Lion install USB\nThis solution should be more convinient than the official soluion, since the Lion software would not have to be downloaded again.\nWhat happened\nThe install USB booted fine. But the install failed. It could not even start. I got the message like: Install failed. Restart Installation.\nBut I did not restart immediately, since I wanted to format my whole SSD with the Disk Utiliy (which went fine). I formatted the SSD using the same Lion install USB. Having restarted the installation, I keep getting the same message! I've tried different partition layouts (always HFS+ with GUID):\n\n*\n\n*only Macintosh HD partition\n\n*EFI and Macintosh HD partition\n\n*only Untiteled partition\n\nI'm not able to install Lion! I do not have any install DVD (for any Mac OS). I only have the Lion Installer from the Mac App store with the InstallESD.dmgon a backup. Is there any way I can create a Lion Recovery Stick (with or without the dmg) on Windows or Ubuntu?\n\nA: I've heard rumblings that the Lion Recovery Update will recreate the Recovery HD partition. Have not tested it myself: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1464 (For future reference, does little to help you now).\nBut to address your immediate problem, install Snow Leopard (using the discs that came with your Mac). Then once installed, log into the MAS and reinstall Lion.\n\nA: Actually, as it turns out my install USB was just fine. I just had to do a PRAM reset.\n", "Q: How can I delete a file marked as backup item? I'm trying to delete a file, but I get a message from Trash saying: \"The operation can’t be completed because backup items can’t be modified.\"\n\nWhat does that mean and how can I delete it?\n\nA: The root of the cause\nTime Machine backups are protected at kernel level -- on a verbose boot it's possible to spot in the first screenful of text a TMSafetyNet.kext extension being loaded. \n\nThis ensures the integrity of your backups. Access control provisions\n  are applied via a kernel extension located at\n  /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext\n\nDeleting in Time Machine\nThe officially sanctioned method for deleting items from a specific backup or all of them is to locate the item in the \"in space\" Time Machine view and selecting the appropriate delete option from the contextual menu or the Action button in the toolbar.\nThe ability to move backups to the Trash added in Lion is not only comparatively more buggy, but designed to operate on entire snapshots, i.e. the folders named with the time the backup was created which in turn contain a directory for each included volume.\nDeleting from commandline (more flexible, more control)\n\nThere exists a a helper program (commandline binary) at... \n/System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/MacOS/bypass\n\n...which allows you to supply a command and argument to completely\n  bypass the access restrictions.\n\nIn Lion you run:\nsudo /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/MacOS/bypass rm -rfv /Volumes/[disk]/Backups.backupdb/[path]\n\nIn Mountain Lion bypass moved to the Helpers directory:\nsudo /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Helpers/bypass rm -rfv /Volumes/[disk]/Backups.backupdb/[path]\n\nIn OS X 10.10.5 (from a comment by David Anderson), this is now at:\nsudo /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers‌​/bypass rm -rfv /Volumes/[disk]/Backups.backupdb/[path]\n\nCredits:\n[1] - Michael Rushanan on TMSafetyNet bypass\n[2] - A brief explanation of the Time Machine Safety Net by Joel Cowgill\n[3] - Similar question on SuperUser\n\nA: According to this thread at Apple, this is a bug. This means it will hopefully be fixed in a coming update to OS X.\nIn the meantime, you have to relaunch the Finder, which you can do either through force quit (⎇⌘⎋, or through the  menu), or by less violent means by quitting it normally, which you must first activate through the following command issued in the Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder QuitMenuItem 1\n\n\nA: bypass is in  /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/ in High Sierra (OSX 10.13.3) on my iMac.\nAlso if you want the list of files deleted with -v, you should redirect to a file because the scrolling verbose list is impossible to read in Terminal.\n\nA: It seems like the bypass program doesn't exist on Big Sur. I was able to delete files from the backup after renaming the top-level backup folder from \"Backups.backupdb\" to \"Backups.backupdb.tmp\":\nmv Backups.backupdb{,.tmp}\n\nI also had to remove the ACL:\nchmod -R -a 'group:everyone deny add_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown' Backups.backupdb.tmp\n\n", "Q: Lion Preview window stuck as always on top After accidentally pressing some wrong keys, it seems my Preview window is stuck in 'Always on Top' mode.

I choose No Machine because the client software reportedly runs on Windows/Linux/Mac, but I am having trouble with the Mac client. \nWhen I startup the No Machine (also called NX) client, I get an error message saying \"NX Client for MacOS/X was not able to find the Apple X11 Server. Please be sure that the Apple X11 bundle is installed in either the /Applications or the /Applications/Utilities directory and retry.\"\nI have heard X11 is installed by default on Snow Leopard (I run Snow Leopard). I have the X11 app, when I open a terminal and type startx the X11 server appears to start up, but I get a message about a missing .serverauth file.\nAny advice on how to get this working?\n\nA: I installed the XQuartz application. It was in /Application/Utilities/XQuartz.app. I just renamed it from XQuartz.app to X11.app and everything works fine, so far.\nUpdate: don't install XQuartz for use with No Machine. I opened a text editor and started typing, all the keys were screwy. For instance, the Delete key was now comma, all the letters were transposed, general chaos. I replaced XQuartz with the official X11User.dmg package and this keyboard problem went away. One more step I had to take: when on the remote desktop I tried to cd into a different directory, and hitting the \"d\" key kept showing me the desktop. If you want to cd, you will need to go into System->Preferences->Keyboard shortcuts. Scroll down, and notice an entry \"Hide all windows and show desktop\" which is mapped to \"D\". Change this to Alt+D or Ctrl+D and cd away!\n", "Q: Exclude mails from specific Inbox in \"Inbox\" view Is it possible to exclude a specific mailbox from the \"Inbox\" view in Mail.app?\nI got 3 mailboxes in mail.app, 2 of them are mail accounts for normal mail communication, 1 is used for receiving mails from senders which sometimes send to much mail (newsletters etc.). The problem that occurs is that all the newsletter mails show up in the \"Inbox\" view preventing me to see the mails from the other mailboxes.\n\nA: Update - Mail has a filter option to the right of the 'sort by' at the top of the email column where you can choose which mailboxes, or to only show unread, etc.\n\n\nA: In Mail preferences, you can choose Accounts in the preferences toolbar, select the email account associated with the newsletters, choose the Advanced tab, and uncheck the \"Enable this account\" checkbox. You will need to save the changes in order for this to take effect. \nI tested this in Mail on Lion with one of my three mail accounts. Mail removed the account from its mailboxes list; the messages were gone from the unified Inbox, but the account settings remained and I was able to bring the account back just by checking \"Enable this account\" again.\n\nA: I don't know of any way to exclude a mailbox from the Inbox view, but you could make a rule in Preferences to move all messages sent to that inbox to a specific folder. Messages to that inbox will appear for a moment when they arrive, then move to the folder when the rule fires, usually less than a second later.\n\nA: In my iPhone 6+ instance of Inbox disappearing, I found an Edit key above the mailboxes and clicked on it. Up popped the lineup showing Inbox had a button not selected while all the others were selected. I clicked that button on for Inbox, said finished, and there was my Inbox all back into view. \nI knew it was still around because I could move a trash item back into the Inbox. \nThere was a simpler solution here than I had expected.\n", "Q: How to make iCloud on Windows sync bookmarks with Safari, not Internet Explorer I'm trying to get iCloud on my PC to sync its bookmarks with Safari, not Internet Explorer.\nAccording to Apple's documentation, it is possible to sync iCloud bookmarks to Safari on Windows:\n\nYou can sync bookmarks between your computer and your iOS device. When\n  syncing is enabled, all bookmarks will sync. You can sync bookmarks\n  with the following applications:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Safari (Mac OS X)\n  \n*Safari for Windows (Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7)\n  \n*Microsoft Internet Explorer\n  \n\nMy bookmarks are syncing fine between iPhone and iPad, so I'm sure I've got that end set up correctly.\nI do have Safari 5.1.1 (7534.51.22) installed on my Windows 7 PC.\nHowever, my iCloud control panel is only offering me the option to sync Bookmarks with Internet Explorer, and not Safari:\n\nThings I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've read through the notes on Apple's iCloud: Troubleshooting iCloud Bookmarks, and can't see anything about it failing to spot that Safari is installed.\n\n*Uninstalled and re-installed Safari\n\n\nIs there anything else I should try, to get iCloud on Windows to offer syncing with Safari?\n(I daren't turn on syncing Bookmarks with Internet Explorer, as I have hundreds of bookmarks there, that I don't want synced to my mobile devices)\n\nA: Unfortunately you have to turn it on and then it will let you change it. I'll have a look tomorrow to see if there is a preference file that can easily be changed to skip having to sync with IE.\n\nA: I wanted to add.  I actually performed the same action that Clare tried by moving my IE favorites before syncing.  Everything worked as it did for her, but I noticed that I had to hit the \"apply\" button in order for the changes to take affect.  \nKnowing that, I chanced moving the IE favorites back unsyncing and resyincing using the Windows 7 iCloud control panel and then chose to sync with Safari instead of IE.  It worked perfectly!! :)\nJust thought this might help any future guests to this site.  As long as you don't hit apply, it won't automatically pollute Safari and iCloud with your IE favorites which is precisely what I did not want either.  At least that was my experience.\nHope this helps!!!\n\nA: Update :: According to the following:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/132602/safari-for-windows-is-probably-dead-how-to-migrate-to-another-browser/\nSafari for Windows is loosing official support, and will no longer be updated soon. From the same source (WARNING: I do NOT present this as my own opinion on the matter. This is a statement from an author at HowToGeek):\n\"If you’re using Safari on Windows — well, you shouldn’t be. Apple is no longer updating Safari for Windows. iCloud allows you to synchronize bookmarks between other browsers on your Windows system and Safari on your iOS device, so Safari isn’t necessary.\"\nIn addition to this, Apple support page at the following address:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203519#windows\ndoes not mention Safari for Windows as a supported browser. I do not intent to present an opinion. I am simply stating that Apple might not be supporting the browser anymore, and therefore, iCloud sync might not be worth pursuing at this point using Safari for Windows. As such, I can only suggest that you switch to either the latest version of Firefox, Google Chrome, or Internet Explorer. I am a bit late to this, so I apologize if I have complicated anything. \nJust providing an updated answer, with new documentation.\n", "Q: Can I get notifications for specific emails sent to my Gmail account on iOS? I'm trying to find a way to receive notifications on my iPhone when certain people email me to my gmail account. \nI don't want to use SMS. Is it possible to configure iMessage to receive emails?\n\nA: Either set up your Gmail account using Mail or try the Google's official Gmail client. Both use iOS's built in notification system. SMS and iMessage are entirely different protocols and do not support IMAP or POP3 (the protocols used for Mail).\nAs for parsing the notifications for only certain emails, I'm not sure that's at all possible if you'd still like to receive notifications for other emails too.\n\nA: for reference, Boxcar does exactly what I was looking for and this video has great instructions on how to do the forwarding.\n", "Q: How to create an Automator \"Mail Service\" to compose the body of email from the content of a file? I would like to create a \"Mail Service\" with Mac Automator to create a New Message that automagically fills the body with the content of ascii file ~/Documents/MailBody.txt\nI can select the file with \"Find Finder Items\", but not sure how to get its content to pass it as input to \"New Mail Message\". Note I want to add the content of the file to the body, not to attach the file itself.\nThanks a lot in advance.\n\nA: The solution I have found is this: the first action in the workflow is \"Run Shell Script\" which just cat ~/Documents/MailBody.txt. This actions returns \"text\", which is passed as input to action \"New Mail Message\". It seems to work fine, even when the txt file has multiple lines.\n\nA: I created a Automator Service that receives Files or folder from Finder.app.\nThe first action is to Get Selected Finder Items. It then passes these files to a Run AppleScript action containing the following:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    set thisFilePath to (the first item of the input) as text\n    set fileContents to do shell script \"cat \" & quoted form of POSIX path of thisFilePath\n\n    tell application \"Mail\"\n        activate\n        set composeMessage to (a reference to (make new outgoing message))\n        tell composeMessage\n            set the content to fileContents\n            set visible to true\n        end tell\n    end tell\n\nend run\n\nThis grabs the file name of the first file selected, which is then passed to a shell script that uses cat to get the contents of the text file. Then AppleScript is used to create a new message with the contents of the file as the body of the message.\n\nA: Using the shell is a pretty cool solution.\nJust in case you wanted a more \"Automator-esque\" solution, you could try the following sequence:\n1) Get Specified Finder Items (point it at your txt file)\n2) Open Finder Items (select TextEdit.app so it will open in TextEdit)\n3) Get Contents of TextEdit Document (this returns the text you need for the rest of the workflow)\n", "Q: How to fix Quicktime that is not playing videos from Apple's website?

And even when I try to reformat the drive it simply won't do it.\n\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated, I've been trying to fix this for I don't know how long.\n\nA: If you do not care about loosing the data already on it, try changing the partition scheme instead of formatting it.\nSelect the drive like in your screen shot, then click on Partition tab on the right, then select 1 partition from the pop-up menu on top of the graph. Then click Options at the bottom and select GUID (the first option) in the next window, close it, and then click Apply in the main window. You can also set the format of the partition before you click apply. It should already have selected Mac OS Extended. All this assumes of course that you wish to use this drive with a Mac and only a Mac… if you want to use it on a PC and a Mac, you'll have to select other options, but still possible.\nIf that still doesn't work, it's probable the drive is physically damaged.\nWhat you have right now is a Windows Partition scheme and a FAT formatted partition.

Many of the tunes that are waiting to upload are my drum corps audio files.\nMy first question at this point is will the match service upload the drum corps files? \nSecond, because many of these recordings are very hard to come by, will match just hang up trying to find them?\n\nA: iTunes Match is supposed to directly upload your tracks that were unable to be matched by iTunes so you can access them. This is supposed to be regardless of where they are from. I would suggest perhaps converting the files to mp3 if they are in a different format, or perhaps AAC, and then giving it another go. \n\nA: iTunes 10.5.2 was released yesterday and lists Match improvements in its release notes - you might want to try updating.\n", "Q: What does it mean to sync apps to iPhone What does it mean to sync apps to iPhone? I don't understand exactly what this does, or why I'd want to turn it on. What are the advantages/disadvantages of enabling \"Sync Apps\" in iTunes to my iPhone?\n\nA: This Apple Support article provides a quick summary of what syncing does. Basically, as XAlexOwnZX mentions, a sync copies applications, music, and other information between your iTunes account and your iDevice. This process backs up the content (apps, etc.) on your computer.\nThe advantage of syncing is that if your iPhone gets corrupted, you'll be able to restore it (or its replacement) to working condition, with all of the purchased content that is installed.\nThe disadvantage is that syncing takes time - however, with iOS 5, you can choose to sync over WiFi and you don't need to tether your iPhone to your computer.\n\nA: If you Sync an iPhone with iTunes, and that phone gets stolen, you will be able to restore all your app data (high scores, spreadsheets, diaries, databases, etc.) from the iTunes backup to your replacement iPhone.\nIf not, and the apps don't otherwise store data in iCloud or other cloud storage, all that data will be lost.\n\nA: Syncing apps synchronizes applications between your phone and your Mac, ensuring that all apps you bought on iTunes and your Mac go to your phone, and that all apps you bought on the App Store on your phone get synced back to iTunes.\n", "Q: iTunes Match is stuck on the last song in step 2 of the initial process iTunes Match has worked well, so far, except the process seems stuck on the last song. I have more than one song 'waiting', so I can't tell which song this is stuck on:\n \nConsole shows the (not very)helpful:\n11/19/11 3:37:16.652 PM iTunes: _AMDDeviceDetached (thread 0x11302b000): Device 'AMDevice 0x7fe5afcdad00 {UDID = b40482688c52cdaa90ef21796c4dad05f445c06b, device ID = 29, FullServiceName = 58:55:ca:e3:7a:39@fe80::5a55:caff:fee3:7a39._apple-mobdev._tcp.local.}' detached.\n\n\nA: in iTunes, select your Library -> Music and then right click on the Column Headings and choose iCloud Status. Sort by this new column and the file causing the problem should have a 'Waiting' Status which you can then remove.\n\nA: The progress bar sucks. Just wait for it to finish.\nMine also went through the songs fairly quickly and then got \"stuck\" on the last song. But checking network activity showed it is in fact maxing out my internet connection's upstream bandwidth.\nSo clearly when it says there's one song remaining it is in-fact uploading data for many songs.\nYou can enable the \"iCloud Status\" column in iTunes (right click on column headers to add it) and see the songs that are \"waiting\". These are songs that have not yet been matched. For me there were several hundred even though the progress bar said all but 1 had been matched.\nI created this smarty playlist:\n\nTo find songs that haven't been uploaded, and the list did gradually get shorter for me. If it seems to freeze up, quitting iTunes will resume where it left off and may help.\n", "Q: windows like (context menu) unzipper in mac? Is there an app that acts like windows-based unzipper?\nI don't want my unarchiver unzip when I click a zipped file. I rather want to right click then click 'unzip' or something similar.\nUpdate: I think people are getting confused. I know that I can unzip a file simply by double clicking it. I DON'T WANT THAT. I like to have a context menu like windows application. Is this possible?\n\nA: You can make an automator service that sends the selected file to Archive Utility.app (found in /System/CoreServices) and make it into a contextual menu item\n\nA: Unarchiving is built into OS X. All you have to do to unarchive a file is to open it. You can do that by double clicking, pressing cmd+o (between i and p), or by right-clicking and choosing Open.\n\nSo, just right-click on the file and select Open to unarchive. Ta-da, no extra software required.\n\nA: No, there is nothing like that on the Mac platform that I am aware of.\nI believe what Moon is going on about is that in the Windows Explorer, it's possible to do more with .zip archives than what the Mac Finder lets you do. In the Windows Explorer you can use a contextual menu command to inspect an archive with multiple items inside and see those items listed before you decide whether you want to extract anything or not. You can extract only certain items within an archive without extracting the entire archive. No, there's no way to get that kind of flexibility in the Mac Finder. \nUsing the contextual menu in the Finder on Mac OS X, you can either extract the entire contents of a .zip file, or nothing.\n", "Q: Does the MacBook Air Support 5.1 Surround Sound The title pretty much says it all.  I have a 13\" version of the newest-generation MBA.  Can I get 5.1 surround sound?  If so, do I have to do anything special to enable it?\n\nA: Not natively, no. The headphone jack is a standard TRS with no optical component.\nYou can buy a USB sound \"card\" with 5.1 audio output such as this one:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Zalman-ZM-RSSC-External-Sound-Card/dp/B0001OZ2K8\nThat's just the first one I found, so a little more market research might be in order. Something similar to it should get the job done though.\n\nA: You can also get 5.1 out with an HDMI cable and a suitable HDMI switch with optical or other 5.1 out.  Note that running HDMI through a TV (or even possibly certain receivers) likely won't work, because of anti-piracy hardware that restricts output audio quality.  There are a number of cheap switches that people have done this with.  I don't want to suggest anything specific as I haven't used them myself.  You can also get 5.1 audio out from an Airport Express's audio jack.  Unfortunately the Airport Extreme has no audio out (at least not the model I have).\n", "Q: How to get a device back in Parallels? I'm using Windows 7 with Parallels Desktop. \nWhen I open an instance of Windows 7, I see the 'Device' menu. I can choose which OS (Windows or OS X) can own a device within the menu.\nThe problem is, When I let Windows own my mouse, there's no way to get it back to Mac OS. The only way I found so far is to open a terminal then kill the instance of Parallels.\nHow do I get a device back within Parallels?\n\nA: Is SmartMouse enabled for your Virtual Machine? If not, clicking inside the Parallels window will capture the mouse and you will need to use Ctrl+Option (Ctrl+Alt) to release it back to your Mac.\n\nA: In early versions of Parallels, you can get the mouse back by shutting down the VM. You could also connect a second mouse and leave that controlled by OS X - in effect you'd have a \"Mac mouse\" and a \"Windows mouse\".\nFor other devices, suspending the VM should give control back to OS X. (If you want to do this with the mouse, I suggest either the two-mouse setup or learning VoiceOver so you can do mouse-only things with the keyboard.)\n", "Q: 3G downloading a retina-only game? If I try to download a game from the AppStore from an iPhone 3G, and the game says in the requirements that it only supports 3GS+, will the AppStore immediately disallow me the download or will it let me download nonetheless?\n\nA: No, it will complete the purchase request regardless. It just won't run on your device.\nIf you did make a purchase that doesn't run on your current device, you will have to contact the iTunes team and request a refund.\n\nA: If you are viewing the application from your device and it gives you a purchase option then it WILL let you buy it without further confirmation of device model.\nIt IS possible for a developer to hide an application from being purchased on specific device models. If you can still search for the application on your device they have not done that. See this thread on StackOverflow for technical proof that applications can be restricted to certain devices correctly.\nThis could mean that the developer wasn't aware of this capability, or that the 3GS+ requirement is just a recommendation, as they feel that the game runs too slowly, or has not been testing on an iPhone 3G.\nIn the end its up to you. Condsider trying a demo version of the game if available, or if you know a friend who has previously purchased the game for a higher spec iPhone trying their copy on your device temporarily.\n", "Q: How can I solve false duplicate in Mail.app? I recently switched to Mail.app from Outlook 2011 and have been importing some of my archive messages.  The problem is that for many of the messages, Mail.app seems to think they are duplicates so it only shows one of them.  However they are NOT duplicates, they are not even close.  All the messages are there, I can search in spotlight for them, however if i want to scroll through a folder they will not show up.  I can see certain messages have a '8 Duplicates' or similar written on the top right corner, and when you click that all the messages show, but it is only temproary, as soon as you move to a different folder and then come back all the messages are hidden again.\nHow can I turn this off?  And any ideas why Mail.app thinks the messages are duplicates?  they are on different dates, different subjects, 100% different as far as i can tell.\n\nA: Sadly enough, I can't help you on why Apple's Mail think your mails are duplicates.\nI have two ideas to fix the problem though.\n\n\n*\n\n*Rebuild your Mailboxes (Select all your mailboxes, then in the Mailbox menu, choose rebuild). Wait the process to end completely (check nothing is being done in the Activity Window), then restart Mail;\n\n*If this does not work, you can always disable the option that groups mails that are related (In the preferences, in Viewing, de-select \"Include related messages\"). This is not ideal as it disable one of the main features of Lion's Mail, but if it's buggy…\n\n", "Q: iTunes Sync only new music/videos I am quite confused about the iTunes sync process. \nWhat I expect to happen is that whenever I add any new songs to iTunes, it should only sync those songs. I do not want to wait for the entire music library to be synced again. (Doesn't this also create duplicates?)\nSo how do I do this? I was reading online and some people said to use the \"Sync only checked songs...\" option and others said to use the \"Manually manage...\" option. What is the difference and which is the best way?\n\nA: How do you sync only new songs? You put them in your library, and click sync. If you have duplicates in your library, you will have duplicates on your device. What you see listed in iTunes is exactly what you will have on your device.\nThe answer is not any harder than this. \"Sync\" means exactly what it says on the tin, it updates your device with the data in your library. It will \"update\" songs that have had information changed (cover art, lyrics, or if a title was corrected, etc.), and it will add new ones you've put in the iTunes library.\nWhen you click sync, iTunes does not overwrite everything and start from scratch. It synchronizes your library. It picks up new changes and writes them to the device, and it will even bring new content back from the device if you bought something from the store on your device.\nConsidering your exact requirements:\nDo not change any settings in iTunes. Leave music syncing options completely default, and iTunes will do exactly what you want it to do.\nYour exact requirement is exactly what iTunes is supposed to do.\n\nA: According to Apple Support, \"Manually manage\" is a means to use your iDevice with multiple computers. From this article:\n\nAutomatic Mode\nWhen your device is set to automatic mode, iTunes automatically\n  updates your device's music library whenever you connect it to your\n  computer. iTunes transfers new songs you've added and erases songs\n  you've removed. The first computer you connect your device to is its\n  \"home\" computer. The music library from that computer is copied to\n  your device. When you connect your device to a different computer, an\n  alert box appears with this message:\niPod is synced with another iTunes library dialogue\nIf you want to delete the music library on your device and make the\n  new computer its \"home\" computer, choose Erase and Sync. iTunes will\n  delete all songs and playlists on your device, and then will copy the\n  music library and playlists from the new home computer to your device.\nIf you want to move the iTunes Store purchases on your device to the\n  new computer, choose \"Transfer Purchases.\" The new computer must be\n  set up with your iTunes Store account and authorized to play your\n  iTunes Store purchases in order to transfer your iTunes Store\n  purchases. \nManual Mode\nIf you want to keep the music library on your device, but copy songs\n  or playlists from the music library on the second computer, click\n  Cancel when the dialog box appears, and then set your device to manual\n  mode\n\nThe article also has this caveat:\n\niPod shuffle and iPhone are intended for use with a single computer.\n  You cannot load music from multiple computers or iTunes libraries onto\n  iPod shuffle and iPhone like you can with other devices.\n\nOn the other hand, \"Sync only checked songs\" provides you with control over which songs you want to sync with iTunes - you can select the following items to sync music from: playlists, artists, genres or albums. More details can be found in this Apple Support article.\nIf you're not using either an iPod shuffle or iPhone, you can combine both options for maximum control over music syncing options.\n\nA: Although it's basically been said already before:\nSyncing means copying only changes over.\nIt may still take time to sync for other reasons, but it should not be because old items in library are copied again. How have you confirmed that iTunes is in fact copying old items over to the device rather than copying only new changes?\n", "Q: .HFS+ Private Directory Data? On my file exchange partition that both Mac and Ubuntu should have access to, I cannot manage to get access from Ubuntu.\nThis partition was created with the Disk Utility in Lion.\nUnlike before, there is a file or directory called .HFS+ Private Directory  Data? (including the questions mark!) This was not there the last time I create such a partition. I cannot delete this file/directory.\nWhat is this? Why can't I copy/delete files onto this partition from Ubuntu? It worked the last time I created such a partition. This partition has journaling disabled.\nThis .HFS+ Private Directory Data? cannot be seen with ls -la in the Terminal of Mac OS!\n\n\n\nA: \".HFS+ Private Directory Data\\r\" and \"␀␀␀␀HFS+ Private Data\" are special folders used by the HFS+ filesystem to handle hard-linked folders and files, respectively.  They're normally pretty well hidden, but apparently something went a little wrong and one of yours became visible. Don't worry about it, though -- as long as they're doing their jobs, you shouldn't need to interact with them directly.\n\nA: This is likely to come up again with macOS High Sierra and the replacement of the HFS+ filesystem with APFS, especially if you've used something to create hard links.\nAfter an upgrade to APFS from HFS+, all my hardlinked folders were replaced with either a same-name empty file or a symbolic link. I found all the files that were in those folders in folders under /.HFS+ Private Directory Data.\n\nA: Oh well! Repairing permissions with Disk Utility did the trick...\n\nA: Oh dear. If you're seeing the .HFS+ Private* directories, you're likely using a very old version of your HFS+ driver on Ubuntu. I would stop using this immediately and update to something more current.\nBasically, the purpose for that directory is that HFS+ doesn't support hard links—not really—and UNIX, upon which OS X/macOS is based, requires them. So what they did was to use a really obnoxious duct-tape kludge to simulate hard links; any file that has more than one link is moved into one of those invisible directories as an \"inode\"; the actual hard links are really just aliases to the \"inode\" file with a special flag set in its metadata. There's also a second HFS+ Private Data folder that holds something else; I can't remember what it is anymore, but it's another thing like this that really should be a file-system-level feature, but isn't.\nSo basically, if you're using an HFS+ driver that shows those folders, you're basically dealing with an older version of the spec. If you interact with files in that directory, you can mess up your drive but good. And if you delete it—well—just don't. Find a newer version of the driver that supports the latest version of the spec, or better yet, upgrade to APFS, which is implemented in a much more sensible manner (or so we assume; they still haven't published the specification on the thing AFAIK).\n", "Q: Is it possible to use baseband at 4.10.01 on iOS 5.0.1? Is it possible to use baseband at 4.10.01 on iOS 5.0.1? \nHow, considering that redsnow 0.9.9b8 is does not recognise 5.0.1 ipsw?\nIs it safe to upgrade iOS wirelessly or it will upgrade the baseband too?\n\nA: Baseband mismatching is not something you should jump into haphazardly. Apple tunes the baseband for the specific build of iOS. Running mismatched is not advised and you may experience problems that range from dropped calls to excessive power consumption. All of which are almost impossible to accurately diagnose.\nRedsn0w doesn't provide baseband preservation. You'll need to look into PwnageTool to preserve your baseband.\nUpgrading using the OTA update will update the baseband along with the OS. When you say \"safe,\" I'm assuming you are talking about baseband preservation (see above), so no, it wouldn't be \"safe\" for unlockers.\nBut considering there's no actual unlock for baseband 4.10.01 on the iPhone 4 (GMS), it really doesn't matter in this case. The last unlock available for the iPhone 4 (GSM) was for baseband 01.59.00, which appeared alongside iOS 4.0 - 4.0.2. And since you can't downgrade your baseband, you needn't concern yourself with the preservation.\n\nA: The Gevy unlock SIM card works with bb 4.10.01.\nIt is very important for Gevy users to preserve the baseband at 4.10.01.\n", "Q: CMOS Battery in MacBook Pro 2007 CMOS battery in my MacBook Pro (2007, pre-unibody) has died recently.\nI am looking for a replacement, although all I could find so far was only used batteries off ebay.\nIt says following on the battery's shrink wrap: \nCR2025/USTC\nPW3+3V\n7 8 21\n\nUnder the shrink wrap it says:\nPanasonic\nCR2025\n3V\nMade in Malasya\n\nSo I am wondering if I could simply take a good quality CR2025 battery and use it instead of buying a used one? Or is this some super-secret version of CR2025 only Apple managed to get its hands on and I'd better off getting a used one, although straight of a MacBook Pro?\n\nA: Any standard CR 2025 will do the trick.\n", "Q: What more does installing Homebrew allow me to do? \nHomebrew is a useful tool to install UNIX tools.\n\nWhat are useful things to do with homebrew? What tools can you recommend?\n\nA: HomeBrew is a package manager for mac. It facilitates the installation of different tools by installing and configuring all dependencies as well as the program itself.\nYou can think of it like the Mac App Store for unix apps. If you are familiar with Linux, then Homebrew is exactly like the Linux package manager.

Just install MacPorts and run\nsudo port install gcc46\n\n\nA: I prefer using High Performance Computing's versions of the GNU compilers, as I need a Fortran compiler, which Apple does not offer.\nthis solution avoids installing anything BUT a GCC compiler, whereas fink and macports will add quite a lot of stuff to your system. The HPC compiler requires having Apple's developer's tools installed already, but since you mention having gcc I guess you do.\n\nA: There might be a simpler way using Package Managers like Fink, Homebrew, MacPorts but according to http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/browse.php?sec=devel Fink doesn't have a g++ package. I don't use Homebrew or MacPorts so you'll have to do your own research. \nAnother (relatively more work) option is to download g++ version (4.3.1) you want, config it differently (i.e point it away from the default directories for e.g. /usr/bin but instead have the executable symlink to /usr/local) before building and installing it. \n\nA: Thanks to Kenneth, you can install this pkg made for Lion:\nhttps://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/downloads\nNote, this may be the wrong gcc for your needs as it is just an 'Xcode independent' installation of the Apple provided compilers, so the GCC is the same as that version of Xcode from whence it came.

I have a 24\" iMac and have used Boot Camp to install Vista on a 100GB partition of the hard drive. Can I install Parallels Desktop as well so it will be easier to switch between Mac and Windows?\nI have 4GB of RAM. Is that enough to run Parallels?\n\nA: Yes, you can install Parallels on your Mac in addition to Boot Camp. Keep in mind that this takes a fair amount of hard drive space, so be sure you've got the space to spare.\nAs for your memory situation: I run Parallels on a MacBook with 4GB or RAM. It works okay, but it's rather slow. Most things will run acceptably, but performance will be better using Boot Camp.\nI should also point out that this setup will be a bit of a hassle. Since the two Windows systems will be independent of each other, any changes you make on one will not copy over to the other system. That means that it could take a fair bit of work to keep both systems synchronized and up to date.\n", "Q: How can I retrieve passwords from old keychain after a new install? \nPossible Duplicate:\nMove items from old keychain to new keychain \n\nHaving reinstalled a clean Snow Leopard. Is there a way to access the old keychain - I still have the old time machine backup -  and copy all the wifi account information to my new keychain?\n\nA: You can copy and paste individual passwords between keychains using Keychain Access.

I have a jar file containing a swing application that needs to run on Windows, OS X and Linux. At the moment, Windows users are launching it from explorer, and Linux/OS X users are running a shell script to launch the jar.\nHowever, I suspect the shell script is probably not necessary in OS X. I don't own an OS X machine myself, but Wikipedia says that Jar Launcher will run the jar file when it's double clicked.\nIs it reasonable to assume this is always present on an OS X system with 10.5 or above?\n\nA: The Apple supplied java implementation comes installed with Mac OS 10.5 and 10.6 and .jar files are associated with the jar launcher application. As long as the java application starts right into a swing interface it should open without any problems.\nOn Mac OS 10.7 Lion however the java runtime is not installed by default and users trying to launch .jar files will be greeted with a dialog asking them to install java to continue (which requires admin privileges).\nOfficially the apple supplied java runtime is depreciated so you can't count on it working in any future version of mac os x\n", "Q: How can I delete a picture from my Photos app on iPad?

I'd like my email from my phone to look like the email from my MS Outlook. The email from my phone looks like ASCII, and there is no way to create a signature with a logo as far as I know. Any suggestions?\n\nA: iOS 5 brought some limited rich-text formatting options to Mail. When you're composing an email, select the text you want to format, and tap the right arrow. You'll see a button labelled \"BIU\", tap that and you get options to bold, italicize or underline the text. You can also control the indentation level.\n\n(Image from Macworld)\nAs you can see, it's fairly limited, and to my knowledge there's no way to insert a signature with any images. You could keep the logo you want in your iPhone's Pictures and copy/paste it as necessary, but that's obviously very labour intensive.\nYour could look into alternative mail apps. There aren't a lot to choose from, but something like MarkdownMail might work well for you. It's just meant for composing HTML formatted emails, you'd still use the built-in Mail app for checking, etc. \n", "Q: How to diagnose an unknown apache setup?

This was a fresh install of itunes. I connected the device and the first thing i did was right click & back up. It took a while because he had filled all 7Gb of the device. Sure enough, I could tell that the music was now listed in my itunes library.\nThen i started the update (which decided to do its own back up again, which seemed identical to the previous because of how long it took). The new IOS downloaded and installed and lastly it said it was restoring the apps and music. That restore process was quite quick and to my horror, ended up with almost 7Gb free. So the music and apps were gone! I look in the itunes library and the music is all gone too.\nThese apps and music were not purchased content (AFAIK). In particular i think the apps were free ones (little games), but all these apps will need to be re-downloaded. Plus save game files may be gone.\nI do not know if the device was jail broken or anything. I am not an Apple Pro.\nWhat went wrong?\nAdditional\nI also tried to do a restore and there was a drop down list. In that list was:\n<Name's> backup 20/Nov/2011 5:20pm <-- correct time of my backup\n<Name's> backup\n\nI did the restore using the 1st backup. However, the data did not restore and version of iOS remained at 4.2.1\n\nA: An iOS device's backup typically contains just applications' settings & data. So, if you have just made a backup without saving app or music, you've lost everything.\nSorry :'(\n\nA: Was this iPod ever synched with your computer? If not, then your iTunes tought this was a new iPod you acquired and erased the contents to put yours instead.\nAs for apps, they can be redownloaded from the app store. But as for music, unless they were bought from the iTunes Store, they need to be redownloaded onto it.\nI know all this looked like it should not have happened, and this is why iCloud exists: to liberate iOS devices from having to be linked to a computer to get any content whatsoever.\nDo you see anything on the iPod main screen? Does it look like a fresh new install?\n\nA: Sometimes iTunes thinks that the iPod is yours but has stuff on it but it was synced with a different computer and a different iTunes so iTunes needed to format it.\n", "Q: iPad 2 wifi only FaceTime with iPhone 4s I recently got an iPad 2 wifi only and my boyfriend just got the new iPhone 4s but if I try and FaceTime him it just rings out. I know that he only has 3G at home, is this why? And how can he FaceTime me when I have no number on my iPad? Really confused please help!\n\nA: Facetime only works over WiFi and can find people using either an e-mail address or phone number.\n\nA: I think FaceTime work only on WiFi between iOS/OS X devices. It is totally free which why the Mobile GSM operator don't want you to use it over 3G.\n", "Q: How to change the cover photo of an album? Looking at the album index in the Photo app, it seems that the photo used as the album cover is picked randomly. Is it possible to change the picture that is used as the album cover?\n\nA: In my experience, the cover photo is simply the first photo in the album. When you're within an album, hit the button in the upper-right corner to manipulate the photos; then tap and hold a photo until it \"inflates,\" at which point you can drag it to move it around. You'll just have to be happy with your album cover being the first photo in the album.\n(Edited to clarify the tap-and-hold gesture.)\n\nA: Hold down the photo you want to be the cover, copy, then paste over the top of the first photo in the album to make it your cover.  \n\nA: In Photos 1.0 (the 2015 update of iPhoto), open the album, select the photo you want to use as the icon for the album, right click and choose Make Key Photo.\n\nA: Click on the photo you want as your cover photo, then right click, then select Make Key Photo. \n\nA: Enter the album you want to change, click on picture you would like as the cover, under image click make key photo.\nI had the same prob, this worked for me on march 2016.\n\nA: The only way I found to get the right photo for the album was as follows:-\nCreate a new album with the same name. Select the cover photo you need from the original album and \"Copy\".Return to your new album and \"Paste\". Return to the old album and select \"All\" and add them to your new album. The cover photo should now be the one you selected.You can now delete the original album. It sounds long-winded but I cannot find any other way!\nGood luck! It does work.\n\nA: Here's how I finally figured this out in Mac OSX Photos (i.e., not 'iPhoto').\n1) Just open up the photos film strip by clicking on the tiny upside-down 'V Photos' button bottom center of the Project view.\n2) Select 'Placed' or 'Unused' photos from the dropdown on the right - i.e., depending on where the photo you want currently resides.\n3) Dbl-click the Cover page to open it up large (optional).\n4) Simply drag whatever photo you want over top of the existing Cover photo.\n5) You can change the small 'Flap' photo in the exact same way.\nI haven’t found a solution on the web version of photos or the iOS / tv versions, but they sync over iCloud from the Mac app once you change things there first. \n\nA: Based on my personal experience. For Windows users, the album cover photo will be the first alphabetical photo. Make sure before synchronizing the folder to put the photo that you want as the album cover with the first alphabetical name.\nIf you already synchronized the folder and you want to change the album cover after being synchronized one of two options will work for you.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can change the name of the new wanted album cover to be the first alphabetical name, then synchronize again. If it didn't work then you should proceed with step number 2.\n\n*Swap the names between the current album cover photo and the photo you want to put as album cover.\n\n\nA: At least in ios14 I can go to the picture in the album, hold it, and just hit the make key picture option.\n\nA: Your albums that are synchronised with your iPad are also in iPhoto. Open the album that you want to change the photo cover for and reorganise your pictures so that they are how you want them to be displayed in your iPad. Your iPad will display the pictures in the same order as they are listed in iPhoto.\n", "Q: iPhone Jailbreak Experts - Accessing the email storage? Is this possible? I have emails stored on my iPhone that are no longer accessible anywhere else, and I'd like to copy them out. I could forward them through a different account, but there are hundreds, so I'm looking for a shortcut.\nI'm more than happy using the command line and playing with SQLite DBs that I know Apple use for some things on there, I just don't have much experience with the file structure on the iPhone.\n\nA: Unfortunately, emails are not backed up by iTunes/iCloud, so you'll need to go deep into the filesystem (you need to be jailbroken).\nAssuming you are, then these are the steps you need to follow:\n1) SSH into var/root/library/Mail\n2) The mail database is contained inside a file called EnvelopeData. There is no .sqlite extension, but it is an SQLite database\n3) Open the SQLite database using a program like MesaSQLite\n4) Extract\nI haven't personally tested this, but it should work.\n", "Q: What are the downsides of getting a foreign keyboard layout on a MacBook Pro? A 13-inch MacBook Pro costs £999 in the UK, compared to $1,199 (about £760) in the US. \nFor this reason (I guess), brand new US models cost about £850 on UK eBay. The obvious downside is the keyboard layout is US, not UK.\nOnly a couple of keys are different on US keyboards. So if it's possible to change system preferences to interpret it as a British-layout keyboard, then I'm happy to put up with a couple of wrongly labelled keys, if it saves me £150.\nBut are there any other downsides I should bare in mind? Any possible incompatibilities etc?\n\nA: I once was in a similar situation to what you described—I'm an American and brought my U.S. MacBook to the UK.  A couple observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*U.S. keyboard layouts are substantially different from the UK ones. Many common punctuation characters, including quote marks, are mapped very differently. I found UK keyboards too awkward to use and did virtually all of my work on my own U.S. keyboards.\n\n*U.S. keyboards do not include the pound sterling symbol or the negation symbol used in the UK. You can get them by using Option key combinations, but that can be a bit of a pain.\n\n*As bmike mentioned, if you need a keyboard repair you'll face a substantial delay. Someone spilled a drink on my MacBook in a pub towards the end of my stay, and about a third of the keyboard was shorted out; when I took it in to an Apple Store, they warned me they would need to hold the computer for several days while replacement parts arrived.  I couldn't spare the laptop for that length of time, so I spent the last couple weeks of that trip using an external keyboard with my MacBook, and repaired it when I got home.  (That option, of course, won't be available to you.)\nAll in all, I don't think I would recommend it for you.  That £150 is buying you freedom from a lot of hassles.\n\nA: If the physical key layout is different, you will have to get a replacement part for the exact keyboard you have chosen. It could result in a slight delay if you needed the mac repaired in the future.\nAnother gotcha is that the warranty for Apple products is established in the country of sale. For someone in the UK where Apple has official retail stores for service, this formality shouldn't be of any consequence - but if you are buying a mac from a country without official support it could add logistics to contact Apple in the country of sale and they could ask you to present the mac in that country for service (or pay for the shipping).\nAgain, in practice this is not a huge drawback for most - but it can add cost and delay if Apple chooses to enforce those terms of the warranty when you want to take advantage of that specific service.\n\nA: One major difference that you cannot change via any software layout is that Apple British and International keyboards are ISO and not ANSI:  They have an extra key to the left of the z not present on the US keyboard.\nAlso as far as I know it would be a mistake to think that a \"British\" Macbook will have the standard UK keyboard with quote marks at Shift + 2, as shown at\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#United_Kingdom\nInstead it will have Apple's own version of a \"British\" keyboard, which is essentially the same as the US keyboard except for #/£.  Shift + 2 will produce @ and the quote marks are the same as for the US keyboard.  This is shown at\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT2841\n\nA: If only a few keys are different I bet it won't be too difficult to adapt to the layout. In Canada we have both US English and French Canadian keyboards, and most people I know have adapted really well to US English layouts even though they only speak and type french.\nAs for warranty, I was assured a few years ago that buying a computer in a different country was no problem as long as you buy the AppleCare 3 years warranty, which lets you bring the computer for repairs in any Apple certified repair center or Apple Store. But just to be safe, you should ask Apple. It could have changed since.\n", "Q: Mac OSX hard disk gives invalid PEOF - how do I back up data? Yesterday my macbook pro (running 10.6.8) refused to reboot, and after booting it using the install disk and running disk utility I got Invalid catalog PEOF.

So, from the looks of it, I may have to reinstall the OS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there anything else I can try?\n\n*If not, how can I access the disk and try and save some data before formatting (if at all)?\n\n\nI'm not stranger to command line unix and all that if needs be.

If so you can connect the failed Mac to your other mac via firewire and you target disk mode.\nPower off the failed mac, connect it to the working mac via firewire. (The working mac can already be powered on) Boot the failed mac and immediately hold down the T key on the failed mac. Continue holding it until the firewire icon shows up on screen. You should then see the mac mounted on the working mac. \nLink with more details http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1661\nAlso an interesting link with some details on your error http://support.apple.com/kb/TA21624?viewlocale=en_US\n\nA: If you don't have firewire as an option, here's how I recently recovered almost all my files using DiskWarrior:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your machine from your install disk \n\n*Run Disk Utility\n\n*Create a new image of your corrupt disk on an external drive.  To do this, connect your external drive then select the corrupted drive in Disk Utility and click on the \"New Image\" icon in the top menubar.  Compressed is ok.  This could take a lot of time and space depending on the size of your disk.\n\n*Plug the drive with the new image into another computer with DiskWarrior installed\n\n*I was not able to mount the image in Finder (double-clicking on the dmg file), so I went into the terminal and manually mounted the image.  I used this call to ignore warnings and basically force it to mount:\nsudo hdiutil attach -noverify -mount suppressed /yourpath/yourimage.dmg\n\n*Launch DiskWarrior and choose the blank entry in the drop-down to rebuild the directory structure\nSince DiskWarrior does not provide terminal access when booting from the DVD, there is no way I could find to directly force the mount on the existing machine, hence the extra step of copying the image out.\n", "Q: What is wired memory? I'm trying to figure out what is using all of the memory in my Macbook Pro running OS X Lion. I have 8 GB of memory total.  When I quit all active programs except Finder and Activity Monitor, then run a memory cleanup (FreeMemory) it shows about 5 GB of Free Memory, 1 GB of Active Memory, and 1.5 of Wired memory.  Support docs say Wired Memory is full of stuff that \"can't be moved to disk\".  What is taking up all of that memory?  Is it the menubar processes?  I have mozy, last.fm, dropbox, and growl running in the menubar but they all appear in Activity Manager and don't appear to be using a significant amount of memory. I also run Parallels but it is shut down completely so I thought all of it's stuff should be written to disk.  Is it just Mac OS X using a reserved chunk of memory and labeling it \"Wired\"?\n\nA: There are several very good answers and I wanted to add a tool that anyone can use to document exactly what wired memory is in use - so a specific answer as opposed to a general explanation of the categories.\nIn the case where all Applications are quit and there is still a sizable amount of wired memory, you can use the sysdiagnose command to capture the system memory allocation when it is using more memory than you expect.\nThen save / move the tar.gz archive of results out of /var/tmp to the Desktop so that they don't get erased upon reboot.\nThen reboot your Mac and before launching any extra programs, repeat the sysdiagnose command and compare memory before and after to see what processes were taking the extra wired memory.\n\nA: From what I can tell, wired memory belongs to the kernel, the innermost core of Mac OS X.  It's many layers removed from the icons in the menubar, which are just ordinary apps showing themselves in an odd way.\nWired memory is used for some of the core functions of the operating system—things like keeping track of all the applications on your system, or open files and network connections, or chunks of memory used by various drivers.  The \"page tables\" that form a map of your system's memory are also stored in wired memory, and a system with more memory needs larger page tables.  I suspect that the memory used by the integrated video chips in most Macs is wired as well, but I can't find anything that says that outright.  In any case, much of this information is needed to manage and access memory, and so it can't itself be swapped out to disk!\nTo understand why, imagine an enormous library.  Think of, for example, the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford, which has eleven million printed items.  There's no way you could possibly fit all that stuff into a single building—certainly not one in the middle of a university campus.\nSo instead, imagine that the librarians construct a vast warehouse.  (The real Bodleian Library has about forty sub-libraries of various descriptions, plus storage for really rare books, but this is a thought experiment.)  Most of the books are kept in the warehouse, but anything that's been used recently is kept in the library.  If you show up at the library looking for a book, and it's in the stacks there, you can read it immediately.  If not, ask a librarian and the book you want will be transported from the warehouse and given to you the next day.\nThe information in wired memory, then, would be things like the card catalog, keys to the book delivery trucks, and maps of the route to the warehouse.  If you stored these things in the warehouse, you could never retrieve books to bring them back to the library—so they must be kept in the library at all times, lest the whole system break down.\nAnyway, getting back to practical considerations: wired memory is basically used by your computer for internal bookkeeping of various sorts.  You shouldn't worry about it.\nAnd don't worry if you have lots of \"inactive\" memory and little \"free\" memory, either.  Inactive memory is basically memory that Mac OS is keeping something in on the off chance it's needed again; if your system needs that memory for something else, it'll be converted to free memory without any performance hit.\nTo extend the library metaphor, imagine that the library keeps books that have been recently used in the stacks. The space is there in the stacks; there's no use leaving it empty, so you might as well keep the books you already have there.  There's no harm in it, and sometimes someone will be able to pick up a book immediately that he would otherwise have had to wait for.\nSimilarly, inactive memory can only speed things up; it can't hurt your computer, so don't worry about it being too high.\nReally, you shouldn't worry about your memory use unless wired + active starts getting close to the 8 GB in your computer.  That's when you could get into trouble, because that's when Mac OS will start consuming disk space to add \"extra\" memory, damaging performance considerably.\nOtherwise, you might as well have something in that memory.  Ultimately, unused memory is just a waste of power—if you have it, you might as well put it to use.\n\nA: Mac OS X is a modern OS, thus is uses virtual memory to make it appear to apps that memory space is no object. Most recently used apps will tend to be moved to RAM, less used apps will be moved to the hard disk (page ins and page outs are a sign of that movement). The OS will not use the hard drive until it runs out of space in RAM.\nThere is no specific app that will \"cause\" this wired memory to accumulate. The OS is managing every parts of itself and the apps you launched to make the best use of the RAM you have.\nQuitting unused apps, or better yet, restarting the computer will be the most efficient way to \"clean up\" the memory. FreeMemory does a good job, and am surprised the OS isn't doing such operation from time to time… it's nice to have a status on free memory though!\n\nA: Reading system memory usage in Activity Monitor\nfrom support.apple.com gives a detailed explanation about the different \"types\" of RAM.\n\n*\n\n*Free memory: This is RAM that's not being used.\n\n\n*Wired memory: Information in this memory can't be moved to the hard disk, so it must stay in RAM. The amount of Wired memory depends on the applications you are using.\n\n\n*Active memory: This information is currently in memory, and has been recently used.\n\n\n*Inactive memory: This information in memory is not actively being used, but was recently used.\n\n\n*Used: This is the total amount of memory used.\n\nA: 'Oh yeah, and wired memory turns out to be memory \"used by the OS [which] is pretty much untouchable. Another application can't 'borrow' wired memory'\nfrom tuaw http://www.tuaw.com/2007/03/06/just-what-is-wired-memory-anyway/\n\nA: For a definitive, although OS specific, answer, from Memory Usage Performance Guidelines:\n\nWired Memory\nWired memory (also called resident memory) stores kernel code and data structures that must never be paged out to disk. Applications, frameworks, and other user-level software cannot allocate wired memory. However, they can affect how much wired memory exists at any time. For example, an application that creates threads and ports implicitly allocates wired memory for the required kernel resources that are associated with them.\nTable 2 lists some of the wired-memory costs for application-generated entities\n\nAs you can see, every thread, process, and library contributes to the resident footprint of the system. In addition to your application using wired memory, however, the kernel itself requires wired memory for the following entities:\n\n*\n\n*VM objects\n\n*the virtual memory buffer cache\n\n*I/O buffer caches\n\n*drivers\n\nWired data structures are also associated with the physical page and\nmap tables used to store virtual-memory mapping information, Both of\nthese entities scale with the amount of available physical memory.\nConsequently, when you add memory to a system, the amount of wired\nmemory increases even if nothing else changes. When a computer is\nfirst booted into the Finder, with no other applications running,\nwired memory can consume approximately 14 megabytes of a 64 megabyte\nsystem and 17 megabytes of a 128 megabyte system.\nWired memory pages are not immediately moved back to the free list\nwhen they become invalid. Instead they are “garbage collected” when\nthe free-page count falls below the threshold that triggers page out\nevents.\n\n\nA: Wired memory is any memory that can't be swapped for any reason, which includes most kernel allocations. The zprint terminal command will print a breakdown.\n\nA: virtual memory is basically free __ space used as an extension of ram\n", "Q: Is there a good way to control VLC media player on my MacBook from an iOS 5 iPhone?

On my iPad smart cover (It's one of the polyurethane ones) there seem to be some spots of what looks like grease, it could be some sort of food grease or skin oil. What would be the best way to clean the cover without damaging it? I was thinking just a damp paper towel would be best, but I want to see what would be best before I tried.\n\nA: I have found ironicly that using a Microfiber cloth does the job and also cleans the microfiber inside part of the cover. \nI find that when you use it as a stand the inside of the cover collects anything you are standing it on and will the put this dust/debris onto the screen when its closed. \nTo add to this looking at the Apple website on Smart covers, the microfiber lining is the same colour as the polyurethane, yet the actual product is grey (just like in the video on the same page). \n", "Q: How can I increase command line memory_limit for PHP with MAMP PRO? I've edited every single php.ini on my Mac (at least all the ones found by \"locate\") and still can't seem to increase the memory_limit directive for PHP.\nI'm using MAMP PRO and running PHP scripts in the terminal.\nHow to solve this?\n\nA: From http://drupal.org/node/66187  (drupal may be irrelevant for your needs, but their site had a good explanaton - wanted to source it for you, and give credit to them) \nBy default, MAMP has the memory limit that a script can use set at 8MB, which is the PHP default. Looking at PHP's php.ini-recommended file, this memory limit is normally set at 128MB. To adjust this amount, open the php.ini file in a text editor and change the following line (approximately on line 232):\nmemory_limit = 8M      ; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume (8MB)\nPHP.ini file locations:\n/Applications/MAMP/conf/php4/php.ini  \n/Applications/MAMP/conf/php5/php.ini   \nIn MAMP PRO, don't alter the file directly since it will be recreated at each server start. Please edit the appropriate template (menu File > Edit template > ...) instead.\nEven with larger PHP memory limits you can get timeout errors trying to import large Drupal databases into MySQL. These issues are discussed at length elsewhere with regards to the cache and views cache. Generally the solution is to empty the Drupal cache before importing/exporting databases to/from MySQL.\n\nA: For me, I did the following:\nEdit the /Applications/MAMP/conf/php5.4.4/php.ini\nand \nphp.ini.temp\n\nto be:\nmemory_limit = 128M      ; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume (8MB)\n\nThen in finder simply make the php.ini and php.ini.temp read only for all users. This way, MAMP cannot overwrite it with default files. Restart the server and check your phpinfo.\n\nA: Instead of guessing which php.ini you need to alter, run this command to locate the file:\nphp -r 'phpinfo();' | grep 'php.ini'\n\nEven though I use MAMP PRO, by default my command-line PHP commands are not executed using their copy of PHP. In my case it says the file is found at /etc/php.ini\nOnce you have located the file, follow the instructions on all of the other answers to bump the memory_limit setting:\nmemory_limit = 256M\n\n\nA: After messing around for a while a found something that worked for me:\n# backup original php.ini\nsudo mv /usr/bin/php /usr/bin/php.bkp\n\n# create a symlink from MAMP's php.ini in /usr/bin directory\n# (I use 5.2, change the path for 5.3)\nsudo ln -s /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.2.17/bin/php /usr/bin/php\n\nThere!\n\nA: Quick and dirty way to do this is to set it as argument when calling your script.\nIe:\nphp -d memory_limit=512M myScript.php \n\n\nA: if you use Homebrew, your php settings are at /usr/local/etc/php/<php version>\n\nA: If you have Opcache on in Mamp Pro it will not you get the proper setting... stop it, restart your Mamp Pro server...  \n", "Q: What are good travel game apps for iPad to entertain a 2-3 year old My wife is to face a 2h flight with our very active daughter and would like to prepare some distractions.\nSpecifically we are looking for very simple, entertaining games a toddler can handle.

Is it possible to add an additional HDD or a SSD to a 2011 mac-mini (no the server edition) in addition to the 500GB HDD that comes with the computer? \nIf so, are additional parts required? Are these parts readily available? \n\nA: You can install any drive, provided it's of the 2.5\" variety (notebook disk).\niFixit has a kit you can purchase (see image below), or you can readily just buy the flex cable (PART# 922-9560). I purchased mine from PowerbookMedic for $29.95 and a few dollars shipping/handling. The iFixit kit includes the logic board puller, but I used two small screw drivers, which work just the same. If you have no qualms about spending the extra dough for what is likely a one-time affair, then by all means.\n\nDo note that you can pick the grommets from Home Depot (they are 1/4\" grommets) on the cheap. I had to shave a bit off to make them thinner, but they work beautifully. The screws are standard  \"headless screws\". 8mm M3 with a 0.5mm thread. The ones provided in the iFixit kit are not OEM, but just aftermarket screws that meet the dimensions. In any case, the grommets and screws are not entirely necessary as the limited room stops the drive from thrashing around. And since the unit is likely to stay stationary, not a large concern. It depends entirely on the level of craftsmanship you possess.\nMacrumors has a thread outlining the process, and that can be supplemented with iFixit's own guide.\nOne thing to note, after you've installed the drive, reset the PRAM/NVRAM to ensure a problem free experience. I had data on my secondary drive and saw my boot sequence lengthened to minutes as a result. Resetting the unit's PRAM did the trick.\nThe entire process took me about 1 hour, but it all depends on your level of proficiency.\nWhile adding the second drive is possible without removing the logic board, you will not be able to align the screws with the chassis (and will crush the grommets in doing so). You'll also wrestle 3x as long trying to get the SATA cable connected. There is literally not a mm to spare inside the unit. If you want to do the job right, you will need to take the mini apart and systematically install the drives one at a time so the holding screws line up with the grommets, the rest is a cakewalk.\n\nA: Sure. iFixIt has a guide for that.\nhttp://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Installing-Mac-Mini-Mid-2011-Dual-Hard-Drive-Kit/6634/1\n", "Q: How do I select the right iPhone carrier I have seen a lot of people asking about what carrier to use and what features they have. \nAlso people have asked about Visual Voicemail, which confusingly is not available on some networks, although Apple highlight it as one of the iPhone features, without mentioning it is not available to all carriers.

If there are any workarounds other than rebooting, this would be a good place to collect them. This has previously been closed and re-opened due to demand.\n\nCutting and copying do not always seem to change the content of the clipboard, whether triggered from a keyboard shortcut, a menu option, or even drag and drop. At the least this results in sometimes praying the wrong information, at worst it results in cut randomly acting like a delete key. The behavior as I have observed started out as staying to randomly occur and then consistently happen until the system is rebooted, for all programs including finder and the terminal.now it seems to stay randomly and then intermittently but at a high frequency occur, again regardless of program.\nSearching on google produces no useful results for this issue.\n\nCopied from Drag & drop and cut & paste not working [closed] so that others may find this question in search\n\nPossible Duplicate:\nCan anyone explain this clipboard behaviour? \n\n\nThis is weird.

And it's not just the shortcut: if I try\n  to right click and select \"Copy\" it doesn't work either. \nThis has happened three times so far. A reboot fixes it, but it's\n  annoying at best. Any solution?\n\n\nDoes anyone know of any way to fix this, or otherwise how to report this to Apple?\n@bmike I have removed other questions, I had this issue on a series of Macs, both iMacs and unibody MBPs, under OSX 10.7 and 10.8. I no longer use OSX so can't really contribute any more to this question.\n\nA: Apple appears to have introduced a bug into this particular point in their frameworks, I do also experience this bug often after having relaunched certain applications.  The reason copy/paste and drag and drop stop working at the same time is because they are both a function of the NSPasteboard API.\nIf you go to the finder under Edit>Show Clipboard, and the contents is none even after having copied something then the component of the OS responsible for handeling pasteboard events has crashed.  This is beyond your control, a work arround may exist by manually reloading the required component using launched, however the simplest solution is to save what you're doing reboot.\n\nA: Based on this post, the following worked for me.\nCheck if the pboard daemon is running:\nlaunchctl list | grep com.apple.pboard\n\nIf the pboard daemon is running, then stop and start it.  If it's not running, start it:\nlaunchctl stop com.apple.pboard\nlaunchctl start com.apple.pboard\n\nThen, you may need to restart the application(s) where cut-and-paste is not working.  \n\nA: Al, several things.\n\n\n*\n\n*what version of Lion are you using:\n\n\nApple Menu > About this mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*Have you checked for software updates?\n\n\nSystem Preferences > Software Update.\n\n\n*\n\n*Have you repaired permissions?\n\n\nFinder > Applications > Utilities > Disk Utility.\n(These are basic troubleshooting steps for any mac issue by the way).\nThen, when you think something hasn't been captured by the copy command, could you open TextEdit (Applications > TextEdit), and paste to there... \nFinally, if something is funky, it often helps to create a test user account (System Preferences > Users and Groups), and see if the behavior repeats there.

When using Terminal.app, you can clear the screen by using the shell builtin clear or by pressing ^+L (Control-L). \nHowever, all this does is push the current screen content back one screen height and reset the cursor/input at the first line. Meaning you can still scroll back and see it.\nWhat you are also able to do, is reset your entire scrollback by pressing ⌘+K (Command-K). \nAfter you've done this, you cannot scroll back at all.\nIn certain situations (notably, before running screen or vim), I'd like to reset the scroll back before the command actually executes.\nIs there a command (like clear) that is implemented in OS X that allows me to do this? Given the existence of pbcopy and pbpaste, I'm thinking something similar might exist that will allow me to do this.\n\nA: Terminal supports an extension of the ED (Erase in Display) escape sequence to erase the scroll-back. It is also supported by xterm. The ED command, described in the VT100 manual, accepts these values for the Ps parameter:\n\nESC [ Ps J\n\nParameter   Parameter Meaning\n\n0           Erase from the active position to the end of the screen\n1           Erase from start of the screen to the active position\n2           Erase all of the display\n\nTerminal (and xterm) adds:\n\n3           Erase the scroll-back (aka “Saved Lines”)\n\nNote that this only erases the scroll-back, not the screen. This allows you to erase one or the other, or both by sending two escape sequences.\nFor example, you can clear the screen and the scroll-back with the following shell command: clear && printf '\\e[3J'\n(The clear command looks up the appropriate sequence for clearing the screen for the current terminal, but the “erase scroll-back” escape sequence is custom and must be hard-coded. If you put this in a shell script that you don’t know for certain will only ever be run with Terminal, you should check that $TERM_PROGRAM is Apple_Terminal before sending it.)\n\nA: ⌘K, shortcut to “View > Clear scrollback”.\nUPDATE: This can be automated with AppleScript by the following command:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"k\" using command down'\n\n…which you can of course alias to whatever you want, or store in a function in your ~/.profile login script  :)\nAs a security though, to be able to use this even in background without risking to issue a keystroke to a wrong front app, I'd advise surrounding it with the following test:\nif application \"Terminal\" is frontmost\n\n…which gives us the following code:\nosascript -e 'if application \"Terminal\" is frontmost then tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"k\" using command down'\n\n…which in turns, properly escaped and aliased, ends in:\nalias clear=\"osascript -e 'if application \\\"Terminal\\\" is frontmost then tell application \\\"System Events\\\" to keystroke \\\"k\\\" using command down'\"\n\nAnd here is your new clear!  :)\n\nA: Here's code that works for both macOS' Terminal, and iTerm2. It doesn't need the window to be in the foreground (unlike some AppleScript solutions), either.\nprintf '\\e[2J\\e[3J\\e[H'\n\nHow it works\nThis uses a series of ANSI escape sequences. Each ANSI escape sequence starts with the \"ESC\" (escape) character, it's a non-printable ASCII character (meaning it has no visual glyph representation like 1 or a). printf can print an this character using \\e (or by its octal value \\033, or its hex value \\x1B).\nOne kind of ANSI escape sequence are the \"Control Sequence Introducer\" commands. They all start with the form ESC CSI, where ESC is the escape character just mentioned, and CSI is the value [ (or 0x5B in hex)\nI use the \\e[ representation, because it's shorter than \\x1B\\x5B, and easier to read.\nAs we can see, there are two ANSII escape sequences here, each of which are the \"control sequence introducer\" form, called with different arguments. Knowing this, we can split up the string into its 3 parts:\n\n*\n\n*\\e[2J\n\n*\n\n*The start of an escape sequence (\\e), containing a control sequence ([) with argument 2J\n\n\n*This is an instance of the \"ED – Erase in Display\" command, which has the form CSI n J\n\n\n*The n value is set to 2 in this case, which invokes the second variant:\n\nIf n is 2, clear entire screen (and moves cursor to upper left on DOS ANSI.SYS).\n\n\n\n\n\n*\\e[3J\n\n*\n\n*The start of an escape sequence (\\e), containing a control sequence ([) with argument 3J\n\n\n*This is an instance of the \"ED – Erase in Display\" command, which has the form CSI n J\n\n\n*The n value is set to 3 in this case, which invokes the third variant:\n\nIf n is 3, clear entire screen and delete all lines saved in the scrollback buffer (this feature was added for xterm and is supported by other terminal applications).\"\n\n\n\n*Despite the description on Wikipedia, it appears that this isn't actually clearing the screen in iTerm and the default Terminal, only the scrollback buffer was cleared. Hence the need for the \\e[2J command above.\n\n\n\n\n*\\e[H:\n\n*\n\n*The start of an escape sequence (\\e), containing a control sequence ([) with argument H.\n\n\n*This is an instance of the \"CUP - Cursor Position\" command, which has the form CSI n ; m H,\n\nMoves the cursor to row n, column m. The values are 1-based, and default to 1 (top left corner) if omitted. A sequence such as CSI ;5H is a synonym for CSI 1;5H as well as CSI 17;H is the same as CSI 17H and CSI 17;1H\n\n\n\n*This could have been more explicitly written as \\e[1;1H\nFun fact\nThese control sequences are actually how the built-in clear (/usr/bin/clear) command works. All it seems to do is product some output, which we can inspect with xxd:\n$ clear | xxd\n00000000: 1b5b 481b 5b32 4a                        .[H.[2J\n\nWe can re-create the same output with printf '\\e[H \\e2J':\n$ printf '\\e[H \\e2J' | xxd\n00000000: 1b5b 4820 1b32 4a                        .[H .2J\n\nNotice they don't use \\e3J, hence why clear only clears the screen, but not the scrollback.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this works on OS X but for Linux the best option seems to be tput reset.\n", "Q: iPhone: Is it possible to gift paid app to another user?

I plan on purchasing 3 iPod Touches and I have an iPhone 4s and an iPad 1.  Can these devices all participate in Home Sharing from iTunes (on Windows) in an ad-hoc wifi network?\nI have a test here with my iPhone 4s connected to an ad-hoc wifi network from my Windows machine (only several feet away from computer, certainly within the ad-hoc 30 ft. radius recommendation).  iTunes appears to recognize the iPhone on the network as it does sync the phone, but sharing is enables on the very same itunes account.  Problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*The \"Shared\" option appears at most 25% of any given time,\n\n*When it does work, I am only able to see playlists (is this expected?),\n\n*In any given playlist for music (all songs purchased via itunes) only about 10% of them play, the remainder are skipped by iphone.\n\n*Those items that will list to be played (e.g. some video podcasts) will return with a dialog box of \"Cannot Open\".\n\n\nShall I assume these sporadic (though apparently consistent) problems are the result of an ad-hoc wifi network vs. a \"real\" wifi router network?\n\nA: Yes - you need to be connected to the internet when you first enable Home Sharing, but once each device has a SSL cert or whatever is stored internally, the devices will find each other and share as long as the local network is allowing the mDNS / Bonjour traffic so the devices can discover each other and match keys stored internally to identify which account is enabled for sharing.\n", "Q: I want to hear sound of push notification when sound is turned off (like iOS alarm clock) When I receive a push notification no sound is played when the sound is switched of on the device (with switch on side of iPhone). \nWhen I add an alarm event in the iOS clock I do hear the sound although sound is switched off.\nCan I force to play sound with Push notifications when sound is switched off?\n\neverybody thanks for the response (this was a programming question)\nwith regards,\nFrank\nPS I don't know what is meant by fixing up my accept rate but I'll have a look into that...\n\nA: You can't, the push notification is handled by the iOS.

The MP3 and AAC codecs have advanced compression schemes designed specifically for audio.  You'll find that doing additional layers of compression on these types of files will make very little difference in disk space usage and will probably not make it worth your trouble.\nEDIT: Sorry I got confused.

So I'm wondering if I can gift things in the iTunes store if I'm in a different country than the recipient.  If I gift something from the UK store, can someone in the US download the items?  I'm not even sure if there's a way for me to go to the US version, let alone try to gift an item from there.\n\nA: According to Apple support, from the U.S., you can gift physical goods to: \n\nMexico, 15 countries in Europe, and four countries in Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand).\n\nThose 15 European countries are: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom. Anywhere else and it seems you need a credit card with a billing address in the target country to send gifts.\nHowever, this does NOT apply to gifting apps:\n\n[iTunes] Gift Cards and Certificates are valid for use only in the country in which they were purchased. Only residents of the U.S may redeem gift certificates purchased in the U.S.\n\n\nA: You can't. \nFrom the Apple's iTunes: Sending iTunes Gifts page:\n\nYou can't redeem purchased gifts outside of the country of purchase. For example, an iTunes Gift purchased in France can't be redeemed in an iTunes Store outside of France.\n\nApple haven't yet worked out that people move around the world, and have friends and family in different countries. To give the benefit of the doubt to Apple, perhaps it's to do with tax and legal frameworks, but then how come I can transfer thousands of pounds from a bank account in one country to a bank account in another, yet can't transfer a few quid between two iTunes accounts in different countries?\nBut then \"iTunes\" and \"easy and convenient\" are at opposite ends of the spectrum.\n\nA: a work around is to visit an online store such as amazon.com and buy them on that site for delivery to the USA address. This way you are buying the product in the USA for someone in the USA.\nThere is no confusion over who it is for or where it can be redeemed.\n\nA: Hi I just went trough the same issue when preparing for the 2014 holiday season.\nExcept for few exceptions, you cannot send iTunes gift to accounts in other countries. More specifically, you can send the gift but the people will not be able to redeem them. They end up stuck with a useless email.\nWhat you can do is send iTunes gift cards. These can be sent electronically and can be purchased for one country's specific store, in your case USA, from another country. You can purchase the codes from Apple, but in my case it was more convenient to buy them from eBay, since it allowed me to pay with a non-US credit card.\n\nA: Yes - just go to Country specific iTunes site and purchase the gift card as Guest (don't  checkout via your iTunes account.) \nFor example, I live in the US and I want to purchase an Ireland iTunes gift card in euros for my cousin who lives in Dublin. I would go to www.apple.com, go to the bottom right corner of the website, and select \"Ireland\" as my country. Then proceed to purchase the gift card and follow instructions to check out. If you use an email address the same as your iTunes account, it'll ask you if you want to sign in. Don't log in. Just select the option to check out as Guest. This will allow you to purchase an iTunes gift card for a different country.\n\nA: Amazon seems the best way to go. You can't workaround it and make a fake account in the USA unless you use a credit card from the USA. I was wondering this also since I'm in Canada trying to send a gift to the USA  or China but I guess I'll just try to find another online gift to send.  \n", "Q: Why is my iPhone playing the notification sound but no notification is showing? A few minutes ago I was listening to music on my iPhone and the music faded out and then the notification sound played but no notifcation showed. (it has done this about 10-15 times now) Does anyone know what could possibly be wrong with my iPhone? I have an iPhone 3GS running on iOS 5.0.1.\nSometimes it's an email sound but other times it's the actual notification sound. I have it set up to show the little notification at the top for new emails so it should show a notifcation even when the email sound plays. Most of the time it shows a notification but sometimes it doesn't. \nMaybe this is just a bug? \n\nA: Check if you have the new Gmail app installed.  Every time it gets a new email, it triggers the \"iphone Text Message sound\".  The sound can be disabled via Settings app > Notifications > Gmail > uncheck Sound.\n", "Q: How can I install Snow Leopard on a new iMac or install FCP6 on Lion? I'm in a situation where I purchased a new iMac and need to install my editing software (Final Cut Pro and After Effects).  Only thing is I have FCP 6 (Studio 2) and also FCP 7 (Studio 2) upgrade install DVDs and Lion won't install FCP 6 because it containts PPC code.\nI'd like to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*install Snow Leopard on this computer, but I'm not sure if I need certain firmware drivers (anyone know where to get them and create a brand new Snow Leopard install DVD?) \n\n*or, at the very least, I would like to be able to install my video software on Lion.\n\n\nA: The problem is that new iMacs probably don't support Snow Leopard. Perhaps upgrading a Snow Leopard installation with all the apps you need already on it could work.\nWell, I see 1 possibility: install Snow Leopard on an external HD (using a computer that supports Snow Leopard) with all the latest Apple updates, then install FCP. Once that's done, use Disk Utility or Carbon Copy Cloner to clone this external HD onto your iMac, then see first if it's starts and behaves correctly, then try the upgrade to Lion.\nThis is the jist of it, but if you need more instructions, let me know.\n\nA: You should only need to install Rosetta from a Snow Leopard Disk.\nDo you have a Snow Leopard DVD install disk?\nRun that, go to optional installs and install only Rosetta, reboot.\nNow, you should be able to run the FCP 6 installer.\n\nA: The best solution would be to install Snow Leopard on a different computer. Install FCP6, then move the drive to your mac and do the upgrade.\nAnother solution would be to use Snow Leopard on a different Mac or on a virtual machine. Install FCP6, do a time machine save. Then restore applications from the time machine save on your mac (using the migration assistant).\n", "Q: Lion Server DHCP randomly loses settings and reverts to defaults I’ve been trying to set up Lion Server on a Mac Pro with it acting as the router/gateway/firewall/DNS/NAT and DHCP. I’ve been trying to setup an internal-only network named mycompany.something. After having a lot of problems with that I switched to using mycompany.private (as recommended in Mac OS X Lion Server for Dummies).\nWhen I was using mycompany.private and I turned on DHCP for the 192.168.2.x side of things it would distribute addresses and machines behind the server could get to the outside world.\nI then noticed that every time I went back to the DHCP settings Subnets panel in Server Admin the subnets were either gone or different.\nLooking at the logs it became apparent that the DHCP server was basically losing the settings file (which I assume is created/altered via Server Admin) and was putting a default one in its place.\nAny idea what causes this to happen and how I can cajole the DHCP server into retaining my settings?\n\nA: Just shooting a few ideas here: a router on your network that has a DHCP server activated. Permissions on the settings files are wrong. Deleting all settings and prefs and starting from scratch. Make sure the OS is up-to-date.\nAnd you say the logs only show that the settings files disappeared? Nothing else?\n\nA: There have traditionally been issues with using Mac OS X Server and internet sharing on the same machine. The situation has improved with recent release of both the OS & Mac OS X Server. On Lion, the best I can suggest is to set things up in internet sharing, then never open the internet sharing settings in the preference pane again (this is what usually causes the config file to be overwritten). And do your DHCP & DNS management from the Server app. \nThe safest thing to do is use a dedicated hardware router instead of the Mac Pro, for the gateway.\n", "Q: Verify a CD/DVD from ISO Is there a tool (preferably free) in OS X that will allow me to verify that an ISO was written to a CD or DVD correctly? I want a tool that can do that without going through the burn first.\nIf there's a tool that can be used from the command line, that's fine too.\n\nA: You have two choices that I can see if you don't want to re-burn and re-verify.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the ISO and the DVD and do a recursive diff of the two file systems. For example, if the DVD is /Volumes/DVD and the ISO is /Volumes/ISO then:\ndiff --recursive /Volumes/DVD /Volumes/ISO\n\n*Compare the MD5 sums of all the data on the two images. So:\nmd5 original.iso\ndd if=/dev/disk1 bs=2048 count=169383 | md5\nI'd take option #2 over #1 personally, though both are less than great ways to do a comparison.\nYou could also try exploiting rsync to do the comparison instead of using diff. If you ran rsync with the --checksum, --recursive and --dry-run options what you'd get back is a list of transfers that rsync thinks it needs to make to make the two file trees look the same.\n", "Q: How can I regularly move movies in iTunes to an external drive? I have been adding a lot of movies to iTunes lately. Problem is, the size grows very quickly. I appreciate having the metadata in one place, but I would want to move the actual files to an external drive. Preferably, I'd be able to have unwatched movies on the main drive and move them to external drive once they have been watched. The link to iTunes must be kept, and metadata kept, as is.\nI have my folders organized by iTunes, and I know the trick to \"Hold Command and Option keys and drag the file(s) to the main iTunes window\". For this case however, I want to add movies as normal and just change the internal pointer to an external drive, probably through a script. Anyone know if it's possible or any other workarounds (e.g. symlinks).\n\nA: If your external drive is permanently connected to your Mac I suggest cutting and pasting your entire iTunes library (called \"iTunes Media\") over to the external drive, and then point iTunes to it through Preferences > Advanced > iTunes Media folder location. Now all your data would be stored on that external drive, while still easily accessible via iTunes.\n", "Q: Script that Automatically Does Something Every Day I'm looking for a way to automatically run a shell script or command every time interval. I'm running a server and I want to backup some folders every day. I don't want to use time machine because the backups need to be just the raw data.\nHow do I write a daemon/application/script that will do this? The commands I need to run are pretty simple, and theres more than one I need, so it'd be great if there was a semi-generalized way to do this.\n\nA: On Macs running 10.5 or earlier, I'll use crontab. \nOn Macs running 10.6 and newer, I'll use launchd.

Is there a command that can tell the label status (labels as applied in the info menu in the finder cmd+i) of an item from the command-line in OS X? Essentially, I just want to list all the items with or without labels in the current directory, but I can't find any way to pull them appart.\nThis will help in creating a timed script that runs in the background. Then I can apply a label in finder and expect an action automatically apply to that file without having to make special conditions or keep a curated file with a list.\n\nA: Using ls, you can show the extended metadata of files:\n$ ls -l@\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 andrew  staff  1292910 Aug  9 11:36 labelled_file.jpg\n    com.apple.metadata:kMDLabel_hlsi7t7nerhynemqvydgeb26de       50 \n\nHowever, the quickest way to get labelled and unlabelled files is with an attribute search using mdfind:\n$ mdfind -onlyin . -literal 'kMDItemFSLabel > 0'  # labels have value 50\n/cwd/labelled_file.jpg\n\n$ mdfind -onlyin . -literal 'kMDItemFSLabel == 0'\n/cwd/all.jpg\n/cwd/other.jpg\n/cwd/files.jpg\n\n\nA: You can use\nxattr -p com.apple.FinderInfo filename\n\nbut you will need some work to process the output.

LibreOffice for mac - by default - starts with a welcome screen. While this might be useful to some, it also results in resume not working in Lion (I assume). No previous documents are being opened. Can I deactivate this welcome screen?\nThank you for any help!\n\nA: There is no known setting to disable this dialog.\nThe \"welcome screen\" serves as a dispatcher to the different parts of LibreOffice (such as the word processor or spreadsheet). Because these applications cannot be accessed directly (they lack stand-alone binaries), the welcome screen is in fact quite functional when not launching LibreOffice from an existing document. Disabling it would not make much sense from a useability point a view, therefore I am not really surprised there is no setting to change this behavior.\n", "Q: How do I insert radio buttons in Numbers for iPad? I need to insert radio buttons on a Numbers spreadsheet. I tried importing an Excel document with form radio buttons, but it did not pull through. Advice would be appreciated.\n\nA: You can instead radio buttons by double tapping the cell you wish to enter one and then under either the '42' or '=' option you can select true/false. When you check this it will add a radio button or tick box, you can choose which one under the 'i' \nI have done this on my iPad so will edit later when I can upload a screen shot.\n", "Q: iOS: Newly added contacts get hidden and don't sync to iCloud I was facing the issue outlined on this Apple discussion thread, where I had duplicates of every contact on my iPhone -- one in iCloud, and one \"Unknown\". The thread presents a working solution on how to remove all \"Unknown\" contacts. \nHowever, when I add a new contact without using the + button, it still goes into an \"Unknown\" list. Does anyone else experience this? To replicate this, try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a new contact, say an unknown number from your recent calls list, or from an email. 1.

I can send files using the built-in Bluetooth File Exchange on OSX Lion just fine, except it requires me to put my phone in a discoverable state. However, since this is an Android phone, it stops being discoverable after 120 seconds. In addition, I have a nice Bluetooth toggle on my home screen but I can't get one for BT and discoverable.\nThe Phone is paired with my MacBook, so I was wondering if somehow I could bypass the discoverable requirement for previously paired bluetooth devices.\n\nA: Normally, yes. Click the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar, your phone should be listed in the “Devices” category. From there, you can toggle actions on it.\n", "Q: Why does Microsoft Word need to allow incoming network connections? When I turn on the Mac firewall I get prompted to allow the MS office apps (Word, Excel, Powerpoint) to accept incoming connections. Why is this, and is it safe to allow it ?\nI'm running Mac OS 10.7.2\n\nA: I can't speak for Office 2011 because it requires you to activate your serial number with Microsoft, but in Office 2008, Office 2004 and Offive v.X, the incoming network connection is part of Microsoft's anti-piracy efforts.  Since each copy of Office is activated with a unique product key, Office products open an incoming network connection and listen for connections from other instances of Microsoft Office on the network.  When connections are established, the two instances of Office will trade product keys and make sure they are not the same.  If they are the same, then one user is forced to close their copy of Office.\nI recommend instructing your firewall NOT to allow Office to accept inbound network connections.\nHere's a link to Macworld that speaks about this 'feature':\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20020406142423494\n\nA: I was plagued mercilessly by this problem with all Microsoft Office 2008 applications on several fresh installs of Mavericks and Yosemite.  Here is how I finally got it to go away. Hope it helps some of you:\n\n\n*\n\n*close the affected apps\n\n*delete any firewall settings for that app\n\n*delete all .plist files and other preferences found in /Library/Preferences, /Library/Caches, ~/Library/Preferences, and ~/Library/Caches (in my case this included all files in preferences folders named com.microsoft.*.plist and all subfolders in those folders bearing the name Microsoft). Don't worry; properly coded apps will restore their own plist files.\n\n*launch each app again and choose \"deny\" (or \"allow\", according to your preference) in the dialogue about incoming connections\n\n*closing the app, and opening again to verify that the firewall setting had been remembered.\n\n\nNote that I also had previously forced a re-signing of the apps using ad-hoc code signing in a terminal window:\n sudo codesign --force --sign - <full path to application>\n\nFor example:\n sudo codesign --force --sign - /Applications/Microsoft\\ Office\\ 2008/Microsoft\\ Excel.app\n\nI am not sure whether or not the re-signing step helped the system remember the settings.  You can read about code signing here:\nhttp://forums.macnn.com/79/developer-center/355720/how-re-sign-apples-applications-once/\n\nA: This problem still exists more than 4 years after it was first reported.   I am running Office for Mac 2011 under Mac OS 10.10.5.  I get the annoying message asking me \"Do you want the application “Office365Service.app” to accept incoming network connections?\"  Of course I have nothing to do with anything concerning Office 360.  So I deny it, but it comes back up 10 or 180 minutes later, or a day later if I'm lucky.\nI have called Microsoft.  They claim it is because a .plist file has become corrupted.  Sure enough, when I deleted one or more of these files, the problem went away ... for a month or two.   Then it recurred.  Now I forget where the offending file(s) was(were).  \nMy take on this:  it is a bug that Microsoft refuses to acknowledge or fix.\n\nA: I would add, that a lot of the Ms-Office documentation is online. It might has something to do with that. \n", "Q: Where and how can I upgrade my ipod 1st gen? How can I upgrade my ipod from version 1.1.5 (4B1), to a iOS5 on a 8gb pod??

However, when the message disappears there is a new track but no music. \nI checked the whole track to make sure it wasn't sitting at either end and I couldn't see it but alas that shed no light as to where the 'imported' track had vanished to.  \nI've attached an image - although I'm not really sure how much use it's going to be. \nFacts:\nRunning Mac OS X 10.7.2, Garageband '11 v 6.0\n\n\nA: Usually, we can easily import MP3 files to GarageBand (especially GarageBand 11)\nHowever, sometimes the import process will encounter difficulty in importing an MP3 into GarageBand in two situations:\nSituation 1: GarageBand only imports MP3 files which have the extension in lower case: \".mp3\". If you try to import MP3 files (like MP3 recorded from the Olympus LS-10) with the extension in upper case: \".MP3\", GarageBand will refuse to import those kinds of MP3 audio.\nIn this case, change the MP3 file extension to lower case in order to import MP3 to GarageBand.\nSituation 2: GarageBand only supports those MP3 audio files which have a sample rate of 44.1 kilohertz (kHz) and a bit depth of 16 bits.\nIn this case, it will be necessary to convert the MP3 file(s) to GarageBand's more compatible AIFF file format.\nThe following link provides instructions for two methods to convert an MP3 file to a AIFF file at: How to Convert and Import MP3 to GarageBand?\n\nA: It does this when your project has become too full. Try deleting tracks out of your project and then drag the audio file back into Garage Band and it should turn up blue.\n\nA: I had the same problem!

This device isn't eligible for the latest build.\"\nHelp...\n\nA: It won't be possible to updated to iOS 4.3 unless you have a software image for iOS 4.3 handy.  This is because Apple wants to force you to install the latest version which is iOS 5.0.  The test app you have been sent should still run on iOS 5.0 though.\nSince iTunes isn't being nice about letting you upgrade, what you can do is go download the iOS 5.0 software image from Apple and then you can force iTunes to update using the image.

Recently, my iPad 2 was stolen. It was protected by a lock screen passcode.\nCan the person who stole it access my data even if they don't know the passcode?\nIf I understand correctly, the only possibility is to restore a previous backup, so I guess the thief is out of luck. Is this correct?\n\nA: Sadly yes, the thief can access your data. All bets are off when they have physical access to your device.\nThe easiest way for the less scrupulous to gain access to your data is to back up the device through their iTunes via a traditional sync. Once done, they can access that back up with a variety of third party utilities, like iPhone Backup Extractor. They can gain access to your entire profile's contents, like you Address Book entries, pictures, and even your messages.\nThe process is outline here. This particular place talks of restoring it to another device, but with programs like iPhone Backup Extractor, that is not necessary, as you can pull the data right from the backup.\nIf you've got access to iCloud, I would strongly suggest a remote wipe of the device. Failing that, pray the thief isn't concerned with your data and just wants the lucrative device for their own use (which is usually the case).\n\nA: I stand corrected by first answer, but just to add to it.\nApple does not have any support for stolen products. It does list what you can do here\nIf you have MobileMe or iClound \"Find my iPhone\" you will be able locate it (providing it is 3G or connected to WiFi. You can also remote wipe the iPad and send messages to the iPad.\n\nA: Sorry to hear about your loss. The following should bring some peace of mind.\nExcerpts from Apple http://images.apple.com/ipad/business/pdf/iPad_Security_Overview.pdf\n\n\n*\n\n*iPad offers 256-bit AES encoding hardware-based encryption to protect\nall data on the device. Encryption is always enabled and cannot be\ndisabled by users\n\n*Devices can also be configured to automatically initiate a local wipe\nafter several failed passcode attempts. This is a key deterrent\nagainst brute force attempts to gain access to the device.

This will ensure that everything that has to be in /Developer is there.\n", "Q: Removing modem icon from menubar I had borrowed a USB modem which I used briefly with my Snow Leopard MacBook, and while setting it I had told System Preferences to show modem status in menubar. Now I have removed the modem services, but after doing so I have realized that I cannot remove the modem icon from menubar anymore. Is there a way to do so, short of finding and reinstalling (and uninstalling) another modem?\n\nA: Hold ⌘ and drag it out of the menubar. Also, in the networking system preference, you can often find a show icon in the menu bar preference. I can't recall if this checkbox is easily shown when the hardware is no longer present, but it's an alternative to dragging the icon out directly in some cases.\n", "Q: Problems with Parallels and backing up with Time Machine I use Macbook Air and Lion. I use Time Machine to back up on my Drobo FS. All seems to be ok until I use Parallels. The Time Machine seems to take my virtual machine as one file so every time I open it Time machine wants to back up the WHOLE virtual machine although I maybe have changed only a word in a file. This leads to huge back ups of 20-30 G. Is there anything I can do about this unnecessary backup? Or is there any way I can tell the Time Machine not to back up my Windows files? Can I use tmutil and in that case how?\nCamilla\n\nA: Parallels have instructions here for making their software (version 6 or later) work better with Time Machine. You can either optimise your VMs for Time Machine backup, or disable backup for them.\n\nParallels Desktop for Mac includes improved integration with Time Machine. \n  When backing up the virtual machine, it will only backup the recent changes (the latest snapshot), but not the whole virtual hard drive.\n  Thus, the backup process will take less time and use less space on your Time Machine storage device.\nTo enable improved integration with Time Machine, please go to Virtual Machine Configuration, choose Options and hit Backup.\nSelect \"Optimize for Time Machine\" in SmartGuard menu.\nIf you do not want your virtual machine to be backed up by Time Machine, you need go to Virtual Machine Configuration --> Options --> Backup and put a checkmark on “Do not back up with Time Machine”.\n\n\nIn Parallels 7 the control panel looks like this:\n\nNote that when you enable this feature, it will take up more space on the disk.

The concerned files and folders also seem hidden from Spotlight and therefore do not show up in searches. Both issues are seriously problematic for everyday use.\nThis is what ls -l gives me for folders:\ndrwxr-xr-x  109 fr  staff  3706 Nov 22 14:43 Notes\ndrwxr-xr-x+  16 fr  staff   544 Nov 22 14:51 Bibliography\n\nWhile the Notes folder is showing fine in searches and allows for password-free renaming, the Bibliography folder does not. My understanding is that the + sign indicates what is wrong here.\nEdit: tentative solution below, by removing all ACLs.\n\nA: Here's the tentative solution I have found to my own problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*print initial state: ls -l\n\n*remove ACL permissions: chmod -R -N /Users/fr/\n\n*equalize all permissions: chmod -R 755 /Users/fr/\n\n*rebuild Spotlight index: sudo mdutil -E /\n\n*print new state: ls -l\nThe -N option, which is well hidden in the man chmod documentation but mentioned here, removes the + sign that indicate ACLs, just like @ indicates a hidden file extension or a custom icon (as far as I can tell). Using Repair Utilities on ACLs should have done that but did not.\nBy using chmod with the 755 mode, I lost all custom permissions in the process, but did not need any. Rebuilding the Spotlight index then guarantees that all files get properly indexed. That solution worked, through without explaining how the initial problem emerged.\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, you're attempting to reset the permissions on a user's home directory. This is easily accomplished by resetting ACLs on the desired home directly by using the Reset Password Utility in the Recovery Partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your computer from the recovery partition (if running Lion) or the gray disk (if not running Lion). \n\n*Open Disk Utility and run a permissions repair on your startup volume. After this is complete, close Disk Utility. We're doing this just for good measure.\n\n*Open Terminal from the Utilities menu. Type in resetpassword and select your user account (NOT System Administrator/root) from the drop down menu. \n\n*Click the Reset button at the bottom of the window in the Reset home folder permissions and ACLs section. \n\n*Quit the Password Utility and go back to the main recovery screen. \n\n*On your keyboard, hit ⌘ + Q and restart your computer. It's very important that you don't hold down the power button to exit the recovery session, or the ACL reset won't occur.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to switch off the GPS (but not disable location tracking) on an iPhone? Is there any way to switch off the GPS on an iPhone 4, so that the location tracker application can use GSM instead (this is only to save my battery)?\n\nA: It can't be done.  It really depends on the application that is requesting your location.  App Developers, when requesting the device's location, can choose how accurate of a location they need.  If they decide they need less accuracy, then iOS will only fire up WiFi or use GSM to determine the approximate location.  If the developer decides they need very specific location, then the phone will fire up the GPS.\n", "Q: Is it possible to purchase Lion, without using the Mac App Store *on* a Mac (ie. the app) This is a followup, but not a duplicate, of my first question:\n\nReinstalling a MacBook Pro w/Lion (10.7.2), when previous owner died, can it be done? What do I need?\n\nI have a MacBook Pro, that is going to be given to a new user. The original owner died, so unfortunately I don't have access to his email account, but, the MBP auto-logs on so I'm on the Mac already.\nThe MBP will be given to the son of the later father, and I have his Apple account details, so I thought I could log on to the Mac App Store with his account, purchase Lion, and then reinstall.\nHowever, in the Mac App Store, the \"purchase\" button just says \"Installed\", because of course Lion is installed on the machine already.\nSo I have a few questions in that regard:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I reinstall from the recovery partition already on the machine, use the new users Apple account, and then purchase in the Mac App Store afterwards? Or will the installation stop at some point because that account doesn't own Lion and thus won't activate on this machine?\n\n*Can I purchase Lion on the new account somewhere else, through Apple's web site?\n\n*Can I trick the Mac App Store to think Lion is not installed, so that I can purchase it? I remember that when I disabled the Spotlight search engine, the app store was a bit confused about what was installed and what was not...\n\n*Any other solution?\n\n\nA: This only answers on part of the question, you can buy a Lion USB install from the Apple Store although it is more expensive at £55.\nLink to USA store (at $69)\n", "Q: Unable to log in to open directory account I'm in the process of setting up my Mac Mini with Lion server. Everything appears to be working fine on the server, but I'm having problems logging into any open directory account that has a network share set as the home folder. If I change the users home folder to just a local folder, I can log in fine. I've confirmed my client is correctly connected to the directory server, because if I enter the password incorrectly, I get the password incorrect error.\nThe error I get when I attempt to log into the account is this, in a message box: \"You are unable to log into the user account \"testaccount\" at this time. Logging in to the account failed because an error occurred.\"\nI can't even log into \"testaccount\" locally from the server, I get the same error.\nIs there some step I'm missing?\n\nA: I happened to solve this, though perhaps not the \"right\" way. Changing the server to a local server with the address myserver.local instead of myserver.com fixed the issue with me. I then just use a dynamic DNS service to point my domain to my IP. Now everything works correctly and I can login on both the client and the server.\n", "Q: How to make DVD from iMovie Apple has decided to exclude iDVD from Lion, and I haven't found an easy way to make a DVD that can be played on my DVD player created in iMovie.\nI found this question\nHowever, there is no clear answer there.\nI dont have iDVD, and I cannot get it, but I still want to be able to create a DVD.\nDoes anyone know how this can be done?\n\nA: You can export your movie to a format of your wishes (.avi, .dv, ...) and then you can burn this on a disk with a suitable software suite (Roxio Toast or with the built in software of Lion/Mac OS)\nEDIT: for free, software, I would recommend you use Burn\n\nA: See if you can find a friend who actually bought the boxed set of iLife before Apple outmoded iDVD. If so, have them copy iDVD.app out of their applications folder and give it to you.\n\nA: DVD-Creator is well reviewed, similar to iDVD and $39.99 on the Mac App Store.\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dvd-creator/id428417852?mt=12\nI have no connection with this app or the manufacturer.\n\nA: Correction: iMovie '11 does NOT have a direct option to burn to DVD\nYou will either have to share via web or download a dvd encoding burning program.\nDisk utility is another way to burn dvd's, unfortunately it won't be in a format that is playable on a dvd player.  It would end up burning as a Data DVD\n-Hope this helps\n\nA: In iMovie '11 go to the Share menu and select Burn to DVD.\n", "Q: How do I manage locations for the Reminders iPhone app? I want to manage where my home, work etc is for the reminders app.\nWhere can I do that?\n\nA: Your home and work geo-location are picked up from your contacts card in the Contacts app (on iOS devices). To manage where your home or work is, edit the relevant addresses in the Contacts app, under 'add new address'.\n\nYou can also edit other peoples addresses, add shops, the gym, clubs, etc, and it will use this data.\n", "Q: Stop my old iPhone from backing up tl;dr How can I tell iTunes to not back up my old iPhone 3GS when I plug it into iTunes\nI have an iPhone 4S, and an old 3GS I'm using as an iPod touch.  I asked the salesperson at the apple store whether having my old iPhone backing up in iTunes would cause problems, since iTunes only stores one backup.  She said probably, and that I should set iTunes to stop backing up my old phone when I plug it in to sync.\na) Is this correct, that a backup of my old 3GS will overwrite my last backup of my new 4S?\nb) Is there a way to turn backups off for a specific device (short of just remembering to click the X when the backup starts)?\n\nA: (a) iTunes named backups (on your hard drive) using the UDID (Unique Device Identifier) of successfully connected iOS devices. So it's erroneous to state that a backup of a 3 GS will overwrite a backup of another device since each device has a unique UDID.\n(b) iTunes 10.5.1 doesn't provide option to not back up. However, you could uncheck the \"Open iTunes when this iPhone is connected\" which then allows you to connect your iPhone to iTunes without triggering a backup.\n\n", "Q: Can I connect standard Dell displays to a Thunderbolt iMac? Can I connect standard Dell monitors to a Thunderbolt iMac?\nI think the Dell monitors are VGA with DVI-D ports.\n\nA: If you get a Mini-DisplayPort/Thunderbolt to DVI adapter, then yes you can hook any DVI display up to your Mac.\n", "Q: How can I use a second computer to manage apps on my iPhone? I have an iPhone and two Macs -- an old Mac I've been using to manage what's on the phone, and a new one that I've never connected to the phone.\nNow I'd like to use the new Mac to buy a couple apps and add them to my phone. (The old machine isn't available right now.)\nI don't want to connect my phone to the new machine and have it sync and wipe out the apps and the music that are already on there.\nIs there any way to keep what I already have and add some more items using the new Mac?\n(The reason I don't just use iTunes on the phone itself is that something I want to get is so large that the phone refuses to download it over the cellular network.)\n\nA: You are quite correct, you don't want to sync your iPhone to this new Mac. At the least, you'd lose any songs or movies you have loaded.\nYou can do what you want using the iPhone Configuration Utility (free at http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/enterprise/). Install, connect the iPhone, click on the iPhone's icon, and go to the Applications tab. It will let you install or uninstall individual apps.\nOr connect your iPhone to WiFi (you could use Network Sharing from the new Mac, if no other WiFi is available) to download directly, after buying from either the iPhone or the Mac.\n", "Q: Are there any tweaks for Lion's autocorrect? I've found that Lion's autocorrect handles technical terminology abysmally.  Are there any configuration tweaks that adjust its behavior around words that might represent technical terms? \n\nA: For specific terms you find are getting \"corrected\" often, you could add them to the text substitution list as substitutes of themselves. That should work as a sort of whitelist to stop them from being autocorrected improperly.\nOpen up the Language & Text panel in System Preferences, and on the Text tab, click the + to add a new substitution. Enter the word you want whitelisted into both fields.\n\n", "Q: “PTY allocation request failed on channel 2” while using SSH These days when I try to SSH to my server I get this error:\nPTY allocation

I have been looking for a few weeks for a workaround to get iCal on Snow leopard to sync with iOS 5 devices with iCloud.\nIs there a work around that will allow syncing as I cannot upgrade to OSX Lion?\n\nA: I have found a suitable work around that I have been testing for a couple of days. \nWhile using iCal on a Mac running Snow Leopard, I needed to add an account to iCal. This account would point to iCloud and sync with it.\nSo, open Preferences and select accounts, enter the add account window by hitting +.\nthis takes you to:\n\nYou need to choose CalDav and enter your Apple ID email address (not your .me.com email address)\nenter in your password and the server name which in most cases is p06-caldav.icloud.com\nOnce this has been added you will need to uncheck some of the calendars in the 'on my mac' menu.\n", "Q: Reliable, Simple Transfer of Really Large Files? I want to be able to move really large video files (think 60 - 90 GB) between Macs in different cities on a closed network. I'd like to be able to go point to point, so no single-server or cloud-based solutions. Because the pipe between locations isn't huge, the files may take hours to transfer. I want a solution that won't just stop if there is an intermittent network error, or even an unexpected reboot. The interface should also be simple; something like a folder for each destination that a user can drag and drop to.\nNice to have would be the ability to monitor and pause a delivery on the receiving end, so if two transfers get started at the same time you don't have to wait forever for either to finish.\nI know there are some really expensive solutions. I think there are some FTP clients that  come close. Anyone know something affordable that would meet the requirements?\n\nA: Transmit is my personal favorite but Fetch also does the trick you ask. \n\niCloud will help you locate the IP of the remote machine and screen share if needed and is much simpler than getting a free DNS software solution to locate the IP of the other endpoint (assuming you have dynamic IP address or are behind a NAT router on either end of the transfer).\n", "Q: Can Numbers do conditional coloring of a cell based on a rule? I have a spreadsheet of open projects with payments for each milestone. \nRight now I set a cell to red if the client still owes, green if the client paid, and no fill if we havent reached the milestone yet. What I would like to do is get a sum on all red cells and another sum on all green cells. My hope is to make it easy to see how much money has been paid and how much is owed.\n\nA: Here's a better option:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add an 'Account Status' column\n\n*Select the entire column and set the cell format to [Pop-Up Menu] with options for 'Unfinished', 'Paid', '30 Days', '60 Days', '90+ Days' (or whatever options you want)\n\n*Select the entire column and set some conditional rules to color the cell according to the text in the cell (e.g. a green for [Text Is 'Paid'], a yellow for [Text Is '30 Days'], etc.)\n\n*Add some summary cells with COUNTIF formulas for each of your Pop-Up menu options ([=COUNTIF(Account Status,\"Paid\")], [=COUNTIF(Account Status,\"30 Days\")], etc.)\n\n\nNote that this will color ONLY the cells in the 'Account Status' column. There are some tricks to color the entire row, but this should be enough to catch your eye.\nYou can also use AppleScript if you need more complex summaries, but scripts cannot run automatically, where conditional rules do.\n\nA: This isn't the way to sum colours, you cant do this as the colour does not contain information that would be inputted into the cell,\nA workaround however is to add three columns, these would be titled Paid, Owed, Non complete. You can then add a radio button to all of the cells in these columns. \nYou can then sum the total of radio buttons checked in each column to give you running totals.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Mid 2009 does not boot without resetting system management control (SMC) Today i started my macbook pro and after some seconds it stopped working (just turned).

Then I switched it of again and tried to start it again but it did not start. \nNow every start requires to reset the SMC. Then the notebook boots up.\nAny idea what can cause this behavior?\n\nA: I'd try to boot the Mac into Recovery Mode and then Reinstall MacOS and see if that helps with the issue.

One of them is larger than the others. I converted them all to h.264 .m4v files with Handbrake, then tried to import them into iMovie directly.\nFive of the files it copied over perfectly. The large one, however, it insists on transcoding to a .mov file using the Apple Intermediate Codec (which is more highly preferred for editing than h.264).\nTHE PROBLEM: When both types of files — h.264 and AIC — appear in an iMovie Event, the thumbnails in the Event Browser do not show up; all video files are displayed as blank gray filmstrips. \n\nThe thumbnails themselves are not corrupted; they are generated correctly. Deleting the thumbnails and the cache and having iMovie rebuild them does not help. They are simply not being displayed.\nEven if I ask iMovie to go ahead and transcode the five smaller files, it refuses to; it copies them over as-is.\nEven if I ask iMovie to NOT transcode the larger file, it refuses not to; it always transcodes it anyway.\nI've seen recommendations to use several different \"iMovie converter\" apps, but they all seem like scammy crapware.\nSo what I need is one of the following four things, ordered from most to least preferable:\n\n\n*\n\n*A way to make iMovie display video thumbnails when mixing h.264 and AIC video in the same event\n\n*A way to make iMovie directly import the larger .m4v h.264 file that it currently insists on transcoding\n\n*A way to make iMovie transcode h.264 video even when it can import it directly\n\n*A good, decent, usable, reliable, non-scammy third-party app that I can use to transcode (as many different kinds as possible of) video files into something iMovie prefers to use directly.\n\n\nA: Answer for point 4:\n\n\n*\n\n*QuickTime Pro with Perian\n\n*MPEG Streamclip\n\n*DivX official converter\n\nA: Use Automator to make an application that transcodes file you feed into it.\n1: Make a new Automator application.\n\n2: Add the Encode Media action and choose the appropriate settings for your clips.\n\n3: Save the app somewhere.\n\n4: Then, drag the clips into the application you created.\n\nThe encoded versions, ready to throw into iMovie, should show up in the same directory as the original clips.\n\nA: At long last, I found a conversion app that seems to not make iMovie throw up all over itself. It's called iVI (Mac App Store link). It's not the prettiest Mac app ever written, but it's not as bad as a lot of apps in this category, and it works wonderfully. \niMovie still insists on transcoding some of the files it generates, but thumbnails now render almost flawlessly; occasionally one video in the project will be gray, but it's consistently, unglitchily gray.

Could this be a bug in iOS 5.0.1?\n\nA: It's less a bug than getting the people to send you an iMessage to your email and not your phone number.\nThe database actually has two accounts for you and since they are not merged / unified on the server end, you will end up with two accounts / two endpoints and messages to one are not combined with messages to the other.\niMessage in iOS6 does a much better job of unifying several emails and phone numbers, but in 5.0.1 there is no unity. I still like to have one address for my \"caller ID\" so that contacts tend to reply to my preferred account. \n\nA: You have to turn on the same phone number and email accounts in iMessages on all devices to send as... and received from... all these phone number and email accounts to make it work.\nIf you forgot to turn on send as your phone number or any of your email, then it won't receive from them.\nGo to:\niMessages > Settings > Send & Receive > turn on all your phone numbers and email.\nMost importantly, set \"Start new conversations from\" your phone number, not from your email addresses.\n", "Q: iMac External Monitor Support I have a desktop computer with an Nvidia 9700 GTX graphics card. I'm using the DVI port on the desktop with the Mini-Display Port DVI adapter to plug in to my mid-2011 iMac Thunderbolt port.\nI boot the computer in Target Display Mode (holding T at startup), and all I get is the thunderbolt/firewire screensaver, not my desktop.\nI'm assuming their might be a different adapter, or that I need a different graphics card? I'm willing to shell out the money, just haven't found a concrete answer on the internet. Thanks.\n\nA: The Thunderbolt iMacs can only act as a display for other Thunderbolt-equipped computers (Macs only at this point, but once there are Windows PCs with Thunderbolt they should work too). Thunderbolt ports can output a DisplayPort signal, but the input ports (i.e. anything that's a monitor - Thunderbolt Display and iMacs in Target Display Mode) can only take Thunderbolt, not DisplayPort or DVI.\nThe Apple KB article on the subject: iMac (Mid 2011): Target Display Mode does not work with Mini DisplayPort cable\n\niMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) and iMac (27-inch, Mid 2011) support Target Display Mode via Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt cable (2 m) when the source is another Thunderbolt-equipped computer.\n\n(Emphasis mine)\n\nA: Holding T at startup isn't Target Display Mode, it's Target Disk Mode (which turns your computer into a very expensive external hard drive for another computer).\nTarget Display Mode is activated by hitting Command+F2 when the computer is on.\nSome notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to be logged in to the computer being used as a display. If the screen is locked, Command+F2 won't work.\n\n*If the computer acting as a screen turns on a screen saver which requires a password, Command+F2 won't immediately disable target display mode. To disable Target Display Mode, you'll have to either: (1) disconnect the cable; or (2) move the mouse, type in your password, then hit enter (the same as you would if you could see the screen, even though you can't), THEN hit Command+F2. The first option is far safer from a security standpoint (i.e. what if you computer's screen saver DIDN'T turn on and somebody sent you an IM? You would have just typed your password to them).\n", "Q: Looking for workflow or script for saving Kindle documents I'm using a Kindle DX (3G, no WiFi) for reading documents saved from the web with Readability.  Because Amazon charges a conversion cost for these documents I'm forwarding the documents to my foo.baz@free.kindle.com account.\nAmazon then forwards these as emails to me where I use Gmail or Mail.app to click on the link inside each message and laboriously save the corresponding foo.azw download to my Kindle.\nI'm wondering if anyone has created an automator workflow or an Applescript that can visit a group of unread Amazon emails and use the links in each to download the corresponding .azw files?\nIf there's a better way to go about this I'd also be delighted to hear about it.\n\nA: My solution requires you to have an ifttt and Dropbox accounts :\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign in to http://ifthisthenthat.com/\n\n*create a Dump Kindle doc recipe as follow :\n\n*\n\n*Gmail trigger : New email from\nEnter your foo.baz@free.kindle.com email adress\n\n*Dropbox action : Add file from url\nFile URL : {{Body plain}} (use the + Addins listbox)\nDropbox folder path : whatever...\n\n\n\nThen url of the .azw file will be automatically extracted from the mail (I tested it because was not clear for me) and corresponding file will be downloaded to your Dropbox folder!\n", "Q: Where are FLV cache files stored? I want to download some videos which are streamed through a Flash player. Since the website does not give me the option to download the video, I would like to know where are the FLV files stored when the video is being downloaded by the player.\nOn Linux we store files called Flash* in /tmp... I guess there is something similar in MacOS X. Where should I look?\n\nA: This may vary by browser, but in Safari, if you press ⌘⌥A, you bring up the Activity window. Find the largest file being downloaded for the current page; that is generally the Flash Video. Double click it, and it will be downloaded to your downloads folder.\nThis avoids having to learn the various places Mac OS X will store temporary files on disk. In general, things that aren't expected to be cached for re-use end up in /private/var/tmp and things that are in ~/Library/Caches but in your case, safari will expose that file more directly and allow you to fetch it.\nIf you are ever curious - you can watch filesystem activity in real time with some quick commands like sudo fs_usage -w | grep Safari\n\nA: As far as I can see, using Firefox on 10.7.3, the flash video gets stored as a file called FlashTmp.XXXXXX, where the Xs are randomly generated.\nThis file is in /private/var/folders/, 3 levels deep in randomly generated directory names like ax/4fis_mf2993_23iofdasiof29309sfd/J.\nI found it by using the command lsof|grep Flash.\n", "Q: Where did my \"Default Group\" preference go? In iOS 4.x.x, I remember having a preference in:\nSettings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Contacts\nthat would allow me to select a Default Group.\nNow that I've upgraded to iOS 5, that preference is no longer visible.\nWas it removed?  Moved?  Do I have to have a specific setup in order to have that preference available?\nI need to select a \"Default Group\" in order to reproduce a bug reported by a beta tester, so it'd be handy to be able to set this preference.\n\nA: In iOS 5.1, you can define a \"Default Account\" for Contacts in Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars.  Scroll down until you see a Contacts heading; Default Account is at the bottom of that section. This setting will affect where new Contacts created on the iPhone are placed.\n", "Q: How to remove non-essential files from Leopard I am cleaning up a really old mac to bring it back to use. It has an 80 gig hard drive and after wiping out downloads, documents, pictures, music, videos and unneccesary applications I am now stranded at about 48 gigs. I read that Leopard needs about 9 gigs, how do I get rid of the remaining 20 gb without reinstalling. Its been three and half years since I bought it and I could only find Part 2 of the recovery disk. (I have already gotten rid of iLife, iTunes, iWorks, Web Browsers, Printer Drivers etc as I need only terminal based facilities such as lynx and vi.) If anyone could point me to solutions for freeing up as much space as I can it'd be very helpful. \n\nA: You can use Monolingual to trim the locales you don't require. This should trim at least a couple of GB.\nThe printer drivers are located in /Library/Printers. You can delete everything within the Printers directory (note, do not touch the /System/Library/Printers/ directory).\nAdditionally, if it's a default install, it may have come with iLife. GarageBand loops also take up a few GB and are located in /Library/Application Support/Garageband/Apple Loops/.\nThere are other areas you can trim space, but those will net the biggest gains. You can also give programs like DaisyDisk a shot (or free equivalent). They'll show you how data is distributed on your hard drive, and allow you to further pinpoint cruft that can be removed.\n", "Q: How do I compile Doom3? Has anyone compiled doom3, released here:\nhttps://github.com/TTimo/doom3.gpl ?\nI have never done something like that before (compile c++/xcode project) and a how-to would be more than welcome.\nAlso how do I know if it can run in my macbook? \n\nA: Why would you compile the engine? It is not the full game, so you wouldn't be able to play after compilation.\nAnyway, if you're still interested, there's a thread on Hacker News speaking about it, they also mention how to compile the project if you don't have Xcode 3.2\nEdit: for what is worth, here the instructions for Xcode 4.\n", "Q: How can I add all users to Print Administrator group but not full administrator? Gordon Davisson offered a solution to a \"standalone user\" in another question\nI'm facing the same issue in an office environment.\nPrinter paused and System Administrator needs to be called to enter admin password to release the printer.\nIs there a terminal script that would allow me to effectively give ALL our users these Printer Admin privileges AND would follow them to other desktops as they move around from office to office, site to site.\n(Although using various desktop macs, they are ALL on mobile accounts to allow them to work locally should server go offline for any time.)\n\nA: I don't think there's a way to do this on a per-user-account basis, but you can do it per-computer.  The reason for this is that printer admin rights are controlled by membership in the _lpadmin group, which is a local group on each computer.  Since it's a local group, membership is controlled locally.\nI can give you two ways to do it: first, change the _lpadmin group on all the computers to make everyone with an account (local or network) a member:\nsudo dseditgroup -o edit -n /Local/Default -a staff -t group _lpadmin\n\nSecond, you could create a network group (I assume you're using Open Directory network/mobile accounts?) and make everyone in that group a member of _lpadmin:\nsudo dseditgroup -o edit -n /Local/Default -a netprinteradmin -t group _lpadmin\n\nUnfortunately, either of these would have to be run on each Mac individually.  If you have Apple Remote Desktop set up to admin the Macs, you could use its Sent Unix Command feature to push either command to all computers with a single operation...\n", "Q: Can't start eclipse on a Mac OS X 10.7.2 I've been trying to start eclipse IDE on my Mac for a while, I downloaded different versions and no one works.\nI'm sorry if there is something I missed. \nHere is the log:\n!SESSION 2011-11-23 17:04:56.136\n----------------------------------------------- eclipse.buildId=I20110613-1736 java.version=1.6.0_29 java.vendor=Apple\nInc.

I want to install different packages and software but I really don't like the idea of doing a sudo command to install anything.  \nI use Homebrew and MacPorts for getting any apps I need but is it possible to install applications, libraries and packages specific to a python style virtual environment and if I think I don't want these packages to collide, I can just delete a virtual environment or simply use a different environment?  \nPlease let me know if the question does not make sense. Ever since I started using virtual environments in Python, I can't imagine not working with virtual environments and I was wondering if there is something equivalent or a pattern of installation that people recommend that would mimic that behavior?\nps> I know there is Fink also but I don't use it.\n\nVersion 2:\nI think I need to verify my question further.\nI already use virtualenvwrapper and do everything Python related in virtual environments. The question is independent of Python. Its just that virtualenv inspired me to see if there was an equivalent, user-account-wide. \nWhat I figured would be awesome, came up when I was trying to install libjpeg, PIL, FreeType2, Pillow etc.\nI wanted to install these libraries or packages like libjpeg, FreeType2 in a virtual environment of the OS. If I felt like the Homebrew version of these library installs was not to my satisfaction, I could just work in a different environment or try some other installation procedures and switch between environments of the installed applications.  \nSo, I was wondering if something like that exists for OS X or are there some tricks one can do to emulate it?\n\nA: If you are dead set on that paradigm, then virtual machines seems to be a logical next step, no? Grab Virtualbox and do your thing in a VM. \nNote however that package managers solve many problems virtualenv addresses. The libs you mention won't change interfaces radically, they are stable releases. \nIt's python libs which are the most volatile, not things like FreeType. I would just use whatever version X11 is using. \n\nA: I'm not sure I understand what you are asking but, if you are asking about creating Python virtual environments using virtualenv, then you're there already.  The advantage of using virtualenv is that it creates a self-contained Python instance within the virtual environment directory you create.  When you use the python and pip commands within the virtualenv bin directory (which is what happens when you activate the virtualenv), any Python packages you install, whether it be with python setup.py or pip install or even easy_install are installed to a site-library directory within the virtual environment and have no effect on any other Python installations on your system.  The virtual environment directory and its contents are subject to normal file system permissions so you can create it without the need to use sudo (say, if you create it somewhere within your home directory) and you can set file permissions to control whether any other users have access to the virtualenv.  Unless you use the --no-site-packages option when creating the virtualenv, the virtualenv will have access to existing or new packages added to the base Python instance (the system Python or whichever other one you used to create the virtualenv, by default, the Python instance that virtualenv was originally installed in).  But packages installed local to the virtual environment do not affect the original Python instance.  If you used virtualenv --no-site-packages, no packages outside of the Python standard library will be \"inherited\" by the virtual environment.\nYou can use virtualenv in conjunction with third-party package managers like MacPorts, Homebrew, or Fink (they include virtualenv ports/recipes/packages) but within a virtual environment you will need to manage local Python packages yourself, presumably using the pip installed inside each virtual environment. virtualenv does not provide a mechanism for managing entities that are not packaged using Python standard distutils-style packaging, i.e. non-Python apps and C libraries.\n", "Q: Flag/Unflag shortcut in mail.app I learned that ⇧⌘L in mail.app should toggle the flag of a selected message.

Pretty much every file I've \"Get Info\"-ed, has the permissions shown here: \n\nI think the important part here is that it says \"You have custom access.\" As you can see, I should have write-access, but for some reason, I'm limited by that top \"everyone.\" If I change that from \"Custom\" to \"Read & Write,\" the message changes to \"You can read and write,\" and I can edit the file but I can't do this to every file for the rest of forever. \nWhat's the best way to fix this situation?\nEDIT: I re-ran the permissions repair, and that didn't fix things. Here's what I'm seeming, specifically: \n\n\n*\n\n*When I try to delete files anywhere in my home directory, I'm prompted for a password.\n\n*I've tried editing files anywhere in my home directory, and the changes can never be saved, because the file is locked. I've seen this in Byword.app, Preview.app, Pages.app, and TextEdit.app. When I try to save, I'll get a dialog saying \"The document 'doc-name' could not be saved. The file is locked. Do you want to save your changes anyway? [Save Anyway] [Cancel]\" If I choose [Save Anyway], I get a second dialog saying \"You don't have permission to save the file.\"  I was able to edit and save a file in MacVim.app that TextEdit.app declared I didn't have permission to save.\n\n*I have three folders in my home folder that are aliased to folders on another drive. As far as I can tell, everything is fine on that drive. It's just the main, start-up drive that's having this issue.\n\n\nA: Permissions repair only affects folders and packages installed by apple and during software updates and it leaves most user folders alone. \nYou should be able to run it again to fix anything not correct. If there are still issues, you likely have a user definition corruption issue and might have to attack that head on. Which specific app it folder has these issues? Edit your question and this can also be edited once more detail is provided. \n", "Q: Mac App Store and multiple OS partitions I recently set up an additional Lion partition in addition to my existing partition for development reasons.\nI was in the process of installing apps on this new volume through the Mac App Store, when I realized that it would not let me install apps that I had installed on the older partition.\nFor instance, when I was trying to install Twitter.app, since it exists on my older partition, the App Store lists it as \"Installed\". This prevents me from installing it on my new partition. \nIs there a hidden preference that would limit the App Store to only search the boot volume for installed apps? Is there a better way to manage installations across multiple volumes using the App Store? \n\nA: At present the app isn't set up to restrict its spotlight search to any specific volume. That behavior falls as a natural consequence of \"the Mac way\"  of letting an app reside anywhere and still run. \nYou can use disk utility to unmount that volume when it's time to install or update as a workaround. \n\nA: Press alt while clicking on the “installed” greyed button on the App Store item. This should force a redownload of the app.\n\nA: How about deleting the package receipt that tells the system the app is installed? The receipts for everything you have installed on your machine are in (root directly) OS > Library > Receipts.\n", "Q: Replacement for Quicken 2007 Now that I've upgraded to Lion, Quicken 2007 is history. I need a good replacement that automatically downloads credit card and bank statements from major cards and banks. I need to track investments, too. Importing of old Quicken data would be required, too. Quicken Essentials doesn't fit the bill for me.\nI have looked at Money and Moneywell. Both have their strong points, but they don't do everything on the list above. Moneydance is written in Java and I don't like the non-Mac OS look and feel.\nThanks for your suggestions.\n\nA: In an attempt to replace Quicken 2003 for Windows, I ended up on Moneywell. It has a companion iOS app which allows me to enter transactions on the go and sync via Dropbox.\nIt isn't perfect, but I like it.\n\nA: I looked at a number of alternatives before concluding that there isn't an alternative as comprehensive as Quicken/Windows.  You are going to have to choose between sacrificing some functionality with a native Mac app (hoping for future updates) or running Quicken Windows under Boot Camp/VMware/Parallels/Virtual Box.\niBank is another alternative although Moneydance seems to win most of the time when people compare them (hating the Moneydance look all the way).\n\nA: iBank from IGG software is available in the Mac App Store, and has been a great replacement (and upgrade) from quicken. It also includes direct Quicken import. \nThey are also running a 'Spring Break Sale' That will take off 25% if you are currently using Moneywell, Quicken for Mac, or Quicken Essentials. \n\n\nA: You might look at SEE Finance. Lacks tags, otherwise well-featured. (Not affiliated with company.)\n\nA: Intuit has just announced that they are releasing a Lion-compatible version of Quicken 2007 \"soon\". Press release.\nNote that they are not announcing a Quicken 2012 for Lion. They are merely promising a patched version of Quicken 2007.\n\nA: Squirrel is available in the Mac App Store and works quite nicely. \n\nA: moneydance is good, I've used it for 5 yrs.

Could you provide more information about who you are (user-wise of course: admin, normal user,...) and which files you are trying to move and to what (internal, external,...)\n", "Q: My iPod will not work, trying disk utility but now stuck I went to use my iPod yesterday after putting some new music on it and it said there was no music on it.   When looking at my iPod it said it was full. I tried to restore it on iTunes and it said it was corrupt and I got error 1430.\nWhen I tried to take care of it with DiskUtility I may have worsened the problem.  I attempted to erase it, because it would not let me select repair.  That did not go through, but then it did let me try to repair it.  I tried, but that would not go through either.  I then looked at it in iTunes and it said it was empty.  I tried DiskUtility one more time and it now is giving me this:\n\nWhat can I do now to get my iPod back? I don't care if I loose everything on my iPod.\n\nA: To restore the files did you back up your iPod, or possibly do you have iCloud? This  program might help\n\nA: If it doesn't matter if you lose all your data on your iPod or not, you can erase it with a dozen of other tools. But before you start with that, you should try to reset your iPod and see if it shows up on your Mac/iTunes.\nIf that doesn't help you out, you can try a hard reset. Maybe that one will help you out.\nNormally, you should be getting some results with these resets and it should appear in DiskUtility. \n", "Q: iChat can't authenticate to Lion Server 10.7.2 I've enabled iChat and iCal Server through our local 10.7.2 Server which has DNS set up correctly.

My real question is will Xcode's performance be noticeably different with a dual core i7 as opposed to a quad core i7? \nI might be purchasing a new computer soon, and want to know if it would be worth it to go with the quad core 15\" instead of the dual core 13\". I'm not really worried about screen size.\nThanks!\n\nA: Xcode will make good use of many cores - especially when running the simulator, unit testing at build time and just coding / compiling / searching documentation. \nAlso check to see if the processor with more cores has a higher speed boost when only one core is running. The rated speeds are controlled more by thermal conditions under full or benchmark loads and can run faster when the current workload is single thread dominated. \n\nIn general, the IO is the first thing to slow down a developer doing multiple normal dev tasks. Next is insufficient RAM and a distant third underpowered CPU. Do take your Xcode installer and some sample projects into an apple store and ask if you could run some tests on an air as well as larger machines. Some specific code bases and settings might be more polarized than the general case and more biased to CPU with larger cache or speeds, but the smallest air is so much faster than my three year old 15 MBP it's not very funny at all. \n\nA: It might have been the case for objective C in the days long gone but Xcode 8.0 does NOT make use of all the cores (at least when compiling swift).\nA note to explain:\n\n\n*\n\n*get xcode 8.0\n\n*run activity monitor open on CPU tab\nwatch the idle times during swift compile phase. THEN do be sure to downvote (once you see no significant idle).\nAn i7 based mac is a bonus.\n\n\nUPD: It's broken in a peculiar way.\nAt the beginning it fires off 4-5 swift compilers to match the number of physical cores but later on it runs 1(ONE!) swift compiler\nat a time leading to massive CPU underutilization.\nMaybe the swift frontend can not figure out the dependencies for\na parallel build.\nNote, I'm not saying: do not buy a 4 core machine! do not migrate to swift!\nBut activity monitor setup to update every single second\non an i5 and i7 powered macs shows only single swift compiler in flight.\nIt's slowly becoming a moot point as the swift potentially compiles faster than objc and there is less code to compile.\nUPD20161104: note how archiving (presumably written by the old school nextstep engineers) contrasts with this newfangled opensource junk:\nit utilizes just a little over 3 cores leaving 1 to have a (very) responsive system.

I bought a used iPhone 4, originally from the UK (now in Denmark). The phone has been reset/restored, updated to 5.0.1 and appears to be functional with 4-5 bars and the \"3G\" icon next to them. The phone worked perfectly with the previous owner's SIM card.\nHowever, all outgoing calls fail immediately with a \"call ended\" message, incoming calls produce a two-tone at the caller's end and texts can not be sent, yet data works over 3G. Strangely, I have made 1 outgoing call while connected to iTunes, but a second attempt failed. I am experiencing this using a known-to-work SIM card from another iPhone.\nIn Xcode, the console produces these messages when trying to make a call:\nkernel[0]: computeProxBaseline.. This is a negative slope unit\nkernel[0]: computeProxBaseline.. This is a negative slope unit\nkernel[0]: This is a negative Slope unit. Going to use a fixed power of 3. This will behave like an Apex unit\n\nGoogling for this only revealed this unhelpful pastie: http://pastebin.com/q8vMQvpv\nSo, the phone or text is not working but data over 3G is.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: The phone was replaced free of charge with no clear explanation of what was wrong. The replacement, however, would indicate that it was not a software/firmware issue.\n", "Q: Is there a way to type Niqqud on iOS? On my iPod touch I am able to type basic Hebrew characters by adding a Hebrew international keyboard.\nIs there some way for me to type Hebrew vowels (Niqqud) [without using any specialized apps]?\n\nA: I think not, only by using a hardware keyboard or via copy/paste from another doc or an app like Unicode Maps.  You might be able to make a custom layout as well with Unicode Maps.  Also have a look at Keyman.\nA 3rd party keyboard is Davka Nikud.\n\nA: UniK - Unicode & navigation Keyboard extension allows you to do that. Swipe up and press the Aleph base character and if you want niqqud swipe right.\n\nA: Jailbreak your phone, then edit \\System\\Library\\Frameworks\\UIKit.framework\\Keyboard-he.plist, changing, for example,  ז׳ ז to ז׳ ז זִ זֶ זַ זָ זֹ זּ \n\nA: No, you want to use Google Translate for that. For example, the word that they gave me for \"USA\" is אַרצוֹת הַבְּרִית (ertzot-habreet). Google Translate cannot give you most phrases using niqqud, so I suggest doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy and paste all the words you want to say into Pages (or another word processor).\n\n*Put them together in a Hebrew sentence like:\n. אֲנִי לֹא מִכָּאן\n(ani lo m'kan) = I'm not from there.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: On iOS 11 to enter Niqqud use an external keyboard, then use Option + key (e.g. Option + 7 is Qamatz).\n\nA: Don't know Hebrew, but on iOS 5 there's a load of built in international keyboards, one of them Hebrew.\nGo to Settings > General > International (Near the bottom) > Keyboards.\nIn there you can add a Hebrew keyboard, and any others you need. \nWhen you activate the keyboard anywhere on your iPod touch now, you should a \"world\" key near the bottom left. Tap that to cycle through the different keyboards you added.\nThis should be available in earlier iOS versions, but I'm not sure if the settings are in the same location.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: What iPad PDF reader can I use to highlight text? What iPad PDF reader can I use to highlight text? I don't really care about annotations, saving, or transferring. It just helps me read better if I can highlight things.\nIt does not look like I can do anything other than bookmark pages with iBooks.\n\nA: I use GoodReader for this. It can do highlighting, different kinds of underlining, annotating and save annotated copies to preserve your originals. \nIt's a great general purpose file management and viewing app as well. Sort of like a \"Preview.app\" for iOS. Costs $5 in the App Store. Well worth it IMHO.\nI've heard that iAnnotate is far superior at annotating tasks, hence the name, but it's $10. I already own GoodReader, and it fulfills my needs, so can't see a reason to spend $10 more just to markup PDFs.\nHope that helped.\n\nA: It depends slightly on what you mean by \"highlighting text\".  The PDF specification allows for highlighted text and some apps, such as GoodReader, do their highlighting by taking advantage of this.  Other apps, such as iAnnotate and GoodNotes, work in a slightly different way.  They consider the PDF as a background and then draw on top of it.  If you draw with slightly transparent ink then you can create the effect of a highlighter pen.  These two techniques are different:\n\n\n*\n\n*Proper highlighting.  Main characteristics: it follows the text precisely and it goes under the text.  The latter is a definite advantage, but the former can be irritating: if you have, for example, maths where the characters go above and below the line then the highlighting goes up and down as well.\n\n*Overlaid highlighting.  Main characteristics: it is not constrained to follow the text and it goes over the text.  This means that it is much more like a real highlighter pen on paper and so you can highlight absolutely anything on the page.\nI use GoodReader, iAnnotate, and GoodNotes and like them all.  GoodReader does \"proper\" highlighting whilst the other two do the \"overlay\" type (GoodReader can do overlayed highlighting if you choose the pen correctly).  I find the overlay type fits better with my reading (but I am a mathematician), but GoodReader has various other benefits that make it the better choice for reading PDFs for me.\n(I often have GoodReader and GoodNotes open as \"adjacent\" apps so that I can flip between reading a PDF and writing my ideas.)\n\nA: I use Easy Annotate, which also enable highlighting text, as well as underlining, drawing, etc on PDFs. It even allows editing two PDFs side-by-side.\nDisclaimer: I developed Easy Annotate myself, as there was no app that fulfilled our needs.\n\nA: I use writepdf, which allows you to highlight text and I find it fairly easy to use.\nIt's an app that isn't shouted about as much as it should be! I have tried various other apps that claim to do the same but as I said for usability it is easy and simple to use, when I downloaded it there wasn't anything fussy and I was opening, editing and saving PDFs quickly. I love the search function which comes up with a list of clickable links also. It wasn't too expensive and just for those options alone it's worth the money. I had one query and customer support dealt with it within 10 mins and I was ready to go. Like I said, worth every penny.\n", "Q: Is your copy of music from the iTunes store the same as mine? I was wondering how the DRM/Purchased/Protected thing works with the songs downloaded from the iTunes store. \nIf two people by a DRMed song from iTunes, are the raw bytes they download the same? Or are the songs encrypted using different keys per user such that they basically download different byte-streams?\nI think they encrypt using a single key but I am not sure if that poses a threat because if even a single person can obtain the key by some hack, then it can easily be shared to everyone.\n\nA: iTunes removed DRM from it's music catalog in 2009, so I'm wondering if your question is about iTunes at all? If not, you might be better off specifying what DRM scheme you have a question about.\nThat said, iTunes used FairPlay for DRM before, and as explained here, it does generate a unique key for every user. So, it will indeed be different for every customer. The same should be true for all DRM schemes, since if the customer could not be identified from the data inside the DRM scheme, it would defeat the purpose of DRM to start with.\nIt is also worth noting that while DRM was removed from iTunes, current downloads still contain your Apple ID in the downloaded file. However, tool exists to remove this meta-data from the media.\n\nA: No - each Apple ID is embedded in the first 400 bytes of each file so even if the majority of the files are the same each is different. \n", "Q: My Desktop seems to be \"locked\". How can I fix this? I am having some problems with my Desktop on a relatively new Lion install.  I can't move folders around (when I try, the icon gets the slashed-O \"no\" symbol and they bounce back where they came from), and the \"New Folder\" menu item on Finder is grayed out (and, likewise, shift-cmnd-N does nothing).\nI've tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Making sure the \"View\" \"Sort by\" setting is set to \"None\".\n\n*Checking permissions.  \"Get Info\" shows all access control entries with \"read and write\" permissions (including \"everyone\" listed twice), and ls -le shows:\ndrwxrwxrwx@  31 username username 1054 Nov 23 23:25 Desktop\n0: group:everyone allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,readattr,writeattr,\nreadextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity\nI also ran \"Repair File Permissions\" on the main hard disk.\n\n*Deleting my ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist file, and having that regenerate after a restart.\n\n*Confirming that the Desktop is not locked, both through Finder \"get info\" (confirming that the \"Locked\" checkbox is not checked) and through ls -lO (no flags listed).\nFurther, I have noticed that although I cannot create a new folder on the Desktop using shift-cmnd-N or the Finder menu, I can \"mkdir\" a new Desktop folder in the terminal.\nAny ideas?\nUpdate: I may have found a clue -- the result of xattr -l Desktop shows that the com.apple.FinderInfo attribute is set, with bytes 9 and 10 set to 20 and 10 respectively.  Is this normal?  (By contrast, my older Mac has no attributes set on Desktop.)\n\nA: Aha!  My clue was indeed the right lead (I think) -- removing the com.apple.FinderInfo attribute with\n`xattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo ~/Desktop`\n\nappears to have fixed the problem.  See https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2741291?start=0&tstart=0 for a few more details.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my MacBook Air. Restarting the Mac did the trick, after changing the permissions to \"Read & Write\".\n\nA: For me, just a restart took care of the problem, after repairing permissions, and other suggestions did not work!\n\nA: Was having this problem with my Desktop folder. Was still getting Operation not permitted errors with these commands.

We recently upgraded from the iPhone 3GS to the iPhone 4S. In general it has been a good experience, however we aren't sure how to turn off 3G and go to the EDGE network on the 4S. It doesn't appear to be an iOS 5 thing since older phones with iOS 5 still retain the ability to turn off 3G and switch to edge. Instead of turning off 3G being an option (which would kick us back to edge) we can only turn off cellular data, but calls don't revert networks.\nThis is very important when using the iPhone in our area since the 3G and 4G networks are loaded down and very spotty. With the 3GS I could turn off 3G and switch to EDGE and go from 1-2 bars to 5 and go from 4-10 dropped calls a day to 0. With the iPhone 4S and 4G, I still have the spotty service and dropped calls, but no easy workaround.\n\nA: You cannot at this time.\nThe option to disable 3G no longer exists for the 4S. No word on why Apple disabled the feature. It may be a proactive move to dump old technology as the phone still supports 2G and will switch to the slower network if 3G is not found.\nThere is a rather large discussion regarding this matter on Apple's forums.\n\nA: Would like to provide an update to this answer: Updating to iOS 5.1 fixes this issue (Essentially the enable 3G toggle shows up again).\n", "Q: How do you use Google Voice instead of built-in text message with Siri on iPhone4S?

Can't seem to find any documentation on that point.\n\nA: Unfortunately, AFAIK, this setting does not exist. (It doesn't exist in another WebKit browser, either: Google Chrome. You can do this in Firefox, though, using 'about:config'.)\nAbout hard-coded cipher priorities/support for the SSL/TLS handshake:\nI tested that Safari does not support 40-bit RC4 encryption with an MD5 hash. This means that it does not support some products that are required by US export law to use low (<64-bit) encryption.\nSee also:\nhttp://www.carbonwind.net/blog/post/A-quick-look-over-some-browsers-and-their-SSLTLS-implementations.aspx\n\"Initially, in SSL/TLS negotiations, TLS with RSA and weak 128-bit RC4 keys are offered first and second in the cipher order.

I have upgraded my iPhone to iOS 5 and my MacBook to Lion, so \"enjoying\" the Photo Stream goodness now.\nI have plugged my iPhone in and see that all the photos I have taken have been synchronised to my laptop via Photo Stream already.\nDoes this mean I do not need to sync them again? I thought Photo Stream was only a temp location and will get removed after some time?\nSo I think selecting \"Photo Stream\" in iPhoto shows the temp store, but they are also saved into a Event where they will remain even after being removed from Photo Stream.\nAre my assumptions correct, or does it work differently?\n\nA: Photo Stream only saves either your last 30 days' worth of photos or your last 1000 photos, whichever you hit first. However, in iPhoto on the Mac, the \"automatic import\" feature (which I believe is enabled by default) will automatically copy any photos in your photo stream to your Mac's local hard drive.\n\nSo I think selecting \"Photo Stream\" in iPhoto shows the temp store, but they are also saved into a Event where they will remain even after being removed from Photo Stream.\n\nCorrect (again, as long as you have automatic import enabled. You can double-check the setting in iPhoto preferences).\n\nA: You are correct. Photo Stream is a part of iCloud, so any photos you take on your iPhone are wirelessly sent to your computer and will remain there until you delete them, even after they leave Photo Stream.\n", "Q: How can I share apps and music purchased on one apple ID between 7 devices?

I have seen in some places people saying that I'm allowed to authorized up to 10 devices, 5 of which can be computers, but iTunes seems to be treating computers and other devices the same for me, limiting me to 5 no matter what.\nAny ideas what might be wrong?\n\nA: Maybe you have authorized Macs you no longer have.\nGo to your account in iTunes, under Apple ID Overview you can see how many computers you have authorized and (once a year) you can deauthorize all, after that you should be able to reauthorize your Macs. (This does not affect iOS devices, as they do not count towards your 5 devices limit)\n", "Q: Subversion 1.7 for OS X Lion I am quite lost, how do I get this to work.

(the answer is YES) I need help with understanding what will happen with all the content if I'll agree to iPad's request (which I see every time I connect it to the computer) to update the iOS from 4.3.5 to 5.0.1. Every time I make an attempt to start that process, I interrupt it scared with all those warnings that all the apps and content will be removed. It suggests to synch, but when I'm starting the synch process — it looks like synch works only one way: from Mac to iPad, not the other way around. It frankly drives me crazy.\nI do have Apps which I bought directly to the iPad; books which I uploaded as epub or pdf files from various locations on my hard drive into the iPad, avi or mkv videos converted to m4v and drag-and-dropped into iTunes, etc. Nothing is kept in the iTunes Library.\nI don't understand what is the suggested procedure to upgrade the iPad software without losing all my apps and media files.\nCould someone, please, explain what to do to make this upgrade the way it won't remove my files and apps?\nHere are screenshots of warnings I see and don't get what should be done about it:\nI clicked the Update button:\n\nIt says there are items that should be transfered to iTunes Library, but does not say how.\nDrag-and-drop in iTunes from iPad to the Library doesn't do a thing.\nNext screen (assuming it'll offer me to do the transfer) is:\n\nIt says \"Updating to iOs 5.0.1 will delete...\" basically everything, and suggests to apply this update on the computer where I synch apps, etc. I am on my only computer now. I don't synch, because I don't understand what synch does, except the warnings that it will remove everything from the iPad. I don't want to \"synch\" empty Library with lots of content on the iPad by removing this content.\nWhen I'm attempting to synch the apps, it shows:\n\nNot all of the apps were bought sitting behind this computer.

If you've never trusted iTunes before and been manually copying items onto your iDevice then you're just making it hard on yourself.\nSynchronizing your files and upgrading the iOS are separate steps. I would recommend you get the iPad linked to your iTunes library properly and synchronization figured out before trying to upgrade lest you lose your iPad content in the process.\nFirst, make sure your iTunes and your iPad are registered to the same AppleID you used to download your apps and other iTunes store items. (This may already be the case if it's telling you about purchases, but check.)\nNext, download your past purchases to your Mac.\nFor other items like your own music and video files, the synchronization is one-way. If they're not in your iTunes then they won't sync back from your iPad.\nTry using manual mode for those items if you're happy leaving well enough alone with keeping those items on your iPad.\nOtherwise, you'll have get these from your original source (ideally) or use a third-party utility to extract the files from the device. It's been a while since I've had to do that myself, but as I recall it was a bit messy since the files lost their original filenames when they were stored in the device's filesystem/database. At least I think you can get them out somehow, but yes, it might be buggy.\nThe key is to have everything in iTunes before allowing the iOS upgrade to remove anything from the iPad. In my own experience, everything was right back where it was after the iOS upgrade, even though I had some similar warnings, but if you don't already have the items in iTunes then it might be a different story.\n", "Q: What can be done to troubleshoot OS X Wi-Fi self-assigning ip address of 169.xxxxxxxxx when other clients connect?

Any help would be very much appreciated.\nI'm not sure how this script could be triggered, but ideally it would run if a change is made to a birthday in address book (or a new one added).\n\nA: To set single alerts on all birthdays, you can avoid a script altogether:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Calendar Preferences in Calendar.\n\n*Under General, tick \"Show Birthdays calendar\".\n\n*Under Alerts, set an alert for \"Birthdays\".\n\n\nI haven't taken the time to actually write up an AppleScript for the double alarm parts, but this article seems to cover scripting calendar alarms quite nicely. I would imagine you would just need to create a file or list in the script that contains the names of the events (which you can deduce from the standard naming convention Calendar app uses).\nAlso I am using Mountain Lion with Calendar app. I can't recall if the steps above work on older versions of iCal.\n\nA: I believe the difference is that the Birthday's calendar on ical does not create alarms before the event. Nor does it let you add them manually.\nI think you could make this work though with a folder actions script. Enable the Birthdays calendar in ical. Then attach a script to the folder where these events are stored. When a new event is added (ie you've added a new birthday to your address book) the script will be triggered.\nHere's the folder where I found my Birthdays events:\n/Library/Calendars/FA907C55-E8CD-4291-8173-B3F86886E2BF.calendar/Events\nYou may have to dig through the lists of calendars until you find the correct folder, but it should be in there.\nFrom there, the script would take the new item added to the folder, and then copy it to a separate calendar and add the alarm. To set it up, I'd create a new calendar where you want these new events to be dropped. Take the events from your birthdays calendar, and drag them onto the desktop or somewhere (they'll be deleted later). Then open each of them. It'll ask you which calendar you want to add them to, so just pick that new calendar you made. Delete the files, there you go, you can now add alarms to them.\nDepending on how many birthdays you already have, you could write a script that would add an event to each of these individually, or (if you're like me and have so few bdays saved) do it manually. Once that's done, a folders action script would do the trick you're looking for.\non adding folder items to this_folder after receiving these_items\n    repeat with i from 1 to number of items in these_items\n        set this_item to item i of these_items\n        tell application \"finder\"\n            move this_item to --location specifier of folder for new bday calendar\n        end tell\n    end repeat\n    tell application \"ical\"\n        reload calendars\n        --add script here to add new alarms\n    end tell\nend on adding folder items to\n\nSorry, I don't have the exact code for you to add the alarm. Try this out though and let me know how it works!\n\nA: Address Book already coordinates with iCal to create events based on the date in any contact’s birthday field. If all you only need alarms, then you just need a way to add alarms to these events.\nThe catch is that iCal’s user interface presents the calendar as if it were read-only. But to AppleScript, the calendar is not actually read-only. You can use AppleScript to add alarms to the events in the “Birthdays” calendar:\non run\n    (* Warning:\n        This program will delete all the \"display alarms\" from the events in the\n        synthetic \"Birthdays\" calendar.

This program deletes all existing \"display alarms\" for all\n        birthdays and sets a new one for 13.5 days before the the event\n        (i.e. noon 14 days before, since the event occurs at midnight).\n    *)\n    tell application \"iCal\"\n        set bcName to \"Birthdays\"\n        set bc to a reference to calendar bcName\n        if not (exists bc) then\n            display alert \"No “\" & bcName & \"” calendar!\"\n            return\n        end if\n        repeat with e in events of contents of bc\n            -- make the following conditional if you only want alarms for some birthdays\n            tell e\n                delete display alarms\n                make new display alarm with properties {trigger interval:-13.5 * 24 * 60}\n            end tell\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nend run\n\nEvery time you run this program it will, effectively, make sure every birthday has an alarm on it.† It looks like Address Book makes only minimal changes when it updates a birthday event for a changed name or birthday date; the alarms persist across updates from Address Book, but this may not be reliable since Address Books “owns” these events and could completely delete and recreate them any time it felt the need to do so.\n\nI do not know of an official way to be notified of Address Book changes, but as the other answerer suggests, you might be able to hook up a Folder Action to the folder that holds the events for the “Birthdays” calendar. You can open that folder with this program:\ntell application \"iCal\" to set bcuid to uid of calendar \"Birthdays\"\npath to library folder from user domain\ntell application \"Finder\" to open folder \"Events\" of folder (bcuid & \".calendar\") of folder \"Calendars\" of result\n\nSince this is an internal detail, it may not be reliable across different OS versions. All of the above was developed and tested on Mac OS X 10.6.8.\nAlternatively, since the above program ensures every birthday has an alarm, you could just arrange to run it once a day or once at login (you can use an iCal event with a “Run Script” alarm, or save the program as an application and set it as a login item).\n\nCreating your own events (in your own calendar) is certainly possible, but keeping them synchronized with the birthday data can be tricky (lookup by “name and date” is usually not sufficient because the user could change either of those, and your “make alarms” program may not be able to determine the original values by the time it knows a particular contact has been updated with a new name or birthday date). Address Book solves this problem by encoding the contact’s internal, unique identifier into the URL it saves into each birthday event’s url property; since the calendar is “read-only” it does not have to worry about a user changing or deleting its special URLs, so it can rely on them being accurate.\n† We delete all existing alarms on the assumption that all the alarms are “ours” since Address Book does not add alarms on its own, and iCal does not let users add alarms.\nUnfortunately, there is no extra property where we could add any kind of unique identifier to the alarm itself (although if the exact time of the alarm is not important, it might be possible to encode some information in the numeric value of the alarm’s minute offset).\nIt seems easier to just delete the alarms and create exactly the one we want instead of checking any existing alarms to see if they match our current desired alarm setting. \n", "Q: How can I display Quicktime's \"New Movie Recording\" function in ASCII I wonder if anyone could master this one?\nSo Quicktime can play movies in ASCII mode as per the link below:\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#samplecode/ASCIIMoviePlayerSample/Introduction/Intro.html\nBut is it possible to view, through the webcam in Quicktime, the webcam video as ASCII art?\n\nA: Try ASCII Projektor\n\n… computer’s camera as well as from QuickTime files. …\n\n", "Q: Model number of iPhone 4S Officially Unlocked Can someone please tell me the model number (something like MC920LL) of their Officially unlocked iPhone 4S 16GB White, that Apple started selling since Nov 11.\nThere are various other contract-free phones available but they are not truly unlocked since there is a risk of being locked in the future maybe.\nSo if anyone has bought the OFFICIALLY unlocked white or black iPhone 4S from apple directly, can you PLEASE share the model number?\nMany thanks!\n\nA: The model number doesn't have anything to do with whether the phone is locked or not.

I'd assume that, seeing you're coming from a Windows environment, you simply don't understand Unix sockets.\nAn Unix socket file is created when mysqld is started up, and mysql.sock is that file.

As if the file had no permissions at all. \nThis occured to me while I was trying to write some stuff in the hosts file.\nI tried to manually chmod the file but I got an \"operation not allowed\".\n\nA: The /etc directory on a mac isn't a directory at all, it's a symlink (shortcut). It redirects to private/etc.\nYou won't be able to chmod the directory, because it belongs to the root user by default. If you want to chmod it you'll have to prefix the command with 'sudo' to run as the superuser.\nBearing that in mind, make sure you know what you're doing before you start playing around with system directories and their permissions.\n\nA: You can use the old unix comand line chmod\nchmod 777 ./folder\n\nWith 777 you permit your file or folder do all things for all peoples. Use\nman chmod\n\nto read the help.\n", "Q: Time Machine Backup to a Windows computer Is it possible to do a time machine backup from a MacBook Pro to a Windows 7 PC?\n(i.e. use Windows 7 as a time capsule)\n\nA: There was a lifehacker article on doing exactly this by creating a sparse HFS+ bundle on the Windows machines.  You could use a Linux machine or Amazon S3 using s3fs + encfs too. \nTime Machine requires an HFS+ filesystems backup disks like this sparse bundle because Time Machine uses Apple's unusual directory hard links.\nLinux could theoretically read the HTF+ sparse bundle but Windows sounds doubtful. \n", "Q: Is there a decent application for personal finances that support multiple currencies on OSX? I'd like to keep track of my finances better and wondering what good options there are out there. Preferably something that isn't geared towards Americans as my dollars tend to be Singapore ones and it'd be nice if also could track my finances in other countries in their native currency. :)\n\nA: iBank sure does:\n\nGo global. Just like your Mac, iBank works worldwide. With multi-currency support, you can set a default currency for any account, download exchange rates and calculate transfers between accounts automatically. iBank supports localization for British English, and now includes full French language support as well.\n\nMoneyWell does as well:\n\nTransaction-Level Exchange Rates\n  Do you bank in multiple currencies? MoneyWell has you covered. You can track your spending in your primary currency while having accounts in several other currencies and store both amounts in each transaction.\n\n\nA: Squirrel does as well. \nIt's got a clean interface and is easy to work with. If you're on Lion, you might want to grab the version from the Mac App Store (0.8.8 at the time of writing) instead, but that one does not currently support syncing with the iPhone version of Squirrel. iCloud based syncing will be in a coming update.\nThe version on the web site (0.8.7) has some small issues on Lion but can sync. It works like a charm on Snow Leopard.\n", "Q: How can I set the background image the same on all master slides without editing each master slide individually in Keynote? In PowerPoint the master slides have inheritance, so you can set common elements on all the master slides easily. I don't see anyway to do this in Keynote. For example, if I want to set the background image on all the master slides then I need to edit the background image on each master slide.\nHow to set the background image the same on all master slides without editing each master slide individually?\n\nA: Create a slide with the background you want, then copy that background. Go the master slides section, click on the master slide you are using, and paste the background onto the master slide. All your slides (that use that master slide) will have the same background.\n\nA: No, unfortunately there's no way to do such a thing (at least to my knowledge).\nHowever, a quite effective workaround is to select all the items you want to apply to other master slides, by clicking all the items with ⌘ or ⇧ down, then copy them (⌘C) and paste to all other master slides. Luckily, Keynote doesn't move pasted items when pasting on another slide (as opposed to what it does when pasting the same item on the same slide).\nRepetitive movement FTW:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the master slide that you just edited.\n\n*Hit ↓.\n\n*Hit ⌘V. \n\n*Loop.\n\n\nKind of ridiculous, but you can actually do it pretty fast  ;)\n(yes, it should be possible to automate this, but I don't feel like it's a common enough use-case to spend time writing an AppleScript)\n\nA: The latest version of Keynote does remember your gradient settings when setting the background on a master slide; so this makes it relatively painless to apply the same background to all the other slides.\n\nA: Drag down the handle at the top of the slide sidebar to reveal the master slides:\n\nFrom there it works the same as in PowerPoint.\n\nA: It appears the correct answer is I cannot do this unfortunately.\n\nA: yes you can. Click on a random master slide, right click=>select all with all slides being selected and then choose the background just like what you did to a single slide they will be all the same background then.\n\nA: Yes you an do it. Very simple,  select all the slides you want to change (shift click & highlight them)  Open inspector, slide tab, appearance , background and change the background. There is a drop down where you can change the colour, gradient, image etc.  \n", "Q: iMac 2011 - two external monitors I have an iMac from 2011 and there is already one external monitor connected via minidisplay port to dvi adapter. Today I wanted to connect another one, as the iMac features 2 minidisplay/thunderbolt ports. I bought a second adapter and hoped it would work just as easy – plug in and done. But the screen of that monitor stayed black, nothing happened at all. Do I need another adapter? Some additional software?\n\nA: I believe you would like to take a look at this Endgadget link that explains (even with a video) what you need.\nIf you have two Thunderbolt ports (only the 27inch iMac), then those can support two external displays (confirmed by Apple, you can google that). \n(this has been also asked on SuperUser)\n", "Q: Can I upgrade from 10.6 to 10.7 for free? When I bought my new Mac at the end of July, 2011, the dealer (Microcenter, Marietta, GA) Renee told me I had 4 months to upgrade to Lion. I calendared the drop dead date at the end of November, and now discover I only had 30 days.  \nIs there a way to upgrade for free at this time?\n\nA: Apple's policy is that you get an OS upgrade for free as soon as the launch date of the new OS has been officially announced. For Lion, this was after July 21st. However, as you discovered yourself:\n\nRemember your completed order must be entered within 30 days of the date of your purchase of a qualifying computer.\n\nSo no, you won't be able to get anything from Apple's up-to-date program, which is the only way to get an OS upgrade for free.\n", "Q: How can I move a photo from iPad Camera Roll to another Album? I've learned how to copy photos from Camera Roll (iPad 2 with iOS 5) to new or existing albums. Is it possible to move photos to new or existing albums from Camera Roll?\n\nA: No, not straight from the iPad. The Camera Roll is like a smart folder: it contains all items that were stored as pictures on the iPad from apps. You can't move pictures from there to another album, just like you can't move songs from the iTunes library to playlist.\nHowever, if you import the pictures on your computer, then delete it from the iPad (you didn't specify your OS there, but assuming Mac OS X: with iPhoto, it simply asks you whether you'd like to do so after the import is over), syncing the pictures that were in the Camera Roll back onto the iPad will make them appear only in the albums you've configured on your computer, not in the Roll anymore (since they were not added from the iPad).\n", "Q: iPad photos missing from folder view in Windows I have my iPad plugged into my Windows 7 computer, and I can see the Internal Storage of the iPad but most of the photos are missing. I have many different albums on the iPad and none of them are visible inside explorer view. How can I get these photos off my iPad?\n\nA: You can only access photos in your camera roll via USB, I suspect you added those other albums via iTunes (as opposed to created them on you device with iOS 5). There is no official way to get those photos off your device. \n\n\n*\n\n*You can try to find an app that can access your photos and save them to your camera roll (e.g. Photoshop Express, free). This might be a lot a work depending on how many photos you need to copy.\n\n*You could use Dropbox to upload your photos to their servers and download them on your PC. You'll need an dropbox account, but up to 2GB is free. Dropbox allows you to select multiple photos to upload at once.\n\n*If your device is jailbroken you can get access to the filesystem and copy your phones that way.\n\n", "Q: G5 wakes up for no apparent reason I’ve got a very odd problem with an old G5 of mine. It's a 2.3GHz Dual-Core G5 with Mac OS X 10.5.8. Sometimes, though not always (about 50/50), when putting the computer to sleep, it wakes up after a couple of seconds. This is really puzzling and I just can’t figure out what the problem is. I've had this computer for many years now, and it started just recently, but I can't pinpoint the exact time.\nSo far, I can rule out the following potential causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wake for ethernet network administrator access (turned on or off, doesn’t matter)\n\n*Any network traffic - the problem can occur when the G5 is not connected to the network\n\n*External USB hubs (none connected)\n\n*Bluetooth (doesn’t have BT)\n\n*Modem (doesn’t have one)\n\n*Software (clean installation of OS X: same problem)\n\n*Keyboard or Mouse waking it up - the problem can even occur when none are connected and I put it to sleep via SSH\n\n*Graphics card/monitor: problem can occur when there is no monitor connected and I put the G5 to sleep via SSH.\n\n*Power fluctuations\n\n\nThe logs don’t help me. The Wake event is always 0020, regardless whether it's an intentional wake or not.\nWhen the G5 woke up, I can put it back to sleep and then it will stay in sleep mode. So it’s no big deal but I still would love to know what the problem is.\nEdit (21-June-2012): Thank you all for your suggestions and pointers. Unfortunately my G5 recently had a failing power supply, and it won't wake up from that anymore.\n\nA: Have you tried Reseting the SMU\n\nThe SMU (System Management Unit) is a microcontroller chip on the logic board that controls all power functions for your computer. If your computer is experiencing any issues regarding these functions, resetting the SMU may resolve the issue. The functions controlled by the SMU include:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*It tells the computer when to turn on, turn off, sleep, wake, idle, and so on.\n  \n*It handles system resets from various commands.\n  \n*It controls the fan.\nNote that resetting the SMU does not reset the PRAM.\n\n\nSteps to reset the SMU on:\n\nPower Mac G5 (Late 2005)\nTo reset the SMU on a Power Mac G5 (Late 2005) computer, either use the steps listed above for the Power Mac G5 (Late 2004) or:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Turn off the computer by selecting Shut Down from the Apple menu or\n  by holding the power button until the computer turns off.\n  \n*Open and remove both the metallic outer door and the inner plastic\n  air deflector.\n  \n*Remove the fan assembly immediately to the left of the processor\n  module.\n  \n*Press the SMU reset button on the logic board.\n  \n*Replace the fan assembly, air deflector, and outer door.\n  \n*Turn on the computer.\nThe SMU reset button is located underneath the lower bank of system memory slots, as shown below:\n\nUnlike earlier models of Power Mac G5 or Power Mac G4 computers, the Power Mac G5 (Late 2004) and (Late 2005) models do not have a PMU. This functionality has been replaced by the SMU.\n\n\nA: Check Schedule in the Energy Saver preference panel.\n\nA: The \"Zombie Wake-Up\".  I have an intel iMac that does the same thing.  If I sleep it from the keyboard with ShiftCmdEject, it's likely to wake up again in a couple of seconds.  In fact, it will be exactly one \"breathing\" cycle of the power light if it's going to do it at all.\nApple tried replacing the IR sensor board, then the whole main board, and then blamed my environment and asked (told!) me not to bring it back again.  I found if I sleep it from the Apple menu, it doesn't re-awaken.  I haven't tested it using hot-corners, but I'm guessing that would be equally effective.\n\nA: Try checking the G5's internal clock battery. It is located to the left of the SMU button. Since the machine is from 2005-2006 it may be going bad and not be able to maintain proper voltage, which may be causing the SMU, PRAM, or other settings to become corrupt and maybe cause the random waking from sleep to show up as a side effect.\n\nA: Without any additional information, it's difficult to say specifically what is causing the issue.  It could be any of the other issues mentioned here, but to make sure, go into terminal and use pmset -g log for more information.\n\nA: Got a question, your computer, was it part of the logic board fault issues, and was it ever replaced? I only ask because this was a known issue with the logic boards. \nIf not, then there are three things I'd try.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset the PR Ram.\n\n*Check to see if your prefs are set to wake up for any reason whatsoever, you may be having your computer do it's daily checkup for updates at that time and not know it.\n\n*If you are running OS X, as you are, around that time CHRON jobs are activated. Your computer may be waking up to do them, this also comes into play of point 2, so you may need to just check extra carefuly in your prefs to make sure that nothing is accidently activating the computer without you knowing about it. \n\n\nA: Apple provide the following list of possible reasons for Mac OS X 10.7, aka Lion, not sleeping or staying asleep:\nOS X Lion: If your Mac computer won’t go to sleep or stay in sleep\n\nIf your Mac doesn’t go to sleep when you expect it to, or if it wakes\n  up unexpectedly, you may need to change your sleep preferences or\n  something may be waking your computer.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Make sure your computer’s sleep settings are set the way you want. In Energy Saver preferences, use the slider that controls the\n  computer’s sleep.\n  \n*Other users may be waking your computer remotely to use its shared resources. If you don’t want this to happen, open Energy Saver\n  preferences and deselect “Wake for network access.”\n  \n*Bluetooth devices can wake your computer. If you don’t want a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse to be able to wake the computer, open\n  Bluetooth preferences, click Advanced, and then deselect “Allow\n  Bluetooth devices to wake this computer.”\n  \n*Key presses and mouse or trackpad clicks can wake your computer. If your computer wakes when you’re not present, something may be\n  pressing the mouse button or keyboard.\n  \n*Applications that access a disk can keep your computer from going to sleep. For example, iTunes accesses your disk to read the songs it\n  plays, and DVD Player accesses the optical disc drive to play movies.\n  \n*People using shared services on your computer can prevent it from sleeping. For example, they may be using a printer connected to your\n  computer or accessing shared files stored on it. In Sharing\n  preferences, turn off any services you don’t need to use by\n  deselecting the On checkbox next to the service.\n  \n*If Spotlight is indexing your hard disk, your computer won’t go to sleep. Click the Spotlight icon on the right side of the menu bar and\n  check whether it says it’s indexing. Indexing your files can take\n  several hours, depending on the number of files on your computer.\n  \n*Malfunctioning USB, FireWire, and Thunderbolt devices may keep your computer from going to sleep. Disconnect your USB, FireWire, and\n  Thunderbolt devices and see if your computer goes to sleep. If it\n  does, reconnect each device, one at a time, until you find the one\n  that’s malfunctioning. Contact that device’s manufacturer for more\n  information.\n  \n*Some PCI extension cards intentionally prevent a computer from going to sleep. Refer to the documentation that came with your card.\n  \n\n\nA: Try to delete the .plist file below as the root user. Below is the steps needed to create a backup of the file in case you need it later and delete the file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal\n\n*su root\n\n*cd /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration\n\n*cp com.apple.PowerManagement.plist com.apple.PowerManagement.plist.bak\n\n*rm com.apple.PowerManagement.plist\n\n\nReboot your system to make sure the changes take effect.\n", "Q: What's the correctly way to make Postfix run permanently on Lion (not server) I can start Postfix temporarily with: \n$ sudo launchctl\nlaunchd% start org.postfix.master\n\nHowever, Console.app shows that it only runs for a short time:\n26/11/11 2:00:55.710 PM postfix/master: master exit time has arrived\n\nI think the file  /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist needs to be updated to make Postfix run permanently, but I haven't found the answer yet. \nWhat's the correct way of getting Postfix starting at boot time and running permanently?\nUpdate\nIn order to edit the file as recommended by the selected answer, I first converted it to XML.  \nplutil  -convert xml1 /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist\n\nThen just edited it with Vim: \nsudo vim /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist\n\nI had issues trying to get Xcode to edit the file. \n\nA: The following changes worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the following two elements from /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist:\n\n<string>-e</string>\n<string>60</string>\n\n\nThis will stop it exiting after 60 seconds.\n\n*Add the following element as a child of the <dict>...</dict> element in the same plist file:\n\n<key>KeepAlive</key>\n<true/>\n\n\n\n*Reload the file:\n\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist \nsudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist\n\n\npostfix should now be running as a daemon.\nThe above works on Mountain Lion, Mavericks, Yosemite and El Capitan. For systems that have System Integrity Protection (El Capitan and later) there are two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copying /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist to /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.custom.plist, changing org.postfix.master to org.postfix.custom and then unloading and loading as above.\n\n*Disabling SIP (using csrutil), making the edits and then re-enabling SIP.\n\n\nNote: With High Sierra and Mojave, the configuration file is com.apple.postfix.master.plist instead of org.postfix.custom.plist.\n", "Q: Can I create a boot disk for 10.6 or 10.7 on a PC (to be used on a Mac?) I have a Macbook Pro that had a hard drive failure, I've replaced the hard drive but I don't have a boot disk of any kind.  I could just order a Snow Leopard DVD, but I have to wait a few days for this.  So I'm wondering if it would be possible to download either Snow Leopard or Lion to a DVD from a PC that I have access to, that I could then use as a boot disk on the Mac.  Is this possible?\n\nA: Is it humanly possible, if you received an ISO from some source, that you could create a burnable disc from a PC? Yes, no reason why not.\nThat being said, if you have upgraded the firmware on a recent-enough MacBook Pro, and have a fast enough connection to pull down a OS install disc, you could use internet recovery:\nApple's Knowledge Base Article for Internet Recovery-Capable Macs\nI believe this won't work if you hadn't run this updater on your Mac after already upgrading to Lion, but it would pull down a recovery partition of less than a GB first, from which you could at least browse the web with the 'get help online' Safari Kiosk mode, or go on to do a full reinstall.\nBeyond the 10.6 disc, there is also a USB drive for Lion that can be purchased as well, of course. Good luck\n\nA: The Mac OS is copyrighted and Apple does not give it away.  It comes with a Mac when you buy the Mac, but otherwise you have to buy it.  Thus there is no legal way for you to get a copy without paying for it.  Apple only supports downloadable software purchases via the AppStore, which only runs on Macs so far.  So no, there's no legal way for you to download the OS on a PC.  That said, you can probably find an illegal copy of an install DVD somewhere.\nDon't you have the DVD that came with your MacBook Pro? That's the normal way to recover.  I guess you're not near an AppleStore, either, or you could go there and have them install Lion on your MBP.\nDo you have a TimeMachine backup?  Some other kind of backup?  If you had a Carbon Copy Cloner backup then you could boot from that.\n\nA: Yes, technically you can create a Mac OSX boot disk on a PC. For Lion, you will need the image, a file named InstallESD.dmg (which can be written using something like UltraISO).\nYou can acquire the needed file either by downloading the Lion installer from the Mac App Store (requires a Mac initially, you can copy the files to a PC afterwards) or downloading the file from other sources (hint:torrents).\nLegally you should be covered in most jurisdiction since installing Lion requires your purchased it (and usually you are entitled to own a backup copy) but you know you shouldn't get legal advice from the Internet.\n\nA: If you own your legal copies of software, then you can use Alcohol in Windows, or Daemon tools, or even Nero (Nero is tricky) to do a 1:1 burn from your DVD into the HD, or from a HD into a DVD.\nYou can also buy MacDrive for Windows to look into HFS+ disks, specially double optical disks with different files viewable depending if you insert the CD or DVD into a Windows or a Mac computer.\nI once had a mac with a broken optical drive (this works in MacBook air too), you can copy your free linux or any other boot disk into a blank external HD, or even a flash drive (they are extremely fast) and boot your mac with holding the Option (Alt) key, boot img will show up in the white screen.\nThis link has pretty much all the info you need for copying CDs in windows.\nhttp://www.tomshardware.com/forum/243423-32-image-flash\nI believe I can trust that you will assume responsibility over your actions, and that you own all the licenses to the software you want to copy.\nI am just giving information here.

I tried turning it on in the \"Preferences >> Date and Time\" section but I'm not able to.\nAnyone got similar problems/found a solution to this?\nIf there's any additional information I can provide you, please let me know. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: It's possible com.apple.menuextra.clock.plist located in your user /Users/yourShortNameHere/Library/Preferences is corrupted. \nClose the System Preferences window. Move that plist out of its directory, and re-launch the System Preferences.\nFeedback if it doesn't work.\n\nA: Try launching the menu extra “by hand”. It is located in /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Clock.menu. Try double-clicking that file.\nIf that does not solve the problem, then launch the Console (in /Applications/Utilities/) and look for something like:\nSystemUIServer[205] failed to instantiate and get the principal class of bundle: NSBundle </System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Clock.menu> (not yet loaded)\n\n(anything that mentions Clock.menu actually — should be at the end of the log files)\n\nA: If the above suggestions doesn't work, I recommend you try creating a fresh new user and reboot/login from there to see if this fixes the issue. There might be a problem with your specific user.\nAlso what do you exactly mean by: \"but I am not able to\". What happens when you check the \"show date and time\" checkbox?\n\nA: Maybe you can restore your permissions? You can find here how to do this. This will return your original permissions by factory settings. Maybe, the problem is caused by something you've done before.\nOr you can try and reset your PRAM. It's not really the part which controls the time-management, but it does manage the disk-cache and some additional time-settings. \nMaybe the problem will be solved after those two tips.\n\nA: In Finder, open the Go -> Go To Folder menu item.

Your computer has a small battery on the motherboard that is supposed to last about 4-5 years. If this battery runs down, the date/time will not be stored. This is a long shot though, as I cannot remember the last time I had this problem - 8 years?\nSo, if the solutions above do not work, and especially the great suggestion to create a new user, the only recourse left (and it may be a good idea under the circumstances**), is to perform an clean reinstallation of your system.\nI presume you have your 10.6.x disk.

I'm trying to download the X-Plane 10 Demo through uTorrent, however I get a \"too many open files\" error all the time. I can do the alternate download (which takes forever and a day), but I wonder how I can increase the setting in Lion?\nI found conflicting information about it, some say that ulimit -n and sysctl are the tools of choice, while others report that launchctl is correct.\nThe reported value for ulimit -n is 256, same for launchctl limit:\ncpu         unlimited      unlimited      \nfilesize    unlimited      unlimited      \ndata        unlimited      unlimited      \nstack       8388608        67104768       \ncore        0              unlimited      \nrss         unlimited      unlimited      \nmemlock     unlimited      unlimited      \nmaxproc     709            1064           \nmaxfiles    256            unlimited      \n\n\nA: Basically ulimit controls resources available to the shell and its processes, where launchctl controls maximum resources to the system and its processes.\nFor the current shell, limit of maximum open files can be changed by: ulimit -n 10240.\nNote: You can use extra -S parameter for a soft or -H for the hard limit.\nIf shell limit cannot be changed, then you need to use the launchctl command first, e.g.\nsudo launchctl limit maxfiles 10240 unlimited\n\nTo change the kernel limits, run: sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=10240.\nFurther reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which command controls the open file limits?\n\n*How to persistently control maximum system resource consumption on Mac?\n\n*How to add persist shell ulimit settings on Mac?\n\nA: The following should resolve most solutions (and are listed in order of their hierarchy):\necho 'kern.maxfiles=20480' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\necho -e 'limit maxfiles 8192 20480\\nlimit maxproc 1000 2000' | sudo tee -a /etc/launchd.conf\necho 'ulimit -n 4096' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You will need to restart for these changes to take effect.\n\n*AFAIK you can no longer set limits to 'unlimited' under OS X\n\n*launchctl maxfiles are bounded by sysctl maxfiles, and\ntherefore cannot exceed them\n\n*sysctl seems to inherit kern.maxfilesperproc from launchctl\nmaxfiles\n\n*ulimit seems to inherit it's 'open files' value from\nlaunchctl by default\n\n*you can set a custom ulimit within /etc/profile, or\n~/.profile ; while this isn't required I've provided an example\n\n*Be cautious when setting any of these values to a very high number when compared with their default - the features exist stability/security.  I've taken these example numbers that I believe to be reasonable, written on other websites. \n\n*When launchctl limits are lower than the sysctl ones, there have been reports that the relevent sysctl ones will be bumped up automatically to meet the requirements.\n\n\nA: You could increase the maximum opened files by running ulimit -n 1024 and launching uTorrent from the command line.  In my case, I would launch Transmission using the command :\n/Applications/Transmission.app/Contents/MacOS/Transmission\n\nYou must launch the torrent application from the shell where you invoked ulimit, your changes have no effect otherwise, well isolating the changes is the advantage of ulimit. \n", "Q: Weird message appeared, like spam, black screen, green button?

This was done by selecting the group in the groups column and choosing Edit → Edit Distribution List…\nIn the (horrible) Lion Address Book, the feature is still in the Edit menu, but I can't figure out why it's always dimmed. What are the circumstances when this menu item should become available, or how can I choose the addresses for my contact groups in Lion?\n\nA: Only local groups (appearing in On My Mac) support distribution lists. This feature won't work if you're only using Exchange, a CardDAV server, or iCloud.\nHere's a cnet article about this, with regard to iCloud: http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-20126108-263/address-book-distribution-list-editor-disabled-by-icloud/\n", "Q: How to display (small) image previews at actual size? After upgrading to Lion, I'm finding that Finder is stretching the preview of smaller images (~100 pixels), which is making them look terrible.\nIs there a setting somewhere I can check to have small images show at actual size?\n\nA: You can press the space bar to open Quicklook; it opens quite fast, and you can still use the arrow buttons to navigate through your images.\n\nA: In the Preview bar, click 'Enter Full Screen' which is underneath slideshow.This will let you view the images in their actual size with the nice black background. It's basically the 'Slideshow' function from OSX Snow Leopard.\n", "Q: How can I get tracks from another iTunes library onto my iPhone without wiping it? I got  a bunch of audiobooks on a different Mac then my own (to which I don't have access at the present moment). I want to get them onto my iPhone without erasing stuff from my iPhone. How can I do that?\n\nA: GoodReader for iPhone ($5) will let you load files directly to your iPhone over your LAN and play them from there. That should work fine if your audiobooks are a) all one file (if they are in multiple files there may not be 'playlist' support, which would be annoying, and b) not DRM'd. If they are DRM'd you'll need to sync them via iTunes or, in the case of Audible.com, you can download them from the Audible player.\n\nA: Copy the files from the iTunes Library where the files can be found to the Library that your iPhone is synced to and sync your iPhone.\nYou can add files to an iTunes Library by going to the top-left and clicking 'add file to library'\n", "Q: Youtube streaming slowly on iPad I am facing issues streaming Youtube videos on iPad (using the native Youtube app)\nMy connection speed is 3.1 Mbps, which I guess is decent for video streaming. Also I agree that I would not get the full 3.1 Mbps and would only get about 1/3rd. So I get around 1 Mbps based on speedtest.\nNow what should I do to fix the Youtube streaming and is it a known issue with speed limits for the Youtube app ?\nThank you.\n\nA: This is sometimes a problem when there are a large number of apps open at once, or the iPad is otherwise running low on memory. \nI have an iPad 1, and unless I set the quality fairly low, there is no guarantee I will get a decent viewing experience.\nTo try and fix this, first close all apps but youtube, then, if that doesn't work, reboot your device.\n\nA: I frequently have this problem with YouTube (old iOS native app and googles official version). And  I have a 20Mb connection. I have just replaced the official app with a free alternative called Jasmine from the AppStore and its so much quicker. Prior to this I was using the mobile website, which was also quite a bit quicker. \n", "Q: Reminders app doesn't show badges I have a love-hate relationship with the new Reminders app in iOS 5. \nI like how entering new items is made simple and the interface gradually reveals itself as you become more of a power user. Yet it fails at the most fundamental function—to remind me the important stuff that I entered. \nHow do I enable badges for due items in Reminders? I couldn't find the setting in Notifications preferences. \nDoes Reminders app support badges at all?\n\nA: Unfortunately, it doesn't appear to, no: the Reminders app has neither its own  pane in the Settings app, nor any settings accessible in the app itself, and its entry under Notifications doesn't have an option to turn on Badges.\nSo, at least as of iOS 5.0.1, Reminders doesn't seem to support that feature.\nI'm not seriously suggesting you switch apps, but if Badges in a todo app is a killer feature, I've also been a fan of Things.\n\nA: Recent iOS versions (at least 8 onwards) all support badges. The Notifications part of Settings allow you to control them in the same way as other apps.\nHowever, it does appear that the app is a little buggy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Completion status often does not sync to other devices (often refreshing the Calendar app by pulling down on the list of calendars fixes this).\n\n*Some reminders show on the lock screen (if enabled) but do not show a badge. My experience is that this only happens with location-based reminders.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to prevent those pesky .DS_Store files from being ever created? Is there a way (eg. a binary hack into Finder) to stop it from creating .DS-Stores on LOCAL Volumes? \nI am using Leopard, therefore these don't work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Asepsis (requires Lion)\n\n*TotalFinder (requires Snow Leopard)\n\n\nAlso, BlueHarvest slows down my computer.\n\nA: To prevent those ugly .DS_Store files from showing up there seems to be a relatively new option to do this cleanly, not only for network drives, like:\ndefaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores -bool true\n\nbut also for USB-connected volumes:\ndefaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteUSBStores -bool true\n\nRelative to the OPs question title, this is the best solution without hacks, since it addresses not only the network misbehaviour but is also effected  for most connected disks. And those might be the biggest annoyance for most users sharing devices like USB sticks between different environments. It uses only Apple provided options and doesn't interfere with normal operation in any way.\nRelative to the concrete situation explained in the OPs body it is of limited value, since this USB option is only available in later versions of OS X/macOS. Further, this still does not address the problem of .DS_Store creation on internal disks, where they can be also a hassle to deal with. Although in that place they might actually serve some kind of purpose.\nA more comprehensive solution to this problem, albeit a more hackish one, that works on most versions of the Mac operating system is as follows:\nTo completely nuke this nasty behaviour on all disks – and with a binary patcher/code injector like the question of the OP longs for – there is DeathToDSStore / with source. \nBoth of these options assume that anyone still uses Finder…\nUsing a different file manager would also solve this problem.\nThere are numerous contenders to replace Finder for file management on macOS. Two of the top dogs in this field are Pathfinder or XFile.\n\nA: I haven't found any way to keep them from being created, but you can delete them automatically with a script:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nfind ~ -name .DS_Store -exec /bin/rm -f -- {} \\;\n\nexit 0\n\nRun it every X minutes via launchd or cron. It takes almost no time to run on my several-year-old iMac. It will only search your $HOME (~) but that's where most of them will be. Change ~ to / if you want to delete them across the entire drive, but that will take much longer to run, so adjust the frequency accordingly.\n\nA: Try this command in terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true\n\nIt seems to work for me.\n\nA: Third party solutions\nIn my experience, BlueHarvest is best in class. Technically, it is not an answer to the question; it can remove but not prevent .DS_Store files. \nIf BlueHarvest is effective but does not suit your use case, it becomes difficult to give an acceptable answer to your question. \nIf you have no acceptable third party solution, then you must work with what's integral to Leopard …\nWithout a third party solution: restrain your use of Finder\nBy avoiding the views that you do not wish to save, you can prevent creation of .DS_Store files. \nMost users will find it difficult to restrain themselves in this way, but it's a true answer within the limitations of the question. \nhttp://diigo.com/0qiwp for an annotated view of http://lists.apple.com/archives/applescript-users/2006/Jun/msg00180.html where Matt Deatherage (a former engineer at Apple) explains .DS_Store and other types of file. \n\nA: I had the same problem, and solutions to prevent those annoying files on the local mounted disk did not work for me.\nIn the end I have found a suitable solution, which is to periodically search and remove these files on the local mounted disk only. I added a cronjob with the following content:\n9 */1 * * * find -x ~ -path /Users/adietz/Library -prune -o -fstype local  -name .DS_Store -print -exec /bin/rm -f -- {} \\; >> ~/.cron.log 2>&1\n\nHere is what it means:\n\n*\n\n*9 */1 * * * performs the command every 9 minutes after the hour (so 10:09, 11:09, 12:09, ...)\n\n*find -x ... -fstype local (optional) Perform the search only on the local mounted file system and ignore any other mounted disk under ~\n\n*~ the folder to search (home folder)\n\n*-path /Users/user/Library -prune -o (optional) expression to NOT look in the Library folder (which might throw Input/Output errors).\n\n*-name .DS_Store the file name to look for\n\n*-print (optional) print a found occurrence\n\n*-exec /bin/rm -f -- {} \\; remove the file\n\n*>> ~/.cron.log 2>&1 (optional) Adds the output to a file, so you can check that it works, and where the annoying files have been removed\n\n\nA: EDIT: apparently no longer works in newer macOS versions\nI've made a more efficient script (intended to be run continuously as daemon), it'll do one execution of find at the beginning to wipe already existing files and it'll catch new files in real time via fsevents. So they will be nuked immediately as they are created, and resource usage is very low. AFAIK this is the best possible way to get rid of them without disabling SIP.\nHere it is — https://github.com/magicgoose/DS_Store-Kill\n", "Q: iPad Safari Delete Website Data Off late, the Safari on my iPad has become a bit slow.

Or any other options ?\nIt would be great if my form autocomplete data and website history (shown in address bar) do not get deleted. I guess the Clear History/Cookies would do that.\nPlease suggest.\n\nA: Open the settings application.\nSelect Safari from the left bar, from there you can press \"Clear Cookies and Data\"\nIt will not clear your history.\nBut cleaning cookies will make you login again to web sites you use.\nYou can go to Advanced, Website Data to see which sites store information on your iPad (mostly cookies).\n", "Q: Is there a way to play Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force on a modern Mac? I have a mid-2010 (Intel) MacBook Pro, and I’m nostalgic for Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force, which was released in the early 2000s (!). At some point there was a freely-downloadable Carbon version to allow people who already owned the game to play it under then-current versions of Mac OS X, but as far as I know there hasn’t been any development recently. Can anyone think of some way I might be able to get the game running again?\n\nA: Running Snow Leopard in a virtual machine will run PPC and some carbon apps on a Lion Mac. \nYou can also install Snow Leopard onto another drive (external or partition) and boot to 10.6 I that's all you need for that app. \n\nA: The Multiplayer is playable on Intel Macs with this binary: http://thilo.kickchat.com/efport-progress/bin/macosx/\nUnfortunately I can't find something for the Single Player.\nEdit: It is also just 32 bit and won't run on macOS 10.15 Catalina or later.\n\nA: I was able to make the single player version of the game work on a Core Duo MacBook running Mac OS 10.4.11. The problem is if you try to save the game the entire computer would crash. The game crashes immediately when using the same computer on Mac OS 10.5. On a Core 2 Duo MacBook Pro running Mac OS 10.6 the game will load but crashes the entire system if you try to save a game.\nI have two theories on how to play this game on a modern Mac.\n\n*\n\n*Download the playstation 2 version of the game and play it in an emulator.\n\n*Buy the good old games version and try to play it using WINE.\n\n", "Q: How can I get iTunes to recognize my iPhone 4S again without having to re-configure all my apps? I have an iPhone 4S that I have bought directly from Apple. I used iTunes on my very old (2006) Mac to set it up and do the initial sync. After that, I did an OTA firmware update and several OTA syncs without problems. I also set it up to perform iCloud backups. When I next tried to connect the phone to iTunes about a week later, the connection felt rather flaky (the phone appeared and disappeared a few times), so I ran the recommended iTunes update.\nI reconnected my phone, and iTunes greeted me with a \"Set up your iPhone\" screen, which offered me the choice of \"restoring from backup\" (to my knowledge and from the dates offered, this only refers to the backups iTunes has made, not iCloud), and \"setting up as a new iPhone\" or something to that end.\nI did some research and found that some people had that same problem, but said it went away when the allowed it to set up as a new iPhone, which, as they said, would do nothing and everything would be good afterwards. Well, they were right that it did nothing to my phone, but now all those checkmarks (\"sync music\", \"sync contacts\", most importantly: \"sync apps\") are unchecked. If I re-check any of them, the program makes it quite clear to me that first, everything on my phone will be wiped, and then being installed as instructed. I.e. if I did this with my apps, I believe all my settings would be lost and I would have to set all of them up again.\nI even went to the \"Genius Bar\" today and explained all this. The answer was this: reset your iPhone to factory settings, connect to iTunes to make it recognize it again, then restore from iCloud (where both all app settings and the screen layouts are stored).\nSounded reasonable back there, but when I tried this, I found this little problem:\nYou can only restore to a fresh device from iCloud, but iTunes will either want to set it up for me first (so it's no longer fresh after that), or, if we do an iCloud restore, it goes back to showing me the settings with all checkboxes unchecked.\nMaybe I just overlooked one crucial little detail, but I don't see it, so...\nwhat can I do to remedy this?\n\nI know the easy way out is to just wipe the phone and install again from iTunes, but what bothers me is that this disconnect can happen to me again and again - I don't want to wipe my phone and reconfigure all my apps every time this happens. So that's why I'm looking for the \"right\" solution, rather than the \"quick and dirty\" one. \n\nA: Coincidentally, that happened to me just one week ago when Wifi sync died en route. The solution is simple, but totally non-intuitive: do the exact opposite of what feels right, and all will be well (not exactly Apple’s finest hour in UI intuitiveness):\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose “set up as new phone” on the initial screen. In the dialog that pop ups give your phone the name it had before (important – if your case is similar to mine, it will be pre-filled). This will re-register the phone with iTunes sync.\n\n*Your phone will do an initial sync with all sync options (music, movies, ebooks etc.) disabled except apps, which are set to “sync all” (if you have a lot of apps in iTunes you are not usually syncing to your phone, the initial sync will flood your phone with these. Delete them out of iTunes beforehand, or from the iPhone after the initial sync). Apps already on the phone will not be overwritten and won’t lose their settings.\n\n*At this point, all media will still be both in Tunes and on the phone, but not in a synchronized state. Re-check all your sync settings. Acknowledge the “all media on this phone will be deleted” warning. Don’t fret: as long as you are syncing with the same iTunes library as before, nothing will be deleted in the next step.\n\n*Trigger a sync manually. iTunes will compare what is on the iPhone and what it is meant to sync, and will not re-transfer media already on your phone. Once done, both media libraries will be in sync again. One gotcha though: make sure the downsample setting on the first option page is set as it was before (i.e. on if you downsample music to 128 Kb/s in sync, off otherwise), or you music will be re-synced because bitrates do not match – quite a pain if you have a large library.\n\n\nAfter that, your phone will be back ins sync without undue hassle (i.e. worrying about out of date backups in iTunes, iCloud restore etc.). \n", "Q: Install MAMP (not PRO) For PHP And Mail Sending I first tried searching here at apple.stack but couldn't find a solution that seemed to work for me, so I'm trying my hand at posting a question. I already spent a few good hours trying to make it work, since I overall would like to keep using MAMP (again, not MAMP PRO) instead of switching to another package that might give me more road blocks..\nHistory:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm a total newbie to Apple's OS.\n\n*I have recently moved to using a macbook pro with Lion OS installed for my PHP development.\n\n*I had come to a point in my development where I now have to send mail. \n\n*I created a gmail account since the project I am working on hasn't got a name yet so no domains have been purchased (meaning no other smtp server to use)\n\n*I installed MAMP (not PRO) and have been programming on the macbook pro up to this point\n\n*I have installed pear using: http://blog.stealth35.com/2011/07/27/install-pear-on-osx-lion.html\n\n*Then after following the advice: You may want to add: /usr/lib/php/pear to your php.ini include_path I have modified:\ninclude_path = \".:/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.3.6/lib/php\"\nto\ninclude_path = \".:/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.3.6/lib/php:/usr/lib/php/pear\"\nin this file: /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.3.6/conf/php.ini\n\n*I restarted the MAMP server and performed the test:\n<?php\nrequire_once 'System.php';\nvar_dump(class_exists('System', false));\n?>\nAnd got a bool(true) response.\n\n*When trying out the example here: http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php code at post: roberto dot silva at mexicoshipping dot net 24-Jan-2004 12:16\n\n*And still.. nothing.. roberto's post ended up giving me the following:\nWarning: include(Mail.php) [function.include]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/signupemailtest.php on line 24\nWarning: include() [function.include]: Failed opening 'Mail.php' for inclusion (include_path='/usr/lib/php/pear') in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/signupemailtest.php on line 24\nLine 24: include(\"Mail.php\");\nWhich makes sense, because I can't seem to find the file Mail.php anywhere.\nHas anyone experienced this and found a solution for it?

When using Siri to send an email to a contact with multiple email addresses, I can't find a way to select one of the addresses in a hands-free way (without clicking with my finger).

I've tried just saying the domain of the address, \"one\", \"the first one\", the entire email address, but none of them work.\n\nA: Ok this is what i saw when i asked SIRI to send a mail to a contact with multiple address, i then chose 'Home' and siri asked me what should she send!. It was pretty straight forward IMHO, so i suggest you try to disable/enable SIRI, if that doesn't work, then i think you will have to restore iOS option. Hope this helps mate \n\n\nA: When you are looking at the Contact information on the iPhone, tap 'Edit' (top right corner).\nThen tap the label next to the email address for that contact, and you should see this:\n\nIf you tap that Edit button (shown here; again, top right), you can choose \"+ Add Custom Label\" to make your own.\n(That's how it works for .Mac/MobileMe/iCloud and Gmail/Google Apps, I assume it is the same for Outlook.)\nSiri definitely uses those labels when choosing which email address to use.\n\n(Aside: I have actually gone through many of my contacts and if I have more than one email address for them, I put the primary one in the email field, and move the other to the \"Notes\" in case it stops working. Ditto for phone numbers. If I always call you on your cell phone, or always call your work number, the other numbers move to the notes section.

In Lion Server Admin, under DHCP settings, it is possible to see a list of \"Clients\", but for me this list is nearly always empty, except in the rare occasions when I allow a machine on my network that is not statically mapped. Is it in fact the case that statically mapped IP addresses are not listed under \"Clients\" by default? Is there a way to see currently connected, statically mapped IP addresses?\n\nA: You can look at \"dynamically\" attributed leases with:\nmore /var/db/dhcpd_leases\n\nYou can look at \"statically\" and \"dynamically\" attributed leases with:\ngrep '\\[en.\\]' /var/log/system.log | more\n\n\nA: Don't think so, no.  There is a need to know which DHCP addresses are currently in use so that stale addresses can be re-issued to new clients, etc.  You're looking for statically-connected users under DHCP, which is by definition not static.  They will not show there.  \nOne way to check though might be to ping the broadcast address and hope the static clients are configured to respond to pings.

I just observed something that I'm having trouble believing.\nTo push Lion onto my daughter's laptop without waiting for yet another giant Lion download, I turned on sharing on my MBP, connected from my daughter's SnowLeopard MB, and dragged. \nWhile the copy was in progress, the file name label on the desktop was 'MacOSX Lion <arabic word>'. Once the copy finished, the Arabic disappeared.\nIs the evidence of a special easter egg, a feature, or my need for better medication?\n\nA: Sometimes when copying a large file, a temporary file will be created at the destination. The temporary file could be named <actual file name> <some additional random data>. Once the download completes, the temporary file is renamed to the actual file name.\nI'm pretty sure Firefox behaves this way, but not certain whether Finder does. Also, I'm not sure why the suffix was in Arabic; perhaps the random data Apple uses is not limited to just A-Za-z0-9?\nInteresting phenomenon nonetheless.\n", "Q: Update and Jailbreak iPhone 4 IOS 4.3 to IOS 5.0 I am trying to update a jailbroken iPhone 4 IOS 4.3 to IOS 5.0.

On login, a dialog appears, stating that a uninitialized hard drive was found. So I tried to partition the SSD with GUID partitioning scheme and one HFS+ Journaled partition. The partitioning process was stuck at about 50% and failes after about 2 minutes with a posix input/output error.\nFormatting the SSD with diskutil from terminal succeeded once, but after a reboot the partitioning scheme was set back to master boot record acording to disk utility.

I've been using mac for years, but prefer to do software development on windows. I'm really used to is using the folowing shortcuts on windows very much:\n<CTRL>  + INSERT: Copy\n<SHIFT> + INSERT: Paste\n<SHIFT> + DELETE: Cut\n\nOf late, I've taken to doing even my development work on the Mac. However, as a matter of habit, I'm missing these shortcuts very much. Actually, I find these a lot more convenient than COMMAND + (C/V/X) combo.\nIs there a way to reassign these three shortcuts at least? \nI've look all over the internet and in the \"Keyboards\" system preferences but I did not find anything.\nPS: If you're wondering where I find the INSERT keys on a mac book pro, I use a wireless keyboard.\n\nA: I use Ctrl-Ins, Shift-Ins, etc too.\nThe solution described is here, as well as remapping Home and End keys to be more Windows-like, e.g.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open TextEdit under the Applications folder.

Can I install any 3rd party clipboard software etc?\n\nA: You have two main options for a situation like this.\nThere are clipboard managers that would help you. They generally don't allow multiple things in the clipboard at the same time, but they do allow you to easily paste anything that has been copied recently. So, you could copy everything you need (individually) and then select what you want and paste it.\nClipMenu is a typical clipboard manager.\nThe other option is a text expansion utility, which I think would suit your needs better. These are tools that let you type something short and automatically change it to something longer. For example, you could type dd and it would change it to the desktop machine name.\nMy favorite text expansion utility is TextExpander.\n", "Q: Safari 5.1.1 SlowDown/Freeze I am tired of how is working Safari on Lion.

But in general it's pretty frequent. It has happened during chats as well.\nMy internet connection throughout these disconnects is pretty stable: everything else seems to be working well, and the connection is wired.\nI've looked at this related question - iChat periodically disconnects - but the situation described is a bit different, as I don't get any notice about \"disconnecting\", it just silently becomes offline. In addition, the proposed work-around in that question - using Chax - does not work for Lion.\nIs there any way to solve this, or do I have to find an alternative IM client?\n\nA: Adium can be good alternative. Lifehacker calls it best IM client for Mac:\nhttp://lifehacker.com/5802325/the-best-instant-messaging-application-for-mac \niChat is buggy, I had same problem and other problems too.\n\nA: I use iChatAV quite a bit and the AIM network seems to go or at least hiccup quite often lately.\nAlso, there's a difference between running iChatAV, then choosing \"available\" in it's menu and not running the application but choosing \"available\" from its menu (which can be done).

Any suggestions? I have an iMac.\n\nA: It sounds like you were sharing your ethernet internet connection with your Wii and iPhone via your internal Airport card. The wireless strength indicator in the Menubar on your Mac should have a little arrow pointing up if this is your situation. Check System Preferences/Sharing/Internet and make sure you are still setup to share your ethernet connection via Airport. Also make sure you ethernet cable is still plugged in.\n\nA: Pay your wireless bill? :-0 Just kidding..\nSo, the Wii still gets on the Internet and surfs no problem, but the iMac and the iPhone are unable to connect to the same network?\nThe self-assigned address happens only when the machine is unable to get anything else from DHCP. It usually means that the Internet Modem has failed or Internet from your ISP is not getting to you properly.\nBut, if the Wii can surf the internet and pulls a proper address and is working fine, it's gotta be something else.\nDo you have a router that is only giving out 1 address? Meaning that if you turn the Wii OFF, can your iMac then connect to the wireless network and pull a valid address, and then surf the Internet again?\n\nA: Delete the entry in network connections for your wireless router and re-add it. Also delete any entries for using your iphone/wii through your wifi card. Your iphone can connect to the router directly. Why use the iphone? Your wii also has wireless so don't see why you'd do that either?\n\nA: Have you tried a force shutdown?

Obviusly increasing CPU load will increase also  minimum sustainable latency.\nAre latency figures on Mac the same or is it possible to achieve lower latency? Can someone provide data form his own experience?\nThanks :)\n\nA: This is entirely achievable.\nOSX has been capable of sub-3ms latency for the past decade.\nCoreAudio and CoreMIDI are built right into the OS for low-latency audio and MIDI support.\nThat being said, latency is a function of your entire system/signal chain. As you well know from your Windows experience, some tuning and configuration with respect to your specific audio hardware will be necessary to get the very best performance.\nBut even without tuning, OSX provides great latency performance out of the box. I've been using Logic and Live regularly since I switched to Mac about 7 years ago, and never had a complaint even in the early days when I just plugged things in and didn't tune any of the default settings.\nAs Apple users are wont to say, \"It just works.\" But it works a little better if you spend some time optimizing the performance.\n", "Q: Can you tweak or customize Spotlight to find first specific files and folders?

It used to, not sure when that changed.\nIt's not a proper solution, but using VLC would be a workable stopgap measure - it doesn't use the built-in Lion fullscreen functionality, and thus can be put wherever you like, and doesn't blank the other screens at the same time.\n\nA: The only way I can see fullscreen playing on a non-primary display (without editing System Preferences or adding additional software) is this: \n\n\n*\n\n*select movie file in Finder\n\n*activate Quick Look (click the eye button or press space bar)\n\n*move the Quick Look window over to the target display\n\n*click the \"expand to fullscreen\" arrows button in its top right corner.\n\n\nQuickTime Player Version 10.1 (501.8) on Lion - the Quick Look hack only works on non-streamed content so it is kind of a bummer.

You can either move the data off, reformat to HFS+ then move the data back on or add a second partition that is HFS+, move the data to that partition then remove the old NTFS partition and expand the HFS+ one.\n\nA: *\n\n*Always backup first.\n\n*Use a filesystem conversion tool like Paragon NTFS-HFS Converter (commercial product)\nThere are open source projects such as FSTransform and ConvertFS (abandoned), but unfortunately, they don't support HFS.\nNote that converting a filesystem is always slower than copying the contents to another disk, reformatting, and copying back.\n\nA: The OP has probably already solved this problem since posting 2 weeks ago, but for the record, smith is right, you will have to move the data one way or another to reformat to HFS+. And it must be journaled if you want a bootable partition. Lion doesn't support FAT32 or NTFS.  \nIf you don't have room to make a second partition on the current drive to hold all the data, you will have to borrow, rent or buy another HD, and then set it to copy everything overnight or while you're at work. \nIf you're in a position to buy, look for a great deal, or a nice upgrade to what you have (nothing in between). Costco was recently selling a 3 TB MyBook (USB2) for $100, though USB2 will be much slower and have less longevity, especially given Apple's new Thunderbolt standard. Or, a high capacity can be had for about 7-10c per GB (~$150-200 for a 2TB) with FW800/USB3. Personally, I'd go for the upgrade, unless I were broke.  \nOnce you transfer, you can sell the new drive (or if you have wiggly ethics, return it), or keep the upgraded drive and sell your old one after wiping it clean (triple pass erase and reformat). \nYou might also look at what you REALLY need out of all those backups. How important are those files, and how often do you use them? Unless you're doing DV / animation work, photography or you have huge media libraries (that you actually use!) you probably have a lot of wasted space. \nIt's easy to keep buying hard drives and filling them up. It's harder to sift through them for the real jewels ... or bite the bullet and dump all your old ideas to make room for the new. \nNow there's an idea for a great backup solution: Only back up stuff that matters! \n\nA: Paragon NTFS-HFS Converter easily convert NTFS volumes to HFS+ volumes and vice versa.\n\nParagon NTFS-HFS Converter is a specially designed utility, that converts NTFS volumes to HFS+ volumes, or HFS+ volumes to NTFS. This utility consists of a wizard that helps you select the desired volume for conversion, gives you the option to back it up, then quickly performs the conversion.\n\n", "Q: Pow conflict when pointing to my IP Some time ago I had installed Pow to run my sinatra apps.\nNow today I wanted to use my Mac's built in web sharing to test an html file as rendered on my iPod Touch.\nI browsed to 10.0.1.20/~francesco/ which is my personal site folder and recived a 404 error.\nI think this error is because of the Pow installation. In fact if I point to 10.0.1.20 it tells me that Pow is running.\nHow can I tell Pow to run only if I point to my_app.dev or othermyapp.dev?\nIs this a way to correct this issue?\n\nA: Not really the solution you asked for, but here's one way to work round it without spending a lot of time messing with config's, it also has the advantage of being less prone to breaking after updates and upgrades.\n2.1.3 The Default Virtual Host\nIf you attempt to access a domain that Pow doesn't understand, like http://localhost/, you'll see a page letting you know that Pow is installed and working correctly, with instructions on how to set up an application.\n\nYou can override this behavior to serve all requests for unhandled domains with a particular Rack application. Create a symlink in ~/.pow named default and point it to the application of your choice.\n\nAdd to that the information from here:\n2.4 Serving Static Files\nPow automatically serves static files in the public directory of your application. It's possible to serve a completely static site without a config.ru file as long as it has a public directory.\n\nAnd that should create a default Rack app that can serve up content based on IP address (no host headers) \n\nA: If you follow these instructions it should allow you to view localhost running on Apache and any domain ending with .dev to use pow.\nIf you have trouble with it make sure you restart Apache when you change any settings and you may have to wait up to 5 mins for the DNS to fix themselves. There is a way to force kill the nameservers but I can't remember the command.\n", "Q: How does a family with multiple idevices and multiple laptops share music and digital movie copies? My wife and I both have our own laptops with our own iTunes accounts. Then we have a shared desktop. In the past, this was fine as all we had for iDevices was an iPod each.  So we just managed our own music.\nNow we each have an iPhone, and we have one iPad and we are looking at getting my daughter a iPod. So we still have our own iTunes accounts, but now we are getting digital copy movies which can only be associated with one iTunes account, and as you know a iPhone or iPad can only sync with one iTunes account. However, it would be nice to have our selection of movies and be able to say, hey I want this on my iPad for now, but have the option of later not having it on the iPad, but then on my iPhone.  I want to stay legal, so I would only have the movie on one device at a time, but want to be able to move them around.\nNow I know if I associate all my devices to one shared iTunes account that is easy enough to do. But what if we want to maintain separate accounts so I have all my iTunes music available on my laptop instead of our shared desktop?\nThen if my only option is to have one shared iTunes accounts, can I merge our accounts so I can get all purchased music and apps from each account into one?\n\nA: Here's our setup:\nComputers:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac x 1 (wife's primary computer & used by the kids)\n\n*MacBook Air x 1 (my primary computer)\n\n*MacBook Pro x 1 (wife's)\n\n\niOS Devices:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 4 x 2 (wife's and mine)\n\n*iPhone 3G x 1 (Younger Daughter's, used in airplane mode)\n\n*iPod Touch x 1 (Older Daughter's)\n\n*iPad 2 x 1 (mine but can be used by all when it's at home)\n\n*Apple TV 1st Generation x 1 (used in kid's playroom)\n\n*Apple TV 2nd Generation x 1 (used in main living room)\n\n\nThe Setup:\nWe use one Apple ID for all iTunes purchases (music, videos, books & apps) across all devices. Each user of an iOS device also has their own unique Apple ID used for iCloud.\nThe iMac is our main hub. All music and videos are stored on it. All iOS devices with the exception of any that are mine sync with the iMac. I maintain my own music on the MacBook Air that I manually manage (I will copy over items from the iMac that I want on to the Air and will copy over times that I have added to the Air back to the iMac - I believe that this can be automated with the use of Home Sharing when both computers are on the same network). All iOS devices that are mine sync with the my Air.\nMusic on the kids's and wife's iOS device are managed individually via syncing with the iMac. This goes for videos as well, however we usually only access videos when we are at home and therefor rely on the built-in Home Sharing ability of each iOS device to stream content from the iMac to the device. This is also how we use the 2nd gen Apple TV.\nWe have no iTunes setup on the MacBook Pro as my wife uses the Apple TV or her iPhone to listen to music and only uses the laptop for web browsing.\nThe 1st gen Apple TV has been jail broken and has had its hard drive upgraded. I manually copy over videos to it for the kids (only non-iTunes purchased videos).\nMore info on Home Sharing: http://www.apple.com/support/homesharing/getstarted/\nOn Merging Apple IDs:\nThis cannot be done: http://support.apple.com/kb/HE37 (5th question down).\n\nA: \nas you know a iphone or ipad can only sync with one itunes account\n\nWhere did you get that idea from?\nYou are allowed to have multiple iTunes accounts associated with a single device. Just log out of one iTunes account, log into another account, and the second account's content will be available, while all the stuff associated with the previous account continues to work perfectly.\nThe App Store will even allow you to update software from an account that you're not currently logged into (this works better on iOS than inside iTunes).\n\nI want to stay legal, so I would only have the movie on one device at a time, but want to be able to move them around.\n\nAgain, I think you're making false assumptions here. The license does allow you to have your purchases on multiple devices (I'm not sure about movie/tv rentals, they are more strict).\nI'm not a lawyer, and I haven't read the entire terms and conditions, but my understanding is that your content is licensed to the household, not to an individual person. Everyone in your family (so long as they live in the same house) is legally permitted to use each other's iTunes purchases.\nLast time I checked you are allowed to have five macs and unlimited iOS devices attached to each account, and you are allowed to have multiple accounts on a single device (only one of them can be logged into the store at a time however).\nI contacted Apple's support team with a similar question to yours and they told me to just use two accounts on all my devices. About half the content on my iPhone/iPad are with my account, and the other half are with my girlfriend's account. It works fine, though we have to be careful not to buy stuff with the other's credit card.\n\nA: You could use a Time Capsule to store all the media from the iTunes libraries. This is a wireless harddrive that can be used as a network.\nYou can do this by using copying the location of one itunes library over to the Time Capsule, then copy the contents of all the other libraries.\nMake sure that all iTunes are pointing to the destination folder on the Time Capsule.\nThen all your PC's will have access to all the files in all libraries. \n\nA: Basically, if you want to stay legal as you suggested, no good way exists to do this. The best bet is to not buy music and movies that are linked only to a single iTunes account. I would purchase music DRM free, and rip movies that you own using Handbrake.\nMaybe this is not what you want to do, but I think it is what most people actually want the ability to do. Buying content with copy protection really locks you down in most cases. I for one, feel as though once I have bought a DVD, I should be able to watch it on as many devices as I want without worrying about usernames, logins, or what the device prefers. \n", "Q: How do you run a script after a network interface comes up?

(I run 10.6.8)\n\nA: Simplest and cheapest would be to setup iChat on both computers and use Ask to Share screen feature from context menu.\nUsually it will work from the start. Sometimes you need to configure router, here is a list of ports used by Apple services. Enabling uPNP or NAT-PMP on the router will usually work. In any case you need fast enough connection for it to work (at least 300kbps recommended still it's better to have faster one but what is more important is quality of the connection).\n\nA: A couple of days ago I consulted two friends with lots of experience in this area, and they suggested Log Me In.

So you have to go into the router's admin settings and forward ports 5500, 5800, and 5900 to Grandpa's IP on the local network (192.168.something). The above link had hints about that but we also googled for his specific router, plus \"port forwarding\". Apparently port 5900 is the standard for VNC and something somewhere told us ports 5500 and 5800 were needed as well, which seemed to be true.\nNothing more should ever need to be touched on Grandpa's computer.\nOn our own computer, we do command-K in Finder (Go menu -> Connect to Server) and type in vnc://123.456.789.012 or whatever Grandpa's IP address is. We log in using Grandpa's name and password for his Mac. \nFinally, his IP address is likely fairly static but in case it ever changes, we installed this on his computer:\nhttp://www.monkeybreadsoftware.de/Freeware/IPinmenubar.shtml\nThat way he should be able to easily read us his IP address from his menubar and enable us to take control again.\nPS: This is much faster than Copilot.com (presumably logmein.com is similar to copilot, having to route all the network traffic over http or whatever). We actually used Copilot to do all the above setup on Grandpa's computer though.\nPPS: At some point the local IP address changed from 192.168.1.104 to 192.168.1.100 so we had to go back into the router's port forwarding settings (did this with copilot.com again!) and update it.

For best results, use Chrome.\n", "Q: Did Apple degrade the accuracy of the iPhone 4S GPS compared to the iPhone 4 I have done some extensive testing of my iPhone 4S compared to my iPhone 4 and found GPS accuracy has suffered substantially.\nI've been using the 4 for about a year, riding a bicycle on a 3 mile loop park road several times a week. Typically, I'll do about 6 laps or 18 miles. Using a great app called Cyclemeter, I save the track so I have a record of how fast and how far I rode. After I upgraded to the 4S I found the measured length of each lap varied widely and that ridiculously high speeds were being recorded.\nUpon examination of the recorded track I find loops drawn out to points up to 100 feet from the actual course and back tracks heading the wrong direction. The net result is the iPhone 4S is off by around 20% on the measured distance from what I know it should be. Has anyone else looked carefully at their tracks and found similar results?\nWhat is more likely: That I have a defective unit OR that Apple's elimination of a dedicated GPS chip means less accurate information?\n\nA: My experience helping others with this problem seems to suggest a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple's been monkeying around with power conservation by trying to give \"good enough\" positioning results while idling the GPS for longer periods and relying on cell tower and wifi positioning more.  Try turning off wifi for your next run to see if the GPS does better (and if your battery is drained more).\n\n*Application developers are decreasing the GPS resolution of their apps in order to have less impact on the battery due to user complaints.  Check to see if the app you use can be configured for GPS update frequency and ask the app developer what they suggest regarding your problem.\n\n*Both the iPhone 4 and 4S seem to suffer from GPS degradation after awhile that can be fixed by doing a refresh of the device - in other words sometimes it's a software issue that seems to fix itself after a hard reboot and system refresh.  For some people a hard reboot is sufficient, but others have indicated that only a refresh will work for them.  I think this started affecting some of my friend's phones around the beginning of last summer.  I've seen several of my friends have this issue, visit the store, have it refreshed and reset, and the problem disappear.  Now they do the refresh themselves with iTunes when it gets annoying.  I don't have information on whether this is tied to a particular version of iOS or not, but I have seen it on both the 4 and 4S.\n\n\nOf course you could also be experiencing a hardware problem, but you might consider some of the above actions before completely blaming the hardware.\nAlso be aware that GPS requires good line of sight to the sky.  If you've changed your iOS device position recently, consider changing it back.  If you're wearing it, make sure your body isn't between the device and the sky, and that your perspiration isn't reaching the device.\n\nA: I believe this is a hardware problem.  I had an iPhone 4 using the RunKeeper app similar to Cyclemeter.  It worked perfect for six months, then GPS accuracy degraded (says I ran a little over double my actual distance and the map shows data jumping all over about 250 yards off track).  Behaves like signal blockage.  Not caused by dropping, heat, power, etc.  Per Genius suggestion, I tried disabling all other Locator apps as well as tricks you reported.  Eventually, Apple replaced the iPhone under warranty with a new one which worked perfect for three months, and this week it began degrading as well (useless for running!).  Since the original 1 year warranty is up, I'm stuck!\nApple Genius Knowledge Base does not address this issue.  They say the GPS either works or it doesn't, and it doesn't degrade accuracy or get intermittent data points.  They have no fix.\n\nA: The iPhone 4s contains a GLONASS chip, in addition to the GPS chip (at least for units sold in North America and Russia).  GLONASS is the Russian competitor to the GPS.  Theoretically, it should improve accuracy, since iPhone samples both chips, but I don't think that happened.  In my case, the GPS seems 3-4 seconds behind what I am doing.\nI am guessing this is new to Apple and all the problems get fixed in the next update. \n", "Q: Why does the menubar hide when I'm in iTunes?

I'm asking this as both a cautionary tale to others as well in hopes that perhaps there is a jailbreak option I am overlooking.\nIn the process of the update from 5.0 to 5.0.1, the baseband was also updated to 4.11.08 and as expected, the phone became locked again as evidenced by the fact that it says \"No Service\" when I try to use my SIM. \nIs there a way to unlock my iPhone 4 with iOS 5.0.1 other than asking the carrier to which it was initially locked?\n\nA: You can't. Not only is there no way to unlock the new baseband, but there's also no way to downgrade it. You are out of luck. \n\nA: There are a number of carriers (in the UK) that allow you to unlock your phone after a contract is over. I know that I was able to unlock an iPhone on O2 as soon as the contract was up, I was able to do the same thing whilst the contract was still.. running on Vodafone. \n\nA: By now it is possible to down-grade your baseband - at least for the iPhone 3G and 3GS (unfortunately not 4/S) - from the iPad's 06.15 to 05.13.04 (un-lockable) thanks to the great work of the iPhone Dev Team:\n\nThe iPhone Dev Team is happy to announce a baseband downgrade option in redsn0w for those who are using the iPad’s 06.15 baseband on the iPhone3G or iPhone3GS.\nTypically you’d have the 06.15 baseband if you unlock with ultrasn0w but updated your iPhone baseband past 05.13.04.  With this new capability, you can now downgrade specifically from 06.15 to 05.13.04 (even if you never had 05.13.04 on that device before).  This gives you the best of both worlds: ultrasn0w compatibility and a normal iPhone baseband with full GPS and the ability to use stock IPSWs again.\n\nSee this post on their blog.\n", "Q: How to auto connect to VPN upon login/boot?

After you've created the file, open it up in a text editor and look for the following:\n<key>VPNType</key>\n<value>(...)</key>\n\nAdd the following below:\n<key>OnDemandEnabled</key>\n<integer>1</integer>\n<key>OnDemandRules</key>\n<array>\n    <dict>\n        <key>Action</key>\n        <string>Connect</string>\n        <key>InterfaceTypeMatch</key>\n        <string>WiFi</string>\n    </dict>\n    <dict>\n        <key>Action</key>\n        <string>Connect</string>\n        <key>InterfaceTypeMatch</key>\n        <string>Cellular</string>\n    </dict>\n</array>\n\nNow after you've installed this profile, a checkbox \"Connect on demand\" should be shown in the \"Network\" system preferences. Now macOS will keep your connection alive. Bonus feature: you can also add specific rules about when the VPN should connect or disconnect, depending on which Wifi network you're connected.\nSee Configuration Profile Reference on Apple's Developer Site for all on-demand rules. And see also the strongSwan wiki where some examples are shown.\n\nA: Apple Script provides a good solution:\non idle\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell current location of network preferences\n            set myConnection to the service \"VPN University\"\n            if myConnection is not null then\n                if current configuration of myConnection is not connected then\n                    connect myConnection\n                end if\n            end if\n        end tell\n        return 120\n    end tell\nend idle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: Spotlight indexing of back up drive I've seen some posts about whether you can stop spotlight constantly indexing your time machine backup drive. It seems you can't have it attached to your computer and not have it indexed.\nI have been getting around the problem by demounting my backup drive and then remounting it when I want to back up.\nI wonder if any anyone has a script that would mount, backup and unmount a backup drive every 6 hours or so. \nThanks.\n\nA: To not have Spotlight index your Time Machine hard drive while it's powered and attached to your Mac, add Time Machine backup drive (by clicking on the + button at the Privacy tab of the Spotlight system preference. \n\nA: This link provides a solution to backing up using Time Machine at customized intervals or events:\nhttp://timesoftware.free.fr/timemachineeditor/\nYou can disable Time Machine the system preferences when using this tool.\n\n\n", "Q: iPhone home button no longer works Recently I dropped my iPhone, breaking the screen, so I had that replaced with a new screen by myself that I brought from Amazon.\nNow that I replaced it, the iPhone home button doesn't work at all because when I press it, it doesn't do anything, no matter how hard or many times I press it, it still won't do anything.\nLater on, I took apart the iPhone and replaced the home button with a new one, and this didn't solve the issue and yet I don't know why it doesn't work at all.\nI have pictures of my iPhone 3GS, hopefully it should help or whatsoever.\nHow can I get the home button working again?\n\n\n\n\nA: If you can't fix the Home button mechanically, you can use a workaround to still be able to use your device, provided you have upgraded to iOS 5 or later.\nEnable \"Assistive Touch\": Settings -> General -> Accessibility. It essentially shows a home button on the screen. A good way to breathe life into a broken phone.\n\nA: Have you checked that when you re assembled the phone you lined up the positioning of the dock connector correctly, a tiny bit off and it will cause the home button to not work.\nSee this solution for removing the back of an iPhone 3GS for disassembly instructions. On step 29 you will see the importance of this components positioning.\n\nA: This is probably a bit of a long shot given the distinct possibility of this being a hardware rather than a software issues (because of historical circumstances). Having said that, I did have this same problem with my iPad 2 (was convinced that there was an issue with the hardware) and this was rectified by a 'hard device reset'.\nHave you tried this yet? \n", "Q: App order for multitasking gestures A recent update brought multitasking gestures to my original iPad. I hardly use them because swiping left never works and swiping right seems to launch random apps. What are the rules behind them?\n\nA: Apps for the multitasking gestures are sorted by the time you last opened them, with some exceptions (see below).\nFor example, from your home screen open Mail, Safari, and Music, in that order. At this point, if you swipe from right to left, it will switch to Safari because that is the app you opened before Music. If you swipe from right to left again, you will go to Mail, because it was opened before Safari. Then swipe from left to right to go back to Safari, and repeat to go back to Music. Now, go to your home screen and open Safari. It has now been opened most recently, so swiping from left to right will give you the bounce effect. Swiping from right to left will open Music, and repeating will go to Mail.\n\nAn app is moved to the front of the swiping list when you open it from your home screen or from the multitasking bar. It will not change position in the list if you open it using multitasking gestures or notification center (unless it is a notification on the lock screen), unless it was not previously open.\n", "Q: Can I use a non \"me.com\" address to send email with iCloud? I will  be buying an iPad and will want to use iCloud.  However, I want to use a non \"@me.com\" address to send email from/reply to.  Is this possible when you sign up for iCloud?  Thanks\n\nA: Using iCloud doesn't necessarily means you'll have to use Mail on iCloud. You can still use your current mail provider to send/receive email on your iPad. Providing you can connect to your current provider using IMAP, Exchange or POP.\nYou can also create your iCloud account without having a @me.com address. I use my @gmail.com address as my Apple ID to connect to iCloud to sync Contacts, Calendars, etc.\n\nA: If you use iCloud mail, then you can not use any other email address than me.com.\nYou can forward the mails from your old email to the me.com, but if you send an email from iCloud then the sender will be me.com.\nThis is a serious issue with iCloud, and I personally hate it.\n\nA: Yes you can.\nBecause of security [mainly spam and phishing] issues, respectable outgoing mail (smtp) server operators will only allow you to send mail from an email address and domain that they know you have the right to use.\nThis isn't just picky,  it's an essential part of the mechanism that has cut down SPAM.  Apple have no way of knowing whether you have the right to send from xxx@acme.com. If you haven't that right, and Apple lets you use it to spam, then they are likely to end up with their servers being blacklisted and then none of us can send email.  Hence the restriction.\nBut your domain service provider has that knowledge.  They are already probably forwarding you incoming email, or mapping your incoming email server address across to Apple. Ask them if they have an outgoing smpt server that you can use to send mail,  and use it rather then Apple's outgoing server.  \nThis may seem like a hack, but it is actually a perfectly rational setup.  The outgoing email will still get put in your iCloud out box, so there is no downside.\nWhat would be nice is if Apple would take on the whole domain name management issue.  \n\nA: You can, but it's a bit of a hack.\nYou can choose to use an different SMTP server to the normal one, as is the SMTP server for iCloud that rejects the use of an email address that doesn't match up.  You can point it to a Google GMAIL server, and then get Google to change the \"send from\" address to match what you need to use.\n\nA: No - iCloud servers will not send \"spoofed\" email so you'll need to arrange a second server to receive that email and send it.\nThere are several ways people configure this, the popular ones being:\n\n\n*\n\n*configure an alternate SMTP server for outbound mail by setting up iCloud manually\n\n*use DNS and a proxy to handle the traffic\n\n*setting up two accounts on iOS / Mac and letting iCloud send from the alternate account.\n\n\nA: In my view, the answer is simple: when you setup your iCloud account you can use whatever email address you want, (I have setup iCloud accounts with Yahoo.com email addresses as well as an iCloud.com email address).\n", "Q: MacBook Air mid 2011 Geekbench results too low My MacBook Air from mid 2011 recently only scores about ~1800 on geekbench vs 5300+ that it was before.  I'm starting the benchmarking right after reboot, and the CPU seems initially calm. Any points?\n\nA: I went to the Apple Service, where the guy has booted from an external hard drive and run the Repair Disk Permissions task from Disk Utility. That solved the issue!\nNote: I did run Repair Disk Permissions before while trying to solve this problem, but it apparently couldn't fix some of the files due to that the disk was mounted. So, booting from an external disk is crucial here.\n\nA: Alright, another solution that worked for me. Got the same symptoms, but nothing helped this time, including my own original recipe (the one marked as the accepted answer).\nLong story short: resetting SMC did the trick - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\nJust FYI, this time I tried the following before coming across the SMC reset trick:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fixing all permission problems, including manual removing ACL on some system files.\n\n*Restoring from TimeMachine.\n\n*Clean reinstall of Lion.\n\n\nA: Perhaps there is a background process that is taking away some of the processor's powers. Did you check in Activity Monitor if there was a process that took more than say 10 or 15% for no reason? Make sure the \"Show All Processes\" is selected.\nAnd perhaps a bit of maintenance with apps like Onyx, CleanMyMac or Cocktail is in order. Never a bad thing to do...\n", "Q: Can Messages display the timestamp of every incoming message? I was chatting with someone via Messages.app on my iPhone, and they sent me a message saying \"call me in 20 minutes\".  I was away from my phone when they sent it, so I didn't know when they sent the message, and therefore didn't know when to call.\nI know that Messages.app displays a start time for new conversations, but I just want to get the time of a specific message.\nTap-and-hold and double-tap on the message just give a \"Copy\" context item.\nHow can I see the time of an incoming message?\n\nA: iOS 7, which is now in the wild, can indeed show timestamps for every message. Just slide your finger right to left in a conversation.\n\nImage: The Verge\n(I literally yelled \"finally!\" while sitting at my desk when I read about this.) \n\nA: I managed to view the timestamp of the most recent message by going back to the main Messages menu.\nThat displayed the most recent activity timestamp next to each conversation, and since I hadn't sent a response, the most recent message was the \"call in 20 minutes\" message.\nI still can't find a way to get at the timestamp of an arbitrary incoming message, but this addressed my immediate problem.\n\nA: The primary answer to this question is no:\nOn the iOS device itself, from within Messages.app, no matter if the messages are standard SMS, or iMessage; only the occasional timestamps, and the latest message time on the overview list, show times. There is no other mechanism for displaying message times.\n\nA: In the messages index view where it shows all messages to from everyone use the search feature at top and search for text specific to the message you need to know the time of and it will show time next to it when found , only hour and minutes though \n\nA: You can jailbreak your phone, then install SMS Timestamp. This will let you see timestamps for every message.\n\nA: In iOS 5 (and in iOS 6, I suspect), if you are willing to delete some messages, you can find the timestamp of ANY message if you delete the ones which precede it in the conversation \"snippet\", which i describe in somewhat more detail on http://kenamored.blogspot.com/2014/04/how-to-reveal-ios-5-imessages-timestamps.html\n\nA: Use the \"Compact view\". You'll see the time stamp of the message on the right hand side. View > Messages > Show as Compact\n\nA: Try double tapping each message (in messenger, not text messages, for that it's s simple swipe to the right)\n", "Q: Failed to Change Carrier-Logo on a jailbreaked iPhone 4 with iOS 5 today, i wanted to change my carrier logo on my iPhone. \nEvery Tutorial failed.

The aluminum Macbook Pro gives a mild shock when connected to a wall socket and charging. It only happens when I'm, for example, not wearing shoes or slippers and my feet are resting on the ground (i.e. by body is acting as a conductor).\nI contacted apple and I was told to perform the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown\n\n\n*hold ⇧+ctrl+⌥+power for 10 seconds\n\n\n*wait 30 seconds then hold ⇧+ctrl+⌥+R+power (Let the Mac reboot three times with that apple tone, then let go. The Mac reboots again.)\nThis did not fix the problem and I was not told what these steps were supposed to do. They have asked me to purchase a three pin version of the adapter and see if that fixes my\nproblem.\nMy last MacBook Pro was giving pretty severe jolts towards end of life. Hence a bit concerned.\nQuestion\n\n*\n\n*Has anyone here experienced such a problem?\n\n\n*Is anyone aware of what the above sequence of steps supposed to do?\n\n\n*Also, will this damage the Macbook in some way?\n\nA: This tingling can be felt on our aluminum 13\" Macbook from 2008 and a 15\" from 2011 if the Apple extension cord is not used on the power adapter.\nThe V shaped slide part of the extension cord connector should have metal contacts under the edge of the V. These contact the metal button / mushroom shaped pin in the adapter, which is electrical ground. Make sure your three prong extension cord actually has the ground connection from the wall plug to the power adapter.  This page might help you find the ground pin on your plug: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets\nI believe the ability to feel the tingling is more related to the condition of the skin contacting the laptop than to humidity in the room.  Dry and thicker skin might have different results, for example.\nEven if the extension cord has a ground wire then the outlet you are using could be wired incorrectly.  Maybe try grounded outlets in a different or newer house or office.  \nThis isn't just an issue with Apple gear - metal bodied IBM Thinkpads do it if the rubber coating isn't too thick.  And I've had it happen on metal faced Pioneer audio gear.  It isn't static, it is often felt only when the hand is very lightly touching the metal and often only when the hand is moving - as if brushing off a crumb.  Unplug the power connector from your Mac and the problem will likely disappear while on battery power.  The prolonged tingling nature of the effect leads me to believe it is a stray current.  This is not likely due to a wiring problem in the device but might be a mild inductive or capacitive interaction between the power adapter / circuit and the device housing.\nThe fact that the laptop housing is metal and should be grounded when connected to power suggests that it is designed correctly to safely route true static discharges from your fingers to ground without damaging your Mac. I've damaged plenty of PC gear by working on carpet in winter via painful static shocks to the monitor or keyboard / USB ports.  But I've never damaged Apple gear this way.\nSo the solutions seem to be: Make sure you are using extension cords with an embedded ground wire and plugs.  Make sure the wall outlet is grounded correctly and any surge protector is undamaged.  If this can't be achieved, use an external keyboard when connected to power.  A silicon keyboard cover will completely cover the Apple wired keyboard, if needed.  And powering the Macbook from an Apple Cinema display might be worth a try.  \n\nA: The solution for me was to use the adapter with a three pin extension cord.\nThen your notebook is grounded, and no more charges stay on the cover that shock you. :-).\nAbout steps 1-3\nIn steps 1 and 2, you reset the System Management Controller (SMC Reset) on a Mac that has a battery, which you should not remove on your own. The SMC manages hardware conditions related to temperatures and power consumption. You may also be interested in the question: When should I reset the SMC on a Mac?.\nI'm not aware of the shortcut you performed in step 3.\n\nA: I recently moved to India and I had the same problem. But after using the 3 pin cord for the power adaptor the problem got fixed. I got both 2 pin and 3 pin connectors from Apple when I bought my mac. I was wondering why do they provide both and now the puzzle got solved! :P\nCheers!\n\nA: The second step (ShiftCTRLOptionPower) is intended to reset your MBP's System Management Controller (SMC), as shown in this About.com video (more details about the SMC are contained in this Apple Support KB - look for specifics in the Portable computers that have a battery you should not remove on your own expandable section). This Wikipedia article indicates that this step is used to reset the Power Management Unit.\nI don't have any specifics regarding the third step (ShiftCTRLOptionRPower), but I suspect that the R stands for reboot, as indicated by the behavior you experienced.\n\nA: Something similar happened to me too.\nHowever, it also happens when I'm using it on battery as well.\nHands felt tingling/numbing sensations and eventually burning sensation. Got blisters the next day.\nHad the unit returned and received a replacement. Replacement still gives me the tingling/numbing sensation after 30 minutes, but I have not received electric shocks on it yet (been using it straight out of the box for about 2 hours).\nDid some research and there was an article that seems promising:\nhttp://www.emfwise.com/how-to-ground-appliances.php.\nWe can purchase a cable that will \"ground\" the appliance to reduce the sensation.\nJust wanted to share to warn people not to ignore the sensation and it might have health consequences (my fingers actually developed a slight tremor). Get the affected unit checked out/replaced and not to suffer like I did.\n\nA: I had the same issue. I do not know how SMC reset might help, but the 3 pin adapter makes sense. I thought of a work-around without having to invest in another adapter. \nThe issue with static discharge is that when you walk/rub on carpet or wool, electrons move from the carpet/wool to your body. This is similar to rubbing your hair with a plastic scale and holding it over shredded pieces of paper which get lifted due to the electrostatic force against gravity. Anyway, after accumulating electrons on our body, if we touch a metallic object, the electrons from our body move to the object. The small current during the movement of electrons give us the shock/pain felt by neurons. \nEssentially, to reduce the current, we have to safely discharge electrons from from a larger surface area of our body which decreases the sensation of pain felt by neurons. To do this, use a metallic paper clip or safety pin (should be metallic) and bend them such that one end is broad and other end is narrow or pointing. Every time before touching your computer/mac, hold the broad end and bring the narrow or pointing end towards the computer body and you can see small spark between the two. If you keenly notice, you will feel a very negligible shock, but it is so small that it is painless compared to if you touch bare hand. \nHope this workaround helps you.\n\nA: I have been getting tingling shocks from my Mac for a while, but only when I use the shorter cable i.e the converter is the plug itself. \nThe problem stops when I use the extension cable. Must be design fault, with the shorter plug adapters not earthing properly. \n\nA: Is it minor shock or static shock? Do you live in a hot & dry place? Do you have dry skin?\nSorry if my questions sound weird, but you might have a medical issue. I too had the same issue with my MBP. I was blaming the electrical wiring. Thats when I realized about static shock. In my case, it was my dry skin coupled with the hot & dry climate. I started focusing on hydrating my self well and I stopping having the issue. Later just to ensure that hydrating actually helped, I reversed to less water and the shocks started again.\nI know its a weird solution but it worked and I did not bother thinking about it more until I read your question.\n\nA: \nHas anyone here experienced such a problem?\n\nYes, still a problem with 2018 models.\n\nIs anyone aware of what the above sequence of steps supposed to do?\n\nRight now I live in a hotel. For me, the solution was to put my shoes on when working with Macbook.\n\nA: Buy a three pronged pin from any service center. In the adapter the earthing line is available,  it's sort of a hidden metallic strip inside the connector. It seemed to solve the problem for me.\n\nA: I just got a new mac and was sitting at home bare-footed when suddenly I feel a pain in my arm. Took me a second to realize I was being shocked! I read somewhere that if you lift your bare footed legs off the ground it fixes the issue. It worked for me.\n\nA: This just started happening to me on my 2017 MBP and I am using a three pronged cord. Turns out there is something wrong with one of the outlets in my house. Moving it to a different circuit fixed the issue. I will update when I figure out what is wrong with the outlet.\n\nA: I think it's just dry weather. Try getting a humidifier.\n", "Q: Downgrading to ios 4.1 from ios 5 without shsh?

I have an AirPort Extreme (n, 1st gen.) and several AirPort Expresses (g), all connected through their Ethernet ports to my network. The Extreme is used to \"create a wireless network\" and one of the Expresses is used to \"participate in a WDS network\", while the others have their antennas turned off. Every few weeks, the Express that is extending the network (along with its signal) vanishes from the network and needs to be powercicyled to reconnect. Why would this be happening?\n\nA: Save configuration and replace it with another one from those that have their radios disabled.

I could do everything in a playlist but if someone has already done this then it's all the better.\n\nA: Since it's a wedding, the only recommendation I can make is to hire a professional DJ that can work the crowd. Predefined playlists might be fine for ambience music during dinner etc, but they'll never get the real party started. You need some interaction with the crowd if you ever want to get them on that dance floor. Also don't assume timing of a wedding party goes exactly as planned when you think of automatically announcing speakers etc, it just doesn't work out that way.\nThere is quite some DJing software available however. A popular choice is djay (also available for iPad). But a good set-up goes further than that. You can have a look at this page for a more extensive guide on DJing on the Mac.\nBut again, please go for an experienced DJ. It's worth it. I'm sure he has his own set-up, wether it be digital or analogue.\n\nA: it's your wedding. Do you really want to have an IT solution to manage during a wedding. If it fails, what are you going to do?\nI don't doubt that the app does some cool stuff but you want the least amount of things that can possibly go wrong at a wedding.\nSorry for the non-IT answer.\n", "Q: Lion's Preview regularly hangs when unhiding with open documents In Lion, I've had an incredible amount of difficult with Preview hanging indefinitely when restoring open documents after being hidden for any extended period of time.\nThere is no immediate solution except to force quit Preview and relaunch it.  Console reports no error messages except for Preview being manually killed.\nAny recommendations on dealing with this problem?  \n\nA: I’ve been having this problem in Lion, and the only workaround I’ve found is to disable Resume, on a once-off or total basis for Preview.\n\nDisabling Resume permanently\nIf you open Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app), and enter the following string, then Resume for Preview will be disabled permanently:\ndefaults write com.apple.Preview NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false\n\nYou can also disable Resume for all apps in System Preferences: in the General pane, untick the checkbox marked Restore windows when opening and quitting apps. I find Resume generally useful, so I haven’t, but you might want to do this.\n\nOne-off disabling or Resume\nIf you don’t switch it off permanently, and you’re working with a lot of files in Preview, you might not want it to re-open them the next time you launch it. When you quit Preview, hold down the option key; then the Quit Preview command becomes Quit and Discard Windows. Use this, and it won’t reopen all of your files next time. (Keyboard shortcut is opt-cmd-Q).\nIf you forget to do this when you close Preview, and it starts hanging, then you can flush the Resume data. Navigate to ~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Preview.savedState and delete the file or folder stored there. This deletes all the saved data for Preview, so when you open Preview later, it doesn’t restore any of your saved documents.\nThis is probably more useful if it’s misbehaving intermittently, than for the problem you describe.\n\nFurther comments\n\n\n*\n\n*If you’ve set Preview to never remember your files, you can temporarily get it to remember them. As with the one-off disable, hold down the option key when you quit Preview, then you get the command Quit and Keep Windows.\n\n*I disabled Resume for Preview shortly after Lion came out, and I’ve not had any problems since. However, I only use Preview for images, not PDFs (I use TeXShop for that), but even so, the hanging is completely gone.\n\n*You can also have “opt-in” Resume using these steps. If you disable Resume for all apps, then run the Terminal command above with true instead of false, then you can whitelist Resume-enabled apps, rather than blacklist them. You can find the com.apple.Preview equivalent for any app by looking at what the appropriate file is called in the Saved Application State folder. (A quick Google search for Terminal commands involving that app \nwould also do the trick).\nI hope some of this is useful and speeds up Preview: it certainly worked for me.\n", "Q: Texting from my old 3GS iphone without a Sim still shows my old phone number I've upgraded my iPhone 3GS to the new iPhone 4S. I want to give my old 3GS to my daughter to use as an \"iPod touch\". We've upgraded the 3GS to iOS 5 and attached it to iCloud with her own separate account.\nI'd like for the 3GS to be able to text me on my 4S - yet it is the same phone number the 3GS used to be, it doesn't seem to work.\nI've also tried to text from the 3GS to another iPod touch we have (new, 4th gen). Yet it just texts to an email address. It doesn't appear as a text/iMessage/SMS. \nIs there a setting I'm missing? I'd really like it to show as a text and not an email.\n\nA: Cellular SMS requires an activated SIM card.\nWhen you upgraded to a 4s, the phone company probably deactivated the SIM in your 3GS, so it can't be used for SMS without another valid SIM card.\n\nA: When a iDevice wants to use iMessage it needs to be registered with an AppleID, and an email address (can be something else than the AppleID) or a phone number in the case of an iPhone. You can change this setting here:\nSettings > Messages > Receive At\nYou always need one address or phone number in there. To remove one address, select it from the list and then click Remove.\nBut as far as I know, i don't think an iPhone can receive iMessage without a phone number…  that could prove difficult to circumvent. Let us know if you have any result. Perhaps with the old SIM inserted in the iPhone you can remove the phone number from the list...\n", "Q: Troubleshooting an iPhone 4 connected to wifi, but can't connect to the internet I recently got an iPhone 4. At home, it connected to our wifi and worked perfectly. Now I am at school. My iPhone is now connected to the wifi here, it says that it is connected and has strong wifi signal. However apps that require internet like email, Facebook app, and online games (like words with friends, etc) load and stall showing \"updating\". All apps are unable to actually update. It shows it is loading for forever. \nWhat can I do to fix this?\n\nA: Go to Settings, then Network. Select your network. Click the accessory button to see the network settings.\nIf you don't have an IP address, scroll down and tap \"Renew Lease\".\nIf you have an IP address that is a 168... number, it means you are not getting an IP address from the school's server. You'll need to contact their sysadmins.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Your iPhone and iOS in general simply uses DHCP to request an IP address and routing information on every network it joins.\nIn the case where the device works on other networks, it's extremely rare for the phone to then misbehave on one specific network.\nHave you gone through the troubleshooting steps (see the link below)? It's good form to try these, but you may need to contact someone who knows if your network uses proxy servers, filtering or authentication to prevent new devices from using the network to access the internet. Just joining a network means your phone has connected to the radio - not that you have a clear path to the internet (without ports being blocked) or even a viable routable IP address to use the local network.\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS: Troubleshooting Wi-Fi networks and connections\n\nA: Try using Safari and see if it shows some sort of login page for the school's network.

If so, maybe the school is running some sort of firewall.\n\nA: It's very possible that your school requires a proxy server for internet access - you can confirm this by checking a machine that has internet access. \nOn your phone, you can configure the proxy settings in Settings -> Wi-Fi Networks -> Your network -> HTTP Proxy.\n\nA: I had a problem last night and today where ALL my iOS devices would connect to one of my Airport Extremes (2 that are around 405 years old, a couple generations, one running 2.4ghz and one 5ghz, and one of the new tall ones with both 2.4ghz and 5ghz networks), did not matter which one, but would NOT show the WiFi fan symbol and would not connect to the internet, even when showing connected with a check in the iOS Settings app.  This was multiple phones and iPads.   The Macs in the house had no issues.  I ran the Airport Utility on my Mac but did not see anything wrong with any of them.  I ended up unplugging them one at a time and letting them reboot.  Now all the iOS devices can attach to any of the 4 wireless networks created by the devices and get to the internet.  So try physically rebooting the router/airport device.\n\nA: This is precisely what happens when the DNS server IP address configured in the wireless router is bad.  (We had our ISP simply stop using some addresses for DNS!)  iOS devices typically configure their wifi access by default to defer DNS to the router.  If the router has bad addresses, the iOS device (or Apple TV) can't connect via wifi to the internet - it can't resolve addresses.\nA Mac, on the other hand, usually has a list of prospective DNS server IP addresses, used to resolve addresses BEFORE the router.  Thus, if any 1 of the addresses in their DNS list is operational, the Mac can make an internet connection despite the router.\n", "Q: Can I install Windows 7 on iPad 2? I want to use Windows 7 on my iPad 2. Could this be done in a general case? \nIf it can not be installed, please let me know how I might get as close to having windows running on the iPad as I can get. \n\nA: \nCan I install Windows 7 on iPad 2?\n\nNo.  Windows requires and runs on x86 architecture processors, while the iPad 2 has an ARM architecture processor.\nWindows 8 does have an ARM option, and so does Android, so there is a small possibility in the distant future that someone will do the (significant!) work necessary to bring those systems to this hardware.\nBut windows 7 cannot be installed on the iPad 2, due primarily to the differences in CPU architecture.\n\nI want to use Windows 7 on my iPad 2. Could it be done? \n\nYes, in a way.  Typically what people do is they run windows on an network connected computer, then run a remote control app on the iPad.  Windows 7 Professional comes with RDP, a remote desktop protocal which allows one to control the computer as if they were at the keyboard in front of the computer.  They run an RDP client on the destination - in this case the iPad 2 - and can use the computer on the iPad 2.\nThis only works if you are on the same network, or if you're both connected to the internet and you have the network configuration set up correctly.\nVNC is another popular protocol for which there are free servers and clients that would also allow you to use Windows 7 on your iPad 2 even though it's really running on another machine remotely.\nIf you ask a new question and give details as to how you want to use windows, how your network is currently set up, and details about the machine that's running windows, we can probably give you more detail as to the steps you would take to do this.\nIf you want to spend a little more money for a solution that just works without fiddling with configuring the computer, the iPad, or your network, then do a google search for \"go to my pc\" and you'll find several companies providing this service that take care of all the details for a low cost.\n\nA: Other answers have addressed the problem with trying to run Windows 7 on an iPad, so instead, I will offer another workaround.\nIf you are looking for a way to run Windows 7 apps such as Microsoft Office on the iPad, one of the easiest non-VNC workarounds is to use OnLive. It connects over the Internet to one of OnLive's servers running Windows 7 and let's you use it as though it was installed on your iPad.\n\nHere's a great article about OnLive from the New York Times: Windows on the iPad, and Speedy. They also mention how eventually it will let you run any application you want:\n\nFor example, the company intends to develop a third service, called OnLive Pro ($10 a month), that will let you run any Windows programs you want. Photoshop, Firefox, Autodesk, games — whatever.\n\n\nA: It cannot be installed on the iPad 2. The processor in the iPad is an ARM processor and Windows (up to and including Windows 7) can only run on x86 processors, such as those from Intel and AMD. (There are other reasons that running Windows would be impossible, but this is the most important reason.)\n\nA: The closest would be to use a VNC program to use Windows that you have running on a different computer. This is easiest on a home network, but can also be achieved using cellular data but will use LOTS of data. VNC basically lets you take control of a different computer and shows that computer's screen on your device.\nA couple you could try out are:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTap VNC\n\n*Screens\n\n*Remoter\nJust search for them on the App Store.\n\nA: Another option is not actually installing Windows on your iPad, but rather jailbreaking it and installing Dreamboard and using a theme such as Vistapad. There are several other themes out there that have the Windows UI, just search in Cydia.\n\nA: I don't know why you want to do this, but you can check this link about installing a jailbreak app that pretends to be Windows.\n\nA: You can’t  run Windows 7 on an  iPad 2, but you can remotely control a windows PC from iPad. Download Splashtop Remote Desktop on your iPad 2. Then visit the Splashtop website and download its client server on a Windows PC. Now you can view your Windows desktop on your iPad whenever you want to use it remotely.\n", "Q: How do I extract Parallels Desktop's dock icon? Parallels Desktop has ugly red bars on its icon.

I use iDisk and have some Web Galleries on my MobileMe account (both features that have been siginficantly changed in iCloud), and since none of my computers run Lion (my iPad runs iOS5) I cannot sync fully with iCloud.\nIs there any reason why I should switch to using iCloud now? or should I continue with the benefits of MobileMe.\n\nA: With Snow Leopard, you cannot Sync Docs, you can work around to sync Calendars and Contacts.\nI would stick with MobileMe as you have the iDisk.\niOS5 and iCloud does sync docs accross devioces every time you make an edit. But sadly for me (Snow Leopard) I cant sync Docs to my Mac without first uploading from a device to iWork.com which is a bit of a shoddy work arround. \n", "Q: Securely erase deleted files? I was wondering if it's possible to make sure that some files I've deleted in the past on my mac are really gone?\nI know about the option in Finder (Finder -> Secure Empty Trash...), but what if I already emptied Trash the standard way, and now want to make sure the files are fully wiped off?\nCheers.\n\nA: You can erase free space using Disk Utility. (/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app).\nIn the sidebar of Disk Utility, select “Macintosh HD” (or the drive where you’d originally stored the file). At the top of the window, select the “Erase” tab. Towards the lower left-hand corner of the window, there’s a button labelled Erase Free Space. This lets you overwrite all of the free space on the drive (which is where your deleted file currently resides). You can choose a one-pass, three-pass or seven-pass erase — hopefully that’s more than enough. And if not, I guess you can just do it multiple times.\nAs always with Disk Utility stuff, be a little careful. I did this a couple of years ago with a three-pass erase, something screwed up and I had to restore from a backup :(\n\nA: Are you using an SSD?\nI don't believe it's possible to erase anything securely from an SSD, unless it was only stored encrypted. The easiest way to do this for new files is with FileVault.\nUpdate: Apparently there's something called TRIM that allows the system to securely erase files on an SSD. It may not be on by default. See this answer for more information.\nI'd still use FileVault, but it looks like you don't have to. (:\n", "Q: How do you clone a drive encrypted with Filevault2? Say I have drive A that is already encrypted with Filevault2.  I want to make an exact clone of the drive to a different drive B.  Every way I've tried so far decrypts drive A first, then clones, resulting in drive B being decrypted when the clone completes.  Is there a better way to clone drive A bit for bit?  I'm thinking of using dd but was wondering if there was a more Apple friendly way.\nThe best way I've been able to figure out how to do this so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to a Lion install USB drive.\n\n*Open Disk Utility & unlock the encrypted drive\n\n*Format the new drive\n\n*Restore the encrypted volume on your new drive.  It will be unencrypted.\n\n*Close disk utility & open Terminal.\n\n*In Terminal, type \"diskutil cs convert /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/\".\n\n*Boot up to the new drive, open System Preferences, & re-enable encryption.  All previous settings should still be there.\n\n\nI have not fully tested this method, but in theory it should work.  It's too many steps for my liking though.  I'd prefer one clone & be done with it, somehow.\n\nA: You could use the recovery option of Disk Utility:\n\nThis of course requires source and target disk to be identical, but the same restriction applies to dd and similar tools.\nUsual warnings concerning picking the right disk as source etc. apply!\n", "Q: How to get iPhone device details when it is connected to a Windows machine? I want to get the details (OS,version,UDID...) of the device (iPhone) when it is connected to a Windows machine. The only thing here is either using iTunes or another way.\nI want this done from command line (NO GUI Tool).\n\nA: You can find the details (OS version etc.) simply by going to Settings > General > About on your iPhone.\nYour UDID can be mailed to you with this free app http://itunes.apple.com/app/ad-hoc-helper/id285691333?mt=8 if you don't want to connect to iTunes and have the information shown. \nAFAIK there is no easy way of finding the UDID through CMD on a Windows, but you can try and navigate to this path through it:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Enum\\USB\n\nThis should show the UDID of the iPhone, if it has been connected through USB. Bare in mind there are many lines inside the folder, but the files referring to iDevices have 40 digits in it.\n\nA: If you want the UDID of iOS devices backed up with iTunes you might look at the iTunes backup directories:\nWindows XP:\n\\Documents and Settings(username)\\Application Data\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\\nWindows Vista and Windows 7:\n\\Users(username)\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\\nOn Mac I type:\nls \"Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/\"\n\nThis gives my UDID as a directory.\nOn Vista / Win 7 you might try this in the Windows command line:\ndir \"%appdata%\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\\"\n\nOr on XP:\ndir \"%appdata%\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\\"\n\nI would like to know if this works, thanks!

I have tried 1234 and anything else I could come up with. I have to get back in. I accidentally deleted text messages that I need for personal reasons. I called Apple, and they basically admitted that this could happen somehow, but they had no remedy. Is this true?\n\nA: *\n\n*I would try your iTunes password and any others you can think of.  Passwords don't magically set themselves.  You or someone else must have enabled the Encrypt iTunes Backups feature, which requires setting a password.\n\n*You might be in luck, because deleting text messages (at least in iOS 4.x) doesn't actually erase the data, it still exists in your sms.db file hidden on the phone.  You could seek an experienced iPhone expert to help you jailbreak and access your sms.db, or use a tool like DiskAid or PhoneView to attempt to access the Messages sms.db directly.  Then you (they) would use an SQLite database browser to search and view the text messages.\n", "Q: Disabling Notification Center pull-down (or re-enabling Safari swipe action) This is a bit of a nit-picky thing, but it's annoyed me ever since I upgraded to iOS 5.

However, now I'm constantly pulling down the notification center pull-down when all I want to do is return to the top of the page.  Is there any way to disable or change the swipe-to-pull-down notification center?  At least in Safari?

I have a 20\" iMac (white, Core Duo 2.0 Ghz, one of the first Intel iMacs).\nLately I've had a problem where the iMac won't eject a CD.  It attempts to eject it, makes all the eject-related noises, but the disc seems to hit a piece of metal and then falls back into the drive.\nI can see the little metal piece when I look in the slot (pushing the rubber stuff aside with a paper clip).\nIt's like the little metal piece is supposed to retract but it's staying put.\nEventually it just starts working again -- maybe if I unplug the iMac?  Not sure.\nAnyone know what's wrong or how to fix it?  Do I need a new disc drive or something?\nThanks,\nRob\n#\nMore info:\nThe metal piece keeping the disc in appears to be some kind of lever that's part of the drive.  I turned off the machine, unplugged the power, laid the machine on its back for a while, then stood it up, plunked it down a little hard, and the little lever thingy must have fallen back into place correctly because now the disc ejects again.\nThe thing is, this is going to happen again because it's a recurring problem.\nIs this a problem with the hardware?  Any idea how to fix it?\n\nA: It looks like the optical drive is dying.\niFixit has instructions to change it.\n\nA: Seems Apple has problems with their slot drives across models. I've got the an 27\" i7 iMac and had the same problem. It was under warranty when mine happened, but Apple's solution was to replace the Superdrive.\n\nA: Use any thin piece of plastic - US driver's licenses seem to work well - or a knife blade (carefully), hold in the slot when you try ejecting and use the edge to help \"steer\" the disc away from the blocking piece.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro become buggy after update I'm running on Mac OS X (ver 10.7.2) on my Macbook Pro 15. I did an update earlier this morning and after that everything I run fails or runs really slow. Some of my application also don't work properly anymore.

I have now moved to country B, and want to start using the iTunes store from country B. If I change the country in my account settings, will I lose all my previous purchases, or will I still be able to re-download my purchases from country A from iCloud?\n\nA: No, you will not lose your original iTunes purchases (songs, movies, apps, books, magazines, etc). \nHowever, if you use iTunes on Macs or Windows to manage your apps, you'll only be able to download any app update(s) only if you switch your iTunes login (authenticate by typing in the correct password when prompted) to the same country that you purchased the apps. \nIf you use iPod Touch, iPhone, or iPad installed with the latest iOS 5, you'll be able to download updates from purchases made with different iTunes country ids. Again, you'll need to authenticate by typing in the correct password when prompted. But unlike iOS 4, you won't need to log out before switching iTunes id.\nI am happily using two different iTunes id to buy content from different countries.\n\nA: You can create another account in the other country and authorize your iTunes with this both account.\nI'm French and I live in Australia and I use 2 different accounts to download music and apps from the both iTunes stores.\n\nA: Yes, it happened to me.\n\nI changed the country from India to Canada. Musics bought from India is not available any more.\n\nA: You will not lose purchases (songs and apps). I know because I switched from the US store to Canada when I moved, and all my songs and past app purchases from the US store are still available in my iTunes app.\nBUT... you will lose the ability to re-download them if your computer crashes, etc. (So make sure you back up your iTunes and computer to the cloud on a regular basis. Or sign up for Match.) Also, app updates will not be possible for apps bought via the original store. Hopefully, most of your apps were free downloads.\nThink of your Apple ID as a personal passport. Some people have 2 passports, but most don't. To keep 2 Apple IDs (passports) in 2 different countries, you are required to have a bank account or credit card with an address in each country. If you don't want the hassle of maintaining a foreign bank account, it's probably not worth having a second Apple ID.\n", "Q: \"arrange by date created\" doesn't work I'm trying to order old folders and old files using \"arrange by date created\" from the View menu, but that choice is greyed out.

I have a MacBook and I did not take care of the battery properly. It started to shut down unexpectedly at around 20% and then even at 30%. I got a new battery and it seems to work fine; it lets me get down to 6%. The only problem is that even with the new battery, a warning does not pop up telling me that it is time to plug in my computer. I was waiting for it to come up when my computer was at 6%, and instead it just died. I don't know if I need to change some kind of setting or what. Any ideas on how to fix this?\n\nA: I had reset SMC several times and changed my battery once. Unfortunately, my MacBook did not show low battery warning anymore. Then I found\nSlimBatteryMonitor, it works for me. You can customize the percentage of battery (if drops below x%) to show the warning panel too.\n\nA: Try resetting the SMC. Details are listed here. You will notice that the symptom you described is listed on that page too as \"The computer sleeps or shuts down unexpectedly.\"\nOne additional piece of advice.

When I'm navigating through the folders, sometimes (most of the time) I have to wait up to 10 seconds until I can see the list of files in the selected folder. Also, there is no visual clue that Finder is fetching the file list, so the first time I got this behavior in Mac OS X Lion, I was thinking the folder was empty.\nEven worse, when I'm copying some large files to the server, Finder is delaying the process of getting the file list more or less until the copying is finished.\nIs this something I can fix? Or is it a known bug in the Finder/SMB protocol implementation?\n\nA: In finder make sure you have status bar showing under view options.  You should see a spinning gif animation while the folder is loading.  If you have visited the folder recently the file list should be cached.\n\nA: It is an issue with Apples smb implementation.  They used to use Samba but because of licensing issues they have now created their own smb client.\nThere are two solutions you can choose from:\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure the server to play nice with Apple's smb (if you have access to the server).  You can do this by enabling the vfs_fruit module in samba.\n\n*Replace Apple's smb implementation with Samba3.\nI detailed the solution in more depth in Slow SMB connection Buffalo Linkstation and you can see everything else I tried and my complete experience in Apple OS X Finder Is Listing Files Very (Very) Slow Over SMB With Shared Hard Drive Connected Directly to a WiFi Router at my company's blog.\n\nA: I would say this is an expected result of mixing designs.\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows wants certain information to paint the folder contents and serves that to anyone that asks.\n\n*OS X wants different information to paint the folder contents and takes longer to retrieve things from each file (icons to drawn, etc...) since it doesn't get what it wants from the initial directory listing request.\n\n\nYou can experiment with different views (list view, icon view, etc...) to see if your 10 second delay can be minimized, but using the Mac OS to view remote files on a windows share can take a while to get the listing if the data takes time to arrive. You can convince yourself it's not the mac by opening a local folder with similar file count.\n\nA: Doing option-command-escape and relaunching Finder helps me.\n", "Q: AppleFontSmoothing Has No Effect On My ViewSonic VX2450 I've followed the advice in these questions and am not having any luck.

I had a similar issue that was caused by trying to use a resolution which was available in my displays preference but higher than my monitor supported. \nEven though your monitor is rated for 1080p try a resolution with less than 1080px height. There's a possibility that you won't be able to get full 1080p through DVI (will explain further if the lower resolution solves it).\nAlso note that the same thing can happen when you use non-native resolutions that require scaling, not just larger ones.\n", "Q: How to search text in files of all types (including binary)?

When I charge my iPhone 4s it reaches 100%. But often, in the morning, it is as low as 95% and most of the time it shows less than 100%. If I unplug it and then plug it in again it quickly reaches 100% again. How to fix? Not a problem?\n\nA: You should try to completely unload your iPhone. Let it go to 0 % (and shut down from itself), then plug it and let it charge completely. It should fix your problem.\nSee this articles from Apple for more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/batteries/iphone.html\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1476\nThe gists you need:\n\nFor proper maintenance of a lithium-based battery, it’s important to keep the electrons in it moving occasionally. Be sure to go through at least one charge cycle per month (charging the battery to 100% and then completely running it down).\n\n\nA: I noticed this on my 4s too. Try this: keep the phone plugged into its charger, wake it up and let it sit for a bit awake. It should pop up to 100% pretty quickly.\nI'm guessing, but I don't know for sure, that this is yet another bug in the battery/charging routines in iOS 5.0.1 and will get fixed at some point.\n\nA: The iPhone 4s has a Li-ion battery.\n\nLi-ion cannot absorb overcharge, and when fully charged the charge\n  current must be cut off. A continuous trickle charge would cause\n  plating of metallic lithium, and this could compromise safety.\n\nIt's important to know that once the charging process is completed, the battery is never actually full. There's always a bit of 'space' left. If you keep reconnecting your phone and charging it again for several times, you can increase the charge. This is called bump charging.\nI would assume that Apple engineers changed the calcuation for the saturation of charge. The way the iPhone 4s behaves now is what the Nexus S has had already:\n\nOnce the battery is 'full' (=current cut off) the saturation\n  is recalculated to represent the actual charge.\n\nI'm sure Apple wanted to show the 100% in the past in order to mute customer worries. However, this 'new' behavior is totally normal and more realistic.\nFor more infos about Li-ion battery, and measuring charge saturation see this link.\nhttp://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries\n", "Q: iPhone 4s search sometimes stays blank Search page works very well except when it doesn't work at all.

After some time with no loading whatsoever, I get the usual screen (sorry it's German, it basically says the page cannot be opened because the server won't answer):\n\nThis behavior can usually be remedied by going into Flight Mode and back - just tap once, wait for the little plane to arrive, and tap again. \nSo it's no big deal to get one's connection back once you have noticed the problem. Until then, you probably ask yourself why you haven't received any mails today or why nobody has answered your latest facebook poll for the last couple of hours... So especially for an \"always-on\" device that is supposed to push data to the user, this problem is somewhat annoying.\nFWIW, I have witnessed that same behavior on my old iPhone 3G, but since that one had some WiFi troubles as well, I have always dismissed it as a minor hardware fault of this one particular device.\nHas anybody else seen this on their device, and what can I do to stop it altogether?

With radio off, a phone call works fine through the car's system, but reminders only vibrate the phone and there is no sound. If the radio is on, the reminders can be heard. The dealer upgraded the Sync so it is current. He said something about privacy mode, but I can't find that on my phone.\nI deleted all devices from the car's bluetooth memory and re-paired the phone. No help.\nHow to make reminders audible while driving with radio off?\n\nA: I do not think this is possible. I have a 2010 Fusion with Sync and no nav. The iPhone's ringtone is the only thing that will preempt the current audio setting if it is not Bluetooth Audio. Any other sounds (text message, reminder, turn-by-turn directions using Waze or MapQuest) are only audible if Bluetooth Audio is selected, a phone call is already in progress, or Siri is active. In other words, the phone's audio must already be playing to hear any alert other than a ringing phone.

What free tool can I use to repair an NTFS partition under Lion.\nI already have Tuxera NTFS on it and I do not want to install windows for this task.\n\nA: From the Tuxera for Mac manual:\n3.3 Checking and repairing NTFS file systems\nThere is only limited support for checking and repairing NTFS file systems at this time. The best way to repair a damaged NTFS volume is using chkdsk in Windows.\nIf you install NTFS-3G for Mac OS X, you will find that it includes a utility called ntfsfix, which can repair some fundamental inconsistencies of NTFS volumes. This utility is currently not integrated with the file system bundle, and thus can't be invoked through Disk Utility, because of reports that it has corrupted some users' NTFS drives.\nIf you want to try it out despite these warnings, you will have to invoke it manually, from the Terminal. Type “man ntfsfix” for usage info.\n\nA: There is Disk Drill that can repair FAT, NTFS and HFS on a Mac.\nhttp://www.cleverfiles.com/file-system-recovery-mac.html\n\nA: I just used the free and open source TestDisk to recover an NTFS boot sector.

They're not needed for a single link DVI connection, so they'll just sit unused.\n", "Q: Can the Finder be tricked into assigning symlinks and aliases different icons? It seems to me that the Finder does not (on the surface) distinguish between aliases and symbolic links. (In particular, in the Get Info window for a symlink the Finder claims the symlink is an alias.) But is there a way to force symlinks all to be assigned a certain icon (that isn't the standard folder-with-a-little-arrow alias icon)? That is, is the global 'alias' icon file different from the global 'symlink' icon file, or can one instruct the Finder to use a different icon file for symlinks?\nI imagine that one could write a script that would create a symlink and assign the created link a certain icon. But I'm hoping to change the icons of all existing symlinks, so I don't have to change all the icons manually.\nI'd like to know because I use both (aliases when I'm lazy and just need a quick shortcut, and symlinks when I need something more robust), and it would be nice to be able to see the difference in the icons.\n\nA: Symlinks are a Unix concept. They are special files that point to other files, so that, in many cases, accessing the symlink (for instance if it points to a shell script) really access the underlying file (running the script).\nAliases are a Mac concept (though OS/2 had something similar, I forget what it was called).\nAs far as I can tell aliases can be made only from the finder whereas symbolic links can be made from a terminal window. (It is possible to make an alias from the command line but you have to write applescript to do so).\nAliases have one advantage over symbolic links. If the underlying file that the alias points to is moved the alias is automatically updated. Not so with symbolic links; they break (i.e. point to nowhere) if the underlying file is moved.\nI've been interested in this question because I'm trying to write a script that will bring up a getinfo window when typed from the command line. So far the best I've been able to do is to copy some scripts that do this from other web sites. The drawback is that, unlike selecting Get Information on a symbolic link from a finder window these scripts show get getinfo window for the underlying file, not for the symbolic link.\nIt is definitely a side project for me, but if I find the answer I'll post it.\n\nA: There is a cute bash script that converts your aliases into symlinks, which sounds like your best bet honestly.  Aliases aren't useful for much really.\n", "Q: Booting an Intel Mac to Linux from a U3 USB drive Is it possible to boot an Intel Mac to Linux, or any non-OS X operating system, from the U3 partition of a USB drive?\nI know that because OS X uses EFI rather than BIOS for the boot process, the only way to boot from USB is generally if you're booting an EFI-capable operating system -- meaning OS X. And (at least I think) I know that when a non-OS X operating system is booted, a Mac switches into BIOS emulation mode during the boot process, which actually disables USB support until the OS loads the appropriate drivers for the USB subsystem... which is why booting non-OS X operating systems is generally not possible from USB drives.\nSo this got me to thinking -- since you can boot any OS on a Mac from CDROM, and there are USB-based CDROM drives that one can boot from, what if a USB device emulated a CDROM? And that led me down the rabbit hole to the (now-extant) U3 spec from SanDisk, which did just that -- emulated a full CDROM on a partition of a USB drive.\nSo, is it possible to boot from this partition, and boot into a non-OS X operating system?\n\nA: Here is description how to do this \nhttp://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~osc22/tutorials/linux_on_macbook_air.html\n\nBooting linux from USB drive on a recent MacBook air (e.g. late 2010)\n  - even with FileVault 2\nI've spent a while figuring out how to boot linux on my MacBook air\n  3.2 (aka late 2010) from an USB stick, since I needed to image its disk before and after enabling full disk encryption (Lion's FileVault\n  2).\nThere are many tutorials out there but most of them either don't work,\n  are not for the correct combination of hardware/software or miss some\n  details. So here I give you the facts for booting a linux live image\n  (I've used Ubuntu) with a MacBook Air that perhaps has Lion (although\n  I am sure it works with Snow Leopard as well) and may be even with\n  FileVault2 (full-disk encryption) enabled.\nIf you don't have FileVault enabled, I recommend you install rEFIt\n  from your Mac OS X using the dmg installer, and follow the steps at\n  the END of this page. Now, for the details....\nIf you can, use Ubuntu (yes, from a different PC) to create the USB\n  drive with Ubuntu by means of \"Startup Disk Creator\" (See\n  System/Administration). Once you have the USB drive, if you run mmls\n  (a forensic utility from the sleuth kit), you should see actually\n  several partitions including a Win 95 Fat32 (0x0C). This is actually\n  the partition you need to dd, i.e. \"dd if=/dev/disk2s02\n  of=/dev/disk0s3\" bs=1M count=\"size_of_that_partition_in_blocks\"; where\n  disk2s02 is the Win95 FAT32 partition in the USB drive and disk0s3 is\n  a partition you have created on your Mac disk). Now (having installed\n  rEFIt as I mentioned above), reboot your MacBook and use the partition\n  utility of rEFIt (one of the items) to fix the MBR (is a hybrid\n  MBR/GPT partition table). Simply answer yes to have the linux\n  partition (the one where you've copied from the USB) correctly set up.\n  Restart again the MacBook and use rEFIt to boot the linux install/live\n  partition. Now, if you have FileVault enabled things are a bit more\n  tricky. The reference post about how to do this is here. However,\n  again there are some details that should be made clear.\nFirst of all, I highly recommend you do an image of your drive (either\n  directly from MacOS by using the low-level disk, e.g. /dev/disk0 - not\n  the one showing as /dev/disk1 unencrypted). There is a risk you won't\n  be able to boot OS X anymore after you apply these steps. Next, follow\n  the steps in the post I mentioned above. When it refers to \"bless\" the\n  efi partition, look at the end of the post in the StopService() code\n  and you should see what to do. gpt fdisk refers to the command \"gdisk\"\n  in repair mode (r). Here you need to use the Hybrid MBR, by typing\n  (h). I recommend you read this. When asked for partition code use \"0C\"\n  (Windows95 FAT32 for your linux partition). I'm not sure if is a good\n  idea to put the EFI partition (code 0xEE) at the beginning, or if you\n  should create extra protective MBR partitions. I've put the EFI\n  partition at the end and didn't create any extra protective MBR\n  partitions and I was able to boot linux. However I wasn't able to boot\n  the Mac OS X anymore. So that's why I recommend the prior image.\n  Looking at the results and comparing with the partitions in a USB\n  drive with rEFIt I suggest you actually create all the protective MBR\n  partitions suggested by \"gdisk\". I've recently purchased a Macbook Air\n  superdrive. You can easily boot linux using that and avoid all the\n  trouble and possible problems with the steps above. So if you want the\n  quick and safe way I suggest you spend about $66 and take the\n  superdrive. It works also when FileVault 2 is enabled.\n\n", "Q: How can I check if an iPhone is new or refurbished based on its serial number? I want to make sure that the replacement iPhone I am being given is new, not refurbished.\nGiven the serial number, is there any way to tell if an iPhone is new or has been refurbished?\n\nA: I don't think you can do it with the serial number, but if you were given a replacement in a box that looked like the original packaging, then it's new. Else it is a refurb — at least, that has been my experience with Apple so far. This thread also supports that:\n\nIf the replacement was from a black box (with the iPhone pictured on it), that's a new one. If you need to have your phone replaced in the first 14 days, it should be done as a retail swap. After that, for warranty replacements, you'll be given a refurb (assuming they are available, they take a while to get into the pipeline). Generally, replacement iPhones are packaged in plain white boxes with no accessories. New ones can be packaged like that too, for Genius Bar replacements, but after the phone has been out a while they will mostly be refurb units.\n\nSo in short, if you're looking at replacing an iPhone just a few weeks or a couple of months after release, then it's most probably a new stock. If it's been a while since the model released, then it's most probably a refurbished phone.\n\nA: There is no reliable way to figure it out.\nIt is entirely possible (not likely, but possible) that you could be getting a refurbished device, but it is more probable that its a brand-new device. \nHowever, as I stated above, it is entirely possible that someone could have gotten a device less than a week old, returned it and it got a turn around. \nAlso, what you can do is look at the box when you do get it:\nIf its in the original packaging (e.g, black box with the iPhone on it), its new.\nHowever, if its a plain white box, its a replacement. Replacements are traditionally packaged without any extras, although I did get earbuds and a sync cable in the one replacement device (iPod touch) I had to get from Apple. \n\nA: Go to Setting>General>About>SerialNumber.\nif it start with:\n\n\n*\n\n*M - Retail Unit(Standard)\n\n*N - Replacement Unit (Can be refurbished)\n\n*F - Refurbished Unit\n\n*P - Personalized Unit (Standard but customized)\n\n\nA: Yes, there is a way: if the starting four digits of serial numbers are continuously letters or numbers, then that is a refurbished device.\n", "Q: Does trimmed SIM card affect iPhone 4S's signal strength? I have just received my iPhone 4S ordered online. I don't have a microsim card that iPhone 4S would need to me to. I don't wish to pay extra to buy a micro sim card since it doesn't give much improvement. I did a search and found out that I could cut my ordinary 3G sim card to the size of a micro sim card. And I did this.\nSo now, I put that trimmed micro sim card into my iPhone 4S and it worked. But, the reception meter has only 2 bars all the time! The phone may be able to access the web and send sms through the cellular network but having only 2 out of 5 bars at the reception meter makes me feel totally unsafe; I am doing all of these at my home, where the reception signals are usually very strong.\nWhen I put the same trimmed sim card into another iPhone 3GS, the reception also has only 2 bars. But when I put the trimmed sim card into an iPhone 2G, it has 5 bars.\nWhat's wrong? Is it my iPhone 4S or the sim card that is having the problem? What problem am I having and what else can I do?\nUpdate\nSo the 5 signal bars on iPhone 2G is merely the 2G network. When the 2-bars 3G signal on my iPhone 4S drops to only the 2G network, it also has 4-5 bars of signal strength but that's 2G. Does trimmed SIM card has problems with 3G networks?\n\nA: No - the sim card only provides an ICCID number to the phone. That number is read once per boot as the phone just uses the sim to identify what account to bill for service when registering with the nearby cell towers (IMEI and ICCID together let the system know what number to assign your phone and who to bill). \nSomething else must be causing your observed behavior. \nKeep in mind, there is no guarantee two phones in the same location are not on distinct cell towers. Especially if one tower is overloaded or doesn't have high speed data so the phone /carrier might pick a faster connection that happens to have less bars of signal. \nWhat does your carrier say if you call them for a site survey / diagnostic?\n\nA: The sim card has nothing to do with it... Its job is to provide informations about the subscriber (you), about some of the carrier specific settings and an identification mechanism. It also provides some storage for contacts and phone numbers.\nYour 3G phones will simply try to connect to the closest 3G cell towers.\nIf they can't they will fallback to the closest GSM tower available (it can be 2G or plain GSM if 2G is not available).\nNon 3G phone are not aware of 3G, so they will look for the closest 2G tower (or the closest GSM tower for a plain GSM phone). They will join the closest in their generation.\nSo from what you say we can conclude that where you live there must be a 2G tower nearby but the closest 3G tower if further away or the 2G signal on the tower is stronger than the 3G. So you will always get a lower signal on 3G.\nIf you really need stronger coverage at your house (your office is in the cellar or whatever and you are afraid to loose cell access) there are 2 solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask your carrier to improve 3G/LTE coverage in your area.\n\n*or if you have a good internet connection at home request a FemToCel for your house.\n\n\nBut even if your phone looses signal it will fallback to the closest signal in the lower generations. So you shouldn't have any (major) interruptions even with lower 3G signal.\n", "Q: iTunes on Windows 7 loses connection to other iTunes or Apple TV 2 I can start iTunes on my Windows 7 desktop, and can browse it from my Apple TV 2.

I am running Remote Desktop to connect from my iMac with Snow Leopard to a Windows box at work that runs Windows 7 Professional. The connection is done over ssh.\nWhen logged in to the window box I can use Alt + Tab to switch between programs, I can also see that when using emacs pressing Alt registers as Meta (which is what I have set it up as).

There has been little written technically about the Carrier IQ software on iPhones despite it being present on iOS 3, 4, and now iOS 5. \nFrom what I can tell, the daemons vary depending on the firmware version of the device (as well as where the default log files lie):\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS 3: /usr/bin/IQAgent logs to /var/logs/IQAgent\n\n*iOS 4: /usr/bin/awd_ice2 or /usr/bin/awd_ice3 logs to /var/wireless/Library/Logs/IQAgent\n\n*iOS 5: /usr/bin/awd_ice2 or /usr/bin/awd_ice3 logs to /var/wireless/Library/Logs/awd\nTo avoid a huge effort to answer this - I've provided the iOS 3 and 4 information to illustrate the length these have been around but would be happy to get answers focused exclusively on the iPhone data collected under iOS 5. More general or detailed answers are always welcome, but I'll choose the best answer that covers iOS5 and:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is personally identifiable or data associated with my unique device / serial number collected?\n\n*Does this collected data sync to my computer to iCloud?\n\n*Is some or all of the data transmitted over the air or WiFi directly to anyone other than Apple?\n\n\nSince there are many variables, please try to provide the carrier you have, the phone model as well as whether you opted in to send this diagnostic data. All reports I have seen is this software only runs when you opt in and cleans up / stops reporting as soon as you opt out.\n\n\nA: It appears that very little, and it can be completely disabled.\n\nCarrier IQ, the now infamous “rootkit” or “keylogger”, is not just for\n  Android, Symbian, BlackBerry, and even webOS. In fact, up through and\n  including iOS 5, Apple has included a copy of Carrier IQ on the\n  iPhone. However, it does appears to be disabled along with diagnostics\n  enabled on iOS 5; older versions may send back information in more\n  cases. Because of that, if you want to disable Carrier IQ on your iOS\n  5 device, turning off “Diagnostics and Usage” in Settings appears to\n  be enough.\nhttp://blog.chpwn.com/post/13572216737\n\n\nA: In iOS 5 /usr/bin/awd_ice3 (I don't have awd_ice2) contains some paths and then a lot of unreadable data (opened as text). Maybe it's encrypted/compressed?\n/var/wireless/Library/Logs/awd is empty as it should be as I have not enabled sending Diagnostics and usage (will test and update in a few days).\nMy iPhone 4 was bought in Italy and the carrier is 3 (H3G).\n", "Q: Are the Carrier IQ daemons installed on iOS devices other than iPhones? For iOS 5, are either of the Carrier IQ daemons installed as part of the base software on any non phone device image such as the iPad, iPod Touch or Apple TV ?\nOn iPhones (iOS 5) these programs are /usr/bin/awd_ice2 or /usr/bin/awd_ice3\nIf yes, what causes them to run and to where does their data get stored or forwarded?\n\nI am aware of the work @chpwn is doing and publishing on the chpwn blog but that is iPhone specific so far. I'm looking for hard evidence that the software is or isn't on the base OS for non-phone devices as well as if they actually generate local log files (presumably only when the collect diagnostic data switch is turned on since on iOS that is an opt-in service that does let you know data will be collected).\n\nA: I just did a quick check on my iPod4,1 running iOS 5.0.1. Those two binaries are not present in that folder. However, I have seen mentions of IQ in other parts of the system such as var/wireless/Library/Logs/awd (empty) and var/root/Library/Logs/awd (empty) and com.apple.iqagent.plist in var/mobile/Library/Preferences. The only value in that plist is DiagnosticsAllowed = false. I would conclude that Carrier IQ is not present on 4th Generation iPod Touches running iOS 5.0.1.\n\nA: Well tauw has done some research on this: http://www.tuaw.com/2011/11/30/carrier-iq-references-found-in-ios-5-probably-benign/\nBut better yet is te read this: http://www.xydo.com/toolbar/41016399?subject_id=1004\nIt talks about all version of iOS 3 and up may include the Carrier QI software.\n\nA: According to the chpwn blog, answer is yes it's installed bUt keylogging not activated.

Unfortunately, now iPhoto thinks the photos that were restored from backup are new photos, and so it does not hide them when I choose \"hide already imported\" in the import screen. Is there a way to get it to recognize that these photos are already in the library? I'm using iPhoto '09.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the only way seems to be to import the duplicates and keep them, while manually deleting the original copy (i.e. the one imported from the old iPhone).\n\nA: I'm assuming that the photos you're talking about are on the Camera Roll on the iPhone? You could let iPhoto go ahead with the import anyway and when it recognizes duplicate photos it will prompt you if you want to re-import them or not. Just choose No at that point. I'm not 100% sure, but I believe that after that it will regard the photos on your iPhone to have been imported and not show them any more if you have \"Hide already imported\" selected.\n", "Q: Technical information about the iPhone touchscreen controller? I want to make a driver for low-level access to the iPhone's touchscreen controller, the Texas Instruments TI 343S0538, so I can try to detect fingerprints. However, I can't seem to find any information about it, because the Google search results don't return much information, apart from lots of pages showing the iPhone specs. \nSo does anyone know anything about the controller, or is it secret because it's used by Apple?\n\nA: As Global nomad said in the comments, this seems to be a custom chip, and their website doesn’t contain any information on the chip.\nHowever, ABI Research has a teardown of the chip, although I don’t know how comprehensive or thorough it is. The (paid) report can be found at http://www.abiresearch.com/research/1009855. The list of the documents in the report reads “Specification”. This could be provided by Texas Instruments, or it could be compiled by ABI.\nThe search results on the website say, \"This file is not available to the public, but it is available for purchase.” There isn’t an obvious buy button, so it’s possible that we can’t purchase it. But that might be worth chasing up — that’s the best that I can fine.\n", "Q: A better way to remove keyboard grease from a MacBook Air's normal keyboard? The grease stain on a black keyboard looks awful. What are the recommended steps to remove the grease?\nI have found some posts online suggesting pure alcohol as a solvent. (one such CNET forum)\nIs this advice trustworthy? \n\nA: Alcohol is the best answer; it dissolves grease.  Power down, soak a cloth with isopropyl (at least 70%), and gently rub the keys until clean.  As an added bonus, the alcohol will kill the germs on the keyboard, which are notorious for collecting them.\nAs you can see in the article How to clean Apple products, alcohol and ammonia based cleaners are specifically not recommended for displays and iOS devices, but not listed as problematic on portables and desktop machines.\n\nA: The ideal solution (that I've found after years of cleaning Apple products) is not to use alcohol directly. Instead, mix it with water. The proportion to mix is simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Three parts isopropyl alcohol\n\n*Seven parts water\n\n\nI use a bottle cap, fill it with alcohol three times then the same cap with water seven times (you can use something bigger if you want more).\nWith that solution, you're safe to clean all your mac and the alcohol presence guarantees a slow but secure grease removal without leaving the typical alcohol stain/residue that occurs when you use pure alcohol. Also the low concentration makes it safer against things that may get damaged by the usage of pure alcohol like rubber compounds or human skin. \nFor occasional cleanup you can use the simple, free and excellent Keyboard Cleaner. All it does is make your screen black (so you can clean it better) and lock your keyboard so you don't trigger accidental keys while cleaning. Of course, you can always shutdown the computer too. \nRegarding products like iKlear and such, they are ok, in fact I'd recommend you always get a bottle of iKlear around, it's good to have and their small wet towels are very handy for quick clean. Remember never to use toilet/kitchen paper, use instead any \"approved\" cloth (like iKlear, TomBihn, etc.) the \"micro fibers\" are designed to not scratch your surface. \nI wouldn't use pure alcohol.\n\nA: Try a silicone keyboard cover from kbcovers.com. These work great with typing, keep dust and debris from getting between keys, and also prevent the keys from getting greasy.\n\nA: I've just removed one of those sillicon covers that I bought to leave the keyboard pristine in order to resell it, but it left a sticky residue that I'm now here looking for how to remove it, because the apple recommended cloth + water didn't make the job.\n\nA: The recommendation from apple website is to use a wet wipes (for clean kitchen, etc) ;)\nI am using, and it works great! \n", "Q: TextEdit is not working TextEdit is not working.

I first encountered BB way back in the day on OS7, and it was more editor than I needed at the time, and it only confused me. Since then I've become a much heavier-duty text editor user, and when they brought out a new release a couple months ago I pulled the trigger.\nIt's EXCELLENT. Every feature I've wanted, it's had for me, waiting to discover. Can't recommend it highly enough. You can find it on the App Store.\n\nA: TextWrangler. I, too, use Notepad++ on Windows.\n\nA: BBEdit is excellent, I program more for the iPhone or Mac these days which means I'm always using Xcode, but when I am doing anything web oriented, BBEdit is my first choice.\n\nA: Emacs, or the version that comes with OS X.  I use this for all of my documenting, coding, and paper writing (with LaTeX, and usually Org-Mode).\n\nA: Of course VIM, you can use MacVim or use vim in terminal or use vim in iTerm2 \n\nA: My personal favorite is Sublime Text 2.\nhttp://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-2-beta\nIt supports TM bundles and it works on windows/mac/linux.\n\nA: Eclips, Aptana, CodeEdit, TeXtMate, XCode Coda,...

How can I know if an app of an unknown author (like gTasks) is reliable for me to give my mail password to use it?\n\nA: You have to trust the developer of the app. Period. \nBesides code analysis there is no way to eliminate the possibility that an app does send your password somewhere. \nAnd even tools like Little Snitch won't help you if the app is allowed to send emails from your account. \nIf you send an email to somebody it would just use the established connection to afterwards send another email with your password. Since the connection is encrypted you can't see what the app is doing. And because the whole purpose of the app is sending emails the connection is not suspicious at all. Same thing is true for all apps that need access to the internet, if you enter the password to an facebook app it could just use facebook to send a private message with your password and so on.  \nTo make it even more difficult to detect, the developer could implement it in a way that the malicious routine waits 30 days before it sends your password. And if the developer is a smart criminal (he wrote a great app so he probably is) he can detect testers who just fast forward their device date setting too.\nIf the developer is smart it is nearly impossible to figure such things out without looking at the code. \nEntering your password somewhere is all about trust.\nAnd with all those apps from unknown developers it's hard to figure out which app you can trust enough to give it your password.\nThat's the reason Twitter, among others, uses an authentication process where the app never knows your password. \nHaving a different password for different services helps in case you have accidentally trusted an untrustworthy developer.\nBut your email password is a little bit special because usually it can be used to gain access to almost all services you use. \n\nA: I'd do the following: use two step authentication in Google, create a password specifically for the app, and then from this page you can check the last time that certain password has been used. If it always correspond to your last gTask usage, then you should be safe.\nIf that's not the case, you can revoke the password from there.\nNote: with this method the developer could read your mail anyway, so better be safe than sorry. However you could create a dummy account and see whether that gets hacked.\n\nA: Something like a Little Snitch will help you to determine if app creates any outbound connection besides obvious connection to Google servers.\nIt still possible for the app to just send your data to google account of rough developer but I don't have idea how to check that.\n\nA: If you are not sure about an application search google for reviews or at least a website. If a lot of people complain you wil know not to download the application.\nIn general you can't trust anyone with your details and it is best to keep them as much as possible to yourself. If you do have to give out your details, make sure you use a different password each time. It will be hard to remember all your passwords, but it also keeps your accounts such as your email or facebook safe.\n", "Q: Finder dragging hang / stuck Sometimes when dragging files from folder to another, or moving a folder, the items being dragged are stuck in the dragging mode and it hangs. I can see Finder use 30-35% CPU at that moment. \nAnyone facing the same problem?\nI'm on 10.7.2 also using FlexiGlass for Window moving/resizing.\n\nA: *\n\n*I would say restart you Mac if you have not done so in a while.\n\n*Try repairing the disk and repairing permissions in Disk Utility. \n\n*Next try deleting your Finder preferences. Your looking for a file called: \ncom.apple.finder.plist\nNote you might want to back this file up before deleting, if you spent a lot of time configuring Finder view, etc and this turns out to not fix the issue. \nThis file will be located at /Users/YourUSERname/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\n\n*Restart and see if it happens anymore.\n\n*Try installing Onyx and use it to reset Finder related settings.\n\n*Try removing FlexiGlass if you suspect that is causing issues.\n\n*Try logging in as another user and see if the issues comes up while logged in as another user.\n\n*If all else fails, back up your stuff and reinstall Lion.\n\nA: If this happens again, try restarting the Finder service by the following commands:\nlaunchctl stop com.apple.Finder\nlaunchctl start com.apple.Finder\n\n\nA: TEMPORARY FIX \nOk, this is very a very odd & temporary fix but apparently put your mac to sleep and then wake it if you are having this finder hanging issue and it should resolve it. I thought I resolved the issue by deleting finder prefs but it came back a week later. Apparently there is a bug in lion that many other users are experiencing in 10.7.2 and 10.7.3. After waking from sleep I have noticed the issue is always gone, however it will not last across a reboot. Hopefully this is affecting enough users that it makes its way to apple engineers so they can correct it for the next point update.\n", "Q: Upgrade from Tiger to Snow Leopard I have a 2006 MacBook (white, Core Duo) on which the hard disk crashed (it's not even recognized by the system anymore).\nI will need to replace the hard disk, possibly with an SSD one, but since I was still running Tiger I figured out it's probably as good a time as any to upgrade that as well.\nHowever, when Snow Leopard was introduced, I seem to remember the cheaper upgrade disk required Leopard to be installed. Nowadays, it seems only that disk is available from Apple, and it doesn't really specify Leopard as a requirement. I don't see a \"full install\" disk any more (and to be honest I'm not sure I want to pay that price either.)\nDid Apple change this requirement because they don't care as much about older versions any longer, or is it still there, but undocumented?\nWill I be able to install Snow Leopard from scratch on a new, blank, disk, without having any copy of Leopard whatsoever? Would it be legal?\n\nA: While Apple stated that Leopard was required to install Snow Leopard, there was no technical limitation put in place. \nFrom the day it came out Snow Leopard could be installed over top of Tiger or as a clean install. I don't believe Apple has ever released an 'upgrade' OS. The full installs have always been available, at least since OS X.\n\nA: You can install from scratch!\nWhen using a new SSD, format as GUID before installing. Also you should check whether you got the latest firmware on your SSD.\nAbout the apple's policies: I don't think anyone can answer that question. It would be rather speculative.\n", "Q: In Lion can I get the four fingere swipe to do COMMAND+Tab?

In Windows, one can hit Shift+F10 to access the \"Context Menu.\" But a similar keyboard action doesn't seem possible on Mac. One potential application...\nWhen I make a spelling error in a document, Lion gives me the option to correct the error by right-clicking (or ctrl-clicking, two-finger tapping, etc) on the misspelled word and bringing up the context menu.\n\nHow can I open this menu from the keyboard? And is it possible to access the Context Menu from a Mac keyboard?\n\nA: I always have the same question but I didn't find the answer yet.\nIn Windows, when we use the keyboard short-cuts we mostly use the Menu key in Windows keyboard:\n\nWhen this Menu key is pressed, Windows will assume that you right-clicked the highlighted/active element > then it will show you the context menu even if the mouse pointer is not pointing to the highlighted element.\nSo this feature seems to be missing in Mac OS. And whatever suggested solutions, even Enable Mouse Key it always require you to point/move your mouse pointer to element first, which is meaningless. If I need to use the keyboard short-cut to open the context menu on the highlighted item, why do I need again to move the mouse pointer to it also. Somehow this is not a short-cut!!\n\nA: ALMOST SOLVED\nI got this solution to work in some Applications (like Finder, TextEdit, Firefox, ...) but not others (like Outlook, Chrome, ... )\nA 'context click' can be mapped to a key/key-combo using all native Mac OS X features (thanks to its NeXT/OPENSTEP heritage).  However, the solution is pretty technical \"under the cover\" stuff, and it may take some trial-and-error to get it to work.\nRead about Key Bindings here, and follow (some) of the instructions to create your own  ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict file.\nKey Bindings map keys (or key-combinations) to \"Responders\" inside the Text System.\nI found the Responder for rightMouseDown here, and found the \"magic string\" for my desired target key (F13) from this url:  osxnotes.net/keybindings.html\nMy ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict looks like this\n{\n    /* Context Menu */\n    \"^\\Uf710\" = \"rightMouseDown:\";  /* Ctrl-F13 */\n    \"^;\" = \"rightMouseDown:\";       /* Ctrl-; */\n}\n\nNow I should be able to hit either Ctrl-F13  or Ctrl-; to get the context menu.\nNOTE: You will have to quit & relaunch an Application to have it pick-up changes.  (Worked for TextEdit in 10.10)  Otherwise, log-out & log-back in.\n\nA: Close to what you've asked, is to enable spelling auto-correction via:\n\nand then stay with your cursor at the end of a mispelled word, so you'll get an iOS style correction-suggestion:\n\nthen with down-arrow and left/right-arrows you can choose the correct word.\n\nA: I use Alfred with RightClick workflow.\nI mapped Option+CMD+Enter to trigger a right click in the frontmost application.\nRightClick used to work only in Finder but it was improved to work in most applications.\nNOTE: As of Aug 4 2021 changes  they reverted back to only support Finder\n\nA: Solution update for more recent OS versions (e.g. Monterey 12.6)\nNote: it is the position of the pointer and not that of the cursor that determines where the contextual menu pops up.\nHead to:\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences ➤ Accessibility\n\n*Scroll down on the left menu to Motor ➤ Pointer Control\n\n*At the top choose Alternative Control Methods tab\n\n*Check Enable alternative pointer actions\n\n*Click on the Options... button at its right side\n\n\nThe default option for the Right Click action is fn+F12, but this can be changed by double clicking on that F12 option. Instead of keyboard shortcuts, facial expressions can also be used as an option (e.g. Stick Tongue Out) by clicking the + button.\n\n Credit goes to user Giuseppe's comment and nohillside♦ for suggesting the edition\n\nOriginal solution\nThe context menu can primarily be opened by a right mouse click only. But in the Universal Access settings in the System Preferences we can control mouse keys by using the keyboard number pad. When activated, a right mouse click then can be achieved by Ctrl+5 on a keyboard with a numpad or Fn+Ctrl+i on a laptop. This will allow you to trigger a right-click, but at the spot the mouse cursor is hovering, not where your text cursor is.\nGo to System Preference → Universal Access → Mouse → Enable Mouse Keys (ON):\n\nFound on: https://stackoverflow.com/a/11238186/1919382\n\nA: You can use Better Touch tool to set up any tap/swipe/click/key combination to the right click.\n\nA: If you have \"correct spelling automatically\" checked and it doesn't seem to be working, it might be because you're trying it in an unsupported application. E.g., I can use the feature in TextEdit and Pages but not, e.g., FireFox or SublimeText 2 (two of my most used apps). \nTho I've spent way too much time looking, I haven't found any way of getting the suggested spellings from the context menu with the keys alone.  The best option I've found so far is to use my thumb on the track pad to position the mouse and then hold ctl and tap (again with the thumb). It takes a bit longer because of the need for positioning, but at least I can keep my fingers on the home row. \nI find it awkward to reach the ctl button, so I've used KeyRemap4MacBook (which is generally awesome and free) to customize the layout to make caps lock be ctl.  KeyRemap will also let you assign ctl + click to button combinations, so you don't have to tap/click.\n\nA: Try press [fn]+[SHIFT]+[F10]\nTo me it seems that most windows on mac F-keys can be called this way.\nCheers!\n\nA: Cmd+Shift+: Opens “Spelling & Grammar” on Chrome for me with El Capitan.

This is a great utility for automating your mac.\n\n*Add this script to hammerspoon config (which is located at ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua).\n\n\nhs.hotkey.bind({\"shift\"}, \"F10\", function()   local point =\nhs.mouse.getAbsolutePosition()   local clickState =\nhs.eventtap.event.properties.mouseEventClickState\nhs.eventtap.event.newMouseEvent(hs.eventtap.event.types[\"rightMouseDown\"],\npoint):setProperty(clickState, 1):post()\nhs.eventtap.event.newMouseEvent(hs.eventtap.event.types[\"rightMouseUp\"],\npoint):setProperty(clickState, 1):post() end)\n\n\n\n*Reload the config in hammerspoon menu: File -> Reload config.\n\nIf you press shift + F10 you'll get a right click, just to be Windows congruent, but you can change the keybinding to anything you'd like. Just make sure you keep any modifiers: cmd, shift, ctrl, alt in the squiggly brackets {}\nSay you wanted it to be control + alt + spacebar, then the binding would look like this:\n\nhs.hotkey.bind({\"ctrl\", \"alt\"}, \"space\", ..\n\n\nA: shift+F10 can be used in many Microsoft apps.\nalso, if you are using remote desktop of Windows on Virtual Machine this shortcut is very handy.\n", "Q: iMessage: Receiving at two devices I got a new iPhone 4S, but I had upgraded my old iPhone 4 to iOS 5.

I'm just migrating from Ubuntu Linux to Mac, and everything is new and I'm re-learning a lot of stuff.\nOn Linux I had the excellent apt-get to manage software packages. I googled for an alternative on Mac and found about MacPorts, Fink and Homebrew.\nI will use this computer primarily to develop Ruby on Rails applications.\nSo, what are the differences between them? Which are the upsides and downsides? Which one is best maintained and has more packages?\n\nA: MacPorts\nIt is more independent of Mac OS X, this means MacPorts will just ignore many of the system libraries and software that's already available in Mac OS X and pull its own one instead, which could be slower when the utility you install requires some set of large libraries and software.\nBut this kind of choice is safer because the packages you installed are less influenced by Apple's system update/upgrade procedure.\n\nHomebrew\nIt is more dependent on existing Mac OS X installed packages, so this will speed up the installation of packages and minimize redundant libraries.\nBut the risk is installed packages might be broken because of Apple's system update/upgrade.\nSo, these are the two different kind of tradeoff.\nAlso, Homebrew takes over /usr/local by default, which some folks don't like because it somehow conflicts with the Unix tradition and might cause problems if you’ve already installed anything there (MySQL, etc.)\n\nApart from these differences, considering the packages these two can offer, you can check with these two commands if you already have MacPorts/Homebrew installed, which show you the packages they currently provided:\nport list | wc -l\nbrew search | wc -l\n\nAnd you will find out that MacPorts has many more packages than Homebrew.\n(19399 v.s 3583  on May 13 2016)\n\nA: Just to add some of my own thoughts that seem true-ish circa late 2014 at least.\nHomebrew, as of a couple of years ago, definitely has the upper hand in terms of mindshare. You'll find a lot of blogs with people talking about how much happier they are with Homebrew - usually because of the whole \"MacPorts pulls in the whole world\" vs \"Homebrew makes use of what you already have\" thing.\nHowever, IMO, MacPorts is a different beast now than it was a couple of years ago. When I first switched to OS X & was using MacPorts the MP philosophy was indeed frustrating because almost everything was built from source. A new installation was particularly painful/slow. However over the past year or so, based purely on my own impressions, it seems like 90% of MP packages are binaries & so installation is actually really fast now. From what I gather Homebrew is also moving in this direction with \"Bottles\" but i get the impression that most things you install via HB at this point in time will be compiled from source.\nSo, if only to offer a countervailing opinion, MacPorts seems to actually be the \"faster \" option these days. However most peoples opinions of MP seem to be based on experiences from circa 2011-12 or so & don't really take this into account. Take this with a grain of salt though as I'm not a regular HB user (and its rather painful to use both side by side).\nI do think HB has advantages that mean it will probably \"win the war\" in the long run though\n\n*\n\n*HB is all Ruby whereas MacPorts, and its package formulae, are written in TCL which is....not exactly a popular scripting language. That said its pretty damn simple to create your own portfile.\n\n*HB is based around GitHub & thus seems a lot more welcoming to new contributors whereas MacPorts hosts its own SVN repository somewhere I think - which basically reflects the different ages of both projects I suppose. \n\n*HB and Macports now both use Github to manage their formulae, portfiles and source code to provide their functionality.\n\n*As mentioned the general consensus is that MacPorts has been superseded by HB &, rightly or wrongly, that draws more people towards it.\n\nOtherwise YaOZl & kLy covered the main difference in terms of sudo, dependencies etc pretty well. Personally I do find that MacPorts sometimes leads to some headaches in terms of other programs not expecting anything to be in /opt/local, things being installed with root permissions etc & there are some things that are generally best not installed with MacPorts (e.g. you can install Rails via MacPorts but you'd be crazy not to install it via Ruby's normal Gem management). Other than that though I'm a big fan of the MacPorts philosophy of building its own little world & not relying on some prepackaged OS X library - when it works, and it mostly does, everything is dead simple. Which is what you want of a Package Manager really. And as i mentioned, at this point in time its pretty damn quick to set most things up.\nHope some of that was useful.\n\nA: I am in China and visiting github often fails, which makes installing brew quite a pain. I know some brew mirror in China, so I raised an issue against brew Provide an easy way to change homebrew's origins. They fixed it in 2.3. But even with that installing brew is still not smoothing, e.g. I hit several times that after installation, brew can't find any formula.\nqiulang@qiulangdeMacBook-Air redis % brew info wget\nError: No available formula with the name \"wget\".\n==> Searching for a previously deleted formula (in the last month)...\nError: No previously deleted formula found.\nqiulang@qiulangdeMacBook-Air redis % brew info redis\nError: No available formula with the name \"redis\".\n==> Searching for a previously deleted formula (in the last month)...\nError: No previously deleted formula found.\n\nNow I know I need to \"re-tap\" but during those times I just didn't know the exact reason except installing brew was not successful.\nOut of desperation I switched macports and it works quite smoothly so far.\n\nA: Something which other answers (so far) don't appear to have mentioned  is that MacPorts has excellent support for legacy versions of macOS. Homebrew only supports the OS's that are currently supported by Apple, which usually means the last three releases. For example, as of February 2022, only Monterrey, Big Sur, and Catalina are compatible with Homebrew.\nBy contrast, MacPorts can be installed on Tiger (!), and the project maintains special patches to keep software working wherever possible. This includes a \"Legacy Support\" library which backports functions from newer versions of macOS to older ones; linking against this library while compiling can make a variety of new software suddenly work on older systems!\nSo, if you're running an old version of macOS, or if you think you may need to stay on a current OS past Apple's expiration date, you should probably go with MacPorts.\n\nA: Brew was completely smooth for me to use, so I'm unable to tell about its cons. Some disadvantages of MacPorts:\n\n*\n\n*you have to install Xcode from the Apple Developer site, hence you must have an Apple developer account (which now requires credit card) or the Mac OS App Store (no developer account needed) and download XCode;\n\n*if port 873 (rsync) is blocked by your firewall, you'll have to manually configure the HTTPS protocol;\n\n*the HTTP(S) server from which packages are downloaded is (often) extremely slow (under 20 KiB/s yesterday; tested from a couple very reliable Gigabit connections in different countries) and may fail with error Operation too slow. Less than 1024 bytes/sec transferred the last 60 seconds, forcing you to redo everything from scratch.\n\nThere are several very popular questions about the first two points.\n\nA: Definitely Homebrew. I started with Fink, then switched to MacPorts (happier), then Homebrew (much, much happier). These are my reasons for using each (a pro list if you will):\nFink\n\n*\n\n*Apt-based - feel right at home if you come from a Debian-based environment.\n\nMacPorts\n\n*\n\n*Unlike homebrew do not depend on MacOS library that may change in the future.\n\n*Install everything in: /opt/local\n\n*Nice variants system that lets you customise the build.\n\n*Easy and intuitive port files, also allows you to add your own.\n\n*Supports many versions of macOS going back to Mac OS X Tiger including PowerPC versions see other answer.\n\nHomebrew\n\n*\n\n*Maximum leveraging of what comes with OS X. Unlike Fink or MacPorts, it does not require you to build/install ruby and libraries from scratch just to install some small Ruby-based tool.\n\n*Installs into /usr/local (Intel) or /opt/homebrew (Apple Silicon)\n\n*Install without root access.\n\n*Every installed package is cleanly sandboxed into its own cellar so you don't have stray files all over your system, just symlinks from bin, man, etc.\n\n*Has guides and automation to create your own formula files (ie. package descriptors).\n\n*Written in ruby and all formulas are concise ruby scripts.\n\npkgin\n\n*\n\n*Everything installed in: /opt/pkg\n\n*Backed by pkgsrc community and Joyent\n\n*Known to work on NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, Solaris, Debian, macOS, Minix\n\nhttps://pkgsrc.joyent.com/install-on-osx/\nhttp://pkgin.net/\n", "Q: Tools to compress and encrypt files I want to compress several files and encrypt them with a password if possible.\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there any build-in tools in Mac OS that provide such functionality?\n\n*If not, can you recommend me a (freeware) alternative?\n\n*I'd also be happy with a terminal command.\n\n\nA: The easiest way to compress is to just right-click any file and select the appropriate option to create a zip file (without password though).\nOn command-line/Terminal level there are at least\n\n\n*\n\n*zip which supports encryption (zip -P password ...)\n\n*gzip which doesn't\n\n*openssl which only encrypts (so compress with gzip first), e.g. openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -e -in note.txt -out note.txt.enc -pass pass:money\nFor zip and openssl the password will be visible to all users while the encryption is running. This is usually not a problem on a desktop system, otherwise you may consult the openssl man page for ways to read the password from a file or similar.\n\nA: Yes, you can do this using the built-in Disk Images of Mac OS X. A disk image (or DMG file) is a file which, when opened, presents itself as a removable Mac OS X volume, similar to a removable hard drive. Many OS X applications are deployed on disk images. If you encrypt your home directory using FileVault, you're creating a spare bundle disk image.\nYou can create OS X disk images which are compressed and/or encrypted.  However, if you create a compressed DMG, it will be read-only, so that may or may not work for you.\nTo create a new, empty encrypted disk image in OS X:\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility, which is under the \"utilities\" folder of the \"Applications\" folder.\n\n\n*From the File menu choose New > Blank Disk Image...\n\n\n*In the dialog that appears, you can specify where to save the disk image, the name of the volume, and choose the type of encryption:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure to choose either \"128-bit AES encryption (recommended)\" or \"256-bit AES encryption (more secure)\" from the \"Encryption\" menu. Also, be sure to set a size for the disk image.\n\n\n*If you create a sparse bundle (newer, and may be more reliable) or a spare image (older, can become corrupted easily if it's open and your computer is shut down improperly) then the image file will start small and will grow as you add files to it, up to a maximum size you specify.\n\n\n*If you create a \"read/write disk image\", then the image file will start at the maximum size specified in the dialog box.\nAfter you save the disk image file, you'll be prompted for a password and verification. Once completed, you'll have a new volume on your desktop and in the \"Computer\" view where you can begin dropping files!\n\nTo create a compressed, read-only image, you can do one of two things:\n\n*\n\n*Follow the same steps above, however instead of New > Blank Disk Image..., choose New > Disk Image From Folder.... This will first ask you to select a folder full of files. From there, it will present a similar dialog to the one above, but will not prompt for a volume name or size; it will use the name of the folder and the size will be automatically calculated. Be sure to choose to make a compressed image and don't forget the encryption\n\n\n\n*Alternatively, if you have created a blank image and filled it with files, you can convert that image to a compressed image. This is a handy way to back up your encrypted files. Keep the master read/write uncompressed image as your day-to-day workspace, and periodically convert it to a read-only compressed image which you can back up to an external device. To do this, choose Images > Convert... within Disk Utility. Select the DMG file, and then you'll see the same screen as above.\nProtip: if you drag and drop a folder onto Disk Utility's dock icon it will automatically offer to create a disk image out of that folder.\nProtip #2: If you create an encrypted disk image out of an unencrypted folder and you want to delete the original, unencrypted files, remember to use secure erase otherwise you risk leaving confidential information on your hard drive.\n\nA: You can do this with just tools in OSX\nFor simple compression right click on the file in Finder and choose compress..\nTo compress and add a password - With Disk Utility create a new disk image - choosing the Encryption and Image format options. Then copy the files into it.\nFrom the command line look at gzip and zip\n\nA: Though I recommend and use encrypted DMG files myself-see Josh's accepted answer–there is an alternative way to do this in Terminal using a combination of free and built-in tools.\nJason Seney explains in his article Open, Edit & Save Encrypted Files with Vim and GPG:\n\nUsing vim and gpg we can open, edit, and save only the encrypted file and leave nothing in plain text on the hard drive.\n\nUsing MacGP2 you can encrypt:\ngpg -c -o myfile.mkdn\n\nand decrypt:\ngpg -d myfile.mkdn.gpg \n\nJason's  article provides instructions to pipe files directly in and out of vim and the secret sauce for creating alias commands that make encrypting and decrypting easy.\nAs I said, I make use of the built-in DMG tools, but if you're a command line user, particularly of vim, or if you need to insure that plaintext copies of your secret files never exist on disk or in swap files, Jason's method is worth considering.\n", "Q: How can I install Snow Leopard on my 2011 Mac Mini Server? Can I install Mac OS X Snow Leopard on a 2011 Mac Mini Server? (I own the Server model because of its better CPU)\nI tried, connecting my MacBook (running Snow Leopard natively) via FireWire (in Target Disk Mode) and thereby installing Snow Leopard on my Mac Mini. It worked, however, glitches in graphics as well as an overall bad performance really freak me out.\nIs the 2011 Mac Mini really that different from the 2011 MacBook Pros? Might it be that Snow leopard just doesn't load the correct drivers since it does not know the 2011 mac Mini? If so, is there a way of manually adjusting this?\nI don't like Lion on my Mac Mini since I run two monitors with it, and Mission control plain sucks in that regard compared to Spaces. I'm not interested in the Server Features.\n\nA: Short answer: no.\nThe i7 in the new 2011 Server model doesn't support anything less than pretty much the original OS.\n\nSorry dude. I wanted to do the exact same thing.\n\nA: Simple - virtualize it.\nI am not a lawyer, but the end user license for Snow Leopard has zero references (and therefore zero restrictions) on virtualiziation and simply requires you to run one copy of the software on Apple hardware.\n... you are granted a limited non-exclusive license to install, use and run one (1) copy of the Apple Software on a single Apple-branded computer at a time.\n\nAs long as you don't run two copies of \"the Apple Software\" which is Snow Leopard you should be in compliance with the licensing terms. You also happen to be running a copy of Lion and some VMWare or Parallels or other software, but why not look into this? It's clearly the best way to get a real Snow Leopard environment without sacrificing hardware drivers needed to run the newer hardware and graphics. You will have to google the \"tricks\" to get this running, but many tech blogs have the details depending on which VM you choose to run.\n\nAnd yes, the drivers are both new and missing on Snow Leopard to make the new hardware run properly. Fans, CPU performance and other issues are reported from people that have tried this on several late 2011 models and not just the Mac Mini.\n", "Q: How can I make rows and columns for Spaces in Lion? I just recently switched to Lion from Snow leopard and dealing with a few issues (like this question)\nI am still loving it, though.\nI used to have 3 X 3 spaces (I know, it's insane for some, but I like it), and liked that I can arrange things in a spatial arrangement.\nNow on Lion I get a 1 X 9 series of spaces, is there a way to enable the column X row configuration of Spaces in Snow Leopard back?\nEDIT: I've been using the four-fingere-up gesture for a while now and I dont miss spaces as much anymore! \n\nA: I’m pretty certain that you can't; you just get a single-line.\nFrom John Siracusa’s review of Lion (when describing the implementation of spaces in Mission Control):\n\nThe biggest limitation of this new arrangement is that Spaces are now confined to a one-dimensional line of virtual desktops. Four-finger swiping between spaces feels great, but there's no wrap-around when you hit the end.\n\n\nA: Mission Control desktop spaces are strictly linear. 1x9 is all you have, and 1x9 is all you'll get (for the foreseeable future anyways).\nGiven the use of 9(!) desktop spaces, the two fastest ways to navigate explicitly to one of them are the keyboard shortcuts, or explicitly launching the Mission Control interface and clicking on the specific desktop space you wish to use.\nAfter creating multiple spaces, you can go into your System Preferences and define a keyboard shortcut for each specific space.\nSystem Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts tab -> Mission Control category\n\n\nA: A new utility call ReSpaceApp promises this functionality:\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/1166316/promising_prospect_respaceapp_brings_spaces_to_lion.html\n", "Q: How do I hide 'Hidden' files?

Also, note that you'll need disks specifically for your model, as there was a special build of 10.5.7 (build 9J3050) with support for the new hardware in the Mid-2009 MBPs.\nAnother possibility would be to borrow an older Mac that can boot 10.5.0, install the base OS and update it to 10.5.8, and then clone the volume to your MBP.  I'm pretty sure the drivers etc for that model got rolled into the standard build of 10.5.8, so it should work properly.  For cloning, I recommend putting one of the computers into target disk mode, so it essentially acts as a FireWire disk; then boot the other computer from a third volume (your MBP's 10.6 system should work), run Disk Utility, and use its Restore feature to copy the 10.5.8 volume onto a blank partition in the MBP (be sure the enable the Erase destination option).\nIn case of trouble, once you have the system installed you should probably make a disk image so you can restore it if anything goes wrong (you're running tests, right?).  Again, while booted from another volume (e.g. 10.6), run disk utility, choose File > New > Disk Image from Folder (don't use the from device option), select the entire bootable volume as the source \"folder\", save the image as either compressed or readonly on some volume with plenty of free space (compressed takes a lot longer to create, but the space saving is generally worth it).  Once that finishes, choose Images > Scan Image for Restore, and select the newly created image (again, this takes lots of space as it actually copies the entire image in the process of \"scanning\" it).  When that's finished (it takes quite a while -- everything in this process does), you have an image that can be used as a Restore source in Disk Utility.\n\nA: Ok, so here's how I resolved this:\nI called up the Apple Compatibility Lab in California and basically asked what to do. Of course, he knew exactly what I was talking about and was really happy to help.\nHe sent me a free copy of the exact DVD box that came with my mid-2009 MacBook Pro and paid for the shipping.\nWhat a cool dude and another good experience with Apple!\n", "Q: Numbers: How can I display negative values in a column chart?

Then you don't have to configure any usernames and passwords. And Postfix listens to localhost only by default.\n", "Q: Mini Lyrics Alternative For Mac Have you guys seen the \"mini lyrics\" app for windows? It downloads the lyrics of the currently playing song and displays it on the screen. The great thing about it is that it highlights the current part of the lyrics. Do you know any alternative of it for mac?\n\nA: Get Lyrical\nI use this. It will display the lyrics and add them to your iTunes library (if you choose to) I would highly recommend it.\nThere is also LessLyrics. I haven't used it before.\n\nA: Singer Song Reader\nI used to be very happy with the OS X version of minilyrics, but recently, it stopped working on my machine (OS X El Capitan 10.11.2, Itunes 12.3.2.35).\nWhat I really like with minilyrics was the ability of the app to find lyrics for almost every song, including for relatively obscur songs, and for songs in other languages than english.\nI've tried Get Lyrical, Lesslyrics, and other options, but I was never satisfied by the breadth of songs these apps could find lyrics for.\nThis was until I found Singer Song Reader which gives me as much satisfaction (if not more) as minilyrics.\n\nA: The music app itself will display the lyrics if they are in the ID3 tags.  Get Lyrica or Apple Music or hand editing can put them there.\n", "Q: Is a refurbished Macbook Pro's battery new? When you buy a refurbished Macbook direct from Apple, is the battery in it new? I cannot seem to find a definitive answer on their website or on the internet. I am concerned that the savings from buying a refurb will be cancelled out by having to replace the battery in less than a year.\n\nA: I called Apple's Sale Support, and I asked them what their policy was for batteries in a refurbished Macbook. Their answer is that the battery will be replaced if it has a defect, but if nothing is wrong with it, then the laptop will include the original battery which may or may not have many used cycles.\n\nA: This is not answering your question, merely providing a data point, but my refurbished MacBook Air (purchased very late December 2011) currently has a single cycle on its battery. I didn't check the machine when it came out the box, but I'd imagine it was probably at zero cycles when I received it (as I've probably put that cycle on it myself in the month I've had it).\n\nA: mine had 3 cycles when i received it. currently at 7% life left and have not yet charged it since I got it.\n\nA: I just received a refurbished 2015 MacBook Pro today (April 20, 2017) and the power cycles shows 0.  The product also looks brand new.\nI have bought several refurbished iPads before, and the same thing.\nI would guess the only way Apple leaves the original battery in there is if it had a relatively low power cycle count.  Apple wants you to buy the refurbished products from them.  And I stand by it.  Every refurbished product I have bought through them looks brand new.  Well worth it!\n\nA: I was told by an Apple employee (not a store employee) that most refurb computers are just returns and open boxes, and not computers that were actually used by anyway. \n", "Q: How can I move photos from iPhone to my local disk? This has me stumped. I have nearly 4GB of photos and videos on my phone, and I want to put them into my computer's pictures folder. \n\n\n*\n\n*I have opened Windows Explorer and found the photos in the weird location Computer\\Torbens iPhone 4\\Internal Storage\\DCIM\\800AAAAA, but I cannot copy or move the files from here to a local folder. When I try, Windows says \"Error copying file or folder. The parameter is incorrect.\"\n\n*I have synced with iTunes but don't see where iTunes would have made a backup copy of the photos. \nThis is immensely frustrating. I can't believe it has to be this difficult and I must be missing something, but I don't see what that is.\n1) How do I get my pictures off the phone and onto my local disk?\nAlso, it would be so much simpler if Windows would just assign a drive letter to the device, just like it does for my digital camera and any other USB storage I connect. Is there any way to make Windows do this, or is Apple being restrictive again?\n2) How can I get a drive letter assigned to the phone? (Less important but mighty annoying.)\nDetails:\niPhone4, iOS 4.1.2, iTunes 10.5.1.42, Windows 7.\nUpdate:\nAm I understanding correctly that neither of the sync nor backup functions in iTunes backs up the photos?\n\nA: When you plug your iPhone into your computer, Windows should pop up a dialog asking what you want to do with it. You should see an option to import photos. If you choose this, you can choose where you want the imported photos to be stored. You can also make 'import photos' the default behavior when you plug in your iPhone.\nYou are better off using the photo importer instead of trying to manually copy the files.\nIf you are using iCloud and Photostream, you can use the iCloud Control Panel to set up your computer to automatically import your Photostream photos. However, this only works with photos and not with videos.\n\nA: I have the same problem you have: I can copy the items one by one, but I cannot bulk copy 10 more items. To solve the problem, I use Picasa to import my iPhone photos, instead of using Windows Explorer copy. It works. \n\nA: According to this YouTube screencast, the error only appears when copying multiple folders at once. If you just copy one folder at a time, the error is avoided. It's a bit painful if you have many folders though.\n\n\nA: This might be a solution for you:\nWifi Photo Transfer\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wifi-photo-transfer/id380326191?mt=8\nAllows you to pull up your iPhone's images in the web browser of a nearby computer, view them and download them. The reviews are mixed but it might be worth a try and its free.\n\nA: Your iphone name may have an apostrophe (')in it and windows does not like them in a file path. You can try changing the name of your iphone from \"Torben's iphone\" to \"Torben iphone\" in the iphone general:about:name settigns. Then connect to your computer again and try the copy.\nThe same thing happens with wifi hotspots- see this article for an example:\nhttps://community.particle.io/t/using-an-iphone-as-a-wi-fi-hot-spot-helpful-tip/21919 \n", "Q: What are some ways to work with / search flagged emails on iOS? The Mail App on iOS 5 adds support for flagging emails, but I can't seem to find a way to actually put this feature to use.\nIs there a way to search for flagged emails?\nIs there a way to cleverly auto-filter flagged emails into a folder?\nI know that using GMail as an IMAP server automatically duplicates flagged messages in the \"Starred\" folder - but if you are using another email service, is there any way to make flags useful on iOS?\n\nA: In iOS there's very little you can actually do with the flags except for visual cues.\nOn the Mac however, you can filter flagged email into a Smart Mailbox which will keep a live view of your mail matching search criteria, such as mail flags.\n\nA: In iOS5 there is no way to easily find flagged emails.\nBut in the public preview of iOS 6 at WWDC (hence not under NDA), Apple showed off a new \"Flagged\" top level folder in the iOS Mail App, as well as a special folder for email from senders marked as VIP's.\nSo it appears that the ultimate answer to this questions is: upgrade to iOS 6.\n", "Q: How can I invert spelling proposals on iOS? Is there a way to invert the behavior of the spelling proposal ? \nBy \"invert\" I mean : \n\n\n*\n\n*Don't change what I have typed if I don't do anything special \n\n\nAND\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the proposal if I tap on it\n\n\nA: You can disable \"Auto-Correction\" under Settings > General > Keyboard.\nThe check spelling will still be on and taping on the word detected as wrong will prompt you the corrections.\n", "Q: How do I install virgin Leopard on external drive with iMac running Lion? I have a new iMac, quad core with Lion running. I want to install Leopard on an external drive to run some hardware that will not work work Lion.\nI have formatted the external drive as Mac OS journalled and used GUID but when trying to install Leopard the Installer will not let me choose different installation drive\n\nA: Short answer is: You can't. Your iMac will only boot up with OS X version that it originally came with, or newer. Since you mentioned you have a new iMac, guess is it's new enough that it won't boot up using a Leopard install, even if it's on an external drive.\n", "Q: Mac OS X file system and tagging question I recently (w/in the last year) have began integrating file tagging and use of meta-data heavily into my digital organizational system, on my MacBook Pro (running OS X Lion 10.7.2). To facilitate this, I've used the software \"Fresh\", which is a tagging software, which I use in conjunction with Leap (both made by Ironic software). \nThe basic idea behind what I'm doing is that I stop worrying about where I store things and I start religiously tagging everything and I then just find anything I need using search and tags. It has made a HUGE difference in my productivity and I've cutdown on occurrences of duplicate versions of files...etc. As part of the Leap/Fresh software system, you can mark a file as \"managed\" after you've tagged it and it then \"files\" it in a set of hierarchical folder that is organized by Year>Month>Day (e.g. \"~Filed Documents/2011/12/2\" would be the directory for any files I \"filed\" today). Here is my question:\nAt a core operating system level, would my system/search functions operate more efficiently if I dumped all my files into a central directory and then only had to search within that folder for tags (i.e. remove the hierarchical folder system)? I've searched online extensively and I've not been able to come up with a definitive answer. Thanks in-advance!\n\nA: No, I don't think so.  Spotlight indexes files in order for quick searching.  Once indexed, a file is very quick to find, the part that takes time is the actual indexing.  I suppose you could argue that the act of moving a file might cause it to be re-indexed (now that it's in a new location), but I don't know enough about how Spotlight works to be sure.  Either way, the difference you would notice would be minimal.  Once the initial indexing is done, the time spent adjusting the indexes is not big.\n", "Q: Properly sort multiple albums from one artist in a year in iTunes I am trying to clean up as much of the metadata as I can in my iTunes Library. One issue I came across is albums from a band, where the band releases multiple albums in a year. While this doesn't happen all that much, a good example is the Smashing Pumpkins, who released Machina in Feb. 2000, and then released Machina II later that year in Sept 2000. Live concerts are a great example as well, for example if you have recordings from different shows on a tour.\nIn iTunes, currently Machina II is before Machina (Probably because in ASCII 'I' may come before '/'. This wouldn't matter much, except all the other albums from this artist are in order. Every once in a while, I am in the mood to listen to a particular artists set of albums over the years, and you can see then this won't work out.\nIs there a way to say either what Month the album was released, or another workaround (other than just saying the next year for example)?\nUpdate: I looked through the AppleScript dictionary, and it doesn't look like you can access anything except the year through AppleScript either. \n\nA: The tag format iTunes uses allows the storage of year-month-day for release dates. You'll note if you buy songs from the iTunes store they frequently have the release date including the month and day. I do not know if iTunes actually obeys this data when sorting a list, but you can add it anyway, so it's worth experimenting. \nThe Get Info window won't let you add a month or day - there is only a year tag - but external tag editors certainly do. I had a simple one that looked like the iTunes Get Info window but with more options, I can't remember what it's called... I think MusicBrainz Picard also lets you enter month and day.\nIf you've edited a track with an external editor, you can force iTunes to refresh the data using an Applescript (assuming you're on Mac OS). There are other tricks that are documented here on the MusicBrainz site. The Applescript in question is near the bottom, I use it all the time after editing tags with Picard.\nEDIT: Let me know if it works, eh?\n\nA: Hey I have this exact same problem, and I think I figured it out.\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the selected album as a whole.\n\n*Go to the Sorting tab.\n\n*Under Sorting Album, for the album you would like to be second, type a number or any letter that is alphabetically before (if you want the album to be in front of another) then click OK.\n\n\nI did this with Syd Barrett's 2 solo albums that both came out in 1970. I didn't have to change anything on the first album he released, just on his second album, I typed the number 2 in the sorting album space and once I clicked OK it moved down below the 1st released album. \n\nA: If put a letter or number in front of the album title in the \"sort album\" field, when you sync to your ipod the album will show up alphabetically on the ipod under that letter or number when you search by Album on the ipod.  Still need a fix for this.\n\nA: For example. My iTunes is sorted to display albums by Artist then Year. Two albums by The Stranglers. Both 1977. Rattus Norvegicus released first then No More Heroes later in same year but they are displayed the other way around simply because 'N' for No More Heroes is alphabetically before 'R' for Rattus Norvegicus.\nRight click on the selected album as a whole.\nGo to the Sorting tab.\nLeave the 'album' box unchanged as No More Heroes\nIn the blank 'sort as' box underneath 'album' enter SNo More Heroes\nThe 'S' prefix on the newly inserted 'sort as' now makes the album show alphabetically after Rattus Norvegicus which begins with an 'R' and you haven't had to corrupt the actual album title itself.\n\nA: A variation on the above answers: instead of a letter of the alphabet or number, input the release date (in reverse). So...\nTwo albums by Steeleye Span released in 1975, Commoners Crown (January 1975) and All Around My Hat (October 1975). Here are my steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Info for Commoners Crown\n\n*Under the Sorting tab, left album unchanged\n\n*In the sort as box under album entered '197501Commoners Crown'\n\n\nRepeated this for All Around My Hat, entering '197510All Around My Hat'. \nSimple solution that satisfies my level of pedantry.\n", "Q: Can I Sync Two Macs With iCloud Instead Of MobileMe? If I move over to iCloud can I still sync two Macs (calendar and address book) as I am doing now with MobileMe? Or does iCloud only sync iOS devices?\n\nA: Yes as long as the Macs are all running Lion, there currently isn't any check that enforces the \"you need an iOS device to get iCloud started\".\nJust head on over to https://www.icloud.com and follow the instructions. The guides and tutorials that are linked as part of the signup process are fantastic and answer all of the questions you have about the service.\n\nIf you are not ready to start, you can see what the setup looks like on a Mac (or PC or iOS device) from How to set up iCloud.\n\nA: This link http://www.macworld.com/article/162953/2011/10/icloud_syncing.html has the information you're looking for. Note that there is requirement on the version of OS X of your Macs.\n\nA: iCloud syncs iOS 5 devices and Macs running Lion. By syncing we mean, Calendars, Contacts, Mail, Safari Bookmarks, Reminders, Notes and Photostream.\nDocuments in the cloud for syncing iWork documents is only half-baked.\nIn my experience it works really smoothly and is worth the upgrade to Lion. \n", "Q: How should I prep a laptop for a return? I'm returning a Macbook Air I purchased last week at an Apple Store (not because I don't like it, I just need a bit more screen real estate) and I want to make sure I put it in an acceptable state. I'd like to remove all the data that I've put on it in the last week but I don't want to go overboard.\nShould I format the drive and return it with no OS? Format and reinstall the OS? Leave it as-is and trust Apple refurb to not look at my data?\n\nA: If you're pressed for time, and since you mentioned the Macbook Air was new and purchased last week, it probably was installed with OS X Lion which has full-disk encryption. If this assumption is true, then\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your data. I'd recommend using Time Machine (so you don't\nhave to re-setup your user id, install apps, etc).\n\n*create another \"throwaway\" admin id, and log in to your \"throwaway\"\nadmin id\n\n*and delete yourself from the Mac using System Preferences -> Users & Groups preference pane.\n\n\nA: Wipe the disk. The apples will sure reinstall the OS.\n", "Q: Can a MacBook 2,1 (late 2006) running 10.4 be upgraded to Lion? I'm looking at upgrade options for a Macbook 2,1 with the following specs:\n  Model Name:   MacBook\n  Model Identifier: MacBook2,1\n  Processor Name:   Intel Core 2 Duo\n  Processor Speed:  2 GHz\n  Number Of Processors: 1\n  Total Number Of Cores:    2\n  L2 Cache (per processor): 4 MB\n  Memory:   1 GB\n  Bus Speed:    667 MHz\n  Boot ROM Version: MB21.00A5.B07\n  SMC Version:  1.17f0\n  Serial Number: XXXX\n  Sudden Motion Sensor:\n  State:    Enabled\n\nI'm seeing conflicting reports on various forums.\nCan someone tell me definitively what needs to happen to get this onto Lion?\nCheers,\nRob\n\nA: You need more RAM and Lion and you are good to go. I linked to one of many providers for RAM that works on your model.\n\nIf costs are tight, 2 GB of memory is the minimum requirement for Lion, so that's the only hardware problem assuming your hard drive isn't so full that you can't free up space for the initial install of either Snow Leopard or Lion (you have two paths to get Lion installed).\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the Lion USB key and hop straight to Lion realizing you will need to erase and migrate things by hand from your backup.\n\n*Get a retail Snow Leopard DVD (and optionally the Box Set if you want iLife to be updated but not purchased through the App store). Once you have the updates applied, you can then buy Lion upgrade from the App Store app.\n\n\nPlan on all your apps not working and you can be surprised if some of them do work. Do make a great backup (bootable one would be best on an external drive) so you can migrate a couple of times or boot and run your old system as you start using the new OS in case you forget some \"old documents\" or pictures or whatever is missing 3 or 6 months down the road.\nHave fun!\n\nA: According to Apple's own site, you need to upgrade first to Snow Leopard which requires these minimum requirements (Intel processor, 1GB memory, 5GB available disk space). From the Lion upgrade page, the requirements include:\n\nYour Mac must have an Intel Core 2 Duo, Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, or\n  Xeon processor to run Lion. Find out if your current Mac has one of\n  these processors by clicking the Apple icon at the top left of your\n  screen, then choosing About This Mac.\n\nSince your machine meets those requirements, purchase OS X Lion and proceed with the upgrade. Backing up would be a very good idea, since you'll be doing two OS upgrades.\n\nA: Yes, your machine will be able to run Lion as its processor has 64-bit support.\nHowever, I strongly recommend that you upgrade the RAM to the machine's max - which is 4GB fitted whilst the machine will only address 3GB. You can mix the modules, a 1GB with a 2GB module or use two 2GB modules.\nI'd generally not recommend going all the way up to Lion on this hardware though, I've seen it pinwheel a lot more than with Snow Leopard (10.6).\n\nA: Yes that computer can be upgraded to Lion, but Apple requires (recommends?) 2GB of RAM so you should upgrade that. Also you need to upgrade to Snow Leopard before you can upgrade to Lion.\nStep 1. Install more Ram\nStep 1.5 Make sure you have a good backup\nStep 2. Install Snow Leopard\nStep 3.Upgrade to Lion from The App Store.\nhttp://www.apple.com/macosx/specs.html\nhttp://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook/stats/macbook-core-2-duo-2.0-white-13-specs.html\n\nA: I just bought your same MacBook (however I have 2GB installed) for my 4th grader for her at school work.  It has been upgraded to Mac OS X version 10.7.5. and it works great!  Although I am planning to upgrade the memory to 2x2GB, shortly, but not because of any system issues...just because 4 is bigger/better than 2!\n", "Q: My Macbook's headphone jack stopped working, how do I fix it? my headphone jack output stopped working a couple days ago. As in - when I jack a cable (or headphones) the sound comes via the built-in speakers. \nOn the installed Windows (Bootcamp) it works OK (sound coming out via headphones when jacked in). \nAny ideas how I can troubleshoot this? \nThe OS is Lion, freshly updated (update after the problem first appeared). \n\nA: (posted as an answer so you can accept it and mark this issue resolved)\nHave you checked the Sound pref pane in System Preferences? There's a tab labeled \"Output\" where (I'd expect, as I don't have a portable in front of me just now) you can switch output between built-in speakers and the headphone jack. If the first toggle doesn't work, toggle it again.\n\nA: The question is quite old now, but issue still remains on latest macOS (former OSX) version 10.12.4 Beta (16E163f).\nOne day I was using the headphones and the next day headphones jack port stopped working.\nTried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Settings -> Sound -> \"Use audio port for: Sound output\"\n\n*Select headphones instead of any other thing on \"device for\nsound output\"\n\n*Reset NVRAM (previous PRAM)\n\n*Reset SMC\n\n\nNothing worked, then I tried to reboot with headphones plugged in, kind of worked, but if you unplug the headphones after rebooting, and then plug back in, it's not working anymore (it's kind of a workaround).\nSOLUTION: >> Shut Down -> Start MacBook and press CMD+R (Recovery Mode) -> Disk utility -> Select boot disk -> \"First Aid\" (both on the disk and the on the partition, did it also for the \"Recover Disk Image\", not sure if it helps) -> Reboot.\n\nSo far it's working fine.\nHope it solves your problem.\nP.S.:What I was going to try next (not sure if it's possible) was to update/force reinstall audio drivers.\n\nEDIT:\nIt stopped working, and looks like it's not possible to reinstall audio drivers)\nWorkaround: Without the need to reboot or anything, just: plug headphones in -> close the lid (sleep) -> open the lid (wake)\nSound should now be coming out through the headphones.\n", "Q: Is there an OS X terminal program that can access serial ports? What programs can act as a terminal and access serial ports?\nThis is not for terminal access on an IP connection, this is so I can access a hardware device plugged into a USB/serial converter running at 9600/8/N/1.\n\nA: There's a new Mac app called Serial, available in the app store. Full disclosure- I wrote it. The main advantage over other apps is it can work with most USB to serial devices without having to install any drivers, as it has its own drivers built-in. It also does full terminal emulation so you can use it to work with Linux or other devices that require it. You can try it for free, too.\nAlso, Apple began including their own driver for FTDI-based devices in Mavericks (10.9). So, if you're on 10.9 or later and your device has an FTDI chip inside, you can use the built-in screen command in the terminal to access your device without worrying about drivers.\n\nA: And then there still is the old ZTerm which is just as old as it's looks suggest yet it gets the job done just fine and it is available for free. Works fine with Prolific (PL 2303) and FTDI based USB serial adapters.\n\nA: My preference is cu. I use it for Arduino or Bus Pirate related fun. It's installed by default and supports parity settings among other options (type man cu for more info).\nsudo cu -s 115200 -l /dev/tty.usbserial-A6005kdh\n\nTo bail out when you're done, type ~. as you would with SSH\n\nA: After trying other approaches (incl. screen) unsuccessfully, I started using goSerial from this list of serial port apps for mac.

It is a Unix clone of the well-known MS-DOS Telix program. It has ANSI color, a dialing directory, dial-a-list, and a scripting language.\n\nHomebrew installation:\nbrew install minicom\n\n\nA: I have had success with cutecom on Ubuntu 16.04\nSupported on OSX: http://cutecom.sourceforge.net/ \n\nA: Another serial terminal for Mac OS X is Cornflake!\nIt features Device Selection with a Refresh Button, Baud Rate & Packet Type & Flow Control Selection, Port Control and a View Filter to view incoming data as ASCII, ASCII+, Integer or HEX.\n\nA: If you prefer not to work in Terminal, you might mant to try CoolTerm (free). Scroll down a bit for description and download. Don’t let the fact it‘s written in RealBasic turn you away... I have used it to connect to plotters, Arduino boards and receipt printers via a Keyspan USB<->Serial Adaptor.\n\nA:  SerialTools on App Store (free). Good for me\n\nA: I use screen to connect to my router's serial port on my Mac.\nAfter installing it- using either macports or homebrew depending on your preference- use the following syntax:\nsudo screen /dev/(serialDevice) (baudRate) (TransmissionRate) (flowControl)\n\nTo connect to my MikroTik RB4011 router my screen command is:\nsudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 cs8 ixoff\n\n\"cs8\" being the bit rate of router and \"ixoff\" specifying \"No Flow Control\". \"115200\" is the baud rate of router.  Alternate settings would be \"cs7\" for 7 instead of 8 bit and \"ixon\" if flow control supported by your serial device.  man screen\nAll the \"HowTo's\" for using screen to make a serial connection on the 'net I've found Googling omit these required parameters, so that's why you'll find screen has not worked if you've tried it just passing only the baud rate.\nBTW, minicom -s (which would also need to be installed via macports or homebrew) also works great, but I prefer screen as I don't have to go through setup menus- I can just pass the serial connection parameters directly to the screen command.\n\nA: You should have a look at ZOC, what I think to be the best terminal emulation program available for the Mac.  I use it everyday for my job.  It has the ability to do direct communication with a serial port.  Of course it does way more than just serial communication.\n\nZOC is a professional SSH/telnet client and terminal emulator. With its impressive list of emulations it lets you easily connect to hosts and mainframes, using communication methods like secure shell, telnet, serial cable or modem/isdn.\nIts sleek user interface has many ways of making your life easier. In its own way, this is the swiss army knife of thin clients: versatile, robust, proven.\nKey features:\n  - Tabbed sessions with thumbnails\n  - Customizable to meet your preferences and needs\n  - Scripting and automation features\n  - Compatible with Windows 7 and OS X Lion\n  - Administrator friendly (deployment, configuration)\n  - Now $79.99 with attractive bulk discounts\n\n\nA: You can use the terminal command screen to do this!!!\nAs seen on ServerFault:\n\nI love using [screen] for connecting to serial consoles, i.e.\nscreen /dev/ttyS0 19200\n\n\nOr, if you prefer Mac OS X hints...\n\nI often have to do router configuration via a console port, so I use a\n  Keyspan Serial Adapter to get access. Two problems then present\n  themselves: ZTerm is a horrible Mac OS X app. It hasn't been updated\n  in five years or so, and isn't a Universal Binary. The developer\n  doesn't seem in any hurry to rectify the situation. It is not worth\n  the shareware fee in its current form. Minicom requires installation\n  of Fink or MacPorts and is overly complex. Solution: Use screen,\n  Terminal, and a little AppleScripting.\nFirst, launch Script Editor and type/paste in the following code:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n  do script with command \"screen /dev/tty.KeySerial1\"\n  set number of rows of window 1 to 100\n  set number of columns of window 1 to 80\n  set background color of window 1 to \"black\"\n  set normal text color of window 1 to \"green\"\n  set custom title of window 1 to \"SerialOut\"\nend tell\n\nCompile and save as an app from within Script Editor, and you have a\n  double-clickable application to launch a serial Terminal session. You\n  may want to customize this slightly -- you can change the screen\n  colors or number of columns or rows. You may also need to customize\n  the screen command with a different device name if you are using\n  something other than the Keyspan Serial Adapter (do an ls tty* of the\n  /dev/ directory to get the right name). \nscreen uses Control-A to take commands directed to it. So type\n  Control-A followed by Control-\\ to exit your screen session. If you\n  fail to do this and exit a Terminal session, you'll leave the screen\n  session alive and the serial resource unavailable until you kill the\n  screen session manually. man screen will show you further commands to\n  send to a screen session. \nIf anyone can reply with a link to a tutorial on how to wrap an\n  interactive Unix App in Cocoa, that would be the next step -- it would\n  be nice to do this without involving Terminal. If you prefer to use\n  Minicom, you could still use the AppleScript to wrap it into a nice\n  launchable app -- use this older hint to find the right command line\n  commands.\n\nMany USB-Serial adapters use the chip from FTDI. Install the \"Virtual COM Port\" driver and look for the proper TTY name in /dev. For example, on a PowerBook G4 it came up as /dev/tty.usbserial-FTALKY8I.\n\nA: C-Kermit is alive and well in Brew, and can be installed with:\nbrew install c-kermit\n\nNaturally you would require Brew to be installed first. You can find information on how to do this here: http://brew.sh\nAlternatively use Macports\nsudo port install kermit\n\nThis would too require you to have Macports installed\n", "Q: Why does Siri not set Geofence reminders on iPhone when used in conjuction with an Exchange account? I have been trying to use Siri to set a Geofence reminder to no avail. Apparently there seems to be some type of conflict with the phones local reminders and syncing (via Active sync) with Exchange servers in general. Siri will setup a standard reminder but review of the created task none of the Geofence options are present. I have read through Apple's forums and other 3rd party forumns. I have found a thread on Apple's forum that can be found here that involves turning off reminders and the Exchange account and enabling them on your iCloud account. Upon testing, this potential work around was unsuccessful for me (Siri still refuses to utilize Geofence options). I am currently syncing to an Exchange 2010 server (mail, contacts, calendars and reminders). Can any one provide or point to:\n\n\n*\n\n*A canonical answer as to why this occurs?\n\n*Are there any potential workarounds that will allow an Exchange account\nand built in Siri Geofence functionality to work in tandem with\neach other?\n\n\nThe information that I have been able to locate to date reflects conflicting views with some parties saying it can be done and others saying it can't be done. I have yet to find a definitive answer on Apples general site.\n\nA: After further research is seems as though Siri creates \"Tasks\" on my Exchange server, which don't allow geofencing. What is needed is an iCloud \"Reminder\", which does allow for Geofence reminders. You need to set up Reminders to use iCloud by default as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your iCloud account is setup online, and enable the same\niCloud account on your iPhone.\n\n*Make sure that the notifications and calendars are syncing with\niCloud on your iPhone.\n\n\n\nNext you will need to navigate to Settings >> Reminders:\n\n\n\nOnce these steps are completed the reminders functionality (with geofencing alerts) should work properly (even with Exchange). You will obviously need to designate Geo points via a contact entry with address information on the iPhone itself for this to work (i.e. Work, Home, etc..). There is a lot of good information on this question along with a trouble shooting process in this Apple forum thread located here. Please note that this process was tested on an iPhone 5 with iOS 6 (build 10A405) on an AT&T cellular network.\n\nA: I assume Geofencing isn't available on Exchange as there is no field for it. Can you keep your reminders on the iCloud account instead of on Exchange?\n", "Q: How can I use an existing Time Machine backup with my new computer? I've just replaced my existing MacBook Pro with a new MacBook Air.  I've got 18 months of Time Machine backups from the old computer.  I'd like to configure my new computer to use the old computer's Time Machine backups, so the new computer picks up where the old one left off.  Is this possible?  If so, how?\nI didn't restore the new computer from a Time Machine backup because my old computer used more disk space than my new computer.  There was a lot of cruft as well, so I decided to start from scratch on the new one.  I'm slowly pulling off individual files and settings from a clone of the old computer's hard drive.\n\nA: I found the following solution here:\nsudo tmutil associatedisk -a \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD\" \"/Volumes/Time Machine Disk/Backups.backupdb/John Doe's MacBook/Latest/Macintosh HD\"\n\n\nA: By now, there seems to be a dedicated tmutil command:\nsudo tmutil inheritbackup <path to previous time machine backups on mounted volume>\n\nExample:\nsudo tmutil inheritbackup /Volumes/Seagate\\ Backup\\ Plus\\ Drive/Backups.backupdb/MacBook\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Make sure the name of the new computer's hard drive is the same as the old computer's hard drive.  Click once on the hard drive and hit enter to rename.\n\n*Make sure the new computer's name is the same as the old computer's name.  Open System Preferences, then Sharing.  Enter the name in the Computer Name field.  (This step may not be necessary, but it's what I did.)\n\n*Plug-in the existing Time Machine drive. Open the Time Machine preferences and turn Time Machine on.  Click Select Disk… and choose the Time Machine drive.  After a few seconds, the backup will start.  It will probably take awhile because OS X recognizes that you're backing up an entirely new disk, so backs up the entire disk.  It might have to delete a few of your oldest backups, depending on how much space is left on the Time Machine drive.\nAfter the first backup, you can safely change the name of the new computer and its hard drive.\nUpdate: Using this technique, you won't be able to browse any backups from your previous computer with the Time Machine interface (although they are removed when Time Machine needs to free up space for new backups).  The old backups are still visible and accessible from the Finder.\n\nA: There is also an extensive guide to troubleshooting Time Machine over on Apple OSX and Time Machine Tips (archive.org link because the original has gone away...) especically the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*B5. Would you like to inherit (or re-use) the backup . . . ?\n\n*B6. \"Reconnecting\" to your backups (for when the easy way fails)\n\n\nA: I restored everything to a new machine and has this problem. I found a new folder on my backup disc indicating that Time Machine had tried to back up the new computer. I deleted it, and when I asked for a backup I was given the option of \"inheriting\" the old backups. When I accepted this option, everything was fine.\n\nA: I am far from having knowledge about this stuff, but it seems to me one of the Apple Support people had me disconnect the power from the Airport Extreme and restart it.\nI just \"cloned\" my lap top pro from old to a new lap top and got grief from Time Machine. I shut everything down, and the next thing I see \"Would you like to inherit from Airport\", so I clicked \"Inherit\".\nWoola, I looked up at the screen and it's working.\n\nA: If you want to back up to the same Time Machine disk that your old computer did, you can do that by plugging the external disk in and selecting it for Time Machine. If you don't restore from that backup, however, Time Machine will house both backups on the same volume, but you won't be able to pull files off of the drive from the other computer through the Time Machine interface. You can get to the other computer's backups by accessing the drive through /Volumes in the Finder.\n\nA: Don't know if back then the Migration Assistant was less customizable...\nI just did something similar and had the impression with the Migration Assistant I had quite some freedom what to take over or not to a new machine. I migrated from a MacBook Pro to a new iMac with the wish to keep both - my MacBook Pro and the new iMac - running in parallel and also with individual backups.\nAs told I used the Migration Assistant and could then deselect all kind of stuff, also applications. Of course I didn't have the issue of lack of storage on the iMac as you with your move to a MacBook Air, but i would assume, you can deselect almost all data and application and keep only very little in the migration in order to keep some settings like the Time Machine without the need to migrate all. \nOnce my migration was done, Time Machine started to do its process and told me, that there is already a Backup and whether I want to inherit the history of that Backup. For someone not wanting to fiddle around with renaming and commands probably the easiest way. \nThe only issue I had then, was that the backup got stuck in the preparing process, but re-moving and adding - and confirming again the question to inherit the history of the existing backup - fixed the issue.\n", "Q: Using an iMac 27 inch (2009) as a monitor for a mac mini with Lion My wife has iMac 27\" (2009) with Snow Leopard and I want to use it as an external monitor for development on Mac mini with the latest Xcode/Lion (I don't want to upgrade the iMac to Lion to get the latest Xcode because I don't want to mess with her computer). Is it a matter of buying a Belkin mini DisplayPort-to-mini-DisplayPort cable and re-using existing keyboard and mouse? Any other issues?\n\nA: You may have already figured this out, but yes. You can buy that cable or the Apple Thunderbolt cable which is backwards compatible with Mini DisplayPort. \nGood luck!\n", "Q: Mac and Windows dual boot problem I have a software problem with my Mac laptop:\nI had made a division in the hard drive some time ago and installed Windows in the other partition using Bootcamp software.\nBut now I think that the Windows partition is getting full and when I try to switch from Mac to Windows, I get a message saying \"inadequate system resources\"\nand the Windows side does not boot up. Can you tell me what to do to fix this issue? \nThank you very much; I'm stuck and have some important documents on my laptop.\n\nA: This is most likely to do with the temporary 'swap' files that Windows uses and needs to run. It would be nice to be able to downsize your OS X partition and upsize your Windows partition, but sadly NTFS is not that convenient. \nClear out any unnecessary files from the Windows partition from the Mac side, accessing it through Finder as falconbridge said. Then try and boot into Windows again.\n\nA: First of all I have to tell you back the crap out of all the files. I had Ubuntu with my Mac OS and because it was 128 GB of solid disk, they both became very full. I tried to get rid of of the Ubuntu by using disk utility and the MAC also got deleted!. \nBack to your problem. You need to look at the hard disk format from the disk utility. I think what you did was you tried to alter the partition and the Windows partition got interrupted. \nAgain, back up everything using Time Machine. \n\nA: I would try to free up some space by removing some files from the Bootcamp partition within OS X. You should be able to access the Bootcamp drive from the Finder. I recommend trying to free at least 1 GB on the Bootcamp drive and then see if you can boot into Windows.\n", "Q: Keyboard Shortcuts/Modifier Keys I am new to Mac (from Linux/Windows background), I find the modifier keys very confusing. I have tried different combinations of modifier key settings but didnt get it to work as expected.\nManaged to get Ctrl+C/P to copy/paste but how do I do Alt+Tab to switch Windows.\nAlso, I like how I can press the Windows button to enter the dashboard/launcher in GNOME 3. How might I do the same in Mac?\n\nA: Generally the keyboard shortcuts you are used to will rely on the command key.\nOne nice thing about a lot of Mac OS X menus is they will list the shortcut next to the command in question, and you can type the name of the command in the help menu when using the application in question, hover or use the arrow keys to select the menu item options that appear, and see the keyboard shortcuts.\nCMD Tab is application switching, CMD C is copy, CMD V is paste, CMD Space is spotlight, swipe up with four fingers is the launcher iirc.\nAlso if you are in the Finder, you can click help and type shortcuts, there are lists upon lists for various tasks.\n", "Q: Discounts for Christmas on Ipod Touch? I am planning to get one iPod Touch from one of my friends who is coming from US this december end. The current price of iPod 32GB is around $299. How much discount can I expect this christmas?\n\nA: I recommend heading on over to AppleInsider.  They keep some really neat matrices of all the major Apple products and their prices at various online retailers.\nFor example, the pricing matrix for the iPod touch shows this for 2 Dec 2011:\n\nThe best price is bolded.  It looks like you can get anywhere between 5 and 10% off an iPod touch, depending on which store you buy it from.  I'll also throw out there that if you have a friend who works for Apple, you might want to talk to him/her to see if they could help you get a discount as well.\n\nA: None unless you find another reseller with a discount.\nAs for Apple discounts, the only typical day of the year that Apple discounts in-store products is on 'Black Friday', the day after Thanksgiving in the US. Black Friday was a week ago from today. I wouldn't expect them to put anything on sale again before Christmas. \nI have also been able to get Apple to price match if another local store has a valid non-Internet sale for the exact item. Do your homework, but if you walk into any store expect to pay the list price from here through Christmas. \nYou can also look on the Apple website for refurbished product or previous generation units which have a full warranty but a sale price. \n", "Q: muting start-up sound on Lion How can I permanently mute the start-up sound on Lion?\nStartupSound.prefPane isn't compatible with Lion. I found Psst, and I guess it's the best option, but it still looks like a hack. Any better ideas?\n\nA: Before I start up my MacBook in the library, I plug in a headset or earbuds (from my phone or iPod).  Hardware mute.  Works with either OS.\n\nA: Maybe not the answer you are looking for, but:\nI keep the volume of my MacBook to zero (so no sound on startup) since I do not want sound without earphones or my stereo connected anyway - Mac OS saves different volume settings for “something plugged in” and “nothing plugged in”.\nAt least, works for me.\n", "Q: How can I recover from a frozen fullscreen application / game? A few times now, Starcraft 2 has frozen up on my wife's Macbook Pro, but the mouse pointer still moves and the sound keeps playing.  I can also SSH in from a different machine.  The keyboard shortcut for force-quit doesn't work though, and nothing in-game is clickable.  Command-tab won't switch windows either.\nIf this were a straight-up Linux box, I'd find the application process and kill it from an SSH login.  If that failed, I might take out the X server.  Can I do anything like this in OSX?  Is there something on the \"problem\" machine I can do locally instead?\n\nA: *\n\n*Search for the Starcraft 2 process in the process list. I don't know the name of the binary but something like ps aux | grep -i starcraft should get you there\n\n*The number in the second column is the PID\n\n*kill PID or (if this doesn't work) kill -9 PID (if you are not the owner of the process, you can use sudo kill ... instead)\n\n\nDepending on the process structure of Starcraft 2 you may need to do this several times to hit the right one.\n", "Q: What do Verify Disk and Repair Disk actually do in Disk Utility? I've recently been suspecting problems with my hard disk and saw another answer here on AskDifferent recommending Drive Genius or Disk Warrior.\nI thought I'd start thought by using the built in Disk Utility app.\nHow good is Disk Utility at possibly identifying hardware issue, and what do \"Verify Disk\" and \"Repair Disk\" actually do?\n\nA: Disk Utility in many respect is powered by fsck, a command line utility that deals with file systems (not just the one found on OS X).\nThe option to verify (and repair) your disk deals with the health of the file system (HFS+) and the integrity of the data that resides on it, rather than the physical disk. It looks at how the data is stored and not if the drive is reporting mechanical errors (to some extent this is reported by the S.M.A.R.T status). However it should stand to reason that a hardware fault will likely permeate through the file system structure (though not always).\nIs Disk Utility good at finding hardware issues? No, not really. It's meant more to isolate problems with your data set than it is your hardware. There of course is some continuity there but they are not monogamous.\nDiskWarrior and Drive Genius will undoubtedly do a much better job diagnosing the physical health of your drive. But none are as powerful as the utilities released by your respective hard drive manufacturer. If you can use those, then all the better. Using multiple tools may also prove to be an affective strategy. \nAnother avenue which can help in discovery is to comb your Console's logs for anomalies. I've had a WD disk exhibit strange behaviors and first became cognizant of the problem by way of a single error during the initial boot up sequence. Google and WD's native Windows diagnostic tools helped me isolate the issue (to some degree).\n", "Q: How can I alter the spotlight category spreadsheets to include ODS In Lion, the \"All My Files\" smart folder in finder is based on spotlight search categories. While I can see how from System Preferences->Spotlight->Search Results I can alter the order of these as well as enabled/disable categories, I cannot see how to alter the file types that go into them.\nI specifically want to add the Libre Office ODS file type into spreadsheets, but a generalised answer I can use for other file types is even better.\nI don't fear cracking out vi and editing system files.\n\nA: Install \"LibreOffice\", latest version. It contains the aforementioned mdiimporter plugin. Confirmed just now, to be working. LibreOffice 3.5.6 on OS X 10.7.5\n\nA: Danny\nSpotlight integration for OSX app created documents rely on the application developer building in support for Spotlight for bespoke file types.\nThe plugins mdimporter (metadata importer) for Spotlight and qlgenerator for QuickLook are included within the application package and registered when the application is first run.\nThose plugins are application bundles in their own right.  So without developer input from the LibreOffice developers, you won't get Spotlight integration.\nSpotlight Developer pages\nUpdate 10/10/2012\nAccording to the LibreOffice bug lists, SpotLight integration for LibreOffice file formats has been around for some time, however there have been some issues. I can confirm that 3.5.6 on Mountain Lion does now appear to work correctly.\n", "Q: How do I assure that all files from a shared HFS+ drives are always writable by all users? I have a shared drive on a Mac and I keep having problems accessing different directories.\nFor example, while logged on the server as root I create a new folder aaa on this drive.\nNow, I discover that a normal user cannot write to this directory.\nIs there a way for me to change the default permissions/ACLs so I prevent this from happening in the future.\nI am looking for a one-time solution, not running chmod or chown each time.\nDetails: \n\n\n*\n\n*it seems that root is not member of staff group because when I do ls -l I see group _unknown listed for files created by root.\n\n*By default the files do get only xr write for the group (drwxr-xr-x), how can I change so the group will have the same rights as the user, by default?\n\n*Can this be changes per mounted volume or directory, or changing this would affect the entire system? Risks?\n\n\nA: Get Info on said drive and checking Ignore Ownership might help you.\n", "Q: FrontRow or App like FrontRow on Lion Is FrontRow available for Mac OS X Lion or is there some third party app which does roughly the same?\nI particular like about FrontRow being able to use it with my Mac Remote and I love to watch trailers / dvds. iTunes integration is not that much of importance to me, but would be a nice to have.\n\nA: You can either try to get Front Row running on Lion, or try Plex.\n\n\n*\n\n*Front Row was discontinued in OS X Lion; that’s probably why you can’t find it. That said, there’s nothing to stop you running it, if you don’t mind a few limitations. Ralph Perdomo has some instructions for Front Row on Lion (http://www.mac-hatter.com/blog/frontrowenablerforlion), although they require you to stay on iTunes 10.3, which doesn’t work with some iOS devices. If you’re really attached to Front Row, this probably works, but I haven’t tried it.\n\n*Plex (http://www.plexapp.com/mac.php) also seems pretty decent; I know a lot of people who use it and are very happy with it. Sort of like Front Row, but it pulls content from lots of other places, including iTunes. This support page suggests that they support the Apple Remote, as you wanted. You might like to check that one out.\n\nA: I highly recommend Plex for this - I use it to play movies and music off my Pro, via gigabit, to an old MBP connected to a 40\" LCD.\nI can confirm it uses the Apple Remote, and works really, really well.\n", "Q: Use finder to connect to IIS ftp server I would like to be able to use Finder to connect via (read-only) FTP to a IIS file server. However, I need to log in using the pattern domain\\username. I've tried all the combinations I can think of to get this to work (domain\\username, domain\\\\username, domain%5cusername) and none of them work. I have no problem connecting with the command line ftp client (though it's quirky), or any graphical clients. Has anyone been able to get this working for themselves?\n\nA: On a Mac I've actually had some trouble with FileZilla as Chris mentioned.\nI personally prefer Cyberduck (http://cyberduck.ch/) which has worked very well for me. Especially in cases where Finder could not handle things like:\nftp://siteaddress|user@logindomain\n\n\nA: The best thing I've found is to use FileZilla. It's a free FTP program.\nDomain\\username is the best way to log in.\nJust make sure to have the right settings when connecting to server.\nIIS's FTP is kinda quriky sometimes, make sure you know what your doing, and try it on a windows client too!\n\nA: Answering my own question: In the end, I don't think it's possible. You have to use a third-party FTP client to pass domain information. That is extremely sad.\n", "Q: Can Keynote on iOS play PowerPoint files with audio? I have a family member who's considering buying an iPad. The biggest needs she has is to see PowerPoint presentations with music/audio.\nShe currently has an iMac with Microsoft Office installed, and thus she can read 99% of the PowerPoint ppt/pptx file. I fear that the iPad might not be able to play any presentation's music.\nHow can this be done on the iPad? If this requires an app to be purchased, that's OK.\n\nA: I have recently just put a presentation together which had music and a video and it played the same as on the computer using Keynote.

Alfred just shows the standard \"Search Google\",\"Search Wikipedia\",\"Search Amazon\" that it shows when it can't find something.  What's wrong and how do I fix it?\n\nA: Your Spotlight index might be corrupted – Alfred uses the same index as Spotlight.\nIf Photo Booth is the only item missing, you can try dragging it out of /Applications (to your desktop, say), then back in. You’ll have to authenticate as an administrator both times; Spotlight should pick up on it after that, and so should Alfred (after a small delay). If that doesn’t help, or other items are not found either, you will have to re-build the Spotlight index, either by following Apple’s official procedure, or via the Terminal command sudo mdutil -E /.\n", "Q: Is there a way to build a simple iPad pen yourself?

I use a MyBook 1Tb FW800 drive from Western Digital as my Time Machine backup, and I also have a FW800 Lexar CompactFlash card reader. My 2011 MacBook Pro only has one FW800 port so I have to daisy-chain the two devices, which both have 2 FW800 ports each.\nHowever it seems to matter in which order I connect the items together. If I connect the drive to the Mac, then the card reader to the drive, the card reader might not show up, or the drive may dismount; I've not really had the time to tabulate all the possible permutations of chain order and port use. Are issues like this common with FW800, and is there some way I can resolve them?\n\nA: Firewire attempts to use \"smart\" daisy chaining, which permits links in the daisy chain to be off. Unfortunately, that doesn't always work effectively. Apple recommends you first plug the device into the Macintosh, wait for it to become visible, and then add devices one at a time. 1\nAs for particular details with regards to your problem, I've had issues with card readers in which they either didn't really truly meet the firewire spec and therefore were unhappy with daisy chaining, or they would attempt to \"smart\" turn-off when a card was not in them, which caused it to also disable other parts of the chain.\nIn short, daisy chaining with Firewire is great, except when it isn't. YMMV.\n", "Q: Set keyboard shortcuts for launching programs \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan I create a shortcut to open a specific application on OS X? \n\nOn all my other machines, I can type CtrlAltW to launch a web browser, CtrlAltE for an email client, etc.  I have looked but haven't been able to find how to set this up on my mac.  Can this be configured on a mac?

Apple state:\n\nOnly Apple retail stores or Apple Authorized Service Providers can unlock these computers protected by a firmware password.\nIf you cannot remember the firmware password for your MacBook Air, schedule a service appointment with either an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider.  If you plan to visit an Apple Retail store please make a reservation at the Genius Bar using http://www.apple.com/retail/geniusbar/ (available in some countries only).\n\nWhat do such engineers do to recover or reset the firmware password?  I long ago forgot my MacBook Air's firmware password, but haven't needed it until now.  I'm quite comfortable opening up my laptop, even if it voids my warranty, but cannot find any information on how the reset is performed.\nWith older models, one needed only to change the hardware configuration (e.g. amount of installed RAM) and then reset PRAM three times to force a reset of the firmware password.  I presume this is not possible because the MacBook Air has no user-removable parts (since RAM is soldered to the motherboard, for example) but it is not clear what alternatives exist.\nApple probably require all those in the know to keep it to themselves, but no doubt some hacker has figured it out. I'd be grateful if they would share!\n\nA: It's not the sort of thing a hacker can easily \"figure out\" -- as I understand it, the procedure involves calling Apple's Service Provider Support, proving you're an authorized service provider, reading them a code from the computer and typing in the countercode they give you...\nMind you, that doesn't mean you're out of luck.  If you have admin access, and a 10.6.x install DVD or USB key for your Mac, this MacEnterprise posting has instructions to use setregproptool to enable/disable the firmware password.  If you have Lion, it's probably on the recovery partition somewhere, but I haven't investigated.\n\nA: An AASP does by no means 'bypass' the Firmware Password, it is simply removed with a tool specific for that exact machine.\nA specific Key combination is used on the Firmware Password screen on the Mac that needs it removed, this presents a unique Hash code on the screen of the Mac.\nGenerally this Hash code needs to be sent to Apple Technical Service Provider Support, they will send the AASP the unique 'file' that is used to remove the password from that specific machine.\nThere is no 'Home' solution yet for the removal of these kind of passwords on updated models, an AASP or a Apple Store can do it for you.\n", "Q: Parallels - Can I have a keyboard shortcut for the context-menu key found on Wintel hardware? On a lot of Windows keyboards there's a key to the right of the spacebar that brings up the context-menu (right-click menu) in applications (I'm running Win7). I can't seem to find a way to map this function to the VM's keyboard in Parallels. Is it even possible?\n\nA: For Bootcamp I'm using AutoHotkey app as a way to remap standard Windows keyboard switch combination to Command ⌘+Space.\nI've just tried to remap right command key of my Apple Aluminum keyboard to become Context menu key and it works with editing AutoHotkey.aht configuration file  and adding \n\nRWin::AppsKey\n\nas a key binding. You may read more on remapping with AutoHotKey here.

Is it possible for an extension to add items to the right click menu in Safari?  If you enable developer mode, there is a menu item called \"Open Page With...\" and Google Chrome is a choice if it's installed.  Can the Open Page With... menu get added to the right click menu, so I can use one less step when viewing a page in Chrome?  Right now I'm required to load the page in safari, then choose the Chrome option, whereas I'd rather just right click on links and send them to Chrome quickly.\nI would make it myself if I knew how!\n\nA: RobMathers answer works well for me.  You can add a bit to it so you don't have to select the URL.\nIn Automator, revise his step 3 to \"Change the \"Service receives selected\" drop-down to \"no input\" \"\nThen, before adding the \"Run AppleScript\" with his code, drag \"Get Current Webpage from Safari\" over from the Internet category in the Automator library.  It will pass the URL to the AppleScript code.  And then you can assign a keyboard shortcut too\nHere is the screenshot:\n\n\nA: Open in Chrome Service\nYou can make a Service in 10.6 or 10.7 using Automator that will open a selected URL in Chrome.\nHere's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator \n\n*When Automator asks you to Choose a type for your document window, select Service \n\n*Change the \"Service receives selected\" drop-down to \"URLs\" \n\n*Add a Run AppleScript action (found under the Automator Library, or just search) by dragging from the left pane to the right\n\n*Copy the code below to the text field (replacing all the existing text)\n\n*Save and give the service a name (it will be added automatically to the services menu)\n\n\nCode:\non run {input}\n    set theURL to input\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\"\n        if not (exists first window) then\n            make new window\n            set URL of last tab of first window to theURL\n        else\n            tell first window\n                set newTab to make new tab with properties {URL:theURL}\n            end tell\n        end if\n        activate\n    end tell\nend run\n\nThis will open any selected URL in Safari or other application in Chrome, either in a new tab in the most recent window, or a new window if there is no open Chrome window. To access it, right-click and under the Services item at the bottom of the menu, you should see an item with the name you assigned.\nOne important caveat: OS X seems to be a bit picky/buggy about passing link to this sort of service. It works fine if you have text selected as a URL, but it only seems to work on some links. If I discover a better method, I'll update this post with it.\nYou may also need to restart Safari for the service to appear. \n\nA: Sorry to bump this old item, but I was looking for a solution and came up with this one that is working great for me.\nWant to open the active webpage in a browser other than Safari on your Mac? \nIt's simple if you have the developer mode enabled. \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings - Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcuts tab\n\n*Click the + to add a shortcut. \n\n*Select Safari on the Application drop-down\n\n*Copy the Menu Title letter for letter from Safari's Develop -> Open Page With menu. \n\"\nExamples: on my machine, Chrome = Google Chrome (22.0.1215.0) — /Applications\", Firefox = \"Firefox (13.0.1)\" \n\n\nNote: you will have to update this when updating any of the browsers. The developer menu ties the menu options to the version number reported by the Finder. \n\n\n*\n\n*Select your own keyboard shortcut for the alternate browser. I use control+option+command+browser first letter, so Google Chrome = G. I used F for Firefox and O for Opera. control+option+command is not the default for any Safari features as far as I know (for any letter)... \n\n*From any Safari page, simply push the keyboard shortcut and the page will open in the desired browser. \nEnjoy!\nE\n\nA: You can open the current tab in Google Chrome with a Keyboard shortcut.\nThis uses macOS keyboard settings to add a shortcut to the Develop - Open Page With - ... setting, but there are caveats: you may need to update this occasionally when Chrome versions change.\n\n*\n\n*In Safari Preferences – Advanced, enable Show Develop menu in menu bar\n\n*Now, try the menu and note down (or take screenshot) of the Google Chrome text in Develop – Open Page With - Google Chrome (version number)\n\n*In System Preferences – Keyboard – Shortcuts, add a shortcut for this option as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Select App Shortcuts on left and Click +\n\n*Select Application – Safari.

There is an app that can do screenshots in MacOSX Lion, what's the name? \nIt comes from the OS, not a 3rd party app.\n\nA: You can also take screenshots with Preview via File -> Take Screen Shot. This gives you the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*From Selection...\n\n*From Window...\n\n*From Entire Screen\n\n\nEach screenshot is captured in a separate Preview window so it is mostly useful to collect screenshots and process them afterwards.\n\nA: The built-in application is called Grab. You can find it under the Utilities folder in Applications.\nYou can also use keyboard shortcuts to take screen shots. Here's a quick guide from Apple:\n\nIn Mac OS X, you can use simple keyboard shortcuts to do all sorts of things, including capturing images of what’s on your Mac screen. For example, you can take a screen shot of your entire screen by holding down the Command and Shift keys and pressing a 3.\nIf you hold down the Command and Shift keys and press 4, Mac OS X turns the cursor into crosshairs you can use to select whatever portion of your display you’d like to capture in a screen shot.\nIf you immediately hit the Spacebar after typing Command-Shift-4, Mac OS X replaces those crosshairs with a little camera. Using the camera, you can take a screen shot of the Dock, the entire menu bar, a single open menu, the desktop, or any open window.\n\n\nA: I generally use the built-in screen grab utility. If you hold down the Control key in addition to the other keys (i.e. Command-Shift-4), the captured image will be sent to the clipboard rather than being saved as a file. I find this useful when I'm pasting the screen grab directly into a document.\nApple's documentation of this feature is available from the Help Menu. Search for Shortcuts for taking pictures of the screen\nThere are a number of third-party applications that offer various enhancements to the screen grabbing experience. For example if you plan to do a lot of post-production manipulation, Layers will save every element on the screen as a separate layer of a .psd document.\n", "Q: iTunes asks to transfer purchased apps from iPhone even though app sync is off A few weeks after iOS 5 came out, I disabled app syncing with my phone.

Then, assign the desired shortcut, such as back or forwards.\n\nA: If there is no such preferences in Razer preferences then you may try USB Overdrive to assign the button to an action.\n\nA: In the application Razer Synapse, you can assign ⌘-[ as the back button and ⌘-] as the forward button to your Razer mouse buttons 4 and 5.\nTo do this, open the application and click the mouse button you want to change the assignment for. A window will pop-up where you need to open the drop-down menu and select \"keyboard function\", then enter the respective keyboard combination.\n\nA: 1) install USBOverdrive\n2) restart PC\n3) open USBOverdrive, pick the button needed and choose in select menu item \"Press Key\"\n4) assign Command+[ (back) and Command+] (forward) for buttons\n5) enjoy \n\n\nA: You can remap mouse buttons 4/5 to mac's forward and backward keys using Karabiner.\n\n\nA: I made an open-source macOS utility called SensibleSideButtons that turns the side buttons on any generic mouse into universal navigation buttons.\nThe application runs in your menu bar so you don't have to install any extra drivers. My approach is to bind the buttons to virtual left and right three-finger swipe gestures, which offers several benefits over the usual approach of binding the buttons to ⌘ + [ and ⌘ + ]: almost universal adoption across the OS (including Xcode), avoidance of destructive behavior, no menu bar blink or annoying noises, and commands only sent to the specific window under your cursor.\nThe only requirement is that your side buttons emit standard M4 and M5 events, which most mice do.\nUPDATE\nThis does not work anymore on Apple Silicon. Use SaneSideButtons.\n\nA: It is different for the Chroma with the new synapse 2.0, you go into customize -> select button 4 or 5 whichever you are working with and select keyboard function, press and hold \"alt\" + \"right\" or \"left\" arrow key and it should remap to forward or back respectively. No need to download other software to override your already installed and fully functional software. Your Welcome.\n\nA: I just did this under the Razor synopsis 2.0 wizard. You can select the mouse buttons on the side. I had to time hitting the ⌘ + [ to get it to accept it, but once done it works like a charm.\n\nA: All you have to do is go into the button map, go to shortcuts and select back (or forwards if you want to map that to)\n\nA: I've been able to 'bypass' the razer option by assigning a keyboard function \"backscpace\" since backspace is the 'previous' function on most browsers.\nHope this helps\n\nA: Once you have downloaded USBOverdrive. \nAssigning Back and Forward to buttons 4 and 5\nFirst select the physical button you want to configure by pressing it on the device or choosing it in the left side list. Then look at the menus at the right and choose \"Keyboard Shortcut\" + \"Back\" (or \"Forward\").\n\nA: Get the BetterTouchTool then you can set up Mouse buttons to gestures and the likes.\n", "Q: Building mPlayer from Source - Error Trying to build mplayer from source for applying patches. \n./configure works fine, but it leads me to this error\n    Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:\n  \"_fribidi_reorder_line\", referenced from:\n      _ass_shaper_reorder in ass_shaper.o\n  \"_fribidi_get_bidi_types\", referenced from:\n      _ass_shaper_shape in ass_shaper.o\n  \"_fribidi_get_par_embedding_levels\", referenced from:\n      _ass_shaper_shape in ass_shaper.o\n  \"_fribidi_get_joining_types\", referenced from:\n      _ass_shaper_shape in ass_shaper.o\n  \"_fribidi_join_arabic\", referenced from:\n      _ass_shaper_shape in ass_shaper.o\n  \"_fribidi_shape\", referenced from:\n      _ass_shaper_shape in ass_shaper.o\nld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\nmake: *** [mplayer] Error 1\n\nI can't figure out what to do now?\nI'm using OS X 10.7.\n\nA: What about using Homebrew?\nOnce installed it should be as easy as writing in the terminal\nbrew install mplayer\n\n\nA: Is it necessary for you to compile from source?

Sometimes I need to download very big files from the internet using torrents (I'm using Transmission) and the Wi-Fi always drops. I bought several routers and modems and none of them work. I've been having this issue a for a while (~10 years, with both Windows and Mac).\nNow I decided to learn a bit, and write some AppleScript which reconnects automatically:\nrepeat\nif (do shell script \"curl --connect-timeout 1 <WIFI_IP>\") = \"curl: (7) couldn't connect to host\" then\n    do shell script \"networksetup -setairportpower AirPort off\"\n    do shell script \"networksetup -setairportpower AirPort on\"\n    do shell script \"networksetup -setairportnetwork en1 <ROUTER_NAME> <ROUTER_PASS>\"\nend if\nend repeat\n\nthe part after then works, it disconnects from Wi-Fi and reconnects it, but the problem is with the if part, because I don't know how to detect when the Wi-Fi connection is broken by the torrent. How should I do this?\nAlso, a repeat with an interval would be really nice, something like: repeat every 10 seconds.\n\nA: Here's a simple Appplescript handler I wrote a while back to solve this exact problem. It pings the OpenDNS server (both of them for redundancy) to check if the internet connection is up. It returns true on success, false on failure. Just copy it into your script, and call it like:\nset connected to checkInternetConnection\n\nThen you can put whatever you want to do in an if statement like:\nif connected then\n    -- Do stuff here\nend if\n\nThe handler:\non checkInternetConnection()\n    -- Ping the primary OpenDNS server.\n    try\n        set pingResult1 to do shell script \"ping -c 1 208.67.222.222\"\n    on error\n        set pingResult1 to \"\"\n    end try\n\n    -- Check the results returned and return true or false.\n    set p to number of paragraphs in pingResult1\n    if p < 5 then\n        -- Ping another Open DNS server for redundancy.\n        try\n            set pingResult2 to do shell script \"ping -c 1 208.67.220.2220\"\n        on error\n            set pingResult2 to \"\"\n        end try\n\n        set p to number of paragraphs in pingResult2\n        if p < 5 then return false\n    else\n        return true\n    end if\nend checkInternetConnection\n\n\nA: At home, I maintain a perl script called ping-random-server. Whenever I suspect a networking problem, I run it. ping is an option for you as well.

What happens when you plug in your iPhone to the computer? What's the message of iTunes? As far as you can find the iPhone from your iTunes, you can always do the backup by right-click on your iPhone icon in iTunes and select \"Backup\" to force it to back up. \nHowever there is one thing you should know: based on my experience when upgrading the iOS 5, even I did the force backup as above, after restoring it still not the same as the point when I did the backup. I am not sure whether it really \"backups\", but at least this is an option.\n\nA: It is not clear from your question, but if your iTunes library does not contain your iPhone's music already, you can try and use DeTune a small third-party program which will load your iPhone's music to your Mac iTunes.\nNext, you can proceed to restore the restore process will automatically backup your iPhone's emails, calendars, Camera Roll photos and contacts. When prompted, select restore from a previous backup and select the most recent backup you just made. \nThe restore process will indeed delete your iPhone music; however, if you already have it loaded in your iTunes library, you can quickly restore that too with a sync.\n", "Q: Which virtualization programs support hardware breakpoints? I am using my 2010 i7 MacBook Pro to debug some Linux programs; but I already have a Windows partition and it would be inconvenient to create another partition for Linux, so I am using a virtual machine with VMware Fusion 3.\nHowever, it appears that I cannot set hardware breakpoints with the hbreak command from GDB inside the virtual machine, and there are times where I would rather have them. However, it does work from the host operating system, so I assume that this is a limitation of Fusion 3.\nWhich virtualization programs will support hardware breakpoints? Commercial products (including VMware Fusion 4) are not out of question.\n\nA: Actually, VMware Fusion does support hardware-assisted breakpoints. However, gdb has trouble creating them while the program is not running (which was my issue; you can issue break commands even when the program is off, but you need it to be running for hbreak to work, or something along these lines).\n", "Q: How to convert Aperture license to app store license? \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan I update apps that I've already purchased through the Mac App Store? \n\nLong ago I bought the retail box version of Aperture and have been steadily upgrading until the current version.

I'd like to download Aperture this way, but don't want to buy it again. \nQuestion: Is there any means to convert my current license to an App store license? I was hoping that when the App Store was first deployed, it would recognize my apple software and pull it into the App store model, but it did not.  (Aperture and iWork updates happen outside the app store because I didn't buy them there). \nHope that all makes sense.\nThanks!\n\nA: From an accepted answer by Kyle Cronin from another Ask Different question, with added emphasis:\n\nFrom Daring\n  Fireball:\n\n[…] for apps that use the  same bundle ID for the both the Mac  App\n    Store and non-App Store versions,  the Mac App Store will not install \n    updates to already-installed non-App  Store versions, but it will\n    recognize  them as being already installed.

That way, I have a better shot of my data surviving a disaster. Right noow I have to manually change the TM volume based on where I am.\nI'd like to use some location aware software (like Marco Polo) and have it just switch the volume. I tried using Applescript and Automator to make the switch but I haven't been able to be consistently successful. \nI'm looking for a more terminal/shellscript based way to switch the TM volume.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Time Machine supports multiple backup volumes on Mountain Lion.\n\nBackup to multiple locations\nTime Machine allows you to choose multiple backup locations and seamlessly switch between them. Now you can have a backup of your data at work and at home.\n\n\nA: What I'd do is the following. You need to create a copy of /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist. Put it somewhere (example: ~/somewhere/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist.diskA). Then change from System Preferences the disk to which you want to back up. Create another copy and put it to ~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.diskB). Then do something like this\nln -s ~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.disk ~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.diskB\nsudo rm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist\nsudo ln -s ~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.disk /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist\n\nThen the script when using disk A would be\nrm ~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.disk \nln -s ~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.diskA ~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.disk \n\nand when using disk B would be\n    rm ~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.disk \n    ln -s ~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.diskB\n~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.disk \nThis way you don't have to use sudo with MarcoPolo (BTW you should really use ControlPlane which picks up where MarcoPolo left).\nEDIT: REMEMBER to have your original file back'd up when you do this.\n", "Q: How can I stop Spaces from taking me to an app's Space when I open a new file?

Power it down, then hold the T button when you turn it back on until a FireWire logo appears on screen. You can mount it as a drive on another Mac, and restore the files you altered from your backup.\nIf you don't have a backup, you could at least use Target Disk Mode to make a backup of your data so you won't lose it when you restore the PowerBook from its restore CD/DVD.\n", "Q: What is the difference between Top Grossing and Top Paid in the App Store?

A $50 app is likely to have fewer downloads than at $0.99 app. The Top Paid list will likely include many inexpensive apps that get purchased often.

Does iOS 5.0+ destroy data securely once deleted? Specifically if I delete a text message  or an email from an iDevice, is said data destroyed to a point that data recovery would be unrealistic in practical terms? I understand that I can perform a full reset and doing so  will erase data and restore the phone to a factory state but that is not my intention. My question is in relation to a device being used on a daily basis. This is a question of curiosity for the most part as I have been asked this by clients and I have not been able to point to a clear answer as of yet. I saw reference to this question but again it references a full restore and wipe of an iDevice with an APP and not daily use with no APP.\n\nA: No, you need to wipe the entire device using the settings found under Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Contents and Settings. Simply deleting items from iOS applications does not provide any kind of secure deletion, and those files can easily be recovered (although that will be harder and harder as those blocks get overwritten in time).\n\nThis provides a one-pass secure delete call that can be liked to OS X's \"Secure Empty Trash.\" While most 3rd party software won't be able to recover your data, government units have far more sophisticated tools that can retrieve data from far worse cases (even physically damaged storage).\nThis feature was introduced in iOS 2.0 and you can read more about it over at AppleInsider.\n", "Q: RAM intermittently not recognized My MBP will sometimes drop 4 of the 8G of RAM I have after recovering from sleep or a reboot.  One (or more) restarts later I'll have all 8G again.  Is this a memory stick going bad?  Could it be something worse?\n\nA: Yes it could easily easily be a bad connection on the ram chip or just bad connection of the RAM stick with connector on the motherboard. Try to clean RAM connectors with a gum eraser first.\nTo test memory under load you may also use Memtest86+ CD if your MBP is Core 2 Duo one or Apple Hardware Test from included CD if yours is \"Core i\" one.\n", "Q: Using an external boot drive and the app store I'm trying to setup my MacBook Pro so that I have an internal drive with one OS X installation (Lion) as well as an external installation that boots via an esata card.

I'm trying to keep things completely separated, any way to do this?\n\nA: Boot from the external drive and then eject the internal drive (use Disk Utility or right-click and eject the drive via Finder).\nThe Mac App Store will no longer see the internal drive when evaluating what apps have been purchased and are installed on the external drive.\n\nA: As long as you are signed in with the same Apple ID, can't you just copy the application from the internal HD to the external.

I have a photo set as my current iPhone wallpaper, which I would like to save.  I have forgotten where I stored this file on my computer originally, so I can't easily go back to place it back on my phone. It has since been deleted from my camera roll.\nIs there any way to export the photo that is currently set as the wallpaper, so that I can change the wallpaper to something else, but save the other one?\n\nA: This is the best solution for non jailbroken phones with wallpaper on the lockscreen so far.\nPut your phone to charge so it will take almost all the UI down for a sec and print the screen. This will get you the image with the battery UI only, then you print another picture from the lock screen after you scrolled everything up or down. compose on photoshop.\nExample:\n\n\n\nA: You cannot export the wallpaper, depending on the pattern (if it were repetitive) it would be possible to take screen shots and after emailing these to your self you could edit in Photoshop (other editing software is available) \nYou would need to take one shot of a page in iOS with only one app, and then if it is a repeatable patern you can edit out or clone out the app on the screen and the apps at the bottom.\nAlternatively you can or tap and hold an app to get to wiggle mode, and go to the far right to get a \"clean\" page, then screenshot this.\nNot great but that is the only way, I'm afraid.\n\nA: You may find the photo in the iPhone backup on your computer.\nOn a Mac press Alt and select Go to in the menu bar. There open Library.\nAssure that you are in column view in the new window.\nGot to UserName/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup.\nThere you will find strangely named folders with all the backed up files. Go through the one, that seems to be one that is the latest backup for your iPhone. You may want to check on which date you have created the latest backup for your iPhone in iTunes first. Some of the backed up files will have the same date.\nIn the right column you will see a preview of any selected file. Many files will be blank though.\nCopy the right one to another location on your computer and add .tiff or .jpg to the file name. Open in Preview other any appropriate program.\nWith that procedure I was able to recover the background that I had carried over from my first iPhone. I had to go through a lot of files though. The desired one was about number 800 of 4.500 files.\n\nA: If your device is jailbroken, you can access the current wallpaper which is stored in:\n/var/mobile/Library/SpringBoard/LockBackground.cpbitmap\n\n\nA: Try this: http://www.tineye.com/\nI had the same problem, so I took a screenshot, uploaded it on that website and it found my image!\n\nA: One way that may require the help of an octopus is to go to Wallpaper settings click on wallpaper preview that is not the lock screen and pinch the image so it shrinks in the screen - this will get the \"Cancel/Set\" buttons out of the image.  If you let go of the pinch, it'll bounce back, so the trick is to pinch and screen grab at the same time.  Then you can crop out the wallpaper setting details in newly captured image in Photos. I was able to do this with four fingers on two hands (no feet required :)) on an iPhone 4s, not sure how dexterous you need to be on an iPhone 6 or 6 plus.\n\nA: As an expansion to Macjack's answer, here's the process I just followed to retrieve the lock screen wallpaper on my phone.\nLooking in the /Users/<youruser>/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backups folder is effective but very time consuming, especially if you have a lot of files/images in your backup (my phone a 16GB iPhone 5 that is pretty full had nearly 7000 files in there).  However, the majority of them were not photos for me.\nSo I wrote a small script to extract the photos and rename them so they have the proper file extension.  This makes it possible to use the image carousel preview for reviewing the images quickly.\nGet the script here. (right click and 'Save link as' and save into your Downloads folder)\nNow, open Terminal (type 'terminal' into spotlight).  Then copy and paste this into the terminal window:\ncd ~/Library/'Application Support'/MobileSync/Backups ~/iPhone-Backup-Copy\nBACKUP=$(ls -t . | head -n1)\ncp -rv \"$BACKUP\" ~/iPhone-Backup-Copy\ncd ~/iPhone-Backup-Copy\nchmod +x ~/Downloads/img-separator.sh\n~/Downloads/img-separator.sh \"$BACKUP\"\n\nWhat those six lines do, for non-programmers:\n\n*\n\n*\"moves\" you into the Backup directory\n\n*Gets the name of the newest backup\n\n*Copies the newest backup directory into a place with looser permissions\n\n*\"moves\" you into that new backup copy\n\n*Makes the script I wrote above \"executable\" (able to be run)\n\n*Runs my script, telling it the name of the backup to process\n\nAnd here is a description of what the script does.\n\nA: If your home screen wallpaper happens to be the same as your lock screen wallpaper then it is possible to extract the image with a screen grab.\nWith iOS 7 installed on my iPhone 5 and while viewing my lock screen I plugged a power cable into my phone.  For a split second all the text overlays disappeared from my lock screen then a battery power status icon appeared.  If you are quick you can take a screen grab of the clean wallpaper.  \nI had spent a couple hours trying to figure out how to recover my lock screen image since the pic had been deleted from my camera roll long ago.  Just as I was giving up and was laying down to bed, I plugged my phone into it's charging cable.  That's when I noticed the clear image.  It was a life saver.  I hope this helps.\nImportant to note\nBefore doing this, go to Settings->Wallpaper and make sure \"Perspective Zoom\" is turned off. Otherwise when setting this newly captured image as a wallpaper it is automatically scaled up so you will lose some information around the edges.\n\nA: Just did on a PC successfully. Do a backup of the iPhone. (don't encrypt it!)\nthe backup goes to:\n%Appdata%\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\79e16f33a9886b760edc45268168255ee431973c (that random string of numbers is different for every backup. look at the folder modified date to find the right one)\n(Press Winkey + R, type in %Appdata% to launch the folder)\nOpen a Command Prompt Window\n(Winkey + R, type in 'CMD')\ntype in:\ncd C:\\Users\\'yourusernamehere'\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\'yourcrazynumberstringhere'\n\ntype in:\nren *.* *.jpg\n\n(this changes all the files extensions to JPG's)\nYou can then sift through them and find the picture. Sorting the folder by file size will help narrow it down.\n\nA: To screen grab purist version of home screen: scroll left to the widgets page/screen.  Edit to have no widgets present.  You will be left with the time and date that you cannot get rid of, as well as the \"edit\" button, and the search bar at the top.  Place phone on flat surface, touch and slide the time/date and edit buttons upward and out of view.  Hold them out of view and the execute the screen grab.  The only thing stuck on the pic is the search bar and the voice command button to the right of the search bar.\n\nA: Easy( if lock screen wallpaper) just go to settings wallpaper the selet the lock screen one and pinch the wallpaper with fingers and bring it in the middle may take a few tries and thats when you screenshot. Crop later.\n\nA: I would Imagine, if you jailbreak, you can find where the file is stored on the iPhone's file-system.\nThis would involve jailbreaking, and then installing a package like Samba. All you would have to do then is mount the iPhone from your desktop, and find the image.\nAlternatively, there are a number of pieces of software that allow you to browse the iPhone filesystem over USB, again assuming the iPhone is jailbroken (DiskAid is an example).\nLast, there are local file managers for the iPhone, that would possible allow you to find the file and copy it directly on the iPhone. \nHowever, I do not think there is really any way to do this without jailbreaking.\n\nA: As you have set a photo as wallpaper the photo should still be listed under photos on your iPhone. You can email that photo yourself.\n\nA: I have the same issue. Best thing I found was to take a screen shot (press the Home and Sleep buttons simultaneously.  The screen will flash white, a camera shutter \"click\" will sound, and the picture will be saved to the\nCamera Roll folder in your Photos).\nNot ideal as you have the date header and footer but at least you get to keep the original shot. \nHope this helps?\n\nA: Tap and hold an app to make all your apps shake (how you delete apps), move all 4 of your apps on the bottom bar (the one that is at the bottom of every app page) to a page with other apps on it so it is blank. Slide over to a completely blank page (you can do this while app delete is activated), then take your screen shot. You will only have a small grey bar across the bottom of your image. If the image you want is on your lock screen instead of your home screen this will not help you.\n\nA: Go to wallpaper preview, turn perspective zoom off, and take a screenshot, then save with perspective zoom off\n…or…\nTurn wiggle mode on, go to a new page and take a screenshot\n…and…\nDouble click, remove all apps from recently used, take another screenshot, then edit the 2 photos together, and if done properly, you'll be able to salvage a new version of the background in it's entirety.\nThis should work for me, hopefully it will work for others, I'm not sure if it will work if the photo was greatly zoomed in initially\n\nA: Always upload your pictures to Google Photos. I found my wallpaper photo from 5 years ago of my daughters by searching on my Google Photos list by my daughter's name. Google photos will index all your photos. Just assign a name to a person in one of your photos, and Google will find all matching photos and assign that name to them. Even group photos will be found under multiple names.\n\nA: I just took screen shot (simultaneously press wake/on and home buttons) of wallpaper photo on old iphone 5.  I will crop out the bottom homepage icons. Before taking screen shot, to get a clear wallpaper photo without icons, I moved all icons off the last page of homepage except one icon which I transferred to bottom icon bar.  When I initially moved all the icons off last homepage, the last page disappeared so I moved last icon to bottom icon bar in order to get clear wallpaper photo for screen shot.\n\nA: Just take a screenshot of all the default screenshot choices in settings where you change wallpapers.  Then take the saved image and zoom up on the one you like and crop it.  It's indistinguishable from the full-size image.\n\nA: *\n\n*Backup your device (e.g. use iMazing, iTunes or idevicebackup2).\n\n*Browse the backup and go to folder HomeDomain/Library/SpringBoard/. There you should find HomeBackground.cpbitmap, OriginalHomeBackground.cpbitmap, LockBackground.cpbitmap and OriginalLockBackground.cpbitmap.\n\n*Use https://cpbitmap.github.io/ to convert the cpbitmap files to PNG.\n\n", "Q: How do I unlock my iTunes account when my old e-mail is unavailable? When I originally set up my iTunes account, I used an email address from my prior employer.  I later moved my account to a personal rather than corporate email address and I have since changed jobs.  The original email address associated with my Apple account is no longer valid.  In the meantime, my computer on which my original iTunes account died.   Fortunately, I had my iTunes music backed up and when I purchased a new computer, I uploaded my songs.  I recently tried to play an Album and an error message came up that said that this computer was not authorized to play the songs and that I would need to access my account to authorize the new computer.  When I clicked through the authorization screen, my original email address came up and asked for my password.  I tried several of my “usual” passwords, but none of them worked.  I clicked on the “forgot my password” link and Apple gave me the option of answering a few security questions or having my password sent to my email address.  Recognizing that I could not access the dead email account, I asked to answer the security questions.  The first one that came up was to enter my birthdate.  I did so and Apple said that my answer was incorrect.  I next tried the street I grew up on and that did not work either.   I soon figured out that none of the questions matched my personal information so I am wondering if these questions were ever associated with my original iTunes account. Apple then locked my account for incorrectly answering the questions.\nWhen I called Apple to see if we could do something to unlock the account and tie it to my new account (which would have the same name, address, and other personal information), I was informed that Apple cannot unlock the account and that I had to have access to the old email account to access the account and authorize this new computer to play the music.  After going up three levels of Apple customer service, I was told that there was absolutely nothing they could do for me.  So, I have purchased hundreds of songs that I cannot play now.\nIs there a work around to this problem?  The songs are stored on my computer – I just can’t play them.\n\nA: Some social engineering solutions :\n\n\n*\n\n*Your iTunes account was presumably associated with your credit card, yes?  You could attempt to prove you identity to Apple via that credit card connection.  You could warn them that you plan on contesting credit card charges if they cannot restore the account. \n\n*If Apple won't help, then collect your old credit card bills with iTunes charges, and speak with your credit card company about contesting those charges.  You're beyond the 60 day period, but maybe not the 1 year \"claims and defenses\" period.  I doubt you'll get your money back, but you have a legitimate dispute with Apple, so stick them the dispute resolution merchant fees, which might cost as much as $30 per song.  Do not lie to your credit card company, simply push the dispute process as far as possible, the further it goes the more money they charge Apple. \n\n*You could theoretically sue Apple in small claims court.  Imho, this sounds like way way too much hassle for a few hundred bucks.  But maybe you could get your account back by contacting Apple's legal department in writing. \nTwo technical solutions :\n\n\n*\n\n*You say you still have the files themselves, yes?  There are a variety of tools for removing iTunes DRM.  A priori, I'd imagine most/all require authorization since that's the easiest way, but perhaps some clever one does not.  Try any that look promising.\n\n*Do you have an iPod?  If so, try Graeme Hutchison suggestion.  If it only give you encrypted music, then theoretically the iPod knows the authorization keys, meaning you've a slim chance someone discovered a trick for using the iPod's authorization to decrypt your music.  Google isn't finding anything for me though.\nAs an aside, you should never buy DRM protected content in the first palce because : (a) Eventually you'll lose access one way or another, often by the company discontinuing the service. (b) Your supporting the DRM technologies which create these problems.  Any books, movies, or music distributed with DRM are also available without DRM if you look.\n\nA: Try contacting the IT department of that prior employer to see if they will accept and forward a few Apple emails to you for one day.\n\nA: I have a possible work around.\nThe songs that you are missing, are they stored on an iPod?\nIf so use software such as Senuti which you can use for free to transfer 1000 files from your iPod into iTunes.\nIf you need more it is a small worth while fee.\nI am not sure it will transfer songs already in iTunes so you may need to setup another user profile and use the iTunes on that profile before moving those tracks into a shared location on your HD.\n\nAdditional answer.\nUse file conversion software to convert them into a WAV and reimport into iTunes after deleting the originals. You can just google file conversion software, there are a lot of free examples.\n\nA: If you have triggered the account to be into a locked status due to too many failed log in attempts, you will need the help of a human to get it unlocked when you no longer can receive email or answer both the birth day question and the security question to a machine's satisfaction.\n(yes, I'm sure you know your birthday, but it could have been entered incorrectly or become corrupted along the way)\nDo try calling support one last time with some billing history and ask if you can provide a list of Apps and/or songs you purchased or have them ask you some of the history. If the person on the phone can't help, just ask them if there is a postal mail address or person you can appeal for help in resetting the email address used for your Apple ID. You can then follow up with a photocopy of some ID and ask how to proceed. It's a shame that you have lost all 3 of the normal methods to make a change to your account, but I'm sure there is someone that can advise you how you can convince someone that you are who you say you are and get access to your password again.\nOnce you have a valid password and the account is unlocked, you can go to http://iforgot.apple.com and change the Apple ID to match an email you now have access. You may also then be able to select the correct birthdate and a new security answer to get all your redundancies working for you instead of against you. Best of luck!\n\nA: I am afraid you are out of luck and there is no help for this. I tried to help a tech support client with this same problem and there is nothing to be done about it. It is truly too late.\nPeople, if you have ever bought anything from any merchant (not just iTunes) and registered your account with the merchant using an email address from your employer, and that email account is still active, do this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Get a free email account from Google Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, or another free email service.\n\n*Log in to each account with a merchant and change your account's email address from your work email address to your new extra email address from Google, Yahoo, etc.\n\n*Only ever buy anything on an account that has your free extra email address as the registered email address.\nPaul Jackson, I'm sorry you've had to learn a hard and expensive lesson.\n\nA: As an added note: NONE of the security questions asked will EVER BE CORRECT! This is the issue that is the REAL issue. The option for a dead email address, according to Apple, is using these security questions, BUT not one of them is accepted, not for me and not for a LOT of others--there's something wrong or a bug on the site's part that NO ONE will have the correct answers to the security questions. There can't possibly be that many people \"accidentally\" typing in their own information incorrectly for the number of people having this problem. SO, when talking to Apple, THIS ISSUE should be fixed, and the email problem would be secondary, and maybe even moot. Anyway, my two cents. I wanted for you to know you did not incorrectly input your basic information, they just have a bug for properly verifying the information. Thanks for reading.\n", "Q: Notifications sounds not affected by iPad 2 volume When turn down the volume on my iPad 2 all the way down, It still makes a sound when notifications are received.\nIs there any way to globally disable notifications sounds ?\n\nA: In Settings | General | Sounds, you can either set the sound level of the alerts, or choose that it will be affected by the Volume buttons (which is off by default).\nUpdate\nIn iOS 10 (and maybe earlier versions, I'm not sure when the change happened) this setting is under Settings | Sounds and is called Change with Buttons in the Ringer and Alerts section.\n", "Q: Name does not appear in top right corner in iCloud and incorrect time zone is set The times in my iCloud calendar are all wrong.\nThe answer I found to fix this is to click on my name in top right hand corner — only problem is that my name does not appear there and I can find nowhere to access settings for the time zone.\niCould currently shows \"Pacific time zone\" and I need it to be set to \"Australian Eastern Summer time\".\n\nA: I suspect you missed a step on the answer you were looking at - you should be doing this on the iCloud site, not in iCal.\nGoto iCloud.com, log in, then you should see your name in the top right corner:\n\nClick there, and you should get an account preferences pop-up where you can set your time zone info:\n\n\nA: You can log into iCloud.com and go to the iCloud start page by clicking on the cloud icon in the top left corner of your screen. iCloud will remember the last web page you visited and it won't bring you to the start page on startup. \nOnce you are in the start page, you can click on your account name in the top right corner of the screen.

I would like a solution to remotely manage my PC from my iPhone, I could even use an RDP client? (I'm running a number of OSes Windows XP and Windows 7 and Hackintosh 10.5.6 but I'm interested in remotely managing the Windows XP box first!) \n\nA: Check out Mocha VNC. The lite version is free.\n\nA: LogMeIn has an iPhone app, though it's not free.  I haven't tried it, but I'm a fan of LogMeIn (free) in general.  Secure connections to multiple computers from any browser, sorts out firewall and port problems itself, handles dynamic IP addresses, multiple users can have different permissions -- all in the free version.\n(As always, be wary when using public PCs.)\nUpdate: There is now a free version of the LogMeIn iPhone/iPad app.\n\nA: Jugaari has Jaadu VNC and Jaadu RDP clients for the iPhone.

I'm having some problems connecting to a Time Capsule's shared drive from a Macbook Air running OS X 10.7.2 Lion.  I can connect to the share without problem from a Macbook Pro running OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.  I do not have any other fileservers to attempt connecting against for comparison.\nDisabling both the Macbook Air's inbound firewall and its outbound application firewall, Little Snitch, yields no improvement (no other firewall, such as ipfw, is in use).  However, it is possible that some other (perhaps overly paranoid) security configuration is interfering with AFP.\nThe Time Capsule appears in Finder's sidebar, but reads \"Connection Failed\" when selected.  Clicking \"Connect As...\" immediately brings up the following message:\n\nThere was a problem connecting to the server \"Time-Capsule\".\nCheck the server name or IP address, and then try again.  If you continue to have problems, contact your system administrator.\n\nNeither Little Snitch's network monitor nor tcpdump show any network activity during the above interactions.\nThe same message appears (again, without network activity) after specifying \"afp://1.2.3.4/share\" (where 1.2.3.4 is the correct IP address of the Time Capsule and \"share\" is the correct name of the AFP share) in Finder's \"Connect to Server...\" dialog.\nIn syslog, the following entries appear:\n\nDec  5 22:41:17 MacbookAir Finder[123]: SharePointBrowser::handleOpenCallBack returned 22\n\nFrom the command line:\n$ mount_afp afp://username:password@1.2.3.4/share /Volumes/mount_point\nmount_afp: AFPMountURL returned error 22, errno is 22\n\nI suspect that this is the error which resulted in the syslog entries from Finder, but I am unable to debug further.\nI would welcome your thoughts and suggestions on how I might proceed!\n\nA: It turns out that, as I suspected, a paranoid security configuration was preventing AFP from working.\nIn particular, the machine had been \"hardened\" per Apple's security configuration guide in which chapter 9 describes how to disable AFP by unloading the com.apple.afpfs_afpLoad dæmon (I had thought it was only required to serve files, not also to connect to an AFP server as a client).  Reenabling the dæmon resolved the issue.\nI am nevertheless curious what tools are recommended for tracing file sharing problems in the future.\n", "Q: iPhone: Wrong alert noise I've got my iPhone set to use the Telegraph alert noise:\n\nBut whenever I get an alert from Twitter, I always hear three noises: Tri-tone, then Telegraph, then Tri-tone.\nThe triplicate of alerts is slightly bothering, but not overly. I think they're due to both the Mail and the GMail apps announcing I have mail.  I'm not sure which is which, but I hear Tri-tone and Telegraph when I get mail.\nI'm just sick of Tri-tone, and would rather not use it at all.\nIs there any way I can change the Twitter alert and the GMail(or Mail) alert to use Telegraph rather than Tri-tone?\n\nA: The built-in Mail app should use the Telegraph tone that you've set for New Mail. \nThe Twitter client and the GMail app have their own alert tones, and if those apps don't let you change the sound I'm afraid the OS can't either.\n", "Q: Print e-mail conversation in Mail.app Does anybody know how (if possible) to print a whole conversation thread in Mail.app?\n\nA: I have a work around for you that works and is a bit quicker than copying to pages. \nWhat you do is:\n1.

At home I'm a Windows/Ubuntu person, and I feel like I've figured out how to diagnose any performance issues I get on those platforms, but in the OSX world I feel totally inexperienced.\nThanks for any tips.\n\nA: When the wired and active RAM pass 50% - most tasks are measurably slower. You will see increased paging activity (vm_stat 15 in the terminal - watch for page outs - they indicate some memory had to be written to slow hard drive and constant page out and page in above 10-20 per minute indicates you have a RAM starved system.)\nWhen starved for RAM, you can buy more or do less. You might want to get a monitoring software like Activity Monitor and keep the memory indicator in your dock. The system is likely thrashing based on the time delays you report. Each of the active programs needs some memory that just got paged to disk to free up extra space for memory needed by another program.

Make sure you have a full backup first, of course.\n\n\n*\n\n*Close all apps. Open Disk Utility, and click 'Macintosh HD' (or whatever your OS X hard drive is named) on the left hand side. Then click verify disk. Let it do its thing, and if it comes back with green text saying that the disk is fine, groovy. If not, locate your original Mac OS X disc that came with your machine. Insert the disc, turn your computer off. Press the power button again, then immediately hold the 'c' key down. This will boot your computer from the CD. When it has loaded, select the language, and then click (on the top menu bar) Utilities -> Disk Utility. Within this, select your OS X hard disk, and click 'Repair disk.' This may take some time to complete. When it has finished repairing, restart your computer into OS X. \n\n*Then go back into Disk Utility, select your disk, and click 'Repair Disk Permissions.' Again this may take some time. \n\n*If you don't already have it, get Onyx (here). Open it up, and click the 'cleaning' tab. Select and execute whatever caches or histories you wish to clear. They are all safe to clear, causing no change to your laptop, just apps may require a few seconds longer to start immediately after the clean. \n\n*Make sure that your hard disk is not full of junk that you do not need, and is not too full. Empty the trash. \nYou should hopefully notice an increase in battery life as well after these processes. \nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Color profile for projector messed up after Lion upgrade Yesterday I finally decided to upgrade to Lion from Snow Leopard on my 27\" iMac (mid-2010 quad i7 model) and overall everything went fine, there is just one thing that bugs me.\nPrior to the upgrade Snow Leopard had automagically chosen a color profile for my projector (Optoma HD100X) which I have connected to the Mini-DP port via a Mini-DP-to-HDMI adapter. This color profile worked great with the projector.\nAfter the upgrade the projector is using a different color profile which appears to have significantly lower quality output. Cyan and light blue colors look washed out, magenta, red and yellow all trend toward more brownish tones and I can't quite pin it down but it feels like something is just wrong with the contrast and gamma.\nI've tried calibrating the profile and I've tried tweaking the settings on my projector, even tried using other color profiles but somehow something just seems \"off\", like the mac is now forcing output into a smaller color gamut.\nHas anyone heard of similar problems with Lion? Has anyone managed to fix problems like this?\n\nA: Yes, I'm having exactly the same problem. Check System Preferences > Displays > Color, and see if you have more than one identically-named profile. A possible workaround for this problem is to select another profile and then the original one.\n", "Q: Installing 64-bit java on Mac OS X Lion? When playing Minecraft 1.0, a java-based game, when I switch the rendering options to \"Far\", the game shows a message saying that memory usage for the game might be too high in Far rendering mode, and that I'm running 32-bit java and should install 64-bit java for the Far mode to work properly.\nI can't recall ever actually installing java on this Mac at all.\nIs there a way for me to install 64-bit java on my Mac?\nThis is an June/July 2011 iMac with Mac OS X Lion, all updates installed.\n\nA: Look for Java Preferences in Utilities. There you'll find order of Java binaries browser will use.\n\nA: Here's a well-written and detailed discussion about Minecraft & Java including Java order, the Minecraft start stub, etc:\n\nMake sure to use the latest Java:\n  Java for OS X Lion Update 1 (Java 1.6.0_29, updated 09. Nov.)\n  Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 6 (Java 1.6.0_29, updated 09. Nov.)\n  Java for Mac OS X 10.5 Update 10 (Java 1.6.0_26 on 64bit Intel, Java 1.5.0_30 last release for PPC)\n  Java for Mac OS X 10.4, Release 9 (only supports Java 1.5.0_19)\nAt this point it's a good idea to open Java Preferences and check which versions of Java are installed and what the preferred run order is. Sort it so that Java 6 64bit is on top, then Java 6 32bit, Java 5 64bit, Java 5 32bit.\nWithin Info.plist (see paragraph 2), find the 'JVMVersion' key and change it to '1.6+'. The next step is to replace 'JavaApplicationStub' in\nMinecraft.app/Contents/MacOS/\n\nwith the one found in\n/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/A/Resources/MacOS/\n\nUse 'Show package contents' and 'Go to folder' (⇧⌘G) to find those places.\nMost people experience improved performance when switching to 64bit. Add a key to 'JVMArchs' with the value 'x86_64' on top of the existing ones to run Java in 64bit if it is available. This step is optional but recommended.\n\n\nA: The problem is in the Minecraft launcher itself.  I checked it out:\n$ cd /Applications/Minecraft.app/Contents/MacOS\n$ file JavaApplicationStub\nJavaApplicationStub: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures\nJavaApplicationStub (for architecture i386):    Mach-O executable i386\nJavaApplicationStub (for architecture ppc): Mach-O executable ppc\n\nSo I figure if we put in a 64-bit JavaApplicationStub it will work.\nI'm not sure if a newer Minecraft launcher fixes the issue because mine was downloaded pre-1.0.\n", "Q: NTFS Read-Write App for Snow Leopard / Lion I am looking out for an app that can read and write NTFS partition.\nI am using Snow Leopard, and will update to Lion (very soon).\nI have heard about NTFS Mounter, but I think there will be other apps which are much better than NTFS Mounter.\nPlease suggest a fine app, once that you have personally tried and tested. \n\nA: I've been using Paragon NTFS ( http://www.paragon-software.com/home/ntfs-mac/ ) which I've been using since Leopard and now with Lion. It's good, but I do get the occasional problem once every couple of months. I'd rather buy a supported product as I use it quite often. If it was occasional, I'd probably got for NTFS-3g or other free options.\n\nA: I've used the trial version of Tuxera and it seems pretty solid. Paragon NTFS (linked in mekondelta's answer) is another paid utility, but I haven't tried it. And there's OSXFUSE, which is based off of the open source MacFUSE project, but I haven't tried that either.\n\nA: I use The community edition of NTFS 3G for some time now. It' works nicely - only complains now and then when the drive was not unmounted properly on windows. Given it's open source and free well worth a try. (it's also from tuxera)\nThough I wouldn't trust it to repair a drive and use it only when I have to. \n", "Q: Can an Apple Track Pad and Magic Mouse be used at the same time? I have a New 2011 iMac which came with the magic Mouse, I would like the option of having a trackpad as well for multi-touch gestures and scrolling up and down etc, but would also like the mouse for times when moving windows around and for programmes like Final Cut and Photoshop where for me a mouse is easier to use.\nWill they work together well with out interfering? obviously I will not be scrolling with one and moving with the other, I just want to switch between the two as and when I want.\nI would only like answers from personally experienced sources.\n\nA: Yes, it works fine. I have both on my 2010 iMac, and as long as you don't try to use them simultaneously, there are no problems.\n", "Q: Can I downgrade from iOS5 to iOS4?  I'm building a HTML iPhone 4 web app, and I need to convert to iOS5 because I know safari has fresh bugs which need fixing, but I need to be able to convert back tomorrow. Is this possible?  \n\nA: Depends. If your device has never been jailbroken then no, you cannot downgrade your device.\nIf your device has been jailbroken, then yes, maybe. Though it is definitely some work to edit your host file so that itunes checks a different server to sign your stuff and allow you to install a certain iOS version on your device. You got to have already given them (those jailbreak servers) your device information, which is typically strongly adviced by Cydia as well as any jailbreak instruction.\n", "Q: Is it possible to downgrade modemfirmware? I've updated the iOS on my iPhone 4 to 5.0.1 the baseband was also updated to 04.11.08. I've downgraded the OS it but the baseband didn't change, can someone help please?\n\nA: In general, it's not possible to downgrade the modem firmware / baseband software version on iOS, even if you jailbreak the device or use software designed to install modified software on an iPhone. \nIt's a popular request, so I imagine many people are working on it but nothing is out today to perform the task you ask on the iPhone 4. \n", "Q: Is it possible to change the dock icon of an application only? Is there any way to just change the icon in the dock while still keeping it the same everywhere else? It's probably not going to be possible without tweaks, so are there any programs for that?\n\nA: A workaround is to make an alias of the app, drag the alias to Dock and then change the icon for the alias ie. not for the actual app. Downside is that you get a small alias–arrow added to the lower–left corner to the icon.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make an alias\n\n*Drag the alias to the Dock\n\n*Change the icon like you would for any Finder item.  \nIn the following screenshot we have copied the icon of Chess app and pasted it to the newly–made alias of Automator. (NB, make sure you first copy the icon and then paste it; the screenshot accidentally is showing the opposite way.)\n\n", "Q: Spotlight indexes wrong HD Mac Mini Server, OSX Server 10.6.8, dual drive\nI cloned the first hard disk (HD1) to HD2 using CCC, thus creating a bootable copy.\nHowever, now I discover that when I startup from HD2, Spotlight has been indexing only HD1.\nUsing a Terminal command to rebuild the Spotlight index doesn't help. \nI get the message for HD2: There is no index.\nUsing the option for all volumes, it only rebuilds for HD1.\nThis problem is nasty, as I intend to use an Automator script that filters files, and for this it uses Spotlight (I get an error now).\nAny ideas how to bring OSX to build an index for HD2?\n\nA: mdutil -s /Volumes/* will show you the indexing status of all available volumes.\nmdutil -i on /Volumes/HD2;mdutil -i off /Volumes/HD1 should do what you're asking for.  might need to sudo based on ownership settings of each.\n\nA: Try this add HD1 and HD2 to the Privacy tab in Spotlight System Preferences panel. Then Remove HD2, and HD2 should rebuild.

This means that your password is not seen by the App, but entered on an internet page of Dropbox. Mc Loud only gets an anonymous token from Dropbox that you can revoke at any time in your Dropbox account.\nhttp://mcloud.tunesremote.com\nMc Loud Remote (a free download) can be used in Demo mode to test all features of Mc Loud. \nFeatures are:\n- universal (iPod touch, iPhone, iPad)\n- stream music and videos directly from Dropbox\n- includes a remote that lets you control Mc Loud either from any web browser or from Mc Loud Remote on another iOS device\n- fast indexing of all metadata, including title, album, artist, duration, composer, genre and album art\n- control from the lock screen\n", "Q: Which wireless controller is more compatible with Macs: Xbox 360 or PS3? I want to buy a gaming controller to play games like GTA3 from the App Store. Which controller will be most compatible with Mac OS X and games on Macs? \nEspecially it will be useful to know if you have any experience with setting up either PS3 or Xbox controller for Mac.\nUpdate: I'm especially interested in correct functioning of the analog controls (joysticks).\n\nA: Having tried both the Xbox controller and the PS3 controller on my Mac I can say: the PS3 controller is somewhat easier to get working with the Mac. It communicates via BlueTooth and pairing it is mostly painless. It's also wireless without requiring any other devices to be purchased. You can get the PS3 controller drivers from here.\nThe Xbox controller requires an additional USB dongle from Microsoft to get working if you want to use a wireless controller. Otherwise, you'll have to stick to using it as a wired controller. You can get the Xbox 360 controller drivers from here or here is an alternative driver.\nI thought the drivers for the PS3 controller were a little more stable and that the stick response was snappier than the 360 controller. But I much prefer the 360 controllers layout, weight and overall tactile feel. Personal preference there really.\n\nA: I only have the Xbox controller, I set it up using this video but to be honest I didn't like it, something doesn't feel right about using a controller and playing games on my Mac.\nBut they are both compatible, you just need the correct accessories to connect them. Decide by choosing which one you prefer.\nIf you do not mind it not being Xbox or PS3 you can get plenty of controllers for the Mac simply by Googling \"Mac games controllers\"\n\nA: A little app called Joystick Mapper can allow you to use any compatible controller with any game—whether it supports your gamepad/joystick or not.\nAll you need is a connected joystick or gamepad to get started.\n\nFrom there, you can create a new joystick and select it in the app's settings. Once you've done that, you simply bind buttons on your device to keyboard strokes and mouse actions to control whatever game you want in the way you want to control it. \nIt is available from the Mac App Store for $4.99.\n", "Q: 16, 32, 64 GB iPhone / iPod touch: are there any negative effects of size? I am debating between purchasing the 32 vs. 64 GB iPod touch.\nI would lean toward a smaller hard drive if there is an effect of size on speed or battery life. Aside from cost, are there any reasons not to get the larger memory? Specifically, is there any effect of hard drive size on speed or battery life?\n\nA: It shouldn't have any impact on performance or battery life.\nI believe the same number of flash memory chips are used in the 32 GB and 64 GB models, just in different capacities, so the power drain would be almost identical. Either way, flash memory  takes up very little power compared to things like the screen and wireless radios, so any impact would almost certainly be unnoticeable.\nAs for performance, I haven't seen any metrics on it, but iOS performance isn't really affected by device capacity. The possible exception here is when you have very little free space, but that's just a guess.\nBottom line, I would suggest not worrying about it - just buy the capacity based on your budget and needs.\n\nA: Flash storage only consumes power to read and write data, so the only conceivable manner in which storage capacity could draw more power from the battery would be that you didn't run out of storage space and could keep writing data from the network onto storage.\nApple's iOS devices all have the same RAM between generations - so that would have a marginal power draw say if one model had 1 GB of RAM and the other had 2 GB of RAM - but within a model line - the storage capacities have identical other components except for main flash storage.\n", "Q: How do I get my videos off my iPad 2? I put a bunch of videos onto my iPad 2 a while ago, syncing them over iTunes. The PC that I set this up on is no longer available. All I have now is my iPad with the videos, and a new computer with a clean install of iTunes.\nNow it seems that iTunes wants to wipe all those videos off the iPad in order to set up a sync.\nCan I get these videos off the iPad somehow?\n(connecting the iPad as a camera doesn't help: this only shows videos shot using the iPad camera, but not the videos I recorded with my camcorder and synced over iTunes)\n\nA: Have you looked into software like TouchCopy to transfer the videos? It offers a Windows and Mac version. I prefer PhoneView to this software on a Mac, but you have tagged this windows so TouchCopy seems a better fit.\n", "Q: OS X Lion: How to disable RPC? Remote procedure calls are considered to be a security risk. Is there a way for me to disable RPCs on OS X to make my Mac more secure?\n\nA: Here are my recommended settings for locking down your Mac. I'm assuming you're running OS X Lion. If that's not the case, let me know and I'll try to adjust my answer for other versions of OS X.\nTurn your Firewall on: System Preferences -> Security & Privacy Tab Settings -> Firewall tab. Make sure it's on and that you click the lock in the lower left corner to prevent changes without an administrator's password.\n\nTurn off all sharing services: System Preferences -> Sharing Settings -> Make sure all the stuff in that window is unchecked. Make sure the lock in the lower left corner is locked to prevent changes without an administrator's password.\n\nTurn off Bonjour (mDNSResponder): For OS Lion you don't need to completely disable mDNSResponder (which is good because if you disable it completely you lose DNS in Snow Leopard and newer OS X). Instead you can follow these steps to disable just Bonjour features in mDNSResponder (Note: do this carefully as a malfunctioning mDNSResponder service can prevent a Mac from booting. Make sure you have a TimeMachine backup before making changes and that booting to your recovery partition works.):\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a back up copy of the mDNSResponder.plist file as a precaution.\n\n*Open the mDNSResponder.plist file in Terminal using your preferred text editor. Here is a sample command:\nsudo nano “/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist”\n\n\n*Add <string>-NoMulticastAdvertisements</string> to the array in the ProgramArguments section. In other words:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n<string>/usr/sbin/mDNSResponder</string>\n<string>-launchd</string>\n</array>\n\nbecomes…\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n<string>/usr/sbin/mDNSResponder</string>\n<string>-launchd</string>\n<string>-NoMulticastAdvertisements</string>\n</array>\n\n\n*Save the file.\n\n*Restart your Mac.\n\n\nYou may also want to look at locking down BlueTooth on the system (System Preferences -> BlueTooth Settings). Specifically you may want to uncheck 'Discoverable' so your BlueTooth chipset doesn't advertise itself to other devices nearby. If you're not using any BlueTooth devices consider turning it off altogether.\n", "Q: Device enrollment fails, error: server certificate is invalid I have an Xserve running 10.7.2 Server fully patched today.\nWe have a valid SSL from GoDaddy installed. \nLion's firewall is off, hardware firewall is not blocking any traffic.\nFrom an iPad I can access the profile manager through the webpage https://mydomain.com/profilemanager and log in successfully.

I am referring to the one that comes straight after the \"Paste\" item.\n\nA: It suggests spelling corrections for the selected word.\n", "Q: How do I make iTunes sync automatically when an iPhone, iPad or iPod is connected? When iTunes is already running and I plug in my iPhone or iPad, the device appears correctly in iTunes but it doesn't sync automatically. I'm sure it always used to sync automatically on connection, but now I need to start the sync manually (i.e. by selecting the device and clicking the Sync button). Does anyone know how I can get it to sync automatically as soon as the device is connected?\nMy details are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes 10.5.1.42 on Windows 7 64-bit\n\n*iPhone 4 and iPad 2, both with iOS 5.0.1\n\n*iTunes > Preferences > Devices > \"Prevent iPods, iPhones and iPads from syncing automatically\" is unchecked.\n\n*For both devices, the iTunes setting \"Open iTunes when this iPhone/iPad is connected\" is unchecked.\n\n*I'm syncing via a USB cable. (I did try Wi-Fi sync but iTunes hardly ever found the devices so I disabled it on both iPhone and iPad. This may have been around the time auto-sync stopped working too but I can't be sure.)\n\n*I don't use iCloud for sync or backup.\n\n*It's the same laptop and library I've always synced against (so this answer doesn't seem to be relevant in my case)\n\n*iTunesHelper.exe and iPodService.exe are both running normally.\n\n\nA: Your list holds the answer, specifically #4. The problem is the fact that when iTunes it prevented from automatically opening when a device is connected, there's a whole list of actions that simply don't happen, sync triggering is one of them.\nRe-enable 'Open iTunes when this iPhone/iPad is connected' and your syncs should work normally, and automatically, again.\n\nA: Check that C:\\Program Files\\iTunes\\iTunesHelper.exe is not disabled from running on startup. You can do this by using a free tool like CCleaner and accessing the startup list via Tools>Startup.\n\nA: I had the very same problem and did the following to resolve:\n\nGo to \"Preferences\" on the iTunes menu (top left of the iTunes screen)\n  Select \"Devices\"\n  Untick the \"Prevent iPods, iPhones and iPads from synching automatically\" box and submit with \"OK\"\n  Thats IT!\n\n", "Q: How does \"sharing\" of purchased apps work on iPhone and iPad? If I buy an app for iPad or iPhone, then login to my account on a few other iPhones and download that app, are there any restrictions on how many devices I can install that application on?\nOnce I've downloaded the app to the maximum amount of devices, will my restriction be lifted if I delete the app on those devices?\nBasically, how exactly does installing apps, with the same account, on multiple devices work?\n\nA: There isn't a limit to this (or there isn't yet a limit that is imposed by Apple); you should be able to install iOS apps that you purchase on all your iOS devices (obviously using the same Apple ID).\nFrom the Apple iTunes Terms of Service:\n\nAPP STORE PRODUCT USAGE RULES\n(i) If you are an individual acting in your personal capacity, you may download and sync an App Store Product for personal, noncommercial use on any iOS Device you own or control.\n\n", "Q: How to change the default gateway of a Mac OSX machine I am familiar with the route add default gw command in Linux to add a default gateway, but this doesnt work on Mac OS. I cant find any appropriate example in the route manual. Can anyone help me the command.\n\nA: If you are intent on using route the man page for route will show you it's the same as most BSD route commands. You may need ip6config (and man page) as well if you care about IPv6 routing.\nThe \"mac\" way is to set it from the System Preference pane under network and is preferred over using unix commands since it honors location changes and other events such as a reboot.\n\n\nA: $ route delete default\n$ route add default 192.168.0.1\n\nor\n$ route change default -interface $INTF\n$ route change 192.168.0.0/16 -interface $INTF\n\n\nA: Go to System Preference >> Network, and you can \"Set Service Order\" of the network interfaces and effectively change the default route order in the routing table.\n\n", "Q: How can I recover files from a failing hard drive? I am in the process of trying to recover files from a failed MacBook hard drive. While I've already replaced the drive in the machine itself and installed a fresh copy of OS X, I have the old drive in an external 2.5\" SATA enclosure. I am able to (very, very slowly) view the directory structure and copy files, but it's an incredibly slow process and one failed file stops the whole thing. While I know there are paid drive recovery utilities out there, I'm just looking for something that will attempt to copy all of the files and directories from within a given directory and just skip the ones that can't be copied (ideally, I'd also like to know which files get skipped, but that's not a requirement). \n\nA: You could use ddrescue to try to clone the raw volume (there are some notes on running it under OS X on tinyapps.org). It basically tries to read over & over, getting as much as possible from the disk.\nThis isn't ideal for your situation, since it 1) needs enough free disk space (either a volume or a disk image) to hold the entire drive, including free space (i.e. if it was a 200GB drive with 10GB of files, you need 200GB to hold the clone); and 2) it doesn't tell you which files it couldn't read (you can look at the log and see what blocks it hasn't been able to read, but figuring out what files those blocks are part of is not trivial).\nThe good news about is that, thanks to its log file, if it missed something you need (and you haven't modified the target volume at all -- mounting readonly is recommended), you can just run it again and it'll pick up where it left off, and keep hammering on the difficult blocks until they give up their data.\n", "Q: Can I plug my Iomega hard drive into my new BT Home Hub and access the tunes stored in it from my MacBook Pro wirelessly? We have just acquired a BT home Hub router which has a USB socket. I have my music stored in an Iomega hard drive and normally plug this into the MacBook, which is a bit clumsy. ( I have told iTunes where to find my music when I am logged in. My partner uses the Mac to store her music.) \nI was hoping to be able to plug the Iomega into the Home Hub which would send the music to the Mac (or indeed iPad) wherever it is in the house. \nDoes anyone know if this is possible and where I'd start; or should I just ring BT?\n\nA: You can connect a USB hard disk to the home hub, and access it as an SMB network drive. There are instructions on the BT website.\nYou would be able to open your iTunes library from the network drive, but the home hub doesn't have an iTunes server built in (or at least the v2 I have doesn't, and I can't see any mention of it in the v3 features) so it won't appear as a shared library in iTunes. \nMake sure the drive is formatted to Fat32 and it's basically plug and play.\n", "Q: Is there a currently available way to connect firewire to a 2011 MacBook Air besides the Apple Thunderbolt monitor? If one wanted to connect a firewire peripheral to a 2011 MacBook Air, one could buy Apple's Thunderbolt monitor, connect the monitor to the Air and the peripheral to the monitor. That's kind of overkill, however, for simply connecting a Firewire music keyboard. Does any other method currently exist?\n\nA: Nothing shipping immediately, however Sonnet did announce a Thunderbolt ExpressCard adapter  that you could pair with a Firewire ExpressCard to give yourself some Firewire capabilities. Their site claims it will start to ship by December 14, 2011. At one point a   direct Thunderbolt to Firewire adapter was announced, but I can't find any concrete info on it, so I wouldn't count on it appearing any time soon.\nOverall Thunderbolt support from anyone other than Apple has been pretty slow to take off. There have been some suggestions that Intel was slow releasing final specs for manufacturers and/or getting production hardware out the door. I've also read that some manufacturers may be waiting for the 2nd generation of cheaper Thunderbolt chips to ship sometime in 2012. Lots of promise in the technology, and I think it will take off sooner or later, but it's still in the early stages unfortunately.\n\nA: Apple announced a Thunderbolt to FireWire 800 cable at WWDC 2012. It seems that this cable will be shipping in July 2012. (The adapter is mentioned at the bottom of this page.)\n", "Q: Extract a sound from a Classic application for Mac OS X? How can I extract a single 'snd' resource from a classic application into a form that Mac OS X can play?\nI can use derez to get the snd resource out, but from there I'm not sure how to assemble it into a form Mac OS X can read.\nThis is on Lion; I have no access to earlier Macs.\nDerezed,it starts like this:\ndata 'snd ' (3004, \"metal stamp\", purgeable) {\n    $\"0002 0000 0001 8050 0000 0000 000E 0000\"            /* ......ÄP........ */\n    $\"0000 0000 159E 2B77 45D1 0000 159C 0000\"            /* .....û+wE—...ú.. */\n    $\"159D 003C 787D 807E 7D7D 8087 8376 6E72\"            /* .ù.<x}Ä~}}ÄáÉvnr */\n    $\"7C87 8782 8789 857F 7169 5F74 9891 7068\"            /* |ááÇáâÖ.qi_tòëph */\n\n\nA: I had some System 7 Sound files, too.

Sheepshaver is a emulation system for Classic Mac OS running on OSX.\nThen use a program such as Audio Hijack Pro or Piezo to record the sound as it plays, by hijacking Sheepshaver.\nYou'll get a good digital copy of the original sound in an AIFF format if you use Audio Hijack Pro, and in a lesser format with Piezo.\n\nA: I used SoundExtractor to extract \"platinum sound\" single file from Mac OS classic (I found it in /Applications/System Folder/Apparency/Sound Effects as I activated classical support, I didn't know where but it can run classical apps this way).\nThen the 68 files can't be read. No extension at the end of these files! So I used Amadeus II to turn them in aiff format.\nI made all that with my Tiger eMac and \"classic\", made by Apple for Mac OS X in order to use classic applications.\nSo you can now put them in the sounds folder (or create it) in your library (~/Library/Sounds/).\nYou can even turn aiff sounds into AAC (m4a) format using iTunes and even more, change the .m4a extension to .m4r to make then as a ringtone for iOS devices!\nBut when I want to put all those 68 .m4r sounds into iTunes, it refuses them like if they were from an incompatible format. Perhaps it needs to delete all the .m4a files? I'll try that tomorrow!\nPlease note that I use a French version of Mac so I translated the paths as I think it must be in English.\n\nA: What turned out easiest for me was:\nFirst I had to set the file type (it was lost somewhere along the way)\nSetFile -type 'sfil' AudioFileToConvert.au\nThen I used the converter tool from SystemSound Converter, which turned it into an AIFF file with no hassle.\n", "Q: iTunes opens directly to music, not the store When I open iTunes it opens directly to the store.

To set it to open to your music, make sure that that's the last page that you view before closing iTunes.\n", "Q: Is there macOS software to convert PostScript type 1 font to ttf? Is there any software out there that can convert PostScript type 1 font to ttf?\n\n*\n\n*let's set aside the legality of owning a font face unless a tool has that as a feature to flag and assist in licensing details\n\n*solutions that substitute and/or convert in place are fine - better if one tool does both.\n\n\nA: Yes. You can try FontForge.\n\nAn outline font editor that lets you create [or edit] your own\npostscript, truetype,  [... ] fonts. Also lets you convert one\nformat to another.\n\nIt may be a bit intimidating to install and use at first, but it’s very powerful and should be able to do the job. One way to install FontForge: use Homebrew (brew install fontforge)\n\nA: I would suggest converting PostScript Type 1 fonts to OTF, rather than TTF, as OTF fonts are 'just' wrappers for the same PostScript data, sorted by Unicode. TrueType uses a different method for representing curves, so the result will be a 'translation' of sorts.\nFontForge is still the go-to free font editor. There are other utilities, usually paid-for, which are specifically designed to do the job, such as TransType from FontLab.\nThere is also the Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType, which is a free python library, though you'll have spend time and effort instead of money.\nhttps://pypi.org/project/afdko/\nThere are online font converters, though I would hesitate before using them, as I suspect that while they may provide a reasonable enough conversion, some of them may be repurposing those font files for their own use.\nType 1 fonts are now described by Apple as 'legacy' (which should be a sufficient red flag). Adobe is also phasing out support for their use in its products.\n\nA: This is a bash script that I use on Mac and requires FontForge. You can adapt it to convert to ttf or otf fonts. Of course, you have to take into account the issue of font licenses and that valuable information from the font is lost in the conversion.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction ffconvert {\n   /Applications/FontForge.app/Contents/Resources/opt/local/bin/fontforge -lang=ff -c 'Open($1); Generate($2)' \"$1\" \"$2\"\n}\n\nfor f in *.pfb ; do\n   ffconvert \"$f\" \"${f%.pfb}.ttf\"\ndone\n\n", "Q: Can I stream with Airplay from my iPhone to a compatible 3rd Party device? It may be just me, but Apple's website seems to beat around the bush regarding the use of Airplay. I just need to know: Over wireless can I stream directly from my iPhone to an Airplay-Enabled 3rd party sound system (No AppleTV, no Airport Express, no Macbook)?\n\nA: Yep. Apple licenses the receiver portion of AirPlay to 3rd party manufacturers, so they can build compatible receivers meant to work with iOS and OS X devices.\nAs long as the device you're going to use is AirPlay compatible, it should work.\n", "Q: Is it possible to keep archive functionality when setting up GMail as Exchange account on iPhone? When you set up GMail on an iPhone normally, the delete icon in the mail app is replaced by an archive icon, as this is the most common action in GMail.\nI changed my settings to configure GMail as an Exchange account, as I wanted to enable push email for this account.  But this has changed the archive icon to a delete icon.\nIs it possible to maintain the archive icon while it's set up as a Gmail account?\n\nA: I'm actually about to ask the opposite question, but the delete functionality in Exchange GMail archives the email and does not delete it.\n", "Q: How can I download free music from the internet to itunes on the iphone/ipad without using a mac/pc? There are loads of bands on the internet offering their music as free downloads on their websites. Either as zips or direct mp3 downloads. What ways are there for iphone/ipad users to get the music playable via itunes without taking the mac/pc detour and without jailbreacking?  \n\nA: There are no ways to download an .mp3 using only your iOS device for later use by the Music app on said iOS device.\nYou have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download music via the iTunes app on your iDevice.  \n\n*Download music on your Mac/PC and synchronize with your iDevice.\n\n\nA: Depending on the way the audio files are provided it might be possible to load them into GoodReader directly from the web and play them from there. But there is no way to load them into Music directly on the iDevice.\n\nA: iCab Mobile -browser here downloads the files to its own dir in the app and then you can open things in external program let say DropBox. It has some problems with some formats but there is a hack: you can zip things and then it will work for sure. It works at least with PDFs, MP3 and ZIPs.\nBelow you can find a proof, I used the soundtracks here. And I did not use iTunes -- only iPad, free of iTunes jail :D\n\n\n\nA: When \"previewing\" an MP3 in Safari or in Mail on an iPad, in the past several versions of IOS, you have the \"Open In\" option to put the file in any installed app that can accept files.  Many such apps can play MP3s.  However, \"Music\" (formerly known as iTunes) will not be on the list.\nNothing against GoodReader or iCab, but neither of them is mandatory.\n", "Q: Why might a Macbook Pro go back into sleep shortly after waking up? Whenever I wake up my mac by opening the lid, approximately 20 seconds later it will put itself to sleep again, even though I'm actively working on it. I'm guessing it's \"deep sleep\" (hibernation) because the indicator light turns completely off, not just blinking.\nWaiting until the sleep process is completed and then pushing the power button will wake the laptop again, and this time it will work fine. So the whole business takes less then a minute, but it's still a little annoying.\nWhat causes this behavior, and how can I fix it? This happens every time I open the lid, but it's a relatively new thing, just happening for the past week or two.\n\nA: Possibilities include (listed from the best case to worst case):\n\n\n*\n\n*Incorrect SMC settings. To fix this: read\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964 (your situation is described the Power section)\n\n*A battery that's not retaining its charges. To check: read about Battery Cycle Count at http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1519\nThere are other possibilities but let's try these first. Feedback if these doesn't work for you.\n\nA: The problem sorted itself out. How? I don't know. Why did it happen in the first place? I don't know. But if any future victim encounters this question looking for a solution, be aware it might go away by itself after a few restarts.\n", "Q: How to disable auto preview for *.doc *.docx in finder? In finder, when I set the view mode as columns(cmd+3), finder will auto preview the file.But when I select doc/docx file the finder will be very slow even I cann't do anything for a while.How can I disable auto preview for doc/docx? Thx\n\nA: Open Finder, press ⌘+G and enter /System/Library/QuickLook/ to go to the QuickLook plugins folder. Click on Office.qlgenerator, press ⌘+I and rename the file to Office.qlgenerator.backup. Now, press ⌘+⌥+esc and relaunch Finder. If ever you want to turn the plugin back on, simply remove the .backup from the file name.\nEssentially, plugins tell QuickLook how to render a preview of a given file type. Without the Office plugin, QuickLook will by default show only the icon and information about the file (i.e. size, date created, etc.)\nNote I'm pretty sure this removes QuickLook's capabilities of previewing OpenOffice files as well. \n", "Q: server & network setup ok - just bought a mac mini server but not sure about the best way to set it up for remote access etc.\nAt the moment its;\ncable modem (has 4 ethernet ports) > airport extreme > lion server (& other machines)\nshould it be\ncable modem eth1:airport extreme, cable modem eth2:lion server\n(& other machines connected wirelessly to airport extreme)\nwhat would be best? And which is the easiest to setup or manage?\nBasically i want to setup the services so vnc://server.mydomain.com would open screen sharing for the server and not sure if i need to do this on the cable modem, Airport extreme etc.\nCurrently the modem has DMZ active and points to the airport extreme IP.\nhope that's not too vague as this is a bit of a new area for me.\nbest, dan.\n\nA: If you only want to host VNC on your Lion server I'd suggest opening the specific port for that service (TCP 5900) on your modem/router and forward it to your Lion server, as opposed to putting it on a DMZ which fully exposes the machine to the internet.\nTo be able to get to your server using a human readable address like - server.mydomain.com, you need to own a domain (mydomain.com) and then link your actual internet IP address (that your internet provider gives you) to that domain (e.g. server.mydomain.com). It's pretty much as simple as that if your internet IP address doesn't change (is static). If your IP address regularly changes, this kind of approach isn't really possible...\nThe easiest way to get a DNS (human readable) address is to use a service like DynDNS or No-IP. These constantly check what your IP address is and keep internet DNS records up to date with your current IP address. It requires that your modem/router is compatible with such a service, or that you run a piece of software on a machine (your Lion server maybe) that's inside your network.\nSo;\n1) Forward port 5900 TCP to your Lion server (Port forwarding settings in your modem/router)\n2) Set up DNS so that you don't have to remember your IP and so that if your IP changes, you can still connect back to it.\n3) Enable screen sharing on the Lion server. Tell it which users you want to be able to connect. Set a password.\nI'd recommend looking into using your Lion box as a VPN or SSH server so that you can do all these kinds of things over a single encrypted link. VNC isn't the safest of protocols!\n", "Q: Outlook removes text after inline attachment from mail send by Mail.app Whenever I send an e-mail from Mail.app to someone with Outlook, they can't read any text that is placed beneath an inline attachment.\nWhen I send an e-mail to myself from Mail.app any text that is placed beneath an inline attachment is attached as text-files.\nThis is very annoying, does anyone know how to fix this problem?\n\nA: Under Edit > Attachments, check Always send Windows-friend attachments.\nThat way, the text beneath the attachment won't be cut off.\nAlternatively, you can do that on a per-message basis in the attachment file selector window, like so:\n\n\nA: Their is no solution. A workaround is to insert attachments at the end of the message.\nYou can set that as this as a default:\n\n*\n\n*For the current message: Choose Edit > Attachments > Insert Attachments at End.\n\n*For all messages: From the Message viewer, choose Edit > Attachments > Always Insert Attachments at End of Message (a tick shows it’s on).\n\nThis is not a solution because you loose the benefit of inline attachment. It's also problematic if you have conversation where you recopies the past answer in the body of your email.\nNote the \"send Windows-Friendly Attachments\" option do not fix the problem.\nPlease report this bug to https://www.apple.com/feedback/mail.html . All other major email client are capable of sending inline attachment to outlook without this issues. Apple Mail can only send attachment inline which make this issue terrible.\n", "Q: How do I make an iPad app free for certain users? I would like to know how to make an iPad app for free for users buying a Mac app, via the appstore.\nMy goal is to do a promotion like \"Buy Mac app and get an iPad app for free!\"\n\nA: I guess you'll be limited to the 50 (?) promo code you can generate per each version of your iPad app. Sorry.\n\nA: I'll suggest using a database on your website. When you buy the MAS version of the app you need to register it, this creates an entry in your DB that sets up the user has having purchased the app.\nNow when they download the iDevice version of your app they're required to enter credentials that can be used to verify them against your web database. If they match up with what they entered when they set up their web account using the MAS-purchased app you let them use the iDevice app. If not, show them the screen that tells them how to buy it from the MAS first.\nThis a slight twist on how subscription-based apps like LastPass operate their iDevice offerings. As long as you're a LastPass premium subscriber, the iDevice apps (which are free) work. Stop subscribing and the iDevice apps stop working as they're a \"premium user\" feature.\n\nA: The only way is to make your iPad app a Free app.\nRedeem codes are limited to 50 per version, and your agreement with Apple may restrict their use.\nYou can buy and gift a Paid app to someone, even your own app.  In the case of your own app, you will eventually get about 70% of the price back from Apple.\nThere is no reliable way for a developer to identify anyone who gets an App store app in any way, either by purchase, redemption code, or gift.\n", "Q: erased HD, did clean install, no iLife -- can I get iLife off from MacBook DVD? My MacBook came with Snow Leopard installed and it came with \"recovery\" DVDs, I upgraded to Lion via the App Store.  I had a problem with my MacBook -- the Apple Genius concluded I needed to do a full clean reinstall of Lion.\nI erased the HD and reinstalled Lion. Everything's good now, except I don't have the iLife apps.\nHow do I get iLife?\nFor example, can I get the iLife apps off of the (Snow Leopard) DVDs that came with my MacBook?\nThanks,\nRob\n\nA: For pre-mid-2011 machines, yes, the recovery DVD is the way to reinstall iLife. For machines that ship with Lion, your account at the App Store should be credited with the iLife programs in the Purchased tab; go there, sign in, and you can redownload them.\n\nA: In order to get them back with out repurchasing them from the MAS, what you could have done is do a clean reinstall from your Snow Leopard recovery dvd, and then re-install Lion on top of that.\niLife does not come with the operating system, it comes with the computer, so by wiping it clean and only re-installing Lion, you miss out.\nYou can either start over with Snow Leopard or purchase them again from the MAS.\n", "Q: Do the iPad 2 and the 6th generation iPod Nano have the same docking connector? I am looking to purchase a Speaker docking system for an iPad2, I also want to be able to use a 6th generation iPod Nano with the same dock connection.\nIs the connection on the iPad 2 the same as the connection on the iPod Nano?\n\nA: The iPod Nano 6th gen uses a 32 pin connector, the same found on iPod classic, iPhones, and more importantly in your case the iPad/2  you will find all the specficatons for docks on the Apple support website. Although it doesn't mention the 6th gen Nano.\nThis omission makes things slightly unclear however if you check out the product description for the Apple dock connector to USB cable you will see it is compatible with the 6th Gen iPod nano. \n", "Q: MBP A1150 still does not power on after logic board replacement Two years ago my MacBook Pro A1150 Core Duo 15\" died. How? Basically the MagSafe will stay green, but the machine will not power on. The DVD drive will make some noise, but it will do nothing else.\nI took it to Apple service and they diagnosed a burned logic board; please shell out $1000 kthxbye. So the machine went in a drawer for the next two years.\nRecently I bought a brand new logic board replacement on eBay at $250 with the hope of bringing new life to the MBP. I followed the iFixit guide for logic board replacement to the letter, and Ii'm pretty sure I did everything correctly.\nHowever, when I connected it to the power adapter, it will show up green, but it will not power on. The DVD drive makes some noise, but it will do nothing else.\nIf this sounds exactly what was happening before, then you would be right. So I'm tempted to believe that Apple service did a bad/lazy diagnostic and the problem is something else. The question is how to diagnose the source of the problem?\nI am tempted to think it might be the left-side I/O board which houses the power controller. But I would like to be sure before going back parts shopping.\n\nA: Sadly, the way to diagnose these things is to replace one thing at a time and avoid breaking things like fragile connectors until the symptom goes away. This is a losing battle for one-off repairs and why only large shops can afford to have the experience and tools / parts on hand to repair machines with symptoms that are not simple or obvious. You can't see most damage and even testing for it is usually harder than exchanging a whole component to see if it addresses the larger system issue.\nWithout the manufacturer knowledge and diagnostic tools, you (and I) are at a handicap at telling what is really failing and doing subcomponent repair is extremely tricky without a professional shop and dedicated tools / test rig to ensure the new logic board is functioning.\nIf it's worth $400 to get fixed, perhaps go back and have Apple or an authorized tech check your work and see if it's still eligible for a repair. Worst case is you have to pay the labor fee to get it looked at - in the US I believe it's $39 for labor and no parts used for any Mac repair.\nI would suggest being up front with them as there are three scenarios if you admit having been inside the mac to try and fix it yourself:\n\n\n*\n\n*They just dismiss you as a hack and don't even look at the work to see if the mac was damaged during the repair - this is far less likely if you aren't actively deceiving the tech.\n\n*They appreciate the honesty and can see that things are broken and might quote you to fix whatever is wrong - covering anything they can be sure was a manufacturing issue - charging you for any damage caused by whatever.\n\n*They appreciate the honesty (and gumption to attempt a repair like that) and can see you did great work. In this case there is no damage to fix and they can just proceed with a normal repair where it wasn't worked on. You almost certainly want to have the original logic board inside the mac if there's any doubt it's the wrong part.\n\n\nHaving been inside the computer, you will know how well you got all the minute connectors off and back together and can appreciate how delicate and cramped the connectors and parts are inside. It's entirely possible one of the cables needs to be repaired in addition to (or in stead of) the main board. Also, what if the problem was in the magsafe board or some other part drawing too much current / blocking the communications buses to allow the machine to start. You can't know until you do all the work to isolate the issue at which point the issue is trivial to remedy.\n\nIn your specific case - being in Panama, you might have to just arrange mail in service in the US (or another country) and pay to have it shipped. Just be clear on what the charges might be for diagnosis / shipping if it turns out to be damaged or not repairable under the flat rate (no damage / no unauthorized repairs) plan.\n", "Q: How do I change the location of screenshot in OS X Lion? The old method that works for Leopard/Snow Leopard doesn't work any more on Lion: \ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/kamus/Pictures/snap\n\nHas something changed or does anyone have some good workarounds?\n\nA: Perhaps it's because your path isn't really a path to a folder:\nNotice to terminating /:\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/kamus/Pictures/snap/\n\n\nA: You can also try TinkerTool to accomplish the same thing. I've found that TinkerTool is much easier than having to remember a whole bunch of defaults write com.apple... commands. It has all of the most useful ones in one place for you to easily change. You can find the screenshot destination one under the General tab:\n \n(as noted by this comment, you don't have to log out and back in again, just use the Terminal command killall SystemUIServer)\n", "Q: Avoid automatic shutdown I have a MacBook Pro running Lion. Usually, I need to run tasks that takes hours... so I just leave the laptop working before going to bed.\nWhen I wake up, I notice that it tried to shutdown the system. How do I notice this? Well... all apps are closed except for iTerm (which always stops shutdown process when there is more than one tab open).\nI tried to search the energy saving settings but there is nothing related to this... I would like to see how to prevent this behavior.\n\nA: *\n\n*Make sure your power adapter is connected to the Mac while you are sleeping.\n\n*In the Power Adapter section in Energy Saver, make the \"computer sleep\" -> \"never\".\n\n*You don't want your screen is on when you are in bed right? So make \"Display sleep\" -> some minutes.\n\n*Uncheck \"Put the hard disk(s) to sleep when possible\" and \"Restart automatically if the computer freezes\".\nThat should work!\n\nA: You can also temporarily disable sleep from the command line with \"caffeinate\" regardless of the sleep settings in system preferences.\n\nThe basic function of caffeinate when run without any arguments it to prevent active sleep while caffeinate is running:\ncaffeinate\n\nIt will prevent active sleep until you stop caffeinate with \"Control + C\" or kill all caffeinate processes. After termination the MacBook will resume its normal behaviour (perfect for a computational intensive task)\nYou can also run caffeinate for a specific pre-determined amount of time to prevent sleeping for that specific amount of time e.g. 4 hours (specify time in seconds) - The ampersand makes the terminal run the process in the background so you continue working.\ncaffeinate -t 144000 &\n\nCaffeinate can also be attached to other commands to prevent the MacBook from sleeping while the given command is being executed:\ncaffeinate [command_to_run] -arguments\n\nFor a full list of options please refer to the man-page\n", "Q: Adding a desktop button to the Dock or Menu Bar I am an Apple newbie, I want to know how I can add a desktop button that takes me to the Desktop either in the Dock or in the menu bar at the top of the screen. \n\nA: While you could create an AppleScript application that triggers Expose's reveal Desktop function, save it, and put it in the Dock, an easier solution would be to use Hot Corners. Then, when you put your mouse in a screen corner, it reveals the desktop.\nIf you wanted to go the AppleScript route, you'd create a script that said tell application \"System Events\" to key code 103, save it as an application, and put that application in the Dock.\n\nTo go the hot corners route, in Lion, the preferences is under Mission Control in System Preferences.\n\nWhile it is certainly feasible to create a program that puts an icon in the menu bar to reveal the Desktop, it requires programming techniques beyond the scope of this site.\n", "Q: Intermittent Active Directory login issues on Lion We bought a 27\" iMac for our CEO. And we brought in some consultants to hook it up to our windows Active Directory using ADmitMac. Back when we were on 10.6.x things were hunky dory. But then our CEO upgraded to 10.7 and the fun started.\nThe fun I'm referring to is a horribly maddening and difficult to reproduce issue where sometimes when the mac comes out of sleep mode it refuses to accept his active directory credentials until we reboot the system. Typically this happens at a critical juncture resulting in a very angry CEO. Angry CEOs are not good for stable employment.\nAny idea how to isolate and fix this issue, short of just rebuilding the iMac and praying?\nUPDATE: apparently clicking switch users also allows him to login. \n\nA: I think we ran down the culpert -- said CEO upgraded himself to Lion without our knowledge and consent. And turned on the wifi to an AP that can't resolve our domain controllers. Sometimes, when logging back in, he reached out on the wrong connection and it got a bit confused.\n", "Q: Upgrade a MBP(8,1) dual i7 to 16GB RAM from 4GB or to a SSD? I currently find my new computer a bit slow when it comes to my number crunching requirements. Also, I find my computer painfully slow when it's running VirtualBox. \nMy budget is around $500.

Only caveat would be if your MBP is one of early ones that had Optical SATA connector capped at 3Gbps. Then if you want SSD to be as fast as possible it's better to put it in place of HDD.\n", "Q: Why is my memory still inactive after purging? I'm trying to understand how memory is allocated on my machine.  I have read, and believe I understand, these posts and associated links:\nTrouble Understanding Inactive Memory in MacOSX, Inactive Memory\nHowever, I still have 10 GB of 'inactive' memory while a process is using ~25 GB of swap.  My machine has 32 GB RAM and a single process is using 21GB Real Mem / 24 Private / 34 virtual.\nWhy is this process going to swap?  Is it really using all that memory that's labeled inactive, or is it possible that something is wrong with my inactive memory?  I've tried purgeing, but that had no effect according to activity monitor.\n\nA: I was doing some reading about inactive memory after wondering about it myself. My understanding is that inactive memory is memory containing programs and data which you have quit. OS X keeps the memory incase you decide to restart the program. Because it is still in memory it can start it much quicker. You can see this in action by quitting a large program and restarting it. It should start much faster than it originally did.\nInactive memory does not suck up your memory though because OS X regards it as still available for programs to use, jsut at a lower priority than free memory. ie. if OS X needs memory for another program, it will allocate memory from the free area, then the  inactive allocation. So when thinking about how much memory you have free for applications to use, inactive and free is combined.\nAs for swap, if a program is using it you should easily be able to tell by the amount of I/O going on and a noticable slow down. \nIf you really want to see whats going on I would suggest download iStat menus which is a really nice tool for seeing the internals of your system and display various instruments in the menu bar.\n\nA: I really don't recommend purgeing, or even trying to fully understand OS X's memory system. Unless you're experiencing performance issues, just take Activity Monitor out of your dock and let your computer do its thing. (That's what Macs are supposed to be like, anyway.)\nIn a more technical and less sarcastic explanation:\nYour Mac will automatically manage it's resources to obtain maximum performance. Inactive memory is a big part of this.\n", "Q: Is there a key stroke to switch to a fullscreen app in Lion? I normally switch around my virtual desktops using the ctrl+num. Now, Exposé shows all the desktops and the fullscreen app whereupon clicking the fullscreen app rectangle will take me back to it. I'd rather do so via keyboard nav. cmd+tab doesn't work for me because I'm doing this with VMware where I have multiple windows open, one is fullscreen, others are not. cmd+tab seems to land me on whatever VMware window it randomly chooses.\n\nA: You can configure these shortcuts in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Mission Control\nI think the default is control-option-left/right arrow, at least that's what I have it set to.\nIn mission control, you can also re-order the position of the desktops/full screen apps by dragging them around. I think by default they're ordered by most-recently used desktop, but you can change that (I can't remember how, that would be a separate question anyway).\n\nA: By default it's Command+Control+F. \nHowever, it doesn't work in all apps. Some don't do full screen and some pre-Lion apps retain their original full-screen keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Command-Shift-F in Firefox).\n", "Q: Activate older iPhone without proper SIM? I recently upgraded to the iPhone 4s from my 3gs. I do not want to sell my 3gs as I would like to keep it as a 32gb iPod essentially.\nWhen I transfered to the 4s, they swapped my regular SIM for my new micro sim. No problems here. However, once I updated my 3gs to ios5, it requests that I need a SIM for activation, one I no longer have. \nI am not sure how to go about this?\nNote: I really don't want to go through the process of jailbreaking/unlocking my 3gs. I am familiar with it and know how it is done but do not wish to do so on this phone.\n\nA: I'm going out on a limb a bit but I think this might work.  Notice all the disclaimers.\nIf you have a spare GSM phone, go to an AT&T store with it, buy a pre-paid SIM card, and have them activate it.  Go home and swap the card into your 3GS.  It should work immediately for voice and text.  Data requires some extra steps but it doesn't sound like you care about that.  My local store just gave me a SIM and activated it in my phone when I purchased a $10 credit.  YMMV.\nThat said, I have not taken the next step of moving my card into an iPhone.  I'm planning on buying an unlocked 4S but I'm working up the courage to pull the trigger on a big purchase that might not work out as expected.\nDon't take your iPhone into the AT&T store as they don't support iPhones on prepay plans and \"don't support\" translates into they won't sell you the SIM.\nIf you don't have a spare GSM phone, you could buy a cheap, used one on eBay.  You could also try buying a cheap AT&T GoPhone ($10 at Best Buy) and using the SIM from it but I've heard that the SIM card gets locked to the phone for 90 days after it's activated.  I also hear that you can take the card out before turning the phone on, put it in your iPhone, and activiate it from the AT&T web site.\nIn theory, \"don't support\" could translate into actively blocking iPhones on the prepay plan at some point but no sign of it so far and once you get activated, you don't care anyway.\nIf you do this, let us know how it turns out.\n\nA: All you need is a SIM from the carrier for that phone. In the US, that mean AT&T for anything but a phone sold into VZW or Sprint. \nIt does not need to be in service or associated with a current account, just any SIM that is newer than the phone. \nWorst case, order the cheapest prepaid SIM from AT&T with no data plan or pay someone with AT&T service currently to go ask / pay for a replacement SIM. They put that new sim in their phone and their old sim is deactivated. You use the deactivated one. \niTunes just checks for it to belong to the correct carrier if the device itself is currently locked to a specific carrier. \n\nA: Just buy a sim adapter, and put the micro sim that you have in the adapter which then will fit your 3GS. That will allow you to activate the phone. There is no need to buy another sim card, but (like others said) you do need a sim card.\n", "Q: RSS reader and archiver application? I am looking for a decent RSS reader app that would double up as an archiver. It would let me flag any posts that I find valuable for PERMANENT storage in a database. Even when the blog is no longer online, this application would let me browse and read the articles I've saved, for YEARS to come.\nSo I am really looking for the ability to backup RSS posts. Reading offline is only a side effect. I want to be able to flag some of my feeds for permanent storage too, so I don't need to flag each post individually.\nSome of the blogs I have been following on personal development topics have a distinct voice and just won't be replaced. Unfortunately, as I have found out blogs (and forums) do disappear. And with them, a treasure trove of information that would have continued to be useful to me for years to come.\nDoes a solution exist on OS X or iOS?\n\nA: Newsfire archives entries as long as you want it to.\n", "Q: MacBook Air Mid 2011: headphone plug makes weird noises If I turn a headphone plug around in the headphone jack, it makes really loud and weird creaking noises. I just want to make sure that my Macbook Air isn't the only one which does that.\nI already had a close look into the jack, but nothing seems to be wrong with it.\n\nA: There is no such sound coming from mine. Sorry to say this - but it sounds like you have a repair coming your way.\nIt might still just be the headphones though - have you tried with different sets??\n\nA: That sounds like possibly the Inductor for your audio rail has gone bad, if you are competent with electronics you could locate the inductor on your board, schematics are widely available, with a multimeter you can measure the inductance, if its simply your inductor that has gone bad its a easy fix, have you tried it with any other headphone?\n", "Q: Can't start any VMs using VMWare Fusion v3 on Mac OS X, nor upgrade to v4 The flop:  I was running a linux VM under VMware Fusion 3 on my Mac OS X Snow Leopard laptop.  The VM was located on an external hard drive.  The laptop battery died and the system went down.\nThe turn:  After plugging in the AC adapter and starting up the laptop (WITHOUT the external hard drive plugged in).  Fusion complained about the missing VM file(s), so I closed the VM and Fusion.  I then reinserted the external hard drive and tried to start the VM.  Fusion froze for a couple minutes, then I got an 'internal error' from Fusion.  So I closed Fusion and tried again - same thing.  Then I restarted the laptop - same thing.  Then I tried starting a different VM (located on my laptop's HD) and Fusion froze for a bit and then said \"The connection timed out.\"  I rebooted and tried starting a local VM again - same thing.  So now I can't start ANY VMs...\nThe river:  After hopelessly searching the Internet for solutions, I decided to upgrade to Fusion 4, to see if that would solve my problem.  Turns out I can't even do that.  When I try using the 'Upgrade from v3 to v4' option in the DMG, I get an error message:  \"A virtual machine is running with an older version of VMware Fusion.\"  Despite the fact that VMware Fusion is NOT running, nor are any VMs (verified by running 'vmrun list' from CLI).\nSo...what to do, what to do.  Any suggestions?\n\nA: Fusion uses lock files to prevent multiple processes from modifying the same files at the same time, as could happen if you tried to run to copies of Fusion (say version 3 and version 4) at once.  When Fusion quit abnormally, as it did when your laptop battery died, it left behind the lock files and you need to clean them up manually.\nSee this support article for how to clean up Fusion lock files.  If that doesn't solve it, do a Spotlight search including system files for files whose names end in .lck and if they look like they belong to Fusion, delete them.\n\nA: sudo pkill vmware\nsudo pkill VMware\nsudo pkill vmnet\n\n", "Q: How many applications can I run simultaneously on a new Macbook Air? With two user accounts running simultaneously with fast user switching, is there any issue in running say 10 apps simultaneously in each account? \nI have a personal setup and one I use for when I'm at work so that I can create two full workspaces that have different accounts/preferences, etc. But I like to be able to fast user switch between the two. In each account I have Mail, iChat, Reeder, Safari, Skype, iCal, iTunes, iWork open all at the same time. I used to do that on my old Macbook, but I would only have one account logged in at a time. Now with my new Macbook Air, it seems so far that it's ok handling all of those apps running at the same time in both accounts. \nCan someone explain to me exactly how it's managing all of that memory and resources and what performance (battery?) issues I might encounter. Is there a generally recommended limit to the number of simultaneous processes for a machine with 4GB of RAM, when those processes are pretty basic?\n\nA: There are no system resources that can meaningful be counted in \"applications\", but some programs hog system resources atrociously, while others use hardly any.\nIf your computer seems 'burdened', then run activity monitor to learn what processes are using the most CPU and RAM, especially processes you aren't actively using.  You should avoid leaving badly behaved processes running continuously.\n", "Q: How do I subscribe to RSS feeds in Safari on a page showing the Reader button? Safari (the desktop variant) shows an RSS button in the address bar for any page with an associated RSS (or Atom) feed. Clicking that button opens the RSS feed in your chosen feed reader application (Safari by default).\nHowever, on most pages the RSS button only appears briefly as the page loads, or not at all. When the page is fully loaded it's replaced by the Reader button. There doesn't seem to be any way to disable the Reader button or otherwise get to the RSS button on such pages - so how do I subscribe to the RSS feed for the page (other than hunting around for an RSS link in the page content or worse, the page's source code)?\n\nA: Click and hold the Reader button, and a menu of available feeds appears.\n\n(Discovered after much Googling at Mac OS X Hints.)\n", "Q: Volume Keys not working with HDMI audio on mac OSX Lion? I have a mac mini 2011 with OSX Lion. And I have connected my monitor (with integrated speakers) through hdmi port. The sound is working fine, but the volume keys on the keyboard don't work. \nWhen I press one of them the volume image appears on the screen but with a prohibited signal.\nIs there a way to fix this and make my keyboard keys change the system volume?\nBy the way, they work very well when I use another audio output device   \n\nA: As SoundFlower is extremely outdated and not actively maintained. I've started looking for a better solution.\nI highly recommend this, works pretty great on my LG monitor:\nhttps://github.com/MonitorControl/MonitorControl\nThis project also supports the default volume/brightness keyboard controls. Instead of using a digital line like SoundFlower, it tries to change the volume of your display itself.\nEdit:\nSince posting this answer, I've become a maintainer of this project, and it's grown quite a bit.\nI would still recommend it to everyone wanting to change volume/brightness on external monitors. Works on both Intel and ARM\n\nA: *\n\n*Install Homebrew:\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\n*Install Cask\nbrew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask\n\n*Install Soundflower:\nbrew cask install soundflower\n\n*Reboot.\n\n*Start soundflowerbed (find it by pressing cmd-space to open spotlight):\n\n\n*Click the Soundflower icon in the top-right and select your output device (You should pick HDMI instead of DisplayPort):\n\n\n*In the sound preferences, pick Soundflower:\n\n\nA: A solution using the free version of Sound Siphon\n\nTo solve both of these issues: \n  Launch the Sound Siphon app. In Sound\n  Siphon’s preferences select your output device as the pass through\n  device. Turn Sound Siphon on.\nSound Siphon processes the audio before it goes to your output device.\n  Now you can use your keyboard to control the volume\"\n\nhttp://staticz.com/add-keyboard-volume-controls/\n\nA: See a solution here for the problem - http://www.vanetta.net/2012/07/enabling-hdmi-audio-controls-on-2011.html\nRequires the free third party app - https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/ but it works perfectly.\n\nA: The audio signal over HDMI is encoded. Encoded audio streams should be normalized to 0 dB. You cannot change this behavior as the audio signal would not be normalized anymore. You can only use the volume controls of your TV set.\nSome programs (like iTunes) have volume control themselves, those can be used to change the volume of that specific program. (Although this goes somewhat against the principle that HDMI audio should be normalized.)\nSee also this discussion on Apple Support Communities (same answer).\n\nA: My solution: Sound Control.\nSoundflower is very old software and does not work well for me. Use sound control to specify output device to your HDMI/DP/Type-C device, and control the master volume (can define short key).\nBonus point: You don't have to buy a license to control only the master volume.\n\nA: if you don't already have them (well, you should! ), install Homebrew and Homebrew Cask.\nThen, install Soundflower and Soundflowerbed:\nbrew cask install soundflower\nbrew cask install soundflowerbed\n\nReboot.\nNow, from the Sound Preference Pane, you can configure your Mac to play sound on the Soundflower virtual audio device. And you can launch SoundflowerBed.app (it will sit in the menu bar) to configure this Soundflower virtual output to play on your external HDMI or DisplayPort interface.\nThis way, macOS will allow you to control the audio volume (from the menu bar and from the keyboard).\n\nA: On Big Sur (or earlier), you can do this:\n\n*\n\n*Install Blackhole or brew install blackhole-2ch\n\n*Install AU Lab\n\n*Configure AU Lab (You'll be using blackhole as a substitute for Soundflower)\n\nThis option also has the benefit of allowing you to setup audio effects, like a system wide EQ and use things like NoAudiophile's speaker corrections and AutoEq's headphone corrections.\nThis worked for me on a monitor that didn't work with MonitorControl\nAlternatively, for $40, you can buy SoundSource.\n", "Q: Why is Keychain behaving erratically? I got my Mac back from a repair shop that recovered my files from a corrupted partition and then reinstalled Snow Leopard.\nWhen I booted it up Keychain complained about my password. I know my old password but it said it was incorrect. I canceled and that logged me in. I went into Keychain Access and tried Preferences > Reset My Default Keychain. It asks for a new password, which I gave, but it responded that it was “incorrect” as well.\nI am somehow able to unlock the login keychain with my original password. I clicked delete, but the message that popped up scared me, talking about deleting references and files or just references. I tried just references. It didn’t seem to do anything.\nI right clicked and went to Change Password. It changes it, it accepted it, but it didn't work for future login attempts.\nI try to change my account password. It won’t accept my original password as old password or the “new” one I tried to set before.\nI ran Keychain First Aid. Here’s the red text:\nUser differs on ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain, should be 501, owner is 502\nPermissions incorrect on ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain, should be -rw-r--r-- , they are -rwxr-xr-x \nOwner not corrected on ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain, reason: The operation couldn’t be completed.

Then Keychain pops up every few minutes to nag me.\nCan anyone explain this?\nEdit: Booted into single-user mode and tried to fix the permissions, and it doesn't nag me anymore, but now my desktop has gone back to the factory default and it says the login Keychain is missing/permission denied, so I still can't do any administrative tasks.\nEdit 2: I can no longer troubleshoot this as I gave up and reinstalled OS X. Much more straightforward than messing around with permissions that were clearly botched beyond repair. Anyway, this should be closed.\n\nA: Sounds like this was due to them creating a new user (502) and naming it the same as the old user, and copying all your old files in.  The problem is that the new user account ID doesn't match the old user ID.  What needed to be done was a chown -R 502 on your whole user directory.  Too bad you started afresh.  Sidenote: Trying to restore in this fashion almost never works well.  Wipe the disk, re-install a good OS, and then restore from a TM or other backup if available.  I've never had a problem using that method, but I've definitely had problems using the method you describe.  Better luck next time.\n\nA: I have had this happen to me as well. What worked for me was just deleting the keychain \"login\". After you delete it just create a new keychain and be sure to name it \"login\". \nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Can I force Safari to always show bookmark names, not webpage titles? I have several bookmarks for finance.yahoo.com. Each bookmark lists a series of stock tickers that I am watching. I gave the bookmark unique names that makes them easy to identify (e.g. \"$-Investments\".)\nIf I go to Safari's location field and start typing \"finance\", there is a popup list with a Bookmarks section, but the bookmarks are listed with the cached webpage title and the URL. What I want to see in the bookmarks section is the bookmark name instead of the cached webpage title. How can I make this happen every time, without having to use drastic measures like private browsing, emptying the cache, or resetting Safari?\n\nA: I have a similar workflow that I've used in Safari and I've used the Edit Name Feature to make it easier to move from one site to another.\nIf I bring up a chart of SSO in Stockcharts.com and create a Bookmark, the Bookmarks Toolbar Menu shows it as SSO - Stockcharts Workbench - Stockcharts.Com.\nThen I \"Show All Bookmarks\", right-click (control click) edit the name SSO - Stockcharts Workbench - Stockcharts.Com to be just SSO.\nThis now appears as SSO on my bookmark toolbar list.  To switch to this bookmark, I can choose it under the Bookmarks menu or Bookmarks Toolbar.  What I usually do is use Cmd L which highlights the address bar, type SSO and Safari displays a short list of History and Bookmarks.  I scroll down to SSO under Bookmarks and hit \"Enter\" for my SSO chart.  This bypasses using the mouse and gets me right to the chart with just a few keystrokes.\nAs another example, I get to Apple with CMD L, AAPL, cursor down to AAPL site I want and hit Enter.\nHere's a screenshot for AAPL with several bookmarked sites that include AAPL.\n\nI like using Cmd L for two reasons.  I can move from one bookmark to another without needing to use my mouse or trackpad.  Plus the shortened SSO Name sits on my Bookmark Toolbar using much less space than if I added it to the Toolbar with the original bookmark title.  \n", "Q: How can I browse the directories of an external drive even when it is not attached?

Please explain what is going on here.\nEDIT: note that when I completely turn off Time Machine (through the GUI), the folder /Volumes/Mobile Backups disappears and in the \"About this mac\" window, around 70 GB is in the \"Other\" area. When I turn on Time Machine again, this number decreases and gets added to backups.  \n\nA: Several things are happening here:\n\n\n*\n\n*It sure looks like there are bugs in the space determination with mobile backups.\n\n*It's hard to tell in Finder since your user may not have permissions to read / calculate file sizes in many.\n\n*Your spotlight database is suspect and might need rebuilding (where much of the data that System Information uses to make those nice colored bar graphs)\n\n\nI would try three things to see if you can get a better view of your data.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off local time machine\n\n*Set all local drives to be private in Spotlight\n\n*Boot into recovery mode and verify the boot volume / repair / back up if needed\n\n*Remove the volumes from Spotlight privacy and wait for the reindexing process to finish\n\n\nYou also might want to look into a tool like WhatSize which can measure folder and file sizes as the administrator (root user). Also, using df and diskutil list in the terminal will help you get a lower level look at actual file system data size summaries. \n\nA: My Macbook was returning 3 petabytes of free space… I do like optimistic thinking, but…\nZapping the Spotlight index with Cocktail did the trick.\n", "Q: Sharing a iPhoto Library between users on the same computer I tried to share my iPhoto library with putting it into my sharing folder.

I'm quite sure that I read, in more than one place, that one of the features of iOS 5 was to be delta updates for apps. However, the massive download that was required for an update to Infinity Blade II (a great example of just the sort of app delta updates would be tremendously useful for) suggests to me that its update was done the old way, by a complete download of the entire new version of the app.\nTo make perfectly clear, I'm asking about when and if we can expect delta updates for iOS apps. Mac programs in the Mac App Store do not interest me. Another thing that might have confused reporting in the run-up to the release of iOS 5 is the fact that over the air updates for iOS itself are delta updates. Could it be that Apple never even promised delta updates for apps, and the press simply got these two things confused?\nEdited to add:\nSince my original question wasn't clear, I'll try again. I know that right now, there are no iOS app delta updates. What I'm curious about:\n\n\n*\n\n*Had Apple ever explicitly told developers or the press that they would be doable in iOS 5?\n\n*If so, does anyone know why it hasn't happened?\n\n*If not, has anyone heard if it's being worked on for the future?\n\n\nA: I believe you mixed the two.\niOS supports delta update, but only for the OS itself. iOS 5.0.1 was a ~40MB update.\nMac OS X supports delta update for the Mac App Store apps.\n\nA: iOS 6 now supports delta app updates.  This is awesome, and makes Real Racing 3 (a 1.1GB app) update in about 30 seconds instead of 20 minutes!\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa1779/_index.html\n\nQ:  How can I reduce the downloaded size of my app update for users\n  that already have the previous version installed?\nA: Starting with iOS 6, the app store will automatically produce an\n  update package for all new versions of apps submitted to the store.\n  This package is optimized for updating an app from one version to\n  another, and contains files that have changed between the prior\n  version of an app and the new version of the app, excluding files that\n  have not changed.\nWhen used optimally, an update package is significantly smaller to\n  download than the full package of the app and the update will install\n  more quickly. Also, in many cases, this mechanism allows updates to\n  large apps to be downloadable over cellular networks where app\n  downloads are subject to a size limit.\nIn addition to new content, the update package contains instructions\n  on how to transform the prior version of the app into the new version\n  of the app. New files will be added, modified files will be replaced\n  with their updated counterpart, and deleted files will be removed as\n  part of this transformation. As far as the developer and user are\n  concerned, this process is entirely transparent and the resulting\n  updated app will be indistinguishable from a full download of the\n  corresponding updated version of their app.\n\nFurther instructions for developers available at the link above.\n", "Q: Remote Assistance/Screen Sharing from Mac OS X to Windows XP analogous to iChat's Screen Sharing To help and teach older relative of mine who is on Windows XP I would like to have solution comparable to iChat's Screen Sharing.\nWhich means I can ask them for sharing their desktop with me (or get invitation from them) and to get full control over their computer with simultaneous audio chat while they can see what is on the screen and take control when they want/need.\nP.S.

There should not be any jailbreaking.\nI wanted something like these:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone SSH clients reviewed: iSSH, pTerm, and TouchTerm\n\n*Three SSH terminal apps for iPhone\nI want to use an online shell.\n\nA: Prompt for iOS\nPrompt allows you to remotely SSH into another machine. Without jailbreaking, there is no way to use Terminal to access your file system. However, I've found that if you do jailbreak your phone and want to use Prompt as a Terminal, you can set it to SSH to server 127.0.0.1 and authenticate with the standard iPhone root credentials. \nRemoter: Remote Desktop (VNC) for iOS\nThis app does basically the same thing just a little differently. By default it allows a VNC connection for screen sharing, but it has different add ons that you can purchase that allow SSH, Telnet, and RDP.\n\nA: I use Rove Mobile Admin Client on my iPhone. It's free, there are no annoying in-app ads, and it comes with an SSH client which I use to connect to machines at work while I'm on the road. Works great. It's quite possible to run a remote emacs editor and send all the control characters you need.\n\nA: vSSH for iPhone and iPad. There is a free lite version. Ad is quite annoying, but functionality and usability are fantastic. \nThere is also OS X version and it's possible to share connections between all these apps via iCloud.\n\nA: While I would recommend Prompt, there is an OK SSH client called zaTelnet. It is free, but I think feature limited (as in, a limited number of characters per session, etc). \nApp Store link for zaTelnet. \n", "Q: What cables can be connected to the Apple 30 Pin Connector?

I bought my AppleTv a couple of weeks ago (Black Friday) got it set up and running just fine.

Try again later.\n\nAll the videos start playing, and play for usually a minute or more but then stop and that message appears. I can get back to the previous screen and hit play again and it plays the content, again for just a minute or so.\nI've noticed it with video podcasts, Netflix streaming and Youtube streams.\nCould this be a problem with the AppleTV or might it be my ISP? Thoughts, solutions appreciated...\n\nA: I fixed mine by just going back to the stv menu and trying to play it again. \nIn my case I was streaming the content from my iPad.\n\nA: For my Apple TV 4K, Buddy's answer worked as well, but my remote has no down arrow. I had to reboot the Apple TV by pressing the MENU button and the TV button together for a couple seconds until the LED flashes and TV went dark.\n\n\nA: I think I have fixed the problem. I unplugged the AppleTV and plugged back in (since I could find no way to reboot via the UI, #fail) and now my programs seem to be playing with no problems.\nAnother odd thing though was that I had to \"reboot\" a couple of times as it failed to fully load the menus the first two times and the remote was completely unresponsive... It starting to sound like I may have a faulty unit...\n\nA: If you hold down the Menu button and the down arrow on the remote for 10 sec until the LED on the front of the Apple TV begins to flash. Let go of the buttons and the Apple TV will do a soft reboot.\nThis has been happening to me several times a week and doing this seems to fix the issue.\n\nA: like all ive seen this error also.\nthe source can be anything from the apple tv not being able to contact the server where the content is located, so anything on your local network preventing access like your router.  Or if you switch tv inputs while a video is loaded and paused, when you come back you may see this error and its due to HDMI content protection DRM crap.\nThere is also a reboot option under settings now so you dont have to unplug the apple TV anymore.\ncurrently i only see this error when trying to send a video via airplay from my iphone when the video is in a format that the apple tv cant understand, usually from an app using the webview and the video is loaded from there instead of safari.\n", "Q: Exchange contacts do not appear in iCloud On my iPad and iPhone I have several email accounts: three Gmail and one Exchange account.

The page needs to be blank.\n\n*Drag the .vcf file into the window under All Contacts. \nThe page will highlight with a blue rectangle when you drag the .vcf onto it. Wait a little bit. (It took about 8 seconds for mine to import. I only have 136 contacts though.)\nOn your iPhone, go to Settings > iCloud and make sure Contacts is listed as ON.\nThe only issue I had with this was the pictures of my contacts did not port over. Not a big deal I guess for how easy it was. Let me know if this helped.\nSource: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1253546\n\nA: complicated...but I got it working...here it goes. You will need:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Outlook 2010 on a PC\n\n*A Gmail account  \n\n*An iCloud account.  \n\n\nTo be able to import Outlook .vcf cards into iCloud, you will not be able to do it directly. You need to export from Outlook, then import to your Google account, then export out of the Google account in the *vCard format (for importing into Apple's Address Book or another application). There you will be able to get all your Outlook contacts, exactly as they are, into your iCloud account. There are some limitations, as Outlook does not let you export several vCards at the same time, and Google does not let you import several vCards at the same time. \nHere are the instructions to get this rolling:\n\n\n*\n\n*On Outlook 2010, go to File>Options>Mail, and in the compose messages section select \"Plain Text\" from the dropdown box, then hit OK. This is very important, for the next step to work.  \n\n*Now go to contact, hit Command ⌘ + A (Ctrl ⌃ + A for Windows users) This will select all your contacts. Then, go up to the ribbon and on the \"Share\" section, where it reads \"Forward Contact\", click on the dropdown and select \"As Business Cards\" (if you don´t do step one, Outlook will crash attempting to create images of the vCards for each contact on an email message).  \n\n*If you did right, now you have a new email window opened, with all your vCards as attachment. Select all the Vcards and copy.  \n\n*Create a folder and save all the vCards in the folder.  \n\n*Time to merge all vCards into a single one, for them to be uploaded into your Gmail account, follow the instructions here.  \n\n*Once you managed to create one single .vcf files with all your contacts (don´t try to open it cause you will see nothing), go to your Gmail account and import them. To do that, on the left upper corner of the screen, 3rd row, you’ll see the word \"Gmail\". Click the dropdown there and select Contacts. Moving along the same row, go to \"More\", click the dropdown and select \"Import Contacts\", then select the .vcf file and voilà, your contacts are now in Gmail.  \n\n*Now we will export the contacts. Select All contacts (if you have more than 100 contacts, you will need to do this in 3 or 4 pieces, selecting no more than 100 contacts to export) , then hit \"More\" and select \"Export Contacts\". Use the last option, *vCard format (for importing into Apple Address Book or another application).\n\n\nThis will give you a VCF files with all the contacts, in a format that iCloud will accept with no issues, then just sync your iOS device, and that is it.\nDo not try to export a CSV file from Outlook to import into Gmail, because it will dump most of the contact info into notes instead of the fields. I hope it works for you all as it worked for me. \n\nA: There will be no automatic syncing between Exchange and iCloud. You can manually import the contacts to iCloud. There are different ways to do this, depending on a lot of factors:\nIf you have Microsoft Outlook with access to the same Exchange account:\n\n\n*\n\n*Export all contacts as vcf (some hints here: Export Outlook )\n\n*Import into iCloud by following second part of this (Macrumors )\nIf you don't have Microsoft Outlook, you can still export them from the iPad into a file, which you can import to iCloud using above link. Try this app (Export contacts) or see if you are able to sync it to your computer using iTunes (I'm however doubting that it would sync from the Exchange account for this purpose).\n\nA: I don't have a google account, nor a windows computer with outlook.\nI am running iOS 9, and my iPhone was linked to my work's Exchange server (2010 - version 14) with all my personal contacts. \nI bought a new Macbook and wanted to link my iMessages on the Macbook to my phones contacts, but I didn't want to link my personal computer to my work's Exchange server.\nSo...these were the steps I took to move my contacts from Exchange to iCloud.\nLog into the Exchange server's OWA web interface (Usually https://your.exchangeserver.com/owa )\nClick on the Contacts on the left side.\nOn the right hand side should be your list of contacts. Select a bunch of them (I had to do it in 3 bunches because it complained when I selected too many). Right click and pick 'Forward as Attachment'. It attached all of them as individual attachments, 1 .vcf each. I sent the email to myself.\nWhen I got all the emails, I saved all the attachments to a directory.\nNow...on the phone, in the Settings App->Mail,Contacts,Calendars I went to my Exchange account and turned off Contact syncing. It told me it would delete all my Exchange contacts on the phone, and when I accepted, it did.\nSo, now I had no contacts.\nOn my MacBook, I logged into iCloud.com and clicked on 'Contacts'.\nFrom the Finder as a test I dragged and dropped a single .vcf file into the 2nd pane from the left (where the list of contacts is). It imported fine. \nBut dragging and dropping more than 1 always gave me an import error (the error message was something like \"bad data in field\"). \nI didn't want to import 188 files, one at a time. I wanted to do them all at once. From reading on the Web, I suspected that iCloud could import more than 1 record per file, so I concatenated them all into 1 file.\nTo do so, I opened a terminal and changed directory to where I saved the .vcf files. Then I ran this:\ncat *.vcf >> all_contacts.vcf\n\nThen i dragged all_contacts.vcf into the iCloud.com contacts list pane, and it imported all 188 perfectly. Even the photos of my contacts.\nOn my phone, I went to Settings App->Mail,Contacts,Calendars then picked the iCloud account. I enabled syncing of Contacts, and they were all there.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: There's a $0.99 app that can transfer your Exchange contacts to iCloud in a matter of seconds.  It's called \"Contact Mover & Account Sync.\"  You can read about it at:\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/contact-mover-account-sync/id582605968?mt=8\n\nA: fwiw, you can set up your contacts on an apple device (iOS10 or above, and MacBook Pro Mojave, at least) to use your Microsoft Exchange account by opening the Contacts app on your iOS or MacBook Pro> Preferences> Accounts> Add account (exchange, yahoo, etc)> let it configure (ie not manual) > sign in to your source account (like ms exchange or yahoo, etc.) and if you deactivate the iCloud account in the Contacts > Accounts window, then you won't have duplicates.  this allows you to use the ms Exchange server across all of your devices and computers rather than iCloud. :) \n", "Q: Is it possible to search mail for strings?

Removing the podcast is not an option as I have 4 years of history from that podcast saved locally and I don't want to lose it.\nI'm a software developer myself, so I figured, I'll just use curl and manually get the updated files, copy them over the originals, restart iTunes, and all will be well. Not so. iTunes is still playing less then a second of the file before stopping again. However, I can hear the start of the actual podcast now, so it's playing the new file, and it has also updated the length of the file (as displayed in the podcast's list of items in iTunes itself) to something I assume is correct, much longer than the 0 seconds it was before.\nThe mp3 files themselves play fine in VLC.

I pressed Cmd+O (where the S would've been) and it worked.\n", "Q: How setup Mail.app IMAP to migrate Mail Server We changed recently our Hosting provider.\nHow can we remove the old IMAP account in Apple Mail without loosing any Mails and have them uploaded to the new server including all IMAP folders?\nThanks,\nAldo\n\nA: You can\n\n\n*\n\n*copy the whole content of the old IMAP account into a local archive\n\n*enable/configure the new IMAP account\n\n*copy the local copy into the new IMAP account\n\n\nYou can probably also do this directly (old IMAP to new IMAP) but I run into IMAP implementations in the past which weren't too stable during batch copying. So keeping a local copy (at least for a short time) is recommended.\nIf a local copy is not possible due to mailbox size, you can alternatively try to copy old IMAP to new iMAP folder by folder. Be sure to verify each step at least visually.\n", "Q: Migrate Data To New SSD Drive Without USB to SATA Cable I just bought a SSD For my MacBook Pro. It is running Lion. I have a time capsule with a full backup, as well as an image of the entire drive I created stored on a network drive. How do I copy everything from the current drive to the new SSD? I don't have any cables, i.e. a USB to SATA, is this possible?\nIs there a way if I install the SSD and boot into a safe mode, and load Disk Utility, and then simply load the image backup from the network drive?\nThanks for the help.\n\nA: I used an external 2.5\" USB case. As @Richard suggested above, I also use Carbon Copy Cloner.\n\nA: Why not just install the news operating system to the SSD and then restore from the time machine backup you have on your time capsule?\nTo install, when i upgraded my system to Lion, if you find the installer file called. Install OS X Lion and right click and view package contents, there will be a file inside called InstallESD. If you restore that image to say a USB pen using disk utility or terminal, you then can boot to that USB pen by holding 'alt' on boot.\nOr why not install the system that come with the machine and upgrade to Lion again. I believe the download allows you to install 3 separate machines. (correct me if im wrong)\n", "Q: How much free storage in a 16GB iPad? No, this isn't a \"who's buried in Grant' tomb\" question.  Rather: How much space for apps, music, etc is available on a fresh-out-of-the-box 16GB iPad?  My 64GB iPad says that its \"capacity\" is 58.12 GB, which suggests that almost 8GB is taken up by disk formatting and the OS.  That wouldn't leave much for other stuff on a 16GB.  I'm providing \"pre-sales tech support\" for a price-sensitive relative; any data out there?  Thanks!\n\nA: On iOS 5 you should expect to have about 13.75 GB for items you choose to store on any 16 GB iOS device. On iOS 4 it was slightly higher - slightly over 14 GB.\n\nA: Storage device manufacturers measure capacity using the decimal system (base 10), so 1 gigabyte (GB) is calculated as exactly 1,000,000,000 bytes. The capacity of the storage media in your Mac, iPad, iPod, iPhone and other Apple hardware is measured using this decimal system. This is detailed on product packaging and online through the statement \"1 GB = 1 billion bytes.\"\nUnderstanding storage capacity in iPad, iPhone, iPod\nWhen you view the storage capacity of your iPod, iPhone, iPad, or other electronic devices within its operating system, the capacity is reported using the the binary system (base 2) of measurement. In binary, 1 GB is calculated as 1,073,741,824 bytes.\nFor example: The way decimal and binary numeral systems measure a GB is what causes a 32 GB storage device to appear as approximately 28 GB when detailed by its operating system, even though the storage device still has 32 billion bytes (not 28 billion bytes), as reported.\nYou can see this difference if you look at how your computer summarizes the capacity of your iPod, iPad, or iPhone’s storage when the device is connected to your computer. You will also see this difference in the About menu on your iPod, iPad, or iPhone. The important point to understand is that the available storage capacity is the same no matter which system (decimal or binary) is used. Nothing is missing.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS2419\n\nA: On iOS 6.0.1, iPad 4, I started with 13.3 GB. It depends on your iCloud sync as well. But as I see, you need at least 2.5 GB of free space which means that you will have a number around 13.5 too.\n", "Q: Trouble with Memtest86 4.0a on 15\" MacBook Pro I have a 15\" MacBook Pro late 2011 (MacBookPro8,2) It has a 2.4Ghz Core i7 CPU and 4GB of stock RAM. I'm trying to run Memtest86 4.0a from boot (Memtest86+ does not work.)\nAfter about 5 seconds into the Memtest86 run the system starts OS X. I can't tell if it reboots because I can't see any POST messages but it does that chime thing (I'm a Mac noob.) So I'm assuming it is. That smells like Memtest86 4.0a is borking because it doesn't support the hardware in my MacBook Pro.\nHas anyone got Memtest86 4.0a working from boot on this hardware? If not what do you guys use to test RAM without loading OS X?\n\nA: An easy way to get memtest running is the Ubuntu install cd which has memtest as a menu entry.\nNote that you previously had to run Boot Camp first to make the system capable of booting Linux or Windows.  I do not know if this is still the case with OS X 10.8.\n\nA: It must work it supports Apple hardware since 2008. Look at this Youtube video. I guess you have already fixed your problem. \n", "Q: Why does running the App Store push email to my iPad? I have noticed that - even with email push turned off, running the App Store on my iPad 2 would push any new mail on the Exchange server to me. This could have been the case previously but it is incredibly apparent now with the way iOS 5 handles notifications.\nIs this happening for anyone else? Is this a bug or is this a feature which I can configure away somewhere?\n\nA: At an educated guess, I would say the following is happening:\nExchange is designed to push - and the exchange server is no doubt pushing to Apple servers - regardless of whether you have push enabled on the iPad or not, it's just how it works. \nWhen you connect to the Apple store, you connect to the Apple notification server (or renew your connection to it) and in doing so pick up any mail that hasn't been collected from the exchange server yet. I would imagine the same would happen with other push notifications as they pass to the Apple server whether they are enabled on your iPad or not. \nWhat would be interesting to test is whether this happens with a conventionally configured Gmail account - which would probably shed more light on what is happening. \n\nA: This sounds like a bug, have you restored the iPad? \nThere is no reason why launching the app store should affect mail. I would restore the device and then see if it continues.\n", "Q: Asking QuickTime Player 7 to play MIDI files through GarageBand By just launching a MIDI file it will play by default using QuickTime Player 7, but the volume is rather low and the sound is far from polished.\nHow can I ask QuickTime player 7 (or any other application) to send the MIDI stream to GarageBand.\nI have already done it from EarMaster to GarageBand and the difference is spectacular, but no option in QuickTime Player lets me select the IAC Driver.\nI am hardly attached to QuickTime Player. If GarageBand will play MIDI files, please mention how.\n\nA: If you have a blank Garage Band song open and you drag a Midi file in and drop it onto the timeline, it will import the tracks.\n", "Q: Is there a real benefit to removing applications from the iOS multitasking bar? Sometimes, if my iOS device (ipad or ipod touch) is acting sketchy or slow, I will bring up the multitasking bar (double-press the home button) and then remove items from that multitasking bar (do a long touch on one until they jiggle, then press the red delete spot on them.)\nI imagine that this is somehow saving memory or freeing up the device somehow.\nBut is that true?  or are all those multitasking icons simple shortcuts, and deleting them has no real effect?\n(bonus side question -- if it does really have no effect, what is a way to free up memory or complexity on the device other than shutting down and restarting?)\n\nA: In a word, No.\nApple didn't want to hand over the responsibility of application and memory management to the user, and personally I'm glad that they made that decision.\nThe purpose of the multitasking bar is to allow users to switch between apps and to quit apps in order to open them afresh (in case of crashes or weird behaviour).\niOS doesn't actually allow 3rd party apps to continually run in the background. There are several methods that Apple have provided to developers which allow a sort of pseudo background tasking functionality.\nLong and short is, iOS is pretty damn good at managing memory usage and will kill applications in situations where RAM is running extremely low to prevent a total OS crash.\nMy advice is, let the OS handle it.\n\nA: Sometimes, I find that an application behaves poorly when going through suspend/resume, and I need to quit the application. For example, sometimes the NPR app for iPad stops being able to play playlist items. So I return to the home screen, bring up the recent apps list, and remove the NPR app from there. Next time I launch it, the problem is gone. (I am about to report this to the developer via the App Store.)\n\nA: I agree that it is useless to stop applications in order to recover memory; however, I have found one case where it was useful : sometimes, iOS Mail is stuck and can't retrieve new messages from the IMAP server; in such cases, restarting Mail solves the issue.\n\nA: I too have found it's a useful trouble shooting technique and have read more than 1 (credible) blog post suggesting quitting all listed apps improves battery life.\n", "Q: Fully displaying volume size info on the desktop No matter which combination of icon size, spacing, font size I use for the desktop Finder view, the info for my drives on my Mac Mini hooked up to my TV (1080p) shows up as:\n999.85 GB, ...06 GB free\ninstead of\n999.85 GB, 152.06 GB free\nI've even made a screenshot:\n\nIs there a fix/hack to display this fully all the time?

Is there any way to connect both devices?\n\nA: Try this from Griffin Technology.  I've never used it myself.\n\nA: Which MacBook do you have? 13\" non-Pro Models from \"Late 2009\" and on support using a standard iPhone headset with microphone in the audio jack. Anything that conforms to that pinout should work fine and give you stereo out and microphone in. (Pro and Air models support the same thing from roughly the same time period, but I didn't check which revision specifically).\nYou can find or build adapters that will take any input and output with 3.5mm jacks and combine them to the one jack format.\nThis is the first Google hit for \"iPhone headset adapter\", I have no idea if it's a good company to deal with, just putting it out as an example of what to look for.\nInstructables also has a guide for building your own, if you're handy with a soldering iron.\n\nA: Cheapest and yet functioning option that I found:\nSyba USB Stereo Adapter\n", "Q: iPhone 2G, iOS 3.1.2 and YouTube doesn't work So, YouTube application doesn't work. What I mean by that is that it won't playback any videos, nor will it log me into the YouTube so I can't see my subscriptions, or my videos/playlists, etc.\nDid Google change something and Apple apparently hadn't made an agreement with them to make sure that older iDevices would continue to work with their services? Or is it something else?\n\nA: It's clear now after all these years of observing how Apple handles support of YouTube and similar services, including their own Home Sharing feature, whether it's iOS or OS X, that sometimes the company is focused only on latest versions of OS or hardware. It's a sad fact of life that they don't support every single device or version of iOS/OS X but you have to give it to them because they do a very good job overall. Most of their product lineup is supported well and it just happens so that I have the first iPhone and the very first iPad that in a way were slightly experimental and very few people apparently use those devices today in 2016... so, no wonder that some features don't work at all, or well 8-6 years after the release of those devices.\nGoogle (YouTube) is also known for changing YouTube in a way that requires applications be rewritten to remain compatible with their API. This affects not only iOS but also OS X apps, as well as programs written for Linux or basically any other OS. That's just how things are but if you run more or less recently purchased device you should be good.\n", "Q: Any Issues Using Non-HFS+ As Data Partition? Boot Camping with a 3rd partition (I know it's non-standard) for data sharing/ease of reinstallations, and possibly to keep applications too… Options are exFAT or NTFS-3G. I went with exFAT originally because it's native and I'd rather not rely on 3rd party drivers for my critical files. However now I'm wondering if I'll run into any issues down the road with regard to permissions, since exFAT doesn't support POSIX ACL—and neither does NTFS; it has its own similar thing, but the advanced [I'm assuming unstable] NTFS-3G add-on can supposedly map between the two. Is that a better bet? If I do ls -al in Terminal on the exFAT drive I get Mac owners, groups, etc., but I don't know where any of those are coming from. What's the best way to go on this?\n\nA: When using a non UNIX file system, the permissions you see are default for all files, unless the filesystem logic (i.e. the driver) contains some \"translation\" from the actual filesystem to those permissions seen by VFS (the filesystem abstraction layer in UNIX and OS X/iOS).\nUsing a non HFS+ filesystem, and non UFS, will lose the permissions, but not just that - you will also not get filesystem notifications when the filesystem is close to full. Some advanced system calls (like exchangedata(2) ) will not work, either. For the most part, however, most apps don't use these features, so you should be ok. Another issue to consider is case sensitivity - HFS+ isn't (though HFSX is). Using a case sensitive fs may lead to weird results where case insensitivity is assumed, and vice versa.\n", "Q: How can I find the size of multiple folders? When I highlight several folders in Finder and do a get info, I get an info window for each folder.  Is there a way to get a single window showing size of all folders highlighted?\n\nA: There are 3 forms of \"Get Info\":\n1) Standard \"Get Info\" achieved through Command+i which can potentially create multiple windows for each item selected.\n2) \"Get Summary Info\" achieved through Command+Control+i which uses a single window to show combined info about the selection:\n \n3) \"Inspector\", like @iskra mentioned, achieved through Command+Option+i, which is similar to 2) except that it updates the info dynamically based on your selection.\n\n\nA: Open a finder window and set the view to list view.\nPress command-J and select \"calculate all sizes\" then click \"use as standard\".\nNow folder sizes will show in your finder.\nI don't think it is possible to show sizes for multiple folders, but this might be a good workaround.\n\nA: cmd+alt/option+i will give you info on multiple highlighed items.\n\nA: Alternatively\n\n*\n\n*open Terminal.app\n\n*cd to the directory 'above' the ones you need the size for\n\n*du -sh FOLDER1 FOLDER2 gives sizes in \"human readable\" format (Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte\nand Petabyte.)\n\n*du -sm FOLDER1 FOLDER2 gives sizes in megabytes\n\n*du -sg FOLDER1 FOLDER2 gives sizes in Gigabytes\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 15 inch (2011) screen has stripes My 15 inch MacBook Pro recently has horizontal stripes on the screen.\nIt looks like this:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaPt6FHJmtg\nIt happens randomly and sometimes it gets worse (flickering with horizontal lines,stripes)\nDoes anyone know what might cause this and how to fix it?\nNo such issue during the past year...it has just started happening since yesterday.\n\nA: Take it back to an Apple Store or send it in for repair - that sounds like faulty hardware, and you'll still be in warrantee so they'll repair or replace completely free. \nIn case they decide to replace it outright (it's fairly new so they may) you'll want to use time machine to snapshot your hard drive for backups. \n\nA: Try holding down Shift + Control and hitting the Eject button. It will make the screen go black for a few seconds, then it will come back, hopefully sans striping.\nThis will usually fix vertical striping on MacBook Pro screen which is caused by a problem with the backlighting; it may help you too even though your problem looks different.\nI saw this video example of vertical striping when I looked at your video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=H62afsEjwZ0&feature=endscreen\n", "Q: Can iTunes Match Sync Only Some Files I'm debating purchasing iTunes Match to sync my music between my desktop, laptop and work computer.  The only issue I have is that my laptop doesn't have enough space to download all the music I have purchased on iTunes.  Is it possible to have it download a subset of my music or does it have to download everything?\nIf it has to download everything it's not worth it to me.  :-)\n\nA: iTunes Match doesn't download anything by default. Once you have your big library uploaded or matched (or both) and the process has finished in your desktop computer, all you need to do is use the same iTunes Match account on your laptop. It will automatically bring all your tracks, playlists and such, but they will be stored in the iCloud servers. You can listen and buy music and such, but they will only be temporarily downloaded/streamed so you can listen them. If there's a particular song/album that you want to have locally stored (in case you don't have connectivity), you can click the \"download\" icon next to each uploaded/matched song and iTunes will automatically start a download process. \nIf you later want to remove the downloaded track(s), you can simply remove and move to trash. There will be a checkbox asking if you also want to remove it from iCloud (and you shouldn't check that unless you want to wipe the track!). \nSo as you can see, you can download your songs, remove them, re-download them as many times as you wish (I think). But if space is your concern, you don't need to download them in order to enjoy your music. I have a Mac Pro with a 90GB library that has been \"matched/uploaded\" and tho I keep the library in the Mac Pro (for backup purposes), my Macbook Air with a 250SSD doesn't have a local library, I just listen from the Cloud. \nBear in mind that when you press play on a non-downloaded track, there's a slight 1-5 sec delay before it starts. If you have a good internet connection, the track is downloaded in 2-5 secs too, so this is not a huge problem. If you're playing an Album from the cloud, iTunes starts downloading the next track before the current ends, so there's no unwanted gap. It comes to my understanding (but I haven't taken a look yet) that these temporarily downloaded tracks eventually go away, but not instantly, for if you replay the same track a few minutes later, it's still there. \nI've come to like Match, it's exactly what I was looking for. Having the ability to \"carry\" my 90GB library when I'm traveling (and where I need Internet connection anyway) without sacrificing 90GB of an already small 256GB drive.\nI am even considering removing some tracks from my Mac Pro (tracks that I don't really listen too much or I don't really care).\nHappy Matching!\n\nA: *\n\n*iTunes Match doesn't \"sync\" all your music, only matches your songs\nwith what's available in iTunes. So if your songs are from artists\nnot currently listed in iTunes, then those songs aren't likely to be\nmatched.\n\n*You decide what and when to download. Once a song is matched (if you\nprefer) you could delete your copy of the song and download the\nmatched song. So you're in control.\n\n\nIf your songs are spread across two or more iTunes Media Folder Locations (because of hard drive space constraints), then you'll have to run iTunes Match twice or more times as AFAIK there is no iTunes preferences that allows more than one iTunes Media Folder Location to be active at the same time. \n", "Q: opendirectoryd taking up 1/4 of the cpu and driving fans crazy on MacBook Air Since a couple of days my 2011 13\" MBA (i5, 1,7Ghz) has a very strange issue which I don't know how to get rid of.\nEvery now and then (sometimes more times a day) a process called opendirectoryd takes up 99-101% of my CPUs. This causes the temperature to go up and after a short while the fans kick in. My MBA is logged in as part of an Active Directory Domain.\nFirst I tried waiting a couple of minutes, but the process didn't stop. Rebooting the machine seems to always fix the problem, but that's not exactly my preferred solution for this problem.\nFor now I stick to force kill the process. I need to repeat this 1-2 times per iteration and then there's a undefined period of time in which I'm safe. \nI'm not sure if it is related to the 10.7.2 update or to something else.\nI found others having a similar problem. In that case it seems to be related to a Livescribe pen. While I have a Livescribe pen (updated to the latest version of the client software) I don't have any suspicious entries in Console.app. \nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Here are the results of my investigation: https://superuser.com/a/426719/135263\n--\nAs mentioned by @juanpablo, this may be caused by symlinks.\nApparently, if a symlink points to /home, autofs or automountd fire and take a lot of CPU to figure out that the place indeed doesn't exist.\nTake a look at /etc/auto_home and /etc/autofs.conf.\nTo see if you're being hit by this particular problem, set\nAUTOMOUNTD_VERBOSE=TRUE\n\noption in autofs.conf, restart automountd\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.automountd\n\nand review the syslog.log (you may use application: Console).

Then run:\nsudo automount -vc\n\n\nA: First thing first, kill -9 <pid> of opendirectoryd probably won't prevent your problem from recurring at next boot up. My guess is your Mac is a managed client (MCX) that need to sync. opendirectoryd in OS X 10.7 requires a local directory node to have a \"users\" and a \"groups\" subdirectory. Try flushing your cache settings as described in http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3540 \n\nA: My issue to high CPU utilization of opendirectoryd was that some robot on the Internet was trying different passwords to break into my computer via ssh.

I cancelled at -100,000 files.   \nSo what's the recommended way to delete huge amounts of files?\n\nA: If you've got:\n\nOperation Not Permitted\n\nafter executing\nsudo rm -rf Backups.backupdb\n\nyou should follow this approach, which is adding bypass before the remove command:\nsudo /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass rm -rfv Backups.backupdb\n\n\nA: If you're comfortable with using Terminal.app (located in Utilities folder), you can try using Unix sudo rm -r <path>/Backups.backupdb command. Note that <path> is the placeholder for the path to the hard drive where your Time Machine backup is located. Please be careful with the path that you pass to this command by ensuring there is no typo. \nThe complete steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal.app \n\n*In one of Terminal.app's window, type sudo rm -R followed by a space\n\n*Use a Finder window to navigate to the Backups.backupdb folder, then\n\n*Drag that folder to the Terminal.app's window of step 2, and press the Return key.\n\n*You may be asked to type the password for the admin account.\n\n*The default prompt will reappear in the Terminal.app's window when the deletion is done.\n\n\nType man rm for documentation. \n\nA: Mattorb's approach works fine.\nsudo /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass rm -rfv Backups.backupdb\nHowever the path for Backups.backupdb can be more easily entered by dragging and dropping the folder into the terminal window after the command rm -rfv[space]\nIt still works if you have put Backups.backupdb in trash - all that is needed is to move it to it's original disc and then apply the above terminal command from there.\nI hope this helps\n\nA: Once terminal is open, I used the following command:\nrm -rfv /path/to/folder/\nThe r means recursive, f means forcefully, v means verbose so you can actually see the files being deleted. \nBe careful when using this command.

I want to change dock view so I downloaded an icontainer file that should contain files to replace some in /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Resources...\nBut how to extract files from icontainer files?   \n\nA: Have you tried out LiteIcon? It should be able to open iContainer format packages, and it is a free alternative to CandyBar.\n\nA: You need specific software to open .icontainer files, e.g. CandyBar.\n\nTo use an iContainer, simply double-click it in the Finder. If it is not already running, CandyBar will launch and automatically create a new collection in your icon library. You can also import iContainers by simply dragging and dropping the iContainer directly into CandyBar's List Pane. If you would like to view the contents of an iContainer before importing it into CandyBar, and you are running Mac OS X 10.5 or later, simply select the iContainer in the Finder and press the spacebar.

I've recently seen third-party apps like Smultron and iA Writer mentioning in their Mac App Store descriptions that they support iCloud syncing.\nAre the files saved to iCloud via these apps accessible from icloud.com? How do they appear? Are they downloadable to e.g. a PC for which the app that saved the file is unavailable?\nI'm asking whether or not I am able to access the files with my credentials from (any) web-terminal, all foil hats aside.\n\nA: You cannot access individual files on iCloud other than the ones made with the iWork suite and that are available on the iWork section of the icloud.com website.\nWhen introducing iCloud, Steve Jobs mentioned that Apple did not think of this service as a big folder in the cloud--a direct contrast with Dropbox. I wrote about this before the launch of iCloud on this Ask Different answer. In short, iCloud is meant to be app-centric. \nI would not be surprised if the iWork section of the icloud.com website went away once native iCloud support is added to Keynote, Numbers and Pages. Like it or not, this makes business sense, as it encourages app purchasing. \nHope this helps. \n\nA: The answer is no.  iCloud does not offer access to the files from the website.\n\nA: iCloud will only let you access iWork Documents, Mail, Calendars, Contacts and the Find my iPhone app.\nYou cannot even access some of the data created on Apple apps on iCloud such as Notes, Photo Stream, or music and video, let alone other 3rd party apps.\n\nA: Yes theoretically, apparently iCloud is based on a JavaScript web framework called SproutCore, meaning you could access them directly by using a greasemonkey script that modified iCloud's web interface.\niCloud users should be aware that their data is not end-to-end encrypted, meaning Apple employees, data centers with whom they contract, law enforcement, and hackers could all potentially obtain plaintext copies of any data stored in iCloud. \nThere are other cloud storage providers like Wuala and SpiderOak who encrypt everything from your own machine.  DropBox does not encrypt your data. \n", "Q: Can I set up domain filtering on an Airport Extreme? I'm wondering if it is possible to set up domain filtering on an Airport Extreme based home network. Specifically, I'd like to block just rad.msn.com, and I need to do that at the network level.\n\nA: Easiest way I know is to use a service like OpenDNS. You set up the Airport to send all DNS requests to OpenDNS and use their filtering (which can be quite sophisticated) to do the job of blocking or whitelisting web addresses. Of course you need to be able to protect the DNS settings on the Airport, but this is doable.\nI have it set up for general filtering and monitoring on my home network which has more than 5 computers and more than a dozen wireless handhelds all served from an Airport Extreme.\nCheck it out at http://www.opendns.com/\n\nA: Airport hardware doesn't have this sort of feature but you could easily accomplish this by running your own DNS on a computer or outsourcing the issue to a provider.\nI believe you could also rely on an inexpensive router that did have this feature (or one where open source software was readily available) to run your DNS and let the AirPort handle the rest of the tasks on the network.\n", "Q: iMessage truncating messaging history A coworker of mine has recently noticed that for any person with whom he has a long SMS history, and with whom iMessage routing has started, the messaging logs with that person are now being truncated. He can only hit the \"load more messages\" button five times before  it hits the apparent end of the logs. Is anyone else noticing this? No one with whom I share that much history has upgraded to iMessage yet.\nI'm a bit worried, because my girlfriend will be upgrading to iOS 5 soon, but we both like the fact that we can scroll all the way back to before we were dating, and sometimes do so just to laugh at the random conversations we've had. We're talking about thousands of texts over two years, and I really hope the default isn't to clear that.\n\nA: Prior to iOS 5, I used PhoneView for this. You can also try iExplorer.\nThey probably still work, I just haven't tried recently.\n\nA: I don't have any solution for you except to take screenshots of your older conversations and put them in an album in your photos app. Do this by pressing the home and sleep button simultaneously (this will capture what is currently on your screen), then they will be on your photos app. To make a new album, go to albums in the photos app, then tap \"Edit\" in the top right corner, and subsequently tap \"New Album\" in the top left corner, and put all the photos in it that you'd like. Good Luck!\n", "Q: Chax with Lion: downgrading iChat to 5.0.3? I wonder if this could allow us to have Chax functionality on Lion.\nI've got iChat 5.0.3 from a Snow Leopard install: the next step would be to install Chax over it.\nThe thing is that the Chax installer doesn't allow it (Snow Leopard only).\nHow can one modify the installer so that it runs on Lion?\n\nA: Why you need Chax, if for strict HTML tags in AIM account\nYou can change option in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.AIM.plist\nsearch option \"ForceICQPlainText\" change to YES\nsave and set ReadOnly :)\n\nA: Even if you could install it, it won't work on 10.7.  \nI used to deploy Chax as part of my default build - the auto-accept file transfers from local Bonjour users was worth it - but it hasn't been updated in some time, and Apple is moving toward the new Messages app and away from iChat.  (Leave them feedback about how much of a regression AirDrop was, compared to iChat.)\n", "Q: What is the root cause of famous iPhone 4s battery draining issue? Even with latest iOS 5.0.1 some 4s users do encounter huge battery drains (1-2%/minute) even when they are doing nothing with the phone.\nIs it a hardware or a software issue? Should I get a refund?\nUpdate: The phone was bought 3 days ago from Apple Store in London, UK.\nLast night when the phone battery went to 10% the phone just shut down automatically, like other were doing when the battery was reaching 2%.\nAlso, I observed that the percent of battery discharge was not linear, meaning that sometimes I observed the batter level going down with 5-8% at a time (while using the Phone). If I remember well from the other iPhones I had, the battery discharge in percentage should be smooth.\n\nA: If it's convenient, get a Genius Bar appointment and take it to an Apple store. I have heard that further software updates to correct battery drain problems will eventually be released. However, you have every right to be unsatisfied with the product in the condition it is in right now.\n\nA: If you are losing 1-2% of battery charge every minute while in standby you should bring the device to the apple store, or wherever you bought it.\n The battery might just be broken. \nThe battery issues that some people had (or still have) with their iPhone4S are reported as a battery loss of 10 to 15 percent an hour.\nWith a rate of 1-2% per minute your battery loses it's charge 4 to 8 times faster. \n\nA: The cause of batteries draining is physics and chemistry. \nCPU use drains the battery, so all you have to do is figure why the CPU won't sleep and you will have weeks of standby life.\nI had an iPhone 4 last in standby for over 5 weeks (on a bet) and the battery in that phone is well over 18 months old at this point.\nHere is the low battery log showing how long one charge of the battery lasted when you isolate the device and don't run apps on the CPU.\nIncident Identifier: 32B64787-774B-44E2-9362-55E0DFA34419\nCrashReporter Key:   f51c8deeb5a5044afeb4c9a6b09528b7e38b0fa1\nDate:                2013-03-13 00:52:15 -0500\nOS Version:          iPhone OS 6.0.1 (10A523)\n\nMobileMail: com.apple.persistentconnection[MobileMail,95,MailAutoFetch-connectionmanager(0x1e57e290)]   NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 00:00:00\ndataaccessd: com.apple.persistentconnection[dataaccessd,79,6E6ACD65-0112-4B16-8439-90B5335A8511-connectionman...]   NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 00:00:00\ndataaccessd: com.apple.persistentconnection[dataaccessd,79,3721C174-0131-433C-A9C4-72A7AD586BDF-connectionman...]   NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 00:00:00\ndataaccessd: com.apple.persistentconnection[dataaccessd,79,6E6ACD65-0112-4B16-8439-90B5335A8511-connectionman...]   NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 00:00:00\ndataaccessd: com.apple.persistentconnection[dataaccessd,79,3721C174-0131-433C-A9C4-72A7AD586BDF-connectionman...]   NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 00:00:00\ndataaccessd: com.apple.persistentconnection[dataaccessd,79,3721C174-0131-433C-A9C4-72A7AD586BDF-connectionman...]   NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 00:00:00\ndataaccessd: com.apple.persistentconnection[dataaccessd,79,88C57836-D9E4-4B38-B195-A357D3D1C2DB-connectionman...]   NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 00:00:00\ndataaccessd: com.apple.persistentconnection[dataaccessd,79,88C57836-D9E4-4B38-B195-A357D3D1C2DB-connectionman...]   NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 00:00:00\n\nHardware Model: N90AP\nAwake Time: 13:25:04 (48304)\nStandby Time: 842:08:47 (3031727)\nPartial Charge: 0\nCapacity: 1\nVoltage: 3649 mV\n\n", "Q: how can i set up mamp or web sharing to show clients php application remotely? I'm currently using mamp instead of web sharing and I'm trying to figure out the best approach to share php and mysql web application that I'm working on to clients. What is the best way to do this?\n\nA: I personally prefer using Web Sharing and installing only MySQL Server, just to stick with the  Mac OS X Apache setup.\nWeb sharing has support for PHP, all you need to do is remove the comment (#) from the following line of the file /etc/apache2/httpd.conf:\n#LoadModule php5_module      libexec/apache2/libphp5.\n\nSo it becomes:\nLoadModule php5_module      libexec/apache2/libphp5.so\n\nThe PHP module includes MySQL support, so you just need to install the MySQL Server, turn it on and then you are ready to go.\nAfter turning Web Sharing on, put your .php files inside your personal Site folder, and access it on your browser using the address informed on the Web Sharing activation screen, inside Settings.\n", "Q: How do I use ipfw to allow LAN access but deny Internet access? How can I use ipfw (or another tool, if one is available) to allow unlimited access between computers on my LAN, but not allow access to the Internet?\n(The IPs on my local LAN are 192.168.0.xxx)\n\nA: Has been a while since I've used ipfw but running the following commands on all relevant computers should do the trick:\n sudo ipfw -f flush\n sudo ipfw add allow tcp from me to 192.168.0.0/24\n sudo ipfw add allow ip from me to 192.168.0.0/24\n sudo ipfw add deny tcp from me to any\n sudo ipfw add deny ip from me to any\n\nTo disable just run sudo ipfw flush again\n\nA: The crudest way I can think of to do this, assuming your network is based on static IPs, is to just not populate the \"Default Gateway\" IP in the network configuration.\nIf you are on a DHCP network, you could change the DHCP server configuration, but that would break the internet access of all computers on the LAN, not just some of them.\n\nA: As I was looking for an answer to this, I found another way to do it which does not use ipfw. I'll mention it here in case anyone else is looking for a similar answer later.\nThe other way to do this is to set the DNS servers to 0.0.0.0.\nThis can accomplished on the command line using networksetup like this:\nnetworksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 0.0.0.0\nIf you have an Ethernet connection, you will want to use \nnetworksetup -setdnsservers Ethernet 0.0.0.0\nTo revert this change, I was able to use 'empty' instead of '0.0.0.0'\nnetworksetup -setdnsservers Ethernet empty\nbut, depending on your network setup, you may need to specify the actual IP address of your DNS servers instead of using empty.\nI still think ipfw is a better tool for the job, but I mention this just in case someone prefers it.\nThe reason this works for allowing access to other computers on my LAN is that I can access them using hostname.local. instead. For example, the hostname for my MacBook Air is 'air' so I can use ssh air.local. to connect to it, even without DNS servers.\n\nA: you can use ipfw to block all traffic to port 80 which is http. You will need to check if you also need to block other ports e.g. 443, 110, 993 etc\nFrom the comment below, did you want to have http access between machines on your network?\nIf so just do above and then add the exception to allow http to machines on your ip range. e.g. /24 if thats what your network is.\n", "Q: How to know what packages are available with (home)brew? I am new to Mac coming from Ubuntu Linux background. How do I find out what packages are available for Homebrew? With Ubuntu I could search packages.ubuntu.com for example, or Google since its using apt\n\nA: brew search lists all available formula (aka packages), requires you to install brew first of course.\nAdditionally, if you want to get further information about that package before installing it brew info <package name> will list relevant information like version number, dependencies etc.\n\nA: There is a cool website where you can search for the packages and it will list the necessary command to install the stuff.\nBrewInstall is the website.\nSuppose you want to install wget but don't know the exact name of the package, search the it on https://brewinstall.org it will show you the necessary commands to install it.\nHere is how the commands looks like after searching the package:\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\nbrew install wget\n\n\nA: If you don't want to install Homebrew first (in order to see all the publicly available packages with brew search as patrix answered), you could browse the formulas on GitHub to see which packages are available — and how they will be installed.\nNote: GitHub lists only the first 1000 files from a directory; which is far less than the number of Homebrew Formulae (3111 and counting). You can search for a known / partially known filename with file finder (or press t when at directory listing).\n\nA: There is, of course, the online package (a.k.a. formula) browser on Homebrew’s own website: formulae.brew.sh. You can find formulae (formulas on the street), casks, and analytics data.\n", "Q: Safari v5.1.2 crashes frequently I've noticed an enormous number of Safari crashes since switching to Mac OS X Lion, especially the new \"reload all windows\" crashes that leave Safari slow and unstable.  Any tips for handling those more gracefully?\nThere are admittedly many crashes attributable directly to Flash.  I'm happily minimizing my Flash exposure using ClickToFlash.  Any other suggestions?  Anyone seen a plugin that relaunches pages in another browser?\nThere are crashes that I cannot attribute to Flash, like this page.  Any idea what's wrong?\n\nA: I use Lion but with chrome.\nIf i have 10 tabs or pages open and press cmd + Q to quit chrome, when i open the app back up all my tabs are still there.\nPlus according to the new press release, chrome is supposed to be the fastest and most secure browser.\n", "Q: How can I adjust additional cinema display screen's brightness? I have an iMac27 run Lion, now I buy a cinema display 27, but at display setting only main screen have brightness adjust controller. And use keyboard to adjust screen brightness also only change main screen.\n\n\nA: I search and search, finally find this article https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2649213?start=0&tstart=0 .\nGilletty said that:\n\nI was having the same issue on my MacBook Pro. Here is what I did to resolve it:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Ensure lid of laptop is open\n  \n*Plug in power, mini-display, AND USB from the Cinema Display into MBP\n  \n*Restart computer (*this was the key step for me)\n  \n*When computer comes back up, launch System Preferences > Displays and you should now see the brightness option that was once hidden!\n  \n\nSo I plug cinema display usb to iMac27, and reopen display setting, now cinema display has it own brightness controller.\nlik this: \n\nA: It's way simpler than that guys. The brightness on the display is controlled by simply pressing:\nControl+F1 OR Control+F2 to adjust brightness on your secondary screen (the one without the menubar).\nF1 and F2 to adjust brighness on your main screen (the one on which the menubar is located).\nIf you have adjusted settings in System Preferences for the Function Keys to behave as standard Function keys, you will need to hold the Fn key in addition to each combination too.\nIf your Cinema display has a USB cable (older models), you will need to plug it in.\n\nA: None of the approaches work for my Cinema LED Display 24 inch. Later I found the acdcontrol software from Github. It could only be installed in the Linux machine. You may encounter a situation that the Product ID (PID) of your monitor is not listed as in the file acdcontrol.cpp. (There are more than one version of a specific monitor model.) You have to modify the Product ID in the acdcontro.cpp to your monitors' which you can find by using \"acdcontrol /dev/usb/* --detect\", according to the manual. And then, compile the program with \"make\". Good luck.\n\nA: It now works when I:\n\n*\n\n*Plug in the USB (if yours still has one)\n\n*Use DisplayBuddy to control the brightness (use the Apple Display Control in DisplayBuddy)\n\n\nA: I use Shades. This will solve your problem. I just hope it runs on Lion too.\n", "Q: How do I backup my complete iTunes library (to new a PC)? I am currently using XP on my laptop, which has the iTunes library. \nI use it to sync my iPod/iPad.\nI am planning to buy a new laptop (Windows 7). How do I make the transition seamless to the new iTunes library switch ?\ni.e. I should get all the Music/Movies/Apps/Photos,etc on my new Win 7 laptop seamlessly.\n\nA: Apple has a support document for this: iTunes: How to move your music to a new computer. It also covers things like de-authorizing your old computer from the iTunes Store etc.\n", "Q: Annoying Text Glow I've hooked up my new Mac Mini to my 47\" LG tv with an HDMI cable. Everything works fine, however there's one problem: I get this weird white glow around text (especially \"os x native text\") like this:\n\nI set the output to 720p (the problem is even worse at 1080p).\nDoes anyone know how to fix this?\nThanks!\n\nA: Check if your TV has a “sharpness” setting, and if so turn it all the way down. “Sharpness” is an image filter which can improve the appearance of weak analog signals or rescaled video, but it would produce the kind of bad result you are seeing.\n\nA: For future readers: at least on Samsung TVs, you should try switching the display resolution and framerate to exactly what the TV supports. I.E. if the TV's native framerate is 60 fps then don't set the output to 50 fps in PAL mode but to 60 fps in NTSC.\nAlternatively, set the framerate to half of what the TV supports, i.e. 30 fps for a 60 fps TV. This can be especially effective when using a graphics card that doesn't fully meet the requirements of the monitor.\nSolved the problem completely for me, no need to adjust the sharpness.\n\nA: Just got rid of the problem. I have got Philips 43PUS6501 and NVidia GT 730 2GB DDR5, both running on 4k/UHD. Everything was OK, except some yellow glow around text on white background (Clear Type turned off).\nIt's because the nVidia to run on 60Hz, forces output to CROMA 4:2:0, and that greatly impacts text sharpness. Lack of color depth can lead to muddy text on certain backgrounds. Switching to 30Hz on old HDMI cable turns down the amount of data that is sent over the cable by half. Remember, that running 4K/UHD@60Hz at 4:4:4 uses over 12Gbits of transfer, and the old HDMI cables run max 10.1Gbit.\nThe problem is that I have some old HDMI cable, it's v.1.4, but now the HDMI V.2.0 Cable is on it's way. :) Till then I set refresh rate in nVidia Control Panel from 60Hz to 30 Hz, and the glow is gone.\n", "Q: iOs is not updating on my iPod Touch - how can I fix it? I have an iPod touch (8gb) which currently has iOS 4.2.1.  I thought the latest version was 4.3, but it's not upgrading.  When I go to iTunes, I click on 'Check for update' and it says I have the latest version.\nAm I doing something wrong, or is the new version just not available for my iPod?\n\nA: iOS 4.2.1 is the latest available version for 2G iPod Touches.\n", "Q: .app extension in Spotlight or Alfred I would like to have all applications names displayed without the .app extension in Spotlight or Alfred. Reeder for example is listed as \"Reeder\", whereas Sparrow is listed as \"Sparrow.app\".\nWhich setting determines whether the file extension is visible or not in applications like Spotlight and Alfred? \n\nA: I believe that unless you have \"Show all filename extensions\" checked in Finder's Preferences, the .app extension is hidden by default. If you were to look at Sparrow in Finder, do you see the .app? If so, open the Get Info window for it (Cmd+i while highlighted) and make sure \"Hide extension\" is checked. You would have to check each app that is showing its extension manually.\nAnother thing is that if you have more than one of the app, I think it will always show the extension in Spotlight.\nIf none of that works, you can always try rebuilding your Spotlight index: $ sudo mdutil -E /\n", "Q: 27\" iMac Hangs On Reboot I've got a 27\" iMac 2.93Ghuz Intel Core i7 running 10.7.2. \nAnytime I reboot (like for some software updates), it gets stuck at the gray startup screen (no Apple logo). If I press and hold the power, turn it off, then turn it on, it boots as normal.\nAny idea why a cold startup works but a warm reboot always hangs? Any idea how to diagnose it?\n\nA: Try a verbose boot and see if the text output during the boot sequence provides any clues.\n\nA: Actually, looks like it was a disk problem of some sort. Ran disk utiity and did \"Verify Disk.\" It said it was in need or repair.\nI rebooted and went into the Recovery Mode (holding Cmd-R at boot). \nOpened disk utility, selected \"Repair Disk\" and it repaired the boot drive.\nSeems to be better now. Whew!\n", "Q: Apache permissions I'm trying to get LAMP working on OSx Lion and am having a little trouble.\nHave Apache, MySQL, and PHP set up and working just fine. Have turned on \"Website\" under sharing in Settings. Removed the original ~/user_name/Sites folder and created a symbolic link of Sites to a directory withint ~/user_name.\nNow when I try to run http://localhost/~user_name I get:\n\nForbidden You don't have permission to access /~user_name on this\n  server.\n\nWhere and how do I change these permissions?\n\nA: When accessing websites on your \"localhost\", there are several permissions which are required.  The localhost content may be in your Sites directory, in which case, these commands may help prevent any \"Forbidden\" messages.\nEnsure the Users directory allows read directory access:\ncd /\nsudo chmod -v 755 Users\n\nEnsure the username directory allows read directory access:\ncd Users\nsudo chmod -v 755 username\n\nEnsure your Sites directory allows read directory access:\ncd ~\nchmod -v 755 Sites\n\nEvery subdirectory of Sites needs read access:\ncd ~/Sites\nfind ~/Sites -type d -print -exec chmod 755 {} \\;\n\nEvery file in Sites and subdirectories needs read access:\ncd ~/Sites\nfing ~/Sites -type f -print -exec chmod 644 {} \\;\n\nApache uses the _www group so, to give Apache full access to everything in the  Sites directory, set the extended attributes with this:\nchmod -R +a \"group:_www allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\" ~/Sites\n\n\nA: Assuming few people ever use OS X in a production environment, it is nice to let apache do whatever it wants with the document root. You can do this with the \"inheritance\" feature of ACL's:\nsudo chmod -R +a \"group:_www allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\" /Library/WebServer/Documents/\n\nThe above command will give the default apache group full read/write access to everything in the default document root and apply \"inheritance\" flags so any new files/directories created will also be writable by apache, even if apache did not create them.\nI also like to run this command:\nsudo chmod -R +a \"group:staff allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\" /Library/WebServer/Documents/\n\nWhich will give \"staff\" users (basically that means all \"real\" users) full access to everything, even files created by apache.\n\nA: You could use chmod to set the permissions on the folder where your site is. Make sure the user Apache is running as may read anything in that folder. \n\n\n*\n\n*open Terminal\n\n*cd /path/to/website\n\n*chmod -r 644 .\nThat should do it. Be aware that this will make your php source files readable to anyone.\n"]
