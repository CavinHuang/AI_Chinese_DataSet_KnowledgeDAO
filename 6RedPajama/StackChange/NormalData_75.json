["Q: Growing black portion on the screen of 2017 MacBook Pro. What could be the cause? I bought my MBP 13\" 2017 (without TouchBar) in late 2018. So far, so good, but after I started using it by plugging in an LG 23\" monitor (as a second display), a black pixel stripe started showing up at the bottom of the screen on the MBP Retina display (even with when unplugged to the LG monitor) and its grown larger ever since. The Mac is out of warranty, so the only way would be to replace the entire screen assembly. Would this solve this issue? I'm guessing that using a MBP that doesn't have a graphics card with a second monitor is not a good idea...\n\n\nA: That definitely looks like a screen (LCD) issue.  Whether  it's on the MacBook or it's the LG, the screen is damaged and must be replaced. However, I'm assuming it's the screen on your Mac...\n\nThe Mac is out of warranty, so the only way would be to replace the entire screen assembly.\n\nYes.  You would be correct; the only way would be to replace the screen assembly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Macbook Pro screen display problems\n\n*Part of display not working, changing display region for macbook pro\n\nI'm guessing that using a MBP that doesn't have a graphics card with a second monitor is not a good idea\n\nConnecting an external monitor to a laptop (not limited to Macs as PCs use the same Intel processors) that has a port specifically to do that wouldn't cause any damage whatsoever to your laptop.  \nDamage happens and it could be from any number of reasons - a manufacturing defect to physical impact with something.  But most definitely, it's not because you connected an external LCD to your Mac.\n", "Q: My Mac only boots to internet recovery and doesnt install MacOs I have a MacBook Pro Early 2011 and I had it with High Sierra OS, as I'm going to sell it I tried to revert to factory settings via recovery... the thing is that it shows an error and didn't install it.\nI was touching stuff in Terminal following some guides I found online and I made things worse, the thing is that now the Mac only boots to Internet recovery, and when i try to install macOS Lion (the only option I have in recovery) it shows an error and doesn't download.\nI tried to make an bootable USB from Windows with Sierra but the Mac doesn't see it (I used Transmac because i don't have access to another Mac to make it from there).\nThe other thing that I don't understand is that when I use Disk Utility to erase the disk it doesn't show \"HFS Extended Journaled\", just \"macOS Plus Case Sensitive, Encrypted\", etc.\nI'm truly desperate, I don't know what to do.\n\nA: i managed to get it back up, i downloaded mac os lion 10.7.5 and i used transmac software to make a bootable USB drive with lion 10.7.5.dmg inside from my Windows 10 machine.\nSteps (on windows 10):\n1- get MacOS Lion (in my case) 10.7.5 (not older, because if its older you wont be abble to update it to Sierra)\n2- get transmac trial software (15 day trial)\n3- open transmac as administrator\n4- plug in USB drive (8GB or more)\n5- on transmac locate the USB drive, click right mouse button and click \"format disk for mac\"\n6-click \"yes\"\n7-when it finishes formatting, click right mouse button again on the USB drive and click \"restore with disk image\"\n8- search and select the Macos Lion.dmg file\n9- click \"yes\" and wait until it finishes (it may take a while)\nwhen i booted from the mac with the USB drive (push the power button on the mac and righ after push \"cmd\") it gave me another error and refused to install... after a lot of searching i found that reseting NVRAM may help, so it did (turn on the mac holding option (alt)+cmd+P+R), and after the long install process i was on MacOS Lion, and from there i updated to Sierra, and after that High Sierra.  \nThanks to all for trying to help me and i hope my experience can help someone in the future.\nSorry for my english\n\nA: You won't be able to install anything except Catilina from Apple servers. \nYour Mac 2011 does not come with a bootable install CD either.\nYou might find on the market old universal install CD for Mac OS X Lion.  It is really old now and nearly useless.\nIf your machine is not compatible with Catilina you need to clone another startup disk with whatever version it has.  El Capitan is still good.\nDon't you have a backup?\n", "Q: How do I make a FaceTime call in macOS for contacts marked, \"Siri Found in Apps\"? I'd like to make a FaceTime call. To do this, I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open FaceTime\n\n*Type the name of my contact\n\n*Select the contact from the dropdown under the section, \"Siri Found in Apps\"\n\n\nHowever, when I click either the green \"Audio\" or \"Video\" buttons, nothing happens. The buttons are not disabled. The buttons depress but have no effect.\n\nHow do I make a call at this point? Why don't the buttons do anything? If the action is not succeeding because of an error, where is the error reported? No error dialogs appear on the screen.\nThis only happens for me for contacts marked, \"Siri Found in Apps\". The others work fine. Both the \"Audio\" and \"Video\" buttons make an audio and video call respectively. Once I add the email address (the same email address Siri found) to the contact card manually in the Contacts app, then the green buttons actually make a call.\n\n\nSystem Specifications\n\n\nA: This is likely a bug.\nAs long as there’s a phone number available, you should be able to make a call.  If this is working everywhere as you indicate except via Siri, then it’s a bug.  The best course of action is to report it to Apple: https://apple.com/feedback\n\nA: The buttons determine which type of message you wish to use. Clicking on Video should bring up a list of video calls you have made. Then you can double click on that call to repeat it. If you have made no calls the list will be empty. In that case, put a contact name or phone number in the search box. A list item will appear and double click on it to initiate call...\n", "Q: Is there a way in MacOS to view filesystem details, including cluster size, for an already created exFAT partition?

Is that possible?\nWhat are the requirements to use an iMac as a second screen?\n\nA: No.  You cannot do this.  The 2019 iMac is not supported for Target Display Mode.\nThis is an attempt to write a canonical QA for this issue, as per the Meta post:  Where is the list of canonical questions stored for Ask Different? I expect it to be periodically edited with the goal of becoming a comprehensive information resource.\n\nWhich iMac Models Support Target Display Mode?\n\n*\n\n*General Rule of Thumb:  If it's after 2014, Target Display Mode isn't supported.\n\n\n*27 inch iMacs from 2009 - 2010 support TDM via Thunderbolt or mini DisplayPort (mDP)\n\n\n*All iMacs (21 inch and 27 inch) from 2011 through mid 2014 support TDM via Thunderbolt only.\n\n\n*Retina iMacs from late 2014 and on do not support TDM at all.\n\nWhich Mac models can you use as a source?\nAll Mac models through 2019 that meet the above requirements can use Target Display Mode.  Currently, 2020 Macs will not connect (i.e. 2020 MacBook Pro running Catalina), but a 2019 MacBook Pro also running Catalina works fine.\nWhat version of macOS is required?\n\n*\n\n*On the Target iMac, it must be running High Sierra or earlier.\n\n*TDM is not supported on any iMac running Mojave or later.\n\n*It doesn't matter what version of macOS you're using on your source computer\n\nCan I use my iMac as a Target Display for a PC?\nYes! As long as the target Mac meets the above requirements and the PC has the proper port;  Thunderbolt or mDP.

It looks like it is pressing some buttons on its own. I recorded a small video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxKqdcbo4M\nI have no idea what triggers this... Tried to close all apps and restarted the laptop several times but it didn't help.\nAny ideas how to fix it?\n\nA: It's a capacitive screen much like the touch screens on cell phones.\nThe first thing to do is rule out 3rd party apps/software/drivers that could be causing it.  Boot into Safe Mode (Hold ⇧ Shift\n while booting).  If the problem stops, then it's a 3rd party app. Start investigating things like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login items (System Settings → Users & Groups → Login Items).  Disable each one.  See if the problem goes away.  Yes?  Re-enable each one individually and test/observe if the problem comes back.  Repeat until you've found the item causing the problem.\n\n*Issue the command sudo launchctl list | grep -v apple.  This will list any LaunchAgents or LaunchDameons that are running excluding anything that has \"apple\" in the name (i.e. com.apple.coreduetd) which are native Apple daemons.\n\n*Create another User account and see if the problem exists there.  If so, it's definitely system wide.\nYou can also try resetting the Touchbar by killing it's processes:\n    $ pkill \"Touch Bar agent\";\n    $ killall \"ControlStrip\";\n\nIf the problem returns, it's definitely hardware.\nHowever, from experience, it's most likely it's due to a physical problem with the touch screen itself.  Unfortunately, it means it has to be replaced.\n", "Q: Folding@Home project killing CPU Three to four weeks ago I read an article which was talking about the project Folding@Home which helps researchers  find a cure for the CoVid-19.\nSince then my Mac has been pretty noisy, although the idea was to run the software when I was not working on my Mac. Today I noticed that despite not having so much running on the Mac it is noisy and also kind of hot underneath.\nIn the iStat, i found out that the FAHclient was taking the most of the CPU power (even when not running it).  I  uninstalled the software and its client is still running in the background.\nI also terminated the process related to it in the terminal:\n\nps aux | grep fah\nkill the pid\n\n\nHow can I uninstall it completely as it's not letting me concentrate since a while.\n\nA: If you don't deselect the Uninstaller in the installer app, the Folding@home folder also contains an uninstaller.pkg:\n\nIf the Uninstall Folding@home.pkg is missing in your environment simply download the installer and install Folding@Home again. Then use the pkg to uninstall everything properly.\n\nA: Well, yes, this is expected behavior.  \nYou're \"loaning\" out unused CPU cycles (or processing power, horsepower, or whatever you want to call it) to someone else to do calculations.  It's going to consume what you allow it to.\nThe fans coming on is only natural, the more you tax your CPU, the hotter it runs, necessitating the fans coming on.\n\nI uninstalled the software and its client is still running in the background. \n\nThen it's not fully uninstalled.  The client is still running, means it's still doing it's thing.\nTo uninstall an app, I suggest using App Cleaner.  It's \"donation-ware\" meaning it's free and the dev asks for a small donation to support his work.  It's worth a $5 or $10 donation (IMO).\nHowever, this is a noble endeavor and if the CPU use is too high for your liking, you can \"throttle\" it to a lower threshold (Light, Medium, Full).\nSee this really well written Meta Post: Using Folding@home to help fight COVID-19 for additional details.\n\nA: Open your installation location and open the FAHController.app there you will be able to reduce the amount of CPU cores to be dedicated and also pause and continue the process at your will. \nAnother way to stop folding is to visit http://client.foldingathome.org. \nIn detail, this is explained in the meta post:\n- Using Folding@home to help fight COVID-19\n", "Q: iMac hard drive failed completely, My 2011 vintage iMac hard drive failed completely and local Apple techs say they cannot retrieve any data. I recall that I had files automatically being backed up to iCloud but do not know how to retrieve them from there. \n\nA: The easiest way to check if you have anything in iCloud is to log into icloud.com. Here you can see the contents of iCloud Drive as well as what photos have been loaded into the Photo Stream or Photo Library. You will also see notes, contacts, etc if you use those apps.\nHowever, 'backup' may be over stating matters: Time Machine is the Mac's built in backup solution, however it won't backup to iCloud or iCloud drive. \nYou of course can store files on iCloud drive, and often your Documents and Desktop folders are configured to be in iCloud drive by default.  You may also have configured Photos to backup to iCloud Photo Library, though this is reasonably rarer than doing it for the iPhone. If you pay for iCloud, you likely are using it for these items. If you do not pay for iCloud, I suspect you have very little (5GB only) stored in iCloud.\nOnce you get MacOS back on your Mac, you can log in with iCloud and all the content in iCloud will sync back to your restored Mac. \nGood luck\n", "Q: Dock process creates lock screen images continuously I noticed today that my disk is completely full despite the fact that it was half full just yesterday.

Is there a technical difference? macOS calls it Desktop Picture while iOS uses wallpaper. I haven't found any information about it so I wonder if someone has a piece of information that may help.\nmacOS\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207703\niOS\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200285\n\nA: Mac continues the use of the decades-old analogy of the computer screen being your desktop.  The first GUI used in a mainstream computer, and almost every computer after that, was primarily for work use so that way of describing the screen, like a desktop with a large writing pad or family pictures, was the best way to describe the image.\n\nPluckyVintage\niOS isn't a desktop computer, it's much more personal.  When iOS debuted, it was first on a small handheld phone.  You couldn't get much further away from a 'desktop' than an individual device you could customize.  There needed to be a way to refer to the background.  Because it could be customized and changed for each person's preference and tastes, the team at Apple decided on wallpaper.  \nI can't find anything that definitively states why Apple decided to use that term but it fits their goal of a personal device.\n\ngenius.com\nThis is the way I've always viewed these two; I don't have any special insight or knowledge to say this way of explaining is the most accurate or better than anyone else's. We might not ever know why these decisions were made the way they were.\n", "Q: Over 19GB RAM used by Catalina even with all GUI applications closed I have had a 2015 16GB MBPro for the past few years. It is currently on Mojave.  On it I have been running all sorts of heavy duty programs concurrently including Pycharm, Intellij, RStudio, Spark servers, productivity apps, and  multitudes of browser windows. It has been a balancing act to get them to coexist and I do need to shut down /restart chrome approximately daily to clear up its share. But the big picture is: lots of heavy apps are doing well running on the limited RAM available.\nRecently I purchased a new MBPro with 64GB RAM with Catalina  I did not expect to have any issues given the 4X upgrade in RAM. To my surprise I am seeing high fifties of GB's of RAM running essentially the same programs. The only difference is that I let Chrome run maybe a couple of days between restarts. But that's only accounting for about 10GB of the total.\nAfter killing everything - as shown below - there is still 19.5GB of RAM and 7.5GB of swap being used.  Where is that memory going?\nNote we have only the minimum gui apps plus chrome that I restarted only to bring up this stackoverflow page.\n\nLook at the memory usage by apps: nothing above even 500MB\n\nI am not running backend stuff. No servers. No Docker: only DropBox but I'm a light user of it.\n\nSo I am at a loss where the memory is being used. This is in stark contrast to my _MBPro2015/Mojave_ which would be at around 5GB total under the same circumstances.  Any ideas?\n\nA: There's a few things to note on your question.\nFirst, similar to Linux, memory usage under Mac OS X is a nuanced and very complicated topic. \"Used\" memory doesn't always mean a problem, in fact it doesn't necessarily correlate directly with physical RAM usage. \"Memory\" is an overloaded term which can refer to \"real\" memory, \"virtual\" memory (which is not the same as it was in older versions of Mac OS Classic) or physical RAM.\nAt a technical level, \"App Memory\" within Activity Monitor is the kernel's internal page count of non-purgable pages. Mapping this value to anything you can sum up from the other columns is... difficult to impossible\nFor some specific answers: in Activity Monitor, you may want to add the \"Real Memory\" and other memory columns. These are available under View > Columns. Also, make sure you have View > All Processes enabled, not just \"My Processes\"\n\nYou might find that either the process using memory was not listed because it was not yours, or you might find that the process is using a lot more virtual memory than real memory (they all will be) which may account for the \"App Memory\" which Activity monitor shows.\nFocus on the \"Memory Pressure\" graph in Activity Monitor rather than the \"App Memory\" or even \"Memory Used\" values. A healthy system will have a lot of memory used but without much Swap used. A general rule of thumb is: as long as your system is not using swap, performance is not impacted. (This is a gross oversimplification; lack of cache will also hurt performance)\nDue to the way memory on unix-like systems work, Mac OS X will use \"free\" memory for various caches, either disk cache, buffers, page cache, etc. When you launch an application, for example, the code for this application is \"paged\" into memory. Simply quitting the application may not free the pages; they are marked as available for use and as other areas of the system need memory, inactive pages will be either discarded or paged back to disk. On your system there is no memory pressure (because there's so much free RAM) so the kernel won't remove cached pages from RAM. This way if the closed applications are relaunched, the pages the need are already in RAM.\nIt sounds like you've moved from a system with 16 GB RAM to 64 GB RAM, and are used to being memory constrained on the smaller system. This makes sense, and as long as your new system is not under memory pressure 9as per the graph in Activity Monitor) you should be fine. If you're having a specific issue with the applications co-existing, launch them all and update the image you posted; unless memory usage increases to the point that swap and compressed memory are being utilized, it's unlikely due to memory constraints (from what I see above)\n", "Q: How do I lower OS /system resource usage /adjust for best performance?

Specifically, I used an iPad app while it was offline, then deleted it. I assume that it keeps logs of access into the app and whatnot. Can an app be able to gain access to these offline logs after the app is deleted by the user?\n\nA: No in general and by design. When the app is deleted, the os removed the container in which the app saves data. Unless the app saves data in a group container or runs on a jailbroken device and stuffs logs outside the sandbox, even reinstalling the app won’t recover the deleted data. \n", "Q: Add USB-C ports to an old 2014 iMac All my Apple devices are fairly new and apart from Lightning cables, all my peripherals are now USB-C. \nBut for photo editing I still like to use my 2015 27\" iMac that was heavily upgraded. Now this iMac only has two Thunderbolt 2 ports and, obviously, no USB-C ports. I would like to add a hub to my iMac that allows me to use USB-C devices, like hard drives that are mostly just USB 2 or USB 3 anyway. A single USB-C port would be enough. At the moment I keep a spare set of USB-A to whatever cables around but it's getting increasingly annoying.\nIs there a Thunderbolt 2 dock that would have a USB-C port or a way for me to use something like Satechis USB-C hub on my Thunderbolt 2 iMac? It does not need to be a Thunderbolt 3 port or support PD, all of which would require an active component.\n\n\nA: Actually, Satechi makes an adaptor which will allow you to use your existing Satechi hub with the USB Type-A port on your 2015 iMac. Below is a image taken from the webpage for the adaptor. The image shows your hub connected to an USB Type-A port on an iMac Pro though the adaptor.\n.\nSpecical thanks to MacGuffin for pointing out this adaptor. I would not have found this answer without such assistance.\n\nNote: MacGuffin also added the following to this answer.\n\nAs there are no such adapters with the proper chip in them there is no simple and cheap solution.  You would be best advised to deal with what you have or find a Thunderbolt to USB-C dock, hub, or breakout box.  Choices on this are slim and run over $100 in cost.\nAny inexpensive adapters for connecting USB-C client devices into USB-A hosts will be passive, and an active adapter is needed.  As the USB-IF group did not define how to construct such an active adapter a separate USB controller must be used.\nThe adapter recommended by David Anderson has been reported as a fire hazard in the Amazon reviews.  https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-Type-Type-C-Adapter-Converter/product-reviews/B07KCL8WZK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_prev_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2\nThis is an adapter that the USB-IF group declares \"potentially unsafe\" and \"invalid\" (whatever that means, nonfunctional maybe?).  Do not use this.\n\nA: There is no cheap and easy way to add USB-C ports to a computer that lacks PCIe slots.  This is especially tricky if you want DisplayPort (DP) video to be retained on the USB-C port.\nI have heard of people using a Thunderbolt 3 (TB3) dock with a Thunderbolt 2 (TB2) adapter to get working USB-C ports.  The connection to the computer is a combination TB2/DP signal through an adapter and cable to a TB3/DP port.  The TB2/TB3 adapter from Apple does not support DP so that will not make it through.  It appears that every TB3 dock has a USB 3.x controller and so even though the intended market for these docks would be using USB-C/TB3 ports that support USB 3.x they don't use that capability, instead using only Thunderbolt and DP signaling.  If the DP feature is not a concern then any USB-C/TB3 dock should provide the desired USB-C ports, as well as USB-A, audio, Ethernet, SD card readers, or whatever, just no video.\nAnother option is an eGPU.  Like a Thunderbolt dock they often have a USB 3.x controller and a downstream USB-C port.  No issue of lacking video as it has it's own GPU for that.\nAnother option is a PCIe breakout box.  Some provide only an upstream port and a slot for a single card.  Some have more circuitry for a downstream port and room for two PCIe cards.  If the box has no USB-C/USB 3.x ports then add it with a PCIe card.\nThe options I gave will run in the hundreds of dollars while the other answers and comments given so far point to some $8 adapters for plugging USB-C devices into USB-A ports.  These adapters should be avoided.  They violate the USB spec in ways that create a fire hazard.  Plugging a USB-C dock into one of these adapters runs the risk of feeding 100 watts INTO your USB-A port, and it's not made for that.  If your computer survives this then the port likely will not.  Then you just damaged a very nice computer, damaged a brand new dock, and damaged your $8 adapter.\nI know this is not what people want to hear but it is what it is.  A quick look at prices tells me a TB2 PCIe breakout box, TB2 cable, and USB-C PCIe card would likely total over $400, but with a 4 port USB-C USB 3.2 card then that's going to be far faster and more ports than that $8 fire hazard.\nA potentially cheaper option would be a simple TB3 dock, TB3 to TB2 adapter, and TB2 cable.  This could come in under the $400 mark but may offer just one USB-C/USB 3.x port, maybe up to three.  It would likely have other ports like USB-A, Ethernet, audio in/out, and SD card slot.  Still not some $8 fire hazard.\nTB2 dock choices, at least new ones, are going to be slim to none.  TB3 docks will often work but it means a $50 TB2/TB3 adapter, a $50 TB2 cable, and losing out on some of the dock features.  Any DP ports will likely be dead.  The dock will supply power to the upstream USB-C port but the TB2/T3 adapter will block it as no TB2 laptop can use that power, and protecting the computer from power coming in is kind of the point.  But then if someone was thinking of a GPU upgrade anyway then think of this as a way to get that USB-C port for \"free\".\nI wrote this long post to make the pros and cons as clear as I could on each option.  One big problem is the fire hazard of the cheap USB-C adapters.  Did I mention it was a fire hazard?  I wanted to leave no question that these adapters are made in a way that they are clearly a fire hazard as they have no protections from keeping a powered hub or dock from putting up to 100 watts into a port made to output something like 10 watts.\nOne more time, those cheap adapters are a fire hazard so don't touch.  Please.\n", "Q: Struggling to understand the new BBM update I have an old iPhone that had the old version of BBM (Blackberry Messenger) installed. If I were to charge it and load the app (now that it is off of the AppStore and shut down) will I still be able to access my old chats or see old photos? \n\nA: \n...will I still be able to access my old chats or see old photos? \n\nNo, they’re gone.\nBBM messenger was shutdown May 31st, 2019 and users had until the following Friday to download messages, photos, videos, and files.\nSource:  C|Net, BlackBerry Messenger shuts down: What you need to know\nThe “new” BBM app is their enterprise version and it’s completely different and is referred to in the article as a “replacement.”  Nothing was migrated from consumer to enterprise.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro stuck on Apple logo, Disk Utility first aid and fsck ok My laptop (mid-2012) won't boot past the Apple logo. Safe boot won't work either. \nDisk utility in recovery mode and fsck in single-user mode both say the hard disk is fine. Verbose mode report has several lines of disk1s1 I/O error, however. \nThis machine apparently does not have the diagnostic tools on it, as booting while holding down the 'D' key takes me to Internet recovery. I tried that to see if the online diagnostics would run but it gets stuck on the spinning globe screen after I enter my wifi password.\nI'm thinking this could be the hard disk, the hard disk cable, or the main board. How do I tell for sure so I don't spend money unnecessarily?\n\nA: Your thinking is correct.  It’s likely the hard drive, however it could also be SATA cable. Given that it’s inexpensive, it makes sense to charge it out with the replacement drive.\nHowever, to know for certain, connect your drive to a USB to SATA adapter, if the drive works properly, then you have proof positive it’s the cable.\nDoing diagnostics on a drive with an “unknown” working Component could give you erroneous results.  \n", "Q: Sync multiple macs together (which is better iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive or OneDrive?) I have 3 MacBooks and I made a Time Machine on one of them e.g macA and then restore it on the others macB and macC. Now I want to keep the 3 Macs in sync where if I did some changes on any mac (added files, deleted apps,...) then it will be reflected on the other two.\nI have checked and there are many options like iCloud, Dropbox, Google drive or OneDrive. and I read some links but it’s confusing to have a summary of the pros and cons of each one and which one is the best, so it will be appreciated to know from experience of people here what they think is the best option? since it will be good to have some advice to try avoid choosing one and having to switch to another later on.\nI've been looking into this and I was testing how iCloud sharing works and found out that if I shared a folder to anyone with read only access they still have to create an iCloud account which is very inconvenient since many people who are not Mac/iPhone users don't have one. But also the good thing with iCloud is that I have an iPhone and backing it up with iCloud is a convenience. So I am really confused with which option to go with could people please advise me with what they think is best from their experience? \nI want to know the best option for me if this is what I am looking for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Easy smooth syncing of folders across my Macs (Documents, Desktop, Photos,...)\n\n*Share files and folders with other people without the need of them to create a new account on the cloud platform so they can just download it, which I think is not possible with iCloud.\n\n*I can backup my iPhone to the cloud as well (with iCloud it can be easily done), but it's not mandatory.\n\n*The are all laptops so they are not on the same network so I guess a cloud based solution is best\n\n*The sync is done instantly so that I don't have to start it every time I open one of the laptops.\n\n\nA: iCloud is better since you can get support from Apple. It’s also better since you can enable local content caching which speeds things up 10x or much more for some cases. \nOneDrive is getting better, so I would explore that if you like Microsoft.  \nNo cloud sync is going to make everyone happy or not have issues or barf and choke. But I choose based on who I want to hire for support and what happens when their support fails me, which I will then have to learn or pay someone third party for help. \n", "Q: Homekit: multi mode button in home app Is anyone aware of a HomeKit enabled device which exposes a control element/button in the Home app which allows you to cycle through modes (each click changes a \"mode\" - whatever mode means for the particular device)?

My 2017 MacBook Pro has this issue for some time now, but recently I found something interesting. \nThe MBP won't find the boot drive, as long as the battery level is at > 70%. \nThe Mac boots just fine at lower battery levels; no issues whatsoever. Now, the problem is, I don't want to run my MacBook via battery the whole time or keep on disconnecting the AC power when 70% is reached every time. \nDoes anybody have similar symptoms and did find a better solution? Do you think there is a hardware issue with my device? \nI've been to the Apple store before (when I didn't knew this was connected to the battery level) and they couldn't find anything. They suggested I reinstall macOS, which of cause didn't change anything.\nEdit:\nOne detail I forgot to mention was that when I charge my MBP and close the lid, it crashes and gets really hot (fans turn on slowly). I'm not totally sure on this, but I think this also happens with lower battery levels.\nBattery Info:\n\n\nA: Based on the symptoms and the fact that you have no problem booting from an external devices means it could be, in order of most to least likely, the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Defective battery\n\n*Logic Board\n\n*SSD Drive \n\n\nThe battery and SSD are \"simple\" to diagnose, but not very convenient (unless you've actually got a shop and spare batteries and Mac proprietary SSDs laying about)*.  Basically, you would try \"known good\" components to see if the problem goes away.  The logic board is the most difficult as you would need to either eliminate everything else as a possibility or use specialized tools to verify that the SMC and related components (i.e. power rails) were functioning properly.\n\nIf the battery level is high, the internal ssd is not shown on boot (holding Opt),\n\nWhat we know is that everything works so long as the battery level is not high because it tells us that the computer will boot and do everything it's supposed to but it won't see the actual drive itself; it's not just a missing file system.\nA battery can swell and push everything out of alignment just enough to break contact with components.\nThe SSD could be failing since it's the only component that actually \"disappears\" from the system, but it works fine otherwise. Since the SSDs aren't SATA anymore and are now directly connected to the PCIe bus, you should be experiencing other difficulties and not just the SSD in isolation.\nThe reason I put the logic board higher in probability than the SSD is because the circuitry (managed by the SMC) is what regulates voltage.  Regardless of the charge or from where it's coming from (mains or battery) the SMC \"system\" ensures that the correct voltage gets to where it's going.  In other words, the voltage to the PCIe bus and ultimately to the SSD doesn't fluctuate.  If it does, then the problem is with the logic board, not the battery.\nEither way, if and once you elminate the battery as a cause, you'll need to take your machine in for service.  Apple will have you replace the logic board, however a specialist (i.e. Rossman Repair; not affiliated, just a satisfied customer) might be able to find and replace the actual bad component at a far lower price.\n\n* The 2015 and earlier MacBook Pro laptops had a removable SSD whereas the 2016 and later models have a soldered on SSD.  They can still be replaced, however it will have to be done by someone with the proper tools and skill-set for SMT PCB rework.  I left this info in for people with the same issue but earlier MacBook models.\n", "Q: Does iPad 9.7 2019 have a different Touch ID?

The 2nd gen Touch ID hardware is widely regarded as being much faster — nearly instantaneous — compared to the 1st gen Touch ID. \nRegarding the specific Apple products in your question: the 2019 iPad uses 1st gen Touch ID and the MacBook and iPhone 7 both use 2nd gen. \nSee this Wikipedia article on Touch ID for more details. \nAs of this writing, the breakdown between products with 1st gen vs 2nd gen Touch ID is:\n\n\n*\n\n*1st Gen\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 5S\n\n*iPhone SE (1st generation)\n\n*iPhone 6\n\n*iPhone 6 Plus\n\n*iPad mini 3\n\n*iPad (2017)\n\n*iPad (2018)\n\n*iPad (2019)\n\n\n*2nd Gen\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 6S\n\n*iPhone 6S Plus\n\n*iPhone 7\n\n*iPhone 7 Plus\n\n*iPhone 8\n\n*iPhone 8 Plus\n\n*iPhone SE (2nd generation)\n\n*iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st generation)\n\n*iPad Pro 9.7-inch\n\n*iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2nd generation)\n\n*iPad Pro 10.5-inch\n\n*iPad Air 2\n\n*iPad Air (3rd generation)\n\n*iPad mini 4\n\n*iPad mini (5th generation)\n\n*MacBook Air (2018)\n\n*MacBook Pro\n\n\n", "Q: How to uninstall VirtualBox / removing Kernel Extension Reading this thread\nI made with brew: \nbrew cask uninstall virtualbox\nError: Cask 'virtualbox' is not installed.\nThe dmg file of virtual box is not on disk..\nThanks for any good ideas. \n\nA: You can either redownload the virtual box dmg and run that script or download and run this script\nThe script above is just the script I got from the uninstall.tool\n", "Q: Can Apple developers see app uninstalls? I know that Apple developers can find out how many users have downloaded their app(s) from the App Store. But I would like to know if developers can also find out how many users have uninstalled their app(s)?\n\nA: No, iOS does not send a ping when an app is deleted from the device. Also, user choice determines whether iOS reports generic analytic information to Apple, so even if Apple wanted to process that analytics and possibly report that to a developer, it’s opt in by end user. \nDevelopers that desire that need to build an activity reporting service that exists outside the App Store. Look at MAU, monthly active users, count of launches, etc...  just be sure you think of the privacy concerns. Once you start collecting this data, you are liable under GDPR and many governments to handle it properly and respond to legal and extra-judicial requests properly. \nNot collecting this data and not retaining it can be a very smart business decision. Measuring engagement can be very valuable, but think how to benefit the end user and consider privacy while you do that. You might request this to be aggregated like the installs are as I could see Apple providing that in the future if it was balanced and useful to most developers rather than forcing them to roll their own analytics. \n", "Q: How do I use/transfer my kids iTune balance onto my family plan My kids have ~$30 on their iTunes accounts from gift cards.

I'd like to transfer it to the family, or any other method to use their gifts.  It's been \"stuck\" for years like this.\n\nA: There is not a transfer function since the value was spent when it was associated with an AppleID. \n\n\n*\n\n*Can I redeem all my iTunes gift cards at once?\nIf you queue up your purchases, remove the accounts with a credit from the family and then spend down the balance to zero, then join back in the family. As long as the purchases share with the family, it won’t matter that a non-primary purchaser purchased it. The main thing, is each account can spend down their balance if you let them purchase. \nGoing forward, only redeem credits from the master account that carries the payment terms of you want to prevent or restrict purchases from other accounts in general. \n", "Q: Prevent backup of iPhone on macOS Catalina I don't want to back up my iPhone in any way; not to my Mac, and not to iCloud.

I've replaced the new laptop's messages folder, did the same with the ichat containers, and also changed all folder ownership. Still, whenever I open up iMessage, it only shows my messages from today and yesterday. \nAny advice would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Since your message archive didn’t migrate the first time, I would do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect a hard drive to the old mac and let Time Machine make one backup - you can configure it to skip large files if you have lots of videos and photos you know can transfer, and you can delete any large apps you know you won’t want to back up or migrate - so light cleaning before one backup.\n\n*Then - see if you can update the old OS - I would update it to the absolute latest since that will do two things. First is it runs migration to make the older data ready for newer OS. Second, it makes the migration assistant newer so you’re not bringing data from 7 years back OS to the latest.\n\n*Erase your new Mac (back up any files needed) and re-run the migration from the updated Mac or a second backup of the upgraded Mac if you want.\n\n\nI use the PhoneView app to manage messages on macOS so that might be an option if Apple can’t update and migrate the data with their normal tools.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/\nIt’s targeted at managing messages from macOS, but the free trial might show you if it will help manage / archive your messages in a meaningful way on the mac side.

For a game, not worth the effort. For a career in security, this would make an excellent paper or project and could get you hired. \nJust because your Facebook data is deleted, you could still recover and reactivate the account.

Because I have not had much storage space left, I downloaded the latest iOS manually as an ipsw file and tried patching it with iTunes. All went well for a bit until I got an error message from iTunes saying something like \"The iPhone could not be restored. An unexpected error occurred (14).\" Now, the iPhone is in Recovery Mode. I cannot effort loosing my data and still hoping that I can somehow just update it and it magically works again. All my research just lead me to the various recovery tools e.g. EaseUS, minitool, dr.phone Toolkit that do not really help me.\nI am using iTunes version 12.8.2.3 and OS X 10.11.6 El Capitan\nUpdate 30/04\n4 Days later and I have tried every single possible solution from the net without luck.  \nPossible solutions \n\n\n*\n\n*USB connection (different cables, ports)\n\n*Re-download IPSW file and making sure it is not corrupted\n\n*Different computer(s)\n\n*Different iTunes versions\n\n*Tried the update over and over again (error 14 triggers every time)\n\n*Tried mounting the iPhone (see) to clear space (not possible in Recovery or DFU mode, internally everything gets encrypted to one big file once the phone enters Recovery Mode)\n\n*Tried useless third party apps: dr.fone, EaseUS, MiniTool, iPhone Backup Extractor etc. -> These \"Freemium\" Software cannot do more than iTunes. They are using and abusing the desperation of people to buy their overpriced products. They pay $$ to appear first in Google search results.\n\n*Tried useful third party apps: RecBoot, 3uTools (see below, very useful tool but Windows only), iFunBox, \n\n*3uTools powerful tool. Can try lots of different things, like update to beta versions, repair drivers etc. That is probably your best all-in-one solution.\n\n*Called Apple AASP (they don not have a magic tool either)\n\n*Jailbreak in DFU mode with checkra1n \n\n*Downgrade (requires either more than one IPSW-file still signed on ipsw.me or you have saved the right SHSH2 blob)\n\n\niTunes error 14 is likely to be caused (see) \n\n\n*\n\n*Due to a bad USB cable.\n\n*Due to an error with an firmware upgrade.\n\n*Due to a lack of capacity in the iPhone.\n\n*Due to an unstable network connectivity.\n\n*Due to an outdated iTunes.\n\n\nError message from 3uTools\nFlash error explanation: AMRestorePerformRestoreModeRestoreWithError failed with error: 14\nIf it is not a hardware error, you may consider:\n1.

There is no known solution/ workaround to me to keep the data (without having a recent backup). I have to factory reset my device (wipe all data) to get it working again. So yeah, backup your files kids!\n\nA: This is a tough one as once you are in recovery mode you can't backup your phone. So tell us, were you backing up to iCloud or had you been backing up to a Mac or PC using iTunes? If not you may be out of luck.\nWhat you need to do is get it out of Recovery Mode. I can't locate the info for the older SE model but you could try these.\nOn iPhone 8, 7, 6, 6s, 5 and earlier, hold down Power Button to turn off your device.\nOn iPhone XS, XS, XR, X, press and hold the side button with either volume button.\nOnce the phone has powered down, power it back on normally and hope it comes up out of recovery mode.\nIf that happens you should back up the phone with iTunes immediately then go to\nSettings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings.\nOnce that is done you should be able to update your phone and then restore from the backup you just made.\nIf it didn't come out of Recovery Mode You may need to enlist professional help. I have also seen a lot of utilities out there that can supposedly either backup an iPhone in recovery mode or get it out of Recovery Mode. I have no experience with these utilities, I have no idea if they do the job they say they do or are just backdoors to some kind of malware. So find an iPhone expert (Apple store or otherwise) who can fix this issue.\nAnd for heaven's sake start backing up your phone on a regular basis. Either to a computer or to iCloud.\n", "Q: iCloud backup from new iphone is lost when restoring old backup I bought a new iP7+ and started using it then i back up on iCloud. I also back up my old iphone 6s. To restore, i Back up my 7+ again and reset the phone. When i transferred old backup(6s) to 7+, the recent backup on 7+ is lost. On the iCloud backup in 7+ it says “Never backup” when i just did few minutes ago. How do i combine the backups? \nPs: Just before restoring, there were 3 options which i didnt really understand. I just chose the top one that says “Update the backup(i think)”\n\nA: Apple has no merge feature in any iOS backup. The restore operation implies a blank slate, tabula rasa, wiped device for iOS and TVOS and iPadOS. \nThe solution is to store data in a cloud synced manner or otherwise import data but backup is purely for a clean restore. \nWorst case you restore a backup and export or sync the data you need so you can wipe and restore and then Merge manually on the more current backup. Then layer on the loud synced data or imported files. \n", "Q: How do I enable Reader mode on Chrome on my Mac without downloading an extension?

Does such a list exist?\nTo be specific: I like to understand which code points and code blocks are supported in the \"Character Viewer\", even if no font is available that contains all codepoints.\nFor example, on macOS High Sierra, the codeblock for Maya numerals (codepoints U+1D2E0 and up) is missing, which was introduced in Unicode version 11. Unsurprisingly, as High Sierra was released in September 2017 and Unicode 11 in June 2018.\nSo far, I have not found any such list, only specification of the underlying file systems:\n\n\n*\n\n*The APFS filesytems supports all codepoints in Unicode 9, and is ignorant of codepoint normalization.\n\n*HFS plus filesystem supports any codepoint, but performs (the somewhat uncommon) decomposition normalization (NFD). Unicode 2.1 decomposition up till Mac OS X 10.2, and Unicode 3.2 decomposition starting with Mac OS X 10.3.\n\n\nA: I don't know of any list of the type you mention, but at least some MacOS  apps will display anything in Unicode for which a font is installed regardless of whether Character Viewer is up to date or not.

Home and End do nothing in iTerm2, nor do ⌘← and ⌘→.\nHowever, Ctrl-A and Ctrl-E do work.\nCan Home and End do this?\nPreferences->Keys_Key Bindings in iTerm2 do not offer a \"Start of Line\" or  \"End of Line option.\nRelated: 1, 2\n\nA: ^ ControlA and ^ ControlE are keybinding in Bash and ZSH, not in iTerm (or Terminal).\nIf you want custom bindings within iTerm, you will need to bind the actual keyboard sequence in the keybinding.  \"Start of Line\" and \"End of Line\" are descriptors, not the actual key strokes.\nSo, to do this you'd need to send ^ ControlA for Home via their Hex Codes.  In this case, the codes would be 0x01 for \"start of text\" (^A) and 0x05 for \"ENQ\" (^E).\nIn the image below, you can add a new binding in Preferences → Keys → Key Bindings\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on + to add a new binding\n\n*Click on Record in the dialog box\n\n*Press your desired key (Home in this case).  \n\n*Select your Action (you can scroll or search).  Select \"Send Hex Code\"\n\n*Enter the Hex Code (0x01 for \"start of text\")\n\n*Test it out!\n\n\n\n\nA: The accepted solution proposed by Allan is not optimal, as this keybinding affects *ALL* applications that are executed on the terminal and this key remapping would mean that some applications won't work as expected:\nFor example, if you use 'vi' then the keys 'Home' and 'End' no longer work after this key binding (those keys work ok if you don't do the proposed key binding)\nA better solution is to do the key mapping on the shell itself:\nIn zsh (the default shell being used by macos nowadays), just add this in ~/.zshrc:\nbindkey '\\e[H'    beginning-of-line\nbindkey '\\e[F'    end-of-line\n\nand Home and End keys will work ok in both the command line and vi\n\nA: For me the best answer was a combination of the above:\n\n*\n\n*Preferences->Keys: Remove the default key bindings in iterm for Home and End. This will cause Home (fn+left arrow in mac) & End (fn+right arrow in mac) to work normally as in linux and not as Scroll to Top or Scroll to Bottom respectively.\n\n*Preferences->Profiles->Keys: Make sure that the box for \"Page up, page down, home and end...\" is not checked.\n\nThis allows to jump to start or end of line in all cases using Home & End keys, including in 'vi'\n", "Q: Use Apple Script to open Chrome with specific profile I use multiple instances of the Chrome browser for different profiles, each with their own google account.

What else can I do to troubleshoot this problem?\n\nA: Even if you have an SSD MacBook Pro, I would immediately make a backup at the first signs of stalling. It’s almost always software and the fastest way to test that is to reboot to recovery, erase your Mac and then install a clean, new OS from internet. You will know immediately that the OS is clean and fast and then can move files back with Migration Assistant.\nYou need to trust your backup / restore though. You can also mess around with trying to eliminate things like user settings by making a new user account - see if it freezes, uninstall all old kernel extension and intrusive apps like AntiVirus or other things like Adobe that are heavy handed, but that takes a lot of time and most people have dozens to a hundred apps to triage that way. Much more efficient to just test a new user account, reboot and erase in my experience.\nAlso, it could be the storage failing, which also means it’s much better to get your backup solid - so good you know you can use it.

It's not specific to a single app.\nWhen viewing the About modal:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacOS Mojave Version 10.14.6 (18G103)\n\n*iMac 27-inch, Late 2012\n\n*Processor: 3.2 Ghz Intel Core i5\n\n*Memory: 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\n\n*Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 675MX 1GB\n\n\nLooking at the System Report, I see:\n\n\n*\n\n*Status on Memory Slots is OK. Has 2 4GB 1600 DDR3 cards.\n\n*Hard Drive: I have about 500GB of available storage on 1TB hard drive\n\n\nOther than these basic stats, I'm not sure what would be relevant to help diagnose the performance issues on this machine. What information could I provide to help determine the issue? Thank you.\n\nA: The only two things you can realistically do are change the HD to an SSD & upgrade the RAM.\nSome iMacs have GPUs that can be upgraded [slightly] but that's not really going to gain you much.\nA 1TB SSD can be bought these days for the price your 1TB HD would have cost back then, approx $£€ 100.\nAccording to Everymac that model can take 32GB RAM. I'd recommend at least 16GB these days.  \nThe SSD alone will put some spring back in its step. The RAM will let it breathe a bit better.\n\nA: There are basically two things you can do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get more RAM. There are two free slots, so adding 2x4 GB is easy and having 16 GB instead of 8 GB will make a difference\n\n*Replace the drive with an SSD\n\n\nI have a late 2012 Mac mini as my main machine, with 16 GB and a Fusion drive. Definitively not the fastest machine but useable, even with big RAW files etc.\n\nA: *\n\n*Replace the hard drive with an SSD. I recommend an SSD of at least 1 TB again. Not sure about if this is possible with your iMac either but I had my original 1 TB drive left inside my mid-2011 27” iMac. I am now happily using both drives. My iMac boots from the SSD which has the OS and the programs while my pics, videos and music are on the original drive. If keeping the original drive inside the computer is not possible, you can (have it) put it inside a proper enclosure and use it as an external drive. \n\n*Have the RAM increased to at least 16 GB and more if you can afford it. \nEach of these two alone should make a big difference and together they should make you feel like you got a brand new computer. Plan ahead well about what to do, especially when adding / replacing the hard drive, and, if you are not already doing so, backup with Time Machine before doing or getting done either.\n", "Q: What is the most efficient order to install Mac OS with Boot Camp and large application suites? I’ve been using Macs for a long time. In the past to optimize performance and save wear and tear on the disks it was recommended that when building a Mac OS image you should install the OS followed by applications in the order you most frequently used them. For me this has always been OS followed by Adobe suite, then Microsoft Office suite. \nEven though disks have gotten faster, fragmentation isn’t as important a factor as it once was and several of my machines now use SSD drives, I still follow this rule out of habit.\nDoes this have any effect on modern Macs and how does Boot Camp, Windows and Windows applications come into play? I rarely use Windows or Windows apps where on the disk should they be? The beginning or later on the disk? \n\nA: SSDs simply do not conform to this paradigm at all.\nThere is no inside or outside, early or late, beginning or end, partition border, or any of the old things you associate with spinny rust Hard Drives.\nSSDs allocate storage of any data sector entirely where their wear-levelling algorithms decide is 'next favourite'.\nIt is well beyond the prediction of us mere mortals.\nAdditionally, modern OSes, Mac & Windows, are optimised to this SSD behaviour & so don't even make any attempt to 'categorise' or 'optimise' data placement at all - often to the detriment of old HDs still in use as boot drives [best get them replaced as soon as poss].\nFeel free to put anything on, in any order, at any time.\n", "Q: Music app of iOS 12 on iOS 13 Is it possible to have the music app of iOS 12 on iOS 13, because the interface where the queue can be accessed only by pressing a button rather than scrolling/swiping down is very annoying.\nOpen to Jailbreaking the device for the same.\n\nA: Apple uses code signing to lock all their apps to the latest OS version. If you were to jailbreak your phone it might be possible to replace the Music app from a previous version but it would likely cause instability. \nA more reliable solution would be to roll back your phone to OS 12. But you’d be trading off the new features from OS 13. \n", "Q: Terminal does not accept root password (just changed it) Using dsenableroot I've just changed the password to a very simple one and terminal says \n***Successfully enabled root user.\nThen I run a command with sudo and it won't accept the password I just set. \nTried setting different passwords and opening new terminals but it doesn't help. \nWhat can be the problem and how do I even debug this?\n\nA: You need to enter the password of the current user (who needs to be in the admin group unless you changed sudoers) if you run sudo. \nPS: as other people already mentioned in the comments: you don‘t need to enable root to run sudo, basically you don‘t need to enable it at all. \n", "Q: fsck_apfs fails with \"btn: invalid value\" and \"Snapshot is invalid.\" I have an old MacBook Air running out of disk space, and DaisyDisk reports that 25 GB are taken by \"still hidden\". Following their suggestions, I've tried to run Disk Utility First Aid as well as a raw sudo fsck_apfs -ln /dev/rdisk1s1, and both give me the following error:\n...\n** Checking the object map.\n** Checking the snapshot metadata tree.\n** Checking the snapshot metadata.\n** Checking snapshot 1 of 1.\nerror: btn: invalid value (3808, 20)\n   Snapshot is invalid.\n** The volume /dev/rdisk1s1 could not be verified completely.\n\nI've checked both sudo tmutil listlocalsnapshots / and sudo tmutil listlocalsnapshotdates /, and both show no results. I've tried booting into recovery/single-user mode and running sudo fsck_apfs -y /dev/rdisk1s1, but it fails with the same \"snapshot is invalid\" error.\nIs there any way to get fsck_apfs to successfully run and repair the disk? If not, as a last resort, would it make sense to fully delete this machine's Time Machine backup and recreate it from scratch as a way to try to get rid of this invalid snapshot?\nEdit: I also forgot to mention, I have disabled Time Machine backups and restarted as well (in an attempt to get rid of all local snapshots).\n\nA: See the comments above for the approach I wound up taking. It appears Apple's tools don't allow recovery of the filesystem in this case, so I had to back everything up and reformat/reinstall/restore. That seems to have fixed the filesystem errors and disk space problems.\n", "Q: Could not validate sizes – Operation not permitted. The operation couldn’t be completed. (OSStatus error 1.) I am following instructions for creating a Bootable drive (generously provided in this answer by a gentleman named David Anderson). I am using a 16GB SD card to try to create a Bootable drive from my MacBook running Catalina.\nThe instructions could be simplified by doing a Restore using the Disk Utility to the external drive (SD card or flash drive), with BaseSystem.dmg being the restore source.\nThe problem is that when I try this, I get the following error (also see screenshot)\n\nCould not validate sizes – Operation not permitted. The operation\n  couldn’t be completed. (OSStatus error 1.)\n\nWhat does this mean? Is there a better way to fix this than the one given in David Anderson's answer. Or, can the asr command be made to work reliably, so the Disk Utility would not have to be used?\n\n\nA: You can do it easily using ASR command\n\n*\n\n*You have to scan your downloaded image via following command\nsudo /usr/sbin/asr imagescan --source ~/Downloads/macOSUpdCombo10.15.7.dmg \n\n\n\n*After scan you have to run following coammand to restore the image into the USB.\nsudo /usr/sbin/asr restore --source <IMAGE_PATH> --target /Volumes/<VOLUME_NAME> --erase\n\nIf there is any issue, please share in here.\n\nA: I think the \"Operation is not permitted\" may be caused by Disk Utility lacking the necessary admin privileges.\nsudo /usr/sbin/asr restore --source BaseSystem.dmg --target /Volumes/MyVolume --erase\n\nShould do the trick (terms and conditions apply)\n\nA: Ok, first of all, to be clear, you are doing this from macOS Recovery or while you are booted up on the bootable USB installer right? Also, a 16GB SD card is not enough to hold macOS Catalina. If you are looking to make an SD card that has a ready installation of macOS Catalina, then you can download the Install macOS Catalina app and then use that to install on the SD card (again, the amount of storage isn't enough). https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/reinstall-macos-mchlp1599/mac.\nIf you are experiencing issues with creating a bootable installer, then I think your best option would be to download the Install macOS Catalina app from the App Store and then use the creatinstallmedia command to create the installer. See the link for more https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372.\n\nA: if you have access to Terminal you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*list your disks\ndiskutil list to get your SD_CARD_NAME\n\n*unmount your SD card\ndiskutil unmountDisk force /dev/SD_CARD_NAME\n\n*erase it with the desired file system (AFS or JHFS+)\ndiskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ Emptied /dev/SD_CARD_NAME\nThen go ahead with your restore\n", "Q: How to move or export all Photos' library contents to a hierarchical by-date filesystem structure? I have rather large Photos.app library consisting of >50 years of family photos and videos. With Catalina I've been really unhappy with some bugs that have lost a couple months of recent photos and video and Apple has remained mum on the issue.  I've decided that my data will be more safely stored in a filesystem hierarchical data system that I can use with other apps and can manually manage going forward.\nHow can I export an entire Photos.app .photoslibrary contents to such an organization (YYYY -> MM -> DD) while retaining timestamps and any other pertinent metadata?\n\nA: Photos Takeout app can export Year-wise, Album-wise and Date-wise folders from Photos for Big Sur, Catalina, Mojave and High Sierra, for libraries of up to 2 terabytes in size, while preserving folder hierarchy and metadata. It's not meant for iPhoto. [Disclosure: I do customer service at AIL, developer of this app.]\n", "Q: Verifying zsh version on macOS Catalina upon brew install The default zsh version located at /bin/zsh is 5.7.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin19.0).\nI brew installed a new version, added /usr/local/bin/zsh to /etc/shells, and issued chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh to change it to that one - it's output: chsh: no changes made. I've also tried issuing sudo dscl . -create /Users/$USER UserShell /usr/local/bin/zsh and still see, upon restarting the command line and the machine itself, which zsh and type zsh showing /bin/zsh.\nI checked System Preferences -> unlock -> right click my user and click Advanced Options -> and I see /usr/local/bin/zsh for Login shell.\nOn command line:\n\n\n*\n\n*which zsh outputs /bin/zsh\n\n*echo $0 outputs -zsh\n\n*ps -o comm= $$ outputs -zsh\n\n*echo $SHELL outputs /usr/local/bin/zsh\n\n*type zsh outputs zsh is /bin/zsh\n\n*/usr/local/bin/zsh --version outputs zsh 5.8 (x86_64-apple-darwin19.3.0)\n\n*zsh --version outputs zsh 5.7.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin19.0)\nI'm wondering, how can I ensure version 5.8 is being used?\nCould it be that because /bin is before /usr/local/bin in my PATH, that /bin/zsh is resolved instead of /usr/local/bin/zsh, assuming shell binary is also resolved using PATH?\n\nA: The PATH evaluation command in /etc/zprofile probably overrides your shell settings in the Directory Services.\nIf you give priority to /bin in the global PATH (or even in the user's .zprofile/.zshrc/...) Apple's zsh will be your default shell exec despite other settings in your user ds profile.\n\nIf you want to keep your current PATH settings (prioritize /bin) you can move/copy brew's zsh link to a (new) dir like /usr/local/zsh/bin/.\nThen change the shell dir and the shell with sudo nano /etc/shells and chsh -s /usr/local/zsh/bin/zsh and finally change your PATH in .zprofile/.zshrc to\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/zsh/bin:$PATH\"\n\nYou have to renew the zsh link in /usr/local/zsh/bin/ after updating/upgrading brew's zsh!\n", "Q: Get AppleScript's \"do shell script\" to use the latest Bash For some reason, I cannot get AppleScript's \"do shell script\" to use the latest (GPLv3) Bash:\ndo shell script \"/usr/local/bin/bash; echo $BASH_VERSION\"\n-- Result: \"3.2.57(1)-release\"\n\nStrangely, it does work with an external .sh script:\n#!/usr/local/bin/bash\necho $BASH_VERSION\n\nCalling it like:\ndo shell script \"~/Library/Scripts/Script.sh\"\n-- Result: \"5.0.17(1)-release\"\n\nWhat's the difference and can I get it to work inside the .scpt script as well?\n\nA: do shell script always uses /bin/sh, even if your default shell, shebang, or $PATH variable is set to something else.\nTo force it to use a different shell, you will need to call that shell. To run a command in bash, use the argument -c:\n/usr/local/bin/bash -c 'echo $BASH_VERSION'\n\nIf you only want to run a single bash script, you can omit the -c with: /usr/local/bin/bash /path/to/script.bash\n\nIn AppleScript:\ndo shell script \"/usr/local/bin/bash -c 'echo $BASH_VERSION'\"\n\n\nThe man page entry for bash -c:\n\n-c command_string\nIf the -c option is present, then commands are read from the first non-option argument command_string.\n\n\nA: In your shell scripts, you should use #!/usr/bin/env bash.\nWhy?\nIt will use the bash that you've specified in your $PATH because the /bin/bash may be entirely different than the bash in /usr/local/bin/bash that you installed after the fact.\nTo ensure that you \"get\" the correct bash version, make sure  that it's directory precedes the original in your path statement.  For instance, if it's located in /opt/local/bin, your path may look something like this:\n/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\n", "Q: Gluing the cover of an Apple wireless keyboard Every one of the pins on the cover of my Apple wireless keyboard has cracked. The ones still there are holding on with an edge. Given the keyboard's age, I can't say these pins have a flimsy design. Lifting the keyboard to clean the sides of the buttons with a Q-tip is all it took for the cover to fall off.\n\nI'm about to use super glue (it's not quite epoxy, but it's the closest to epoxy on the market) to glue the remaining pins in place. Before re-attaching, I'll wait 2-3 hours for the bond to cure to be sure I'm not gluing the cover back to the keyboard. \nHave you tried this sort of thing? The easiest solution (just gluing the cover on the aluminum case) is not interesting, in case some maintenance is needed one day (plus, having replaceable batteries is kind-of a nice feature compared to sealed custom batteries). Can you suggest another solution, or confirm super glue works all right?\nPlease don't suggest to use scotch tape, unless you can suggest a brand that will detach cleanly, even two years from now.\n\nA: It's not going to work, unfortunately.\nI've attempted a very similar repair which only ended in failure (and despair).  The problem is the plastic and why the tabs broke in the first place - they've become brittle with age.\nSo with some patience you can get the tabs back on, but they will break off again, unfortunately.\n\nA: There is no stress on this plastic cover during normal use. If the table is flat, the keyboard will sit on the two feet on either side of the electronics/battery compartment.\nGluing will work (has worked). It's not particularly easy to re-attach the tiny broken pieces, but that's a different story. Once the cover is re-attached and the keyboard is flat again, the absence of stress means this solution may last.\nUltimately, to keep the cover from breaking again, one has to remember not to pick up the keyboard by grabbing anywhere near the cover. Use perhaps either side, or use two hands from both sides. Likely, the plastic cover has broken off in the first place because it was picked up where it wasn't designed to be picked up.\n", "Q: What dowload speeds is the Apple USB Ethernet Adapter capable of?

for returning the laptop.\n\nA: I had the same issue. I noticed the panic would happen when the USB C wire was moved / wiggled.\nI bought a 10ft Anker USB C to plug into the brick instead, and it seems no more panics in the last month.\nSo a quick fix for this might be to change out the USB C cable.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 13\" Touch bar permanently blank I'm on a new 2019 MacBook pro 13”. The TouchID fingerprint sensor is working. But my touch bar has gone completely blank. I tried restarting my MacBook Pro but it did not help.\n\nI've also done a factory reset, SMC, NVRAM/PRAM and an Apple diagnostics, hoping to fix the problem but it did not work.\nAfter re-install macOs, I was able to see touch bar configuration on System Preferences -> Keyboard menu:\n\nI am not able to see touch bar option and it is completely dark black.\nI tried resetting the touchbar through the terminal by using the below syntax:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo pkill “TouchBarServer”\n\n*sudo pkill \"Touch Bar Agent\"\n\n*sudo pkill ControlStripAgent\nI have tried to verify whether they are running by using below command and could not find any process running.\n\n\n*\n\n*ps -A | grep -i \"touch bar agent\"\n\n*ps -A | grep -i \"controlstrip”\nI can see the control strip and touch bar server is running in activity monitor:\n\n\nI could see this is a common issues across mac book pro and customer don’t have any proper fix for it.\n\nA: Your Touch Bar has failed and you need to have it serviced.\n\nThe TouchID fingerprint sensor is working. But my touch bar has gone completely blank.\n\nThis very statement has come up a lot, even here on Ask Different. The touch bar and the fingerprint sensor are two completely different things - a very thin display and a fingerprint sensor - covered by a single pane of glass.  It’s a very common misconception to believe that the whole thing must be working because the fingerprint sensor is functional.\nThink of the Touch Bar as a display, not unlike the display on an iPhone with the fingerprint sensor (i.e. iPhone 7+).  Many times the LCD would malfunction in someway, but you were still able to unlock it with the fingerprint reader.  The same thing is happening here.\nYou’ve done all the proper steps to diagnose it, but unfortunately, you’ve arrived at the only conclusion left - it’s dead.\n\nA: I have the same problem except I dont have any config on system preferance.\n\nAnd there is no Control strip service running anytime.\n\nAny help to service this as I live in a country where there is no apple support.\n\nA: I ran into this problem (completely blank touch bar) and none of the potential solutions here worked for me. On another site I found this, which did work – hopefully it can help someone else in the same situation:\nsudo killall ControlStrip\n\n\nA: For anyone coming to this post from a web search, this is what worked for me:\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac.\n\n*Press and hold the power button for 10 seconds, then release the button.\n\n*Wait a few seconds, then press the power button to turn on your Mac.\n\nSource: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\n", "Q: iOS - how to \"save as a copy\" for annotated photos Ive taken a photo on my iPhone (iOS 13.x) and drawn over the photo using iOS's in built annotation tool. \nI would like to also have a copy of the photo where i have not drawn over it. \nIs it possible to get the annotation tool to save the annotated photo as a duplicate so that i can have both copies ? \n\nA: You can create a copy from the Share Sheet before you start to annotate the photo.\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to photo in question\n\n*Activiate Share Sheet\n\n*Scroll down a bit (depending on screen size) and tap on \"Duplicate\"\n\n\nAfterwards select \"Edit\" on one of the photos.\n", "Q: Warning: xf : INO_EXT_TYPE_DSTREAM when running First Aid of Disk Utility I run Catalina and when I run First Aid on Disk Utility App, it returns \nwarning: xf : INO_EXT_TYPE_DSTREAM : found unexpected dstream associated with non-regular file\n\nand\nwarning: found orphan dstream id object (id 125206461, refcnt 1)\n\nAnyone can explain me, what is the meaning of those warnings?\nMy mac is randomly shutdown.

It because of logicboard issue.\n\nA: Same here. Macbook Pro Retina, 2015, on Catalina 10.15. Mac locks up randomly about once a day, and I can't do anything except reboot via power button. \nRan First Aid from Recovery Mode on \"Macintosh HD - Data\" and got this same sequence along with \"Too many warnings of this type generated; suppressing subsequent ones.\"\nI tried Apple Support Communities and didn't find anything exactly the same. Most were Mojave-related but it sounds like a clean reinstall might be required. \n\nA: Same there. I am on macOS 10.15.4. My mac locks up randomly once a day as well. During lock up, I could still access in memory apps as well as Finder, but not Disk Utility, iStat Menu and etc that require some sorts of storage API. The only way to escape from that lockup is to do a hard-reboot by long pressing the power button. Then, I used cmd+r to enter the recover mode and run Disk Utility there. I got lots of above \"unexpected dstream\" errors which were not fixable through the First Aid.\nPreviously, I had my Time Machine automatic backup turned on. I saw those errors were on those local snapshots. Now I turned it off and deleted all my local snapshots. However, I could still see lots of those errors from regular file system in Disk Utility. I suspect this might have something to do with recent macOS changes, not sure whether directly related to Time Machine or not. Nevertheless, I have created a periodic backup schedule instead using TimeMachineEditor. I will report back when that lockup happens again.\n\nA: I don't have a solution sorry, but I have the same warning messages:\nRunning First Aid on “Macintosh HD — Data” (disk1s1)\nVerifying the startup volume will cause this computer to stop responding.\nVerifying file system.\nVolume could not be unmounted.\nUsing live mode.\nPerforming fsck_apfs -n -l -x /dev/rdisk1s1\nChecking the container superblock.\nChecking the EFI jumpstart record.\nChecking the space manager.\nChecking the space manager free queue trees.\nChecking the object map.\nChecking volume.\nChecking the APFS volume superblock.\nThe volume Macintosh HD — Data was formatted by hfs_convert (748.21.6) and last modified by apfs_kext (1412.101.1).\nChecking the object map.\nChecking the snapshot metadata tree.\nChecking the snapshot metadata.\nChecking the extent ref tree.\nChecking the fsroot tree.\nwarning: xf : INO_EXT_TYPE_DSTREAM : found unexpected dstream associated with non-regular file\nwarning: found orphan dstream id object (id 34956820, refcnt 1)\nVerifying allocated space.\nPerforming deferred repairs.\nThe volume /dev/rdisk1s1 appears to be OK.\nFile system check exit code is 0.\nRestoring the original state found as mounted.\nOperation successful.\nSo far my Mac seems to be working fine but I noticed these warning messages when doing a First Aid scan.\n\nA: it appears the fsck_apfs in Disk Utility by default runs in live mode, which can be only executed with -n (to deny any repairs).\nTo Fix, I need to unmount the volume with write access and run fsck_apfs -y to apply the suggested fixes.\nThis is what I did:\nRebooted to Recovery mode (Cmd+R)\nStarted Terminal\nRun\ndiskutil umountDisk /dev/rdisk3\nfsck_apfs -y /dev/disk0s2\n\nThat applied the fixes and the volume seems to be clean now\n", "Q: Very small type size upon starting evince pdf viewer I use evince as pdf viewer but when I start it running, the type is very small (about 10%) although 100% is written.\nLooking at  Configure Evince to open maximized with 100% zoom level?, I tried the following commands to solve the problem without success: \nthe following command does not change anything\ngsettings set org.gnome.Evince.Default zoom 1.5\n\nthe following command is not a valid command\ngsettings get org.gnome.Evince zoom\n\n\nA: *\n\n*You can set defaults from within Evince (\"Hamburger\" menu > Save Current Settings as Defaults)\n\n*Settings are stored in ~/Library/Preferences/evince.plist, so defaults write ~/Library/Preferences/evince.plist \"/org/gnome/evince/default/zoom\" 1.5 does the same as gsettings does on Linux.\n\n\nSetting the zoom level to 200% and then saving the current settings will lead to evince to open with 200% the next time.

Do I have to type osascript -e before every line?\n\nA: There are several ways to accomplish the goal. Here is the method I would use...\nIn Terminal run the following compound command, e.g.:\nf=\"myscript\"; touch \"$f\"; open -e \"$f\"; chmod +x \"$f\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: Change myscript to the name you'd like.\n\n\nIn the new blank TextEdit document that opens, add the following as the first line:\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\n\nThen add your AppleScript code under the shebang you just added.\nSave the document.\nNow to use it in Terminal, e.g.:\n./myscript\n\nOr:\n/path/to/myscript\n\nOr place in in a directory that is within the defined PATH and then simply use its name, e.g.:\nmyscript\n\n\n\nThis method also works; however it's not practical for long scripts:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Preferences\" to activate' -e 'tell application \"System Preferences\"' -e 'reveal anchor \"input\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.sound\"' -e 'end tell' -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\"' -e 'repeat until exists tab group 1 of window \"Sound\"' -e 'end repeat' -e 'tell table 1 of scroll area 1 of tab group 1 of window 1' -e 'select (row 1 where value of text field 1 is \"Internal Microphone\")' -e 'end tell' -e 'end tell' -e 'quit application \"System Preferences\"'\n\nPlease read the manual page for osascript for additional information. In Terminal:\nman osascript\n\n\n\nOn a separate note, if you omit the following line of code you'll not have to see the System Preferences window flash on the screen:\nSaved as as script, remove:\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to activate\n\nIn the very long drawn out command line, remove:\n-e 'tell application \"System Preferences\" to activate' \n\n\nA: yes you have to put osascript -e before every line like this:\nosascript -e 'display dialog \"Hello from osxdaily.com\" with title \"Hello\"'\n\nand I hope this link will help you more.\n", "Q: Enter individual numbers into iPhone contacts I have a list of phone numbers:\nJoe Blow (123) 456-7890\nSteph Smith (234) 345-5678\nIggy Ziggy (876) 756-7550  \nIs there a way to import these individual numbers into iPhone contacts without typing them in by hand?\n(or receiving a call/message from them)\n\nA: If you put them into a vCard (.vcf) file and if your iPhone is synced to iCloud, you can import them via the settings in Contacts on iCloud.com as you can see below:\n\nThere are also 3rd party service options such as Google Contacts as you can read from this article with specific directions if you want to import them from a CSV file.\n\nA: iCloud Import Contacts\nIf you sync your contacts with iCloud, you can import contacts using the VCard format.  This must be done using the Contacts app on iCloud.com\n \nOutlook.com Import Contacts\nOther options are the online email clients like Outlook.com, GMail, Yahoo, etc.  For example, using Outlook.com, you can import a CSV file of your contacts as shown below.  You can access the function by clicking on \"Manage Contacts\" or the icon that looks like \"a person with a gear\" in the upper right hand corner of the web app.\n\nDesktop Options and Manual Entry\nGetting your contacts into vCard (for iCloud) may be more difficult than just inputting them manually.  There are are some Excel plugins that allow you to batch convert CSV/Excel to vCard.  I’d avoid the “free online converters” because you’re basically filling their databases with known good email addresses that will get most likely get spammed.\nIf you have access to the desktop clients, you can import into those apps and then sync with the cloud versions (I have this scenario set up personally)\n\n\n*\n\n*The Desktop versions of Outlook (Mac & PC) allow you to import contacts and sync to your Contacts.\n\n*Desktop version of Contacts allows for importing of vCard (.vcf), Archive files (.abbu)and CSV.

The \"deleted\" iPhone no longer appears in Find My iPhone menus on iCloud.com. However, because the \"deleted\" iPhone was turned off at the time the \"Erase iPhone\" option was selected on iCloud.com, the contents of the \"deleted\" iPhone were actually not erased. \nBefore the iPhone is turned on, my friend has noticed that that the action she took through iCloud.com will also erase all the contents of her \"deleted\" iPhone. She has then decided that she does not want her \"deleted\" iPhone to be erased for a number of reasons including not all the contacts on the \"deleted\" iPhone being synced to iCloud (although the contacts option is enabled in the \"deleted\" iPhone's iCloud settings). \nTo prevent erasing of the \"deleted\" iPhone at least for now, she took out the \"deleted\" iPhone's SIM card and disabled the internet in her home before turning on the \"deleted\" iPhone. She can currently get into the \"deleted\" iPhone without any trouble (but of course without any internet connection) and is busy writing down the contacts not synced to iCloud.com! \nShe also owns a second iPhone that is synced to iCloud via the same Apple ID with the \"deleted\" iPhone (and the second iPhone, as you might expect, doesn't have the missing contacts from iCloud.)\nSo here is the question: \nIs there any action she can take through the \"deleted\" iPhone or her 2nd iPhone or a computer that will nullify at least the \"erase all content\" part of the command to be communicated to this iPhone from iCloud.com once it is connected to the internet? \nThank you. \n\nA: I am not sure if the same would happen in all similar cases but I just want to tell what happened to my friend's iPhone after posting the above.\nFor about two weeks she made sure her phone did not connect to the Internet by disabling the Wifi and taking out the SIM card. In the meantime, she wrote down the details of her important contacts missing viewing them on iCloud.com using a browser. Once she wrote down everything she needed, she turned the Wifi on and ... nothing happened. The iPhone connected to the Internet and continued to operate as usual as if the Erase iPhone option was not activated via iCloud.com.\nWhen we checked the iPhone's status on iCloud via Find My iPhone, it only appeared to be offline. Out of an abundance of caution, we disabled the Find My iPhone menu option through the iPhone's settings. This caused the iPhone to be removed from the list of Apple devices listed under the Find My iPhone menu on the iCloud associated with her Apple ID. She has been using her iPhone as usual since then.\n", "Q: Login problem on my Mac I can’t log in to my Mac because my wireless keyboard isn’t responding. Mouse is working ok.

I want to give an app to a friend as a gift. My friend is joined to an Apple Family Sharing family and has access to the apps within that family, and also does not have her own payment method registered due to this. \nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I gift the app to my friend, does the entire family get access? (This isn't a problem, but it's something that I think would need to be communicated, especially if others in the Family Sharing plan decide to use the app and then my friend later leaves the family)\n\n*If my friend decides to leave the Family Sharing plan, will she retain access to the app I gifted her under her own Apple ID, or will it revert to being owned by the Family Sharing family owner? \n\n*If my friend uses in-app purchase to buy an add-on for the app (not a transient item like coins or credits, but say unlocking a feature), will that attach to her own Apple ID (and thus be available should she disconnect from the family sharing plan) or will it belong to the family and thus not be available later?\n\nA: \n  \n*\n  \n*If I gift the app to my friend, does the entire family get access? (This isn't a problem, but it's something that I think would need to be communicated, especially if others in the Family Sharing plan decide to use the app and then my friend later leaves the family)\n  \n\nYes. After you gift the app to your friend's Apple ID, it appears as a purchased item under their account. If the app in question has family-sharing enabled, it would also become available to the other members of the family.\n\n\n  \n*If my friend decides to leave the Family Sharing plan, will she retain access to the app I gifted her under her own Apple ID, or will it revert to being owned by the Family Sharing family owner?\n  \n\nThe app gets tied to your friends Apple ID. So she'd retain access. If the other family members have downloaded and installed the app before your friend leaves the family, they can continue using it. After your friend has left the family, the other members of the same family would lose access to download it for free.\n\n\n  \n*If my friend uses in-app purchase to buy an add-on for the app (not a transient item like coins or credits, but say unlocking a feature), will that attach to her own Apple ID (and thus be available should she disconnect from the family sharing plan) or will it belong to the family and thus not be available later?\n  \n\nThe In-App purchases are tied to the Apple ID that purchases them, not the family. So she'd continue to have access to the In-App purchases made with her Apple ID, and the family she's a part of would not have access to it, irrespective of whether she remains a part of the family or not.\nA very simple way to understand and get answer to these questions is this: There is no such concept as family ownership of content. Content such as an app purchase is owned by a single Apple ID, and it appears under the list of purchased item for the said Apple ID. If the developer of the app has enabled family-sharing for their app and someone from the family purchases the app, it becomes available for download to the other members of the family the Apple ID is a part of.\nTo understand more about Family Sharing, you can consider going through the following links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Family Sharing - Apple\n\n*What types of content can I share with my family using purchase sharing?\n", "Q: Xcode - save all errors and warnings to file? Is there any way to save all errors and warnings generated by Xcode to a target text file?\nMy current way of doing this is by copy-pasting and indenting every single error and warning, but that is rather time-consuming.\nI am using Xcode 11.4.1 on macOS 10.15.2.\n\nA: I've since figured out how to do this.\nPress Command 9 to display the \"Report Navigator\" (Or click on the view menu, select navigators, and then choose \"reports\".)\nFind the entry for the target you built, and the \"Build\" entry. That shows the build report in the editor window.\nThere should be an \"export\" button at the top of the report editor window. If you click that it lets you save your build report to a text file.\nAnother way to do this is to build your project from the command line with a command like:\ncd <project directory>\nxcodebuild build -workspace <workspaceName>.xcworkspace -scheme <schemeName> -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 13' > <path-to-report-textfile>\n\n(Where you replace <project directory>, <workspaceName>, , and ` with the values for your project.

When using an Apple Watch Series 2 or later, there's an option that can be activated from within the Control Center that locks all screen input; this is useful when swimming whilst wearing the Watch, but also prevents accidental taps during everyday use. I'm wondering whether activating this setting also disables input from the hardware buttons - I was mainly thinking the on/off button - it would be useful to know if the Emergency SOS feature can still be activated when it's enabled.\n\nA: Hardware inputs still work. During waterlock, you'll need to turn the Digital Crown in order to expel the water from the watch and disable waterlock.\n", "Q: How can I stop from having my music transfer between my iPhone and my HomePod? What initially seemed like a clever feature turns out to be ridiculously annoying: the transfer of a song between a HomePod and an iPhone.\nI have a HomePod in my office, on my desk, and whenever I take out my iPhone to do something, even though the iPhone is a good 2 feet away from the HomePod, it transfers from the amazing speaker of the HomePod to the little crappy speaker in the phone.  This literally happened like half a dozen times in the last song I played.  It significantly degrades the listening experience  both by interrupting the song (there is always an extremely noticeable delay when transferring) and by forcing my to play on a radically inferior speaker.\nHow can I make this stop?  \nI have looked through the configuration for the HomePod and can't find anything to allow me to turn off this misfeature, or (better yet) adjust the proximity required, or add a confirmation before the transfer.  This seems like an obvious failure on the part of Apple to test this feature well or provide necessary settings, but since I can't make them fix it, what can I do?\nThere is no other furniture in my office that is suitable for the speaker, so moving it is a terrible option.\nI tried turning off Bluetooth on my phone, and that surprisingly didn't thwart it.  (I would have guessed that Bluetooth was used for detecting proximity.)\nWhen the notification appears to tell me of an impending transfer, flicking it away quickly has occasionally seemed to prevent the transfer but this has been very inconsistent, and there is a very short opportunity to do that.  \nTo add insult to injury, as I've tried testing various methods I've found that the proximity detection often fails even when I want it to work, making it impossible to test whether some behavior is stopping it.\nUpdate: I've found a solution to turning it off completely (below) but I'd still be interested in other approaches if anyone finds a clever way of controlling how this works.  The ideal would be a way of having it turned on, but having it work reliably only when I actually intend it to, not when I'm just using my phone from a couple of feet away from the speaker.\n\nA: Okay, it turns out this is controlled in settings for the iPhone, not the HomePod.  I think of it as a HomePod feature, but whatever.\nIt's under Settings → General → AirPlay & Handoff\n\n\nA: Without adding furniture to my office, it turns out there are accessories for mounting the HomePod on the wall.

I've been able to send almost any other character, by using either an escape character, such as \\<C-a> or entering in the character directly, such as ‰, but I haven't been able to figure out (or find on Google) how to send one of the arrow keys. For example, I would like to configure pressing \n\n\n*\n\n*⌘↑\nto send a tmux command of:\n\n\n*\n\n*ctrla↑ (ctrl-a being by prefix)\n\n\nIn other words, pressing cmd-up would navigate to the pane above the current one. How would I do this in iTerm2? That is, what \"action\" should I select (send hex codes? send text? send text with vim escape chars?) and text/code should I send?\n\n\nA: If you're trying to send an ↑ to the terminal, I've been able to accomplish this using the Send Text with \"vim\" Special Chars option and then using the escape sequence \\u000d[A. For example, I'm using it to clear the console and repeat the last command, so the full sequence I'm sending is:\nclear\\u000d\\u001b[A\\u001b[A\\u000d\n\nThis first writes clear to the console and then submits with Enter as \\u000d. Then, ↑ is sent twice to get the command submitted before the last clear command, and Enter is sent again to submit the retrieved command.\nHope this helps you.

Just configuring the archive utility should be enough. Set the \"save expanded files\" destination folder on the hidden preferences panel. Follow the steps below to enable it.\nChange How macOS Handles ZIP Files With These Hidden Preferences\n\nA hidden System Preferences pane lets you configure how archives work on your Mac. You can stop ZIP files from going to the Trash after you unarchive them, or you can have newly created archives spawn in a particular folder. Enabling this panel just takes a couple minutes.\nFind and Install The Hidden Preferences Pane\nOpen the Finder, then click the icon for your computer in the “Devices” section of the sidebar. From your system drive, browse to System > Library > CoreServices > Applications, a folder that houses a few application your Mac uses regularly.\n\nWe’re interested in the Archive Utility, which is the program that opens ZIP files by default on your Mac. Right-click this application, then click “Show Package Contents.”\n\nThis allows us to browse the files that make up the application. Head to Contents > Resources and you’ll find a file called “Archives.prefPane.”\n\nDouble-click this file and System Preferences will launch, asking you if you’d like to install the pane. Click “Install.”\n\nYou’ve now added the Archives pane to your System Preferences.\nChange How Archives Work On Your Mac\nYou’ll find the new Archives pane in the bottom section of the System Preferences.\n\nClick it and you’ll see a few options.\n\nFirst, you can choose where unarchived files end up. The default is in the same archive as the archive itself, but you can choose a specific folder if you want. Next, you can choose what happens to archive files after you unarchive them. By default, such files are sent to the trash, but you can optionally leave the archive alone or even delete it outright.\nThe bottom half of this preference pane concerns archives created by this application. If you select a bunch of files in the Finder, right-click them, then click “Compress,” you can create a ZIP file.\nSource: https://www.howtogeek.com/284856/change-how-macos-handles-zip-files-with-these-hidden-preferences/\n", "Q: Mac Terminal or iTerm: Copy the current command but exclude prompt? I am using Terminal or iTerm (iTerm2). Let's say I've typed in a command but haven't hit enter yet. Or maybe I used the up arrow to navigate through my command history. How do I copy the current command to the MacOS clipboard? But I also don't want it to include the prompt. Is there a keyboard short cut to do this?\nFor example, let's say the terminal is showing this:\nmyhostname:Documents kevuser$ mkdir cool_directory_name\n\nWhat is the keyboard shortcut to copy mkdir cool_directory_name to the Mac OS clipboard? Can I add that functionality somehow? It feels like every time I try to copy the whole line it includes the prompt part of the terminal, myhostname:Documents kevuser$, which I don't want to be copied and pasted.\n\nA: Just use the command\n echo !! | pbcopy\n\nThe double exclamation points is “last command”. It’s then piped to the pbcopy command which puts it in your clipboard.\nThere’s no shortcut, but you can make an alias in your ~/.bash_profile or in your ~/.zprofile files, depending on your shell.  That will enable you to execute the command with as easy to remember name:\nalias cplastcmd=‘echo !! | pbcopy’\n\nIf you want to copy text that you’ve entered but not executed you can use the following:\n\n*\n\n*^ ControlU :  Cut the line before the cursor and put it in the clipboard.\n\n*^ ControlK : Cut the line after the cursor and put it in the clipboard. Use with ^ ControlA to move to the beginning of the line.\n\n*^ ControlY : Paste the last command from the clipboard\n\nNote:  The standard copy/paste keyboard shortcuts  ⌘ Command or ^ Control C and V don’t work in Terminal.\nFinally, if you have a mouse with a third/middle button, you can simply select the text and press the middle button to copy and paste the selected text.\n\nA: Aside from Allan's answer using pbcopy to capture the last executed command (which doesn't work for non-executed commands or those executed some time ago), the only way to copy the current line in Terminal is by highlighting and copying.\nOne option to make this easier is to add some extra whitespace to your prompt. This will not help you grab ONLY the command you want, because you may catch extra whitespace (which often won't matter), but it can make it easier to avoid grabbing extra text to the prompt.\nYour prompt may be set in a number of different places depending on the setup and shell you're using (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc). Somewhere it will appear looking like:\nPS1=\"[\\u@\\h \\W]\\\\$ \"\nWhere PS1= is setting the prompt. You can modify the trailing space to add extra spaces.\nSorry there's not a better answer.\nAlternatively, sometimes I double-click the first word/command of the line, then shift-click the end of the line, and that will gaurantee at least you won't gobble up any part of the prompt.\n\nA: In iTerm2, If you enabled Shell Integration:\n\n*\n\n*Press Home to go to line beginning\n\n*Type echo and Enter so that current line in printed as output\n\n*Press Cmd+Shift+A to select last command output\n\n*Cmd+C to copy to clipboard.\n\n\nA: On my iMac running High Sierra, I can use the mouse cursor to select any part of a line I want and copy it. With a terminal window open, if I move my mouse cursor into the terminal window and click, the mouse cursor turns into the cross-beam cursor. I can then move it around the terminal window and select a part of any line I choose.\n", "Q: \"No Local Dictionary Available\" error from dictionary after upgrading from Sierra to Catalina I have a late 2013 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro, which I just upgraded from Sierra to Catalina.

This is what it looks like:\n\nI tried clicking the \"Configure Dictionaries\" button and I don't see the choices I usually see.

I'm using an external hard drive as a Time Machine backup, and I found a backup of my /System/Library/Assets/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX folder that is recent but from before upgrading to Catalina. My laptop's hard drive has a /System/Library/Assets folder, but it does not have a com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX folder within it, and Finder is not letting me create one. I don't see the \"New Folder\" option like I usually do. I tried dragging the folder from my backup and nothing seemed to happen. I tried using the Time Machine app to restore the folder and I got a dialog saying \"“” can’t be modified or deleted because it’s required by macOS.\".\nI also tried the suggestion in the thread of restoring my /Library/Dictionaries folder, but I can't find it anywhere on my built-in hard drive or my backups.\nUpdate 2: I disabled System Integrity Protection as described here, and looked in my /System/Library/Assets folder, and most of the stuff was missing. I hope I didn't mess up anything. I managed to copy the com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX folder from my Time Machine backup, and it seems like it didn't fix anything. I restarted my laptop and triple-tapped on a word, and the Dictionary app came up and said it was preparing the downloadable dictionaries (or something similar; I don't remember exactly), which gave me some hope, but after that finished, the same things were happening (\"No Local Dictionary Available\", usual dictionaries not showing). I restored my /System/Library/Assets folder from my latest backup (from before the upgrade), re-enabled System Integrity Protection, and restarted my laptop again. My Dictionary app is still broken.\nUpdate 3: I created a new user account and logged in with it to see if the dictionary worked. It was still broken.\n\nA: I think it's worth trying a reinstallation of Catalina. I've reinstalled macOS countless times to solve odd issues like this and while it may seem extreme, it's quite safe and often the simplest and quickest option.\nMake sure the machine is backed up, then restart into the Recovery partition by holding down Cmd-R at startup, then reinstall the OS. It shouldn't take very long and you can set it going overnight or another convenient time.\nYour files and settings shouldn't be affected by the reinstallation, but backing up is always sensible in case of (very rare) errors.\nIf this doesn't work, as a last resort you can try a clean install, and then restore from Time Machine backup, being mindful of @Yoan's warning about mixing Time Machine backups.\n\nA: Follow the instructions given below if it doesn't help then do reply so we can work on this together\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Launchpad or Spotlight search Dictionary and launch the app\n\n*When you are in the dictionary app open Preferences ( Command + , )\n\n3.Tick on the desired dictionaries if they appear\n 4.If they don't click on file in menu bar when you are in the dictionary app\n   and open dictionaries folder\nyou will see \nCoreDataUbiquitySupport\n\nReply with its contents for further discussion...\n\nA: I started my Dictionary app, and it started downloading the dictionaries I had before, and after that, it started working. I have no idea why this happened, or why it didn't work all the other times I started the app.\nEdit: the Dictionary app works, but triple-tapping still gives me the \"No Local Dictionary Available\" error.\nEdit 2: I restarted Chrome, and now the dictionary popup is working everywhere. I hope I fixed it for real now.\n", "Q: Can’t Install Mac OS X Leopard/Snow Leopard on 2007 iMac A while ago, I upgraded the processor and RAM on my mid-2007 iMac so I could install macOS High Sierra. It now has an Intel Core 2 Duo Processor T9500 and 6 GB of RAM. Both the hardware and software upgrades went fine, but after using it for a while, I realized that the computer was much slower than before. Additionally, I didn’t like the iOS-inspired feel of High Sierra. Because of this, I decided to downgrade to Mac OS X Snow Leopard. I backed up my files, got my Snow Leopard Install DVD, and booted up the iMac. However, right after the language selection page, the installer read:\n\nMac OS X can’t be installed on this computer.\n\nI opened disk utility and formatted the hard drive in case that was causing the issue, but I received the same error. I would have tried my Leopard install DVD, but it is an upgrade disk, not an install disk. So, I got out the factory restore disks to install Mac OS X Tiger. This installer ran successfully, and the computer worked fine after the installation. However, when I put in the Leopard upgrade DVD, I got the same error. Same with the Snow Leopard install DVD. I have tried every solution I could find; resetting the PRAM, formatting the hard drive, updating all my software, etc. Nothing works. The only thing I didn’t try was bypassing the hardware check in the installer for two reasons: (1) I don’t know if it will be the same for an Intel iMac as it is for a PowerPC Mac, and (2) It is incredibly difficult to get the required files on the iMac since Tiger doesn’t support TLS 1.2. I suspect that the issue was the CPU upgrade. Should I try this solution, or is there something else? If the bypass is the way to go, is there a simple way to download XAR from the iMac? I have been trying to get this to work for weeks and it’s been incredibly frustrating.\n\nA: OK, I just found out that the installer recognizes my processor speed as 800MHz for some reason. To fix it, the hardware check must be bypassed, same as would be done on a PowerPC model.\n", "Q: Does Keychain support importing a PKCS12 certificate encrypted with AES256?

As you can see in the picture, there is a big gap between the arrow -> that is preceding the tilde ~, which didn't exist before. (This is zoomed in 200%, use block cursor for scale.)\nIs there a way to change the size of icons in the terminal?\n\n\nA: It looks like the arrow is actually text, printed by your shell as part of the prompt. As far as I know, Terminal is restricted to a single text size throughout the window, so you can't really resize the arrow without resizing everything else as well. You could try to comb through the font for a bigger-looking arrow.\nAs for the spaces, there seems to be an explicit space character after the arrow, and then another before the colour-changing sequences in your prompt. You could always remove those to make things a bit tighter.\nYou also have a couple of seemingly empty %{...%} constructs in there. That makes me suspect that there are actually some unprintable characters there, probably containing some terminal control codes, possibly to put some text, like a clock, somewhere else in the window. It is possible that those unprintable characters are somehow generating unwanted spaces.\nIt looks like you might want to read up on how the prompt generation in zsh works. This is documented in the zshmisc man page, which you can reach by running man zshmisc (for the top-level documentation, run man zsh).\n", "Q: How to save text to speech as a voice recording? say \"Hello World\"\n\nis pretty neato, but it requires the terminal to stay open.

I have a desktop Mac and I would like to work with it in different rooms without moving the Mac around. I am currently collecting options, this is information I gathered so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*AirPlay won't help me since it can't control the Mac.\n\n*The SteamLink software on a RaspPi would be able to stream the desktop, however I doubt very much it is able to transmit gestures from my Magic TrackPad.\n\n*Apple Remote Desktop could do it (I can run it on a MBP) but is targeted at sysadmins and not for regular, 8h/day work. I have no idea how responsive it is and I'm not entirely sure if it sends all TrackPad gestures to the remote Mac instead of acting locally on them. Also, the price tag is rather hefty.\n\n*Generic VNC does not seem to support gestures according to this question.\n\n\nAre there any other options?\n\nA: I'm working from home on an iMac, accessing two iMacs at our office through a VPN, and I'm using the \"Screen Sharing\" app that comes with Macs by default (at least up to Mojave) and is located in /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications (again in Mojave, I think they have moved it around depending on the version). I have my home computer with five Spaces, one work computer with four Spaces and a second work computer with just one Space.\nIt works pretty well, but any gestures that work with Mission Control or switch between applications are caught by the machine you are physically working on.\nAs a workaround, I've been putting the Mission Control application on each remote computer's dock, so I can bring it up manually and switch between Spaces, etc. on the remote computers. The keyboard ⌘ Command ⇨Tab does seem to work in that it switches between applications on the remote computer, so that might be a workaround for swiping between apps.\n\nA: ARD is your best bet. Although geared for Admins with large deployments, it'll work just fine for what you want. I used it for quite some time as a Mac sysadmin. As for Trackpad gestures, I used ARD only on a iMac with a mouse, so I'm not sure what will happen. Just my $.02.\n\nA: I use Jump - to work remotely on Mac and Windows machines as well as to provide remote assistance to clients. I've been using it for years and love it. (http://jumpdesktop.com).

And will this means that to use this feature the host MacBook Pro will have to be opened whenever the other Macs are used to use this feature?\n\nA: macOS Content Caching works by caching, on your Mac, requests to Apple servers from all Apple devices on your network. It was moved from Apple's Server app to be included as an integral part of macOS starting with High Sierra. You can see caching statistics on Activity Monitor > Cache.\nIt works best when the caching computer is always on, particularly because client devices take a while to detect the caching server and start using it, but the server can run on any Mac. This detection is automatic for your local network, although you can configure specific rules for it.\nYou can also force client devices to detect the cache server immediately by restarting them or, if they're Macs, by running AssetCacheLocatorUtil on Terminal. The devices may stop using your caching server (and download directly from Apple) if they see it as unhealthy (down, non-responsive, or too slow). Each device decides this on its own so some client devices may see your caching server as healthy whereas others might see it as unhealthy.\nIt does take up storage space, however macOS by default will not count the cached data towards your used storage on  > About this Mac > Storage and, as far as I remember, will automatically purge old cache data when you try to use it for other purposes (such as copying files or installing apps).\nTo sum it up, you will probably not have \"low space\" problems, however, if you don't leave your Mac turned on for long stretches of time, you will possibly have little benefit of having it enabled.\n\nA: Set it up and don’t worry is my advice. The default settings work almost all the time.\nIf you worry about space, when you have some data (activity monitor will graph usage and size pressure once it’s enabled) you could optionally limit space.\n\nYou can choose the amount of storage your Mac uses for cached content.\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac, choose Apple menu  > System Preferences, click Sharing, then select Content Caching.\n\n*Click Options. Use the slider to set the cache size, or enter a value in the text field and use the pop-up menu to choose the units (MB, GB, TB, or PB).\n\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/set-up-content-caching-on-mac-mchl3b6c3720/mac\n", "Q: Sharing folders on iCloud with non-iCloud users Catalina I have a folder on my iCloud and in the beginning I shared it with edit rights to anyone who has the link, then it asked them to have an iCloud account, so then I thought may be because I set it as editable.

Because it also doesn't contain options I know: \n-autohide-time-modifier \n-autohide-delay\n-tilesize\n-mcx-expose-disabled\n\nWhere I can I find the full list Dock preferences?\n\nA: Apple does not publish this and it’s considered the equivalent of a private API for developers. When Apple wants to test a new feature, they first expose it with hidden switches and then after it’s been tested and doesn’t cause issues, then it may become an official setting. Until it’s publicly documented, these change from build to build and sometimes can cause things to not work.\nThe only listing of these is by people who disassemble the code and then publish their work. You’re not missing any resource here, as this is undocumented and doesn’t always stay stable, so the effort to document these is quite high from a labor perspective.\n\nA: Some options are available by going to the Dock under System Preferences.

I have two sources of internet, \n\nI want to combine both the internet sources and get increased speed.\nI have noticed by testing, I can either use Ethernet internet or the Wifi Internet at one time, but by default both don't combine.\n\nA: What you're referring to is called Internet Bonding.\nYou can't simply turn on two different Internet connections and have everything work - you need an intermediary whether it be a dedicated router or 3rd party software to properly manage the packets as they split between the two connections and then have them reassemble back on the other end.  \nIt's very similar to Link Aggregation but instead of being internal where your host (computer) and switch must support it, you must have an ISP or a 3rd party service that will do this for you.\nHere's a few companies that do Internet bonding:\n\n\n*\n\n*Speedify \n\n*XRoads Networks\n\n*ZifiLink (3G, 4G, LTE bonding)\n\n\nNormally, this is done at the Enterprise level where a router can have multiple WAN connections (I did this with 3Com/HP and Cisco gear) or in remote location where broadband was more expensive than multiple cellular data networks.  \nAs for software, there's\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenMCTC Router\n\n*pfSense Multiple WAN connections\nIn these instances, you're acting as the bonding service provider.  Given that it's available on pfSense which is the same firewall that macOS uses (pf) it's conceivable that you can bond multiple Internet connections using the built in firewall.\n", "Q: Stop installing python for each package by brew I have installed python on Mac by Anaconda.

For instance, I wanted to install the gdb (GNU Debugger) via Homebrew, but it said that python is one of the requirements and then it installed it again.\nHow can I stop downloading and installing python for every package?\n\nA: The nice thing about homebrew is it only installs dependencies needed to build the packages and also that you don’t have to choose just one version of a tool.\nWhy not let brew install what it needs, but control your path so that you’re running Anaconda from the python you prefer?\nAlso, brew has a cask install of anaconda as well, so that might be an easier path to harmony if you can’t get away from the homebrew installs for tools.\n", "Q: What is the fastest/most efficient way to transfer 50GB data folder from SSD to thumb drive?

For example, I would de-frag a hard drive before a data-transfer in the olden-days when computers were steam powered.\n… Or, does it matter since the bottleneck is the USB flash drive?\n\nA: Bluetooth, WiFi and your screen have absolutely nothing to do with the transfer speed of USB.  Tweaking these settings in the hopes of making USB transfers more efficient is like waxing your car to get better fuel efficiency.\n\nThe thumb drive is a garden variety of 64GB Lexar™\n\nIs it a USB 2.0 or 3.0 thumb drive?  You can tell if it has a blue tab in the USB connector. That'll be the kicker.  If it's a 2.0, the maximum throughput you're going to get is 480Mbps.  Going downhill. With a tailwind. On greased skis.\nIf it's USB 3, you'll get at most 5x the rate of 2.0, but more like only 3x. \nAs far as defragging your drive, that won't make any difference on an SSD with HFS+ format.

I am looking for a way to video record my iPad's screen while a Netflix video playback is in progress.\nIs it possible to do while using the Netflix iPadOS app? Or do I have to use Chrome browser?\n\nA: \nHow do I record the iPad screen with a Netflix video playback in progress?\n\nThis is generally not a possible thing to do.\nCapturing contents of the device screen by taking a screenshot or video recording is restricted programmatically in the iOS/iPadOS subsystem to curb on abusing the system.\nYou can neither do it while using a streaming app which provides access to protected content, nor by using a Web browser.\nConsider going through these links which should give you some idea:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46319665/ios-11-prevent-screen-record-like-netflix\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1970/_index.html \nNetflix app has been programmed (using the help of iOS/iPadOS subsystem APIs) to curtail users from taking screenshot or record screen to keep a tab on potential gaming of the system. A screenshot or video recording would simply produce a black screen to discourage users from doing so.\n\nA: First, you need to turn on AssistiveTouch, on your iPad, from the  Accessibility screen under Settings.  Once this is turned on a small gray circle appears on all your iPad screens.  You can take a screenshot using AssistiveTouch.  Taping on the gray circle opens a pane with 6 options. Tap on Device and another 6 options appear. Tap on More and another 6 options appear. The option in the top right corner is to take a screenshot. Tap that button and a screenshot will be taken. None of the panes associated with AssistiveTouch will appear in the screenshot.\nI just tested this and it works fine.  I started AssistiveTouch and then went to Netflix.  A small gray circle appeared on my screen. You can move it to wherever you want by just dragging it with your finger. Then I went thru the panes until I got to the screenshot icon and took my shot. it worked well.\nThis may sound like a cumbersome way of getting a screenshot but after going thru it once it becomes a breeze.\nThis is needed since the fast way to screenshot Netflix is blocked perhaps to slow us down making still images of a movie that theoretically or actually is copyright protected or licensed. \n", "Q: Cannot access external drive I have a seagate 2013 or 2014 external hard drive which has been working fine up until yesterday.

I presume it's been sat on a shelf for some period of time and has drained, but I can't imagine that it's actually dead at only 35 cycles.\n\nThere's a number of things that can be at play here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bad charging circuitry.  The battery is actually good, but power isn't getting to the battery itself.\n\n*A defective battery.  It happens; these are \"man-made\" items and far from perfect.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Won't charge at all\n\n*Won't hold a charge.  Charges but dissipates quickly (as you describe).  This is due to a bad cell.\n\n*Reduced charging capacity\n\n\n*Wrong charger.  It's entirely possible you got a charger with too low a wattage rating.  \n\n\nGiven that you've stated it won't hold a charge, it's likely a defective battery.  Pretty much the only thing you can do is reset the SMC.  The NVRAM has nothing to do with power issues and reinstalling macOS should only be used as a last resort.\nHowever since this is a new purchase, your best option is to return it rather than try to fix it.  It came to you with an issue - the seller should deal with it and it doesn't speak highly to their quality controls.

So, it looks like the space  is actually not released, and I have to find the Recycle Bin on different volumes and then delete the files. \nThat is kind of manual and low level and is hard to manage.  Is there a way to do it in the Dashboard or configure it so that it really is \"delete immediately\"?\nP.S. I just found, what's more, if I move some files between Shares in the same NAS -- note that it is \"moving\", then the NAS actually decrease in storage, and I found the file in the Recycle Bin... so it is like a copy and delete. This makes it even harder to manage.\nP.S. I found out Recycle Bin seems to be on a \"per share\" level, meaning each share can be configured to have a recycle bin or not.  If there is no recycle bin, then the file is immediately deleted and space released.\n\nA: This is not new and many NAS boxes have this feature.  It's just a method to provide for recovery, in addition to backup. \n\nI have to find the Recycle Bin on different volumes and then delete the files? That is kind of manual and low level and is hard to manage. Is there a way to do it in the Dashboard or configure it so that it really is \"delete immediately\"?\n\nFrom your Apple (SMB) client?  No.  This is no more different that connecting to a friends MacBook via a shared folder and deleting a file.  You would have no access to empty their trash.\nWhy?  Because the inherent property of a NAS is sharing and usually by more than one person.  For instance, if we both deleted files from a NAS and you realized you needed it back, you wouldn't appreciate me emptying the trash of your things.\nHowever, emptying of the Trash doesn't have to be a manual process.  FreeNAS, and my Synology NAS both have a feature for both manually emptying the trash as well as setting up a schedule to do so.  Here's a screen grab from my personal Synology:\n\nCheck your NAS documentation to see if you can set a schedule for when the trash gets emptied.\n\nWhat's more, if I move some files between Shares in the same NAS -- note that it is \"moving\", then the NAS actually decrease in storage, and I found the file in the Recycle Bin... so it is like a copy and delete. This makes it even harder to manage.\n\nYes, especially so if you're doing it from an SMB client like your MacBook.  A move is, in fact, a copy and delete.  This is not a fault of of the OS - macOS on your client and Linux (likely) on the NAS.  It's just a reality of SAMBA. \nWhile I absolutely love my NAS for the convenience it brings, I try not to do any massive file operations from my client device.  Instead I will log in either via the web interface or via SSH so that a move (mv is actually a move and not a copy/delete).  In effect, I bypass SAMBA for these operations.  \n", "Q: How to convert an epub file to pdf from the command line? I want to convert a few .epub files into .pdf files (no merge, just convert file_1.epub to file_1.pdf, file_2.epub to file_2.pdf, ...) and was wondering if there was a way to streamline the process using the Mac command line.\nHeard about the Calibre application but this is not what I am looking for as I want to use the command line.\n\nA: Calibre has a command line interface, see this part of the manual.

I need to use a VPN on my mac from time to time. While I'm doing so, it interferes with  the ability to use AirDrop and Sidecar. My VPN has the ability to whitelist certain apps, so is there a collection of 'apps' that AirPlay and/or Sidecar uses?\nI think Sidecar doesn't work with a wired connection when the VPN is on. I've tried whitelisting e.g. Finder but that's not enough, I'm not sure what else could be useful.\n\nA: VPN can be set up to be compatible with both sidecar and airdrop.\nThe process of installing some VPN also can and will break these both if desired or they are targeted for blocking. The details matter of the network setup since macOS can have multiple networks assigned to one physical interface and software like VPN and admin control over networking can also block these transmissions.\n\nA: (This solved my similar issue with Airdrop, not tested Sidecar yet.)\nI do not have VPN at router but on individual devices, so VPN broke my iCloud copy/paste and airdrop. It may be because they were not \"sharing\" the same wifi network anymore, as in, they had two different data tunnels, and the only solution I found was to deploy VPN at router or to turn off VPN.\nI dig Mullvad VPN Mac app preferences, and found that there is an option to enable \"Local network sharing\" that allows local network access to connected devices.

I'm using a 2017 i5 Macbook Pro with just 128GB of storage and need to run Revit, which is Windows only. I know there are many different methods for running Windows programs on Mac, but with very limited storage and the processing used by Revit, I'm trying to determine the smallest Windows environment with the least overhead. My preference would be for something that can run without a reboot or logoff (though I'm aware this will sacrifice some performance). \nWhat is the smallest and/or fastest way to run Windows programs on MacOS?\n\nA: In order of “size” your options are as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Wine.  (It’s unclear this will be updated to run well on Catalina but Wine does well on Mojave and below)\n\n*Virtualizaton (VirtualBox, VMWare Fusion, Parallels)\n\n*Boot Camp which helps you run windows on the Mac hardware directly without macOS running at the same time.\n\nWine is a “compatability layer” that allows you to run Windows apps on a POSIX compliant operating system (macOS, BSD, Linux, etc).  The Wine acronym actually stood for “Wine Is Not an Emulator”.  In terms of size, there’s nothing smaller since you’re not installing a full Windows install - there’s no Windows environment - just the application.\nVirtualization.  This is the next level up where you have a full blown operating system.  Virtualization allows you to customize the machine itself and make it as small as possible (i.e. the minimum system requirements).  Some applications don’t function well in Wine so this is the next best thing.  Most type 2 hypervisors are going to be roughly the same in “size” however, I am looking into xhyve which is a very lightweight hypervisor based on FreeBSD’s bhyve hypervisor.\nBoot Camp is going to be the largest in terms of size because it’s quite literally a full Widows installation on “bare metal”. It also forces you to give up an entire chunk of your drive to windows where virtualization can share free space with macOS.\n", "Q: How can I get a list of potential methods for DefaultKeyBinding.dict?

This is the most comprehensive list of methods I have found.  It is the oldest snapshot of osxnotes.net, now down, on the wayback machine (so they may have updated it before it was taken down).

This is my primary email, and it has worked before. I even tried with both @me and @icloud.com but it will not accept any of them.\n\nA: I spoke with Apple Support.

I told about my workaround to use iPhone to login, and changing the ID from @me.com to @icloud.com.\nThey were not able to help me switch back from @icloud to @me as my primary id. It might be because some days between changes are needed. They said I could still logon both with the primary and secondary id, and that it did not have any major consequences. So we closed the issue without further investigation. Now, several months later I tried to change back to @me.com as my primary id for curiosity.

The title pretty much sums it up but I need a way to disable Turboboost and Hyper-Threading. I am currently on macOS Catalina and I am able to edit system files because I have SIP disabled. I am ok with the solution not being permanent (meaning that it resets upon reboot). I have used https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6262465 as a reference and it didn't work for me. Most of these solutions on the internet have stopped working after OS X Yosemite.\nPlease only answer this question if you will be providing a solution, not telling me to leave hyper-threading on.\nBy the way, this question is not a duplicate because most other question only ask how to do it on OS X Yosemite and below when Apple had tools to do this.\n\nA: I found a way to do this.

My disk in my iMac, High Sierra is about full. The biggest culprit by far is the /User/myname/Library folder which is taking up 96 GB. Since I have over 100 GB of icloud storage could I move the Library folder to the icloud drive and create a link? How do I do that so iMac still can access the Library.  If this is a stupid question I apologize.\nOmniDiskSweeper says ~/Library is 73.9 GB. Don't know where the other 22 GB went.  From OmniDisksweeper the storage hogs in ~/Library are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Application Support - 20 GB with MobileSync being the major player\n\n*Containers - 18 GB  with com.apple.mail being the major player\n\n*Mobile Documents - 18 GB with com~apple~CloudDocs being the hog.\n\n\nA: No. \nFirstly, relying on an internet connection to access preferences, caches, and other system/user 'working' files is likely to be problematic. As mentioned in the comments, iCloud is handled locally by a folder in the user Library, so having this itself in iCloud might be confusingly recursive.\nIt's worth checking whether all of that 96 Gb is necessary: it may include iPhone or iPad backups, which are frequent culprits for taking up space. Use an app like OmniDiskSweeper to search the library, sorted by size. That will show you what is taking the space, and you can then make a decision about whether it can be moved or deleted. \n\nA: The only way to do this would be to disable SIP first.\nAnd then when you reboot into normal mode, you'll find a lot of things broken.\nBut there are probably things in ~/Library that can be deleted.

So my girlfriend has this setup with her Apple IDs, where she has one Apple ID as her primary, with which she is logged into iCloud on all her devices, and she also has a second Apple ID which she only uses as an email account.\nI would rather like to streamline this whole setup by migrating the email address of the secondary Apple ID to the primary.\nI do know that it is not possible to simply merge the two Apple IDs, but I thought there may be a way to migrate an email address. The emails associated with that address wouldn't even have to be migrated over since I can do that manually within Outlook.\n\nA: No - Apple doesn’t split the mail accounts or aliases - once one is associated with one account, there’s no releasing it or migrating it or reassigning it. I’ve tried twice to do this with support and it got escalated to engineering both times.\nThe answer was no - set up forwarding or make a new mail account. Maybe this changes, but Apple treats an email associated with an AppleID in any way as unmovable. The only time I’ve had any relenting from that stance was for rescue and security emails. I argued that then can’t tie my external address to one AppleID since I may choose to move to a new ID for the reasons they explicitly designed. \nIf you control the @ domain - you can have some measure of moving, but I wouldn’t assume you could move it on to a new account - just that you could discard it and never use it on the new account if we’re talking about the AppleID and not a secondary mail.\nIf in doubt, get in writing from Apple before you change that they confirm it will be reversible.

Rich Text emails show up with Times New Roman font on Windows Outlook clients. Mail does not set a font type, Thus, Windows Outlook uses its default paragraph formatting which falls back to Times New Roman. It's so unprofessional and embarrassing\nUsing plain text seems to be the only solution. Big downside: No bolding, no highlighting. This has been an ongoing issue since years. There used to be a great plugin called Universal Mailer which is no longer developed. \nAny workaround for Apple Mail Mojave and Catalina? I highly appreciate any solution.\n\nA: People who send plain text mails are heroes to me. There’s no downside there since it respects everyone including screen readers, people who have a font and size preference, etc...\nThere is a real cost to rtf bloat and html and you are seeing some of that pain here.  My solution is to eschew bu to know some people look down on that as plain text can be rendered horribly as well by some Mail clients. \nSadly, you have to read the room for your intended audience and choose an authoring tool that is copacetic. A third party mail app might be needed if no one has a style tweak that lets you keep the styling features you know you need to communicate effectively. Outlook on Mac does a decent job of hiding that the mail came from Apple if you have the desire to try that. \n\nA: If you want the recipient to see your chosen font and other styling, you can achieve this in Mail by setting it individually for each outgoing message, or perhaps by saving it as \"stationery\" to use as a template.  If you want to be able to set this for all outgoings by default, the solution is to use another email client like Outlook.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro / OS X Lion 5 years ago broke my laptop, finally got it repaired but, forgot all my passwords !

I would like to prevent that, if that is possible (I do not want to upload all 10K+ photos from iPhone to iCloud).\n\nA: iCloud is a syncing service an not a backup service.  \nThat means that every device logged-in with the same Apple ID will have access to the same files, including photos.  \nThere's no way to do the selective download that you're asking for.  Either you sync your photos to your iPhone or you continue to selectively download the photos you need.\nOther possibilities include not using iCloud for this and using a 3rd party backup service like Dropbox.\n\nA: The Apple camera app will not let you set up iCloud and download only. However, you don’t have to use the apple camera app to take pictures. It would work fine to set up iCloud and allow sync both ways and just never take a photo from your lock screen / control center / Apple app.\nPick any third party camera that saves the photos to the sandbox / local storage and doesn’t automatically move the photos to iCloud.\nIn your case, you would have to move all those photos out of the Photo Roll before you enable sync else they will upload.\n", "Q: Is it possible to upgrade my Time Capsule hard disk and keep the backup(s) from the original?

Prior to this, all displays were assumed to operate at 72 pixels per inch (ppi). Prior to that, if you wanted the main Mac menu bar to be 3/8\" high, you would simply multiply 3/8 by 72 to set how tall the element is.\nWhy do I bring this up? Because with this foundation in place, Apple rolled out retina displays with DPIs approaching 300 ppi. Your display is one of these and indeed has a Fixed dpi of 2560x1600 (per specs). The underlying resolution independence ensures that the UI elements display at a consistent size across resolutions, screen sizes, and pixel densities.\nIn summary, from my understanding:\n\n*\n\n*Your Screen's resolution is fixed at 2560x1600px (see note below)\n\n*Your \"virtual\" resolution is set in displays preferences, and you have it set to \"look like\" 1440x900\n\n*\"Full Screen\" screenshots (⌘-⇪-3) appear to capture in \"native\" display resolution.

I have a 2012 Mac Pro 5,1, running El Capitan.  I wish to make it a dual-boot system, El Capitan and Mojave.  I understand that I must install High Sierra preliminary to Mojave, and must install a \"metal\"-capable graphics card (I've purchased, but not yet installed, a Sapphire PULSE Radeon RX 580).\nI have my El Capitan system on a 240GB SSD; user directories are on a separate HDD.  I've created a 2nd partition on the SSD and done a clean install of High Sierra there.   The installer made it an APFS volume, so when I am booted into El Capitan, I cannot select High Sierra as my Startup Disk (El Capitan cannot \"see\" the APFS volume in System Prefs).  I can select High Sierra using the Startup Manager (⌥ Option during startup). But my understanding is that once I install the new GPU (prior to upgrading to Mojave) that the Startup Manager will not work (no boot screen)  Thus, once I boot into El Capitan, there is no way to then boot into High Sierra.\nIs it possible to resolve this?  I've read that it's possible to install High Sierra on an HFS+ partition, but not Mojave.  Perhaps I can live with High Sierra and Mojave as my two boot options instead, if I can get my older apps to work on High Sierra?  But even then, without a boot screen, it's impossible to get to recovery disks etc (what happens if the boot drive fails?).  Is the only option to obtain a GPU that supports the boot screen?  Apparently macvidcards.com sell such cards and could modify mine, but they appear very sketchy, from searches I've done. \nEDIT: This post may partially be a wild-goose chase - my apologies. I've determined I can probably run all my apps under High Sierra (and possibly under Mojave) - I was mistaken/confused originally - so it's looking like I may not need to boot ElCap anymore.  But there may be other users who do need to, so I still think it's a discussion worth having.   However, the boot-screen issue remains - in particular being able to boot from recovery partitions or external media.\n\nA: One possible solution is to install rEFInd Boot Manager. This is free software which can be configured many different ways. Below is a suggested configuration.\nBy default, rEFInd installs in the EFI partition. You can then configure rEFInd to either boot El Capitan or Mojave. The default operating system to boot can be set directly from the operating system. There is simple AppleScript application you can download which will do this. As example of the application is shown below.\n\n\nA: Very late to the party.\nBut maybe this can help someone.\nI had the same dilemma a while back on my CMP 5,1. My solution was to Install Sierra ( which runs all the old El Capitan stuff.

My SSD is 1 TB, but is only 775 GB, the same as it used to be.\nWhat happened to this extra space and how can I get it back?\n\nA: This definitley sounds like your partition wasn't completely removed. Please note that the best way to get rid of a BootCamp Partition is to go to BootCamp Assistant and remove it. \nThe first step you should try is opening BootCamp Assistant and then checking if you can merge the partitions so that all the data on Windows is destroyed and the space used is merged with the macOS partition.\nIf that doesn't work, go to Disk Utility and run First Aid on the SSD (APPLE SSD SM0120G Media or whatever your SSD is called). Then, click on your APFS container and extend the disk space available for it. Then you might also need to make sure that Macintosh HD occupies all of the Container Disk.\nIf that doesn't work, you can try running First Aid in Safe Mode and macOS Recovery.\nIf you prefer, you can use diskutil repairDisk in Terminal with or instead of First Aid.\nLink for using Safe Mode:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262\nLink for using macOS Recovery:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314\n", "Q: Was the Haptic engine included as part of the iPhone's Home Button ever made available for use by developers?

At the time, mentions were made of using this new version of the Home Button to deliver notification alerts, as well as an API being introduced to allow developers to interact with the Haptic engine within the button (see https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/7/12828652/apple-iphone-7-home-button-removed-force-touch for more details). Just out of interest, was this API ever made available to developers - and if so, are there any examples of apps that made use of it?\n\nA: Yes, Apple made that API available in iOS 10 (released in 2016).

I was hoping if someone can help me out. I'm using Catalina and trying to get the PHP extension mcrypt installed. I've been trying to use homebrew and I'm seriously stuck. I've researched this like crazy and all the forums are years old or using Ubuntu. I realize that mcrypt is deprecated but Laravel requires it so here I am.\nI installed PHP 7.4 using homebrew. I had to add a couple of path lines to my ~/.zshrc file because the terminal kept saying PHP was 7.3. I run brew install mcrypt and it downloads and \"Pours\" into /usr/local/Cellar/mcrypt/2.6.8.

Say I'm listening to music through the Spotify desktop client and I pause the music there and go to watch a video on Youtube. I expect to hear the video from the headphones, but I won't, because somehow the headphones think there is no audio signal. Once I unpause Spotify, I can hear both the music and the browser but pausing the music will again mute the browser. The browser is in fact playing the content with audio and is not muted, but the headphones are somehow locked to Spotify. So the only solution would be to either kill Spotify, or set it to play but mute it so that I can only hear Youtube (which is what I usually do because opening and closing it is too sluggish). If I choose to close Spotify, sometimes the headphones still won't play anything until I pause/unpause from the second application.\nThis tends to happen with any pair of applications that both play audio and I'm not sure if it's an OS X bug or related to the headphone's firmware. The same does not happen with Apple's own AirPods but I don't have access to another non-Apple pair of wireless headphones to test. It also doesn't happen when connecting the same set of wireless headphones (or any other) through the 3.5mm jack or while using the speakers.\nHas anyone experienced similar issues, with these particular model or another wireless headphone and if there is a fix?\n\nA: Heyho i have the same problem with the same Headset.\nI found this in a Spotify forum:\nThere is a fix everyone!\nJust go to Edit -> preferences -< Display options and disable \"Show desktop overlay when using media keys\"\nThis fixed my issue atleast\n\nFor me it did not help...even worse... i'm more confused. After disable this Options the browser works, but the Ingam-Spund mutes.\n\nA: OK! I figured out what is going on. The Amiron Wireless firmware seems to turn off the headphone when the media state is paused which is caused by the HardwareMediaKeyHandling on any host app. You can inspect this phenomenon when you have a touch bar with media keys, as you can see the playing and paused states as you start and stop audio sources like YouTube videos or Spotify tracks.\nLet's say you have two YouTube videos played, your media state is playing. If you pause one video the state will switch to paused despite the fact that another YouTube video is still playing. The same happens on Spotify and any other app. As soon as you switch to another app that leverages the HardwareMediaKeyHandling and pause the audio there, the media state will switched to paused, because HardwareMediaKeyHandling only supports one application tangled at the same time. Your YouTube videos are still playing, but the state is paused. It's not a well-thought design by Apple. The HardwareMediaKeyHandling can only be tied to one app at the same time.\nThe Amiron Wireless headset output seems to be tied to the media key state very strict, thus the headset stops its output as soon as the media key state switches to pause and only starts when it goes back into playing. I don't know why Beyerdynamics decided to silent the headset when the media state switches to pause, maybe to spare battery, but it's a terrible decision. My temporary fix always was to stop and restart the not working audio source. Now it makes sense why this worked, because the media state was switched from paused to playing in that process and the headset would pass-through audio again.\nSo what is the fix? Simply disable HardwareMediaKeyHandling in all the applications that have audio sources, although it will mean that the hardware media keys will not work anymore, which is a shame.\nIn Chrome, I would go to chrome://flags/#hardware-media-key-handling and set it to disable. Now I can pause a video without stopping audio output. For Spotify, there is no way to do it, yet.\nEDIT: Re-reading your question, it seems that you already did that, or you could revive your headset by pressing play on a YouTube video. After disabling HardwareMediaKeyHandling my state is the very same to yours. You could enable HardwareMediaKeyHandling to have the ability to revive your headset on YouTube without killing or muting Spotify. It's no solution for me though. I'm after disabling HardwareMediaKeyHandling system-wide to get rid of this problem altogether at this point.\n", "Q: Other data taking up to much space on mac, can't figure out what this other data is I found out my company's dropbox was syncing everything to my mac, I had selective sync on but somehow this changed.

The fastest port on this machine seems to be the Thunderbolt 2 interface at 20Gbp/s.  Are there any drives that would get anywhere near that?  \nIt seems like the SSD in a 2015 MBP would be limited to about 2.2Gbps write speed so does it make sense to try to get anything faster than that?\nIs a 3.1 USB thumb drive good enough or would a standard SATA III SSD drive work faster?\nI just did a 150 GB Time Machine restore which took 9 hours.  Is there a way to make it faster than that?\n\nA: \nThe fastest port on this machine seems to be the Thunderbolt 2 interface at 20Gbps. Are there any drives that would get anywhere near that? \n\nChances are very unlikely.  Why?  Several reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Thunderbolt 2 has been deprecated in favor of Thunderbolt 3 since late 2015.  The market for these devices were small to begin with and is shrinking more quickly with each passing day.\n\n*You didn't say specifically what you're restoring from but suffice to say the commonly accepted media is an external hard drive. Assuming it is a SATA III drive, the throughput will be at most 6Gb/s \n\n*Even if you were to connect two Macs with a Thunderbolt 2/3 port and get a full 20Gb/s , you're still limited by the speed of the drive on which you did the backup\n\n*There are no USB 3.1 (or what is now known as 3.2 Gen 2) adapters or devices in the market; they were never manufactured.  Why?  USB 3.1 was introduced alongside Thunderbolt 3.  The most you'll get is USB 3.0 (or 3.2 Gen 1); 5Gb/s throughput.\nThe fastest devices in order would be the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Thunderbolt to SATA enclosure like the Lacie Thunderbolt Drive or G-Drive.  The Thunderbolt 1/2 versions of these drives are discontinued so you'll have to find them on eBay or similar sites.  \n\n*USB 3.0 to SATA adapter or similar enclosure.  This will give you the 5Gb/s throughput; closest to the 6Gb/s SATA III throughput.\n\n\n\nIs a 3.1 USB thumb drive good enough or would a standard SATA3 SSD drive work faster?\n\nGet it for the \"future proofing\" and get it for the fact it's solid state and less components to fail, but as for throughput, you'll never see it.\n\nA: A decent device would be any USB 3.1 external SSD, such as the Samsung T5, benchmarked at c. 500 MB/s.  The X5 is a Thunderbolt model with much higher speeds (c. 2,500 MB/s), but much more expensive. Speed is not usually crucial for backups, as a complete restore is hopefully a rarity.\nIt's usually recommended to choose a backup drive that is 2 or 3 times the size of your source disk.\nThumb drives are often not very fast, nor reliable for long-term backup storage. \nBear in mind that you will not always achieve 'test-score' speeds in real world use, as copying lots of small files takes longer than copying one large one.\n", "Q: How to force a new app to be placed on the main home screen section (iPad 6) Specs: 2018 Ipad 6, latest iOS\nWhen installing a new app, the app is sent to a new section of the home screen.\nI prefer to have all my apps on a single home screen.\nHow do I force the app to be installed by default on the only section of the home screen instead of creating a new one?\n\nA: You cannot force that to happen.\nHowever, you can move the app after installation.

My problem is latency and quality.\niShow or Soundflower results in latency to my ears, which means I can't play my pieces properly. Loopback offers a better alternative, because it patches the sound directly from Ableton, meaning that within Ableton I still use MOTU as input and output, therefore my headphones give me sound without latency. \nBut with Loopback there are 2 issues: 1. It is $100 USD, which is absolutely too much for that and also for my budget. Also, I used it in trial mode before it expired, and I recorded the video from OBS and the sound of it was actually quite bad, a bit compressed and gloomy, very very different from what the Ableton output sounds. \nSo, I'm a bit frustrated because I feel I have tried it all I know, and most of the info online is either very old, or made for Windows or gamers. There's also lots of info for people that stream simple things like a podcasts, but in my case you have to keep in mind I do need to hear myself from Ableton because my instrument is not producing the final sound outcome in my living room.\nHow can I solve this problem of combining several audio channels with OBS's limitation of only 2 while maintaining a quality sound?\nAny ideas appreciated, thank you so much!\n\nA: The problem is, you're tyring to do everything in software.  \nIt's one thing to have separate output, but if OBS limits you to only two channels and your workaround is to use Soundflower to \"mux\" (multiplex) those channels together to conform to OBS, then you're inherently introducing latency.  The sound must be brought in on each separate channel, mixed together, then sent back out on another channel only to be read in by OBS then mixed in that, then output, you're using a tremendous amount of CPU cycles for something that should have been done \"outside\" the OS.\nWhat you need is a mixer (it doesn't need to be fancy) so that you can combine the audio before bringing it into OBS.  You will get much more use and versatility out of the mixer than the software.\n", "Q: Screen on Max Brightness Appears Slightly Dim After Sleeping, MacBook Pro 2015 The issue:\nScreen appears about 2-3 dots dimmer on max brightness after waking from sleep for more than 30 minutes. I only noticed this a few months after upgrading to Catalina, it's been ongoing ever since.\nMy settings:\nNo auto-adjusted brightness, disabled screen temperature modifiers like NightShift/Flux, slightly higher gamma color profile for better contrast/brightness (it looks a bit faded otherwise).\nMy computer:\nMacBook Pro 13\" early 2015 mid-tier model with Catalina 10.15.4. (bought in 2017 used, no repairs or hardware issues the whole year. Great battery cycle life).\nMy Temporary solution:\nResetting the PRAM (cmd + opt + P + R). This fix lasts until I close my laptop and let it sleep overnight usually. Sometimes I've had success reducing the brightness before putting it to sleep. I am not completely sure if this is hardware or software related.\nEdit:\nThere have been rare/infrequent occasions when my display would do weird things after waking from sleep. There was one incident of my display completely blanking out with a white pixelated screen for a moment (like an old static TV out of tune). A few other incidents where the display blinks black or totally freezes. It was at first a problem with video playback and hardware acceleration, but now I am beginning to believe it may be a hardware-related problem (though this Mac doesn't have a graphics card).\nThanks for your time and consideration!\n\nA: Just figured this out for my case.

So there should be absolutely no problem uploading the 197 items that haven't been uploaded yet. Does anyone know what's going on here and how to fix it?\n\nA: *\n\n*Click the Apple menu and select log out. \n\n*If a program is stuck and you can’t log out after saving work, the issue could be your machine was stuck. Reboot and watch the status after a restart. \n\n*If your log out was clean then power off your Mac for 30 minutes. \n\n\nThis lets whatever process runs on the server where Apple stores your documents to time out. Restart. Sometimes I’ve had to wait overnight with my iCloud off but usually this clears in time.

Please direct me to any useful and relevant articles I missed. Also please let me know how to make my post more clear.\nActual behavior: \niPhone XR outputs GPS samples at slow rates, around one sample every 6 seconds, but occasionally with two samples in a more rapid succession (e.g. 1.5 seconds, although very seldomly). This occurs when sitting still, when quickly walking and shaking phone around around, and with various different assignments for CLLocationManager.desiredAccuracy.\nExpected/optimistic behavior:\nQuicker GPS sample outputs from my iPhone XR, like those in this video right here. I am aware that this video is from 2017, although I don't know what makes this significant.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyncTJdXbbw&t=5m20s\nDiscussion:\nI need GPS samples for a project, and I'd ideally like it to be sampled at 1.0+ Hz. I have written programs on Swift and downloaded apps which log and graph my iPhone XR's GPS data, but my sampling rate of my GPS data seems to be inconsistent and very slow, around one measurement every 6 seconds.\nI have a lot of questions, which include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does iPhone XR have a well-defined GPS output rate?\n\n*What factors affect it?\n\n*Where can I find this information better documented?\n\n*How can I increase the output rate of the GPS?\n\n\nI am new to working with iOS as well as knowing through what methods iPhones calculate GPS coordinates. I have heard that iPhone GPS can output data at 1 Hz, although I haven't found this officially documented yet. \nI am aware I can specify the desiredAccuracy and distanceFilter in my Swift program, but the desiredAccuracy parameter seems not to have much effect on my coordinate precision or my output rate. My iPhone XR is on iOS 13.4.1, and my 128 GB phone is almost completely full with photos in case that makes some weird difference. I'm removing those photos just to clean up now.\nI included my Swift program below. It is very basic, and I don't know how to code in Swift, so feel free to inform me if I'm doing things incorrectly. At the last time I ran it successfully (two days ago), my iPhone was on iOs 13.3 or so, Mac OS on 10.13 or so. The Swift program should be as basic as possible, single-view app with storyboard UI. If necessary, I can provide updates on newer OS/iOS/Xcode versions once I clean my phone and get some stuff to work.\nI can't find my console output text file, so I'll upload something once I am able to.

Note that you're not \"communicating\" directly with a GPS, but rather receiving location updates from Core Location that could come from a GPS source, but also from other sources.\nRemember that the location updates are filtered to conserve power. This means that you only get updates when the phone has actually moved a certain distance - and the number of updates can be affected by external factors such as whether or not the phone is set in the power save state. Also remember to test this while outside and moving about. You won't get great positioning indoors.\nYou should ensure to set the distance filter to an appropriate distance for your application (you currently have it set to none), and also to set the correct activity (i.e. you currently have it set to other, but if you want to do for example automotive navigation, then set it to that).\nIn your attached source code, you only look at the first location given to you in didUpdateLocations. You normally don't want to do that. The newest location is the last one in the array, so I would at least change it to look at the last one.\nAs you are interested in having more locations over a time period, remember to look at all the updates in the array. There might be more than one in each update.\n", "Q: Sidecar: use tap gesture as \"click\" with a mouse I'm using Sidecar with iPad Pro 11 and MacBook Pro 15 2016.\nI noticed, that I could use Apple Pencil to interact with the interface elements on the second screen, e.g. open a new empty tab in Safari.\nHowever, in order to scroll the page, I have to use the \"two finger drag\" gesture.

Format the drive as APFS.\n\n*Reboot into internet recovery mode with Opt-Cmd-R and install Catalina.\n\n\nThe problem is as follows. The installation finishes correctly, and leaves you with a running system. However data gets corrupted when the fusion drive contains too much data to solely exist on the internal drive. I've checked this by copying one file multiple times and then checking the MD5 sum.\nWhy have I been able to create a fusion drive that actually corrupts data? Why did it go wrong?\n\nA: This is a bad idea for lots of reasons. You're lucky that the Mac can boot from a Fusion drive that's half T2 and half external USB.\nI suspect the T2 disk controller is at the root of the problem. Possibly because of its built-in encryption. Perhaps the Fusion magic moves encrypted blocks off the SSD without decrypting them?\nEven if it did work, using a USB thumb drive is going to massively compromise the speed of the  fast internal portion. \nI don't think that 'expanding' the internal storage into a bigger logical volume, either with Fusion or RAID is going to be workable. \n", "Q: How to open console on ipad?

I guess not a lot of people build for mobile browser anymore. I found a way to use safari and connect to a mac but my user doesn't own any other device. So ipad is the only thing we can use.\nAny solutions?\n\nA: Safari calls this the Web Inspector, so you’ll want to make your support clear by using the terms people will see. These developer tools are awesome for precisely what you seek. \nGo to the settings app, Safari, Advanced. \n\nAs you can see this is a tethered operation where the data is shown on the desktop Safari. Most developers need to outsource this way and testing if you don’t find a Mac and iPad for testing and QA, but it’s entirely possible your users will help you to this level. It’s hard to be the developer and the tester since you know how you intended to use the app and can’t conceive of breaking it like someone who doesn’t know it uses the page in my experience. Also, timing delays and sketchy networks are hard to simulate in practice even when you enable the Network Link Conditioner on your simulator and devices for testing. \n", "Q: Is there a way to get Firefox-like-Containers in Safari?

I need different users/containers to separate private browsing from different works contexts.\nI found this older post Multiple user accounts in Safari like in Chrome? and tried Google but not much came out of it.\nMaybe someone knows a hidden gem\n\nA: Apple just published changes to Safari at WWDC 2021 detailing a new feature called Tab Groups.  But it seems to be more like other tab grouping solutions similar to Edge Collections. It will not offer multiple user accounts and full isolation like the FireFox Containers. Apple Safari will of course, sync the tab groups across iOS 15 and macOS Monterey systems.\nSafari uses the current Mac user and there is no concept of switching users in Safari.  You can enable Fast User Switching on macOS and switch between user accounts entirely. That's what I do with the family iMac so each family member has their own account.\nPerhaps this fall, Safari Tab Groups will be close enough to what you are looking to accomplish.

The filenames are usually something like D:\\Photos\\2020-05\\IMG_76843.jpg or D:\\Photos\\2020-05\\20200502_1256_2.jpg, when coming from various digital cameras or Android smartphones. \nNow I have an iPhone, and I imported nearly 10 GB of photos with the Macbook \"Photos\" app. I don't want to keep them inside this app, my final goal is to manage the JPG files myself, and move them on the external disk (mentioned above). So I took all files from ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Masters/ and moved them to the external disk. \n(or ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/originals/ with Catalina). This worked. \nAfter that I deleted Photos Library.photoslibrary (no longer needed, I will recreate a new photo library when importing next time; again, I don't want to use Photos app except for importing from the iPhone).\nQuestion: I now have files like:\nDE017ACB-5ABD-4113-B110-95DABF7F28F7.jpeg\nDE017ACB-5ABD-4113-B110-95DABF7F28F7_1_105_c.jpeg\nDE017ACB-5ABD-4113-B110-95DABF7F28F7_4_5005_c.jpeg\n\nand there are two problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*they are duplicates of different sizes (this is probably simple, I can do a script to remove the smaller files *_1_105_c.jpgand keep the original big file only)\n\n*the files are in  a totally random order! \nBefore I roll my own Python script (examining EXIF and recreate \"new filenames\" according to the datetime of the photo), are there tricks/things to know/techniques to recover better photo filenames from these random-looking filenames: DE017ACB-5ABD-4113-B110-95DABF7F28F7.jpeg?\nMore generally, is it possible to have less a mess with JPG filenames when importing photos from an iPhone?\nSidenotes: \n\n\n*\n\n*I do automated backups, both locally and distant\n\n*we don't want to use a cloud solution to manage photos, and also not a cataloguing software (like Lightroom or similar)\n\n*Reason for this \"I want to handle photo files myself\": with this \"plain JPG files in folders\" method, photos can be read on every device (Win, Linux, Mac, etc.) without requiring a specific software that would probably be unmaintained/unavailable in year 2079, when my children will want to open them ;)\n\"Just JPG files in a folder\" is probably the method that maximizes the chance of being opened in 50 or 100 years.\n\n*for my next import from iPhone, is there another software than \"Photos\" app that directly sets better filenames when importing?

These other apps are executing the quit order - is there any way to figure out why the script is stopping, and suppress whatever is doing it?\nedit: Code block looks like the following:\n\n\nA: You can try these three potential solutions to see if either fare any better than the built-in Automator action.\nThe first is a plain AppleScript handler that takes a list of exceptions (apps that are exempt from being quit), and then proceeds to send a quit command to all the others (they being any application process not belonging to a file in the /System directory--therefore, Finder and System Events will be spared, but Automator will not unless it is specified in the list of exceptions, X):\nto quitAll(X as list)\n    local X\n\n    tell application id \"com.apple.SystemEvents\" to script Apps\n        property list : the bundle identifier of processes ¬\n            where the POSIX path of its application file ¬\n            does not start with \"/System\"\n        property locked : X\n    end script\n\n    tell Apps to repeat with id in its list\n        ignoring application responses\n            set A to the application id id\n            if A's name is not in locked ¬\n                then try\n                quit A\n            end try\n        end ignoring\n    end repeat\nend quitAll\n\nThe second uses the same method as above to retrieve a list of running applications but it grabs their pid numbers.  These are passed en masse to a do shell script call to kill the applications (some people get nervous about this, possibly because the name of the command sounds like it's a bad action to perform, but it's perfectly safe, and very standard.  Applications typically also save their window and document states, so the kill command can allow them to retrieve the .savedState data when re-opened later.\nto kill(X as list)\n    local X\n\n    tell application id \"com.apple.SystemEvents\" to script Apps\n        property parent : a reference to every process where the ¬\n            POSIX path of its application file doesn't start with ¬\n            \"/System\"\n        property id : my unix id\n        property name : my short name\n        property locked : X\n    end script\n\n    tell Apps to repeat with i from 1 to length of id\n        if name's item i is in locked ¬\n            then set id's item i to []\n    end repeat\n\n    set my text item delimiters to space\n    \"kill \" & integers in the id of Apps\n    do shell script result\nend kill\n\nThe last solution is an AppleScript-ObjectiveC handler that, once again, obtains a list of the running applications that aren't located anywhere in the /System folder, and don't appear (by name) in the list that's passed to the handler:\nto terminate(X as list)\n    set pred to \"!bundleURL.path LIKE '/System/*'\" & ¬\n        \"&&!localizedName IN[c] %@\"\n\n    script\n        use framework \"Foundation\"\n\n        set [A, P] to a reference to my [¬\n            NSWorkspace's sharedWorkspace's runningApplications, ¬\n            NSPredicate's predicateWithFormat_(pred, X)]\n        (A's filteredArrayUsingPredicate:P)'s terminate\n    end script\n\n    run result\nend terminate\n\nI haven't tested this handler to see what permissions need granting, as I didn't want all of my programs to terminate.  But let me know if there are any hiccups and I'll direct you accordingly.  The word terminate inside the handler can be replaced by forceTerminate (case sensitive) to do a force quit on each application instead.  This, if it were me, would actually be my preference, as I have set my system to save the state of applications on forced terminations, and it avoids the \"Do you want to save the current document?\" banality.\n", "Q: Mid 2011 iMac 27'' won't boot - 3 beeps and maxed fans My iMac GPU failed about a week ago causing the OS to get stuck on a white screen with vertical pinkish stripes.\nI’ve performed a careful teardown to reflow the GPU. While I was at it I took the chance to repaste the CPU and give the iMac internals a clean using air duster can. I’ve put everything together and double-checked the connections which look ok to me.\nUpon pressing the power button, I’m greeted with 3 beeps every 5 seconds. After around 35 seconds all the fans are maxing out on top speed.\nLooking on the internet I’ve seen that the basic diagnosis for the 3 beeps every 5 seconds is RAM issue. I have 4 different RAM cards (all were lightly clean with air duster). I’ve tried each on each of the iMac 4 RAM slots. I doubt that I managed to brick all 4 sticks, to be honest, but hey I guess it’s possible?\nI’ve then taken the screen apart again and can see that led 501 and led 502 are lit and behaving as expected. led 503 and 504 are not led but this is what I would expect since the iMac never sounds the startup chime.\nI’ve made a quick movie of the process: https://youtu.be/vrQ9qOJo2YA\nIs it guaranteed that the problem is with the RAM or is it worth removing the motherboard again and triple checking everything? Is there any RAM connection to the board? Any other idea?\nSome photos of the visible connections\n \n \nI've removed the GPU and tried to start the iMac but the same symptoms are present.\nI've also taken the CPU apart again to see if I had missed something. I can the following pins a little bit bent on the CPU tray but I doubt I caused this while taking it apart. Could this be the culprit?\n\nWhile trying to repaste the CPU I mistakenly thought I should pull the CPU out to avoid making a mess of it. I then proceeded to take the screw out instead of pulling the metal lever to the left. My best guess is that, as the screw was getting loose, the pins got bent with the pressure. But just a guess really\n\n\n\nA: \nUpon pressing the power button, I’m greeted with 3 beeps every 5\nseconds. After around 35 seconds all the fans are maxing out on top\nspeed.\n\nThere's a RAM issue.\n3 successive beeps followed by a five second delay, then repeating means \"RAM didn't pass an integrity check.

The idea isolate whether it's a memory module problem or an issue with the slots on the logic board.  You should get one of the following results:\n\n*\n\n*If one or more modules gives you an error in every slot, it's that/those modules.\n\n\n*If all modules give a problem in one or more slots, it's that slot\n(Draft)\nIf you can't narrow it down to one of those two possibilities, there's a \"larger\" issue that needs to be investigated.\n\nCause:  CPU Issue\n\nI had removed it [CPU] the first time round to repaste it. The thought process was that the iMac was almost 10 years old and had never been repasted.\n\n \nIn this case, this is where the issue occurred.  Intel CPUs directly connect to a number of peripherals like display and memory.  (A memory buffer actually, but for all intents and purposes, it's directly connected to the memory modules).  As you can see from the CPU block diagram, there are items that directly talk to the CPU, like the memory, and others talk to the CPU via the Intel Mobile Chipset.  The chips that got bent just so happened to be associated with the memory of the system.\nCarefully bending the pins back to being straight should fix the issue.\nGoing forward, while I do wholeheartedly that computers (not limited to Macs) need periodic maintenance that includes replacing the thermal paste between the CPU/GPU and heat sink components, care must be taken when doing this.  You shouldn't need to to remove the processor(s), but should it be necessary, extreme care should be taken.\n", "Q: I can't paste a file into system directory I want to paste a file into /System/Library/Java/Extensions path but there is no \"paste\" button\n.

That's a function of your voice service. See:  Cellular iPad-Air text message configuration for more details.\nWiFi calling is a supplement to your cellular voice plan.  If the WiFi network is available, your phone will use WiFi instead of the LTE network to make a call.

I have the 2015 MacBook Pro and I was searching online for a hub because I need an Ethernet port and more USB ports.  \nMy first thought was \"Oh, no problem. I'll just get one for 5 or 6 dollars\".  So, I go online and check what it costs. The average was around 100$ up to 300$ or even more, at the same time, you can buy an identical hub for the Thunderbolt 3(USB-C) connector with price under 15 bucks.  \nHow is this even possible? Are Thunderbolt 2 and 3 that different? \nI will get a typical USB hub, it's not a problem, but I would like to know Why does this huge difference exist?\n\nA: Thunderbolt is expensive because of two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Licensing fees required by Intel (initially co-developed with Apple but Intel gained all rights in 2012)\n\n*Technical requirement of having a Thunderbolt controller module on both the host and peripheral device\n\n\nBecause of the licensing requirements that Intel had, any peripheral product had to pay a royalty to Intel.  So, it was expensive to PC and motherboard manufactures because they had to pay both a license fee and incurred development costs to integrate it into their products.\nIn comparison to USB, the licensing fees are nominal, making it very cost effective to utilize USB in their products.\nHowever, with the introduction of Thunderbolt 3, Intel removed the licensing fee and they started integrating the technology directly into their processors meaning that it’s now much easier and far cheaper to integrate Thunderbolt into new computers.\nAs far as compatibility, Thunderbolt 3 is backward compatible with both 1 and 2.  However, it will require an adapter because unlike Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 1 & 2 require an active (powered) cable; the protocol is still the same.\n\nyou can buy an identical hub for the thunderbolt 3(USB-c) connector with price under 15 bucks.\n\nThis is a common misconception.  Thunderbolt 3 only uses the USB-C connector, but they are not the same. Thunderbolt 3 is several technologies in one as opposed to just USB:\n\n\n*\n\n*PCIe\n\n*DisplayPort\n\n*USB 3.2 (soon to be USB 4)\n\n*Power Delivery\n\n\nIt’s the PCIe bus that is key here.  It allows for greater flexibility in terms of peripheral interconnect.  For example, you can hang a PCIe expansion chassis of your laptop and add external GPUs for gaming or data/number crunching applications.  \nFrom a personal standpoint, I have used both USB and Thunderbolt Ethernet adapters and found that the Thunderbolt adapters utilized less CPU, especially during heavy load, than their USB counterparts.\n", "Q: Help going from two Apple IDs to one I have two Apple IDs.

Revive just reloads the T2 and restarts it. Restore erases everything - all data keys, all fingerprints, everything - complete factory reset of your Mac. The first link us unlikely to change - search for the Apple Configurator user guide if these links change as the document gets updated (or you prefer a different localization / language than English).\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/apple-configurator-2/welcome/mac\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/apple-configurator-2/apdebea5be51/mac\nIf you are not comfortable loading your backup and reinstalling the Mac operating system, you might want to have a trained tech do the work in Apple Configurator and the person restoring / reviving needs a second Mac to connect and update your Mac firmware.\nFor your MacBook Pro - the steps to prepare it for the revive (which is less invasive - I would try that first) is as follows:\n\nPrepare the Apple portable computer to revive the firmware\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Press the wake/sleep button for about 5 seconds to shut down the Apple portable computer.\n  \n*Plug the cable into the right Thunderbolt port on the left side of the Apple portable computer.\n  \n*While holding down the power button, at the same time press all three of the following keys for about 3 seconds: Right Shift key +\n  Left Option key + Left Control key\n  \n  \n  Note: You won’t see any screen activity from the Apple portable computer.\n\nAlso, be sure you have the time to do this - I would set aside 35 minutes to get ready and then print out your steps, take a break and then allow an hour to try this the first time. When the instructions say 5 seconds - I would have a clock and be like someone defusing a bomb - precise, exact. If it says right key - the left one will not do, etc...\nOnce you've got Apple Configurator - all the exact cables, this can be done in 15 minutes for the first Mac and then 5 to 8 minutes for each Mac of the same type you need to work on, but give yourself time the first pass and be sure your backup drive is ready and tested. If you choose the wrong \"r\" command - you will not get a chance to stop the erase - it happens in an instant.\n\nA: For anyone else in my situation, I switched users from Admin Account ABC to Admin Account XYZ. Although I deleted my fingerprints from the previous user, it didn't work. Kept throwing the same error as above. Tried resetting SMC and all that.\nWhat finally worked for me was to delete the old account ABC (I chose to retain the Home folder, if it matters). It took the fingerprint immediately. It looks like your fingerprints can ONLY be associated with one Active account. Hope that helps someone in a similar situation.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 15, 2017 | Burned connector and no charge Is it possible to replace this two components.\n(J4402, J3300) I saw some components on Aliexpress but I don't know anything about a motherboard.\nor do I have to replace the whole logic board? \nThanks for the help! \n\nA: It is possible to replace components on a circuit board. It is expensive to get the tools and expensive in time to train and expensive to test the boards once repaired to be sure they are in spec. \nRealistically, for about 95% of repair shops (maybe 99.9% even) it’s cheaper to swap the entire logic board. Only Apple or the Factory that makes these in the first place likely get enough failed parts back to make it economical to refurbish and repair damage like that. \nAlso, how are you going to diagnose and fix what caused the power overload? Once you repair the connector, there’s more going on than a melted part. \n", "Q: Can I fix the screen on my macbook? I dropped my Macbook the other day, and when I opened it, there were lines on my screen. \n\n\n*\n\n*I have a pretty solid cover as a case and it was about a 3-foot drop.\n\n*The colored vertical lines tend to shift whenever I move the screen.\n\n*There aren't any cracks on the screen.\n\n\nI don't know what's wrong with I t, and I'm not sure if I can contact anyone to fix it. Here is a link to what my screen looks like, I\n   also added a video of the shifting lines. https://imgur.com/gallery/M0FbvBe\nIs there\n   anything I can do?\n\nA: Buying a replacement display assembly would repair that damage. It's not a super hard repair, but you could break the rest of the Mac while it's open so if you read the guide for your Mac on iFixit.com or another place where people make DIY repair manuals - you can choose to pay a technician or see if DIY is worth an attempt.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201834\nAlso - you don't need to fix this - you could use your Mac in closed clamshell mode with an external display - it won't be portable, but an external display is cheaper and larger than the built in one and you would get to use that external with any computer and not sink the cost on the custom display as a service part.\nSince your movement changes the lines - it's a fracture / disconnect of the wires to run the display and the panel that broke - not that the logic board or GPU have issues as the most likely failure mode. Once you get in to the Mac - you may find the logic board also cracked - so be sure you are OK getting it repaired ($800 for MacBook - $1200 for MacBook Pro) if all the parts are damaged and not just the screen. When you open, like Humpty Dumpty - if the case is holding things together marginally, when you open the case, you may find / cause more damage.\n", "Q: Is there a great text editor for iPhone and/or iPad with BBEdit-style text filters and PCRE search/replace?

Speed is down to 40 MB/s! I used to have well over 500 MB/s, and maybe even more if i remember it correctly. \nNow i tried to delete a lot of files (400 GB availible now) to check if that helped, but no, still very slow.. :/ \nIm using it with a macbook pro 2016 i7 thru usb c cable. Tried the repair function in diskmanager but that did not help. \nHow can I improve performance again?\n\nA: SSDs use flash cells to store data. At first, only one bit could be stored in each flash cell. As technically got more advanced, more bits could be stored in each cell. This allows SSDs to become cheaper. There's a major disadvantage, though: writes are way slower. When your drive is new, it uses the QLC (4 bits per cell) as SLC (1 bit per cell), which is much faster. As you fill it up, it has to convert SLC cells into QLC cell, and soon you only have QLC cells. This is only made worse by the fact that you're not running TRIM commands. TRIM tells the drive which space is not in use anymore, which means whenever you write to an empty space, you don't have to erase the cell before you write to it. That's why you don't see any performance increases after deleting files, it still things the drive is full, and thus won't use the \"SLC cache\" feature.\nRelevant video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OffzVc7ZB-o\n", "Q: Does the command `reboot` hurt a Mac computer? Does the command reboot (used in Terminal) hurt the computer?  Because it is almost like pulling the power cord, which is not a recommended way to power down a computer.\n\nA: It’s not like pulling the power plug because it sends various signals like SIGTERM which closes services and daemons.  User applications with unsaved data may get lost, but they’re not arbitrarily closed as if the system lost power.\nFrom the man page (man reboot)\n\nThe halt and reboot utilities flush the file system cache to disk, send all running processes a SIGTERM (and subsequently a SIGKILL) and,\n       respectively, halt or restart the system.\n\nSo, running reboot is perfectly safe to the system.  \n", "Q: How to add hyperlinks to local files in Numbers? How do I add a hyperlink to a local file?\nI know how to add a hyperlink to a website, so I tried something like file:///Users/MyUser/Documents/Invoices/Some%20Stuff.pdf\nHowever, adding this path to the hyperlink won't make Numbers open the file.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Out of the box, Numbers cannot link to a non-Numbers local document other than an email.\nNumbers can create a link to a webpage, or to a sheet (in Numbers, a \"sheet\" is a tab within a single spreadsheet), or to a specific email. Numbers cannot, however, create a link to other types of files. This Apple Numbers page contains this text:\n\nLink to a webpage, email, or sheet in Numbers on Mac\nYou can turn any text into a link that opens another sheet in the spreadsheet or opens a webpage or email message.\nNumbers automatically detects valid web addresses (URLs) and email addresses and styles them (for example, with an underline or different color) to indicate that they’re active links. You can edit these links or deactivate them so that they appear and behave as normal text. If you don’t want Numbers to automatically detect links, you can turn off automatic link formatting.\n\nThe same text (and same limitation as to linked filed types) appears in Numbers on-line help, and in the Menu Bar at Numbers > Format > Add Link.\n\nA: If numbers app is not expecting a filesystem link, i.e. it is not coded to except such cases, it will not open the file.\nCompare this with Sublime's, VSCode's or Xcode hyperlink feature that you can follow by double clicking or command-clicking.

(and to emails and all kinds of resources). You can paste them in Numbers. Numbers will honor that link, meaning you can click on the link and macOS will open the file (or reveal it in Finder, depending on your Hookmark General setting).\nhook://file/... links have the advantage that they are adaptive, meaning even if you rename or move the file around the links will still work. They work a bit like Finder aliases; but better since aliases don't have a URL format, and Hookmark's file links deal with a lot of edge cases that aliases can't handle (e.g., you can link to files in volumes, shared folders [dropbox , etc.] and version control repositories [git, SVN, etc] that get remounted/moved elsewhere). This is explained here. Plus the links are shareable , others can use them as long as they install Hookmark (the free Basic version can open links). In contrast you can't just email someone an alias and expect great results.\nThis is zero config, hence easier than Shortcuts-based solution; as long as you have Hookmark.\nFull disclosure, I'm a co-founder of CogSci Apps Corp. which makes Hookmark.\n", "Q: How do I delete files on a bootable osx Catalina disk from another bootup disk? My friend's 2016 iMac keeps crashing on restart after trying to install the latest Catalina update. The problem seems to be not enough disk space, he only has about 16 GB free on his internal Mac HD. \nI had him boot up in recovery mode and install a fresh system on an external HD. Now I am trying to get into the MacHD drive to clean up some space but I can't get in to his files. Under 'Users' I just see 'Shared'. Nothing shows up in his application folder either. I am able to see some system files but not the personalised ones. \nI tried changing permissions for the Mac HD to read & write but still no lock. I had him do it first over the phone but he is a total novice so ending up using Anydesk to access his computer remotely. Any suggestions of how I can clean up some space? Or can I cancel and ongoing update on restart with a key command?\n\nA: Is your Mac running a beta version of macOS? There is a known bug where the system crashes with lower amounts of space in Catalina. You should try resetting the NVRAM first. Then, you can also try a reset of the SMC for power related issues. To delete files off of the Internal Drive, boot up on the bootable drive and go to Finder and click on the Internal Drive. If FileVault was enabled, then macOS will prompt for the login password of one of the users on the problem instance of macOS. This will unlock and mount the drive. Then, you can use Finder and Terminal to navigate the files and delete.\n", "Q: Appearance colors have gotten goofy I don't know what I did, but my screen colors are off base -- menu bar has a peach background and window title bars are something like lilac. Colors within any menu vary from blue to peach.\nIn System Preferences > General, I changed appearance and highlight color from blue to graphite, which changed nothing. But when I booted off a backup disk for some maintenance, the colors were as they should be.\nMy guess is a preference file is corrupted. Booted off the backup, I copied all the \"com.apple . . .\" preferences to my regular startup disk, replacing. Booted off the regular disk, no change. It must be another preference file, and I have no idea which one.\nAnyone suggestion?\nThis is a 2009 iMac; OS is 10.11.6.\n\nA: One possibility is that you have inverted the colors. In 10.11.6 I believe you might do that accidentally by pressing Command-Option-Control-8 at the same time. Try holding down the command, option, and control keys with one hand and pressing the number 8 key with your other and see if that fixes the color scheme.\nAnother possibility would be to look at the color profiles in the color tab of the Display section of System Preferences. If there are multiple profiles there, does changing profiles fix the problem?\n", "Q: My Internal SSD is Not Showing Up in Diskutil I ereased current MacOS system and tried to setup new version from scratch.

In the second photo I've labelled things for reference.\n\nStatus:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the photo, AC is plugged in\n\n*Of the 5 diagnostic lights, the first one (bottom), is lit up. This indicates that the machine is receiving power\n\n*The others don't LED's up at all (light 2 would indicate the machine is powering on)\n\n*When I push the power button, nothing happens at all. The fan doesn't move, no sign of activity, like a brick.\n\n\nWhat I repaired:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switched out the disk with a new SSD (currently blank, was going to install MacOS from USB)\n\n*Switched out stock 8GB RAM with 32GB from OWC\n\n*Applied a graphite cooling pad I had instead of the stock thermal paste on the CPU (I regret doing this because it was really difficult to align it on the non-level iMac surface)\n\n\nMy experience:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm not necessarily an advanced hardware person, but my background is in computer science (software dev by trade)\n\n*I've worked with Apple products for years\n\n*I've repaired a about 30 different Apple products (various iPhones, iPads, Macbooks, iMacs and iPods, although not too many in recent years)\n\n*It's been a few years, but I don't think I've had a single problem in an Apple repair or upgrade before. I'm careful and I'm familiar with best practices.\n\n\nThings that could have gone wrong\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm really nervous about the thermal paste replacement, mostly because I've never used one of those graphite pads before. They seem to work fine for everyone though, so I tried it. I cleaned the copper heat sink and top of the CPU chip of all paste with 95% isopropanol. It took me many times to align the stupid graphite pad well, and I can't say for sure that it stayed perfectly aligned when I attached the heat sink, because you're supposed to attach it, then flip it over to screw it tight (I did follow the cross pattern for gradually tightening the corners of heat sink pressure)\n\n*Although I looked at the iFixit tutorial beforehand, one of the things I didn't realize was that removing the heat sink from the CPU would also remove it from the GPU and its 4 VRAM chips. These 5 chips had a thick thermal paste (like K5-PRO) on them. I didn't reapply any additional paste when I closed them back up. I think this is normally okay, but now I'm not so confident.\n\n*For a brief moment the CPU fell (was stuck to the heat sink), and landed on the aluminum chassis of the iMac from a height of maybe 15cm (6\"). I cleaned both sides with alcohol, inspected it. Seemed fine. Aligned it and put it in the CPU socket and continued.\n\n*I was really careful with the power supply and made sure that all connectors were fully in place. Actually I was very careful with any junctions or connectors, not touching exposed parts with my hands, making sure they were fully inset to click, etc.. But since the device isn't powering on, I'm a little nervous about the power supply.\n\n*There was one weird moment with the PSU. I cleaned everything with compressed air and, for a second, I thought I heard the PSU let out a shock sound when the air \"froze\" the surface of the PSU board. I didn't think much of it, but now I'm wondering if that is the kind of thing that can bridge a connection on a board and short something? Note that the machine hadn't been connected to power for several hours at that point, and I did try to hold the power button at the start of the repair to fully discharge capacitors.\n\n*The RAM was the right type, pins aligned and all. But the second chip didn't quite fit in snuggly. I really felt like I had to jam it, and still, the bevel in the corner of the chip was not perfectly flush with the groove on the outline of the RAM socket. It was really close though.\n\nNormally these sorts of small potential mishaps don't matter to much in my experience. I accidentally touch an exposed pin? No problem, clean it with isopropyl and carry on. But here something clearly went wrong (a first for me), so I'm really second guessing everything.\nI don't have any thermal paste, but I ordered some quality stuff (two different kinds, a thick one and a CPU paste) just in case I now need it.\nThese new machines aren't easy to work with, everything has to be taken out just to get to the RAM and CPU, so I'm trying to diagnose as much as I can before going back in.\nBased on these 6 potential issues, and the diagnostic lights, which seem the most likely? What should I prioritize exploring in the interest of time?\n\nA: From the top:\n\nI'm really nervous about the thermal paste replacement, mostly because I've never used one of those graphite pads before.\n\nGraphite pads, rather than using paste, wouldn't cause an issue. You didn't place the pad between the pins and CPU, I assume.\n\nAlthough I looked at the iFixit tutorial beforehand, one of the things I didn't realize was that removing the heat sink from the CPU would also remove it from the GPU and its 4 VRAM chips. These 5 chips had a thick thermal paste (like K5-PRO) on them. I didn't reapply any additional paste when I closed them back up. I think this is normally okay, but now I'm not so confident.\n\nThe heatsink is one unit, yes - so removing it from one removes it from all of them. This should not have caused an issue. You're right that not re-applying thermal paste shouldn't cause the computer to abjectly not boot. It may cause issues with heat dissipation, for example, later down the track, and I would advise reapplying thermal paste before you put the screen back on, but it wouldn't cause issues right now.\n\nFor a brief moment the CPU fell (was stuck to the heat sink), and landed on the aluminum chassis of the iMac from a height of maybe 15cm (6\"). I cleaned both sides with alcohol, inspected it. Seemed fine. Aligned it and put it in the CPU socket and continued.\n\nA concern, but not a likely one.\n\nI was really careful with the power supply and made sure that all connectors were fully in place.\n\nIt's receiving power?

I really felt like I had to jam it, and still, the bevel in the corner of the chip was not perfectly flush with the groove on the outline of the RAM socket.

This conflicts with my muscle memory of using M-w in Emacs.\nI looked at Disable Command-W in the terminal, but the accepted answer does not work on macOS Catalina.\nHow do you disable ⌘ + W?\n\nA: Like in old versions, it be can't removed. The work around is the same: the system default can be overridden to a new key combination. The hotkey must be associated with a context menu item name (ie. an app specific menu item). The name must match exactly. \nSystems apps use the name Close to mean close window, along with iTerm2. Some other apps use the more verbose Close Window. Remap both to get decent app coverage. Note that some apps may use other unique names that mean close window. Separate entries will have to be made for these apps to remap it globally.\nNavigate to System Preferences -> Keyboard.\n\nSelect the Shortcuts tab, then App Shortcuts in the left pane.\nSelect the + at the bottom of the window to add a new shortcut.\n\nTo remap it globally, select All Applications in the Application field. To change Cmd-w on a specific application instead of globally, select that instead.\nSet Menu Title to Close. It is case sensitive and must match exactly.\nSet Keyboard Shortcut to the desired key combination. I set it to an obscure value so it's essentially 'disabled'.\nClick Add to finalize the key shortcut. The right pane should now show a new entry for Close with your key combination (see the first image for an example).\nAdd another hotkey entry with Application set to All Applications and Menu Title set to Close Window for additional coverage.\nClose the menu.\nThe change takes effect immediately, including with open apps.\n", "Q: Apple IpadOS / ios HTML editor which will sync with Amazon AWS S3 buckets Hi so I'm looking for an Apple IpadOS / IOS app that'll edit a HTML file stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, and update, and upload it back.

Letting your Mac or WAP automatically detect and switch channels for you will ensure you get the cleanest channel at the time.\n\nWhich program build this small list of channels?\n\nThat was created dynamically.  Those are the channels that have the \"best\" signals at that moment.  \nNow, if bandwidth congestion and more than likely noise are causing connectivity issues, it's much better to get multiple WAPs (Wireless Access Points) with the transmit power reduced than to get one, crank up the power and shoehorn it into a particular channel.  Think of it like trying to setup  speakers for a party in a noisy environment.  It's better to have several speakers dialed to maybe a 4 or a 5 than to just have one speaker cranked up to 11 and then the knob subsequently broken off.\nAdditionally, getting a newer, modern WAP (you don't need a full blown router) will give you much better performance because you'll have the option of placing it higher up (like on a shelf or bookcase) where devices will have better line of sight to the antennae as opposed to the MacBook on a desk.\n\nA: I can't comment on why you only see specific choices, however it's highly recommended you stick with one of the three main channel choices 1, 6, or 11.\nAfter doing CWNP (wireless)certifications they made it clear that there would be a lot less trouble by choosing one of the three channels mentioned above, even if the three channels are quite active.\nWhen you choose channel 8, it's actually picking up interference and causing interference on everything from channel 6 through channel 10!\nYour best bet is to use a WiFi scanner app and find out which of the three options are a little weaker and use that channel, or keep things set on Automatic. The neighbor's WiFi access points/routers will likely switch around between channels as well, so setting things manually in such a dense setup is a bit of a risk.\nAllan had great other suggestions as well and I agree with all -- consider a Wireless Access Point. I used to use Internet Connection Sharing and the performance was pretty dismal compared with decent access points. (Weak signal strength, slower connectivity, way less options)\nSee this article for more details on picking one of the three channels and why it's bad to choose a adjacent channel, such as channel 8:\nWhy Channels 1, 6, and 11?\n", "Q: Catalina's zsh and its .zshrc file I am trying hard to wrap my head around zsh \"upgrade\" from bash in macOS Catalina. Most of the things are great, actually. However, I cannot figure out why I am experiencing difficulties, like accessing Anaconda rather than built in Python despite the fact that I put the path to it:\n# Anaconda3 2019.10\nexport PATH=\"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/anaconda3/bin:$PATH\"\n\nBut if I have this too, under Anaconda's path, then the system does not \"see\" Anaconda anymore (I've commented it out, for now):\n# Local path:\n# export PATH=\"/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\n\nAlso, I have some odd line added to gcc (again, I commented out the odd line):\n# Setting gcc compiler\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/gcc-9.2/bin:$PATH\"\n# export CC=\"/usr/local/gcc-9.2/bin\"\n\nWith lines commented out things are working now. But can anyone explain what is wrong in them and what, specifically, export CC should to on top of the export PATH line?\nThanks!\n\nA: Since the variable setting you want to achieve are both to be run\nonce only per session and not for every subshell, you have to place\ntheir initialisation definition within .zprofile and not within .zshrc.\nHere are the fixed version of your settings which should work:\n# Anaconda3 2019.10\nexport PATH=\"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/anaconda3/bin:${PATH}:/usr/local/bin\"\n\nHere my explanation is I bet you have 2 versions of anaconda the older one being located within /usr/local/bin.\n# Setting gcc compiler\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/gcc-9.2/bin:${PATH}\"\nexport CC=\"/usr/local/gcc-9.2/bin/gcc\"\n\nHere my explanation is that the CC variable should contain not the PATH\nwhere to find gcc but the exact pathname of the compiler.\nIf you want to check the correctness of your modifications, don't exit your session.

This opened another tab alleging a security issue and it downloaded a number of files. They could not close the tab.\nFirst I told them to restart Safari with the shift key pressed so that tabs were not restored.\nSecond they inspected the download list and cleared it (unfortunately before taking the picture I requested).\nNow I am not sure as to whether the files are still on the computer. It is kind of assumed by a number of sources including https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri40598/mac that clearing the download list deletes them, but I am looking for a positive confirmation. Could please someone familiar with OSX/Safari confirm this?\nMy mother told me she could find no folder named \"Downloads\" (or its localized version). Could it be that the folder is hidden when empty?\nFinally, if there is such a folder: What is safest way to empty the \"Downloads\" folder without risk of opening one of the files? Keeping in mind I must explain the procedure on the phone.\nI do not think anything worse has happened. This looked like a scam to have them call a phone number, where they would have been requested to pay for \"technical support\".\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The Downloads folder is still usually visible to the user when empty. Some malware can be difficult to find and it may have even moved out of the Downloads directory. First, in Terminal, try chflags nohidden ~/Downloads and then cd ~/Downloads then ls. You can also try sudo chown Username:Staff ~/Downloads then sudo chmod 755 and then see if the folder and its contents are visible. Do they see any files in there then? If not, then try starting in Safe Mode. This startup mode allows macOS to start with only basic files that are required. To enter Safe Mode, reboot the Mac and hold Shift. You may need to login twice. Once you are in, try looking in Finder and Terminal for the downloads. You can also try applying the above Terminal commands again. Which version of macOS is the affected Mac running? If it is macOS Catalina, then Safari will always ask for confirmation before downloading the files. If none of the above are working, then your best bet is using Malwarebytes to remove malware found on your Mac. Good Luck!\n", "Q: Upgrade nano on Mac OS X I have followed the suggestion in this answer How do you update the default version of Nano on MacOS without using the homebrew package manager?\nI have macOS High Sierra.\nAfter the installation I have tried:\n$ nano -V\n\nAnd the output is:\nGNU nano version 2.0.6 (compiled 19:06:01, Oct  6 2017)\n Email: nano@nano-editor.org    Web: http://www.nano-editor.org/\n Compiled options: --disable-nls --enable-color --enable-extra --enable-multibuffer --enable-nanorc --enable-utf8\n\nSo I have tried to see where nano is located:\n$ which nano\n\nand the output is\n/usr/local/bin/nano\n\nChecking the path:\n$ echo $PATH\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\nI don't understand, if the first path is where nano is installed, why the new version is not available.\n\nA: When running a binary from your shell, the shell stores its path within PATH in a cache and uses that value for future calls to avoid having to research the path each time. If you then install a new version of this binary in a different location the shell won't notice this and keep running the previous version.\nIf you are running bash\n\n*\n\n*hash -t nano will show the currently used version of nano (if any)\n\n*hash nano will update the cache for nano\nIf you are running zsh\n\n*\n\n*hash -m nano will show the currently used version of nano (if any)\n\n*hash -f nano will update the cache for nano\n\nA: After making a change to the shell like editing PATH, reload it as follows:\nBash: exec bash\nZsh: exec zsh\n(For me hash nano didn't do anything and -t results in bad option: -t.)\n", "Q: Issue with iMessage on Mac Lately my iMessage behave very funcky.

That will boot you into a recovery version of macOS.  Select only to “Reinstall macOS” on the existing disk that there.  Don’t wipe it, partition the disk or anything.  Simply install  macOS as you normally would.  \nAfter you get macOS fixed, go back into iMessage and add back your iCloud account (remove it first if necessary).  This will force iCloud to sync your iPhone’s and Mac’s messages once again.\nIn the future, if you lose the ability to sync messages, your first thing you should try is to log out of iCloud and log back in.  Removing and reinstalling software is usually very low in the list of things to do to solve problems.    \n", "Q: How to avoid iMessages services carrier charges after every restart? Everytime I restart my iPhone, I have to verify/activate my iMessage services(both FaceTime and iMessages)\n\n*\n\n*I have to pay carrier charges.\n\n*I selected the option to use Apple ID to send and receive messages\n\n*I have a Sim Card Lock enabled.\n\nIs there a list of carriers that don’t charge for activation?\n\nA: Apple messaging service works with an AppleID and your iPhone mobile number. Since SMS activation is only required if you want to use your phone number with Messages / Facetime chat, removing your phone from  Messages should stop the request for repeated SMS activation.\nTo remove your phone number from Messages follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*On your iPhone, go to Settings > Messages > Send & Receive. Select your Apple ID and tap Sign Out.\n\n\n*Then go to Settings > FaceTime, select your Apple ID and tap Sign Out.\n\n\n*Additionally, some may require to go back to Settings > Messages > Send & Receive and  Tap “Use your Apple ID for Messages” and sign in with your Apple ID.\n(Note: If Messages and / or Facetime section in settings is disabled / greyed out, go to Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > Account Changes and tap 'Allow')\nSource: Add or remove your phone number in Messages or FaceTime on all your Apple devices.\nºº(This didn't work for me on an old iPhone with an outdated version of ios and still kept asking for SMS activation. So update ios on your device if you still have issues.)\n\nI consider this an issue with Messages / Facetime design and I would even label it a bug, even if Apple doesn't consider it so.\nThis issue is even more irritating for users who have to pay international rates for the SMS that Messages / Facetime wants to send to Apple for activation.\nThis is an Apple issue and not a carrier / cellular phone provider as this is about activation of an Apple service (iMessage / Facetime). So talking to your carrier support won't help with this.\nBefore you can use Messages / Facetime chatting service on your iPhone, it requires that an SMS be sent from your phone to Apple to activate it. This SMS is sent the first time you try to use Messages / Facetime or if ios thinks your Messages needs to be activated. So for me, and many others outside US, it sends a costly international SMS to Apple.\nThis SMS activation is required if you want someone to also be able to locate you using your mobile phone number. (Note that by Messages I mean message that is sent through iCloud and internet and not SMS, which are messages sent through your carrier network. You can always send SMS through the Messages app without requiring any such Apple activiation).\nI presume that Messages / Facetime keeps asking to send SMS activation on every restart, because it probably wants to verify if you have changed your SIM card or phone number.\nThere is currently no known method to avoid sending this SMS to activate Messages on the iPhone. (Apple iPad and iPod Touch don't require SMS activation for using iMessage as you can only use your AppleID for Messages on these devices).\nThe only way to avoid paying the SMS charges is to change your plan to one that includes free SMS (but this option will work only for US citizens, as no plan I've heard of includes free international SMS!). Or to a different carrier that has an understanding with Apple to not charge for such SMS sent to Apple. (Yeah, I know both options suck).\n\nNote: If you frequently have to restart your iPhone because the phone seems to hang or struggle, it may be time to change your iPhone's battery. As your battery becomes older, ios throttles your phone so that the battery is not strained and can give you longer battery life. But ofcourse, this means that your phone becomes slower and everything feels sluggish.\nMore information on this can be found here -\n\n*\n\n*iPhone Battery and Performance\n\n*What is iPhone throttling and why does it happen?\n\nA: Carrier activation is handed, well, at the carrier level.  You have to activate your phone with their servers so that it can’t “talk” on their network.  Note:  this is outside of Apple’s activation of the iPhone which is a completely separate process.\nAs to why they charge a fee every time you activate, it comes down to being their policy.  \nCan you circumvent this?  \nNo.  In order for your phone to work on a carrier’s network, it must register several things like your IMEI number and SIM card number to the network and get authorization to connect.  Every time you reset a phone it’s setting it back to the “factory” state where it hasn’t been registered to a network.  So, the moment you start it up, it’s going to go through the process of registering itself to the carrier’s network.\nThe problem you stated (in comments) as to why you’re resetting your phone being the lack of RAM; well, unfortunately, there’s only two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*get a phone with more RAM\n\n*don’t install every single app you encounter on your phone\n\n\nI personally don’t install highly technical apps or point of sale apps or network analysis apps  on a phone that I use to do my personal banking and check my medical records.  I get a separate device for that.  If you’re a gamer and want to test/play with/review every other game that comes out, perhaps an iPod touch would be more your style.   This way, you can accomplish what you wan’t without the constant re-activation charges.\n", "Q: Firmware Password Lock after Bootcamp Install Tried to install Windows via Bootcamp on my computer yesterday. When the computer restarted to try and boot on the Windows partition, I got hit with the Firmware Password. Asked my IT guy what it was and the password doesn't work. Either he remembers it wrong or entered it with a typo. \nIn any case, I've tried every operations i've heard people discuss to try and boot on my main system. Tried booting in Recovery Mode, tried Resetting NVRAM, tried Resetting SMC. Any combinations I try end up on the lock screen of death.\nShouldn't I still be able to boot to recovery or at least select my startup disc?\n\nA: No - Firmware Passwords exist to prevent any non-approved boot methods and prevent you from bringing any other boot to the system.\nIt's like putting superglue in a deadbolt lock and only having the small lock on the handle. If the small handle (your normal OS) breaks - you can't get in by bringing another small handle - you need to release the deadbolt (firmware password).\nOpen a case with Apple Support to see if your firmware lock can be bypassed locally or you need to prove you own the Mac and have apple generate a rescue key.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204455\n\nA firmware password prevents starting up from any internal or external storage device other than the startup disk you've selected.\n\n", "Q: Backup/Archive a particular version of an app How can I archive a my currently installed app version (particular version) of an iOS app (=export IPA file?)\nI am aware that apple removed the App Store from iTunes and that apps are not part of the backups any more.\nHowever I am looking for a solution with which I can draw my currently installed app version as IPA file before I upgrade.\nSince app authors can modify and remove functionality at will and Apple prevents people from going back to a previous version I would like to be safe, particularly when large changes happen.\nI have looked into iMazing but it only seems to be able to export the latest version from the AppStore to IPA (neither the currently installed version nor different version)\n\nA: This isn’t feasible since you can’t really restore or install the IPA even should you manage to back them up. We engage with app developers as a business so they can sell to us direct when we need to manage upgrade cadence or pin an app, but ever forward is the model for consumers now.\n", "Q: Is there a way to set Safari's homepage to an entire bookmark folder?

It seems to work pretty well. But when I turn off the TV, the Mac still thinks that it's connected and behaves in dual monitor mode. Is there a setting, an app or a trick that would overcome this problem?\n\nA: Your TV is not actually turned off, it’s in standby.  And since many consumer electronics companies utilize the CEC signaling over HDMI so other devices can turn it on/off, the Mac is interpreting that it’s still on.\nYou’ll have to disconnect your Mac or turn off the monitor from the mains themselves.\nPossible solution\nI’ve been looking at a product from a Pulse-8 that claims to have a USB CEC adapter that allows you to control the CEC signaling from a computer.  I haven’t tested it for a number of reasons not limited to many other projects, proximity of my iMac an my living room TV, priority, etc.  However, since it “intercepts” the HDMI signal and overrides the CEC signaling, it may solve the problem.  I’m not saying it does, but it may be worth looking into.\nAdditional solution - there is an “HDMI CEC-less” cable that doesn’t have the CEC signaling pins - this too, could solve your issue.\n", "Q: Is there a utility that tracks most recently opened folders?

It works on other dialog screens. Does anyone have a workaround or know why they removed a feature?\n\nA: Looks like another example of Apples notoriously great user interface. In order to use keyboard to interact with the dialog, you have to click on it first.  But it has to be on the text of the question, not the title bar or blank grey areas around it.\nWhen the dialog is activated, it's the focused window.  You can tell by looking in the Window menu.  The \"Copy\" window has checkbox next to it.  But it's in this magical-apple-great-interfacy focused state.  In order to make it focused proper, you have to click on the text. Oh, also, like all great UI's, it will not give you a visual cue that it went from apple-magical-focus to normal focus.  But if you press tab, the buttons become selected in a rotation.\nThe only solution I can think of involves Apple's wonderfully user friendly and clever programming language AppleScript.  Or some automation tool like Keyboard Maestro.  Or skip Finder all together for an option that's less magical like Terminal or ForkLift.\nPS Sorry about all the sarcasm.

If in addition you have data files in a format proprietary to that application, then once the application is unable to run,  you have no way to access the data files.\nI could say some nasty things about obsoleted proprietary data formats (Microsoft Office, I'm staring straight at YOU), but you get the idea here. \n\nA: What will happen if I upgrade to macOS Catalina without backing up?\nIf they don't get accidentally deleted during the update, you'll have to wait for them to get accidentally deleted some other time.\nis it necessary to back up?\nOnly if you want to keep your files.\nApple introduced Time Machine with OS X Leopard in 2007. It could not be easier. Plug in a drive, turn on TM, and off you go. There is no reason not to have a backup, and I find it increasingly difficult to feel sorrow for anyone who loses files because they didn't have one.\n\nA: Complementing other answers:\nApart from the system specific answers given by others (some losses may \"just happen\", 32 bit applications will no longer function) sudden unpredictable data loss is a fact of life in all computing systems. A \"proper\" backup plan is an essential part of all but the most trivial systems. \nALL hard drives fail (whether rotating rust or some form of solid state).\nTime to loss typically varies between 1 decade and 1 hour after first  use. (I've seen a PC with hard disk failure of a name brand drive within hours of 1st operation.)\nBackups are such an essential part of life that data loss of a primary record should be no more than an inconvenience. If any data has more than near-zero value to you it should be backed up in a manner that makes loss nearly impossible. \nThe value of \"nearly\" should approach certainty as the value increases. \nI know or know of people who have lost whole theses due to a complete lack of backup.\nOr priceless memories such as photos.\nJust do it. \n\nA: First: start making backups! You will need the backup one day.\nYes, you can lose data. No, the upgrade is designed by Apple to be as careful as possible in a normal situation. By normal I here mean that you save your data and documents in the normal places, that is under /home in your user folders or in folders you have created yourself directly under /.\nIf you have data in the \"OS\" folders, say under /etc or /bin and so on, don´t expect that data to survive an update. The update process will do its best, some files will be copied to a special folder, but some files may be replaced and your data lost.\nAnd as other answers mention, your applications may not survive a new OS version. You might need to upgrade the applications as well in order to read the data. And there might not be newer versions available or they may come at a cost.\n\nA: if normally updated it will not lose any data but if you want to clean install which is Good because latest os uses AFPS partition then you should backup which is a best practice.\n", "Q: How to disable screen time out for a specific iPad app? Is it possible to stop an iPad from going to sleep only when a specific app is open, even if nothing is being clicked/played?\n\nA: Sorry, it is not possible with iOS settings.  You will have to goto settings and turn off auto-lock whenever you don't want the screen to turn off.\nSee here: Disable iPhone timed auto lock when an app is running?\n\nA: Only the app itself can set that parameter. I have no clue how it is achieved, programatically, but some apps, such as SatNavs will never allow the device to sleep.\nTry contacting the app makers to see if they might incorporate the setting in a future release.\n", "Q: How to convert Audible AAX file audiobook M4B on a Mac using Terminal How do you convert Audible AAX files to M4B audiobooks \n\nA: How to convert Audible AAX files to M4B Audiobook\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal by pressing CMD + Space and then typing \"terminal\".\n\n\n\n\n*Once terminal is open, paste the following command and click enter:\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\"\n\n\n\n\n*Follow the instructions given (pressing enter, typing password, ect...)\n\n\n\n*Once Homebrew is installed, paste the following command: brew install ffmpeg and press enter.\n\n\n*Now paste brew install cask and press enter.\n\n\n*Paste brew cask install chromedriver and press enter.

Or is it a bug? (keyboard battery is at 100%).  How can I get it to retain the Bluetooth connection across reboots?\n\nA: On my iMac running Catalina I can enter my password after reboot using the bluetooth Magic Keyboard without connecting it via cable. Although you run a different version of MacOS on a different machine it seems to me that this is rather a bug than a feature. Does it also appear after reboot or only after complete shutdown?\nI have two ideas you can try to fix the problem: First, reset your SMC. If this doesn't solve the problem reset your bluetooth controller.\nIf both things don't work, connect the keyboard to another Mac to see if the problem is the same. If it is, I would order a new Magic Keyboard or go to an Apple store.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro won't turn on after Catalina update I have a 2017 13 inch MacBook Pro without a touchbar. \nI upgraded from Mojave to Catalina and left the computer to do its thing. Now about an hour later, my computer seems to be off and won't turn on. It's connected to the charger and had a full battery when I started the update. Now it's basically dead. I've long pressed the power button for more than six seconds and tried short pressing it but nothing. I've tried this several times now. \nI'm in lockdown and can't visit an Apple Store either. \nEDIT:  Steve Chambers' comment about resetting the SMC worked for me. When it restarted, it had Catalina installed. I still do not know what went wrong but hopefully, this helps others who might end up in the same boat.\n\nA: This sounds like it might be fixed by an SMC reset.Apple: Reset SMC\nAnd on current Macs this is done like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac.\n\n*Press and hold the power button for 10 seconds, then release the button.\n\n*Wait a few seconds, then press the power button to turn on your Mac\n\n", "Q: Unable to view Documents or Downloads folder remotely I used to be able to access folders on my remote systems without problem.\nNow in Catalina when I find my computers on my LAN and try to connect to them, I can only see the contents of ~/ and that of any folder I made.

I'm logged in as myself, so there should be no permissions issue (all other folders/files have the same permissions anyways).  On the remote end, by screensharing at the exact same time I can confirm that there are files present in the folders.  No dialog is presented asking for access like many apps do now to access such files.\nI even added my home folder as a separate shared folder, and granted full access to everyone.  But to no avail.\nAny ideas on how to enable access?\n\nA: I had this problem today on a machine with Ventura.\nWhile file sharing, accounts and everything seemed to be configured correctly, I could not see the contents of the remote Desktop , Documents and Downloads folders. I could see and write to the other folders, like Music or the root of the share which is my $HOME.\nThe problem disappeared after completely disabling \"File Sharing\" in General > Sharing, rebooting, and re-enabling  \"File Sharing\".\nAlso check under \"Privacy & Security\" > \"Full Disk Access\" if you have \"smbd\" allowed.\n", "Q: How do I prevent macOS from thinking a folder is a file? I am usually copy/pasting the name of the projects my team works on into a folder's name, so that they match.\nThis allows me to be organized and fast, and to find folders that match project names easily.\nHowever, it doesn't always work, since some project names will have words and some won't.\nFor example the project that ends in \"-lists\" was named without an error message, but the second one gave me an error message:\n\nNow, I need the names of the folders to be as close to project names. Which can contain dots. This way, I can copy the folder name to search the database and find the corresponding project. \nBut I cannot manually change every single . into a -, I feel like this would be a lot of trouble. \nShould I add the word \"folder\" at the end to make sure macOS doesn't think my folders have file extensions?\nWhen does a folder's name turn this folder into a file I won't be able to open anymore, and what are ways to name folders freely, without the system assuming they are extensions?\n\nA: It’s thinking it has an extension because you’re giving it an extension.  \nAnytime you end something with a .whatever you're giving it an extension.  This is a convention across all operating systems and not limited to macOS.\nInstead of using dots as a separator for dates, use a dash or an underscore. You don’t  need to do this for all folders all at once, but with a little bash scripting magic and using a utility like sed or awk the renaming of the files/folders can be done automagically.\n", "Q: Macintosh HD not using entire drive I have a 2016 15\" macbook pro with a 256gb ssd.

I was using the CapitalOne app and got asked to verify my identity as an added step before being shown my full credit card number, but today I got offered a new verification option: Tap one of my other cards against my phone to verify my identity. \nI followed the instructions and sure enough, all I had to do was tap my card and my identity was verified. Is this based on a new iOS capability, and how does it work?\n \n\nA: The Capital One credit card has NFC capability, and similarly modern iPhones have NFC capabilities. This is how the phone and card communicates with eachother.\nApp developers can use NFC through Apple's \"Core NFC\" framework, which has been available for developers since iOS 11. So that's not really \"new\".\niPhone 6 and newer have NFC chips, but you'll need an iPhone 7 or newer for apps to be able to use NFC through the Core NFC framework.\n", "Q: What apps allow me to draw on an iPad and sync it with a Mac?

I run macOS  / OS X 10.8.5\n\nAm I missing something here, or is there something wrong with the laptop?\n\nA: Your version of macOS predates this setting. You don’t have any restrictions to grant as they are not in place.\nCan you validate your macOS version (or perhaps it’s still called OS X) from About this Mac and also cross reference the driver software version and requirement?\nIf in the end it’s not working, we might need a follow on question documenting the versions for someone to help.

Or, how can I make Disk Utility prompt for an administrator password when performing these operations, either globally or on certain volumes?\nIs it possible to achieve one or the other possibly using Terminal, diskutil and/or APFS verbs or otherwise?\n\nA: The answer is Parental Controls.\nBelow users axj and rpj both have Standard accounts. However, rpj has parental control turned on, therefore the account is labeled as Managed.\n\nBy default under Parental Controls, the Disk Utility is not an allowed App, as shown below.\n\nThe same is true for the Terminal application.\nThis does not prevent user rpj from using the Disk Utility, but user rpj would first have to enter the username and password of the Admin user dma. For example, if user rpj tried to open the Disk Utility application, then the following popups would appear.\n\nIf the buttons Always Allow... or Allow Once... are pressed, then the following popup appears.\n\nIf the proper username and password are entered, then the Disk Utility application will open. If Always Allow... was pressed, then the Disk Utility will be checked off in Parental Controls, as shown below.\n\n\nA: As far as I can ascertain, there's no way you can lock down APFS volumes or customise Disk Utility in this way, but it may help to use the inexpensive third-party tool Mac App Blocker to set a password to open Disk Utility.\nIf that isn't what you need, another option is to send Apple feedback at https://www.apple.com/feedback/macos.html. It may help if you can persuade others to request the same change. Note that feedback is a one-way process; Apple won't open any dialogue with you about this.\n", "Q: Possible to use two HCI controllers concurrently? I have a 2011 iMac with Bluetooth 2.1, and recently purchased a Bluetooth 4.0 USB dongle required for my new wireless mouse.\nThe dongle works great - I paired my mouse and keyboard to it without issue and used the following terminal command to ensure macOS uses the dongle instead of the built-in 2.1 module:\nsudo nvram bluetoothHostControllerSwitchBehavior=always\n\n(Source: Force OS X to use Bluetooth dongle instead of built in controller)\nHowever I've noticed when I reboot or shutdown my Mac the login screen doesn't respond to any input from my wireless keyboard, so I can't enter my password to login. After logging in (using a wired keyboard) my wireless keyboard and mouse work perfectly fine. I suspect this is because I have FileVault enabled and the USB dongle's driver is not loading at boot?\nIt seems to me the best solution would be to leave my keyboard paired to my iMac's built-in module and only pair my mouse to the USB dongle, since I can login without needing my mouse, but I can't seem to find a way to use both Bluetooth modules concurrently. Is that possible?\nAlternatively, is it possible to configure macOS or my iMac's EFI to load the USB dongle driver at boot? Replacing my iMac is not an option for me at this stage but I'm open to any other alternative ideas too. Thanks.\n\nA: After some back and forth with Apple Support I've learnt that yes, macOS can use two Bluetooth HCI controllers at the same time, but the same driver cannot be used for multiple devices at the same time. As both my internal Bluetooth module and the USB dongle I purchased use a Broadcom chipset, macOS uses the same driver and that's why I cannot use both at the same time.\nThe solution is to use a USB dongle which does not contain a chipset made by the same manufacturer as the internal Bluetooth module. Broadcom seem to make the majority of chipsets used in most Bluetooth USB dongles - however I've found the 'Orico BTA-403-BK' which uses a CSR8510 chipset, which is manufactured by Qualcomm, who acquired a company called Atheros in 2011, whose Bluetooth drivers are natively supported by macOS. I'll report back after the Orico arrives with my final result.\n", "Q: What commands can be issued to Excel for Mac from the terminal?

The display is samsung C34H89x, ultrawide 100hz. I'm connecting it with USB-C and my MacBook Pro supports 100hz, but the air does not. Is that a limitation of the air?\n\nA: According to MacTracker (fan, not affiliated) the Macbook Air (retina, 13inch, 2018) supports:\n\nOne external display with 5120 by 2880 resolution at up to 60 Hz, Up to two external displays with 4096 by 2304 resolution at up to 60 Hz\n\nThe 2020 air is as follows:\n\nOne external 6K display with 6016 by 3384 resolution at 60 Hz, one external 5K display with 5120 by 2880 resolution at 60 Hz, up to two external 4K displays with 4096 by 2304 resolution at up to 60 Hz\n\nSo not 100Hz.\n", "Q: Catlina Security: Does root need permissions? Consider the new privacy system in Catalina. E.g. disk access, cam, mic, input etc. Does an application run as root need such permissions or is everything inherently granted?\n\nA: Even if an application can run as root, in macOS Catalina and some previous versions, SIP prevents root from making changes to certain protected files. As of macOS Catalina, system files are stored in a separate volume that is mounted read-only. As for the privacy settings, applications even if they run as root must ask and get permission from the user in order to get access to Full Disk Permissions, Microphone, Camera, etc.. Note that this might differ in Macs with the Apple T2 Security chip. Also, as @nohillside mentioned, it is important to determine whether it is an application that you created or not because macOS' security features determine what an application can do and whether it can run by Code Signing. If it is an app that you developed that isn't signed or isn't on the App Store, then the permissions might be different. In general, every application must ask for permission before getting access.\n\nA: Root is basically no better than any admin account on Catalina. \n", "Q: Print multiple email messages from Apple Mail to individual PDFs My goal is to be able to highlight a number of messages in Apple Mail then run a process to print them each to a PDF.

Also, by semi-automating this, it gives you the opportunity to select where you want the exported PDF document(s) to go, if other then what's already selected.

There are a few things to be aware of.\n\n\n*\n\n*For initial set up you will need to connect your MacMini to a monitor, keyboard and mouse.  Once you've set it up you can hide it away (provided that you have a good flow of air for cooling) and connect from your iPad.\n\n*Due to some oddity in macOS or in the Mac Mini yourself, you won't get full performance in this configuration.

My carrier is AT&T. Since all Apple stores are closed, I am wondering if I can purchase a new iPhone 11 Pro Max from apple.com? Is it possible to put the old SIM card from the iPhone 8 Plus into the new iPhone? Do I need to contact my carrier AT&T at all during this process (since my physical device will be changed)? Thanks.\n\nA: I did same, moving from iPhone 6 to 11. All I needed to do was take out SIM card and put in new device. SIM card was same size.  I recommend you purchase the 'sim-free' or unlocked phone from Apple. It costs the same, and does not lock you into a carrier. It also supports AT&T towers (as well as verizon etc). If you purchase the AT&T phone, they generally want you to change your plan, update it or hassle you to death :)\nThere is no need to contact AT&T, as they do not require registration or activation as does say Verizon. I don't know if this is technical or just policy, but no need to call or configure anything, just put in the SIM Card. \nBe sure to backup your old phone to either iCloud or to iTunes on your Mac/PC. If you use iCloud, simply sign into iCloud on new phone, and iCloud will load all your apps and preferences from the old phone. If you use iTunes, simply attach your new phone to your PC/Mac and restore your data to the new phone.  If  you are using iTunes for backup, be sure backup using a password/encryption. If you do not, any passwords or logins will not transfer.\n\nA: Generally speaking this will work.\nThe SIM card sizes are the same between those two iPhones and as long as you purchase an iPhone with AT&T compatibility you can put the SIM from the iPhone 8 into the iPhone 11 Pro.\nIf you buy an AT&T compatible phone and have it delivered it will likely come with instructions on how to activate it. You can call 611 on the old phone and the CS rep will ask you for the SIM card number and the IMEI and do it for you or you can (likely) go here to activate it: https://www.att.com/checkmyorder/activations/activateWireless.rt.\nThen all you have to do is transfer your settings, which Apple makes easy these days with phone-to phone transfer of all your stuff and download of your Apps.\n", "Q: FireVault Password I deleted some important files that run my MacBookPro(I am not specifically sure as I deleted thousands to open up space) Now the problem is my password works but every time it comes to ask for my password AGAIN to enable the touchID (mine is a 2017 MacBookPro with touch screen on it), the password never works. Then with Apple ID I reset my password again and again, the password never works when it comes to activating the TouchID. The problem is I want to log back in but the password never works( that's why I wonder some important key components are deleted). I am trying ti follow the instructions by reinstalling macOS Catalina and see if it works now.\n\nA: Reinstall the OS.  This is a non-destructive process, and you have backups anyway, correct?\nYou can boot to Recovery mode and do this.

I've noticed that this occurs around 50% brightness (not even 100%). If I turn it lower to, say, 10-20%, it doesn't heat up anymore. I assume this heating is partially due to the thinness of the device, which conducts heat very easily. \nThis heat is rather uncomfortable on my hand while I write on my iPad. Is there any way to get rid of this heat without lowering the brightness too much? I don't want to reduce the brightness due to legibility. \nThere are some \"heatsink\" cases for iPhones; is there anything similar for the iPad anywhere? \n\nA: A strange way that I've gotten around this issue is by placing the iPad on a large heat sink—basically anything that can conduct heat really easily. An example is a laptop (that is turned off!) which can take in a lot of the heat generated from the iPad's body. The iPad needs to be placed in direct contact with the heat sink.\nThis actually significantly cools down the screen of the iPad, which allows me to place my hand comfortable on the screen while writing. It's still warm, but at least not burning hot. \n", "Q: Sharing MacBook internet to iPad via USB I was sharing my MacBook LAN connection to my iPad using the internet sharing feature. But after the most recent update, I cannot find the iPad USB and iPhone USB option to share the internet.

I wish to set Sublime Text as the default editor for entering commit message, when I run the git commit command from Terminal.\nBut when trying to do so, I am running into the following error:\n\nerror: There was a problem with the editor ''/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl' -n -w'.\n  Please supply the message using either -m or -F option.\n\nWhat could be going wrong? How do I resolve the error message, and set things such that Sublime Text opens automatically for entering commit message when running git commit command from Terminal.\n\nA: Start by making sure you have Sublime Text for macOS installed on your computer. You can install it using either of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download it from the official website from the download page.\n\n*If you use Homebrew, you can install it via Homebrew Cask by running the following command-line in Terminal.app in macOS:\nbrew cask install sublime-text\nOnce you have the app installed, it should be available under /Applications directory on your Mac. (Assuming that in case 1, you have copied the Sublime Text.app bundle into the /Applications folder as instructed).\nOnce installed, this should be the path of the Sublime Text.app bundle and the editors executable file respectively:\n\n\n*\n\n*App bundle: /Applications/Sublime Text.app\n\n*Executable: /Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/MacOS/Sublime Text\nNow, we'll use the executable's path above to set it as the editor for git command to use for writing commit message. Run the following command to do so:\ngit config --global core.editor \"/Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/MacOS/Sublime\\ Text\"\n\nNotice how we have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Specified the path for the executable and not the app bundle.\n\n*Included the path into double-quotes\n\n*Backslash-escaped the space characters present in the path.\nOnce done you'd be set. Now make sure that the editor is not running, go to the Terminal, change to the directory containing your repository, stage some changes, and run the commit command. Sublime Text should be opened for you to enter the commit message. Write your commit message, save the file (you can use keyboard shortcut Command + S), and quit the editor. Your commit should get recorded.\nNow that was about how to configure and use the desired editor. Whether it's a recommended approach or not is a matter of personal preference. Most folks prefer using a command-line editor which makes the overall workflow much simpler as everything gets done then and there without leaving the Terminal.\nYou may want to refer to this excellent post to learn in detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using TextEdit as your git editor\nIf you have installed Sublime Text in an alternate location (such as in ~/Applications, i.e. a folder in your Home directory), you'd have to change to use the appropriate path.\n", "Q: Set permissions for sharing only user through terminal I am sharing my media folders on my local network by means of a sharing only user. The \"sharing only\" user is given read access to these folders, and anyone can connect with the user's log in credentials over smb in order to gain access to the files. However, when I add a new file to the shared folder, the sharing user does not have access to it, and I need to change the file permissions manually. I do this with finder by selecting folder info and reapplying the current read/write privileges to all enclosed items.\n\nAre there any quicker methods for this procedure? Can it be done via terminal? Note that I cannot log into the shell as a sharing user. Can the read permissions be added automatically whenever a new file is added to the folder? Also, the machine in question is running Lion, so simple solutions are preferred.\n\nA: I solved the probelm by setting the permissions in the following way:\nsudo chmod -R +a \"user:USER_NAME allow list,search,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\" PATH_TO_DIRECTORY/\n\nThis does the trick of changing the folder permissions so it propagates the users permissions automatically when new files are added. In this example\nallow list,search,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\n\nare copied from the permissions of the sharing only user, and I have added\nfile_inherit,directory_inherit\n\nin order to allow the files and directories within the original directory to automatically inherit the permissions.\n", "Q: Move from android after intially declining I have a blank Iphone 6 I am moving to.

But now I can not find out how to access it.\nCan I still run the \"Move from android\" operation, after I initially declined it, and completed the rest of the setup process?\n\nA: You have to wipe the phone to get the assistant to run. It won’t merge content, just import on to a blank device.  Make a backup if you want and then in settings, erase all content and settings. Then you can run the Android import and get all the migration done and review. \nWorst case, you examine the data, sync or export contacts and apps and then erase / restore your current backup and merge the data. \n", "Q: invisible rectangles blocking upper left of screen Since upgrading to Catalina (2016 Macbook Pro) a few weeks ago, every now and then I find there are \"invisible rectangles\" on on the screen where I can’t move my mouse.\nThey're always [edit months later: not 100% always, actually] anchored to the top left, and could be on the primary or secondary monitor. They're varying widths and heights that don’t seem to correspond to any specific application windows. They don’t go away if you quit or hide applications. The usual width is anywhere from about 100 to 400px, and the height is anywhere from 200px to the full height of the screen.\nTheses things do disappear on their own sometimes, but disconnecting the external monitor doesn’t get rid of them — it just moves them the laptop screen, but usually with different proportions. They're always gone after a restart.\nI can’t seem to connect these to any specific app; like I said, they persist even if I quit all apps including utils that just run in the menu bar.\nHere’s a screen recording of me trying to move the mouse to the upper left corner, via regular moving and dragging a selection area: https://imgur.com/a/lyVPhrq\nI've tried looking in Activity Monitor when this is happening, but even with all the regular apps quit, there are still tons of system processes going on so it's hard to spot anything unusual.\nThis look/sound like anything any of you have seen before?\n\nA: In case people miss it in the comments under the question, here's a link to the resolution that someone noted on a different post for the same issue:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/405842/45269\n", "Q: How do I download apps in ipad mini ios9.3.6 I known my ipad is old version.but im  trying to download apps from app store .but the apps are incompatible to the ipad..is there any other way to still get apps in my ipad???\n\nA: It is possible to download older versions of an app from the iOS App Store, but you must already have \"bought\" (or used \"Get\" for a free app) the app using the Apple ID used by your older iPad.\nOnce the app is registered as Purchased (Apple calls it this even if it's a free app) against your Apple ID, you can go into the Purchased tab on the App Store on your older iPad and download from there.\nYou will get a pop-up \"Download an older version of this app?\" (\"The current version requires iOS X.X or later, but you can download the latest compatible version\") where you choose Download.\nSo to be able to do this, if you haven't already got the app, you do need a second iOS device using the same Apple ID for the App Store.\n\nA: It is not possible to do this unless you jailbreak the iPad.

Catalina After installing Catalina, my in-built TextEdit doesn't work anymore, neither by clicking the icon nor from the application.

WindowServer is eating a lot of CPU, idling at 10-20%-ish even with nothing much running. Fans are constantly going because of it.\nI've disabled transparency and stopped (virtual) screens having their own spaces (as recommended elsewhere), to no avail. Also tried killing random things to see if anything sorts it out - no luck.\nRunning log stream --predicate '(process == \"WindowServer\")' --debug I can see it's dumping the following into its debug logs very frequently, 10+ times per second, which seems like it may be related:\n2020-05-06 23:54:23.680073+0100 0x4e7      Debug       0x0                  228    0    WindowServer: (CoreDisplay) [com.apple.CoreDisplay:default] [DEBUG] - On display 0x2b287853, surface is not detached, CoreDisplay is detached (0x00000000), DetachCode = 0\nAny ideas what's going on?\nEdit: as someone asked: The screens I was referring to are virtual screens. I do have an external monitor, but this still happens with it detached.\n\nA: Answering my own question with what I've learned:\n\n*\n\n*HiDPI resolutions eliminate the error message from the logs. SetResX has a HiDPI resolution for my monitor's native res - using that looks the same as the \"more space\" scaling, but without the errors. This reduces CPU use and heat a bit.\n\n\n*As dumb as it sounds, \"clamshell mode\" (ie, shutting the lid) helps quite a bit. I guess it helps not having to render the built-in screen\nWindowServer is still using quite a bit more CPU than I'd like, but those two things have reduced it a fair bit.\nOther things that I've seen others have success with but haven't been able to confirm myself: Using charging ports on the right rather than left reduces heat, and tweaking refresh rates by as little as 0.1Hz has dramatically reduces energy usage for some people.\nEDIT: Clamshell mode seems to let me use the monitor's native res without using SetResX without causing the errors. I think this is down to having the machine render standard and HiDPI resolutions at the same time.\n\nA: Try https://chromeisbad.com/. In my case Google Chrome was the issue and uninstalling it (and, most important, Keystone) solved all my problems.\n\nA: I, too, have run into consistently high WindowServer CPU usage since upgrading to Big Sur (a few weeks ago).\nAfter upgrading to Big Sur I ran into generally sluggish window management / movement, and macOS feeling like it was \"very tired\", and have looked for answers for some time. Today things got really slow, with missed keystrokes while typing into iTerm, and WindowServer CPU usage running at 95% consistently. Reboots \"solved\" the problem for a while, but always after a short time things got slow again.\nThen I found this article and the link to \"Chrome is Bad\". I followed the instructions (in Chrome is Bad) to remove Chrome and Keystone to the letter, rebooted, and switched to Brave.\nThe difference is literally night and day. Switching between apps / windows is now, once again, snappy. No more dropped keystrokes in iTerm and other apps. Moving windows from the internal display to my external (4K Dell) monitor is smooth as butter, where before it would become jerky as windows moved onto the external display.\nI am still struggling to believe that Chrome / Keystone are the culprits—since neither shows high CPU when the problems show themselves—but I am (very) happy with the result.\nIn short, it will take a great deal for me to switch back to Chrome now, especially since all of my Chrome extensions work flawlessly in Brave.\n\nA: Macbook pro 2019 16 has a well-known problem regarding high CPU/GPU usage when external displays are connected (See related thread here). The problem is due to the fact that external display connection is hard-wired to external GPU. If you are using the computer with external displays attached, you can test to see if the problem continues when you detach all external displays. \nAdditionally, you can try to set the screen resolution to default if you are using one of the scaled modes. It is also well known that the scaled resolutions in MacOS tasks the CPU and GPU considerably. \n\nA: I'm facing this too with messages like surface is not detached, CoreDisplay is detached for every screen I have connected, clam shelling didn't have a visible affect.\nWhat did have an affect:\n\n*\n\n*Firefox 84.0.2, seems to have a significant change when I close it\nand open it (with 17 windows and probably 2-10 tabs each, I know\nit's a problem...).\n\n*iTerm2 had the status bar on with many windows open too each with a status bar that was indicating Git Branch/CPU%/MEM%/Battery/etc. Disabling the status bar had the biggest effect on the WindowServer process.\n\n13\" MBP 2016, on Big Sur\n\nA: I have DELL UP3216Q external monitor. I had the same problem with \"surface is not detached, CoreDisplay is detached\" errors being spammed when I run log stream --predicate '(process == \"WindowServer\")' --debug. I'm using the external monitor with the Mac lid closed. \nThe errors stopped when I changed System Preferences >  Displays > Display scaling settings so that scaling is not maximum on the external monitor. If I change the scaling back to maximum (more space) the errors start again on logging mode. \nWindowServer CPU use was reduced slightly, but it is still around 30 %. Atleast the fan stopped spinning so fast.\n\nA: My problems were completely identical with OP's, and my logs were showing the exact same results as well.\nI tried many things to work this one out from my research on the Internet, but no luck.\nIn my case the issue was resolved by changing the refresh rate from 75Hz to 60Hz. I don't know the reason but it is magically decreased as soon as I did that. CPU usage is better than ever, no fan noise which was the most problematic issue for me. Also, changing Displays > Color > Display Profile from PHL245E1 to SD170M-A might have helped as well, but after I changed it back to HD one, no significant CPU increase or fan noise detected. Btw, I realized that the Color profiles have HD and SD modes, and in my case PHL245E1 profile is HD one while SD170M-A is, well, obviously the SD one.

Those name to address relationships are ultimately managed by the network admin.\nYour client can’t arbitrarily assign names to IP addresses as your Mac is not the DNS server.\nThe /etc/hosts file is for you and you alone and must be manually updated (if necessary) when you change networks because there is nothing that’s mapping the actual router address to the name you’ve arbitrarily given it.\n", "Q: Can't launch Finder window from terminal on Mojave open isn't behaving as expected on Mojave.

Any hints?\nEdit:\nIt is working now after letting my laptop go to sleep for a while, for whatever reason. If you run into this issue, I guess just try a reboot.\n\nA: Not able to reproduce the error as I have access to Catalina's and High Sierra's macs but not Mojave. But you may want to try if updating permissions for your Terminal.app and iTerm.app resolved the issue:\n\nSystem Preferences> Security&Privacy> Privacy> add both apps to \"Accessibility\" and \"Automation\" lists\nDeleting & re-adding them could also help (it worked for me a few weeks back, re-enabling osascript assistive access to the system UI for my terminal scripts that had suddenly stopped working).\n\nNota & Disclaimer: control panel headings above are Catalina's - High Sierra has only \"Accessibility\" - Mojave's should be close enough though -- Obviously changing any such Security settings is done at your own risks etc... -- while I did not have to do it in my case, logoff/logon could help ensure the permissions are properly applied.\n\nA: It should be doable and you have the right general idea but what you need to do instead is add the \" -R \" flag:\nopen -R /Library\n\nIf you type just \"open\" at a command prompt you'll get the options.\n", "Q: Why do my environment variables keep getting wiped out in Mac OS Catalina? I am currently using MacOS Catalina, and every time my computer boots up from having shut down the environment variables get wiped out. I literally have to manually run export FOO=bar each time my computer boots up.\nI have tried adding the environment variables to ~/.bash_profile but that doesn't seem to work, I think because Catalina uses zsh as opposed to bash. (Is there a way to switch back?)\nAnyways, how do I persist environment variables so that I don't have to manually export them every time? Could something be wrong with my computer that's causing this? There are also some other weird issues when my computer does a fresh boot.\n\nA: You need to create a file ~/.zshrc and put your export statements in there. The shell does not magically remember what you exported last time. You will need to put them in a file that will get sourced each time you start your shell, such as .zshrc.\n", "Q: How do I disable the three finger double tap to zoom gesture?

I suspect you have the \"Use trackpad gesture to zoom\" enabled.

Sublime supports them out of the box, see https://docs.sublimetext.io/guide/customization/color_schemes.html and https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/color_schemes.html.\n\nA: \nbut I don't want context to define my text color. I WANT to do it. I should be responsible for this. \n\nThe issue with this is that good code editors ideally do not like to modify your source files. \nFor your use case the editor will have to store some extra information (metadata) somewhere so that it can keep track of, and display, the right colour to you in the editor. It can do this by storing this additional metadata in your source file itself or by storing it separately in its own database or a separate file. \nObviously adding this extra information in the source file may interfere with code execution, when you run your code. Storing the data separately is better but this data can be lost if you don't copy the metadata file / rules too when copying your source file and viewing it in a different system.\nThat's why most code editors display colours based on context, after analysing your code, as this way, they don't have to include any additional data in your source file.\n\nAnyway, you can try the first approach by defining your own metadata and storing it in your source code using TextMate. \nTextMate editor has a feature called Bundles (equivalent to macros or scripts). \nYou should be able to do what you want by creating your own bundle to search for some specific keywords in code comments (like NOTE, WARNING, TODO or RED, BLUE, GREEN etc.) and defining that when such keywords are encountered the text following them should be coloured with whatever colour you have defined for them. \nHere's the documentation on TextMate Bundles.\n\nOtherwise, just use Pages and write your code in that. And when you want to execute your code, manually copy and paste it to a text file and run it. \n", "Q: Fake GPS location for specific app on iPhone Is there a way to give an app a specific location that is not the iPhone's true location?\nI.e., I don't want to block location services for an app, but rather I want to make the app think it is getting location services but that the current location is different from the phone's actual location.\n\nA: I have not tested any of these methods, but a quick search reveals the following apps / hacks that claim to do this:\n\n*\n\n*iSpoofer - Claims to \"Easily simulate any GPS location on your iPhone/iPad/iPod\".\n\n*iTools - Claims to \"Perfectly fake GPS location on an iPhone / iPad\".\n\nSource: How to fake a GPS location on your phone\nA more complicated way of doing this manually, without installing any app is also described here: How to Fake Location on iPhone Without Jailbreak.\n", "Q: Late 2019 Macbook Air with Intel Core i5 8GB RAM 128 SSD I have a late 2019 MacBook air with an Intel Core i5.

I was wondering if it is possible to replace the possessor. I have heard that the processor is attached to the logic board so I am open to getting a new logic board. If anyone wants to help me out that would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: No, the processor is soldered. I highly doubt buying a logic board is a good choice. You can't buy it from Apple, so you're stuck with third party options. It's also fairly likely that a working logic board that you want is going to be fairly expensive, maybe even more expensive than just buying a new laptop. \nYour best value is sell this mac - perhap helping someone get it set up so they are happy paying full price and then order the gear you want paying the delta in what your sells for and what the new costs.\n", "Q: shasum -a 256 on dmg file returns nothing I am getting no results when I check this freshly downloaded file from TDAmeritrade.\nI have searched for an answer to this but no joy.

My company uses a proxy pac file and provided me the URL, what I am unclear about is the other options. I confirmed we dont have WPAD setup, so I assume that there is no reason to enable Auto Proxy Discovery. Additionally, when I check the proxy.pac file, I can see that there are a number of domains and ip address ranges that are configured to bypass the proxy, so my assumption is that I dont need to modify the \"Bypass proxy settings for these Hosts & Domains\" section, would that be used if my company didnt have a pac file and I was entering the proxy server address for Web Proxy and Secure Web Proxy?\nAppreciate any insight that can be provided, I'm really looking to understand the various settings and options and which should be used in conjunction because Mac support is non-existent so I will be supporting myself. \nThanks!\n\nA: if you a .pac file. u can use it with the following syntax https://ip_addr:port/proxy.pac [or could] in Firfox.

Quite similar to garbage collection in a JVM. Please see the attached CPU History picture below. Note how at one place all cores were being fully used but they suddenly black out:\n\n\nThis is a recent phenomenon on my machine. Can someone confirm that it happens on their machine too?\nIf not, would someone help me identify the cause behind it.\n\nA: We see that CPU usage pattern all the time. I wouldn’t worry since that’s what cores should do.\nI would focus on one specific app at a time in Instruments if you feel it’s not idling when it should be idle and busy when it should be busy.\nMissing metrics from time to time isn’t something that concerns me in general absent other much more telling issues like crashes or stalls. Again, in that case I look at what’s stalling and what’s crashing and not the overall CPU graph to identify what next.\nIn the context of needing a hardware swap or repair, this is very likely software and if the CPU were having issues, you would have thousands of crashes and issues - not that one graph has missed updates. But, I would absolutely open a case with Apple 2 to 4 weeks before warranty ends to have them run diagnostics of offer you to bring in in for a formal hardware diagnostic. MRI would only show something massively wrong, and you clearly don’t have that, so the only way to test this would be in the shop Apple custom diagnostics that they have, plus getting an experienced tech to load test your Mac.\n", "Q: Cant Close Windows, app already quit I am running a 2019 macbook pro with GIMP 2.10 installed\nFor some reason, gimp's windows will stay open, even after the app is quit\nhow can I close these windows?\n\nA: I face similar problem with octave-GUI. \nI run \nkillall -9 octave \nkillall -9 octave-gui\n\ntwice to get rid of that.\nSo you can run \nkillall -9 GIMP\n\nMake sure you're using case sensitive name of the app. \n", "Q: Catalina's usage of 15-plus GB in 'Other Volumes' versus Sierra I have two Macbook Airs each with an SSD of about 120 GB, with the difference being that one has Sierra and the other has Catalina.  The user data are virtually identical (though the one of Catalina has somewhat fewer and smaller user caches).  The two Airs are of models that are about two years apart.\nBoth SSDs are 120 GB and each is in an MBA albeit of models that are two years apart.\nThe differences:–\nThe SSD with Sierra shows Used 103.41 GB with Purgeable less than a gig, and Free 15.76 GB.\nThe SSD with Catalina (new MBA) shows Used only 98.23 GB (because I nuked a good few files and apps) with Purgeable less than a half-gig, and Free 7.08 GB.  The difference is 'Other Volumes' with 15.81 GB.\nIf this comprises System files and caches, well, it should be on the SSD with Sierra too but it's not.  Indeed, all caches should be greater in size on the Sierra SSD because I purposely didn't copy a good many user caches over to the new Air's disk.\nAlso, this MBA with Catalina came with the SSD partitioned into 5 volumes, unlike the one with Sierra.  Why?\nFinally, /private/var on the old one is at 4.88 GB and the new one is at 4.91 GB so that's not the problem either.\nFor background please see closed question \nSierra to Catalina - System Bloat - Paring System Files - Disk Usage\nSo my question is, what is 'Other Volumes' with 15.81 GB and can this space be recovered?\nThese\n75 GB is missing under 'Other volumes' category\nWhat is 'Other Volumes'?\ngo into a bit of it. \nNow I could do diskutils on the two Airs and draw inferences but they'd be just that -- inferences.  What I am seeking is definitive answers from experts who know the facts.\nI know about du, df, and the various disk-usage reporting utilities and already ran OmniDiskSweeper (and it didn't tell me anything new though even in root it 'sees' only 100.8 GB of an about 120 GB SSD; my guess is it's because volume(s) of about 19 GB weren't mounted).  So please don't refer me to such utilities as my question isn't \"Where's my disk space gone?\" but is along the lines of, \"What is Catalina doing to the SSD that Sierra didn't/doesn't.\"\n------ Added 09-05-2020 -------\nOutput of diskutil apfs list :\nAPFS Container (1 found)\n|\n+-- Container disk1 C78E5D0E-464C-4704-980A-7F4122C7909B\n    ====================================================\n    APFS Container Reference:     disk1\n    Size (Capacity Ceiling):      121123069952 B (121.1 GB)\n    Capacity In Use By Volumes:   113780142080 B (113.8 GB) (93.9% used)\n    Capacity Not Allocated:       7342927872 B (7.3 GB) (6.1% free)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Store disk0s2 5F73E550-435E-4253-9F0D-3B77BF79B255\n    |   -----------------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Physical Store Disk:   disk0s2\n    |   Size:                       121123069952 B (121.1 GB)\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk1s1 70F87157-C6ED-42AE-BB4E-FD70F566B001\n    |   ---------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s1 (System)\n    |   Name:                      Macintosh HD (Case-insensitive)\n    |   Mount Point:               /\n    |   Capacity Consumed:         10767216640 B (10.8 GB)\n    |   FileVault:                 No\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk1s2 C74FD6D6-48B4-4F19-ACFD-F02460714B80\n    |   ---------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s2 (Data)\n    |   Name:                      Macintosh HD - Data (Case-insensitive)\n    |   Mount Point:               /System/Volumes/Data\n    |   Capacity Consumed:         97966219264 B (98.0 GB)\n    |   FileVault:                 No\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk1s3 1CD24A7E-B82F-4169-8858-F6A80A12C2E8\n    |   ---------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s3 (Preboot)\n    |   Name:                      Preboot (Case-insensitive)\n    |   Mount Point:               Not Mounted\n    |   Capacity Consumed:         81256448 B (81.3 MB)\n    |   FileVault:                 No\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk1s4 AF3723F8-1F7A-4FE9-BC25-C8CDDFFB1121\n    |   ---------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s4 (Recovery)\n    |   Name:                      Recovery (Case-insensitive)\n    |   Mount Point:               Not Mounted\n    |   Capacity Consumed:         542916608 B (542.9 MB)\n    |   FileVault:                 No\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk1s5 839A52DD-021E-4538-817E-741BA79DC84E\n        ---------------------------------------------------\n        APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s5 (VM)\n        Name:                      VM (Case-insensitive)\n        Mount Point:               /private/var/vm\n        Capacity Consumed:         4296101888 B (4.3 GB)\n        FileVault:                 No\n\n------ Added 11-05-2020 -------\nMore info if anyone is interested. It's diskutil list that did the trick.\nSierra has 3 partitions; Catalina, 5.  The data partition and 2 very small partitions of only megs are common to both.  Here's what's additional in Catalina:\n    1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            10.8 GB    disk1s1\n    5:                APFS Volume VM                      4.3 GB     disk1s5\n\nSo this probably accounts for those 15 gigs that went MIA from Sierra to Catalina, and this is what Catalina is doing to the SSD that Sierra doesn't.\n\nA: Catalina splits the system volume into two separate parts: the System volume, which is mounted as read-only, for security; and the Data volume, which contains the rest of the 'disk'. These two parts are presented in the Finder as one disk.\nSo, you have a System volume of 10.8 Gb: this contains the OS and Apple bundled apps.\nThen, a Data volume: this contains everything else on the main volume.\nThe VM volume stores swap data and sleep images.\nIn short: these are all things that in Sierra were all on one volume.\nWhy the difference, if the two Macs are identical? Well, it may just be down to different reporting methods in the OS, and what constitutes 'free' space. Either way, both disks are very full and I'd be looking to offload even more user data to increase the free space.\n", "Q: Remove attachments from sent messages I've got an older Macbook with a 256 GB HDD drive, running 10.12.6 (Sierra), with Mail 10.3.\nIt looks like a huge amount of storage (roughly 56 GB worth!) is being taken up by old Mail attachments — mostly attachments to sent messages, not received messages.\nWhere are these stored, and what is the easiest way to remove them?  I've found a lot of reference articles online about deleting the contents of the Mail Downloads folder, but I don't know if that's what I'm looking for, as these are not attachments I received, but rather ones I sent. I don't want to \ndelete the entire message -- I really want to keep a record of what I sent, to whom, and when.\nAnd if possible I'd like to keep the attachments on the server (it's a Gmail account) so that I can retrieve them if need be.

But is it at least the same, as the base model Mid 2020 13\"?\nWould public geekbench results for above macs be an effective comparison?\n\nA: Sure, you can trust geekbnech for quite neutral results for CPU capabilities for macs in the last 5 years.\nThat being said, I’m never in a case where the CPU is what is actually holding me back. The things that chew CPU are never things I’m waiting on and I go have dinner or let it run to complete. The things that make me happy are good software, efficient software, not having memory leaks and fast storage. \nI get that on a 2015 MacBook with a 1.2 GHz CPU and NVMe SSD with 8 GB of RAM. All of the machines you specify are overkill for what I need. The question is what benchmark and code do you run - can you profile it on your current mac and then decide if the investment in a new mac is worth the money in time you save.\nNo benchmark will tell you that.\n", "Q: Do I need to delete an app's related data in ~/Library myself when I delete it? When I delete an app (move it to Trash) do I also need to delete its related data in ~/Library myself?\nAccording to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does deleting Mac App Store apps in Launchpad delete related files in the Library folders too?\nsome apps keep their data in ~/Library even after it's deleted. I find it kind of annoying that the app keeps its data even after it is deleted. The only reason I can think of that usage is maybe if I reinstall the app later, I can get my old data back. But I still prefer to deleting all its related data if I delete the app.\nMy second question is is this the main function of other uninstaller tools?\n\nA: \nWhen I delete an app (move it to Trash) do I also need to delete its related data in ~/Library myself?\n\nA user is not generally expected to delete those file themselves. If you are aware of, and wish to delete them, you can do so. The most that you would lose is the app specific preferences and any user data which could be re-used if you reinstall the app in future.\n\nMy second question is is this the main function of other uninstaller tools?\n\nSince you didn't name any tool, this cannot be answered concretely, and would depend upon choice of tool. But a tool that lets you delete an apps' related data is generally expected to show the files/folders that it would affect and should let you choose what items to keep.\n\nA: You can delete the application data if you wish. If you leave it, and you later install the application again, things like preferences will be restored from the original installation.\nRegarding your second question about uninstallers, most applications don't need them or provide them. They're usually only provided for applications that make configuration changes to your account or system. For instance, if an application automatically runs in the background when the system boots, the uninstaller will remove that setting.\nThe uninstaller might remove files in ~/Library, but I think that tends to be more in the province of third party application cleaners. These try to find all the files related to the application and remove them.\n", "Q: Can Apple MDM see what youtube videos I have watched?

I've reinstalled my 2015 MacBook Pro recently. Before that, I've created a full Time Machine backup to my local NAS with an automatically generated keychain password.\nUnfortunately, I cannot find this password anywhere. As far as I know, generated passwords are stored in the keychain automatically.\nIs there a way to recover / search keychain for that specific password?\n\nA: The password must be stored in the keychain of the Mac that uses it to make backups (otherwise that couldn't work and you would have to keep entering the password every time you restart or disconnect that drive).\nSearch your keychain for sparsebundle (or sometimes backupbundle) and/or the name of the drive. You should be able to find them in the system keychain. Make sure you have selected to display \"All objects\" or \"Passwords\".\nThe entry has a long hexadecimal name with dashes. I have seen some reports saying that the name is their computer name, but I have never seen anything else but these hexadecimal names.\nYou may find several entries. I recommend to try them in reverse order with regard to their modification date.\nAlternatively, you can set your own password like this:\n\n*\n\n*connect to the NAS with the credentials used for Time Machine\n\n*locate the Time Machine sparsebundle\n\n*open Terminal and enter (add a space after the command)\n\nhdiutil chpass \n\n\n\n*from Finder, draw the sparsebundle to the Terminal window\n\n*hit enter\n\nThis allows you to set a new password for the backup.

I was thinking it didn't get any damage, but several keys are not working anymore and the keyboard black light is also down.\n\nYour keyboard is damaged and it needs to be replaced.\n\nthe left Shift ⇧ control ⌃ option ⌥ does not respond so I can't reset the SMC\nSo far I tried to:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*reset NVRAM\n  \n*start up in Safe Mode\n  \n*reinstall macOS\n  \n\nLet's look at this from the perspective of an automotive analogy.  None of these things are going to fix a physical issue with your computer.  \n\n\n*\n\n*SMC/NVRAM reset.  This is like getting into an accident where a wheel falls off and thinking that if you can only reset the check engine light, things will work again. \n\n*Safe Mode.  Same accident, but this time you remove all the bumper stickers, the large spoiler, empty the groceries from the trunk, clean out the glove compartment and put in a fresh, clean tank of gas.  \n\n*Reinstall macOS.  Again, same accident, but this time you just repaint and reupholster the interior.  \nYour keyboard is broken:   Keyboard key stuck or not being recognized; how to fix\n\nI wrote the following to shed some light on the some of the commonly held misconceptions regarding the all too familiar procedures for \"fixing\" a broken Mac by resetting the SMC/NVRAM, resintalling the software, etc.  I hope I can save you some time and alleviate any consternation with respect to the diagnostic procedures in getting you to a solution to your problem. \n\nResetting Your NVRAM/SMC, Safe Mode, Verbose Mode, and reinstalling macOS\nSo often we see these as the very first go-to suggestions/solutions to every problem that a Mac faces. 99% of the time, they are not the right thing to do.  So, what do they actually do?\nReset the NVRAM\nMany times you see this incorrectly referred to as PRAM as well.  NVRAM means Non-Volatile RAM (Random Access Memory).  PRAM is Parameter RAM.  PRAM was used with the PPC (Power Macintosh) like the G3, G4, PowerBook, etc.  NVRAM is used with the Intel CPU based Macs.  \nYour NVRAM holds pre-boot environment variables like initial screen resolution, boot volume, Bluetooth keyboard identification, boot chime volume, etc.  It has nothing to do with the running of your Apps or whether some of the keys on your keyboard work or don't.  \nResetting your SMC\nThis is your power controller or what is known in the rest of the computer industry as a PMU (Power Management Unit).  It's a chip made by Texas instruments that manages the flow of current, the fans, monitors the temperature, etc.  There's nothing special about Apple's SMC other than it's got proprietary code and you cannot purchase it from TI.  \nApple tells you when you should reset your SMC and all of the reasons have to do with power, temp, sleep, etc.  It will not have any effect on software, keyboard, or wireless.  \nLooking at it from a PC users perspective, how many times have you heard HP or Dell tell their users to \"reset the PMU\" to solve an issue?\nSafe Mode/Verbose Mode\nThese are diagnostic modes.  Safe mode simple prevents 3rd party software and kexts from loading so that you have the cleanest slate possible so you can see if the problem with with macOS or something else.  Verbose mode simply allows you to \"see\" all of the boottime messages that you might find what's hanging up your system.\nThese two modes won't fix the problem - they're there to help you diagnose the problem and ultimately reach a solution.\nReinstalling macOS\nToo many times I see this one of the first things people do to fix a problem.  Keyboard or WiFi not working?  Reinstall! This should be near the bottom of the list of things to do when trying to solve an issue.  In the case of a keyboard, booting into Safe Mode or even into recovery will give you a much better idea of what the problem is.  Generally speaking, if the problem exists in one of these clean macOS environments another one (a fresh install) isn't going to solve it.  \nAnd just to show that a reinstall is in fact a \"last resort,\" you can install a clean version of macOS onto a USB thumb drive, boot off of that and see if it solves your problem.  If it doesn't, then you wouldn't have wasted your time wiping your drive, risking your data, only to reconfigure your Mac how you had it prior to the reinstall.   If a tech leads with \"reinstall macOS,\" run to the nearest exit.\n", "Q: macOS Catalina watchdog timeout kernel panics Ever since upgrading to Catalina, my MacBook Pro 2018 randomly freezes up completely.

The TN2450 remaps the keys correctly, but a new problem has surfaced: The keys do not register when pressing more of them at the same time. Example: If typing the letters f and t fast after eachother, the t does not register if it is pressed too early. The f key has to be completely let go before pressing the t key. The problem can be replicated by holding the f key down while quickly press the t key multiple times. The first press does not register, but all the following presses does. The problem does not regard all remapped keys. The problem is not symmetric; the order of the keypresses matter.

But worth a try is the following. Go to system preferences / Keyboard and click on keyboard tab.  see image below.\n\nThere is a slider to adjust the delay time between keys.

Things are like this: Mac Pro and NAS sit close together, and are connected via bonded Ethernet through a switch allowing for ultra-fast transfer speed between the two.\nBeing in an old house, the switch itself is connected to the main router only via a PowerLine interface. While this actually brings web surfing to the Mac Pro's Ethernet, the truth is that for this purpose only WiFi is way faster (about 10x).\nFor the sake of this example let's assume the web router is 192.168.0.1, Mac is 192.168.0.2 and NAS is 192.168.0.3; wifi is en2 and ethernet is bond0. I need my Mac to route all traffic through en2, except for traffic directed to 192.168.0.3 which should go through bond0 only.\nI tried moving Ethernet on top of service order stack and removing its IPV4 Gateway, but my Mac still keeps connecting to the NAS via WiFi even though Ethernet comes first.\nI understand I would need some kind of static route to do this, but after reading a lot of (contradictory) posts I'm still not sure how to exactly accomplish this...\nCan someone help me? What sort of code should I type in Terminal to create this static route and make sure it's still there after reboot?\nThank you.\n\nA: \nI tried moving Ethernet on top of service order stack and removing its IPV4 Gateway, but my Mac still keeps connecting to the NAS via WiFi even though Ethernet comes first.\n\nService order priority is great for different networks (i.e. home and work via VPN or work network and lab network).  If you're multi-homing to the same network (WiFi and Ethernet both connect to home), the priority doesn't matter.  Routes are determined by what gets advertised first, the least amount of latency, etc.  As you said, your WiFi is about 10x faster; it makes sense that the traffic will try to go through what it thinks is the fastest.   \nSet a static route for the host\nYou can set a static route for an individual host and ensure that all traffic bound for that host goes through a particular interface (gateway).  The route command takes the following syntax:\n% sudo route add -host <target host IP> <IP of network adapter>\n\nSo, in your case, using 0.3 as the NAS and 0.55 as your bonded interface, it would be as follows:\n% sudo route add -host 192.168.0.3 192.168.0.55\n\nAll traffic would be to that one host (NAS) would be routed though the bonded interface while everything else would go through WiFi.\nThe problem with this is that it's only temporary.  You'll need to rerun this command every time you boot and quite possibly can get overridden (see next section).  To automate it, you'll need to put this into a script (call it setroute.sh for example) and have it executed with launchd.  See the following posts on how to accomplish this:\n\n\n*\n\n*launchd plist format for running a command at a specific time on a weekday \n\n*How do I run an app using launchd at regular intervals?\n\n*How do I create a static permanent ifconfig alias?\nCreate a different subnet\nThis is my preferred solution because the NAS will be on it's own network isolated from the rest of the traffic by default.  You won't have to tell it where to go or what traffic to prioritize because it will already know that.  In addition RIP (Route Information Protocol) advertising packets can't override any static routes you may have put in.  Yes, your router can tell your Mac how to get to hosts automatically and this may conflict with what you want. \n\n\nWiFi Network -> 192.168.0.0/24   ← 254 hosts max\nNAS Network  -> 192.168.5.0/29   ← 6 hosts max\n\nSo, on your Mac, you'll have two network connections: 192.168.0.2 (WiFi)\nand 192.168.5.2 (Bonded Connection) to the switch (or directly to the NAS).  The NAS, 192.168.5.3,  will have it's connection to the same Ethernet switch that your Mac is connected to.  All traffic destined for the NAS will have no choice but to go through the bonded Ethernet while all other traffic will go via WiFi.\n\nA: TL;DR: if your static route doesn't work, but you have Wifi+Ethernet on your Mac, and 2 Ethernet ports on your NAS, you can configure one port on the NAS and the Ethernet port of your Mac to be on a different subnet than your wifi/router one (192.168.100.x vs 192.168.0.x: it doesn't really matter as long as they're different). The second port of your NAS can still be connected to the router via DHCP, to ensure remote sync processes keep working.\n\nOk everyone, this is for future reference for people in my same situation (a Mac with at least one Ethernet port and WiFi + a NAS with two ethernet ports).\nOne way you could accomplish the task of routing all traffic towards the NAS through one specific interface (in my case, Ethernet) and all the rest through WiFi could be as follows:\nOn the MAC:\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure WiFi for web surfing (usually, DHCP or a static address inside the router subnet). E.g.: if your router is 192.168.0.1, your Mac's WiFi card could be assigned 192.168.0.2. Subnet mask will be 255.255.255.0, and obviously the Gateway will be your router's address.\n\n*Turn DHCP off for your Ethernet port and manually configure its address inside a different subnet from the one where the router is. E.g.: you could set it to -say- 192.168.100.1, subnet mask always 255.255.255.0, leave \"Gateway\" blank (and check that DNS too is blank).\n\n*Make sure the Ethernet addresses are advertised first by placing\nEthernet on top of WiFi in the Services Order panel (click the gear button\nbelow the network services)\n\n\nLink your Mac to your NAS via a cable (or through a switch), and let's set the NAS this way: (remember that for this to work the NAS has to have two Ethernet ports, not one)\n\n\n*\n\n*Link one of the NAS Ethernet ports to your WAN network (the one with internet access). Set this interface as DHCP in the Network settings of the NAS. This will assign the NAS and address in the same pool of the router, and the Mac's (let's say 192.168.0.3)\n\n*Link the second Ethernet interface to your Mac's Ethernet, directly or via a switch (note that both connections coming from the NAS can run through the same switch and still work)\n\n*In your NAS' control panel turn DHCP off for this second interface (you don't want the router to talk to it!) and manually configure it to another address in the same pool of your Mac's Ethernet IP. In this example, it could be 192.168.100.2, Subnet mask 255.255.255.0, Gateway 192.168.100.1 (your Mac's address).\n\n\nYMMV depending on your NAS, or on your Mac's OS, but as far as I'm concerned I can testify that now on my MacOs 10.13.6 all \"standard\" traffic is correctly routed through WiFi, while the NAS (and the NAS only) is receiving full-speed traffic directly from the Ethernet connection.\nThis trick has one \"downside\", in that it will project not one but two NAS instances on the network (one is 192.168.0.x, the other 192.168.100.x), so obviously you'll have to make sure that you instruct your Finder to see the \"correct\" (Ethernet) NAS. If you keep addressing the other IP, its traffic will still be routed through WiFi.\nAs to the management console (usually reachable via web browser), it will keep working flawlessly on both addresses.\n\nThis is only one possible solution. The other route (no pun intended), via script + static route, would possibly be more elegant and streamlined, but it requires some scripting and it's seemingly harder to achieve.\nI'll post it anyway as soon as I'll get it to work.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 5,1 will only boot after multiple SMC resets I have a Macbook Pro 5,1 (late 2008) running El Capitan (10.11), which is the latest officially supported OS for that machine. When I turn it off I cannot turn it back on without resetting the SMC multiple times (sometimes up to 20 times, sometimes just once is enough). The problem only occurs when the machine is turned off for at least a few hours, otherwise it turns on perfectly. This makes me think, that there could be some kind of small battery on the logic board which drains too fast due to the age of the Macbook? It doesn't matter how much the main battery is charged.\nWhat I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*quick Apple Hardware Test without any results\n\n*used different RAM\n\n*used different internal HDD\n\n*resetted NRAM/PRAM\n\n*installed a new copy of the OS and then imported everything (Data and Settings) with the migration assistent\n\n\nAny other Ideas? \nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I’ve seen this before and it could be one of two things (generally speaking):\n\n\n*\n\n*failing power supply \n\n*failing/failed SMC chip\n\n\nWhen I mention \"power supply\" it can mean either the physical power supply like that in a Mac Pro (workstation) or the circuitry on the logic board of a MacBook (laptop) that manages where the current is sourced from - battery or external adapter.  There's power that goes to the SMC so that it can handle how and where power is distributed throughout the logic board.\nIt wouldn’t be a battery because when power is removed from an SMC chip, it actually resets.  So, resetting an already reset SMC wouldn’t do anything as you’ve demonstrated with the other numerous resets. However, what we have to remember is that when an SMC reset occurs, the whole system is being reset (warm power cycle). \nThe power supply (circuitry) could be failing in that not enough current is getting to the correct power rails until finally there’s enough capacity to get it to work; there could be dry solder contracts on any of the SMC components including the chip itself; or it could just be dying. \nThe least expensive DIY test you could do would be to replace the power supply with a known good one (if on a workstation), next followed by a replacement of the logic board.  Unfortunately, to get a proof positive diagnosis, you’d need high level told like an oscilloscope to accurately measure the power going to the individual power rails. \nUltimately, you'll need to send it in for service because there's nothing more that can be done from a DIY perspective.\n", "Q: Is there an easy way to find the specification pages for old Apple Computers that have now been removed from the Apple Support pages?

(And other problems) I've been using my MacBook air 2019 for quite some time now (9 months) and I've been getting 110 degrees fahrenheit on average with simple use like google chrome or safari. In fact, the highest I have gotten it to reach was 184 degrees fahrenheit. Is this normal? Does anyone else get this issue? Do you think a hard reset could solve this issue? I would like to mention that I have not downloaded any software that takes up much battery. Also, when I'm only using google chrome, my mac tends to only have 100 or fewer megabits of free ram. Another thing that I would like to mention is that my MacBook's REAL battery capacity has been going down by 2% every month. Does anyone know why I'm having all of these problems? Any response would be helpful! Thank you!\n\nA: Is this normal? Yes.\nDoes anyone else get this issue? Yes.\nDo you think a hard reset could solve this issue? No.\nAs for the battery: some 'settling' over the first few months is expected, but I'd try to take it to Apple before it's 12 months old. \n", "Q: Separate/different sharing of sub-folders in Notes.app I am trying to share a (sub)folder within a shared folder hierarchy with a different person, but this seems to not be possible in Notes.app on Catalina. ... ?\nLet's assume I have a folder structure in my Notes.app as the following\ntld\n- folder1\n  - folder1a\n  - folder1b\n- folder2\n\nfolder1, and thus everything beneath, is shared with user X read-write. Now I want, in addition, to share folder1b with user Y read-only (or, at least, read-write, too).\nThis does not seem to be possible or, at least, it does not work for me. Sometimes it turns out that Y get's the whole folder1 share, sometimes nothing, but I do not seem to get what I want. \nApple docs do not seem to say anything about this, finding info on the net was unsuccessful, partly because of the generic name (Notes.app). Does this work for anybody? All hints are appreciated! \n\nA: Yes you are right. You can share folders or individual notes in the Notes App. But you cannot share subfolders individually.\nAfter some testing I found the same issue as you:\nWhen you give person Y access to a subfolder, the whole parent folder with all notes and subfolders will be shared. When you try to remove access for Y from a subfolder, the access to the parent folder and all its content and subfolders will be removed. This is not a clever implementation, I have to admit.\nThe only solution using the Notes App for this purpose is to convert your subfolders to top level folders and set privileges individually for each folder and collaborator.\nUnlike I previously described, you can set privileges on a per user basis to read only or write. But the implementation seems not intuitive at first glance, since the access right dropdown appears first on the folder/file level. As soon as you set different privileges for different collaborators, this dropdown changes the the new option \"mixed privileges\".\n", "Q: MacOS wont boot after partitioning my SSD I installed Kali Linux on my iMac as Dual Boot.

Let me first clarify what the issue is,\nas the first respondent apparently had trouble understanding it.\nLike the OP, I have a few Terminal profiles with black or dark\ngray text on pastel backgrounds. For some reason, when macOS goes\ninto dark mode, there is some internal logic that'll invert this\n#000000 (or close to it) text foreground into #FFFFFF (or close\nto it), while leaving the background color unchanged. This leads\nto the effect shown in the OP's screenshot: white text on fairly\nbright background, i.e. basically unreadable.\nI've found a simple trick to make this go away: Go to the theme\nin preferences, to the \"text\" tab. In the \"text\" section on the\nright, there are three text foreground chits, for \"Text\", for\n\"Bold Text\", and for the \"Selection\". You'll note they're showing\nbright instead of dark when you're in dark mode. Click on the Text\none (or any of the others that bother you), switch the color picker\nthat comes up to the \"Color Sliders\" view, and select the \"HSB\nSliders\" setting from the dropdown.\nWhat you'll see now is that although the color shown in the main\npreferences screen is white (or bright gray), the bottom slider\nfor \"Brightness\" is in fact still set to all the way to the left.\nNow here's the trick that I found by accident: pull it that brightness\nslider just a little bit to the right, and you'll note the text color\nimmediately jumps back to dark. Now even if you set it back to the\nprevious setting, it'll now stay dark.\nThis reproduceably fixed it for me on Catalina on my MacBook Pro 2019.\nHope it helps others!\n\nA: This answer might be the one you are looking for.

Instead of trying to track down the correct place to modify the Finder settings under the hood — which is surprisingly difficult — this GUI-scripts the Finder to turn on only those tags you want to use at a given moment. The script presents you with a token field, where you enter the names of the tags you want activated (commas and returns are the separation characters), then it opens the Finder preferences window, loops through all the items in the table view, and clicks them on or off as needed so you'll only see the ones you want.

Basically, my Airpods worked fine with my iPhone, but when I tried to connect them to my MacBook, they would connect (Bluetooth icon shows a device connected, Airpods play the connect sound), then disconnect a few seconds later (also playing the disconnect sound). In those few seconds they never showed up under output/input audio devices.\nI tried without success:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-pairing Airpods with the MacBook\n\n*Un-pair and factory reset the Airpods (hold button until amber light flashes)\n\n*Delete the Bluetooth plist file on the MacBook\n\n\nWhat to try next?\n\nA: The fact that the Airpods connect to Bluetooth but never show up in Sound output/input devices indicate an issue with macOS system audio.

If not, try restarting the MacBook and connecting again.\n", "Q: Install Windows 7 on macoS High Sierra (MBP Late 2011) Device: MacBook Pro 8,2 (Late 2011)\nOperating System: macOS High Sierra\nSecurity Update: 2020-002\nBoot Camp: Version 6.1.0 (6067.60.1)\n\nContext:\nA couple of weeks ago I decided it was time to do a clean install - from scratch - of my macOS High Sierra and Windows 7 operating systems installed on my MacBook, after a year of use. I used this video as a guide to install macOS High Sierra:\nThe installation was correct and without errors, after that I installed the updates from the App Store following the steps of the support website for the installation of Windows 7 from macOS High Sierra with Boot Camp: https://support.apple.com/es-es/HT205016\n.\nIssue:\nFollowing the process above, Boot Camp created the installation drive, the disk was partitioned during the process and when the computer restarted, this error appeared:\n\nNo bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key\n\n\nI have been searching for ways to install Windows 7, without success. Among them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try 5 different USB 2.0 drives (HP, Sandisk, Kingston): Since in a video they think that the problem with this black screen warning is due to USB.\n\n*Install Windows 7 creating the boot from Windows on a PC with the Rufus application and start from the Mac boot screen (without using Boot Camp). It did not work, although if it recognized the usb with Windows 7 it was frozen when clicked, however with the ISO of Windows 10 following the same procedure if it installed correctly, but the version of my MacBook does not have the complete drivers for Windows 10 in addition to which in my opinion is quite slow compared to Windows 7.\n\nI have done the same installation process with BCA to install Windows 8, 8.1 and 10 and have got the same result.\n\nNo bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key\n\n\nA: If you are happy with Windows 10 and want sound then you will have to install to BIOS boot. The instructions for doing so can be found at Installing Windows 10 without DVD or Third Party Tools. I would recommend first uninstalling the UEFI booting Windows 10 you have already installed. This is not covered in the link given in this answer. \nAnother possibility would be to convert your existing Windows 10 installation from UEFI to BIOS booting. I have never tried this to fix a driver problem, but this might be worth attempting. The steps would be as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*From Windows, download gdisk.\n\n*Copy gdisk64.exe to the Windows 10 flash drive.\n\n*Boot from the Windows 10 flash drive.\n\n*Open a Command Prompt window.\n\n*Use Windows commands to remove the Windows UEFI boot files from EFI partition.\n\n*Use gdisk to convert internal drive to hybrid partitioning.\n\n*Use Windows commands to install the BIOS boot data and files.\n\n*Boot back to Windows.\n\n*Maybe reinstall the Window Support Software.\n\n", "Q: How to mount the pc/iso partition of an iso file when it also contains an HFS partition? I have a disc image with the .iso file extension. Mounting this brings up contents that look much like I would expect from something 20 years ago on a pre-OSX Mac. When I do a mount command in Terminal, it shows this file as mounting with the HFS filesystem (confirming my suspicions). But this was not a Mac-only disc, it's an image of a hybrid disc (or so I believe).\nIs there a way to mount this so that it looks like what a PC owner or Linux user would see? The manpage for hdiutil suggests absolutely nothing of use for the \"attach\" command. None of the options work.\nAnd the mount command is problematic in that I cannot figure out what options will make it work (other than that I need -t iso_9660, the other requirements seem quite different from what they'd be on linux).\n\nA: You can check that the .iso file does indeed have an HFS/HFS+ volume on it with the file command (I can't remember if this is native or if I installed it via homebrew... might have to do that yourself):\nfile -k --mime path/to/something.iso\n\nIf it does have an HFS volume, then the output will be 3 lines (instead of 2).\nsomething.iso: application/x-iso9660-image\n- application/x-apple-diskimage\n- application/octet-stream; charset=binary\n\nTo mount the PC portion, you have to do more than just doubleclick.\nhdiutil attach -nomount something.iso \n\nThis will produce output something like this:\n/dev/disk3              Apple_partition_scheme          \n/dev/disk3s1            Apple_partition_map             \n/dev/disk3s2            Apple_HFS\n\nKeep in mind that depending on what else you might have mounted, the disk number can change. If so, amend the following command:\nmount -t cd9660 /dev/disk3 ./path/where/contents/will/show\n\nAlso, you will need an empty directory, the path/where/contents/will/show. You can create it as you would any other way on OSX. It can be a relative path, or an absolute one. It won't automatically remove itself after you're done mounting this though.\nFinally, when you are ready to get rid of this, there are several commands to undo all of this.\numount ./path/where/contents/will/show\nhdiutil detach /dev/disk3\n\nDoing this more than once or twice has the tendency to cause my iMac running Mojave to lock up and required a reboot (but I had done this with as many as half a dozen ISOs at that point).\nI forget where I found this (didn't figure it out on my own), and I think it was on Stackoverflow. I apologize to whomever posted the answer there as I can no longer give credit. Answering it here though will make it easier for others to find.\n", "Q: Connecting windows laptop to iMac I have Lenovo Thinkpad T490 from work and I got my personal iMac 5k 2017. I have got a dell monitor and use that as my primary monitor and want to use iMac as secondary monitor.\nI have installed windows 10 on iMac using Bootcamp. I wanted to find out if I can use any sort of cable to connect both. My laptop got HDMI, USB-c charging port. \nI don’t use iMac as switching between windows and apple keyboard the buttons are different and get confusing, I want to use iMac as my second screen via cable. \nSo the question is can I and if so What cables do I need?\n\nA: \nI want to use iMac as my second screen via cable.  \n\nYou can’t.  The iMac doesn’t accept any video signal as input (the operating system doesn’t matter).  This model iMac does not support Target Display mode.\nThere are a couple potential products to turn your Mac into a secondary display for another Mac\n\n\n*\n\n*AirDisplay for Mac\n\n*Luna Display\nThe last product that supported connecting from a PC to a Mac as a secondary display was Air Display 2, but has since been discontinued.\n", "Q: How to change kernel security level? My Mac had a kernel security level of 0. Then, I changed the kernel security level to 1.\nHere's how I changed it to 1: sysctl kern.securelevel=1\nI'd like to change it back to 0 becuase my hosts file has a system immutable flag on it.\nThis is the code for that- sudo chflags schg /etc/hosts\nI'd like to take away the system immutable flag, and that starts with changing the secure level back to 0.\nI've tried to boot into single user mode. I shut down my computer and then held down cmd+S when I rebooted. It shows a black screen and white code scrolling across the screen and then went into the regular user selection field. Then, I put in my password to log in and it showed more white code scrolling across the screen and then it logged me in and everything appears normal.\nThis is related to this\nProtect hosts file\n\nA: If you have just run sysctl kern.securelevel=1 to change the securelevel, as you have indicated, then you just need to reboot your computer. This way of changing the securelevel is not persistent, so you will be back at securelevel 0 after rebooting, so that you can remove the system immutable flag from the file.\nIf you have changed for example /etc/sysctl.conf or used some method of ensuring that securelevel is set to 1 at every boot, you could edit that file and then reboot to get back to securelevel 0.\nIf you just want to temporarily get to securelevel=0 in order to remove the flag from the file, I would suggest booting into Recovery mode by holding down the Command and R keys while booting the Mac. While in Recovery mode, open Terminal and run chflags to remove the flag from the file. \n", "Q: What is could spawn tons of processes called AppleUserHIDDrivers over and over I see 18 instances of the process AppleUserHIDDrivers running on my MacOS, according to the activity monitor, belonging to the user _driverkit. The parent process is listed as launchd. What could be causing this?\nI'm running MacOS 10.15.4 I rebooted recently so these didn't accumulate over a long period of time. \nI believe HID is input devices. I do have a wired/wireless keyboard, wired/wireless mouse, external monitor that accepts USB uplink for input devices, and wireless headsets. I don't have 18 different input devices, though. \nWhat could spawn so many processes of the same name or how might I track it down better?\n\nA: HID stands for Human Interface Device, so you are correct, these are basically device drivers meant for any kind of input (or potentially also output) devices. \nHowever, it's not always so simple to associate what one would call such a device and what the computer considers to be one.\nFor example, the touchbar on a MacBook is listed separately from the keyboard in the system profiler. So, are keyboard and touchbar one input device or not (I just use this as an example, since both are \"default devices\" on a MacBook I am not sure whether they spawn HID driver processes, I suspect not).\nSo, it's possible that your headset or any other device spawn more than one HID process, as they consist of multiple \"technical\" devices. Some might even be spawned by built-in interfaces of the Mac, meaning even a brand-new machine with the minimum of peripherals has more such processes as the number of peripherals you actually see laying on your desk. There could also be a hierarchy causing such \"multiple\" spawns (one process handles the more generic features of a device, while another handles more specialized things, think audio output of a headset versus input buttons it has to start/stop Music playback). I'm not sure exactly how this works as I have not written any drivers myself, but from what I recall that's very much possible (I am a mac and iOS developer).\nI don't think there's an easy way to see which devices spawn which processes, but there's really no need to do that. The system loads them as needed (that's why you see launchd as their parent, that's your system's root process).\n18 is a totally okay number of processes. I have 16 atm, and not many devices connected either.\n\nA: Have this problem too since buying a used computer that had a file called ActivClientMac on it as a pkg file. I opened it to see what it was and while I was reading the User Agreement -I had not clicked install- my mac started to ramp up the fan to outrageous levels. I opened Activity Monitor to see what was going on and saw like 6 of those AppleUserHiDDrivers processes and a process called Data Detector Source Access (all one word). From what little I saw in the Agreement it seems to be a program that Government Employees have on their computers so Big Brother can monitor what they are doing.\nI'm going to have to reformat to get rid of it.\n\nA: I have to agree with Gero, I was suspicious too, but after a clean reinstall of my system I have 14 instances of this process, so I guess it's normal\n", "Q: Why my contacts have disappeared? How to get them back? The story started in November 2019, I bought a new IPhone in exchange of the earlier one. When I signed in with my Apple ID in new phone I didn’t get all my contacts, so it seemed to me that after the last backup I saved many more contacts and didn’t take their backup that’s why those new contacts weren’t appearing when I signed in and restored. \nHowever, I started saving new contacts as I was using my new phone, I saved many contacts (somehwhere around 45-50) but few days earlier I found that some of those (I don’t know if all) contacts have disappeared! It’s a little spooky but it’s a loss to me, I really need those contacts back.\nPlease suggest me something.\n\nA: I think you should sign into the site of iCloud to view all the contacts every time you saved contacts.\n", "Q: How to stream audio to multiple AirPlay devices I have a MacBook, two Airport Express devices, a SoundBar with AirPlay ability, and a bluetooth speaker.

Is there a keyboard shortcut for that?\nRight now I have to toggle the default on-screen keyboard and touch the microphone key, but I would rather do it with an actual physical keyboard shortcut.\n\nA: Apple added new shortcut in the recently release. Just press ctrl twice.\n\nA: I would also love to have this.\nHowever, as of right now there is no keyboard shortcut to directly start dictation on the iPad.\nCurrently, the most convenient way, as you said, is to press and hold the downward facing arrow on the bottom right until the virtual keyboard pops up and then press on the dictation button.\n", "Q: Can I answer an incoming phone call on my Apple Watch using Siri command?

I created another desktop using mission control plus icon at the top\nBut I am unable to open same application twice in different desktops. Is this not possible? \nSo, multiple desktops do not really behave like desktops but are actually just multiple screens that have a fancy name?\n\nA: Desktops in MacOS are not like running a different machine. So yes, you are right, you can think of them as multiple screens.\nThat said, you can have the same application on multiple screens. This requires the application to be able to have multiple parent windows. E.g. this works fine with a browser: Open a second window on desktop 1, enter mission control, and drag the second window to desktop 2. Now you can change desktops and have the same program running on both with different content. Clicking the dock icon will cycle through all open windows of the app, also if they are on different desktops.\nThis does not work for applications that can have only one parent window, like most email programs or professional editing tools.\n\nA: \nBut I am unable to open same application twice in different desktops. Is this not possible?\n\nNot all apps support running multiple instances, even if an additional instance can be started; however, if you want to attempt to have another instance of an already running app on a different Desktop then you can try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change to another Desktop\n\n*Open Terminal and use the following syntax:\nopen -na $appname\n\nWhere $appname is in the form of  e.g. Calculator or /Applications/Calculator.app, e.g.:\nopen -na Calculator\n\nOr:\nopen -na /Applications/Calculator.app\n\nFor apps that support running multiple instances, and an instance already running, another instance will run on the same or other Desktop using this method.\n\nA: By default, the Mac will not open a second instance of an App. If you ask it, by almost any normal method to 'open' again it will in fact bring the original open instance to the front rather than launch a second instance of itself.\nThis, under most circumstances is not an issue. if you need a new window, you can open that too, inside the same instance.\nThis is a different paradigm to the traditional MS Windows method, where a new window is often a brand new instance of the app itself. This has changed over the years for such as web browsers, where there is now one 'global' app, with a separate process for each tab. This is much more like the Mac has always done it.\nSo, back to Spaces [or Desktops: Apple seem to use the two interchangeably, which tends to get a bit confusing].\nOne App wants to be in one Space. This might be considered a failing, but that's how it is.\nIf you want to use a second Space, then after you open a second window, grab the title bar & use the key-command to change to the Space you want the window to go to. The window will follow you there.\nUnfortunately, it is unlikely to remember that if you Quit & relaunch the app - it will put both windows back on the same Space. \nHowever, for multiple apps, multiple Spaces is a great idea. Launch an app, move it to a Space, then right click it in the Dock > Options > This Desktop & it will henceforth always open in that Space.\n", "Q: Is the Macbook Pro limited to about 800Mbps of 802.11ac Wifi? I have a 2014 Macbook Pro and have a 2020 Macbook Pro from work.  If I Option Click  on the Wifi icon on the taskbar, they both showed 802.11ac and Tx of 780Mbps or so most of the time. One time it showed 1170Mbps but it only appeared for a second.\nAnd if I copy a file over to another computer on the wired LAN, it is about 70MB/s so it seems 780Mbps is about right.\nIs it true that the Macbook Pro's 802.11ac Wifi is limited to about 800Mbps? \nI guess 800Mbps is already quite close to the limit of Gigabit, so if at home we only have Gigabit Ethernet and switch, then 800Mbps is close to the highest speed already. It only would be if at home there is a 10Gbps Ethernet and switch that we only need to be concerned about higher speed.\n\nA: No, there isn't such a general 800 Mbps limitation.\nThe theoretical limits of the WiFi in those two MacBook Pros are 1300 Mbps. For example the 2014 MacBook Pro uses a BCM4360 WiFi chip from Broadcom that allows for speeds up to 1.3 Gb/s.\nIn practice, the actual speed is limited by factors such as distance from the access point, obstacles between laptop and access point, reflections of the signal, other interfering signals, the WiFi hardware and software support of your access point, traffic from other devices on your WiFi, etc.\n\nA: Actually, according to this page on Apple's Support, the newer Macbook Pros are limited to 866Mbps under ac, which the older Macbook Pros could connect up to 1.3Mbps.\nI can confirm this as I have both a 2017 Intel Macbook Pro, which always connects at 1300Mbps to my Netgear wifi router, while my 2021 M1 Pro only connects at 866Mbps.\nKind of puzzling, no?\n", "Q: How could macOS be POSIX compliant without vi? As macOS is POSIX compliant and Unix certified, why does vi redirects to vim?\nAs I understand, vim is not POSIX compliant.\nSo how did Apple obtained a Unix certification without having vi installed on their OS?\n\nA: It's actually optional.\nPer the The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, 2018 edition\n in the  Shells & Utilities Volume, the vi command states:\n\nThis utility shall be provided on systems that both support the User Portability Utilities option and define the POSIX2_CHAR_TERM symbol.

In fact I would most prefer to completely get rid of that embedded web browser entirely.\n\nThe reason I often paste stuff into Spotlight is that I use it like a second clipboard/storage space for text.\nIt's really convenient, a single keybind away. I often paste text there if I have to copy/paste something else intermittently, or need to be reminded of something a few moments later.\n\nA: With macOS 10.15 Catalina, as a workaround, you can first type a character and then paste the URL to fool Spotlight and prevent it from displaying a Quick Look preview. After editing the URL, you just need to pay attention not to copy that first character.\nWith macOS 11 Big Sur, none of that is necessary, as Spotlight no longer displays a preview:\n\n", "Q: Windows 10 on iMac mid-2011 High Sierra 10.13.6 Hi guys im trying to install windows 10 on my second internal hard drive ssd with a caddy.\nI have already done the usb boot but when i try to boot form the usb to install windows i receive a blue screen and then the imac power off.

If this is true, then one possible solution would be to put the Windows boot files in a very small partition on the first drive and there rest of Windows on the second drive. The method of booting is covered in the Microsoft document BIOS/MBR-based hard drive partitions. Below is an example.\n\nSince you are EFI booting from the flash drive and installing to BIOS boot, the Graphic User Interface will not allow you to install Windows. Therefore, I have chosen to use the Command Line Interface (CLI).\n\nBelow is an example of how to partition the drives. Basically, the difference between your question and below is the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*A ~100 MB FAT formatted partition labeled SYSTEM was added to the end of disk0.\n\n*disk0 is hybrid partitioned with partition 4 marked active.\n\n*There are no active partitions marked on disk1\n\n\n\nNext is a outline of the steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and mount latest Windows ISO from Microsoft. You should do this from macOS or OS X.\n\n*ExFAT format a flash drive.

I am unable to stay signed in on Chromium and Google Chrome. I sign in to website A, close all tabs, open website A again, and am still signed in. I quit Chromium or Google Chrome, open website A, and have to sign in again.\nI believe the problem is from Chromium because I can stay signed in on website A on other browsers. I checked this thread and confirm that at chrome://settings/content/cookies, I have disabled Clear cookies and site data when you quit Chrome. That issue seems to continue unsolved.\nI am using Chrome 81.0.4044.138 and Chromium 766739.\nHow can I stay signed in on a website with Chromium or Chrome?\nUpdate: I reinstalled Chromium and Google Chrome and have the same problem. I have since learned how to inspect cookies. On Facebook, for example, I have cookies that expire in 3 months:\n\nAfter I quit and restart Chromium, all cookies from facebook are gone:\n\nAnother problem that could be related is that each time I launch Chromium or Chrome, I get these two alerts, as if I were launching it for the first time:\n\n\nI believe this is a problem with the browser on this operating system because of these two alerts, and because Brave which is also based on Chromium does not give these problems.\nAnd for reference, my settings do not ask to clear cookies after restarting:\n\nSecond update: I updated Chromium (Version 86.0.4207.0 (Developer Build) (64-bit), 18 July 2020) and Google Chrome (Version 84.0.4147.105 (Official Build) (64-bit), 18 July 2020) and they both have the same problem. I verify that cookies are enabled, sign in to a website, quit the browser, go to the same website, and I am signed out, even though the website has cookies stored. Here is an example of cookies from StackOverflow saved on the browser, which looks the same for Chromium and Chrome:\n\nNote: Moved to SuperUser.\n\nA: Session Cookies vs. Persistent Cookies\nWhen creating a cookie, the code has the option of setting an expiration date & time.  If this is done, then that cookie is persisted to storage on the client's web browser (e.g. it writes it to a cookie file ... the specific name for that file will vary based on which web browser is being used.)\nIf a cookie is created without setting an expiration time, then that cookie is a \"session\" cookie.  It will not be stored in any file.  It will only be stored in the web browser's process memory and will be dropped when that process ends.\nSee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie\nNote there's some loose language in that Wikipedia article.  A single browser process (any browser... Chrome, Chromium, Safari, Firefox, etc.) can have multiple windows and multiple tabs per window.  Session cookies are only dropped when the browser process terminates ... not when the tab is closed.  Most browser don't lock cookies to a specific window or tab (though there have been exceptions.)  This means usually you can close a window or tab ... then re-open a new window or tab (as long as you didn't completely exit the browser) and return to a page without having to create a new session cookie.\nCaveats\nCookies dealing with user sessions usually wont have an expiration time (making them \"session\" cookies) but the server session itself may have other attributes which track the maximum length of the session.\nIt is somewhat common for hosted applications to save the session creation time as well as the session idle time ... and set maximum elapsed times for those.  This varies depending on the application -- it is not based on any standard.  But the net effect is that just because your browser still has a cookie, doesn't mean a server will honor the cookie.\n\nA: This issue seemed to be a bug on Chromium and Chrome. It is now fixed on Chrome Version 96.0.4664.110 (Official Build) (x86_64).\n", "Q: MacOS/Debian10 dual boot- how to delete unknown EFI partition?

If I go to the Google Calendar site, on the work account, in Chrome, I can go to ... / More tools / Create shortcut..., which will create a Google Calendar.app file.\nI can then add it to the dock - but, this goes to the wrong account :(\nIf I do Show Package Contents I can open the Info.plist file, and I see the url inside:\n    <key>CrAppModeShortcutURL</key>\n    <string>https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r</string>\n\nNow if I change the url to https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/1/r (which is the correct way to choose a specific Google account), I would expect it to work.  But in fact that doesn't change anything.\nBut actually, even if I put any random website here, it will still go to Google Calendar so basically I think this has no effect at all, which is surprising.\nIdeas?\n\nA: I also had this issue (trying to create an app shortcut to the second Google Calendar account) and solved it by creating a web app manifest before creating the app shortcut:\n\n*\n\n*Copy the JavaScript below\n\n*On the Google Calendar page, open the Chrome Devtools (right click anywhere on the page and select \"Inspect\")\n\n*Go to the Console tab and paste the copied JavaScript\n\n*Modify the URL if necessary to whatever URL you are trying to create an app for\n\n*Hit return to run the JavaScript\n\nconst startUrl = 'https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1/r';\ndocument.head\n  .querySelector(':first-child')\n  .insertAdjacentHTML(\n    'beforebegin',\n    `<link rel=\"manifest\" href='data:application/manifest+json,{\"start_url\":\"${startUrl}\"}' />`,\n  );\n\nThis will add a Web App Manifest for this website which will be used when creating the app.\nOnce you have done this, you can create the desktop app as normal:\n\n\n*Click on the three dots menu > More Tools > Create Shortcut\n\n*Check \"Open as window\" and select \"Create\"\n\nNow you should have a separate desktop app for your second calendar account!\nSource: https://github.com/karlhorky/pwa-tricks#change-starting-url-of-pwa-in-chrome\n\nAlternative: Editing an Existing Manifest\nIf you're trying to add a different PWA than Google Calendar where the page either specifies a manifest already or sets the Content Security Policy directive manifest-src, then the above solution may not work, potentially also returning an error such as:\nRefused to load manifest from 'data:application/manifest+json,...' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: \"manifest-src 'self'\".\n\nTo get around this, you can use Chrome Local Overrides to modify the start_url in the Web App Manifest:\n\n*\n\n*On the page of the application, open the Chrome DevTools (right click anywhere on the page and select \"Inspect\")\n\n*Locate and expand the <head> element and find the link element with rel=\"manifest\".

Here's a pic of what I'm talking about. \n\nI already know how to change the icons (by going to ~/Library/Safari/Touch Icons Cache/Images/ then replacing them with the same named .png) but some of them don't fit perfectly like the Facebook, Twitter, or \"Day 1 Advent of Code\" icon does. Btw, I'm not so bothered about the Reddit icon not fitting since it's not a square so please ignore that.\nIs there any way to solve this?\nI already tried resizing but it stayed the same. Let me be clear that I'm doing this because I don't want any plain letters in my Favorites (such as the \"U\" you'll see in the pic). I also checked the sizes of those icons who fit perfectly, and some were even smaller than the ones that do not occupy the entire square! \nThe sizes were all at least 144x144 px. From there I tried scaling up and it didn't work. The files were .png format. I also did not change the file names.\nI hope someone can help me customize this.\n\nA: If these are png files you can open them in Preview and adjust the size. Try to keep the proportions the same when you do this. In Preview there is a menu item Tools. Click on the and you'll see Change Size as an option. Click on that and it'll bring up the panel shown below.\n\nOn this panel, you can make your image any size you want. I think the icons are square so you can set them as 64x64 for example.\n", "Q: Cannot rename Pictures folder I have a cloud drive folder where I store my documents, pictures, etc. I want to change the documents, pictures, etc in home to point to my cloud drive folder.

I always get \"Operation not permitted\".\nI already moved the photo library bundle out to another location and set that as the system photos library in the Photos app.\n\nA: If you are not using iCloud sync - game on. Hard link / sym link - unix filesystem is a unix filesystem.\nIf you are using iCloud, it intercepts the filesystem IO at a low level and I try not to mess with the folders Apple makes In this general case since as soon as you update the OS or some software makes assumptions about what folders exist, then things break.\nI love storing my main photo library on secondary storage so you’re on the right track there.\nWhat’s stopping you from making a pictures folder in the Documents folder and just using that? If I understand you have a Pictures folder as well already in iCloud so just updating your finder sidebar and recent locations to be there would get all the apps to use the new cloud pictures. Maybe I’m just not seeing the case where something can’t find your new Pictures folder or what’s failing in your mv command or attempts to remove the user folders.\n", "Q: Why can't iPhone 5s upgrade to iOS 13 I have an iphone 5s and the current released version of iOS is 13.4.1, but I am only able to update to 12.4.6\nI have found compatibility lists online (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210327) and know that iPhone 5s is incompatible with iOS 13,  but I haven't found any explanations as to why. \nWould someone please explain if there is a technical reason that iPhone 5s cannot upgrade to iOS 13?\n\nA: This question verges on one of those \"opinion based\" questions that are officially off topic for AskDifferent.\nSo why did Apple decide to do this? There are likely a hundred reasons, many of them technical in nature that make supporting older hardware on a newer iOS release a non-starter for iOS 13. All of those reasons, coming from us, would be guesses at best. \nHeck I have an old iPad 3 that only goes up to 9.3.5. But it still does what I need it to do, what can you do?\nThe answer to that is nothing. Apple does what Apple does and you will never find out why. And the only technical reason that matters is \"because Apple decided.\"\n", "Q: Macbook 2011 Audio Input/Output Question I am preparing for a streamed music show via ZOOM on May 17.

I have the OUTPUT set to headphones, but I cannot hear the mic/guitar input signal through the headphones.   I tested an MP3 on my Macbook--and it sounded good through the headphone.   Is there a second setting to get the line-in signal to come out via the headphone out?  \n\nA: On my iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011), I have to open QuickTime Player and select File->New Auto Recording from the menu bar. This will produce the Auto Recording window shown below. \n\nYou should make sure you have Line In selected, as shown below.\n\nYou should also set the Output volume and the Line in Input volume in the Sound pane of System Preferences, as shown below.\n\nAlso, you should also set the Headphones Balance in the Sound pane of System Preferences, as shown below.\n\nYou should be able to hear the sound from the input jack.

I would like to identify the iOS version of my iPhone 6 from the Hello screen. Is there a way to tell the iOS version from the design of the Hello screen or from the MEID, IMEI or ICCID?\n\nA: Over the years since iOS was released, the opening Hello wallpaper which greets a user ready to set up the device has changed in several ways, most of them cosmetic. If each released major version had a subtle change to the Hello wallpaper, it would be easy to figure out which version of iOS was installed, but alas, the changes were few and far between.\nUsing Apple Configurator 2 you can see the installed iOS without going through any of the the setup steps:\n\n\nA: The checkra1n tool can identify the iOS version of the phone plugged into the USB port of the computer. It normally serves to jailbreak an iPhone in the Activation Lock for iPhones with iOS 12.3 through 13.4.1, but it can also display the version of iOS of the phone plugged in. It identified mine as 8.4.1. And this tool works both under Linux and macOS.\nEDIT:\nBy the way, by using the Activation Bypass DNS browsing method, you can also check the version. I'm not going into details here about it, here is a Youtube tutorial describing it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jft96zWmpso\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to one of many iCloud DNS bypass pages, fetch an IP address suitable for your region (for better performance, but any IP address will do)\n\n*Change your DNS setting to the IP address above.\n\n*Try rebooting the device and/or pressing \"next\" and \"back\" until iOS opens the web browser.\n\n*In the web browser, get to \"open URL\" page.\n\n*Find any UserAgent detector page online, then navigate to it on iDevice\n\n*Take note of the full user agent, as it will contain the iOS version.

Is there a way I can see which notes are taking up space and compress, archive or delete them?\nI think it’s also taking up the same amount of space on my Mac thanks to sync. Is there a  general way to use Notes that is more intelligent about the space being used?\n\nA: Most likely media files take up most of the space. It would be cool, if you could access the attached images directly in the file system to compress them. Alternatively an option to compress or archive directly in the Notes App would be great. Unfortunately neither is possible in the current version of Apple Notes. Of course you can delete your notes in the Notes App. To free up space, you need to delete them afterwards from the \"Notes App Trash\" which is called \"recently deleted\".\nBefore you delete, I would recommend to export your notes and switch to a note taking app that stores media files separately. Further you could avoid attaching large images to Notes in the future and use a separate App for scanning and archiving documents.\nPersonally I use Bear for my notes and Scanbot to scan and archive documents. Both Apps make it easier to compress and archive larger files, since you can access and manipulate media files directly.\nTo my knowledge there is no perfect solution to export all content from the Apple Notes App. Though the free App Exporter might be worth a try, since it does a good job converting text and image attachments from the Apple Notes App into Bear compatible markdown format. Beware that Scans and PDFs are not exported by this tool, which might be a dealbreaker.\n", "Q: kernal_task bringing MacBook Pro to a halt - fan problem? I have acquired a 2nd-hand mid-2015 MacBook Pro which I use connected to 2x cinema displays (the laptop itself has some screen damage).\nWhen connected up for the first time I noticed it was going insanely slow (16gb 2.8ghz w/ Radeon R9 2GB) even compared to my early-2013 model with half the spec.\nChecking Activity Monitor, I noticed kernal_task was using 400% of CPU (since then I have seen over 1000%). I looked up the cause and that it was overheating so opened it up and cleaned all dust out with blowers etc. to the best of my ability - no change.\nI noticed using the laptop without anything plugged in seemed to be okay, so I initially thought having 2x displayport connections to screens was doing it. Since then I've discovered (like right now) I can have 2 screens plugged in and it's okay - then sometimes I add USB devices and it's okay - but when the system really starts working and needs fans - that's when things go bad.\nSo I installed iStat Menus and have discovered that my right fan is not operating (constantly 0rpm even when the left is 6000+ rpm).\nSo I'm wondering if a) this is the root cause (and not a symptom of the cause) and b) what I can do to fix.\nEven though I cleaned it I did notice at the time its movement wasn't as smooth as the left - would cleaning help or would I need a replacement? \nI've replaced MacBook components before so am quite confident in doing this if needed, but the fan isn't too cheap / available here so I'd like to know if I should expect further issues or what.\nThanks!\nMike\n\nA: Do you also notice the MacBook getting much hotter on the right side than on the left under load? This would confirm that the right fan is not working, so it wouldn't be just the sensor.\nThe kernel_task issue is a recently discussed topic and it is often caused by high temperatures. Take a look at this active discussion.\nI would replace any broken fans and distribute external hardware that draws power and the power supply evenly between right and left ports.\n\nA: I opened up the laptop and carefully took out the right fan (following instructions from ifixit).\nI cleaned the fan as best I could with blower and tweezers and carefully reconnected everything.\nI switched the laptop on with the bottom casing still off and could see both fans working okay so switched off again and closed it up.\nAfter booting it up MacsFanControl said both were now running (whereas before right fan constantly at 0rpm) and after some tests it's clear the kernal_task issue is no more and I'm running both monitors, 6 USB devices and processing heavy software and not even at half load.\nGlad I tried the above before purchasing any parts or anything like that! It's 24 hours later now been throwing video rendering, gaming, three screens and more at it - and no problems whatsoever.\n", "Q: User Data Migration from HFS+ Disk Image I got the following\n\n\n*\n\n*source: the disk image of a iMac4,1 Intel32 from 2006 running the preinstalled 10.4.4\n\n*target: an iMac6,1 Intel32 from 2006 running the preinstalled 10.4.7\n\n\nThis use case isn't covered from the migration assistant, so: \nIs there any way to apply all user data and installed programs from source to the target Mac?\nMy current status is: \n\n\n*\n\n*I got both partitions on the target Mac's disk\n\n*I can access the source partition from MacOS, but not checkdisk. \n\n*I copied the user-data, but how do I register this new user with the system?\n\n*I copied the program I need, but now it is unregistered. Need the install CD. \n\n\nI am a total Mac noob but rather familiar with low level linux.\n\nA: This is a rather broad question, so the answer will be somewhat broad as well. \nAdding a new user\nYou can create a new user in System Preferences->Users & Groups. Once done you can then copy/move the copied user data into the newly created home directory and adjust ownership of files/directories.\nThere is a certain risk that some paths in configuration files etc will break, but this is hard to say from outside. You can reduce the risk by making sure the shortname of the newly created user is the same as it was on the old system.\nReinstalling an application\nThis heavily depends on the application in question. Some of them require just the .app directory to be copied, others have support files installed all over the system, and if they require registration it may again be somehow more complicated. To dig into this, please ask a new question and mention the name of the application.\nPS: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204320 implies that you should be able to select a mounted disk (partition) as a source for migration. But I don't have a way to verify that for 10.4.x.\n\nA: I finally solved the problem using the migration assistant. \nYou probably simply can attach the source disk to the target Mac using any USB external disk case. I did not try this because I don't have one at the moment, but 3 empty hot-plugging SATA bays.\nI prefer standard tools where I know what they do, so my solution heavily relies on gparted and dd. If you are not familiar with dd abort here. \nYou won't need neither the source nor the target system's passwords.\nWhy do we need this at all?

My MacBook was working perfectly until I tried to factory reset it through disk Utility. I’m not sure what I deleted but now when I turn it on a little folder pops up with a question mark and nothing else.

After the project I somehow deleted rEFInd and completely forgot about the rest.\nA few days ago I noticed that I had only 190GB of fully usable space and remembered that Linux was probably still there.

I have recently noticed that my 8-year-old MacBook is slow when loading webpages, and I started going through my files to get rid of old stuff. After a while, I came across a file called \"discord.dmg\". I think this was the file used to install Discord on my computer, but now I am wondering if I can delete the .dmg without getting rid of the application.\n\nA: Yes.\nYou can safely delete .dmg files.\nA disk image file (.dmg) is simply an easy, portable structure to transfer an app to you without falling afoul of any internet 'oddities' such as compression, splitting etc. So long as the .dmg arrives intact [& it is self-checking in this regard] then you can be sure it arrived \"as sent\" & can copy it to your Applications folder. Once you have done that, the .dmg itself is no longer required & can just be deleted.\nThe only two reasons to keep them would be for:\n\n*\n\n*archival purposes - just in case the original becomes unavailable for any reason & you might one day need to reinstall on a new Mac (if you have it backed up to Time Machine you can delete it sooner of course).\n\n*Incomplete installation - some people run apps out of a DMG and don’t install the app drag and drop. In this case, put the dmg in the trash but don’t empty it. Reboot and if you can run the app, it’s safe to empty the trash.\n\n\nA: Yes you should trash it if you have loaded the software. Its done its job and is only taking up disk space now.\n\nA: I would say that you can but you may find keeping some or all may save you a lot of aggro one day. Last year I had a problem with my - under guarantee- iMac. It had to be reset  to zero with a complete reinstall. Then my old MacBook Air had a major problem and I replaced it with a new MBA. In both cases I lost all my applications.  I was using an old version of Filemaker Pro. And FM now no longer allow downloads of the .dmg. Only backups. I was very glad that I kept the original .dmg (400mb). I had kept the dmgs of my important applications and reinstalling them was made much easier. Perhaps you have a dozen of dmgs. So store them on a USB KEY. or even a sd camera type card. 16gb or 32gb is plenty large enough.

One connected via HDMI through a Belkin Thunderbolt 2 dock, another directly via HDMI\n\n*at home: two identical 1680x1050 monitors. One connected via HDMI to DVI cable, another via mini-DisplayPort to DVI cable.\n\n*10.5.5 Beta (19F83c)\n\n\nMy work setup works fine.\nBut with my home setup, no matter which external monitor I connect first, as soon as I connect the second, I don't get a stable image. Instead, I mostly get three black screens, but every ~5 seconds, I briefly get either some or all of the displays briefly displaying an image; then it disappears again. Connect just one of the two, and it works fine.\nIt can't be bandwidth, because surely, 1680x1050 monitors take up less bandwidth than 1080p ones.

It has to convert the signal to HDMI to make it work.  \n\n\n*\n\n*At work, your dock is creating that HDMI signal so in effect, it's got an active adapter built in.\n\n*At home, you've got an \"HDMI to DVI\" cable meaning the pins just get re-orderd, but the signal doesn't get properly recreated.  \n\n\nTo get the best reliability, try to avoid HDMI altogether.  It's a \"consumer electronics\" standard and (IMO) not up to the bar with respect for computing. \nAs for connecting/converting signals, the order or reliability is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*DisplayPort → DisplayPort.  It's the native signal coming out of your Mac, so no conversions mean better reliability\n\n*DisplayPort → DVI.  DVI signaling is very compatible with DisplayPort and many times an active adapter isn't necessary, though I personally still use one because I don't like dealing with these issues once I have all my cabling in place.\n\n*DisplayPort → DVI. The signals are different, especially the clock signal, which is where a number of issues arise.  You can \"fix\" it with a reboot which allows the signals to \"sync\" up.  But disconnect/reconnect and a reboot is again necessary.\n\n*HDMI → DVI.  IMO, this should be avoided, but if you must convert these signals, an active adapter is really the only way to ensure reliable connections.\n\n\nNote:  These issues aren't as prevelant in Windows because the drivers for the adapters seem to have more tolerance for the signaling discrepancies.  macOS, has much less tolerance, thus the need for quality active adapters. \nIf you can swing it, I would get a dock similar to the one you have at work.  It will get you the best reliability and most flexibility. \n\nAdditional Reading\n\n\n*\n\n*Second monitor turns blue problem\n\n*External monitors show blank screen until restart\n\n*HDMI to DisplayPort Not Working\n\n*External Monitors Flicker when plugged into my Mac\n", "Q: Automatically convert cooking recipe units I am looking for a way to manipulate cooking recipe texts in such a way, that measurement in units foreign to me are converted to the ones I know.

This is where you get the deprecation warnings, which in themselves usually do not indicate a problem as such with the program - just that if this were a \"real\" program (and not an educational demo) you would want to use an alternative for sem_init().\nThe output from this program now differs quite a lot from the output of the same program run on Ubuntu or on repl.it, which is essentially just a kind of remote interface to a Ubuntu machine.\nI can confirm that I get the same output as you on the Mac, and that it differs quite a lot from the output on Ubuntu, as it does not adhere to the 11 element width of the outputted table. So this problem is not specific to your Mac.\nThe reason the program differs is that the implementation of the semaphore functions on macOS differs from the Ubuntu implementation. Normally this would indicate that there's a bug in your main.c program.\nThe bug is that the code does not check the return value of the sem_init() function in the main() function. If you did check the return value, you would see that it returns -1, which means that an error occured. It is pointless continuing after the error occurs, as this means that essentially every following operation on that semaphore will fail.\nThe reason the code fails is that you're trying to create an unnamed semaphore, which is not supported on macOS. You could fix the program on macOS by replacing the calls to sem_init() with calls to sem_open(). Note that the latter returns a pointer to the semaphore instead of having it as an output parameter.\n", "Q: Disk image creation from folder: error 28 - no space left on device I wanted to create a full copy of my MacBook Air in a disk image for archive.\nI can't save the disk from the booted system, so I restarted my Mac in Recovery mode (keys Command and R) on boot.\nFrom the recovery menu, I can launch Disk Utility, I select the 'Macintosh HD' drive, give the image a name, select the options \"not compressed\" and \"read only\".

When the original Apple Watch was released back in April 2015, one of the features that appeared to get lots of attention at the time was the ability for the Watch to unlock doors (https://9to5mac.com/2015/04/24/apple-watch-hotel-room-key/ is a good example of this). From a technical point-of-view, how is the Watch able to unlock doors in this way - is it purely based on the NFC chip inside the Watch, or does it rely on a companion iOS app running in the background on the paired iPhone?\n\nA: To put it simply, the Apple watch acts like a key fob.\nYou've probably seen these credit card \"keys\" or these fobs on a key ring that people put up to a sensor on or next to a door to grant them access.  (HID is the dominant market player - I just grabbed a couple of images from their site).\n\n\nThese devices just a have a very simple RFID transmitter in them that sends out a code, usually Wiegand, when put close enough to a reader.  The reader communicates back to a server with the code that was presented and send either a \"yes\" or \"no\" back to the reader which then operates a door lock.  This is basic access control.. Below is a (very) simple block diagram of how a typical system is laid out.  \nThe controller (blue box) handles the reading of the cards from the sensor (gold circles) and the (un)locking of the doors.  In fact, the controller has a large bit of memory stored so that permissions can be pushed to each door and the system will continue to function even if the server is down.\n\nThe Apple watch (and iPhone) has the ability to \"read and write tags\" with their NFC chip.  So, the NFC chip emulates a card or keyfob by transmitting the ID code.  The door reader still communicates back to a server to get authorization to grant/deny access.  So, just like the key fobs/cards don't need any special software or apps to function, neither does the Apple iPhone/Watch.\n\nA: The example you reference is actually not implemented using NFC at all.\nInstead the lock in the door is Bluetooth-enabled, and the app on the Apple Watch thus uses Bluetooth to communicate with the lock for unlocking. Today the SPG branded app has changed into a Marriot-Bonvoy branded app, but still works on the same principle. If you look at the FAQ for the app, you'll notice that it instructs the user to ensure that Bluetooth is On.\nThe process does seem to rely on a companion app on the iPhone for initial setup at least. From screenshots it seems the Apple Watch app can show the error message \"Phone unreachable\" during unlocking, which seem to indicate that the phone needs to be present.\n", "Q: Why does SystemUIServer try to talk to my router via UDP port 192?

Bootcamp itself would not let me do this, as it kept requiring me to have 40GB of storage, which I could not make (my mac is at full capacity, due to the 50GB empty windows partition). I do not understand why i need 40gb of space in order to free up space, but regardless, I ended up doing the (risky?) brute force removal of the partition through disk utility. (I erased the partition contents, and then converted it to an APFS container, since i thought that would let me merge them together, but it did not. Right now, im not really sure whats going on, as disk utility shows i have a \"APFS container\" with 50GB?\nHere is the print out when running diskutil list in terminal:\n/dev/disk0 (internal):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         200.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_APFS Container disk2         49.9 GB    disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +200.0 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            192.0 GB   disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 20.4 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                517.8 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      2.1 GB     disk1s4\n\n/dev/disk2 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +49.9 GB    disk2\n                                 Physical Store disk0s3\n\nHow can I merge disk0s3 with disk0s2 so I can have only 1 disk partition with the full 250GB storage capacity of my SSD? \n\nA: To convert a container to free space requires two commands. For example, disk0s3 is a APFS container. To convert to free space, you would need to enter the following commands.\nsudo diskutil apfs deleteContainer disk0s3\nsudo diskutil eraseVolume free none disk0s3\n\nFree space can be added to a container, if the free space reside immediately after the container. In your case, if you converted disk0s3 to free space, then you probably would be able add this free space to disk0s2, by entering the command given below.\nsudo diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0\n\n \n", "Q: Is there any way to preserve recent keyboard activity in case something accidentally gets deleted? I sometimes find things I have written in online forms get deleted without the chance for recovery. Is there any way, on an iPad for example, or Mac, that there could be a mechanism recording recent keyboard activity, so you could recover short-term lost written text?\n\nA: If you'd still like a key logger here are some choices. There are many keyloggers that do much more than logging the keystrokes. Most have many more features but these can be turned off if you're only interested in keylogging. Some highly rated yet easy to use keyloggers are Aobo Mac Keylogger,  Perfect Keylogger for Mac, and  Refog Keylogger for Mac. Be careful with these because they will log your passwords unless properly set up. Aobo Key Logger is a Mac-only app. These were obtained from this site that rates 5 keyloggers.\n\nA: Web pages are really bad for this. Only the most advanced sites like this one have undo and they have to do it in JavaScript and that can be buggy, heavy handed and leak private information in plain text.\nIt’s much better to do your authoring in an app that supports arbitrary undo on macOS and iOS. Since these OS support multitasking and split view windows and have superb copy/paste functionality in the native apps,  you can then copy your completed information and not need to change the web pages and forms you are using.\nEven better, you can use third party apps as needed if Apple’s editors aren’t the right tool for making form entry better than a web browser (which is still a very low bar TBH these days, very low)\n", "Q: Auto Swoosh to space on a per app basis There is a lot of questions and articles about the \"When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application\" under the mission control settings pane (also called \"Auto Swoosh\") such as here and here. \n\nMy issue with this setting is that some applications are used very differently from each other. For example when I want to switch to Spotify I probably also want to move to its space. However, some app (notably web browsers) I'd like the behaviour to be different. Specifically I usually have many safari windows across many spaces and when I switch to safari I probably would want to open a new window in my current space (so I don't want to be switched to a random space). \nThe best way I see to fix this is some ability to customise the Auto Swoosh setting on a per app basis. I've also been thinking of alternative solutions such as keeping the option off and using apple script or something to make a shortcut to switch to the space with the active window (like a one time manual invocation of Auto Swoosh), or a keeping it the option on and finding a different way of opening safari windows (such as typing in my search into spotlight and using cmd+B to google search it) however nothing works quite as I'd like it to.\nWhat are some options I could use to get to the behaviour I want? My main thing is being able to navigate my computer without using the mouse and without searching through spaces it find the app I want.\n\nA: I finally figured out a way to do it. I've kept the Auto Swoosh setting on but I've changed the way I open safari. I created a new application using automator with a single applescript block. It has the following code:\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    make new document\n    activate\nend tell\n\nThe order is important because its what prevents the spaces switching on activate as there is already a new window in the current space.\nTo open a new safari window in my current space I simply run this app.\n(In case it doesn't make any sense how this is fast, I use spotlight as an app switcher - simply type the first two letters of any app)\nEDIT:\nI've made a new version that also supports opening links. This is so that when you click a link in e.g. Mail it opens a new safari windows instead of randomly moving to a different space where safari is already open.\nSpecifically:\n\n*\n\n*Opening this app creates a new safari window without moving spaces\n\n*Clicking a link in any non-safari app will create a new window or a new tab\n\n*depending on if there is a window already in the space it will open a new tab in that window\n\nNote: the code is modified from here\non open location theURL\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell process \"Safari\"\n            try\n                set frontWinName to name of window 1\n            on error\n                my openNewWindow(theURL)\n                return\n            end try\n        end tell\n    end tell\n    \n    tell application \"Safari\"\n        try\n            tell (first window whose name is frontWinName and miniaturized is false)\n                set current tab to make new tab with properties {URL:theURL}\n                #activate\n            end tell\n        on error\n            my openNewWindow(theURL)\n        end try\n    end tell\nend open location\n\n\non openNewWindow(theURL)\n    tell application \"Safari\"\n        make new document with properties {URL:theURL}\n        #activate\n    end tell\nend openNewWindow\n\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    make new document\n    activate\nend tell\n\n\nSave this in AppleScript as application and set it as default browser using this or this.\nCopy the following into the app's info.plist to register it as allowing for link opening\n <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>\n <array>\n     <dict>\n         <key>CFBundleURLName</key>\n         <string>local file</string>\n         <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>\n         <array>\n             <string>file</string>\n         </array>\n     </dict>\n     <dict>\n         <key>CFBundleURLName</key>\n         <string>http URL</string>\n         <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>\n         <array>\n             <string>http</string>\n         </array>\n     </dict>\n     <dict>\n         <key>CFBundleURLName</key>\n         <string>Secure http URL</string>\n         <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>\n         <array>\n             <string>https</string>\n         </array>\n     </dict>\n </array>\n\n\nAccept app permissions (for some reason the app needs to be in the /Applications folder first). And voila! Now just change the app icon to the safari icon and retain your muscle memory to type the name of this app instead of \"safari\" when opening new browser windows. (I have put way too much effort into this but after months of using it, I'm so happy with the change)\n", "Q: How can I import Apple Card statements into Quicken? This seems to be the best place for people to find this…I will supply an answer and others can comment or give their own answers...\nUpdate: iOS now supports QFX export for Apple Card statements, replacing QIF export:\n\nI'll delete this answer shortly, as no longer needed.\nThe Apple Card—Apple’s Apple-Pay-linked “titanium” credit card—doesn’t support Quicken on Mac. How can I import Apple Card statements into Quicken?\nMore detail: The card account doesn't support direct bank connection Quicken. Apple Card statements come as PDF files, and you can export several additional formats, including OFX, QIF, and CSV.\n\nWhile QIF is an older Quicken format, it's not supported in Quicken Mac.\n\nAlthough OFX and CSV are listed, they fail to import the Apple Card OFX and CSV files.\n\nA: The CSV import fails because Quicken’s CSV import, “Mint.com (CSV)”, expects a particular format produced by the Mint financial application. We can solve this by reorganizing the CSV file data exported by the Wallet app.\nTo export an Apple Card statement as CSV, tap the Apple Wallet on you iPhone, tap the Apple Card, and tap Card Balance under the card image. Scroll and tap the statement you wish to export, and tap Export Transactions at the bottom of the page. Choose the first item, “Comma Separated Values (CSV)”. After a moment, you will see it, and you can save the file a number of ways using the icon in the upper right. You can save it as a file, you can send it as email, you can even Copy To Numbers. I’ll leave it up to you how you get the file to your Mac.\nOnce you have the CSV file, you need to edit it. You can do this manually in a spreadsheet like Numbers, or even in a text editor, though it’s more difficult to keep track of columns. Fortunately, the editing is simple enough that it can be automated, but I’ll show the steps required first:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rename the \"Transaction Date\" column to \"Date\"\n\n*Delete column 2 (was \"Clearing Date\")\n\n*Swap the \"Description\" and \"Merchant\" columns\n\n*Rename \"Description\" to \"Original Description\"\n\n*Rename \"Merchant\" to \"Description\"\n\n*Rename \"Amount (USD)\" to \"Amount\"\n\n*Rename \"Type\" to \"Transaction\"\n\n*Swap the \"Category\" and \"Amount\" columns\n\n*In the Transaction column, change all \"Payment\" to \"credit\", and \"Purchase\" to \"debit\"\n\n\nSave the file as CSV, and Use the import command in Quicken's File menu to import. This adds a manually managed account in Quicken, which can be renamed. When importing the next month, QUicken will make a new account. You can view that account, select all transactions, and drag them to the previously existing Apple Card account. You can delete the newly created account.\nThis can be done with this python script, which uses uses AppleScript to display a file dialog:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n# coding: UTF8\n\nimport csv\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\ndefault_path = os.path.expanduser('~')\n\ndef user_action(apath, cmd):\n    ascript = '''\n    -- apath - default path for dialogs to open too\n    -- cmd   - \"Select\", \"Save\"\n    on run argv\n        set userCanceled to false\n        if (count of argv) = 0 then\n            tell application \"System Events\" to display dialog \"argv is 0\" ¬\n                giving up after 10\n        else\n            set apath to POSIX file (item 1 of argv) as alias\n            set action to (item 2 of argv) as text\n        end if\n        try\n        if action contains \"Select\" then\n            set fpath to POSIX path of (choose file default location apath ¬\n                     without invisibles, multiple selections allowed and ¬\n                     showing package contents)\n            # return fpath as text\n        else if action contains \"Save\" then\n            set fpath to POSIX path of (choose file name default location apath)\n        end if\n        return fpath as text\n        on error number -128\n            set userCanceled to true\n        end try\n        if userCanceled then\n            return \"Cancel\"\n        else\n            return fpath\n        end if\n    end run\n    '''\n    try:\n        proc = subprocess.check_output(['osascript', '-e', ascript,\n                                       apath, cmd])\n        if 'Cancel' in proc.decode('utf-8'):  # User pressed Cancel button\n            sys.exit('User Canceled')\n        return proc.decode('utf-8')\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n            print('Python error: [%d]\\n%s\\n' % e.returncode, e.output)\n\n\ndef csvToMint(src, dest):\n    # coverts apple Pay csv format to Mint csv format, for Quicken\n    # if dest is empty, the src path is used, appending in \" (Mint)\"\n    with open(src, 'rb') as csvfile:\n        data = np.array(list(csv.reader(csvfile)))\n        data = data[:,[0,2,3,6,5,4]]\n        data[:,4] = np.core.defchararray.replace(data[:,4], 'Purchase', 'debit')\n        data[:,4] = np.core.defchararray.replace(data[:,4], 'Payment', 'credit')\n        data[0, :] = ['Date','Description','Original Description','Amount','Transaction','Category']\n\n    if dest == '':\n        dest = src\n        if dest[-4:] == '.csv':\n            dest = dest[0:-4]\n        dest = dest + ' (Mint).csv'\n    with open(dest, 'wb') as csvfile:\n        writer = csv.writer(csvfile, quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL)\n        writer.writerows(data.tolist())\n\ndef main():\n    src = user_action(default_path, \"Select\").strip()\n\n    # could let user choose destination file\n    #dest = user_action(default_path, \"Save\").strip()\n    dest = ''\n\n    csvToMint(src, dest)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    sys.exit(main())\n\nThe script supports separate open and save dialog, but I've disabled the save dialog, which causes the script to save with the same file name as the one you opened, but with \" (Mint)\" appended. To enable the save dialog instead, remove the \"#\" from \"#dest...\" line to uncomment, and remove or comment out the \"dest = ''\" line below it.\nA convenient way to use this script is to built it into an application created with Automator. I've done that for this application, cvsToMint. Download, double-click to extract from the zip archive, and launch the application.

(for SoX, FFmpeg, Ecasound, pyaudio etc.) When I try to record audio from the command line with programs such as SoX or FFmpeg it doesn't record anything and ends up with a flat-line recording. I am guessing this is due to privacy restrictions from macOS Mojave/Catalina. This is similar to the issue Audacity is having, in which the fix is opening it from the terminal to trigger a request for microphone permissions. \nThis answer suggests granting Terminal access to the microphone from System Preferences. However, it will only show up in the list if Terminal requests it. So is there a way to grant an application unrequested permissions?\nI also saw that Apple tech support have said non-GUI apps can't access the mic. Does this mean command line audio recording is completely broken? As it seemed to work perfectly on previous versions, could there be a fix for it like there is for Audacity?\n\nA: If Terminal isn't showing up in the System Preferences list for microphone permissions, open it by:\nopen /System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal\n\nThen run a program that uses the mic e.g.\nsox -d -d \n\n(Note, sox is not pre-installed.) This will let you hear your mic input.\nThat should trigger it to request. If that didn't work try running the command on a different command line e.g. iTerm2.

How can I trigger the creation of a .DS_Store file in a directory?\nI have a Macbook Pro and at some point I found that within a directory, the modified dates on some of first level subdirectories directories had changed. I looked into it and found that there were .DS_Store files in these directories or some subdirectories of them. There are some things i'm doing to try to get rid of them and restore the modified dates and then ensure it doesn't reoccur (I understand one can set finder to not produce these .DS_Store files). But, aside from that, i'm also trying to reproduce the problem and that's what i'm asking about here.\nI have tried creating a directory on my mac, and looking at it in finder, adding a file to it, and viewing it from a windows machine, and copying it from mac to windows, but it's not generating that .DS_Store file\nIt seems like it happens in sweeps.. a bunch with this date/time, a bunch with that  date/time.

And i'm trying to determine that well enough to reproduce it , to be able to trigger it myself.\nI tried copying a directory to a USB with USB formatted as exFAT. \nI'm guessing to do it is something to do with copying or viewing in finder or viewing the mac folder from a windows machine and copying things from there.\nI just can't seem to reproduce it myself.  My test directory is not getting a .DS_Store file in it.\nI'd be interested if anybody knows how to reliably reproduce the phenomena of .DS_Store file being generated in a directory or directories.\nAny ideas how I can do that?\n\nA: I would suggest creating a folder from the terminal.  Inside the folder create a temporary folder and a temporary file.  From the terminal, open the directory in finder, create a new folder, and rearrange all of the items.  After messing around, check the terminal to see if .DS_Store is created.\nHere are the steps:\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*mkdir Folder\n\n*cd Folder\n\n*mkdir MyFolder\n\n*touch MyFile.txt\n\n*open .\n\n*Menu > Sort By > None\n\n*Menu > File > New Folder > \"Temp\"\n\n*Move all the items around\n\n*In terminal, check to see if the .DS_Store has been created.\n\nP.S. I am running macOS 11.1\n\nA: This file persists Finder view and sort metadata so changing the folder view options or then moving an icon in the “desktop” view mode to a different spot should be sufficient to cause .DS_Store to be changed.\nThe filesystem may cache data, so the file write might not flush up until you eject the share in some cases. For network volumes or internal storage, it should be near instant to write the file unless an edge case exists where the system had the file open and then you delete it. That type of temporary file would be invisible until the delete was committed.\nUsing the Apple Menu to log out the current user should flush all writes to all reasonable locations of .DS_Store.

I live in a tropical region which sees very hot summers, which we are experiencing currently.

I am observing the same with my iPad mini 4 (relatively old) and a recently bought Apple Watch Series 5.\nIs there any technical reason and evidence or explanation thereof that would support this theory? Or could there be any other factors at play here?\nI have not observed such battery drain pattern just a month or so ago when it didn't used to be as hot. Also, I do not use any kind of air conditioning, so the room temperature is usually higher than normal further aiding with device heating.\n\nA: \nwe are experiencing hot summers....the battery on my Apple devices are draining way quicker than they use to from before.  Is there any technical reason and evidence or explanation thereof that would support this theory?\n\nYes.\nTemperature extremes (cold and hot) are bad for batteries in general, but they have different charging and discharging characteristics depending on temperature.  Batteries are much more \"sensitive\" to charging than they are discharging.\nBasically, the battery should be brought back to a \"normal\" temperature when charging to get the best performance.  \n\nSource:  Battery University - Charging at High and Low Temperatures\nA Li-ion battery has a charge temperature range from about 0°C to about 45°C.  In a tropical climate, freezing temperatures aren't really a problem, but past 45°, you can get reduced charge.\n\nBatteries operate over a wide temperature range, but this does not give permission to also charge them at these conditions. The charging process is more delicate than discharging and special care must be taken. Extreme cold and high heat reduce charge acceptance, so the battery must be brought to a moderate temperature before charging.\n\n", "Q: Multiple Macbook Pros with one monitor I have two MacBook Pros (one for work; one personal) that I want to connect to one monitor, one keyboard, and one mouse, and be able to switch between the two easily. Typically I'd opt to purchase a KVM switch, but it's been a while since I've needed that type of setup. My questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are KVM switches even needed anymore for MacBook Pros? Is there some sort of magic Wi-Fi / Bluetooth / Airplay device that can perform the same function?\n\n*If KVM switches (or something similar) are still used, what's a good make / model that works well with Macbooks?\n\n*Is a hardware solution even needed anymore? Is there software that can perform the same functions? (For example: Logitech Flow https://www.howtogeek.com/317962/how-to-use-logitech-flow-for-mice-and-keyboards-across-multiple-computers/)\nThank you!\n\nA: \nAre KVM switches even needed anymore for MacBook Pros?\n\nAs special as we'd like to believe MacBook Pro computers are, they're still computers with industry standard connectivity like USB, video, etc.  What works for a PC laptop or desktop will work equally as well with a MacBook Air/Pro laptop and Mac desktop.\nDo you need a KVM?  No.\nJust get a quality monitor with multiple inputs and a keyboard/mouse combo with multiple connections.\nYou've already mentioned Logitech Flow which allows you to use a single mouse/keyboard across two different computers simultaneously (i.e. cut/copy in Windows and paste in macOS).  \nThough convenient, it's not the exact product you would need - it's actually something simpler:  multi-device connectivity.  The same Logitech products like the MX Series keyboard and mouse have the ability to pair up to 3 different devices.  A simple press of a button will switch connectivity from one computer to the next.\n\nIs there some sort of magic Wi-Fi / Bluetooth / Airplay device that can perform the same function.\n\nIf there was, you'd still need to switch it.  WiFi, Bluetooth and AirPlay aren't magic and give you features where none exist.  They just replace wires as a matter of convenience.  You don't suddenly get KVM capability because you can stream video without cables.  \nAnd...if you're looking at software, that means at least one computer must be booted at all times as it has to be the host.  If you're going to spend the money on software, you might as well get a hardware solution that's platform agnostic and much more reliable (i.e. the next version of macOS breaks it and requires an upgrade)\n\nIs there software that can perform the same functions? \n\nI ran across FOSS solution for a software based KVM called Barrier. It works on macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, and Linux.  Binaries are available for both macOS and Windows.  It is also available via Homebew and available for FreeBSD as both a package and as a port per FreshPorts.  \nIt’s actually really cool software that allows you to arrange your setup graphically so that you can “move” your mouse across the screen “barrier” and onto the next computer (i.e your Windows machine is to the left of your Mac).  It also allows you to assign a keyboard shortcut to select a different computer to control.  \nIt’s only limitation is that it doesn’t switch the monitor as a traditional KVM would.  You still need to either have individual monitors for each computer (not a problem if using laptops) or a monitor with multiple inputs.  There’s an excellent YouTube video showing how it works with a Windows machine and a Raspberry Pi.\n\nA: \nJust get a quality monitor with multiple inputs and a keyboard/mouse combo with multiple connections.\n\nMany high end monitors include a KVM function.  Some people don't realize that their monitor includes this function.  If your monitor has USB-C and USB-B, or more than one of those two, then it almost certainly has a KVM function.\nThere are software solutions but they will still require fast enough computers and networks to be useful.  1080p/60Hz video will take more than 3 Gbps to send over a video cable or network.  Compression can help but this will add to the delay.  4K/30Hz will take twice that bandwidth.  If you connect the two computers directly with a Thunderbolt cable for the network then it's likely a software KVM will work nicely.\nIf you are looking for suggestions on a hardware KVM I can say I've used StarTech at a place I did some contract work and they perform nicely. https://www.startech.com/Server-Management/KVM-Switches/\nI'd say first check if the monitor you have now has a KVM function in it already, you may be surprised.  If you are looking for a new monitor then see if you can find one with a built-in KVM that fits your needs and budget.  Software KVMs can be cheap, or free since there's plenty of FOSS options.  Then if all that fails (for whatever reason) open up a web browser, and your wallet, and shop for a hardware KVM.  Remember that a big shortfall of software KVMs is, by my estimation, in the network so don't give up on them too quick if there's a cheap way to get a fast network connection between the computers.  With two MacBook Pros on the same desk it might only take an $8 USB-C cable to get a 10 Gbps network between the two.\n", "Q: Can I have launchctl output stdout/stderr from my application to the system-wide Unified Logging mechanism? I have set up a custom .plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents to run a process (offlineimap) on a periodic basis. I've specified both the StandardOutPath and StandardErrorPath keys to point to files in my home directory, which works. However, this doesn't really provide a complete logging solution from what I can see. The logs are not rotated, there are no timestamps (addressed by this question, although there was no clear answer), and the log is not integrated into any other logging on the system. I think I would prefer it if the logs went to Unified Logging.\nI'm used to systemd logging on Linux, which is a similar mechanism, and it would be great if there was a similar way I could redirect that output into the system-wide log, viewable with the log command. Is there any way to do that with a custom LaunchAgent?\nI should add that I'm using MacOS 10.14.5.\n\nA: You could use blowhole.\nblowhole is a command-line tool that takes a string as an argument and sends it to the unified logging system. It is supported from Sierra (10.12) up to Catalina (10.15).\nHow to use it\n(Tested on macOS Catalina 10.15.5)\nModify the ProgramArguments array in your .plist file like this:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n    <string>/bin/bash</string>\n    <string>-c</string>\n    <string>COMMAND OPTIONS 2> >(while read; do /path/to/blowhole -e \"$REPLY\"; done) | while read; do /path/to/blowhole -d \"$REPLY\"; done</string>\n\nwhere COMMAND OPTIONS is the command you want to execute, followed by any desired options.\nHere, I make use of bash's support for redirection (2>), process substitution (>()) and pipelines (|) to:\n\n\n*\n\n*sort out the command's standard error and standard output\n\n*process them separately inside two while loops. The first while loop runs blowhole -e to log standard error with an \"Error\" level:\n\n<timestamp> Error <info> blowhole: [co.eclecticlight.blowhole:general] Blowhole: STANDARD ERROR MESSAGES\n\nand the second one runs blowhole -d to log standard output with a \"Default\" level:\n\n<timestamp> Default <info> blowhole: [co.eclecticlight.blowhole:general] Blowhole: STANDARD OUTPUT MESSAGES\n\n(Since blowhole can't read from standard input, we need while loops to feed it a line of input at a time.)\nThe blowhole: [co.eclecticlight.blowhole:general] Blowhole: string is not configurable, but you can add a prefix of your choice to the logged messages. For example, since you mention offlineimap in your question:\n\n/path/to/blowhole -d \"offlineimap stdout: $REPLY\";\n\nand:\n\n/path/to/blowhole -e \"offlineimap stderr: $REPLY\";\n\nYou can read log entries with sudo log show | grep blowhole:general or sudo log show | grep offlineimap, if you added the customized prefix. To read log entries as they are generated, in a manner similar to tail -f, use show stream instead.\nAlternatively, you can wrap the command you want to execute in a shell script so that blowhole logs the command's standard output and error in a way similar to above. This is convenient if you want to run some code prior to executing the actual command:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Add the code you want to execute prior to the actual command here\nCOMMAND ARGUMENTS \\\n> >(\nwhile read; do \n    /path/to/blowhole -d \"$REPLY\"; \ndone) \\\n2> >(\nwhile read; do \n    /path/to/blowhole -e \"$REPLY\"; \ndone)\n\nYou can then configure the ProgramArguments array of your .plist file to run the script instead of your command:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n    <string>/bin/bash</string>\n    <string>/path/to/script.sh</string>\n</array>\n\nWhere to get it from\nYou can download blowhole from its project page or directly from here. The program is provided as a signed, hardened and notarized executable (as required by Catalina) and as an Installer package.\n", "Q: skip full-screen animation in Catalina and Big Sur In macOS 10.15.4+, when you make a window fullscreen, an animation about a second long zooms the window to the new size, and then the window rerenders (for example, a web browser or a Terminal).  Can this happen faster?\nSystem Preferences > Display > Accessibility > Reduce Motion just replaces the animation with a crossfade that is equally slow.\nVarious answers for older macOSes are also no faster.\n\nA: Sadly, as of Catalina, macOS cannot instantly maximize a window.\nI asked the IT departments of two organizations with which I am affiliated.  One has 500 power users, most of which use macOS.  The other has tens of thousands of users.  Neither department found a solution.  By now, any stronger proof might have to quote the macOS source code.\n", "Q: How do I set Command-Tab as the trigger for Witch? I'm using the app switcher, Witch, and I can't figure out how to set it to activate on Command-Tab. When I try to capture the keys, the OS switches apps on me.

It will give you options for setting the trigger to Command-Tab or Command-Shift-Tab.\n\n", "Q: How to omit file extension from zsh autocomplete? I'm new to zsh in Catalina.

(Or, if I have the source file in the same directory, it appends the . after the name) and I then have to delete .class (or hit the backspace once) before I can run the program.\nIs there a way to get zsh autocomplete to omit .class (and .) but only when the initial command is java?\nI'd prefer not to install something like Oh My Zsh which might alter my other zsh settings.\n\nA: It appears you are still using Zsh's legacy completion system. You can upgrade to \"new\" completion system (released back in the year 2000) by adding this to your .zshrc file:\nautoload -Uz compinit\ncompinit\n\nThen you'll see that Zsh's java completion will no longer add .class.\n", "Q: Does macOS provide a way to capture the output from a sound card? I do software FX on my guitar using my Mac and a USB interface, but the produced output sound goes back to the interface - I can listen to it but I can't record it on my Mac, only the input sound device pre-FX.\nI'm aware of \"virtual cables\" and \"virtual sound cards\" but I understand Windows for instance can allow direct capture of a sound-card output. \nIs this something available on macOS and if so, which versions - and any general information I should know?\n\nA: Apple's really crappy UI with useless documentation for MacOS's audio is the Audio Midi Setup.  Once you find and open it, select menu Window/Show Audio Devices. \nThat in conjunction with some virtual audio routing software like Soundflower may get you want you need. \n\n\nA: macOS doesn’t have anything built in, but you can capture the audio using a tool like ffmpeg.  See the following question/answer for full details on how to structure the command.\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal command to record audio through macbook microphone?\nWe can do the same with any audio device.  You would simply reference the ID of the sound device that you’re capturing from.  Using the linked answer as a reference, if your sound card device happened to have an id of “2” the command would be:\nffmpeg -f avfoundation -i \":2\" -t 10 audiocapture.mp3\n\nThat command would capture 10 seconds of audio from the device and save it to a file audiocapture.mp3.\n", "Q: Using Windows right-click keyboard button on macOS Is there any possible way to assign the Windows right-click keyboard button on macOS in order to use it as a shortcut?\n\nA: The Menu key is mapped to this key combination by default:\nfn+shift+F10.\nHowever, it is very Windows specific and seemingly only implemented in Microsoft applications on macOS. This will follow the cursor location in applications that support it, whereas right click implementations on Mac usually follow the mouse pointer.\n", "Q: iCloud photos on MacBook Ive just bought a MacBook, turned it on and every single photo I've took since 2011 has saved onto it and has taken up 70GB of memory, is there a way I can shift all these off my laptop and keep them in iCloud?  I don't need them on my laptop, but unsure if I delete these off my laptop will they take them off my iCloud aswell?\n\nA: Welcome to Ask Different!\nYou can keep your pictures and videos on iCloud but off your MacBook (MB) by changing the following settings (for macOS Catalina) as described. Before doing any of the below, however, I recommend that you take a backup of your MB including all of the downloaded photos using the Time Machine app.\nThe particular setting I would suggest would allow you to store and see only the recent pictures from iCloud on your MB. For that, open your Photos app and then go to Photos > Preferences menu and click on the iCloud tab. There tick off iCloud Photos option. Once you do that a My Photo Stream option should appear and I suggest you select that one. You can also select Shared Albums if you want to have any such albums on your MB. \nOnce the iCloud Photos option is deactivated in the Photos preferences, you can delete all of the photos you can reach through the Library > Photos option in the left sidebar of the Photos app to clean up for space on your MB. This will not delete them from iCloud as long as you have ticked off the iCloud Photos in the preferences of Photos app. \nYou can check if you have changed the settings correctly and things are working as they should by deleting only one or two photos initially on your MB and see if the photos are still preserved in iCloud after a little while by going to https://www.icloud.com/photos/\nIf you don't want any pictures downloaded to your MB at all, then do not enable either the My Photo Stream or Shared Albums options after disabling iCloud Photos within the Photos preferences. \nAnother way to disable downloading of any of your photos to your MB at all is to go to System Preferences > Internet Accounts and click on iCloud. Then on the right, a number of options should appear starting with iCloud Drive and below that Photos. Tick off Photos to prevent pictures to be downloaded to your MB. This should also change the preferences in the Photos app and prevent My Photo Stream from being maintained even if selected within the preferences of Photos.\n\nA: iCloud is a syncing system and not primarily a backup solution.  \nThat means everything you have in iCloud will be synced to every device signed-in with the same Apple ID.\nIf you want them saved as a backup somewhere (which is very good!) and you don't need them to be synced to every device, you need to use a different solution.  OneDrive, Dropbox, or Google Photos might meet your needs better than iCloud.\nAs a warning, if you continue to use iCloud for your photos and you delete a photo from your Mac or iOS device, this will delete the photo from iCloud, also.  \nThere's a way to recover deleted files and photos in iCloud from the web interface but that's only good for 30 days.  After 30 days, you can't recover what's deleted.\n", "Q: Need a script to connect to wifi based on user logged in I know nothing of macs, just windows, but I need a script to connect to a specific wifi ssid based on the currently logged in user. Is this possible? This is not a school project; I need this for my home which is currently running a UAP AP Pro which allows me to create multiple access points. I have created an additional AP which has assigned OpenDNS for increased security for my little ones.\n\nA: I'd say there's no need of complicated solutions.\nEvery users you created have a completely customizable environment. So, if you go to the System Preferences, Network, choose WiFi on the left (among different types of connections) and then click on the \"Advanced\" button.\nYou'll see a list of preferred networks. The items in this list may be simply dragged. The one on the top will be the chosen one, even if there are other wifi networks you previously connected to.\nObviously, you might also decide to delete the other networks, if you are sure you won't use them with that user.\n", "Q: iPhone Activation with NO SERVICE problem My iPhone7 started with \"NO SERVICE\" problem, I fix it by restore system but a week later the problems appears again.\nThen I do a fabric reset but now I can't activate my Iphone because it can't read data from SIM. \nMy SIM works good in an old model (iPhone4). When I try activation by iTunes, there is only a white screen with the word iPhone and no activation buttom or something. \nHow can I activate my phone to restore my old backup?\nPS. I can't take it to Apple because there is no Sellers on my country.\n\nA: It sounds like you have a physical problem with your iPhone; specifically the SIM card slot.  It could be a broken connection within the slot itself or a problem with  the circuitry.  The fact that the SIM works fine in another phone eliminates it as a potential problem\nIn order to activate your phone, you need to be connected to your carrier’s network.  This means you need a valid SIM.  Since your phone can’t read the SIM, it can’t connect.  Unfortunately, there’s no DIY fix for this.  Apple or an authorized service center will replace the phone’s logic board; there are some repair shops that might be able to do board level repair.\nUntil you get that fixed, you can’t activate it.\n", "Q: Safe and Sure Way to Install Sierra / Ongoing Regressions in OS X I am looking to install Sierra from scratch in a straightforward, foolproof manner on an Air currently on Catalina.  I've written 'straightforward, foolproof' because it appears that experienced persons have run into trouble doing this and I do not do sysadminey stuff to begin with.\nInstalling whatever O.S. you wanted used to be so easy when Macs came with DVD-Rs.\nSierra is still available as an upgrade on the App Store but as a direct install and 'visible' only to O.S.'s up to and including Sierra, so you can't directly revert to an earlier O.S.  I downloaded it (on Sierra itself).  The Installer says \"This copy . . . is damaged, and can't be used . . .\"  This may be because the download was interrupted and restarted.  Inside the app wrapper is 'InstallESD.dmg.'\nI could re-download and if it's not 'damaged,' I could copy it all over onto an external drive to install but that external drive would have to be a bootable drive as well -- more new things to learn and more pitfalls.  So is there no easier way?  An \"Installing Sierra for Dummies\" way?\n\nA: This is an overview. I'm going to assume you know your way around a Mac enough to fill in the blanks.\nYou should be able to download Sierra from the App store. (or here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208202) Note that if you are getting an error message about a damaged installer it may be that the installer is old and the certificate in it is expired. I have heard that setting the clock back a number of years will also fix this issue.\nThen using the command Apple recommends using (at least 8GB) flash drive create your bootable installer. \nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app\n\nOr you could use something like DiskmakerX you can create a bootable macOS Sierra install disk a different way. I use this method as I like me some GUI apps.\nOnce the bootable installer has been created on the flash drive and with the flash drive plugged into your Mac (and a backup of your Mac somewhere safe and disconnected). Boot the Mac holding the ⌥ Option key.\nWhen you get to the Startup Manager screen select the Sierra installer and let it boot. It may take a while. \nEventually you will be asked to select a language and be given a window with several options.\nInstead go to the Utilities menu > disk Utility and reformat the internal drive. This will, of course, remove everything from the drive so do be very sure about your backup.\nWhen that is done quit disk utility and select the option to install Mac OS Sierra on the drive you just formatted.\nNow, all of this assumes that macOS updates that you have previously installed have not updated the firmware on your Mac to the point that macOS Sierra won't work. That is possible but I don't know how likely it is. So proceed at your own risk, and have a macOS Catalina bootable installer standing by, just in case.\n", "Q: Low quality Apple Music app audio when doing conference calls I noticed a mono-like sound switch of current Music app song when starting a video call with Skype or Zoom. Can anyone here help me please?\n\nA: Are you using a Bluetooth headset? If so, try the following:\nGo to System Preferences → Sound → Input and select a device other than your bluetooth device, for example \"MacBook Air Microphone.\"\nNote that if you disconnect your bluetooth device, you might have to do this step over again. Inconvenient, I know.\nThis is because bluetooth does not have enough bandwidth for 3 audio channels at the same time, so it is either: (1) two speaker channels (stereo) or (2) one speaker channel (mono) and one microphone channel.\n", "Q: WiFi slow on MacBook Pro but not on other devices I am using a 15\" and a 13\" MacBook Pro with these profiles:\n\nThey're both connected to the same wifi network and they're at the same distance from the router.\nProblem is that the 15\" has a slower network. Sometimes youtube videos buffer. And generally feels less snappy. And as can be seen from the image above - and the speed tests on the right -, the network has these \"moments\" where it drops all of a sudden on the 15\" (you can see the drops in the top orange graph), whereas it remains very stable on the 13\".\nThe only major difference I was able to find between the two is that one uses DFS and the other doesn't (as pointed by the arrow).\nWould anybody know why I'm getting lower speeds on the 15\" and is there a way that I can also make it connect using DFS?\nNote that my iPhone also seems to work with stable speed tests and no \"drops\".\nEDIT What I've noticed is really a problem with these so called \"drops\". The network sort of stalls in the speed test run on the 15\". Here's a few randomized speed tests on the 15\":\n\n\nWhat I want to highlight here is not the speed but the \"flat lines\". When I see the speed-test run in real time I can really notice the number stalling - as it's waiting for something, and then all of a sudden dropping.\nOn other devices I really don't notice these kind of stalls; sure there are sometimes slower speeds but the graph is drawn fluidly and I don't notice so called \"flat lines\".\nHere's a few test runs from another well-functioning device (an iPhone) showing how \"the stalling\" never seems to occur (there are no flat lines followed by sudden drops):\n\n\nAs a last resort I also uninstalled a VPN but that didn't make a difference (the graph above was drawn after uninstalling the VPN software).\nEDIT 2 Note that also if I plug the 15\" to the router directly using ethernet, the \"stalling\" doesn't happen anymore and I get fluid speed tests.\nEDIT 3 The slow 15\" is a work laptop. I just realized there might be something installed that could cause this network stalling. I have uninstalled all software relating VPN or antivirus so I'm not sure what it could be. Thing is when I plug in ethernet I don't see these stalls so my feeling has more to do with something relating the wifi configuration. \n\nA: As with all mysteries such as these, it is best to narrow the tree of possibilities with a sort of binary search, as it were.\nHere are some starting point (and if you're lucky, ending point) tests to eliminate whole branches from the tree:\n\n\n*\n\n*Test a wired connection. You've already done this test ✅, so now we know:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's not a hardware problem with the possible exception of wifi-specific hardware, which is highly unlikely, especially given the symptoms you report.\n\n*It's not an OS problem, again with the possible exception of wifi-specific components, which I think is also unlikely.\n\n\n*Boot your Mac in safe mode.  Run the speed tests again. If the problem is gone, follow the steps under If the issue doesn't continue in safe mode at the provided link. If it is NOT gone, I would hold off on OS reinstall recommended by If the issue continues in safe mode fo now, trying the things below first.\n\n*Test it on an entirely different WiFi network. This might narrow it down to your router or how your Mac connects to that router via WiFi. If it turns out to be this, report back and we can go from here.\n\n*Test whether the flatlining is system wide when it occurs. First open a browser window open with a quickly loading web page already loaded. Run a speed test. When it flatlines and while it is flatlined, refresh the webpage. Does the webpage refresh stall too? It would be best if your speed test is not running in the same process as your web page test. If it is browser based, use a different speed test that isn't, or use different browsers (e.g. Safari and Firefox). Alternatively, use something other than a web page to see if the speedtest stall is a system-wide stall.\n\n*Test using a different browser, or a non-browser-based speed test.\nI can come up with more but let's start with these.\n", "Q: Mac mini running Catalina has no sound input I have my Blue Snowball plugged directly into a USB on the back of my Mac Mini.

I tried going into safe mode and creating another administrator account to find a sound input device, that didn't work. \n\nA: Apple Menu > System Preferences > Sound is the place to look for Input Sources:\nI've selected the Internal Microphone in the screenshot below for legibility. To use the Snowball mic (an amazing mic, BTW,) just select it. You can adjust the input volume, too.\n\n", "Q: How can I enable Safari 13.1 (Catalina) to render specific unicode characters? Since upgrading to macOS Catalina (10.15.4) I realized that Safari (13.1) can no longer render my lovely black truck(⛟). If I inspect this element in the developer console or copying the character into the url bar, everything is rendered perfectly fine, but in the web view, I only get the white square displayed. The same problem exists on 2 other Catalina machines, but not on the 10.14 and 10.13 Safaris.\nHow can I fix this on Catalina?\n\nA: Display of unicode characters in any app normally requires that a font with that character be installed on the machine.  Black Truck (U+26df) is not in any MacOS font for 10.13, 10.14, or 10.15 as far as I can tell, so you would need to install one of those mentioned on this page to see it.\nMS Word comes with one of them,  Segoe UI, so if that app is present and that font is available to other apps, then you should be able to see 26df (⛟).\n", "Q: Can not reduce size of an inserted image in Numbers I have done Insert |Image Gallery and cut and paste a single Image.

An image inserted via the Image Gallery into Numbers can not be edited as freely as other images. See this short video if you wish to learn more about how to better use Image Gallery (the video is for Image Gallery in Pages but its functionality is the same in Numbers.)\nIf you simply want to use a picture in a Numbers table resizing it freely, either copy and paste it from Finder or click on the Media on the toolbar at the top of Numbers and then click on Choose and then find and select the picture you wish to insert. \nYou can also drag and drop any compatible picture from Finder into a Numbers cell and Numbers will automatically resize the picture to fit the cell that it is dragged into.  \n", "Q: How do I play video through a projector without seeing the player buttons?

This seemed to only start happening recently. Should I reset the SMC? NVRAM?\nI did as @Allan suggested in comments and got this: \nTimestamp               Ty Process[PID:TID]\n2020-05-14 04:45:06.022 Df kernel[0:a9] (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: -104\n\nSo does this mean reset SMC? \nETA II : Reset SMC, problem seems to be solved, though my FileVault was disabled. \n\nA: This is usually a problem with the 'deep sleep' / hibernation mode macOS uses. Basically, when you close the lid your Mac goes in standby mode. After some time has passed, your Mac goes into hibernation mode to save more battery. As it seems, your Mac isn't properly able to either go into hibernation mode, or recover from hibernation mode, causing your OS to simply reboot.\nResetting SMC sometimes fixes the issue, but there's a lot unclear about these errors. Some users have stated that resetting SMC works, but only if FileVault is disabled. \n\nA: I had the same problem start after I updated to Catalina 10.15.4.  After some research I turned off POWER NAP from System Pref/Energy Saver and the problem went away.  \nMBP 16 2019\n", "Q: Cannot select \"Tile\" in Desktop system preference I just upgraded from macOS 10.14.6 to macOS 10.15.4\nPreviously I had both my desktops to display a random picture and to tile them. Now the option to tile them is greyed out :\n\nI have two Hp 27\" monitors and I am running them with a  MacBook Pro closed.\nI know there is something I am missing but can't figure it out.\n\nA: If your image is larger than the screen's resolution (either by height or width) the ability to tile doesn't work natively.\ntldr;\n\nYou can trick the option to show by adding an image smaller than your display to the\nfolder where you're selecting your wallpaper, and then selecting the tile\noption.\nI'd recommend having a separate folder full of optimised images fit for tiling (they could be copies)\n\nAs per above, if the image is larger than the resolution, then My macOS running 10.5.4 is has a display resolution of 2560 x 1600, however is scaled at 1440x900 (image below is a neofetch showing system info)\n\nFor an image to be tiled, it needs to be smaller than the width of the display. e.g. let's look at these images. Because the image width is more than my screen, the tile option isn't shown.\n\nHowever, as is the same with this small image with a width of 900px.\n\nWhen we reduce the width of the image, we're able to find the average percentage less than the width that would allow for an image to be tiled\n\nAt 886 width, we're able to finally select the tile function.\nThis means that the image width needs to be less than 98.5% of your monitor's width.\n\nYou can then select other images with the tiling option, however tiling would look rather odd as by the logic above, the tiling feature attempts to tile an image that's more than the width.\n\nIf you've made it this far, I'd suggest having a folder full of optimised images for what you're looking to do. You can resize them in preview as per image below\n\nHope this helps and explains things a bit!\n", "Q: Where did the free space for my deleted ExFAT partition go?

I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*PRAM Reset \n\n*Pressed Option Key at the Startup\n\n*Choose USB with Install High Sierra from the Drives\n\n*The Apple logo screen appears and stays endlessly\n\n\nI thought the USB might be corrupt so used different USB with light indicator and made bootable version of the High Sierra but same thing happens and after selecting install High Sierra the screen with Apple logo appears endlessly. The USB only lits up during the drive selection time and momentarily after Apple logo appears and then the light of the USB stays off indicating the iMac is not reading the USB. \nIs this related to bad motherboard? \n\nLog info as suggested by @At0mic & @Allan\n\n\nA: \nIs this related to bad motherboard?\n\nBasically, yes.  \nYou’ve got some good diagnostic information from attempting to boot from a USB installer.  If both your internal drive and the new USB installer have the exact same symptoms, the problem is with your computer itself.\nNow, this particular vintage iMac had a removable GPU “card” and chances are (based on my professional experience), this is likely the case; these would often fail.  To get further confirmation, having a look at the boot messages (Verbose Mode - hold Command V while booting) will help determine this.  Also, booting to the diagnostic disk that came with your Mac would allow you to run the graphics tests.\nCan you replace it? \nAbsolutely.  Unlike 2012 and newer iMac computers that have the display assembly glued in place, the 2009-2011 models used magnets and Torx screws to hold it in place.  User servicing is definitely doable here.  IFixit.com has excellent repair instructions. \nHowever, these are quite “expensive” and very rare as the 27” iMac was much more popular.  A cursory search on eBay found only one at over $100USD at the time of this writing. Is it worth fixing?  IMO, no.  It’s obsolete and no matter how much effort you put into it, it will only become more difficult to maintain.  However, if you’re into “retro computing,” this may be something you don’t want to give up on just yet.\nNow, it could still be your logic board, but I think it’s unlikely (the probability isn’t zero).  The nice thing with eBay now, is that you get 30 days to return even on used products.  So, your risk is very low if it turns out not to be the GPU.\n", "Q: Move data from parent account to child account My kid has used my Apple ID for his iPad for several years while I've been on Android phones.

In this case, they're tied to your Apple ID and there's no way to transfer this to a different Apple ID (your child's ID).\nSome apps allow family sharing and some don't.  Because you've enabled that feature, your child will be able to access for free any apps you've already purchased.  In-app purchases will not be accessible by your child.  \nThe activity/progress made on those apps under your ID will not be transferred to your child.  As of today, there's no way to transfer that that info.\nYour child's account will be setup as a brand new account.  See Apple's Family Sharing site for more info.\n", "Q: Bluetooth won't turn on my iPhone XR? Have a very odd bug--I can't turn Bluetooth on or off. This isn't at a device level--when click Bluetooth in Settings, there is just a spinning rule of death next to \"Bluetooth.\" In the Control Center, Bluetooth is off. If I tap it, it turns on, but the Settings screen is still spinning. I also cannot tap it off in Control Center once I tap it on.\nAnyone have a sense if this is a software or hardware issue? My Bluetooth was working an hour or so ago. I saw some articles suggesting this was a hardware issue but it seemed like those were mostly issues affecting iPhone 5Cs; I also saw some suggesting it was a software issue with an old iOS release from 2017, which is obviously not relevant.\nI've done all the obvious things, like restart the phone, soft reset, and even reset all my network settings.\nI had previously had AirPods Pro, an iPad, and Bose headphones in the saved pairings. All three were not connected. AirDrop also tells me that Bluetooth is off (even when it is \"on\" in Control Center).\n\nA: Just to close out the answer—as Allan noted in the comment, the Bluetooth radio itself was broken.\n", "Q: disable call from mac ring I don't know if this is the correct way to describe this or not... so here goes:\na) I have an iPHONE, a MAC + Tablet.  \nb) It is important that I keep my mac + tablet - attached with my apple id for other reasons.\nc) I also really like the fact I can answer my cellphone via my MAC or TABLET\nd) HOWEVER ... most often I leave my MAC + TABLET at home, and take my cellphone with me - when I am away from home - my MAC rings, and my TABLET rings - rather loudly according to \"she who must be obeyed\" \nWhy: Because my tablet & laptop are often plugged in charging.-\nThis is also bad - because when I get a \"SPAM CALL\" - my iPhone very nicely routes it to voice mail, but ... my Tablet and MAC ring at ear-breaking decible levels.\nAccording to \"she who must be obeyed\" violence upon my MAC + TABLET may occur if I cann't fix this.\ne) BUT - I do not want to LOGOUT of iCLOUD ... for other reasons above -- My question is this:  I need some way to mute the ringing, or control the volume when I am not home.  Or possibly turn this on - when I am actively using the computer, ie: with when locked - disable this.\n\nA: If you go to Settings on your phone and then go to Phone, there is an option that reads 'Calls on other devices'.

To send the output of one application to another, simply select Soundflower as the output device within the first application and Soundflower as the input device within the second application.\nIf an application does not allow you to specify audio devices, you can make Soundflower the default input or output device inside the Sound panel in the System Preferences, or with the Audio MIDI Setup utility application.\nThe 16-channel device is provided for more complex routing situations, and can be used with more than two applications simultaneously if the applications support audio routing to any channel, as Max/MSP does.\nNote that Soundflower's audio channels represent a global audio space. If more than one application is sending its output to the same channel, the audio will be mixed. If you want an application to send and receive audio through Soundflower, (for instance using Max/MSP to manipulate and return another application's audio) you must send and receive the audio on different audio channels or a feedback loop will be created.\nExample To send audio from iTunes to Max/MSP, open the System Preferences and select Soundflower (2ch) as the device for sound output inside the Sound panel. Then, inside** Max/MSP's DSP Status Window**, select Core Soundflower (2ch) as the input device. All output of iTunes should now be sent to Max/MSP's adc~ object.\nTroubleshooting\nIf you are hearing clicks or breakups, try increasing the buffer size of both applications (set within each application).\nRemoving Soundflower\nFrom an account with administrator privileges, double-click on the Uninstall Soundflower.scpt file. This will run an AppleScript, in which you will be asked for your password.\nHistory The Soundflower Change Log is maintained online at: https://github.com/RogueAmoeba/Soundflower-Original/wiki &/or https://github.com/RogueAmoeba/Soundflower-Original/wiki/Change-Log A more detailed history can be found at: https://github.com/RogueAmoeba/Soundflower-Original/commits/master\n\n Steps to Record Skype Calls (and any Mac audio) in QuickTime\n\n*\n\n*In Skype - start playing audio (test via Echo123)\n\n*In QuickTime - Type ⌃⌥⌘N for New Audio Recording - In the popup menu next to record button select Soundflower (2ch) as the input - Hit record!\n\nConfiguration\n\n*\n\n*Open Audio MIDI Setup\n\n*Hit the + button in the bottom left corner and select Create Multi Output Device\n\n*In the panel that appears on the right, select USB Audio Device AND Soundflower (2ch)\n\n*Then hit the ⚙️ dropdown and select use this device for sound output\n\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*mattingalls/Soundflower\n\n*Signed Version for macOS Mojave (10.15) and earlier\n\n*Soundflower | Rogue Amoeba\n\n*RogueAmoeba/Soundflower-Original\n\n*<file:///System/Library/Extensions/NVSMU.kext>\n\n*file:///Library/Extensions/Soundflower.kext/\n\n*Broadcast All Audio from Your Mac Computer\n\n*7 Useful OS X Shortcuts for Audio Engineers\n\nWorkflow(s)\nGoogle Hangouts Workflow & Configuration\n| Step | App                      | Input             | Output              | Ch Vol, etc.                                              |\n|:----:|:-------------------------|:------------------|:--------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|\n|  1.  | [**Sound**][1]           | [3x Mic Input][2] | [Record Mac][2]     | `⌥+fn+F10-12` opens [**Sound**][1]                        |\n|  2.  | [**LineIn**][3]          | [3x Mic Input][1] | Soundflower (2ch)   | Click **`Play Thru`**                                     |\n|  3.  | [**Google Hangouts**][4] | Soundflower (2ch) | [Default device][1] | 10                                                        |\n|  4.  | [**QuickTime**][5]       | Soundflower (2ch) | [Default device][1] | `⌘+I` (show inspector)<br />`⌃+⌥+⌘+N` New Audio Recording |\n|  5.  | [![][5i]][5]             |                   |                     |                                                           |\n\nSkype Workflow & Configuration\n| Step | App                | Input             | Output              | Ch Vol, etc.                                              |\n|:----:|:-------------------|:------------------|:--------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|\n|  1.  | [**Sound**][1]     | [3x Mic Input][2] | [Record Skype][2]   | `⌥+fn+F10-12` opens [**Sound**][1]                        |\n|  2.  | [**LineIn**][3]    | [3x Mic Input][1] | Soundflower (2ch)   | Click **`Play Thru`**                                     |\n|  3.  | [**Skype**][4]     | Soundflower (2ch) | [Default device][1] | 10                                                        |\n|  4.  | [**QuickTime**][5] | Soundflower (2ch) | [Default device][1] | `⌘+I` (show inspector)<br />`⌃+⌥+⌘+N` New Audio Recording |\n|  5.  | [![][5i]][5]       |                   |                     |                                                           |\n\nWorkflow & Configuration Template\n| Step | App                                     | Input             | Output              | Ch Vol, etc.          |\n|:----:|:----------------------------------------|:------------------|:--------------------|:----------------------|\n|  1.  | [**Sound**][1]                          | [3x Mic Input][2] | [Record Skype][2]   | n/a                   |\n|  2.  | [**LineIn**][3]                         | [3x Mic Input][1] | Soundflower (2ch)   | Click **`Play Thru`** |\n|  3.  | [**Skype**][4]/[\"audio app\"][8]         | Soundflower (2ch) | [Default device][1] | 10                    |\n|  4.  | [**QuickTime**][5]/[\"recording app\"][9] | Soundflower (2ch) | [Default device][1] | `⌘I` (show inspector) |\n|  5.  | Optional ⬎                              |                   |                     |                       |\n|  6.  | [Audio MIDI Setup][2]                   | `3x Mic Input`    | `Record Skype`      |                       |\n|  7.  | Other apps???⬎                          |                   |                     |                       |\n|  8.  | [Chrome (YouTube, etc.)][7]             |                   |                     |                       |\n\nTips:\n\n*\n\n*Micro Volume Adjustments\n\n*\n\n*↓ ⟶ ⇧+⌥+fn+F11\n\n*↑ ⟶ ⇧+⌥+fn+F12\n\n\n\n*Silent Volume Adjustments ⇧+fn+F11 or ⇧+fn+F11.

Why does macOS need to verify LibreOffice each time after a restart? I haven't updated the app in a while, and after the first verification it opens normally the next time. This is annoying and it takes a long time (about a minute). This should happen once, after installing (in the /Applications folder), not repeatedly. This doesn't happen for other apps. \n\nHow can I make macOS stop verifying LO after a restart?\nNB: Saw the same happening to Firefox, but not Thunderbird and Evernote.\n\nUpdate\nI installed this app several months ago. And I mention that this happens after a restart. So I don't open the app from a DMG, which would be unmounted after a restart anyways.\n\nA: *\n\n*https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=126409\nIt is a bug filed on LibreOffice's tracker. So they're aware of it. Please do not flood the tracker with \"me too\" comments. \n\nA: You still seem to start LibreOffice from the DMG file it was delivered in. Just drag the LibreOffice icon into your /Applications folder to install it properly. You can then eject and delete the DMG file.\n\nA: It appears you do not have the app installed on your computer, and hence the app config is missing, causing macOS to ask you to verify with every restart.\nYou should consider installing it as mentioned in @nohillside's answer, by dragging to copy the LibreOffice.app into the /Applications directory.\n\nAlternatively, you can also install the app using Homebrew. If you already use Homebrew, you can simply run the following command-line in Terminal.app to install the app:\nbrew cask install libreoffice\n\nIf you do not have Homebrew installed, you can follow the installation instructions on Homebrew website to install it before running the above command.\n", "Q: Is it possible to backup via Time Machine to SMB behind NAT on non-standard ports? I have a Linux server with an exposed SMB share Backup. It's physically connected to a LAN via a router. MacBook Pro physically connected to the same LAN via the same router can connect, set up Time Machine and make a backup to this SMB share using Linux server LAN IP (e. g. 192.168.X.X). \nThe router also has a WAN address. ISP blocks 139 and 445 incoming connections on the WAN side so I NATed WAN:tcp:446 to Linux server:tcp:445. \nAnother MacBook Pro on the internet wants to backup to the same share. It's able to connect to the share as smb://user@WANIP:446 via Finder, then a system prompt appears with user prepopulated, a field for password and a checkbox to save the password to Keychain. After providing the password it successfully connects to the Linux server and exposes Backup share and I can see, read, edit, delete, create, rename etc the files and directories on it via Finder. \nThen I go to Time Machine setup, Choose Disk, it successfully sees the connected share and allows to choose it, asks for user and password and both are prepopulated.

The photos weren't backed up to iCloud because there was no wifi during this trip. The screen is cracked and since it wasn't showing anything, I assumed the phone was dead beyond repair. It sat in a drawer for the last 5 years.\nHowever! I put a new battery in it and plugged it to my Mac. While the display did not turn on, I think the iPhone tried to boot, as the Finder in macOS showed the iPhone along with a message to reset it to factory settings (which I canceled out of).\nFrom this, I deducted that the logic board is still functional (unless it's just the boot rom?) and that (hopefully) the user data is still on it.\nAre there tools available that can help me retrieve photos that are on this iPhone?\n\nA: Yes there is an app called iExplorer that will allow you to transfer files and photos to your mac.

He is obsessed with us and harasses us continuously (video cameras looking in my house, calls cops on us when we haven't done anything, hates us because we had to sue him and won- etc).\n\nA: Whether a neighbor hacks into your network/computer is hard to say without detailled analysis. What you can do to reduce the risk is to \n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your WiFi is set to WPA2\n\n*Change the password on your WiFi to something which is not/not easy to guess\n\n*Change the passwords on all the accounts on your computer\n\n*Check whether there are accounts visible in System Preferences->Users & Groups which don't belong to you\n\n\nThis will not prevent a dedicated attacker from finding a way in of course, but might be enough to keep sneaky neighbors out.\n\nA: As the other answer says secure your network.\n\n\n*\n\n*if your router does not support wpa2 get a new one.\n\n*change the network password to something very secure\n\n*disable WPS/ssh/remote administration etc on the router\n\n*There is a lot more you could do here.\n\n\nIn addition to securing your network there are some things you can do to secure your mac itself.\n\n\n*\n\n*set a strong password for all your user accounts in preferences users and groups\n\n*remove unnecessary user accounts, disable the guest account if present\n\n*in the preferences->sharing, disable every type of sharing unless you really need it and have set a very strong password for it.\n\n*enable the firewall in preferences->security and privacy (if something stops working try to put an exception instead of disabling the firewall)\n\n*don't leave the computer unattended in an unsecured location and allow the attacker physical access\n\n*enable FileVault\n\n*always lock your computer when you step away and in case you forget, set the display to sleep more quickly and require a password when waking\n\n*don't plug in removable media you get from untrusted sources (for example a flash drive found on the porch or driveway)\n\n*ignore phishing emails and calls (if you are the target of a hacking attempt with a dedicated enough foe these can be very sophisticated)\n\n*delete unneeded sensitive files from your computer and encrypt those that you need to keep with an additional password.\n\n", "Q: Recover deleted word document Help I Had a word document which I'm unsure where it was stored.

These are not cheap but most offer a free trial. I used Stellar Mac Data Recovery software and it found my file. They have a free trial. \nAnother one with good reviews is EaseUs. It also has a free trial but recovery limited to 2 GB.  This link also lists several others.\nSome of them may find your file and then require you to buy the app in order to recover it.

I am using an iPad Air 2.\n\nA: Where are you swiping? \nControl Centre used to be a swipe up from the bottom, like on an iPhone, now it's a swipe down from top right, near the battery icon.\n\nA: How you access the Control Center on iPad depends on the version of iOS running on your device.\niPad Air 2 was originally released with iOS 8.1, and the current latest version of iOS available for the device is iPadOS 13.4.1 (iPadOS is a marketing rebranding of iOS running on iPad devices starting with iOS 13).\nCurrently, in theory you could be running any version of iOS from iOS 8.1 to iPadOS 13.4.1. To check the version of iOS installed on your iPad, go to Settings app → General → About and check for the item named Software Version to determine the current version of iOS running on your iPad Air 2.\nNow to access Control Center on an iPad with:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS 11 or earlier, swipe up from the bottom edge of the device screen.\n\n*iOS 12 or later, swipe down from the top-right corner of your screen.\nTo learn more, you can refer to the relevant Apple Support document, Access and customize Control Center on your iPad\nOnce you are able to gain access to the Control Center, you can easily determine if the orientation lock is enabled and toggle it.\n", "Q: Are there any standard apps in iOS that implement isIdleTimerDisabled=true? I'm wondering if any of the built-in applications in iOS have isIdleTimerDisabled set to true at any time?\nIf so, which app, and how do you get in the state to activate it?\nNote - if an app is in this state, it will have its display stay on, and never turn off while the app is active.\nWhy do I want to know this?\nI have a company iPhone that has the auto sleep option set so the phone's display locks after ~ 2 or 3 min, and it can't be set to \"Never\" sleep due to company policy lockdown.\nBut one day I noticed that if I had a certain app open, the display never went to sleep. I did some research, and it appears the app is using the  isIdleTimerDisabled feature to keep the display on permanently, if the app is in the foreground. \nThe benefit of this is that it allows me to receive 2FA notifications on my phone and approve them without leaving the app that's keeping the display awake.\nThis works for me, as I own this paid app, but I'd like to share this idea with others on my team, preferably using a built in app, so no one has to install anything.\nNote if none of the built in apps support this, are there well known, trusted, 3rd party apps that do this as well? YouTube or Netflix come to mind, but I'd like it to be something people wouldn't mind running on their phone at work and having their boss see it!\n\nA: Though I haven't found any built in apps that do this, I guess it can be done in Safari using a glitch/hack.\nThis demo page utilizes the hack, and clicking the button on the page keeps the page awake forever.\nhttps://richtr.github.io/NoSleep.js/example/\nIt is open source, and works on all iOs versions except for 13.4, but will probably be fixed for that too as well!\nNote that it may not work as well as a native app though, as I find that if my power is low and I'm not plugged in, this doesn't work (display turns off)\n\nA: The app Ultimate Guitar prevents the screen to dim/the phone to lock when viewing a tab. This helps reading the tab while playing the guitar.\nAs we discovered in the comments, the build-in Wallet App takes roughly two minutes when a card with a qr code is selected. This can be longer than the set sleep duration in preferences, but ultimately won't prevent the phone to sleep.\n", "Q: Tab key on ZSH terminal in Catalina keeps running \"bundle exec jekyll serve\" I don't have jekyll installed on my system\n➜  ~ Could not locate Gemfile or .bundle/ directory\n\n➜  ~ which jekyll\njekyll not found\n➜  ~ which ruby\n/usr/bin/ruby\n➜  ~ \n➜  ~ which bundle \nzsh: correct 'bundle' to '.bundle' [nyae]? n\n/usr/bin/bundle\n\nEvery time I press Tab key on the terminal to navigate the files and folders it returns\n\"Could not locate Gemfile or .bundle/ directory\".

I've been trying to install Windows 10 (1909 ISO) on my MacBook Air Mid 2013 with or without Bootcamp for over three weeks.\nI have freshly installed CatalinaOS 10.15.4 on my MacBook Air.\nUnder the listed Link (Windows 10 install without BootCampAssistant), I successfully come to point 14 and then the following screens come up and the system is restarted again and again.\nI also tried to install Windows 10 with the Boot Camp Assistant (BCA), but after the installation there was an error message after the first restart and the installation is canceled and the MacBookAir is restarted again and again.\nDoes anyone know the problem or can help me here? \nHow to install Windows 10 into a 2011 iMac without using the Boot Camp Assistant, an optical (DVD) drive or third party tools?\n\n\n\nA: Only three weeks?\nI've been trying for over three months, lol.  I have the 11 inch MacBook Air Mid 2013.  I have tried the original apple 256g m.2 drive that it came with, and have also tried a 128gb and a 512gb one as well.  I too have a freshly installed Catalina from the internet recovery install.\nI kept running into the same issues as you.  The current build WILL NOT install for me.  So I got my hands on a copy of the first few original builds of Windows 10 and found, to my surprise, that this worked seemingly flawlessly...  I think the first build was 1511, then 1609, then maybe 1709 (forgive me if I am misquoting the build numbers as its been a while)…  I found that if I updated them build by build from one build to the next, it continued to work until about the 3rd or 4th build...and then that's when it failed...  a few billion hours of trial and error later revealed that these same builds I could UPGRADE to would also allow me to do a fresh install using that same build...  (fwiw I always use BootCamp assistant in the hopes that it would be more compatible).\nI even tried doing windows updates to see if they could update to the newer builds, and they did seem to install but upon the last reboot, the Windows logon screen would lockup about 5 seconds after I arrived...  mouse and keyboard would stop moving, the on-screen time would seem to stand still forever...the only sign of life I had was my capslock button light would come on and off if I toggle it, but that's it.\nSo then I restarted a few times from that screen until windows brings me to the AUTOMATIC REPAIR screen at which point I can choose to go into safe mode, or even safe mode with networking...both work fine...which leads me to believe this HAS to be some kind of driver issue, but I can't figure out what it is.  I can't install the windows bootcamp software from safe mode as it says the windows installer is not running in safe mode...\nI even tried going into the device manager in safe mode and disabling anything I thought could help, such as display adapter, network adapter, sound adapters, etc...anything at all that I would imagine is using an apple driver from the bootcamp software...  but I guess I disabled too many things because now not only can I not get into normal mode, but I am having trouble getting into safe mode... so I got frustrated again and deleted my windows partition with bootcamp once again.\nI was HOPING that the new build of windows (which was supposed to come out last month and was/is going to be called build 2004 from what I have heard) would solve this... but since the problem seems to only occur on the NEWER builds, I am afraid it will not help.  I am at a loss and really fed up...to the point where I would seriously consider trading in this model for a 2014 or something with 8g of ram like mine...  I am limited on my budget here too, of course...  \nI am curious though, are you using the 11 inch or 13 inch MacBook air?  And since you posted this earlier today, have you seen anything useful on the internet?\nSorry I wasn't too much help, but maybe we can work together to solve this stupid issue.  It's so frustrating.\n", "Q: Your computer was restarted because of a problem macOS Catalina I just bought a new Macbook Pro 16\" 2019 with macOS 10.15.4. The computer keeps restarting when sleeping.

Thread 0x74.\n\nApple is the best resource to read these logs, so I would run the sysdiagnose command to capture the logs in detail and open a case with Apple Support. They have the source code to all of this and can make a call if they want to exchange your unit for a new one and analyze the hardware or if they have a couple quick items to test. The suggestion to reset the SMC one time is valid, since that is involved in the orchestration of sleep to wake.\nYou'll also want to do all the normal things for Kernel Panic:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log everything you have connected physically. \n\n*Log the times when this happens (get a sysdiagnose after each event and save them somewhere off the computer).\n\n*Start by removing all accessories once you know how often this happens - once a day, once a week, etc... Thunderbolt connected devices can cause this and Apple Support will be able to identify that if this gets escalated to engineering and you have a couple sysdiagnose to provide.\n\n\nThis is a beast of a Mac and well in the premium support window where Apple is highly motivated to learn all the ways this happens. Let us know what you do, whether it's a return / exchange or you sort it out. This answer is more triage / experience than a smoking gun since getting that will take some more detail than was provided.\n", "Q: Selecting multiple words via AppleScript in PowerPoint I'm trying to come up with an AppleScript that selects multiple adjacent words in a Microsoft PowerPoint slide. \nI figured out how to select single words, and how to select the entire range of a text shape, but I cannot figure out how to select a custom range of multiple adjacent words. \nApple Script for selecting a single word:\ntell application \"Microsoft PowerPoint\"\ntell active presentation\n    tell slide 1\n        repeat with j from 1 to count of shapes\n            set aShape to shape j\n            if (name of aShape is \"Title 1\") then\n                select word 2 of text range of text frame of aShape\n            end if\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nend tell\nend tell\n\nApple Script for selecting the complete text shape:\ntell application \"Microsoft PowerPoint\"\ntell active presentation\n    tell slide 1\n        repeat with j from 1 to count of shapes\n            set aShape to shape j\n            if (name of aShape is \"Title 1\") then\n                set myTextFrame to text frame of aShape\n                set myRange to text range of myTextFrame\n                select text range of myTextFrame\n            end if\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nend tell\nend tell\n\n\nA: You are very close.

What should I do?\n\nA: Quit Disk Utility. View the disk images in the Finder. Grab them with the cursor, and drag them to the Trash. Empty the Trash.\n", "Q: How to move all events on an \"On my iPhone\" calendar to an iCloud-synced calendar? I have been using Calendar on my iPhone for a good while now. Today, I decided to open the Calendar app on my Mac, but none of my events are there! Both computers are signed into the same iCloud account.\nAfter a bit of poking around on my phone, I have found that I've saved all my events to a calendar called \"Calendar\" in the Calendar app, which is in the \"On My iPhone\" section in the list of calendars, as opposed to the \"iCloud\" section of the list. This explains why it is not syncing: it is a local calendar.\nI'd like to have all the events on my Mac. Ideally there's a way to change an existing \"on my iPhone\" calendar to an \"iCloud\" calendar. If that isn't possible, then hopefully there's a way to copy all the events from one calendar to another. I think I'd be able to do this on my Mac, but since we're starting on the iPhone I'm not sure where this kind of option might be hidden.\nIf anyone can point me in the right direction, it would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: I think the easiest way is to use a third-party iOS/iPadOS file managing software such as iMazing. This would allow you to access your iPhone calendars and export them into formats such as .ics or .csv file. You can find more info here.   \n\nA: macOS (on your Mac) and iOS (on you iPhone) will synch calendar entries via iCloud; you don't need aftermarket software to accomplish this. Apple has a support page on this subject here.\nYou report having both devices logged into the same iCloud account. To synch via iCloud, however, also requires that you have selected (in both devices) the particular service you want to synch. For you, that service is Calendar. I suspect you may not have both devices correctly set.\nApple's page has this info at Step #3, which says:\n\nMake sure that you're signed in to iCloud with the same Apple ID on all your devices and check your settings.\nOn your iPhone, tap Settings > [your name] > iCloud. Check your Apple ID and make sure that you turn on what you want to update (Contacts, Calendars, or Reminders).\nOn your Mac, choose Apple menu  > System Preferences, click Apple ID, then click iCloud. If you’re using macOS Mojave or earlier, choose Apple menu > System Preferences, then click iCloud. Check your Apple ID and make sure that you select what you want to update (Contacts, Calendars, or Reminders).\n\n\"Selecting what you want to update\" means turning the software switch \"on\" so the switch shows green. The switch is the onscreen slider next to \"Calendar\" in the iCloud list of applications on both devices.\n", "Q: macOS Catalina - problems detecting external monitors I am using MacBook Pro 15-inch, 2018 with Catalina 10.15.4.\nI am trying to connect 2 external monitors (Samsung S24C450) via USB-C -> DVI converter. Both monitors are then connected via DVI interface.\nFrom both monitors only one is detected (one of two randomly) or none of them works. Disconnecting usb-c converter from laptop, DVI cable from converter or DVI cable from the screen - doesn't help. Disconnecting screens from power source, does not help either, nor restarting laptop.\nThis seems to work completely randomly. How do I force Mac to re-detect screens and use both of them, not only one?\n\nA: How exactly are you connecting your monitors to your MacBook Pro, and what else do you have connected to it?\nThe MacBookPro's with 4 Thunderbolt 3/USB-C connectors actually have  2 Thunderbolt 3/USB-C buses, each connected to 2 ports, one pair on the left side of the computer and one pair on the right side. The specs that say the Mac can support 2 or 4 monitors do not mention this, but the fact is the Mac can only support half that number on each side. 2 * 0.5 = 1 so the spec is not lying, but sometimes you have to pay attention to which side of the Mac things are plugged into. \nStill, the Mac should support 2 DVI-resolution DisplayPort over USB-C monitors per bus, which makes me wonder exactly how you are connecting the monitors.\nTry connecting one monitor on the right side of the computer and the other monitor on the left. Alternately, try connecting them both on the same side of the computer, connected directly to the computer and nothing else connected to that side. \n", "Q: Clean MacOS system (clean terminal) I hope everyone is safe.\nI tried to install an Apache version using brew yesterday on my MacOS Catalina, but there were conflicts with the Apache version of the system. After some tries, I deleted files I shouldn't have deleted. Is there a way to reset or reinstall or clean the Terminal, the binaries, and the system to have the factory settings? I already searched a lot but nothing worked for me.\nThanks by advance.\n\nA: The simplest \"whole system repair\" is to reboot to Recovery  Cmd ⌘   R  at boot, then just reinstall the entire OS from there.\nThis will repair the OS, but not remove any data or apps.\n", "Q: Catalina: Purpose of /System/Volumes/Data/Previous Content/? After the update from Mojave to Catalina I noticed that the used disk space has increased from about 1TB to almost 2TB. And there is hardly any free disk space left.\nA closer inspection of the file structure of the whole system shows that about half of the data is in the folder /System/Volumes/Data/Previous Content/Users/myusername. It seems to be a mirror of my user data that was created during the upgrade. This would explain the sudden doubling of the disk space used.\nI can't find any clear information about the purpose of the folder /System/Volumes/Data/Previous Content/Users/ neither here in the forum nor on the web. Is it possible that after upgrading and setting up all user data from the backup, the contents of the folder /System/Volumes/Data/Previous Content/Users/ can be deleted without problems? Since it does not seem to be necessary for the operation of Catalina?\n(Note: this question is not about the general purpose of the APFS partition /System/Volumes/Data/ of the new APFS)\n\nA: I think it was originally used for Archive and Install macOS installs.\nHowever, you haven't been able to select a Archive and Install for ages.\nTo me it looks like it is continuously updated in real-time which makes me think its actually linked to the original sources and the files you see are the actual files not copies. It also seems to be well hidden from the file system. Perhaps left there for comparability reasons.\nPerhaps look at your drive using DaisyDisk to find where the space is getting used. macOS allows purge-able space take up to 80% of the drive, however, it should automatically reclaim when the storage is required.\nhttps://daisydiskapp.com/manual/4/en/Topics/PurgeableSpace.html?source=PurgeableSpace&appEdition=Standard&appVersion=4.10&osVersion=10.15.5\n\nA: For me, I had to first turn off System Integrity Protection which comes with Catalina onwards by rebooting using Command+R and executing this command from the terminal:\n$ csrutil disable\n\nThen I rebooted and was able to delete this folder, which in my case was taking up to 700+ GB of disk space:\n/System/Volumes/Data/Previous Content\n\nAt this point, I was able to delete the above folder which you may need to execute as sudo (see https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250630022):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal, which is located in the Utilities folder inside the\nApplications folder.\n\n*Type rm -rf (don't press Enter / Return just yet)\n\n*Add a space, then drag the folder into the Terminal window. Hit Enter\n(Return).\n\n\nThen after of course I rebooted into the recovery screen using Command+R and re-enabled the system protection with the terminal:\n$ csrutil enable\n\nAt this point your purgeable content should increase so though you may not immediately see an increase in free disk space the OS will manage this for you if you continue to install more Apps or add files so that you will have the disk space you need until the drive is full.\n", "Q: Getting Bluetooth on Windows 10 Virtual Machine (Guest) - VirtualBox / Disabling Bluetooth Daemon How can I use bluetooth on my Windows 10 guest machine using my built-in macOS Bluetooth chip.\nWhen I try adding it as a USB device it come up with \nFailed to attach USB device Apple Inc.

Under the network tab, if I select an application, I can see all the external IP addresses that application is connected to.\nIs there something similar to this on MAC OS?\nIt could be a command line tool or an application.\n\nA: I recommend Wireshark, if you want detailed information about your network traffic. It works on Windows and MacOS and is even more detailed than Windows Resource Monitor.\nIf you just want to temporarily monitor the amount of network traffic for a process, the build in MacOS Activity Monitor is sufficient. Though, Activity Monitor does not show which IP each process is connected to and only logs when it is opened.\n", "Q: Macbook pro 13\" (2018) compatible external monitor Can someone recommend a 27\" or 24\" monitor that works with MacBook Pro 13\" (2018 with 4 thunderbolt ports) connected through HDMI or DisplayPort (not VGA). The budget is 250$ at most, purpose is mostly reading and coding and writing). I can only find USB-C like monitors which are too expensive.\nI had eye on Dell P2719H but there have been several reports that it does not detect signal from mac over HDMI which seems to be prevalent for Dell brand (apparently, Dell has issues with compliance to HDMI standards).\n\nA: I'm using the DELL U2414H since 2014 on different MBP and MBA, which is a 24\" predecessor of the one you mentioned. I haven't had any connection or display issues, and would recommend Dell displays especially for their great value.\nIt works best with this USB-C to DP cable, because the screen is set to auto sleep when the macbook is locked. Connecting it via HDMI also works, but when you lock the MacBook you have to turn off the Monitor or wait till the monitor puts itself to sleep. I used to use the Apple Multiport Adapter.\nI think you won't have connection problems when you use a high quality HDMI adapter or connect it via a USB-C to DP cable.\n", "Q: Error when \"unzipping\" powerpoint file using Archive Utility When using this trick to extract data from PPTX file I get an error\n\nUnable to expand archive \"test.pptx.zip\". It is in an unsupported format\n\nHow do I extract video from my PPTX then?\n\nA: The way to do it is to either try different unzip utility, such as 7zip, or use terminal: navigate to the folder with your \"test.pptx.zip\" and run these commands:\nmkdir test_dir\ncd test_dir\nunzip ../test.pptx.zip\n\nFirst line creates folder test_dir and then moves to that folder. Final command unzips your pptx file into test_dir folder\n", "Q: How do I add new pronunciations to apple dictation? I am a mathematician, and I am also dyslexic. I am trying to use the dictation software (not voice over) on my MacBook pro to write documents. I want to teach it certain pronunciations of words for example 'Lie' in 'Lie algebra' is not pronounced as it is written but differently. Given I have a speech impediment associated with my dyslexic I don't pronounce 'th' properly (and a bunch of other things), so every time I say 'theory' it writes 'fairy'.\nHere are some other examples that which it consistently gets wrong for me: \"is\" always writes \"it's\", \"the\" always writes \"there\". You can imagine how annoying this gets!\nI'm worried it is in a positive feedback loop. That every time I say \"the\" and it writes \"there\" it thinks that is more likely the correct thing to do, so does it more often etc. I don't know how/if I can formally correct it so that the algorithm knows it got it wrong.\nThus my question is: Is there a way to teach apples dictation software the correct pronunciation/my pronunciation of words? If not are there any alternatives I could use.\n(p.s. The original version of this question asked how to add new words as-well as  pronunciations  - a recent update seems to have sorted this)\n\nA: I don't think that there is anything that is adjustable for Apple's dictation.  I assume that you could use Text Replacements, but I don't think they are interactively called when dictating.\nYou might have more control if you used a third-party dictation software like Dragon Naturally Speaking.\n[Update]\nMy kids are dyslexic as well. I have used the text to speak to help them with their papers. I tell them to  just their their thoughts out onto paper before going back and fixing any little issues that have come up from the dictation. It's also a way for them to proofread their work to make sure they make sense.\n\nA: Mastering Dictation and Voice Control takes time. Some of the things to consider while dictating documents are:\n\n*\n\n*What Microphone Are You Using\n\n*Input Volume For Your Microphone\n\n*How Loud Are You Speaking - Test At Different Volumes\n\n*How Fast Are You Speaking? - Test Different Speaking Rates\n\n*How Far Away From The Microphone Are You? - Test Different Distances\n\n*Consider Using Headset Microphone (AirPods) Rather Than The Built-In\nMicrophone\n\n*Background Noise -TV, Radio, Other People\n\nAll of those items, in one way or another, will impact your dictation accuracy. In a lot of ways, it’s a game of finesse.\nWhile using Voice Control, simply speak the phrase ”Show Commands”. If you happen to be working in a document with text when you speak that phrase, the Voice Commands window should display all of the different text related Voice Commands for editing, navigating, and working with text.\nOne of my suggestions would be to take 20 or 30 minutes and play around with those Voice Commands in a text based document to get the hang of things. It won’t happen overnight but in time, you’ll start memorizing the voice commands and they will become second nature to you.\nYou are already starting to notice that Dictation can be stubborn at times. You mentioned…\n\nevery time I say 'theory' it writes 'fairy’\n\nThese are the steps I would take to fix that problem if I had that same issue.\nLet’s assume that no matter how many different ways I have tried to pronounce ‘theory’, Dictation just won’t get it right.  I decided to select the word ‘fairy’, after it was inserted by Dictation, and I spoke the phrase “Make This Speakable” at which point this following window opened…\n\nOnce you have your new command set up the way you want it, click save. Now anytime you are dictating and say “fairy”, the word “theory” will be inserted into your document. In the event you actually need to use the word “fairy” in a document, simply speak the phrase “literal fairy” and “fairy” will be inserted instead.\nMore to come… dinner break\n", "Q: FTDI USB to serial module doesn't work in Catalina I can see FTDI module in system report\n\nBut in arduino it doesn't show up\n\nI read that macOS comes with USBSerial.kext which can handle this but I don't see it working for me.\nI have tried installing FTDI driver and I can see .kext in /system/library/extensions and still doesn't work.\nResponse from FTDI regarding signed drivers\n\nApple are moving from what are called Kernel Extentions (.kexts) to what are called Driver Extensions (.dexts) for the implementation of drivers starting in macOS Catalina (10.15). Currently .kexts are still supported in macOS Catalina, however after the beta release they issued an update which stopped our driver from loading. This update required our driver (FTDIUSBSerialDriver.kext) to be re-signed and notarized, we completed this process with an updated Apple Developer ID (as they lapse every two years). Unfortunately when Apple issued our new Developer ID to re-sign and notarize the driver package they did so without the .kext support option enabled (as .kexts are being deprecated it is no longer automatically included). This is why there is a code signature issue with our driver, currently we are waiting on Apple issuing us with the correct Developer ID to be able to sign .kexts for macOS Catalina.\nAs such our current VCP driver available on the website has a signature issue and wont load. However if the device you are using implements a default FTDI VID/PID combination it should be picked up by the inbuilt AppleUSBFTDI.dext driver and present accordingly in the ‘/dev’ folder on your system in the following form:\n/dev/cu.usbserial-xxxxxxxx\n/dev/tty.usbserial-xxxxxxxx\n\nUPDATE: Module works with High sierra 10.13.6\n\nA: I followed the FTDI forum as well and got it to work with their 2.4.4 driver. Keep in mind that only the old 2.4.2 driver is available on their website as of now.\n", "Q: Still possible to override iSight webcam LED for iMac's and Macbook Pro's 2019 & 2020 & on? Although years later from the discovered exploitable vulnerability with iSight's LED, I am wondering if the issue has been fixed on 2019 and 2020 iMacs and Macbook Pros.  Can the iSight LED still be overridden through software, or is it actually hardwired this time so that the webcam cannot turn on unless the green LED turns on too?\n\nA: From a practical stance, macOS now blocks all apps from the camera in software so you can easily know all apps that could even request access to the microphone or camera. \nIn 2009 the firmware of the hardwired cameras was secured with encryption. I haven’t seen a credible report that this is broken, but depending on your threat model, you might close the lid if you can’t trust Apple to secure things. \n\n\n*\n\n*Does a newer MacBook's camera light need to be activated when the camera turns on?\nWhether you trust the LED auto-functions and cannot fail as an intrinsic part of the operation would need to trust someone who can forensically examine the hardware (likely destroying it to be certain how it works) and assuming all are made the same. \nI think you the camera is the least revealing or worrisome part, but it’s fine to question and learn even if it’s a small risk or no risk or you have easy mitigation options. \nAlso, all Mac cameras are hardwired. Just the security is far better hardware wire since 2009 and software side many steps better but with SIP and Catalina it’s really a hardened target for the software to get compromised. \n", "Q: How to view real time dynamically updated information on thermals and fan speed through the terminal? Is there any way to view real time fan speed and thermal information (CPU, GPU) through the terminal, such as by installing an application with homebrew (i.e. $ brew install ...) or python (i.e. $ pip install ...)?\nI found the threads below:\nUsing terminal to get current fan speed?\nCan I get the CPU temperature and fan speed from the command line in OS X?\nHowever the suggestions for terminal applications (such as istats) only give static information (not real time dynamically update information).\nThere is a github repo called lm-sensors which was designed for linux, however this repo has not been updated in a while and I was not able to install it properly after cloning the git. After I run the Make file, I get errors about header files being missing. \nI am running OS X 10.15.4 (Catalina).\n\nA: This Github repo has a program that can provide CPU temperature and fan speed on macOS and may be useful to you. If it only displays the readings one time, when you run it, just use the watch command to run it continously. (You can install watch using MacPorts or Homebrew). \n\nWith regards to CPU temperature and power monitoring:\nIf you have an intel based Apple Mac, the Intel Power Gadget is a very useful application in getting accurate cpu core, temperature and power usage information. \nWhile Intel Power Gadgets is a GUI based app it also includes a command line tool called PowerLog. (You can find PowerLog in Intel Power Gadget folder in Applications, after you install the Intel Power Gadget App).\nIntel PowerLog doesn't display the information in realtime in the terminal, when run, but produces a log file. But you can use the unix tail command to view the log while it is being generated and thus get the output in realtime. \nIf you know how to code, Intel also provides an Intel Power Gadget API that you can use to create your own cpu monitoring program.\n\nThe app Mac Fans Control provides realtime infromation on cpu fan speed and temperature:\n\nIf you are willing to pay for their software, contact them and ask if they can provide a command line version of the same app.\n", "Q: Why does photos show up as of part of the total storage that's taking up in my MacBook For some odd reason when I go and click on the Apple menu button then press about this mac, and select storage. When I look at what is taking up what amount of space in my mac. The one thing that does not show up on the categories is photos. I tried multiple things such as disabling iCloud photo library and signing out of iCloud. Even restarting the whole computer. I know I have pictures on my mac but they are simply not taking any space on my computer. Plz, help.\n\nA: This is simply because you have disabled iCloud Photos but the Photo Library is still on the Mac. The Photos library is located in /Users/Username/Pictures. Locate the one causing the issue and move it to trash then empty.\n", "Q: Which temperature sensor represents the CPU on my iMac? I'm on an iMac 2019 21.5 inches and I want to monitor my computer's temperature. I have the Macs fan control app, but I don't know which sensor to use. There are CPU cores 1 - 4 (sensor reading for each), CPU Proximity, and CPU PECI. I want to make sure my computer isn't heating up when running processor intensive applications. Which sensor should I rely on? \nThanks!\n\nA: They're all valid temperature. It's kind of like asking \"what temperature is my car's engine?\" There's the oil, water, pistons, camshaft, etc. that all have different temperates. Just monitoring the oil temp won't tell you that one of your pistons has overheated.\nBut here's the thing, your computer won't overheat. Most (if not all) modern CPUs \"thermal throttle\" when they reach a limit placed by the manufacturer or motherboard. In this case, that'd be around 100°C for most modern Intel CPUs. Thermal throttling means the CPU will run slower, therefore using less power, and thus not heating up as much. It's perfectly fine to run a CPU at it's max temp for years, it's designed to be used and won't \"overheat\". If you prefer, of course, you could turn the fan up higher (or reduce the workload), but that won't really have any effect on your CPU's lifespan. \nTo directly answer your question, I have Macs fan control, I usually just set it as the first core, but I've figured out that one of my cores is hotter than the rest, and I just use that. CPU PECI seems to be some sort of average or entire die temp, which should be fine in most cases. \n", "Q: How to list the Mail directory from the Terminal?

I tried turning off iCloud completely, and now get this — 170GB of undeletable \"Other\" photos stuck on my Mac:\n\nI expected more paying for a premium MacBook Pro and $120 a year of iCloud synching. Do I need to take extreme measures and reinstall macOS completely?\n\nA: There’s no reason to take extreme measures. \n\n\n*\n\n*When was the last backup?\n\n*Set up Time Machine if you have no backup, exclude system files, it only backs up live data and not snapshots. \n\n*Make a new user account and give it admin.\n\n*Turn off automatic log in and reboot.\n\n\nNow you can use the new admin account to examine if pruning local snapshots clears all the data. If not, delete your old user account (it’s safely backed up) and repeat cleaning snapshots. Only then would I consider an erase install if the storage allocation doesn’t make sense. \nTo get control of iCloud, you can restore your user account from backup while the internet is disabled, then disable cloud sync and learn why full automatic didn’t give you the results you expected. Nothing seems fundamentally wrong other than perhaps not considering APFS snapshots and needing to gather some info on how much photo data is actually reported as being in the cloud. \n\nA: The only thing that worked here was:\n\n*\n\n*turning off all synching and iCloud features,\n\n*deleting all Photos.app files from my hard drive,\n\n*and then starting with a fresh library.\n\n", "Q: How do I install python pyRAPL module on MacOS?

Basically, they were listed separately under the Windows drives with much smaller capacity listing (~2-3 GB))\nUsing a live linux stick, APFS drive is named sda2. here are some read outs:\n\n\n*\n\n*fdisk -l for the hard disk\nDisk /dev/sda: 465.9 GiB, 500277790720 bytes, 977105060 sectors\nDisk model: APPLE SSD SM0512\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\nDisklabel type: gpt\nDisk identifier: D0E4615B-509C-4516-9787-A0C116837A4E\n\nDevice         Start       End   Sectors   Size Type\n/dev/sda1         40    409639    409600   200M EFI System\n/dev/sda2     409640 756269007 755859368 360.4G EFI System\n/dev/sda4  829251584 879316991  50065408  23.9G Microsoft basic data\n/dev/sda5  879316992 977104895  97787904  46.6G Microsoft basic data\n\n\n*apfsutil /dev/sda2\nVolume 0 D5E22857-2B7D-3590-BF9E-87F9FBD6398C\n---------------------------------------------\nRole:               No specific role\nName:               Macintosh HD (Case-insensitive)\nCapacity Consumed:  372848881664 Bytes\nFileVault:          Yes\n\nVolume 1 8055269A-5FAC-40A6-ABE1-879B688E5755\n---------------------------------------------\nRole:               Preboot\nName:               Preboot (Case-insensitive)\nCapacity Consumed:  22323200 Bytes\nFileVault:          No\n\nVolume 2 856749D1-B62E-4B9B-AE80-E120E9F47C07\n---------------------------------------------\nRole:               Recovery\nName:               Recovery (Case-insensitive)\nCapacity Consumed:  514936832 Bytes\nFileVault:          No\n\nVolume 3 92FC4412-ABD5-4836-89BE-9301F19E5CEC\n---------------------------------------------\nRole:               VM\nName:               VM (Case-insensitive)\nCapacity Consumed:  2147594240 Bytes\nFileVault:          No\n\n\n*gparted screenshot (shows the empty  space as well)\n\nI tried adding the boot flag to sda2 to see if it would boot, but it didn't. (in other words, partition didn't have that flag at first. This screenshot was taken later) also, the Fat32 drive is only for shared files and nothing else. Also, I still have grub installed.\n\nA: You could try using gdisk to change the second partition to type AF0A. Note: klanomath's answer lacks the gpt remove ... command due to the nature of the question you have referenced. The type AF0A exists in versions 1.0.4 and 1.0.5 of gdisk. If you have an older version, then you have to enter the type given below.\n7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n\n \n", "Q: Delete partition and restore to mac without bootcamp I am looking to restore my hard drive to just mac fully. I installed windows using bootcamp but in trying to remove windows as it was faulty, I accidentally removed bootcamp assistant from my mac. \nI would like to delete disk0s3 and restore it to be part of my main Macintosh HD which contains my mac OS install. However, I am not sure how this is organised as not sure what container disk1 is. Any advice on how I can clean this up to just have 'Macintosh HD' using the full space available? The format of Macintosh HD is APFS (encrypted). Should I just erase disk0s3 and give it the same format? If so, what name should I give it? \n\nI plan to update my mac software and recover bootcamp assistant that way hopefully to reinstall windows.\nThanks in advance \n\nA: To convert a Microsoft partition to free space requires a single command. For example, disk0s3 is a Microsoft partition. To convert to free space, you would need to enter the following command.\nsudo diskutil eraseVolume free none disk0s3\n\nFree space can be added to a container, if the free space reside immediately after the container. In your case, if you converted disk0s3 to free space, then you probably would be able add this free space to disk0s2, by entering the command given below.\nsudo diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0\n\n \n", "Q: Mojave not recognizing my bootable USB stick, reverts back to Apple Partition after flashing So first of all I have little experience on this field, but I'm trying to install linux on my personal MacBook Pro from 2017.\nI followed a lot of tutorials for this but none of them worked. So I figured I'd ask here.\nI have a 64gb SanDisk Ultra Media USB stick lying around. I got it here: https://www.mediamarkt.nl/nl/product/_sandisk-ultra-usb-3-0-flashdrive-64-gb-1262970.html\nI grabbed a ubuntu copy from the official Ubuntu website, used Etcher to flash to ISO on the stick. Everything seemed fine, so I eject the stick, restart my macbook into startup manager, but the USB isn't there. Only my internal hard drive shows up. After reading a lot of forums I read that the USB stick should be erased first with GUID partition.\nSo, I did that, but after flashing I checked Disk Utility and saw that the partition was reverted back to the standard Apple-partition scheme.\nWhat am I doing wrong? All these miracle fixes I see on the internet never work for me, and people say it's so easy to install Linux on your Mac. Well, I also have a MacBook from work, with Catalina, and have the same problem with that one too!\nAny help would be appreciated\n\nA: In my case it seemed to be my USB-C to USB-A connector. I used a different one and it worked.\n", "Q: Battery status and replacement About a week ago my battery status (MacBook Pro mid 2017) claimed that the battery should be replaced after 250 cycles. Now, all of a sudden the battery status has returned to normal. \nioreg -l -w0 |grep Capacity\n\n| |           \"AppleRawCurrentCapacity\" = 4921\n| |           \"AppleRawMaxCapacity\" = 5067\n| |           \"MaxCapacity\" = 5067\n| |           \"CurrentCapacity\" = 4921\n| |           \"LegacyBatteryInfo\" = {\"Amperage\"=0,\"Flags\"=5,\"Capacity\"=5067,\"Current\"=4921,\"Voltage\"=12751,\"Cycle Count\"=251}\n| |           \"DesignCapacity\" = 6669\n| |           \"BatteryData\" = {\"StateOfCharge\"=98,\"PMUConfigured\"=0,\"Voltage\"=12751,\"QmaxCell1\"=5827,\"AdapterPower\"=1100127202,\"SystemPower\"=3035,\"ResScale\"=200,\"QmaxCell2\"=6504,\"QmaxCell0\"=6376,\"CycleCount\"=251,\"DesignCapacity\"=6669}\n\nIs it possible somehow to identify the problem with the battery that evoked the message to replace the battery?\n\nA: \nIs it possible somehow to identify the problem with the battery that evoked the message to replace the battery?\n\nFrom software?\nNot really.  Why?  What you see there is a point in time measurement of your battery.  You’d need a lab with a bunch of diagnostic equipment.\nThink of it like the gas gauge in your car.  It will only tell you at that moment how much fuel you have in your tank.  Now, if you were to place  a large brick inside your tank, the gauge will still be reporting accurately, but it would have no idea that the capacity would have changed by exactly the volume of the brick.  \nTo accurately identify the problem, you you'd need to measure a number of things like how much fuel you used to fill it, how much you consumed over a period of time etc. The number of fill ups you made would be irrelevant.\nSame for your battery.  It’s not a single battery cell that we fill with angry pixies each time we charge it.  It’s actually a series of cells and if, while discharging, it runs into a dead cell (meaning no charge in it), all of the point in time measurements will drastically change “setting off alarms” that you may have a bad battery.\nIt’s important to remember that when measuring voltage, it looks at the aggregate amount.  If it runs across a dead cell, the aggregate voltage will change, but so will the charge capacity and available current.  \nWhy does it do this?\nThere’s a good chance your battery is bad or in the process of going bad.  The number of cycles is only a “rule of thumb” and not a hard and fast number.  Batteries can die with 100 cycles and they can continue to function well after 1000 cycles.  The bottom line is that they are man-made devices and not without manufacturing defects.  While rare, they do happen.\nSo, can you determine the exact cause of a failing battery?  If you had the time and resources, yes.  However, the cost prohibitive nature of this means it’s much, much, more effective snd efficient to just replace it.\n\nA: If I understand correctly, your battery has a design capacity of 6669 mAh, but its actual capacity is 5067 mAh, or 76% of its design capacity. Given this, I wouldn't be surprised if macOS is indeed suggesting you replace the battery. While it's weird for that to happen to a battery less than 3 years old and with only 250 cycles through it, it's not impossible (I would speculate it's been subject to a lot of heat).\nI suggest that you run through at least two cycles of full charge/full discharge and see if you still get the same capacity. While discharging, try to avoid drawing too much power (say, running CPU intensive apps, charging devices from your USB ports, etc.) if possible. Also, no partial charges: after a full charge, disconnect the power adapter, and don't reconnect it again until the computer shuts down because the battery drained fully. Now reconnect the power adapter and don't disconnect it until 100% charged.\nIf the capacity is still below 80%, I'd recommend calling Apple to ask about a free battery replacement -- I recall they claim 1,000 cycles for their batteries before their capacity drops to 80%. If you have AppleCare, I wouldn't be surprised if they agree. However, if they don't, even after insisting and pointing out the 1,000 cycle/80% specification, then be prepared to pay out of pocket to replace it soon -- after the 80% mark, things go downhill fairly fast.\n", "Q: Edit pages document programmatically I want to know if it's possible to edit pages document using Python or other scripting tools.\nI need to modify the paragraph style of lines containing a date (e.g. 2020/05/02), which can be easily done by a script. But I don't know how to do it in Pages.\n\nA: There are two approaches you can take.\nOSA / AppleScript\nUse macOS's Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) to interact with the Pages application.\nApple continue to support AppleScript within Pages. You may find this approach is enough, with iWork Automation's helpful examples.\nDecompress, Edit, and Recompress\nAlternatively, you can directly edit the Pages document using a custom script.\nPages documents used to be a compressed archive of XML and supporting files. More recent iWork documents (Pages, Numbers and Keynote) use iwa named files which are also documented but compressed versions of the data.\nFrom the excellently documented open source project iWorkFileFormat comes this description:\n\nComponents are serialized into .iwa (iWork Archive) files, a custom format consisting of a Protobuf stream wrapped in a Snappy stream\n\nIf this sort of technical scripting is your idea, \nstart by unzipping the file, apply your script to the resulting data files, and recompress.\n", "Q: After removing bootcamp partition, booting the mac it says insert bootable media and press any key? so I had to remove my bootcamp partition because I was running low on osx Sierra space and I didn't need the Windows partition. But when I boot the mac I get an error \n\nNo bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key \n\nMy guess is that there is still some sort of a Windows boot manager on a partition, but I can't see it in Diskutil GUI or when pressing Alt on startup, or in the startup disk. Currently, the only wat to boot to macOS is to hold down Alt then -> Macintosh HD,\n\nA: Before selecting Macintosh HD in the Mac Startup Manager, hold down the control key. The straight arrow will become a circular arrow. This will make Sierra the default.\nYou can also make the Sierra the default, by selecting Macintosh HD from the Startup Disk pane of System Preferences.\n", "Q: How to solve \"An error occured while verifying firmware\" when updating to Mojave?

For a similar issue, someone seems to have suggest resetting PRAM/NVRAM. I've tried, but still getting these errors.\nThe macbook is a 2.4 GHz Intel Core i9 with 32GB memory.\nAny ideas how to fix this?\n\nA: It looks like this issue is affecting many others with new MacBooks and that Apple is aware of this issue as reported in this thread https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251274321.\nThere seem to be a few temporary fixes that can be tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable \"Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when display is\noff\" in Energy Saver settings\n\n*Disable \"Enable Power Nap while plugged into a power adapter\" in Energy Saver settings\n\n*Unplug the power adapter before sleeping computer \n\n*Shut down the computer instead of putting to sleep \n\n\nWell, the last one is a no-brainer. The other options are quite unpractical and not good enough for a computer of the value of a MacBook. Hopefully, Apple is working on a proper fix as they are aware of this bug.\nIn my case, disabling \"Enable Power Nap while plugged into a power adapter\" in Energy Saver settings seems to have done the trick.\n", "Q: How can I make Logitech a 4K PRO MAGNETIC WEBCAM work with a mid-2011 Mac mini? I have a Logitech 4K PRO MAGNETIC WEBCAM which I bought to use with a mid-2011 Mac mini, 2.3 GHz, running High Sierra. \nI've used an Apple Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter and a Thunderbolt cable to plug the webcam in, using the Thunderbolt 2 port of the Mac mini.\nIt is built to work with the Apple Pro Display XDR. I inferred from the technical specs that it should work with other hardware like 2018 MacBook Pro, just not at 4K so I hope my inference holds for my Mac. \nI hoped the adaptor would overcome the lack of a USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 port on my Mac mini; the Thunderbolt 3 to 2 adapter is fully bidirectional for many other devices. \nhttps://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/HMUC2Z/A/logitech-4k-pro-magnetic-webcam-for-pro-display-xdr\nhttps://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/4k-pro-magnetic-webcam\nHowever, it does not work. If I run an app like Photo Booth it says, 'There is no connected camera.' I do not see the webcam in system information. Apparently, it should appear under Privacy settings, if nowhere else.\nWhat can I do to make it work, please?\nI appreciate that I'm not running the latest OS, however, the latest one is Catalina, and presumably the webcam will work on the version after Catalina, as well as continuing to work on Catalina, so I don't see 'latest OS' as being restrictive.\n\nA: Thanks to Steve Chambers and bmike.\nLogitech did respond after a little while, and advised that I return the webcam. I returned it to the Apple shop, which reimbursed me.\n\nA: This web cam will not work on the Mid-2011 Mac mini because it does not meet the system requirements.\nPer the Technical Specifications, the Logitech 4K Pro Magnetic Webcam (for the XDR Display) requires a USB 3.1 Type C connection.\n\nImage of connection type included in case URL goes stale in the future\nPer the Technical Specifications of the Mac mini, it only has USB 2.0 ports.\nBottom Line\nThis webcam will work with any computer that supports a (minimum) USB 3.1 connection with a Type-C connector.  Note, it's not Thunderbolt, however a Thunderbolt 3 port will carry the USB 3.1 signal.  Thunderbolt 1 or 2 do not have support for USB.\nIt will also work with any computer with USB 3.1 including PCs.  Additionally, it will work with other displays as well, but it was designed for the XDR display.  Per the FAQ:\n\nThe webcam will work with other displays, however, you won’t be able to use the magnetic mount. It has been specifically designed for the Pro Display XDR. Additionally, the included cable’s length and connector angles have been optimized for this specific display.\n\n", "Q: If choosing to disable the Notification Center toggle for an iOS app, does this mean that notifications can't be located after they've disappeared? When modifying notification settings for individual apps from within Settings app on an iOS device (by navigating to Settings app → Notifications → App Name), I've noticed that there's a toggle for the Notification Center.\nIf this isn't checked, does this mean that notifications for the app in question simply won't be delivered to the Notification Center at all, and impossible to locate if not initially interacted with?\n\nA: What that switch does is reject the push from the server. One message might still get delivered if the server side doesn’t receive the message but the device send back a “we’re not subscribed anymore” message until you re-enable notifications.\nNotifications can come from apps on the device or from the Apple Push Notification Service - so either way - those messages literally are stopped and discarded as opposed for them all to keep piling up and not being visible.\n", "Q: Can I remove the content from Time machine? Is it just delete all the folders in the Time Machine drive ?\nI am about to leave my current company and want to follow the policy to wipe everything related to IP (e.g., code)\nTime Machine was enabled in the past for faster backup locally than some cloud providers.\n\nA: In the case where you can copy off any non-work related items, it’s thousands to millions of times faster to copy off any data that should remain and then partition and erase the drive entirely. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208496 - How to erase a disk for Mac - \nUse Disk Utility to erase (format) a hard disk, SSD, flash drive, or other storage device.\n\n\n\nLots of technical info below is why an erase is easier and options if you have to surgically remove some data and it’s worth the pain to learn and perform the surgery. It is possible to do. \nAutomating deleting all instances of one file is a very difficult process as would even be copying off all versions of one file if it changes often. Let alone finding files that were backed up and now deleted. \nDeleting a single backup instance is reasonably easy to automate but takes a long time since each file is hard linked to other identical copies and chaining these files together and keeping track of how many copies of each file  was backed up has lots of overhead and save operations to the filesystem. \n", "Q: Restore backup from iPhone SE (iOS 13.4.1) to iPhone 6 (iOS 12.4.6) Got two iPhones:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone SE on 13.4.1\n\n*iPhone 6 on 12.4.6\n\n\nAs far as I understand, both iOS versions are the latest ones for the respective model.\nWhen trying to restore a backup from SE to 6, iTunes complains that the backup is not compatible and I should update the iPhone.\nKind of makes sense. To be honest, until yesterday I thought that iPhone 6 is newer than SE, but it seems that I was wrong there.\nIs there a way to get \"stuff\" from SE to 6? In an ideal world, of course that would mean all apps and all data. But probably there is no sensible way to downgrade everything. \nWould icould be able to serve as a \"logical backup\" for photos etc.?\n\nA: You can’t get Apple to restore a newer OS to an older one. This is by design. Short of a jailbreak you will need a device that runs iOS 13.4.1 or newer to restore the data and then examine / export / sync or write by hand or manually any data for RE-entry in the 12.4.6 device. \niCloud sync is a very good way to go if you can borrow or rent a device assuming you don’t have both in hand and working. \n", "Q: How can you stop sites from sending unwanted or 'enforced' downloads in Safari? I'm not the only one who has been plagued lately with seemingly well-meaning sites suddenly warning me that some piece of software on my Mac is out-of-date and that I need to update 'whatever' (often Flash).  Then, my browser just goes ahead and accepts their download (probably malware) onto my computer and I can't stop it.  How can we stop Safari from downloading files without asking first?  It seems that these infected sites 'push' the downloads on you, and Safari does nothing to stop it.  BTW I'm using Sierra (10.12.6) and Safari 12.1.2.  I hear that this happens with other browsers as well.  Open \"Safe Files\" after downloading checkbox is not checked. Any ideas?\n\nA: The real solution is upgrading to Safari 13, but there does exist a solution on Safari 12 and earlier.\nOpen Safari Preferences, choose the General tab, and for the download location choose ‘ask for each download’.\nWith this option select, Safari will prompt for a file name and a location to save the file, which you can cancel so the download doesn't take place.\n\nA: Update Safari to its latest version. Apple updated it in macOS Catalina so that you need to allow downloads. Also, you can check in Safari Preferences in the website section. Note that auto run is deprecated so don’t worry if the download happens. Just navigate to it and delete it.\n\nA: By researching over a half dozen sites regarding browsers, I've been able to determine that the only browsers one should use for an older OS such as Sierra are ones that are still updated regularly, otherwise they are not secure.  With Firefox, and perhaps others, you get a window naming the item and requiring the user's approval before downloading, which would solve my immediate complaint.\nI was not able to find the offending website again, so I don't yet know for a fact that this can stop a deliberate attempt to dump the file on the user.\nHowever, Todd's answer was fundamentally correct; if one wanted to rely on Safari as their primary browser, then that would be one of many reasons why they would be best advised to upgrade to Catalina.  I would add that if, for whatever reason, one were not yet able or prepared to upgrade the OS, then a different browser should be used.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2015 really slow since macOS Sierra / High Sierra [With maybe a start for an answer] Since macOS Sierra or High Sierra, macOS has become really, really slow.\nReinstalling El Capitan (even today) solves the issue.\nGNU/Linux and Windows are also much faster, more like El Capitan was.\nBy slower, I mean twice (or more) the time to build a simple C project (from 5-6 seconds to 15 seconds), the whole system is really sluggish, I really think that it is a macOS issue.\nFor information, I tested mainly with gcc-9 and clang-10 with my school projects.\nI also used tcc 0.9.27, built from source, with a dummy make+C project, see below.\nI have already tried to reinstall macOS.\nI am not sure about what to do, have anybody ecountered this ?\nI need macOS for the iOS/tvOS toolchain, therefore I cannot switch.\nSwitching to a GNU/Linux distro would be nice if I could.\nIf anybody needs more specific data, do not hesitate.\nMany thanks for your help !\n\nEdit: I tried to replace a kext and got significant improvements, see below.\n\nThings I tested always on the same computer with this dummy repo edrflt/build_speed :\ntcc 0.9.27, built from source make -j5\nUbuntu 20.04 (fast)               0,94s user 0,53s system 342% cpu 0,428 total\n\nMac OS X Yosemite 10.10 (fast)    1,84s user 1,05s system 284% cpu 1,016 total\n\nMac OS X El Capitan 10.11 (fast)  3,04s user 1,18s system 316% cpu 1,332 total\n\nmacOS Sierra 10.12                4,70s user 2,64s system 265% cpu 2,769 total\n\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13           6,03s user 2,79s system 257% cpu 3,428 total\n\nmacOS Mojave 10.14 (slow)         8,30s user 3,09s system 231% cpu 4,912 total\n\nmacOS Catalina 10.15 (slow)       6,01s user 3,35s system 193% cpu 4,827 total\n\nBuild time is multiplied by almost 5 vs Ubuntu 20.04 which takes less than one second.\ngcc-9\nUbuntu 20.04 - gcc 9.3.0 from apt\nmake -j5  10,15s user 4,69s system 361% cpu 4,111 total\nmake -j5  10,13s user 4,74s system 357% cpu 4,162 total\nmake -j5  10,27s user 4,54s system 359% cpu 4,119 total\n\nmacOS Catalina 10.15 - gcc 9.3.0 from brew\nmake -j5  13,95s user 10,55s system 298% cpu 8,204 total\nmake -j5  16,91s user 12,81s system 252% cpu 11,752 total\nmake -j5  14,05s user 10,81s system 295% cpu 8,412 total\n\n\nKext replacement - significant improvements\nAfter some investigations, I found that IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext could be the culprit (or one of them).\nI replaced the kext in my setup of Catalina with the one from El Capitan, ran the same tests, got these results (with tcc) :\nmake -j5   5.75s user 2.21s system 278% cpu 2.862 total\nmake -j5   5.78s user 2.13s system 278% cpu 2.837 total\nmake -j5   5.74s user 2.13s system 277% cpu 2.836 total\nmake -j5   5.74s user 2.14s system 288% cpu 2.736 total\n\nWhat I understand here is that I got performances around the one I could get with Sierra.

It could be because of the new improvements or the patched Meltdown and Spectre.\n\nBut, then I did my own research:\nI installed GNU/Linux, and saw the same improvements as you: more responsive system, faster compilation. But, okay, GNU/Linux is known to be faster, but it's not normal to have such a big difference. And these are also patched for meltdown and Spectre.\n\nNext step, installing El Capitan:\nI remembered how macOS was faster in the past, so I decided to give it a try and install El Capitan on my Macbook, And yes, EVERYTHING was faster (and you need to play around to get it installed because apple has probably \"forgotten to renew the certificates\").\n\nNow that I'm sure that there is a thing:\nI talked about it to see if I'm the only one experiencing the issue.\nI have a friend with the same Macbook as me. So we set up a Genius bar meeting. We went to an Apple store, showed them the facts, one Macbook on El Capitan, the other one on Sierra (yes it's a long time ago)\nThey saw we were right, and the Genius said: \"I'm sorry, I see there is a problem, but I can do nothing for you, maybe try sending a Feedback\"\nWe went out with no hope. But we sent a feedback, which was ignored by Apple.\n\nThe last thing, is more of a rumor, but I'm taking it into consideration because it explains why:\nI spoke about my Macbook problem to my colleagues. And one of them, knew there is a issue on these Macbooks, so I asked him more details, he has a friend working as a developer for Apple, they are totally aware of the issue with those Macbooks, but the instructions are clear: \"Don,'t talk about it, forget it\"\nTechnical details:\nIt's apparently a kext issue with the SMC (or the power supply controller?), they used a cheap controller. This controller's job is to provide sufficient amount of power to the CPU (It's like a feature for improving turbo boost I think)\nAnd his work is not done properly which is why we are experiencing these issues.\nThe controller is disabled on other operating systems because they don't have the kext. That's why we only have the issue on macOS\nThat's a pretty convincing reason: they blew the driver and don't want to repair their own mistake, so we have to buy a new one pretending our laptop is old. But there are only 5 generation of Intel processors between this Mac, and today. And we all know how minimal the improvements are.\n\nIf anyone has an idea that could make Apple/(more) people hear us, or find more proofs that Apple is duping us, please let us know\n", "Q: One click force delete unsaved images in Preview I have made many screenshots and pasted into Preview and do not want to walk through the \"Save\" dialog for each one\n\nYes I could click on Delete (or tab five times as I end up doing instead) but I am a keyboardist and after doing this many dozens of times I'd rather use a quick keyboard shortcut .

I’m using two LG 24UD58-B monitors, but I cannot get 60Hz out of them using an HDMI cable, which is then connected to a Thunderbolt 3 to HDMI Adapter. On LG’s website, it says 60Hz is only possible with a DisplayPort cable. I’m not sure which cable I would need in order to get 60 Hz on both of these monitors, so if anyone could recommend one, and which way it should be connected, I would really appreciate it. For example, would I need a Thunderbolt 3 to DisplayPort cable, with the DisplayPort end connected to the monitor, and the Thunderbolt 3 end connected to the Mac mini itself? Getting only 30Hz out of these monitors makes them feel really sluggish so I would definitely prefer to get the 60Hz out of them if I could. \n\nA: Get this USB-C (Thunderbolt) to DP cable.\nI use it myself to run a 4k Dell monitor with 60hz, and it works flawlessly. You are right that most HDMI adapters don't support 4k with 60hz, although the official specification supports it theoretically from HDMI 2.0 onwards. Using the mentioned USB-C to DP cable solved this issue for me.\n", "Q: Will it be fine to charge my iPad with 61W MBP charger I have a MBP charger which is 61w.

I have Docker installed on my Mac OS Catalina and recently found very big file Docker.raw. It is 64 Gb. Is it really needed? And if so, why is it so big ?\n\nA: Docker for Mac stores Linux containers and images in a single, large file named Docker.raw. To reduce its size, after having pruned the unused docker objects (\nhttps://docs.docker.com/config/pruning/ ), open the Docker Desktop preferences, and then under 'Resources' -> 'Advanced' -> 'Disk image size':\n\nYou can reduced file to less than 64GB. it's telling you how much is currently used by the current data. Also Resizing to a smaller size will delete the disk image; all Docker images / containers will be lost.

This is different from Docker on Linux, which usually stores containers and images in the /var/lib/docker directory.\n\nThe size of this file is big in your system because you have a lot of images and containers.

On my old Mac I have my web dev environment set up with AWS profiles, proper permissions for npm and lots of other little things. Does the Migration Assistant just copy your documents, images and apps, or does it do a complete mirror image of the system?\n\nA: Migration Assistant will copy everything in your home directory from your old Mac to your new one, so everything in your home directory will stay the same. \nIt will also try to copy applications and other system configurations to the new system, but it will not do a complete mirror image of the previous system. \nIf, for example, your old Mac is running MacOS 10.14 \"Mojave\" and the new one is running MacOS 10.15 \"Catalina\", you'll end up with Catalina on the new Mac. \nIf you want on the new Mac a system as close as possible to the previous one you can restore a Time Machine backup on the new Mac. \nBut I'm not sure if it's a good idea to put an older version of MacOS on a new Mac that comes with a newer version of MacOS - it may not work as expected.

On my machine, kernel_task has a very large number of reads and writes compared to my usage. I spend almost all my time online on google chrome.  \nOver the past month, Activity Monitor shows kernel_task having written over 300 GB, launchd having written 30 GB with Chrome 10 GB. kernel_task dominates my total disk i/o. And every day it seems to be writing something. About 20 GB or so every day I estimate.\nWhat is it writing? Is there some way I can check and maybe disable some option? Time Machine is disabled on my machine so its not that. My total disk space is not increasing so it seems to be temporary writes which makes it worse. Some sort of log?\nThanks\n\nA: As the name suggests, kernel_task is like a task master and does a lot of system tasks for the macOS kernel. \nReading and writing to disks is one of the tasks it performs, so a lot of system data or app data may be read and written through kernel_task. So obviously it will show a high count. One thing to particular check is RAM usage - if you don't have enough RAM for some task, macOS will create swap memory on your disks and that also will count towards the high read and write in disk activity for kernel_tasks. This can explain what you are experiencing - swap memory read / write are temporary writes and so don't show up as using your disk space.\nChrome is known to be both a CPU and memory hog. Dump it and switch to Safari or Firefox which use less resource.\nNote that kernel_task also plays a role in managing the CPU temperature, which may show it as using high CPU in Activity Manager. So if it is showing as using a high percentage of CPU, you can temporarily kill other apps or processes using most of the CPU as they are the cause why kernel_task kicks in (higher CPU usage = higher CPU temperature). \n", "Q: Any way to force installing Mojave on a Catalina compatible system?

I run a 2012 Mac mini using a Logitech C920 HD Pro USB 1080p Webcam with it. Recently I've noticed it's really laggy. Even in a Skype test window or camera settings, it lags about a second and is very jerky.\nTests show I am getting about 1fps. I tried the Logi Capture app as suggested and it presented more settings but none helped. \nAlso: audio doesn't work on it. It reports as a microphone but didn't work as one. \nAlso: maybe a non-issue but my webcam device name is reported as \"HD Pro Webcam C902 #2\" - why #2? Some apps have a drop-down showing two cameras, this one and . \nIt seems to me like it's surely a driver issue but I cannot see Logitech provide drivers, and MacOS doesn't seem to recognize webcams as a category in Settings.\nOne thing I spotted while researching was about the Mic issue, it talked about changing the sound settings on the device:\n\nBut, on my Mac that Format drop-down is non-editable:\n\nThat might be a MacOS version discrepancy but I do feel for whatever reason, it is not properly supported at the hardware level.\n\nA: So, I fixed it. By unplugging it, and plugging it back in to a different socket!

I just replaced the SSD in my MacBook Air (early 2015). I erased/formatted it in the Disk Utility (choosing APFS as desired format and GUID partition scheme) and then tried to restore my Time Machine back-up. Looked like it was going well and gave me circa 1 1/2 hours until all restored. Countdown continued. Fine.\nBut then instead I got prohibitory (circle with bar through it) symbol. Reading round, maybe too late an OS for my Mac? Or some other issue?\nBut when I try reinstalling the version previously on my Mac (using command + R on start-up), it gives me the option to agree to installing El Capitan, but I now can’t see the new SSD to install it to. Likewise, when I go into Disk Utility, I can’t see any internal drive anymore although it was showing up before I formatted it. (And I can’t see an option to ‘View > Show all devices’ referenced in various other threads.)\nAny help (and STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS!) appreciated. Just want to get my old stuff onto a larger drive and get on with my work!\nThank you.\n\nA: I think you bought a NVMe SSD, did you ? What model is your new SSD ?\nmacOS High Sierra was the first to support NVMe SSDs, that would explain why El Capitan can't see yours.\nYou may want to try cmd-alt-R at boot in order to boot the latest macOS Recovery available for your Mac from the internet. It should be Catalina, which supports NVMe SSDs.\n", "Q: MacBook is attacked but can't find any threats Recently, I was installing an unofficial software on my mac. It's a mistake, I know, but I was so confident that I can register if something is going wrong.  \nComing to the point, I give the permission to run from an unidentified developer and start the installation. However, I did noticed that the installation is weird, you can tell with a little bit of experience, so I stoped it immediately, but it was too late. My mac is going too slow, even when I'm just browsing the internet and not doing any hard work, it's getting overheated and I also noticed that the battery is wasted significantly fast, even on sleep mode. So, I'm pretty sure that there is some sort of viruses running in the background.  \nI did tried several antivirus programs, malware scanners etc. but it all says the same \"No viruses or malware found\". Really don't know what to do, anyone have suggestions for advanced scanners or something like that? Just without formatting the device please. \nHere is a screenshot from my Activity Monitor:\n\n\n\nA: \"Going slow\" is not really an indicator of malware. Most malware can do its job without using significant CPU, and malware designers want their software to be unnoticed.\nIf several malware apps have said \"it's not malware\", then that's probably true.\nIt's much more likely that there are other problems with your Mac. Check Activity Monitor, and see what is using excessive CPU. Remove third-party Launch Agents or any other software that runs in the background. Test a new user account, and see if that it better. If so: it's a user account problem.\nMake sure you have low memory pressure (also in Activity Monitor), and that you have plenty of free disk space. \n\nA: Try Clean My Mac. It checks for viruses and deletes them, as well as uninstalls any unnecessary files. It can also act as an app uninstaller, making sure every file and folder related only to that app is deleted. It generally removes about 3 gigabytes a week from my main computer, and it hasn't deleted any thing I haven't wanted it to yet. The only downside is that it cost $40 to get a key, but it is totally worth it if you are using your Mac as your primary computer. It mainly deletes outdated stuff, but it allows you to choose what to and what not to delete. It does not constantly monitor your system, it just scans it when you open the app and tell it to. It lets you see what you are deleting just in case you don't want to delete anything.\n\n", "Q: Upgrade Mac Pro 5.2 2012 I have a Mac Pro 5.2 2012 which currently has both the GeForce and Radeon, 16 GB memory and 1TB normal HDD. I want to upgrade this Mac Pro to its max without over doing something, for example I read in some articles that upgrading it to 96GB memory will give the same result if having 128GB meaning the extra memory is kinda useless. I also read that the bluetooth needs to be changed to support things. So can anyone advise me with the best configurations for Harddrive, memory, GPUs, bluetooth and USB ports?\n\nA: \"to its max\" is extremely vague, especially as you didn't really tell us much about your existing configuration.\nBut here are some 'max' specs you can run on a 2012 Pro\n\n\n*\n\n*Max RAM - 128GB in dual channel or 96GB in triple channel.  ~$400 (but only if you have a dual CPU) - [OWC]\n\n*Max Graphics - Nvidia GTX Titan X or AMD RX 5700 - [macvidcards] $675 - $800 \n\n*Max OS - generally High Sierra with NVidia or Mojave with AMD.  \n\n*Max Drives - 7. Four in the regular bays, one above the optical & two on a PCI card - [Mac Pro PCIe SSD Hardware Options]  \n\n*Max CPUs - dual 6-core Xeon 3.46GHz - [OWC] $1,379\n\n*Max Bluetooth/WiFi - [macvidcards] $175\n\n*Max USB - 4-port PCI USB 3 card - [innatek] $30 (but many of these type of card are incompatible with newer OSes 10.10+))\n\n", "Q: iOS keyboard suggests an old email address I'm running iOS 13.4.1 on an iPad Air 2. When I click on an email form field in Safari, the keyboard suggests two email addresses, one labeled \"home\" and one labeled \"email\". The \"home\" address is the address I use for my Apple ID, but the \"email\" address is an old email address that I haven't used in over ten years. How did iOS find this email address, and how can I get rid of it?\nThe old email address still forwards to my main email address, so it's possible that iOS extracted it from my mail, but I have other email addresses that forward to my main address that it doesn't suggest. I couldn't find anything in my iCloud account that's linked to the old address, and I didn't own any Apple products ten years ago. Any ideas?\n\nA: iOS gets your email addresses and other accounts from two places. The first place is your Contact Card in Contacts. The second is from your Accounts and Passwords settings in the Settings app. In your specific case, go to your Contact card and see if the email with the label \"email\" is there. If so then iOS got it from there. You can also check in Settings under the Accounts and Passwords section. These are the only two places it could have come from (maybe iCloud Keychain but probably not). Hope this helps!\n", "Q: Triple boot: “Missing operating system” on Windows 10 partition after Windows update I have a triple booted MacBook Pro (using rEFInd as boot manager).

I'd like to restore a series of deleted messages (a whole conversation) to an iPhone. The snag is - they're backed up on my computer but not on iCloud.\nIs that possible at all?\n\nA: You can restore the whole backup to your iPhone, which will obliterate/replace all of what is on your iPhone now with the contents of that backup. Unfortunately the restore is an all-or-nothing thing, and replaces all of what is on the iPhone now. Also a big caveat that if you use iCloud Messages syncing, then iCloud will just tell the iPhone to \"re-delete\" those messages from the phone again shortly after you restore it, since their deleted state is tracked in iCloud. (You can see if you use Messages syncing by going to Settings app > your name > iCloud, and see if the Messages switch is turned on.\nAnother alternative is to read the messages to your computer out of the backup where they're not deleted. This will at least give you access to the messages on your computer but not restored to the iPhone. There's a few programs to do this.

The USB ports are becoming a bit unstable (according to a music software I'm using). I've never used the Thunderbolt port, so assume it would be stable. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a Thunderbolt dock I could connect to the Thunderbolt port which would accept my USB2 devices? I understand that the Thunderbolt port I have is not the fastest or latest. What is important to me is that I can still use my devices ie: keyboard, audio/MIDI interface and external storage HDs, all with USB2 connectors and independent power. \n\n*Would the Thunderbolt dock also be able to connect to a newer Thunderbolt port should I decide to upgrade. (semi retired musician, so have to be very careful). \n\nA: Starting off, it’s important to know that any Thunderbolt dock that you get will be obsolete by about five years (at the time of this writing).\nYou need a Thunderbolt 1 or Thunderbolt 2 dock.  They will support your requirements of plugging in your peripheral devices; hard drives, keyboards, mice, etc.  You may need an adapter for your MIDI interface, but it will be no different than needing the same adapter to connect directly to your Mac.\nThunderbolt is backward compatible meaning that it will connect to older Thunderbolt devices.  However, going from a new Thunderbolt 3 port to older Thunderbolt 1 or 2 port, will require an adapter due to the differences in needing an active (powered) cable versus a passive cable.\nDo I recommend you going this route?  No!\nThis is a nearly decade old Mac with all obsolete tech and by your own admission, the ports are becoming “unstable”, likely from being  worn and the connections getting loose.  You’re throwing good money at something that will simply only get worse - you’d be buying already discontinued and obsolete tech (if you can actually source it).  Your better bet is to get a more modern Mac with reliable ports and support for new(er) operating systems.\n", "Q: Backups not available in Time Machine, but visible in disk's backupdb folder I'm running 10.15.4.

If you set it to off, it doesn't mean its really disabled...\nI uninstalled it and suddenly the issue disappeared. \nWhich makes kinda sense, because Sophos is checking the traffic to scan for malware/virus thats why its proxies the traffic over. Why its still doing this when its disabled is another question.\nIt seems at one point something got seriously broken with my Sophos installation, which is why this issue appeared. Maybe the update to Catalina or a Sophos update.\nI have now installed Sophos again (company policy) and the issue is still gone. So fix was reinstalling AV...\nIf somebody is having a similar issue, try to UNINSTALL any AV scanner.

I cannot use USB because there is a problem with the socket. I can only charge the phone. The phone has internet connection and I can download apps. \nAn option is to start a server and connect via wifi, but how?\nWhat are the free solutions for that? Or what can you suggest? \n\nA: The iOS app GoodReader allows you to start a web server over wifi that shares GoodReader files (which can include photos). Your Windows PC should be able to connect using wifi and a web browser. GoodReader is a free download, but I don't know if this feature will be enabled without paying some $.\nBTW, I have no connection with the developer. However I have used the app for many years.\n\nA: You can use the iOS app PhotoSync which will synchronise your photos with its \"companion\" app running on Mac or Windows. The only requirement is that both iPhone and Mac/Windows are on the same LAN.\nSo long as the companion app is running, you control photo transfers from the iPhone.\nThe iOS app is \"free\", but only transfers low res photos. This is sufficient to establish that it will work for you. You then need an in-app purchase to enable full functionality. The companion app is free.\nI have used PhotoSync for many years.\n\nA: The iPhone can connect to any SMB share via the Files App.\n\n*\n\n*Enable sharing for a folder in Windows\n\n*On the iPhone: Open the Files App\n\n*Tap the icon with the 3 dots in the top right corner\n\n*Tap \"Connect to Server\"\n\n*For the address use smb://x.x.x.x (where x.x.x.x is your computers IP address or network name) and enter the corresponding username and password for your PC user.\n\nThen from the Photos App (as well as most other Apps) you can tap the Share icon and tap \"Save to Files\", where you can not select your PC as the destination.\n", "Q: My iPhone could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (4014) Error 4014 occurred when restoring my iPhone 6s I have restarted my iPhone, but it didn't help. I don't know what to do next. \nWhy did it happen?\n\nA: The why is a quality check where the Apple software tests for a response from your phone and that response wasn’t measured. \nIf I can assume you want a process to narrow this down, here is a guide. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201252\nAt the end, errors have some general fixes like restart and update. I would do all of them, they really fix many errors. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201210\nAt the end of all updates is a list of more errors, but I would do all the easy items first before getting to the page that lists specific error codes. Yours is quite involved and wants you to choose update or restore based on previous steps and really wants updates and restarts of the device before contacting Apple if you can’t get past the check. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201444\n", "Q: How to make the colors of the Mac more dull/faded? For more than a year I've had my phone in black & white mode and I find it greatly helps reduce the stimulating effect of using the phone, and makes me naturally use the phone less (and it's more calming etc). I feel way more productive!\nOn the desktop I can't go completely black and white (which is available in the Accessibility settings) because I do have lots of apps that rely on color, however;\nIs there a way in MacOS (via an ICC color profile, ColorSync app etc) to somehow change the color of my Mac monitor (either built-in display or thunderbolt display) to be \"faded\"/\"dull\" - almost geryscale but with a hint of color? \nWhen I run the Display Calibration or Go into Accessibility settings I seem to only be able to change the hue, but what I'm looking for is to have a nice and bright setup that is just less colorful (so literally greyscale with faded/hint of color).\nAnyone know how one might be able to do that?\n\nA: Go to System Preferences -> Displays and click on the Color tab. You should see several different profiles on the left.  Select one you don't expect to use and select it and then select Open Profile on the right. I don't know what all the numbers mean but you could try trial and error to maybe get a color profile more to your liking.\n\nA: I'm not sure if it'd meet you requirement, but perhaps adjusting the colour temperature of your display may help? System Preferences > Displays > Night Shift.\n\nIf your macOS release doesn't have that option, another option is the free third-party application f.lux. f.lux has more options that Night Shift, so you may also prefer it.\n", "Q: Apple script - formatted text to strikethrough but how do I also change its colour? - In Notes I have an Automator Quick Action routine that changes the font of selected text to Strikethrough.

I have related questions about a smart ID card reader for my MacBook Air.\nI need to insert a Smart ID card into a reader connected to my laptop when logged into a website for ID verification. I'm a non-technical person and this is freaking me out, but apparently people do this a lot.\n\n\n*\n\n*If I go to a random electronics store and buy a card reader will I have to download and install strange and scary software for the reader to work, or will MacOS already have something built in that will handle this safely?\n\n*Does Apple make a compatible reader that would be better to use than a random one from a store, where better means some combination of safer, more reliable and more secure?\n\n*I have an old 2012 MacBook Air but am buying a new 2020 MacBook Air soon. Because of the different connections will I need to buy two different readers?\n\n\nI saw this answer to Easy solution to use a SmartCard with a 15\" MacBook Pro? from 2011 but the item it links to is discontinued.\n\nA: A CAC (Common Access Card) or Smartcard reader is just a USB device that reads an authentication device in much the same way a USB SD or CompactFlash card reader reads those media.  The age and/or model of your Mac is irrelevant.\nWhat’s important is the OS.  Most card readers are compatible with macOS, But Catalina introduces some changes; specifically the change from the legacy TokenD to the new TokenCryptoKit framework.  More information can be found in the Apple Support document Prepare for smart card changes in macOS Catalina.  Basically, you may need to configure Catalina to use the older framework if the software you’re using hasn’t updated.  Your IT support staff will have to address this for you as they will be the ones who know if this is the case.\nAs far as what Smartcard reader to get, there are lots on the market, but I prefer to purchase from known brands; the IOGear GSR202 looks to be a good, reliable product.\n", "Q: No security options for external hard disk erase in Disk Utility I'm trying to erase an external disk drive that I had been using as a backup disk. There are no options for me to securely erase - the option just isn't there at all.\nIt is currently formatted as MAC OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted).\nI have a second HDD drive that when mounted shows the security options when erasing.\nAny ideas what is going on here? This is a new problem for me; I'm sure I've secure erased this disk before.\nEdit: I've just noticed that the only difference between the two disks is that the one that could be securely erased is down as a 'USB External Physical Volume' whereas the disk I'm having the problems with comes up as a 'CoreStorage logical volume'. Is this the issue?\n\nA: MacOS doesn't let you do a Secure Erase on encrypted volumes because there's no point: a single erase will delete the encryption keys; and any residual data on the disk will be meaningless junk that cannot be decrypted.\nMultiple zeroing of a mechanical disk can put significant stress on it and shorten its lifespan.\nSimilarly, MacOS doesn't let you secure erase SSDs, because that's also a pointless exercise: doing the erase doesn't actually make it more securely erased.\nWhy is a secure erase 'not necessary' for SSD's?\n\nA: I've found the answer, and I'm going to leave this question up in case it helps someone else.\nThe issue with the disk was that it had been encrypted. I needed to reformat it with no encryption for it to be recognised as a USB External Physical Volume instead of a CoreStorage logical volume.

How can this be done?\n\nA: Run this command in Terminal:\nstrings -ao /Applications/TickTick.app/Contents/Resources/Assets.car | grep menubar_icon_task@2x.png | awk \"{print \\$1}\" | xargs echo 232+ | bc | \\\nxargs -I{} echo \"printf '\\x01' | dd of=/Applications/TickTick.app/Contents/Resources/Assets.car bs=1 conv=notrunc seek={}\" | sh\n\nIt will narrow the menubar icon down so much that it will become invisible. Ctrl+'mouse drag' the icon to the left most place.\nExplanation:\nstrings finds the position of the icon in the asset container, echo and bc move a few bytes forward to get to the position that is responsible for the width of the icon. printf and dd set that byte to 1 for minimum width.\n", "Q: Dock Question - Application folders with the Applications I know this may be sacrilege but the OCD monster in me really would like to create application folders on the left side of the dock and have them fan out when I wanted to use them. \nFor example, having all the Microsoft Office apps in a fan to choose Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc. Having a fan with easy access to apps like System Preferences, Console, Terminal and Disk Utility. Putting the iOS apps like Music, Photos, Messages and FaceTime in a folder to fan out. Whatever I set the folder icon to be should be displayed in the Dock for that group.\nYes, there are everyday apps like browsers, email and Xcode that I still want explicitly on the dock as individual icons. I know I can have folders to the right, but I prefer to use that space for my project folders, Documents, Downloads and open windows. I would prefer putting the moderately used apps in a place where I can still access them from the Dock without overextending or opening via a Finder window or desktop folder.\nThanks.\nPS: What's the deal with Dock spacers? Why do they need to be a full icon width? Can't we have a half-width option?\n\nA: This is a partial answer.\nYou can put any group of items in a Dock fan by putting symlinks to each of them in a directory, and dragging that directory from Finder to Dock.  You may need to change its options to Fan after dragging it in.  You can also paste any image into the folder's icon in a Get Info window.\nBut as far as I know, you're stuck with it on the right unless you put the whole Dock on the left edge of the screen.\n", "Q: Is there a way to bring this disk to life?

I'm looking to buy a 27\" display for my MacBook Pro \n(2017 | 15.4-inch 2880 x 1800 | Intel HD Graphics 630 1536 MB graphics)\nI am considering a 4K display, but I've read in multiple places that scaling can cause performance issues. (This article explains the issue: https://bjango.com/articles/macexternaldisplays/)\nWill this be an issue with my MacBook?\n\nA: I am using a Macbook pro 13 2015 with a 4K 27 inch display, and definitely having performance issues when I use it in one of the scaled resolutions (e.g., 2560x1440, 2304x1296, 3008x1692..). When used in \"Default for display\" mode, which is an equivalent of 1920x1080 UI resolution, performance is great.\nAccording to specs of 2015 Macbook pro 13, the limit is to drive a 4K display at 3840x2160 resolution. When Macbook pro is used in any of the scaled resolutions, internally, GPU renders a canvas which is much bigger than the actual 4K resolution, and then downscales it to 4K. This puts real burden on performance.\nThe performance hit shows itself as stuttering animations on mission control window animations, with addition of fans spinning on higher RPMs.\nHowever, when I look at specs of 2017 Macbook Pro 15.4 which is listed here, I can see that it can properly drive two 5K resolutions simultaneously. Therefore, if you use 2560x1440 scaling on 27 inch 4K monitor, we could expect that its GPU would easily render the 5K canvas, then downscale it to 4K native resolution without any problems.\nThis was the elaboration about performance. From sharpness point of view, 2560x1440 scaled resolution would be just a bit softer than the exact pixel doubled 1920x1080 mode, however, if you look at a proper distance (greater than 53 cm according to this site), you won't notice too much difference. 2304x1296 scaled resolution works even greater, because text is a bit bigger.\nIf you accept to spend more money and if you can find one, the LG Ultrafine 4K or 5K displays from Apple would be the best, because you would be able to use them in exact pixel doubled mode, which gives sharpest image and best performance. However, with much less price, and some acceptable performance penalty, you could as well live with a 27 inch 4K display from other manufacturers. Just be sure to get a model which has less compatibility problems with Mac.\nYou can also have a look at my answer to a similar question here.\n\nA: No - just having that display connected won’t cause performance issues. If you have performance issues where your GPU is over driven, any display can make that worse, but the problem isn’t the display in that case IMO.\nFor perspective, My MacBook from 2015 with a 1.1 GHz Dual Core M CPU and Intel HD Graphics 5300 GPU runs 4K display and the integrated retina screen side by side and scales well. It’s fast, reliable and performant.\n\nThe Mac you have is far more capable than mine, so I can't see any reason why you would run into issues. Given a lower cost MacBook is still efficient and fast 5+ years down the line and MacBook Pro tend to last as long in my experience for almost all use cases.\n\nI do heavy text processing, web development, light Xcode and UI layout, and depend on Pixelmator Pro, xScope app, and all manner of pro work on this one ported wonder. Not everyone would like this, so I get if you need a better GPU / eGPU / Thunderbolt to develop, but I don't think you'll be limited with your Mac and a decent or better 4k display.\n\nA: Anecdotally, I believe that using scaling sizes that are not integer values, e.g. 1.5x, may require more work than using the default 2x scaling, or the 'native' 1x.\nSo a 4K display of 3840x2160 will work well at the default 2x Retina scaling of \"looks like 1920 x 1080\", but not at \"looks like 2560 x 1440\".\n", "Q: How to get photos from one iPad to another I'll try again at this site although it seems whenever I look for help with a question, I run afoul one rule or another.\nI am a volunteer who help seniors with tech problems related to their Apple devices.  I got this from one of them:\nWe just bought my Mom (102 years) a new iPad replacing one she has used for many years - primarily for email and internet access.  My brother just sent the following note explaining difficulty in loading the new iPad from the old one.  Unfortunately, she remains quarantined in a retirement center.  Your suggestions or leads to reliable blogs would be most welcome:  \n    Quote - The good news is that mom has a new seventh generation iPad, and I have been able to reload all her apps and contacts. \nI had to do this manually because her iPad was so old it would not do an AirDrop transfer, and after several hours work, I never could figure out how to load her information up on to iCloud and then download it to the new iPad. \nI know generally how to do this, having done it with new iPhone purchases of my own, but I could not make it work with hers. \n In any event, what this means is that I have not been able to figure out how to transfer, en masse, the photos and numerous shared website albums that we have all sent her over the years.  When I set up her new iPad, I had to open a new Apple account for her using a new iCloud address. \nSo, whatever shared albums and photos that you previously sent her and for which you wish for her to have continued access, you need to reinvite her or resend to her using her email address.  End Quote.\n\nWith the lady in question quarantined in a nursing home, I don’t know how they got hold of the iPad but they did.\nThe fact that they had to get her a new Apple ID means that they can’t sync the photos to which they would like to give her access, correct?\nI believe they are correct in their surmisal:  \"whatever shared albums and photos that you previously sent her and for which you wish for her to have continued access, you need to reinvite her or resend to her using her email address.”\nAny suggestions to help out this 102 year old gal would be most welcome.\n\nA: \"I had to open a new Apple account\"\nThat was the mistake. \nNothing on the old iPad is owned by the owner of the new iPad.

Selecting OSX from that points worked as normal for me.\n", "Q: What external monitor and size combinations provide best scaling on macOS? I am trying to get an external monitor for my MacBook. I have two requirements:\n\n*\n\n*Items on the monitor will be about the same size as items on the MacBook screen\n\n*Text and other objects will not be blurry\n\nHowever, I have heard that not all monitors will provide these two things—the monitor needs to be a specific size and resolution. Otherwise either the scaling or sharpness will be off—with certain combinations of resolutions and screen sizes, you would need to choose between proper scaling (how large something appears on a native screen versus the external screen), and good sharpness (how clear the text and images appear on the screen).\nTo test this, I tried looking at current display offerings that Apple provides. I noticed an interesting trend: most Apple displays have a pixel per inch (PPI) value of ~220. For examples, the 21.5 inch and 27 inch iMacs, all of the retina MacBooks and MacBook Pros, the Pro Display XDR, and both LG 4K and 5K displays.\nOlder, non-retina displays have a PPI of around 110.\nI have a 24-inch 1080p screen, which is the same size but half the resolution of the 4K LG display. It scales perfectly, which makes sense since it has exactly half the resolution which having the same size. Edit: the sizes of objects on my internal screen and external monitor are not exactly the same. This was leading me to a lot of confusion. It turns out you'll only get exactly the same size with very specific panel size and resolution combinations (as described below).\nI assume that a 1440p display that is 27-inch will also provide perfect scaling on macOS, since it is exactly half the resolution, but exactly the same size of a 5K display. These two resolution-screen size pairs I can thus add to my list.\nIs there a list of complete resolution and screen size pairs available which provides perfect scaling on macOS? For example, would a 1440p or a 4K display that is 27 inches provide good scaling?\n\nA: You are right with your research and assumptions. MacOS doesn't provide scaling options for all external screens. RDM enables you to access unavailable resolutions. Though you won't get a perfect image, since you always want to use the full resolution, but different scaling. But if the native scaling is not good enough, and MacOS doesn't provide other scaling options, you will end up with a sub par image. Either not sharp or not properly scaled elements, as you described.\nThis is a problem many people had before: E.g. here, here and probably the best solution in here. To make it short: Apparently you can get the system to be scaled using this and set RDM to a high resolution. But I never tested this.\nI understand that you want to buy a new monitor, that is capable to be sharp and scaled correctly using macOS out of the box. Makes sense.\nUnfortunately there is no reference or overview of scaling supported displays to my knowledge. It seems to be mostly trial and error. So I can share my experiences:\nHelpful overview of display resolution standards\nDisplays that don't work properly on a Mac\n\n\n*\n\n*27\" UHD: 3840 x 2160, 163.18ppi - which is almost every UHD screen available\n\n*25\" QHD - like this Benq 25\", 117.49ppi (only native scaling available, therefore everything is quite small)\n\n\nApple Screens\n\n\n*\n\n*13.3\" MacBooks:       2560 × 1600, 227ppi\n\n*16\" MBP:              3072 x 1920 (16:10), 226ppi\n\n*iMac 21.5\" (Full HD): 1920 x 1080, 102.5ppi\n\n*iMac 21.5\" (4K):      4096 x 2304, 219ppi\n\n*LG Ultrafine 23.7\":   3840 x 2160, 185.9ppi\n\n*LG Ultrafine 27\" and iMac (27\"): 5120 x 2880, 218ppi\n\n*Pro Display XDR (32\"): 6016 x 3384 (16:9), 218ppi\n\n\nOther screens that work properly on a Mac\n\n\n*\n\n*24\" Full HD, 91.79ppi\n\n*...more?\n\n\nIt would be great to hear others experiences with different screen sizes and resolutions, to help you with your decision.\n\nA: I had to make a similar decision for myself. In summary: after lots of researching and testing, I found an LG 27 inch 4k display to be the best balance from price/performance point of view for now. I tried to explain in following sub-topics:\nIdeal PPI for laptops and desktop screens are different\nFirst of all, Apple adjusts its desktop monitor default PPI values to look like 110 PPI, however for laptops, they tend to use higher PPI values. For example:\n\n*\n\n*Default scaled resolution for Macbook Pro 16 is 1792x1120. On an 16 inch display, this results in 132 PPI.\n\n*Default scaled resolution for current Macbook pro 13 is 1440x900, which results in around 128 PPI on 13.3 inch screen.\n\nTherefore, you should first accept the fact that, on a large screen, expecting the same PPI values (thus same size of fonts) as the macbook screen won't be an ideal solution (unless you have eagle eyes). After that point, you should be hunting for a display, which would give you a good scaled resolution which gets closer to 110 PPI.\nOn a desktop screen you should aim for something between 90-110 PPI\nIf you follow Apple's desktop scaling habits, ideally, you would like to get that 110 PPI on a non-scaled, pixel doubled\nresolution. This means that, if the screen resolution is X by Y, when you calculate the resulting PPI for X/2 by Y/2 resolution on particular display size, you should get 110 PPI. This is called the pixel doubled HiDpi mode.\nHowever, one of the most popular size: 24 inch 1920x1200 16:10 aspect ratio monitor is 94 PPI. This size has been very popular for productivity. Therefore, we can assume that anything between 90-110 ppi will be good.\nUsing the pixel doubled mode will have two benefits:\n\n*\n\n*The text on the screen will be sharpest, because MacOs will use exactly 4 pixels to render 1 pixel of graphical elements.\n\n*It will put on the least amount of stress on your GPU and CPU, which will make the computer run much cooler/quieter and all the gui animations to run smoothly. This is especially important if you have an older mac.\n\n27 Inch 5K is the best, but not widely available\nWithout no doubt, according to the above criteria, a 27 inch 5K screen, or a 20 inch 4K screen would be the best option. Unfortunately, both options are not available unless you buy an IMac. You can use the DPI/PPI calculator to check the actual PPI values you'll get for a resolution and screen size. Remember to divide the native resolution of the screen by 2 to find out the PPI values which result when the display is used in pixel doubled HiDPI mode.\nDell p2415q is one of the 4K monitors which come close according to the specs. It is 24 inch and 4K, which results in 91.8 PPI. Since you are already happy with the 1080p resolution on 24 inch display, getting p2415q will be a safe choice regarding sizes of UI elements. However, this monitor has an older design, and reportedly, its compatibility with mac is not very good. You can still try.\nLater edit on March 09, 2022: Apple released their new 27 Inch 5k Studio display in yesterday's Apple event, and it looks like it will be the best external display for a mac, providing one's budget allows it. It is 218 ppi native and runs at 109 ppi UI resolution, which is exactly what is required for optimum performance and sharpness.\nNext best option is a 4K 27 inch monitor\nOn the other hand, you can buy a 27 inch 4K monitor and use it in:\n\n*\n\n*pixel doubled mode 1080p: 81.5 PPI\n\n*2304x1296 scaled mode: 98 PPI\n\n*2560x1440 scaled mode: 109 PPI\n\nI tried all three of the modes, and from a sharpness point of view, I was quite happy with all of them. However, the sharpness advantage of the pixel doubled mode is definitely perceivable. Since I am using a 2015 macbook pro 13, choosing the pixel doubled mode gives me performance advantage, therefore I use it in that mode. Note that the perceived sharpness difference between pixel doubled and scaled modes will also depend on the distance you will be looking at the display. On that regard, I recommend using the Is this retina? calculation tool. If you will be using the display beyond the distance the monitor's pixel density becomes retina, you will realize less decrease of sharpness in scaled modes. For a 27 inch 4K monitor, this distance is 53 cm. (Right now, as I am writing this, I am looking at my 27 inch 4K LG monitor from 63 cm distance. )\nSharpness depends on how distant you look at\nNote that even Apple started to use scaled resolutions on their macbook pro line up in recent years, so as long as you are looking at the display from a distance greater than the retina limit, you should not be afraid of the decreased sharpness. However, the performance drawback of scaled resolutions are real. For example, in order to display 2560x1440 scaled resolution on a 4K display, MacOs first renders a 5120x2880 canvas, then downscales it to 4K. Remember that this is done 60 times each second. I have made lots of tests with Intel Power Gadget to test for the impact, and the result was clearly elevated CPU/GPU temperatures combined with fans spinning in higher RPMs. This tests was on a 2015 13 inch Macbook pro. For newer hardware and/or discrete graphics, your milage will vary.\nSharpness wise, 27 Inch 5K > 27 Inch 4K > 27 Inch QHD\nTo sum up, a 27 Inch 5K would be the best. However, 27 Inch 4K used at scaled 2560x1440 will be a lot sharper than 27 Inch QHD monitor when used with MacOS.\nBecause of the lack of ideal affordable solution, the best solution which worked for me was to get an affordable 27 inch 4K monitor, at least until 5K or higher resolutions become the standard.\nConsequently, I would not not recommend buying a QHD monitor (2560x1440 native), since you will loose the ability to scale and actual native pixel density will be much lower. I believe modern MacOs versions depend too much on having a dense array of pixels to render text smoothly.\nOn the other hand, as an added bonus, Windows 10 scales beautifully with a 27 inch 4K monitor, too.\nNote: I did not put Pro display XDR into consideration, since its price, and requirement for the newest hardware to drive 6K display.\n\nA: I have the same questions since RTINGS resigned from reviewing DELL monitors in the Monitors for MacBook Pro \nhere.\nI really like DELL U2520D from 2020, but when I saw comment from @youngpilot here about BENQ which has same 117.5 ppi, now will have to continue my research.\nGuys on youtube last week made some reviews for 25 inch DELL, but they do not review it from developers perspective, when you look at the text whole day.

Using macOS Catalina 10.15.4\nAt boot, I pressed Cmd+R to enter recovery. I then used the disk utils to erase the \"Machintosh HD - Data\" partition.\nI then went over to reinstall the OS and when prompted to choose between \"Machintosh HD\" and \"Macintosh HD - Data\", I chose \"Macintosh HD\". That gave me an error, saying basically that nothing could be installed to that partition. I then retried, but this time used the \"Macintosh HD - Data\" partition. All good, the OS installed and here I am now... just opened up Disk Utils and I see this mess:\n\n\n\nWhat on earth happend? How can I fix this mess? Screenshots of each partition are above.\n\nA: What you have done is upset the logical volume \"Macintosh HD\".\nFor security reasons macOS Catalina splits the logical boot volume, in your case \"Macintosh HD\" into two physical volumes, one for all the system files and another for the use data which has \" - Data\" put on the end of the name. You've erased half the logical volume, you should have erased either the whole disk or the whole container.\nSince your drive is blank the easiest way to fix this is to erase the entire physical device.\nTo start click the pop up \"View\" in the top left corner and select \"Show All Devices\".\nHere's what mine looks like.\n\nYou can see the disk has one APFS container with two physical volumes.

I've seen there are three photo libraries, which take around 320GB. One is the migrated iPhoto library, which I think I can delete without problems, but then there are two Photos libraries, both around 108GB (Photos Library and Photos Library 2)\nAre they both necessary?\nAnd really can I delete the migrated iPhoto library?\n\nA: You need to be careful here…\nThe old iPhoto library doesn't take up any actual space on the drive. When it was first translated to the new Photos structure all that actually happened was that hard links were made. These are multiple pointers to the same file. Only when both pointers are removed, eg by deleting the same file from both the old & the new library, is the file itself actually deleted.\nThere's a further issue though, & I'm not sure how this is dealt with on OSes since High Sierra.\nAPFS can't use hard links.\nI really don't know what this means for the two sets of data previously reliant on hard links. Perhaps they are now 'real' so deleting the old iPhoto library will actually free up space.\nIn either case, deleting the old iPhoto library should be safe. It has all already been migrated to the new structure.\nFor the other two, you need to be more circumspect.  \nLoad up each & see what's actually in there. It's quite possible to have multiple valid libraries, each with its own content. At launch, hold the  Opt ⌥  key & you will be presented with a dialog allowing you to choose which library to open.\nThere's no way I know of to merge the two, should it be desired; the only way I can think of would be to export from one to a new folder, then re-import to the other - then you could delete the now spare library & the intermediate folder.\nI'd be very tempted, however, to make sure to have a good backup before you start… just in case.\n\nA: I use a tool to help me remove duplicates and merge / split libraries. I can’t ever get my photos back if I delete them from my primary library, so unless you have an archive of them before you added them, consider the time you’ll save with a tool for this. It might not make sense, but worth considering / evaluating for free and a small time investment.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://fatcatsoftware.com/powerphotos/\nI have no stake in this company other than spending my money happily on quality software that gets upgrades all the time and excellent support.\n", "Q: 4k movie on 4k screen scaled to 1080 I have my first ever 4k screen - a new 55\" TV - & I'm struggling with this paradigm.\nI have to set it to show the desktop at an apparent 1080p otherwise I need to be within about 15\" to be able to actually read it.\nSo, what happens if I want to watch a 4k movie on it?\nThis is a bit hypothetical at the moment, I don't yet have any 4k content to test this, & I've been holding back because I'm thinking it's just going to get down-sampled to display on my \"1080p\" output, thereby gaining nothing.\nIs this actually going to be the case?

(need to insert wet signature) If Preview allows entering textboxes and drawing shapes and lines and even coloring them, why is it impossible to paste an image onto the PDF document? Isn't it exactly the same concept? Why does one work but not the other?\nEdit: what I want to do is add a wet signature (signed with ink). So I have my ink written signature as a JPEG file of a scan I took of it. But no way to port it into the PDF document directly (work around would be to convert PDF to PNG and back to PDF).\nPreview allows for a digital signature. But I'm not looking for digital.\n\nA: It's not the same concept.  There's annotating a PDF and then there's editing a PDF.\nAnnotating is also known as \"marking up\" a document.  Inserting an image is editing it.  Preview isn't a PDF editor.\nThink of it as a written document submitted to a teacher, professor, or a manager at work.  They may take a red pen and write comments in the margin, make several comments and circle it or box it in, strike out portions, correct spelling, etc.  However, inserting an image would change the whole document.  The reviewer isn't going to rewrite/reformat your document so that the image would fit. \nTo get another perspective of this, consider the two PDF products from Adobe are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Acrobat Reader (Free)\n\n*Acrobat Pro ($12.99/mo)\n\n\nReader allows you to do everything that Preview does from marking up, signing and even filling out and collecting responses from PDF forms.  However, you can't edit the document (which includes inserting graphics).  For that, you need the Pro version (if using Adobe; there are other editors available on the market).\nSignatures\nPreview allows for the capture of signatures via the following methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign on your trackpad.\n\n*Capture with your camera\n\n*Capture by using your finger or Apple Pencil with your iPhone or iPad\n\n\nYou’ll find this on the Markup Toolbar and then selecting Sign.  You can find full details on how to do this on Apple’s support document Fill out and sign PDF forms in Preview on Mac.\nAcrobat Reader allows you to use a graphic image as your signature.\n\nTo sign a PDF document or form, you can type, draw, or insert an image of your handwritten signature. You can also add text, such as your name, company, title, or the date. When you save the document, the signature and text become part of the PDF.\n\n(Emphasis mine).\n\nA: Preview can add signature from camera, so if you still have the original and your Mac has camera, open Markup Toolbar, click Sign button and choose Camera, then put up the original in front of the camera, click Done after Preview successfully capture it.\nOtherwise here is a nifty trick posted in this forum:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your image file\n(in Preview)\n\n*Select All (Command-A)\n\n*Copy (Command-C)\n\n*Paste (Command-V)\n\nNow you have a copy of your image pasted above your old image.

By \"normally\" I mean from the app's listing, instead of from the list of apps purchased by other family members. \nI'm aware that I can go to the list of purchased apps and download from there to avoid being double-charged, but what if I click the link in the App Store listing that says (e.g.) $9.99?  If the price shows up, even though a family member has already paid for the app, does that mean I'll actually get charged that price again?  Or is this simply a (giant!) bug in Apple's App Store app?\n\nA: \nWill I get charged for an iOS app that a family member already paid for, if I download normally?\n\nShort answer is, it depends on whether the app in question has Family Sharing enabled for it by the publisher of the app.\n\nIf the price shows up, even though a family member has already paid for the app, does that mean I'll actually get charged that price again?\n\nYou won't get charged for the app in question if and only if the following conditions are met:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are a part of a Family under Family Sharing.\n\n*A family member has already bought the app in question.\n\n*The app in question has Family Sharing enabled for it by the publisher.\n\nOr is this simply a (giant!) bug in Apple's App Store app?\n\nThis is not a bug from Apple, it's by design. Not every app on the App Store automatically becomes available for free to the rest of the family if at least one of the family member has bought it. It's up to the publisher of the app whether to enable Family Sharing for their app or not.\nSo it would appear logical and consistent that you as a user would see the app normally along with a price tag on the purchase button (which is an expected behavior). When you attempt to buy the app by tapping on the price button and it meets the eligibility criterion for Family Sharing, you are prompted that a family member has already bought the app, and, because it has Family Sharing enabled by the publisher, you won't be charged for it.\n(P.S.: While it's for fact that this behavior is by design, the reasoning behind logical and consistent appearance is based on my personal interpretation.)\n", "Q: Is there a way to transfer specific apps from one Mac to another I bought a new MacBook Pro and I want to pick some apps from my old MacBook and transfer them to my new MacBook.\nI am aware of Migration Assistant and it can copy the entire Applications folder to the new MacBook. However, I don't want all the apps from my old MacBook. I only want to be able to pick a few apps that I need.\n\nA: While generally speaking, you can simply copy an app bundle from one Mac to another, it doesn't carry over the user data and app preferences that the app generates and stored elsewhere (generally somewhere in users home directory).\nAlso, not every app Mac installs as a .app bundle and may have installed files elsewhere, causing the copying over .app bundle approach to not work well.\nRecommended approaches that you can take are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall the apps from source. It could be either Mac App Store, Homebrew Cask or direct download from the publishers website. This way you'd get the apps installed afresh and in the way the developer intended.\nAlso, even if some of the apps are paid, most Mac apps come with a licenses that lets you use them on all of your personal Macs.\nThis approach may have a drawback where you may lose app specific preferences and data (not necessarily user data but data such as plug-ins which is directly managed by the app).\nHowever, this approach would be the most likely recommended one as it would let you have a clean install.\n\n*If you are concerned about losing app specific configuration and app data, you may consider using Migration Assistance or restoring to the new Mac via a Time Machine backup.\nThe benefit here would be that you can technically set your new Mac to be in the same state as the old one.\nOnce you have your new Mac setup, you can then normally uninstall the apps that you don't need, and, get rid of any data that got carried over and is not needed on the new machine.\nSo to conclude, if the app that you are looking to transfer was installed simply as a .app bundle, has not installed anything outside, and doesn't have any customisations that you care about losing, you'd be safe copying it over. (But then again, what's possibly preventing you from re-installing them from source?)\n", "Q: Why is my disk space shrinking? I've just got a second hand MacBook from my dad which is a 2017 version with 250GB storage. I've factory reset it so theoretically it should be a completely blank slate, but for some reason I'm losing disk space already. Every couple of minutes the available space shrinks; it seems I lose 100MG every ten minutes or so. I'm currently on 231.52GB free, and it was at least 235 a few hours ago.\nI know this began as soon as the computer switched on because the first thing I did was to check the storage space and I immediately noticed that it was going down. I'm not downloading anything at all from the internet, my downloads folder is completely empty. \nThis is really frustrating to me, not to mention making me a bit paranoid about when it's going to stop and how much space I'll have lost when it does. The whole reason I got this Mac was for the better storage as my previous one was less than half the size (120GB) and it was causing big problems. And granted it's only small chunk of the overall storage gone so far, but I'm gonna be using a lot of big files on this machine and I need all the space I can get. Does anyone know why this is happening and how to stop it? I'm wary of even downloading anything else until I get to the root of this problem. \n\nA: I think having 235GB free space on a 256GB SSD Macbook Pro is not very likely on an active system. 256GB SSD Mac normally has about 250 GB of available space. The system and pre-installed apps would easily take much more space than 15 GB. \nOn the other hand, mac storage reporting can dynamically change (up or down) as calculations take place. You might have been observing that going up and down in calculations. \nOn a fresh installed OS, much things can be going. For example, spotlight might be building an index. As you browse web-sites, Safari or Google chrome will also be building up its cache. Likewise, if you use Spotify, even it will cache the songs you are listening. Therefore, I suggest that you use the system for a while and then see if the storage calculations settle down. \nWhen the things settle down, you can make an analysis of used space and try to see if everything is normal or not. Hope that helps. \n\nA: Go to System Preferences -> iCloud and when that panel opens the checkbox next to iCloud should be checked. If so click on the Options button on that line.  When another new panel opens, there is a checkbox near the bottom that says Optimize Mac Storage. Reverse this setting (if it's checked, uncheck it, if it's unchecked, check it).\n", "Q: hdiutil attach -shadow not working This question is for those of you familiar with command-line tools and disk images.

Is -shadow just broken on Catalina? Thanks. Also, can you verify if you can reproduce this issue?\n\nA: Alas, it seems that either macOS has changed the format of .shadow files in a breaking way, or that my .shadow files are corrupted (hundreds of them) without any corruption to the DMGs themselves (hundreds of them, all with checksums that match). I'm going to guess it's the first option. Nonetheless, the usage message only shows when mounting with these specific shadow files. When I create new shadow files, the disk images mount just fine.\n", "Q: Formatting an External SSD for Mac I know this seems like a basic question, but I’ve looked around online a bit and found different answers to this.

I want to make sure I get as much speed out of this drive as possible, so what would be the best way to format it? I currently use Mac OS Extended (Journaled) on my external HDD, but I’ve read around that using the APFS would be better for an external SSD. I’ll also be using a Time Machine backup drive to backup this external SSD, so I’m not sure if using the APFS system on the new SSD would interfere with the backup drive. \nIf anyone could help me with this I would really appreciate it. \n\nA: Apple recommends using APFS for SSDs. You cannot use APFS with a Time Machine Backup Drive. If you are planning on using it for two things, storing files, and Time Machine, then I would recommend partitioning the SSD and then making the one for storing your music, etc. APFS and to use Time Machine, simply go into Time Machine Preferences and then select the partition meant for Time Machine. Time Machine will automatically format the partition as HFS (macOS Extended).\n", "Q: Are there solutions to block pornography on iOS and watchOS?

The monitor came with a cable that fits in Thunderbolt but I think is called a USB3 cable. I am not averse to ordering a new cable if that's what is needed.\nCan someone help me sort this out? \n\nA: The only signal that comes out of your iMac is DisplayPort.  So, going from DisplayPort to DisplayPort is the best and most reliable connection as there’s no signal conversion.\nUSB-C is just a port type.  Thunderbolt is just a multiplexing of several signals:  PCIe, DisplayPort, USB, and power.  The cable that came with your monitor (USB-C) will support DisplayPort so, its perfect to use with your monitor; plug it into one of the two Thunderbolt 3 ports.\nConverting to HDMI will undoubtably require an active adapter.  I don’t recommend it as it adds unneeded complexity because the signal must be converted; it’s inherently a point of failure.\n", "Q: App Store on Mojave: \"We could not complete your purchase. cancelled\" Whenever I try to Get then Install any app from the App Store, I get this message:\n\nWe could not complete your purchase.  cancelled\n\nI did some searching online, but barely found any useful hits. What is this about?!\n\nA: From https://ericasadun.com/2020/05/22/broken-app-store-downloads-on-mojave-we-could-not-complete-your-purchase/:\n\n*\n\n*Quit App Store\n\n*In Terminal: open \"$TMPDIR/../C/com.apple.appstore/\"\n\n*In Finder: trash everything in that folder including any pending updates / stuck items.\n\n*In Terminal: killall -9 appstoreagent \n\n*Relaunch App Store\n\n*Done\n\nIf you feel confident with Terminal you can also quit the App Store and then run\nrm -r \"$TMPDIR/../C/com.apple.appstore/\"*\nkillall -9 appstoreagent \n\n\nA: The trash 'pending updates / stuck items' answer didn't work for me. Nor is it convenient for everyone to just upgrade to Catalina.\nWhat did work for me, was to connect to the Internet via a different network. I temporarily switched from our broadband (via our WiFi router) to 4G (via my iPhone's personal hotspot), and voila, app updates started working again.\nWondering if this could be a DNS related issue, I tried switching back to broadband and tweaking the Mac's DNS settings (System Preferences > Network > Advanced > DNS). After a few failures, I found success using 208.67.222.222 as the DNS server.\nThat doesn't explain why other perfectly good name servers (like 8.8.8.8 and 208.67.220.220) failed but life is too short for me to worry about it. If you're pulling your hair out over this issue, these things are certainly worth a try.\n\nA: I fixed the problem by opening iTunes and signing in there. As soon as I signed into iTunes with the same account as the App Store, the problem went away.\n\nA: The official Method:\n\nThe hacky tricks may work for you, but are not necessary. Use the official method with these simple steps:\n\n*\n\n*Open App Store. Sign in if you are not already signed in.\n\n\n*From Top Menu → Store: Click View My Account. \nor use Keyboard Shortcut: Command + 0.\n\n\n*Click View Information (at the Top Right of the window).\n\n\n\n*Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the Reset button. \nThen click Done.\n\n\nAs the text suggests, this will reset all the buying, downloading (for new install or update) warnings. So now you should be able to install new apps and update installed apps.\nTroubleshooting\n\nCase-1: You've tried the above method, but it doesn't work for any App at all.\n\nPossible Solution:\n\n*\n\n*Sign out of App Store\n\n*Restart your Mac.\n\n*Then try the above Official Method again.\n\n\nCase-2: You've tried the above method, but it works for some app, but it doesn't work for some other apps if you try to update.\n\nPossible Solution:\n\n*\n\n*Follow the Possible Solution from Case-1 above (Repeat all 3 steps).\n\n*Open the App Store App, Log in & from Left Sidebar go to Updates.\n\n*Click the Title of the App that was showing the warning while updating.\n\n*Then use the UPDATE button from that App's details page (in the top right corner of that page) to update the app.\n\n\n\nA: I don't know if I've solved this permanently, but I temporarily changed my dns search domain from the \"attlocal.net\" to \"localhost\", and it resolved the problem.\n\n\nA: I finally \"upgraded\" to Catalina. This resolved my problem.\nIncidentally, this also solved my other problem:\nAppleScript error: “Finder got an error: Network file permission error.”\n\nA: \"Non-answer\" answer. Try again.\nAs of 4:13PM, I am now able to download software. Probably some issue with Apple and their App Store backend. For future reference, go to their system status page to see if any of their services go down again.\n\nA: It was a temporary issue at Apple's end. They haven't given an official answer to why Mojave users couldn't download from the App Store. \nBut at least they've fixed it now!\n", "Q: Charging Earbuds Charging Case 5V DC (USB C) with 96W Apple Macbook Charger? Today I connected my 96W Macbook Pro Charger to my Mpow M9 Wireless Earbuds Charging Case (purchased a week ago) which also has Type C charging port. Within few seconds of connecting, smoke started coming out of the charging case. I quickly unplugged the cable but it was too late. The charging case is now non-functional and ear buds are of no use.\nWas I being stupid of connecting this charger to this device which states that it should be connected to 5V charger? Instead, should the charging case adapt to the different charger despite it being a lot higher watts/volts than required?\n\nA: \nWas I being stupid of connecting this charger to this device which states that it should be connected to 5V charger?\n\nTechnically, no, you were not bring stupid.\nThe charging capacity of the charger can be larger than the device so long as the device conforms to the charging specifications.\nIs the Macbook 12 inch's USB-C charger interchangeable with other USB-C chargers or devices?\n\nWithin few seconds of connecting, steam started coming out of the charging case. \n\nThat’s not steam.  It’s the “magic smoke” and you let it out.  In all seriousness, the case got burnt to a crisp.\nNow, if the charger is USB-C, one would assume that it’s compatible with other USB-C type chargers that conform to the USB PD (Power Delivery) specification.  It sounds like this device doesn’t.  Reading the user manual, it doesn’t list USB-C PD, but refer to it as a “Type C charging port” (page 3). It also lists the charger as a “5V output charger” (page 12) with no reference to USB.\nThis is very misleading because it makes you believe you can use a USB-C charger with this device. In fact, you can only use a charger that only outputs 5 volts, it’s not clear if it’s a bona fide USB charger that’s being used.\nIMO, this is a horrible design.  They should have used either a USB mini port or USB-C that conformed to the Power Delivery specification.\nNow, the USB Power Delivery specification has four normative voltages: 5V, 9V, 15V, and 20V.  The charging device will negotiate with the charger as to how much voltage to deliver.  By default, it supplies 5V.  So, it should work.  Since it got fried, this is clearly a case of a faulty design or manufacturing defect of the charging case.\n", "Q: iMovie on Macbook download fail: \"We could not complete your purchase.\" What could I do?

When typing in a terminal, why is it that text does not behave the way it would in any other text environment, like in any text editor or browser? Things like highlighting text while moving the cursor using typical key bindings (Meta+Shift+Arrow Key) and simply just deleting the current highlighted text by pressing backspace are not possible.\nIs this behavior necessary for a terminal to stay compatible or caused by some restriction that I am not thinking of? Sorry if this is a dumb question. Thank you.\n\nA: The terminal does not behave the way that you expect because it is made to emulate the behavior of a DEC VT100 terminal. Computer terminals — such as the VT100 — did not have a mouse, so any actions that is triggered by the mouse is bolted on as an afterthought. Most terminal emulators default to a set of keybindings that are similar to those of Emacs (a text editor), but this layer (provided by GNU Readline) does not provide mechanisms for selecting text and whatever else you are describing.\nIt is up to the terminal emulator (for example, Terminal.app or iTerm2) to define what events are triggered upon mouse clicks and text selection. For example, hitting Option ⌥, followed by a mouse click somewhere in your current prompt will place your cursor at that position. If you select a piece of text and hit backspace Delete ⌦, only a single character at your current cursor position will be deleted because the terminal that is being emulated does not have the notion of text selection by itself.\n\nA: The Unix terminal application is based on what a physical terminal could do.  \nA common earlier terminal.\n\nDEC_VT100 -- Could output 30 characters per second.

The problem is when I copy a file to the directory on the linux box (ipad then some subdirectory) they are not visible on the ipad itself. It is as if the ipad doesn't have the same directory tree. Yet I can click on the file in nautilus and it is quite obvious the file is on the ipad. \nDo I have to root the ipad to see a real file tree structure?\n\nA: I installed the app shellfish. This let me ssh from the ipad into the linux box. I couldn't figure out the IP address of the network (via usb). I installed the app VLC and it identified the IP address of the ipad. From that point, I could nmap on the linux box to find the IP address of the linux box. I cannot ssh into the ipad. nmap verifies that the port is not open. But as I said the I can ssh in the direction from the ipad to the linux box. This did require setting up sshd on the linux box.I suppose now that I have addresses I could set up samba but ssh/sftp is fine. Probably more secure.

Partition failed with the error -69760: Unable to write to the last block of the device. Exfat only? Repairable? Update 1: Somehow, after unconnecting and re-connecting, the original disk (disk1) has now returned to original state, with the readme file as well! I still have another disk which is not working. When connected to my MBP I get the message, \"The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer.\" \"[Initialize | Ignore | Eject]\".\nUpdate 2: @Allan's question: Like how long from when you bought the drives and were working to when they stopped? Answer: They were removed from the packaging on the day they arrived. These are brand new. They both worked out of the box. Issues started after attempting to partition and attempting to restore via Image.\nUpdate 3: The disk currently does not work on Mac or Windows. Next steps from here?\nTL;DR:\nI ordered two external hard disks and tried them on the first day they arrived. They appeared to work as a normal external hard drive when I first connected them to my MBP (Retina mid-2015, Yosemite 10.10.3). However, after trying to partition/restore via Disk Utility, they become both unusable. NB. One of them returned to original state — please see Update 1, 2 and 3 above. So please also see my attempts at a solution in my answer to this question as advised by @bmike\nIf these types of 2.5\" external hard disks are actually not compatible with Macs or Time-Machine backups:\nA) What can I do to return the disk back to its original usable/exfat state?\n B) In their original Exfat state, to what extent will they be usable?\nC) Why are they limited to Exfat format?\nD) How, without the seller telling me, can I know these are limited to Exfat format only? e.g. Are certain cheap 2.5\" external HDDs from China always limited to Exfat?\n \nQuick Intro:\nI first tried to partition one of them. This made it unusable. After attempting to restore the first one by copying/cloning an image from the second one, the second became unusable. Then somehow the first disk randomly became usable again and was back to its original state (it even contained the original readme file). \nContext:\nI want to do a Time Machine backup to an external hard disk so I bought two 2.5” 2TB external hard disks.\nThe hard disks (both identical) were described as compatible with macOS, both on packaging and on the online description. I connected one of them for the first time and all looked normal. The only exception is that I found a readme file, which mentioned this drive can only be formatted to Exfat.\nSo my conclusion is that the drive is officially in NTFS format, while the readme file says it's Exfat only and the online description and packaging say's it's compatible with Macs. I contacted the seller, who replying saying that it doesn’t work with PS4 and is compatible with Windows, Mac, Xbox and Linux. \nSo after attempting to partition 1.1GB for Time Machine, Disk Utility gave me the message “Unable to write to last block of device”. In an attempt to salvage the first disk, I wanted to basically copy/clone the second external drive in its original format and burn it onto the first one that no longer shows a volume. I plugged in the second disk and tried to use the ‘Restore’ function via the Restore tab and clicked on the ‘Image…’ button. I then got a message saying:\n\"Unable to create “JMicron Generic Media1.dmg.” (Input/output error).\"\nThe first screen shot is what the hard drive first looked like when connected to my MBP. The second shows what it's like after it became unusable. Below that are screen shots in chronological order, whilst attempting @Allan's suggestion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: As per @bmike's suggestion. I'm putting my attempts at solutions in this answer to avoid repeatedly bumping the comments section and to clean up the original question.\nAs per @Allan's advice I formatted the drive to Exfat on Windows, although the \"format did not complete successfully\". On Disk Utility I now can see a greyed-out volume named Disk1s1. However, I still get the message, \"The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer.\" \"[Initialize | Ignore | Eject]\", when connecting to my MBP. Moreover, the 'First Aid' option in Disk Utility is greyed out.\nNow, diskutil list command result gives a volume type of DOS_FAT_16. Compare this with the previous results that shows the original (working) and previous (unusable) states. \nThe disk currently does not work on Mac or Windows.\nNext steps from here?\n--\nCurrently the disk is unusable but with greyed-out disk1s1 in disk utility. /dev/disk1 gives:\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk1\n   1:                 DOS_FAT_16                         2.0 TB     disk1s1\n\nsudo gpt -r -v show disk1 gives:\ngpt show: disk1: mediasize=2000398934016; sectorsize=512; blocks=3907029168\ngpt show: unable to open device 'disk1': Input/output error\n\nsudo diskutil verifyDisk /dev/disk1 gives:\nUnable to verify this whole disk: A GUID Partition Table (GPT) partitioning scheme is required (-69773)\n\ndiskutil info /dev/disk1 gives the following:\n   Device Identifier:        disk1\n   Device Node:              /dev/disk1\n   Part of Whole:            disk1\n   Device / Media Name:      JMicron Generic Media\n\n   Volume Name:              Not applicable (no file system)\n\n   Mounted:                  Not applicable (no file system)\n\n   File System:              None\n\n   Content (IOContent):      FDisk_partition_scheme [PREVIOUSLY THIS WAS \"NONE\"]\n   OS Can Be Installed:      No\n   Media Type:               Generic\n   Protocol:                 USB\n   SMART Status:             Not Supported\n\n   Total Size:               2.0 TB (2000398934016 Bytes) (exactly 3907029168 512-Byte-Units)\n   Volume Free Space:        Not applicable (no file system)\n   Device Block Size:        512 Bytes\n\n   Read-Only Media:          No\n   Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (no file system)\n   Ejectable:                Yes\n\n   Whole:                    Yes\n   Internal:                 No\n   OS 9 Drivers:             No\n   Low Level Format:         Not supported\n\nPreviously the results were:\nNonexistent, unknown, or damaged partition map scheme\nIf you are sure this disk contains a (damaged) APM, MBR, or GPT partition\nscheme, you might be able to repair it with \"diskutil repairDisk /dev/disk1\"\n\ndiskutil repairDisk /dev/disk1\nNonexistent, unknown, or damaged partition map scheme\nIf you are sure this disk contains a (damaged) APM, MBR, or GPT partition map,\nyou can hereby try to repair it enough to be recognized as a map; another\n\"diskutil repairDisk /dev/disk1\" might then be necessary for further repairs\nProceed?

Refer to the Apple Support document, About the read-only system volume in macOS Catalina\n\nmacOS Catalina runs in a read-only system volume, separate from other files on your Mac. When you upgrade to Catalina, a second volume is created, and some files may move to a Relocated Items folder. \nmacOS Catalina runs on a dedicated, read-only system volume called Macintosh HD. This volume is completely separate from all other data to help prevent the accidental overwriting of critical operating system files.

I have verified this by typing pmset -g on cmd line. Here is my question.\n\n\n*\n\n*Without having to manually stop nfsd, Is there a way to make the auto sleep function on macOS to be more aggressive. I noticed if I manually goto the  -> sleep or hit the shortcut to sleep, it's far more aggressive and goes through the process of shutting down all services and then sleeps. \n\n\nAny other ideas on how I can get this Mac to auto sleep while running nfsd? Maybe a whitelist of services to ignore while preventing sleep.\n\nA: No, you can’t make it more aggressive.  \nnfsd is the NFS server daemon and enabling it,  you’ve effective turned your Mac into a server.  Servers don’t go to sleep because you’ll “kill” services your network clients rely on.  Having this daemon prevent sleep is by design.\nIf its that important to have file sharing (NFS, SMB, iSCSI, etc.), get a NAS like a Synology Diskstation.  The “entry level” 2 disk models are affordable and extremely reliable.  This will allow you remove your Mac from doing double duty as your daily driver and as a workgroup file server.  It even has power saving settings that will allow it to spin down the drives and even go to sleep after a period of inactivity.\n", "Q: USB-C cable for MacBook Pro 2019 16\" - fully supported charging cables? I can see this question has been broached before but I want to clarify if anything has changed with the MBP 16\", which is a 96w device.\nDoes this have any special additional standards / features that are required in the usb-c to usb-c cable?\nI wanted to get a second backup cable. I am a big fan of Anker so I was thinking I would get theirs over the official cable. However, both Anker and Apple seem to be coy about fully supporting the MBP 2019 16\".\nFor example, on the official Anker website the product listing doesn't mention the MBP 16\" outright, and seems like it doesn't fully support it:\n\nAnd even the official Apple store listing stops short of declaring support:\n\nIt's about six months since the MBP 16\" came out. \nIs everyone just behind updating their listings, or is it some special tech in there that is going to need a faster rated cable of some kind?\nUpdate - Apple's Recommendation\nIt seems that Apple has a page which says you do in fact need the correct usb-c cable to get the 100w charging:\n\nFor the best charging experience, you should use the USB-C charge cable that comes with your Mac notebook. If you use a higher wattage USB-C cable, your Mac will still charge normally. USB-C cables rated for 29W or 30W will work with any USB-C power adapter, but won't provide enough power when connected to a power adapter that is more than 61W, such as the 96W USB-C Power Adapter.\n\nUpdate 2 - Thunderbolt 3\nIt also seems that USB-C is only a physical form and if you start looking at active thunderbolt 3 cables then they speak of being able to make use of the full 100w charging.\nAnker have a product which says:\n\nHigh-Speed Charging: Supports rapid charging currents of up to 100W, with a compatible charger.\n\nAnd the offical app store sells a 2m Belkin branded one which says:\n\nTake advantage of up to 100W power delivery\n\nBut as yet I have not found anybody discussing this, and if there is a real improvement, for charging, between a usb-c 3.1 cable vs an active thunderbolt 3 cable. \nThe price is certainly much higher, but is that just because it supports 40gb/s transfer instead of 10gb/s, and the high speed 100w charge is the same as a usb-c cable or is it really an improvement?\n\nA: Even if we just contain this conversation to cables with USB-C connectors on each end this is a complex subject.  There's some good information on this from Wikipedia but this can get confusing real quick.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C#Cables\nFirst let's start with power.  All cables that meet the USB-C specification must support at least 3 amps of current at 20 volts.  There are cables capable of up to 5 amps at up to 20 volts.  I am not aware of any markings on a cable to indicate the current carrying capacity.  Any cable rated for 5 amps must have an identifier chip in the connector to tell the connected devices that it is safe for the cable to carry 5 amps.  So, you might not be able to tell but the computer and power supply can.  Looking at how the computer reports the power available will tell you the ampacity of the cable.  The ampacity of a cable should be in the product description if that concerns you before you buy.\nSo, there's two power ratings of USB-C cables, 3 amps and 5 amps.  Now there's the bandwidth of the cable to consider.  There's five different rated bandwidths.  There's 480M, 5G, 10G, 20G, and fairly recently 40G.  There's typically going to be visible markings to indicate the bandwidth the cable supports.\nThe 480M cables are USB 2.0 cables with the new USB-C connector.  While they are certainly capable of data transfer they are often advertised as \"charger only\" cables.  If they have any markings on the connector it will be the same USB stylized \"trident\" as seen on other USB 2.0 cables.  Because they don't have to adhere to the stricter length limits of higher bandwidth cables they tend to come in 1, 2, and sometimes 3 meter lengths.  This makes them convenient to plug in a laptop on a desk or table and have the power brick on the floor to warm your feet.  If you are not in a hurry they can be used to connect a cell phone or hard drive to your computer to move files.\n5G and 10G cables will be limited to 1 meter in length if passive.  Active cable lengths are limited by the size of your bank account.  These are often marked with the USB trident, the stylized \"SS\" to mark their super speed support, and often a number 5 or 10 to indicate the speed.  If there's no number then it's likely only going to support 5G speeds.  Even though these cables are marked only for USB they can often support Thunderbolt at lower bandwidth.  There is no harm in experimenting if you are in need of but lacking a proper Thunderbolt cable and have only USB cables.\n20G and 40G cables will always have a number to mark it's bandwidth next to the \"SS\" and trident.  Passive cables will be less than a meter long, and because they are functionally identical to Thunderbolt cables they will likely have Thunderbolt markings too.  Active cables can be longer, again limited by how much you are willing to spend.  Take care when buying active cables that advertise 20G and 40G speeds if USB speeds concern you.  These cables may support only Thunderbolt at these speeds, not USB.  The USB speeds might be only 480M. If there are active USB cables that support more than 10G then I have not seen them.\nThe bandwidth of the cable says nothing about the ampacity of the cable.  To keep things simple for myself I only buy long (2 or 3 meter) 5 amp 480M cables, 1 meter 3 amp 10G cables, and short (anything under 1 meter) Thunderbolt cables.  These are easy to identify at a glance, are all passive (and therefore inexpensive).  If I find a need for something outside those three kinds of cables then I'll try to buy one that's a unique color to keep it separate in my mind.\n\nA: A USB-C cable is a USB-C cable.  Period.  Full stop.\nIt’s not going to be different for each different device.  The marketing  material that you’re seeing is for SEO or search engine optimization.  There’s no compatibility differences.\nThe USB-C port on your MacBook Pro 16” isn’t any different from the USB-C ports on any of those Mac laptops in the “specification page.”   Any cable with the the USB-C logo on it must support 10Gb/s transfer rate and support up to 100 watts of power.  Since the highest capacity charger Apple makes is 96W, any USB-C cable will work.\nThis is why you buy from reputable brands like Anker.  In order to put the USB logo on their products, they must pay the licensing fee and have the product tested that it meets the standards.  Yes, they cost more, but you can be assured they meet all the specifications.\nAre there USB-C charge only cables or cables that don’t support alternate mode video or some other USB standard?  Yes, there are.  None will be USB “certified.”\n", "Q: How to stop TextEdit.app from adding extended attributes I only recently discovered (yes, I'm late to the game) that TextEdit.app is adding extended attributes to any files I open in it.  I had discovered this when I randomly had opened a shell script in it and it got quarantined and wouldn't run.\nI quickly learned that I can remove attributes with either xattr -c file or individual attributes with xattr -d attrname file, but doing that is tedious/tiresome.  I happen to like TextEdit (which I'm aware is in disfavor among pros).  I have other editors for editing code, so I’m not looking for alternate editor suggestions. What I’d like to know is, is there a way to get it to stop adding extended attributes to files?\nI tried defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool false, but it still happens.\nOr maybe I'm being too fastidious?  Other than the quarantine attribute, can any of the other cruft get in the way of other users on non-macOS systems, say when in a github repo or otherwise deployed to other systems?\nMy main concerns are first: getting a quarantine flag that was opened for a quick/simple edit, and second: edits to text files (like README.txt) that are included in a social coding repository (like github).  My desire to avoid extended attributes is the same as the reason I remove .DS_Store files before I commit changes to a repo - they are system-specific and are otherwise useless (or possibly obstacles?) to others.  TextEdit is for editing text.  Scripts and READMEs are text files.  I also use it for all sorts of other text files which I process on the command line, like fasta and fastq files.  TextEdit (while it definitely lacks features other editors have) has useful features that other editors do not have or do not do well, and I've been using it since the beginning and will continue to use it despite the alternative preference or opinions of others.  It has only become a problem the other day, when for some reason, I was unable to run a script that I had run and then opened in TextEdit to make a very minor change, and then found I couldn't run it again.\nBut perhaps I'm wrong about my main concern?  Perhaps it wasn't even TextEdit that added the quarantine attribute, because I've been unable to reproduce that issue.  So does TextEdit ever add the quarantine attribute, and if so, when?\nI wrote an automator service I can use to remove attributes on selected files, but if there's a way to change TextEdit's behavior, that would be preferable.  Otherwise, I'll probably also add an xattr command to my checkin wrapper.\n\nA: TextEdit should not (and does not) normally add quarantine attributes to files that it saves. It's possible that MacOS is adding the quarantine for some other reason. (Where are you saving to?)\nHowever, there are other extended attributes, which TextEdit may add during the course of normal operation in MacOS.\nNormally, extended attributed don't get copied to things like github, and are simply unused by other platforms, even if present.\nI also agree with bmike. If an app has a behaviour you don't like, then use another app.\n\nA: Apple has acknowledged this is a problem they are working on with Monterey.  Aside from using another editor, a not-very-satisfactory workaround is a wrapper script:\nopen -e -W $1\nxattr -c $1\n\nUnfortunately,\n\n*\n\n*it won't execute the cleanup line until you quit TextEdit (closing all open documents).\n\n*It won't work double-clicking on a document\n\n*You can't change the default opener to a script in the GetInfo window.\n\nUPDATE: It looks like it is fixed in 12.3.  However,\n\n*\n\n*It was not mentioned in the release notes\n\n*The AppleCare contact for my case has not bothered to follow up\n\n*the bug report is still open\n\n\nA: Yes - I think you’re being too fastidious. I would stop TextEdit from altering a file by stopping opening it in TextEdit if you’re sure that’s the culprit. We don’t have any such issue at my work across mac admins and developers, so perhaps a reproducible test case will help us help you. \nI understand this may be controversial to say don’t change the app - change your process, but my answer to this dilemma is don’t have the dilemma in the first place. Embrace TE for what it is, not what you want it to be.\nI would be quite surprised to not fins domething else in your workflow is better suited to fix whatever dilemma your file attributes cause you (which isn’t entirely clear to me based on your initial version of the question).\nTo go further, I use this quarantine bit (and all the other metadata that apps like TE attach to files) as a feature and not a bug or something to be avoided. \nIf TextEdit is causing you grief, I would recommend the free BBEdit and VSCode apps so you can test editors that are more powerful - both have command line integration so you can set them as your editor or open files easily and then you can also change the launch services to open files in these apps as your preference changes only using Text Edit for when you want what it does.\nI use the quarantine attribute intentionally when I want to deliver something and know my recipients of a file/script chose to run the script / prevent tampering in flight, etc...\nBBEdit is on the Mac app store as well if you prefer that over direct download, Code is not.\nAs pointed out in the comments, the true solution here is to level up handling metadata and not let metadata and filesystem attributes ruin your day. \n", "Q: How can I paste a screenshot image from clipboard into a folder? My screenshots go directly to my clipboard, which works for me most of the time, so I'm not trying to change that behavior. \nWhat I want to do is paste said screenshot into a folder of my choosing.\nFinder doesn't seem to let me paste my screenshots from my clipboard into folders, so now I'm looking for a workaround that uses as few steps as possible. \nThe suboptimal Approach: I've found that I can open these images from my clipboard in Preview, but then I have to re-save them to a desired folder, which is too cumbersome to be considered a solution.\nWhat I'm looking for: Something with fewer steps than the above approach. I just need to get the image from my clipboard into a folder of my choosing. If you can do better, you'll save me and others a lot of time.\n\nA: Edit/Re-Write # 2:\nMy earlier answers were wrong, and while troubleshooting, new (and likely better) answers have been posted. Nevertheless, I've finally got a correct answer, so I'm going to post it. I've tested it with screenshots on  my 10.15.4 system, and it worked reliably in my (limited) testing. As there were already answers to this question that required only minor adaptation, I relied heavily upon them - this one, and  this one in particular, both posted by @CJK. \nThis answer requires use of the command line. It uses only resources that are native to macOS 10.15.4, and there are no work-arounds offered. Here's what I did: \nStart the Terminal app, and then from the shell (zsh) prompt (%) start the editor of your choice to open the ~/.zshrc file in your \"home\" ($HOME) directory. I've used nano here:\n% nano ~/.zshrc\n\nWhen the editor opens, you may have only an empty file - that's fine. If there is something in the file, just move the insertion point to the end of the file, then copy and paste the following text into the editor: \nfunction pss () {\n    folder=$(pwd)\n    filename=\"Screen Shot $(date +%Y-%m-%d\\ at\\ %H.%M.%S).png\"\n\n    if [ $# -ne 0 ]; then\n        if [[ -d $1 ]]; then\n            if [ \"$1\" != \".\" ]; then folder=$1; fi\n        else\n            a=$(dirname \"$1\")\n            b=$(basename \"$1\" .png)\n\n            if [ \"$b\" != \"\" ]; then filename=$b.png; fi\n\n            if [ \"$a\" != \".\" ]; then folder=$a; fi\n        fi\n    fi\n\n    osascript -e \"tell application \\\"System Events\\\" to ¬\n            write (the clipboard as «class PNGf») to ¬\n            (make new file at folder \\\"$folder\\\" ¬\n            with properties {name:\\\"$filename\\\"})\"\n}\n\nSave the file, and exit the editor. You have now created a shell function named pss (for paste screen shot).\nBefore you can use this shell function, you'll need to source this change to zsh (a logout/login, or reboot will accomplish the same thing, but this is easier): \n% . ~/.zshrc\n# OR, ALTERNATIVELY:\n% exec zsh\n\nTake a screenshot as you've configured it now - with the output going to the clipboard. \nFinally, use the pss function to copy/save the screenshot to the a file in your desired location: \n% pss /Users/yourid/yourfolder\n\nA couple of notes: \n\n\n*\n\n*The filename has been set in the pss function to approximate the default filename used by the system for screenshots. If you wish to change that, modify the following line: \n\n\nfilename=\"Screen Shot $(date +%Y-%m-%d\\ at\\ %H.%M.%S).png\"\n\n\n\n*You do not need to always specify the folder location. If you cd to the directory in which you wish to save your screenshot files, you can simply run the pss function without an argument. For example, you wish to save your screenshot files to /Home/user/screenshots: \n\n\n% cd /Home/user/screenshots\n# make your screenshot\n% pss\n# the screenshot file is created in this (the `pwd`) directory\n\n\nA: I created an automator workflow to solve this problem \nBottom line: the solution allows you to save an image from the clipboard anywhere with one keystroke (you have to show it where to go in the save dialogue, obviously)\nThe workflow opens preview, creates a new file from the clipboard, and saves the file (opening the save as dialogue). You can then put it wherever you want. Here's the link to a zip with the workflow. To run the workflow, you'll probably need to approve automator with certain permissions (it'll pop up if and ask for approval, so don't worry if you don't run into this problem). Open the zip, then double click the file (make sure there's an image in the clipboard). A new file should open in preview and ask to be saved.\nTo create a shortcut, just go to 'keyboard' under system preferences > 'shortcuts' > 'services' and setup the shortcut.\n\nA: On occasion, I too have graphic image data from a screen shot on the clipboard and have used a very stripped down version of the example AppleScript code shown further below to write it to a disk file. However, I've rewritten it so all you have to do is set the value for two variables, read the comments in the code, then save the script using Script Editor. Then you can trigger it from a keyboard shortcut using an app like FastScripts or similar.\nThis way you do not need to give every application that has focus separate permission to run it, like you would if you used an Automator Service/QuickAction set to any application. (Or you could just set it to one application, e.g. Finder and then only trigger it from there.)\nFastScripts is free for up to 10 keyboard shortcuts. Note that I'm not affiliated with the developer of this product, just a satisfied user.\nSave the following example AppleScript code as a script named e.g. Write Clipboard Graphic Image Data to File, then assign it a keyboard shortcut in FastScripts, I used ⇧⌘6, and start using it. Note that you can also use it in a Run Shell Script action in an Automator Service/QuickAction if you want to, but FastScripts is the way to go.\nIf you want to hard code a location, instead of a choose folder dialog, just let me know and I can change the code.\nWhat this example AppleScript code does:\n\n\n*\n\n*Checks the clipboard to see if it contains graphic image data and if not informs the user.\n\n*If the clipboard does contain graphic image data a choose folder dialog opens.\n\n*Choose the location to save the graphic image data from the clipboard to file, and it does, unless you do not have write permission to that location, you are warned and then choose again.\n\n*The naming convention is, e.g.: Screen Shot 2020-05-21 at 9.34.29 PM.png\n\n\nExample AppleScript code:\n--  #\n--      ### Write Clipboard Graphic Image Data to File ###\n--  #\n--  # This example AppleScript code will write graphic image data in its normal form on the clipboard to disk file.\n--  # All you need to do is set the value of the fileExtension variable to the type of graphic image file you want.\n--  # Then when the script runs, a choose folder dialog box will appear, you select a location and click the Choose button.\n--  # The graphic image data in its normal form on the clipboard is written to disk file with the following naming convention:\n--  # 'Screen Shot 2020-05-21 at 9.34.29 PM.fileExtension' e.g. 'Screen Shot 2020-05-21 at 9.34.29 PM.png'\n\n\n\n--  # Set the value of the fileExtension variable \n--  # to the type of graphic image file you want.\n--  # \n--  # Valid values are: png, jpg, tiff, gif\n\nset fileExtension to \"png\"\n\n--  # The defaultChooseFolderLocation is the default\n--  # location the choose folder dialog opens to.\n--  # It can be any properly formed AppleScript \n--  # 'path to (folder)', or use a fully qualified POSIX path.\n\nset defaultChooseFolderLocation to path to (pictures folder)\n\n\n--  ########################################\n--  ##

Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n\nA: I combined user3439894's approach with Automator.

Many thanks everyone\n", "Q: How to add Screen Recording permission to Google Chrome in Catalina? Please note: this question is very similar to this one and others, but none of them involve giving Google Chrome access to the Screen Recording permission! The link above is for giving Slack permission, but that is not what I'm trying to do, and as you'll see by my screenshot below, Catalina is behaving especially strange in the case of Chrome. Please do not DV/CV as a dupe!\n\nMac OS Catalina 10.15.3 here. In Chrome I am joining a Google Meet video conference and cannot present my screen because Chrome doesn't have screen recording permission. The generally accepted solution is to go to System Preferences >> Security >> Privacy and allow Chrome to have Screen Recording permissions as indicated by the following screenshot:\n\nHowever when I go to System Preferences >> Security >> Privacy, all I see is:\n\nWhich indicates only my Slack app has screen recording privileges. I need to add Google Chrome to this list, but I can't figure out how to do that! I do not see where I can search for apps to add to the Screen Recording permissions list. Any ideas?\nIf I try to present my screen from inside an existing Google Meet meeting, I get a warning that I need to give my camera permission, and I am given a link to go into System Preferences and change permissions. However when I click the link, again, only Slack is available as an option.\n\nA: It looks like as long as an app does not try to capture or record the screen, the app cannot be manually added to the \"Screen Recording\" list. For other permission types such as Full Disk Access, I have successfully dragged and dropped an application to add to the list. \nIn that case, you can open Google Chrome, visit this site and click the \"Get Started\" button. I have tried it on MacOS Catalina 10.15.4 with Google Chrome 83.0.4103.61 (Official Build) (64-bit), and it worked. After pressing the \"Get Started\" button, Chrome requested permission to record screen, and then afterwards, I could go to settings->Security & Privacy and then grant permission for Screen Recording. \nDuring my test, I already had the Security & Privacy window open, and already clicked the Lock icon to make changes and entered my password. \nAfterwards, I have tested with Google meetings and confirmed that I can share my screen. I have also confirmed that when I deselect Chrome from the Screen Recording list, I can't share the screen.\nHope that works for you, too. \n\nA: I was having the same issue and found this thread that recommended opening Google meet in an incognito window. For some reason, the incognito window was successful in requesting the correct permission when a regular window was not ‍♀️\n\nA: I found that when Google Chrome attempted to request the Screen Recording permission, the corresponding system dialog opened in the background, and it was only some time later after closing several windows that I noticed it (I already had system preferences open at the time).\nAfter trying to use Screen Recording in Chrome, if you don't see a dialog, try:\nCtrl(^)-click System Preferences > Show all windows\nOn the dialog, select 'System Preferences' and this should add Google Chrome to the list.\n\nA: It could be that you just need to insert your password by clicking on the lock in the bottom left (click the lock to make changes). This will make Chrome available to be added in the list of allowed apps.\n\nA: As I commented to your question, I faced this issue, Try to quit & re-open the Chrome intermediately after popup is shown\n\nA: What @dotrinh and @todo said in the question comments works!\nAccessed Google Hangouts, tried to screen share the whole display, got the Mac dialog box before selecting to open System Preferences, I hit Cmd+Q to quit Chrome. Then when selecting open System Preferences, Google Chrome was (weirdly) there.\n", "Q: Microsoft Teams Camera Shows Black Screen Having tried a Mac Mini and MacBook Pro, Microsoft Teams shows a black screen in the video preview during calls.

How to revert / cancel update? Since security update 2020-002, I'm having lots of trouble with a macbook pro early 2015 running high sierra  \nThe computer freezes all the time  \nFrom what i read, this update causes problems when the graphics are solicited a little more than standard  which is my case as I have 24\" external monitor always plugged to the computer (hdmi) and i use software such as illustrator and indesign on a daily basis  \nIs there any way to revert/cancel updates on mac os ?\nIf it is not possible, my only option would be to get Catalina.\nIn case something goes wrong with Catalina, i would like to know how to get installers for Mojave and/or High Sierra (i don't 'purchase' mac os versions so i don't have them on my App Store purchased tab)\nIs there a direct link to the dmg install files ? \nThanks\n\nA: Rollback procedure\nThe only way I found to be able to fight bad OS updates, and to revert an OS update is the following procedure. It is a procedure to have in place before any\nupdate and at the same time it is a heavy and pretty good backup policy.\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy a dedicated disk for this backup and rollback policy, twice the capacity of the disk of the Mac you want to protect.\n\n*Make a full bootable backup of your OS with Carbon Copy Cloner (you can try it for free to make your own opinion about the quality of this software).\n\n*Once this backup is complete, test it by booting your Mac on it and check everything is OK (your vital applications at least).\n\n*Reboot your Mac on its internal disk and make a log file to track which versions of your OS you backud up correctly. For example I use a basic text file I maintain with vi (and rcs):\nbackup disk name        version of the OS saved        date of backup\n\n\n*Make the update that App Store proposed you and check everything is OK (your vital applications at least).\n\n*If this update is OK, just continue with it: end of the backup procedure.\nElse, make a rollback of your previous version saved on your backup disk with Carbon Copy Cloner.\nPractical time spent on this procedure\n\n\n*\n\n*one hour for backup CCC,\n\n*half an hour for checking the backup,\n\n*one hour for MacOS update,\n\n*2 full days for testing the new MacOS version,\n\n*one hour for rollback CCC if the new MacOS is ill behaving,\ntotal:   2.5 days (essentially testing a fresh new MacOS version).\nPractical time saved with this procedure\nbetween 1 day and 3 years, depending on the time Apple will take to fix a misbehaving version of MacOS.\n\nA: There's no way to roll back a system update once it's applied.  The only way would be to restore from a Time Machine backup.  There is a caveat, if you were using APFS file system, you could take snapshot prior to the update and if you had problems, roll them back to your known working state.  \nAs for where to get installers, this question has been asked/answered several times here on Ask Different:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I download an older version of OS X/macOS?\n\n*How do I download macOS High Sierra for offline install?\n\n*How to download macOS High Sierra from the Mojave App Store?\nThere's also a page on Apple Support, How to upgrade to macOS Catalina that describes in detail how to get older versions like Mojave, High Sierra, and even El Capitan (bottom of page).\n\nA: Here is a tested procedure to roll back to High Sierra 10.13.6:\nHow do I download macOS High Sierra for offline install?\nI used the Greg Neagle's Python script and was able:\n\n\n*\n\n*to download an\ninstaller of High Sierra 10.13.6,\n\n*build from the downloaded installer an USB standalone installer\non an iMac mid 2011,\n\n*and finally install it.\n\n\nAll in all: 2.5 hours + 8 GB on an USB key.\nRecommandation: I advise to make this download + build + install on an external disk first,\nfor example one containing a Carbon Copy Cloner clone of the actual running internal disk.\n", "Q: Mac won’t get connected to internet even it has signal My MacBook Air 2018 won’t connect to the internet even I’m using the same WiFi net on all my other devices and they work well.\nIt started after I deleted some daemon files that were signaled as malware. \nBefore that everything worked fine and I’ve already tried everything like changing dns, Ipv-6, restarting the computer.\nPlease help I don’t Know what to do anymore \n\nA: Final solved the issue after tweaking every possible setup in my Mac.

I created a login for my housemate on my MacBook.\nI have since learned that they have installed cracked software.\nHow well am I insulated by macOS security architecture against this breach?\n\nA: If you didn’t give the guest admin privileges, you’re pretty well protected.\nThere’s a basic rule when it comes to privileges - what one admin can do, another can (un)do.  This means that if you gave your house mate admin privileges, you gave him/her the same rights you have to modify the system.\nSo, let’s assume the worst case and say you did give him admin privileges.  “Cracked” software doesn’t automatically mean malware is attached.  But, again assuming the worst, whatever malware installed was done do with (worst case again) root privileges.  \nWhile SIP, Gatekeeper, and Catalina’s new read-only system volume do a considerably good job protecting your system, you can still do some critical damage.  Worse, you could have a keylogger installed that captures login credentials, personal info, and everything required to steal your identity and drain your bank account.\nStart with Malwarebytes and scan your Mac for threats.  Personally, I would always have that nagging feeling that it's quite not cleaned.  For me, only a full erase of the drive and only a clean reinstall would give me piece of mind.\nThis again is if you gave him admin access.  If you didn’t, pat yourself on the back for not doing so, delete the account completely and don’t allow him back on your machine.\n", "Q: Guide to the output of the builtin airport command line utility I am trying to understand the output of the airport command line utility on OSX:\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I\n     agrCtlRSSI: -45\n     agrExtRSSI: 0\n    agrCtlNoise: -95\n    agrExtNoise: 0\n          state: running\n        op mode: station \n     lastTxRate: 585\n        maxRate: 867\nlastAssocStatus: 0\n    802.11 auth: open\n      link auth: wpa2-psk\n          BSSID: xx:xx\n           SSID: xx\n            MCS: 7\n        channel: 44,80\n\nWhile I'd to love how to understand all of the output above, most specifically, I am trying to figure out if there is any way to programmatically get the \"Link Speed\" as shown in the Network Utility program:  \n\n\nA: There’s not much documentation available, but these are the basics:\n\n\n*\n\n*agrCtlRSSI - Signal strength.

It reset to like an old version of Windows Home, something I didn't have on any ISO when I made the partition in bootcamp.

The problem sounds like the USB controller on the adapter doesn’t handle sleep well (or at least waking from sleep).  This isn’t something that you can fix in macOS (or even should) as it’s an issue with the USB adapter itself - not a software configuration thing.\nHowever, looking at your configuration, I would recommend you getting a dock instead of having multiple adapters (see this answer to a similar situation).

I've read about iOS randomizing MAC address when the phone is scanning for networks.\nDoes that meant that the MAC address of the iPhone's personal hotspot will also show up different to a third party app running on a different machine, scanning for local WLAN networks every time the iPhone hotspot is stopped and restarted?\n\nA: Since iOS 8, Apple has implemented MAC address randomization as a security measure against tracking.  It will will generate a random MAC address when\n\n\n*\n\n*responding to a probe request (another node is scanning)\n\n*sending a probe request (the iDevice is scanning)\n\n\nHowever, when joined, it will use it’s own real MAC address.\nBasically, users can be tracked when the iPhone responds to a management packet that’s broadcast.  The device (not limited to iPhones/iPads) will respond back with a response packet that includes the MAC address of the device.  Companies will log this device when it responds and track your movements.  Apple, randomizes the MAC address so that what that entity logs is mostly useless.

Everything worked good.\nThen I bought this new monitor that has more options such as blue screen filter, change contrast etc etc (https://www.bhphotovideo.com/lit_files/152620.pdf).  Following what I had done before I connected the two but discovered I am missing the full display option to change this blue light filter and others.  Google didn't give me an answer so I called the tech department of the store and they said this (https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/insignia-insignia-mini-displayport-to-hdmi-adapter-ns-pd94592-c-ns-pd94592-c/10294299) is the magic solution to everything? \nIs this true?  I know next to nothing about DP and HDMI and my question is as I only have 1 thunderbold if I buy this adapter does it mean there is no need then for my current thunderbolt to DP cable?\nIf what the store employee said is true would someone be so kind to link/explain why this would solve my problem, and if not what is the solution to my problem.\nThank you and have a great day :) \n\nA: Your cable has nothing to do with the features of the monitor.   What the store employee told you was utter nonsense.  \nIt simply can’t influence the OSD functionality of the monitor as there’s no logic in a cable that will enable it.  What does influence the OSD is the “mode” that the display is in and that’s dependent on how you have things configured.\nIn fact, speaking of configurations, the (cable) configuration you had previously, going from mini DisplayPort to Display port (mDP to DP) was better than going from mDP to HDMI as there’s no conversion of the signal.  You’ll get a more stable and reliable connection.\nThat aside, the monitor’s features are dependent on what “mode” you have it in.\nFor instance on page 3-2 it states the following:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*In the Racing Mode, the Saturation, SkinTone, Sharpness, and ASCR functions are not user-configurable.\n  \n*In the sRGB, the Saturation, Color Temp., SkinTone, Sharpness, Brightness, Contrast and ASCR functions are not user-configurable.\n  \n\nThen on page 3-3 specifically about the Blue Light Filter it states\n\nWhen Blue Light Filter is activated,the default settings of Racing Mode will be automatically imported.\n\nBased on what you’re describing, that “blue light filter” may be one of the options that get disabled when selecting a certain mode.\n", "Q: iPhone 11 with Exchange accounts does not have the \"Never\" option under \"Auto-Lock\" I bought a new iPhone 11 and restored the backup from my iPhone 6.\nIt's great except for this issue; I can't get a longer auto-lock than 5 minutes.\nI spoke to an Apple support rep and we worked out it's something to do with the exchange accounts I have set up on it.\nI have one Office360 exchange account and 6 AWS exchange accounts, all used for email only.\nIf I disable the AWS exchange accounts, for some reason I get the \"Never\" option back. The Office360 account doesn't affect anything.\nHowever we weren't able to work out much beyond this.\nWhy could this be?\n\nA: I logged into my AWS WorkMail dashboard and noticed that there is a \"Mobile policies\" menu item.\nWhen I chose this, one of the policy options was \"Enable screen lock\" with a value of 300 seconds - or 5 minutes, co-incidentally the maximum value in the iPhone's Auto-Lock drop-down.\nAfter I disabled this and cycled the exchange accounts on the iPhone, the \"Never\" option re-appeared.\n", "Q: Stop any syncing with other apple devices with same Apple ID and MacBook How to stop at all any syncing on new MacBook with another devices with same Apple ID? I want to use Apple ID on MacBook only for App Store.\n\nA: Syncing happens in the system settings, iCloud. If you sign out there, you stop syncing. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208242\nYou can stay signed in to the App Store and not sign in to iCloud as well, just skip the full setup when you set up your account - choose set up later if you are asked if you want to sync iCloud. \n", "Q: Bluetooth/WiFi cannot be turned off in control Center on iOS 13.4.1 I don’t know if this has been talked about in the past, but I’m new to the iPhone, so I’m not sure how this works. When I toggle the WiFi or Bluetooth off on the control Center, it shows a message that says: turning off Bluetooth WiFi communications until tomorrow. Does this mean that it’s just not turning off at all? Turning it off from the settings seems to help, but doing it from control Center simply does nothing.\n\nA: Turning it off from the control center should give you the message you mentioned, but turning it back on writes a message to the iphone Control Center Screen. Maybe when you tried it in Control Center you were turning it back on. I'd try it again from Control Center and press the bluetooth button twice to make sure you get it off and on. After pressing be sure to check the top of the Control Center screen.\n", "Q: To what degree is Siri listening? Siri must \"listen\" for commands, however, that being said if it does not receive the command prompt \"Hey Siri,\" can users rely on the algorithm to not record/send conversations or other private audio?\nIf device specificity is required for the question.  Assume an iPhone X with IOS 13.X\n\nA: The German-language TV show Quer, broadcast by BR, the Bavarian public broadcaster, aired a segment back in March (prior to Covid-19-related restrictions in Bavaria) which can be found on Youtube (the auto-translated subtitles aren’t bad in my initial impression). About 1 minute in, they team up with the Chaos Computer Club to determine whether Siri sends data while listening without the trigger words Hey, Siri being added by putting themselves between the router and the internet to record every packet of data sent.\nThe positive control (a statement initiated with Hey Siri) immediately sends out data as supposed. Later in the segment (about 3:40) they perform a negative control and see absolutely no data usage. This negative control was designed to use a couple of trigger words (holiday, flight) that show the desire to purchase a non-everyday product making the speaker an incredibly interesting target for targeted advertising – one of the main criticisms that are being voiced.\nObviously, a 5-minute segment in a 45-minute show that covers a range of topics cannot cover all relevant aspects. Most notably, they only show checking for outgoing internet connections so any recordings kept locally on the phone would slip through the cracks. Furthermore, n = 1 for both positive control and experiment as of the broadcast segment which is obviously far below statistical significance. Nonetheless, this experiment provides an indication towards a No answer: at the very least it seems like Siri is not sending private communications to the outside world.\n\nA: Your asked about the trust-worthiness of an algorithm. The answer to your question is a firm and absolute \"No\" - users can not rely on the algorithm to not record/send conversations or other private audio. Some algorithms are definitely better than others, but no algorithm is perfect - what is invented by the human mind can be defeated by the human mind. \nLet's muse over another word in your question: rely. Reliance is not a binary state of mind; it's much more subtle than that. Consider that we may rely on the mail carrier to deliver our mail each day, but as the consequence of failure is not catastrophic, we do not rely upon it heavily. OTOH, if you are a diabetic living in a remote location, your reliance on the mail carrier's delivery of your insulin has far greater implications. \nThe \"threat\" is also a factor in our reliance. Security-wise, perhaps the thing we have going for us is that nobody really cares what we say or write or do. But if we happen to attract attention to ourselves - perhaps as a suspect, or the target of a criminal enterprise, or have become involved in \"matters of national security\" as this chap recently did, then our level of reliance on algorithms - and computer security in general - becomes a different matter. And so it is with your reliance on Apple's algorithm: does the mail carrier bring you junk, or does he/she deliver insulin?\nFinally, let's consider the other variable in reliance: the quality of the algorithm. Reliance is not a binary state, and no algorithm is perfect. Nevertheless we must still consider how good it is in determining how heavily we should rely upon it. \nUnfortunately it is a practical impossibility for us to know how secure Apple's algorithm is: \n\n\n*\n\n*it's not open source - people outside Apple have to disassemble the code to inspect for flaws. They cannot read the source\n\n*even if it were open source, it wouldn't be perfect \n\n*even if it were perfect, Apple still makes mistakes\n\n*Apple could even abuse their privilege or not catch an employee that attempts this abuse\nInstead, and as a substitute for a quantitative analysis of the algorithm itself, perhaps the best we can manage is an attempt at objective assessment of some facts. Consider the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*A complete and massive failure of the algorithm would be bad for Apple's business. Consequently, it seems likely that Apple would put a serious effort into the algorithm, and safeguards for the data. \n\n*Apple has weighed up Siri's business value against the risks of failures of their algorithm, and have made the decision to retain Siri. Impose may be a better word than retain in this case as Apple has not provided an option to remove or un-install the Siri software. \nThese facts do not shed much light on the actual quality of Apple's algorithm, but they do speak to motives and motivation. We can safely conclude that Apple has reasonably strong financial incentives to design a reliable algorithm. However, it also seems safe to conclude that Apple considers our private data to be within their purview. Why else would they not provide an option for removal of Siri to accommodate their customers' preferences?\nNone of this is intended as \"Apple-bashing\". I am an Apple customer - I have spent more money than I'll ever admit on their products. But I feel it's also important to be realistic. Apple's interests do not coincide perfectly with ours. Should we rely on Apple's judgments and algorithms to protect and safeguard our security and privacy? I hope this answer has provided a little food for thought.\n\nEpilogue:\nI have just read @Bradley's answer to this question. I have to say that if the allegations leveled by Apple's contractor in Ireland over the \"Siri Incident\" are true, then Apple deserves far more than the \"Apple-bashing\" I tried to avoid in my answer. They deserve substantial fines - perhaps even criminal proceedings. It is simply unacceptable that anyone or any organization be allowed to use their wealth and influence to trample the rights of others. More to the point of answering this question, this episode (if true) speaks volumes on how we should consider relying on Apple's software.\n\nA: The answer is it is always listening.\nThe recent article in the Guardian, of the former apple contractor, demonstrates precisely why the best option for you is to disable Siri all together if you want to mitigate the risk of yourself being recorded. Equivalently, buy the cheapest non-smartphone.\nThis is not just an Apple-centric issue. Unfortunately, when you accept the terms and conditions, you are giving Apple, and other companies the right to use your data however they want. This should not be the case when you are not using an application, but many times over it is the case.\n\nA: We can only tell you what Apple publicly states.  Can you rely on it, well that's entirely up to you.  IMO, I trust Apple and Microsoft orders of magnitude more than I do Google, Facebook, Twitter, et al.  That doesn't mean I trust them implicitly, either.\nSpecific to this question, it is addressed in this press release from Apple: Improving Siri’s privacy protections.  Below is a quick summary of what's in the press release.\nHow Apple Protects your Privacy\n\n*\n\n*They try to do as much of the Siri processing on the device as possible\n\n*Any data stored on Apple servers are not used to build a marketing profile nor is it sold to anyone\n\n*Siri tries to use the least amount of private data as possible.  The example used was for general queries, they would use a general location, but for more specific and granular requests, more detail is used\n\n*Siri dictating messages is done on the device and not stored on the server\n\nChanges they are making to improve your privacy\n\n*\n\n*audio recordings to improve Siri are no longer kept, only computer transcriptions will be used to improve Siri\n\n*Siri's improvement program is opt in rather than opt out; meaning you have to affirmatively give Apple permission to use your recordings\n\n*Only Apple employees will be able to review customers recordings\n\nSo, based on this, is Siri listening?\nYes.\nAm I worried about it?\nNot worried, exactly.  I trust it, for now, but remain skeptical.  Siri is listening, but if most of what Siri does is on device, there's no need to record/process your conversation until it hears \"Hey Siri;\" and responding to that has no need to be sent to servers for initial processing.\n", "Q: Can I control an iPad with an Apple TV remote? Normally I watch TV and Movies using an Apple TV. I love being able to easily Pause and Skip Backward/Forward using the Apple TV's Siri Remote.\nBut in other places in the house I might watch on an iPad. Or even sometimes on an iPhone.\nWhen I'm watching, I often prop the iPad up on a table or otherwise out of reach. So it's inconvenient to touch the screen. In the worst case, tapping the screen might tip over the iPad. I really just want to use a remote.\nIs it possible to control an an iPad with an Apple TV Siri Remote via Bluetooth?\n\nNote: I'm not asking about controlling an Apple TV with the iOS \"Remote\" app. I want the the reverse.\n\nA: There's no way to use the remote which comes with an Apple TV to control the iPad, but you can connect an Apple or third-party bluetooth keyboard to control your iPad.\nQuoth Apple:\n\nApple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Keyboard compatibility with iOS devices\nApple Wireless Keyboard, Magic Keyboard, and many Bluetooth keyboards that use the Apple keyboard layout work with these iOS devices.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202041\nNote: In addition to Apple keyboards, many third-party Bluetooth keyboards that use the Apple keyboard layout work with iOS devices. Check with the keyboard manufacturer for additional information.\n\nAfter connecting a Bluetooth keyboard, Mac-like keyboard shortcuts will work to control video playback on the iPad. Spacebar to play/pause, arrow keys to skip forward and backward and to control the volume.\n", "Q: When I try to delete some old folders on my mac desktop I get error. I have tried some method but failed. Error is shown in description I have tried several methods in the past as well. \nWhile reflecting on root of problem initially after purchasing mac I had password set which was forgotten within week so I had to used command R feature to reset password.

When OpenVPN is up, you’ll be assigned that tunnel as the default gateway and when it’s down, it will fall back to the original settings where there isn’t one.\n", "Q: Moving user account manually Had a imac 21\" 2011 model high sierra with the nvidia gpu that had high casualty rate, could see from the death it was the gpu it's hd was 2tb.\nBought a mac mini 2012 Catalina 200gb ssd and 500gb hd,\nof cause, I can't restore the time machine backup because of the size difference.\nMy goal is to get my user back with data and keychain and the works, apps do not matter. I took apart the imac and salvaged the 2tb hd and put it in an external usb3 enclosure.\nConnected it to the mac mini and it see it and I see all my data on the external hd.\nWhat does it take to restore my user account? Can I make a dir in \\Users\\ with my user name and mount the external volume as that and then login with the user?\nI'm happy enough with keeping the data on the external hd and the os and apps on the ssd.\n\nA: You could make a different account on the Mac Mini, and if you right-click on the account you created in System Preferences you get an advanced settings pane and could set the home directory to be whatever you want - ie. it could just pick up the one on the USB drive. You'd then be using your old account just like it was before, running from the external enclosure. Be warned - if that enclosed is missing when you log in macOS will create a new one in /Users on your internal drive.\nHowever, in general, all the users settings you care about are in Library in your user's home. So, if you created a new account, and just copied Library over, you'd get the settings you care about. Then could use the docs/data on the remove drive. It wouldn't need your full drive structure - could move those docs to wherever you wanted.\n", "Q: What is WebKitDropDestination? When my scheduled backup task failed with \"out of disk space error\" I discovered that I had a massive folder at /private/var/folders/<\\w\\w>/<\\w+>/<\\W>/com.apple.Safari/WebKitDropDestination-<\\w+>/ and this folder was full of video files that really were from my Apple Photos library. Strangely, these videos .mov files (I've only checked few random ones) are still present in my Photos library. Well, some version of them anyway. This /private … folder is almost 72 GB in size, which is why my backup task croaked. So… \n\n\n*\n\n*what the heck is this WebKitDropDestination?\n\n*why does it have old videos that I have not otherwise touched or moved?\n\n\nA: DropDestination is Apple's developer terminology for the destination of a Drag action, e.g. when you drag something with the mouse from one app to another. \nWebKit is Safari's HTML rendering engine. WebKitDropDestination appears in the WebKit source code and is part of the drag and drop code. The folder is intended to be temporary.\nThere doesn't seem to be any formal documentation of the term WebKitDropDestination or other references online.\nIf you have indeed dragged a bunch of your videos onto Safari or an application that uses web views, to upload them to a site, then this is the likely explanation.\nIf you haven't done anything of the kind, then it may serve some other use. Folders of this kind usually get deleted on a restart.\n", "Q: Wiped my Macbook keyboard and trackpad with an antibacterial wipe. It's affected the cursor when there is load on the cpu. How can I fix this? I have turned the Macbook off and left it for 24 hours and turned it back on three (days) separate times. Using a USB mouse when the Macbook is turned on works well but as soon as a load is on the cpu the fluttering starts again and the computer is unusable. \nIs my only resolve to leave the macbook for weeks and hope the remaining liquid evaporates?\n\nA: Drying out is “hopefully” a good solution if it’s not coming into contact with electrical connections. However, this is rarely the case.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to log in using external keyboard on MacBook Pro\n\n*I got Lysol in my headphone jack. How should I get it out?\nThe problem with whatever cleaner you used is not the water; it’s what’s in the water and gets left behind after it dries and what those chemicals do to electrical components (distilled water doesn’t conduct electricity).  Below is an image of the residue from liquid spill on a PCB. Many of the ingredients are not only corrosive but also conductive (i.e. potassium hydroxide found in Lysol).\n\nThis means not only can the liquid short out circuits as it comes into contact with them, it can eat away at the metal solder connections as well.\nYou may be able to get away with it and not have much or any real damage to your Mac.  However, if you’ve left it for quite some time and the problems still persist, you’ve got damage that can only be addressed by a pro.\n\nA: Do not put it in any oven to dry, but in the sun for 15 minutes can help warm up the body can help to kickstart things drying. The trackpad has very thin gaps and capillary action will wick astounding amounts of liquid inside a Mac - so be sure to never spray on to the hardware, always dampen the cloth and then bring the cloth to the device once you’re sure it’s not soaking and only lightly damp. \nIf you get issues after 15 minutes, I would power off and never start again until you’re sure the inside isn’t still wet. You can short circuit and damage things in seconds. Power off immediately if you suspect a spill or a soaking cloth sat on a device for even a few moments. \nSince you're three days in - it's almost certain you have so much water still in it, that failure is inevitable and you will need a repair much sooner than if it didn't get wet. Or the water is gone, the damage is done and you will have this instability until it overloads something else. Could run like this for years - could be the last moment you have it working. That depends on exactly which trace / part got wet.\n\nA: Did some Googling and tried a suggestion of cleaning the space in between the touch pad and hardware to get rid of the junk/dirt by putting a piece of paper in between them, also it would soak up any residue from the wipe. Tried it and it worked! 36 hours later and the cursor still hasn't started unstoppably fluttering like before and I've used the laptop all day today\nThank you all for the help\n\nA: If you haven't already damaged circuit boards or connectors by leaving dried cleaner or hard water residue deposits inside your MacBook, you could try using the older (pre-IP67) wet iPhone technique: Put your MacBook in a giant zip lock bag of uncooked dry rice (or other desiccant) and leave the bag in warm sunlight for for a day or so.\nBTW, Apple recommends a cloth with isopropyl for disinfecting hardware, as pure isopropyl (dilute with distilled water if needed) won't leave hard water or soap deposits after drying.\nSee: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207123\n", "Q: Safe way to get \"rm dir -rf\" working (place options after dir name like on linux) I don't know how many times I've done it.

Probably 10,000.\nIn linux, I can just add the options in after the dir name.\nIs there any good bash magic that will let this safely happen? Here is a non-functional prototype of a simple bash rm function that I think would do the trick:\nfunction rm() {\n  if $2 eq \"-rf\" then run \"builtin rm $2 $1\"\n}\n\nBut before I reinvent the wheel, I wanted to see if there were other options I'm missing.

I use accounts from GMail and Microsoft Office 365. \nIf I \"Move to Junk\" in macOS and iOS, what does actually happen?

If your mac is running and the rule moves it to the junk folder then ios will see it.\nIf you want one set of rules for all machines then mark the item as Junk using the Web interface on the server.\nI think Microsoft clients talking to exchange servers do do what you suggest.\nI don't exactly know if ios mail interacts with iCloud.\n", "Q: Time Machine - Preparing takes forever...

Since TouchIDs work in the same way as Security keys (both having public-private keypair), and As written here, we can use touchID without passwords as long as we're logged in: Is there a way to use security keys for the same purpose in older Macbooks as the touchIDs in new Macs?\n\nA: It is not currently possible to get the system dialogs for TouchID to also work with a security key, such as for example the popular Yubikey product. Third party applications can however provide support for products such as the Yubikey through similar popups windows.\nOne method of using security keys in a manner that resembles TouchID is to set your system up to them as a kind of \"virtual smart card\". This allows you to use for example a Yubikey as a means of logging in to your Mac, and for authenticating with Keychain, etc.\nThe specific method of achieving that depends on the type of security key you have. In general you need to configure the system and/or install drivers to let the security key function as a \"smart card\".\nFor the Yubikey product you can follow this guide from the manufacturer:\nhttps://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000006468-using-your-yubikey-as-a-smart-card-in-macos\n", "Q: Applescript to Unmount Volumes Matching a Pattern I have several backup offline and bootable backup volumes on a disk , and I would like to unmount all of them at startup.

So they're set up and my Mac can SSH to my Linux server with no password, np.\nHowever I just set up netatalk to have an AFP volume. The login for the AFP volume via netatalk is the SSH username:password. So theoretically you'd think it would support the same public key login that SSH supports as well. But Mac Finder always asks for a password. My mount_afp command doesn't seem to work.  \"open afp ...\" just opens Finder anyway. None of these in this MacWork Link seem to work without a password.\nThis differs from Automatically mount AFP for Time Machine (without saving a password in plaintext) in that that answer has the server using a password, but then the Mac side pulls that password directly from the keychain. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: I don't think this is possible (authentication with OpenSSL cert), based on the linux man page, and the Apple tech documentation listing out authentication methods.\nIf you linux sys admin wants to use passwordless auth, then you're limited to setting up kerberos.\nAlternatively, you could do something like setup an ssh tunnel to connect to the server, and send your AFP traffic through it, and just have the server listen on localhost, limited to accepting local requests. It's still not secure, and still using password-based auth, but it's limiting that traffic to within the machine itself. Traffic out on the wire is SSH encrypted, and authed using your cert.\nYou can start an SSH tunnel as follows:\nssh -f -N -L 10548:[yourserver]:548 [user@yourserver] -i [path/to/your/ssh/key]\n\nThis will start an ssh tunnel in the background tunneling from 10548 on your local machine to port 548 on the server. \nThen in macOS, in Finder, use the Connect to Server and connect to: afp://127.0.0.1:10548\nOr - use something like FUSE and sshfs (not AFP, but it's trivial to setup).\n", "Q: Connect Two Dell 27\" 2719H Monitors to Macbook Air 2017 I'm trying to connect two Dell 27\" P2719H Monitors to a Macbook Air from 2017 running Catalina 10.15.4. The Macbook Air has an Intel HD Graphics 6000 graphics card. This model also has a Thunderbolt 2.0.\nIs this possible to do? So far I've successfully connected one of the monitors to the Macbook using a Dynex HDMI-->Thunderbolt adapter. I've also tried to create a daisy-chain, but it did not work.\n\nA: Since you're using the P2719H, it has DisplayPort connectivity.  Instead of converting to HDMI, you should just get a mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable (mDP to DP).  \nYou can't daisy chain and since you only have one Thunderbolt port, you will need to get either (one or the other) of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Thunderbolt 2 Dock with multiple display outputs\n\n*USB Video adapter\nHowever, this a lot you're asking this MacBook Air to do.  Remember, there's no discrete GPU as it's integrated into the CPU.  Video memory is taken from system memory (up to 1.5GB worth).  I wouldn't be surprised if you see a noticeable performance decrease or reduced video capability.\n", "Q: Disable notifications for a particular account on macOS mail app I have multiple internet accounts linked on macOS for calendar, mail, contacts etc. I wish to disable notifications for a particular account on the mail app. Is it possible to do so?\n\nA: If you're not worried about the mails for that account, you can set up a rule: \nWhen the mail is addressed to <this> account:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mark it as read.\n\n*Flag it yellow.\n\n\nFlagging it would help you read it later.

When that happens, I see that a process called remindd is using 100-300% CPU for a long time, usually more than 10 minutes. It seems this process belongs to the reminders app, which I do use, but it doesn't make any sense that the app has such a high CPU usage. This is not a one time thing, it happened at least 5 times in the last few weeks. I usually ended up killing the process or restarting my Mac. Quitting the reminders app does not stop the process.\nWhat can I do to prevent this?\n\nIt may be related to the reminders app constantly syncing:\n\nAlthough that opens only more questions than it answers.\nI'm using the latest MacBook Pro 16\" with MacOS 10.15.4 (19E287)\n\nA: What worked for me is to turn off Reminders syncing, reboot, then turn it back on. Assuming you are running Catalina, you would go to:\nSystem Preferences -> Internet Accounts -> iCloud -> Uncheck Reminders\nIt took a bit for my reminders to sync again, but after that, there were no more issues with Reminders app lockup and the remindd run away CPU usage.\nHowever, as of recent (Catalina 10.15.7), remindd has run away CPU usage regardless if I turn off/on syncing or I just leave it off the all the time.\nSince I posted this answer, I will add that even with Big Sur (including 11.3 update), so long as I have Reminders enabled, I get high CPU usage with remindd. In addition, reminders are not properly syncing between my iPhone, iPad, and Mac. It appears there is some corruption in my Reminder data and it is not getting fixed with macOS updates.\n\nA: What finally worked for me is to delete the Reminders app from my iPhone.\nI had tried turning off syncing, turning off MacOS notifications, deleting the MacOS app (following safe boot instructions that did not work), and deleting the single reminder I had in the system. Killing the process was just a temporary solution (sometimes measured in hours, other times in seconds).\nDeleting the app on the iPhone finally seems to have fixed the problem.\n\nA: I use to have the same problem, so I kill the process from the command line.\nYou have to find the PID process for that I've used top command\n\nthen is I use the following command:\nsudo kill -9 YOUR_PID_NUMBER\nAfter doing that you can note the difference, the fan noise decreases A LOT.\n", "Q: how to install ubuntu and triple boot with high sierra and legacy booting win10 with dual disk drive?

However if I add the local suffix, or I use the IP address, it works:\nhttps://<servername>.local:port\nhttps://<ipaddress>:port\n\nIt pops up the self-signed cert warning (for the Synology cert) and then proceeds to the web site hosted on the Synology, such as GitLab or DSM Control Panel.\nBut seeing that I have all manner of scripts and repositories of code I can't just have one machine throwing such a curve ball into my configuration. It seems many people have had issues with Catalina networking from reading this thread on the Synology forums.

Is it possible to delete them from the command line without corrupting the library?\n\nA: You can either search using the Finder: \nkind:heic\n\nOr, from the command-line - mdfind uses Spotlight:\nmdfind -name 'heic'\n\nOr, normal unix find:\n find /path/to/search/in -iname \"*.heic\"\n\nYou can then use that output to do as you please.

I'm new to the Mac. I am wondering if it's safely guaranteed that I can make a small partition on my active internal hard drive that already contains data and apps, and then delete said partition (later on) so that the drive resorts back to its original size. Without any of the content/data affected. Is this commonplace or are there any safeguards I should put in place (other than backing up the SSD, of course)? Is there a difference based on the file system? \nThe partition format could be:\nMac OS Extended (Journaled)\nApple File System APFS\nMS-DOS or Ex-fat\n\nA: \nI am wondering if it's safely guaranteed \n\nNo.  Period.\nNothing is \"safely guaranteed.\" Generally speaking (as at the time of this answer your question is lacking in detail), you can (re)partition without corruption of your data.  That's not to say the process is infallible.  Problems happen, mistakes can be made.  This is why is so important to have a backup of your data.\n\nA: No - exFAT / FAT / MS-DOS are not embeddable within APFS easily out of the box. Try to not use these if you want easy. Use external disks for all these needs. If you want hard, here is an absolutely brilliant master class on how to set up a Mac for triple boot. \nYes is only if you can keep your data within APFS. You can make many volumes in the overall container and all share free space. This operation has been done hundreds of times on my test macs and I’ve never lost data or been unable to remove one volume and not get the data back or interfere with files in other volumes. \nOf course, any system can crash, so keep backups but that has nothing to do with adding more volumes to the APFS container. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-eg/guide/disk-utility/dskua9e6a110/mac\nJust be sure you don’t partition the disk and you will be fine. Make volumes in the existing container and you are on the easy path. You would want to post details if you go off the easy path, that can cause issues like you may have experienced or heard in the past. Like the comment from David Anderson - partition has very specific meaning and you don’t want that for guaranteed and easy use of Disk Utility to make logical volumes from an APFS managed disk store. \n\nA: You can resize your partitions with much more safety than just crossing your fingers and hoping there aren't any files in the section you are giving to the new partition, but you should still back up your hard drive.\nOnce you have made a backup and unplugged the backup, go to Disk Utility to make the changes.

I've seen this question over here, but I don't have bluetooth devices allowed to wake the computer. The computer's running Catalina 10.15.3. Any help would be very appreciated!\nEdit: I forgot to add another very weird thing that's been happening: if I completely power off the computer and plug it into the charger, it turns back on. The lid is closed, but I can hear the startup chime and see the apple logo light up. When I open it afterwards, it's at the logon screen.\n\nA: I had a similar issue with my 2015 Macbook pro 13. Even if I had turned off tcpkeepalive and power nap, the system was waking up from sleep. In one of my tests I realized that if I close the lid and enter sleep while the charger was plugged in, the system wakes up from sleep, because \"Power Adapter\" settings are left effective. Eventually, I had to turn off \"Wake for Wi-Fi network access\" and powernap for both Battery and the Power Adapter modes. \nJust to test if this is the issue, can you try to first unplug the laptop from charge, and then close the lid to enter sleep, and see what happens? \n", "Q: Windows 10 desktop Trust This Computer?

As a general rule of thumb the computer will trust most usb devices. However, because phones charge through the usb to lightning cable it may be unwise to trust every host device to which the phone is connected.\nBecause of this you need to unlock your phone (just get past the lock/pin/password/faceID screen) and give permission to \"trust this computer\", which will usually just pop up on the screen.\nIf this is still not working, restarting the phone and computer before trying again may be a good place to start.\n", "Q: Cannot access TimeMachine backups from before clean install of macOS Recently I did a clean install of macOS Catalina on my 2014 13\" MacBook Pro. Before doing the clean install I backed up my computer with TimeMachine, and in fact I have been backing up with TimeMachine for years. After reinstalling macOS Catalina, my plan was to just go into the TimeMachine backups and pick and choose the files that I needed, since the vast majority of what I need day to day was already in iCloud Drive.\nHowever, now when I into the TimeMachine Backups.backupdb folder, I see backups dated from before I did the clean reinstall but they have the name that I changed my computer to after the clean reinstall and they do not show any of the data from before the reinstall. In fact they just contain Macintosh HD - Data, Macintosh HD and Recovery folders, with Users inside of Macintosh HD - Data, with a folder for my current username (and not the username from before the reinstall) inside of Users, and that home folder only contains Movies, Music and Pictures.\nIn short, I can't access any of the data from before the clean reinstall even though TimeMachine has folders for all the backups going back over 6 months, but they all have the same structure as I described above and do not contain any of the data I need. The TimeMachine disk however shows just about the same amount of space occupied as before the reinstall, ~250Gb.\nIs there any way that I can access my old files?\n\nA: Time Machine can be tricky and sometimes you really need to reformat your external drive and start over. But you could check several things, like are you using HFS+ on your external Hard Drive? Did you repair permissions of your external hard drive with 'Disk Utility'? Is the internal and external hard drive name still the same? Is your user short name the same?\nYou could also try, within the information panel of your ext. hard drive, to ignore permissions and user.\n", "Q: How can I place a shortcut to a network folder in my sidebar? My ultimate goal here is very simple:  I want to place a shortcut to a specific network folder (on another machine my home network), in the sidebar of my personal machine.  But I am getting some very strange behavior, as demonstrated in the following video:\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/41174425ff9b40f49c4eccd6b7b61b3f\nHere is what the video shows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount a network volume\n\n*Choose a folder on the volume, and drag it into the Finder sidebar\n\n*Eject the volume\n\n*Select the alias you just added, from the sidebar.  Volume and folder mount fine.\n\n*Eject the volume.  Receive error dialog that the item can't be ejected because it is in use, but a few seconds later the volume is in fact ejected.\n\n*Dismiss the error dialog(s) and select the alias from the sidebar again.  Receive error that he item cannot be opened because the original item can't be found.  In the background you can see the volume is in fact mounted.\n\n*Dismiss the error dialog and select the alias from the sidebar again.  It will open up just fine since the volume is now mounted.\n\n\nI can recreate these results every time, with any network folder.  The remote machine is a 2012 Mac Mini running Sierra, and my machine is a 2018 MacbookPro running High Sierra, in case the OS version matters.\nWhy is this happening and is there a way to make this functionality work without all the confusing and incorrect error dialogs?\n\nA: Wow, it looks like I have found a workable solution to this.  Still a few strange bits which you can see in the new video I created, but the end result basically works.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*With the remote volume not mounted, open the Connect to Server dialog (Command-K in Finder)\n\n*Enter the network address of your remote volume.  If you have previously connected to it, it should be selectable in the dropdown menu on the right hand side.  The resulting address should look something like smb://Media%20Server._smb._tcp.local\n\n*Add the rest of the path to your desired folder, including the volume name.  In my case the volume was called Media1 and the folder was called backups, so the final result was smb://Media%20Server._smb._tcp.local/Media1/backups.  Click Connect.\n\n*Note that the resulting window displays the remote folder you wanted, but it is now mounted as if it were a volume rather than a folder.\n\n*Drag the icon in the titlebar of the window, to the sidebar.\n\n\nNow you can mount and eject the remote folder directly from your sidebar.  There is still some strange behavior with occasional complaints when ejecting the volume, but they don't always happen and I'm wondering if they are caused by my being on Wifi on my Macbook.  Still in the end I seem to have a working solution after years of wrestling with this and never getting it to work reliably.\n", "Q: Why can't I get the Windows installer to launch (Bootcamp)? iMac 13, 1 (late 2012) I get a black screen with blinking cursor when Boot Camp reboots after creating the partition.  I have been trying to install Windows 10 1909 on an iMac 13,1 (late 2012) running High Sierra (and now Catalina). The first issue I had was creating the USB - I ran into the issue that boot camp could not create the USB because there is a file greater than 4 GB, and so I circumvented this issue by re-formatting the USB to exFAT and then copying the contents of the Windows software support and the Windows 10 ISO onto the drive.  I also read some reports that you need a USB 2.0, and so I've attempted that as well with the same result.\nI then run boot camp and create a partition, and the system reboots, but just has a black screen with blinking cursor, so I cannot not run the Windows installer at all. If I manual shutdown and then reboot holding option, I have a USB option \"Windows\" and \"EFI Boot\" (or at least that was the way it was with High Sierra). When I run EFI Boot, I can enter the Windows installer, but an EFI windows install is not possible because the partition scheme is MBR, not GPT (and I've heard the drivers for this generation Mac do not cooperate with EFI boot anyway). When I run \"Windows\" option, I get the same result - black screen with blinking cursor. So I am stuck.\nI'm not certain if this is relevant, but this machine previously had Windows 10 dual boot with its original Mountain Lion install, however, the Windows install completely crashed and was irreparable. What I did was remove the Windows partition with Boot camp assistant, and then I completely wiped MacOS and re-installed the High Sierra. I did run updates, and it did run a firmware update.\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Your Mac is suppose to EFI boot 64 bit Windows 10. You should not be using hybrid partitioning when installing Windows 10. You should use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Windows Support Software. If you copied the Window Support Software correctly to the flash drive, then there should be a $WinPEDriver$ folder in the root folder of the flash drive. You should be able to remove hybrid partitioning  by using the Disk Utility application to Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format the internal partition where you intend to install Windows. Or, you can use the diskutil command to JHFS+ format. You should EFI boot from the flash drive to install Windows 10.\nThe Problem\nYou view the Boot Camp partition in the Disk Utility and you see the partition contains either a MS‑DOS (FAT32) or ExFAT volume, as shown below.\n\nWhen installing Windows, you will encounter the following error message.\n\nThis is a indication that the installation drive is hybrid partitioned. You need to remove hybrid partitioning in order to install Windows to UEFI boot.\nSolution Method 1\nIf an action by the Disk Utility or diskutil command results in no Microsoft specific partitions existing on a drive, then High Sierra and newer versions of macOS will remove hybrid partitioning. Since there is only one Microsoft specific partition on this drive, the drive will be erased and formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled) by the Disk Utility to remove the hybrid partitioning. The result is shown below.\n\nWhen installing Windows you will encounter the following error message.\n\nA solution is to follow the steps given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Highlight the partition where you were going to install Windows, then select the Delete button and the OK button.\n\n*Highlight the unallocated space, then select the New button followed by the Apply and OK buttons. The result is shown below.\n\n\n*(Optional)  Since the Boot Camp Assistant has always omitted the MSR (Reserved) partition when I have installed Windows to UEFI boot, I will delete this partition. Feel free to leave the partition, if you wish.\n\nNote: Microsoft documentation states there should always be an MSR (Reserved) partition.\n\n\n*Highlight the partition where you wish to install Windows, as shown below.\n\n\n*Select the Next button to install Windows. The installer will automatically NTFS format the partition.\nSolution Method 2\nIf an action by the Disk Utility or diskutil command results in no Microsoft specific partitions existing on a drive, then High Sierra and newer versions of macOS will remove hybrid partitioning. Since there is only one Microsoft specific partition on this drive, the drive will be erased and formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled) by the Disk Utility to remove the hybrid partitioning. The result is shown below.\n\nWhen installing Windows you encounter the following error message.\n\nA solution is to follow the steps given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the shift+F10 key combination to open a Command Prompt window. Enter the commands shown below.  If your drive and partition numbers are different, then make the appropriate substitutions. The last exit command will close the window.\n\n\n*Select the Refresh button.\n\n*Highlight the partition where you want to instal Windows, as shown below.\n\n\n*Select the Next button to install Windows. The installer will automatically NTFS format the partition.\nSolution Method 3\nIf an action by the Disk Utility or diskutil command results in no Microsoft specific partitions existing on a drive, then High Sierra and newer versions of macOS will remove hybrid partitioning. Since there is only one Microsoft specific partition on this drive, the drive will be erased and formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled) by the Disk Utility to remove the hybrid partitioning. The result is shown below.\n\nTo avoid the problems encountered with the first two methods, the partition will be erased and ExFAT formatted by the Disk Utility application. The result is shown below. With High Sierra and newer versions of macOS, the drive will not be hybrid partitioned by this action.\n\nWhen installing Windows you encounter the following error message.\n\nThe solution is to select the Format button to NTFS format the partition. The result is shown below. \n\nYou can now select the Next button to proceed and install Windows.\nA Note About Partitioning\nThere are two unique partition tables stored on a drive where macOS is installed. The first is a legacy Master Boot Record (MBR) table. This table is ignored by macOS. The second is a GUID Partition Table (GPT). If there are partition entries in the MBR table, then Windows with use this table and ignore the GPT. This is referred to a hybrid partitioning. If a UEFI booted Graphical User Interface (GUI) Windows installer detects partition entries in the MBR partition table on a drive, then the installer will not install Windows on that drive. In your case, hybrid partitioning needs to be removed from the internal drive in order to install a UEFI booting Windows 10. \n\nA: I had a similar issue, years ago. I solved it by changing the Windows installation DVD (a specific one won't install properly). In other words, if you are in trouble creating a Stick, try burning an Installation DVD or try another Windows-Image.\n", "Q: How to delete App (files with cross sign) that cant delete from Application on Mac Due to my new Mac running hot overheating issue, I found an extension app called \"Turbo Boost Switcher\" to see if I can control heat generation. \nHowever, since it can't it run properly, I want to delete it after. Then I realized, I cant remove it from the launchpad nor from the Application folder.\nWhen I try to search what are leftover in the computer, I found that the files were all shown with a prohibitory sign as shown. \n\nHow can I locate and trash these icons?\n\nA: The prohibitory symbol means the application will not run on your machine.\nI'd recommend either user128733 or CousinCocaine approach as seen here:\nHow to remove an icon from launchpad that does not appear in the Finder?\nApplication cleaner tend to be OK.

I maintain a macOS application. Some users (but not all) report an issue (I suspect, those running Catalina), where the first time the app is launched, it crashes. All future launches work okay.\nI've managed to reproduce this, and it's crashing in the argument parsing code. My suspicion is that Gatekeeper is passing some unusual argument on the first launch (the one where it shows the 'this is an application downloaded from foo.com' dialog).\nThe argument-parsing code is pretty robust : it already rejects bogus arguments, so there must be something very unusual being passed. The problem is my local builds don't show the problem, and I don't know to reset the quarantine flag to trigger the fault again.\n (Also of course the crashes are in release builds, so the crash trace doesn't give me an exact location)\nIf I could trigger the quarantine warning artificially, by marking a local debug build as 'newly downloaded', I suspect this would be trivial to debug.\n\nA: Okay, found a way to test this on a debug build, and figured it out. My solution was to copy the com.apple.quarantine xattr onto the debug binary which XCode creates, and then test this via 'open'. (Launching via Terminal never showed the issue)\nThis reveals that when launched with the quarantine flag set, the command line contains a 'NULL' as the second arg; i.e argc=2, argv[0]=, argv[1]=0\n", "Q: Does Frequently used Memoji History reset If not used This is a very important topic for me. The love of my life saw frequently used Memoji on my phone that she questioned.   I don’t blame her, I would have asked also. my question is how long do “Frequently used Memoji” stay listed when not used. These Memoji where from before I met her. Will the frequently used memoji reset to a default When not used or stay at the last used for ever?  Where do I find documentation on  the Algorithm to show her they are not recent and just last used from long ago?  Thanks. \n\nA: The Memoji stickers can be deleted in any app, tap the three dots, then tap the core Memoji and delete it. I’ve never seen them time out or go away, just new ones pile on top of the old as you use them. \n\nTap the Memoji identity you with to duplicate or delete.\n\nAs for the overall keyboard, you can reset all of the word suggestions, etc in the settings app. But you circled the Memoji which just exist until you delete the identities in the keyboard overlay itself. \n\n\n*\n\n*Settings > General > Reset > Reset Keyboard Dictionary\n\n\nA: There's only one way you can force reset your emojis from your recently used ones is to reset your dictionary by going into Settings > General > Reset > Reset Keyboard Dictionary.

I'd like to set my iphone to engage airplane mode for an hour (example) and then turn off airplane mode/engage cellular service an hour later.  Is that possible?\n\nA: Using a Shortcut for that would probably be the best solution. If you have any experience with programming you could probably whip something up without too much effort, or I'd recommend checking out the shortcuts subreddit. \nThere's also a chance somebody has already created what you're looking for, I didn't find anything in a quick glance through this gallery, but you could possibly find something with some digging. \nI hope this helps move you in the right direction!\n\nA: No - this isn’t automated.

(BTW, if you haven't updated your iOS version to either of these builds, you should disable the Mail app on your iPhone as an interim fix to avoid getting pwned.)\nSource: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2020/05/21/apple-ios-135-release-should-you-upgrade-new-iphone-update/\niOS 12.4.7 was supposedly pushed out for older devices that are incompatible with iOS 13.\nI am using an iPhone 6s, running iOS 12.4.1. Checking for Software Updates via Settings app → General → Software Update only offers to install iOS 13.5.\nI assume there must be some sort of download link where I can get an iOS 12.4.7 installer package and load it onto my phone via iTunes, although I wasn't able to find one.\nIs there a way to install iOS 12.4.7 on iPhone 6s?\nIMPORTANT: For anyone who didn't know, there's a big difference between the iPhone 6s and the original iPhone 6. The 6s has significantly improved hardware specs, most importantly double the RAM (https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/26/9401563/iphone-6s-teardown-ram-confirmed-2gb) which often makes the difference between \"running the latest apps properly\" and \"puzzling, bizarre random crashes\".\n\nA: You are apparently out of luck here. While it's possible to download an iOS firmware (a .ipsw file) and install it onto a device, as long as Apple is signing is, Apple typically stops signing an older release a few days after issuing an update. IPSW is a well regarded website that lets you download all the available firmwares for a device.\nHowever, Apple has not built iOS 12.4.7 for the devices that support running iOS 13 or later. Thus, iOS 12.4.7 was never released in the first place for iPhone 6s.\nSo technically speaking, there is no way to obtain and/or install iOS 12.4.7 for an iPhone 6s. Your only way to get patched for this particular vulnerability is by installing iOS 13.5 on your iPhone 6s.\n", "Q: Wifi gets disconnected when connecting to VPN via Cisco AnyConnect Client I have a Macbook Pro 2017 model.

Indeed you need a working copy of MacOS in order to enable Target Display Mode. So using the internet recovery option (Command+R while booting up) I installed MacOS on an external 32GB usb stick attached to my iMac. Then after about an hour of installation the iMac booted into High Sierra and using Command+F2 it switched into Target Display Mode and I was able to use it as a second monitor for my Windows 10 PC. \n", "Q: I can't boot into macOS Mojave on a Catalina laptop I have Mojave 10.14.6 on an external drive. When I plug it into my T2 MacBook Pro 16 inch running Catalina I get the prohibitory symbol instead of the Apple symbol and it can't boot. Is this issue solvable? Or does it mean I have to resort to other measures like bootcamp for instance?\n\n\nA: You usually can't boot a Mac with an OS version which is older than the release date of the hardware. The old OS lacks some drivers required for new hardware.\nYou can still run Mojave etc. within a VM (using VMWare or Parallels).\n", "Q: Specify password when connecting to a Samba share I can connect to a Samba share on my Raspberry Pi with the following:-\nopen smb://MilliwaysPi4.local/pi\n\nThis then prompts for a password.\nmacOS offers to remember the password in Keychain, BUT this still needs to be confirmed, and it attempts to use my macOS username, so needs to be edited.\nIs there a way to specify the password in the command line?\n\nA: You can specify a username and password before the domain name:\nopen smb://username:password@MilliwaysPi4.local/pi\n", "Q: Boot Camp requiring disk on High Sierra I'm running High Sierra on my late-2009 iMac.\nIn the past, I've not had trouble installing Windows 7 with Boot Camp on older versions of Mac OS\nBut this time, I'm getting the following error before I reach the partition page:\n\nThe installer disc could not be found.\nInsert your Windows installer disc and wait a few seconds for the disc\n  to be recognized.\n\nThings is, I don't have a Windows installer disk... I downloaded an ISO for Windows 8.1 from the Microsoft website.\nIt might be worth also pointing out that the optical disk drive on my iMac no longer works, I'm not sure if this is related to me using High Sierra or whether the drive itself has just died.\nDoes the Boot Camp Assistant require me to install Windows from a DVD? I just want to install it from the .ISO file like everyone else.\nI could possibly purchase an external DVD drive and then figure out how to create a bootable Windows disk using that... but that seems like a lot of effort for something that might not even work.\n\nA: Below are answers to the questions in your post.\nI did a quick check with the internet and it would appears 64 bit Windows 7 is the last version of Windows that Apple officially supports on your model Mac. Therefore, installing a Windows 8, 8.1 or 10 usually requires more than the Boot Camp Assistant. \nI have a 2011 iMac with a working optical and High Sierra, so I doubt High Sierra is the reason the optical drive fails to work.\nThe Boot Camp Assistant does require installing Windows from a DVD on your model Mac. Although, many users here at Ask Different have modified the Boot Camp Assistant in a attempt to install Windows using a flash drive.\nOfficially, installing from an ISO file did not start with Macs until the 2015 model year. Apple does not support installing from an ISO with any 2009 model year Macs.\nUsing an external DVD drive may or may not work. There is no actual way to tell other than trying.\nPersonally, I would try installing the current version of Windows 10. It has been reported that a Windows 7 or 8.1 product key will work with the current Windows 10 download. I tested this earlier this year and was successful using a 2018 Mac mini.\nWhen I installed High Sierra on my 2011 iMac, firmware upgrades were installed that allowed the Mac to EFI boot the Windows 10 installer from an ExFAT formatted internal or USB drive. Originally, I was required to use an optical drive to install Windows, but now I can also use a flash drive or install directly from the ISO file. I do not know if the same would be true for your 2009 iMac.\nThe answer that closest matches your question can be found at Any solution to bootcamp windows 8.1 with macbook pro 15\" 2010?.

You will want to track what exactly is plugged in physically to the mac. Everything from which cable - which port - as you make screen shots of times with high retransmission, you will know how often that happens and if it’s only when one cable or one device is attached. (And you will have to detach devices - split-half troubleshooting if needed or one by one)\nMake note of devices that generate interference even when they are properly working:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201163 - About USB on Mac computers\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201542 - Resolve Wi-Fi and Bluetooth issues caused by wireless interference\n\n\nHopefully you don’t need to capture the Bluetooth traffic to understand the spikes and cause of retransmission - there are devices that can do this but it’s kind of technical and the good tools cost money and time to learn.

According to the information here, I believe the operating system running on 2009 MBP should be OS X 10.11 \"El Capitan\". On the other hand, MBP 2020 should be running Catalina, which is the latest for now. \nThere are some posts on the web (e.g., here, here, or here) which mention that the font smoothing on modern MacOs versions, especially Catalina has evolved so that the text looks much worse on displays which does not have dense pixels such as the retina screens or the 4K screens of sizes between 21 - 27. \nIf the problem is not related to the conversion of signal to VGA, using the solution stated in here should decrease the problem just a bit. I had the same problem with a 24\" 1920x1200 HP monitor lately, and these settings helped to some extent. \nNevertheless, it looks like Apple has optimized its software and smoothing algorithms for the high resolution displays and therefore, MacOS Catalina seems to be not as forgiving as the older MacOS versions. On the other hand, currently, Windows and Linux does not have this problem and can do better with lower resolution screens as of now. \nHope this helps. \n\nA: If you are using a different adapter then my guess is your new adapter is not as good as the old one.  VGA is an analog signal so it can get fuzzy and still get through.  A digital signal, like DVI or DisplayPort, will either work or not, it doesn’t get fuzzy from a bad conversion.\nIs there a reason why you chose VGA instead of DVI?  It appears the display supports DVI, or perhaps I’m looking at the wrong display.  Use DVI and the signal is digital all the way, not being converted to analog and back.  With an all digital signal the computer is driving each pixel individually, not giving the display an analog wave that gets chopped up and blurred by the conversion.\nI recognize the age of the question but this is a situation people could still run into when moving an existing monitor from an old computer with mini-DisplayPort (or not so mini DisplayPort) to a new computer with USB-C.  The system bot bumped the question to the top so I took that as an opportunity to answer.\n", "Q: How can I make it as easy as possible for someone to make an emergency call? My mother-in-law lives with us and is in poor health. She is wheelchair bound and has COPD, needing assistance with an oxygen compressor and oxygen tanks.\nIn recent weeks, there have been a few emergencies where she fell out of her wheelchair and needed immediate assistance, but it was the early morning, and no one was awake to check on her for about an hour. She has an iPhone and knows how to use \"Hey Siri,\" but the phone wasn't within reach and wasn't registering her voice, which is very quiet and raspy.\nI'm looking for some way for her to carry a small device that she could press a button on and an alert would immediately be sent to at least one, preferably multiple phones (mine, my wife's, my son's).\nAll the emergency medical devices I've found are subscription based and contact a third party. My mother-in-law doesn't want this.\nWe all have iPhones and Wi-Fi in the house. Her bedroom has a good Wi-Fi signal, but spotty cellular reception.\nIs there a technology that she can always have on her person where she pressing a simple button and an alert appears on my wife's, my son's, and my iPhone?\n\nA: Apple Watch Series 4 provides a 1st party solution for the aforementioned requirements.\nYou can consider an Apple Watch Series 4 or later with Cellular connectivity. Apple Watch Series 4 and later feature build-in fall detection mode that can also alert the emergency services and customizable emergency contacts. A cellular variant remains connected to the Internet even if the paired iPhone is not in the proximity.\nYou can refer to the Apple Support document, Use fall detection with Apple Watch to learn more:\n\nIf Apple Watch Series 4 or later detects a hard fall, it can help connect you to emergency services if needed.\nIf Apple Watch Series 4 or later detects a hard fall while you're wearing your watch, it taps you on the wrist, sounds an alarm, and displays an alert. You can choose to contact emergency services or dismiss the alert by pressing the Digital Crown, tapping Close in the upper-left corner, or tapping \"I'm OK.\"\n\nand\n\nIf your Apple Watch detects that you're immobile for about a minute, it begins a 30-second countdown, while tapping you on the wrist and sounding an alert. The alert gets louder, so that you or someone nearby can hear it. If you don't want to call emergency services, tap Cancel. When the countdown ends, your Apple Watch automatically contacts emergency services.\n\nThe fall detection and emergency calling feature is built into Apple Watch and doesn't require you to install a separate app or get a separate subscription.\nEven without a fall, Apple Watch makes it very easy to contact the emergency contacts which can be configured. Having a Cellular model gives the extra peace of mind that the Watch would have cellular connectivity even if the paired iPhone is not in range.\nSince the features comes built-in from Apple, there's no data privacy concerns.\nApple Watch Series 4 and later also supports \"Hey Siri\".\n", "Q: Change Apple ID for a user when the e-mail cannot be confirmed Over time I've used different e-mail addresses for different things with Apple: Apple Store, Support, I-Tunes, Apple Developer and while I still have control of the addresses, I cannot confirm my Apple ID with any of them. I have now created a new ID with yet another e-mail address that I could confirm and for which I've activated 2FA. However, I don't seem to be able to associate this id with my local user account and I can't associate any of the other e-mail addresses with the new one, confirmed one. All Apple's documentation seems to assume that it's possible to login with the accounts and has no information about what to do when the confirmation doesn't work (I receive e-mails with the confirmation code, but Apple doesn't like them). Can I dissociate my local user from an Apple ID?\n\nA: I spent some time with Apple Support on this but we only succeeded in bricking my system so that I couldn't create any kind of accounts (so existing accounts for Google, etc. were lost and not replaceable)!\nThe Apple support script suggests you delete the accounts from ~/Library/Accounts and elsewhere before running defaults delete MobileMeAccounts. Now, the acccounts in ~/LibraryAccounts are in an SQLite database which is readable and editable with the sqlite3 program so changes are always possible and removing the files should be considered a last resort. I was also required to reinstall MacOS and reset the permissions for my home directory, takes a while as it's 200 GB. I also tried reinstalling from Time Machine (takes forevever) and failed here. Fortunately, I'd also created a backup with Carbon Copy, which is both faster and more useful.\nRelevant, at least for me, because I couldn't sign out from the account I can use but can't confirm, is the MobileMe stuff, which is what Apple called accounts before it introduced iCloud.\nHowever, again deleting anything without creating a backup is asking for trouble. Fortunately, profile information can be exported and imported so you can make a backup and even make changes. To make a backup defaults export MobileMeAccounts - > accounts.plist. This will create an XML file which you can edit in a suitable editor or with XCode. You can then make changes such as removing a broken account and then import it using defaults import MobileMeAccounts accounts.plist. If you then restart the machine or logout and log back in, you should be able to create associate the account with a different Apple ID. This worked for me\nThis still doesn't solve the underlying problem as to why Apple will not accept certain Apple ID accounts as valid accounts and, apparently, it will also not let you merge them. But they can be added as additional accounts so that purchases from the App Store, etc. should still be usable.\n", "Q: From which year do MacBook keyboards have no issues?

It wasn’t until the 2019 16” MacBook Pro did they get rid of the horrible “butterfly keyboard mechanism:\nThey were introduced in the 2015 MacBook and were integrated into subsequent Macs after that.\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook - 2015 through 2017.

All MBP modes from this line have the butterfly keyboard.  There has been no release of a 15” model for 2020  \n\n\n*MacBook Air - All MacBook Air models from 2015 through 2019 had the butterfly key.   \nAll new models MacBook from 2020 onward will have the new Magic Keyboard (scissor) mechanism (until they change again, of course).  \n\nA: Generally speaking, any Apple laptop available for sale from May 2020 comes with a comparatively reliable keyboard.\nTo elaborate, the distinction you should be looking for is whether the laptop comes with a Butterfly Switch key mechanism vs Scissor Switch key mechanism.\nWhen it comes to recent generation of Apple laptops, there are basically categorized into three distinct classes (increasing order of performance, decreasing order of portability):\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook (marketed as New MacBook released between 2015-2019)\n\n*MacBook Air\n\n*MacBook Pro\nApple first introduced Butterly Switch keyboard design with 2015 MacBook. Butterfly Switch keyboard featured flatter key design with lesser key travel, and an entirely new internal mechanism. Butterfly Switch design was then incorporated in the re-designed 2016 MacBook Pro lineup (13\" and 15\") and subsequently into 2018 13\" MacBook Air.\nApart from having difference in terms of tactile feedback, key travel and user experience compared to the predecessor Scissor Switch design, (which could be subjective) Butterly key design, in general, performed poorly in terms of reliability compared to their ancestor Scissor Switch design.\nDue to growing user concerns, the Butterly Switch design saw iterations over four generations where the internal mechanism was tweaked and new materials were used, but the reliability issues still persisted to an extent, causing Apple to launch the Keyboard Service Program. Under the program, customers are eligible to get a service or even a replacement of keyboard if needed, free of cost.\nHowever, starting recently with the introduction of Late 2019 16\" MacBook Pro which was released in November 2019, Apple attempted to address the issue with an entirely overhauled and enhanced keyboard design based on Scissor Switch and re-branded it as New Magic Keyboard. The general response for the said Magic Keyboard has been \nThis scissor mechanism has been further adopted into Early 2020 13\" MacBook Air, released in March 2020, and subsequently in Mid 2020 13\" MacBook Pro release in May 2020.\nWith this last release, the transition of the entire lineup of Apple laptops to use scissor switch is complete and they are all re-branded as the New Magic Keyboard.\nApple has discontinued MacBook from its laptop lineup in June 2019.\n\nA: It depends what you mean by \"bad\" in terms of the failure rate, and on how much you believe the hype around it. I have a MacBook Air with one of the butterfly (\"bad\") keyboards and have had no problems with it at all. I'm sure most people with the the same keyboard also have had no problems. I think it's too early to determine whether or not the new designed keyboard is more reliable since it's only been out for a month or so.\n", "Q: Why is my *first* time machine backup much larger than my disk space used? Why would the first backup on a new time machine shared drive be almost 100GB larger than the data stored on the disk?  I understand why subsequent backups will take more space, but this is a brand new backup and there's only been a few GB of disk changes since the backup started.\nThe picture below shows a 604GB backup of a 1TB system disk with 490GB available.\nUPDATE: the backup didn't finish until it claimed to have backed up more than 700GB.\nUPDATE: Although a big portion of my disk is Parallels VMs, Parallels wasn't running during the backup and hasn't been running for weeks. (I only need VMs to occasionally run some Windows software every month or two.)\nWhat could be causing this?  I'm running MacOS Catalina 10.15.4 if that's relevant.\n\n\nA: \"there's only been a few GB of disk changes since the backup started.\"\nWere you using the VMs? Time Machine is somewhat inefficient in that it will copy an entire file if a single modification is made. So if your VM file is 100 GB in size, and it gets modified, then that's another 100 GB that gets copied.\nIf the first backup goes on for longer than an hour, then it will included deltas.\nSome people prefer to exclude VMs from TM and manage backups for them using some other method. You seem to have c. 300 GB of VM data, so if you're using those regularly, you will add 300 GB to your TM volume every day.\n", "Q: leap year determination macOS 10.15.4 and Calendar.app 11.0 display February 2020 with 28 days, indicating 2020 is not a leap year.

I received a broken 2017 MacBook Pro from a friend who had given up on it. On attempting to boot it up I saw the \"no entry\" sign, which as far as I understand means there's something wrong/corrupted in the hard drive. I managed to get to the internet recovery screen and attempted to reinstall the OS but couldn't. Running First Aid showed that the APFS file was corrupted in a way that I couldn't fix. I tried to delete the file and replace it with a new one and that didn't work either. For reference, I'm a software developer but I don't understand much about BIOS and such things, especially on Apple computers which I never use.\nAfter a few deletion attempts, or maybe a successful one, I don't remember, I became unable to reach the recovery menu again. The Apple logo would appear with the loading bar, and the bar would fill a tiny amount over 10 seconds or so before I was sent to the black screen with the no entry sign again.\nDue to my hacking (I'm guessing) I can no longer seem to access the Internet Recovery menu. Does anyone know a solution to this problem? I thought of maybe trying to boot from a Linux disk or USB or opening up the laptop and physically replacing the hard drive. Would either of these work?\n\nA: Why not install a fresh copy of macOS on an external drive before you make any changes to the internal drive. This Mac supports internet recovery so you can boot to internet OS - use Disk Utility to erase / prepare the external drive (USB or Thunderbolt is fine) and then download the installer from the internet while in recovery boot.\nNow you can boot to the external drive and make sure the system is healthy and see if you can wipe the internal or need a repair.\nIf you have nothing to lose on the Mac, follow Allan’s excellent answer for how to erase and install without pausing to work on an external drive.\n\nA: The \"prohibitory or no entry sign\" means that it cannot find a bootable volume.  It could be from corruption where a few files got messed up or it could simply be missing.\nYou've done a lot of hacking away at the system and it's difficult to know exactly what's left so your best bet is just to wipe things clean and start with a fresh install.  However, before proceeding, there's a few things to clear up...\n\n*\n\n*There's no APFS \"file.\"  You have APFS container(s) on your drive and within those containers you can have different volumes.  One of those volumes is the boot volume from which your Mac reads to start loading the OS.\n\n\n*The 2017 MacBook Pro doesn't have a removable hard drive, so there's no swapping it out.\n\n\n*Booting Linux or a USB (with what OS?) isn't going to fix a missing/corrupt boot loader. It has to be reinstalled.\nReinsalling macOS\n\n*\n\n*Start in Internet Recovery Mode Hold Option-Command-R and wait until the installer appears\n\n\n*Select Disk Utility from the Tools Menu.  When it loads, erase the internal drive and format using the APFS file system.  When finished, quit Disk Utility (don't reboot.  You'll return to the \"main menu.\"\n\n\n*Select \"Reinstall macOS.\"  This will install a clean copy of macOS onto your system complete with boot loader.  Once finished, it will be able to boot again.\nPlease note that the above instructions are simplified for this post.  If you have data to backup, that should be done first.\n\nA: I can't speak to the \"no entry\" sign, but if you have any friends or colleagues that use an Apple desktop/notebook, with their help I would create a bootable USB stick using the most recent OS that the Macbook Pro supports, which I think is Catalina since it's a 2017, and try to perform a clean install of the O.S. using the USB stick. Details on how to create a USB Bootable disk are here: https://support.apple.com/sl-si/HT201372\nAlso, another option is to make an appointment at an Apple store, if you have one in your area,  to see if one of their support reps could help you get the machine running.\n", "Q: Xcode Error: Unable to install app (Error Code: Code: -402620383) I am using my free Apple developer account (Apple ID) for learning to develop iOS apps with Xcode.

When I put it into the jack (that is the same of the headphones), my audio go mute, because computer thinks I'm using a headphone.\nLuckily, the mic works as expected, but I can not hear any audio. So if I am in a conference, I cannot hear them.\nIs there is a software solution? If not, what hardware solution could I use?\n\nA: You do not have a microphone jack. You plugged your microphone in the headphone jack. This is why you can not select internal speakers.\nTry one of these adaptors:\nUSB Type A:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/customerpicks/Explore-usb-adapters-for-microphone/49a722acca2e7546619b\nUSB Type C:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/CableCreation-External-Headphone-Microphone-Compatible/dp/B075YFDJ4Q\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Headphone-Microphone-Plantronics-Sennheiser-Compatible/dp/B07KPLDJ18\nOr get a USB microphone and skip the adaptor.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/usb-microphone/s?k=usb+microphone\nhttps://www.amazon.com/usb-c-microphone/s?k=usb-c+microphone\nPerhaps the jack is for a headset (combination microphone/headphone).\nThere is this question: How to use a wired headphone AND a mic at the same time on the Macbook Pro Retina?. The answer would suggest the jack would accept a plug with two rings. This would allow the jack to be used for a mono microphone and stereo headphones. If this is your arrangement, then the you still would need a USB solution since using the jack would not allow the internal speakers to be used.\n\nAlthough, you have to wonder. If you used the microphone jack and left the headphone jack unused of an adaptor, like the one shown below, then could the internal speakers be accessed? My guess is probably not.\n\n\nA: There are two solutions:\n\n*\n\n*a simple headset splitter.  You can pick these up pretty much any store that sells cell phone and computer accessories\n\n*USB DAC.  This gives you a digital audio input/output device connected to USB.\n\nThe port on your Mac is a combo headphone and microphone.  When you plug in a device, it physically trips a switch that turns off your internal microphone and speakers.  This is why you can no longer see the internal microphone or speakers are input/output sources.\nI personally prefer the USB DAC because it's totally separate and you can now use a combination of input and output devices.  For instance you can use the\nBoya M1 and the internal speakers.  You can use the internal Mic and external speakers.  I use my DAC for sending quality audio to my Bose while system sounds remain on the internal speakers.\n", "Q: Specify mount point for Samba share I can connect to a Samba share on my Raspberry Pi with the following:-\nopen smb://pi:password@MilliwaysPi4.local/pi\n\nThis works, and Finder shows the Location as MilliwaysPi4.local with access to the pi home directory.\nThis mounts at /Volumes/pi but if I have another Raspberry Pi already mounted it mounts at /Volumes/pi-1 etc.\nIs there any way I can specify a mount point?\nOn Linux I can mount a share on my Mac at a specified mount point /mnt/Image with a command like the following:-\nsudo mount.cifs //Milliways.local/Images /mnt/Image -o user=XXX\n\nIs there any similar option in macOS.\nThe Help file is very brief, and I can't find any detailed documentation for the open smb:// commands.\n\nA: The open smb:// command is just automating what you're doing manually in Linux\nStart by creating the mount point\nsudo mkdir /Volumes/foobar\n\nThen mount the share\nsudo mount -t smbfs //user@hostname/path/to/share /Volumes/foobar\n\nor \nsudo mount_smbfs //user@hostname/path/to/share /Volumes/foobar\n\n", "Q: How do I cleanly remove old Juniper Pulse installation from Mac OSX?

The folders are not grayed out because you are allowed to change folders if you were to choose saving in them.\nFor example, if you had a folder full of .docx and .xlsx files while trying to save a .docx file all of the .xlsx files will be grayed out, but the .docx files will be their normal contrast.\nDepending on the application, there may be a \"File Extension\" or a \"Format\" option at the bottom of the save dialog box where you can save as a different extension. In some cases (although becoming less common) this dialog box may have the option *.* that will allow you to select any extension. You've cropped out that part of your screenshots so I can't say exactly if this option exists in your case.\n", "Q: how to trace which request creates ping spike?

That seq or sequence number is just a two byte field (16 bits) that's used the match the packet that you sent out with the reply.  Your request doesn't create a spike.

The point is, anything on any of those points can contribute to a latency and a ping spike.\nIf you're trying to gauge your bandwidth from your ISP, you need something like http://speedtest.net (there's a CLI version available).  If you looking to check the speed transfer between two different services across ISPs, then you need iperf3.\nFinally, pinging Google is an excellent way to check to see if your Internet is up.

You probably want to profile some traffic more prioritized than an ICMP echo packet, though.\nOr do a ICMP ping to your router if you think the problem / congestion is on your side where you have the chance to control.

I'm looking at an 8TB Mac Pro machine for business. I have found 4 year old articles stating there is a 2.2tb size limit on Boot Camp.\nThere is no current data.\nCalled and spoke with a senior advisor who could find no documentation. Was told to just buy and try it or reach out to the community....\nHas anyone put more than 2.2tb on the windows side of a machine with a larger hard drive?\nWill be running windows10.\n\nA: Mac Pro models introduced in 2013 or later do not have a 2.2 TB size limit for 64 bit Windows 10. If there is a limitation with respect to using the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows 10, then Windows 10 could be installed without the use of the Boot Camp Assistant. Although, you would still want to use the Boot Camp Assistant to download Windows Support Software (i.e. the Windows drivers).\nWindows runs on a Mac the same as any PC. Boot Camp refers to several entities, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a Boot Camp Assistant application which can download the Windows Support Software and simplify the installation of Windows.\n\n*There is the Boot Camp installer, which installs the Windows Support Software. \n\n*There is Boot Camp software installed in Windows that can configure hardware and set the default operating system to boot.\n\n*The volume (partition) where Windows is installed is given the label BOOTCAMP and thus is referred to as Boot Camp in the Apple documentation.\n\n\nA: I believe it had to do with block sizes and what the Apple Disk Utility could do formatting the bootcamp partition using exFAT. \nIf you are at all concerned, create a 2Tb partition while doing the install and then use a partitioning utility to change its size and modify the file system before restoring files and installing apps. Tools like Acronis, etc. should allow you to do this.\n", "Q: I have over 50,000 emails. How can I make the Mail app go faster? I have the macOS Mail app set up with my Google Gmail account using the IMAP integration. I have over 50,000 emails in my Gmail account, and the Mail application is starting to get a bit slow. For example, it takes several seconds to be able to open an email.\nWhat are my options? I want to continue using macOS Mail, but I don't necessarily need access to all historical messages because I can log into the Gmail website for that.\nI'm using Mail Version 13.4 (3608.80.23.2.2) on macOS Catalina 10.15.4 (19E287).\n\nA: I would start by deleting the account and then recreating it.  However, before you do, make sure you set the \"Download Attachments\" option in the Account Settings\nYou have three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*All - automatically downloads all attachments\n\n*Recent - mail from the past 15 months.\n\n*None - you have to manually download attachments.\n\n\nSo, as you're recreating your GMail account, select \"Recent\" or \"None.\"  Then, as it synchronizes with your email account, it will only download the attachments that fit those rules.\n\n\nA: If you only need the recent mail, you can limit how many emails gmail will serve via imap within the forwarding settings in gmail.\nYou should then \"rebuild\" your Mail.app inbox to remove cached messages.\n", "Q: Use Automator to open app as itself? I'm trying to figure out how to launch an app (in this case Discord) by default with added commands, and as such I figured I'd use Automator to create an app that runs a shell command.\nThe command in question is as follows:\nMKL_DEBUG_CPU_TYPE=5 /Applications/Discord.app/Contents/MacOS/Discord\n\nI put that on Automator, on the \"Execute shell script\" action, save it as an application, and when I put the app on the Dock, when I launch it, it shows two icons. Well, the cause of this is obvious, it's not launching the app itself with that command, what is in the dock is just a glorified terminal window which always launches the discord app with that command.\nMy question is: Is there a way I can do it so the command doesn't show two discord icons, and the discord window opens in itself?\nAlso because language barriers and bad communication are a thing, here are a few screenshots that illustrate my question better than words can\n The Automator app, on the Dock\n After launching the Automator shortcut, this is what happens\n This is what I'd prefer to happen\nEdit: I'm not sure if this was clear to you guys, I wasn't even aware of this, but it seems that MKL_DEBUG_CPU_TYPE=5 acts as a command itself, which then runs the mentioned app with it's own properties, it's not a command parameter that Discord.app recognizes\nEdit 2: Just to clear things out a bit more, when I run the Automator Application, it doesn't show the white dot that indicates the app is running, nor does it show the notifications number that stock Discord does, and that's what I'd like to happen on the Automator app, while hiding the real Discord icon from the dock\n\nA: Does it have to be Automator? \nI have an app which will take additional parameters at launch, which I do by saving an Applescript as a self-contained App.\nThe basic config is\ndo shell script \"\\\"/Applications/NameOfApp.app/Contents/MacOS/NameOfApp\\\" -param1 -param2 -param3\"\nquit\n\nEdit - Ah, reading more carefully, nope, that doesn't hide the icon of my applescript whilst it's running, & it will not quit until the launched app is itself first quit… but it wouldn't be confused for the app itself.\nThey are parent/child processes so will be displayed individually in the Dock.\nYou may be able to hide it like this question - Hide a running app from Dock?\n…which rather makes this answer a bit pointless ;-)\n\nA: Instead of launching the Application executable directly, use the open command on the app bundle. E.g.:\nopen \"/Applications/Discord.app\"\n\n\nA: This answer works only if you're using bash.\nSince you have Terminal open, as we see in the screenshot, the best way is to use an alias. It's the least friction way to do it. I myself have these aliases:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Run\nopen ~/.bash_profile\n\nOr use this answer to use GUI: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/371665/313842 \n\n*Add a line among other aliases:\nalias discordapp=\"MKL_DEBUG_CPU_TYPE=5 /Applications/Discord.app/Contents/MacOS/Discord\"\n\n\n*Then run either of:\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n. ~/.bash_profile\n\nThe best part is, you get autocomplete too. Type some initial letters of the alias, & hit tab. \nYou can also add more arguments to the command. For example, I run this:\noctaveg --force-gui\n\noctaveg as defined above. \n\nA: Ok I found a workaround and it sure does what I wanted.\nBasically you go to the app's /Content/MacOS directory, find the main executable (so in my case it's Discord), rename it to something else, like Disicord or whatever you want. Then sudo nanointo the same directory, and write \"MKL_DEBUG_CPU_TYPE=5 [PathToExecutable]/[CurrentRenamedExecutableName]\", and voilà, you get both the app to launch with that mode on, and you inherit both the icon and the notifications\nHOWEVER, ATTENTION!!!! This seems to pose a somewhat relevant security threat, as any permissions submitted by the application get assigned to sh, and that doesn't sound like a smart thing to do, so watch out if you do this\n", "Q: How to prevent iCloud from downloading (storing) certain files in an Xcode project in iCloud? I have enabled storing Desktop & Document Folders in iCloud. I keep my Xcode projects on Desktop.

This is very tedious as I then have to click on each one of them one-by-one to re-download.\nHow can I prevent iCloud from downloading my files in this manner, for this specific Xcode project?\nI have tried disabling iCloud for Desktop, but this results in me losing all my Desktop folders/files, so I could rather not go this route.\n\nA: Such an option to force iCloud to keep some files would be nice. In the meantime, you can check OneDrive. It fits this purpose. You can decide if some files/ folders have to be kept offline.\nA way is to use aliases. Then again, you'd have to check if Xcode can work with that. \n\n\n*\n\n*Whichever files/ folders are required offline, move them to a non-iCloud-synced place.\n\n*Make their aliases and keep them in place of the original files/folders.\n\n*If you need to sync those files somewhere else too, make another copy in iCloud. \n\n\nIf aliases don't work, check out symlinks. \n", "Q: Search inside documents with spotlight For years I had used spotlight to search inside of plain text files and other documents.

Most users use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows 10. You do not have to use the Boot Camp Assistant, however the easiest way to download the Windows Support Software (the drivers) is to use the Boot Camp Assistant. Once you have the Windows Support Software, you can install using a flash drive if you wish. \n\nYou can use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Windows Support Software without actually creating a partition and installing Windows.\n\nYou will not need hybrid partitioning to run Windows 10 on your Mac. This is true whether or not you use the Boot Camp Assistant to install.\n", "Q: Possible to selectively choose folders to sync at set-up time of OneDrive for macOS? Question: \n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to configure through the Terminal or otherwise which folders to selectively sync in the OneDrive app for macOS?\n\n*Or, to select the folders to sync during the setup procedure of the app?\nBackground:\nI am having trouble getting OneDrive setup on a new iMac running macOS Catalina 10.15.4. After installing the app from the Mac App Store and linking my Microsoft account, the app immediately start syncing. So far, so good. But then I have two related issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*The app starts syncing all the content, which is about 250GB, and which is not what I want (it would drain my ISP quota). I want to exclude a certain big (Backup) folder from syncing.\n\n*However, trying to do selective syncing configured, I bump into the spinning beachball when trying to adjust the OneDrive settings. It's almost impossible to get to the correct setting; but if I get there and uncheck the relevant folders I get a popup from Onedrive telling me it can't do it because of some content that first needs to be uploaded. (don't have a screenshot right now, as it's hard to reproduce).\nUnfortunately, when setting up OneDrive, there is no option to specify what folders to sync. (Dropbox, for instance has such a feature).\nSo, is there any way for me to reliably set the folders to sync with OneDrive, without having to download the full 250GB of my OneDrive folder?\nBTW, I have the OneDrive app running successfully on an older iMac; but I think that was already setup before I started backing up to OneDrive.\n\nA: I have run into and struggled with the exact same issue with setting up OneDrive app for macOS. Here's what I have observed setting it up on multiple personal Macs.\nSoon after logging into the app, it appears to start syncing all the files and folders, and trying to access the app preferences result in a spinning beachball. While it appears that the app is trying to download all the data from your OneDrive cloud storage, in reality that's not the case.\nWhat's happening is that the app is fetching the metadata for all the files on your cloud storage without actually downloading the files themselves. I have experienced this process to take unusually long time, thereby giving an impression that it's trying to download all the files.\nAlso, the app by defaults comes configured with a setting called Files On-Demand enabled. Here's how it looks like in the app preferences window:\n\nWhat this does it gives you an impression that all the files and folders are available in Finder. However, when you try to access any by trying to copy or open, the app actually starts downloading the file. The Finder simply shows the file icon normally and even trying to perform a Quick Look triggers a download.\nIn my experience, the app is programmed such that the app preferences are not accessible until this initial fetching of metadata is complete. But as soon as this initial fetching of metadata is complete, the app preferences become accessible, and then you can choose the folders to sync selectively. If you get an error when trying to select some folders and save, try relaunching the app.\nOnce you have selected the desired folders, you may also want to turn off Files On-Demand. Doing so would actually download the files for the selected folders and would even let you work with them in offline mode.\nI find this feature of the app very annoying. Also, I feel that the overall UX of the app is very confusing and frustrating. You can consider sharing feedback on this with Microsoft here: OneDrive on Mac - Feature Suggestions for Microsoft OneDrive.\nNow to address your specific queries:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Is it possible to configure through the Terminal or otherwise which folders to selectively sync in the OneDrive app for macOS?\n  \n\nI can't conclusively answer this in no, but there aren't any publicly known command-line that can do this.\n\nOr, to select the folders to sync during the setup procedure of the app?\n\nI have not found this feature present in the current version of the app.\n\nA: No - you have to trust that your version is ready for Files On-Demand and makes the correct decision about loading stub folders and stub files. You can’t interrupt the process and try to save time, you will just end up delaying the first sync.\n(Ask me how I know as my OneDrive just got bumped from 2 TB to 4 TB of space.)\nThe first sync is IO intensive, network intensive, but does not actually use space on the Mac. However, Apple space measuring tools see the files as actually being there - so you may have a situation where you see 750 GB of files present on a 256 GB drive.\n", "Q: How can I turn on the macOS firewall from a script I'm setting up a new Mac Mini and I am using a script assembled from commands that I've accumulated over the years to set defaults, create directory structures, install software, and otherwise customize my Macs the way I want them.

Our CMDB states that these machines are in Room A; however, another staff member states that they are in Room B. The location matters in this particular instance.\nSince the subnets are the same for both rooms, we have no way of remotely identifying the location network-wise. I could, however, identify the location if I were to see through the webcam. I have SSH'd into Machine1, downloaded ffmpeg via curl and used this post to attempt taking a photo using the built-in camera. \nEverything works well, except that Terminal does not have permission to access the web cam. Is there a command or CLI tool that allows me to set this permission? \nNote that I am attempting to avoid enabling screen share to perform this permission setting task as I see it as more required cleanup in the end.\n\nA: There is no documented workaround to short circuit this security control on macOS Catalina. \nMy recommendation is to use Screen Sharing and Remote Desktop since you can kickstart that on and off by command. Based on whether your macs are MDM managed, you may not be able to remotely grant access to the physical machines and have to physically go in or trace the ethernet MAC address to switch ports on the switch.\nPossibly if you have only one version of macOS there’s something that might be possible, but the question as stands it would be best to use AppleRemote Desktop as the most trusted / privileged tool to remotely compromise the security of these Macs. You’re up against protections to prevent stealthy snooping, so the more you are acting like a proper remote administration, the less friction you will have and once Remote Desktop is set, cleanup is scriptable and very easy (and logged).\nThese controls must be user initiated, even with a fully functioning MDM like JAMF. You can report if a user has allowed or denied this, but Apple is blocking this pretty effectively in Summer 2020. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/35287/zoom-app-asks-for-admin-credentials-when-use-microphone-and-camera#responseChild200127\n", "Q: What is a typical Notability's file size?

If you are so worried that someone might be able to crack your password, simply enable FileVault Encryption and a Firmware Password. This will prevent others from using Recovery Mode attacks which is the only way possible to extract the password hash and crack your Mac password. Even if your Mac login password's hash is extracted, it is very difficult to crack and may even take days for dedicated applications to crack. Your password would be just as secure whether it was your regular Mac password or a 1Password generated password as long as you have FileVault and a Firmware Password turned on.

There is the option of clicking the cogwheel at the top menu bar, but I was looking for a shortcut-able way.\n\nA: I have a few different solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*This applescript immediately kills all speech that is running on your computer:\n\n\n\ndo shell script \"killall com.apple.speech.speechsynthesisd\"\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Alternatively, you could have a single script that checks to see if the speech is running and will kill that particular speech, (basically simulates the shortcut for alt-esc, BUT you can add the rate function to the script). I found a script online a while back that does this. Here's the link. I also made my own version that changes the rate (at the bottom of the post). The rate control is where it says [[rate 800]]. This script copies text to the clipboard and adds '[[rate 800]]' which apple tts voices interpret as a command to change to that rate. The clipboard is read at the modified speed. You can adjust up to like 1000 or something. \n\n*However, if you really just want to make your mac's default text to speech rate faster (which is what I suspect you are using this script for), I highly recommend you just change the default rate using a little hack I came up with a while back (It allows you to go up to 720 WPM).

After various fruitless attempts at restarting and hoping for the install to happen, I decided to try installing manually and downloaded the update. I ran the installer and got an error message telling me I didn't have enough disk space. This was odd as I had about 15Gb, which I thought would be enough.\nAfter clearing out some old files I eventually got to 28Gb free and tried to install the update again. It still failed with the message that there wasn't enough disk space. Using the DaisyDisk utility I looked at how much disk space I had and noticed that of the 28Gb that was free, only 10Gb was really free and the other 18Gb was purgeable. My guess is that the Installer program only checks truly free space and given that the actual update itself is around 9Gb, it probably decided that there wasn't enough space to do an install.\nSo I used the DaisyDisk utility to do a proper purge of the purgeable space i.e. truly cleaning the files in it off the disk. I now had 28Gb of genuine free space and the install proceeded without a hitch. If the install keeps failing using the Software Update approach, it may be an idea to try a manual install as that seems to at least give you an error message to work with.\n", "Q: Change the shell that functions use In my current terminal setup, I make use of zsh; it's my default shell.

Even though my default shell is zsh and I aliased sh(Apple's bash) command to bash(the bash from Homebrew) command, the function I've defined still defaults to using sh and hence, my function doesn't/can't function. I've also changed the shebang at the head of the file defining my custom function but no help.\nHow can I make that function I've defined default to using the bash installed from Homebrew?\n\nA: You can turn the function into a shell script and define the shell to be used in the first line\n#!/usr/local/bin/bash\n\n# the content of your function goes here\n\nThen make the shell script executable and put it somewhere into your PATH.\n\nA: The other approach will work, but would fail if /usr/local/bin/bash does not exist.\nIf you want to ensure future compatibility, I'd recommend you specify the shebang line using /usr/bin/env, which ensures your environment uses the path to find the first version of the binary (bash).\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n# the content of your script\n\nIf you have configured your environment to search /user/local/bin first, this will function as you expect.\nYou can check where bash exists in your path with:\n$ which -a bash\n\nWhich outputs the following on my system:\n/usr/local/bin/bash\n/bin/bash\n\n", "Q: Connect to server - password syntax (symbols) confusing the expression I'd like to connect to my local server using the following expression in Finder/Go/Connect to server: afp://username:password@serverIP.local\nMy password is using characters which I'm pretty sure are confusing the readability of this expression (e.g. @, %, perhaps other characters) - and I know nothing about UNIX.

The absolute path to the app is /usr/local/Cellar/macvim/xxxxxx/MacVim.app, with xxxxxx the version number. MacVim version number is updated often.\nNow I like my app to be accessible through the Dock and the Launchpad. I have created a symlink in /Applications pointing to /usr/local/Cellar/macvim/8.2-163_2/MacVim.app (for now) so MacVim.app is visible in the Launchpad, and I dragged the symlink in the Dock to access it quickly. Of course, next time MacVim is updated, the version will change and I will have to fix the symlink.\nWhat can I do to have a more permanent solution that does not require fixing the symlink every time MacVim is updated?\nThe solution I thought could work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a crontab to regularly update the symlink\n\n*Or use launchctl to do the same\n\n*Configure homebrew, if possible, to use the same directory always\n\n*Configure homebrew to hook some script after updating MacVim to update symlink\n\n*Create a node with custom driver that open(), read() and close() the right file\n\n\nI implemented solution #1 and #2 in the past, but I find it quite messy. Every minute, the command to update the symlink is run, but 99.99% of the time it does nothing Looks more like a hacky solution to me. If possible, I would prefer to run the command when it is needed only. Solution #3 and #4 are much better, but I haven't found anything about hook in homebrew. And solution #5 seems a bit hardcore for such a trivial task.\nOr am I missing something obvious?\nA bit more explanations as requested in comment\nSolution 1\nA one line command in the crontab can be used:\n* * * * * ln -fs \"$(find '/usr/local/Cellar/macvim' -name 'MacVim.app' | head -n 1)\" /Applications/MacVim.app\n\nSolution 2\nSame as crontab, but using a scheduled task. I don't find this solution particularly better than the crontab except it is using a more \"modern\" scheduler.\nSolution 3 and 4\nThat's a guess, but I was hoping there were some feature in homebrew to run a command after a package is being updated. Then I would simply run the same command as in the crontab when MacVim is updated. What I like with this solution, is that the command is only run when it is needed, not every minute.\nSolution 5\nI haven't looked in depth in this solution as it is definitely more advanced. I only know it is possible to create a custom character device with a custom driver. The only requirement is to implement the open, read and close command. So technically, everytime the system asks for /Applications/MacVim.app, what it really does being the scene is to list the content of the folder /usr/local/Cellar/macvim, take the first folder in the list, and read the content of the MacVim.app file in the said folder. Similar to a symlink, but specific to my need.\n\nA: Just symlink to /usr/local/opt/macvim/MacVim.app instead, this path remains stable (/usr/local/opt/macvim is a symlink maintained by HomeBrew which points to the currently installed version within /usr/local/Cellar/macvim).\n", "Q: How to turn off the Siri dictation \"beep\" sound on macOS Catalina?

I'm having some issues with my 16 inch MacBook Pro. It restarts and gives me the \"Your computer was restarted because of a problem.\" prompt. It has done that 5 or 6 times so far. I was advised to do a recovery.\nApparently, you can reinstall macOS without wiping the disk. You can also reinstall and wipe as well. And if you go even further, you can reinstall and start from scratch without any data or apps. \nIs it preferable to go all the way and start from the beginning, like how it was on the day it shipped?\n\nA: Yes - it’s the perfect time and often sets you up for the best experience.\nYour question is hard to answer absolutely since it does take a bit more time and some people don’t have confidence or skill in their backups. You can’t get the image Apple provides since it has non-registered versions of the free apps to claim. But on all the supported OS (N-2 with N being Catalina on October 1, 2020) are free and you can download them easily after an erase. I especially recommend an erase install if you want to be sure the hardware isn’t the cause of issues. You don’t have a better test than this in my experience.\nInstalling on top of a corrupt partition / volume / system won’t fix that, but will restore the OS cleanly. Make a backup and check your important files are intact on the backup and erase-install is my go to move.\nYou get to test a clean slate and then do the erase a second time if needed then restore files back. It takes a little extra time, but you never have to redo a step and build confidence the hardware is good sooner than an overlay install.\n", "Q: How can I boot Windows bootable USB for Mac book pro 2018 mojave?

It is turned on by default.\n\n\nYou can learn more about by going to this Apple Support article:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211094\nHere's a list of all the current Apple laptops that have the Battery Health feature available:\nMacBook Air\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2018)\n\n*MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2019)\n\n*MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2020)\nMacBook Pro\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (13-inch, Late 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports)\n\n*MacBook Pro (13-inch, Late 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)\n\n*MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2016)\n\n*MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports)\n\n*MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2017, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)\n\n*MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2017)\n\n*MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2018, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)\n\n*MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2018)\n\n*MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2019, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports)\n\n*MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2019, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)\n\n*MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2019)\n\n*MacBook Pro (16-inch, Late 2019)\n\n*MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2020, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports)\n\n*MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2020, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)\n\nA: It looks like, even if the official Apple article about the feature which is here does not tell anything about it, according to this and this article, the feature is only supported on laptops which has  thunderbolt 3 ports. That means all MacBook Pro models released since late 2016 and the Retina-capable MacBook Air models released since 2018. \n", "Q: What do numbers in red circles mean on launcher icons? What do these numbers mean on Mac?\n\nI am on an iMac running Catalina.\n\nA: The number on App Store icon indicates the number of available app updates. The number on the System Preferences icon depends on what option in System Preferences also shows the number. Often it is that there is a software update to macOS available.\nIn some apps, it's the number of notifications: like email, or messages.\n\nA: The launcher you see towards the bottom of your Mac is called the Dock, a prominent part of macOS user experience. You can learn more about the Dock in macOS here\nThe red circle you see on an app icon is called a Badge. Quoting from the macOS Human Interface Guidelines - Badging section:\n\nBadging\nApps can display a small red oval containing a white number on their Dock icon to indicate when new interesting—but noncritical—information is available. For example, App Store uses badging to indicate the number of available app updates; when there are no updates available, the badge disappears.\n\n\n", "Q: Why my desktop displays location path of the chosen image?

I have a website document root in a folder under Documents. For the website to run on my local machine the permissions of ~/Documents folder must be 755.\nAs soon as I change a file in the website, the permissions on ~/Documents immediately changes from 755 to 700, causing the website to give a \"Forbidden\" message.\nI am guessing that the iCloud sync function is resetting the permission of ~/Documents. How do i prevent this from happening?\nI have tried \"chflags uchg Documents\", but it still resets to 700.\n\nA: I had the same problem, trying to run a server as an unprivileged user that needs read access to Documents, while Documents is in iCloud Drive. Normal UNIX file permissions didn't stick. I solved it by using  ACLs to grant access.\nchmod +a \"_www allow list,search\" Documents\nIn this example _www is the unprivileged user your server is running as. Use ps axu to find out what user that is for you.\nThe folders inside Documents should work like normal with UNIX file permission bits, so you only have to do this for the Documents folder itself.\nFor more info on ACLs, see here here and man chmod.\n", "Q: How can I achieve USB 3.0 transfer speeds (5 Gbps) on my iPhone? All lightning cables that I have used with my iPhone up until now have transferred data at a maximum of 480 Mbps. This is indicative of USB 2.0 connector speeds. \nHowever, after researching this topic I'm quite confused. How do I transfer data between my Mac and my iPhone at USB 3.0 speeds? Do I need to lighting to USB C cable? Are there any lightning cables that transfer data at USB 3.0 speeds? Does my iPhone even support USB 3.0 speeds? I'm really confused and I can't find specifications for this anywhere. \nWhat's even stranger is that my iPad Pro 11 can transfer data at USB 3.0 speeds via the USB port—and that's the only time I've ever seen such speed between a macOS and an iOS device. \nI would like to know to achieve USB 3.0 speeds while transferring data to my iPhone. To do this, I would like to know, which iPhones support data transfer at USB 3.0 speeds in the first place, and which cable I need to use to transfer data at USB 3.0 speeds.\n\nA: The only iDevivce that support USB 3.0 speeds over the lightning connector is the iPad Pro released in 2015.  Current iPad Pro Tablets with the USB-C connector support USB 3.\nAll other devices only support 2.0.\n\nDo I need to lighting to USB C cable?\n\nUSB-C is just the physical port type.  To get USB 3 speeds, you need at least a USB 3.0 port (blue connector in the Type A connector).    As for the the specific port specification, Apple takes its classic “remain vague” tactic.  All it says is it’s connectivity is “USB-C” not which USB spec it conforms to (i.e. USB 3.1 Gen 1).\n", "Q: Make command line app behave like a normal macOS app? Is it possible to make a command line app  behave and act like a normal Cocoa app?\nI want to be able to set command line app Zathura, for example, as a default pdf viewer.\nI want it to appear in Alfred/Spotlight when I search for it, and if an instance is already running, typing \"Zathura\" and then Return would bring up that instance instead starting a new one.\n\nA: There is an app called Platypus which will take shell scripts or python scripts and make them into an app that you can just double click to run.

There's no problem with inner insulation part and the MagSafe working just fine when plugged to my MBP (I seal up the broken part with electrical tape). \nMy question is, is it safe to use MagSafe with broken outer insulation (some wires are cutted out)? \nWill it damage my MBP especially the logicboard in long term? What the purpose of the outer insulation part?\nUpdate : I have already sealed the cable when I created the post, so I will use image I found on the net to illustrate the situation.\n\nThis is my magsafe look like after sealed by electrical tape\n\n\n\nA: Will it damage the logic board?\nNo.  The shielding is also the ground conductor.  So, you need it for two reasons.  If you cut it, you’ll be breaking the MacBook’s connection to ground which of course will affect it’s ability to function.  It’s like disconnecting the negative battery terminal from your car or any other battery power source - it will fail to function.\nWill the \"cracked\" wire of a MacBook charger eletrocute me\nIt’s not “dangerous” to you, but if you were to somehow send voltage down this line you could damage your charger and/or Mac.  However, those vintage Mac laptops had a separate (replaceable) DC-in board that would take the brunt of any surge.  If there was damage, it would be contained there.\n\nA: I guess tha the \"coaxial\" part you refer to is actually just a shield. The shield is made from a fine wire that is \"braided\", and runs the length of the cable. I'm not privy to Apple's designs or schematics, but most likely the shield is there for EMC (electromagnetic compatibility), and not as a current-conducting ground wire. Using a shield as a conductor would be unusual to say the least. \nThat said, any damage to the shield is unlikely to affect the function of your cable. \nHowever, the insulation on the wires in the cable should be checked for evidence of cracking, fraying or other deterioration. It's important all of the inner wires (inside the shield) are in good condition. You have done the right thing by mending the cable with electrical tape: it's an insulator and it's flexible. As long as the electrical tape is in place, and in good condition, I don't believe the cable poses any risk to you, or to your Mac. \nI had the same problem as you recently on my Magsafe cable. The outer insulation in one area on the cable just began breaking down, and falling off the cable! I've never seen wiring insulation behave like this. I also used electrical tape as a temporary solution. I was able to find this replacement Magsafe cable on Amazon. This cable allows me to use one of the new USB-C chargers to charge my 2011 Macbook Pro. I've been using it for several months now & it works. \nIt appears from the picture you have the newer Magsafe 2 connector.. Consequently, the cable I bought will not work for you. However, it seems they also have a version for the USB-C to Magsafe 2 cable which may suit your situation. \n", "Q: Create bootable macOS USB for a non Apple computer I tried several ways to create a bootable macOS USB for a non Apple personal computer.

Apple, unlike Microsoft doesn't license its operating system for running on commodity PCs.\n\nIt seems that it only works on Mac.

However there’s only “British” and “International – PC” neither of which match the British PC layout. Is there a way to change the keyboard layout to match the macOS layout?\n\nA: I think iOS 14 may have British PC as an option now.\nIf not, or if you can't upgrade, there’s no way yet to add or customize hardware layouts in iOS, even via an app, as far as I know. You can ask Apple to add this feature via\nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback\n", "Q: No Video Output on Second Screen During Startup? I have a 2018 Mac Mini with two screens attached; one is a 4k screen connected via HDMI, the other is an old 20\" Cinema Display attached through a USB-C to DVI adapter.\nNow, when started up this works great; the 4k screen looks amazing, and the old cinema display is a handy second monitor for throwing references, YouTube videos etc. onto to avoid cluttering my main workspace.\nThe problem is, during startup the Mac Mini only seems to want to output video to the cinema display; the 4k display receives no video at all. The only way to get output to the 4k display is to ensure the cinema display is physically disconnected during startup; even if I disconnect its power from the wall socket, as long as the USB-C to DVI adapter is connected to the Mac Mini, macOS still considers that monitor to be connected.\nIt also doesn't seem to matter how I setup the twin monitors; for example if I set the cinema display to mirror the 4k display (not that I want to do this) then I still only get output to the one screen during startup.\nSo my question is, is there some way I can set HDMI/my 4k display as the default for video output during startup? Some NVRAM setting or such?\n\nA: The 'one screen at boot' is pretty standard behaviour, afaik. I see it on all the Mac Pros here. \nWhich screen that ought to be is dependant on which is set as Primary in System Prefs > Displays > Arrangement - it's the one with the menu bar, which can be dragged to another display to set Primary.\n\nThat it still displays the same behaviour with one screen switched off is because it still recognises it as being attached. When you detach it completely, then basically you get an \"Oops, Primary is missing, let's find one we can use temporarily.\"\n", "Q: How can I fix my iPad Magic Keyboard when everything works except the trackpad? I’ve got the Magic Keyboard (the one with the hinge that holds the iPad Pro suspended in air above the number keys) and everything works except the trackpad. I can go into the settings app General > Keyboard > Hardware Keyboard and the brightness reacts when I slide the control.\n\nWhat can be done to fix this so the trackpad works?\n\nA: This is mostly a software issue and seldom a hardware issue. You can triage this by pairing a Bluetooth mouse and if it and then trackpad are broken, you can know it’s a software issue.\n\nThe first time this happened, Apple sent a replacement trackpad and while that was in transit, iOS  / iPadOS 13.5.1 (17F80) was released. Since the update, I have had no crashes of the pointeruid process, and also had the hardware  exchanged.\nI also was able to attach a Bluetooth mouse and it fails to work when my magic device wasn’t working so I’m pretty sure the crashing process is the direct reason the pointer doesn’t draw on screen.\nI have had their recur more often in the last 6 months. So far, it’s always been software, but I’m sure it can happen with hardware failure, but for me this is a software issue and restarting the iPad generally, but not always cures it.\n\nDue to the timing, I believe it was software and not hardware, but I can't be sure. I would recommend contacting Apple Support if you can't check for crashes or still have issues with your device. I'll leave the rest of the initial troubleshooting below in case it helps others find their cursor on iPadOS.\nIn Xcode I see the process pointeruid crashing quite often. My working theory is that this crashes and if it doesn't restart, I lack a pointer and when I restarted the iPad, it was crashing before I could see the pointer ever draw.\nHardware Model:      iPad8,9\nProcess:             pointeruid [283]\nPath:                /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PointerUIServices.framework/Support/pointeruid\nIdentifier:          pointeruid\nVersion:             ???\nCode Type:           ARM-64 (Native)\nRole:                Unspecified\nParent Process:      launchd [1]\nCoalition:           com.apple.PointerUI.pointeruid [300]\n\n\nDate/Time:           2020-05-28 11:17:52.8551 -0500\nLaunch Time:         2020-05-28 11:17:52.5865 -0500\nOS Version:          iPhone OS 13.5 (17F75)\nRelease Type:        User\nBaseband Version:    n/a\nReport Version:      104\n\nException Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)\nException Subtype: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0000000000000068\nVM Region Info: 0x68 is not in any region.

I’m received an engineering call back and they will ship a new keyboard to me so they can have this back. Not sure they will scrap it or analyze it, but for me I’ll wait for a second keyboard to test.\n\nThe triage steps I didn’t think of are as follows:\n\n*\n\n*open Accessability in general settings\n\nWhen the keyboard is connected, you should see pointer control. Remove the iPad from the keyboard and the pointer option should vanish instantly. Reconnect and then make sure you turn off all the items: Automatically Hide, etc... and make the color / size large to be sure it’s not on screen and not visible.\n\nIf your connectors are dirty, you won’t get the immediate change in pointer control. Also, inspect your keyboard closely under a brigh light for any hairline cracks or physical damage. If it got wet, that could cause the trackpad to fail.\n\nA: Apparently you are not alone. It appears to be a widely experienced issue. Here's an extended discussion on the MacRumors forums:\n\n*\n\n*https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/magic-keyboard-trackpad-stopped-working.2233242/\nGoing through the discussion you'd see that there's no uniform approach that has resolved the issue. A variety of things have worked from cleaning the connectors, hard and soft restarting the iPad, reinstalling the iPadOS etc. People appear to have experienced the issue with iPadOS 13.4.1 as well, so it could very well not just be a software issue.\nIt's not clear from the discussions if it's a hardware bug or a software bug. Also, the folks at Apple Support are apparently unprepared too with responses like \"never heard before\".\nI guess contacting Apple support may still be a good idea, hoping they have heard enough to call for an investigation and come up with an appropriate.\n", "Q: Macbook slows down when connected to external monitor and power supply I have a Macbook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012) with the following configuration: 2.3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7, 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3, Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 MB\nI use Dell P2419H as my external monitor which I connect my macbook via HDMI cable.

LG 27MD5KA-B).\nI wanted to know if through an adapter, I could connect the old MBP from its Mini-DisplayPort to the USB-C of the monitor and have a video signal.\nThis Apple StackExchange question does not really answer my question because it is about USB-A to USB-C. This Apple KB (section System requirements and compatible Mac models, paragraphe before the last one) says no, but does not specify Mini-Display Port. Finally, the answer to this Apple StackExchange question says no but then says that \"Thunderbolt is a protocol for combining PCI express data with DisplayPort video protocols\" (this web page explains the differences and similarities between Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C) and then says \"DisplayPort embedded over USB 3.1/Type-C\".\nI am therefore a bit confused: Mini-DisplayPort (a video protocol) uses a Thunderbolt connector and DisplayPort is embedded over USB 3-1/Type-C…\nMy question: What happens if I buy a cable like this and connect it between my old MBP and my LG UltraFine 5K Monitor?\n\n\nA: That cable won’t work.\nFirst, the monitor doesn’t have a DisplayPort input nor does it have a USB upstream port.  It has a Thunderbolt 3 port that uses the USB Type C connector.  The USB-C down stream ports are supplied by the Thunderbolt connection. \nSecondly, even though TB is backward compatible, it’s one way.  So, a laptop with a TB 3 port can work with a TB 1 or 2 device, but a TB 3 device can’t work with a TB 1/2 laptop port.  The adapter can’t add capabilities to a machine that doesn’t already have.\n\nA: \nI wanted to know if through an adapter, I could connect the old MBP from its Mini-DisplayPort to the USB-C of the monitor and have a video signal.\n\nIt's possible but unlikely.\nDisplayPort cables like the example you gave are largely passive devices and so are bi-directional and don't need any drivers or such.  They'll have a little electronic \"tag\" in the connector to tell the host and device it's plugged in, and that's about it for any electronics in the cable.  The DisplayPort host and device will negotiate how many channels are available, resolutions available, and so forth.  DisplayPort has had a lot of revisions over the years but it has kept backward and forward compatibility through those revisions.\nWhat can be a problem is many of these high end displays are more like a multifunction dock than just a display.  They may require USB and/or Thunderbolt to supply an image on the screen.  It's often the case with displays like this will not be using DisplayPort for video but instead using video over Thunderbolt, which is apparently a thing.\nGenerally a USB-C display is possible to work with a mini-DP to USB-C passive cable but you'll get only video, and possibly sound if the display has speakers or an output for speakers.  Any built-in camera, USB ports, hand dryers, and towel dispensers will not work.  They will need the power and/or data channels that USB-C has but mini-DP does not.\nIt won't hurt to try the old computer and new display.  You can buy the cable from a place with a good return policy or be prepared to \"eat\" the cost if it doesn't work.  Even then the cable might come in handy in the future as I expect USB-C and mini-DP to be around for a while.\n\nA: What if you were to try these two products:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Apple-Thunderbolt-USB-C-Adapter/dp/B01MQ26QIY\nhttps://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD862LL/A/apple-thunderbolt-cable-05-m\n...the first one is bidirectional.\n", "Q: How to move a window from one screen to another and maximise in one go?

DO NOT RELEASE the selected app yet.\n\n*Finally, drag/position the selected app such that it is between two of the desktop thumbnails in the \"ribbon\". Release the app. The app is now full screen, and located between the two desktops.\n", "Q: Duplicate birthday calendar entries After my upgrade to Catalina 10.15 I started getting duplicate birthdays and duplicate contacts on my Mac. I was able to take care of the duplicate contacts by deleting the unneeded contact after trial and error. I ended up using the note section to put a random letter in my phone contacts and seeing which one updated on my Mac and seeing which one updated. Then I deleted the one that didn't update. \nRegarding duplicate birthdays I read previous posts and on my Mac unchecked, in Contacts, \"Birthdays\" and rechecked it again, waited, then unchecked and rechecked it. I went back into Calendar on my Mac and the duplicate birthdates were gone. I've checked it several times since and so far so good.\nDoes anyone else have a suggestion?\n\nA: I had the same problem recently after installing MacOS 12.1, Monterey. It was fixed by following:\n\n*\n\n*Open Contacts,\n\n\n*Click the Card menu (top of screen), choose Look for duplicates, choose Merge.\nEach pair of duplicate cards will be merged into a single card that contains all the information from both cards. (I'm not sure what would happen if there were two cards for one person but one contained old (outdated) info and the other contained recent (current) info.)\n\n\n*Finally, go to Calendar, where only one set of birthdays should be seen.\n", "Q: iPhone Button Combo to View Owner Info? Is there a button combo you can use on a locked iPhone to view it's owner info?\nI once left my phone at airport security, and they called me on the PA system and showed me how they pressed a button combo to view the owner info.  I don't remember what the combo was.  I've found someone's phone now and would like to do the same to see if I can return it to them.\n\nA: You can tap on the Emergency button on the iPhone lock screen to access Medical ID. If a user has set Medical ID and has enabled it's display on the lock screen, the owner information can be obtained.\nHere's how you can access it as well as set it up.\n\n\n*\n\n*Suppose you found a random iPhone and attempt to unlock it. After failing to authenticate via Touch ID/Face ID, the iPhone would present you with the lock screen. It would look somewhat similar to this:\n\n\n*Tap on Emergency and it would take you to the Emergency Call screen. If the owner has already setup Medical ID, it would be shown in the bottom left corner.\n\n\n*You can tap on the Medical ID button to view the owner info. Important identifying information such as owner name, photo, height etc. along with Emergency contact numbers can be accessed if set.\n\n\n*If you wish to set the Medical ID information for your own iPhone and want the same to be accessible via the lock screen, go to Settings app → Health → Medical ID and tap Edit to provide your information. Once done, enable Show When Locked under Emergency Access.\n\n", "Q: Fans blaring again after a brief hardware fix My 2017 MacBook Air began having a problem with a high kernel task and high CPU with fans blaring. I did a hardware test and it said there may be an issue with the SMC PFM006, there may be an issue with the power management system PPN001.\nAfter reading online that it may be to do with the track pad's thermal sensor I took the Mac apart and disconnected then reconnected the track pad. I and also cleared the dust of the machine. I did the hardware test again and it was all clear. So I began downloading all the software that I deleted while  troubleshooting and during the downloads the problem came back. \nIt's giving out the same hardware errors again, however now the system seems to run a little smoother, but the fans are still blaring. Any advice? \n\nA: \nIt's giving out the same hardware errors again, however now the system seems to run a little smoother, but the fans are still blaring. Any advice? \n\nChange the track pad.\nCleaning things out probably helped improve the efficiency of the cooling but it doesn't fix a faulty sensor.  If you hare still getting hardware errors, it means you have a problem with the hardware.  Software (hacks) aren't going to solve a physical issue.  It's like hearing a noise in your car and installing a louder radio and speakers to cover it up.  In the end, the problem is still there.\nYou're on the right track and you've done good diagnostics, you just have to take it the last mile and do the hardware fix.\n\nA: I'd download an app like TG Pro that lets you monitor the temperature of all the sensors along with the speed of the fans. This will help you isolate any problem if there is one. If all sensors register low temp and the fan is maxed out you obviously have a fan issue. The app is $10 but has a free trial.\n\nA: If this is the same mac that throws known issues with power management - I would seek repair.\n\n\n*\n\n*kernel_task high CPU and fans going crazy, no heat from mac itself\n\n*Fans blaring again after a brief hardware fix\n\nA: This was all fixed by buying a replacement trackpad for £20 on eBay!\n", "Q: A1398 2015 - inadequate fan behaviour/noise I'm toasted. My long-awaited purchase disappoints me extremely.\nI'm a quietness-freak. One of the main reasons to get Macbook Pro 15\" 2.8, R9 M370X was Apple's tendency to keep hardware hot but quiet, and it's speakers.\nDespite that the fans on it are mad. While you're using CPU only it's about \"ok\", but I had to undervolt and limit the TDP to ~35W to make the noise about reasonable. Speeds are down. Temps - 50-60C on idle, up to 80-85 on load. \nWhen R9 M370X is involved performing even lightest things it goes insane though. GPU may simply be active but doing nothing, I play YT video and fans ramp up to 50% while CPU is no more than 70C and GPU ~65C.\nSo, 1-st problem - fans start to be much more aggressive when dGPU is on.\nWhen I do something (even lightest) in Cinema 4D it may be ~65C CPU and ~60 GPU it goes full blast. Than at least a minute after I stopped working it goes on before calming down. Even when it's 55C already it still goes. \nSo, second - fan speeds are much excessive and aren't adequate to temps.\nThan I tried MacsFanControl (TG Pro, doesn't matter) to lower the speeds. Despite I managed to get ~70-80C on load a minute later CPU went 800ghz flat! And nothing makes it speed up, I have to give the control back to system, it spins 6000rpm for a couple of minutes and than recovers. In Windows it's the same. \nSo, third problem - inadequate and unavoidable artificial throttling. \nI'm getting mad. I can't bare this noise. Even lightest photo editing in C1 makes it shout out loud despite it's pretty cool, not speaking of C4D which is my main tool.\nFans are clean, paste is new (MX-4)\nIs this a normal for this model? Does 2014 GT 750M does the same? How to f*** make it work silently, or at least reasonably?\nHelp me please. It doesn't give the performance nor comfort I bought it for, I'm so sad...\n\nA: I understand how frustrating this can be when you set your expectations and they don't quite line up with what reality is giving you.\nIn my comments, I stated \"If you want complete silence with performance, you bought the wrong product - you need a desktop with much more efficient cooling.\"  I know you're not expecting complete silence, but you've got the wrong product for the job you're asking the machine to do.  Here's why...\nThe most top of the line MacBook Pro from 2015 comes with an Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM and a discrete GPU, an AMD Radeon R9 M370X with 2 GB of dedicated VRAM\nThe GPU VRAM recommendations from Maxon Cinema 4D for the for the Cinema 4D R21 and S22 is 4GB.\n\nWe recommend at least 4 GB VRAM for GPU rendering\n\nSo, the Mac that you've selected only has half of the minimum recommendation for this particular piece of the software.  You Mac has no other choice other than choice but to spin up fans to cool off due to the extreme load they now have to deal with.\nSo, yes, these are problems, but unfortunately, it's not a problem with your Mac nor can it be fixed.  Unfortunately, the 2015 MacBook Pro is not the right fit for your particular need.\n", "Q: How do I delete thousands of .jpg files, each a duplicate of a .heic file? I was shooting photos/videos with an iPhone 8 and syncing using macOS iTunes & Photos on High Sierra.\nFor a period of two years, I have somehow ended up with a duplicate of every photo—several thousand duplicates.\nEach duplicated photo is in two file types, one is in .HEIC and the other is in .JPG.\nEach video from the same period has only one copy, in .MOV format.\nI am assuming that it is prudent to delete the .jpg files and keep the .heic ones, since the latter can store live photos and since I can generate .jpg from them if needed.\nHow do I delete thousands of .jpg files, each a duplicate of a .heic file? The duplication started after I moved to Photos from iPhotos. A script that does the job with no confirmation is fine (I'd test it on one day).\n\nA: One option is to use an AppleScript (or JavaScript for Automation, rather) such as the one I posted about here. I've copied its contents below*, and I've tried to include a fair amount of instructions between the post and comments in the code.\n#!/usr/bin/osascript -l JavaScript\n// findJpgHeicDuplicates.js\n// https://n8henrie.com/2021/02/remove-duplicate-jpg-or-heic-photos-from-macos-photosapp/\n//\n// Quickstart:\n//   - Copy this into a file, e.g. `findJpgHeicDuplicates.js`\n//      - Alternatively, check the post above for a download link\n//   - Make executable: `chmod +x findJpgHeicDuplicates.js`\n//   - Modify the configuration in the `CUSTOMIZE` section if desired\n//     - This is where you can configure getting rid of `.jpg` vs `.heic`\n//   - Select a set of photos in Photos.app\n//   - Run `./findJpgHeicDuplicates.js`\n//   - Process the suspected duplicates in `Duplicates/timestamp`\n//\n//  Alternatively, users not comfortable with the command line can:\n//    - open `Script Editor.app` on their Mac\n//      - `/System/Applications/Utilities/Script Editor.app` on Big Sur\n//    - create a new script\n//    - Change the language to JavaScript (if `AppleScript` is displayed near\n//      the top left)\n//    - Copy and paste the contents of this script\n//    - You will need to compile with `command` + `k` (or the hammer button) in\n//      between each run or else you will get `Error: SyntaxError: Can't create\n//      duplicate variable:`\n//\n// Apple's newish `.heic` image format compresses photos somewhat smaller than\n// jpg with some loss of minor details. Unfortunately, many users like myself\n// end up with numerous duplicate photos as a result -- half .jpg and half\n// .heic -- which nullifies the space savings.\n//\n// This script uses filename (sans extension), the photo's timestamp*, and\n// configurable fields in `criteria` (found in the `CUSTOMIZE` section) to find\n// likely .heic/.jpg duplicates from a selected set of photos in MacOS\n// Photos.app. If it finds a likely duplicate with at least one copy of the\n// desired extension, it then moves all copies of the UNdesired filetype to an\n// album named by the unix timestamp at the time of running within a folder\n// named `Duplicates`. These can then be inspected, and if desired batch\n// deleted with `command` + `delete`.\n//\n// * +/- 10 seconds, since most of my `.heic` files are timestamped ~1 second\n//   after the `.jpg`\n//\n// Note that if adding many photos to an album at once, Photos.app may prompt\n// for confirmation before doing so. Therefore, if you leave this script\n// running and aren't there to accept the confirmation prompt, the script may\n// time out while waiting for a response. Additionally, if your Mac sleeps\n// while this is running, it may not work properly -- I recommend running\n// `caffeinate -d` from the command prompt or using an application like\n// `Caffeine` to disable sleep if you're going to run it while AFK. Thankfully,\n// it seems that as long as you confirm the action it will often still work.\n//\n// I don't write much JavaScript, but I much prefer it to AppleScript.

Searches lead me down a rabbit hole of other issues and here I am. I'd like to not have to buy a new monitor, my TB display is an amazing monitor for my needs.\n\nIt sucks getting bad news, but it's your monitor.\nTwo different machines and two different Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2/1 adapters exhibit the same symptoms with the same monitor; you're down to only one remaining variable - the monitor.  \nYou could potentially repair this monitor.  Without putting hands on, I would guess it to be either (ranked in order of likelihood)\n\n\n*\n\n*Power supply. The symptoms sound like it could be a bad capacitor in the power supply providing inconsistent power to any number of the power rails feeding the logic board. Too little or uneven power can send one of the chips on the logic board into a \"panic\" and cause it to turn off, reset, etc.\n\n*Logic board.  This too could be a capacitor  or component on the logic board side of things that's causing a chip to malfunction.  Then again, it could be an IC (integrated circuit; aka \"chip\") itself that's failing. \n\n\nIs it worth fixing?\nFrom an economic stand point, not really.  You could spend several hundred dollars repairing to what amounts to a (at least) 4 year old display that's only capable of delivering QHD.  I'd put that money into a quality 4K display instead.\n\nA: I'm experiencing this with Thunderbolt-attached RAIDs. It happens after the computer sleeps; the RAIDs (I have two Areca RAIDs, daisy-chained) shut down and then restart. They then remain stable while the computer is asleep and then when I wake it up.\nI was running an application in the Xcode debugger and noticed this in the console output:\n\n[default] enable_updates_common timed out waiting for updates to\nreenable\n\nattributed to my app. After finding no such string in the code, I searched and ended up here. I have a late-2014 iMac running Big Sur.\n", "Q: Number keys on the Numeric Keypad part of the Magic Keyboard don't work with Terminal When I'm in Terminal, I've noticed that pressing the . or numbers 0 through 9 produce the error sound and don't register a value.  \nThe same keys pressed on the \"regular\" keyboard work as expected.\nIs this the expected behavior?\n** edit **\nThose keys work in other applications.\nWhen I start a new Terminal window or tab, these keys work correctly.\nHowever, when I start PowerShell 7 (pwsh), typing 0-9 then . produce OpOqOrOsOtOuOvOwOxOyOn.  When I exit pwsh, returning to zsh, and type those keys, the behavior reappears.\n\nA: Keypad Application Mode\nTerminals have a feature named Keypad Application Mode (the mnemonic for the command that enables it is DECKPAM).\nWhen Keypad Application Mode is enabled the numeric-keypad keys send function-key escape sequences so they can be differentiated from the digit keys along the top of the main keyboard and used to perform other functions (e.g., cursor movement, scrolling, editing text).\nThis mode is described in the DEC VT100 terminal user guide here:\nDECKPAM – Keypad Application Mode\nThe input sequences are described in tables 3-7 and 3-8. (The specific sequences depend on other terminal state.)\nOverriding to Enter Decimal Digits\nTypically, a Num Lock key can be used to override this mode to enter digit characters, and several terminal emulators have a preference to ignore this mode and always send digits.\nSince not all keyboards have a Num Lock key, macOS Terminal—for example—also has a Num Lock menu item and by default it maps the keypad Clear key (which is physically located where Num Lock often is) to Num Lock. The Num Lock menu item also has the keyboard shortcut Command-Clear ⌘⌧ to make it available from the keyboard if the Terminal keyboard-map preference has been customized and Clear does not map to Num Lock.\nPrograms That Cause Problems\nBy default, Vim enables Keypad Application Mode but does not map the function-key input to anything, which means that the trailing part of the function-key escape sequences are entered as text. Similarly, the Zsh “Oh My Zsh” collection may enable this mode without mapping the keys to something useful.\nIn programs like these you may see text entered or the program may beep and/or enter nothing. As far as I am aware this should be considered a bug in the program that enables the mode.\n", "Q: Issue downgrading MacOS Catalina to Mojave using bootable install on 16 inch MacBook Pro I've just got my 2019 MacBook Pro 16 in which came preinstalled with Catalina. To use 32 bit programs, I'm trying to use a bootable install in order to downgrade to Mojave, which I've done before.\nI followed the instructions provided on this site: https://www.imore.com/how-make-bootable-installer-drive-downgrade. I also went into recovery mode to access Startup Security Utility to enable bootable installs.\nIn the final step of holding down Option while restarting, the prohibited symbol appears on the screen (circle with line through) and my system restarts normally.\nImportant thing to not: I couldn't download Mojave from the App Store on my new computer, as a warning would stop me saying:\n    Update not found\n    The requested version of macOS is not available\n\nSo I had to download Mojave on my older computer to create the bootable install. I checked articles like https://macreports.com/update-not-found-the-requested-version-of-macos-is-not-available-fix/. But nothing seems to work so far.\nDoes anyone know how I might be able to either download Mojave on my new computer, allow my computer to downgrade through bootable install, or perhaps otherwise downgrade my computer?\n\nA: *\n\n*Downgrading MacBook Pro 16” to Mojave\nThe 16 inch MacBook Pro will not install Mojave. For those that are new versions of older gear like Mac Mini and iMacs, the drivers are likely good enough in Mojave so you can try using safari to download. There’s some good discussions on that below:\n\n*\n\n*How to download Mojave now that Catalina is available?\n\n*How can I download an older version of OS X/macOS?\n\n*Mac OS X downloads do not begin, other app store downloads normal\n", "Q: MacOS port become blocked I have tried setting up Packet Filter on macOS 10.15.5. \n\n\n*\n\n*I develop software.\n\n*I am hosting some services via supervisord.\n\n*It has a user interface on port 9001 running to reset/start/stop services.\n\n\nFor all time long it worked well and I was able to access that UI on the local network. I ran a nmap from my Windows PC targeting my development Mac. After this, on nmap my opened ports were displayed as tcpwraped, (i am not running any firewall on my dev mac). I am not able to access my dev machine from the windows pc anymore. It says Unable to connect, though those ports are visible from the nmap.\nAll ports are accessible from my other MacBook, but on my PC all ports are NOT accessible.\nIs there any way to understand what happened?\n\nA: The reason for me here was my VPN setup, I had to reinstall my Nord VPN, and reconnect in order to be able to access my Mac on local network.\nAlso, I would suggest using some PacketFilter firewall manager on the Mac machine. I use Murus and it seems to be pretty good for my requirements.\nThanks everyone who helped me to figure this out quickly.\n", "Q: Repeating /System/Volumes/Data/System/Volumes/Data I'm using ncdu to see where my storage space is going, and noticed a seemingly endless file path it seems to be traversing:\n/System/Volumes/Data/System/Volumes/Data/System/Volumes/Data/System/Volumes/Data/System/Volumes...\nThis file path doesn't actually exist if I try to cd in there (thank goodness):\n$ ls -lshart /System/Volumes/Data/System/\ntotal 0\n0 drwxr-xr-x@  3 root  wheel    96B Aug 24  2019 .\n0 drwxr-xr-x   9 root  wheel   288B Sep 29  2019 Library\n0 drwxr-xr-x  26 root  wheel   832B Apr 20 02:15 ..\n\nBut it does seem that I'm inexplicably using more data than I think I am; ncdu says I'm using about 40GB under the user space, and I try to keep the machine fairly uncluttered. XCode and Docker are the largest applications of the few I have, by far.\nFor example, ncdu is telling me I'm using 487GB (and counting), while the machine has only an 120GB SSD:\nTotal items: 17767208 size: 484.7 GiB\n\nOn Catalina 1.15.4.\n\nRelated: What's /System/Volumes/Data?\n\nA: I think you want ncdu <path> --exclude-firmlinks (available in ncdu 1.15.1 on OS X - possibly before, but this is the version I'm using and it has --exclude-firmlinks available). Like others said, it does have to do with firmlinks, and this will solve the issue.\n\nA: This is a problem with firmlinks which are used by macOS and not supported by ncdu.\nYou can use ncdu --exclude /System/Volumes/Data -x / on macOS Catalina to avoid the problem and scan the whole file system.\n\nA: This is a common problem with programs that don't handle links well. The tool is stuck in a maze with left hand turns leading it in to a circle - it will never get out until its search algorithm is changed to make better decisions on macOS Catalina and newer.\n\n*\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/2020/09/16/boot-volume-layout/\nThe new variable is firmlinks which merge two different filesystems. You may have to start this tool in a way that it doesn't measure any directory with a firm link in it until it can be updated to work.\nI love ncdu but you may need other tools that work better with the new layouts.\n\n*\n\n*https://daisydiskapp.com\nSelect a tool that knows about hard, sym and firm links and you should be set.\n", "Q: How does one send MIDI files from iOS Garageband? There's already info for Garage band as a target of sound but what about source?\nHow does one send MIDI files from iOS Garageband?\n\nA: Unfortunately the answer is just as simple: you can't.\nAt least not using GarageBand for iOS only. It doesn't have an \"export MIDI\" function, in fact you can only export the entire project, not individual tracks, so I suppose it isn't too surprising.\nThis is not to say it is impossible to get midi from the software instrument tracks in a GB for iOS project.\nThe first idea that comes to mind is to open the .band file in Logic or GarageBand for Mac (transfer via USB or use the sharing option) then export the project or tracks as a midi file (actually I am not 100% sure about GarageBand, I know you can in Logic).\nIt would be nice if you could do this without having to resort to using a Mac though, (especially since Apple markets the iPad Pro as being more powerful than many laptops; the iPad version of GarageBand can't do this either) and it's not like it is a fundamental limitation of iOS, it's just GarageBand for iOS doesn't have the feature. If there is an app that can open the .band files saved by GB for iOS and save the software instrument tracks as midi files, you could do what you want entirely on your iOS device.\nBut it still wouldn't be possible with GarageBand for iOS alone, at least currently. I'd recommend submitting feedback, both in the App Store and the Apple Support website, IMO this would be a popularly welcomed feature if it is implemented, I don't use GarageBand too often so I was surprised the only export/share options was as a bounced audio track and project file.\n", "Q: Assigning new device to child's account I am setting up a new Apple device (iPad) for a child. I have already created a children's account under family sharing on another device. However, it's not clear if on the new device I should set the Apple ID to the child's or mine. \nFrom the Apple docs, it seems like the device is setup up under my account and then is set to the child under screen time, but that doesn't seem right. \nTrying to sign in directly on the new device with the child's account gives a \"Verification Error\", but testing the username/password on icloud.com works. \n\nA: You can do this either way, you can use your account or your child's, but the steps to take to set up Screen Time will vary depending on which one you use.\nIt sounds like the iPad is for your child to use primarily, in which case I would recommend using his/her account, since it makes it more streamlined and intuitive to use the parental management features. (usually, that is) It is also the only way to take advantage of features like ask to purchase, etc.\nThe Apple ID that is used device-wide, i.e. for the iCloud features, iTunes/App Stores, etc. should be the child's account – the top of the Settings app should display your child's name and account for the Apple ID settings menu.\nWhen you set up screen time, or other parental management feature, a login prompt will come up, probably somewhere around when you set up the management passcode. Here, you need to log into the guardian or family organizer Apple ID.\nBut you can avoid this confusion by configuring Screen Time for your child's device from your own Mac, iOS device, or iPad, if you have one. Turn on Screen Time in family sharing and it will allow you to manage your child's device from the Settings app or System Preferences on your own device remotely, kind of like a cute mini version of an MDM deployment :)\n", "Q: In Safari, can a set of bookmarks in a folder be opened programmatically (e.g. using AppleScript)? I have a set of bookmarks in a folder. Usually, I open them by selecting the folder  and then \"Open in New Tabs\". Is it possible to do this using a script? I imagine AppleScript would be the right tool here, but anything that is included with the system would work as an answer.\n\nA: If you are just wanting to script the clicking go the Open in New Tabs menu item of the target folder under Bookmarks, then the following example AppleScript code will do that:\nset bookmarksFolder to \"Saved Tabs\"\n\ntell application \"Safari\" to activate\n\ndelay 1\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    click menu item \"Open in New Tabs\" of ¬\n        menu 1 of ¬\n        menu item bookmarksFolder of ¬\n        menu 1 of ¬\n        menu bar item \"Bookmarks\" of ¬\n        menu bar 1 of ¬\n        application process \"Safari\"\n\nJust change \"Saved Tabs\" in the first line of code to the actual name of the target folder on the Bookmarks menu.\nHere is something a bit more robust…\nI have different sets of URLs that I group into different windows by themselves, and have made an AppleScript application from the code. You can use the example AppleScript code below to do the same:\nset myURLs to {¬\n    \"https://somedomain.com\", ¬\n    \"https://somedomain.com\", ¬\n    \"https://somedomain.com\", ¬\n    \"https://somedomain.com\", ¬\n    \"https://somedomain.com\", ¬\n    \"https://somedomain.com\", ¬\n    \"https://somedomain.com\", ¬\n    \"https://somedomain.com\"}\n\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    make new document with properties {URL:first item of myURLs}\n    activate\n    tell window 1\n        set bounds to {0, 22, 1136, 844}\n        delay 1\n        repeat with i from 2 to count myURLs\n            set current tab to (make new tab with properties {URL:item i of myURLs})\n            delay 2\n        end repeat\n        set current tab to fourth tab\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nObviously \"https://somedomain.com\" is just a place holder for the real URL. The set bounds … and set current tab … commands can be adjusted to your liking or omitted.\nI called the AppleScript application My Regular Sites, gave it a nice icon through the Get Info window method, and put it in the Dock.\nThis make it real easy to open Safari with a window containing my regular sites.\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide.

Dual 6-core Xeons, 64GB RAM, 5 internal drives, 1 SSD, 4 HD.\nI don't want to prevent Time Machine backups, but I'd be happy enough if backupd didn't do local backups. My TM drive is a permanently connected, internal drive.\nPeriodically, backupd will take up so much CPU that the entire Mac halts - even the clock in the menu bar stops [I have it showing seconds]. I also have Activity Monitor open permanently in a corner of one screen where i can easily see it without having to switch to it.\nThis morning I got a halt that lasted 40 seconds & when it finally kicked back into action I briefly saw backupd reading over 1,000% CPU. A second spike ocurred shortly after.\nChecking the timestamp on the snapshot I got just after & comparing to Time Machine in the menu bar puts these right in the middle of Time Machine's last backup [which I'd already long-suspected.]\nAt these times when backupd is badly slowing the machine down, I see fairly high launchd too, though maybe at around 100% not the 10-core-eating 1000% that backupd managed.\nI recycled the Time Machine drive about 6 weeks ago in an attempt to streamline things, but the behaviour seems unchanged.

Volumes in an APFS container is analogous to partitions in a drive.\nIn Disk Utility, you can see you have your Untitled - Data Volume for your everyday reads/writes, and a RJ volume intended to be apart of apple's security which is designed to be unwritable even to you if you tried without disabling SIP and remounting the root filesystem so foreign programs don't alter and corrupt the macOS system files (malware, you, etc)\nThe reason the partitioning in diskutil list and diskutil list apfs may seem strange is APFS is designed to expand and shrink. Meaning all volumes can utilize the entire disk until full which is why you see overlaping disk sizes of your entire disk size.\n", "Q: Seagate external hard drive won't mount my external hard drive worked fine last week.

How do I perform a factory reset or otherwise prepare the laptop for a new user?\nAn authorized Apple repair shop told me I was out of luck and that I'd been given a brick.\n\nA: Firmware password is something you need the password or Apple’s willing assistance to bypass.\nFileVault and data encryption is trivial to erase by booting to another OS (Internet Recovery is often the easiest other OS) to wipe and reinstall.\nFirmware password and hardware failures are the only things that interfere with an erase and install in my experience, once you have reviewed a couple support articles.\nHere are the relevant references and definitions:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204455 Firmware\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314 Recovery\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208496 Erase\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208987 Activation Lock\n\nNote, if you erase a Mac, you still may be faced with an Activation Lock or a device management MDM under Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager.\n\nA: I encountered this same problem and have been able to solve it.  Filevault was used to lock the laptop.  Previous employee left and we didn't have the password.  When we tried recovery mode it still required a password, as did internet recovery mode.\nThe hint is in one of the other answers on here, which is that 'apple support says internet recovery doesn't require the login password'.  This is actually true, it's just not readily apparent what to do after starting in internet recovery mode because the first screen you see is still the login screen.  However if you click 'recovery assistant' on the top left, you'll see an option for 'erase mac' which will essentially erase the contents of the laptop allowing you to reinstall the macOS.\nAfter erasing, the computer will restart and you'll see the the typical blinking folder with a question mark (because all the startup files were deleted), but you just follow the regular recovery process again (recovery mode by restarting and holding cmd+r) and you can reinstall the factory setting macOS.\nI've run into other issues since restarting such as recovery images not unmounting properly so I'll probably need to use a bootable USB, but at least the HD is wiped and finally unlocked!\n\nA: Apple customer service stated that macOS Recovery over the Internet does not require the login password, and that someone could erase/reformat the drive using that tool.  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314\n", "Q: What is the \"Sign in with Apple ID - The password for \"\" needs to be updated\" dialog? I just encountered the dialog below. It looks a bit suspicious to me and I am wondering whether it is an authentical or some scam/virus. It just popped up after I had an issue with my computer running out of (application) space and I had to restart it.\n\n\nA: Since Apple stopped selling OS X on DVDs with 10.7 Lion (which was available on a USB drive, but that was a transition concession), Apple has built in the assumption that every Mac has reasonably high speed internet access (it can be brought into an Apple Store for that if necessary) and every user has an Apple ID. macOS as it is now called uses your Apple ID for lots of things: syncing with iCloud, keeping track of what Apps you have purchased/installed from the App Store, keeping track of what music you have purchased from iTunes, and lots more.\nIn general, macOS does not actually keep track of your Apple ID password. Instead, it uses your Apple ID password from time-to-time to create or update public/private key pairs that it uses for authentication across the internet. Those private keys are stored in your Keychain, which is protected by the login password to your local account on your Mac (and by other things).\nIt is a complicated system, but it allows you to do things like see which devices are \"authorized\" for your Apple ID and revoke authorizations for devices, or use Find My Mac to find a lost device in a way that allows you to find your device without even Apple being able to find it without your permission.\nIn a system like this, sometimes things get out of sync by accident and sometimes on purpose (like when you revoke access for a device). In order to resync, the system will present a dialog like the one in the post. My guess is that the bare bones dialog comes up when some faceless utility has a problem. You get a better dialog from the Apple App Store when it needs your password.\nI am very security conscious and also get suspicious about dialog boxes that just pop up and ask for passwords. However, so far I am not aware of an exploit that tries to get your Apple ID password this way, and if the part in quotes is, in fact, the correct email address for the Apple ID for the account I am using, I generally suspect the request to be legitimate. Being naturally curious I try to investigate where it is coming from and why it is needed, but that has been made harder with the Console making it harder to see historical log messages, so I have not been very successful lately.\nA reasonable thing to do is, if you have no reason to suspect anything has changed that would cause you to need to refresh your password, just hit cancel the first time it comes up. Perhaps run a virus scan. Perhaps reboot your computer. If you are using Catalina, there is an \"Apple ID\" preference panel in System Preferences, and that has a \"Password & Security\" section. Use that to verify everything is good, and fix any issues it informs you about.\nIf the dialog comes up again after that, I usually go ahead and enter the password. Then again, I monitor iCloud activity and authorized devices, and do not store terribly sensitive or embarrassing stuff in iCloud, plus I have two-factor authentication turned on, so I am not terribly worried about my password being stolen. You have to make your own security versus functionality decision.\n", "Q: using rEFInd to get around lack of boot screen when using unsupported GPU in Mac Pro I am trying to upgrade a 2012 Mac Pro (model 5,1) to Mojave.  I have installed High Sierra and updated bootrom to MP51.0089.B00.  I've got a required \"metal capable\" graphics card (Sapphire PULSE Radeon RX580), which unfortunately does not support the Startup Manager.  I want access to the Startup Manager, to be able to access recovery partitions and bootable external media.\nMy plan: rEFInd seems like a good solution to my problem. Before installing the unsupported GPU, if I can get rEFInd to appear as an option in the Startup Manager, I can select it as the default using the control key when selecting the boot option (this does work on my machine).  Then once I install the unsupported GPU, the rEFInd main screen will appear on startup and I can select whatever I want, including recovery partitions and external media. (Obviously I must be careful never to change the default in SystemPrefs->StartupDisk, or I'll have to temporarily re-install the old GPU and change the default back to rEFInd !).   Does this sound like a workable plan ?\nI've installed rEFInd, with default options, and it does not appear in Startup Manager.   To get it  to appear in Startup Manager, I believe I need to reinstall it with the --usedefault option.   How do I reinstall ?   Do I need to uninstall first (since I first installed it without the usedefault option) ?  Uninstalling looks somewhat problematic.   And what argument do I need to use with --usedefault ?   I've looked at a wiki and a manpage, but am still confused.  When I ran 'mountesp', I got:\nsudo mountesp\nThe ESP has been identified as /dev/disk0s1; attempting to mount it....\nThe ESP is mounted at /Volumes/ESP\n\nThe only file in that volume is: /Volumes/ESP/EFI/APPLE/EXTENSIONS/Firmware.scap\nThat's it.  I am out of my depth, and would appreciate help.\n\nA: Removing rEFInd from the EFI partition.\nIf you use refind-install without any options and/or the --usedefault option to install rEFInd into the EFI partition (disk0s1), then use the following steps to remove rEFInd from this partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the EFI partition (disk0s1) is unmounted. Use the command given below.\ndiskutil unmount disk0s1\n\n\n*Mount the EFI partition (disk0s1).

You should make sure rEFInd is removed from the EFI partition (disk0s1) before proceeding.\n\nThe commands to install the current version of rEFInd is given below. You should enter these commands from macOS.\nsudo $HOME/Downloads/refind-bin-0.12.0/refind-install --usedefault /dev/disk0s1\ndiskutil unmount disk0s1\n\nBelow is the output when the above commands were entered using the current version of Catalina (macOS 10.13.6).\n\n\nNote: When testing, I received the error message sed: -i may not be used with stdin. This error did not effect the installation of rEFInd other than not unmounting disk0s1\n\nThe rEFInd Boot Manager should now appear in the Mac Startup Manager with the label EFI Boot.

This behavior began after the macOS 10.15.4 update, and has produced about 150TB read. Killing the process, restarting the computer does not help with the case. I am wondering what is this process doing to read data repeatedly, if anyone else has the same problem, and what is a potential solution.

When you open certain apps that process reads (and a lot, if the app is big). It happens to me for example when I open Photoshop 2020, it reads about 1GB.\nYou say you never turn it off? How much have your laptop been running? If you never power off your computer that read usage stats are not going to be wiped, so they will just keep growing, hence the huge number. If you poweroff so it starts from zero, how much syspolicyd reads in a 24h timespan?\n\nA: spctl is the tool to manipulate system policy and/or control syspolicyd.\nTry disabling SIP, enabling the root user, and running spctl --master-disable.\nIt should get rid of the issue, if it doesn't, then something very weird is happening.\nBut this isn't a fix, it's kind of like replacing a fuse with a jumper wire. So what I think you should do is nuke the security policy database: spctl --reset-default, then reenable it after a reboot: spctl --master-enable.\nAll these commands need to be done as root, or with sudo\nWithout knowing what caused the issue in the first place though, I daresay it is likely it is likely to return. It might be some malformed rule was added to your policy db and nuking it fixes the problem, but I sort of doubt that. At least by doing this, hopefully you can diagnose the issue by keeping an eye on when the problem returns (probably after you authorize an application to run - you will need to authorize every single 3rd party non-MAS app to run after the reset)\n\nA: Give the Terminal app the \"Developer Tools\" privilege, i.e. via:\nSystem Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Developer Tools\n\nThis may solve or, in my case with Catalina, significantly reduced the sys*d diskio and cpu time.\nA possible cause to the problem is the notarization, therefore, the syspoliced constantly scans binaries. The Developer Tools privilege can bypass this check.\n", "Q: Can't restore closed Safari tabs on Catalina! I have a big problem with Safari.  I had about 30 tabs opened and I restarted my computer. \nSafari opens itself empty, without restoring any tabs and the \"restore all tabs from previous session\" is disabled.\nI searched the solution for hours.  The fix seems to be restoring an older version of the file LastSession.plist from the Library folder with Time Machine.  However, this isn't working on Catalina as Time Machine isn't working with this folder and its files.\nAnyone know a workaround? I had really important tabs\n\nA: At the top of the Safari page is a History Menu item. When you open that it should list the most recent sites you have visited. You may be able to recover them one at a time by clicking on each site. If no sites are listed I'd look for the plist file and edit it to see what is in it. I think TextEdit will open plist files. If not try Xcode.\n", "Q: Can you set up a table format on Pages documents from the beginning? I want to set up a Pages document with a specific format, a certain table with a certain number of cells on each page, of a certain size. Instead of just copying and pasting this table into multiple pages, is there a way I can set up the document in the settings so that it knows to automatically put such a table in every page?\n\nA: Create a Pages document with the desired table (and any styles you want). \nThen save as a template.\nNew documents created with the template should meet your needs.\n", "Q: How to evenly space table cells in Pages document? I would like to create a “grid” in a Pages document by creating a table whose cells are a certain size. Instead of manually dragging the walls of each cell, I would like to tell the program directly to, perhaps, divide the space into thirds, or to make each cell a specific measurement wide. Is there any way to do this?\n\nA: In Pages you are able to enter the sizing/spacing for cells in a table in Pages. You are limited to entering specific measurements that is applied to all cells.\nTo do so go to the Tool Bar and select the Format Tab > Table Tab (have the table selected) then look to the bottom right corner of the window for where it says Row &  Column Size and it will let you enter the with Height and Width.

I have a 6th generation iPad, iPadOS 13.5\nI have used an app called \"On My iPad\" that came preinstalled to this iPad to copy files to this iPad (like PDFs, movies, etc.). Eventually, I deleted all the files that I have copied (at least this is what I think I have done).\nThe problem is that there is still a lot of storage taken by something in this \"On My iPad\". Has it not completely deleted the files? How to clean up the storage?\nPlease see the screenshots.\nYou can see that there are zero items showing when I open the \"On My iPad\" app. There are three folders Downloads, Keynote, Pages, and they are all empty.\n\n\nRecently Deleted\nThere is nothing in the Recently Deleted items.\n\n\niPad Storage\nWhen I look at the overall iPad storage I see that there is about 1GB taken by the \"On My iPad\".\nAlso, there is a discrepancy in the reported available space. The \"On My iPad\" above shows that 20.31 GB available. The iPad Storage reports 14.3 of 32 GB used, i.e. only 17.7 GB is available.\n\n\nDocuments and Data\nWhen I tap on the \"On My iPad\" to see the details, I see that \"Documents and Data\" take 1 GB.\n\n\nRecommendations\nWhen I tap further on Recommendations, there is nothing there. When I had some files, they were showing here. I have deleted all I could. Apparently, something is still sitting somewhere.\n\nI have seen advice to delete an application and reinstall it back to reclaim the storage taken by the \"Documents and Data\" and I have done this trick successfully with the Keynote application. But there is no option to delete the \"On My iPad\" application and there is no such application in the App Store, so this method can't be used here.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Well, it was sort of a mystery.\nI'm not really sure which of my actions produced desired effect.\n\n\n*\n\n*I copied a lot of files to iPad using the same \"On My iPad\" application to completely use up all available space. Then I deleted them via the Settings - Storage and also via the \"On My iPad\" app (where I could see the files going into the \"Recently Deleted\" location and where I could delete them completely).\n\n*I played with iTunes, connected the iPad to my Windows PC.\n\n*Rebooted iPad by holding the button on the top of the case and waiting till \"Slide to turn off\" appears on the screen.\n\n*Rebooted iPad by holding both the button on the top of the case and the Home button simultaneously till the screen goes black and then the Apple logo appears.\n\n*Also, probably, rebooting while it was connected to a PC with iTunes running.\n\n*Deleted the iPad's backup from the iCloud.\n\n*Turned on the iCloud Drive.\n\n\nEventually, I looked into the Recently Deleted location in the \"On My iPad\" application and I saw a bunch of files and folders that I have deleted few days ago. Those files that were hiding somewhere and taking up that 1.02 GB of space. As you can see from the screenshots in the question there was nothing showing up in the Recently Deleted location at the time when I was writing this question.\nSo, I don't really know what made those files to hide. I suspect that those files were not properly moved into the Recently Deleted area, because when I tried to delete them few days ago the iPad's storage was completely full and the deletion operation didn't go correctly. What an irony - there is no free space on the device, but when I try to delete a file it disappears from the view, but still stays taking up the space.\nMost importantly, I don't know what made those files become visible again. Probably one of the things I did above.\n", "Q: Will a Mac boot with Clonezilla? The goal is to upgrade a Mac's hard drive to an SSD.\nIs it possible to boot Clonezilla from a USB stick on a Mac (iMac 2007/Mac 7,1) to clone a mechanical HDD to a SDD?  I do not have access to the target machine in my home / office and will have very limited amount of valuable time on the target machine.\nAlthough there are reports of booting from USB, I am unable to find instances of booting a Mac from USB Clonezilla.  My concern is that there is some obstacle to booting Clonezilla or other hurdle that would prevent upgradomg the HDD to a SDD.  I would prefer that advance experience inform me that it is not possible because of X,Y,orZ so I do not waste my limited time on the target machine.\nAlthough I have performed the clone exercise with other methods, my curiosity prompts the question: the hope is that someone has actually performed the task with Clonezilla or knows enough to confidently claim Clonezilla is possible.\nUPDATE: I do not have access to said target machine & it is not mine to experiment with as I please. I am reluctant to experiment on machines that are not mine to satisfy intellectual curiosity.  The target machine is not mine. I am open to new ideas and appreciate suggestions that ultimately serve the goal & do not necessarily address the question.\n\nA: Yes, it's doable!\nTesting on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013), as it's the oldest Mac I have access to today…\nI went to https://clonezilla.org/downloads.php and clicked on alternative stable - 20200428-focal, then in the next window left 1, 2, 3 as set and clicked the DOWNLOAD button.\nWhile the zip archive was downloading I prepared the USB drive in Disk Utility so it's a single FAT32 partition with an Master Boot Record.

At the Apple Store, I ended up just connecting the two phones together to do the data transfer, so I didn't end up needing the iTunes backup from my PC after all. \nFast forward to last week, my iPhone stopped working, and since shelter in place is still in full effect in CA, I had to send my phone in and they sent me a new replacement today. Since it stopped working suddenly, I wasn't able to get my current data back, but I fortunately still have the backup I made in February. Problem is, it is asking for a decryption pass code that I never created (at least not within the last 10 years). \nI have called Apple Support, and they told me that they have no way of accessing or resetting this password, does anyone have any idea what it could have been? Could it have been a password that I entered when I first setup my Apple ID in 2008? Could it have been a password I set on another computer? \nThis backup contains years of photos of travelling, life events, and moments with those who have passed away. Any help would be graciously appreciated. \n\nA: Some good news and some bad news.\nGood news is the password is one you entered. It’s not reused or picked up from anywhere else. You (or your agent at the keyboard) could choose the same password as was used elsewhere, but they are not automatic or linked in any way. \nTo elaborate, iTunes does not encrypt backups by default, so someone typed in this password. That means you can think back to the first device you ever had that was an iPod shuffle, Classic iPod or iPhone and start making a list on paper or electronically.\nList out the passwords you or someone with access to your computer may have ever used. Maybe start with easy things like the PIN you and your household use for gates, doors, devices, bank accounts. Me methodical and record which PIN you type. Also, go slow. If you want to try the pin 0000 and think you entered it but typed 00000 it may be a long time before you go back and try 0000.\nLast good news is you are not really rate limited or at risk of destroying the backup by guessing wrong. You only lose time.\nBad news - the PIN or computer could be misbehaving - this is rare, but can happen. If the PIN was truly 1234 and that doesn’t work, your backup might be lost.\nNeutral news - there is cracking software you may choose to pay for or trust. Like any internet software, even if the author didn’t plant malware, someone else could so consider care getting any software - but there are options to try and brute force passwords on backup files.\nApple isn’t offering to unlock it since they don’t set a default password and don’t want to get tricked into unlocking someone else’s private information let alone offer that sort of service. They do document how to move on if you exhaust your time or resources and can’t get into the backup you made.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205220\n", "Q: accidentally deleted the admin account on my MacBook MacBook Air, 10.13.6 High Sierra. \nI tried changing the name of the user on my macbook and accidentally deleted the administrator account.

Follow the Apple reset password steps for good results.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I recover the administrator or root password on OS X?\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201573\nAlso, I would consider fixing the actual problem. macOS will not let you delete the admin account. You have to have a broken system or run some scripts that could damage anything in addition to the account. Unless you know precisely how you lost your account, it would be better to just back up and reinstall a clean system over top of the existing data and programs.\nSame advice when you reset the password, get a backup and be ready to reinstall - perhaps an erase install - your system wasn’t healthy before and getting admin won’t remedy that unhealthy system.\n", "Q: Automatic certificate creation? To add 3rd party plugins in Xcode, one should create their own certificate and to sign Xcode with it. But self-signed certificates expire after 1 year. How can I make specific code to be executed every year? Probably there's a way, but then I have another problem -- is there a way to create certificates with terminal, not through Keychain Access app? \nAlso is it unsafe? I don't see any difference between manual certificate creation and automatic, so if it is unsafe, then creating such certificates is overall unsafe.\n\nA: Yes, you can use command line tools to issue your own self-signed certificates. These need not be limited to one year.\nThere is no difference between Keychain Access created certificates and those you create using command line tools.\nopenssl\nWith openssl you can create certificates of any duration. The question and answers for how to create a self-signed certificate with OpenSSL will get you started. The command is effectively:\nopenssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 730\n\nThe command above will result in a two year self-signed certificate.\nAutomatic versus Manual\nRegarding safety, there is no difference in safety between certificates created by Keychain Access's graphical interface and those by command line tools.\nThe safety of self-signed certificates can be an issue. Self-signed certificates are not signed by a trusted third party. This third party signature typically only matters when the certificate is being used outside of your immediate environment – which it is not for this situation.\nAd-Hoc\nYou can also ad-hoc codesign an application without a certificate:\nsudo codesign -f -s - /Applications/Xcode.app\n\n", "Q: Coffee spilled on 2018 Touch Bar MBP. Still working with some problems. What to do? Almost a week ago I spilled a full cup of coffee on my Macbook Pro 2018 with Touch Bar. Coffee is spilled mostly left-ish side and it was without sugar but some milk. For now nothing major happened and it is working almost good but clicking on left side of trackpad doesn't working. I can move cursor, tap to click is working but no click sound on left side. And one USB-C port on the left is problematic. It's working mostly but when I move the cable or device on that port the connection loses briefly and returns back. Keyboard is working totally normal and there is no other issues for now. 6 months of warranty left but I don't even now if the spill already voids my warranty. So now I am in between opening the case and clean inside of it or wait till my warranty end.\nWhat do you recommend for me and if I you think that I need to open and clean inside what can I use to clean water, coffee, fat etc. ? I have all the tools for opening the case and I am experienced with it.\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: \"Recently\"… unless it was in the last 5 minutes, you likely missed your chance.\nThe absolute first thing to do is stop using it, disconnect the power, including the battery, strip it down & start to dry up as much as possible.\nDon't hope it will be OK.\nDon't put it in rice & expect it will just get better.\nDon't plug it back in to see if it still works.\nYour two main enemies are short-circuit & corrosion.\nAny liquid containing a high percentage of water will immediately short-circuit anything it touches, potentially causing component damage or even fire.\nAny non-pure liquid will then start to corrode the delicate circuitry, quite rapidly in the presence of electricity.\nThe faster you can get the power removed & the circuits cleaned using isopropyl alcohol, the better the chance your machine will survive.\nFor additional reading -\nNo sound (speakers/jack) + microphone's dead after spilling water\n&\nWhat procedure should be followed post spilling fluids onto a MacBook keyboard?\n\nA: At first, you should check your warranty status here. Then, as a person who spilled an energy drink on my own MacBook-Pro (but actually newer with another type of the keyboard), I advise to clean and dry the surface without opening inside. Do NOT use a hairdryer or any stuff like that. Only towels etc. And GO to the service center (official ofc) to let them check your MacBook status). Unfortunately, it will cost you some money but MacBook's design is quite complicated and wasting even a minute would lead to even bigger problems (-> more money to repair it)\n", "Q: Demonstrating iPad's screen on MacBook I need to use my iPad and show its screen on my MacBook. As far as I know, AirPlay allows me to use the iPad as a second screen for Mac but here I need to do it the opposite way.\nI can't record my iPad's screen or use Continuity Sketch (in fact I need this mostly for drawing on my iPad only).\nCan I stream or mirror  my iPad's screen on my Mac?\n\nA: *\n\n*Connect your iPad via cable to your MacBook.\n\n*Launch macOS built-in QuickTime Player.app\n\n*Go to File menu → New Movie Recording or use the keyboard shortcut Option + Command + N\n\n*This would open a Quick Time window with the MacBooks camera turned on.\n\n*Click on the arrow besides the red circular Record button and select your iPad for Camera.\n\n\n\n*This would show the iPad's screen on your Mac.

The old iPhone was running iOS 12 and the new phone is updated to run iOS 13.5.\nEverything seems to be working so far except for the App Store. When you go into the App Store and tap on the account icon at the top, it shows the account panel with her name logged in, \"Purchased\", \"Redeem Gift Card or Code\", \"Send Gift Card by Email\", \"Add Funds to Apple ID\", \"Personalized Recommendations\", and \"Sign Out\".\nIt should be showing a list of applications to update between \"Personalized Recommendations\" and \"Sign Out\", right? Or do these sections not show at all in the new location in iOS 13 if all of the apps were already updated prior to the phone change and in the old location in iOS 12?\n(And if so, that's dumb that Apple can't apply the data from the old place to the new place!) I just want to make sure it transferred correctly before her old phone is repurposed for something else. Thanks for any insight.\n\nA: It turns out that the update section doesn't appear in the account list at all until an update is available or has been automatically applied.  Any updates applied on the prior phone with the older iOS don't show in the list.  \nI had hoped to figure all this out right away when I was doing the phone change so I would know that the phone transfer had worked successfully.  (I initially feared that the transfer had partially failed and that I wouldn't be able to do updates on the new phone.)  But I ended up needing to wait for an app to need an upgrade to get my answer for sure.  So hopefully this question and answer will help somebody else who is going through that to know that the transfer worked out fine and not to worry about that.  \n", "Q: UNKNOWN NAME Showing up instead of actual phone number When receiving a phone call from a number not listed in my Contacts, the name displays as \"UNKNOWN NAME\" rather than simply showing the number initiating the call.

Let's say I have two date/times. The start date/time is 29th May 2020 at 20:30 and the end date/time is 30th May at 02:30. This link shows how to calculate using two cell references. \nHow to calculate in one cell the duration? \nSomething like DATEDIF but accepting the time and output of result in hours, e.g.:\n=MYCLEVERDATETIMEDIFF(“29/5/20 20:30”, “30/5/20 02:30”, \"H\")\n\nwhich results in:\n6\n\nSix being the elapsed time in hours between the above date/times.\nWhat function, or combination of functions and conversions would do the trick? Note that ideally something that works as one cell function, not calculating the difference between two cell references.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Assuming I have understood what you wish to accomplish correctly, here is one way of doing it in the same cell if you are willing to enter the dates and the times separately:\n\nAnd here is the text version of the formula shown above\n=(DATEDIF(DATE(2020,5,29),DATE(2020,5,30),\"D\")+TIMEVALUE(\"02:30\")−TIMEVALUE(\"20:30\"))×24\n\nUnfortunately, this can not be done by entering the date & time together for each point in time (or without entering them more than once). It appears that there is no date & time function in Numbers that calculates the difference between two date & time values in hours directly or one that fully converts a date & time value in text or otherwise to a proper date & time value that Numbers can process.\n\nA: Just click a cell and type the equals sign, then add DateDif(ref cell 1, reference cell 2,\"D\"). You can enter reference cell 1 and 2 by just clicking on the proper cell. This command will return the number of days between the two dates.

Here is a chart I created with similar data with yours. \n\nI just selected the numbers to be charted (but did not select either the header row or the header column) and then clicked on Chart in Numbers toolbar at the top and selected the icon representing the 2D line chart.\nNumbers behave in a weird fashion sometimes in creating charts in my experience. This happens to me occasionally even when I am creating simple charts. When this happens, I create a new file, copy the data only to the new file and create a new chart usually using the same steps. Those steps that have failed in my first trial usually work in the second trial!\n\nA: To plot in Numbers you need to select two columns and then insert a chart. Makes sure the chart type is a line plot or scatter plot. Then the plot should appear. If not check your axis and see if they are scaled properly. It sounds confusing but it's really easy. I've made many plots using Numbers so if you need additional help just add a comment. I'll try to help.\n\nA: I replicated your table and for me, the chart just happened automagically. I had the entire table selected, rather than any specific rows/columns/cells.\nMaybe you should also check if the data format of the cells is set to numbers, and not text or something else? The way it is left-aligned makes me kind of suspicious of that.\n\n\n\n", "Q: File sharing between two Catalinas - Finder cannot connect So I can screen share between the two Macs; I can ssh, rsync, and scp  the files between the two Macs; but having Finder try to “Connect As” always fails the login sheet using the same user and password as on the command line. \nI tried switching between SMP, SMP encrypted, and AFP ... makes no difference.

But better, in my opinion.\nI use HyperDock https://bahoom.com/hyperdock/ which shows thumbnails of all windows. It has other features too, which I leave you to explore.  And my preference is the version from the HyperDock web site, not from the App Store.\n\n\nA: Apple doesn’t inject code into a running app to provide this count (basically it’s up to the app to manage badges, not the OS). One solution would be to choose apps that have code added to display their window count as a badge (like they do in the window menu and other parts of the app). This is trivial to program as a sample app, but making changes to a large program like Chrome is typically far from trivial. If this feature is important, I think the browser team could make the effort to do it. \nLike the mail app counts messages unread and read, it can display arbitrary information in a badge. \nHave you seen if this is a feature hidden or made a request to the chrome development team?\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.google.com/chrome/dev/\nAlthough since chrome was created to remove chrome like that, they might see this as more clutter.

I've used CleanMyMac to remove around 40 Gb of files, but a before/after of df -h doesn't show much difference at all:\n# Before:\n[Kens-MacBook-Pro:~] % df -h\nFilesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity iused               ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk1s1   466Gi  445Gi   18Gi    97% 2138098 9223372036852637709    0%   /\ndevfs          188Ki  188Ki    0Bi   100%     650                   0  100%   /dev\n/dev/disk1s4   466Gi  2.0Gi   18Gi    11%       2 9223372036854775805    0%   /private/var/vm\nmap -hosts       0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%       0                   0  100%   /net\nmap auto_home    0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%       0                   0  100%   /home\n\n# After:\n[Kens-MacBook-Pro:~] % df -h\nFilesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity iused               ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk1s1   466Gi  445Gi   18Gi    97% 1899364 9223372036852876443    0%   /\ndevfs          188Ki  188Ki    0Bi   100%     650                   0  100%   /dev\n/dev/disk1s4   466Gi  2.0Gi   18Gi    11%       2 9223372036854775805    0%   /private/var/vm\nmap -hosts       0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%       0                   0  100%   /net\nmap auto_home    0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%       0                   0  100%   /home\n\nIn this case the removals were in two stages, first doing a \"Smart Scan\" that says \"10.13 GB Unneeded junk removed\", and then using Space Lens to manually select items, after which it says \"CleanMyMac has freed up 30.21 GB of space on your Mac.\"\n\nA: Taking @at0mic's comment as a starting point, I have a theory about what's happening:\n\n\n*\n\n*Since the Time Machine snapshots aren't physical copies, they're still hanging on to the same inodes that CleanMyMac deleted.\n\n\nSince the snapshots didn't take up more room when they were created (see https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-apple-file-systems-killer-feature-clones-and-snapshots/ - they just create one more reference to the same inodes), I also won't get back disk space right away when deleting stuff.\nThis makes sense to me.  However, when I went into Time Machine and performed \"Delete all backups\" on one of the large items I'd deleted, the disk usage as reported by df still didn't reduce.  So I kind of believe that Time Machine is the explanation, but there are still pieces I don't understand, so if I figure it out I'll edit this answer.\n", "Q: Change or disable Content Security Policy in Safari?

I realize a similar question to this has been asked, but it's not the same. The answers in that question are for older versions of MacOS. I'm asking this question specifically for MacOS Catalina 10.15.\n\nA: macOS has a built in method for changing/adding keyboard shortcuts\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Go to Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\n\n*Click the \"+\" button and select Safari from the Application drop down menu\n\n*In the Menu Title box enter the EXACT wording of that menu selection \"Email This Page\" (it must be exact, capitalization, spaces, etc)\n\n*Assign a keyboard shortcut you would never use, like Shift-Command-Option-Ctrl-I\n\n*Click Add and close system preferences\n\nNote now that the Command-I in that menu has been changed to whatever you set it to, allowing you to set Command-I to something else, or just leaving it that way so you won't accidentally use it.\n\nA: Add these to your shortcuts, and try restarting your computer.

This broke Safari navigation for many sites. Firefox and Chrome work fine on the same sites.\nCan Safari navigation be fixed?\n\nA: I had same issue (same macOS/Safari versions).\nI solved it for myself by installing USERTrust RSA Certification Authority SHA-2 root certificate from Sectigo website. It is in a knowledge base article called How to Download & Install Sectigo Intermediate Certificates - RSA.\nGo to Sectigo website -> Support -> Knowledge Base, and it is the most viewed article as of this writing. The SHA-2 root certificate is towards the bottom of the article (just above the expired one).\nAfter downloading, I opened the certificate in Keychain Access. It is untrusted by default, so I did right-click -> Get Info on the certificate, expanded the Trust part and chose When using this certificate: always trust. You need a macOS admin password to make the change. When I did it first time, my computer became unresponsive... (old 2008 MacBook), but after a reboot I could repeat the change and it went without a hitch.\nI'm not a certificate expert so I don't promise it is the \"right kind\" of workaround, or it works for all websites. I just tried the one website which was failing me before, and I saw Safari is now using the newly installed SHA-2 root certificate for it.\nHope that helps.\nCheers.\n\nA: Same issue here; a temporary (not production-ready) fix is to set back your system date.\n\nA: An insecure method to work around the certificate expiration is to tell your macOS to Always Trust this certificate.\nWhen loading the site in Safari and seeing the \"Safari can't verify the identity...\" click Show Certificate, select the \"Comodo RSA Certification Authority\", then check the box that says \"Always trust this certificate\".\nTo reverse this, you should see a new entry in Keychain Access.app in the login keychain that shows this certificate as Always Trusted, which you can change back to \"Use System Defaults\".\nNote that blindly accepting an expired certificate is a risky proposition, and use at your own risk.  (Say, if this Certificate Authority were compromised and revoked, Safari could show malicious sites as Secure. Rare, but has happened in the past.)\nI've not yet found a way to install an updated AddTrust/Comodo Root CA that solves this issue.\n", "Q: Error trying to install any macOS version in macbook 2010 mid I have a problem that I have not been able to solve for weeks, and nowhere do I find a solution to this, perhaps someone with more knowledge will help me and help others with this thread, the problem is as follows\nI have a 2010 macbook mid, and I had high sierra installed, I want to go to catalina, use the catalina patcher to perform the entire procedure exactly as indicated by others as well\n\nusb botteable utilize 2\nformat use all\nAlso try to install it without usb\nuse OS image from internet downloaded via torrent or download it from the catalina patcher app itself\nuse also mojave patcher and high sierra patcher\n\nwhen entering the bootable formatie as apfs guid, and also use the mac os format\nI have the same error\nafter starting the installer after 2 minutes it goes to a screen that shows the error\n\"MacOS cannot be installed on your computer\"\nan error occurred while installing macOS, to use apple diagnostics to check your mac's hardware, turn off the computer, etc, etc\nTo see the diagnostic error, it does not show anything, only the planet and an exclamation point, nor using the internet cable.\n\nI also changed the DATE to finish changing the date from 2016 to 2021 and I don't solve it\n\nI think from my point of view that the error is in the image that is downloaded by OSX (although the downloaded megabytes seem the correct size), can it be that you have to use a virgin image?

I think your machine is too old to install Catalina. You should check the system requirements for Catalina. It doesn't list a 2010 MacBook as being compatible.\n\nA: TLDR format the disk as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and not as APFS before running the installer.\nI had this error today on a 13\" MacBook Air 2012 trying to install macOS Catalina 10.15.5. I first tried with Command+R and then with Command+Option+R. When this error appeared I used the menu to show the Log. I scrolled the log up until the line before it mentions the install failing and it said something like this:\nClearing automation and attempting to rebless\nTo me this looked like an APFS error, so I used disk utility to format the hard drive as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and then attempted the install again and it fixed this problem and the install worked. Because one stage of the installer is to convert the disk the resulting install was APFS despite starting as Mac OS Extended Journaled.\nThis was with an Internet recovery install so I suppose the downloaded install dmg cannot be extracted to an APFS volume yet and set as bootable, hopefully Apple fix that.\n\nA: dosdude1.com/software.html has a free OS patcher with simple instructions.

This is my first iPhone and I like it.\nIt is now asking me to install a Software Update. What is a Software Update and why is it needed?\nIs it okay to install it? I have never used an iPhone before, and I want to make sure I am doing it right.\n\nA: \nWhat is a Software Update and why is it needed?\n\nA software update is released by Apple whenever they have improvements to the core software running on your iPhone. This core software, the operating system, is named iOS and is responsible for general functioning of your iPhone.\nA software update can add new software features to your iPhone, fix issues with general functioning of the operating system software and add enhancements that improve the security of the device.\n\nIs it okay to install it?\n\nIt is perfectly normal, even recommend to install a Software Update on your iPhone. Installing a software update most often would require a restart of your iPhone. The restart would be performed automatically as a part of installing the Software Update.\nOnce started, installing a Software Update can take from a few minutes to around half an hour of time. So make sure not to install it when you would be needing your iPhone for normal usage such as making/receiving phone calls and messages.\n\nI have never used an iPhone before, and I want to make sure I am doing it right.\n\nA software update should work fine most of the times. You need not worry too much about it. However, it may be a good idea to take a backup of your iPhone.\n\nTo learn more about iOS, the operating system software running on your iPhone, check this link:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/ios/\nTo learn more about installing software update on an iPhone, you can read this Apple Support article:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204204\nTo learn more about the ways to take a backup of your iPhone, you can read this Apple Support article:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/HT203977\n\nA: What is a software update\nA software update is release by Apple whenever there are improvements made to iOS. \nWhy is a software update needed\nA software update can fix bugs, glitches and exploits on your firmware. Some updates improve the security of your phone while others may add new features, UI updates or bug fixes. It is highly recommended to update your iPhone to the latest firmware.\nHow to update\nUpdating your iPhone is quite easy and almost nothing can go wrong\nUpdating without a computer\n\nPlug your device into power and connect to the Internet with Wi-Fi.\n  Go to Settings > General, then tap Software Update.\nTap Download and Install.\nTo update now, tap Install.\nIf asked, enter your passcode.\n\nSource: https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204204\nUpdating with a computer\n\nOn a Mac with macOS Catalina 10.15, open Finder. On a Mac with macOS Mojave 10.14 or earlier, or on a PC, open iTunes.\nPlug in your iPhone.\nClick General or Settings, then click Check for Update.\nClick Download and Update.\n\n\nA: Yes you should install it. Apple is constantly tweaking the iOS operating system and patching possible gaps in the system. Most updates feature security upgrades and new features. it's a regular feature of iPhones. The upgrades will install seamlessly by just clicking to install. Very simple.\n", "Q: Does the MacBook Pro built-in screens support HDR? On this Apple support article, it seems to say that the MacBook Pro introduced in 2018 or 2019 supports HDR on its built-in display. However, for what I understand, MacBook screens are not bright enough to support HDR. I also have not seen any HDR settings on my 2020 MacBook Pro, nor is HDR touted in Apple's computer specs. \nDo MacBook screens support HDR? \n\nA: No, not yet. Maybe someday. I'm really looking forward to that day. Hopefully it is the same day that the MacBook Air supports HDR.\n", "Q: Dial long USSD code on iPhone I am trying to dial a USSD code like this: \n*222*88*56167828873588501034*123*344*6842371612#\n\nBut when I press the call button nothing happens, however if I delete the # character at the end, the iPhone tries to call by an instant and then the call ends.\nSome shorter USSD codes can be dialed, for example:\n*222*88*8202117*04450*234567#\n\nI need suggestions to force long USSD code to be dialed and to know if there is any way to program it in Swift, in that case I could make an app that forces the iphone to dial the codes.\n\nA: Unstructured service data requests are touchy in my experience.\nI usually verify my iOS settings are up to date, then check for a carrier settings update and then go straight to my cellular carrier for help when I can’t use one. They often find a problem with the cell tower or can tell me they flat out don’t support the request I’m making.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_Supplementary_Service_Data\nYou’re not hitting the common limit of 182 alphanumeric characters but I’m not familiar with 222 request. Since this brings up a bidirectional channel between your phone and the carrier equipment they should be able to diagnose precisely what’s happening on the tower side. I do my updates so they don’t say “talk to apple” or “restart your device” since it’s really on them to validate that the precise string you sent got encoded and received and look at their logs to see why your request crashed their stack to respond to the request. You know your device is sending and you know your device can send messages millions of times longer - just open Safari and listen or watch to 10 seconds of content. The problem almost certainly isn’t your radio, device, OS.\n", "Q: Compare between Apple Mac computers I am thinking about purchasing an Apple Mac computer. But I am confused between the different types of Apple Macs available.

It would be nice if I can compare between different computers side-by-side to see how the features and specifications differ?\n\nA: Apple's official website has a compare section for Macs where you can compare between three different models of Mac simultaneously. You can access it by going to the following link:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/\nWhen making a purchase decision, the first distinction that you have to make is whether you are looking to buy a desktop or a laptop.\nBroadly speaking, Apple currently makes three kind of laptops:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Air - A 13\" ultra-portable.\n\n*13\" MacBook Pro - A lightweight laptop for professionals.\n\n*16\" MacBook Pro - A spec heavy laptop geared towards users needing extreme performance.\nand three kinds of desktops:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac mini - A bare bones lunch-box size computer sans display, keyboard and mouse.\n\n*iMac - A fully integrated desktop computer.\n\n*Mac Pro - An expandable desktop tower for users requiring extreme performance.\nOnce you have filtered down to the determine computers that you are looking to choose from, head over to the Mac - Compare Models web-page and select the desired ones. You can compare upto three different computers at a time.\nHere's a comparison between a 16\" MacBook Pro, a 13\" MacBook Pro and a 21.5\" iMac looks like:\n\n", "Q: Deleted user content by accident I was trying to empty the trash from terminal because Xcode was stuck in it, but I accidentally removed the trash from the path and ran sudo rm -rf ~/ I thought for a moment i was changing the directory. \nThe question is how do I repair the user folders and everything else, icloud and appstore won't login it says unknown error.\n\nA: The first thing I would try is to log-out and log-in again. In most cases, this will fix your problem.\nIf not, you have to create a new user account and transfer the data which is left to this new user account. I don't recommend copying the whole Library to the new user account because it could be that your Library is damaged too. I would just copy individual folders like Application Support, Services and so on.\n", "Q: How to remove iCloud alert badge from macOS settings icon How can I get rid of this annoying red badge on the Settings icon? I want to see such a badge when there is an update available, not for making me use iCloud if I don't want or need it.\n\n\n\nA: Did you try to sign out from iCloud an the App Store and rebooting your Mac?\nThis solved the problem for many people I know...\nI hope this helps!!\n", "Q: Connecting a Mixer to iPad Pro I would like to know if I can connect and use a Behringer Xenyx 1002FX mixer, with an C-1 (Behringer) condensor mic connected, to my iPad for recording with Garageband or Audacity.  \n\nA: I just googled your mixer and it appears that this device doesn't have a USB-Interface to get a digital signal of the mixer's output.\nYou need a digital audio interface like the Behringer U-Phoria UMC204HD. You can then plug your mixer into the audio interface and connect the audio interface to the iPad Pro using a USB-Adapter.\n", "Q: Force bluetooth usb adapter Mac Catalina I'm having trouble forcing my mac to stay connected to my external USB Bluetooth adapter on reboot/restart.\nI've read quite a few posts and have found this command\nsudo nvram bluetoothHostControllerSwitchBehavior=always\n\nI was able to use Bluetooth Explorer and I switched it to the new bluetooth USB dongle but it will still not remain connected after reboot. Instead it remains disconnected and I have to reconnect it every time I restart my computer.\nMachine:\n2018 Mac Mini\nCurrent OSx: Catalina 10.15.5\nExternal Bluetooth Adapter:\nAsus BT400\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Receiver-Keyboards-Controllers-USB-BT400/dp/B00DJ83070\nTheir are windows drivers but not for mac since it uses the same Broadcom chipset.\nIs there another command that I can use that will keep it connected after reboot?\n\nA: I think that the macOS system integrity protection is stopping your external Bluetooth adapter from getting reconnected after a restart.\nYou could disable the system integrity protection (https://www.imore.com/how-turn-system-integrity-protection-macos) and try again, but this is not a permanent solution since you shouldn't disable the system integrity protection.\n", "Q: External drive's files not showing, but I know it has been half-filled with data. It works fine on Ubuntu but not on macOS? My external hard drive used to work just fine (my OS is Mojave) - I can read and write because I used NTFS Paragon software free trial. But now that I wiped all traces of said software, my external hard drive won't show its contents anymore. I know it's not a problem of the hard drive because when I click on Get Info it says it's half-full. And when I use Ubuntu, I can see and edit the files.\nI tried Disk Utility (unmounting,mounting,repairing), booting into Recovery Mode and using Disk Utility to perform the same steps, leaving the external drive for hours, but none worked. \nPlease help!\nEDIT: Solved. I reinstalled NTFS For Mac, restarted by 10-day trial.\n\nA: On extra checking macos should be able to Read ntfs but not write. But this solution should still work\nIf you have removed paragon then you have removed the programs that can convert binary data on the disk into something macos understands. Thus you need something like paragon for macos to read it  \nNow Ubuntu includes the programs to convert the binary data to something Linux can read. So gives a possible solution. \nI think the solutions are\n\n\n*\n\n*restore from a backup not under ntfs eg from you cloud backup. You should always have something like that if you use a Computer  \n\n*Use paragon or something like that to read the data. \n\n*Boot into Ubuntu or Windows and copy the data to another drive formatted in a way that Linux or Windows and macos can read  I think that has to be exFat. Copy the data onto this drive. Or copy to a network file server  or cloud based server. Then reboot into macos and copy the data from the exfat partition. \n\n", "Q: iCloud storage showing data for Pages but no documents are saved - what is it? In my iCloud storage it says that just over 100kb are being used by Pages. I used to use Pages a while back but never saved anything to iCloud drive. On checking iCloud drive there were no documents in there. I'm confused about what data Pages is saving to my iCloud - I know it is a very small amount of memory taken up but just wanted to know if anyone knows what might be saved in there and if it safe to delete it.\nThere is also around 20kb taken up by iCloud drive - other documents, no idea what this is either.\nAs seen in the screenshots below there are no documents in either section - just 'data' - whatever that is.\n\n\n\nA: There’s no harm in cleaning up iCloud Documents. I go to the web interface since then I’m 100% sure I see what’s actually in iCloud and not what’s temporarily synced to a device - sometimes a device can lag or get stuck. Cleaning the source is my best advice.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/\nBefore you delete - review recently deleted items and purge them if you want. Then delete all the files you don’t want. Once that’s done on the server side, review that each Mac and iOS device sees the delete or clean out local copies they have that didn’t sync up correctly.\nIn your images - you can safely clear the data, but if you do the math 101 KB divided by 5.0 GB is 20 parts per million (25 ppm if you include all the other documents as well). It’s not even a rounding error.\n\nA: If you happen to have an iPhone, it becomes a lot easier. \nCurrently, I guess that you’re getting the 100kb data via System Preferences -> iCloud -> Manage Storage -> Documents. \nThis only shows you the used space and a button to delete all there is. That is bad UI. \nOn iPhone’s equivalent of that setting, you find all documents listed. So since you tagged your post with iPhone too, give it a try. \n\nIf that also fails, download the relevant data from \nhttps://privacy.apple.com/\n", "Q: What procedure should be followed post spilling fluids onto a MacBook keyboard? I know the first thing to do is dry with a towel the majority of the fluid. Next is to turn off the computer. Then flip over the laptop itself and whilst upside down cool dry the keyboard with a hairdryer for a few minutes. Also leave the computer upside down for a day or so. Is there anything I’m missing?\n\nA: I'm writing this answer in the hopes to dispel the myths surrounding liquid damage repair.  Putting the device in a bag of rice, in the oven, in the sunlight, next to a radiator, heater vent, use a blow dryer, etc. are all nonsense \"fixes\" that gives you a false sense of security.  You can actually do more damage after drying things out and powering things on following these internet fixes. \nNo. Do NONE of this.\nThe only exception is to turn it off, immediately.\n\n*\n\n*Do not use a towel to \"wipe\" it up as you're going to spread and \"push\" liquid deeper into cracks and crevices.  Put it on a towel and pat it dry with (preferably) paper towels.\n\n\n*Do not turn it upside down as gravity will pull that liquid across unaffected areas of the machine\n\n\n*Do not put it in rice or some other desiccant hoping that it will somehow fix the problem.  Rice can't fix anything but hunger pangs.\n\n\n*Do not put it next to a radiator, in the sunlight, or use a hair dryer.  Once you evaporate the liquid, whether by heating or just though the natural evaporation process, contaminants are still left over.\nWhy?\nIt needs to be cleaned.\nA simple water spill isn't so simple.  The impurities in water are what makes water electrically conductive.  Pure (distilled) water cannot conduct electricity so it actually cannot harm your computer. The problem is water has salts and contaminants and it's this that causes damage to your Mac.\nRemoving all power and getting it to a competent technician within hours of the spill - not days is the only sure fire way to protect and contain liquid damage. Any other action rolls the dice and can allow capillary action to let liquid seep to every crack, crevice and corner of the device and cause corrosion and short circuits since the battery is still powering parts of the machine when off.\nThis also is a safety issue if the water gets into the charged battery.\nBeverages of different sorts can wreak havoc, salts (metals) are conductive so thing can short out.  There can be acids (juice) or bases (milk) that can cause corrosion.  Corroded circuits can actually destroy components and the traces embedded within the PCB.  For a refresher, take a look at the Mythbusters episode \"Salsa Escape\" and see what running a small current through the acidic salsa mixture can do to steel.  Now apply that to the tiny \"width of a hair\" copper traces on a PCB.\n\nHow to clean a liquid damaged MacBook\nIf you don't have the technical skills, don't do this!  Take it in for service.\nThis needs to be professionally cleaned with an ultrasonic cleaner and electrical solvent.  This requires the logic board to removed, cleaned in the solvent and rinsed in 90% isopropyl  alcohol (not the 70% stuff as there's too much water content).  Then it needs to be dried and subsequently tested.\nCan you use cotton swabs and isopropyl alcohol?  Possibly, but it's not reliable.  You'll have better results cleaning the case with this method than you will the PCB or electronic components.  Using alcohol or electrical solvent with a soft nylon bristle brush (toothbrush) will be much better.  You still will want to wash it completely with alcohol and dry with compressed air.\nNow, while this will help with the logic board, liquid that happened to get into and in between components (i.e. the glass panes in a track pad) and subsequently evaporated will leave behind whatever residue was in the liquid. This may cause the component to become inoperable. The part might need to be individually cleaned or replaced.\nTL;DR\n\n*\n\n*Stay calm.  I know you've just watched your $3,000 baby get a shower from a $6 Starbucks Frap-a-something-chino, but a clear head will help you by not making the problem worse. Consider your data and your time and your budget. The chance of getting the data back improves the sooner and more correctly you act to get the storage separated from the potentially damaged electronics.\n\n\n*Turn off the machine.  No power in, no charging, less power coming out of the battery, no blowers running to spread the liquid internally, less chance the next steps will cause a short circuit. Liquids don’t damage files and storage immediately, electrical failure and process mistakes do.\n\n\n*Using lots of paper towels, attempt to absorb as much as the liquid as you can.  Don't wipe; pat or blot; wiping can \"push\" the liquid making things worse.\n\n\n*Take it for service right away - time is a factor here.  Give the tech full details.  He/she has seen it all and there's no reason to be embarrassed - the more info they have, the better they can get right to the problem and rescue your Mac with a high degree of success.\n\nA: microelectronics are very delicate  and it is the duty of every owner to protected this delicate devices  water is a very serious chock  to every components because it electrocutes.  the whole board instantly   and the damage is not fixable...when owners of lap tops are careless  they kill the motherboards  instantly..the flow of signals is very acurate and when water touches this flow of signals it fries, the system,,forever death.. right away  no magician  can fix this delicates  super boards..!!  is like being hit with high voltage. of water..\n", "Q: Is it possible to pair two separate sets of AirPods to a single iOS device? I'm aware that iOS 13 allows the audio from two separate sets of AirPods to be shared - however, I'm interested in whether two sets of AirPods can be paired to a single iOS device and listened to individually. As an example, you may have a set that you use at work, and another set at home - is this setup currently allowed by iOS?\n\nA: Yes - I have AirPods Pro and AirPods and use them when I need the features of one or the other. They both pair to my devices so I can use whichever one I choose to open and use with the same device that’s playing.\n\n\n*\n\n*What’s new in iOS 13 is one source can go to two devices - not that two different pods can pair simultaneously and connect sequentially like in the past.\n\n", "Q: How should I handle total freeze upon launching iPhone simulator? I updated Xcode (11.4.1) this afternoon and noticed the new iPhone SE 2 simulator option. Cool! My iOS app was running fine on my physical device and all simulator before this update, but now when I launch the simulator, it freezes my MBP (2019 16\", Catalina 10.15.4) while attempting to run. I can still move the mouse, but nothing else responds, and I'm forced to do a hard reset. Anyone else having this issue? Any suggestions on how to approach fixing this? I don't particularly want to keep trying it, only to repeatedly force reset my Mac.\n\nA: Turned out this was a pretty fundamental hardware issue related to the graphics card with new 16\" MBP. Not sure how many machines are affected, but it's easy enough to find threads and forums with owners discussing this issue. I met with a Mac technician at an Apple store and fortunately, she had seen the issue and immediately agreed to replace the machine. The new machine they gave me has also had a handful of kernel panics, but of a different sort, and they seem to have stopped suddenly after a few days of use. Keeping Apple on speed dial though if more issues arise.\n", "Q: How to transfer iMessage texts from Mac to iPhone? I accidentally deleted some messages from my iPhone but they still appear on my Mac as I haven't enabled iCloud for messages on either device. Is there any way to transfer the old messages from my mac to my phone?\n\nA: Yes, you can still sync them through iCloud. Try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*If possible, make a Time Machine backup (no troubles expected, it's just good idea to make a backup of important info that you have only in one place);\n\n*Enable iCloud sync for messages on Mac;\n\n*Leave it charging and on Wi-Fi for several hours so messages could sync.\n\n*Enable iCloud sync for messages on the phone;\n\n*Tap \"Merge\" when prompted;\n\n*Leave the phone on Wi-Fi and charging so messages could sync.\n\n", "Q: Why can't I use the windows 10 boot stick I created for my MBP?

I'm having an issue regard MacOS (Mojave 10.14.6) for some time now:\nIf I'm not in Mission Control mode I can instantly change between the desktops using the keyboard (ctrl+direction, left or right).\nHowever if I'm in Mission Control mode and try to change desktops with the same approach I have a delay of like 1 or 2 seconds.\nSomeone else having the same issue? There's some type of fix for that?\n\nA: This is more of a performance issue than anything else.\nBringing up Mission Control is already a pretty complex split-second animation for your Mac to handle, especially if you have several windows open in your current desktop.\nAnd if you have multiple desktops with several windows open, it has to render all the windows, grouped by application per desktop, and give them a different effect than usual (drop shadows are applied on the window group rather than individual windows in Mission Control) and so on.\nBasically, it's a more complex task for your Mac to do, and since you're on Mojave, system UI is largely Metal, so if you have an nVidia chip or older intel graphics with no Metal 2 support, unfortunately it will feel like molasses.\nThe only solution would be to upgrade your hardware, or turn off the special effects by going to System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Display then checking reduce motion, reduce transparency, either one or both, depending on what you are willing to give up and how much of an improvement checking the options yield.\n", "Q: kernel_task uses up over 50% cpu usage until I open Activity Monitor My mac is slower than it used to be a week ago. I may have downloaded some sort of malware, but I did a Malwarebytes scan and it found absolutely nothing on my computer. I also personally scanned through all the files and found nothing suspicious.\nThe problem is that when I open Activity Monitor, it displays a very high cpu usage for a second, then it immediately goes down. I have seen examples of this where the virus only activates when the cpu usage is not shown.\nI am completely up to date with my OS and software updates, so I am very certain that the operating system itself is not the problem.\n\nA: Maybe you could get a CPU monitor to check the status beside the Activity Monitor. This way you could tell if its really tied to activity monitor. I have an app called  CPU LED which shows a string of colors indicating CPU usage but there are several in addition to this. Doing an app store search on CPU Monitor brings up about 50 hits. You can scan through these to find one that suits your needs. Then if it is tied to Activity Monitor you could download a mac virus checker with a free trial period and run it on your machine.\n", "Q: Using Apple Pencil as a stylus with older unsupported iPads I have a bunch of old iPads lying around which are still in pretty much usable state.

Start this app and see if your disk shows up, Disk Utility has an option to erase the disk. You can erase the disk and then create a partition formatted to whatever format you want. After that, I'd run First Aid on the disk to see if there are any problems. Disk Utility will fix most problems it encounters.

I'm using keynote 8.2 and have the show working just fine showing 218 slides automatically. But I do not want it to auto start. I want the the first slide displayed until triggered, and then I want it to play through until it's back to the first slide and want it to stop there until triggered.\nIs it possible to have a Keynote deck pause at one slide only, but play the rest through?\n\nA: You can do this inside of Keynote. Right-click on the Animate tab at the top of the right sidebar. You don't need any transition effect so to simplify things I'll use none. Now click on Select All from the Edit menu item. you can see all your slides are selected by looking at the snapshots on the left. Now go back to the right sidebar and where it says Start Transition, pull the menu down and select automatically, and set the delay for the time you want each slide to appear. Now unselect all the slides and click to select 1st one only. Now go back to the right sidebar and for this one slide change the Transition to Automatically with a delay of 600 secs. That's the maximum delay so slide show will start automatically after 10 minutes.\nNow you have your animation set up you can click the play button at the top of the Keynote window. This will bring up the 1st slide but it will do nothing until you click. Then it will start displaying all the slides for the number of seconds you entered.  if you need a longer or shorter time for a specific slide, click on that slide in the left sidebar and then in the right sidebar change the Delay Time to a new value.  Now try playing it again.\nAfter you have all the delays set you can also go to Keynote Live at the top of the Keynote window and click that button. This will allow you to issue invitations and then saves the presentation so all you have to do is click on the Green Play button at the top and the presentation will begin.\nThe 10-minute max delay time was the only way I could get the presentation to stay on slide one for any length of time.

How do I fix slow wifi on an iPhone XR (iOS 13.4.1)?\nThe boss has an iPhone XR (iOS 13.4.1), and I have an iPhone 6 (iOS 12.4.5). The iPhone 6 gets 100% better Mbps throughput around my house. I have validated my router health and validated network setup on both phones. I have done all the reset/forget network cycling recommended by guides like this and this and this.\nI measure the same performance percentage difference--iPhone 6 performs roughly 110% better--in all these tested scenarios:\n\n*\n\n*802.11 b/g/n 2.4 GHz network connection on both phones, simultaneously\n\n*802.11 ac 5 GHz network connection on both phones, simultaneously (first screenshot)\n\n*Bluetooth off (second screenshot)\n\nMy test was:\n\n*\n\n*hold both phones in hand\n\n*test average Mbps download speeds using Wi-Fi Sweetspots app\n\n*average over ~10 seconds\n\n*test 6 different spots around the house\n\n*record results\n\nHere are the side-by-side results of the latter two tests; left side is iPhone XR + iOS 13.4.1, right side is iPhone 6 + iOS 12.4.5\n\nTest with bluetooth radio off on both phones:\n\nIn both tests, \"Spot 4\" is standing directly next to the Wifi router.\nUpdate:\nHere are the recorded results in a Google Spreadsheet for at least 6 tests. The 5 of the top 6 results were for the iPhone 6 + iOS 12.4.5 combination.\n\nUpdate 2:\n\n*\n\n*both devices were tested without cases.\n\n*I have tested on four different routers: 2 models of Netgear, TPLink AV600, cheap-o ActionTek. Results were consistent across all 4 routers: iPhone 6 consistently had 100%+ better throughput.\n\nUpdate 3:\nMy wifi was assigned to channels 7@2.4GHz and 44@5GHz, which my network analysis showed to be the only thing in the area on that channel. Also conducted a second test on alternate channels, with exclusive access; same results.\nUpdate 4:\nBoth Phones were restarted occasionally, but not between every documented run. There was definitely a restart in the iPhoneX at least twice: once when the documented tests started, and once when I upgraded it from 13.3 to 13.4.1. Over the course of the few weeks that I have been observing the throughput metrics, the phones have been restarted ad-hoc and the slow relative behavior persists.\nUpdate 5:\nThe following settings were in place at the time of the test:\n\n*\n\n*Automatic Updates: Off\n\n*AirDrop: Receiving Off\n\n*Handoff: Off\n\n*Wi-Fi Calling: Off\n\n*iTunes Wi-Fi Sync: Off\n\nA: There is nothing to fix\nWhat you measure are hardware and software differences.\nThe 2 iPhones you compare have a different internal density of components\nand different radio hardware.\nWith higher density of components a lot of internal reflections\noccurs very near from the emitting source of radio frequency.

Did you put the router behind something because some objects that are really hard or impossible for Wi-Fi signals to pierce through. Another thing you can try is changing your WiFi channel. To do that you can use Nirsoft’s WifiInfoView(https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wifi_information_view.html)\n\nA: As discussed in the comments, you did a sufficiently detailed comparison of both devices speeds, and covered the things you can try with software. Therefore I suggest to test the hardware:\nTest another iPhone XR.\nIf the results are the same, the wifi unit in the iPhone XR is in some ways worse than the one in iPhone 6. If the results of the second XR are much better, the first XR is a defective unit and should be replaced by Apple warranty.\n", "Q: How to use unix executable file if double clicking it doesnt work?

I use an iCloud shared photo album to share photos and videos with my family, but I'm slowly reaching the limit of 5000 photos and videos per album, so I'm considering migrating this album to Google Photos, with its current limit of 20000 photos or videos per album.\nHow can I copy this iCloud Photos shared album to Google Photos, ideally along with all metadata?\n\n*\n\n*All photos and videos, the reduced resolution stored on iCloud is sufficient\n\n*Capture date/time, so that the pictures and videos are sorted chronologically\n\n*Comments, at least those I wrote myself, ideally also those added by my family\n\nBecause of the big number of pictures involved, I'd like to limit the number of manual steps in this procedure.\nMaybe there's even an app for that?\n\nA: Workflow on macOS Catalina:\n\n*\n\n*Ensure you have enough disk space and bandwidth available for downloading the Shared Album to your Mac.\nFor migrating a shared album with 4800 photos and videos, I needed approximately 20 GB free disk space.\n\n\n*Create a dedicated account for the migration on your Mac.\nThis is an optional step. It is useful if you want to back up only the photos and videos from the iCloud Shared Album to Google, and not the other photos from your System Photo Library.\nIn the System Preferences, under Systems & Groups, unlock to make changes and click the + button to add a user account. Log in with this account. When macOS prompts you to log in to your iCloud account, use an iCloud account that has access to the shared album.\n\n\n*Open Photos, select Shared Albums, and wait for the Shared Album to be synced.\nIn the meantime, deactivate iCloud Photos in the Photos Preferences, so that your photos and videos won't be uploaded and stored to iCloud another time.\nYou can monitor the download activity in the Network tab of the Activity Monitor.\n\n\n*Copy the photos from the Shared Album on your Mac (only the photos, videos will be tackled in the next step.)\nSee Archive or make copies of the information you store in iCloud:\na. Open Photos and select Shared Albums.\nb. Double-click the shared album.\nc. In the top right corner, next to Showing Only, choose Show only Photos.\nd. Select all photos (Command-A).\ne. Control click (or right-click) a photo and choose Import.\n\n\n*Copy the videos from the Shared Album to your Photos library.\na. Create a folder on your Mac, e.g. on the Desktop.\nb. Open Photos and select Shared Albums.\nc. Double-click the shared album.\nd. In the top right corner, next to Showing Only, choose Show only Videos.\ne. Select all videos (Command-A).\nf. Drag-and-drop the videos to a folder on your Mac.\ng. With all videos still selected in Photos, open the File menu and, under Export, click Export Unmodified Original for all Videos. Ensure that Export IPTC as XMP is selected in the dialog, and confirm the Export in the same folder.\nThis creates XMP files containing the date for your videos. The Photos app currently needs this workaround with external XMP files so that the date information does not get lost when you import videos.\nh. Import the videos back from the folder to Photos: In the folder, Sort by type or Group by type in the View menu, and select all the video files: Only the video files, not the XMP files. Drag-and-drop the videos to Photos.\ni. Delete the folder you used to transfer the videos from the Shared Album to Photos.\n\n\n*Use Google Backup and Sync to automatically backup photos from your Mac.\nSelect Upload newly added photos and videos to Google Photos in the preferences.\nIn the Network Settings, it is possible to limit the Upload Rate.\nThis procedure won't copy comments, though.\n\nA: Apple has a cloud to cloud solution to export your photos and videos from iCloud to Google. In the initial form, this transfer tool does not move shared albums, just your personal albums, do you might need to convert all of the shared albums to local ones and then re-share them out later on the Google side.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208514\n\nThe transfer process takes between three and seven days. We use this time to verify that the request was made by you, and to make the transfer\n\n\nOnly content stored in iCloud Photos is transferred. Photos and videos are transferred either in the original format or in industry-standard formats that are easy to open and read.\n\n\nThis service is initially available to customers in Australia, Canada, the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States for transfers to Google Photos.\n\n\nA: You can do this on your iOS device e.g. iPhone. Workflow on iOS 13.5.1:\n\n*\n\n*Based on your needs, clean up the photos and videos on your device before proceeding, as all photos and videos present on your device will be uploaded to your Google photos account.\n\n*Ensure there's enough free space on your device to download the photos: In the Settings, under General, check the iPhone Storage. I needed approx. 20 GB for my shared album containing approx. 5000 photos and videos.\n\n*Ensure that the iPhone won't get to sleep, as the download / upload operation might take some time, depending on your network bandwidth: In the Settings app, under Display & Brightness, set Auto-Lock to Never.\n\n*Download the photos and videos from the iCloud shared album to your device:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Shared Album you want to download in the Photos app.\n\n*Tap Select in the top-right corner, then Select All in the top-left corner.\n\n*Tap the Share button. You might want to include All Photos Data in the sharing Options before you tap the Save x Items.\n\n*Now wait until the download operation is completed... First, there'll be a Preparing download circular progress indicator. When it disappears, the Photos app will seem to freeze. That's where the upload takes place, so leave your iPhone alone for a while. To track completion, rotate your iPhone and wait until the Photos app rotates to adapt to the screen orientation.\n\n\n\n*Upload the photos and videos to Google Photos: Open the Google Photos app, select the desired Upload size and activate Backup and Sync. You can follow the Backup progress by tapping on your account picture in the top-right corner.\n\nWhen done, remember to set the Auto-Lock back to your preferred settings and feel free to remove the downloaded pictures from your device.\nThis procedure does not copy comments, and it lost the date & time information for most of my videos: 500 out of 800 videos appear as if being taken at the time when I downloaded them to my device.\n", "Q: Migration Assistant fail I just completed my first ever Time Machine migration… or I thought I had.\nI just got a new 1TB SSD & PCIe mount to lift my speeds up to full SATA III on an old Mac Pro normally limited to SATA II speeds.\nI decided now would be time to clean up a bit so I'd do a fresh, clean install then migrate, rather than my usual trick of simply cloning it with Carbon Copy Cloner.\nAll appeared to go well. Install went smoothly, I was presented with the Migration tool & asked it to migrate from my Time Machine drive [also internal, last updated only 30 minutes prior]. I selected everything - about 500GB, half full drives, old & new.\nIt busied itself with the copying for a good while, then presented a very long list of esoteric things it couldn't copy - no explanation was given. The list was far too long to give more than a cursory glance to.  I thought I could probably get away with missing a few bits, so long as the main stuff had transferred, so I stepped on to the next part of setup, signing into iCloud etc [there was no other choice but to accept the list of fails, it was OK or nothing.]\nOn finally arriving at the desktop I quickly realised that absolutely nothing had been migrated at all. No Apps, no docs, no music, pictures… zero.\nSo, I'm currently making a new CCC clone.\nAnyone have any idea what may have gone wrong, so much so that absolutely nothing happened after a good half hour of 'being busy'?\nMac Pro 5,1 Mojave 10.14.6 [both old & new installs] 2 x 1TB SSD, 4 other HDs inc one for Time Machine.\nFurther updates\nI've now tried this perhaps 7 times using different strategies. The slimmest version was a brand new Time Machine with a single manual backup, restoring just one account to a wiped SSD. No other drives connected. Both drives on the regular SATA bus, no PCIe card. SIP disabled.\nNo Joy.\nSingle file restoration is fine now, though was really broken before I disabled SIP. All apps showed as 'grey with a no-chance sign'.\nMigration just will not work, neither will a direct Restore from Time Machine to a blank drive.\n\nA: Here are a few notes which might help you. They wouldn't fit all in a comment, so I took the liberty to write half an answer.\nDesign\n\nAnyone have any idea what may have gone wrong, so much so that\nabsolutely nothing happened after a good half hour of 'being busy'?\n\nI've had a similar experience almost 10 years ago. From your description, it doesn't seem that Time Machine has changed much since:\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine uses incremental backups in order to save disk space. Files are described by how they have changed over time. In order to restore a file at a given timestamp, diffs are applied on top of each other, starting at the original state of the file.\n\n*Time Machine uses hard links for folders, which are not supported by other macOS programs or by Linux.\n\n*Time Machine doesn't seem to check the integrity of the backups until they are needed. If any diff, any file or folder gets corrupted, Time Machine does not seem to notice.\n\n*During a migration or a recovery, the whole process stops after the first error. One corrupted file seems to be enough to cancel the recovery.\n\n*If the recovery process fails, no file gets copied at all, not even the files which have been processed before the first error.\n\nAll the above points, together, make for a brittle design. If anything goes wrong, your backup becomes useless, and cannot be read, as is, by any other standard software.\n\"There's no step 3\" doesn't help much when step 1 & 2 fail miserably.\nSolution?\nYour data, or at least a part of it, is probably still readable somewhere on your Time Machine drive.\nI wrote a script in order to get my data back, but cannot find this script anymore. I remember it used ruby, cp -avX, ditto and chmod in order to parse the data and restore as much as possible.\nThere are more recent solutions, though. It seems that they use Linux and either bash or python. More info here. One of the scripts, copy_from_time_machine.py seems promising.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: A5 Printing on A4 with custom flips and unique layout / flow direction How do I get the following print layout?\n\nI would like to be able to print from anything, be that notes or a website or anything else.\nMy mac has only the following layout settings none of which satisfy my criteria. Do you know a way?\n\n\n\n\nA: This looks like a specialized booklet output that you could assemble and then staple in the middle. \nThat usually requires either a printer with that function built-in (we have these at work) or a specialized \"Imposition\" program that will send a document like this to a printer that does not have this feature built in. \nThis is referred to as \"imposition.\" Since your printer does not support imposition  you need to get an application that will impose this particular layout for you and then send it to your printer. Sorry, but I have no idea what form such an app would take, but I do know that such add-ons are available for the likes Adobe InDesign or Quark Express.\nTaking a PDF to a printing service provider would work. Office Supply stores often also offer these services. \n", "Q: Install an older version of MacOS onto an external drive without USB installer? I want to install Mojave onto an external drive, using a Mac that has Catalina as its current OS. The Mac is old enough to run Mojave.\nA specific form of this question has been asked before, to which the answer is \"create a USB installer disk\". \nI'm wondering if it might be possible without this workaround. Firstly, it requires the purchase of a USB stick. Catalina now requires just slightly more than 8GB, so I need a 16 GB stick at least. Admittedly, these are cheap and plentiful. \nBut I already have loads of 8GB sticks and the alternative to buying another bit of hardware is to sacrifice a 500 GB USB drive, which I already have, to become an installer medium.\nHowever, creating an installer disk involves the createinstallmedia command line tool inside the MacOS installer app bundle. There are also several other tools, including: startosinstall, which yields the following info: \nUsage: startosinstall\n\nArguments\n--license, prints the user license agreement only.\n--agreetolicense, agree to the license you printed with --license.\n--rebootdelay, how long to delay the reboot at the end of preparing. This delay is in seconds and has a maximum of 300 (5 minutes).\n--pidtosignal, Specify a PID to which to send SIGUSR1 upon completion of the prepare phase. To bypass \"rebootdelay\" send SIGUSR1 back to startosinstall.\n--installpackage, the path of a package (built with productbuild(1)) to install after the OS installation is complete; this option can be specified multiple times.\n--eraseinstall, (Requires APFS) Erase all volumes and install to a new one. Optionally specify the name of the new volume with --newvolumename.\n--newvolumename, the name of the volume to be created with --eraseinstall.\n--preservecontainer, preserves other volumes in your APFS container when using --eraseinstall.\n--usage, prints this message.\n\n. \nIt seems that there is a --volume flag to set the target drive, but it is only available when the OS has SIP disabled. \nI tried disabling SIP and running startosinstall --volume <my external>, but the process just sat there, and Console was filled with messages about a binary not being signed correctly.\nI suspect further investigation of this aspect of the tool may be required. I'm still hopeful that there's a way of doing this via the command line.\nSo I thought I'd put this information up here, even if it's just to get a confirmatory \"No; duplicate\", because the benefits to the community of getting a method would be large.\n\nA: You don't need a USB stick, you can create a small partition on any existing drive & createinstallmedia to that, then select it with an alt-boot. \nOne thing you do not seem to be able to do is install a new OS to any other disk whilst there is a fully-bootable OS disk already present, it wants to 'update' the existing OS even if it's exactly the same OS.\nYou have to remove any current OS disk first, then it will ask you which to install to.\n[Source of info - just spent the afternoon messing at this myself.]\n\nA: If you have extra space on an internal SSD then you can install the other OS on a new container/partition there. More reliable than external SSDs and their vulnerable USB/Thunderbolt cables.\n", "Q: ssh: Identity not Loaded from Keychain at Startup I have configured a host in my ~/.ssh/config like this\nHost pptest\nIdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_test_2048_pp\nUseKeychain yes\nAddKeysToAgent yes\n\nThis key has a passphrase on it.

You will likely be in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy you (and your parents) signed at the beginning of the school year.  It's much better to ask for permission in this case - see what flexibility they (the school administrators, not the network administrators) have.  If you make a strong enough case, they may work with you on easing restrictions.\n\nA: If you are able to access the main page of a game on Roblox when you are connected to a WiFi connection, good, you are then able to simply click the green play button and then click 'Download and Install Roblox' and do what it says to do and you will have it downloaded and installed. It should automatically download and install Roblox Studio as well. But do not let anyone know that you have done this because if it is blocked then it obviously means that you are not allowed to have/install/download/use it.\n", "Q: MacOS mdfind/mdutil issue and updatedb command : how to index all the files on my /Volume (root /) A simple question : on Linux, updatedb command which is launched a second time seems not to reindex all the hard disk.\nOn MacOS Catalina (or maybe for previous), it seems that the command sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb reindexes all.\nIs there an option for locate.updatedb to only update what's new ?\nI thought about doing : sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb -u but I am not sure.\nmdfind is a great tool but has got no transparency about its dameons mds  : I said this since suddenly on my MacOS, mdfind stopped finding recent files, and it was very frustrating. Moreover,  it takes a long time to index all the Volume (several days in my case, 2TB HD).\nSo I wonder if locate.updatedb command that updates from what is already existing is possible ?\nOn Linux systems, where updatedb is performed, this command is very quick because the whole database is no reindexed.\nI just want not to reindex all the /Volume at each time I launch locate.updatedb on MaOS.\nUPDATE 1: \nI have killed all mds and processes relaled to mdutil and mdfind. Then, I launched yesteray a :\nmdutil -E / : \nhere what I get when I do a ps aux | grep mds : \n$ psu | grep mds\nroot              9607   0.0  0.9 11835260 285804   ??

In contrast to the Linux program, the macOS program does not attempt to reuse existing database data about directories that haven't changed.\nThere's no option for the macOS program that will make it behave like the Linux program.\n", "Q: Migrate SSD to another Mac...should I reinstall macOS? I have a customer who buys a 2012 iMac to replace his old 2010 iMac.  The 2010 iMac has an SSD with macOS 10.13 and would like to replace the mechanical HDD in the newer Mac with the SSD he's got in his 2010 iMac that he recently replaced. \nI have two options to tackle this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I just migrate the SSD from the old iMac to the new iMac.  Then upgrade macOS from 10.13 to a newer macOS.  This will account for any driver incompatibilities as the hardware on the new mac is different.\n\n*I migrate the SSD likewise, but then reformat and reinstall a newer version of macOS, so as to avoid any driver incompatibilities.\nOption 1 is certainly faster and will avoid having to reinstall apps etc.  Will I have major issues with driver compatibility, etc? \nAny help much appreciated.\n\nA: MacOS is largely hardware-agnostic, in that every installation contains all the drivers for all the hardware that it supports. The only exception to that is special builds of the OS created for brand new hardware, released after the latest OS version.\nI have physically swapped or cloned complete drives from one Mac to another for many years, across a range of different models, and OS versions, largely without incident.  \nThe only time cloning didn't worked for me was transferring to a Mac with a T2 chip, and yes, the issue (non-booting) was fixed by reinstalling the OS on top of the cloned data. I have not seen any other problems since then.\nMigration Assistant is a lot better than it used to be, but is not without problems itself, (such as not migrating stuff), but if you want to go that way: copy the drive's contents to some other disk; erase and install the new OS; and then Migrate the data from the backup copy of the SSD's data.\nFWIW, I have just migrated the contents of a 2012 MacBook Pro onto a brand new MBP, connecting the old hard drive directly with a SATA/USB cable, and it took about 8 hours for c. 600 GB of data.\nIt does seem broadly unnecessary to wipe the disk and then put everything back onto it!\n", "Q: Can I mix DDR3 1333 MHz memory with 1666MHz memory on my iMac? I have 2x4GB 1333MHz RAM (Mac memory).  Could I add it to my 2012 iMac  with 2x4GB 1666MHz RAM so I have 4x4GB RAM?.  Will it just run at the slower speed or will this just not work?\n\nA: You can mix memory speeds so long as the memory is faster than the memory specified for your computer.\nThe 2012 iMac calls for PC3-12800 DDR3 and the minimum RAM speed is 1600Mhz (all models iMac in 2012; 21\" and 27\").  So, the 1666MHz RAM will work, but the slower 1333MHz RAM will not. Many, many years of experience has told me not to mix RAM speeds.  While it is \"supposed\" to work just fine, some memory modules aren't very tolerant and can cause issues.  Stick with what's recommenced for best reliability.\n", "Q: Macbook pro 15\", late 2013: internet stopped working I have a macbook pro 15\", late 2013 with Catalina (10.15.4). It was working flawlessly until few hours ago, now internet won't work. I can't find any trace of hardware issue, the wifi card works fine and it connects to wifi networks. Unfortunately even with full signal internet doesn't work, even pinging from the terminal return the \"unknown host\" error.

A first-level Applecare rep recommended shutting down and then turning on my computer to deal with an issue.  Specifically, she told me to do select \"Shut Down\" from the Apple menu, wait 20 seconds, and then turn it back on, explaining this is different from selecting \"Restart\".  \nThis surprised me, because I thought restart incorporated a full shutdown, followed by an auto-restart.   She said no, that the software shutdown executed when one selects \"Restart\" is not as complete as the software shutdown executed when one selects \"Shut Down\".  She further explained, colloquially, that the latter allows the system to more fully reset (and that to truly get a full reset, you additionally wait ~20 seconds before turning it back on). \nIs what she is saying correct?\nIndependent of (but related to) this, my computer freezes unless I do a restart about once a week.  An Applecare engineer explain this is likely because of errors that can accumulate in non-ECC RAM, which a shutdown flushes out.  He said the rate at which they accumulate varies with usage.  For some reason my usage causes fairly rapid accumulation of these errors, which is why I have to reboot more frequently than most.  I have found that restart (as opposed to shutdown + restart) is sufficient for this, suggesting that the former is sufficient to flush RAM.   Is this correct?\n\nA: The only difference is power is actually (mostly) removed from the components (logic board, PCIe bus, etc.)\nThe difference from back in the day, was called a warm restart or a cold restart .\nWhy the difference?\nIt depends on the issue.  If you're having a hardware issue like a track pad not responding or a GPU acting weird, you may be asked to shutdown and then restart, usually removing the power cord and waiting for a period of time in between.  If you're having an issue with a service, like your web server not working, a warm restart is sufficient.\nSo, from a software perspective, they are identical.  From a hardware perspective, the difference is power is actually removed and reapplied.\nNow, usually cold (re)boots are done.\nIt's important to note that an SMC reset sits in between a warm and a cold boot.  When you reset the SMC, you are \"resetting\" the values the chip has accumulated back to factory defaults.  You're forcing the SMC to go back to when it was first initiated and needs to \"relearn\" everything power, temp and fan related with your Mac.  When you reset the SMC, you actually do a warm reset as well.\n\n...my computer freezes unless I do a restart about once a week. \n\nYou have a hardware issue - it's not normal to need to continually reboot a Mac in this manner.\n\nShe further explained...the latter allows the system to more fully reset...you additionally wait ~20 seconds before turning it back on). \n\nTo truly get a cold reboot/reset, you need to disconnect all power.  So depending on your Mac model, you'd need to disconnect the battery as well.\n\nAn Applecare engineer explain this is likely because of errors that can accumulate in non-ECC RAM, which a shutdown flushes out. \n\nThis statement from the Apple engineer is incorrect.\nnon-ECC memory isn't \"building up\" a cache of errors that must be flushed out;  that's not how this works.  While non-ECC memory won't \"fix\" the corrupted data, corruption is actually very rare, especially in desktop computers.    The worst that will happen is a glitch or a hung app.  If you're having this all the time, you may have faulty memory.\nStart by running Apple Diagnostics (Hold D while booting).\n", "Q: iTunes Sever on Synology NAS and Apple Music I have a Synology NAS that's running an iTunes server.  It was setup by my brother and it works. I can share this library with my different Macs around the house (do the models matter)?  Anyway, I would use iTunes to play the music from the server.  Now that I've upgraded to Catalina, I can't get Apple Music to do connect anymore. \nHow can I get Apple Music to see my iTunes server so I can play music?\n\nA: The current release version of the iTunes server for Synology is not compatible with Catalina. If you register a ticket with Synology outlining your problem, they will send you an updated server spk to install.\nHaving said that, there is still a problem which I'm having and I've not been able to find out so far if it's just me or not. The problem I'm seeing is that albums with multiple artists are being listed in the albums list multiple times. once per artist. A real pain for collections.\n", "Q: Can you use a USB Wireless mouse with an iPad through the lightning to USB adapter? just wondering, on my iPad Pro 9.7 running iPadOS 13.5, could I connect a usb wireless mouse using the lightning to USB adapter? And will the mouse provide the same functionality as a bluetooth mouse would?\n\nA: Yes, it should definitely be possible - and it should work with the same functionality as a Bluetooth mouse.\nThe Logitech unifying receiver presents itself to the operating system essentially the same way a cabled mouse does. Therefore iOS works for that receiver without extra \"drivers\" or anything like that.\nI have personally used a Logitech wireless mouse with an iPad before, but I can't say if it is the same exact model of mouse, you have. You might experience that extra buttons for example have no function or similar, but the basics of pointing and clicking should work.\n\nA: Possibly.\nAccording to Apple, if you're on iPadOS 13 or higher it could be possible but devices can differ so the manufacturer would know best.\n\nWith the appropriate cable or adapters, you can connect various third-party mouse devices with iPad using USB and USB-based receivers. Refer to the device manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nI recommend you contact the device manufacturer and ask them.\n", "Q: Live preview of changing image file I'm looking for a software recommendation that will allow me to view an image file that changes frequently, that ideally updates the display within 1 second after the file changes on disk.\nWhy? I'm working with a tool that generates images, and I want to rapidly test out different options. But it's frustrating to open and close the image after every single change. I'd rather just devote half my monitor to showing what the image looks like right now (latest version on disk) and the other half to working on my image generator.\nI've already tried using macOS Quick Look, but it only picks up the first change. After that it doesn't show any more changes.\n\nA: You can save the image file in a folder such that it is the only file in the folder. Whenever you generate a new image save it with the same name to the same folder. Then with the finder window open, have the file viewed using the 3rd view icon. See image below. My image file is a simple plot.\n\nWhenever you generate a new image and replace the old image with new image the view will automatically update.\n", "Q: How to open .TLS files on mac I have a Browning game camera that takes timelapse photos... I was disappointed to discover it records them as huge 1-2 GB .TLS files that require software Browning makes to open, and it only works on windows. \nBrowning suggests Mac users change the files to .AVI, which doesn't work. Are there any other options to open these files or are they inaccessible to Mac users?\n\n\nA: You don’t need to change it to AVI - just rename it back and then drag it into a player like VLC.\nThat software will look inside the file and try to read the header and tell you which encoding and packaging scheme is needed.\nOnce you know the files are correct and play or can get more details, perhaps a follow on question explaining why VLC won’t open it might make sense.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html\nIf you like VLC - then right click on one of the files and choose Open with... and reset all TLC files to open in VLC - you should be set.\n", "Q: iMac restarted 4 times in 24 hours because of a problem I have a 2017 iMac, 27\", with a Fusion HD and it has restarted 4 times over the past 24 hours.\nI saved the last report.\nCan anyone discern even a hint as to what is causing it looking at this report?\npanic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff800584aa3a): Kernel trap at 0xffffff7f86e03e7c, type 14=page fault, registers:\nCR0: 0x000000008001003b, CR2: 0x0000000000000000, CR3: 0x0000000008734000, CR4: 0x00000000003626e0\nRAX: 0x00000000152d0000, RBX: 0x0000000000000001, RCX: 0xffffff80060a5920, RDX: 0x0000000000000000\nRSP: 0xffffff913a32be10, RBP: 0xffffff913a32be30, RSI: 0x00000000152d1561, RDI: 0x0000000000000000\nR8:  0x00000000141e0009, R9:  0xffffff80060a3520, R10: 0x0000000000000500, R11: 0xffffff80188d7000\nR12: 0x0000000000000000, R13: 0xffffff801db8d1d0, R14: 0xffffff8037d32780, R15: 0xffffff7f86e21290\nRFL: 0x0000000000010202, RIP: 0xffffff7f86e03e7c, CS:  0x0000000000000008, SS:  0x0000000000000000\nFault CR2: 0x0000000000000000, Error code: 0x0000000000000000, Fault CPU: 0x0, PL: 0, VF: 1\n\nBacktrace (CPU 0), Frame : Return Address\n0xffffff913a32b870 : 0xffffff800571f5cd \n0xffffff913a32b8c0 : 0xffffff8005858b05 \n0xffffff913a32b900 : 0xffffff800584a68e \n0xffffff913a32b950 : 0xffffff80056c5a40 \n0xffffff913a32b970 : 0xffffff800571ec97 \n0xffffff913a32ba70 : 0xffffff800571f087 \n0xffffff913a32bac0 : 0xffffff8005ec27cc \n0xffffff913a32bb30 : 0xffffff800584aa3a \n0xffffff913a32bcb0 : 0xffffff800584a738 \n0xffffff913a32bd00 : 0xffffff80056c5a40 \n0xffffff913a32bd20 : 0xffffff7f86e03e7c \n0xffffff913a32be30 : 0xffffff8005e148a4 \n0xffffff913a32bea0 : 0xffffff8005e146aa \n0xffffff913a32bec0 : 0xffffff8005761565 \n0xffffff913a32bf40 : 0xffffff8005761091 \n0xffffff913a32bfa0 : 0xffffff80056c513e \n      Kernel Extensions in backtrace:\n         com.apple.iokit.IOUSBMassStorageDriver(157.121.1)[F60C120E-3A73-3BA9-BA89-705178C4EA68]@0xffffff7f86dff000->0xffffff7f86e32fff\n            dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOPCIFamily(2.9)[BE052F4D-9B80-3FCD-B36D-BACB7DEE0DF2]@0xffffff7f86301000\n            dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOUSBHostFamily(1.2)[23C6290C-B42C-3885-B77D-09995CE04183]@0xffffff7f8637b000\n            dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOStorageFamily(2.1)[E13E9C61-F1F5-3A81-B1EF-65669C3CBDBF]@0xffffff7f86065000\n            dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOSCSIArchitectureModelFamily(422.120.3)[74ED4535-074E-31EB-A746-D057DA813124]@0xffffff7f865c1000\n\nBSD process name corresponding to current thread: kernel_task\n\nMac OS version:\n19F101\n\nKernel version:\nDarwin Kernel Version 19.5.0: Tue May 26 20:41:44 PDT 2020;

Typically on my Macbook Pro, I click on URLs to pdf documents and they open in a browser window (say, Safari or Chrome), and later if I wish to keep a copy of the pdf file, I click the down arrow icon.\nHowever, the down arrow icon actually attempts to fetch the pdf file from the server again, whereas I already have a local copy in a browser cache somewhere. So, it is an inefficient use of bandwidth. Furthermore, sometimes the original file may no longer be available at the server, or I may not be having Internet access, etc., and I want to save a copy of the file.\nDo I need to go searching for the file in the browser cache somehow? Or is there a more convenient way?\n\nA: If you have a PDF file in the browser window you can just go to the File menu and save the file. It will save as a regular PDF and you can choose where to save it.\n", "Q: USB Devices not working on Catalina after water spilled over keyboard The other day I spilled water on my MBP 2017 keyboard. I let it dry for 48 hours before turning it on again. And it ran fine.\nEver since that spill, however, I have not been able to use my USB wired mouse on my macbook. Power still runs through it (Charges my iPhone, Powers USB LED) but it does not detect any devices anymore like my USB Wired Mouse.\nWhen I check System Report, it doesn't state any devices plugged in.\n\n\n*\n\n*I tested the mouse on my PC and it works fine.\n\n*I've tried several different USB C to A adapters. Same result.\n\n*I tried restarting several times.\nIs this a software issue or perhaps it's due to water damage?\nEDIT: It still detects my USB Flash Drive, how is this possible?\nSMC doesn't seem to reset when I try to..? Is it normal to immediately fast-boot after performing an SMC reset?\n\nA: \nIs this a software issue or perhaps it's due to water damage?\n\nIt’s water damage.\nThe USB port (this is  a generalized description) has several pins, but it’s basically two categories - data pins and power pins.  Your USB supplies 5V and up to 500mA.  If USB-C, it can be up to 20V.  This comes from the power rails managed by the SMC.  The data pins go to the USB controller chip.  Your symptoms point to the fact that the USB controller took damage.\n\nSMC doesn't seem to reset when I try to..? Is it normal to immediately fast-boot after performing an SMC reset?\n\nAn SMC reset isn’t going to fix the problem because the power portion of all this is working.  The bottom line is that you have physical damage and “a simple water spill isn’t so simple.”  You need to take it in for service.\n", "Q: DVD/CD Drive no longer shows in Finder I tried to drag a DVD to  VLC app. Instead the entire DVD/CD drive just disappeared from Finder.  The drive is still there: I can play a DVD on it.

I am on  Catalina with a Macbook Pro 2020.\nUpdate Here are the Sidebar settings - showing that the External disks and CDs, DVDs, Ipods are enabled:\n\n\nA: The first thing to try is to test the problem in a new user account. If the DVDs show up in the Finder in a new user account, then you know the problem is somewhere in the original user account's Library: a corrupt or misconfigured preference, most likely.\nIf the problem still persists in a new user account, then you know it is at a System level: so either a bug in the OS itself, or some weird interaction with third-party software installed in /Library, or possibly a global preference that is similarly corrupt or misconfigured.\nGoing back to the user-level problem: if that is the case, then you need to 'hunt the thimble': find the file that's causing the problem. You can remove large swathes of files and folder from the User Library, test, and then restore them if nothing changes, or restore half of them if it does, and so on.\nLikely candidates are user/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist, and com.apple.sidebarlists.plist in the same folder. You may need to look for other potentially relevant filenames.\n\nA: If you can see the DVD on your desktop, you can simply drag the DVD icon back into Finder.\nYou can enable showing DVDs on Desktop in Finder settings:\n\nThen drag and drop your DVD back:\n\n\nA: Someone had created an answer : \"Drag the Audio CD from the Desktop to Finder\".

I've rebooted several times and used different cables.\n\nA: I got it.  \nThe problem was that disk had an EFI System Partition. All the work to make the disk readable for MacOS El Capitan was done on Windows 10.\nC:\\Temp> diskpart\nDISKPART> select disk 1\n---> clean\nDISKPART> exit \nnote:\n(I just noticed that Mac has /usr/sbin/diskutil that I'm sure would have allowed me to deal with the EFI Partition.)\nSo, I used the Windows Disk Utility to create a 1-tb xFAT partition. MacOS recognized that. Then, I reformatted that to MacOS file format, 1-tb partition. perfect.\nAs can be seen in the question, MacOS only recognized that disk in 1 place, in the USB device tree. Only Windows seems to have allowed me to see that EFI System Partition and then allowed me to manipulate the disk.\n", "Q: Is there any macOS snipping app can take picture with lower resolution The native snipping tool in macOS takes an image with the full original pixel.\nwhen I paste it to use, the resolution is a little too big to web blog or in Microsoft-word, I need to resize it smaller by hand every time, is there any other snipping tool that can take a lower resolution image in clipboard?\n\nA: When you capture a screen (or portion of), the app uses the actual size it captured.  If your window, for example is 600x300, that will be the size of the image.\nWhat you will need to do is save the image to a file instead of having it in the clipboard (yes, there are extra steps).  You can manually edit the size of the image In Preview by using the Adjust Size function found under the tools menu.\nI recommend doing it this way, at least for the first set of images so you can find the optimal size to adjust to.  After that, you can use Automator to create an “application” or a “watched folder” that will do this for you.  Below is a sample Automator app that will resize images in a folder to get you started.\n\nYou can scale (resize) the image by percentage or by actual pixels.  You can then drag that image to whatever application you want to use.\n", "Q: Error when importing photos from iCloud to Photos on macOS: \"The operation couldn't be completed.

Probably this video is corrupted somehow in iCloud. All other photos and videos can be imported properly. \nWork around\nImporting all photos and videos before this corrupted video works, and importing all photos and videos after this corrupted video works as well.\n", "Q: Assign ß on MacBook or external Magic Keyboard to long pressing S On Mac OS 10.15.4, when long-pressing keys such as E, O etc., we can chose from a small menu displaying several options for that letter.\nI am searching for a possibility to write the letter ß in the same way.

I'm assuming this USB stick is toast & I'm not going to be doing anything in future with it except for one last short flight into the bin.\nThe stick gives the \"This device is unreadable. Initialise, ignore etc\" when inserted. So I go for Initialise which launches Disk Utility, I Erase GUID/HFS+ & this is as far as it gets. I've watched it now for over 4 hours, no change.\n\nThough I could just pull the device out & bin it right now, this doesn't prevent Disk Utility from just sitting there waiting. I tried this yesterday after about half an hour, then thought I ought to reboot because I had to force-quit Disk Utility & wasn't certain what else may be left in an unstable state.\nI really assumed it would eventually time out, but it seems not.  \nTo avoid having to reboot, do we know what specific process would be waiting indefinitely? Would it be safe to force-quit? Nothing shows as not responding in Activity Monitor, and Disk Utility doesn't appear to have any child processes, when viewed hierarchically. Nothing is exceptionally busy, everything is currently under 10% CPU, barely ticking over. Disk Utility itself is at 0.0%.\nmacOS 10.14.6 on a Mac Pro 5,1. Stick tested on USB hub & directly in the Mac, same result. Only this stick is affected.\n\nA: It is failing to write the partition map on the flash-drive (step before formatting the filesystem) in order to do anything with it, so should be in a safe place to force-quit disk utility.\nFWIW, it might be worth trying another file-system before you bin it.\n", "Q: Would a powered USB hub solve the problem of two external disks randomly losing connection or being slow? I have an older MacBook (circa 2012) and I have two external drives. I want to merge the content of the two drives but Finder is having fits with it. It will lose the connection to the drives at random times and otherwise do transfers very, very slowly (like an entire day for a modest amount like 500MB)\nThe external drives are not powered and I only have one USB port on my MacBook. The USB hub is nothing special, rather basic really, but everything I'm using (including the cables) claims to be USB 3. I am starting to wonder if the hub is the weak point in my process and perhaps I need something else. \nWould a hub that has its own power help in this scenario? I guess I've never really understood the differences between a powered hub and one that is not. \n\nA: Yes.  A powered hub would definitely help.\nThe USB port on your MacBook Pro puts out 5V @ 500mA.  Now, remember, every device you hook up to that port will require some amount of power, including the hub.  \nExternal hard drives use about 2 to 2.5W of power.  Using the formula below to get calculate Amps,\nWatts = Volts x Amps\n\nWe can see that an external drive uses from 400mA to 500mA.  You’ve got two drives plus a hub so, it’s easy to see how you could quickly oversubscribe the power available.\nA bus powered hub (what you have) gets its power from the host, in this case, your Mac.  A powered hub, in comparison, supplements additional power, sometimes up to 3A (depends on the hub) so you can drive more devices without oversubscribing the bus power.\n\nA: I happen to also have a Macbook Pro, Mid 2012. In a powered USB-hub, I have the following:\n(1) new 2-tb Western Digital formatted MacOS (no external power)\n(2) 4 year old, 500-gb Toshiba formatted xFAT (no external power)\n(3) 124-gb, thumb drive formatted xFAT\n(4) 512-gb, thumb drive formatted MacOS\n(5) Diamond BVU3500 HDMI Graphics Adapter\n(6) Diamond BVU3500 HDMI Graphics Adapter\n(7) empty\n(fast charging port 1) iPhone\n(fast charging port 2) iPad  \nMy USB hub = HooToo HT-UH010 7-port USB 3.0 with 2 fast charging ports\nJust like my MacBook, that hub is 8 years old. I see it on newegg, but not Amazon. That hub is a powerhouse and well worth the money.\n", "Q: What sorts of apps should I grant Keychain access to? Some apps ask me for Keychain access when installing them, configuring them, and/or using them. As with anything related to computer access, permissions and security, giving the app access could be a great convenience to me or a security hole. Unfortunately, I don't know enough about the process to give informed consent. I don't want to grant an application more permission/access than it absolutely needs. \nAssuming that I'm installing software that is not overtly suspicious, how can I evaluate whether or not I should grant an application's request to access Keychain? \n\nA: First off - I strongly prefer apps that securely store secrets, therefore it's almost always a sign of quality that an App even knows what the keychain is. Rarely is it a sign they are there to loot your passwords, but if you grant unlimited access, that can happen. It's commendable to use proper coding practices, so spending time to learn specifics of Keychain Access is your next challenge:\n\n\n*\n\n*What sort of app requests keychain access? \n\n*Have you audited that they only store their secrets there and don't access other items?\n\n\nWorst case, just say no. Then see what breaks in the app or work out the specifics of how it stores items and ensure you can use Keychain Access to see that the app is only accessing items it should in the granular permissions settings.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/MCHLF375F392/10.15/mac/10.15.4\nThe help guides on macOS are very good for learning how to get to the basics.\n", "Q: how to get repeating letters on 2019 16\" MacBook Pro keyboard so, as part of maybe, From which year do MacBook keyboards have no issues?\nI have tried different settings w/ apple cs the other day to try and get the I, K and L to duplicate as happens to me sometimes.  Of course they didnt.  However, neither of us could get any letter to repeat when pressing and continuing to hold a key.  I could not see a setting in preferences and the rep couldnt figure out how either.  Can anyone tell me how to get repeating letters by pressing and holding a key?  When I do it in this screen nothing happens.  In pages if I press and hold the e lets say, a tiny window with a  capital \"E\" opens and closes and while continuing to hold the key, the letter does not repeat.\nTks\n\nA: Since 2011 default behavior in Mac OS has been for letter keys to not repeat when held down. Instead the Character Picker or Accent Menu appears where appropriate. Nothing to do with the link you mention.  To get repeating keys, try opening Terminal and typing\ndefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false\n\nand then restart.\nIn Pages if you press and hold e, you should get what is shown below if your OS is working properly.\n\n\nA: If by chance your install does allow key repeat (and presumably has no Accent Menus on Press and Hold), you can go to System Preferences/Keyboard. Make sure you are on the Keyboard tab at the top. On this panel, you can set the time between keys repeating or you can turn it off completely.

I don't want all the bels and whistles. I'm just looking for a command line PGP utility.\nEdit: Revised question with Terminal input and output.\n\nA: The issue command not found occurs because the script ./configure is not executable. I fixed it by setting the executable bit for the user with chmod.\nWhile in the root directory, type the command in Terminal:\nchmod u+x configure\n\n", "Q: MacOS does not isolate the apps in the secondary monitor through each Desktop I work with MacOS - El Capitan\nFurthermore I have Windows 10 and Ubuntu Desktop working with multi desktops. I know how create a new one and how move through them\nAn important observation is that for each laptop is that each one has a secondary monitor. I am able to open any application (editor, window explorer or finder, terminal console, an IDE - etc) and move it to the secondary monitor. Therefore some applications are in the primary monitor and others in the secondary monitor.\nThe point here is, for each Desktop, I am able to have in the primary and secondary monitors any application. If I pass through these Desktops each Desktop respects and keeps isolated the same set of applications opened and distributed through the primary and secondary monitors from the beginning. Again it for each Desktop.\nProblem: all the content (app) opened in the secondary monitor is shared through all the workspaces, therefore the apps are not isolated through each workspace.\nHow to fix this?\n\nA: Fixed in comments.. but to provide an answer for future searchers…\nTwo things to check…\nSystem Prefs > Mission Control > Displays have separate Spaces [should be off]\nThen right click any one of your aberrant apps in the Dock > Options > make sure it's not set to All Desktops. \nEither or both of those settings could be responsible.\n", "Q: AirPlay turns my secondary monitor into a mirroring device I just replaced a BenQ monitor by an LG Ultrawide one as a secondary device to my 2017 Macbook Pro. When using AirPlay to my Apple TV (AirPlaying the Macbook screen), I used to be able to keep using my secondary monitor as if nothing was happening.\nHowever, since I changed my secondary screen, turning on AirPlay automatically turns on this secondary screen into mirroring mode (with a terrible stretch due to the aspect ratio differences).\nAny idea how to fix that?\n\nA: I solved the problem by clicking on Use as Separate Display and going back to Mirroring Retina Display.

I am trying to do a few things with iMovie, and unable to figure it out.\n\n\n*\n\n*I marked different places in the video with a \"Marker\". Is there a way for me to select anything between two specific markers?\n\n*I am trying to move to a specific point in the movie. This turns out to be difficult with the mouse! It keeps jumping within 20 seconds of where I want to put the marker, or go to. Is there a way to go to a precise place in the movie?\n\n*Is there a way to add a fade-in/fade-out between clips (not for the whole movie as in Settings on the right upper corner of the clips)?\n\nA: For me, iMovies' user interface is largely inscrutable. Perhaps that's because it caters to a video editor's workflow - something that's largely foreign to me. Anyway, this won't be a detailed answer, but hopefully enough to inch you forward. \n\n\n*\n\n*The main thing I've noticed with markers is that they are like magnets: when the pointer is close by, it seems to \"snap\" to the marker. The only real use I've ever found for them is that they can be inserted during video playback (M). This is useful if you're looking for a place to cut a video, or make a splice to insert something. Here's another take on it.\n\n*Try using the \"Precision Editor\" (in the iMovie menu bar: Window->Show Precision Editor while a clip is selected in the editing panel. It may also help to \"zoom in\" (make the clip longer) using the slider in the upper right-hand corner of the editing area). Cf\n\n*Yes. The way I use this is as follows: \n\n\n*\n\n*Split the clip (iMovie->Modify->Split Clip) at your chosen point.\n\n*drag one of the Transitions from the palette to the edit area in between the segments of the split clip\n\n*adjust the length/time of the transition with a double-click on the transition in the edit area \n\n\n\nThe picture shows the sequence, but you may have to view it full size to see the details.\n\nAgain - I'm no expert; you'll learn more, and quicker, by searching for help on the Internet. And keep looking! Some of the most useful features in iMovie are well-hidden: I think the \"Ken Burns Effect\" may be the best of these hidden features.\n", "Q: \"df -h\" is showing about 1/2 \"Available\" disk that the \"Disk Utility\" shows for same internal SSD. Which is correct? In mid-2012, I purchased a MacBook Pro, and replaced the internal HDD with a 256-GB Samsung SSD. I am starting a new project. Making sure I have enough disk space, I get conflicting results for the Available space in /dev/disk1:\n\n\nI am using MacOS 10.11.6. (El Capitan) I have emptied the Trash and rebooted. There is a Trim Enabler utility for SSD that I installed, but never got working correctly.\nI am ok with 120GB available, but not ok with just 53GB. Which one is correct?\n\nA: They’re both correct in that they are measuring two completely different things.\nDisk Utility is measuring the volumes on the disk itself whereas df is measuring the file system.  To draw an analogy, one is calculating the surface area of the dining table and the other is measuring the surface area of the plates.\nSo, the important bits here are the available space.  Disk Utility is telling you that the disk itself has 120GB of available space.  df is telling you that on this particular partition/volume you only gave 53GB available.  \nSo, the space isn’t missing, its just not allocated by the filesystem.  How do you claim it?

I remember it used to be possible to download the full iCloud backup. However, after trying a bunch of tools (Dr Fone, syncios, easeUS, iPhone backup extractor) online that claims to download iCloud backup, none of them actually works. Is there any way to do this currently?\n\nA: Yes what you ask is generally and technically possible and also requires some skill and/or funding to perform.\nIf you intend to access your account, I’d read over the Apple terms and conditions carefully. The US license has language that prohibits anyone from accessing the service (which has the data) through automated means including scripts.\nThen decide if you need a lawyer to make sure you are not in violation of the terms before you access your data with a tool or script like the commercially available tools like Elcomsoft phone breaker suite.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.elcomsoft.com/eppb.html\nI would instead use Apple’s iOS and hardware to download your full backup unless you’re sure you need other means and have evaluated the legality and risk to access the data in a way that’s potentially not licensed.\nThe terms also explain what a “full backup” is and is not - so you might need to use a backup method other than iTunes based on what full means to you.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207428\n\n*https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/en/terms.html\n\nThe following content is not included in your iCloud backup: content purchased from the iTunes Store, App Store, or Apple Books, media synced from your computer, and your photo library if you have enabled iCloud Photo Library\n\n\nA: It's probably important to note that using any method that doesn't require you signing in won't work as iCloud backups are encrypted and you’d need to be logged in to access them.\nI'd be hesitant even trying third-party tools as they don't use Apple's official login process, making it unclear how they manage your credentials and if they keep them safe.\nRegardless, the only offical way to download an iCloud backup is by (restoring it to a device, if required, and then) backing it up to a computer using iTunes where the backup file can then be stored elsewhere.\n", "Q: How to connect external display to MacBook Pro without a cable?

It’s connected to an airport time capsule with two ethernet cables going to different floors in the house. At the end of the first ethernet cable there was an old airport express and at the second an airport extreme.\nFiber —> edge router lite —> AirPort Time Capsule (802.11ac) \n(eth0) —> AirPort Extreme (802.11n)\n(eth1) —> AirPort Express (802.11g)\n\nStep 1:\nI replaced the AirPort Extreme (802.11n) with a newer AirPort Extreme (802.11ac) and removed the airport express. This worked well. I installed the new extreme by resting it and using my iPhone to basically taping next, next, next in the setup process. It’s in bridge mode and creates a new network with the same name (I have automatic on both 2,4 and 5 ghz). I ran this setup for about a week and had no issues except sometimes I had a weaker wifi signal at the spots were the express was located before.\nFiber —> edge router lite —> AirPort Time Capsule (802.11ac) \n(eth0) —> AirPort Extreme (802.11ac)\n(eth1) —> nothing\n\nStep 2:\nI then added another AirPort Extreme (802.11ac) and my network now looks like this:\nFiber —> edge router lite —> AirPort Time Capsule (802.11ac) \n(eth0) —> AirPort Extreme (802.11ac)\n(eth1) —> AirPort Extreme (802.11ac)\n\nI setup the new airport extreme the same way as the one before using my iPhone. But now several of my devices have both issues with getting a wifi signal and when they claim to be connected to the network apps can’t connect. This is for a wide range of apps like safari and social media apps.\nI have tried a few different things:\n\n*\n\n*I have switched places between the new airports but the error still\nremains\n\n*When unplugging either of the new airports the wifi works great\n\n*I have read the different guides at apple (for example\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202056) and youtube\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYEAO9aurxg)\n\n*I have checked that the channels don’t overlap with something close\nto my house\n\nWhen both airport extremes are on the network my wifi just won’t work reliably. Can anyone help me work this out? Thank you.\n\nA: After spending a lot of time trying to solve this issue with no success, I unplugged everything and went away for summer holiday. Came back a few weeks later and plugged everything back again and now it works.\nYeah, it has worked for over a month.\n\nA: I would start with the easy stuff first:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the ethernet connection plugging into both AirPort Extreme is going into it's WAN port (the one with the circles icon above it) -- on the newest units that's at the very bottom of the Extreme. Note: this is crucial as plugging into any other outlet can cause trouble. For example If either extreme has routing mode enabled and you connect the Ethernet coming from the time capsule into one of the other outlets you will get no connectivity and IP addresses will feed back into the network. If the units are not set up with routing mode, plugging into the other outlets can cause there to be WiFi signal but NO internet.\n\n*Download the Airport Utility application on your iPhone or use a Mac for the next steps. Open the Airport Utility and check your configuration on each Airport Extreme and the Time Capsule. For your setup it should be\nset to:\n\n*Base station tab-- Consider giving each unit a unique name so you can find them and configure them easier during troubleshooting.\n\n*Internet tab-- Connect using DHCP. Consider entering manual DNS numbers such as 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8 for cloudflare and google DNS numbers. Note: This step will help you determine if there are DNS issues from the Edge Router, or circumvent issues if the Time capsule or one of the extremes has routing mode on and is causing trouble.\n\n*Wireless tab-- Create a wireless network. Try using the exact same name and password/security settings. Then try using a different wifi name for each extreme to see if it works better for you and you'll be able to troubleshoot which unit or which ethernet connection is having trouble. Note: when troubleshooting it is important to determine which of the two airports are causing issues, with one WiFi name it is hard to determine. With two you can join one, test to see if things work, then join the other and test to see if things work. This step is crucial in isolating where your issue lies.\n\n*Network tab-- Router mode (Off Bridge Mode) Note: as mentioned earlier, having routing mode on can cause unexpected behavior, so set it to bridge mode so you can know what behavior to expect. You want all your traffic and routing to be determined by your Edge Router.\n\n*If you’ve tried the steps above, then consider the WiFi scanning to change channels and such. It’s crucial to have the basics above done first. Cables running into the proper outlets, settings set as simple and expected as possible (bridge mode), and give yourself the separate WiFi names for testing purposes. Once things are working with the different names, then you can change the WiFi name back to the same name/security/password. Then if the issue returns you can try checking the WiFi channels.\nTip regarding WiFi scanners - sometimes the “free” channel looks open but there is other interference on that channel. I’ve had trouble with channel 1 on occasion - it looks clear with the scanners but the service is slow and troublesome.\nA quick thing you can do is when you’re trying a channel is hold the option key down on your keyboard and click the WiFi icon. You’ll get great info like TX rate. Then you can try channel 6, and channel 11 and see which one works best in your area.\nLast tip is to consider separating out your 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz network while testing. I’ve had a AirPort Extreme that had antenna issues on one of the two and I only determined the hardware defect after splitting out the channels. The computer kept joining the 5Ghz automatically, and even nearby it had terrible service speeds.\nAll these steps boil down to:\nTry the simple stuff first, connections in right spots, settings as simple as possible.\nThen try to isolate where the problem is using different WiFi names, and consider splitting off the 2.4/5Ghz networks.\nThen simplify the network down to how you want it set once you’ve isolated the problem component or channel.\nNote: I do not have the benefit of commenting in order to gather more info and ask basic questions. Each of these steps sounds simple but has a very concrete reason behind checking. Below each suggestion you will see the reasoning to do this.\n\nA: I literally had the same issue.\nEvery time i restored everything, on the second airport i always chose \"Extend this network\" as i thought this would set the router to \"bridge mode\". And had the same issue. One airport consequently was not working (wifi) - the one that was restarted latest, was the one that was always working (so both was working, but only one at the time). I tried different SSID etc. etc. to troubleshoot if this was limited to a certain Airport Extreme.\nWhen I did everything from scratch, I chose \"create a new network\". This option would still set my airport to bridge mode. And my ISP router is handling the DHCP.\nNow I have same SSID on ISP router + my two airport extremes. And everything works perfectly.\n", "Q: Swift Playgrounds on MacOS performs badly, spinning up the fans and working the CPU Using the basic \"Learn to Code 1\" playground results in the MacBooks that I've tested on, including a 2020 MacBook Air, working far harder than I'd expect.

In such a case, it might be better if you also provide screenshot(s) of your data and what you want to eventually achieve (you may just do it manually as an example if necessary). \n", "Q: How to get tmutil compare to show results deeper than root directory When I use tmutil compare, I only get a list of items in the root folder:\n- 10.0K                         /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/.DS_Store\n- 992B                          /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/.OSInstallerMessages\n- 0B                            /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/.PKInstallSandboxManager-SystemSoftware\n- 1.6M                          /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/.TempReceipt.bom\n- 172B                          /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/.abackblaze\n- 521B                          /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/.bzvol\n- 0B                            /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/.file\n- 424B                          /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/.installer-compatibility\n- 0B                            /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/.vol\n- 3.5G                          /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/Library\n- 1.9G                          /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/System\n- 33.6G                         /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/Users\n- 0B                            /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/Volumes\n- 0B                            /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/cores\n- 0B                            /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/mnt\n- 0B                            /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/opt\n- 1.6G                          /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/private\n- 0B                            /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/sw\n- 97.1M                         /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD - Data/usr\n- 500.6M                        /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Recovery\n+ 84.3G                         /System/Volumes/Data\n- 12.1G                         /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Andrew’s MacBook Air/2020-06-02-183525/Macintosh HD\n+ 500.7M                        /Volumes/Recovery\n\nWhen I've seen other posts in this forum and elsewhere, the output from tmutil compare has been a list of files within subdirectories of the root folder.\nIs there something I could do differently?\nEdit:\nTo clarify, this backup's copy of the /Users folder differs from the computer by 33.6G - but I get no info about what makes up that difference.

But is there some way of getting this recursive process to run without having to manually compare folder after folder?\n\nA: This tool is designed to operate on the entire backup set. Rather than try to bend it to your will, may I suggest a tool that does precisely what you seek, does it fast and in the background and can even help you track changed files when your backup drive is not mounted.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.soma-zone.com/BackupLoupe/\nThe loupe tool works best for me when I track deleted files, so once you get a couple of your recent backups scanned, you can explore what’s changing hour by hour or day by day. There’s no need to let it run over dozens of backups for you to get a feeling if it will work well for the question you pose here. Long term, you’ll want to decide if you let it index in the background and keep the indexes always up to date or launch it only when you want deep scans and then let it run to get your analysis up to date.\nDue to the limitations of tmutil compare this tool implements their own scanner since as you point out, the main tool is good to know the entire change load and not focus on specific parts.\n", "Q: Files on my desktop seem to set themselves as hidden files (macOS Catalina), greyed out, even though they don't begin with periods I have a strange and recurring problem on my recently upgraded Mac running macOS Catalina\nFirst of all, Catalina has a new feature where you can Show/hide the hidden files on your machine using Cmd-Shift-Period. Press it once to show the hidden files press it again to hide them. AFAIK, this specific keystroke feature is new in Catalina (prior to Catalina, I always used the hack to set the finder defaults via the terminal to see my hidden files).\nI normally keep my Finder windows showing the hidden files, because I want to see them.\nRecently I noticed that all of  my files on the desktop were greyed out-- like hidden. They were just random files I happened to have left on my desktop.\nAnd what's strange is that they don't begin with a period (.), the way normal hidden files do. They seem to behave as hidden files even though they don't begin with a period.\nIf I press Cmd-Shift-Period, they disappear from view like all of the other hidden files. But unlike the other hidden files, they aren't supposed to be hidden.\n\nIf I press Cmd-Shift-Period again, they appear along with the other hidden files in my finder windows\n\nJust to be clear: these files were NOT hidden yesterday, and I didn't do anything that I know of to cause this. And as noted below, it doesn't happen right away when I put new files on the desktop. I noticed it last week too but now it seems to have done it to even more files that I put on the desktop more recently than when I first noticed it (The same behavior-- Finder seems like it took some visible files and turned them into these invisible files without changing the file names or adding pre-pending periods like you'd expect for invisible files.)\n1) I'm not sure what is causing this. What could be causing these files to appear in this hidden state and to have been normal files and then somehow get morphed into this hidden state?\n2) How can i fix them? I've never seen hidden files like these-- I've only ever seen hidden files that begin with periods (so with this, you can add or remove the period to change its visibility)— if I do \"Get Info\" on these hidden files I can see the normal Get Info window, which has options for many things like \"Hide extension\" but no option to set the file to visibile/hidden.\nWas this a new feature introduced in Catalina?\nWhen I create new files on the desktop, the new files are not hidden and behave normally:\n\n\nA: We resolved it in the comments as following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Give full disk access to Terminal in System Preferences > Privacy & Security.\n\n*Run\ncd ~/Desktop\nchflags -R nohidden ./\nkillall Finder\n\nThe -R flag will unhide recursively everything under the ./ (current directory). \n\n*To hide something back, for example:\nchflags hidden ~/Desktop/project/.git\n\nDon't use -R here since git only keeps the top level folder, .git hidden, rest all inside it is normal.\n", "Q: Airport Time Capsule Third Generation Roaming connection with a Google wifi router I am trying to make a internet configuration to improve my wifi in the whole house, but I don't want to switch between different wifi names, I have a Airport Time Capsule Third Generation, Google wifi Router and a modem, my house is two stories and my basement, where I need internet signal too. \nMy Problem; I have my modem and router in the same room, and I was able to connect an ethernet cable to my Time Capsule, so far so good, but I can make the Time Capsule extend my wifi connection. I read that doing a roaming configuration would be perfect in this case. However, I don't have the whole explanation to do that.\nWhen I connect the Google router and the Time Capsule, my understanding is I have to put in a bridge mode, but if I only do that and switch the wireless setting in the Time Capsule off, then the Network option goes off (bridge mode); too, but at that point the Time Capsule is not doing any internet wifi capabilities, to turn that option I have to go back to the wireless setting and chose the network Mode to Extend a wireless network and leave the name and password as they are, unfortunately if I do that my Time Capsule goes flashing amber, the google wifi goes amber too and the internet goes amber too. \nCould you help me to solve this? \n\nA: Roaming doesn't work perfectly between multiple brands of products, and wireless roaming (which you may have been reading about) definitely doesn't work between the Apple Airport units (Time Capsule included) and any other non-Apple products.\nHowever here is what you would want to do in your situation to make things a little easier.\n1) Make sure the ethernet cable comes from your Google WiFi Router and plugs into the WAN plug of the Time Capsule (that's the one at the very bottom, or on the one side with the little circular icons above the port.\n2) Go into the Airport Utility and configure your Time Capsule settings as such:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wireless tab -- Network Mode: Create a wireless network\n\n*Use the same exact Wireless Network Name as your Google WiFi\n\n*Use the same exact Wireless security settings as your Google WiFi -- typically WPA2 Personal and the exact wifi password.\n\n*Network tab -- Router Mode: Off (Bridge Mode)\nNote: You may need to occasionally turn off and on your WiFi on your device to get it to join the closest wifi connection. As long as your WiFi settings are the same you should not need to re-enter any name or password info when the device tries to reconnect. The only way around this issue is to get another Google WiFi product to extend your network. Mixing brands tends to give finicky behavior for things like roaming between WiFi access points.\n", "Q: How to enable COVID-19 Exposure Logging in India How to enable Privacy => Health => COVID-19 Exposure Logging on a iPhone 6S+ device running 13.5.1 in India. Whatever Region I choose, it seems to be disabled and it mentions that its not enabled for the region.\nWe are developing an App using the Exposure Notification specification but aren't in a position to enable the above attribute\n\nA: Non developers don’t get to enable COVID-19 logging in ares where Apple hasn’t enabled it.\nApple has documented volumes of technical data, reasoning, white papers and more: https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing\nIf that’s not enough to get you going, since you are developing, you do have an avenue that all consumers lack. Open a developer support ticket with Apple using your developer account to get access to a pre-release OS and register any requests that support development of an app before it’s rolled out.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com\nThat’s the best way to move forward on this if you can’t wait for it to be rolled into the production OS for your region or you want to see the beta SDK / API so you know what is coming as opposed to what shipped. Also, look at WWDC dates - since that is less than 20 days away, you might wait quite some time for an answer or have to rely on the developer forums / documentation already written as there’s a lot in the air right now on the development side.\n\nA: The link https://covid19.apple.com/screening/ appears on apple.com when the country (at the page's bottom) is the US.\nMoreover, a lot of content there is US centred. \nIf you switch to https://www.apple.com/in/, the screening strip at the top disappears. So I think it's not supported in India. \nIt will not be hugely successful either since the number of iPhones per unit people is less in India than in the US.

It becomes pretty hot to touch.\nI check Activity Monitor: photoanalysisd is using near 100% CPU.\nWhat is \"photoanalysisd\" and why is it using 77% of my CPU? says that it's due to changes in Photos.app... I have never used Photos.app. None of the answers on that question help me.\nI just Force Quit photoanalysisd now whenever this happens, and haven't noticed any problems.\nBut it's frustrating when this happens.\nHow do I stop photoanalysisd from hogging CPU?\nI'm running macOS Catalina 10.15.4\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to AppleID > iCloud and disable Photos. \n\n*Go run Photos app and verify there are no libraries, delete all images or delete the library so when you relaunch Photos is asks to create a library. \n\n*Repeat these steps for every user on your Mac in Accounts\n\n*Restart the Mac. \n\n\nAt that point you might need look into logs to see what’s triggering the daemon to do work or run a sysdiagnose on the process. Also, Photos can have many libraries, so you might need to switch libraries to locate the system library or other ones. Photo analysis can run on any library - not just the one you expect when you launch the app.\n\nA: Check console for photoanalysisd. I suspect it’s restarting over and over. Mine is.\n", "Q: Change default app for all files in a folder I know you can change the default app for single files on Mac simply by going in \"Get Info\". But, it's a bit inconvenient if I want to change the default application to open all files for only a single folder. Is there an application that can select a bunch of files and change the default apps to open them with the help of a single click?\n\nA: This is not how it works.  \nA file type (i.e. PDF) is registered with the system through a process called “LaunchServices.”  It’s what associates a file with what opens it.  It can even have multiple entries to do things like “Open with Preview” and “Edit with TextEdit” for example.  It can’t, however, dynamically change based on a folder because folders aren’t registered with LaunchServices.\nLooking at this pragmatically, how would the system know which folders to monitor for application associations of its contents?  Folders are created and deleted all the time - it wouldn’t be efficient to manage those relationships.\n\nA: There can be only one 'default' for the whole system. However, you can of course set one or more files to associate with another app from the default.\nIn the Finder, you can select multiple files of the same type within a folder, then press Command Option I, which brings up one \"Get Info\" dialog for all the files. \n\n(In fact, they don't even have to be the same file type, as long as one app can open all of the types.)  You can then change the app that opens those files on a double-click. \nObviously, any files added subsequently would need to be changed manually after the fact.\nYou could create a Folder Action to modify the opening app for any file dropped into a given folder.\n", "Q: macOS 10.15.5 screwed up Sound Output device I've noticed it only as soon as yesterday, so I'm going to pin it on the latest macOS release, i.e. 10.15.5.\nThe sound output is unreliable in the latest update. I have three output devices in my setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Internal Speakers;\n\n*Speakers on the secondary monitor; and\n\n*Plugged-in headphones.\n\n\nYesterday I saw that both my headphones as well as internal speakers were engaged simultaneously. Meaning, I was listening to music on the headphones and some alarm sounds (like the sound that plays when you have hit the end of current line in Terminal etc.) would come through internal speakers.\nToday I noticed that the audio from a monitor is coming from the secondary monitor's speakers while message notification sound came off the internal speakers.\n\nIs anyone else seeing something similar?\nIs this something that would be / need to be fixed or has Apple had some better understanding of sounds output and decided to engage multiple outputs at the same time?\n\nA: This has been a feature of Mac OS X as far back as I can remember.\nYou can set the system alert sound device separately from the device the main audio output (for \"regular audio\", such as music, audio track of movies, non-system-alert-api application sound) uses.\n\n(source: kumowoon1025.com)\n\n(source: kumowoon1025.com)\nIt might be you only noticed this now because maybe your internal speakers weren't functional before the update, and you didn't notice because you didn't use them too often? But that's just a wild guess.\nMight be relevant: the release notes for macOS Catalina 10.15.5 mentions:\n\nAddresses an issue for Mac computers with the Apple T2 Security Chip\nwhere internal speakers may not appear as a sound output device in\nSound preferences\n\nI think you might have been having the above mentioned issue, and the internal speakers weren't available as an output device,\n", "Q: PM2 startup on macOS Catalina I'm trying to set pm2 to auto start on Mac OS like this pm2 startup\nHowever I keep getting this error: \nenv: Fusion.app/Contents/Public:/usr/local/bin: No such file or directory\nI tried the suggestion from this page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26664282/how-to-use-pm2-startup-command-on-mac But the even using this command I keep getting the same error: pm2 startup darwin\nHow can I get pm2 to startup automatically on Mac OS Catalina?\nThanks!\n\nA: What's probably happening is that pm2 isn't generating the correct script because your PATH variable contains spaces (most likely \"VMWare Fusion\" in your case).\nRun echo $PATH, clean it up by escaping the space character using a backslash (\\), then manually paste the resulting PATH variable in pm2's generated startup script.\nSo basically instead of running a generated pm2 script like this:\nsudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin /usr/local/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup launchd -u <user> --hp <user_folder>\n\nrun something like this:\nsudo env PATH=<your `echo $PATH` output with escaped spaces>:/usr/local/bin /usr/local/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup launchd -u <user> --hp <user_folder>\n\n", "Q: Usefulness of the Apple Watch Series 5 to a Cyclist: does it have electric sensors instead of, or in addition to, optical heart-rate sensors? Update: Motivation for the question\nThe motivation for the present question is to determine whether it is possible for a cyclist 1- to measure the heart rate without touching the crown, which would require holding the handlebar with just one hand for a few seconds, 2- to connect the Series 5 to a head unit—thus avoiding to look at the watch at all, and only glancing at the head unit, as well as 3- curiosity about how the Series 5 can measure the heart rate through electric sensors, given the understanding that there must be two electric sensors, quite far apart.\nEnd Update\nCyclists and runners may want to keep track of their fitness level by confirming that their heart-rate remained below a certain threshold for a given activity. For that use case it's helpful to monitor the heart rate after a workout. But they may also want to ensure during a workout that they cross a heart rate threshold and remain there for some time.\nA heart rate sensor that attaches through a chest band is a reliable solution, but it's far from being an unobtrusive one.\nA good alternative, one that's much easier to tolerate, may be a wrist watch such as the Apple Watch Series 5.\nDoes the Apple Watch Series 5 have electric sensors instead of, or in addition to, optical heart-rate sensors?\nThe reason it matters is that electric sensors require the cyclist or the runner to stop and touch the crown with a finger from the alternate hand. (This produces an ECG, not just a heart rate, but the latter can obviously be derived from the former.) For continuous monitoring, IIUC, an optical sensor is still required.\n\nA: I get far better readings from my watch during running and cycling than I did with either Garmin or Wahoo chest sensors. However, since 2017 I’ve not even tried a chest sensor, so perhaps they have improved faster than the Apple Watch sensor has. \nThe watch is less likely to slip for me with the Velcro band than the elastomer band, but even the elastomer band is more accurate than I need for 6 hour cycling workouts on bumpy gravel roads in windy conditions. It also does more - so I’d rather skip the chest band entirely for convenience and comfort. I did love the chest bands since the early 90’s due to them being the best I could get for exercise data collection. \nAll three vendors I list are superlative in my experience, as is Suunto, if you need excellent data on your heart rate while exercising. The watch sensors are more than adequate for me so I wanted to chime in with my experience. \n", "Q: Capture month end values in Apple Numbers Is there a way to capture a cell value at a specified time in Numbers. For example if you have a stock portfolio and wish to capture month end values can this be done?\n\nA: I am sorry that I don't know how to do what you are specifically asking for but I reckon it is not a trivial thing to do. In case you can't figure it out, I think either of the two below might be an alternative for you. \nYou can use the stock() function in Numbers to calculate the value of a stock portfolio with the latest closing prices. You can open this file within the first day of every month and it would give you the value of the portfolio at the closing prices of the last day of trading of the previous month assuming you will also be connected to the internet when you open the file. \nYou can then either record the value of the portfolio somewhere else such as another table in Numbers or save the table calculating the value of the portfolio to another file or sheet in Numbers as a whole by copying it first and then pasting it using Paste Formula Results menu option under Numbers' Edit menu at the top. The drawback of this option is that if you open the file calculating the value of the portfolio at a later date than the first of the month, it is likely to calculate the value of the portfolio for a date later than the end of the previous month.\nAlternatively, you can use the stockh() function to calculate the value of a stock portfolio for any past date. You would of course need to know the exact number of shares per stock in the portfolio at the given past date for this to work.\n\nA: You can use the EOMONTH function to get the date of the last day of the month which is offset by input value. The string of functions EOMONTH(NOW(),-1) gives the date of the last day of the month for the month before now. You can use this new date to find the value you want.\nFor the end of this month, the day this answer was posted June 2020, you'd use: EOMONTH(NOW(),0)\n\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 17\" mid 2010 + NEC upd720202 Express Card USB 3.0 I have a MacBookPro6,1 running well and stable on MacOS 10.9.5,\nI use it for video image editing, so I have a lot of data on external drives.\nRecently found out that I can speed up all transferings via ExpressCard, \nso I purchased one with NEC upd720202 chipset (the only one available here) but it doesn't work correctly.

The 2011 models have Thunderbolt and the info is accurate below. The 2012 models have USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt, so the adapter is irrelevant\nI'm not a big fan of adapters used to try and improve speed as they tend to not work as well as you expect.\nI hunted around for a product that might help and the best option I could find was to get you Thunderbolt to USB 3.0 via the Kanex Thunderbolt to eSATA plus USB 3.0 Adapter.\nKanex makes a bunch of stuff for Macs and their stuff is hit or miss. At least they offer support for their products so if it doesn't work you can return it or talk with someone who makes the product.\nIf you have Amazon, you can find the adapter there, or you can get it straight from Kanex directly. It's a bit pricy though at around $75-$100 USD so it might make more sense to get yourself a thunderbolt drive or put the money towards a newer system at this point.\nHere's the Kanex link for the product: Thunderbolt to eSata + USB 3.0 Adapter\nNote: Sonnet used to make a ExpressCard to USB adapter that would have worked, but they no longer sell the product or support it. I would advise skipping the ExpressCard slot on your Mac altogether for this issue.\n", "Q: Can I purchase an App from the Mac App Store for multiple users? How do I make a bulk purchase of an app on the Mac App Store? I know there are 2 options for bulk purchasing: Apple Business Manager Account and Apple School Manager Account but what if I do not have these accounts. \nIs there a way?\n\nA: If you don't want or have ABM or ASM then the only way to make a bulk purchase is to work out something with the app developer.  \nThis kind of purchase would be outside the Mac App Store and could involve some difficulty with installation and support.\nOutside of these methods, there no supported (by Apple or, probably, the developer) to purchase multiple licenses or software copies.\n", "Q: Shift scroll doesn't horizontally scroll with any external mouse I used to use Shift+scroll to scroll horizontally in the past.

I tried this in Safari as well as some other apps. \nI did some quick research, and it seems as shift-scrolling should scroll horizontally, as seen here, here, and here. \nCould this possibly have been a removed feature in Catalina? If so, what are my options for getting it back? \n\nA: The issue was that I was using Mos to enable smooth scrolling on my Mac.\nHowever, it removes the ability to scroll horizontally using the shift key by default. To reenable this behavior, go to Mos Settings > Advanced and then select \"Shift\" as the horizontal scrolling key. That should do it!\n", "Q: macOS Catalina 10.15.4 - MacBook Pro Retina, mid 2015 - dual screen bug Since updating to Catalina two months ago I have had this problem: My MacBook Pro HDMI output is attached to a NEC monitor.

There is no way to turn off mirroring or select the second screen-it doesn't show in system preferences, which only detects the MBP retina screen.\n\n****About this Mac****\n  Chipset Model:    Intel Iris Pro\n  Type: GPU\n  Bus:  Built-In\n  VRAM (Dynamic, Max):  1536 MB\n  Vendor:   Intel\n  Device ID:    0x0d26\n  Revision ID:  0x0008\n  Metal:    Supported, feature set macOS GPUFamily1 v4\n  Displays:\nColor LCD:\n  Display Type: Built-In Retina LCD\n  Resolution:   2880 x 1800 Retina\n  Framebuffer Depth:    24-Bit Color (ARGB8888)\n  Mirror:   Off\n  Online:   Yes\n  Automatically Adjust Brightness:  No\n  Connection Type:  Internal\n**P221W:NEC Monitor ---**\n  Resolution:   1680 x 1050 (Widescreen Super eXtended Graphics Array Plus)\n  UI Looks like:    1680 x 1050 @ 60 Hz\n  Framebuffer Depth:    24-Bit Color (ARGB8888)\n  Display Serial Number:    07104621NA  \n  Main Display: Yes\n  Mirror:   Off\n  Online:   Yes\n  Rotation: Supported\n  Automatically Adjust Brightness:  No\n\nThe problem didn't exist before the Catalina upgrade.\n\nA: Besides trying the normal stuff like Resetting NVRAM and SMC, you might want to double check your Energy Saver settings and make sure \"Automatic graphics switching\" is enabled.\nIf you still have trouble, check under the About This Mac--> System Report--> Graphics/Displays. Then take a picture of that and send it over. I'm curious if your MacBook Pro is having trouble with the AMD Radeon card or the drivers that support it.\n\nA: I don’t recommend HDMI for any sort of compute type of environment.  It’s a consumer electronics video technology and very flaky (IMO).    My recommendation for connecting your monitor to your MacBook is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*DisplayPort to DVI (Active Adapter)\n\n*HDMI to DVI (Active Adapter)\n\n\nThe reason I recommend active adapters is because DVI and even the analog VGA signals have very different signaling from HDMI.  Most of the time, the issue is a missing clock sync.  The passive adapters can’t recreate this signal where the active ones can.\nMany times, you’ll see the same setup in Windows (even on Bootcamp!) work without a problem.  Windows drivers have a wider “tolerance” for these idiosyncrasies where as Apple doesn’t.  The active adapters fix that problem.\n", "Q: Can't increase my disk size \nI can't modify the \"BOOTCAMP\" disk to be larger or remove it completely, an error message will occur when attempting to do that.

Why isn't this video playing with sound on Youtube on my Macbook Pro?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e1ld1uGpXA\nYa'll are downvoting this post for no reason. \nThe sound on that SPECIFIC video does not work. All other videos seem to have sound, just not that one. I have tried opening this video in all browsers on my Macbook Pro (mid 2014), but it doesn't work on any of my browsers. The browsers I have are Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and FireFox. I tried opening that video in Incognito mode/private browsing and it still doesn't have sound. \nHere's a video I recorded and uploaded to Youtube showing my issue: \nhttps://youtu.be/tdjaezqizgU\n\nA: That's an interesting question! There's a pretty simple answer - there's only sound recorded onto the left channel.\nYou should first check your sound output settings and see if you have the balance set to the center. Go to System Preferences--> Sound--> Output tab. Then check your balance.\nYou can play around with dragging left or right and anyone can recreate the issue by dragging the Balance all the way to the \"right\" when playing that video.\nIf you have your sound output in the center on the Balance, then you should try playback of your audio through your internal speakers instead of through the HDMI connection to your display (or other sound output).\nThat way you can isolate if the problem with your Display itself or in its settings.\nIf you find the problem only happens on your external display, see if you can adjust the sound settings on it and see if there's different audio selections.\n\nA: Like some who have commented, I also can hear the audio track that accompanies the video.

I was using OneNote for Mac, and created 30+ folders and content.  I have an iMac with Time Machine backup.  I took my iMac to a computer shop and got an upgrade to my hard drive.  When the computer was returned, all of the programs worked, with the exception of OneNote, the One Note App icon bounced up and down and did not open.  \nI spoke to a technician who  said folders should be in the OneDrive cloud, but after checking the OneNote cloud, none of these folders where there.  The technician recommended I remove OneNote for Mac, and re-install.  I did, and OneNote worked, but none of my previously created folders appeared.  \nNext I tried to go into the Time Machine, back in time, and see the ~/Library/Containers/com.microsfot.onenote.mac files from different dates.  I copied a version and tried to replace the currently working com.microsoft.onenote.mac file with the version from TimeMachine, but when I did this and re-ran OneNote, the OneNote for Mac App icon returned to bouncing up and down, and had to be force quit, removed, then reinstalled.\nHas anyone had this problem with OneNote for Mac and been able to successfully recover and recreate their folder structure and content?

Enter Time Machine and select the backup that's closest to the time you lost the data. In that backup select the folder you want to restore and click on the restore button.\nIf you still can't find this folder or the files you can use a data recovery app to recover deleted files.

I have a 2014 Macbook Pro, and sometimes I plug in a USB Flash drive (the tiny ones) or microSDXC flash drive (microSDXC together with a USB adapter).\nBut even if I don't use the drive at all, just letting it idle, when it is plugged in for an hour or two, I touched it, and it could be 40-45°C (104-113°F).\nIf it is actively used, like if I copy files onto it once in a while for an hour, it could be up to 60-70°C (140-158°F).  Is that normal? It is high temperature enough to cook an egg.  Is the USB output from the Macbook Pro stronger than usual that make the USB drive hot?\n(To make sure I don't have fake products I even ordered the USB flash drive and the microSDXC and USB adapter directly from SanDisk, so they should be authentic.)\nP.S. I also tried and used a microSD adapter and used it on the Macbook Pro, and it was much cooler, so certainly we can use the microSD port, but what if a user wants to use the microSD port and the USB port at the same time for more storage? What if the user want a low profile USB flash drive as storage?\n\nA: This is not an Apple issue because it’s the USB device itself (the microSD card) that’s getting hot, not the MacBook.\nA device gets hot because electrons are flowing across the conductive surfaces causing friction.  Those electrons are flowing because it’s in use.  \nWhy does the USB-C Ethernet adapter get hot, even when unplugged from ethernet?\n“In use” doesn’t mean when you are copying files to/from it.  As long as it is being recognized by the system, it’s in use.  To be candid, I am surprised to see temperature readings with such specifically and only a ~10% variance at idle and an even tighter variance at higher temperatures all measured by “touch.”\n\nIs the USB output from the Macbook Pro stronger than usual that make the USB drive hot?\n\nUnless the power is negotiated using the new Power Delivery specification, which it isn’t because an SD card is not a “power” device to be recharged like an iPhone, its receiving 5V at the current “requested9 (probably 100mA or less) because it’s attached to the USB bus.\nOne thing to remember is that a source (MacBook, charger, power supply, etc.) doesn’t push power.  The device draws power.\nFinally, just grabbing a random specification sheet (Transcend) for a SDXC card, the operating environment is -25C to 85C (-13F to 185F) , so you are well within its temperature ranges.\n", "Q: Trying to Analyse a WIFI Hardware Problem I have a MacBook Pro (13 \", Mid 2012) model running Mac OS 10.14.6 (Mojave).

When u do a cold boot it just shows a cross at the WIFI symbol's place and indicates no hardware. Before the cold boot, the WIFI symbol looks blank as if the WIFI is turned off when it isn't it. And you can't turn it on either.\nFurther Edits : So I'm speaking in terms of frequency here. SMC reset has both failed and worked almost 50% of the times. NVRAM reset has also failed at times but it has been the most successful. (I might be biased towards NVRAM one compared to the SMC, because it showed most promise)\nAlso I think I can almost assign an \"external\" causality to the WIFI status turned off state. Whenever, the laptop get into a sudden movement\nit just turns the WIFI hardware off in some sense. I do not know enough hardware to back up this comment of mine, but I think the WIFI must have an antenna of sorts, which gets disturbed whenever a \"jerk\" motion occurs to the laptop externally to switch off the WIFI.\nMy Macbook habits : I keep opening a lot of tabs on my safari and a lot of pdfs on my Preview. I mostly keep my pro in sleep state. Rarely do I shut down! And sometimes I code. I shifted to Mojave from the prior operating system, where the problem actually initiated, thinking a software update would fix things permanently.\n\nWhat I would like help on is understanding the functioning on the NVRAM:\nwhy does the NVRAM resetting fix the WIFI?\nWhat makes the WIFI hardware go bust again?\nIs it a hardware problem,\nas in my macbook is too old and needs a wifi hardware repair? If so,\nthen why does resetting NVRAM temporarily fix things?\n\nI'd like some understanding to this situation I am stuck in!\nEDIT on the suggestion that NVRAM is exactly the source of the problem.\nBefore the WIFI status goes into its off state\n\nnvram -p\nbacklight-level    %14%01\nLocationServicesEnabled    %01\nfmm-computer-name  MacBook Pro\nSystemAudioVolumeDB    <\nSystemAudioVolume  %df\nbluetoothInternalControllerInfo    %1d%82%ac%05%00%13%18%1d|%d1%c3%8ai?\n\nWhen the WIFI is in its off state :\n\nnvram -p\nbacklight-level    %04%01\nLocationServicesEnabled    %01\nSystemAudioVolumeDB    %f2\nSystemAudioVolume  V\nbluetoothInternalControllerInfo    %1d%82%ac%05%00%13%18%1d|%d1%c3%8ai?\n\n\nA: This is key and  you want to start, if you haven’t already, making detailed observations to assist in this diagnosis:\n\nWhenever, the laptop get into a sudden movement it just turns the WIFI hardware off in some sense. I do not know enough hardware to back up this comment of mine, but I think the WIFI must have an antenna of sorts, which gets disturbed whenever a \"jerk\" motion occurs to the laptop externally to switch off the WIFI.\n\nYou are correct, there is an antenna that physically connects to wireless module (AirPort module).  The thing is, that module itself is physically connected to the logic board via a slot connector and not soldered.  These could be loose if in fact a quick motion causes things to disconnect.  \nSee Macbook Pro WiFi hardware sporadically malfunctioning\nIf you have the technical skills (it’s pretty easy, actually), I would reseat these connections and even clean the connection surfaces, making sure they were nice and shiny.\niFixit has an excellent walkthrough\nAs far as resetting the NVRAM, there’s nothing in there that that “fixes hardware.”  Likely, it’s the associated reboot that (temporarily) fixes things because of the inherent reset of everything.\n\nA: This blog gives an account of the information contained in NVRAM:\nhttps://eclecticlight.co/2018/08/24/whats-stored-in-nvram/\nIt also gives the Terminal command nvram -xp to list the contents of the NVRAM, which might be useful. Note that the data is in base64 encoding, which will need further decoding to become 'human-readable'.\nHowever, there does not seem to be anything specific to WIFI or networking generally. I note that Internet Recovery Partition, which is in Firmware, can remember Wifi router selection and passwords.\nGiven the age of the machine, an intermittent failure of this sort is likely to be a hardware problem. You could try ruling out software issues by booting to a new, clean OS on an external disk. \nAs to why NVRAM reset fixes it: that's unknown.  If the contents of NVRAM are unchanged when the WiFi is defective and when it works, then it's not the reset as such that's fixing it. It's possible that the reset does something else coincidentally.\n\nA: You could use an app like Wi-fi Explorer ($20) or wi-explorer lite (free) to monitor the signal strength of all wi-fi networks your computer sees. Wi-Fi Explorer gives you information about your wi-fi network. You have a 3-day trial period on Wi-Fi Explorer if you get it from the link included here.\n", "Q: How to reset Mac Catalina password!

If after a clean install everything is great but you subsequently restore from Time Machine, you may have a corrupted backup from the failing drive.  \nInstead of a restore, try doing a data migration Using Migration Assistant instead.

Dell, HP, Asus and pretty much every manufacturer uses some variant of this chip/adapter.  That means this adapter is not very expensive.\nHowever, since the iMac computers from 2012 on have the screen glued in place, the labor could be costly to change the part.  If this is the case, upgrade your hard disk to an SSD while it’s open.\n\nA: Did you just get an update? Security update just came out for 10.15; did the same happen for 10.13?

I attach an external keyboard to my MacBook Pro 13 inch 2020 running Catalina 10.15.5 using an Apple dongle. After a while, (this could be 10 minutes or an hour or so) keystrokes are not registered anymore. The keyboard still lights up so there is power going to it.\nI don't know if it is relevant, but the only things attached to the MBP are power and an HDMI cable (plugged into the same dongle as the USB keyboard).\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attach external keyboard (although the same happens with a usb mouse and usb microphone)\n\n*Use the keyboard for about 10 minutes to an hour \n\n*Notice that keystrokes are not registered\n\n\nHow to solve temporarily: A full reboot (so no sleep)\nSteps I tried to fix without reboot:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset SMC\n\n*Reset NVRAM (I have tried these since every apple support page I saw mentioned them).\n\n*Made sure the keyboard still works on other devices\n\n*Tried another non-Apple dongle on another port\n\n*Tried the same Apple dongle on different port. The interesting about this one is that the display that is attached to the MBP using the same dongle is not recognized as \"detached\" so macOS still thinks it is attached.\n\n\nThe only other relevant observation I could make is that in the system report the keyboard is still listed under USB.\nI hope I have mentioned everything, if anything is missing please let me know.\n\nA: To answer my own question:\nThe problem is not related to either my dongle or my keyboard.

The new MBPs with USB-C are supposed to work with Target Display Mode, using the Thunderbolt 2 to USB-C adapter. I have it connected with an official Apple Thunderbolt 2 cable and Thunderbolt 2 to USB-C adapter. But when I press Command-F2, nothing happens, like they aren't connected.\nI can already rule out the cable/adapter/USB-C port being defective, because I've used for transferring files from the old MacBook to the new one successfully. It also still works fine when I connect the Thunderbolt cable (directly) to my old MBP.\nAny ideas what I can do to debug the problem?\nEdit: I tried it out with a colleague's MBP 2017, same cable and adapter, and it worked flawlessly. So the problem seems to be limited to the new 2020 MBP. I am in direct contact with a very helpful (and seemingly persistent) 2nd line Apple Support employee about this now, so fingers crossed.\n\nA: Same issue here! \nNew 2020 MBP, using an apple USB-C to thunderbolt adapter, apple thunderbolt cable, mid 2011 iMac. \nApple support just informed me that they don't have this feature in newer devices. What a shame!\nI'm filling out a feedback form suggesting that they bring it back. Perhaps naively hopeful that they'll respond but worth a shot. \n\nA: I have the exact same problem. I spent about an hour with Apple's support team providing information. They are working on the problem, with one possibility being an issue in the latest Catalina update. I am running 10.15.4 on both my MacBook Pro (which is working) and on my wife's MBA (which isn't working). I updated the MBA to the latest Catalina version before trying Target Display Mode, so I don't know if it would have worked prior to the latest Catalina update.\n\nA: Although Target Display Mode has been retired and won't be coming back, it seems the new AirPlay to Mac functionality in macOS Monterey is the spiritual successor and like for like replacement for it!\n\nUse AirPlay to send content to your Mac from an iPhone, iPad, or\neven another Mac.

A wired connection\nis useful when you want to ensure that there’s no latency or you don’t\nhave access to Wi-Fi.\n\nIt should work with a MacBook Pro (2018 and later), MacBook Air (2018 and later), and iMac (2019 and later) or iMac Pro (2017).\nI am excited to try this out. If the iMac delivers enough power you can probably go with just one USB-c cable to your MacBook, similar to some of the current USB-c displays.\n", "Q: MacOS partition not working on bootcamp I used bootcamp to create a new windows partition. It works fine, but I can't see the mac hard drive in my Devices and Drivers in windows. I know that you used to be able to read files from mac os.\nI read this stackexchange question (How can I make Mac Partition visible in Bootcamp (Windows 10 Anniversary Update)?) but it didn't work. I had Bootcamp 6.0, but I installed the drivers from a site I found anyways. (It didn't work/change anything, I already had the registry keys) When I set \"H:\" to \"\\Device\\HarddiskVolume2\", it shows up as \"Local Disk (H:)\" instead of \"Macintosh HD\" or something. No other hard disk volume works; volume 1 is the 200MB partition, volume 3 is the windows partition, and no other volumes show up. When I open the Local Disk (H:), it asks me to reformat the hard drive.\n\nIn my disk management, my macos partition still doesn't show up as HFS, even though I have all the right drivers.\n\nWhat's the problem? I'm on windows 10, version 1909.\nEdit: Forgot to add, whenever I click \"Restart in OS X\" in windows, it tells me that it failed to locate the OS X boot volume.\n\nA: Windows cannot read APFS volumes. Boot Camp support software provides HFS+ drivers, not APFS. You will need third-party software to read files from APFS disks, such as https://www.paragon-software.com/home/apfs-windows/ (no affiliation and not tested).\n", "Q: macOS Catalina creates \"Relocated Items\" on every update I am running two new Mac's that both were delivered in 2020 with macOS 10.15 Catalina installed (2017 iMac Pro delivered in 2020 and the new 2020 MacBook Air). \nOn update from 10.15.4 -> 10.15.5 both of these Macs created Relocated Items and wiped out my the contents of my /etc and /var directories.\n\n\n*\n\n*My understanding is that this behavior is not expected for Catalina -> Catalina updates. The documentation on Relocated Items seems to apply mostly to Mojave -> Catalina. \n\n\nOn the iMac Pro, I was also redirected to the full setup procedure because /var/db/.AppleSetupDone was moved. This was also moved on the MacBook Air, so I'm not sure why I didn't see it there as well. \nMy conjecture is that this has to do with my use of synthetic.conf to create a link from /p that points to /Volumes. This is to map directories between system when I connect to a smb drive on a linux computer. But I can't see why this would cause any issues as it is supported mechanism. \n\n\n*\n\n*Why I think this may be related. The relocated items show in the directory: /Users/Shared/Relocated Items/Security/System/Volumes/Data/rivate which seems like a misspelling of \"private\" without the \"p\", which is my only clue. (Although, this seems like it would indicate something surprisingly sloppy in the coding...) \n\n*Also /Volumes/System/Data/private contains etc and var which are precisely the folders that are causing me problems. \n\n\nOther software that is impacted includes MacTex 2020 (which installs its paths in /etc). This also wipes out all the printers I install (because they put stuff into /etc as well). \nPossibly related...\n\n\n*\n\n*Setup Assistant Runs on Every Restart\nI ran the permissions to see if this has any impact on my next update. \nAny ideas would be helpful!\n\nA: *\n\n*I also experienced this problem over several Catalina and Big Sur updates.\n\n*I too had a /p link defined in /etc/synthetic.conf\n\n*I too noticed the rivate misspelling.\n\nSo before updating to macOS 11.4 today, I rebooted in recovery mode and removed my synthetic.conf. The update then installed normally, without blowing away my /var and /etc directories and without running the new installation setup. I conclude that having a /p link does cause this problem.\n\nA: This is totally expected and a result of the software needing an update.\nEvery macOS install can be a full archive and install and run the full migration, so you will see all of the changes needed as if the OS was a major update. Apple is releasing more and more large features in dot releases, so I treat every update other than a security patch as major.

Company X is developing Bluetooth speakers. We outsource our electronic chips from company Y and I'm working on developing a Bluetooth enabled app.\nWill the app get disapproved by Apple if the company X is not a part of the Apple MFi program?\n\nA: The company that plans to market the end product that carries the MiFi certification is responsible for obtaining that certification.\nThere’s no expectation that every component on the BOM be manufactured in house.  You have to submit product designs, plans, specifications and even packaging before you begin manufacturing.  Then you must submit samples for both mechanical and electrical testing to ensure that it complies.\nDo you need MiFi certification?\nNo.  You can develop products that have apps that provide their functionality be available via the App Store and not be MiFi certified.  One good example would be Bose.  They market headphones as “Apple Version” or “Android Version” with an app in the App store and there’s no MiFi certification.  Notice that the quoted text is not “Made for iPhone” (or similar).  To say that, would require MiFi certification.\nRegarding your specific situation, the FAQ provides answers:\n\nI want to develop an accessory that communicates with an Apple device using only Bluetooth Low Energy.

Situation: \nnew iMac \nmodel retina 21.5-inch 2019, 3.2GhZ 6-core intel Core i7\nI can not hear fans at all during normal non-cpu intensive operation (web browsing, etc.). They are at 1200 rpm. This is good.\nHowever, when I load the CPU to an average of only 34% (by spinning up 4 yes commands, as described here), the fans already become rather loud and stabilise at 2850 rpm.\nI consider 34% not very loaded. While the sound type of the fan doesn't sound abnormal (no ticking, or so) the sound level does sound unexpectedly high to me.  Loud being: an other person in the otherwise quiet living room asking 'what's going on?' when he hears it the first time, or almost approaching the sound level of a (generic brand) laptop with full fan speed, almost similar to a (soft) hair dryer. \nQuestion: Is this as expected for these iMacs?\nNote: \n\n\n*\n\n*I already performed the reset-SMC-procedure as suggested at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202179\n\n*To be honest, it is the sort of sound level I sort of perhaps could expect when CPU would operate at 100% for some time, but not for anything lower than 75%.\n\n*I do have 20+ years experience with several non-Apple laptop brands, 1st gen macbook, and a mid-2008 iMac. By which I mean: computers and the related noise levels are not new to me.\n\n*reporting from macOS Activity Monitor seems to be consistent with what the menu bar app (iStat Menus) shows. See second screenshot. (cfr comment)\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Without hearing the actual “noise” it’s pretty subjective as to what the actual level is.\nHowever, I did notice that you’re running at least 4 instances of yes that you’ve probably detached from the user so what you’re seeing in that 3rd party “analyzer” is incorrect.  Activity monitor will give you a better view.  \nThat said, yes is designed to max out your CPU and, as stated, you have at least four instances running.  Your CPU fans are going to turn on especially when the CPU is running at 90 degrees (the thermal cut off is usually around 100 depending on the CPU) under load.\nSo, what you’re seeing is perfectly normal and resetting the SMC won’t “fix” it because nothing is broken.  Why?  The fans come on based on temperature not on load.  And, temperature is more than just CPU temperature.  There are several temp sensors, even ones that measure the ambient air that go into calculating when and at what speed the fans spin up.  So trying to evaluate a malfunction of the SMC or a problem with the fans based on one factor is incorrect methodology.  \nSo, is this expected for Mac computers?  \nYes.  It’s no secret Apple has poor cooling and uses undersized heat sinks/pipes, and even uses (IMO) sub-standard thermal paste between the conductive surfaces.  It’s a tradeoff between the super elegant and ultra thin design and efficient thermal performance.\nYour Mac is running as expected.\n", "Q: Wifi not connecting after erasing hard drive on Macbook Pro 13\" 2019 I just erased my Macbook's hard drive (under MacOS Catalina) with touch bar from 2019.\nWhen I turn on the computer I press cmd and R, the planet shows off and I've to select a network to connect to.\nThe problem is that it won't connect to any of my Wifi connexion, I tried on my initial Wifi and two repeater. I also tried to connect it to my 4G and still didn't established a connexion.\nAfter looking into Apple's support, they suggested to test the DNS as explained here\nAfter doing it, here is what I've got : \nSorry for the french but it means that the Lookup failed, it threw the same error for my LTE too.\nSo I'm a bit lost, I'm about to sell it but I don't know how I can fix this since my Apple Store is closed due to Covid.\nDoes someone have a hint about what I can do/how to proceed.\nI thought about booting it from a hard drive but I didn't find anything for the Macbook Pro 2019 since it has no USB port, but if it's possible I can do it since I have my work Macbook Pro available so if someone could provide me a link or anything that could help I would really appreciate.\nThanks for your help\n\nA: The problem, as you’ve confirmed, is a DNS issue.  What’s happening is that your Mac has no way of finding the Recovery Host to connect to. \nmacOS Recovery Hosts and Ports\nNormally, this is taken care of in the router.  What happens is one of the two scenarios:\n\n\n*\n\n*The router acts as a DHCP relay.  In the DHCP offer, the DNS server value is the IP address of the router.  So any DNS request is sent to the router which is then sent to the actual DNS server(s) that are either automatically configured from the ISP or manually configured by you.\n\n*The router passes the DNS server addresses as part if the DHCP offer.  Whether automatically configured from the ISP or manually configured, the client (your Mac) gets the IPs of the actual DNS server(s) and makes the request directly.\nIf this is not happening...\n\n\n*\n\n*check your router configuration and make sure the DNS values ate being set.\n\n*Manually set the DNS server in macOS with the command networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 8.8.8.8 (Google’s DNS server)\n\n\nIf fixing DNS proves fruitless, you may need use a working Mac to create a USB Installer.  This will allow you to at least install the OS without needing the Internet and then, you can use whatever work around that fixes your DNS.\n\nA: You may take a wrong step to go. I presume that you erased disk prior to start recovery utlity first. The problem is embedded recovery utility may be erased, then it cannot start. It may try to connect to internet instead. Normally, macOS recovery utility (command + R) will use network connection previously used to connect to internet by default. You need not to setup any network connection. You may try to do option + command + R and trying to load internet recovery utility. I am not sure this will help, because you have no option to choose any networks where you can put your wifi access points and get to internet successfully. Please follow to this link; https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314 for better explanation.\n", "Q: Very large file located within ~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.lminhtm.tempmonitor/db.realm I am on a Mac Mini with a 1TB SSD. After a few years my SSD is running out of space, while I keep all my user data on an external drive. My system is loaded with Multimedia Apps Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro X, Garage Band and many others.\nWhen trying to find the file(s) that can be removed on the SSD, using CleanMyMac X function of Space Lens, I bump into a very large file in /Users/username/Library/Group Containers/group.com.lminhtm.tempmonitor/db.realm. This file is a whacking 378GB!\nThrough Google searches I can’t find any mention of this file.\nDoes anyone have a suggestion?\n\nA: Group Containers are basically Containers, which are sandboxes for applications to store date (user data, caches, logs, etc), except the Group part means that it's at a developer level. This could be used to, for instance, keep a user logged into the same account across multiple apps made by the same developer. That said, it could be used for anything, which is what this appears to be. \nYou could check with the developer, in this case: https://github.com/lminhtm. Otherwise, I'd make a backup and delete (or just move it to a different location), then test any apps you have from this developer (maybe this one?).\n\nA: My suggestion is to back up the file and delete it. You can also watch the date - is it growing and being updated regularly or static with no changes for some time?\nThere are unix command-line tools that can track which process has the file open if it’s getting updates on a daily or more often basis.\nLastly. You could uninstall any third party temperature tracking. Coconut Battery, menu bar controls like iStat pro and others have logging features you may not have intended to collect data and store it in this database. One thing for sure, it’s not part of the OS so you can delete it and restart your Mac without causing harm to the system. You can then watch for an error in any programs if they recreate the file or throw an error trying to read a missing file.\n\nA: Thanks much for the answers/suggestions! I haven't found the reason for the existence of the file, but I deleted it and have been waiting for the last 2 days for any mishaps, and no further errors until now. Thanks a lot for the suggestions.\n", "Q: How can I make a Dynamic wallpaper (like the ones in macOS Catalina) in OS X Yosemite I am running OS X Yosemite (10.10.5) and I want to make a dynamic wallpaper (or use the one from macos mojave), is there an extension or something that allows me to do this sort of thing\n\nA: I don't think there is a way to do this effectively because dynamic wallpapers were introduced in macOS Mojave (10.14) alongside dark mode. The dynamic wallpaper is reliant on that although you could try doing an AppleScript script that changes the wallpaper based on the time or whether you're in dark mode or not. Wallpapers are found at the path /System/Library/Desktop Pictures. You can try adding your wallpaper(s) there and then using AppleScript or Bash as a startup item that is always running in the background and changed the wallpaper based on the time.\n", "Q: Am i able to install Win 10 on a Macbook Pro '15 running Catalina (model no. 12,5) with/without bootcamp properly? I'm running Catalina 10.15 on this 5 year old Macbook Pro, and i was wondering if it could install the free version of Win 10 (possibly upgrading to full Windows 10 Home after) with the installer or media creation tool, preferably. I've researched other people change to Windows only using third-party tools not Bootcamp only (creating a partition for the OS, have a USB stick, then deleting macos and finally adding the drivers and programs needed).\nBootcamp would be my other choice of course if it isn't possible with either the model i have or macOS version. Hoping to have just Windows 10 on it because i am fed up with macOS and its limitations (don't know why i bought it back then, lol). Heard bootcamp does have a few kinks like boot time and other software stuff on Mac so thats why i'm not planning to do it like that.\nSo if anyone that knows all this well could get me through this, it'd be cool! Am decent with computers and all but not too savvy on Macs/macOS. Thanks.\n\nA: If you wish to create a USB Windows 10 installer, the process if fairly simple. \n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Windows Support Software (the drivers).\n\n*Download the Windows 10 ISO from this website.\n\n*Erase a 16 GB or larger flash drive. Use the Master Boot Record scheme and ExFAT format.\n\n*Copy the files from the Windows Support Software download and Windows 10 ISO to the flash drive.\n\n\nIf you do not wish to use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows 10 to the internal drive, then apply the following steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are going to keep some existing partitions, then create free space or contiguous partitions which can be deleted during the Windows installation.\n\n*Restart the Mac and hold down the option key until the Mac Startup Manager icons appear.\n\n*Select the EFI Boot under the external drive icon.\n\n*When asked for a Product Key, you can select to skip this step. If you skip, then at some point (30 days?) you will need to enter a product key. \n\n*During the installation, either erase the entire internal drive or install to available free space. This may require first deleting any unneeded partitions.\n\n\nA: In a word, yes.\nIt seems to be a 2015 15-inch MacBook Pro with a core i7 Processor. That is plenty of horsepower to install Windows, assuming you have enough disk space to dedicate to Windows (I wouldn't go less than 20GB) it should work fine.\nNot sure what you mean about the free version of Windows 10, though. While Microsoft did give free licenses to people upgrading from previous versions of Windows I am unsure if that is still in effect. And as you are not really upgrading a version of Windows, you don't qualify under those rules.\nHowever, you are welcome to give it a try. Apple has some info on what to do and how to do it here. I would have a look at all of Apple's documentation on the subject so you are familiar with the process.\nOnce you have done so put an ISO of Windows 10 on your Mac (you can download a copy but without a license key, you won't get far) get out an 8GB USB key that has nothing on it that you can't afford to lose. and run the Boot Camp Assistant in your Applications folder. It's pretty good and will walk you through the steps required to install Windows 10 on your Mac, turning it into a Dual OS bootable Mac with Catalina and Windows 10 on it.\nPlan on it taking a couple of hours for the whole process. As much because doing this takes some time and also requires you to pay close attention to the process so you don't screw it up.\nAlso note that since you are re-partitioning your internal hard drive (where macOS and all your Apps and files reside) it would be a really good idea to make a full backup of your Mac before proceeding.\nI have done this a number of times and had no problems nor had any data loss but then I have been doing Mac support since... Well, let's just say the first Mac I have any experience with is a second generation 512K Macintosh (the so called \"Fat Mac\") So this stuff is second nature to me.

Normally DuckDuckGo to search, occasionally Google.\nBut if I highlight something, for example in an iMessage, and right click I'll always get \"Search Google for ....\" if search is set to Google in Safari.  Or \"Search DuckDuckGo for .... \" if that's how Safari is set.\nSo at the very least I'd like two options available - for two different search engines as in \"Search Google for ....\"/\"Search DuckDuckGo for .... \".\nValhalla would be the ability to select the browser too.\nIs it possible?\n\nA: It's not possible in Safari. It uses whichever search engine you define in Safari preferences. And the same applies to Google. Best I can do is use the one option they offer. I  don't know about other browsers.  There might be a programmatic way to do it but I don't know how to do it. \nIn Safari, it's way easier to change search engine. Go to address bar  (command+L), enter space(spacebar), choose search engine. There's no need to go to Safari preferences to do it. \n\nA: Set your browser to Duck Duck Go. You can always get google results by adding bang g !g on any search if you don’t find what you want first from the Duck.\n\n*\n\n*https://duckduckgo.com/bang\n", "Q: Tools to compare/diff resource forks? I'm trying to determine if any data corruption has occurred on my old recording archives, which include copious quantities of Sound Designer II (SD2) files. In the SD2 file format, the resource fork is as vital as the data fork, so I need to use file comparison/diff tools which check both the data and resource forks and flag changes to either.\nNot surprisingly, most modern file comparison tools don't even mention the (now deprecated) resource fork in their documentation. Are any tools available which definitely scan the resource fork on HFS+ volumes?\n\nA: The Eclectic Light Company offers a number of extended attribute utilities, including one named cmpxat that compares all extended attributes, including the resource fork. From what I can determine, it won't show the exact differences, but will report whether there are any differences, including whether an extended attribute exists on only one file. The current version of cmpxat always exits successfully, so to determine whether there is a difference, you'll need to check the output (which you'd need to do anyway to check whether there's a difference in the resource fork specifically).\nAnother option is to compare the files from the command line, appending ..namedfork/rsrc to each pathname. For example, you can get a list of differing files using find. With the files in directory $root and the archive in $archive, and assuming the directory structures are the same:\ncd $root;\nfind . -exec diff -q {}/..namedfork/rsrc \\\n          \"$archive\"/{}/..namedfork/rsrc \\; \\\n    | sed -e 's/^Files (.*) and .* differ/\\1/'\n\n", "Q: Use MacBook as microphone for iPhone? I have made-for-iphone hearing aids, which are great for delivering good quality speech sound over bluetooth direct to my hearing aids. They are Starkey Kinnect, which connect easily to iOS devices but have no connectivity to a computer - they do not pair with the Bluetooth on the MacBook (2014 version). With the current need for Zoom, Google Meets etc connectivity, I am often in video meetings for which I need to use my MacBook for the size of screen. The sound is preferably directed through earphones, but they do not give clear speech for me without the hearing aids and are awkward and clumsy to use over the HAs.\nStarkey TruLink has an option to use the iPhone as a microphone and send this across the room (say) to my HAs. I wonder whether the 3.5 mm headphone jack on the MacBook, set as output, can plug directly in to the Lightning port on the iPhone (via what adaptor?) to use the audio stream from the computer as an external microphone for the iPhone, which can then connect to the HAs? Are the voltages and impedances compatible?\nOr does anyone know of a gadget that will do this mimicry of an external mike?\nI am aware of the Airfoil utility that is claimed to do this, but not sure if the iPhone will recognise this as a \"microphone\", and also I have seen reviews that state that the latency is about 2s so it is unsuitable for real time use.\nThanks!\nKeith\n\nA: I have ReSound made-for-iPhone HAs. ReSound sell a device called a \"multi mic\" and also a \"mini mic\" which is a remote microphone which will transmit direct to the HAs. It also has a 3.5mm jack so can be plugged into a computer (or TV) and the computer sound is sent straight to my HAs. Speaker is cut off. I keep a dedicated multi mic permanently connected to my computer. To hear computer sound streamed to my HAs I just have to change to the correct streaming source on my phone. Works brilliantly and has had a lot of extra use with Zoom meetings.\nI would be amazed if Starkey don't make a similar device.\nI would add that the multi mic is extremely useful in many other situations.\n\nA: I'm no expert but I did play around with bluetooth/mics/headphones and my experience would suggest you probably won't be able to do it.  Your \"made for apple\" hearing aids have bluetooth 5.0 I think.  Likewise the latest airpods and the powerbeats pro.  Even the powerbeats high-performance which Apple currently sell don't work as a Listen Live device they say.  Certainly my experience with a 2017 Macbook and Audacity was that the latency (possibly 1 sec rather than 2 sec) was totally unacceptable - just confuses everything!  The Macbook was Bluetooth 4.2 and I think that's where the problem lies.  Likewise my experimenting with an iPhone SE with Bluetooth 4.2.\nBluetooth 5 is double the speed of Bluetooth 4.2 and I think if you don't have that at every single stage in the chain you'll get unacceptable latency.\nSorry for the gloomy answer!  \n", "Q: Do I need to upgrade my machine in order to release app updates on the App store? I've been developing using Xcode (10.1) on an iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2010) running macOS High Sierra (Version 10.13.6).\nThe last time I updated my app on the App Store, I got a warning:\n\nITMS-90725: SDK Version Issue - This app update was built with the iOS 12.1 SDK. As of June 30, 2020, updates to apps for iPhone or iPad must be built with the iOS 13 SDK or later.\n\nI read that iOS 13 SDK comes bundled with Xcode 11.\nBut when I go to App Store → Updates, I don't see anything to update on my iMac. I can expose \"1 incompatible Update\", which is \"Xcode Version 11.5\", which should include iOS 13 SDK. This is what I would need in order to keep updating my app on the App Store, but it's \"incompatible\".\nThe problem seems to be confirmed by this compatibility chart.

I really don't need or want to buy another computer just to do this.\n\nA: macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 is as far as your iMac can go and the last version of Xcode supported on this version of macOS is Xcode 10.1 which comes with iOS 12.1 SDK.\nYou can not install any app updates from the Mac App Store that have a minimum OS version number requirement that is later that the one you have installed.\n\nMy question is, is there any work-around that would allow me to use my current machine, but build using iOS 13 SDK?\n\nSadly no. It's not possible to run Xcode 11.x or later which includes the iOS 13.x SDK on macOS High Sierra 10.13.6.\nDepending on your machine configuration, you may explore the possibility of running a virtual machine on your iMac that can then run macOS Mojave or macOS Catalina which in turn could run Xcode 11.x. That's the only way you can build an app with iOS 13 SDK and submit it on the App Store. But again that's neither a convenient or a future proof approach.\n\nI power-on this machine on three or four times per year, in order to make a tweak to the application, and then upload the new app to the App Store.

Will I lose all photos and data?\n\nA: No. Your data won't be deleted automatically when you downgrade your plan. You'd be given a grace period to download your data. Also, the storage decrease takes effect after your current monthly or annual subscription ends.\nIf you have more data than the space available in your iCloud storage, the excess data won't sync to the iCloud servers and you'd be alerted that you are out of space.\n\nA: There is a grace period for you to move the data off iCloud!

After turning my input volume to max and disabling ambient noise reduction, I was still only barely audible.\nI have tried resetting my PRAM and SMC, but to no avail. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: It sounds like a hardware failure, however if you have the ability create a boot drive for yourself and try starting up off the fresh volume to test the microphone, that would be ideal.\nIf you don't have a boot drive ready yet, you can try creating a test user account to try the microphone under.\nCheck the drive using disk utility, just in case as well.\nI have a faulty microphone on an iPad that acts the exact same way -- physical taps and bumps will be picked up but nothing standard.

How is this possible over a USB port if this power usage isn't defined as part of the specification?\n\nA: In the official website, it say \"USB Power Adapter\" without specifying which version of the USB port, why do you think it's 2.0 version ? \nAlso, the power allowance from USB 2.0 specification is for powering connected devices (mice, keyboards...). For charging, there is Battery Charging Specification\nYou can read more in here:\nhttps://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/tutorials/4/4803.html\n\nA: \nFrom my understanding, the USB 2.0 specification allows for a maximum power draw of 2.5w\n\nNo.  Laptop USB 2.0 ports typically supply 5V at 500mA for 2.5W of power (Watts = Volts x Amps).

How is this possible...\n\nIt’s important to note that there’s no “Charging Specification” within the USB 2.0 Specifications.  In fact, the word “charging” doesn’t even appear!\nAs for chargers (like wall or car), there were a number of tricks that manufacturers employed and Apple was no different.  In fact Apple has a little bit if trickery to get more current into their devices and, in short, it involved not only using the +5V pin, but the data pins (D+ and D-) as well.\nWhat Apple did was use some pull-up and pull-down resistors to get additional voltages of 2.8V and 2V on the unused data pins which resulted in an additional 1A of current!\n\nSource: adafruit \nWhen creating the Minty-Boost charger, Lady Ada did an excellent writeup called The mysteries of Apple device charging.  It’s an excellent read and the project is actually a fun intro into electronics. .\n", "Q: What is the difference between processors i5 and i7 of MBP 2020 13 inch? According to geek bench portal there is no significant performance changes:\nMacbook Pro 2020, 13 inch, i7, 4 June\n\nMacbook Pro 2020, 13 inch, i5 4 June\n\nMacbook Pro 2020, 13 inch, i5 7 May\n\nMacbook Pro 2020, 13 inch, i7 7 May\n\nWhat makes the difference between them? \n\nA: Individual Geekbench scores will vary: you need to look at the average (or max score) from a range of users to get a better idea. \nThe usual difference between i5 and i7 CPUs is that the i7s have HyperThreading: 2 virtual cores per actual core. So when you look in Activity Monitor, you will see 8 cores in the CPU Usage window, and process values up to 800%. \nHowever, Intel does make some i5 CPUs that do have HT, just to confuse the branding. (Similarly, i3 CPUs used to have HyperThreading but no TurboBoost until the 9th gen, when TurboBoost was added.)\nIn short: if the geekbench scores are similar, and the CPUs do have similar characteristics, then there probably isn't much meaningful difference. \n", "Q: How to remove my daughter as the AppleID organizer My daughter is the organizer for our family Apple account.  I'd like to remove her, my credit card is attached.  Can I do this without accessing her phone or do I need to cancel my credit card and create a new apple account?\n\nA: TLDR; Don't cancel your AppleID, Do suspend the card or ask anyone using it to replace it whether they are in a family group or not. Then sort out the family sharing group - any account can leave at any time on their own. Then make a new group with the new organizer. Repeat leaving and joining as needed. Apple restricts each account to one family change a year, so be sure of your new plans before switching things up.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201088\nSince only the Organizer can disband the group, individuals may have to leave if the organizer is unavailable or unwilling to act. When this happens, only a temporary loss to updates of apps happens - no data is lost. Keep each account intact - no need to make new accounts unless someone is sharing an account and needs their own personal AppleID.\nTo switch the grouping - have the \"soon to be new\" organizer AppleID leave (voluntarily any account can leave or by having the organizer remove them). Then the new organizer makes a new family group as them as the new organizer.\nAt that point anyone is free to choose to stick with the old group or join the new group and when I say anyone - that's the action taken by each AppleID.\nBilling needs to be sorted out on an account by account basis. Each AppleID has billing - and if you are not in control of that AppleID or can't wait for them - you have to cancel that card or suspend that card temporarily. This can happen no matter who is in the family group, or whether an account is an Organizer / Parent or member of the group.\n", "Q: Catalina 10.15.5 Slow File Dialog Since the 10.15.5 Catalina update, file dialogs in my system are extremely slow. It can easily take a couple of minutes to be able to save something to the disk. Never had a similar problem before. \nRan a disk check, made sure that I have free disk space (more than 400GB).\nOtherwise, the machine is running smoothly, without any other issues.  \nTried googling around and found out that there was a similar issue back with Sierra. Tried to apply the proposed fixes, but to no avail. \nIn Safe Mode the problem doesn't appear to persist.\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated! \nMachine specs: Mac (Retina 4K, 21.5-inch, 2017), 3,4 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5, 8 GB 2400 MHz DDR4, 1TB Fusion Drive.\nUpdate:\nNo finder extensions installed.

While it's stuck, the CPU usage by the process gets close to 100%. Doesn't matter the application I'm using - QuickTime, Pages, Microsoft Word, Photoshop or Safari\n\n\nUpdate 3:\nBooted up in the recovery mode and reinstalled Catalina keeping all the computer data. The problem persists\nUpdate 4:\nInstalled BitDefender Trial version in order to make sure there is no malware/virus/whatever on my machine. 90 minutes later - nothing found, but the problem persists.\nUpdate 5:\nConfigured a new administrator account on the Mac. While configuring it, unchecked all iCloud features - the problem doesn't reproduce using that account. \nUpdated the new account with iCloud settings (photos sync, documents sync), the problem doesn't appear. \n\nA: I spent about a year working with Apple technical support on something that sounds just the same. The good news is that, assuming your problem is the same as mine, there is an easy fix.  The challenge in diagnosis is that some interaction between iCloud and the Finder appears to be involved. iCloud's involvement is why problem persists across reinstalling the system, etc.\nThey fix was to delete either the dyld shared cache or the XPC cache. Unfortunately, I can't remember which it was and can't find my notes from then. But, since they are both just caches, there is no harm in deleting either or both.\nThe best way I found to do it is to download the Onyx app (free from https://www.titanium-software.fr/en/index.html). Under the \"Maintenance\" tab withing Onyx, you'll see the option to delete either or both of those caches. Do so, reboot and see if your problem is fixed. Once I did this, it fixed the problem entirely and it hasn't reappeared in over 2 years. There is probably a way to do this from the Terminal (indeed, Onyx is mostly just a wrapper over command line functionality), but Onyx worked great for me.  I hope this helps you.\n\nA: You have ascertained that the problem does not occur in a new user account. That means something in your original user account Library is causing the problem. \nIt could be some software running in the background, like a Login Item, or LaunchAgent; or some preferences that are corrupt, or initiating something undesirable.\n\n\n*\n\n*In System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items, deselect everything, and test each item in turn.\n\n*Check the contents of <user>/Library/LaunchAgents. Remove anything there and restart. \n\n\nIf those don't improve matters, then it's possible some corrupt preferences may be causing the issue. You'll have to trawl through <user>/Library/Preferences, and test the problem after removing some of the com.apple.xxxx.plist files. I suggest removing them all; test the problem. If things work, then replace half of them; test the problem. If things don't work, remove half of the ones you put back. And so on.\nAs the problem relates to com.apple.appkit.xpc, you could try removing the com.apple.xpc.activity.plist files, and similar, first of all.\nThis may be tedious, and it's possible that the problem lies in some other part of the User Library folder, but each step narrows it down further and further. You could try deleting all user Caches, too.\nThe alternative is migrating to a new user account (\"'slash and burn\"). That's fine, but if you do that every time you get a user account problem, you'll end up with a string of user accounts, and files looking for different paths, and permissions issues, etc.\n\nA: After trying to identify the source of the problem for a long time, I decided it's not worth it and completely migrated to a new user account on the same machine. While using the new user account there are no signs of the problem.\nI also just realised that the produced the same issue for my MacBook. Will have to migrate to a new user on it too.\n\nA: I deleted /Library/Cache files and then removed all files in /Library/LaunchAgents.\nSolved my problem and file open dialog is very quick now. seems to have resolved the problem for me.\n", "Q: \"Turn display off after\" setting is not saved I have a 16\" Macbook Pro which is suffering from a common bug that causes it to kernel panic every time it sleeps. Until Apple fixes this (presuming they actually do), I am trying to work around it by telling the Mac not to sleep while plugged in:\n\nHowever, every time I restart my computer (because I have to unplug it sometimes and then it sleeps and crashes), it forgets this setting and resets it to 5 minutes! Why isn't this setting saved?\nI'm using MacOS 10.15.5.\n\nA: I would start with resetting the SMC and NVRAM on your system -- If I recall a lot of the sleep settings are in one of the two -- likely SMC.\nTo reset SMC: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\nTo reset NVRAM: Shut down computer. Hold Apple, Option, P, R on keyboard as you power on -- keep holding until you hear the startup chime a second time and let go.\nTypically I use my left hand to get Apple, Option, P. Then right hand to press power and quickly get the R held down.\n\nA: For me I need drag the slider to the target minutes, but click to set not work.\n", "Q: Will deleting a device from iCloud remove data from that device? I bought my sister and iPhone and used my Apple id to help set up her phone. Now I want to delete her phone from my iCloud so she can set up her own Apple id. If I delete her device from my iCloud will it affect or remove any of the data on her phone?\n\nA: Removing the phone from your iCloud 'find my' structure won't in itself remove any data from the phone…\n…but re-assigning it to a new owner will. It will have to be set up again from scratch.\nAs the phone is currently owned by your Apple ID, so are all the apps & the data stored within them.

I am restoring an ancient PowerPc iMac and I have a very peculiar situation.\nThe iMac has a new ssd drive where Mac Os 9 is installed and works perfectly.\nI would like to install also 10.4 Tiger but the original install disks are long gone and burning a bootable disc seems impossible (I tried anything).\nThe old 20GB hdd contains a perfectly working Tiger install and I could connect that HDD via USB because I have an adapter.\nIs there any method that would allow me to end in a situation where I have both working and bootable operating systems on the new ssd?\nMaybe copying the old disk to a partition on the new one?\n\nA: Oh goody a classic MacOS question...\nThe nice thing about the classic MacOS is that once it is installed you need little else besides the files in the system folder. Yes there is the \"blessing\" of the system folder but if it is your intention to use it in a \"Classic Environment\" inside macOS then you should not need to worry about that.\nConnect the drive with the macOS Tiger installation and boot from that. I think that will work. Some older Macs cant boot from USB. Failing that can you put it in an old firewire enclosure?\nThe goal here is that once booted into macOS Tiger just drag the folders from the classic install on the SSD to your Tiger drive. Put them at the root of your (Tiger) Mac HD and take the whole system folder, applications folder and anything else you need.\nI did this a while ago and while I was at it I made a zip archive of the whole thing, \"just in case.\" Just in case happened and I unzipped the files and it worked a treat.\nOnce you have done that you can use an old (shareware) copy of Carbon Copy Cloner to \"back up\" the Tiger drive with MacOS 9 on it to the internal SSD.\n", "Q: How does windowing system work on MacOS? I'm really interested in computer graphics and I would like to know how windowing and graphics systems work on MacOS.\nI've started to learn how to create a window in objective-c but then I told myself that it doesn't explain what does objective-c \"ask\" to the hardware exactly. So I've read about X11 but I still had to install another program 'XQuartz'.\nDo you have any suggestions to learn how to create a window from scratch without using any framework or library on MacOS, if it is even possible? And if it's not possible on MacOS, do you know what makes it impossible (or complicated) on MacOS?\n\nA: Macs have their own windowing system called AppKit which is not based on X11. You can certainly install X11 and use it but it's not how most Mac apps work. Creating a window from the ground up with no frameworks is going to take some work, and is maybe better suited for Stack Overflow. Even there though, this is such a rare need that you might have trouble getting an answer.\nIf you want to get into the real low-level details of making things work, resources exist, though you can no doubt Google as well as me. One good starting point might be the New OSX Book site.\nA simple example with minimal framework code might look like this:\nimport Foundation\nimport AppKit\n\nlet aWindow = NSWindow(\n    contentRect: NSMakeRect(0, 0, 400, 210), \n    styleMask: [.titled, .closable], \n    backing: .buffered, \n    defer: false)\naWindow.makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil)\n\nRunLoop.current.run()\n\n\nA: What does objective-c \"ask\" to the hardware exactly?\nDevelopers use the MacOS APIs to instruct the OS to perform common tasks, like creating a window, moving a window, resizing a window. This frees developers from having to code at the hardware level, or rewriting code for writing windows all the time. What happens 'underneath' is largely transparent. \nApple has released some parts of the OS as Open Source, but I don't think Core Graphics is one of them.\nProgramming is a series of abstractions. Ultimately, the computer has to plot colours for each pixel of the display. So imagine an array that describes the colour value for each pixel of the display. Now imagine a way of grouping cells in that array as rectangles, circles, lines, and other shapes. And then stick NSWindow at the very top.\nX11 was created as a common 'front-end' to a variety of different hardware running Unix. As with MacOS APIs, it doesn't really tell much about what goes on 'underneath'. If you want to search for video driver frameworks or low-level hardware programming, then there will be resources you can find.\n", "Q: Disk locked after formatting I am selling my iMac and I formatted every disk which also included startup disk and there is none. Now when I go to reinstall macOS, it shows the disk is locked. When I go to disk utility, it shows me no option of format e.g. Journal etc. It only has AFPS option. \nWhat can I do to reinstall the OS?\n\nA: In disk utility you will want to choose \"View\" in the upper left and then select \"Show All Devices\".\nFrom there you should be able to select the Internal drive at the very top of the list and select erase as you're used to.\n\nOnce you've erased the drive you can now quit Disk Utility, and go back to the Mac OS installer as you had been doing.

It’s identified by these numbers at such-and-such and address.”  That’s a very simplistic description of what happens but it encapsulates the concept.\nHardware is functional when a driver(kext) is loaded and the device can be used by the system to do whatever it’s designed to do (i.e. webcam displays pictures and captures sound)\nYour Thunderbolt subsystem has failed\nNow, if a previously functional device suddenly is no longer detected, the device has failed.  It could be the Thunderbolt controller or the associated circuitry, but in the end, it has failed to the point where the system doesn’t see it.\n\nI’m almost positive that it's a firmware issue as per the system does not see any thunderbolt firmware.\n\nUnlikely. Even if the firmware was corrupted, your system would  report an “unknown device” because something would be there, it just can’t identify what it is.  Upgrading/downgrading firmware is not going to work if it can’t find the device which to apply the update.\nDiagnostics\nThe very first thing that should be invoked long before you reinstall the or do any sort of firmware patching is to run Apple Hardware Test (Hold D while booting).  An OS reinstall should be done last.  In fact, you should install macOS onto an external drive and boot off of that instead of wiping the drive.  Why? If there is any sort of forensic evidence of the failure, it gets erased with the new install.\nResetting the NVRAM and SMC are usually fruitless because they’re unrelated, but it can’t harm anything.  Before wiping the hard drive and reinstalling the OS, try Safe Mode or Recovery Mode.  These are clean, versions of macOS (Recovery, especially) that have only the native drivers.  If the hardware device can’t be seen here, it’s definitely a hardware failure.\nBottom line\nIt’s got to go in for service or you need to replace the unit.\n", "Q: How to ensure a stolen MacBook Pro Retina is useless to a thief?

I keep it in my backpack. While the threat of it being stolen doesn't loom too badly where I live, and I don't ever let it out of my reach, I still want to make sure that my Mac is useless to a thief if it is stolen.\nCurrently, I have FileVault 2 full-disk encryption enabled, as well as Find My Mac enabled to the full extent and I have a password set on the EFI to prevent booting from external volumes. \nHow effective would this be, and is there anything I could do additionally to ensure they can't bypass these measures to use or sell the machine?\n\nA: The security you’ve enabled probably won’t deter the theft of your laptop.  Most criminals who get the opportunity to snatch a laptop will take it no matter how useless you can make it with encryption and firmware locks.  \nWhy?\n\n\n*\n\n*Ignorance of the criminal.  No matter how much Apple advertises it, the common thief won’t know until they get it back home only to find they got a brick.  Then it will probably become a frizbee.\n\n*Salvage value.  Although useless as a computer, the machine becomes a “donor” for the parts including the screen, trackpad, keyboard etc.  even the logic board can supply someone with a ton of components to be used in logic board repair\n\n\nYour strategy should be data protection, ensuring that no matter where your computer ends up, you have quick, secure access to your work product.  Enabling remote wipe is invaluable in making sure your data stays secure.  \nI would also look at insurance coverage for that expensive device.  Many credit cards cover theft.  There are also 3rd party insurance coverage from companies like Safeware\n", "Q: Would this loophole for stolen MacBook Pro Retina work, or can macOS detect this and stop it? Imagine a Late 2013 Retina MacBook Pro. It's got FileVault 2 enabled, it's been shut down (so the disk is encrypted) and the EFI Password is set, so they can't boot from another disk or reinstall macOS. I've also locked the Mac, but we'll imagine Find My Mac hasn't been able to phone home yet.\nThey can't Command-R or Option-Power their way past, and they can't access the copy of Catalina installed on the drive. My question is this: could they install a copy of macOS onto another compatible SSD and then replace my Mac's internal SSD with said other SSD, bypassing EFI Lock because it's classified as the internal drive? Or can Apple's EFI detect that the drive is different and refuse it, asking for a password?\nAs someone who carries my MacBook Pro Retina on me at all times, and plans on a somewhat pricey upgrade to a newer model sometime in the future, I'd like to ensure I can make this thing a glorious paperweight for any would-be thief. \n\nA: No.  The firmware lock prevents even this.  Firmware doesn’t reside on the drive, it resides in a protected “memory” (not RAM) area that holds the boot, encryption, management, etc. software.\nIn fact, if you want to test it, set an EFI lock and remove the drive.  Then try to boot.  You’ll notice that the password is still there \n\nAs someone who carries my MacBook Pro Retina on me at all times, and plans on a somewhat pricey upgrade to a newer model sometime in the future, I'd like to ensure I can make this thing a glorious paperweight for any would-be thief.\n\nYou’re in luck because the new Mac computers with the T2 chip take security much further with Secure Boot and whole disk encryption.  Once these features are enabled, would  be thieves would end up with great looking paper weights.\n", "Q: Where/how are default input methods stored? I use the Cangjie input method to type Chinese characters. The one bundled with macOS is an older \"version\" of the input method that I don't particularly enjoy using. So far I've been getting by with using a third-party IME (Rime) but for various reasons it's not ideal either. I know that Macs support custom plaintext *.cin files but I'm looking for something different.\nI'm curious where and how default Chinese and Japanese input methods are stored in general. Maybe a filepath, and if the file is in some esoteric format possibly external software to read/edit the data? My goal is to see if I can write a script to change the character mappings to the ones I'm accustomed to.\nHope this question isn't too specific. If this is better suited for another StackExchange forum just give me a heads up and I can ask it somewhere else.\n\nA: The Chinese and Japanese IM's (along with several others) are in System/Library/Input Methods.\nFor some alternatives that may offer more options, see this page.\nhttps://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2017/05/macos-alternative-input-methods-for.html\n", "Q: How do I mount a Synology remote folder on iPad running iOS 13.3 I have a number of shared folders on a Synology drive which I can mount without any issues on a couple of different Macbooks running different versions of Mac OSX.

Once When I boot into Windows 10, an error shows up 'No Bootable Device — Insert Boot Disk and Press Any Key'. Then I have tried to change the startup disk, enter into recovery mode, safe mode, inserted Mac OS bootable disk ,Windows bootable disk. Nothing worked and I have even removed the Hard disk.Still stuck on the same error. I can't do anything on my MBP. I have tried all the startup key combinations and none of that worked with both inbuilt keyboard and external keyboard.  \nI would like to fix this MBP but Holding option key for changing startup disk or holding other key combination for Recovery doesn't work on internal keyboard or external keyboard.\nWhat are the next steps to fix this?\n\nA: This is a rare case when no keyboard works to enter the test / reset / restore screens one of two things is happening.\n\n\n*\n\n*The Main logic board is not able to process keyboard input from any source - you need a repair to the internals.\n\n*The USB bus that sends keyboard signals is broken or the physical keyboard is issuing key down commands so fast that the processing is unable to read legitimate key presses. You need a repair to the internals.\n\n\nBoth paths lead to a hardware issue if you can't bring an external USB keyboard to get the system to let you attempt to choose an OS or start internet recovery. There's no third way to get in since you would need the OS to boot and a network to ssh in via a working system and keyboard.\n\nA: At first, take a USB drive loaded with a fresh copy of macOS, then try to boot from the USB drive. If it does not work try Internet Recovery Mode (Cmd+Opt+R) and press the Power it can download your very first OS from the internet.\n", "Q: OSX increase display font size without changing display resolution? I am using an iMac 5k display. The system display font is really too small but the only way the system gives, the casual operator, to change the size of the system display font is to reduce the screen resolution. This frustrates me since I have a 5k screen and I want to use it for fine lines and large text/fonts simultaneously.\nAnother solution is to put my nose up against the screen or wear reading/computer glasses – these solutions are not what I seek.\nI would imagine that there is a way to change this font size setting by using the console/terminal. \nDoes anyone know how to do that and would you be so kind as to share the information?\n\nA: A not universal subset of user interface fonts can be changed while keeping the actual resolution the same. (Note that 'the Apple-sanctioned way' is detailed in bmike's answer.)\nThis effect is limited, not always a good idea, but easily achieved with the free tool:  \nTinkerTool.\nAn illustration of the capabilities:\nDefault values:\n\n\n'Tinkered values':\n\n\nBigger 'tinkered values', also showing the limits of this method even in those applications that will respect these choices:\n\n\nThis solution seems to be most useful if screen real estate is of great concern – like on a laptop – and 'the Apple-way' of scaling only offers 'not fine enough' choices for a user. For example if you prefer the smaller UI elements of a 'higher resolution' but would then need some slightly bigger fonts to avoid eye strain. \n\nA: There's no simple way to enlarge text across the board and not also affect the scaling. Worse, if you change the size without the app or system knowing, menus and labels will collide and clip. Smart apps know that you have 5k resolution and that the UI is scaled up and still draw fonts and lines crisply so the down side to reducing “resolution” is mitigated and in some cases eliminated letting you use resolution as a proxy for default font size.\nApple glosses over this distinction in the technical details behind this in the user guide, but adjusted the resolution of your primary display is the biggest lever you have to manage text size globally.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/\n\nSet the resolution for your primary display\n  1. On your Mac, choose Apple menu  > System Preferences, click Displays, then click Display.\n  2. Select Scaled, then select one of the options.\n\n\nNext once you are happy with the size of the UI (dock / menu bar, etc...) and observe that other elements like lines, fonts, gradients are rendered with higher fidelity than the “resolution” allows, then go to the Accessability features to set system wide zoom and hover text. These further boost apps that aren’t on board with taking hints from the resolution and to convince yourself of quality of the rendering.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/\nLastly, you might want or need to make changes on an app by app basis for apps that don’t follow Apple’s system wide visibility and font sizing controls. As mentioned in the comments - the raw resolution never changes and the controls \"hint\" at what factor and detail to draw major aspects. Some apps respect this well, others you will need to use the zoom controls and hope they persist your adjustments across documents and when you quit those apps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Safari uses zoom well and persists it per tab/window well.\n\n*Terminal app also uses zoom well and persists it per tab/window/shell well.\n\n\nIn addition to app specific zooming, Accessibility has a system zoom that is very responsive and powerful if you need to keep all the UI super detailed / small and zoom in on areas from time to time or semi-permanently to get larger view on apps that don't scale well to full retina resolution.\n\n\nA: One big benefit (pun intended) of a super high resolution monitor on a relatively small screen is the increase in dpi. The beloved Retina display is not just the product of high resolution, but benefits from using ‘HiDPI’.\nThe bottom line, keep your screen at the high resolution you paid for, enjoy uniquely crisp and clear fonts.\nHere’s the outline:\n\n*\n\n*Enable the feature by setting the register using your terminal (sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool true)\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Change the display to ‘scaled” (same place you control resolution)\n\n*Depending on your system, you should see options for changing the font size, or HIDPI setting beside each resolution option.\n\nThe last step changes how many dots you want to use to draw a font.  For instance, if the norm is to use 12 x 12 dots to draw a character, the HiDPI feature will draw it using 24 x 24.  That means your nose can move away from the screen for two reasons: larger font and because you haven’t taken down your resolution, super crisp rendering of each letter.\n- E\nPS: I used the word “relatively”. Retina displays use about 220dpi (the iPhone is above 300 dpi, or PPI). The iPhone “magic” comes from the density more than the “resolution” per se. I have a 4K monitor. I chose the smallest monitor I could find with 4K. Yes, smallest. I wanted “crisp”; that meant I wanted the highest density of dots possible. My 27”, 4K monitor has a dpi 168 (or PPI).  A big, “crisp” improvement over 3440 x 1440 34” at about 100 dpi.\n\nA: If you use Apple's preferred scaling options, that will not decrease the fine-ness of fine lines.\nAdjusting the Retina scaling does not reduce the pixels of the screen display, it just uses more of them to display some items. But it can still draw a 1 pixel thin line at the 5K density.\nAlso, you mention that you don't want to wear reading glasses: have you run a diagnostic on the wetware?\n\nA: I went to the monitor I'm using and checked what input it is getting from the Mac after scaling down. It showed that I was still getting 4K resolution. So even if you choose the options that say lower resolution, the display resolution is not being changed.\n", "Q: Sudden reboot and install screen on login I just logged in to my MacBook Pro (2015) running Catalina.\nWhile entering my password my desktop background disappeared, leaving a white background.\nOn pressing enter, the machine suddenly rebooted.\nDuring the phase with the white loading bar and Apple logo on a black background the loading bar filled up (rather slowly) twice, and then showed an installation dialog:\n\nThe text says:\n\nInstalling on “Macintosh HD\n[loading bar]\n27 minutes remaining\n\nIt didn’t say what was being installed. It didn’t remotely take 27 minutes.\nAfter that it booted up again, with a very slow loading bar this time, slow enough for it to show a time estimate at around 8 minutes. I have to add that booting has always been lightning fast until today.\nJust I logged in normally again, all my files still seem to be there, even my Safari tabs were restored.\nI was hoping someone could tell me what happened (what was installed and why) and if there’s anything I should do or check now.\n\nA: The simple explanation is a macOS installer was in your Applications folder (or elsewhere) and was run. 30 minutes to install isn’t out of line - especially on a machine with a bit of history or third party apps.\n\nThe logical place where running an installer happens is when you enroll / allow automatic updates in System Preferences and then in the Notification Center where options like restart now or update later are presented.\nWhat next? Perhaps look in /var/log/install.log to see if you agree with the recent actions logged. Possibly boot to recovery and install a good clean download of the latest macOS on top of your install if you feel you can’t trace why the installer ran. Make a backup for sure, if your mac is compromised - an erase install and selective restore from backup might be needed. To me, there are very common reasons for this to happen and no particular signs you have any issues unless you can not determine why the installer ran via defaults or someone opening it manually.\n", "Q: Why did the USB connector for the aluminium Apple keyboard have gaps on the plug? I used to own an Apple USB keyboard - this was the metal version that had a USB port on each end. From memory, the USB cable that connected the keyboard to a computer had several gaps in the connector itself. Out of interest, why was this the case? I recall that a USB extension cable was also included with the keyboard - I wasn't sure if it could be related to this in any way.\n\nA: If you are referring to the groove in one of the sides of the USB plug on the end of any wired Apple keyboard, it was designed to mate with the included USB extension cable. This extension cable was constructed with a guide inside the female end which allowed only the insertion of the cable from the keyboard -- it could not be used as a general USB extension. The male end of the extension cable was without a groove, so stringing two extension cables together was not possible, either. Thanks, Apple. \nKeyboard USB connector:\n\nAnd yes, I need to clean the cruft from my keyboard. I've been WFH for many hours a day for a few months and there just isn't time.\n", "Q: How do I loop the last action in the Automator app? How do I loop the last action in the Automator app, instead of looping the entire workflow?\n\nA: Automator has a Loop action, which causes the first action in the workflow to be the next action executed; however, it does not have a Loop action to act only on the last action.\nAnother option, if applicable, is to use a Run AppleScript action or Run Shell Script action where you can code in some form of looping action.\nIf appropriate or applicable, you can add any given action more than once. Without knowing what your workflow looks like it's hard to advise.\n", "Q: Why does the Watch app on my iPhone state that my apps will need to be updated during setup when I already have the latest versions installed? When pairing an Apple Watch to my iPhone, I've noticed that even though the App Store lists all of my apps being up-to-date, the Watch app on my iPhone states that several of my iOS apps will be updated for compatibility before their watchOS counterparts will be sent over to my Watch. Is this a standard message that appears - even if all iOS apps on the paired iPhone are fully updated to the latest versions?\n\nA: WatchOS apps are a complex hybrid since they started as all being dependent upon iOS and now they can be independent or dependent. You need to get both sides synced in some cases, hence the message to update iOS when watchOS is in play with one or more paired watches.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/creating_independent_watchos_apps/\nTo be clear - some updates only apply if the watch component is required to be active or the developer ties them together when submitting their builds to Apple. This is all standard and you might even learn that some apps get different builds based on different hardware - not all apps are monolithic based on hardware versioning and software versioning. (Like an older watch that’s still supported but not the latest watchOS might get a different app than the latest watchOS gets).\n", "Q: Suppress \"Are you sure you want to delete...\" dialogue when deleting items on SMB shares When connected to an SMB share in Finder and deleting files or folders, this dialogue comes up: \n\nI believe that the reasoning behind this dialogue is because deleted files don't go to a Trash or .Trashes folder, and so I think it's a good dialogue to have for most users. But when managing a large number of files in SMB shares frequently it can become very tedious and time-consuming to keep having to confirm each deletion. Power users really only need to see this once (the first time they delete something).\nI am aware of the cmd+d keyboard shortcut for performing the delete function on this dialogue, which shaves off some time, but ultimately I'd like a way to suppress this dialogue completely. \nHow could I suppress these dialogues and make it so that when I delete something the \"Delete\" action is performed?\n\nA: You can use the Terminal command rm to bypass the Finder altogether and suppress the GUI notification.\nCheck out the available options by typing man rm.\n", "Q: Network problems with a MacMini 2018 I am experiencing weird network problems with a MacMini 2018.\nAt my home, I am connected through Wifi: No Problem.\nIn a different house, I try to connect via Wifi, \"impossible to connect\".

I have deleted the \"Wifi\"  entry in the parameter > network setting. Then I have recreated it, it may have helped, but I can't be sure.\n\nA: I finally found the culprit. It was due to the Anker USB hub I connect to the Mac Mini. As soon as I connect it, the Wifi stops working. Check out the issue on the Apple forum.\n\nConnecting the hub to the back of the Mac mini killed all wifi connection immediately. Reading online I found what I thought would be a good solution. Turns out a USB extension cord might help. Create some distance between the Mac and the hub. \n\nThat's crazy!\n", "Q: How do I browse files in my `.backupbundle` backup?

I tried many things online but I am unable to edit any of the files.\nI have tried following instructions here: https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/getting-started-guide/accessing-your-account/keeping-ssh-connections-alive\nPerhaps the problem is that I dont have a ~/.ssh/config file - changes I try to make to the below given files, I keep getting this:\n\n\n*\n\n*-- INSERT -- W10: Warning: Changing a readonly file\n\n*E45: 'readonly' option is set (add ! to override)\n\n*\"sshd_config\" E212: Can't open file for writing\n\n\nWhen I try to create it (copy and paste the command you use here), it says this:\nmkdir: .ssh: Permission denied\nI am happy to answer any further questions you may have :)\nThis is what my /etc/ssh looks like:\n\nThis is what ssh_config looks like:\n\nand this is what my sshd_config looks like:\n\nIs there a better guide to creating my ssh config so I can have my client ssh keep alive the connection to the server?\n\nA: Catalina is same as all the older OS X and macOS for this. For you, it seems the hidden ssh folder is what’s stopping your attempt to configure the file. My commands make the directory and then clobber any file you may have so don’t use the cat > and expect to keep old file contents. You can then edit the file once it’s set.\nmkdir -p ~/.ssh\ncat > ~/.ssh/config << EOF\nHost keepsdroppingme.com\nServerAliveInterval 120\nEOF\n\nOf course you need to put the host you care about having the 120 second keep alive traffic being synthetically generated whether you’re typing or not.

Instead it specifically says the eGPU does not work on Bootcamp (not on Windows, but on Bootcamp). So I am thinking installing Windows on a partition myself, with another boot loader rather than bootcamp, might help.\nI have found How to install Windows 10 into a 2013 iMac without using the Boot Camp Assistant, USB flash drive or third party tools? but the solution there is for a block size of 512.

I want to transfer those images into three different folders in such a way that five thousand images go into two different folders each and remaining 3 thousand go into the third folder.\nAfter searching for a while, I used the following command to transfer first 5000 images but it didn't work. Here are my steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*I went into the source folder that contains the images\n\n*Used this command to copy the images cp  head -5000 ../Paras_valid, but it did not work.\nCould anyone help me how to copy the multiple files into different folders?\n\nA: This is more difficult than it may seem.

You can just select the first 5000 files and and create a shell script that runs from 1 to 5000 and run it from the new empty folder. The command that sets run 5000 times is, from the new directory, \"cp ../old_folder_name/files_name_inum *\".This will copy files *_00001 to *_05000 to you first new directory. Then make a 2nd directory and have you script run from *_05001 to *_10000 and finally run a third time to get the files 10001 to 13000. \nThe actual unix shell script is the following\nfor i in {0001..5000}\ndo\n   cp ../old_imager_files/image_files_$i target1/\ndone\n\n", "Q: Catalina Dynamic Wallpaper doesn't change with the time of the day Both Apple stock dynamic wallpapers aren't changing accordingly to the time of the day.

Within the script, run a check to see if sunrise has recently occurred. If so, perform the iTunes script.\nYour script needs to determine how long ago sunrise occurred. If the time since sunrise is short enough, run the script. Short enough might be five minutes ago; it is unlikely a Mac is restarted within five minutes of powering on.\nPowering on a Mac can take seconds to minutes. Checking the time since sunrise also helps compensate for this unknown delay.\nHow Power Manager solves this problem\nIn Power Manager, which can both power on your Mac at sunrise and run the script, we divide this type of problem into two sections: the trigger and the action.\nThe trigger schedules the Mac to power on at sunrise. For that, we calculate sunrise time locally and enqueue an IOPMQueue event. This is similar to your web site query and pmset call.\nThe action performs the script. In this case, Power Manager would check at each power on event to see if the expected sunrise had recently occurred. If so, the script would be run. Within Power Manager, this sensitivity is called drift.\n", "Q: Booting Ubuntu (or any other Linux) from MacBook Pro 2020 As a new user in the world of Apple computers and laptops, I am trying to understand better why it is a pain in the ass to boot a flavor of Linux using an Apple MacBook.

Is it a problem of not having drivers or packages or is the problem different.\nMy question is twofold:\nIf it's possible, what drivers or packages am I missing?\nIf it is not possible, why exactly?\n\nA: There is a Ubuntu Live USB distribution called LivelyLinux that boots from Mac. It costs $29.99 and is available in two editions: Ubuntu 20.10 and Ubuntu 20.04.1.\nIt works on Macbook Pro 2016 with WiFi, touchpad, etc. Probably should work on later models as well.\n", "Q: Would an Apple Watch charge any quicker if connected to a 12W USB power adapter? I understand that all Apple Watch models ship with a 5W USB power adapter in the box, but I'm curious as to whether the Watch would charge quicker if paired with a 12W power adapter. Is there any official information anywhere that outlines the maximum wattage that an Apple Watch can take?\n\nA: No.  There is no quick charging feature on any of the Apple watches.\nAs far as documentation goes, Apple rarely documents what it can’t do; so you’re not going to find anything official.  \nHowever, with a little bit of research, we can posit as to why Apple’s watch is limited to 5W: physics.  The Apple watch uses an inductive (wireless) charger that’s held in place with magnets and connected via USB (5VDC).  The thing with inductive chargers is that the receiver coils’ (in the watch) power capacity is determined by the gauge of the wire and the number of “turns” which influences the size if said coil. \nIn the Texas Instruments paper Designing a Qi-compliant receiver coil for wireless power systems it states that a coil with 5V output at 5W would require a coil with dimensions of 48mm x 32mm with 15 turns (page 4).  Needless to say, thats much larger than the actual watch itself.  The coil in the watch is obviously much smaller with finer gauge wire meaning lower power output.  5W is the smallest USB power adapter they make, so they simply include it rather than create another power adapter specific to the watch (IMO).\nThis is confirmed with this YouTube video testing both the 5W and 12W chargers.  The charging speed is identical for both meaning the watch won’t “quick charge” with the 12W adapter.  Likewise it continues to show that you can use any USB charger so long as it’s greater than or equal the the power requirements of the device.  You can use a 91W USB-C charger for your watch with no issues (but you shouldn’t the other way around)\n", "Q: Compress file as .tar.gz instead of .zip If I right click a file and I compress it I obtain a file.zip.

In fact, binding brings a whole host of issues, one of which is lack of clarity at which problem you are chasing down.\nTo test and validate Kerberos tickets and transactions are operational at the command line use kinit and klist (both of which have quite adequate manual pages that describe the detaults. You will want to point kinit at your service principal with the -S or --service argument the first time you initialize Kerberos.)\nPerhaps I don’t fully understand what you are trying to accomplish - if so, please comment and/or ask a follow on question with those details. We’re using this to great benefit at work and haven’t needed to bind any macs and have ripped out the binding on all but a few that need to share out files as servers and they don’t need kinit or klist - just to be bound properly one time.\n", "Q: Unable to open Mail in macOS Catalina On a MacBook Pro running macOS Catalina Version 10.15.5, every time I try to open Mail.app in one of our user's acounts, the application fails to open and I get this error:\n\nMail quit unexpectedly.\nClick Reopen to open the application again.

I'm trying to connect it to an external monitor via a Caldigit USB-C Pro dock and a 6ft DisplayPort <-> DisplayPort cable. When I connect the cable to the external monitor the laptop freezes for about 10-20 seconds, then the display updates momentarily, then freezes for another 10-20 seconds, then updates, and so on. The external monitor says it's not getting a signal. If I unplug the DisplayPort cable (either at the dock or at the monitor) then the laptop goes back to normal after a few seconds.\nWhat can I do to diagnose this issue further? I've tried running Activity Monitor and I don't see any noticeable spikes in resource utilization. \nI thought maybe the issue was with the cable - perhaps I need an \"active\" cable rather than a \"passive\" - but the Caldigit documentation only says that's necessary for an adapter (i.e. DisplayPort to HDMI).\n\nA: The dock has two DisplayPort ports, which are not present in the USB-C cable, so the hub must have some extra hardware providing this.\nThis may require drivers.  I have a Thinkpad USB-C dock home from work these days (corona) which require a DisplayLink driver installed on my Mac to provide video output from the dock.  It might be something similar here.\nI would suggest reconsidering your Hub choice.  A simple solution may be the USB-C Digital AV Multiport-adapter (https://www.apple.com/dk/shop/product/MUF82ZM).\n\nA: The dock you have chosen should work perfectly well with your computer.\nContrary to what the other answer given states, the dock is actually a Thunderbolt 3 AND a USB-C dock. As long as you use an appropriate Thunderbolt 3 cable (like the one that comes with the dock), it will use a full Thunderbolt 3 signal to communicate with your computer - not USB-C.\nThis means that two DisplayPort outputs is fully possible without using DisplayLink or anything like that.\nIn terms of diagnosing the problem you have, I would suggest starting with a new DisplayPort cable. An issue like the one you describe can come from a defective cable. Remember if you use any type of adapter cable (like for converting to HDMI), it must an active adapter - not a passive one.\nIf replacing the DisplayPort cable does not work, I would try it with a different monitor.\n", "Q: How to get (logical) screen size from a shell script? Using system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType, I can retrieve the size of a Mac's display in pixels.\nHowever, the command\ntell application \"System Events\" to get the size of every window of every process\n\n(which I execute from my bash script using osascript) apparently does NOT return window sizes in pixels.

I guess utun2 is my VPN connection.\nFor any IP address destination that is not in the routing table, which default route would be selected? Is it a random selection? Or is there some other table or something else that I could inspect to figure that out?\nThis machine is on macOS Mojave version 10.14.5\n\nA: macOS chooses which of those default routes to use based on the service order. You can set the order by opening System Preferences, select Network and then click the gear icon below the interface list to select Set Service Order. Drag and drop the interfaces to prioritize.\nAs you're working with the Terminal, this information is also available there by running:\nnetworksetup -listnetworkserviceorder\n\nThis will show you the prioritized list. You can change the order by running:\nnetworksetup -ordernetworkservices <service1> <service2> <...>\n\nNote that this determines the route chosen only for connections initiated from your computer. If a connection is initiated by another device, the interface that it is initiated from will be used for that connection.\nI.e. for example you have both an Ethernet and WiFi connection to another computer. You could set your service order so that you prefer connections to be made over WiFi. But if the other computer initiates the connection over Ethernet, then packets you send later on that connection will be sent over Ethernet.\n", "Q: YouTube video quality list not showing 720p or higher resolution on iPhone XS Max I recently switched from Android to iOS.\nI have installed an YouTube app from App Store on my new iPhone XS Max.\nNow, when I'm playing any video on YouTube, the default max resolution quality is showing as 480p in video quality settings of the YouTube.\nTherefore, I'm not able to watch the higher resolution videos in higher resolution.\nQuestion :\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any extra setting that I have to make in iOS 13 to enable watching videos at higher resolution as I'm not finding it anywhere ?\n\n\nA: I'm guessing you are using Youtube App from India. \nKeeping in mind the increased load during the lockdown, they have capped the maximum quality of streaming at 480p. \nYou can check out this link for further confirmation.\nThe workaround to resolve this issue is by using VPN.\n", "Q: Can't browse internet from browser after connecting to VPN.

MacOS is unable to read their SMART status either with diskutil\n$ diskutil info disk2 | grep SMART\n   SMART Status:              Not Supported\n\nor with smartmontools (installed with brew):\n$ smartctl -a disk2s2\nsmartctl 7.1 2019-12-30 r5022 [Darwin 18.7.0 x86_64] (local build)\nCopyright (C) 2002-19, Bruce Allen, Christian Franke, www.smartmontools.org\n\nSmartctl open device: disk2s2 failed: Operation not supported by device\n\nHOWEVER, a FreeNAS box correctly reads SMART from both USB drives. Indeed one of them is failing with a large number of Failed SMART usage Attribute: 184 End-to-End_Error errors. Error 184 signals possible corruption on the drive with likely imminent failure. It means \"get anything you care about off ASAP and discard the drive\". macOS provided no warnings.\nDoes macOS have any sort of monitoring of drive health? If so, what is it and how does it work? If not, can it be added both for internal and external drives? Is there a technology other than SMART?\n\nA: \nMy 2017 15\" MacBook Pro does not appear to support S.M.A.R.T. on any drive.\n\nNot exactly.  It’s more like NVMe is not compatible with S.M.A.R.T.  First off, it is a subset of the ATA (AT Attachment) standard for monitoring/reporting and repairing drive failures.  There are a number of ATA commands that access the SMART attributes.\nTo be able to gain access to the SMART attributes on the drive, you need the following:\n\n*\n\n*supported OS driver\n\n*supported hardware interface.\n\nDrivers\nmacOS provides a limited and closed ATA driver.  It does not allow you to send SCSI and ATA commands directly to the device (drive).  In this case the macOS driver allows you to get some but not all of the SMART attributes.  To do so, you need a 3rd party driver that supports getting these extended attributes.  DriveDx has this driver.\nSupported Hardware\nAs for a supported hardware interface this could be either the SATA controller (actually PCIe to SATA bridge) or the SATA controller in a USB interface (USB to SATA bridge).  If the SATA controller doesn’t support sending/reading these commands/attributes, you won’t be able to get the SMART information you’re looking for.\nHowever, given that a different machine (FreeNAS box) the included ATA/SCSI driver as well as the USB to SATA bridge supported the SMART attributes.\nSmartmontools has an excellent summary page detailing the USB/SMART attribute support:  https://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/USB\n\n\nThe ​OS X SAT SMART Driver provides access to SMART data for SAT, JMicron and Sunplus capable USB and Firewire devices on Mac OS X. On OSX El Capitan (10.11+) you may need a signed driver, which can be downloaded from the ​DriveDx website. Note that this does not support 48-bit ATA commands (-l xerror) or non-SMART ATA commands (-s apm,N). Full USB support would require SCSI pass-through support which does not yet exist on Mac OS X.\n\nIf you notice, macOS doesn’t support the SCSI pass through nor does smartmontools support SCSI.  However, you can get USB SMART attributes through the use of a signed driver from DriveDX.\nNVMe\nNVMe is a whole different ball of wax.  Looking at the specification, there’s nothing about SMART attributes.  In fact, it has it’s own definition for Error Reporting and Recovery.  So, asking an NVMe drive for attributes it doesn’t even have is obviously not going to work.\nsmartmontools NVMe support is currently in the “experimental” stage.  Once again, support is limited due to driver limitations.  After 10.13 (High Sierra), a 3rd party driver is required\n\nBefore release 10.13 only Apple-branded NVMe devices were supported, monitoring API is implemented (NVMeSMARTClient) but not documented. Limited NVMe support added in the ​DriveDx app (commercial, closed source) and in the smartmontools since 6.6 (r4438).\n\nBottom Line\nIf you’re looking for drive health monitoring, you’ll need 3rd party tools as it hasn’t been implemented in macOS as of yet.\n\nA: Open About This Mac user the Apple Menu. Click on the  System Report button. About half way down the page, under Hardware, click on SATA/SATA Express. Click on each disk reported at the top of the 2nd column and look for S.M.A.R.T. Status and see if its listed.  \n\nA: USB external drive enclosures do not support SMART with macOS. So that is most likely the issue there.\nAs for internal drives, I know the internal disks of the 2017 MacBook Pro are NVMe and do support SMART.  However, macOS did not support SMART with NVMe until macOS 10.10.3+ and even then it only supported some Apple branded NVMe devices until 10.13 High Sierra. So, pre-10.13 storage upgrades could cause issues with SMART reporting.\nSmartmontools did not fully support NVMe until 6.6+ and it uses macOS's native support. There are some notes here and here.\nSo try updating macOS to gain native support.\n", "Q: How can I extract audio files from an app? Is there any way I can extract audio files from an iOS app?

Part of battery service is that they can inspect for other damage and re-quote you if you need something other than a battery.\nYou didn’t mention if your device was stable enough to run the battery diagnosis from Apple Support. If that ran, I’d be even more sure they know what they are talking about and the chance they’re wrong grows less.\nYour symptom of battery charge level varying more than 10% in any 300 second period is very clearly a faulty circuit or faulty battery. There really aren’t other options. The diagnostic will show full charge capacity, so you can calculate the max current draw divided by the capacity if you’re skeptical Apple’s diagnosis makes sense.\nLet’s talk about water instead of charge for a moment. If my math is correct a FINA competition pool is 2,500 m^3 so let’s assume your battery has exactly that much mAH. Figure the size of the pipe to drain the pool when it’s new. Now a few years later, it can’t go from 80% full to 20% full in 5 minutes. If you measure that sudden drop in water level, the pool either has a massive leak or your measuring device is massively off. There’s no other option that’s reasonable.\nThe circuitry defines the measurement in iPhone battery, the hardware defines the max charge and max draw. The battery either works as expected or has faulty chemistry / circuitry and behaves out of bounds. That’s the main reason why a battery that’s not used up gets asked to be swapped and also why the diagnostics can point to the correct next step.\n", "Q: Why does a MacBook throttle without a battery? According to this posted answer, a MacBook Pro will throttle because otherwise its power consumption might exceed the amount supplied by the AC adapter. \nHowever, from my experience, my 2012 MacBook Pro has never gone over perhaps 50W of energy usage, as shown with iStat Menus. My power adapter is an 85W MagSafe adaptor. Because of this, it seems like even without throttling the power consumption never would exceed the amount used. \nSo why would this MacBook throttle if I took out the battery, as suggested by the answer above, even though the power adapter can supply enough power to sustain peak performance? \n\nA: The CPU and GPU can draw more power than the AC adapter can provide as the battery serves as a capacitor and reserve. It smoothes out the voltage when a surge is needed. If the system over draws, voltage drops a little and subtle computing errors happen. If the voltage drops too far, the system shuts down entirely and abruptly.\nTo be reliable and fast, the battery is needed and the system slows down to preserve the correctness of the function. This is a very well tested design, so it’s not an accident that this happens and it’s not for some small reason. This can be measured with oscilloscopes and quantified precisely. \nAll the measurements you are doing are time averaged. You’ll want to look at millisecond to second level time scales to see this voltage compensation happen.\nApple engineers work from Intel specs on voltage drop curves and tolerances to meet the needs of the power handling on the Intel side as well as manage the battery and charging circuitry and also build in tolerances for aging gear and adapters.\n", "Q: Issues with AppleScript scripting Mail I'm having some problems.  Googling them I found this:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/8022877\nI'm having almost identical problems.  \ntell application \"Mail\" to make new account ...\n\n...appears to succeed from the perspective of the script or Script Editor - if I query Mail with:\nget every imap account\n\nthe new account is returned there - however, it doesn't appear in Mail's Preferences under the Accounts tab, it doesn't appear in Internet Accounts, and if I restart my Mac and query Mail again for every imap account, it is no longer returned.\n--\nThe other issue I'm having (closely related): I'm able to change some of the properties of an account, but having issues with two of them. (for these code snippets, theAccount has been set to a valid imap account in Mail):\n1 enabled property\ntell theAccount to set enabled to true\n\nor \nget enabled of theAccount\n\n...gives me \"Apple event failed\" error.  If I substitute any other readable imap account property in place of \"enabled\" (eg. name, user name, port, uses ssl, etc.) it returns the appropriate value.  But anything I try to do with that property (get it or set it) gives me that error.  Huh...?? Why that one and only that one?\n2 authentication property: \ntell theAccount to set authenticaion to password\n\n...gives \"Can’t make password of account [...] into type constant\".  That value (password) is one of a number of constants in the dictionary for the Authentication enumeration.  I'm confident I have the syntax correct (in principle) because if I substitute password in the above code with any of the other constants in that enumeration (kerberos 5, md5, none, etc.) it works fine.  Only password gives that error.\nScript Editor/AppleScript seems to believe I'm referring to the password property of theAccount, and that makes sense, so the question is how do I use that password enumeration constant? How do I tell Mail that I want to set theAccount's authentication property to that password enumeration constant (and not the password property)?\nAnyone have any idea what I am, (or Apple is -- bug?), doing wrong here?\nThanks in advance!\n\nUPDATE the next day:\nIn hindsight, I should have posted this as two separate questions.\n@CJK's answer solves the second one. His/her answer also suggests an answer to my first one as well (ie. it's just an Apple bug) though others may still have insight on that.\nI'll mark @CJK's answer as correct on this post, but if anyone else has any answers to the first issue, please comment.  I'll post that issue as a separate post/question, you can then answer there and I'll mark that up and as correct on that post.\n\nA: This is more of an extended comment rather than an answer, but comments can only contain inline code and not fenced code blocks.\nI'm unable to offer insight regarding your first issue, as I am not using Apple Mail at present, but is probably a bug as I'm aware other users have reported that set the enabled of every account to false doesn't work, and that seems relevant to your situation.  The second issue is most likely a bug as well, but possibly one that can be worked around, given that the other enumeration constants you listed are still working.\nTo illustrate a test case, you can try and execute this line of code:\nreturn \"axmd\" as constant\n\nand you should get back the md5 constant used by Mail.  This doesn't need to be inside a tell app \"Mail\" block, but it can be and may make more sense to place it inside one in your final script when using the password enumeration code.  The enumeration code for password is \"axct\", and hopefully when you execute this line of (test) code:\nreturn \"axct\" as constant\n\nyou'll get back the password constant.  Probably the best way to make use of this in your script is to do so something like this:\ntell application id \"com.apple.mail\"\n    set axct to \"axct\" as constant\n                .\n                .\n    # Other bits of your code including where\n    # you define \"theAccount\", which should be\n    # variable containing a reference to an\n    # object with class 'account'\n                .\n                .\n    set the authentication of theAccount to axct\n                .\n                .\n    # Rest of your Mail-specific code\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Can someone else see my messages on his device? Something strange happened today. I got lots of messages via iMessage obviously not intended for me. Short story, what’s happened is when I got my iPhone on a new network I transferred my old number. Except I didn’t realise I had to do this manually on the phone itself which was happily using the number the handset came with for iMessage and FaceTime. \nSo it turns out the network must have reallocated my number and now I’m getting all of this person’s messages. I’ve now changed my number on my iPhone and checked that iMessage and FaceTime are linked to my actual number. My question is whether this other person can see my old messages via iMessage on his new phone (as they were sent to what is now his number)?\n\nA: You’re mixing up two different thing all happening on the back end of the messaging servers.\nYou receiving someone else’s messages doesn’t mean you can read their’s.  You don’t know who got you old number and you don’t know who’s old number you got.  The probability that the two of you just happened to swap phone numbers is highly, highly unlikely.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible that someone saw some of your messages prior to changing the number in iMessage?  Yes.  You don’t know who sent you messages intended for you to your old number.\n\n*the messages you got when you changed your number were likely queued up SMS messages that couldn’t be delivered until your number was activated.\n\n*is someone possibly seeing SMS messages sent to you at your old number?  Yes.  Apple has no control over SMS messages and has no idea if the sender meant to send it to you or the new owner.\nChanging phone numbers is not a normal, everyday process.  Just control the variables you can control and ensure your account information where your phone number is relevant is accurate.  As far as someone having access to see all or even past messages, no, that’s not possible.  Unless they have your iCloud account and can log into it, they can’t access anything.  \n\nA: Every Apple ID contains a list of phone numbers and email addresses that are linked to it. There is also a list of devices that are linked to the Apple ID, with encryption keys for each device.\nWhen a \"blue bubble\" message is sent to a phone number, it checks for an Apple ID linked to that number, and then checks for encryption keys for each of the devices, and separately encrypts the message for each device.\nOnly the device it was encrypted for can read a \"blue bubble\" message. And Apple should be notifying you if a new device is added to your iCloud account (you can also log into appleid.com and check for your list of devices).\nWhen a \"green bubble\" message is sent, which will automatically happen if a blue bubble fails, then all bets are off. The device can be read by anyone. There is some security, but it's not very good at all. And it also could be broken depending on how good your carrier is. The fact they've passed your phone number on to someone else without leaving it dormant for a very long time suggests they really don't care about this kind of problem.\nIf it was me, I'd be calling Apple and asking them to double check the old phone number isn't linked to my Apple ID. I'm not sure exactly when they deregister it, but it sounds like they haven't for you yet.\n", "Q: How best to reintroduce files after clean MacOS install I'm having seriously annoying issues with my new MBP.

I will be putting minimal files back onto the laptop, but there are some I simply have to bring across.\nIs Migration Assistant the best? Or backup to Dropbox / Drive etc and download after formatting?\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: \n\"I've created a new, test account to see if the same crashing appears -\n  it doesn't. So I am going to do a clean MacOS install.\"\n\nIf a new user account works fine, then there is nothing wrong with the system installation, and a clean OS install is unnecessary. \nThe problem is something in your original user account.\nEither migrate to the new user account, or go back to the old account and find the problem in your user Library. It may be a Login Item or Launch Agent that is loading an unstable or incompatible process; corrupt caches or incorrect settings in preference files.\nTest by removing files from your user Library, (restart/relogin if necessary), then check whether the problem remains. If it is fixed, put back half the files you removed, and test again. If not, remove the remaining half.\nFor your specific problem, you may want to remove things relating to CUPS, the printing process, Adobe CC or Preview. Anything in <user>/Library/Application Support/Adobe can be entirely removed: the apps will just revert to their default settings.\nAnything named Adobe in <user>/Library/Preferences is also fair game, and the same for things with cups or print. \nThe same for <user>/Library/Caches. \nThe thing about migrating to a new user account is that it fixes the problem but doesn't solve it, and if it happens again, you'll have to move to a third new account, and so on. \n\nA: What’s “best” is up for you to decide.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Migration assistant can allow you to be “selective” but will it be granular enough for you?

It doesnt show up when I linit to an external monitor..\nThank you for your time..\nMacbook Pro 2009 4 gb ram\nS\n\nA: If you have another mac, donwload High Sierra, which is the newest version compatible with 2009 iMacs, create a bootable disk and follow Apple's instructions on how to reinstall macOS.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208969\n\nA: Most older Macs didn't come with Recovery Mode partitions (as these can take up a fair bit of space), and instead came with optical disc or USB reinstallation medias for MacBook Airs without DVD drives. I think, later on, when people stopped being used to storing physical media and probably kept running into \"I need to install OS X but I lost/sold/threw away all those DVDs,\" that's when Apple started including an internal Recovery Mode (Command-R) and an internet-available Internet Recovery Mode (Command-Option-R). \nIf you updated to a newer version of OS X, it would have likely installed this recovery partition. I had a 2008 MacBook (Polycarbonate) with OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard. That's when I learned Recovery Mode didn't exist once upon a time. When I got a 10.7.3 Lion DVD off Amazon, it installed a Recovery Mode partition, and Command-R magically started working. (Internet Recovery Mode didn't, I imagine this is more built into the machine itself, like the EFI or ROM, than into the OS X installation.)\nApple also started including these partitions by default when they shipped machines without discs. However, since your machine is from a time where discs were still standard, and you've never installed a newer version by the sounds of it, this partition is still missing and it is still assuming you've got Ye OS X Install DVD of Olde. \nYou're probably going to have to download an old OS X installer and jump through a few extra hoops, since 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) is the latest version that even a version as old as El Capitan supports installing on top of. I would suggest OS X Mountain Lion, as I've found old DMGs that still work, and it's within the same time period of Leopard. Install that, then you can install OS X El Capitan (official) on top of that by launching the PKG that downloads from that Apple page. \nEl Capitan needs components within your existing installation to install on top of, or it can't work. This is why an intermediary version (like Mountain Lion as suggested here) is needed. It adds a while to the install time, and it's annoying to have to jump through these extra steps, but it's needed nonetheless.\nYou can Google around for a copy of OS X Mountain Lion that you can download, or you can ask a friend who purchased Snow Leopard, Lion or Mountain Lion from the Mac App Store as they would be able to download it still, from their Purchased tab. Just set the UNIX time code back before you start the installation, as the original certificate has long expired. \nHere's a Google Search string to get you started (paste into search bar):\n\"OS X\" install download \"DMG\"\n", "Q: What's the safest way to ship diskettes? I would like to have some original software shipped to me but I am afraid that it might become damaged in shipping.\nThe software are the original boot disks and disk tools that came with my first Mac SE and some miscellaneous original goodies. They are ~25 year old 400K low coercivity diskettes which is the reason for my concern. I don't know the strength of the remaining data and don't want it destroyed by security scans as it crosses national borders.\nI am afraid of the possibility of magnetic fields further demagnetizing the already weak data on the disk. I have no idea how to recover the data if it is lost. I don't have 400k drives to recreate the disks.\nI want to be able to use them on the elderly computer. They were matched for the first release of the model, became lost in a move long ago, and recently relocated.\nHow best to protect my treasures in transit. What precautions should I ask the borrower to take for returning my original diskettes to me?\nUpdate: The disks are 3.25\" (beige plastic hard shell case) 400K disks with no second notch (that indicate a high density, high coercivity diskette). The 400K drives do not recognize the 800K disks I have tried in the drive. It wants its boot disks to access the internal 10 MB disk. :(\n\nA: Any time I shipped magnetic media, I used the anti-static bags that electronic components came in.  Granted, when you have access to an IT department, they are easily available; we would save them for reuse.  I still do, but my stash isn’t as plentiful as it used to be.\n\nHowever, you can get reusable zip poly anti static pouches.  They will provide shielding from low level EM fields and are transparent enough that if your package is opened for inspection, the contents are easily identifiable.  I’ve never had any issue with data loss using this method whether shipping in-country or internationally.\nYou didn’t mention which format the diskettes were; if they were 3.5”  or 5.25” or even the large IBM 8” but typically you could copy the disks so long as the drive was capable of writing it.  For instance, the 3.5” 1.44MB FDD drive could easily handle the 720K disks.  We had a “copyboard” in an IBM AT that would duplicate anything including copy protected disks for Apple.  It didn’t even matter if the OS could read it so long as the drive could.  \nAlong that note, I just recently ran across some Gateway 2000 MS-DOS 6.22 setup disks in a storage box that weren’t exactly put away with the greatest of care (about 25 years old).  I was able to image them and install MS-DOS onto a Virtual Box VM with no issue.  I’d bet your disks are still readable.  If at all possible, I’d make an image for safe keeping (I can walk you through it, but it’s technically a different question).  Oh, and those DOS disks were imaged using a Mac!\n\nA: Well-wrapped packaging with a bit of insulation is as good as you are going to get. Anything more elaborate (Faraday cage?) is liable to attract attention of customs agents, who may then take them apart. I agree that marking them with \"Magnetic media\" would be a good idea.\nHowever, I would add that once you get them back, I would certainly keep them on the shelf, and use newer disk copies. There are also archive websites for vintage computing where you can download the actual data. (Assuming your 30-year-old SCSI hard drive is still working too!)\n\nA: Allan’s answer is really good but a free option, if you have them, is to use the packing that you get when you buy hard drives. I bought hard drives from ebay that came in a pink electronics bag. If they are good enough for hard drives they should be good for floppy disks.\nAlso, I bought cables from Amazon that had those silver bags. Finally, I was curious if I could get free bags, so I asked the the Geek Squad guy if they had any left over bags from hard drives and he said yes and gave me two free bags!  So, I say just ask and you might get lucky - the worst that they can do is say no!\nHope that helps!\n\nA: Actually, any electrically conducting wrapping that completely covers your diskettes, \"Faraday Cage\" in which no electric or magnetic fields can penetrate.\nFor that - Double-wrap your diskettes with aluminium-foil, making sure there is no hole in the wrapping, and it will do the job just fine, protecting your diskettes from electric and magnetic fields.\n", "Q: How to use Jar Launcher with specified jdk version Now I have multiple jdk installed on OSX as shown below:\n└─[1] <> /usr/libexec/java_home -V\nMatching Java Virtual Machines (2):\n    14.0.1, x86_64: \"Java SE 14.0.1\"    /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-14.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home\n    1.8.0_241, x86_64:  \"Java SE 8\" /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_241.jdk/Contents/Home\n\n/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-14.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home\n\nThen I want to double click to run a jar file directly, for instance this:\n\nHowever, it warns me that this jar file is launched with JDK 14 but I want to launch it with JDK 1.8. \nA solution is that run it in terminal with \"java -jar\" in specified jdk path,but clearly it is not elegant.\nThe best way is to let \"Jar Launcher\" use specified jdk version ,but I don't know how.\n \n\nA: After long time efforts,I finally find the solution,that is ,to make your own Jar Launcher app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator to make Automator Quick Action\n\n\n*Select Application\n\n*Look for the Run Shell Script action with Filter Finder Items  and add it to \nthe right.\n\n*paste scripts here like this below:\n\nI make some changes to make it better\nexport JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8`\ncd \"$(dirname \"$@\")\" \njava -jar \"$@\" \n\n\n\n*save this quick action as an app for example \"open jar.app\"\n\n*go to  /System/Library/CoreServices/Jar Launcher.app/Contents/Resources\nand copy JarLauncher.icns\n\n\n*cd to \"open jar.app\" you just made and paste JarLauncher.icns to \n\"open jar.app/Contents/Resources\"\n\n*edit  \"open jar.app/Contents/Info.plist\" and change key(AutomatorApplet to JarLauncher.icns):\n\n\n    <key>CFBundleIconFile</key>\n    <string>JarLauncher.icns</string>\n\n\n\n\n*now you can choose to open with \"open jar.app\" just like before.\n\n", "Q: Where are the memory and kernel logs stored in macOS Catalina? I want to learn how to debug kernel crashes and am not at all familiar with macOS logging.

Your logs may vary. (If you don't know where Console is, simply search for it in Spotlight.)\n\nApple has a unified log system now, so you don’t want to just look at files like traditional unix logging. The log stats command will parse all available logs and let you know the current volume of information, how long it lives before being discarded, what severity of messages are so you can craft log show commands to dump specific entries of interest. Major events like a kernel panic do drop structured text files with details, but the logs are the best source.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/debugging\nFor an intro to kernel debugging Apple does a great job.

It looks like this functionality is not allowed with the latest ad blockers in the extension gallery (please correct me if I am wrong). So far I have tried Ghostery Lite, Adblock, Ka-Block, UBlock, 1Block, etc.\nI am curious if this could be done with a custom extension that I only use locally:\n\n\n*\n\n*keep a list of unwanted HTML elements per site\n\n*remove elements on site visit\n\n\nBefore I spend hours on this, is this doable?\nMac OS X: 10.15.5\nSafari: 13.1.1\n\nA: Adguard for Mac avoids the restrictions placed on browser extensions. It intercepts http(s) connections from all apps (not just Safari) and applies its blocking rules.\nAs well as using blocklists linked to Adguard, you can create your own. So invent your own rules - limited only by your imagination!\nAnd if you need a little help there is an active forum which includes a section for Custom Filters.\n\nA: \nBefore I spend hours on this, is this doable?\n\nYes.  However, it would be a spectacular time suck trying continually maintain it.\nA better (and my preferred) option is to do something at the network level and use pfBlockerNG or piHole.  I personally use pfBlockerNG because I’m a big proponent of pfSense firewall routers (as well as FreeBSD).  pf is also the default firewall found on macOS.  Though, I’ve never tried running pfBlocker on macOS.\nPiHole is a really interesting product in that it’s small enough to run on a Raspberry Pi or various other Linux distros.  While I’ve done some preliminary experiments with it, I opted for pfBlockerNG because I’m a BSD guy and not much of a Linux fan.  However, YMMV.\nWhat do these things do?\nBlock elements at the network level based on a community supported blacklist.  A more up-to-date and thorough list is available via subscription.  So depending on your needs and risk tolerance, it could be a free solution.  For instance, I use the community version for home and the subscription model for work and for my clients.\nBetter than Browser Plugins\n(IMO) these are much better than browser plugins. Since they operate at the network layer and will protect your whole network rather than just a single browser.  Additionally, there's no overhead you CPU needs yo deal with, even if it is negligible.\nHowever, most important for me is the privacy aspect where plugins ask for access to things like your location, your browsing history and even your contacts.  “Free” usually has a cost associated with it and it’s usually your privacy.\nPiHole and pfBlockerNG use a different model, called “freemium.”   The product is available for free, but premium services (like support or real-time black list updates) are available for a fee.\nOne of the benefits of using this approach was finding and blocking advertising domains things like my SmartTV (Samsung and LG)or internet connected radio (Sonus) were communicating with.  You can’t address that with a browser plugin!\nFinally, blocking these elements at the network level will free up quite a chunk of bandwidth you didn’t even realize was being consumed by advertising domains and trackers.\n\nA: Yes, this is doable using SafariServices in a custom app. You could create a app which loads specific things you want to disable (for example, a list of domains or CSS selectors) and lets Safari know when that list is updated. You would then have to transform your list into something the Content Blocker Extension can parse and tell Safari to refresh its content blocking list. You could use this locally without having to sign it/submit it to the App Store.\n\nA: Switch to Firefox and use uBlock Origin.\nThat is the short - in your face - answer. Hereafter, my reasoning and a more detailed answer to your question.\nuBlock origin is a wide-spectrum blocker and provides exactly the functionality you need. It is not commercialized, maintained by the community and free to use. Beware that uBlock is something different than uBlock Origin (use the provided link above). In my opinion it is the best content- (and ad-) blocker available.\nuBlock Origin for Safari used to be a thing as well, but since Safari 12 content blockers don't work as reliable in Safari anymore. Reasons for the change in Safari were discussed here, and this is also why other ad-blockers don't work as reliable in Safari anymore. This is likely not going to change in the near future. Therefore uBlock Origin for Safari was discontinued, and is no longer a viable option for current versions of Safari. Personally I cannot stand browsing the web without a sufficient customizable content-blocker. That's why the only option for me was to change to a different browser.\nIf you dislike Firefox after you tried it, uBlock Origin also works with any Chromium based browser (e.g. Brave, Chrome, Opera). Though one main reason to use Safari is the good power management on Laptops: Your notebook will last much longer compared to using any Chromium based browser. Hence I recommend Firefox. Needless to say that Chromium is the most popular, but maybe not be the most trustworthy engine when it comes to privacy.\n", "Q: Get error output from an double-clicked app How can I get the output written to stderr and stdout from an app that has been installed by .dmg, and is opened by double-clicking its app icon in the /Applications directory?\n(I can see the output when I call the app in a terminal by using the path /Applications/MyAppName.app/Contents/MacOS/myappname, but this doesn't help since the the app behaves differently when I double-click the icon.)\n\nA: This answer is from 2013 but is mostly still relevant.\n\nPrior to Mountain Lion, all processes managed by launchd, including\n  regular applications, had their stdout and stderr file descriptors\n  forwarded to the system log. In Mountain Lion and above, stdout and\n  stderr go nowhere for launchd managed applications. Only messages\n  explicitly sent to the system log will end up there.\nIf you're writing an application and would like some output to show up\n  in the console, then adopt an API built on syslog(3) or asl(3)\n  instead. NSLog is one such API, and it has the advantage of logging to\n  stderr too so you can easily see your output no matter how you've\n  launched your application. If you'd like that functionality but want\n  to use asl or syslog directly then you'll want to look in to the\n  ASL_OPT_STDERR option to asl_open, and the LOG_PERROR option to\n  openlog respectively.\n\nBasically, when you double-click an app (same as /usr/bin/open /Applications/SomeApp.app) there is no stdout/stderr. The dev is expected to send any relevant output/errors to the available logging APIs such as NSLog.\n", "Q: What is this U folder under root /? I found this folder under my root, not sure what it is.

It is only supported on models from 2010 through 2015.  \nSend audio and video to HDMI displays through Mini DisplayPort\nIt explains what you are seeing/experiencing with the audio settings.  It is detecting your HDMI device which is capable of 8.1 audio, but it simply cannot deliver it; thus all the settings are greyed out.  \nNow, when I have connected DisplayPort (or mDP) to a DisplayPort monitor with audio capabilities, they have always been stereo (left and right), never more than that.

Is it possible to crop the view, which is then automatically used by video conferencing software? (ideally set once and forget)\nFor those wondering, I noticed this initially when I saw that Photo Booth crops my webcam input (which is embarrassing if you use that to judge what is in view!).\n\nA: Unfortunately, only with a virtual webcam.\nI recommend for simplicity Open Broadcaster Software and preferably their built-in virt. webc. or specifically this plug-in virtual webcam plugin. It goes like:\nreal webcam -> O.B.S. -> virtual webcam -> meeting ( zoom, g meet, etc )\nIt would appear that you had 2 webcams to your meeting conferencing software, so you should pick the virtual one. At the same time, inside OBS you could crop the image or even apply some other fancy filters on it.\n\nA: You can use iGlasses software to achieve the cropping of your current video camera output.\n\nA: Cameras either have or don't have these features.\n\n*\n\n*Pan (side to side adjustment),\n\n*Tilt (crop & enlarge),\n\n*or Zoom (up & down adjustment)\n\nThis is shown as P/T/Z or PTZ on feature lists.\nApple's built in FaceTime camera has none of these sadly, you will have to look at the specs for any external camera you have to see if it does.\nWhile there is some 3rd party apps that apply these after the fact, they do it by taking the video feed, adjusting it and pushing out a new virtual feed.\nSince these will likely be suggested, be aware, these can be problematic. They can be buggy, they often ask for very deep control/access of your system, and some programs do not take virtual video input well. This is reflected in their universally poor ratings in the App Store. I have also found they are stubborn to uninstall and run insidiously in the background, so use at your own risk.\n", "Q: Could installing the latest iOS update remove malware from iPhone? My iPhone XS running iOS 13.4.1 is infected with malware, although the Block Pop-ups setting is enabled in Safari settings.\nI am still getting pop-up Ads saying I made the 5-billionth search. Would upgrading iOS help to remove the malware?\n\nA: Consider going through the following relevant Apple Support document on how to block pop-up windows and handle persistent ads on Apple devices:\n\n\n*\n\n*About pop-up ads and windows in Safari\nThe document contains some very useful tips that go beyond just enabling Block Pop-ups. Notable points are quoted below:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Always make sure you install the latest software updates for all your Apple products. Many software releases have important security updates and may include improvements that help control pop-ups.\n  \n*Make sure Safari security settings are turned on, particularly Block Pop-ups—for pop-up windows—and the Fraudulent Website Warning.\nOn your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, go to Settings > Safari and turn on Block Pop-ups and Fraudulent Website Warning.\n  \n*If you see an annoying pop-up ad in Safari, you can go to the Search field and enter a new URL or search term to browse to a new site. If you don’t see the Search field on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, tap the top of the screen to make it appear.\nSome pop-ups and ads have fake buttons that resemble the close button, so use caution if you try to close a pop-up or ad. If you're unsure, avoid interacting with the pop-up or ad and close the Safari window or tab.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to exclude certain sites from search results in Safari? I would like to make sure that junk websites (like SparkNotes when I search for Shakespeare info, or Pinterest when I search for images) don't appear in my search results in Google or any search engine. Some search engines support this, and Google used to but no longer does. But in any case what I'm looking for is something that does this for both macOS and iOS, and works in Safari (especially for Google).\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: If you put -site:pinterest.* after an image search, it doesn't show any pinterest results in a Google search.\nE.g. image -site:pinterest.*\n", "Q: Time Machine backup of an external drive (to another external drive) I back up my internal drive to an external backup drive using Time Machine. I would also like to back up a 1TB external drive of mine, to another 1TB external drive of mine.\nIs it possible to make Time Machine-styled backups of my external drive to the other external drive?\nBy Time Machine-style backups, I mean the way that Time Machine makes easy-to-browse \"snapshots\" on the backup drive, where you can view the source drive at different times by accessing different folders on the backup drive. \nI considered two ways to achieve this:\n\n\n*\n\n*rsync using the --backup option\n\n\n*\n\n*This moves all deleted files into a separate backup directory wherein it preserves the original file structure. Good, but not exactly the Time Machine styled backups I'm looking for. \n\n*This also (to my knowledge) won't work for finding old versions of editing files. \n\n\n*Carbon Copy Cleaner\n\n\n*\n\n*This has the disadvantage again—all the deleted (and I believe modified files) are moved to a \"safety net\" directory. \n\n\n\nHowever, neither of them achieve the \"browse different snapshots\" behavior, à la Time Machine that I'm looking for. \nIs there any way to achieve what I'm requesting? \nI realize that it's possible with Time Machine itself, but from what I understand, it will only back the external disk up to my main backup disk. I want the external disk to backup to a secondary backup disk, keeping these backups separate from each other, mainly due to space limitations. \n\nA: I have finally found the perfect answer to this. Behold the aptly-named rsync-time-backup project on GitHub. This is an easy-to-use bash script which can back up a source folder to a destination folder. Each backup made will create a time-labeled folder in the destination directory containing a full mirror of the source folder at that time, à la Time Machine.\n", "Q: How should I enable my terminal find command on the whole disk on macOS 10.13.6?

For example is there an argument that could be passed to brew command to make it ignore the error? or provide a resolution? or can I manually download the DMG and place it in the Homebrew cache directory so that Homebrew skips downloading when running the install command?\n\nA: For people that don't have a brewed installed curl, the accepted answer is not sufficient because it's impossible to install the homebrew curl with invalid certificates (since brew install uses the system curl when the homebrew curl is not available). One way to get around this is to pass the --insecure flag to the system curl when installing the homebrew curl, through the ~/.curlrc file. However, one needs to define the HOMEBREW_CURLRC=1 environment variable prior to this:\nedit or create ~/.curlrc file and add \"--insecure\" to it then:\n$ HOMEBREW_CURLRC=1 brew install curl\ndelete ~/.curlrc file or remove the \"--insecure\" from it\n$ [HOMEBREW_FORCE_BREWED_CURL=1 if needed] brew install whatever\n\nSource\n\nA: This is documented here, see also https://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2020-06/0010.html and https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/232445/https-connection-to-specific-sites-fail-with-curl-on-macos.\nThe proposed solution is to set HOMEBREW_FORCE_BREWED_CURL\nHOMEBREW_FORCE_BREWED_CURL=1 brew cask install netlogo\n\nIf you run Catalina you can use\nexport CURL_SSL_BACKEND=secure-transport\n\nto have curl not use LibreSSL (which seems to have the issue).\nYou can also remove the entry for AddTrust from /etc/ssl/cert.pem (it's the first entry in the file, just remove all which expired end of May 2020).\n\nA: When I access the URL from here, the SSL certificate is not expired. I would suggest to retry the command now to see if it works.\nIf you still get the same error, I would check the date & time settings on your computer - they might be incorrect.\nIf they're correct, I would suggest manually installing the program. The Cask code for this specific app is very simple, so you can easily do it manually.\nSimply open this URL in a browser:\nhttps://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/6.1.1/\nDownload the DMG file for macOS. Double-click the DMG to open it, and install like any other application.\nUPDATE: Given the comment below that the question was not asked for the purpose of getting NetLogo installed, but rather to understand why the problem occurs and how to resolve it properly:\nWhen you look closer at the TLS communication with the download server (ccl.northwestern.edu), we see that the problem is actually with the bundled intermediate certificates. I.e. the actual certificate for ccl.northwestern.edu is OK and not expired, however the server replies with a number of intermediates and CA certificates that are expired (in particular the \"USERTrust RSA Certification Authority\" and \"AddTrust Extdernal CA Root\" certificates).\nWhen you access the site in Safari, you do not get an error, as it uses macOS' built-in certificate store. In Keychain you can validate that macOS by default has an up to date and non-expired CA certificate for \"USERTrust RSA Certification Authority\". Therefore you do not get any errors here.\nHowever when you use brew-cask, the file is downloaded using curl - and curl does not access the same trust store. If you try to download the file manually on the command line using curl -O you'll get the same error.\nThe client-side fix for the curl command line is to set CURL_CA_BUNDLE environment to point to a text file that has the updated intermediates. I've tested that and you can then download without warnings.\nHowever brew-cask does not seem to relay that environment variable on to curl, nor does it seem to respect a cacert line in ~/.curlrc.\nThe optimal way to resolve this problem is to fix the server. Update the intermediate certificate bundle associated with the web site on the server, and the problem will go away.\n", "Q: Fix touchpad behavior on Apple TV remote after wiping with alcohol? \nI wiped down my Apple TV remote for the Apple TV 4K (5th generation) ( a.k.a.

Now the touch-sensitive surface on the remote is wonky, responding to my finger in all the wrong ways. The alcohol has dried, but the problem continues.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: You need to restart the Apple TV device to fix this problem. The catch is: How to restart the device without the remote working properly?\nI suppose you could just pull the power plug on the device.

My MBP15\" often overheats (forcing fans to full) when plugged into my LG 5K Ultrafine. I understand that it runs at 60Hz and that this puts strain on the GPU. Since I'm mostly coding/browsing I wanted to test out 30Hz to see if it reduces the heat levels, but I don't see any way to control this in the UI. Is this some hidden advanced menu or CLI method?\n\nClarification: My machine is not shutting down, so Apple's fan speed logic seems to work fine in my case. I'm looking for ways to reduce the heat output so that high fans speeds are hopefully not required at all.\n\nA: It's not possible to change the frequency and the physical resolution of this display.\nIMHO changing that will not lower the thermal load of your MBP, because once you connect an external display the \"external\" GPU will be used and it has at least 10W of consumption. This is very apparent in the newer 16\" MBP, where I measured ~20W of base load with no matter how many or what kind of monitors are connected.\nedit: You can change the resolution (by option-clicking the Scaled label) or control-clicking Display preferences to show additional resolutions), but (at least on my setup) it barely makes any difference.\n\nA: According to the monitor manual, the monitor itself does not support 30 Hz.\nIn the section regarding \"Signal Timing\" they only list 60 Hz as supported. In the product specification sheet, they write that the vertical frequency can be 48 Hz to 60 Hz.\nTherefore I do not think 30 Hz is achievable with this monitor.\n\nA: As addition to the other answers - changing monitor refresh frequency will do nothing in this case (I.e for some TB3 external monitors that would allow that)\nMonitor frequency defined on monitor and as driven by monitor hardware. The heating of your MacBook comes from discrete video card that is used to communicate with external monitors. And it heats up due to new MacBook Pro poor heat dissipation design. Which has nothing to do with monitor refresh frequency.\n\nA: This question looks like an XY problem, so I'm not going to address monitors at all but instead how to fix your overheating problem in the first place.\nApple laptops do not like to use their fans. Usually, the only reason they overheat is because the fans don't turn on soon enough. If your fans are running at full speed with the Apple fan curve (which hates to turn on the fans), this is a very bad sign.\nThe solution to your overheating problem is to turn the fans on sooner. There will be more noise, but your laptop will not overheat. You can do this by using an app like Macs Fan Control to run the fans at full speed before overheating happens. I've run extremely heavy loads on my laptop, including running multiple games at once, training a neural network, and rendering complex scenes and it has never throttled, not once, except in cases where I forgot to turn up the fans.\nIf you want to avoid all fan noise however, then I've got bad news. Apple already tries to avoid fan noise, and by doing that they starve the laptop of the cooling it needs and drive it to thermal throttling.\nIf you want to prolong the life of your laptop, I would recommend getting used to the noise (it's really not that bad). Overheating can damage critical components including the CPU and GPU themselves.\nAnd especially if you have a newer laptop, any broken parts can mean a total replacement, and your data gone. Better safe than sorry.\n", "Q: Copy all highlighted text in Preview I have a book I'm reading in Preview (PDF) and I had highlighted some vocabs. I would like to copy those vocabs into an excel sheet. Is there anyway to do this without manually copying them one by one?\n\nA: Unfortunately exporting highlights in bulk is not implemented in Apple Preview (yet).\nWhat you can do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Show all notes and annotations from preview in a list like this (press option+cmd+4). But you'd still need to copy them manually. With this list you just get an overview and can jump directly to them within Preview.\n\n*Try the App Highlights, which provides your desired functionality.

I've relied upon my MagSafe connection to keep my laptop safe for almost a decade. I got a new MacBook Air and felt funny putting in the USB power cord, but didn't realize just why I felt funny until I tried to remove it by lifting it up instead of pulling it out.\nOMG the MagSafe is gone!\nI will have to work on trying to remember this every waking moment of every day; routing cords more carefully and keeping an eye on them so they don't get pulled by others or myself, etc.\nIs there any published advice on safe behavioral changes that MagSafe addicts like myself can learn? Are there any special aftermarket connectors, magnetic or otherwise, that I can put in the power connection that will disconnect safely when pulled? If so, are there any special features or problems I should look for before choosing one?\n\nA: Apple is ready to take your money again for MagSafe and portables.\n\n*\n\n*USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable (2 m)\nApple solution is far better than the aftermarket ones I’ve seen in the 20 to 50 range from Amazon for devices expecting USB-C power delivery.\n\nA: \nHow to cope with MagSafe “withdrawal”?\n\nOne should take pause when consider doing anything that Apple doesn't. @Allen's comment points out that the (relatively small) stub of an aftermarket magnetic connector sticking out is an opportunity to put stress on the internal connector when the laptop is stored or bouncing around in a backpack.\nFor users like me though, I have to weigh that against the benefits of having a safe disconnection if the cable is tripped on or otherwise pulled.\nA medium ground might be to consider using an aftermarket magnetic connector but taking care to either remove it and stow it somewhere or just slide the laptop into the backpack with the USB side facing up.\nBut that also means taking care if putting the laptop into a case or sleeve.\nThe other option is to (try to remember to) take it out every tine. Some adapters have little plastic tools to pull it straight out and a case to stow it, and some vendors sell two tips for every one cable, allowing you to stow one at home and the other elsewhere, or to lose one forever.\nIt seems that there is no perfect workaround to avoid experiencing MagSafe “withdrawal”.\nUpdate: don't do it!\nI tried that and it's terrible! In addition to the perma-stub sticking out of my laptop ready to catch on something and stress my laptop's connector, the thing only works (quickly releases) when pulled in certain directions, but not other directions.

I would like to convert a large number of MP3's in my Apple Music library to AAC (to save disk space).\nUsing the Music app, I have tried it with all songs of an album. Now, I've got each track twice, once in MP3, and again in AAC. That's very cumbersome to go through all songs and find the old mp3's.\nIs there an easier way?\n(I have googled, but did not find anything really useful.)\nI converted the tracks as follows: I went to the album, selected all tracks in it, went to File  / Convert / Create AAC Version, and let Apple Music do the conversion.\nThat worked, but, as I said, afterwards, each track was duplicate in the album.\n\nA: There is a free app called Adapter that will do batch convert but I'm not sure about the deletes. Since it's free it's worth a try. If it doesn't do the deletes you can always sort the files by kind so that all mp3s will be listed together in the Finder window.

If no match is found, it displays a dialog box with a message.\nif running of application \"TextEdit\" then\n    tell application \"TextEdit\"\n        set docCount to count documents\n        if docCount is greater than 0 then\n            set searchString to \"\"\n            repeat while searchString is \"\"\n                set searchString to my getSearchString()\n            end repeat\n            set documentNamesList to {}\n            repeat with i from 1 to docCount\n                if text of document i contains the searchString then\n                    copy name of document i to end of documentNamesList\n                end if\n            end repeat\n            if documentNamesList is not {} then\n                set AppleScript's text item delimiters to linefeed\n                set documentNamesList to documentNamesList as string\n                set AppleScript's text item delimiters to \"\"\n                set docText to \"The following TextEdit documents contain the search string: \" & ¬\n                    searchString & linefeed & linefeed & documentNamesList\n                make new document with properties {text:docText}\n                activate\n            else\n                display dialog \"No documents found containing the search string: \" & ¬\n                    searchString buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with title \"No Match Found\"\n            end if\n        else\n            display dialog \"There are no open documents to search...\" buttons {\"OK\"} ¬\n                default button 1 with title \"No Open Documents\"\n        end if\n    end tell\nelse\n    display dialog \"TextEdit is not open...\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1\nend if\n\non getSearchString()\n    return text returned of (display dialog ¬\n        \"Enter the search string:\" default answer ¬\n        \"\" buttons {\"Cancel\", \"OK\"} default button 2 ¬\n        with title \"Search Open TextEdit Documents\")\nend getSearchString\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n", "Q: Updating path openssl keeps using wrong path I had to downgrade openssl version for mysql. But when I ran openssl version I still got the wrong version. So I checked which openssl and I saw that it's using from anaconda:\n(base) ➜  ~ which openssl\n/opt/anaconda3/bin/openssl\n\nBut it needs to use:\n(base) ➜  ~ ls /usr/local/Cellar/openssl\n1.0.2t\n\nSo what I tried:\n(base) ➜  ~ export PATH=\"/usr/local/Cellar/openssl/bin:$PATH\"\n(base) ➜  ~ source ~/.bash_profile\n(base) ➜  ~ echo $PATH | tr ':' '\\n'\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin\n/usr/local/Cellar/openssl/bin\n/opt/anaconda3/bin\n/opt/anaconda3/condabin\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n\nSo as you can see, my path is updated correctly. But when I run again which openssl it still gives me openssl from anaconda, what am I doing wrong here?\n\nA: /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/bin (which currently is in your PATH) doesn't exist. If you want to use openssl from Homebrew use /usr/local/opt/openssl/bin (which will always point to the latest version installed via Homebrew).\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin:$PATH“\n\n", "Q: Is there a limit to the number of attempts to logon to an iPhone 8? A relative managed to change her password, yet can not input the correct password.  She does not want to reset the phone to avoid loss of data (pictures, contacts, messages, etc.).  Will the phone eventually stop accepting logon attempts?\n\nA: By default, there is no limit. One can be set - usually on sensitive business phones rather than consumer devices - where after 10 unsuccessful attempts the phone will wipe itself, permanently.\nHowever, without that parameter set, each successive failed attempt will lengthen the time before another attempt can be made. If you keep trying, eventually the time can become months or even years, so be careful.\nThere is no way to force an iPhone to let you in. If you really cannot remember the passcode, you will eventually have no choice but to wipe it & start over.\nAt that point, you will also need to be able to correctly login to the Apple ID that 'owns' the phone to release the activation lock.\nSee Apple KB - If you've forgotten the passcode on your iPhone, or your iPhone is disabled for further detail.\n\nA: The max number is 10. After 10 attempts the iphone erases all its data. The iphone also has a sliding scale for how long to wait between login attempts. You can try 5 times pretty quickly but then it'll make you wait 15 minutes, an hour, up to 8 hours before trying the 10th time, i think.\nThis process has to be set first.  Go to Settings on you iPhone and scroll down to Face ID and Passcode. Click this and scroll all the way down and you'll see an Erase Data button. If that button is turned on, then the data will be erased after 10 login attempts. The difficult part is that owner probably doesn't recall setting this. But if the owner is mistaken it could cost all the data.\n", "Q: Ordering an iPhone from different region So I ordered an iPhone SE from Apple.com It delivers in United States, But I Live in Georgia(Middle East) and The phone will be send to me by mail.\nI ordered a phone with unlocked carrier but i'm still not sure if There are any problems with unlocking and using the phone with my local carrier? And if so how can i solve the problems?\nThank you.\n\nA: The good news is your country is not entirely locked out of the Apple ecosystem and you will be able to make an AppleID and host it in your country of Georgia and have access to the App Store.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204411\nPast that, it’s not great news since many services will require you to have your AppleID hosted in a different country. Much of Apple’s offering is not directly offered to the country of Georgia. I lack experience on the cellular carriers, but since iPhone are sold in Turkey directly from Apple and from two resellers in Armenia - you likely have easy access to carriers to register the eSIM or put a physical GSM SIM in your new phone and have it work perfectly. There is zero hassle on swapping SIM at your convenience on unlocked phones from the US - no downside to buying from us other than you may have to ship it back for warranty service if Apple requests that when you ask for service. Nor many down sides, bit I can’t get you details lacking a good knowledge of carrier status in Georgia.\nAlso, you shouldn’t run into issue importing it after checking the Global Trade Compliance information that Apple publishes.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/legal/more-resources/gtc.html\n", "Q: Bash terminal windows and tabs take a few seconds to start The problem appeared after using the Migration Assistant.\nEdit: There is no command in Preferences>Profiles>Shell. \nBoth .profile and .bashrc are empty.

Users can\n# add custom state by defining a shell_session_save_user_state function\n# that writes restoration commands to the session file at exit. e.g.,\n# to save a variable:\n#\n#   shell_session_save_user_state() { echo MY_VAR=\"'$MY_VAR'\" >> \"$SHELL_SESSION_FILE\"; }\n#\n# During shell startup the session file is executed. Old files are\n# periodically deleted.\n#\n# The default behavior arranges to save and restore the bash command\n# history independently for each restored terminal session. It also\n# merges commands into the global history for new sessions. Because\n# of this it is recommended that you set HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE to\n# larger values.\n#\n# You may disable this behavior and share a single history by setting\n# SHELL_SESSION_HISTORY to 0. There are some common user customizations\n# that arrange to share new commands among running shells by\n# manipulating the history at each prompt, and they typically include\n# 'shopt -s histappend'; therefore, if the histappend shell option is\n# enabled, per-session history is disabled by default. You may\n# explicitly enable it by setting SHELL_SESSION_HISTORY to 1.\n#\n# The implementation of per-session command histories in combination\n# with a shared global command history is incompatible with the\n# HISTTIMEFORMAT variable--the timestamps are applied inconsistently\n# to different parts of the history; therefore, if HISTTIMEFORMAT is\n# defined, per-session history is disabled by default.\n#\n# Note that this uses PROMPT_COMMAND to enable per-session history\n# the first time for each new session. If you customize PROMPT_COMMAND\n# be sure to include the previous value. e.g.,\n#\n#   PROMPT_COMMAND=\"${PROMPT_COMMAND:+$PROMPT_COMMAND; }your_code_here\"\n#\n# Otherwise, the per-session history won't take effect until the first\n# restore.\n#\n# The save/restore mechanism is disabled if the following file exists:\n#\n#   ~/.bash_sessions_disable\n\nif [ ${SHELL_SESSION_DID_INIT:-0} -eq 0 ] && [ -n \"$TERM_SESSION_ID\" ] && [ ! -e \"$HOME/.bash_sessions_disable\" ]; then\n\n    # Do not perform this setup more than once (which shouldn't occur\n    # unless the user's ~/.bash_profile executes /etc/profile, which\n    # is normally redundant).\n    SHELL_SESSION_DID_INIT=1\n\n    # Set up the session directory/file.\n    SHELL_SESSION_DIR=\"$HOME/.bash_sessions\"\n    SHELL_SESSION_FILE=\"$SHELL_SESSION_DIR/$TERM_SESSION_ID.session\"\n    mkdir -m 700 -p \"$SHELL_SESSION_DIR\"\n\n    #\n    # Restore previous session state.\n    #\n\n    if [ -r \"$SHELL_SESSION_FILE\" ]; then\n    . \"$SHELL_SESSION_FILE\"\n    rm \"$SHELL_SESSION_FILE\"\n    fi\n\n    #\n    # Note: Use absolute paths to invoke commands in the exit code and\n    # anything else that runs after user startup files, because the\n    # search path may have been modified.\n    #\n\n    #\n    # Arrange for per-session shell command history.\n    #\n\n    shell_session_history_allowed() {\n    # Return whether per-session history should be enabled.\n    if [ -n \"$HISTFILE\" ]; then\n        # If this defaults to off, leave it unset so that we can\n        # check again later.

The tech support people at Apple will no doubt be helpful geeky types and if you contact them then they will do their best to make this work for you but that's not going to restore whatever old software was in place that made this work a decade or so ago.\n\nA: I have been using a 2013 iMac in Target Display mode with a 2018 MacBook Pro for 2-3 years, with a new Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter as you describe (both from Apple).\nHowever I recently changed jobs and got a 2019 MBP and can no longer use Target Display mode.\nI can't find a definitive answer to this anywhere else, but it seems either an update to the OS on the newer MBP or something about the new hardware means it doesn't work with the new MBP, while it does still work with an older MBP.\n", "Q: Unable to start screen sharing remotely on macOS Catalina after update Until one of the latest Catalina updates, I was able to (re)start Screen Sharing using the following command:\nsudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -restart -agent && sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate -configure -allowAccessFor -specifiedUsers && sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -configure -users user_name -access -on -privs -ControlObserve\nHowever, after one of the last couple of Catalina updates this fails. To be more specific, if I run the command I don't get any errors, but the Screen Sharing daemon is not launched, so I cannot remotely connect to my Mac. This still works in other Macs running High Sierra, but not in Catalina. Does anybody have any idea what might have changed in the last updates, or how to fix this?\n\nA: The problem was that, as of Mojave, you cannot stop/start the screen sharing daemon with kickstart unless \"Screen sharing\" is checked in System Preferences/Sharing. Probably the update just unchecked this preference for some reason, which made it impossible to restart the daemon remotely. Once I had physical access to the computer again and checked this preference everything worked as before the update.\n", "Q: How can data be restored when I downgrade macOS versions? I just upgraded to macOS Catalina and that was a pretty bad experience.\nI didn't know 32bit anymore, so none of my games work.\nIs there a process to back-up everything to prepare downgrading to Mojave or High Sierra.\nI'd want to prepare for everything as it was before such as my saved games, existing apps. My supplies are time and an external HD.\nIs there a step-by-step guide to perform this?\n\nA: Copy all important files to another HD (apps, games, your user's library folder, all your other user folders, etc).\nDownload Mojave, create a USB, boot, erase and install. \nSet up the new computer, then copy stuff over. Some things (like Mail, iCloud, some settings, and iTunes data won't work). If you use steam, it should be pretty easy to copy its folder (within ~/Library/Application Support/Steam to your new user. \n", "Q: How does Apple perform a lossless in-place conversion from HFS+ to APFS? Since High Sierra, Apple has allowed users to do an in-place conversion of an existing HFS+ file systems to APFS without losing files. This can happen automatically during an OS upgrade or can be done by the user with Disk Utility. \nMy question is, how, technically, is this accomplished? I'm not asking how a user can do the conversion, I'm asking what actually happens on the disk during the conversion process. I've done some searches but have only found references to the fact that it can be done. This article provides some analogies, and I found some hints on how APFS allows easier resizing of partitions.\nDoes the software directly convert one file system to another on the fly? If APFS is basically an enhancement to HFS+ I can see this being easy, but my impression is that is not the case. \nDoes it create two partitions and slowly move content from one to the other, resizing as it goes, or create an image of the old system then restore it to the new system? It seems these would require a fair amount of free space, and could fail if the drive is full. \nSomething else? \n\nA: It’s a four step process according to this article from The Ecletic Light Company\n\n\n*\n\n*Read and convert the existing HFS+ metadata (files, directories, etc) to APFS format; writes it to free space on the drive\n\n*Verifies that the APFS data is correct\n\n*If no errors, it writes the volume super block in APFS format\n\n*It deletes the HFS+ meta data leaving just the APFS volume\n\n\nIt converts it a single piece at a time, updating the volume as it goes.  This is why you need sufficient free space prior to the conversion process begins.\n\nA: I don't know much in terms of details, but I'm pretty sure the basic process involves building parallel volume data structures and then switching which one's used.\nTo understand what that means, you need to know a little bit about how a filesystem stores its files on disk. Somewhat oversimplified, there are two kinds of data being stored: the actual file contents are just stored pretty much as raw data, and then there's some additional database-ish thing that keeps track, for each file, of where that particular file's raw data is stored (as well as \"metadata\" like file's name, permissions, last modify time, etc).\nThe raw file contents is pretty much the same between different volumes formats (except for encrypted volumes), but the database-ish metadata will be different between HFS+ vs. APFS vs. FAT vs. whatever.\nMost of the disk's contents is (generally) the raw file contents, since the metadata is generally much smaller than the file's actual contents. That means that in converting from one format to another, most of the volume's contents doesn't need to change; only the database-ish thing that stores file locations and metadata needs to be converted. So what you can do is build a new-format database-ish thing in the free space in the volume (copying and converting the contents of the old-format one), and then simply say \"ok, use the new one now.\" (and mark the old one as free space in the new format).\nThat's the oversimplified view; in practice I'm sure there's a lot of complications and fiddly details that need to be dealt with. But I'm pretty sure this is the basic idea.\nBTW, there's a similar trick that's sometimes used (including by Apple) to make multiformat (or \"hybrid\") disks. For example, Apple's CD/DVD burning and image creation software can make disks that're valid as HFS+ volumes (readable on Macs), and also valid ISO 9660 volumes (readable on a wide variety of other OSes that don't know HFS+ from a hole in the ground). It stores one copy of each file's contents, and two different database-ish things (one ISO format, one HFS+), and sets it up so different OSes will see the one they understand and be able to read the volume.\n", "Q: How to resolve freezes when pressing caps lock on external keyboard I've been trying to diagnose a problem with my Logitech K120 keyboard paired with a Macbook Pro 15\" (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) where occasionally, pressing the caps lock would cause that keyboard to completely stop responding for a few seconds. I'd previously used this keyboard with a Windows PC, and found no issues.\nI've tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Setting the modifier key to do nothing and then setting it back (per this Superuser answer)\n\n*Installing Karabiner Elements (from the same Superuser thread.

I might just try replacing the keyboard soon, but I was hoping there'd be a software or configuration fix that would work.\n\nA: This has happened to me on two different Macs with 3 different bluetooth keyboards. Two Apple keyboards and one Logitech. The symptom is always the same, intermittently the keyboard will freeze for about 5 seconds after hitting the caps lock key.\nRestarting the computer will often resolve the issue for a short time but an SMC reset normally resolves the issue more long term.\nI have had this experience over the last 5 years and have found documentation of others having the exact same issue for over a decade.

So occasionally I will be working in zsh, in an interactive shell, and will shift to the Finder (or Path Finder) and while there will throw the folder, that is the current working directory in the Terminal, into the Trash.  I'll then later go back to the shell for something else, and find that the shell is still in the now-deleted folder.\nIs there a way where zsh can figure out that, if the folder's parent has changed to become \".Trash\", it should, say, change its directory (in my case, ideally to the desktop folder)?

Is there a way to get this information in a more machine-readable text format?\nEDIT: Any well known format would be nice, e.g. CSV/TSV, JSON, XML. Or something simple would be perfectly fine, like newline-delimited lines. Just something I can easily parse. I can possibly parse the htop output, as it is text. However, that feels wrong because it's sort of \"graphical\" looking and I can't be sure future versions won't change the look.\n\nA: There are ways to get this information from htop, but they basically involve screen scraping, as it is designed primarily for interactive use.\nInstead, check out the glances command-line tool, which can do what you want.\nIt can be installed via homebrew:\nbrew install glances\nSomething like the following may work for you:\nglances --stdout now,percpu --time 10\n", "Q: What is blackice-icecap user console on port 8081 on my MacBook air?

However, it is very unlikely that you have that system running on your MacBook Air.\nIn essence your port list just writes the name of the software that has registered the port with IANA - i.e. they're saying that \"our software uses this port\".

How can I achieve this? Solution which include free software are preferred. I usually use iMovie for video editing.\n\nA: Use AssistiveTouch\nThis isn't a perfect answer to the question because this doesn't help you after you've already recorded a video, but you can use the AssistiveTouch feature built into the accessibility settings in iOS to display your touches while recording.\nAssistiveTouch wasn't made for this purpose, so this isn't the \"best\" solution, but it's probably the easiest and least intrusive to implement as it only uses features already built into iOS.\n\nThe biggest issue with this approach\nThis is an important caveat of using this approach: you can't show touches while dragging/scrolling.\nYou have to manually exit the \"touch recording\" (if we may call it so), do the scroll/drag actions you want to do, then re-enable the \"touch recording\" (see the GIF above for an example).

Thanks you!\n\nA: I do not know of a way using basic vanilla AppleScript, by itself, to move the mouse cursor; however there are third-party utilities that can do it, one being cliclick; however, you also need to be able to tell it where to move it and that has its own issues.\nOn a different track, looking at the web page of the URL in your OP, I see that looking at the HTML to the target element, e.g. \"document.getElementsByClassName('_3ZDC1p')[2].innerHTML;\" there is a URL for the image.\nWhy not get the HTML, parse it to get the URL, and download it directly to your system?\nThe following example AppleScript code does just that:\n--  # Get the HTML for the target element.\n\ntell application \"Safari\" to ¬\n    tell front document to ¬\n        set innerHTML to do JavaScript ¬\n            \"document.getElementsByClassName('_3ZDC1p')[2].innerHTML;\"\n\n--  # Parse 'innerHTML' to get the URL.\n\nset text item delimiters to {\"(\", \")\"}\nset theURL to second text item of innerHTML\nset text item delimiters to {}\n\n--  # Set the pathfilename for the saved image,\n--  # e.g,: /Users/me/Pictures/1591893975.jpeg\n--  # Name is based on seconds since Epoch.\n\nset saveToFileName to POSIX path of ¬\n    (path to pictures folder) & ¬\n    (do shell script \"date +%s\")\n\n--  # Define the commands necessary to accomplish\n--  # the download base on the OP's URL example.\n\nset shellCMD to \"curl -ks \" & theURL's quoted form & \" -o \" & saveToFileName's quoted form & ¬\n    \"; mv -n \" & saveToFileName's quoted form & space & saveToFileName's quoted form & ¬\n    \".$(file \" & saveToFileName's quoted form & \" | awk -F ': | ' '{print tolower($2)}')\"\n\n--  # Download the file.\n\ndo shell script shellCMD\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: This example AppleScript code is based solely on the HTML of the target element and what's necessary to automate the process once the target web page is available and is the frontmost Safari window.\n\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide.

I use it for mostly for reading books, videos on YouTube or movies. The battery shows \"service needed\". The battery cycle count is just 312. I have shown it to the service center and they told me that the battery needs replacement. \nNow I don't understand what has happened to the battery. My usage of the laptop is just normal. Also I did leave it attached to the charger even after 100% charging but that is only more  beneficial for the battery as many posts here state too. \nThen why has the battery started malfunctioning when apple promises 1000 cycle counts and it's just been 312 counts. \nWhat can be the issue. Was the battery that I originally got faulty. \n\nA: Your battery needs to be replaced.  Period.\nThere’s a very similar question that already addresses this question\n\n*\n\n*Macbook Pro Battery 0% and wrong date\nHowever, you have a few statements in your question that should be addressed.\n\nMy usage of the laptop is just normal... I use it for mostly for reading books, videos on YouTube or movies\n\nIt doesn’t matter.  The battery has no idea (and doesn’t care) what you use it for.  Whether you read eBooks, write code or crunch numbers, your battery will do the same thing which is use a chemical reaction to move electrons.\n\nAlso I did leave it attached to the charger even after 100% charging but that is only more beneficial for the battery as many posts here state too.\n\nThis s fallacy perpetuated by well meaning but misinformed folks throughout the Internet.  Leaving your charger plugged in doesn’t mean your battery is still charging.  If you see the green light (MagSafe chargers) or get the “100% charged indicator” and your charger is still plugged in, it doesn’t mean the charger is still jamming electrons into the battery.  The SMC will “disconnect” the charger electronically to stop charging.  If you’re using the Mac, it will draw most, if not all the power from the charger first, battery second.  The battery itself has an overcharge/undercharge protection circuit to also protect it.\nYou having to manage your Mac’s battery charging process - a machine that can literally recognize your voice and fingerprints, and produce some if the most brilliant videos on the fastest performing SSDs on the market somehow can’t manage a simple task like charging it’s battery is simply baffling.\n\nThen why has the battery started malfunctioning when apple promises 1000 cycle counts and it's just been 312 counts.\n\nApple promises no such thing.  The expectation is that a battery “should” have a life expectancy, on average, of 1000 charges.  It’s the typical bell curve with some batteries lasting less and others lasting more.  Granted, 2 years and 312 cycles is on the narrow, left side if the curve, but it’s not improbable nor unheard of.  It’s just less common.\nWhy does it fail so soon?  Any number of reasons, but likely a manufacturing defect.  These are “man-made” devices so they’re not perfect.  Each battery is composed of individual cells, you may have had one or more cells go bad. Maybe the SEI layer that is both necessary to conduct the electrons across the cell but also detrimental in that as it builds, capacity dies, has built up to the point that it can't function any more.  Only a lab with specialized equipment and high power microscopes can tell.\n\nWas the battery that I originally got faulty.\n\nNo exactly.  The warranty of a Mac in the US 1 year.  You can purchase Apple Care for an additional 2.  I have a saying that that if a company is willing to warranty something for X years, means it is expected to last X+1 years.  Using this “theory”, a new Mac with AppleCare including battery coverage is 3 years.  The expected lifespan of a battery is 3 to 5 years.  Seems to fit.\nThat doesn't mean there are outliers.  There are some that last 6+ years meaning Apple couldn’t be happier.  There are some that last only a couple of months meaning Apple is on the hook for a replacement much sooner than they were expecting.\nTL;DR\nThe battery died prematurely.  It happens as it’s a manufactured product.  Unfortunately it happened sooner than you expected but there’s no “fault” to be assigned.  It’s definitely a bummer and very inconvenient but there was nothing you did (most importantly) nor anything Apple did that caused it to fail.\n", "Q: Best approach for: Dual boot Mac OS and Win 10 And shared files volume I've got a somewhat older macbook pro (mid 2014) and it starts lagging.

Include space for the MS-DOS (FAT) or ExFAT volume to be shared.\n\n\nSteps to create a shared volume\n\nThis is to be done after installing macOS and Windows.\n\nTo create a MS-DOS (FAT) or ExFAT volume to be shared, preform the following steps.\n\n\n*Under Windows 10, open Disk Management. Highlight the BOOTCAMP volume and select Shrink Volume…, as shown below.\n\n\n*Select the desired size, as shown below. Next, select the Shrink button,\n\n\n*Highlight the unallocated space and select New Simple Volume…, as shown below.\n\n\n*When the image shown below appears, select the Next button.\n\n\n*When a image similar to the image shown below appears, select the Next button.\n\n\n*In desired select a different drive letter, then select the Next button.\n\n\n*Select FAT32 and enter a volume label, as shown below. When finished select the Next button.\n\n\n*When a image similar to the image shown below appears, select the Finish button.\n\n\n*The result is shown below.\n\n\n*If you wanted ExFAT format, then restart back to macOS. Use the Disk Utility to erase the volume. Enter a name and ExFAT format, as shown below. When finished, select the Erase button.\n\nNote about the Golden Rule\nThere is a Golden Rule which can be loosely stated as:\n\nNever change the partitioning on a Mac from Windows.\n\nIn this case, the Golden Rule does not apply for the following reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*There no Mac OS Extended volumes on the drive. \n\n*Windows is installed to UEFI boot.\n\n\nA: Bootcamp allows you to boot into Windows on your Mac. Once installed, you will choose to boot to Windows or MacOS. \nIf you wish your Mac to dual boot Windows, you must use the Bootcamp installer. If you do not, you won't be able to boot into Windows or often get it installed. You can likely search google for many suggestions to install it outside of Bootcamp, but I think you will find most are not successful. \nMy recommendation is that you do not do any of the partitioning yourself, instead, the Bootcamp installer will do the partitioning for you.  It requires a minimum of 64GB, but you should assign what you think you will need for your use of Windows. You could start by splitting the 1TB in half for each OS. The volume type etc are not important, the Bootcamp utility will do that for you. Your MacOS partitions will be APFS unless you choose to go with HFS+. Your new Mac will come with two partitions out of the box, one of them invisible (recovery).\nIts hard to tell from your question if you are planning a Hackintosh or a Macbook. If a Macbook, there is no way to put in cooling paste, etc. And I am not clear on what 3 volumes will get you, but note that you do not create the Windows volume from the Disk Utility in Mac. The Windows volume is in many respects 'invisible' to MacOS.\nIf you decide not to dual boot with Windows, you can always remove that partition later.\nFor more on Bootcamp, see this Apple Support doc:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468\n\nA: HI dear I wanted to direct you using a boot-loader which allowed me to do what you exactly wanted but after thinking a while I thought this link would highlight the way better the way I did it with my own solution cause it had some glitches with over-heating my macBook. Below is the link you will find useful:\nhttps://www.laptopmag.com/articles/dual-boot-windows-macos\n\nA: Follow this solution if you want to freely define the size of the shared volume, not rely on any Filesystem-Driver and access the shared partition from both operating systems natively.\n\n*\n\n*Install macOS\n\n*Use the BootCamp Assistant to install Windows, this will create the Bootcamp partition. Give enough disk space for Windows but you don't have to include the disk space that you want to share.\n\n*Use Disk Utility to create a new partition (not only a Volume) on the disk where macOS is installed. Now you decide how big the shared disk will be. Although you are creating an APFS-partitioned disk you will no longer be able to resize it later because we are going to change it to exFAT.\n\n*In Disk Utility change the view-mode to View all devices, then you can reformat the disk partition to exFAT. Like described here . Since you're not going to erase a thumb drive, you might get failure messages because the disk is in use by some application. Eject the disk and if necessary force eject: repeat until erasing to exFAT succeeds.\n\n*Now you have a shared disk that can be accessed from both operating systems.\n\nIf you want to have your home folder on the shared disk, follow this instruction. On the Windows side you will have to right click all of the Profile-Folders (Documents, Pictures, Movies,...) and select their new location on the shared disk.\nIf you are going to boot into Windows both natively as well as from the virtualization software Parallels, there are some more points you have to take care of (for other virtualization machines similar issues might arise):\n\n*\n\n*In the Settings of your virtual machine unset share your profile with Windows and preferrably do not map the mac drives to windows. Instead share only custom folders and select the shared disk. The shared disk will be visible in Windows as Z: . If you share several drives or are mapping the mac drives the drive-letter might change to Y: , X: ,...\n\n*When booting into Windows natively, the drive will still appear with the letter D: . To keep the letter and all the paths consistent independently of the booting mode, open Disk Management, select the partition and give it the same letter that it gets when Windows is booted as virtual machine. You will get a warning that changing the letter might break some paths, confirm it.\n\nBefore coming up with this solution, I tried the solution proposed by  David Andersson. But I found out, that there is one big problem: the shared volume you create out of the Bootcamp-Partition will be at maximum 50% of the original Bootcamp partition. This because Windows places some not-relocable system-files in the middle of the partition. I've even tried to resize the partition with a third-party tool (AOMEI Partition Assistant as well as Minitool Partition Wizard). Both did either fail during execution, or corrupted the partitions putting me back to the bottom of the stairs.\nI also tried to keep the shared partition in APFS and install an APFS-Driver software to Windows. At first sight APFS for Windows seemed to be a good choice to a fair price. But after one month of troubles and a completely non existing customer service, I can only discourage this way. The issues I faced are that Excel was not able to open *.xls and *.csv files nor to save *.xlsx files. Visual Studio was not able to start debug sessions. The files could be opened with a text editor or copied to another location. If copied to a NTFS-Drive or when Windows was booted as virtual machine those problems disappeared, so the problem was clearly related to APFS for Windows, the files itself were not damaged.\n", "Q: How to prevent MacBook pro heating when using external monitor, which causes the internal monitor to flicker after hours of work Problem:\nIt is well known that when MacBook Pro is connected to the external monitor, the GPU gets involved and the system heats up. The common advice is to just live with it because the system will prevent overheating.\nOn my MacBook Pro 2017 15\" (A1707), however, after a couple of hours of use on (arguably) high temperature, the internal monitor (not the external one) starts to flicker badly, like this: \n\nThe screen keeps flickering until I shut down the laptop, (or I close the lid and work with external mouse and keyboard, and after 1 an hour, the screen is OK when I open the lid.)\nPossible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bring MB back to the store and perhaps change the cable or whatever: It's hard to reproduce and Apple stores are closed due to COVID-19 :|\n\n*Buy a cooling pad: I tried it and it didn't work. My 5-fan cooling pad substantially cools down the aluminum body of the Mac, but the issue still appears.\n\n*Not letting the laptop warp up to that stage. Obviously, the MacBook Pro's fan controller is not tuned for this scenario and does not speed up the fans soon enough, because it ASSUMES that the laptop is doing well in the current temperature, which is actually not. \n\n*Use fan control software and put the fans on full blast (6000 RPM) all the time, which would work, but then it could significantly shorten the fans' lifetime (does it?)\nWhat could be the cause of the issue and what is the proper solution?\nIdeas that come to mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Driver issue? Shouldn't I trust Apple's default and install the NVIDIA one?\n\n*Buy a new HDMI cable? Could my non-Apple USB-C to HDMI cable cause such an issue?\n\n\nA: You must take it in as it’s a physical issue\nYes, it is inconvenient and time consuming, but there is no software hack that’s going to fix this. So, to get the tech to see the problem, video it. Let them know that it can take hours to manifest, but if you have video of the problem, it becomes very difficult for them to dispute your claim. Additionally, you can try to “speed up” the failure by stressing the GPU with some benchmarking software.\nAs for verifying it after the fix, the same stress test can be used to quickly determine if the fix was successful.\nIt’s likely not the cable\nYes, flex gate is an issue, but I’ve never seen cable/temperature related issues. I would be more inclined to believe it’s substandard components like a capacitor, resistor, or transistor that’s at fault here.  A lot of the 2007 through 2010 Macs with GPU issues were due to substandard capacitors.  Put “larger” ones in and the issues went away. As for the cable, the issue usually manifests when opening the lid past a certain point, regardless of temperature. The other cable issue is that Apple decided to put the backlight pin (48V) adjacent to a data pin (3V) that went directly to the CPU/GPU. If this was your issue, you’d know it as your Mac would be dead.\nAvoid fan control software\nUnless you’re planning on overriding your fans to keep everything cool at the expense of noise, these gimmicks do nothing but cause your system to run slower. If your system heats up and needs to cool off, the SMC will spin up the fan. If that’s overridden, the OS has no choice but to slow things down so it can allow the CPU to cool.\nAs for the fan’s “lifespan” it’s really of very little consequence.  Apple doesn’t make fans, they OEM them from another manufacturer.  You can easily get replacements for $10 to $15USD. They’re also super easy to replace that DIY is very much doable; if you must take it to a technician, you’re looking at 15 to 30 minutes of labor, tops.  Compared to a logic board, a fan is less than a negligible cost.\n\nA: Use a cooling pad for the laptop and make wrist rests for you to keep your arms at the height for the keyboard.\n", "Q: Crawl computer for node_modules, add .nosync file Per https://medium.com/@isaiah.taylor/how-to-maintain-node-projects-with-icloud-drive-4c6549f7c806, I can prevent node_modules folders from syncing via iCloud Drive. \nTrouble is: there's often a lot of node_modules folders. A lot, a lot. And I often forget before I start copying. \nQuestions\n(1) Is there a way to crawl through my hard drive, find node_modules folders and add a .nosync file?\n(2) Is there a way to keep this crawling going in the background? So that this crawling would happen for any new folders? Wonder if this is a Hammerspoon kind of thing maybe? \n\nA: You can run the following to create a .nosync file in each node_modules folder\nfind ~ -type d -name node_modules -exec touch {}/.nosync \\;\n\nThis will look through everything in your home directory. You can limit it to the Desktop folder by replacing ~ with ~/Desktop.\nTo have the command run regularly you can create a crontab entry:\n\n*\n\n*Run EDITOR=nano crontab -e to start editing.

Applications and other executable code will contain instructions that are either 32 or 64 bits wide. \nHowever, file formats are largely unaffected by this. Almost all applications will open the same file data regardless of the application's bit-depth. So, MS Office documents can be opened by both 32 and 64-bit versions.\nIt's possible that new software may introduce new data structures than are unreadable by older software, but that's a different issue.\n\nA: Files themselves don't have a bit-depth, as such, only applications. \nIf you have a current MS Office installed [ie not Office 2011 or earlier*], your files will be fine. If not, there are other apps that can handle them.\n*Office 2016 is Catalina-compatible, if it is up to date.\n\nA: There is a very good Apple suite of tools that are compatible. It used to be called iWork but now it just each individual apps. They are Pages, Numbers, and Keynote. These can replace Word, Excel and Powerpoint and read / write those formats. \nIf you’re worried any third party app won’t work with the new OS - try the alternatives so you know how you like them.\n\nA: No. Macs have been, hardware-wise, 64-bit for a long time and even if Mojave technically supports 32-bit apps, most recent apps including Microsoft Office are 64-bit.\nEven if it wasn't, things like text files and word files and spreadsheets and etc. aren't specific to 32-bit or 64-bit systems. Editing a file on a 32-bit system won't make it \"read only\" on a 64-bit system. Even if you were upgrading your system from 32-bit to 64-bit, your documents would remain the same.\nPerhaps if you were weird and using some 32-bit office suite, you would have to upgrade the suite itself in order to start the program that can read those files, but the files themselves will be fine.\n32-bit and 64-bit only refers to executable programs, specifically the type of instructions the CPU understands. Anything that is not machine code does not care about 32-bit or 64-bit - that includes documents.\n", "Q: Automator Help: take Fixed-Position Screenshot, click \"Next Page\" and Repeat (that's it!)

I'm a software developer and as such I build and run programs hundreds of times per day. I've noticed that since I started using Catalina, after compiling and linking there is a delay (which can be seconds) when the internet is slow or having problems (I have bad internet often). If I disable wifi and rebuild, the delay goes away.\nHow can I disable this so my builds run faster?\n\nA: Yes, as a security measure, macOS Catalina sends some small info (can be seen by packet size) about unsigned executables to the Apple servers.\nA simple  C program as illustrated in ..\n\n*\n\n*Does macOS phone home to Apple's servers before running an app for the first time?\n.. can demonstrate the lag in startup on poor internet connection conditions.\n\n*\n\n*https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/catalina-executables.html\nThe article has detailed observations, tests and commentary on the process.\nYou can block the syspolicyd process from connecting to the internet, and it won't hinder its normal functioning locally, using a firewall.\nI use LuLu, since it's free. A lot of people use Little Snitch.\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/objective-see/LuLu\n\n*https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html\nMany other apps also ping their servers on startup or quitting: Firefox,\nAdobe,\nSublime Text etc.\nOther threads:\n\n*\n\n*Which free alternatives to Little Snitch can I use to block internet traffic per applications?\n\n*How can I get the exact URLs/requests that a program is trying to connect to?\n\n*Reasons to prefer Little Snitch over the built-in firewall\n\n*Firewall for outgoing connections\n\nA: Use an Application Firewall to control what app on your mac connects to the internet.\nLulu is free and opensource. Radiosilence and TripMode are two other very affordable alternative app firewalls that are simpler to use than Lulu. Little Snitch and HandsOff are more advanced with more features (and hence costlier).\nIf you like controlling what apps connect to the internet on your mac,think carefully before upgrading to macOS Big Sur. Apple has crippled application firewalls on macOS Big Sur, to specifically allow all Apple authorised software to bypass application firewalls and some VPNs, and connect to the internet whenever it wants even if you have blocked them on your firewall.\nUpdate: Apple claimed that the issue with macOS Big Sur was a bug and it has been fixed now.\n", "Q: How to use iPhone to Store and Organize Photos Outside of Photos Camera Roll The main issue I’m trying to solve is that when photos are transferred to the iPhone’s \"Photos\" via iTunes syncing, the picture gets transformed.\nTo verify that, sync a photo using iTunes to get it into the iPhone's \"Photos\"; and while iTunes is still running and the phone is connected, access the photo on the iPhone from the computer via USB and check the properties of the photo.  It's a transformed lower resolution photo.  Called Apple Support about this and they confirmed, that's what it does, works as designed, \"to save space\" was the reason.\nNeed a solution: to be able to use a photo organizer that does not rely on media being kept in iPhone \"Photos\" so I can use a photo organizer that does not transform any of my media.\n\nA: Solution for that and as a side benefit, keep the \"Camera Roll\" as close to empty as possible (made a little compromise to accommodate keeping media original that has effects e.g. live, animated photos).\nNeed a photo organizer that:\na) stores photos/videos in it's on file space on the iPhone and can make albums from that source (so that it does not rely on \"Photos\").\nb) is able to add photos/videos to that file space from the iPhone's \"Photos\" and be able to load photos/videos from any source so that everything is in one place (from which albums can be made).\nTo keep everything in original form, no transformations, here’s a strategy that will even work on an iPhone 5.\nOne compromise: to preserve the ability to play \"live\" photos or photos with effects, leave those in \"Photos\" so unfortunately, that means the Camera Roll would have some media in it.  Yes, one could compromise and let \"live\" photos get transformed into a .jpg and an accompanying .mov file but, the goal is to not transform anything and retain the exact characteristics of how the media plays so, if that’s important to you, leave it in \"Photos\".   fyi \"Live Photos\" and \"Animated\" photos are identified under \"Media Types\" in \"Photos\".\nPhoto organizers considered: Adobe Lightroom Photo Editor, Utiful.\nAdobe Lightroom Photo Editor (free version does everything required).  Lightroom copies media into itself (it's own file space) and once it's there, you make albums that references media in that file space and therefore it will not be referencing media stored in \"Photos\".\nTo aid in getting media to the iPhone, install AirMore onto the iPhone (it's free).  AirMore serves two purposes: to transfer media to the phone, to serve as a single spot to copy media onto the iPhone which Lightroom can get at and copy the media to itself.\nGETTING YOUR MEDIA ONTO YOUR iPhone.\n1) Media that's on a camera.  Transfer it to a computer, use iTunes or AirMore to get it onto the iPhone.  Because AirMore's file space shows up in iTune's \"File Sharing\", you can copy files to that app without having to use iTune's sync.  Lightroom will be able access the file space in \"AirMore\" to copy the media into itself.\n2) Media that's on a computer.  If you like iTunes and the computer has it installed, that's an option (copy the media to AirMore via \"File Sharing).  If it isn't available, then use AirMore.  Regardless, both result in the media going to AirMore's file space where Lightroom can copy it into itself.\n3) Media that's on an iPhone.  Use AirMore or Airdrop.  Airdrop is ideal for a specific scenario, for transferring \"Live\" photos or \"Animated\" photos from \"Photos\" because using Airdrop results in a direct transfer from one iPhones \"Photos\" to the other iPhones \"Photos\" and the media's effects are preserved.\nLightroom can now copy media into itself because it can access the files in AirMore.  Copy the media and delete it once it's copied. Lightroom can copy media from the \"Photos\" camera roll into itself.  Delete stuff that's been copied from \"Photos\".\nEverything is original and in one place (except live/animated photos) in Lightroom.  The camera roll is as close to being empty as it can be.  Enjoy, get going on those albums!\n\nA: Some camera apps have a “Lightbox” feature which collects up all the images you capture. When you use the Lightbox to review images you've taken, you can choose to edit the image, save it to the Photo Library, or share it with the standard iOS share sheet, which may include a way to save the image that doesn't alter it the way that @kelly-smith says that iTunes Sharing does. \nAn example of a camera app with this Lightbox feature is both versions of Camera+, (with whom I have no affiliation).  \nThis also assumes the images come from the phone’s camera, rather that (say) screenshots or downloaded.\n", "Q: Exporting all pictures from iPhone keeping all features I have an iPhone full of pictures and videos (approx 80 GB). I want to export them to free up space (and have a backup if possible). I am looking for a solution, e.g. a software running on Windows or a personal webserver or a cloud, sorting by preferred option. The point is I want to keep all or most of the following useful features provided by iPhone Photos:\n\n\n*\n\n*People (face recognition)\n\n*Places\n\n*Search by date\n\n*Live photos\n\n*Panoramas\n\n*Albums\n\n\nIn other words, I want to be able to \"browse\" just like I do inside my iPhone. I hoped iTunes could support it. I know I can buy iCloud space ($3/month) but I'm looking for a free alternative.\nEDIT\nLet me clarify even more: I want to know how do you deal with this problem. How do you free up space without losing Albums, live photos, search by places, etc.? Is iCloud the only solution?\n\nA: In order to keep all the functionality you mention, your options are really only to have either a Mac with the built-in Photos app, or an iPad or similar device that you could offload your content to.\nAs far as I know, there's no free software that provides these features in exactly the same way as Photos on the iPhone, but on a webserver or on Windows.\nYou could export your Photos to a Windows PC and then use any PC photo management software, but the feature list would vary from program to program. For example the only free, Windows-based photo management software I know that does face recognition is mylioX. It doesn't do it exactly the same way as Apple, nor does it has the same list of features.\nHere's Apple's guide to exporting your photos to Windows or Mac computers:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201302#importpc\n", "Q: Default c++ compiler version I need to compile some small cpp files so I'd like to do that through the terminal.

I am running out of ideas. Please can anyone help me to get rid of those pop ups? At this point I have no idea if the problem is related to Golang or MacOs.\n\nA: This is normal behaviour.\nEach time you run go run main.go a new executable file is being created. This executable file is unique and unrecognised by macOS's security checks. Thus macOS asks, every time, for you to confirm if the new executable can have network access.\nBuild and Sign\nTo avoid the warning, you need to build the executable file once and codesign it. You can build the executable file using the command:\ngo build -o mycmd main.go\n\nThe resulting executable called mycmd can be run using:\n./mycmd\n\nTo ad-hoc codesign this executable use:\ncodesign -s - mycmd\n\nThis will cause macOS to trust this build of mycmd on your Mac. The first time it is run, you will be asked for network access. Subsequent runs will not require network checks.\n\nA: You can avoid this pop-up when running local tests if you specify the host portion of the address that will be listened to to be \"localhost\" or \"127.0.0.1\". Many programs let you set the address through the command line or an environment variable and many of those programs will default to passing no host to the listen command. With no host specified, Go will listen on 0.0.0.0 and macOS will want to warn you about that.

This assumes the copy of the Install macOS High Sierra.app application bundle is not actually damaged.\nFirst, make a macOS USB Installer following the directions in: How to create a bootable installer for macOS\nFor macOS High Sierra you'll need an 8 GB USB Flash Drive formatted as Mac OS Extended with nothing valuable on it as it will be erased during the creation process.\nThe following command shows the syntax, e.g.:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume\n\nAfter creating the macOS USB Installer you'll use vmware-rawdiskCreator to create a raw disk VMDK of the macOS USB Installer to manually add to the configuration file of the macOS High Sierra virtual machine following the directions in: Creating a raw disk VMDK and adding it to the Virtual machine in Fusion (2097401)\nWhat I did:\n% mount\n /dev/disk4s1 on /Volumes/Install macOS High Sierra (hfs, local, nodev, nosuid, journaled, noowners)\n# Relevant line above from the mount command, other lines omitted for brevity.\n\n% vmware-rawdiskCreator print /dev/disk4\n  Nr      Start       Size Type Id Sytem                   \n -- ---------- ---------- ---- -- ------------------------\n 1          2   15633406 BIOS AF HFS+\n\n% vmware-rawdiskCreator create /dev/disk4 1 'Install macOS High Sierra' lsilogic\n% ls -l *.vmdk\n% -rw-------  1 me  staff  32256 Jun 14 17:34 Install macOS High Sierra-pt.vmdk\n% -rw-------  1 me  staff    772 Jun 14 17:34 Install macOS High Sierra.vmdk\n\n# The path to vmware-rawdiskCreator omitted for brevity.\n# /dev/disk4s1 is what the USB Installer is on my system and will vary from system to system.\n\nI moved the Install macOS High Sierra-pt.vmdk and Install macOS High Sierra.vmdk files to within the document bundle of the virtual machine and edited the configuration file, e.g. macOS 10.13.6.vmx, adding the following lines:\nsata0:2.present = \"TRUE\"\nsata0:2.fileName = \"Install macOS High Sierra.vmdk\"\nsata0:2.deviceType = \"rawDisk\"\nsuspend.disabled = \"TRUE\"\n\nI also edited bios.hddOrder to be: bios.hddOrder = \"sata0:2\"\nWhen starting the virtual machine with a raw disk VMDK you'll be prompted with a password dialog box stating, VMware Fusion requires administrative privileges for accessing Boot Camp disks.; however this is a generic message displayed for any raw disk VMDK, not just when running a Boot Camp install as a virtual machine.\nAfter the install is finished the lines added to the configuration file can be removed and reset bios.hddOrder to, e.g.,: bios.hddOrder = \"sata0:0\"\n\nDuring the Install:\nIf your copy of the Install macOS High Sierra.app application bundle was downloaded before October 24, 2019, when Apple's security certificates used to sign software expired, you will get the error message This copy of macOS High Sierra application is damaged, and can't be used to install macOS during the install process after selecting Install macOS and clicking the Continue button.\nThe workaround, assuming the copy of the Install macOS High Sierra.app application bundle is actually not damaged, is to temporally disconnect the Network Adapter of the virtual machine, so it cannot communicate with an NTP Time Server, and temporally set the date to any date before October 24, 2019.\nThis can be done before selecting Install macOS and clicking the Continue button by using Terminal from the Utilities menu using, e.g., date 102300019 and then close Terminal and proceed as normal.\nAfter the initial install is finished the date can be set to its proper date and the Network Adapter of the virtual machine re-connected.\n\n\nA: This answer is the accepted answer, and AFAIK, it is also a correct answer. However, I need to say that I have not actually worked through the entire procedure given in the answer. I got bogged down in the details of using VMware's vmware-rawdiskCreator, and could not complete the procedure.\nIf you care to read through the extensive comments following the accepted answer, you may conclude that the latest versions of macOS Catalina (10.15.5) and VMware Fusion (11.5.5) made creation of a macOS VM arduous at best. I do not understand why this is so, but I believe that it is unnecessarily difficult due to decisions made by Apple and VMware. I say this because it is easy using older versions of the software.\nMy primary purpose for posting this alternative answer is to describe how I created a macOS High Sierra VM that runs under VMware Fusion (11.5.5) on my macOS Catalina machine (10.15.5). It may be an easier approach than the accepted answer, but it requires an additional Mac with an older version of macOS, and - at least in my case - an older version of VMware Fusion. That said, here goes:\nAn Alternative Approach\nStep 1.\nThe initial challenge is to obtain a full copy (> 5 GB file) of the 'app file'/application bundle: Install macOS High Sierra.app. Here's an \"official source\" for this file on Apple's website.\nStep 2.\nOnce you have this file (Install macOS High Sierra.app), it should be located on a Mac running macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 that also has a copy of VMware Fusion ver. 10. Note that other combinations of macOS and VMware Fusion may also work - I am only reporting what I used.\nStep 3.\nMake a High Sierra VM in VMware Fusion by selecting File, New... from the menu bar, and then drag-and-drop the file Install macOS High Sierra.app into the VMware Fusion dialog box. Follow the guided process:\n\n\n\nClick the Finish button to begin creating the High Sierra VM. When the process has completed, you will see the new VM listed, and you may select it, and start it. The VM will start in a new window.\n\n\nStep 4.\nFinally, copy the .vmwarevm file from the High Sierra Mac (the real, physical one) to the Catalina Mac. Once you have the file positioned where you want it, right-click on it, and select the option to open the file with VMware Fusion.\nThat's it. I'm considering writing an Epilogue to this saga to document some of the road-blocks encountered, and my questions regarding why this process was made so difficult. That's for another day - I'm officially burned out on Catalina and VMware for now.\n\nA: This answer is the accepted answer, and AFAIK, it is also a correct answer. However, I need to say that I have not actually worked through the entire procedure given in that answer. I got bogged down in the details of using VMware's vmware-rawdiskCreator, and could not complete the procedure. I previously created an alternative approach (first alternative approach) to the accepted answer which is here. This answer - the one that follows - is a second alternative approach for meeting the objective:\n\nThe Objective: Create a macOS High Sierra VM that runs under VMware Fusion (11.5.5) on macOS Catalina (10.15.5)\nNote: This may be an easier approach than the accepted answer. It may also be easier than this earlier alternative answer as it does not require an additional Mac with an older version of macOS. The following procedure can be completed from the target macOS Catalina 10.15.5 host. This simplification is enabled by a GitHub repo aptly named create_macos_vm_install_dmg.\nYet Another Alternative Approach:\nPrerequisites:\n\n*\n\n*A local copy of the script: create_macos_vm_install_dmg.sh, available from the author's GitHub repo\n\n\n*A copy of Apple's current High Sierra installer Install macOS High Sierra.app - which may be available on Apple's website here.\nCreate the VM:\nStep 1:\nWith both prerequisite files located in your Desktop folder (~/Desktop), run the following commands in Terminal:\n% cd ~/Desktop\n% chmod 755 create_macos_vm_install_dmg.sh\n% sudo ./create_macos_vm_install_dmg.sh \"./Install macOS High Sierra.app\" ~/Desktop\n\nThe script will ask: Do you also want an .iso disk image?. Reply to the prompt from the keyboard with: 1 return. The script will post its progress to the Terminal window, ending successfully with this:\n-- Building process complete.\n-- Built .dmg disk image file is available at /Users/youruser/Desktop/macOS_10136_installer.dmg\n-- Built .iso disk image file is available at /Users/youruser/Desktop/macOS_10136_installer.iso\n\n\nStep 2:\n\n*\n\n*Start the VMware Fusion app\n\n*Select File, New... from the VMware menu bar\n\n*Drag and drop the ISO file created in Step 1 into the window titled Select the Installation Method\nFrom this point, the rest is bog-standard for creating a VM in VMware Fusion - consult the VMware Fusion documentation if you have any questions. The ISO file will be used to install and create a High Sierra VM on macOS Catalina. You will be prompted for location, language, etc - same as when you set up macOS on a new machine. The entire process took about 12-15 minutes on on my Macbook Pro.\nAnd that's it - I've attached some screenshots from the procedure below as a visual reference.\n\n0.

There are two hardcoded examples that I'm drawing on in an effort to write a generic library script for use in a number of projects that can choose any menu item from any menu through any hierarchy of submenus.\nThe TL;DR version of this question is: How do I do that? \nBut for some more detail, if desired...\n\n...I've made some progress, and come up with a few approaches for this but each of them has one fatal flaw or another...\nOption 1. \nIf all the parameters are text or lists of text:  eg:\non ChooseMenuItem(theApp, theMenuName, theSubMenusNamesList, theMenuItemName)\n\nwhich might be called with eg:\nChooseMenuItem(\"TextEdit\", \"Format\", {\"Font\", \"Ligatures\"}, \"Use Default\")\n\nthen I can use a bunch of text parsing and concatenation etc. -- including a repeat loop through  the theSubMenusNamesList parameter to carefully construct a script in a string something like \"tell menu ... click ... tell menu item ... click ... tell menu item ... click ...\" etc. and then:\nrun script theScript in AppleScript\n\nVoila!  And this works.  Except when any of those parameters - particularly the menu name - doesn't exist.  eg. trying to connect or disconnect a bluetooth device through the bluetooth menu extra.  So...\nOption 2.\nIf the menu is nameless then let's change theMenuName to theMenu and pass it in by reference.  eg: \ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"SystemUIServer\" to set theMenu to (menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1 whose description contains \"bluetooth\")\n...\nChooseMenuItem(\"SystemUIServer\", theMenu, {\"Magic Keyboard\"}, \"Connect\")\n\nNote, here theMenu variable and parameter as opposed to theMenuName.  After performing the set statement, theMenu variable is not text, it's an AppleScript object, something like: \nmenu bar item 6 of menu bar 1 of application process \"SystemUIServer\"\n\nProceeding from here this fails one of three ways.  \n2a. If I try to construct a script that includes: tell theMenu ... it tells me, not surprisingly, that ...the variable theMenu is not defined.\n2b. If I pull theMenu out of the quotes: \"tell \" & theMenu & \"...\" or \"tell \\\"\" & theMenu & \"\\\"...\" it errors with: Can’t make «class mbri» 6 of «class mbar» 1 of «class pcap» \"SystemUIServer\" of application \"System Events\" into type Unicode text.\nie. it can't coerce the aforementioned menu bar item 6 of menu bar 1... into text (unlike in Option 1 where I could call the menu by name).\n2c. If I try to pull theMenu's tell statement out of the constructed text script so theScript text variable is something like tell menu item ... click ... tell menu item ... click (without the initial tell menu ... click) and then:\ntell theMenu\n    click\n    run script theScript in AppleScript\nend tell\n\nthen it tells me the variable \"click\" is not defined.  I believe it's referring to the first \"click\" in theScript variable that run script is trying to ... well ... run. run script... can't seem to pick up any context from where it's called from, or if it can I haven't figured out how.\nOption 3\nI've tried to think through how I might somehow include actual tell menu item theSubMenuName ... statements (ie. not text strings of the same that I then try to run) inside the above-mentioned repeat loop, but since it's a hierarchy of tells I can't quite figure out how to make that work.  Maybe there's a recursive solution here, but my brain's hurting too much to figure that out.\nConclusion\nSo, I'm at a loss... I can't figure this out, but I also can't believe there isn't a way to do this.  My inclination is that there has to be some way to refer to menu bar item 6 of menu bar 1 of... in my theScript variable somewhere... but how?  Or if really not that, then some other ultimate solution here?\n\nA: After wrestling with this for days before posting the above question, it looks like I figured out a solution - I think the act of actually describing the question in detail to post it got my thinking to there.\nI'm sharing it for the benefit of anyone else hitting something similar...\nMy struggle was with the idea that the hierarchical nature meant increasing the level of tell for each item in theSubMenusNamesList.  I couldn't figure out how to put that in a loop without each iteration of the loop going in at that level but then having to come back out at the same level, thus not going deeper. \nThis was where Option 3 was a fail from the start, which had me going down the rabbit hole of trying to construct the script in text, to then run with run script.\nHowever, Option 3 is actually the answer - code it direct without trying to construct it in text - but I had to wrestle with that some more to get there.\nI eventually realized that I can put each iteration's subMenu into a variable - set to menu item ... of the previous iteration of itself. That successfully goes deeper into each level of the hierarchy without pulling out too early.\nOf course if that doesn't make sense, then here's the code, which you're welcome to steal and adapt of course, and which may or may not make more sense... ;) \non chooseMenuItem(theApp, theMenu, theSubMenusNamesList, theMenuItemName)\n    set theAppName to the name of theApp\n    activate theApp\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process theAppName\n        tell theMenu to click\n\n        repeat with theMenuName in theSubMenusNamesList\n            set theMenu to menu item theMenuName of menu 1 of theMenu\n            tell theMenu to click\n        end repeat\n\n        set theMenuItem to menu item theMenuItemName of menu 1 of theMenu\n        tell theMenuItem to click\n    end tell\nend chooseMenuItem\n\nThis works for me - tried with a number of different options. For example: As in the original question, call it with something like:\nChooseMenuItem(\"TextEdit\", \"Format\", {\"Font\", \"Ligatures\"}, \"Use Default\")\n\nOr an example with no sub menus at all, just leave the third parameter as an empty list:\nChooseMenuItem(\"TextEdit\", \"File\", {}, \"New\")\n\nHope this helps someone.\n", "Q: Image Renaming, Mac's PREVIEW app: When typing a new name into name field at very top of Toolbar, how can I execute the rename with ENTER KEY? I've been wanting to figure this out for years. When trying to rename an open PREVIEW image file by typing a new filename directly into the name field at the very top of the Toolbar's Name field, the only way I can execute that name change is by hitting TAB KEY vs the ENTER key.  If I hit TAB, the new name sticks. If I hit ENTER, the filename is not changed.\n \nSame behavior for opened TEXT DOCs as well.\nI understand that \"a solution\" is to simply remember to use the TAB key vs the ENTER key, however, in my 25+ years using Macs and Preview, that \"solution\" has never stuck behaviorally, because my muscle memory is far stronger and more deeply reinforced by an exponentially larger number of Finder file list rename operations where one types the new name and hits ENTER to execute the rename.\nMy question is:  Is there any Terminal code or other solution that would enable me to override using Mac's default TAB KEY and instead allow me to hit ENTER, which for me is far more intuitive to my workflow?\n\nA: It drove me nuts and I found the answer just here:\nhttps://forums.macrumors.com/threads/can-no-longer-rename-files-in-preview.2035115/post-24469396\n\nThe cause turned out to be a hidden setting in\n~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist If\nNSAutomaticWindowAnimationEnabled is set to NO, then the problem\noccurs.

Apple's Magic Keyboard is a bluetooth device which means that the hacker can potentially intercept the signal and decrypt messages or say get control over the input.\nQuestion: Is Magic Keyboard secure enough? What does Apple do in order to make it secure?\n\nA: It’s actually quite safe to use Bluetooth keyboards.\nSince 2009 on, bluetooth keyboards have encrypted all traffic end to end with the exception of service discovery.  In other words, only the advertising packets that basically say “I’m a keyboard” or “I’m a trackpad or mouse” are unencrypted.  Everything else, including the authentication is encrypted.\nHow does macOS Sierra securely pair with Bluetooth keyboards without a code?\nEntering a key or a passcode is not part of the security mechanism; its a form of Simple Secure Pairing or SSP.  The passkey is just a way to identify devices to be paired.  It’s definitely not a way to prevent MITM attacks.\nSo, is Bluetooth safe?\nIt’s more accurate to say “it’s safe enough for US Government standards.\n\nBluetooth adheres to U.S. federal security regulations, ensuring that all Bluetooth devices are capable of meeting and exceeding strict government security standards.\n\n*\n\n*NIST Compliant: The National Institute of Technology develops security standards and guidelines for federal agencies to protect their information and information systems.\n\n\n*FIPS Approved: These Federal Information Processing Standards are developed by NIST in accordance with the Federal Information Security Management ACT (FISMA).\n\nFurther reading:\nNIST Special Publication 800-121 Revision 2N Guide to Bluetooth Security\n\nA: This has been discussed on other SE site. Here's the link for the same:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://superuser.com/q/342271/881716\nThe gist being, Bluetooth connection is encrypted, hence safe, and the computer makes you enter a code on the keyboard during the pairing process is done to protect. So this guards against the man-in-the-middle attack.\nEncrypted connection between the computer and the keyboard also guards against any attempts at sniffing.\n\nA: Unless there is an unknown vulnerability in Apple's bluetooth implementation, the actual data transfer is encrypted and secure. However, all wireless keyboards necessarily leak information about when you press keys:\n\n\n*\n\n*It can be used to determine when you are using your keyboard. Probably not of use to many people.\n\n*Keypress timing can be used to make e.g. password guessing easier, but this is not a very practical attack as there is still a lot of guessing involved.\n\n", "Q: Creating shared album takes long time I'm on iOS12, my wife is on iOS 13, she's in my family group. Today, I decided to share photos for the first time. On my iPhone 6, I went to the photos app and created a new album in 'shared albums'. Then I added 128 pictures to it. I then got a window with a pie chart saying \"Vorbereiten...\" (\"preparing\"). It has taken a very long time to complete this process, so I assume the images are physically downloaded and re-uploaded. \nWhy doesn't icloud just give permission to the photos I share in my family group?\n\nA: Files in your cloud count against your storage container and are stored there on the server.\nShared files don’t count against your allocation and are stored in different buckets with different QOS and technical details. \nDepending on if you optimize space on your device and have some items represented as thumbnails instead of the full images (or the image was modified on another device), you would have to round trip all 128 photos down to your device and then back up to the new bucket.\nI’ve had preparing hang on one item, so I would cancel that and start with a single image, then add in a few and then maybe do the rest once you’re sure it’s not a server side issue.\n", "Q: What date format was this file I downloaded in?

I hadn’t memorized the code fully so I went to go back to the Look at the notification but it had disappeared when I clicked on it and now I can find no way to pull it up again to retrieve the coupon code. This meant I could not get my discount from doordash and their support help said I need a screenshot of the code to get help retrieving the code which is beyond stupid as having a screenshot of the code would mean I still had it and would need no help. \nIs there anyway to pull-up recent notifications that you have clicked on? I saw nothing like that in the notification settings pages. \n\nA: There's no \"archive\" or \"history\" of notifications built-in to iOS unfortunately.

MB Pro 2015 have NVME PCIe SSD which are super fast. I was thinking to replace mine with a bigger capacity one. And then use the old one in a Windows laptop, if that's possible. Since my Windows laptop have SATA SSD I need an adapter, so NVME PCIe SSD to SATA adapter exist?\n\nA: You'd need SATA at one end and Apple's own \"12+16-pin\" PCIe connection, which is different from the M2 industry standard connectors used on SSD blades in other PCs. \nYou can do your own searching, but I suspect such things are hard to find. You would have more luck with adaptors that connect an Apple SSD blade to a USB port as an external drive, but these can be expensive.\n\nA: I don’t recommend doing this.  \nFirst off, finding an Apple proprietary NVMe adapter to put into a PC is next to impossible.  You’re more likely to find an NVME adapter that goes from the industry standard M2 to Apple’s proprietary format.  My guess is that the market is too small - there simply isn’t enough Apple NVME SSDs in the wild where people want to install them into PCs.\nSecondly, that Apple NVME SSD is super fast and connecting it to a SATA interface will just slow it down; you’ll never get the speed out of it once you connect it to a SATA interface.  \nInstead, sell the Apple SSD (they do go for quite a bit of pocket change) and get a standard SSD instead.

Every 3rd or 4th time I wake the MacBook from sleep, the external display will show very low contrast (like a gray filter applied to the whole image). The MacBook's built-in display is unaffected. Most times, I can get back to normal colors by temporarily changing the external monitor's resolution.\nAny ideas what could be causing this and how to fix it permanently? I was unable to find any firmware updates for this display.\n\nA: Did some more searching through system preferences and the OSD (on-screen display) settings.

Now the files are removed and the kernel task still using 70% of the CPU with a maximum speed of fans.\nDoes anyone have the same problem and was able to find a solution to the kernel task issue which is different from the ones mentioned above ?\n\nA: Kernel_task is a dummy process which takes up CPU resources from other applications in order to cool the system down. So I would look at your system's cooling, maybe use fan tools such as Mac Fan Control and perhaps disabling turbo boost with a tool such as TurboSwitcher. Also on some MacBook Pro's you can cool the system a bit by using a TB3 port on the right-hand side to charge from rather than the left.\nSome other issues related to Kernel_task problems.\n\n\n*\n\n*Update software (so bugs get fixed)\n\n*Check for malware. \n\n*Adobe Flash! if you have this uninstall it is well known using up CPU resources.

I am able to connect the Apple TV to my 16\" MacBook Pro using the same USB-C cable fine.\nDoes Apple TV not support outputting to a display over USB-C? Is there anyway to enable?\n\nA: No, the Apple TV does not support outputting to a display over USB-C.

So I think this is more of an Alfred cache or preferences issue.\nTry typing \"reload\" into Alfred to Reload Alfred Cache. I have heard that this can solve this issue with system volume duplicates.\nIf it still happens try to exclude the directory in system preference -> spotlight -> privacy (Spotlight is used by Alfred) and Alfred preferences -> features -> default results make sure the directory isn't in the list and make sure search all file types is unchecked.\nI think the directory is mapped to your actual profile so the things you see are the same. Think of it as the same file from two different angles.\nI am not sure, but perhaps its still there for compatibility because the macOS installation no longer gives the archive option.\n", "Q: Can Adobe Photoshop Elements 2020 app in the App store construct and print multi month wall calendars?

It’s not easy to summarize but I’ll try a TL;DR: I’ve had a wifi network that worked perfectly for over a year. Starting a month ago, every Apple device in my household will repeatedly drop off the wifi network. But a Windows PC that a network tech brought over is able to stay connected to it. This happens with two brands of wifi router, and with most but not all SSIDs we broadcast on those routers. (!?)\nMy main questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can Macs and iPhones have problems connecting to wifi networks where Windows devices are fine? And even where those same Macs and iPhones worked perfectly on the same network for a year?\n\n*If so, is there a way to fix that?\n\n*What else could cause the wifi issues described in detail below, and how can it be fixed?\n\n\nTimeline and details\nAT&T is my ISP. I’m on a 45MBit plan with copper twisted pair lines to my home. For a little over a year, I had an eero mesh network of 3 devices. The AT&T modem (made by 2Wire) was the entry point to the house, but I turned off its SSID. The eero routers were providing wifi to the house. For 13 months it worked perfectly.\nThen in mid-May everything went to hell. On May 18th at 11am, devices started dropping off the wifi. It happens most often in our family room, even when sitting still, 3 feet from one of the mesh routers. It happened on all our Mac laptops and iPhones. (3 Mac laptops, 1 iMac, 4 iPhones, all of varying ages.) I also have a guest staying in our backyard cottage, who has a Mac and an iPad. She is reporting the same problems.\nOne neighbor started having similar problems within half an hour of the same time, even though he's on Comcast. The neighbor in between us installed a new Cisco Meraki router that same day. (Could it cause interference? I asked him to disable it for ten minutes as an experiment, but that didn’t fix our problems.)\nI spoke to Eero support and AT&T support numerous times. Here are some relevant details and things I’ve tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I Option+Click the WiFi icon in the Mac menu bar when sitting in the family room to show debug info, I can see the BSSID change to 00:00:00:00:00 right at the moment my connection drops. It’s easily reproducible: just sit in this room for a few seconds to a minute.\n\n*I made sure my eero mesh routers are not placed too close together to be overlapping. Eero support confirmed this for me.\n\n*Sometimes it shows two copies of my network in the WiFi menu. (Could this be due to having a mesh?)\n\n*When I run WiFi Explorer, it shows occasional drops to zero signal for all my eero devices.\n\n*When I enable wifi on the AT&T modem/router combo and attach Apple devices to it directly, they don’t drop off. (But it doesn’t have enough reach for the whole house and cottage.)\n\n*I’ve run multi-hour ping tests while directly connected via Ethernet to the modem/router combo. The early results were bad: 1.6% packets dropped. But AT&T made some remote fix, and the most recent test has 0.0% packets dropped.\n\n*Eero support said they were noticing some strange drops in the incoming service to their device. But an AT&T tech said my home’s connection to their hub is exceptionally good, with no glitches at all.\n\n*AT&T replaced my modem/router combo for good measure, but the problems persisted.\n\n*AT&T did a board swap at their hub. It still didn’t fix the problem. \n\n*I hired a local network tech and asked him to set up a new system for me. He did: two Ubiquiti access points and a Ubiquiti mesh point out in the cottage. He first set up an SSID called myNetworkTest and one called myNetworkGuest. Once he got them working he said ok, now let's create your main and guest networks with the names and passwords you want, and we’ll delete the test networks. So we set them up. BUT:\n\n\n*\n\n*All Apple devices in the house can connect and stay connected to myNetworkTest with no problem. But for all other networks set up on the same hardware, the Apple devices accept the password but then they just keep trying unsuccessfully to connect.\n\n*His Windows laptop has no problem. It is able to connect and doesn’t drop from any of the networks on the Ubiquiti hardware.\n\n\n*I’ve tried disabling Bluetooth on the Apple devices, in case they are using that to communicate with each other about some network being bad.\n\n*I’ve tried deleting the plist files on my Macs so they forget their old settings\n\n*I’ve tried creating a new Network Location in System Preferences.\n\n*I’ve tried resetting the SMC and PRAM.\n\n\nI’m just at a loss, and so is the network guy I hired. Neither of us has ever seen anything like this. He could rename myNetworkTest to the name I want, but we don’t even know if it will work or make things irreparably worse. Or I could just use the network using that name, since the name doesn’t matter so much. But then I wouldn’t have a guest network, which is important to me because I have guests who stay in the backyard cottage.\n\n\nA: This will be hard to disentangle if you think of it as Apple vs Windows. A couple points.\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS devices are designed to drop WiFi all the time. Screen off, no power, no urgent sync or transfer - WiFi drops. You should be able to isolate your iOS device and you will need to get in to the WiFi radio / router and get precise logs on failed reconnects, RSSI - channel negotiated. Once you have one device and some facts - please post that as one thread and @ me. Then you can look at interference or stats and see what’s up.\n\n*macOS should get you a second pattern of access - it won’t drop unless there’s a problem, is easier to manage sleep and keep it connected for days on end.\n\n*Apple has configuration profiles, packet capture so if you suspect one not working, you can get precise detailed engineering details and know precisely what’s happening - frame by frame, millisecond by millisecond to get answers.\n\n*In general - it’s never mac or windows or ios that causes issues - it’s just one device and fluid nature of baseband code - hopping MCS / encoding / power levels and sometimes channels. All this is invisible, highly technical, easy to get wrong and requires study and tools and setup to be disciplined to get detailed timing and logs. \n\n*Before you do that - look at some summary traffic. For instance, I love my UniFi Dream Machine since it collects 95% of the statistics I need to diagnose failed reconnects, interference, faulty hardware for me automagically. I’ve heard good things on Eero - can you get a 24 hour history report for each of your devices? If you can send 10 GB of data on a device you think is failing to connect - you can be darn sure the radio is fine and the OS is fine and the network stack is fine. If it can’t reconnect - it’s going to be interference and not the device. If the device can’t even run a speed test when conditions are good - then you can suspect the OS or hardware. From your data so far, nothing seems to be client side and I would focus entirely on radio side until you know the radio is seeing a disconnect that doesn’t make sense on the client side.\n\n\nGood luck - my advice is to take a break for a day or three, then pick one device only and get data, set a trap, collect traces. Don’t worry about anything else - it’s all noise and irrelevant. Once you are convinced that device is working and the only thing that can hurt it on WiFi is normal drop and interference, then look elsewhere. The last time I had this it was a USB-C Gigabit ethernet adapter connected to windows. It didn’t have problems since it was wired, but it kicked all the other devices off. In your case, if all the Apple devices are getting kicked - it’s probably not them causing it - they’re just alerting you that something else is the problem. But, why guess or go on hunches - you can get to the bottom of this by looking at one radio on one device and one radio on one AP.\n", "Q: I'm shopping for a used iphone to take to Brazil.

Should I buy GSM or CDMA?\n\nThis answer applies to any country and (technically) any phone.  Therefore, I’m writing it as a canonical answer for future queries of this nature.  \nYou need to find out what type of technology is being used.\nThe best place would be to contact the local carrier.  In Brazil, it’s Vivo, Claro, TIM, and Oi.  You will want to check with them because different carriers use different technologies.  Here in the US, AT&T uses GSM, while Verizon uses CDMA, for example.\nHowever, you can get a good idea of what technologies are being used in a country with the help from the web site GSM Arena.  They maintain a fairly comprehensive database of the different radio types and frequencies used in a particular country.  Below is a screen grab of their entry for Brazil.\n\nHere we can see that for 2G they use GSM, 3G they use UMTS and for 4G the use LTE.  CDMA is nowhere to be found.\nIt’s always best to check directly with your provider (whether it be cell services, email hosting, or even personal services) rather than with “the guy from the Internet.”  My information is accurate today, but I’m not a representative of the company and all of it can change tomorrow.  I’d rather you know how to obtain the correct info rather than hope the info is still correct.\n", "Q: corrupted files, fail checksum but , disk and FS checks with disk utility A couple of files appear corrupted on the SSD drive on my son's MBP, currently on macOS Catalina.\nThey are WAV files which refuse to play and if from a shell I run:\n$ sum -r <filename>\n\nI get \"Input/output error\" on the two offending files, instead of a checksum.\n$ sum -r *\n23188 45843 01 Bombtrack.wav\n58127 58913 02 Killing In The Name.wav\n40298 63213 03 Take The Power Back.wav\n64550 54096 04 Settle For Nothing.wav\n47065 58063 05 Bullet In The Head.wav\n38280 55418 06 Know Your Enemy.wav\n11798 68313 07 Wake Up.wav\nsum: 08 Fistful Of Steel.wav: Input/output error\nsum: 09 Township Rebellion.wav: Input/output error\n17779 68693 10 Freedom.wav\n\nMy concern is that macOS can't find anything nothing wrong with it, and the SMART data checks out. This SSD was a replacement for the original HDD and was fitted at the apple store.\n\n\n*\n\n*I have run disk utility first aid on both the logical and physical volumes.\n\n*The disk utility doesn't find anything wrong with the filesystem or underlying disk \n\n*I'm assuming these two files sat on a corrupted part of the SSD. \n\n\nIn the end, Is there anything else I can do to repair or prevent corrupted parts of SSD from being used?\n\nA: I treat all Input/output (IO) errors as 5 alarm situations. When I see IO in the console log, I save all work, quit all apps and then get a full backup. The filesystem is designed to keep the filesystem intact which means when a file has a problem, the file gets truncated and deleted. Your data loses, the filesystem gets healed. Seeing an IO error bubble up to the application layer is either:\n\n\n*\n\n*no big deal - you have some corrupt files\n\n*a huge deal - you have limited time to back up files that aren’t already backed up\n\n\nThen once I have a backup - I do watch a day or so for IO errors and delete the files that are affected. If I see the IO errors spread, I do an erase installation and keep monitoring. \nSSD are a bit different than HDD so I’ve only seen one SSD ever throw an actual IO error since the controller almost always intercepts and corrects these with checksum. In my experience, 100% of issues are just bit rot, crash and app failures - not that the SSD is starting to show signs of failure. I’ve never had warning of an SSD failing - they just go. Also, the SSD Apple delivers are way, way, way more reliable than the HDD Apple delivered. Erase install is basically a cure-all, get out of jail free card for me in the last 10 years managing Macs. Only when a system can’t install and run a blank OS do I think hardware needs diagnosis and repair.\n\nBack to you, if you don’t have a full backup you trust, please do that now with haste. Next, read up on how to erase. All signs you have indicate your hardware is fine and you might not even find any IO errors in the console app (or using log stream). Since you know exactly how to summon that error - watch the log as you poke at these broken files trying to read / open / checksum them.\nYour instincts to test are perfect - the disk and hardware are almost certainly OK - just may only need to wipe the filesystem and restore good files on to a clean OS when the system can’t self heal itself. The SSD controller maps multiple chained storage cells with data, so TRIM and bad blocks are more about keeping a substantial portion of the space free so that “bad blocks” don’t get hard mapped out like hard drives needed. My understanding is perhaps 10% of the drive can go bad and you won’t lose a block or capacity as far as the operating system is concerned.\n", "Q: Can't open DV video (dvsd) AVI file with QuickTime I am using macOS Catalina. I want to open an AVI file with QuickTime. However, I get an error message saying that the file is not compatible with QuickTime.\nI am able to open the file with VLC. It says that the video codec is \"DV video (dvsd)\". Is there a codec I can install to open the file with QuickTime?\n\nA: QuickTime doesn't accept 'plug-in codecs' any more, not since QuickTime 7.\nThere used to be a plug-in set by the name of Perian, which was the Swiss army knife for QuickTime, but it no longer works.\nYour best bet would be to transcode from VLC or any of the other encoding apps available, if you specifically need it in QuickTime.\nI always think of .AVI as being very much a 'Windows' structure [even if that's not strictly true], so I've avoided it on Mac for many years, or immediately transcode to something more portable.\n", "Q: How to Undo More than Once in Excel for Mac?

Due to ongoing problems with crashing, I recently wiped the hard drive and reinstalled macOS, but I am continuing to have the crashing and hardware issues.\nI attempted to run Diagnostics, but it did not work and I found I had lost the “.diagnostics” folder when I wiped the hard drive. I followed the instructions in this post (Replacing \"apple hardware test\" with \"apple diagnostics\") but the problem that I’m having is I get to the point where I’ve installed the AHTxx.dmg file and found the .diagnostics folder, but I am unable to copy it onto my hard drive. It appears as a faded, grayed out folder which I cannot touch, even though I’ve double checked and it is not locked or anything.\nMy question is, how can I copy this folder into my /System/Library/CoreServices folder in order to be able to run the diagnostics?\n\nA: \nI attempted to run Diagnostics, but it did not work and I found I had lost the “.diagnostics” folder when I wiped the hard drive.\n\nWhen you reinstall, Apple Diagnostics will get reinstalled as well.  If it’s missing, it calls into question how you did said reinstall.  Booting from Recovery, wiping the drive and installing macOS will leave a pristine, fully functional version of macOS on your drive.  If you’re missing things, this was an “out of band” re-install (meaning non-standard).  When that happens, you’ll have the devil’s own time trying to pinpoint the cause of your troubles.\n\nI followed the instructions in this post (Replacing \"apple hardware test\" with \"apple diagnostics\") but the problem\n\nNo!  Don’t do this!  First off, Apple has diagnostic procedures specific to their machines.  You can’t “willy-nilly” change them because you feel one is better than the other.  Even when you upgrade, Apple doesn’t change your diagnostics.  For example, a Mid 2012 MacBook Pro which is capable of running Catalina still uses AHT.  Catalina doesn’t upgrade it to Apple Diagnostics.\nHow do we know this?\nApple tells us in their support document How to use Apple Diagnostics on your Mac:\n\n\nIf your Mac was introduced before June 2013, it uses Apple Hardware Test instead.\n\n\nSecondly, it’s well known that Apple’s diagnostics lose usability with each subsequent version, so “upgrading” to a later version will actually give you less useful diagnostic data.\nUse Internet Diagnostics\nYour Mac has the ability to boot from Internet Recovery; it should also have the ability to boot Internet Diagnostics.  Boot your computer while holding OptionD (obviously you need an Internet connection). This will ensure that you download and use the correct diagnostic utility for your Mac.\nDo a clean, proper install of macOS\nBased on what you described, it sounds like your install is a bit of a bodge.  My advice is to clean things up so you’re  working on a solid footing.\n\n*\n\n*Back up your data. Verify that it’s good\n\n*Wipe your drive clean\n\n*Install the latest version of macOS (Mojave if you need 32-bit app support; Catalina if not necessary)\n\n*Make sure Recovery (hold CommandR) and Diagnostics(hold D) works\n\n*Here, step 5, is where we’re going to figure out what’s causing your crashes.\n\n*Once you have a stable system, use Migration Assistant to move your data over.\n\n*Verify that everything is working as it should.  If so, immediately make a backup and verify.\n\n", "Q: How can I backup all of my files on a Mac? I want to backup all of the files on my Mac. That being said, I do NOT want to do a Time Machine style backup that includes my settings or anything like that. What should I do?\n\nA: If you want easy, connect a drive, set up Time Machine and forget about trying to micro manage settings. It just runs.\nIf you really need to invest in a selective backup, I would still recommend Time Machine and it will have a 120 second count down before it starts the first copy. Turn off Time Machine so you have time to go in and configure exclusions for Time Machine.\n\n\n*\n\n*Exclude System files and applications. (I always exclude those - not sure why that’s not the default other than people might not have good internet to download an installer if they need one.)\n\n*Exclude /Library (since you want settings to not be backed up)\n\n*Exclude ~/Library and any other folders in the home folder you wish to exclude\n\n\nIf you want to be thorough, show hidden files and also exclude /private - these two tips will help you quickly navigate in the open / select dialog:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to show hidden files on mac without Terminal\n\n*How to change path in Finder by entering the path manually?\nThis way you get all the benefits of Time Machine like snapshots, local backups, second-disk backups with rotations possible to multiple destinations (third disk or more destinations are supported) and you can carefully control exactly what folders get backed up.\nOnce your exclusions are set, don’t forget to turn on Time Machine and let it run for the first backup. But really, I recommend backing up everything and not worrying. You’ll save a little space and time once if you exclude System Files so that’s worth it if you decide to do other pruning.\n\nA: Other ways of saving an application will also probably write your current settings.  You can use Carbon Copy Cloner, or Super Duper. You can also backup to iCloud by following the instructions here. If you just want to backup some folders or documents you can copy them to Dropbox, Google Drive, and other similar sites. You could also write everything on to iCloud or a large external drive. To use iCloud you'll probably have to pay to upgrade to 200 GB.\nBut Time Machine is the best.\n", "Q: Why is my 'Harddrive' and 'User' folder shared when I turn on file sharing? Mac to Windows I entered some commands in terminal in efforts of disabling 'Harddrive' and 'Users' folder shared, did not receive much response. What exactly do the commands do?\ncommand:\n1$ sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.smb.server VirtualAdminShares -bool NO\n2$ sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.smb.server VirtualHomeShares -bool NO\n3$ sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist\n4$ sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist\n\nresponce:\n1$ \"password?\" (fill in password)\n2$ \"operation in process\"\n3$ \n4$\n\nBellow is the forum with the terminal commands.\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/376494\n\nA: I’ve never needed any command like that, so I’m not sure what they do. Why not just enable sharing with the GUI and then remove all the shares you don’t want?\nThat takes about 2-3 minutes tops.\nI do love to teach if your goal is to learn those commands in general (and not just to get a result), so what’s happening in the first two commands is you are writing structured values (think environment variables) on windows / unix. \nVirtualAdminShares is FALSE or NO\nVirtualHomeShares is FALSE or NO\n\nThen the load/unload cycles the program so that it will start up and have a chance to read the values you changed.\nJust like environment variables, if the code doesn’t look for that variable or you don’t get the syntax correct - either case it does nothing.\nI don’t get what your second code block indicates, so you might need to copy / paste everything in the command line so we can help debug that. I’m guessing you are not entering the password. If so, try this:\nsudo date\n\nThat should ask for your password. As you type your password (the same one you would use to unlock the system preferences or log out / log in with) that gets you root permissions and should report back the date for the system time. Once you have sudo, then try the other commands within a few minutes and it shouldn’t ask for a password a second time.\n", "Q: What's the difference between rm and empty trash? If I put a file in the trash and \"empty trash\", is that the same as doing rm file?\nI understand that there are questions here asking about (e.g. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]), but no answer directly pertains to the difference in process (if there is one).\n\nA: Yes, rm removes the file as does moving it to trash and then emptying the trash. One nice thing about moving files to Trash is that it gives you a little longer to decide if you really want to delete them. rm will remove immediately.\n\nA: \nIf I put a file in the trash and \"empty trash\", is that the same as doing rm file?\n\nEffectively yes, although the details may vary under the hood. In both cases, the file can no longer be recovered except under certain circumstances1, 2, 3, 4, or perhaps using forensic data recovery techniques.\nThat said, I'd like to offer this as an adjunct:\nI've always liked the concept of \"moving to trash\" because it gives you a second chance. When I started with Unix systems, I was always nervous about using rm... still am in fact.\nAnd so I was very pleased when I found the trash utility for macOS by dabrahams. There was an extensive discussion here on moving files to the Trash folder from the command line, and IMHO, this one was the best.\nOld habits die hard, and so I created an alias - if I enter rm, trash is called. If I'm feeling cocky, and really wish to rm - I have another alias for that.\n", "Q: Add a user that only has access to computer via ssh I'd like to have a user on my local computer to only have access via ssh.  I don't want (don't need) this user to have the ability to login in to the laptop as a standard user.\nThe only purpose for this user is for some web development testing.\nI've already added a user and given Remote login rights to the user ~~but now I'd like to revoke local login rights~~.  I'm trying to remove this user from the initial login screen when I boot up but still allow them to ssh in.\n\nBasically, I want to remove this \"other\" user from the macOS Login Window as a choice of users to log in as but still allow them to log in via SSH.  I want to remove them from this screen  so all that is left is my \"standard\" user.\n\nFrom what I can find, this does not seem possible but I thought there might be a trick to hide the user from the login window.\nIs something like this possible and if so, how would I go about doing it?  I've found ho to manage a number of remote login parameters (ssh key setup, default directory, etc) but can't seem to find out how to disable local login.\n\nThere is a very similar question here: How can I create a user that can login through SSH but not on the local desktop in MacOS X El Capitan? but it is for an older version of the OS.  They try to use a \"Sharing only\" user with no luck.\n\nA: This is actually very possible and Mac SysAdmins need to do it in corporate environments all the time. You cannot use the Apple Users & Groups GUI to accomplish it.  You need to create the account via the /Applications/Utiltiies/Terminal App at the command line using dscl (Directory Service) commands.\nThere's another AskDifferent answer Here:  There are many ways to do this. I'll add a different trick into the mix. We decided to hide all users with UID number below 500 as we have several specialty accounts.  MacOS by default starts creating user accounts with a UID at 501 and increments from there.\nYou might be better off deleting the existing user account and recreating it.  Remember to backup any data the user has saved. It's trickier to convert an account to be hidden.\nHow to create a hidden user account on macOS (current as of Catalina):\nOpen the Terminal App and type these commands carefully and precisely. You are going to need to run these commands using either sudo in front of each or type sudo -s to enter into a root like mode first.\nReplace <username> <password> and <human name> with your specific values.  Yes this is a lot of typing but that's why we script it and push it with an MDM like JAMF Pro. Also I am placing the hidden home folder in /var but there are other places to put it. You could create an actual /home folder off the root if you wish. Don't confuse the /Users on the dscl command that's where user accounts go in the dscl directory (similar to LDAP) and it has nothing to do with the NFSHomeDirectory which is the actual home directory for the user account. (Again, this comes from OpenDirectory, Apple's LDAP).\ndscl . -create /Users/<username> UniqueID 401\ndscl . -create /Users/<username> PrimaryGroupID 20\ndscl . -create /Users/<username> NFSHomeDirectory \"/var/<username>\"\ndscl . -create /Users/<username> UserShell /bin/bash\ndscl . -create /Users/<username> RealName \"<human name>\"\ndscl . -passwd /Users/<username> <password>\nmkdir /var/<username>\nchown -R <username> /var/<username>\n\nOptional: Grant this user admin rights\ndscl . append /Groups/admin Groupmembership <username>\n\nNow we enable to Hide users under 500 UID\ndefaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow Hide500Users -bool yes\n\nThis is optional. When you hide a user there's an Others added to your login screen where you can manually type the username and password to login as the hidden user.  However, you can hide it with the command below by changing it to FALSE.\ndefaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWOTHERUSERS_MANAGED -bool TRUE\n\nNow we create an SSH group\ndseditgroup -o create -q com.apple.access_ssh\n\nThe we make our hidden user a member of that group\ndseditgroup -o edit -a <username> -t user com.apple.access_ssh\n\nIn addition, you can try some of these commands to convert an existing account and hide them.  Primarily the create command with the IsHidden 1 and then hide all users under 500 command and finally change the users UID to say 401 and reboot.  That will hide the user from the GUI and the Fast User Switching and in the Users & Groups.  They will still be able to SSH. Unless the user requires admin rights you should remove that.  You can also lock down the SSH account to only access the Home folder but that depends on a /etc/sshd_config entry and home folder permissions and ownership by root.  Would also apply to SFTP access.  If this user is doing webserver code you could setup Apache subsites for each user so this user doesn't need to get to global /Library/Webserver path.  Could access $HOME/Sites/ instead.  Many options available.\n\nA: It’s not clear what you gain by preventing log in, but I’ll assume you’ve for a good reason to complicate things.\nRemoving “other” from the graphical login screen is easy to do and easy to reverse on Catalina and below. Same with ssh, it’s easy to change the log in method and show the username/password or put back “other“.\nIf you can’t prevent a person with those credentials from sitting in front of the Mac, the first thing that comes to mind is you make a log in item that is a script that logs them out. It will be difficult for them to fix that if you deny them any other credentials to that Mac.\nTo ssh, you need a home folder and the system to have credentials to validate the password and assign UID/GID etc..\nYou can set up LDAP or use a network server and have remote accounts, but the design isn’t likely to work for your case or make sense logistically.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/server/intro-to-accounts-apdcb06a828/mac\nThe matrix covers the differences between where a home folder is stored and how local versus network server vs external account validation happens.\nThe other easy way to have ssh log in without any chance of GUI log in or compromising security is a container. Fire up Docker for Mac and your ssh container is well isolated from the local user accounts.\n", "Q: Using an sd card for extra space on bootcamp I finally got bootcamp working on my Mac so I could play windows steam games on it. The only problem is that I don’t have enough storage on bootcamp to download games from steam and I ran out of space on my Mac to put more space on bootcamp. I bought a 64 gb sd card to fix this, but I can’t figure out how to actually store the sd card storage on my mac. I converted the sd card to an external drive but that still didn’t solve it because I can only partition the sd card and I can’t add it to my mac’s storage. I also can’t add the external drive to my bootcamp storage, and whenever I try to use it on bootcamp (like installing steam on it or installing steam games) it won’t work. Is there any way to just add the external drive to my main Mac storage or to the bootcamp storage? \nSorry for the long rant it’s really frustrating me lol any help at all would be really appreciated!!\n\nA: When working in Windows on Bootcamp, consider using the system entirely as a windows system. So you would want to format the SD card on the windows side. Then use Steam to save to the SD card itself.\nTrying to merge the SD card with your internal storage on either Mac or Windows is going to be a recipe for disaster.\nYou may also want to consider the speed of the SD card when determining which games might play terribly off of it and which may do ok. You can get Blackmagic Disk Speed Test on the App Store for free Blackmagic Disk Speed Test if you want to test it out. Format the SD card for Mac format first using Disk Utility. Test the SD card with Blackmagic. Then test your internal drive as well. Anything over 100MB/s should be reasonable for most games -- less and you may want to consider what to put on the SD card and avoid games that push the drive read/write speeds.\nOnce you're back in windows, erase the SD card again and use something like NTFS format so it's nice and fast.\nThen follow some steps for Steam to save the games you want to the SD card. For example this video on Youtube talks about the exact issue you're trying to do (albeit not on a Mac using Bootcamp).\nSave Steam Games to SD card\nHere are the basic steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a folder on the SD card to store games in\n\n*In Steam, click Steam menu in upper left, choose Backup and Restore Games. Then click Downloads.\n\n*Click Steam Library Folders, then click \"Add library folder\" and browse for the new folder you created above on your SD card.\n\n*Right click the SD card option in that window and choose Make default steam folder. Then new games will be downloaded to the SD card instead of the internal drive.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n", "Q: Deleting Wifidiagnostics file and others under private/var/temp and /folder on Catalina Is it safe to delete the Wifidiagnostics file even though its in private/var/tmp? \nMy understanding was that it's better to leave those folders alone in Catalina but I'm not that experienced a user.\nIn the same folder there's also: configd-pattern.plist, configd-state, configd-store.plist. \nAre those part of that diagnostic test and therefore can/should be deleted as well or are they network configurations? I found conflicting informantions but they were created at the same time of the other one so it seems to me like its related to that log..but it's mostly the log I'd like to delete, its 350mb, its not a lot but it's also not insignificant.\nAnd one more thing, I read that deleting from private/var/folders is supposedly safe compared to the rest, less so /zz (true??)but still. Now I'm not sure that that info is up to date with Catalina, so could it be unsafe as well? \nI'm asking about /folders because I want to delete some remnants from Zoom Rooms, terrible app I uninstalled(which seems to have left quite the leftovers..on a sidenote, if you have suggestions whether there's files related to it that would be better deleted I'd appreciate it, but it's a bit OP tbh)\nIt's under folders/y6/lettersandnumbers/c/us.zoom.ZoomPresence/com.apple.metal which contains 3902 and Intel(R) UHD Graphics 630\n212kb as a whole..def not worth any risks but it feels like useless deletable clutter.\nThank you everybody:)\n\nA: I would say no at this point, don’t mess with /private and instead open a support case if you catch the system not keeping it under 10 GB for a 250 GB disk. Other than swap files which can be controlled by choosing software that’s efficient or periodic restarts, the rest self clean quite well in my experience.\nUnless you’re quite experienced, the risk/reward here has been high risk / low reward.\nFor instance, partial download and staged installers will be cached here, so if you find them and remove them, the system could have issues patching itself as it’s primed to install at restart after confirming a good download. Other things are placed here that speed up the mac greatly - so you just slow down the system as it has to recreate the files you just trashed.\n\nA: It's generally safe to delete items from /tmp (or /private/var/tmp, they're the same thing). Anything that's in the folder is temporary (as the name implies). If you're not doing anything, then the files are more or less left over. Specifically related to the diagnostics file, it's either created by you or another part of the system which requested a network diagnosis. If you didn't create it, it might be set to automatically upload to Apple as a part of their diagnostics & usage. \n/private/var/folders stores cache and temporary data for each user (hence the C & T folders within each user). zz is used for the system, and I wouldn't recommend deleting that unless you know exactly what you're doing. Specifically relating to folders/y6/lettersandnumbers/c/us.zoom.ZoomPresence/com.apple.metal, those files are compiled shaders made by macOS for Zoom. They're safe to delete (as long as Zoom isn't open), and they'll just be recreated next time you launch the app.\n", "Q: Is it possible to test iMessage functionality without another person?

How can I get this scanner working on Mojave?\n\nA: This question is a bit scattered, but if I understand it correctly, you can’t get this scanner to work with your Mac.\nThis scanner is EoL - End of Life\nLooking at the support page for this particular multi-function device, the last version of macOS that was supported was OS X 10.5.x (Leopard) and that version was released in 2009 and support ended in June 2011. The drivers were released for both Intel and PowerPC architectures, the latter being EOL itself since 2006; just about a decade and a half ago at the time of writing this answer.\nDevelopment has (obviously) stopped on this product.  If it were to have TWAIN drivers, it probably would continue to function.  Unfortunately, it requires it’s own drivers provided for by Canon.\nAs far as the Intel drivers go, being that they are so old, they are 32-bit drivers.  If you’re attempting to use this on Catalina, this will be a non-starter as Catalina doesn’t support 32-bit apps or drivers..\n\nPlease tell me the only option is not really to spend $45 on VueScan?\n\nIt’s possible.  I can’t speak to the viability of the software.  While I’m a huge proponent of extracting every last ounce of usability out of a computing device, there are certain types of products that become much more expensive to maintain than it is to simply purchase new.  Scanners and laser printers have consumable parts like pinch rollers (usually made of rubber), stepper motors, and sensors that do fail.  When these items fail especially the rollers - they become dry and hard and no longer “grips” the paper, I usually dispose of the device unless I can find a quality “rebuild kit.”\nPerhaps you can get it working again, but keep in mind, you’ll be spending $45 and in the end, you’ll still have an obsolete scanner that’s nearly a decade and a half old.\nI’d spring for a new scanner.\n", "Q: USB Ethernet to WiFi Internet sharing does not work I have a MacBook Pro Retina 2012 running Mojave.

I had to reinstall Mojave.\nNow I’m trying to use the same setup. MacBook is getting internet from USB ethernet fine. I then shared the ethernet into my WiFi like last time for my Android. The Android connects to the WiFi but this time keeps saying  no Internet. Mac can connect to WiFi, but cannot share internet through it. (I would guess the NAT server is not working or something like it)\nI don't know how to diagnose the problem and fix it.\nPlease suggest.\n\nA: The crash obviously damaged something and it hasn't quite been resolved yet.\nFirst try some simple tasks such as:\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences--> Sharing. Turn off the Internet Connection Sharing option.\n\n*Now go to Network. Then create a new location by choosing edit location and then new location.\n\n*Now add back in your USB Ethernet adapter interface and apply the settings. Then test your internet connectivity on your computer.\n\n*Go back to Sharing and turn your internet connection sharing back on after choosing the Share from choice (USB Ethernet) and Share to choice WiFi.\n\nBesides that, turn off your internet connection sharing, then go back to Network. Try editing your DNS settings on the USB/Ethernet connection and use the public IP addresses for CloudFlare and Google. CloudFlare is: 1.1.1.1  in addition to 1.0.0.1\nGoogle is: 8.8.8.8  in addition to 8.8.4.4\nOnce you have the DNS settings entered and applied, test your internet connection on the computer one more time, then try turning the internet connection sharing feature back on.\nIf it still doesn't work, it may be a much more involved fix.\nYou might have luck by going to Macintosh HD--> Library--> Preferences. Drag the SystemConfiguration folder to the trash (don't empty it as you might need it again), then reboot the computer.\nYour network interfaces and bluetooth settings will probably be wiped out at that point and you can try setting things up fresh.\n\nA: I accidentally found the behaviour while even my android emulator was not having internet. I was using dnsmasq and having 127.0.0.1 as my first DNS server in my Mac. The result was, the NAT server of MAC was not running its own DNS for NAT (which usually should be) but just sending all those DNS servers as-is to NAT clients (emulators and even internet sharing). 127.0.0.1 is useless for NAT client and so internet does not seem to work in those devices.\nAfter I removed that server from my Mac's USB ethernet settings, I was back online on phone (and emulator) through my mac's internet sharing.\n", "Q: In System 6.0.8 with MacWrite 1.0 how do I open a plain text file? I'm using Mini vMac which emulates a Mac Plus (I don't even think I have a Mac Plus anymore, and the SE/30's in the closet probably with leaking caps).\nI've managed to get a copy of MacWrite 1.0, and I've got it emulating a 20 meg hard drive (swapping virtual floppies is somehow worse than swapping the real ones).\nI'd like to open a plain text/ascii file I've imported into the emulator. It shows in the Finder window, but has the plain document icon. If I save a plain-text file with MacWrite, it shows as a document with little black horizontal lines on it.\nIf I ever knew what the difference was, I've since forgotten it. Something to do with resource forks or lord knows what. Is it possible to convert my imported text file such that MacWrite can open it? While it is small, I can't simply type out its contents (nor can I script it inside the Mac emulator as I did outside of it... no scripting environment).\n\nA: The relevant metadata isn't actually stored in the resource fork (per Gordon Davisson). The type and creator codes need to be \"TEXT\" and \"MACA\" respectively. When importing into Mini vMac with its file importer tool, these will be set to \"BINA\" and \"SITx\" which aren't going to let you do anything with it (unless it's an actual Stuffit archive).\nTry the Finder Info tool made for this purpose. It opens with a simple window that has text fields for these two pieces of metadata. Change them. There's no need to click a save button, as soon as you have changed them, they take effect (as with most modern Mac app preferences).\nThe icon for the file should change as well, and it will be openable with MacWrite.\n", "Q: How to download WhatsApp iCloud backup? I read the thread Accessing WhatsApp iCloud backup?\nand did all Kanthala Raghu explained to reveal icloud whatsapp backup in terminal. But what I get is only a list in terminal after typing cd ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/find whatsapp. Like these:\n57TXXXXX~net~whatsapp~WhatsApp\n57TXXXXXX~net~whatsapp~WhatsApp/Documents\nBut how do I download them to my mac ? Now I can only see they exist on the terminal console...thanks for your help\n\nA: The files are already downloaded to your Mac. The folder you're searching is on your local Mac.\nAs explained in the answer you've linked, the backups are stored as tar archives (tar being a program that can bundle multiple files in one archive file). You can do as they instruct:\ncp *whatsapp*/Accounts/*/backup/*.tar ~/AFolderIChoose\n\nCreate the \"AFolderIChoose\" folder in your home directory before running the command. You should then see that folder populated with the backup archives. You can double them in Finder to unpack them.\n\nA: Another way is restore the backup directly on iphone.\n", "Q: How do I give myself full read/write/admin access to Backups.backupdb on a old Time Machine HD I have a hard disk which I don't want to use as a time machine anymore but I do want to delete files on there but I get:\nThe operation can’t be completed because backup items can’t be modified.\nI disabled SIP but it still doesn't let me.\nMy goal is to delete files from this directory that I don't care about and archive it on Amazon Glacier or B2. I do not care for any other system files on there apart from the actual user data. I have nearly 50 backup snapshots on there and I can't seem to delete any files in there.\nIs there a way for me to grant myself full access and just tell MacOS to give me full access.\n\nA: Time Machine is very much an \"all or nothing\" black box, with very little customization or control.\nFiles inside one dated backup folder may actually just be duplicate catalogue entries to the same data as the same 'file' in another dated backup folder. That's why unchanged files don't take up more space each backup, and why TM folders are a huge mass of interconnected trouble.\nDeleting files from one snapshot probably won't save you any space at all, until you've deleted them from all of the snapshots, so that all catalog entries to the file data are removed.\nNormally, the way to delete files or folders from the entire backup is to do so from within the TM application itself. Right-click on the files, and select the option to delete.\nMy advice is to copy one snapshot of the files that you want to keep to another disk, and then delete the whole backup (or erase the disk).\nOh, and don't forget to re-enable SIP! ;-)\n", "Q: Apple Watch locked when restarting after long powered-down state I've kept my Series 5 Apple Watch switched off for a long time and restarted it today.

The goal is to pull an image from tapmusic.net that catalogs my last.fm listening habits from the prior week. The daemon runs properly and is able to execute the script just fine, and the script does exactly what I want it to. The issue is that the job is being executed every day at midnight, not Monday at 7. This is my first time trying out something like this, and I tried to follow templates on developer.apple.com and ones floating around the net, but I'm really unsure of how I can fix this problem.

A daemon is meant to run constantly, while an agent only once.\nSo your .plist file should be in ~/Library/LaunchAgents. Once it is in that directory then you still have to load it using launchctl load <filename>.\nI'm also wondering if you have a leftover process from a previous attempt as the log looks like you have KeepAlive set but not the .plist. That's why the mention of respawn.\nNext, I was wondering about the script path - is the absolute path actually /scripts/lastfm.sh. If you are using the Program key rather than the ProgramArguments key it has to be an absolute path.\nAssuming that you have not loaded into System space but correctly into your user space then I'd start by having a look at what launchctl thinks is happening behind the scenes.\n\n*\n\n*Find out your user ID by running id -u (mine is 502)\n\n*List the information for your job launchctl print gui/502/local.lastfm_chart\nThis will include an event triggers section that should show you exactly when launchctl thinks it should run the command. It will also show you the command, if keepalive is set and other useful information.\nOh, and keep out the RunAtLoad unless you actually want to RunAtLoad. The best way to test things is to give it a kickstart - launchctl kickstart gui/502/local.lastfm_chart will run your service.\nThe same is true with StandardErrorPath and StandardOutPath - rather than constantly changing the .plist file you can use the launchctl debug command to alter these once before you kickstart, so:\n\n*\n\n*launchctl debug gui/502/local.lastfm_chart —-stdout —-stderr will set stdout and stderr to your terminal session for the next invocation of the service.\n\n*launchctl kickstart gui/502/local.lastfm_chart runs it with those settings and then they disappear.\n\n\nA: Your Calendar Interval looks upside down.  Start with the day and then the time.  It should look like this:\n<dict>\n    <key>Weekday</key>\n    <integer>1</integer>\n    <key>Hour</key>\n    <integer>7</integer>\n    <key>Minute</key>\n    <integer>00</integer>\n</dict>\n\nYou also don’t  want the “Run At Load” value set because it will execute the script the moment the plist is loaded like at boot time or upon login.\nAs far as your script goes it looks fine.  There’s nothing in there that will trigger it to run at a particular time as the date function is only being used to populate a variable that’s used in a filename.\n", "Q: How do I sync my photo's from my iPhone to Google Drive?

It runs pretty well now, but is just starting to slow down (and pales in comparison to my 2017 MBP). I'm considering dumping about $400 into it to add an SSD (and run both in RAID0), max out the RAM an replace the thermal sensor. I'm wondering if anyone has done any similar upgrades on a machine with close specs (specifically the age)? If so, did you get the boost in performance you were hoping for or is it just asking too much from a motherboard that old?\n\n**EDIT/UPDATE**\nthere are some awesome answers/comments/info here - thanks everyone... much appreciated. My main goal is to have 2 high-performing machines. Like i said, I have a 2017 MBP that is great and this iMac is still pretty good for my purposes (no gaming or 3d animation). But once this iMac starts having trouble opening big Photoshop files while I have a bunch of files open elsewhere or performing operations in Illustrator on complex drawings (which I'm just starting to see the beginnings of), it's no longer \"high performing\".\nI really like the idea of the Mac Mini, but I can't justify the $800-$1000 expense. I could sell the iMac for probably around $500-$600 (and would have no problem justifying the $200-$400 expense), but then I'd either have to buy another large monitor or live with just 2 24-inchers... which would make me sad, I think.\nI am convinced that putting the $400 into the iMac is not the best idea. So thanks for helping me get there.\nDecisions. Decisions. Gotta mull it over a bit more.\n\nA: Given you’ve already done the work once, you will be the best to know.\n\n*\n\n*SSD - always a great investment, plus they are almost always fungible - you can put them in newer gear with little to no degradation on speed if they still have life.\n\n*RAM - low risk upgrade as well. Especially if you don’t need to max it. Add it only when your benchmarks prove you need it - it’s almost always cheaper to delay buying and only buy when your time to fix the software causing RAM to blow up is worth more to you than the cost of more RAM.\n\nThat being said - the $800 Mac Mini will run circles around your 2011 iMac performance-wise. Especially if your software stack can transition to 64 bit speed and run in Catalina. Some old software, when migrated to new Mac hardware simply can not run. New outclasses substantially in every other way including power efficiency, GPU, storage, CPU, memory, expansion.\nSo for me, the tie breaker is the display - if you love and need it, upgrade or sell to buy a newer but used 27” iMac for value. Also, I have a hunch, a lot of people will want to sell their perfectly good iMacs very soon. This includes Apple if you have cash for new and want to make a deal when the line eventually refreshes. Apple will put machines on the refurbished / clearance rack starting immediately when a new model releases and then again when they claw back all the unsold stock from distributors and retail stores globally. With this bump, I wouldn’t wait and I’d shop to price what you need before next Monday and then have your card ready to buy if you get a short-sale opportunity.\nWith a Mac this old - there will be a very compelling reason to choose to upgrade, decide trade up to slightly less old or “break the bank” for the latest CPU with a T2 chip. Investing in newer everything can be a great value even if you don’t go new at the $400 range.\n\nA: I wouldn’t put that kind of money into this.\nWhy?\nAt the end of the day, you still have a decade old computer that cannot run the most current operating systems\n\n*\n\n*Maxing our the RAM only has benefit if you are making use of the memory. If 24GB was more than enough then 32GB won’t do a thing. It’s like having 3 cars driving on a 6 lane highway. Making it 8 lanes won’t get the cars through any faster or more efficiently\n\n\n*Two SSDs in a  RAID 0 configuration won’t do much   You still only have a SATA III interface at 6Gb/s.\n\n\n*The latest version of macOS is 10.13 (High Sierra) which is quickly becoming long in the tooth. Lots of modern apps are starting to require Mojave or later especially for the newest features.\nPersonally, I would still upgrade the drive to SSD as they’re very inexpensive. However, I’d  run a FreeBSD desktop instead of macOS. I currently have this on a 2007 White MacBook and I’ve gotten some very useful a productive years out of something supposedly obsolete. However, this is pretty much a self-support endeavor so if this isn’t your cup of tea, you might have better luck selling the iMac on the secondary market and putting the proceeds toward a new(er) machine.\n\nA: Apple is dumping Intel processors and going ARM. (An Apple Store employee prognosticated this to me in late 2018). Last two times they did this, they badly burned people who had just bought 68k or PPC Macs. They're handling it better this time by letting it be an open secret, but I would not buy a new Mac for now.\nI'm writing this on a mid-2007 iMac right now, so obviously I'm OK with older hardware.\nWhen your system starts to bog, your first stop is Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor.  It has several panes that will tell you about system health, and that will tell you what you can (or can't) do.\nLeave Activity Monitor running. When the system is bogging, switch tasks to Activity Monitor and see what it can tell you.  It has several \"panes\" which you can switch between; mind you that if you switch away from a pane for 10 minutes or so, it stops monitoring that system parameter (because that monitoring itself adds some load).  So if you're starting something you expect to bog, it helps to pick a pane and have it up while the boggy task is running.\nThe CPU pane\nwill show you how hard your CPUs are working.   That's pretty straightforward.  If all your CPUs are maxed, that's not upgradeable, so your only path is a newer Mac.   If one CPU is maxed, the process is running single-threaded, and sometimes you can do something about that.\n\nThis example shows a process that is mostly CPU-bound but slightly diskbound also (see disk example). Note that on my 2-CPU system, when it uses 50% of the chart height, it is at 100% for its single CPU.\n\nThe Memory pane\nThis is very important (whether you're able to upgrade or not).  It shows an abstracted chart called \"Memory Pressure\" - that's because memory management is tricky - it doesn't just do disk swap, it also will also use ZIP/gz-style compression to compress RAM that is not used in the moment.  \"Memory pressure\" reflects how much both strategies are affecting performance, with a simple green/yellow/red display.\nIn yellow/red, you will feel the lag.  The upgrade path depends on what is taking memory (the task list above will state memory use).  If they are other applications you don't care much about, you can close the windows or quit the apps.  Watch out for apps with \"memory leaks\" - these take an outsize amount of memory for what they are.  In fact, many apps will take a great deal less memory if you save work, close and reopen them -- this applies to many web browsers/pages.\nIf that's not enough, and the core apps you want to run are taking that much memory, then your path is a RAM upgrade.\n\n\nIn this example I kept launching apps until the system started to bog. I wasn't closing anything; the downward ticks were memory compression doing its thing. At yellow I was feeling it! At red it was hard to get the system to respond. Force-quitting Photoshop brought the system quickly back to green.\nThe Energy pane\nIt's not a concern to a non-battery Mac.  It's for Macbooks, and estimates how much battery an app or browser pane is using.\nThe Disk pane\nReflects disk I/O.  It doesn't show a \"0-100%\" scale because it doesn't know how fast your drives are. The display scales to the highest input and output (separately) you've seen lately.\nLook at the \"Data read/written/sec\" numbers.  You just have to learn what \"normal\" values are  for your various drives.  For instance I have some external drives that run around 20-25 MB/s when reading large files, so when I see those kinds of numbers from those drives, I know they are near limits, and my process is probably diskbound (limited by disk I/O).\nOn a hard drive, much of the delay is actually \"seek time\" - moving the head or waiting for the disk sector to come around. That's much more a problem for \"many small files\" than \"few large files\", since hard drives are optimized for large data pushes.  Since you already run SSD, you have already eliminated that, so the only upgrade path is a throughput-faster SSD.\n\nHere you can see a process suddenly max out an external drive.  It's the same time as what you see on the \"CPU\" example (but not the \"Memory\" example). Notice the slight drop in CPU usage just as disk maxed out; that was the process shifting from CPU-bound to disk-bound.\nThe Network pane\nIs telling you about LAN or Internet activity.  It's usually not a big concern when you are chasing performance issues, since you expect the Internet to be slow/capricious.\n\nA: Most points have been covered by other answers: but one point I would make is that whatever you do to this 2011 iMac, you're still limited to High Sierra or earlier.\nSo if you want to run older software, e.g. Office 2011, Creative Suite 6, etc, with as good performance as possible, then that's a reason to proceed.\nBut of course, with each year, the apps available to you will decrease; and your version of Safari will be 'stuck in time' as web standards move on, etc, etc.\nPersonally, I'd sell the old iMac on eBay, and put it towards a new Mac Mini and display. ;-)\n\nA: I've gone through something similar recently. I own a late 2011 Macbook Pro. I was inclined to keep mine - partly for sentimental reasons as it was my first Macbook, and partly because it has the 17\" screen. I also like the fact that it uses a removable hard drive - something that's not been available for years in Macbooks.\nWrt performance and age: I found upgrading memory and using a large SSD helped, but I did that years ago. I seem to recall that they substantially improved \"performance\", but for me \"performance\" is \"quick response\" - not how long it takes to to find prime numbers. And as I don't use my machines for \"gaming\", super-duper graphics performance is not something I'd find essential. But I will say I like the Retina displays - brilliant!\nI liked the answers @bmike and @Allan provided - I think they covered most of the objective trade-offs. One they didn't mention - one that's important to me - is that using older hardware gives you some immunity to Apple's newer software. That view won't be a popular one here, but there have been a few \"issues\" recently. I feel I can avoid many of these issues by sticking with older hardware. And getting back on topic, the older versions of macOS run well on older hardware.\nOTOH, there's no doubt one takes on other issues sticking with older hardware and software. One mentioned in the other answers is this: it will become increasingly difficult to find apps that run on older hardware and older versions of the OS. This is true - I am already seeing this on macOS High Sierra, even though it's not quite 3 years old. Also, Apple will discontinue support of High Sierra later this yearREFERENCE.\nA few other points that I feel favor keeping & maintaining older Apple hardware:\n\n*\n\n*even the vintage 2011 Macs employed the EFI booting system, years ahead of the \"Wintel\" crowd\n\n\n*\"modern\" operating systems are available for older Macs. I've just configured my old Macbook Pro to dual-boot with Linux Ubuntu 20.04. The desktop Ubuntu boots in seconds - very \"quick response\".\n\n\n*support... I need a lot of support :)  And I've found it to be readily available so far. For example, my dual-boot setup required both SE and rEFInd support resources. Apple support OTOH, has been \"iffy\" on occasion.\nI've blethered long enough. Before closing though, I will make this point because actions always speak louder than words: In spite of some negative views, I also own a new-ish Macbook Pro that shipped with Catalina. It's fine as long as I \"stick to the script\", and I do like the hardware and performance. I guess maybe that's the best of both worlds?\n\nA: Since you are doing it for a performance boost - Two things that really give you a performance boost that you will not be able to tap into with your current machine are:\n\n*\n\n*Faster processor;\n\n*Faster RAM.\n\nYou must be already very well aware of your processor. So I don’t think I need to elaborate on that. But your RAM would be somewhere around 800-1600 MHz. The RAM in the latest MBAs and MBPs is 3733 MHz.\nFor that itself, I’d recommend investing in a modern machine rather than in your older one.\n", "Q: Mac reboots randomly with this crash dump (in watchdogd?) panic(cpu 2 caller 0xffffff7f8f8f9ad5): userspace watchdog timeout: no successful checkins from com.apple.WindowServer in 120 seconds\nservice: com.apple.logd, total successful checkins since wake (141121 seconds ago): 14113, last successful checkin: 0 seconds ago\nservice: com.apple.WindowServer, total successful checkins since wake (141121 seconds ago): 14101, last successful checkin: 120 seconds ago\n\nBacktrace (CPU 2), Frame : Return Address\n0xffffffa41eedb720 : 0xffffff800ed1f5cd \n0xffffffa41eedb770 : 0xffffff800ee58b05 \n0xffffffa41eedb7b0 : 0xffffff800ee4a68e \n0xffffffa41eedb800 : 0xffffff800ecc5a40 \n0xffffffa41eedb820 : 0xffffff800ed1ec97 \n0xffffffa41eedb920 : 0xffffff800ed1f087 \n0xffffffa41eedb970 : 0xffffff800f4c2838 \n0xffffffa41eedb9e0 : 0xffffff7f8f8f9ad5 \n0xffffffa41eedb9f0 : 0xffffff7f8f8f97fa \n0xffffffa41eedba10 : 0xffffff800f454a8e \n0xffffffa41eedba60 : 0xffffff7f8f8f8cfe \n0xffffffa41eedbb60 : 0xffffff800f45dcb3 \n0xffffffa41eedbca0 : 0xffffff800ee082b2 \n0xffffffa41eedbdb0 : 0xffffff800ed25328 \n0xffffffa41eedbe10 : 0xffffff800ecfbcc5 \n0xffffffa41eedbe70 : 0xffffff800ed12aa2 \n0xffffffa41eedbf00 : 0xffffff800ee30d05 \n0xffffffa41eedbfa0 : 0xffffff800ecc6226 \n      Kernel Extensions in backtrace:\n         com.apple.driver.watchdog(1.0)[B435C72B-B311-3C67-8AA1-1D5CE0FAD429]@0xffffff7f8f8f8000->0xffffff7f8f900fff\n\nBSD process name corresponding to current thread: watchdogd\n\nMac OS version:\n19F101\n\nKernel version:\nDarwin Kernel Version 19.5.0: Tue May 26 20:41:44 PDT 2020;

In my case I just deactivate Sharing folders, Drag and Drop and No audio. However my iMac was still rebooting sometimes after immediate wake up from suspend.\nSo I reinstalled Catalina but didn't restore the TimeMachine backup. After Catalina was installed I created my user session and restored my personal files with iCloud (200GB subscription); the lager files were copied from the TimeMachine using Finder.\nNow I can leave the iMac in suspend mode all the day waking up it several times and no BSD. Also I installed again VirtualBox but I didn't activate Sharing Folders, audio and drag and drop. What I can tell you is that sharing other devices with the VM like bluetooth sometimes reboot the machine.\nUbuntu VM seems to be working fine but RedHat/Oracle Linux VM crashes more frequently.\n\n\nA: The problem with one panic report is you don’t know if this program caused the issue or just was the first program to break a leg when it fell in to the open void left when the actual culprit removed the man hole cover, so to speak.  You could be just blaming the victim if you assume a problem exists in the watchdogd process.\nUntil you’re sure what’s causing this and can reproduce it, you may be better off following some excellent guidance to be sure it’s not a known bug or something being caused by a peripheral.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200553\n", "Q: MacOS Apple Maps: Can I show street numbers?

I'm wondering if the 1m Apple USB C cable can charge the 13 inch MacBook Pro safely at full speed (i.e. 60W). From my knowledge, all certified USB C cables support 60W charging, which means it should. However, it's really hard to tell if that's actually the case from the website, because the only thing it says on that site is that it's \"recommended for use with the iPad Pro and the 18W power adapter.\"\nI know that the 2m Apple USB C cable is able to provide up to 100W of power; however, I am interested specifically in the 1m cable which comes by default with iPads.\nI have been looking at Apple support articles and none of them mention anything about this cable—they only talk about the 2m cable.\n\nA: Yes.1\n\n1 In practice, my experience is yes. Every single iPad cable has not been an issue for charging any iPad and 13 Inch MacBook Pro and MacBook One.\n\nA: @bmike's answer is correct, but there are some details to be aware of with USB-C cables:\n\n*\n\n*In some cases, USB-C cables not made by Apple will not work properly (or even at all) with Apple hardware & chargers.\n\n\n*In some cases, Apple-manufactured USB-C cables will not work with other devices.\nWhy? Apple must have cables that are e-Marked, and other devices may require non-e-Marked cables.

I had a look at man diskutil already but this doesn't seem to have all the details required. So I'm kind of stuck right now, any help appreciated.\n\nA: Use newfs_apfs(8) to format a partition with a new APFS filesystem, i.e. to create a new APFS container. For example:\nsudo newfs_apfs -e -v \"My APFS Container\" disk0s2\n\n\nWith diskutil, I find that just entering the diskutil command itself and reading the help that it outputs is more accessible than the manpage. You can do this for subcommands, too; eraseVolume is the subcommand you're interested in, and you can enter diskutil eraseVolume to get help on how to use this subcommand.\nThe eraseVolume subcommand will overwrite a partiton with a particular filesystem — it will use the relevant newfs_* command behind the scenes, thus serving as a general interface to all of the newfs_* commands — or leave the partition unformatted. diskutil listFilesystems will show you the valid filesystems you can specify. For example:\ndiskutil eraseVolume APFSX \"My APFS Container\" disk0s2\n\nAlternatively, if you wish to reformat a partition that has an existing filesystem, keeping the same filesystem type and filesystem label / volume name, you can use the reformat subcommand instead. For example, if disk0s2 is already a case-sensitive APFS container with the name My APFS Container that may already contain data or is broken, and you just want a clean slate, then the above eraseVolume command is equivalent to:\ndiskutil reformat disk0s2\n\n(Note that diskutil needn't be run with sudo.)\n", "Q: What file is responsible for saving window position?

It happens.\nWhat was key here is that you attempted to connect to an unsecured network.  One methodology I try to teach to new techs is to take things down to the \"lowest common denominator.\"  Getting connected in a basic state (like with no security) establishes a baseline - there are no other factors that could get in the way like keys, certificates, etc.  If you can't connect there, you have a physical issue.\nNext, you tried a different network router.  If the problem exists in two different places, the odds of it being your network go down substantially - like next to improbable.\nYou did go a bit beyond in your diagnostics, though...so just some feedback for the future:\n\n*\n\n*resetting the WiFi router is good, but not entirely necessary.  Hypothetically, if you didn't own the network you wouldn't be able to reset it.\n\n\n*changing the SSID and/or password.  Not necessary.  The SSID is just text and the password is just a key.  The radios in the access point (router) and in your iPhone don't care what text characters are being broadcast that identify the network.  Doing the unsecured network addresses this\n\n\n*forgetting the network and rejoining.  This is excellent.  Doing this in conjunction with the unsecured network will tell you a lot!\n\n\n*multiple routers and ISPs.  Excellent on the different router (as elaborated above) but it's not necessary to change an ISP.  The radios don't care if you use one ISP over another the same way your car doesn't care if you use one interstate or another.\nAll in all, excellent diagnostic work, but undesirable diagnosis.  It looks like it's time for an upgrade.\n", "Q: Change subtitles on Apple TV? How can I change the subtitle language on an Apple TV?\nI’m using the iPhone Remote app as the remote.\nThe Apple TV is 3rd gen.\n\nA: Slide down with one of your fingers inside the area representing the touch surface in the Remote app on your iPhone and a menu including Info, Subtitles, etc. should appear at the top of the video playing on the Apple TV.\nMove to Subtitles using the touch surface in the app again and move onto and tap on any of the subtitle options that would appear. If the menu at the top of the video does not disappear after choosing a subtitle, tap on the MENU button in the app so that the menu at the top of the video disappears.\n\nA: The solution is to do a “long press” gesture on the area representing the touch surface.\nSometimes this doesn’t work though, which I consider a bug. Rebooting the Apple TV might help in that case.\n", "Q: Turn off power output from a USB Type C Monitor I'm currently using my MacBook Pro with an external Benq Monitor (4K HDR) with a USB-Type C connection.\nThe problem is that it's also simultaneously charging my laptop over this same connection and the amount of power it can supply is much less that what my laptop needs.  So, it doesn't charge properly.\nNow, what I would like to do is disable the power output from the monitor and have the laptop only take charging from the Apple power adapter.\n\nA: Just plug in a “larger” power adapter like the one your Mac came with.  It’s not that it will use both simultaneously, but instead it will select the charger that’s delivering the most current.\nWhat happens if you plug more than one charger in the new MacBook Pro (2016)?\n", "Q: Why does backslash work for file or folder names, but question mark less so? I created a HTML file as this name on Sierra 10.12.6: test\\55.html and it showed up in the address bar of Firefox as:\nUsers/MYNAME/Desktop/test\\55.html\n\nI then made a duplicate as test?\\55.html and it rendered in the browser as:\nUsers/MYNAME/Desktop/test%3F\\55.html\n\nIf naming files, why does backslash seem to work?  I know forward slash (/) doesn't and renders as :: in Finder, but for backslash and question mark, why do these work in Finder and should they be avoided in filenames?\nI'm on HFS, not APFS, so does this relate to it, and in Mojave, would the problems around these not exist?\nIf anyone can answer I'd be grateful for this; done some basic research but am not fully sure.\n\nA: Characters to avoid in filenames\nYou shouldn't be using slashes or question marks in your filenames.  This can cause issues depending on the operating system/file system being used.\nThere's already an excellent answer in SuperUser What characters are safe in cross-platform file names for Linux, Windows and OS-X addressing this, but to summarize:\n\n*\n\n*forward slashes are used to separate values in the path in *nix operating systems\n\n*back slashes are used to escape spaces in file names in *nix operating systems and as path separators in Windows.\n\n*Windows does not like \\/:*?\"<>| in paths or filenames.\n\nAs for the \"double colon\" (::) this is a convention used by Finder to represent the home directory.  The single colon is a path separator.\nQuestion Marks (and other characters) in URLs\nThis is not a good idea. First off, Windows users (the browsers actually) are going to have a hard time with the the file with the question mark.  Secondly, The question mark indicates a query string in PHP meaning, you're sending the PHP language a query or a command to execute.\nFor instance, take a look at this URL:\nhttps://www.bing.com/search?form=MOZLBR&pc=MOZI&q=php+url+question+mark\n\nPutting an arbitrary question mark in the file name of the URL will definitely throw a monkey in the wrench.\nAdditionally, you're not \"escaping\" characters in the URL with the percent sign - it's called \"Percent Encoding or URL Encoding.\"  This allows you to use special or reserved characters (like a space) in the URI and have it be functional.\n\nA: This has nothing to do with HFS, APFS or macOS Mojave really. It is simply the way URLs in any browser work.\nURLs can have an optional query component that is marked by a single question mark (?) character. What comes after the question mark is the query part of the URL.\nAs your file name is not the query, but rather the actual name of the file - the question mark in the file name needs to be \"escaped\" (i.e. translated) so as to convey the full name without the browser thinking this is the query component of the URL.\nEscapes in URLs start with a percent sign (%) and then the hex-codes character code for the character to escape - in this case 3F which is the question mark character. This is also known as \"percent encoding\".\nThe reason this is called \"escaping\" is that you're \"breaking out\" of the normal meaning that the characters following the escape character (%) would otherwise have had. In this case your file name does not contain the letters 3 or F, they have a different meaning because of the escape character %. RFCs 1738 and 2396 (URL \"standards\") explicitly call this escaping, whereas the newer RFC 3986 uses the term \"percent encoding\" in order to distinguish this particular form of escaping from others.\nAs for the backslash character, it has no special meaning in an URL today - so it is just treated like any other character. On macOS it also doesn't have a special meaning (whereas the forward slash is used as a directory seperator in some cases).\nNote that pre-2005, it was recommended that the backslash character is escaped in URLs, but that is not necessary anymore. You might see some (older) software do just that with URLs. The escaped and non-escaped version has the same meaning, so it doesn't make any practical difference.\n", "Q: Can I view uploaded photos on iOS? iOS offers some automatic albums out-of-the-box (e.g. selfies, panoramas, etc.). However, I see no \"uploaded\" album. I have always found this inconvenient, and today I found out that Android has albums with the photos uploaded to each service (Messenger, WhatsApp, etc). Is it possible in any way for me to see (and ideally also delete) all photos ever uploaded anywhere?\n\nA: No, the Photos app does not offer a computed \"Uploaded\" folder that automatically gathers all photos ever uploaded across services.\nThere's also no other place in the system, nor any log file in the system, that automatically gathers a list of photos uploaded to services via apps on the device.\n", "Q: Mac crashes when I'm using Visual Studio Code + Chrome Since the Catalina update in May, whenever I'm using Visual Studio Code for an extended period of time, upon saving my work my laptop crashes, saying there has been an error.

If it works there, they’re happy with it.\n\nI updated, uninstalled, and reinstalled Visual Studio Code (the update didn't fix the problem, obviously reinstalling didn't either)\n\nVSCode is used extensively on Mac’s without problem so immediately  pointing to it is like saying your car keeps stalling so a) replace and reinstall the motor and b) stop carrying thise groceries from that popular store in your trunk.\nDiagnostics\nBefore reinstalling the OS, start off with Safe Mode.  It disables all 3rd party apps, kexts (drivers) and daemons (background processes) do you’re only running “pure” macOS.  IF the problem goes away, it’s something that’s being loaded.\nA little deduction\nThanks to the log you posted, we can see that a daemon Adobe CEF Helper seems to be causing issues.  I would start by uninstalling or disabling Adobe and see how things work out (judging from the comments, you found the problem and fixed it!)\nGoing forward, if you run into something like this, always start in Safe Mode to help eliminate problems.  Reinstallation is usually the last thing you should do when diagnosing a problem\n\nA: Disable GPU acceleration with -- flags when starting chrome based gui software, search for current chromium flags with GPU in name.\nStart the app from terminal within .app dir /Applications/SomeApp.app/Contents/Mac../binary_name --flagName\niGPU is causing problems here and there but a kernel panic is unusual.

I've left it for hours (allowing it to download and update itself), but nothing happens.  I then manually relaunch the app only to find that nothing was updated and in a few minutes the same update notification appears.\nThe only way I've been able to update VS Code is by manually downloading the new version and installing it on top of the existing one.  This was happening with v1.42.1 as well and I thought an update would fix it.  Unfortunately, it hasn't.  This was a clean install of VS Code on a clean install of Catalina in March 2020.  Catalina is up-to-date at 10.15.5\nDoes anyone know how I can fix this issue of it not updating as it's supposed to?\n\nA: Is the app still in the Downloads folder? If so, try moving it to the Applications folder and see if that fixes it. If that doesn't work, then try running the following commands in Terminal:\nsudo chown $USER ~/Library/Caches/com.microsoft.VSCode.ShipIt/*\nxattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Visual\\ Studio\\ Code.app\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/7426#issuecomment-277737150\n\n*Also See Visual Studio Code docs page under \"Common questions\" → \"VS Code fails to update\"\n\n", "Q: Is there enough room inside a MacBook Pro 16\" to fit a slim Tile? I'm thinking of upgrading sometime in the future to a 16\" MacBook Pro. As someone who keeps my Mac with me on the go, I'm very cautious and alert, but still want to plan for the possibility that it might get taken.\nI'm wondering if there's enough room somewhere under the bottom cover to fit one of those ultra slim Tile tags. It would go completely undetected long enough for the laptop to be tracked down, even if Find My Mac wasn't able to phone home.\nAs janky as it sounds, any smart thief would sit and try around T2 and macOS to disable things, or avoid connecting to the internet. But a random Tile stuck inside the battery compartment is the last thing most of them will think to look for, especially if it blends in with things.\n\nA: No, you can’t fit them.  I have a 2014 MacBook Air and my wife’s friend has those tile key dongles. I folded a piece of paper until it was about the same thickness.\nI opened the back and tried to find a place to fit it. Even by the battery where I thought there would be room made the back cover not fit. I was using paper which is more flexible than the plastic tile and I was afraid it would break something. I would definitely not do this\nIf you want to still use the tile, maybe you could hot glue it to the outside. I like hot glue here because it will stick good and when you want to remove it, it won’t hurt the Mac. I know this because my daughter hot glued rhinestones to her MabBook lid and it didn’t do any damage.\n", "Q: How can I customize the right click menu? With macOS 10.13.6, I'm trying to change the menu item pointed out by the red arrow.\nIn TextEdit:\n\nin Chrome\n\nI tried the steps on a post, which is based on the existing services in Shortcuts, while my goal is to customize that item to \"look up that selected words on the Cambridge Dictionary\". Can someone help me on this?\nIf typical preference setting cannot do that, is it possible to do that\nby modifying system plist or by programming for it?\n\nA: You can't change what the Context menu item does in so far that it is fixed to look up a word in the macOS dictionary.\nYou can't even change it to use a specific dictionary.\nYou can, however, make some changes. The look up that is done is according to the preferences of the Dictionary app and it is possible to change the dictionary used to another that Apple makes available, such as switching from British to American dictionaries.\nTo do this open the Dictionary app and select Preferences... in the 'Dictionary' menu and you will see a list of dictionaries that can be enabled or disabled as you wish.\n", "Q: Is there a way to set an alarm for sunrise, whenever that may be? The title pretty much says it all.  I've been wanting a \"Sunrise alarm\" for some time, but have never been able to find a way to do it - at least not a free one.  In addition to much experimentation with the built-in alarms, I've tried I think every free app in the store that claims to do this, and literally not a single one has worked (they all fail in various horrendously bad ways).\nIs there a free way to set a simple sunrise alarm?  Failing that, is there any low-cost (like under $5) app that will actually do this well, and works on iOS 12?\n\nA: You can create a shortcut within the Shortcuts app for this.\n\nThe coordinates in the first command need to be replaced with those of the location you need the alarm for.\nPS: The alert will show the UTC time, but the alarm itself will be created in the local timezone of the iPhone/iPad\n\nA: I just discovered that this is built-in to the Amazon Alex app.  You can create a \"Routine\" that triggers on sunrise or sunset (or a variety of other things of course) based on any given location.  Can do a lot more than a simple alarm too... can trigger home automation devices or do all kinds of other stuff.\n", "Q: What is the network interface 'llw0'?

You can look it up like this:\nskywalkctl list-providers | grep llw\n\nYou'll see that it is handled by a BCM \"driver\" (i.e. an IC in your computer manufactured by Broadcom).\nThe interface is supposed to be there - it is not a bug.\nSimilar to how awdl (that you mention) is a special kind of WiFi connection that is peer-to-peer and low-latency (used for AirDrop for example) - llw is also a special kind of WiFi connection that is low-latency (no power saves allowed), but with an access point.\n", "Q: High CPU usage for WindowServer process in Activity monitor On my Macbook Pro 13\" 2020 model, WindowServer is constantly eating away 20% to 40% CPU.\nTried the usual recommendations, but none help.

But if it's getting in the way, you can try one of the following approaches.\n\n*\n\n*Instead of clicking using Mouse/Trackpad, you can use the keyboard shortcut Command + L to move focus to the address bar. Doing so also selects the current website address, so you can immediately start typing to enter new website address or search query.\n\n\n*You may consider enabling Show full website address setting under Advanced tab of Safari preferences. This would show the full address of the current webpage and may also move the padlock towards left in the Smart Search Field/Safari Address Bar thereby reducing the possibility of accidental click.\nP.S.: The lock icon is shown in the address bar (officially named the Smart Search Field) for a good reason. You should be cautious when the padlock icon is missing.

To give some background, the reason I want to know this information is because, I recently bought a brand new SSD to place into a 2009 Mac mini, where I want to install Kubuntu. I know that PCs store their BIOS in the motherboard ROM, but not entirely sure for Macs.\nThe problem I have is that if I swap the internal HDD (without copying data to the new SSD) in the Mac, will it mean I can't boot from USB when I have swapped out the hard drive, as the USB boot menu will be wiped, or is this menu stored somewhere else, meaning that I can still access it without copying my hard drive data to the new SSD?\n\nA: There really isn’t any difference between where the EFI holds the boot info from pre 2009 and post 2009 Macs\nBasically, the boot manager resides in the EFI which of similar to the BIOS in a PC. It’s just the bootable part that loads the kernel is located on the drive itself.  So, you can put a blank SSD into a Mac and the boot loader will work, it just won’t find anything to load.\nNow the difference in pre and post 2011 Macs (generally speaking) is if the Mac supported Internet Recovery or not. If it did, you could load an operating system (Recovery) off the Internet even with a blank SSD. If you can’t use Internet Recovery, you’ll need bootable media like a DVD or USB stick to install the OS. Once the OS is installed, you’ll her a boot partition and a Recovery partition that you’ll be able to see and select with the boot manager (by holding Option  when booting).\nSo bottom line, even if you have a blank SSD in your Mac, if you have a bootable volume attached (like to USB) the boot manager will find it and boot from it or display it as an option (holding Option when booting )\n\nA: Yes, if you put a blank SSD inside, you will still be able to boot to an external USB.\nAny Recovery Partition would be on the old disk; but the bit you need just to boot up a volume is elsewhere on the board.\n", "Q: Turn off power to Thunderbolt device while leaving data connection As per the title, is it possible to do this?\nI have two devices using Thunderbolt 2 ports on a macbook pro. One, an audio interface, makes the area around the port excessively hot to touch and can cause the fans on the laptop to kick in at a certain point.\nI was unsure why only one device caused this when the other (an external display) didn't and realised that the audio interface was also drawing power. The thing is, it doesn't need to. It can be powered externally and I do this. But it automatically chooses a preference for thunderbolt power and switches to this when enough is available.\nI'd love to know a way to provide no power over that Thunderbolt port so that it relies on the external power supply and stops generating so much heat (the fans kicking in when I'm recording audio - it being an audio device that's causing this - is far from ideal).\n\nA: Per the thunderbolt specification, it includes power so if you could turn it off, it wouldn't be thunderbolt. I suppose a device on the receiving end could have a switch or power control to disable draw, but I have not seen any hardware that assumes anything but you get power at the same time / before any data connection comes alive on thunderbolt.\nIt's an interesting thought experiment to think if we had this to help troubleshoot, but not something I see as practical. You'd need an oscilloscope and trace to determine what's happening in your setup if you can't measure voltage lines with a multimeter.\nSome USB devices have external power and won't draw as do some rack mountable thunderbolt audio devices but they never draw power from TB so you might need to look in that direction if you can't isolate it by swapping in and out parts entirely.\n", "Q: Does Apple make backups of iCloud? Photos have been deleted from an iPhone which had iCloud Photo Library turned on so photos were deleted from iCloud as well. Does Apple store backups of iCloud to restore its state at a previous date ?\n\nA: Apple support engineers do have access to longer retention and backups even if you intentionally take action to delete all photos, then delete them from the deleted items section and dismiss the warnings that may present.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.loopinsight.com/2020/06/18/user-deletes-all-their-photos-from-icloud-and-how-apple-used-some-magic-to-get-them-back/\nI would not count on them having a long time period (weeks or longer would be long) to help rescue your photos and would contact them as soon as you can if you discover you don’t have a local backup of the photos that are now deleted or if your library becomes corrupted.\n\nA: \nDoes Apple make backups of iCloud?\n\nFrom an infrastructure management perspective, yes they do. However, it’s not something consumers can access alone and it’s not something Apple support staff and engineers can access alone. Their backups are for service continuity; if something on their servers crash, they can be to and running again. They also have some automation in case people inadvertently make a choice to delete files not realizing that deletion is permanent. Due to how the encryption keys are stored, you would need to create a support pin and then explicitly give Apple consent and a key to unlock your files. Think of a bank offering to store your lock box in their vault. They can look at your box, but may not have the key to open it.\nCan you access this back up?  No. It’s not for users. In fact, every Apple account is encrypted meaning Apple can’t make sense of the files without your help.\nFrom the customer perspective (yours) iCloud is a synchronization service. If you delete photos, it’s assumed you wanted them gone. Now, you can use iCloud for your own backups, but that’s something you have to setup and manage (For example, my iPhone is backed up to iCloud including photos on it).\nIMO, iCloud is good, but not as mature as OneDrive or Azure. In those services, not only do I get the synchronization services like iCloud, but I can purchase a backup plan and even specify where I want it (I could be in the east coast of the US and my data gets backed up to the west coast or even Europe!)\nPersonally, when it comes to Photos, I have them in the cloud, on my NAS and then backed up from the NAS to a USB drive, so 3 places. Having your own backup is the ideal case as you would not depend on support for recovering files you could have backed up.\n\nA: Not sure whether it's officially known if Apple does or doesn't make backups of the data stored in iCloud (I would assume they do). But even if they do there is no enduser access to it so you can't use it to recover lost data.\nYou may be able to get your photos back from the \"Recently Deleted\" album within Photos if the deletion took place in the past 30 days (and you didn't empty the album manually).\nPS: It's important to keep in mind that iCloud basically is a syncing solution, not a backup solution. So having a dedicated backup in addition to it is always recommended.\n\nA: Thank you for clarification and recommendations. The problem indeed is that Apple offers both a synching service and backups through the same cloud and that is misleading users. The worst part is that if one doesn't use iCloud Photo Library (presumably photos are then only on 1 device) then photos are included in the backup...\n", "Q: FTDI Driver 2.4.2 I just updated my computer to Mac OS 10.15.5 (Catalina)\nOnly I can't get my Ired 2 software to work because I have to install FTDI Driver 2.4.2 (64 bits)\nSo I installed FTDI Driver 2.4.2 but it was not recognized by my computer.\n\nI want to run IrTrans Usb and Ired2\nBut when I launch Ired 2 the serial and firmware is not recognized!\nYet the inputs are well recognized in usb\n\n\nA: You'll need to contact the developers of the driver, and ask for a version that works on Catalina.\nCatalina has introduced security features and changes to the way that third-party kernel extensions are handled.\n", "Q: How to disable Camera and Screen Share for all applications (globally) in mac Using MDM?

But I am not able to see the title of the website.\nWhen I open the same website in Google Chrome I can see the title for the website such as \"Online Shopping site\" in the title bar. But I want to use Safari because I think my MacBooks battery drain very quickly when I am using Google Chrome.\nIs there not way to see website title in Safari like in Google Chrome?\n\nA: Safari displays the website title in what it calls the Tab Bar. You apparently have the Tab Bar set to hidden.\nTo show the Tab Bar, open Safari on your computer, select View → Show Tab Bar in the Safari menu and the Tab Bar should now appear.\n\nSelecting Show Tab Bar would enable Safari to always display the Tab Bar. It would work even after you quit and relaunch Safari.\nYou should now be able to see the website title easily.\n", "Q: Resize APFS partition and move it to another hard drive I have a 500 GB external USB disk that contains a 465GB \"APFS container\", with Mac OS X Catalina, bootable (with the trick \"Press and hold the Option (Alt) key immediately after turning on or restarting your Mac\")\nI need to use this disk for something else, and I need to move it to another 320 GB disk.\nHow to do that?\n\n*\n\n*First how to shrink the 465 GB to 300 GB (only < 100 GB are used)? Is it possible from another Mac OS High Sierra computer or another Linux or another Windows computer?\n\n\n*Then how to copy the partition to the 320GB so that it will still be bootable?\n\nA: Apple documentation states you should be able to replicate a bootable APFS container to a new drive. Unfortunately, the GUI based software from Apple is wrought with bugs. Below are the steps I preformed to successfully clone Catalina macOS 10.15.5 to a new USB drive. To be honest, I admit this was tested using a VirtualBox virtual machine.\n\n*\n\n*Boot to macOS Recovery. I booted to the macOS Recovery APFS volume on the 465 GB USB drive.\n\n\n*Plug the 320 GB drive in a USB port\n\n\n*Open the Disk Utility.\n\n\n*Under the View pulldown, select Show all Devices.\n\n\n*Highlight the 320 GB Drive, then select the Erase button.\n\n\n*Use the selections shown below, then select the Erase button.\n\n\n\n*Quit the Disk Utility, then open the Disk Utility.\n\n\n*Highlight the MyNewUSB volume, then select the Restore button. From the Restore from pulldown list, select the existing external USB macOS volume, as shown below. When finished, select the Restore button.\n\nNote: This will replicate the macOS, macOS - Data, hidden Preboot and hidden Recovery volumes.\n\n\n\n\n*When finished, quit the Disk Utility, then open the Disk Utility.\n\n\n*Visually, check the results.\n\n\n*Quit the Disk Utility.\n\n\n*Shutdown the Mac.\n\n\n*Unplug the 465 GB USB drive.\n\n\n*Start the Mac and immediately, hold down the option Key until the Mac Startup Manager icons appear.\n\n\n*Hold down the control key and select to boot from the 320 GB USB drive. Note: This first boot took longer than normal.\n\nA: You can't really copy a partition, you just copy everthing thats in one partition to another partition of appropriate size. You should make a 320 GB partition on your new drive. Since you are only using 100 GB on the 465 GB partition you can copy everything in the 465 partition to the 320 partition. Just select everything and copy it using the Finder. To make the 320 GB drive bootable, you must install the system of your choice. You can istall the system in your 320 GB partition.\nIf your trying to copy to a different machine, after you copy everything to the 320 GB drive connect it to the other machine and move the data.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro will only charge if using a 3rd party adapter after battery replacement I’m  having a bit of a weird situation. After running a program that really seemed to overheat my computer, a few days after my charger stopped charging my 13” Late 2012 Retina MacBook Pro.\nIt was really old and had some inner wire visible so I figured it was the charger and decided to change it. Without doing a ton of research, i just ordered the best reviewed adapter on Amazon.  When I plugged it in, it didn't turn on but eventually did a SWC and it began charging, however the LED turned green and but the battery seemed to be dead. If it was unplugged the computer would die.\nThinking I needed a battery replacement and having originally thought that Apple no longer supported 2012 because of vintage, I ordered a 3rd party battery from Puredick as well as one from NewerTech at OWC.\nI replaced the battery and had some issues with it working and read about the dangers of using a 3rd party adapter. I ordered a new OEM 65W adapter through Apple,  however once I got the battery working, the OEM adapter wouldn't charge. The third party adapter continues to charge it regularly.\nI realized it was an 85W adapter so thinking maybe the battery needed a higher wattage, I ordered a second 85W adapter through Apple and that also, did not charge. The behavior was the same for both 3rd party batteries as I tried swapping them out thinking they might be the cause of the issue.\nEverything else runs normally except for the fact that the OEM adapters will not charge the Mac while the 3rd party charger will. I'd like to avoid using the 3rd party and I’m worried that this might be a sign of something else wrong With my Mac or that continued use of my 3rd party adapter will exacerbate the problem.\nHow can I solve this weird problem of genuine chargers not charging, but 3rd party chargers will?\n\nA: If you have two genuine Apple MagSafe chargers and neither with charge/power you MacBook Pro, but a knockoff charger will, there’s an issue with your MacBook.  More than likely, it’s the DC-In board.\nHow it works.\nIn the genuine charger, there’s a chip in the MagSafe connector (not the “brick” but the magnetic part with the green/amber LED) that identifies the charger to your Mac.  If the wattage advertised is greater than or equal to what’s required, it’ll charge.  If not, it won’t and if your computer is on, will even notify you that the wrong charger is attatched.\nThe way it charges is that the circuitry in the DC-In board detects power from the adapter from the presence of current on the one wire charging circuit.\nSo, if it’s charging with the knock-offs but not the OEMs, it’s bypassing the wattage check and just “dumping” power into the DC-In board.  You don’t want this, because this is how things get fried.  Why aren’t the knock offs using the identifying chip?  Most likely cost.\nThe fix is simple: you need a new DC-In board.  See this related answer for more details.  It’s also called an I/O board because some models have I/O ports on it; this one doesn’t. Note: it’s possible that there may be damage to the charging circuitry on the logic board, but without putting hands on, it’s impossible to know.\nA few clarifications\n\n*\n\n*The 2012 13” MacBook Pro models require the 60W power adapter\n\n*Keep/use the 85W charger as it’s perfectly safe to use a charger with a higher wattage rating than what’s required\n\n*Your battery is not really related to charger wattage.  The only thing that will happen is your charging speeds will differ.  The wattage requirement is based on both charging and compute requirements (what it takes to drive the computer).\n\n*Only use genuine Apple chargers with your Mac.  Cheap knock offs can end up costing you more!\n\n*The last Mac with the MagSafe adapter was the 2017 MacBook Air which was discontinued in 2019.  The chargers will be around for a while longer.  See Apple’s Vintage and obsolete product page for a list of currently supported products.\n\n\nA: Your 13\" MBP requires/comes with a 60W adaptor, which represents the maximum power it can supply. However, it's better to think of the laptop drawing power from the wall, rather than the adaptor 'pushing' power into the laptop.\nIn the normal course of events, your MBP will still draw under 60W from an 85W Apple adaptor.\nHowever, with a third-party battery and a third-party adaptor, you have introduced two unknowns.\nI would make sure that the MagSafe port on the MBP is clean and free from dirt; and I would try another SMC reset. But beyond that, I would just use the battery and supply that works, and keep a close eye on both to make sure that they don't catch fire. (Sort of joking, but not.)\n", "Q: How to mass delete photos on iOS after backing them up manually (no iCloud)? I have an iPhone 11 Pro that I back-up regularly both to macOS and manually to windows (by copying the ###APPLE folders).\nThis phone is now full and I must delete older photos. Ideally I'd just delete the older ###APPLE folders but I believe this will mess the phone up.\nI don't use iCloud since Google Photos is free and I also backup there for a worst case cloud scenario.\nSo how do I mass delete photos from the phone without messing it up to free up some space?\n\nA: On macOS, you can use ImageCapture to select as many photos on the iPhone as you want and delete them. You can also import these photos to macOS with ImageCapture. Using Image capture is good since it cleans up thumbnails, database entries as well as the full resolution images.\nAccessing the exposed DCIM folder isn’t the same as actually deleting the referenced photos via USB and software Apple makes.\n\nA: This is simple:\n\n*\n\n*Select all photos/videos.\n\n\n*Delete them.\nWell, to elaborate:\n\n*\n\n*Open Photos app and open the relevant album.\n\n\n*Tap on the Select button at the top right corner to enter selection mode.\n\n\n*Tap down to select an image. Now without lifting your finger, simply drag your finger in the direction of unselected images (i.e. towards the bottom of the grid of images). As your finger moves, the grid of images will automatically start scrolling, selecting the images encountered on the way. The further away you move your finger from the starting point, faster the selection will be.\n\n\n*You'll find that you have quickly selected all the images.\n\n\n*Hit the Delete icon at the bottom right.\n\n\n*Navigate back to the Albums screen and tap on the Recently Deleted item.\n\n\n*Tap on Select button at the top right.\n\n\n*Tap Delete All at the bottom left.\n\n\n*Voila! All the photos are now deleted. Here's a visual demonstration of the same:\n\n\n\n*You may of-course want to not delete all the photos, so you can stop midway to halt selection. Or tap on individual images to de-select them.\n\n\n*The above approach can help speed up the selection process.\n\nA: Use Google Photos' free space option.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap Menu [icon] and then Free up space and then Remove.\n\n*When you’re asked for permission to delete photos, tap Delete.\n\n*Open the iPhone or iPad Photos app (not the Google Photos app).\n\n*Tap Recently Deleted and delete those same photos and videos.\n\n\nhttps://support.google.com/photos/answer/6128843\n\nA: I would use FileBrowser app.  Gives you full access to your photos from a file manager view.  Add / delete / move.\nI use this constantly also for moving my Photos to and from my NAS to iPhone and iPad.

Even a MacBook Air has Thunderbolt 3 speeds to extend performance greatly for storage, arbitrary PCI cards and more. You can upgrade Macs Mini and Air and Pro to add monster-sized 3D rendering cores with robustly connected fast storage through one cable if you choose thunderbolt daisy chain hardware.\n\n*\n\n*https://3dinsider.com/thunderbolt-3-external-gpus/\nApple sells only a few eGPU direct to consumers and most are out of stock at present, but third party options are widely available and allow you to pick and choose your construction, support and features. Apple even calls out a few dozen models and AMD in particular as recommended models.\nSince macOS Mojave 10.14 there is robust software support for preferring the external GPU even if the app you run might not yet check for this option.\n\n", "Q: Is there any way to run command line from iOS on MacOS So what I’m curious about is that if it is possible to run the command line on iPhone so that it will run on Mac.\nFor example:\nSay, that there is a GitHub project on Mac and I forgot to commit. And is this possible to run command (using Shortcuts or smth else) from iPhone, so that the project on Mac will be committed\n\nA: You can use any SSH app on iOS to access the command line on a Mac.\nOn the Mac you want to open System Preferences => Sharing and enable Remote Login.\nOn the iOS device you want to install an SSH app, such as for example Terminus from the App Store.\nYou can then use Terminus to connect to the Mac using its IP address and your user name and password.\n", "Q: Where do older versions of apps go when a developer removes them from the App Store so when a developer removes their older versions of their app from the App Store so that you cannot downgrade to them where do they go? for example if an app requires iOS 10 or later and a developer unticks the older versions of their app so that people on lets say iOS 8 cannot download the latest compatible version, what happens? thanks all :)\n\nA: The older versions do not \"go\" anywhere as such. If you're hoping that there would be some kind of \"Apple Archives\" web site where Apple offers up downloads of older versions that the developer has requested no longer to be used - then you will be disappointed.\nWhen a developer unticks older versions of an app, what happens is that Apple no longer offers that version for redownload from iTunes in the Cloud (i.e. from App Store on a device, iTunes on a computer, etc).\nNote that developer often have good reasons for unticking a version. In the end most developers want as many users as possible using their app. It could be for example that an older version no longers work with newer versions of their server software, or that they found a grave bug.\n", "Q: How to install Firefox on my Mac laptop I want to install Firefox browser on my Mac laptop. I go to the Firefox website from Google and click on download.\nIt downloaded a Firefox 77.0.1.dmg file.\nHow do I install Firefox using this file?

It's a commonly used way to distribute apps for Mac.\nTo install Firefox using this DMG file, double click to open or mount the DMG file. Doing so would open a new window which will show you the Firefox app bundle which would look like the Firefox icon.\n\nYou can now drag the Firefox icon to the Applications folder as shown in the screenshot above.

Apple iPhone SE with iOS 13.5.1:\nWhen I open an Amazon hyperlink from an email or imessage it will launch the Amazon app and before it can fully open, Safari will hijack the link and open Amazon in Safari.\nI don't want Safari to do this. I want to view Amazon links in the Amazon app. Safari does not do this with other app links like Yelp and Quora. Quora links launch and open Quora app with no Safari hijacking.\nI have tried clearing all cache and web data in Safari.

I have on a number of occasions recently lost a lot of tabs on my iPad. I have accidentally pressed the “close all tabs” button and I once had a frozen Safari window which I without foresight swiped to close and then realized I couldn’t just reopen. There is that trick where you hold down your finger on the new tab button to see some recently closed tabs, but it’s not sufficient - it didn’t record the closed tabs of my entire closed window, and it has a limited number of recent tabs, so if you close 500, you can’t get them all back.

Is there any clear solution to this? Is there a browser extension, perhaps?\n\nEmphasis mine.\nThere's no problem to solve\nThere's no solution because there's no problem to be solved.  As far as a browser extension goes, I'm assuming you searched but couldn't find one.  Let's examine why....\nAs you state, it's your opinion that closed windows and tabs should be \"effortlessly retrievable.\" I'm sure there are many people who agree with you.  However, there are many who believe the opposite, that a closed window should be closed and the data irretrievable (i.e. for privacy and security reasons).  So, given that there are two entirely conflicting positions, where does the developer land?\nExactly where it is now.\nExisting functionality\nWhy?  Because there are existing remedies to dealing with accidentally closed windows:\n\n*\n\n*There is the \"trick\" that allows you to see some of the recently closed tabs\n\n*Your browsing history is available\n\nNothing is without limitations\nAs you state, \"it's not sufficient.\"  Unfortunately, no application on your iPad (or any device for that matter) is without a constraint.  You mentioned \"500 windows,\" if Apple were to \"solve\" this tomorrow, you'd have someone complaining that it's not 600.  \"Going through your history isn't much of a solution because you have so much to scour through\" is not a failure or shortcoming of the app.\n\nSolution: Structure your workflow in line with the tool\n\n...it didn’t record the closed tabs of my entire closed window...\n\nWhy would it?  It already tracks your browsing history.  This expectation is outside the functionality of every other app and how they manage windows.  If they record or remember anything, it's usually the file or workspace you recently had open, but that's what history is.\nIf you have that many windows open (and I'm assuming they're all important), it's up to you to record what you deem necessary to remember.  I too, have many windows open however, when something is important, I take an active step to ensure that the window I'm on somehow gets recorded for posterity; and Apple gives you a way to do this: the Share function.\n\nThere are so many destinations you can send your page to:\n\n*\n\n*Contact as a message or email,\n\n*AirDrop it to another device\n\n*Copy the link\n\n*Add a bookmark\n\n*add to your reading list\n\n*print it\n\n*Send it to Notes, OneNote, Evernote, etc.  I use OneNote extensively and if there's a tab I want to keep it get's sent to OneNote.\n\nThis requires you to make a small change in your workflow - if you see something important, make a note of it.  You won't have to scour history, you eliminate the imposed limitations of Safari and it will be flexible enough that you decide what should be retained and what shouldn't.\nThe bottom line is not to be too quick to perceive a fault or failure of an application because it doesn't meet a standard you've defined for yourself.  Many times, the \"solution to the problem\" is actually there, but we need to take a step back to see it.  Sometimes it requires modifying our workflow rather than the software.\n", "Q: wrong version of gcc being used I've recently been having problems with compiling packages for R. I'm not sure of the causes but one possibility is that there are a couple of different versions of gcc on my MacBook Pro. When I type which gcc in a terminal window it returns /usr/bin/gcc. But when I type gcc --version I get back\nConfigured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/c++/4.2.1\nApple clang version 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.32.62)\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin19.5.0\nThread model: posix\nInstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin\n\nI may also have some issues with the path.

I live in a house with multiple wireless radios and channels – some of which tend to be more reliable than others. I know that connecting to each one sequentially and then do a speed test in a browser would let me start to measure data, but software to assist with a batch test or automate network quality data collection would be helpful.\nIs there a Mac app that will let me see the relative signal strengths and speeds of various base station radios?\n\nA: The WiFi Explorer tool will show you all the wifi connections your computer is capable of seeing. I live in a high rise apartment building and I receive signals from about 50 other modems. WiFi explorer will plot the signal strength of all these or the SNR of these signals. It also gives the channel number of each one. Its an excellent diagnostic tool for WiFi.\nThe basic package is $20 but there is a lite version that is free. I'm not familar with the lite version so I don't know what it does. Since it's free it is probably worth a test drive. The basic version has a 3 day free trial. There is also a Pro Version for $100. It has a 7 day trial.\n\nA: \nI live in a house with multiple routers – some of which tend to be more reliable than others.\n\nMultiple routers?  I'm assuming that there's only one Internet service and you're got multiple routers because they're off the shelf WiFi routers you've (or someone else) has configured as wireless access points.  If it's consumer grade stuff, there's no doubt that some are more reliable than others.  Consumer grade routers and WAPs are barely able to handle simple residential setups.  If you need multiple APs because of a challenging layout, you might need something with a bit more oomph.\nAnalyzing your network\nThere are some really good wireless network analyzers out there, some going for hundreds, some in the thousands.  Solar Winds makes some of the best out there and you can overlay their analysis with a graphical layout of your building and create \"heat maps\"  so you can determine coverage.  There are apps you can get that do similar, but nowhere near the accuracy.\nFor a home environment, you can do this for free with no additional software!\nIn the post, WiFi Performance via Terminal I explain how to get SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) values using the built in airport utility.  What you want to do, is get a rudimentary map of your house or apartment including all floors and go to the points where you often find yourself working (i.e. your favorite chair in the family room).  Connect to that AP and make a note of the WiFi signal characteristics.  If there are multiple APs connect to each one and note the signal characteristics for each on the map.\nThis will give you some good data:\n\n*\n\n*which APs perform better than the other\n\n*areas in the house with strong/weak signals\n\n*areas in the house that could use additional APs because of saturation\n\nGet proper Access Points\nInstead of getting a grab-bag of different routers, if your home is as \"signal complex\" as it's sounding, you need commercial grade access points.  In the same post above WiFi Performance via Terminal I go on to highlight that it's better to have more APs but with the power turned down.\n\nWhat I prefer to do is to deploy multiple APs around the house and turn down the transmit power so they don't go very far outside the room I am trying to cover. I personally use these PoE Access Points from Ubiquiti to cover several areas of my home with great success.\n\nI like PoE (Power over Ethernet) because there's much less cabling (no power adapters to deal with).  As for turning down the power, it's like setting up a sound system in a large area.  You could put a single large speaker and crank it up, but unless you're sitting in the perfect spot, it will sound very distorted.  It's much better to put multiple speakers and turn them down so \"good\" sound is heard in all of the area covered by that one speaker.  I like the Ubiquiti Access Points because they do one thing and do it well - they provide wireless access.\nIf your house is as you describe it, you don't need to bodge together a mix of off-the-shelf routers.  You actually have an \"infrastructure\" problem and you should attack it as such; you'll see an immediate and significant improvement of performance and reliability.\n", "Q: Can employer install any software in Macbook to monitor activity? My work laptop is a MacBook. can my employer monitor my activity? I have to run a certain proxy config file via Tunnelblick( VPN ) the config file I had to take it from IT.thats it\n\nA: It depends, but in most cases, yes they can.\n\n*\n\n*If they issued the MacBook to you, it's their property and they have every right to do as they please with their assets.  There's a simple rule - their company, their rules.\n\n\n*If it's your laptop, they can't force you to install anything.  But that said, you have no entitlement to that particular position.  Again -  their company, their rules.\nThe first case is pretty cut and dry, so let's explore the second a bit more...\nYour employment with a company is conditional, you follow their rules and do what they ask and you get to come back tomorrow to earn another paycheck (yeah, it's a little brutal, but that's what it comes down to).  If they have a policy that says your activity will be monitored and you will use a particular VPN (Tunnelblick), you agreed to those conditions.  So yes, even if it's your laptop, when you agree to certain conditions to work there, you've entered into a contract.  Not holding up your end of it, would be a breach of contract on your part.\nNow, remember I said \"it depends?\"\nWell, here in the US, there are contractors (also called 1099s because that's the tax document used to report income).  A contractor is not an employee.  There are laws that govern the relationship between what a 1099 contractor and the employer can enter into contractually.  For instance, if you are hired as a 1099 to market the company's new widget that's what you're hired to to do and that's it.\n\n*\n\n*If they provide you with a laptop, well, it's their laptop so their rules apply.\n\n*If it's your laptop, they can't manage you like an employee, because you're not.  If however, their marketing database is secured behind a firewall that requires a VPN to access, well, inherently you'll have to install said software because you won't be able to do the job without it.\n\nCan they monitor your activities?  Yes and no.\nIf you're connected to their VPN, inherently they can monitor everything you do.  However, when not connected, they have no business monitoring you - your laptop, your rules.  Typically when hired as a contractor, the contract will spell out the metrics you must meet (i.e. sales of so many widgets, so many contacts with X number of prospects per day, etc.)  How they record these metrics varies, but they cannot go outside the scope and micromanage your day to meet those metrics.  If they do, you're no longer a contractor, but an employee.  If this is the case, there are legal ramifications.  What are they?  You need to consult an attorney.  I'm not an attorney, and most importantly, I'm not your attorney.\n\nA: Yes. Employers can monitor many aspects of hardware they provide. Especially when they use MDM or get you to install scripts, VPN and software and profiles.\nIf you are at all uncomfortable with this, I would recommend checking with a lawyer in your country to be sure you know your rights and also have a frank discussion with your manager and HR or they can explain exactly what they do and do not do. Specially if you have their computer in your home and not on work premises. If it’s at work you should assume you’re being recorded all the time unless you have it in writing but that’s not happening.\n", "Q: My iCloud Drive in Preview is empty where are my files?

(great point bmike) You also don't have extra software on the Mac side modifying the default sound, do you?

If I connect the same SATA drive to my Windows box it also shows up. Does anyone know what the cause of this is, and how to fix it?\nThis is on an older MacBook Pro (mid 2014), running High Sierra v10.13.6.\n\nA: Assuming you’re using the same USB to PATA/SATA adapter on both the Mac and the Windows there are a couple factors which could contribute to the symptoms you’re seeing:\n\n*\n\n*the USB to SATA bridge doesn’t use the universal driver that’s included with macOS. There may be a specific Windows driver for the SATA bridge. The PATA bridge may use the standard driver, which is why it works\n\n*The device may be for Windows and not compatible with macOS\n\n*The SATA drives may be formatted using a filesystem not compatible with macOS (i.e. Linux Ext2/3/4, btrfs, etc.)\n\nBefore you decide that the drive or device is not functional, you can parse dmesg to see if the device was detected.  You can also issue the command diskutil list to see the disks detected by the OS.  It may not be able to read the file system, but it will be detected.\nAdditionally, since this is attached via USB, you can use system_profiler to view all attached devices.  Just issue the command system_profiler SPUSBDataType and parse through the output, looking for your particular disk drive make, model, and size.\n\nA: It sounds like you've tried several SATA drives using that adapter on your system? If so it's more likely the SATA controller on the adapter has some compatibility issues with that model of system.\nI've had a bunch of SATA/USB adapters that were a little temperamental on various systems over the years. My go-to solution has always been to simply order another from Amazon from a different brand. It's the blessing and curse of everything being so cheap and easy to order/receive.\nMy recent go-to adapters that have been reasonably reliable are the UNITEK USB 3.0 to SATA converter adapter (if it needs power), and the StarTech SATA to USB adapter - either USB C or USB 3.0/3.1 version depending on the cost and what I'll need it for.\nOthers may have some favorites they can share as well.\nI'm not a huge fan of \"buy another one\" mentality, but in your case I think that's probably the easiest solution, especially as the adapters are less than $25 and quick to ship.\n", "Q: TV app home screen on iOS and Apple TV not working So the TV app in iOS and Apple TV, where you setup your favorite shows in a carousel isn’t working.

I just bought a new Mac Mini (2020) with 512 GB flash storage.\nAs the flash storage of this model is soldered to the Mainboard this means to me if the flash fails the Mac mini will be dead. As this Mac is used for tasks require heavy disk usage (I expect about 2-4 TB per month) I tried to find out what maximum write load the Apple SSD is supposed to have.\nRetail SSDs for PCs usually have a maximum Terabytes Written value indicating a supposed maximum write load they should be able to handle. Does such a value also exists for the integrated SSDs of a Mac mini?\nWhere can I find those values for the integrated Mac mini SSD - model number \"APPLE SSD AP0512M\"?\n\nA: I've had my 2018 Mac mini with 512 GB since November 2018 (around 580 days). According to DriveDx, the on-board SSD has been powered on for 28 days, despite the fact that the Mac has been switched on almost permanently.\nThe drive has written a total of 17,1 TB of data, according to the SMART data from DriveDx. I've heard 300-600 TBW bandied about as a typical SSD lifespan. (300 for the blade on a 2014 MBP; 600 for a 2018 Samsung EVO NVMe.) In which case, I've used about 0.06% - 0.03% of the drive's writes.\nSo it should last me 26-52 years. You may be able to extrapolate a result based on your own usage.\nIf you are expecting to write 8 times the disk's size every month, then using a larger external drive, which can be replaced more cheaply if necessary, may be a safer/better option.\n\nA: As mentioned in the other answers, Apple does not give those specifications in their documentation or on their web site.\nYou can get some kind of estimate by installing the program smartctl from smartmontools, which can query your specific drive for its health parameters. Do this by installing HomeBrew, and then run the following in the terminal:\nbrew install smartmontools\n\nAfter installation query the drive using:\nsmartctl --all /dev/disk0\n\nYou will now get the SMART health information for your drive. In particular take a look at the \"Percentage Used\". That gives a vendor specific estimate of the life used based on actual usage and a prediction of life time. It does not mean that the drive fails at 100% (the value can be more than 100), nor does it guarantee that it does not fail before reaching 100%. It is after all an estimate.\nFor example my Mac Mini shows that 36 TB data has been written to it (translates into 9 months of usage for you if your numbers are correct). This translates into an estimated 1% used. Had I used that 1% over 9 months, then it would translate into an estimated life time of roughly 75 years.\nNOTE: My Mac Mini has the 2 TB version of the SSD, not the 512 GB version you have. The 2 TB version is expected to have a much longer life expectancy than the 512 GB version - so you cannot use my numbers for your drive. You have to check your own drive.\n\nA: Apple does not publish TBW / write duration / MTBF guidance for any product (thus far). Additionally, they don’t publicly commit to any specific vendor for components (or allow their vendors to claim they supply Apple ) as qualified for use with the T2-based storage controller.\nOn a technical level, the OS tracks storage writes daily in the diagnostic logs and the more people that opt in to share that with Apple, the better chance we all won’t be surprised if machines as a group are trending to exhaust their useful lifespans. My expectation is that Apple likely have an extraordinary pool of anonymous data on actual usage patterns on top of mountains of design and test data on how every system they release works and fails. Since we don’t see that data, we can’t depend on it for comfort or decision-making, naturally. It would be shocking if the decade of iOS storage data has left Apple unaware of how to design the T2 and M1 but no company is infallible and risks taken can turn into a service program to remediate longevity issues. All of these are standard Apple plays from their engineering and product delivery playbook.\nEverything I write above applies to the 2020 Intel Mini and the 2020 Apple Silicon (M1) Mini. Much of the below focuses a bit more on the M1 controller and “blogosphere” of Apple tech writers and pundits.\nThere is a lot of FUD recently (podcasts and some MacWorld articles to be specific) concerning the first generation of M1 hardware and using S.M.A.R.T monitoring tools to analyze storage data. This is leading to speculation that write exhaustion might be a concern down the road. I don’t share that concern yet (mostly too soon to tell) and I would say most people are not alarmed or concerned about Intel based SSD that you specifically questioned. I encourage anyone that wants to watch this to do so and share their objective data and subjective experiences as well as hard data that can be verified and replicated. So far, no one is being bold enough to make actual hard prediction that Apple has made a fundamental or egregious error here.\nWear leveling on SSD is both non-trivial and very technical and sometimes considered proprietary / confidential data. After all, successful engineering of the constraints and costs and firmware and software over time - if this all is managed in balance, that results in a competitive advantage for Apple and the vendors alike. If mismanaged, it results in bad press, dissatisfied customers and erosion of margin or direct charges due to AppleCare costs and other claims.\nThere are people with legitimate desire to have Apple not design hardware that runs for decades - they call this an “Apple Tax” when enterprise grade parts / higher level of support and software upgrades ship in a consumer device. There are people with legitimate desire to have everyone subsidize enterprise grade parts / service and support in a consumer device so they can keep Macs in service for decades. Only time will tell if 5 to 7 years from now the M1 storage holds up as solidly as that of the Intel era, but I’m sure the journey to get there will be interesting.\n", "Q: App for macOS to add words to personal vocabulary list? I search for a way to add unknown words in a personal dictionary or vocabulary list only by right-clicking the word and choosing the add option (in macOS). It would be very helpful for me to add the words directly to a vocabulary list, without breaking my workflow.

Since I already own the app, the App Store doesn’t give me an option of purchasing it again. How do I do this?\nIf I’m teaching her, can I add my licensed copy to her iPad? She will not be using my Apple ID. She does not yet have an AppleID or I’d purchase it there for her.\n\nA: Two things to overcome. First is you need to navigate to the app and to the right of where it says open - choose the box with the up arrow and underneath the pop up, the gift option arises. Second, only paid apps can be gifted.\n\nYou will have to enter an email address as an AppleID for the gift to be sent and I have never entered an AppleID that didn’t exist. If you can get the student to make their AppleID first, that might be required and I would recommend it if you know the sale duration allows this time.\nI wouldn’t make an account for someone else and strongly recommend against it in general - that seems to end up badly for most people for many reasons. Here are other sale opportunities you might also consider while waiting for your student to get their account ready to receive your gift:\n\n*\n\n*Apple offers discounts when you pre-pay a balance - sometimes 10%\n\n*Apple gift cards often are sold at a discount and can be gifted physically and via code\n\n", "Q: How can I verify if a group exists in Active Directory on a certain domain In Windows you can use the \"net\" command to do this quite easily:\nnet group /domain groupName\n\nWhich checks if groupName exists in your current domain.\nIs there something equivalent in Mac?\n\nA: To find a user:\ndscl \"/Active Directory/DOMAIN/All Domains\" read /Users/user\n\nTo find a group:\ndscl \"/Active Directory/DOMAIN/All Domains\" read /Groups/group\n\n", "Q: iMovie only imports 4 seconds of a movie clip that is much longer than 4 seconds Intermittent… sometimes iMovie decides to only import 4 seconds of my movie clip even though it is much longer.\n\nI am dragging it out of Photos and into iMovie\n\nWhen I QUIT & RELAUNCH iMovie, the symptom still happens (no change).\nHowever, the only way I can see to fix this is to do a FULL REBOOT on my machine, then the same clip correctly imports into iMovie\n\nA: If you try to drag and drop a video from photos, for whatever reasons, it only takes it in as an image, and the image is displayed for only 4 seconds by default.

Two days ago my MacBook Pro 13 stopped detecting external monitors.\nI'm using a Unitek HDMI to USB-C dongle which I know works fine. I've tested 3 different monitors, that have different resolutions and refresh rates, they all work fine.\nI've got another 2019 MacBook Pro 13\" that works fine with every single monitor; using the same cable/dongle combo.\nWhat I've tried:\n\n*\n\n*plugged the dongle with and without charger also being plugged in,\n\n*plugged the dongle when Mac was sleeping/off\n\n*plugged in a USB-C -> USB-A dongle and connected a mouse to it - both ports work fine,\n\n*restarted my Mac after I've plugged the USB-C cable in,\n\n*reset NVRAM and SMC,\n\n*reinstalled OS (with and without backup)\n\n*tried clicking \"Detect Displays\" in Displays settings,\n\n*closed the lid, plugged the cable in, opened the lid,\n\n*installed DisplayLink drivers, uninstalled them.\n\nWhen I connect the dongle, it's visible as BillBoard Device in the System Information -> USB (both Macs have that). I've also been watching and comparing Console logs when I connect/disconnect the monitor and here are some things that I've noticed:\n\n*\n\n*The Mac that works fine has some [Hot_Plug] events visible when I plug in the monitor,\n\n*FB0 both have DisplayPort driver version 1.1, FB1 on working Mac has a version 1.2 (this information doesn't show up on non-working Mac)\n\nThe screen doesn't flicker when I connect any external display, there's no Arrangements tab visible.

Now, you didn't specifically say so, but I'm assuming that the built-in display is working.  Since you have the Intel Iris (Integrated) graphics, there's no failure with the graphics chipset (there's no discrete GPU)\nHowever, there is a video mux (multiplexer) chip that \"sends\" video to the LCD, the external monitor, or both.  This has likely died.\n\n*\n\n*Macbook Pro on but display is blank\nYou've done a lot of diagnostics - actually gone a bit overboard with the re-installation of the OS.  Safe Mode or Recovery Mode is sufficient for this.  For the future, try this first and if you absolutely must have a clean install, do it to a USB flash drive (32GB is sufficient) so you're not wiping out your drive (and all your work) as a diagnostic procedure.\n", "Q: Can't sign into iTunes on Mac 10.7.5 I can open the iTunes app and it seems to be working as normal, but whenever I try to sign in it gives me two error messages, one after the other.\n\n*\n\n*first - \"We could not complete your iTunes Store request.

This can be using Jailbreak modifications or using a feature available in iOS.\nI have a 64GB iPhone 6S that has over 40GB of photos and videos on it - most of that being videos. However, I am quickly running out of usable storage. I want to be able to still access new photos and videos but I want videos older than a year to be 'optimised'.\nIs there any way to do this either using Jailbreak tweaks or iOS features? If not how could I build a tweak to do this?\n\nA: There's no built-in iOS feature that allows you to do exactly this. Nor do I know of any jailbreak tweak that enables this feature.\nBuilding such a tweak would require software development experience along with specific knowledge about the iCloud Photos metadata storage.\n", "Q: Monitor network connectivity issues having a ton of issues with my new ISP. Does anyone know of an app that sits in the tray and tests connectivity to various websites every ~10 seconds and provides a report on connectivity and perf issues? Thanks!\n\nA: There’s not an App, but there’s a tool (one of my favorites) that does this exact thing - iPerf3.\nNormally, you’d run iPerf3 on two different nodes to evaluate network performance; one as a server and the other as the client, but in your scenario, you need to check performance to the Internet (nodes you don’t control).  iPerf has a solution for that too:  iPerf Public Servers\nFor an example of an iPerf in action, see  What dowload speeds is the Apple USB Ethernet Adapter capable of?\nYou can use these public servers to measure/monitor Internet performance.  What you’ll need to do is run iPerf periodically (10 seconds may to too short an interval) and at the end of the command append a file redirect to send the output to a file.  For example:\niperf3 -c IP <Address/Hostname> >> filename.txt\n\nThe >> filename.txt will create a file called “filename.txt” if it doesn’t exist and the double greater than sign will append the output to the file and not overwrite it.  Use a single > to overwite the file.\nYou could use cron (deprecated) or use launchd to run the command periodically.  10 seconds is much to short an interval; maybe every few minutes or so would be better.\nThe best part about this tool is that it’s free (as in beer). Period. No trial, no lite version with an upgrade to pro, etc.\n\nA: I don't know of any Mac app. My router [Sophos UTM] tests connectivity constantly & emails if there is any line fault, but the simplest structure I know is ThinkBroadband, who have a line tester which you can set up to ping your router continuously & check for down-time.\nIt's a UK site, but I don't think it's geo-fenced, I think it works from anywhere. You need to register & you need to make sure your IP address isn't constantly changing, or it will lose track.\n\nA: Have a look at https://www.pingplotter.com.\nI tried it recently to investigate some Wi-Fi issues I'm having, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I thought the display was well thought out, and the documentation quite good.\nIf you are experiencing intermittent packet loss, it could be quite a useful tool.\nIt can test connectivity to a website (I think multiple at once if you pay for it, or use the free trial).  Every 10 seconds is an option (ranges from every 1 second to every 60 minutes).\nThe free version shows the last 10 minutes of history.  The paid ones show a lot more.\nSo if what you need are ping results over a period of time, this could be a good option.  But this won't measure \"performance\".\n(I'm not connected with them in any way, just had a fairly good recent experience with it.)\n", "Q: Mac not accepting Password even with Password Resets My MacBook Pro stopped accepting my password.

Any ideas?\n\nA: I would make sure all the data is backed up and then make a new account.\nTest that new account - one possibility that comes to mind is that there is a keyboard mismatch when entering the password at login.\nIf all is then well, install the data from the backup and proceed as normal.\n\nA: I'm not sure why this works, but I've seen this issue on Macs and resetting NVRAM fixes it.  Reset instructions are on Apple's site:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063\n", "Q: How do I bypass a VPN for Continuity to Work? When on a VPN (such as Private Internet Access) Continuity and Handoff stop working.  Some VPN's such as PIA have a feature to exclude certain IP addresses, networks, or executables from the VPN.  To make continuity work to place and receive calls using my iPhone, an executable needs to be excluded.  What executable should be excluded?\n\nA: By excluding the executable \\usr\\sbin\\mDNSResponder executable and either rebooting for killing the existing process, Continuity properly works to make and receive phone calls using an iPhone.  This means VPN users can exclude that process and still gain functionality of Continuity if they want.\nIt should be noted that by excluding that executable they would be exposing it's network traffic to the network without the protection of the VPN.  Thus if on an insecure network it might be possible for the network provider to see what the user is doing (though the actual call traffic is encrypted, IIRC).\nDifferent VPN's have different mechanisms, I know what works for PIA to exclude the executable but I'm not familiar with all VPN packages.  The PIA application UI doesn't allow for excluding just bare executables, but it is possible.  Pulling from this post on the PIA forum one needs to install a package called jq using Homebrew.\nOnce installed, it can be excluded via:\npiactl -u applysettings '{\"splitTunnelRules\":'\"$(cat /Library/Preferences/com.privateinternetaccess.vpn/settings.json | jq '.splitTunnelRules + [{\"linkTarget\":\"\",\"mode\":\"exclude\",\"path\":\"/usr/sbin/mDNSResponder\"}]' -c)\"'}'\n\nThe FaceTime application should also be excluded, but that can be done through the PIA UI without any trouble.\nThe change is persistent and survives a reboot.  Before changes work a person will have to reboot or kill the mDNSResponder process to force it to reload.  Other services offer Split Tunnel as well to exclude certain applications, but as I said I don't know how to make it work for anything but PIA.  Excluding the executable should work, so long as there is a way to do that.\nAs an addon, I've also found that I need to exclude /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/IDS.framework/identityservicesd.app as well as /usr/libexec/avconferenced from the VPN in order to make the connection reliable when using WiFi Calling.  It appears the system establishes a VPN of its own using identityservicesd and while I could not actually see any activity over the network from avconferenced the system got really flakey about establishing a phone call until I excluded it.  Not sure why.\n", "Q: AppleTV “Watch Now” doesn't recognize purchased content in library Approximately two days ago Apple TV’s Watch Now screen stopped letting me watch the next episode of a show that I own and am watching. Instead it takes me to the rent/buy interface.

Hence, it didn't seem a hardware issue. Also,I did SMC reset and NVRAM/PRAM reset. No improvement.\n\nA: The “haptic engine” is basically an electromagnet that causes a vibration in the trackpad and is “outside” how the trackpad capacitive touch sensors work. Something in that system has failed.\nSo even though your track pad works for input, you need to take it in for service because the trackpad needs to be replaced. Technically, the entire top case, which is comprised of the case, keyboard, trackpad, and battery will have to  be replaced.

We use management frameworks like JAMF Pro or Munki to script and manage arbitrary changes and installations so that no user needs to download / package / install or prompt. These are powerful distributed automation options, but they cost time and salary and experience and licensing.\nYou can roll your own more minimal installer, Most require a bit of skill if you can’t change your installer to just run as non-admin, but they are lighter cost and weight than an MDM suite solution. See homebrew for a great example of an installer that needs admin only at setup and not when installing new code.\nIf you need admin installer and can’t use brew cask to package your apps, a dependable way is to write a daemon that runs as admin. Microsoft Office, Adobe and many other software does this, the installer system runs at launch or as a daemon and gets admin privileges and then uses the OS to run periodically.\nThis avoids the design intent for the installer to ask for admin at the last moment when installations trigger. Following the design intent is generally more secure and far less work for you and your customers.\n\nA: Missing Intent\nUnfortunately, the information needed to evaluate if an installer package is whitelisted is not available during requests to obtain an system.install.* right.\nCalls to macOS's Authorization Services do not include details about what the authorization will be used for.\nEven if you implement a custom Authorization Plug-in, the authorization request will not mention what package is being installed.\n\nUse plug-ins to extend macOS authorization services to perform authorizations in a new way or to implement a new policy that is too complex to be implemented entirely with the authorization policy database.\n\nWhat Next?\nHere are some options:\n\n*\n\n*File a bug report directly with Apple;\n\n*Write a SMJobBless helper to grant administrator rights on-demand; see UpdateCore for an example administrator privileged helper tool that installs software;\n\n*Consider third party software that can provide a \"self serve\" service for your users.\n\n", "Q: Unable to backup macbook using time machine Since a few weeks ago, i am unable to backup my mac using time machine.

After restarting several times, OS X is still on screen telling me that \"no packages were eligible for install\".\nCan someone help please, and can you bear in mind that I’m not technically minded so keep instruction in simple terms.\n\nA: As explained here, OS X 10.11 \"El Capitan\" fails to install because it is too old (the technical reason being that the signing certificate is no longer valid).\nBut you can trick the OS X installer into thinking that it is 2017 and it will happily run without any errors.\nHow to trick the OS X installer\n\n*\n\n*When the OS X installer complains that \"No packages were eligible for install\" and displays this window:\n\ndon't restart your Mac.\n\n\n*Turn Wi-Fi off or unplug the Ethernet cord, depending on your configuration, to prevent your Mac from connecting to the Internet:\n\n\n\n*Select Utilities>Terminal:\n\n\n\n*Click the window that appears:\n\nand type date 0115124517 (this will reset the date to Jan 1st 12:45 2017).

I can't work with external monitor. 3-5 minutes after pluging in I have kernel_task that takes something about 500-900% CPU. I know there are some similar topics - the main suspect is overheating in such case. I have some changes in temperature, but it's hard to say for me if temperatures are still in ok spot. I have highlighted the biggest changes.              \n\nA: I would suggest moving your charging plug from the left side of the MacBook Pro to the right side. Similarly you can experiment with plugging in the monitor on the other side.\nThe two sides have different reactions in terms of temperature, so on one side it might not make much difference - and on the other side it could be just above the threshold that triggers an attempt to lower the temperature by making kernel_task occupy the CPU (in idle mode) to save power.\n\nA: I've recently experienced the same on an older (mid-2015) MacBook Pro, and I think it's a coincidence of (some of) these:\n\n*\n\n*External monitor connected (if disconnected - kernel_task drops)\n\n*Spotlight index broke, and decided to reindex from scratch\n\n*Charger connected\n\n*Sometimes it's mds_stores process that hits high CPU if kernel_task drops\n\nOne thing I find strange with the above numbers is that the CPU is not overheating which normally comes with a high CPU load. However, the entire system becomes sluggish, which makes sense given a background process sucking up most of the CPU.\nMy take on it all is that the Monterey update had somehow rendered the Spotlight index (mds_stores process) useless, and it decided to reindex everything. The external display started fighting for the resources, so indexing would never finish.\nMy solution was (after resetting PRAM and SMC that didn't help) to disconnect the external display overnight while keeping the power source connected - giving the Spotlight enough room to complete the reindexing.\nNext day - Spotlight seems to be done indexing (you can check that by hitting Cmd+Space and typing anything, the progress bar will appear if indexing is in progress), external display works just fine, system temp is steady below 70 °C, and CPU is stable/idle 90%.\n", "Q: Batch print with printer preset in MacOS I have 50+ documents to print with the exact same printer settings and I'm trying to batch print them using the existing printer preset. What I've done so far:\n\n*\n\n*open all documents in one preview windows on El Capitan -> doesn't work, prints all documents as one document instead of separate ones (e.g. if the documents have an odd number of pages, the next documents is printed on the back of the last page)\n\n*Try a python script to create a pdf made of all my needed documents in the right format, so that I could print it and separate the documents manually -> unsucessfull as my python skills are not that great + needs to be done again everytime the situation happens again.\n\n*change the cups settings and hit cmd+P in the finder -> doesn't work as I can't get the right margin settings in CUPS + the solution is not a long term one as one would need to tinker with CUPS every time a new batch job with different settings has to be done, eventually loosing the overview of what has changed.\n\nIn short, I would need the preview printing dialog batch applying to a bunch of documents or an applescript/automator etc. that can use existing printer preset (those must be stored somewhere in the system, I don't know where) and apply it to selected documents. Any idea?\nSystem: 10.14 but I can use 10.11 if needed.\n\nA: So based on previous comments and answers I settled for a bash script with a for loop:\n#! /bin/bash\n\ncd /path/to/your/PDFfiles\nfor pdffile in *.pdf; do\n        lpr -P MY_PRINTER -o media=A4 -o sides=two-sided-long-edge -o InputSlot=tray-3 \"$pdffile\";\ndone\n\nBeware that this script prints all pdfs in /path/to/your/PDFfiles !

You can configure a Print Preset as the default by saving it, then select it and hold Option when you click on Print.\nIn System Preferences > Printers, you can click on \"Open Print Queue\", and then you can drop files directly onto the Printer's queue window. This include PDFs but also other image formats natively handled by MacOS.\nSo the trick is configuring the print queue with the settings you want, which you can do from the CUPS web interface. You can then create as many print queues with different characteristics as you like. However, you seem to suggest that's not working for you.\nYou could also use the lp or lpr shell commands, with whatever options for your printer that you require. See the CUPS manual for details.\nIn AppleScript, it is possible to print with properties, but those don't seem to include device-specific options, nor presets.\n\nA: There are a couple of things you can do:\n\n*\n\n*Printer Presets\nUnder the Presets menu, see if the Reset Presets Menu to “Default Settings” is checked. If this is checked, uncheck it and the last preset you used remain in place when you finish printing the document.\n\n\n*Create a \"New\" Printer\nCreate a new printer that prints to the same device, but set all the printer defaults (printer presets) the way you like them.

It even works on the older one. But then it suddenly stops. It just don't get why...\n\nA: I have solved this issue recently in case anyone is interested in how. It is NOT actually necessary for System Events to have direct Accessibility privileges. What you need to add are a total of 3 apps, Automator, Script Editor, and AppleScript Utility.\nThe Automator and Script Editor apps are found within the ~/Applications and ~/Applications/Utilities folders, respectively. What is harder to find is the AppleScript Utility app, seen below:\n\nTo add AppleScript Utility app, click the + button on Accessibility, then navigate to (a shortcut is CMD+SHIFT+G)\n/System/Library/CoreServices\n\nthen open the application called AppleScript Utility.\nAfterwards, run a script in automator again, which updates the privileges and things should run well after. In summary, Automator, Script Editor, and AppleScript Utility need to be added to Accessibility.\n\nA: I found that all applications involved that are targeted by the Automation also need to be given Accessibility permission.  So, if your Automation reloads a page in Chrome then both Chrome and Automator require Accessibility permissions.\n\nA: Another thing that COULD be causing problems is spaces in the script name. I have no idea why, but as this comment on another question pointed out, it seems that having spaces in the filename of the script can cause these errors to persist even if you've added everything possible to the Acessibility app whitelist!\nSo remove all spaces from your script filename and replace with - or _!\nThen go back through the many useful answers in this thread and make sure you've whitelisted all the apps needed.\nWorked for me, hopefully this helps some others who are trapped in error-hell!\n", "Q: OS X Recovery Disk Assistant Does the OS X Recovery Disk Assistant introduced by Apple for Lion works for any later macOS?\nMore precisely, will this tool create a bootable copy of the existing internal Recovery Partition onto an external drive, regardless of which version the Recovery Partition contains?\n\nA: This software did work with versions of OS X beyond Lion. However, with El Capitan and newer versions of macOS, this software was replaced with createinstallmedia.\nThe original idea was to copy the recovery partition to a USB drive. This allowed older Macs, with firmware that was unable to boot to Internet Recovery, to boot from a USB drive and download and install OS X. Eventually, Apple decided to include the installation software on the USB drive. This is where the idea for createinstallmedia came from.\n\nA: El Capitan\nOS X Recovery Disk Assistant ran fine and created a bootable partition in a USB drive. Rebooting with Option pressed showed the USB drive.\nBooting from that drive did not work: it booted from the internal partition. Booting a different machine using this USB drive did not work: I got the prohibitory symbol.\nHigh Sierra\nOS X Recovery Disk Assistant did not run: it complained that no Recovery Partition existed (but it does and works).

I believe it said '...files being copied to Movies.'  And it was in the magnitude of 10's of thousands of files.\nI quickly cancelled this process because whatever it was, was not intentional.  There is nothing now in the Movies folder.  And this is a brand new Macbook to which I did not migrate any personal data.\nIm now paranoid about what those files were, how that process started, if I have malware, etc.\nFor my peace of mind I want to see if it's possible to find a log of all activity in Finder that would show details about that unintentional file transfer.  I tried looking at the Console application, and system.log file but Im not sure if that's the right place to look.\n\nA: There’s no need to review since Finder cleans up a bulk move almost always and when it doesn’t - you will see the files sitting in the new location.\nOne way way to know what changes from day to day is Time Machine, so for your peace of mind, set that up and now you’ll have a reliable measure to track files even if they move / delete and even better - you’ll have a backup and not just a record of what was lost or misplaced.\n", "Q: How to calibrate external monitor with MacBook Pro?

This was a lengthy and unpleasant procedure. Is there a better way to turn a note into an EPUB? By the way, I specifically need to have all the images from the note in the resulting EPUB document.\n\nA: Sorry you had challenges with the copy to pages. In my experience, the content from the note to Pages is generally excellent and one step. Pages has EPUB export capabilities and has taken over all functions for complex document authoring and layout that the discontinued iBooks Author app provided in the past for macOS.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211136\nI think you will find the hassle to get it into pages lessened over time and benefit from having it in a format you can edit easier than PDF.\nOnce your notes grow more complicated, doing the authoring in pages first may be the best solution so you are not hobbled by the limited features and choices made for notes app to be a lightweight authoring environment. Pages is much better for things that fall between PageMaker / LaTeX documents and notes which hit the phone / pad / desktop sweet spot for basic function.\n\nA: You can save a Note as a PDF in the Notes App. Then you can use EPubIr to convert the PDF to EPUB.

I presume that remote log in, remote access and normal file sharing was not enabled.\nThe last backup was 6 months ago, and I would like to recover files if possible.\nMost of her work is on the university server, so is still available, but it would be handy if I could recover others.\nI thought of accessing the disk - I believe that there is feature (but can't recall), although the Firewire ports on the machines are different.\nI would welcome any suggestions to enable access to the SSD. As a last resort I will remove it from the Mac.\nWhat options exist to get at the files short of paying someone to do the repair or recover the data?\n\nA: You can boot the old Mac up into 'Target Disk Mode', by holding T at startup.\nYou will need a cable that connects the two together: this is a bit complex, because the 2012 MBP has FireWire and Thundberbolt 1 and the new Mac has no FireWire and Thunderbolt 3. So'll you'll either need a Thunderbolt 2 to 3 adaptor, or a Thunderbolt to FireWire adaptor.\nWhen the Migration Assistant runs on the new Mac, you may be able to connect the other Mac via Ethernet (again with the relevant adaptor on the new Mac), to begin a transfer of the data. It's possible you might have to type in an admin password on the old Mac.\nRemoving the drive and connecting it via a USB-C to SATA cable is also possible.\n\nA: Have you tried Target Disk Mode on the \"dead\" laptop to get files from it?\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201462\nIf the computer runs then it should be able to enter TDM by holding down the \"T\" key as it boots up.  With a dead display you won't see the screen indicate success on entering TDM but you should have indication of success by the drive in the TDM computer showing up as a drive on a computer it is connected to.  See the link above on how to connect the two computers.\nIt sounds like you may have resolved the issue so this might not be helpful to you now.  I mention this as something you could consider in the future in dealing with this computer (file sharing works but TDM is likely much faster) and/or for those that find themselves with a similar issue.\n\nA: As suggested in comments, I would have used an external monitor (if I had one).\nThen I remembered I had a mini Display Port to DVI adapter in a junk box, and with an old DVI monitor got it to work.\nThe first thing I did was enable File Sharing and Remote Access.\n\nA: It sounds like you have the situation in hand now– but if you can get in via SSH, you can easily transfer files off using sftp, scp, and rsync.  If there's disk corruption, ditto and ddrescue are your friends.\n", "Q: Is using the rm -P command safe on Macs with an SSD I read that secure deleting a file on any kind of SSD was dangerous because it could hurt the reliability and longevity of the SSD. Therefore, if I removed files using the -P flag, would hurt my SSD because according to https://ss64.com/, the -P flag instructs the command to do the following:\n\n-P  Overwrite regular files before deleting them.  Files are\noverwritten three times, first with the byte pattern 0xff,\nthen 0x00, and then 0xff again, before they are deleted.\n\nTherefore, is using this command safe on Macs with an SSD, or can this cause damage since it is technically overwriting data on the SSD which causes wear leveling?\n\nA: \n...is using this command [rm -P] safe on Macs with an SSD, or can this cause damage since it is technically overwriting data on the SSD which causes wear leveling\n\nIt’s perfectly safe.  You couldn’t really write enough data for it to matter. It’s also completely unnecessary as whatever you’ve deleted is instantaneously “gone.”  The block isn’t really overwritten, it’s just that depending on the SSD, the drive will only return zeros or random garbage when a read command is made. It’s also marked as “unused” rather than “deleted” so it will likely be overwritten with legitimate data quickly.\nAdditional reading:\n\n*\n\n*Limited Read and Writes on MacBook Air SSD\n\n*How to get the \"securely erase\" function of Disk Utility on El Capitan & Sierra\n\n*Can the data on an MacBook Pro SSD be recovered after formatting using Disk Utility\n", "Q: Used Bootcamp to get Windows 10 on MacBook Pro (Mid-2012, Catalina) says \"no bootable device - insert boot disk and press any key\" My late 2012 MacBook Pro is running Catalina. I used the Bootcamp Assistant to format a blank flash drive, copy my Windows 10 ISO file (downloaded from the provided Bootcamp assistant link) onto the flash drive, download the latest Windows software support from Apple, and create a new Windows partition to install it on (in other words, I checked all three boxes on the bootcamp assistant menu). It took about 4 hours for the computer to finish it all, but after I confirmed my password a few times and it finally finished, my computer restarted automatically, booting to the windows partition by default. But, instead of any kind of Windows 10 install menu (even though it seems like the install should have already been completed by the bootcamp assistant), it just says \"NO BOOTABLE DEVICE - INSERT BOOT DISK AND PRESS ANY KEY.\"\nI restarted and booted back to OS X, removed the Windows partition using the bootcamp assistant, and then did it all again, even re-formatting and re-copying windows to the newly blank flash drive. Same result. Then, I tried it again using a different flash drive, with the same result. When I restart the computer and hold alt/opt, It only shows my OS X drive, as well as \"Windows\" and \"EFI BOOT\". When I boot onto \"Windows\", it takes me to what looks like the install menu for Windows 10 on a blank computer, but when the option comes up for which drive to install Windows on, and I try to click the 300GB partition that I created using Bootcamp, it says \"Windows cannot be installed on this disk.\"\nI'm not sure what's wrong with it. A few months ago, when I was running Mojave instead of Catalina, I installed Windows 10 in the exact same way, and it worked fine.\n\nA: When installing Windows 10 on your model Mac, you should verify the Windows 10 USB installer sees Disk 0 as using the GPT scheme. When the first Windows 10 installer screen appears, press the key combination shift+F10. This will open a Command Prompt Window. Enter the command given below.\necho list disk | diskpart\n\nDisk 0 row should show a * character in the Gpt column, as shown below.\n\nTo close the Command Prompt window, enter the command exit.\nAlso, when installing Windows 10 on your model Mac, you should EFI boot the Windows 10 USB installer. If you are using the Mac Startup Manager, then choose the EFI Boot label under an external drive icon. If you incorrectly BIOS boot from the Windows 10 USB installer, then you should get the error message Windows can't be installed on drive 0 partition N. (Show details), when choosing the partition where you want Windows installed. If you select (Show details), then you should get the popup window shown below.\n\nTo summarize, you need to EFI boot from the USB flash drive and Disk 0 needs to be using the GPT scheme. In other words, Disk 0 can not be hybrid partitioned.\n\nA: Which drive are you using for the Windows boot disk?  It sounds like you are using an external USB drive.  I'm not so sure that's supported all that well.  I mean Windows 10 is built to boot from USB drives but there's a lot of care that has to be taken to make that work.  You did mention it worked before, and I don't doubt you, but I have to wonder if there's a detail you missed now that you covered then.  Either way I'd like to get some clarification on how the drives, and any other attached hardware, is set up.\nI know the goal is to run Windows \"on the metal\" but have you considered running Windows in a virtual machine to avoid this?  That's how I've been running Windows on my Apple laptops for a long time and it's been working great for me.\n", "Q: Run an application as another user in Mac I have tried various methods mentioned across many sites, but cant able to run perfectly on newer versions of mac os.\nI have tried:\nsudo -i -u otheruser -H\nOR\nsudo login -f otheruser\n\nAnd try running the app in the new prompt using /Applications/Sketch.app/Contents/MacOS/Sketch\nAlso I have tried:\nsu otheruser -c \"/Applications/Sketch.app/Contents/MacOS/Sketch\"\n\nAll of these run the app. But as soon as I open something which require system events (such as requesting macos native file picker) the application crashes.

If I can't then I guess I'll just take the hard drive out and scrap it.\n\nA: I believe this should be possible. However, you cannot do this without changing the hardware of the computer. What you can keep though is the display and the housing. You need to take the rest of the computer out and take a look at the back or side of the display. Somewhere around there or on the display's flex cable you should be able to find a code which you can use to buy a compatible inverter board on the internet (just google or search on eBay, it should not be this hard). Now you need to plug your display flex cable into the inverter board. Then you will find a DVI/HDMI/VGA port on the inverter board, depending on which one you bought, which you need to lead to the outside (p.e. with an adapter cable). Now you can plug your computer into the port and use the iMac as a display.\nSome German guy did something similar with a modern 5k iMac with the only difference being that he bought the housing and the display specifically for it instead of recycling a Mac. Even though you probably do not speak German, this might give you a better idea of how it is done: https://youtu.be/hzTVe6aVgww\nAnd there is also an English video where someone tried this with a Windows laptop: https://youtu.be/CfirQC99xPc\nGood luck! It is always better to try to reuse old and broken electronics instead of throwing them away!\n\nA: Sorry, but that won’t work.  As I understand how Target Display Mode works, the Mac has to be able to boot for it to work as a monitor.\nhttps://www.techjunkie.com/ins-outs-imacs-target-display-mode\nMaybe you could find a used graphics card on ebay or even sell it there too.  They are still popular and I might buy it but my wife might kill me!  :-)\n\nA: Wow, 2008?  That's before Target Display Mode existed, before DisplayPort caught on, and before USB 3.0.  It might be possible to open it up and find the cable that connects the GPU to the display, hope that it talks DVI, then wire that to the mini-DVI port on the back so you can feed in video that way.  Replacing this with a \"comparable\" display today might be as little as $100 to over $600, depending on what you consider comparable.  That explains the desire to make it work as a display.\nDeciding on this being possible depends on how much you value your time, value the display in the computer, and believe in your skills in computer repair.  It might be worth something in parts to someone, so you may be able to sell it to cover some of the replacement costs.  If it's not booting though then it's likely not all that valuable to anyone.\nIf it were my computer I'd be reluctant to toss it too, and find a way to keep it running in some manner.  How hard is it to open up?  Have you looked around inside to see if there's an obvious input to the display?  If the insides are undecipherable to you then repairs might not be worth your time.\n", "Q: What options to mirroring iPad display to Windows 10 PC that balance cost and performance?

For 3 months I just used one, but now, trying two, I find that my MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017, OS 10.15.5) gets slow--for example, my mouse pointer lags. In fact, even with one external monitor there is some lag.\nHow can I prevent this?\nFull configuration is  shown below.\n\n\nA: Is the laptop getting enough power?  This model of MacBook Pro has two graphics chips and will shutdown one of them if it sees a need to conserve power.  That could explain the video lag.  Are you using the original power supply?  Is there some device plugged in that could be drawing significant power from the laptop?\n", "Q: Is it worth unsplitting my fusion drive? I was messing around with my iMac and got to a point where I had to reinstall the OS, but it turned out the Fusion Drive had split into a 1 TB hard drive and a 24 GB flash drive. After looking around I found that you can unsplit the Fusion Drive with a Terminal Command in Recovery Mode but that would involve reinstalling macOS afterwards.\nThere doesn't seem to be a way to fix the split fusion drive without losing my data (or rather, having to restore it from a backup which in my experience is not only a tedious process but also doesn't restore everything...). So I was wondering if you guys think it would be worth it to fix the fusion drive and reinstall the OS or if a split fusion drive is not necessarily a problem.\nWhat are the drawbacks/benefits of having a split fusion drive?\nI have a 2017 iMac 27-inch currently running macOS 10.15.6 Beta.\n\nA: \nWhat are the drawbacks/benefits of having a split fusion drive?\n\nI think the first thing is to define what the purpose of a fusion drive is.  A fusion drive was created to so you could get the performance benefits of an SSD while simultaneously getting the value of and capacity of a spinning magnetic drive.\n“Fused together” you get a single virtual drive out of two very different physical drives - a small, but fast solid state drive and a slow, but large magnetic drive.  Compared to a single solid state drive, it’s nowhere as fast but then again it’s nowhere as slow as a magnetic drive, but it is convenient because it manages where data resides - commonly used files are stored on the SSD and less commonly used files on the magnetic one.\nSplitting it, you end up manually managing what goes where, but now the SSD is unburdened by the slowness of the spinning media.  You will get a speed increase of the files you put on it.  As far as files you “archive away,” they get to reside on the slower magnetic one, but since they’re rarely accessed, speed is not of a concern.\nThis has been tried countless times before Fusion dives existed.  Everyone that I have known that tried to install an OS on a smaller, faster drive and the data, home directories, and applications stored on a larger, slower drive have abandoned this because it ended up being a royal PITA.\nGo \"All In\"\nIMO, “messing around with it” is a waste of time because you end up with less than what you started with.  If you’re going undertake reconfiguring your fusion drive, go “all in”. Open the iMac and swap out the spinning media for an SSD.  If you really want to step things up, change out that smaller PCIe SSD for a larger one as well.  Depending on your budget, you could have an 8TB (or more) Fusion drive; or you could have a super fast 4TB drive in RAID 0; or a data secure RAID 1 - all software RAID of course.  You could also have a super fast, internal Time Machine backup drive.  Now, you've got options.\nTL;DR\nUnless you're going to open up your iMac and make a significant change like swapping out the 3.5\" HDD for an SSD, there's no benefit to tweaking around with your existing Fusion Drive because in it's factory default configuration, you're going to get the best performance in terms of speed and usage as well as value for the money possible.\n\nA: If you split the parts of a Fusion Drive, the drives are left in a meaningless state. You cannot re-fuse the drive and recover your data.\nRestoring a complete snapshot should restore everything, assuming everything has been backed up.\nThe drawbacks of having a split Fusion drive are that the 24 GB SSD is too small to be an effective system volume, and the 1TB hard drive is as slow as ... well, a hard drive.\nFrom personal experience, I've found that the performance diminishes as the Fusion drive gets more full. I eventually split my Fusion, and replaced the SSD with a 1TB SSD drive, which was noticeably faster than the Fusion. That might be harder to do in an iMac, but you can always run an external drive from Thunderbolt or even USB 3 at a reasonable speed.\n\nA: Yes - if your goal is to get the most speed out of your hardware, I would make a backup and let macOS rebuild a fusion drive. It’s way faster that way than alone and less fuss.\nThe only upside of keeping things split is you can learn how to do storage management manually, learn and then run benchmarks. If that’s your goal - absolutely let things be split and try to see small installs, different filesystem layouts, but I’m assuming you are asking how best to use what you have as opposed to make changes or stay split.\nThere’s no downside to not using the fusion drive other than losing speed and having more drives show up.\n\nA: This happened to me after a botched OS upgrade failed to upgrade the filesystem to APFS.\nI did the unsplit, recovered from a time machine backup (taken before the OS upgrade), and everything was back to normal.\nIf you have a time machine backup and just want to restore to the state before the drive was split, unsplitting and recovering from backup is definitely worthwhile.\n", "Q: Unable to access jarfile server.jar I am trying to add ram to my Minecraft server.

Notice the name at the top of the window and the name at the bottom of the window. Can someone tell me if this is normal or do i have a problem?\n\n\nA: Macintosh HD is the partition name. The mount point is /, however. Other volumes are mounted in the /Volumes/ directory, such as /Volumes/MyDisk, if MyDisk is the name of the partition. This is similar to how Windows operates, where the boot disk is always C:\\.\nI'm not sure why Finder is showing it as /, though. On both my Mojave and Sierra machines, it shows \"Macintosh HD\". I don't have the bottom info bar, so that may be the reason.\n\nA: The Finder normally uses the folder name in its window titles, but a preference can be set to show the POSIX path.  From the Terminal, the following command will set the preference, where true will show POSIX paths, and false will just use the name - in earlier systems the Finder may need to be restarted for it to take effect (the killall part):\ndefaults write com.apple.finder _FXShowPosixPathInTitle -bool false; killall Finder\n\n", "Q: My Mac Book Pro switch between charge and not charge when running a long program When I am running a very long program (e.g. A long python script) and when I plug in the charger, my laptop will switch between charging and not charging very frequently. However, if I stop that script, my laptop will charge normally when it is plugged in.\nDoes anyone know what might be causing this and how to fix it?\n\nA: There's actually nothing you need to fix - it is intended behavior.\nConsider that your laptop at idle is consuming (fictious numbers) 10W of power. You plugin a 61W power adapter, and it starts charging the battery at a rate up to 51W. I.e. this means that the power from the power adapter is used to power the computer primarily, and secondly to charge the battery.\nNow you run a very power hungry program on your computer, and the computer starts to use 65W of power. Now all the power from the power adapter is used to power the computer, and the battery is also discharged slowly. This means that the status on the display will change from \"charging\" to \"not charging\".\nYour Python script most probably does different things at different times - some that take a lot of power and some that take less power. As a result, you'll see that some times the battery is being charged, and at other times it is not being chargd.\n", "Q: How to select photos from an album using smart ablum like rules I imported all images in my iPhone to Photos app in my macOS. While I imported them, I specified an album titled \"old iPhone\". The images contain both camera pictures and screenshots. Now I want to move the screenshots in \"old iPhone\" album to another album, say, \"screenshots\". Since there are thousands of images in the \"old iPhone\" album, I wonder if there is a simple way for me to select all screenshots (like the rules used when creating smart album)? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I think out a way to do it:\n\n*\n\n*Create a smart album by using two rules: album is 'old iPhone' and photo isn't screenshot.\n\n*Then create a regular album and move all images in the above album to it. In this way I created a regular album containing only camera pictures from 'old iPhone'.\n\n*Use similar steps to create a regular album containing only screenshots from 'old iPhone'.\n\n*Remove 'old iPhone' album.\n\nThe smart album created in step 1 is a temporary album. I need to introduce it because, as far as I can tell, that's the only way to select files using rules rather than manually. On the other hand, I can't just use it for final result, because if I understand it correctly, after the 'old iPhone' album is deleted, it will contain nothing.\nI haven't actually tried the above approach because this is my first day using the Photo app on macOS and I'd like to see if there is any better approach.

Moreover, the Mac Pro has got an HDMI output, which is also connected to bus 0.\nApparently however, if you want to get three 4K displays to work, you have to plug one of them into a port from bus 1, one into a port from bus 2 and one directly into the HDMI-port for some reason. (I assume that this will not be a problem as you are using Thunderbolt to HDMI adapters anyway)\nFor more detailed information, please take a look at: How do I connect a 3rd 4K monitor to my 2013 Mac Pro?\nGood luck!\n\nA: Remember that this model of Mac Pro came out in 2013, 4K/60Hz came to DisplayPort 1.2 in 2010, and 4K/60Hz came to HDMI 2.0 in 2013.  HDMI 1.4, which is supported on this model, supports 4K video at only 30Hz.  It looks like there were updates to the operating system and drivers that added some more support for 4K displays but that doesn't change the hardware behind the HDMI port the computer has, or any other hardware limits on HDMI 2.0 support.\nPassive DP to HDMI cables and adapters will simply advertise to the GPU that it can speak HDMI up to version 2.0 and assuming the GPU supports it that's what it will get, and this will give 4K at 60Hz.  Active DP to HDMI cables and adapters advertise themselves as a DP device to the GPU and do the HDMI conversion itself, meaning the video source can support an older version of DP to get 4K/60Hz.\nThis model of Mac Pro will support three 4K HDMI displays but not at 60Hz, for that you need DisplayPort.  To get 4K/60HZ to your HDMI display mean you need to make it look like a DP display to the GPU.\nMy best guess is that you are using passive DP to HDMI cables.  Passive cables will require a video source that supports DisplayPort 1.3 to get HDMI 2.0 signals out of it.  And DisplayPort 1.3 was not published until 2014.\nPerhaps an active adapter like this would work: https://www.startech.com/AV/display-and-video-adapters/Displayport-Adapters/mdp-hdmi-2-adapter-4k~MDP2HD4K60S\nI have not tried this adapter myself, your milage may vary.
