One is 500GB HDD and the other is 32GB mSATA used for caching purpose and fast booting using IRST). I want to dual boot ubuntu alongside windows 8 that is currently installed on it. But I am not getting the option to install ubuntu alongside windows. Last time when I tried to install ubuntu my windows crashed.\nPlease help me out with detailed instruction. \n\nA: I don't know your knowledge of linux so, I'm writing the steps in a little detail. In any case you feel uncomfortable Please write back to me, I will be glad to assist.\n1. Back up Windows\nThere are two steps to backing up Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a recovery drive for backing up Windows 8.1\n\n*Create a file history for backing up personal files\nFor the recovery drive you will need a USB flash drive with at least 16gb of space. Insert the USB drive into your computer. You should make sure that you have no data that you need to keep on the drive as it will be wiped during this process. If you don't have a USB drive you can create recovery DVDs.\n\n\nFor the file history backup I would recommend using an external hard drive but it depends on how much data you have. If you don't have much then a USB drive will do. If you have nothing else to hand you can backup to DVDs. \n2. Create a bootable Ubuntu USB drive\nI assume you are well aware of how to create a bootable drive.\n3. Shrink your Windows partition\nWindows takes up the whole of the drive when it is first installed. In order to install Ubuntu you will need to make space for it.\nPress the \"super key\" (Windows key) on your keyboard and click the magnifying glass in the top right corner. In the search box start typing \"Partitions\".\nClick on the option called \"Create and format partitions\". This will bring up the \"Disk Management\" screen.\n\n\nA screen will appear showing how much you can shrink the drive by. You can of course choose to shrink the drive by less than offered but never go for any more than offered as you will break your Windows 8.1 operating system if you do.\nClick \"Shrink\" to continue.\nWhen you are finished you will see that there is a lot of unpartitioned space. This is where Ubuntu will be installed.\n4. Turn off fast boot\nTo be able to boot to your Ubuntu USB drive you will need to turn off the fast boot option.\nPress the \"super\" key (Windows key) and then click the magnifying glass in the top right corner.\nEnter \"Control Panel\". Click on the \"Control Panel\" option that appears.\nWhen the \"Control Panel\" appears click on the \"System and Security\" heading.\n\nNow click on \"Power Options\".\nOn the following screen click on \"Choose what the power button does\".\n\n5. Turn off secure boot\nIn theory you don't need to do this any more. In practise it is almost certain that you will.\nTurning off secure boot depends on the make and model of your computer as each one has slightly different methods for turning it off.\nBasically though click on the \"super\" key (Windows key) and then click on the power icon next to your user name.\nHold down the shift key on your keyboard and select restart computer. Keep the shift key held down until your computer reboots.\nYou will now have an option to go into your UEFI boot settings. \nWithin the UEFI settings look for the option to turn off secure boot. You don't have to switch to legacy mode and you shouldn't switch to legacy mode as this will not help your cause.\nSave and exit the UEFI settings\n6. Install Ubuntu\nWhen you have turned off secure boot, save and reboot. You will probably end up back in Windows.\nNow at this point to boot into Ubuntu on the USB drive I had to again hold down the shift key whilst rebooting the computer. \nOne of the options that appeared let me boot from the USB drive into Ubuntu 14.04 live and you should have a similar option available to you.\n\nWhen you first boot into the live version of Ubuntu you will be presented with a screen similar to the one above. The only difference is that I have closed the window that shows all the keyboard shortcuts to make it easier to highlight the \"Install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\" icon.\nTo begin the installation double click on the \"Install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\" icon.\nThe first thing you need to do is decide which language you would like to use.\nUnless you feel like the challenge isn't great enough I would choose the language that you would normally use.\nClick \"Next\" to continue.\n\nThe next screen lets you choose which internet connection to use whilst installing Ubuntu.\nI always opt for not wanting to connect and there is a good reason for that.\nI live in the countryside and my internet connection is poor. I don't want the installer failing half way through because the connection dropped.\nI prefer to install the operating system and run updates as a separate task later on.\nIf you have a good broadband connection you may wish to connect to it now so that you download updates as you go. This will slow down the initial install but will save time later on as you won't have to install lots of updates.\n\nWhen you click \"Next\" you will be shown a tick list highlighting how prepared you are for installing Ubuntu.\nAs you can see I have 2 ticks because I have enough disk space and I am plugged into a power source. I chose not to connect to a network as this stage (hence the cross).\nClick \"Continue\".\n\n\nThe next screen may look rather intimidating but it is just showing your current disk layout.\n*> Be very careful with the next few steps. \n\nIf you haven't taken that Windows backup, quit the installation,\n  reboot and follow step 1 of this tutorial again.*\n\nLook at the image above. You will see a large portion of free space (710155 MB). This is where I put Ubuntu.\nThe free space is going to be split into 3.\nThe first partition is for Ubuntu and will be 50 Gigabytes in size.\nThe second partition is for your home partition and stores configuration files and your personal files such as music, pictures etc.\nThe third partition is for swap space and is used for intensive operations and suspending the computer.\nWhen you have found the partition with free space, click on it and press the plus symbol (+) under the disk layout.\nMAKE THE PARTITION ACCORDING TO YOUR REQUIREMENTS\nPress \"Install Now\" to continue.\nThe installation has now begun but whilst it is taking place you are asked a few configuration type questions.\nFirst of all choose your location by clicking on the map.\nPress \"Continue\".\nThe next screen asks you to choose your keyboard layout.\nSimply choose the correct one for you and press \"Continue\"\nYou will now be required to create a default user.\nEnter your name, a name to identify your computer, a username and a password.\nYou can also choose whether to log in automatically or require a password each time.\nA progress bar will now show you how far through the installation you are.\nYou can also view a selection of messages telling you all about Ubuntu.\nAt this point you can take another comfort break and depending on your computer's speed you will either have time to boil an egg or wash your car.\n\nAt the end of the process you will be asked whether you want to reboot to start using Ubuntu or to continue using the live version.\nWhen I rebooted it went straight back into Windows and I had to reboot back into the live session anyway. So at this point you can either take my word for it and stay in the live session or you can reboot and see if the installation has worked without any further steps required.\n7. Boot Repair\nI am going to assume that you chose to restart now and your computer booted straight into Windows without giving the option for Ubuntu.\nLog into Windows and click the power icon next to your username in the top right corner.\nHold down the shift key and select to restart your computer. Keep the shift key held down until your computer reboots.\nAt the point of the UEFI settings appearing choose to boot from USB again.\nYou will now be booted back into the live session of Ubuntu.\nClick on the network icon in the top right corner and choose your network connection. You will probably need to enter the security key. (If not then when you have finished with this process consider checking your router settings because your internet connection is wide open).\nNow open up a terminal by pressing the \"super\" key (Windows key) and typing \"term\".\nWithin the terminal window enter the following commands one by one.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo sh -c \"sed -i 's/trusty/saucy/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yannubuntu-boot-repair-trusty.list\"\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nEventually the boot repair screen will appear.\n\nClick on the \"Recommended repair\".\nWhen I did this I received a message stating \"EFI is detected\". This is just an informational message as far as I am concerned because it is perfectly fine to install Ubuntu with EFI turned on.\nAfter clicking \"OK\" to the EFI detected message the utility performed a few tasks and then asked me to select some text and run it in a terminal window.\nIf you are asked to do this open a new terminal window (press the \"super\" key, enter \"term\" into the Dash and click on the icon that appears).\nCopy the text from the boot repair window by selecting it with the mouse. Press CTRL and C and then right click in the terminal window and select paste.\nMake sure all the commands have run correctly. You may need to press return to get the last command to run.\nNow click on the \"Forward\" button within the boot repair application.

Fix the boot loader\nAlmost there now. \nReboot your computer.\nUnless you are lucky it will still boot straight into Windows and actually this is ok because we are going to use Windows to fix the boot loader.\nLog into Windows and make sure you are viewing the desktop and not the tiles screen.\nHover the mouse in the bottom left corner and right click. You should see an option for the administrator's command prompt. Click on this option.\nWithin the administrator's command prompt type the following command:\nbcdedit /set \"{bootmgr}\" path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nExit the command prompt.\n\n\n*Reboot into Ubuntu\n\n\nReboot your computer.\nThis time when the computer boots you should see 4 options.\n1.

For years I am considering Ubuntu (or any Linux distribution) far secure than Windows. But when I read Most vulnerable operating systems and applications in 2014 I couldn't believe it.\nThat's why I searched again, and I got a simlar explanation in Apple, Linux, not Windows, most vulnerable operating systems in 2014\nNow I am in confusion. Is Ubuntu really is secure than Windows?\n\nA: First of all, there are many different security and safety aspects. In some of them, Windows is more secure than Linux, while in others, less secure.\nAs for the past, Windows is well known for its hundreds or even thousands of security bugs in last 20 years. However, this is just the past. Microsoft since 2003 tries to improve security skills in their teams and make each new Windows edition more and more secure.\nAs for Ubuntu - it's a clone of Debian, which is generally secure by default. However there are a few key differences between Debian and Ubuntu: Ubuntu is configured in a different manner, to be more simple to learn and use for ordinary users, than Debian.\nThis enforces some security implications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu has newer, less tested packages, with possible new, not yet spotted bugs (while Debian has at least 1-year old, \"frozen\" packages, with only security and other major bugs fixed)\n\n*Ubuntu has PPA user-mode repositories - it's easier to accidentally install rogue software through PPA than through traditional Debian repositories\n\n*Ubuntu has less strict package maintaining process - search for ownCloud maintainer problems, or Sun Java problems\n\n*Ubuntu desktop install several custom movie-watching-related software, that is not covered by security team, furthermore, localized versions (at least Polish version) install even more such software\n\n*Ubuntu sudo configuration allows possible rogue software to catch only the user's password to gain root privileges (no separate root password, like in classic Linux systems)\nIf you're looking for more secure alternative to Ubuntu, you should try Debian.\n", "Q: Playonlinux on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS: unmet dependency error Iam not able to install playonlinux on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. following msg is being displayed\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\nplayonlinux: Depends: python:any (>= 2.7.1-0ubuntu2) but it is a virtual package\n         Depends: imagemagick but it is a virtual package\n\n\nA: Try running \nsudo apt-get update\n\nTo update the package sources followed by\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nTo resolve unmet dependencies.\n", "Q: Remove Audio Streams of videos - recursively without converting audio or video with FFMPEG Lets say for example you have a season of a TV show, the best encode you can find, but it has multiple audio streams, that you don't need.

From other posts I have read it has to do with 64/32 bit, but I have downloaded the 32 bit version of Teamspeak from here. \nI ran the .run file and it produced a folder, in which it contained a .sh file. When that file is run by double clicking, nothing happens (no error or anything), when it is run from terminal it says cannot execute binary file: Exec format error.\nIs this an issue with my operating system, hardware, or Teamspeak? \nHow could I go about getting the ts3 client working? \n\nA: Raspberry Pi is based on an ARM computing architecture, but Teamspeak \nis available only for x86 (\"32-bit\") and AMD64 (\"64-bit\") architecture. Each binary executable file has a flag, that describes its format and target architecture. If they mismatch the host (the machine supposed to run the executable) architecture, Linux platforms will (typically) print the error mentioned in your question.\nConclusion: You cannot install Teamspeak (Client or Server) on a Raspberry Pi or other ARM-based computers.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 not using swap I am running Ubuntu 15.04 on my Dell laptop.\nFor some reason Ubuntu is not using swap.\nThe swap partition is created:\nDevice     Boot     Start        End    Sectors   Size Id Type\n/dev/sda1  *         2048     718847     716800   350M  7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda2          718848  212721663  212002816 101.1G  7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda3       212721664  422436507  209714844   100G 83 Linux\n/dev/sda4       422436864 1953523711 1531086848 730.1G  5 Extended\n/dev/sda5       422438912  439216127   16777216     8G 82 Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda6       439218176 1953523711 1514305536 722.1G 83 Linux\n\nfstab looks like this:\n/dev/sda3       /       ext4    errors=remount-ro       0       1\n/dev/sda5       none    swap    defaults                0       0\n/dev/sda6       /data   ext4    errors=remount-ro       0       0\n\nmount -l | grep sda only displays these\n/dev/sda3 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered)\n/dev/sda6 on /data type ext4 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered)\n\nRunning swapon makes no difference.\nfree -h display this:\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          7.7G       5.4G       2.3G       156M       533M       1.2G\n-/+ buffers/cache:       3.7G       4.0G\nSwap:           0B         0B         0B\n\nSome help would be appreciated\n\nA: So the problem is the total - 0GB, the only difference I could find is that on my (Fedora) system fstab looks like this:\n/dev/mapper/fedora-swap  swap  swap  defaults  0  0\n\nThe /dev part is different because I use LVM, the difference is in the second parameter, at you that is none, here is swap\n\nA: Seems like it does want a UUID\nRecreated with: sudo mkswap /dev/sda5\nAdded to fstab: UUID=ee482d21-82e2-4666-aad2-07e4a9d14416 none swap sw 0 0\nRun: sudo swapon --all\nChecked with: sudo free\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:       8077992    6407896    1670096     201436     249436     905480\n-/+ buffers/cache:    5252980    2825012\nSwap:      8388604          0    8388604\n\nNow it is working\n", "Q: Rename *FINAL.mkv to *.mkv keeping original \"*\" So I have a bunch of files created with the name *FINAL.mkv and I have a (1st) script to remove all the files except files with FINAL.mkv \nI need help renaming the new files back to the original *.mkv, any help appreciated!\nExample file tree:\nStargate.mkv\n\nStargateFINAL.mkv\n\nNow after 1st script\nStargateFINAL.mkv\n\nWhat I want to end up with (this is in regard to recursive converting of videos)\nStargate.mkv\n\n\nA: Assuming the word FINAL comes only once in the filenames, you can do:\nrename -n 's/FINAL//' *.mkv\n\nThis will do the dry run.

Can anyone give me a reason as to how that happened?\n\nA: Your question does not match up with my experience using Ubuntu in regards to phones (and I have had a few). \nUbuntu understands and recognizes foreign filesystems (ie. NTFS, FAT and many more) and will let you use them. If a storage medium has a valid filesystem on it, Ubuntu will be happy to use it OR error out if it is an unknown or a broken filesystem. \nHeck, there is NO device in the world that gets formatted by a Linux system without a user at least confirming once. And even then, you also will need permissions to do such a thing. Ubuntu cannot format a micro SD card on a Windows phone that is not rooted and you either would need 3rd party software to do that or need to type in the commands to do so. \nEven if the storage medium is broken and there are errors making it impossible to find a filesystem and Ubuntu would even see it as unformatted, it would not format it but throw an error when you try to access it. \nIf it was a formatting of the storage medium, it is more likely that your Windows system did this (1 example of Windows phones messing with userdata).\nCould it be you did not properly unmount the card from the phone before unplugging it? That would be pretty much similar to what you describe here.\n\nhow do i recover my data?\n\nRestore a backup? Restoring data from a Windows device is off topic but you will find good results on Super User (our sister site regarding Windows). For instance: Recover data from an SD mentions PhotoRec (and testdisk). I hope you get it sorted out though. On some phones, you cannot read the internal SD card with PhotoRec though and it might be impossible to get the deleted data back.\n", "Q: How to Zip and Unzip a directory and its files in Linux I am a newbie in Linux.Whats is the complete process to zip and unzip a directory and its files.Please mention if any installation has to be done.\n\nA: You can use the zip and unzip command line utilities. These can be installed by running\nsudo apt-get install zip unzip\n\nin the terminal.\n\nA: I know several ways, but since you're new on linux. So I'll tell you how to zip a file using GUI method (the easiest way).\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new folder and fill it with anything you want, for example many of file (In my case, I'll fill it with theme folder) :\n\n\n\n\n*Right click the folder you want to zip and select \"Compress...\" option : \n\n\n*You can choose which file format you want by clicking combobox next to \"Filename\" textbox. Also you can set the folder you want to zip location.\n\nClicking \"Other options\" will lead you to password section, in other word you can set password for your preferred file so someone (include you) have to enter password before unzip the file. \n\n\n\n*Click create if done\n\n\nA: You say you are a newbie. Maybe you got Windows-experiences. If you do not have the packages installed yet, you need to \nsudo apt-get install zip gzip tar\n\nfirst (or by a graphical pkg-manager).\nThen, for an entry it would be the easiest way to use zip/unzip:\nzip -r my_arch.zip my_folder\n\nwhere -r means \"recursive\".\nTo unzip you simply use\nunzip my_arch.zip\n\nZip stores relative path names by default. There are several parameter-options available for zip. For that read: the manual (man zip). For a starting this will do.\nMost often you will see .tar.gz endings in linux-world. That's the product of two tools: TAR (the tape archiver) and GZIP (the GNU-Zip).\nTar has got the call option to automatically gzip/gunzip files after \"taring\".\ntar -cvzf may_arch.tar.gz my_folder\n\nwhere \n\n\n*\n\n*-c means \"create\"\n\n*-v means \"verbose\" (sometimes bothersome and slowing down...)\n\n*-z means \"use (GNU)zip\"\n\n*-f XYZ declares the name of the output file.

To ensure no one uses a destructive test and just copy-pastes the stuff without reading the explanation, you have to type the next command all in lower-case.\n\nWARNING\n         Never use the -w option on a device containing an existing file system.  This option erases data! If you want to do write-mode testing\n  on an existing file system, use the -n option instead.  It is slower,\n  but it will preserve your data.\n\nSo to be absolutely sure it's broken (or not) do a:\nsudo BadBlocks -w -s -o /tmp/BadBlocks.log /dev/XdY\n\nWhere X and Y are s and b\nIf you get errors while executing the BadBlocks command: the USB stick is irreparably broken.  Throw it away and buy a new one.\nAnd if it would give you no errors, you're in luck: just re-format with gparted but create an msdos partition table first.\nSorry to be the very likely harbinger of bad news.\n\nA: Open a terminal, sudo -i to become root.\nRun fdisk or parted, delete all partitions, create a new one. Use the fat32 option for type.\nRun mksfs -t fat32 /dev/sdb (assuming you haven't moved your USB).\nDone.\nIf that doesn't work, consider providing details as suggested above.

I find that the default shell that I use when I start Terminal (with Ctrl+Alt+T) is /bin/bash. \nAnd running the built-in command type on bash as: \ntype -p bash\n\nreturns the result as:\n/bin/bash\n\nSuggesting the same executable is run when I do Ctrl+Alt+T or say bash.\nThis shell is the same as an invocation of the command bash with some of its options passed to it right? If yes, what are these options? \nAs an example, perhaps the -i option gets passed so as to make the bash shell interactive? \nPS: Maybe this is related too, but I cannot seem to piece together all the pieces here. \n\nA: Usually, no, the terminal does not pass any options to bash. bash does, however, assume a set of default options depending on how it was invoked. From man bash, section INVOCATION:\nAn interactive shell is one started without  non-option  arguments  and\nwithout the -c option whose standard input and error are both connected\nto terminals (as determined by isatty(3)), or one started with  the  -i\noption.   PS1 is set and $- includes i if bash is interactive, allowing\na shell script or a startup file to test this state.\n\nAn interactive shell further activates other options.\nFurther some defaults apply based on the invocation name (sh vs bash). Reading on (section on set):\n-h      Remember  the location of commands as they are looked up\n        for execution.  This is enabled by default.\n-m      Monitor mode.  Job control is enabled.  This  option  is\n        on  by  default  for  interactive shells on systems that\n        support it (see JOB CONTROL above)\n-B      The  shell performs brace expansion (see Brace Expansion\n        above).  This is on by default.\n-H      Enable !  style history substitution.  This option is on\n        by default when the shell is interactive.\n\nCombined, simply invoking bash on a terminal will enable these options.\nYou can confirm this by checking the value of the $- special variable:\n$ echo $-\nhimBH\n\nAn additional option that maybe set is if your terminal is set to start login shells. In that case -l is explicitly passed by the terminal as an option.\n", "Q: How can you change Unity's theme from the command line?

I'm going to reward the given question with the bounty.\n\nA: To kill the ssh-agent process, you can just simply use the ssh-agent -k command.\nHowever, you might get the following error message:\n\nSSH_AGENT_PID not set, cannot kill agent\n\nIt's related to the subshell that invoked by your command within   parentheses. The parent shell can't see the variables that were generated in the subshell, making the SSH_AGENT_PID empty.\nYou can change the one-liner into:\nps -u $(whoami) | grep ssh-agent &> /dev/null\nif [ $? -ne 0 ];then\n    eval $(ssh-agent)\n    ssh-add\nfi\ntrap 'ssh-agent -k; exit' 0\n\nThe last line will kill the agent for you when you log out the system.\nBut please note that this only works with one session, let's say, if you login with second session, then the second session won't be blessed by the ssh-agent that you authorized in the first session. You will need to workaround it by exporting the SSH_AGENT_PID and SSH_AUTH_SOCK in the second session to make it work. You can do it by printing these two variable into a temporary file, and load it in .bashrc, a quick example:\nps -u $(whoami) | grep ssh-agent &> /dev/null\nif [ $? -ne 0 ];then\n    eval $(ssh-agent)\n    ssh-add\n    echo \"export SSH_AGENT_PID=$SSH_AGENT_PID\" > ~/.agent-profile\n    echo \"export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$SSH_AUTH_SOCK\" >> ~/.agent-profile\nelse\n    source ~/.agent-profile\nfi\ntrap 'ssh-agent -k; exit' 0\n\nHave fun.\nEdit:\nDon't forget to kill all your ssh-agents before you try this in your .bashrc, otherwise it will fail to call ssh-agent as there is already a running one.\n\nA: I used solution2(source ~/.agent-profile) It worked for me before killing ssh-agent processes.\nAfter two days I killed all past ssh-agent processes. getting the below error and number of ssh-agent processes increasing for each login.\n[username@i3-dljump01 ~]$ logout\nkill: No such process\n", "Q: How to use HP's RAID driver for Smart Array B120i, e.g. ProLiant Microserver G8 At HP's Certification Matrices it is mentioned that there are no Smart Array B120i RAID controller drivers.

I use the Danish layout for leisure, and the English (US) for work.\nI would like this key to be Compose only when I am using the English (US) layout.\nSimilarly I would like Caps Lock and Escape to swap under those same circumstances.\nThat is, I need this functionality switch to \"conceptually depend\" on the keyboard layout widget's state.

For example, if I have configured my keyboard with xkb to, eg:\nsetxkbmap -layout us,fr -option \"grp:lctrl_lshift_toggle,compose:102\"\n\nand I then dump the mapping with\nxmodmap -pke | egrep -i 'less|greater|multi|caps|escape'\n\nit lists the keycodes and the keysyms of interest:\nkeycode   9 = Escape NoSymbol Escape\nkeycode  59 = comma less semicolon period horizconnector multiply\nkeycode  60 = period greater colon slash periodcentered division\nkeycode  66 = Caps_Lock NoSymbol Caps_Lock\nkeycode  94 = Multi_key Multi_key Multi_key Multi_key\n...\n\nI can simply move around the columns for the key that I want to change and set up a new mapping for it. You can guess what the columns are for by looking at the keycode for an alphabetic key like \"w\":\nkeycode  25 = w W z Z guillemotleft less\n\nThe columns in this line seem to be: us, us-shift, fr, fr-shift, fr-altgr, fr-altgr-shift.\nSo the Escape in column 1 of keycode 9 applies to my keyboard in us mode. If I want Caps_Lock in us mode I do:\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 9 = Caps_Lock NoSymbol Escape'\n\nThe change should be immediate. When you have tried all the changes, put all the new \"keycode =\" lines in a file and pipe them into xmodmap - at each login.\n", "Q: Installation of more than one version of ns-2 on the same machine I have an already working installation of NS 2.35 in my machine.\nI need to install NS 2.27 on the same machine.

Dropbox icon is missing in the top panel. However, it is displayed corectly when I run Unity. I tried stop and start Dropbox, reinstall it but it is not working.\nUpdate: It seems there are more broken things for me than working, so I am going to install 14.04 LTS.\n\nA: libappindicator1 may be the answer but in many cases it isn't.\nThe following has been submitted to www.dropbox.com as a bug but linux users don't appear to be a high priority.\n\nIn dropbox's preferences, if you check Start Dropbox on system startup, the daemon will start and dropbox will be working in the background, but the icon will not appear.  This is apparently because the dropbox autostart config file ~/.config/autostart/dropbox.desktop insists on setting a startup delay of zero but displaying the icon requires some other process to be running already... and in many cases it is not, especially when a number of other startup applications are starting up / running.\nIn Ubuntu's System Settings/Startup Applications, if you set the startup delay  for dropbox to 10 seconds or more, the process works properly and the icon appears... once. Then dropbox resets its startup file ~/.config/autostart/dropbox.desktop back to a delay of zero and the problem returns.\nWorkaround: uncheck the dropbox's preference Start Dropbox on system startup, write a short script that starts dropbox, add the script to Startup Applications and set the delay to 10 seconds or more as needed by the Ubuntu distro and by other startup settings.\nPermanent fix: dropbox should stop rewriting the delay in the autostart file ~/.config/autostart/dropbox.desktop or make the delay a preference.\nSample script:\n #!/bin/bash\n dropbox stop  #because the actual daemon usually IS running\n dropbox start\n exit\n\nSave it as something like fix-dropbox-icon.sh. Remember to make it executable in the permissions.__\nUnrelated point of interest. After doing this I reviewed my Startup Applications list and changed everything that I don't consider immediately vital for a startup delay of 30 seconds or more. Now my Ubuntu startup is MUCH faster. Of course I have a lot of stuff there.

And so no internet connection.\nThis has the following reason: every network card has a unique MAC address. This address is ingrained in your NIC. The DHCP server in your router remembers this MAC address.\nWhen you access the internet in Windows and then reboot in Linux, in many cases you'll get no IP address from the DHCP server in your router. Because this server will recall that it previously issued an IP address for that very same MAC address, and won't issue a new one.\nYou can solve this by forcing Windows to release the IP address, before you reboot the PC. By the way: Linux by default does release the IP address on shutdown. So a reboot from Linux into Windows causes no problems.\nTip: Did you forget to force Windows to release the IP address, and you don't want to boot Windows to do it as yet? Then simply boot Ubuntu or Linux Mint twice in a row. After the second boot of Ubuntu or Mint you can probably connect.\nA. Manual method\n  1. Open a DOS window in Windows\nWindows XP:\n  Start - Programs - Accessories - Command Prompt\nWindows 7:\n  Start - All Programs - Accessories - Command Prompt\n\n  \n*Type:\n  ipconfig /release\n  \n  \n  (note the space between ipconfig and /release)\nAnd press Enter.\nB. Semi-automatic method\n  By means of a shortcut on your desktop, you can apply a semi-automatic solution for this.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open Notepad\n  Windows XP: Start - Programs - Accessories - Notepad\n  \n*type the following text:\n  ipconfig /release\n  \n*Save this text file as release.bat and place it on your desktop. Now you can always simply double click this file, before you exit Windows.\nAs I said, Linux releases the IP address by default on shutdown. So a reboot from Linux into Windows causes no problems.\n\n", "Q: \"Inactive memory\" management on Linux One of the problems that i face to many times a week on Linux is the inactive memory management. \nWhenever i copy a a huge file or open a program like Matlab on my Ubuntu i notice that there is a huge amount of inactive memory remaining on my systems and my system slows down.\nAlthough i can free it up by dropping caches (sysctl vm.drop_caches), But i still want to know why Linux doesn't manage it better? What are those inactave memory for after a copying process is finished?!\nIs this a problem? If yes, How can it be solved?\n\nA: Inactive memory is basically a cache, which makes consecutive operations faster. For example, that makes the second launch of Firefox significantly faster, than the first one.\nYou can be quite sure that this does not make your system slower. When there is a need of RAM, Linux (the kernel) can drop these immediately.\nSo actually, what you think as a deficiency, is actually a pretty amazing piece of engineering. Obligatory reference: \"Linux ate my RAM!\"\n", "Q: Problems with booting on recovery mode I want to access my recovery mode because I have problems with my nvidia drivers. But I don't get a chance to use my shift key because I have a black screen for 10 seconds (when I boot my pc) and the next screen that I get is the screen with the Linux Mint emblem on.\nI first though that I didn't get a screen from my motherboard because my pc stood in Fast Boot but I've reset my cmos and now I'm sure it isn't.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: Instead of disabling fast boot, you can un-hide GRUB. Note that this will also show all the boot messages instead of showing the Mint splash screen. In a terminal:\nsudo -e /etc/default/grub\nComment out (put a hash in front of) the line GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0. Also change the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\", assuming you don't have any other options in there. If you do, remove quiet splash but it's up to you to make sure the options are valid.\nExit the editor with Ctrl-X, Y, Enter, then sudo update-grub.\n", "Q: Unable to load Kernel module \"uio: I am using a Ubuntu-14.04 server image.

I guess it has to be manually installed?\nOn a related note: will Chromium do better or as good as Chrome on Lubuntu 15.04 on a rather speedy Laptop (Intel i5, 8GB RAM)?\n\nA: Chrome you install from here.

To remedy this, you are going to have to reinstall Ubuntu; which, considering you have not yet booted into it, should be relatively unobtrusive. Do it the same way you installed previously, by selecting \"Something Else..\". However, when you get to the partition menu, you should notice a drop-down menu for where the bootloader should be installed. By default, it chooses the first available option. When installing to an external HDD, you need to install GRUB onto the Master Boot Record (MBR) of that drive. So, in the dropdown, you will see something similar to /dev/sdX1 /dev/sdx2 and so on, where X is the letter assigned to the HDD you are working on. You will need to select the /dev/sdX option, without a number associated with it. For example, if you are installing Ubuntu on /dev/sdb1, you will install the bootloader to /dev/sdb.\nAdditionally, as you are working on Windows 10, you may have the same issue that Windows 8/8.1 have with the system wanting only to boot Windows due to secure boot being enabled. You will have to disable this \"feature\" of Windows on newer computer models. You can do this in your BIOS settings, which differ from computer to computer. Most often, though, you will see the option as you boot to \"Press F12 to Enter Set-Up\" or something similar. Press the indicated key, navigate through your BIOS menu to Boot Options, and disable \"Secure Boot\".\nUPDATE: After some fooling around in a virtual machine, I was able to replicate your issue. By default, GRUB installs to the first partition found. You probably accidentally installed it on the first partition of your internal hard-drive when you attempted your first install. This probably means you wrote it over your Windows partition. The best you can do here is try to find a Windows 10 Boot repair disc and repair the boot partition of your internal drive. Then, Windows will be able to boot. When installing Ubuntu onto the external drive, you will not be able to go through the regular boot process to start Ubuntu. Rather, you will have to change the boot order of your machine so that it boots from USB first. This process differs depending on your BIOS.\n", "Q: Boot Problem Windows I have a little problem with boot ubuntu DVD. My OS is windows 8.1 and my computer isn't laptop.

What Synaptic does is search through the repositories in your sources, and lists all of the packages that you could download and install. These are in the \"Not Installed\" category because, well, you haven't installed them. They do not need removed, because they are not there.\nFor further clarification, the \"Not Installed (Residual Config)\" category is not showing up because you have not yet removed any additional packages that left config files behind.

Naturally, I want to try.\nIf I download a deb-file and install abc 1.5 now (and let's assume there are no dependency issues), how will that influence my system, when Version 1.5 or 1.6 comes to the repositories? Will I still be able to normally update with the repositories, or is that software then somehow weirdly 'cut out'?\nWeird question, I hope someone understands.\n\nA: This depends on whether whoever made the package honoured Ubuntu/Debian's versioning of their packages. For example, consider the Vim package:\n$ apt-cache policy vim\nvim:\n  Installed: 2:7.4.811-1~ppa1~t\n  Candidate: 2:7.4.811-1~ppa1~t\n  Version table:\n *** 2:7.4.811-1~ppa1~t 0\n        500 http://ppa.launchpad.net/pi-rho/dev/ubuntu/ trusty/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     2:7.4.052-1ubuntu3 0\n        500 http://mirror.cse.iitk.ac.in/ubuntu/ trusty/main amd64 Packages\n\nIf, say, tomorrow Vim 7.5 releases, and somebody makes a package of that with version 7.5 instead of 2:7.5, it will be \"upgraded\" to 2:7.4.811-1~... the next time I upgrade packages in my system.\nTo explain, a Debian package version has three major fields (see man 5 deb-version for more information):\n\n\n*\n\n*the epoch\n\n*the upstream version\n\n*the debian revision\nThus:\n2:7.4.811-1~ppa1~t\n¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   \n|    |       |\n|    |       --- *debian revision*\n|    --- *upstream version*\n--- *epoch*\n\nThe epoch and the debian revision are added by the packagers, and the upstream version usually comes from, well, the upstream. If the new package follows any epoch that the packages in the repository had, then things should work as expected. The debian revision isn't important in this case, since an increase in upstream version always trumps it.\n", "Q: Windows not booting after removing the partition containing ubuntu I had windows 10 and Ubuntu dual boot.\nNow I removed the partition containing Ubuntu and after doing so, I am not able to boot in windows and it shows internal hard disk is not available.\nHelp me out of this crisis.\n\nA: This has happened to me before.

I'm following this tutorial and when I'm at the point of putting this in my console:\nsudo python get-pip.py\n\nI get this error:\nzipimport.ZipImportError: can't decompress data; zlib not available\n\nIt is my understanding that this has to do with Python not being built with zip support. This may well be the case as I had no idea what I was doing when trying to install Python. What I have done to try and resolve this is to install the latest version of zlib and try it again, but when I tried it again, I still got the same error. I re-installed Python, and I'm still getting the same error. Now, I'm just getting annoyed. What can I do to fix this issue?\n\nA: Looks like you built your Python yourself and not using the default installation.

But, this file is used as an imput to a research project and I would like the system to see it as one. Additionally, I will need to specify its path in another file (a .prototxt file where I specify all the inputs to my program) and that is the reason why I want to have one path under which the system recognizes that (splitted) file. Unfortunately, the SSDs are not huge enough to hold the whole file.\nAdditionaly, when I run df -h the SSDs are show as:  \nFilesystem                           Mounted on\ncluster-name-1-int:/var/tmp/local    /import/cluster-name-1-int  \ncluster-name-2-int:/var/tmp/local    /import/cluster-name-2-int\n\nMy system is ina cluster but I do not think that this will make any difference because I have access from the cluster-name-1 machine to the SSD on the others.Lastly, I do not have root access, so please tell me if your solution needs root privilages so that I would know and find a way to implement that solution.\nEDIT: I provide as many information as I think would be useful.

That will be another thread if it turns out UEFI is the \"preferred\" way to go.\n\nA: There is almost no difference.

I have a question about bluez. I am wondering if there are any alternatives to bluez bluetooth support that I can use. The reason I am asking, is because I have a ralink 3290 bluetooth adapter, which is currently not being recognized. I know that the blue device works, because it works fine in windows. I have followed quite a few tutorials to make it work to no avail.\nWhen I compiled the driver, I managed to get it recognized, but would not pair. The adapter I am using is built-in, not sure if it makes a difference.  My questions are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there any alternatives to bluez, that might be able to recognize the bluetooth adapter?  (is this even the right question to ask?)\n\n*If so, can you name a few (or even one)?\n\n*Would there be any consequences to removing bluez, like the desktop no longer being available?\nAny and all assistance that anyone can give would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you\n\nA: Removing Bluez will result in a great deal of packages being removed, you can check that with synaptic or just read the confirmation message what will be removed. I would advise against this as it might be hard trying to reinstall needed packages for other bluetooth stacks (I haven't heard of any other than Bluez though)\nAs for recognizing the bluetooth adapter; you can check that with hciconfig. It will show you your Bluetooth Device. Using the -h  parameter also shows a list of possible options to help you troubleshoot why it is not being recognized, such as the pairing mode.  You could also try to -reset it. What are you trying to pair, by the way? The BT adapter with the PC? If so; that isn't necessary and quite impossible if I recall correctly. \nI'm not sure what you mean with \"When I compiled the driver I managed to get it recognized\" Did you use any tools and what do you mean by recognized? What driver did you compile; Bluez? \nVersions 4.x of Bluez are still distributed with Ubuntu distro's whereas the unstable branches of Debian have almost up-to-date 5.x releases of Bluez. You could try running a Debian version that has the 5.x releases of Bluez in it and see if you are able to pair or do anything. You can check your version of Bluez with bluetoothd -v. \nSwitching from 4.x to 5.x helped me a lot and fixed a lot of errors regarding my Bluetooth workflow. \n", "Q: How to Install a version 7 update 76 of java in Ubuntu?

I am new to Linux so I need to find out how to get super user privileges so I can install Simplify3D?\nThanks,\nDave \n\nA: In Linux (and Unix in general), there is a SuperUser named root. The Windows equivalent of root is the Administrators group. The SuperUser can do anything and everything, and thus doing daily work as the SuperUser can be dangerous. You could type a command incorrectly and destroy the system. Ideally, you run as a user that has only the privileges needed for the task at hand. In some cases, this is necessarily root, but most of the time it is a regular user.\nBy default, the root account password is locked in Ubuntu. This means that you cannot login as root directly or use the su command to become the root user. However, since the root account physically exists it is still possible to run programs with root-level privileges. This is where sudo comes in - it allows authorized users (normally \"Administrative\" users) to run certain programs as root without having to know the root password.\nThis means that in the terminal you should use sudo for commands that require root privileges; simply prepend sudo to all the commands you need to run as root. For more extensive usage examples, please see below. Similarly, when you run GUI programs that require root privileges (e.g. the network configuration applet), use graphical sudo (gksudo) and you will also be prompted for a password. Just remember, when sudo asks for a password, it needs YOUR USER password, and not the root account password.\nPlease refer to this link for a tutorial about sudo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPDrKrDbzys\nSource: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo\n\nA: If I may ask how will you install it? If it is through the Graphical User Interface, it will request the admin password which you registered upon installation. If you will use a terminal and commands write sudo command (your command will be sudo apt-get install name.of.app if it is your added repositories or the default Ubuntu repositories). Then it will ask for the password that you registered upon installation. Hope this helps!\n", "Q: How can I use ZSH when I use sudo commands but not as default root shell? So, I would like to keep bash as the default shell for root.\nBut, I would prefer to use zsh, my shell, when I run sudo commands, and that sudo executes also the .zshrc in /root.\nFor testing purposes, I have created an alias in my /root/.zshrc and ~/.zshrc :\nalias test1='echo \"Test OK\"'\n\nNow, when I run sudo su enter zsh enter test1 enter\nI got the expected result : Test OK\nHowever, all of these commands result in : test1: command not found\nsudo test1\nsudo su -c 'zsh -c test1'\nsudo -E zsh -c 'test1'\nsudo ZDOTDIR=/root/.zshrc test1\nsudo ZDOTDIR=/root/.zshrc zsh -c 'test1'\nsudo ZDOTDIR=/root/.zshrc zsh -c 'source /root/.zshrc && test1'\n\nI found this question on askubuntu, but I think this is more related to this one on Unix & Linux.\nHowever, none of these posts help me.\nWhat I want to achieve in final is to create a simple alias that could replace sudo when I want to use zsh with its /root/.zshrc file, and prefix the command I want to run.\nAny hints ?   \n\nA: I'm not a zsh user, but sudo zsh -c test1 is failing because the shell has not read your .zshrc file. Try this:\nsudo zsh -ic test1\n\nThat should tell zsh that this is in interactive shell, so source the .zshrc file.\n", "Q: Not able to find out g++ I have installed g++ in Ubuntu 12.04 from Ubuntu software center to write, c and c++  and to complie, but I am not able to find out where is the software gone after installation, please help me how to find it. \n\nA: Simply start:\ndpkg -L g++\n\nto list all installed files for the package g++ or use:\nwhich g++\n\nto show the path for the command g++\n\nWrite a \"hello world\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a sour-code file\nnano helloworld.cpp\n\n\n*Add the code below\n#include <iostream>                                     \nint main(){                                             \n    std::cout << \"Hello world\" << std::endl;\n    return 0;                                           \n}\n\n\n*Save the file\n\n*Compile\ng++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld\n\n\n*Start\n./helloworld\n\n", "Q: What is the Linux equivalent of C drive on SSD and D drive on HDD? I am installing Ubuntu and used to Windows, so I will make the comparisons to it.\nI have a SSD and an HDD.\nIn windows I would install the OS on the SSD (making it C drive) and put all my games and movies on the HDD (as the D drive).\nWhat's the equivalent in Linux? Mount the SSD as root (/) and the HDD as... what? Does it even need a mount point or can I just use it as /dev/sdc3? What even is a mount point? Can I do it later?\nThe options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*/\n\n*/boot\n\n*/home\n\n*/tmp\n\n*/usr\n\n*/var\n\n*/srv\n\n*/opt\n\n*/usr/local\n\n\nA: Drives aren't labeled like Windows in Linux. You can create separate partitions and/or drives for each folder (directory) or you can stack them under \"root\" /.\nAny folder you don't allocate in a separate partition will by default be under the / folder as if you had a C: drive with \\ folder.  \nI set up with HDD in anticipation of getting a 256 or 500GB SSD soon.  Here is what I would do with your layout.\nSSD:\n1 fat32 /boot/efi 380 MiB\n2 ext4  /  24GB\n3 linux swap 8GB (optional)\n4 ext4 /home remainder of drive\nHDD:\n1 ext4 /other (whole drive) \n-or-  \n1 ext4 /games (your size choice)\n2 ext4 /movies (remainder of drive)\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: In Linux, drives aren't X:, drives are \"mounted\" in folders. Instead of using D:, you'll use whatever folder you mount the drive on.\n\nA: What I ended up doing was mounting the hard disk as /hdd.\nNow I would probably mount it as /home under the impression that most bulky files (music, videos, and games) would likely be under /home/<your_name_here>/<your_media_type> (e.g., /home/Jackson/Games). This is usually the default place so I wouldn't need to bother doing anything extra like moving them to /hdd/Games.\nA caveat to this is that I personally would not need any of these things to be read/written to the disk quickly, if I did then I would want them to be on the SSD, not he HDD, so I would use a different scheme. For example, if I only had a very small number of games or I had a huge SSD I would probably put them on there. Another thing that comes to mind is high definition video editing, it's sort of the go-to example of something that needs SSDs. Of course I still could make a folder /ssd, but I think you get the idea.\n\nA: you can use gparted during the live session making a new primary NTFS partition for your data[games, movies .. etc]\nand when you boot up your distro, you'll find your new partition\nattached to a file in the path /media/your_username\n", "Q: How to get rid of panel indicator in Lubuntu 14.04? \nThe indicated icon, when right-clicked, presents a menu that is completely redundant to the right-click menu of the battery icon right beside it.  In addition, hovering over the battery icon gives a power status, while hovering over the indicated icon does nothing.\nHow can I remove this unwanted icon from my Lubuntu 14.04 panel?\n\nA: It turns out this icon is related to the Logitech USB wireless mouse.  If you unplug the dongle, the icon goes away.  When the mouse battery gets low, the icon turns red.\nThat is an OK feature, but it would be nice if it was optional.

I have legacy motherboard - Gigabyte H67MA-D2H B3. I installed Ubuntu in dual boot but on seperate HDD. Pressing F12 during boot, brings up an option to select the Boot Device listing installed HDD's etc. Select HDD where Ubuntu is installed and it will boot it.\n\nA: Found a better workaround. Just go to the boot menu in your bios and and set the \"Ubuntu\" bootloader to #1 priority(i.e. move it up the list of boot devices till it reaches the #1 in the list). Save the settings and exit. It should boot Ubuntu now or more likely show you the GRUB menu. If in the GRUB menu your Windows 10/8 bootloader is not listed(highly unlikely), don't panic. Just boot into Ubuntu, open the terminal and run \nsudo update-grub \nThis is what my system shows:\n\nIt should list the Windows 10/8 bootloader in the GRUB menu now. Hope that helps.\nP.S. This workaround only works if you have ONLY ONE HDD/SSD on your machine. \n\nA: You have to go into your uefi/bios settings and either enable legacy boot or disable secure boot, or both. I had the same problem and mixing random settings in there fixed it.\n\nA: Who manufactures your PC, if it has an OS Manager then you will have a lot of problems like me. this is because the Boot-loader for windows is set as first option in the OS Manager and will automatically boot if present.I have not found anyway to change that. but I did do the boot-repair and it fixed the issue by changing the bootloader.efi to the Ubuntu shim64.efi {grub}.\nafter this the OS manager will no longer work but the grub offers the boot options. Note the boot-repair must be installed on the hdd not on an external boot media. because it need to write and compile the files prior to recreating the bootloader.efi.\nNow that I have it working with Dual boot I will have to change it so it uses the internal ssd for the boot loader. so I will make screen shots of this.\n\nA: I have a similar problem.\nUbuntu 14.04 was installed properly, seen at the shrinked hard disk for windows 10.\nI found i could boot into ubuntu after booting into windows 10 by going to settings --> system recovery --> advanced options --> reboot the system now.\nThen you should have an option to do a recovery from usb, there i found ubuntu and was able to boot into ubuntu.\nNow i'm going to try to get grub working through this articles: Windows 10 upgrade kills grub and boot-repair doesn't help and How can I repair grub?

Also, this only seems to happen when I begin to charge my battery when it is low. When I check for signs of overheating, my laptop's exhaust is blowing cool air, while cpu temperatures register in the upper 40s to low 50s (celsius).\nOddly, my fans will never overspeed like this when I am on battery power, and I tried using i8kutils to get the fans under control when the computer is on AC, but the program turned the fans off, completely. It would, however, turn the fans back on and run them at their max speed whenever I entered a command for i8k to automatically control their speed, but this only lasted a second before the fans shut off again, as if something was conflicting with i8k. I ended up uninstalling the program.\nThe only other times my fans will run at max for prolonged periods is when I am in my BIOS settings; when I sit at the GRUB menu for a while, or when I restart my computer rather than shutting it down completely. \nI am using the latest BIOS.\nAny ideas as to why my fans do this?\n\nA: If the battery is getting your laptop hot.

I would like to do some simulation research on Ubuntu (previously I was working on Windows), the simulation data are extremely important to me and I would never want to lose any of them. But I heard that the GUI would crash sometimes, will it affect my data?\nThanks!\n\nA: Only if there is volatile data relevant to an application that would ultimately fail as a result of your GUI failing, but mainly no.\nAKA if your GUI fails and a text editor is open and the text editor dies after the GUID dies\nThen you lose whatever was unsaved in the text editor.\nBasically no.\n\nA: Just backup. No, your data should not be affected by GUI crashes, but if you really want to be safe, backup, backup, backup.\n\nA: This depends largely on how you are managing your data, and what you mean by GUI. If you use a database and you are working with that in a GUI and the GUI crashes (which honestly, I wouldn't worry too much about) then whatever has been updated/changed in your database will be found in the same state as you left it at the moment of said crash. However, as mentioned before, if you are using a text editor or spreadsheet or something like that, you will return to whatever you had the last time you saved the document. \nThere is a huge difference between using a database and a document to manage data but if you are doing simulations then I think you know that and suspect you are using a database.

First, remove any existing version.\nsudo apt-get purge firefox\n\nThen run following command to download firefox 50 source code, which comes as .tar file.\nwget http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/50.0/linux-$(uname -m)/en-US/firefox-50.0.tar.bz2\n\nExtract the package.\ntar -xjf firefox-50.0.tar.bz2\n\nMove firefox to /opt directory.\nsudo mv firefox /opt/\n\nCreate symlink in order to set the new firefox as default.\nsudo mv /usr/bin/firefox /usr/bin/firefox_old\nsudo ln -s /opt/firefox/firefox /usr/bin/firefox\n\n\n*Via UbuntuZilla which offer .deb files, to install follow the instruction below.\n\nRemove firefox first : \nsudo apt-get purge firefox\n\nRun following command to download firefox : \n32 Bit\nwget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/ubuntuzilla/mozilla/apt/pool/main/f/firefox-mozilla-build/firefox-mozilla-build_39.0.3-0ubuntu1_i386.deb\n\n64 Bit \nwget sourceforge.net/projects/ubuntuzilla/files/mozilla/apt/pool/main/f/firefox-mozilla-build/firefox-mozilla-build_39.0.3-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb\n\nInstall it : \n32 Bit\ncd Downloads/ && sudo dpkg -i firefox-mozilla-build_39.0.3-0ubuntu1_i386.deb\n\n64 Bit \ncd Downloads/ && sudo dpkg -i firefox-mozilla-build_39.0.3-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb\n\nAnd firefox should run the 39 version\nQuote from ubuntuzilla official wiki page : \n\nThis is the home of the Ubuntuzilla project, hosts an APT repository with .deb repacks of the latest official release versions of Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla SeaMonkey, and Mozilla Thunderbird.\n\n\nA: In a terminal run:\napt-cache show firefox | grep Version\n\nYou will get a list of available versions like in the list below:\nVersion: 54.0+build3-0ubuntu0.16.04.1\nVersion: 45.0.2+build1-0ubuntu1\n\nInstall the desired version with:\nsudo apt-get install firefox=45.0.2+build1-0ubuntu1\n\nPrevent Ubuntu from upgrading to the latest version:\nsudo apt-mark hold firefox\n\n\nA: While the normal repository often only contains the latest version for older Ubuntu releases, you may be able to find the previous version with the help of Google.\nGeneralizing from this blog about Firefox 43 on Ubuntu 12.04, you could search for \nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=firefox+$FF_VERSION+$UBUNTU_VERSION+deb\nThen\nsudo apt-get remove firefox\nwget \"$URL\"\nsudo dpkg -i \"firefox-....deb\"\nsudo apt-mark hold firefox\n\nThe drawback is that you won't get security upgrades for Firefox, so this is only a temporary solution.\n\nA: This is how I downgraded to Firefox 50 version from version 57.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Firefox Release archive and download a suitable version for you.\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+T to open the terminal and copy-paste this code:\nsudo apt remove firefox\n\nTo uninstall Firefox current version.\n\n*Now, go to the directory where Firefox-.tar.gz( or .tar.gz2) file is kept using the terminal or using file manager. Enter this code( if using the terminal):\ntar -xzf firefox-.tar.gz2\n\nIf using file manager, simply extract the file using the Archive Manager(Look in the context menu).\n\n*Open the folder and run the file 'firefox'.\n\n\nCaution: Don't forget to stop automatic updates in Firefox.\nThis is the way I did it. Firefox is not installed completely but it still works the way it should. Only the options and the Firefox symbol are not there.\nI recommend locking the Firefox in the launcher.\nTo create a shortcut on the desktop, go to the file and open context menu. Click on 'Make Link'. The file created is to be pasted on the desktop.\nHope this helps!:)\n", "Q: Unable to connect to: ws://hostname:5240/MAAS/ws My MAAS server has been running for several months, building OpenStack cloud configurations and tearing them down, but then it starts giving the error message\nUnable to connect to: ws://hostname:5240/MAAS/ws\n\nwhen going to to the node list. \nI have tried rebooting the server, reconfiguring maas-region-controller, everything I can think of.

What will be better, installing Windows as host machine and running Linux inside a virtual machine or other way round??? What are the pros and cons of both approaches?\n\nA: If you want less issues approach, I'd say Win-host Linux-virtual is the best for you. The biggest pro of Win-host Linux-virtual approach is drivers, in my opinion. With windows you hardly need to find drivers. With Linux, if you have Atheros or Broadcom wifi card, for instance, you may need proprietary drivers.  However, if you choose laptop wisely, with Ubuntu-certified hardware , you should have no issues in that department. Second pro, would be avoiding issues with installation, especially with UEFI and Windows 8.1. There's lots of questions on askubuntu about that.\nOtherwise, I don't see any more pros and cons. Eithern way you have a virtual machine.\n\nA: The best way is to ask yourself which is your number one OS. That one should be you primary OS and then install the secondary within the primary.\nYou can also choose dual boot but then you have to reboot a lot if you want to change the OS and Windows cannot read/write linux partitions. Then you have two sets of important files. With one OS you can have all the files on the host server accessible also by the OS running as virtual machine.\n\nA: How about duel booting? I have 2 computer that I run both on. I installed Windows 7 first then Ubuntu 14.04 and chose to duel boot using grub2. \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2\nI have not tried it with Windows 8 or 10 but I have no reason to think it would not work. \n", "Q: ip forwarding between two LANs I have 1 server which has 3 NIcs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connected to the Internet\n\n*Connected to LAN1 (10.0.0.0/24)\n\n*Connected to LAN2 (192.168.0.0/28)\nLAN2 has a server that works on a port, say 4444.\nHow can I forward traffic from a specific port between the LANs? I want that only LAN1 is able to access the Internet and LAN2 isn't. All the machines are Ubuntu 15.04\n\n\nA: The first thing to do is do enable IP forwarding. This is done either by using\necho \"1\" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n\nThen, we will add a rule telling to forward the traffic\nsudo iptables -A FORWARD -i LAN1 -o LAN0 -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A FORWARD -i LAN0 -o LAN1 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o LAN0 -j MASQUERADE\n\nOn this way LAN1 can go to internet through LAN0.\nEdit 1\nTry this\nExample to route traffic for port 4444 and you can implement for port you need for\nLet’s start from the iptable. Here we shall take 4444 as the service for routing. Use mangle table of iptable for modifying the 4444 packets. \n  sudo iptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -p tcp –dport 4444 -j MARK –set-mark 0×1\n\nWe are marking all packets with destination port 4444 as ’0×1′ .\nTo delete this entry from iptables we can use -D instead of -A.\nNext, create a new IP route table in /etc/iproute2/rt_table by just giving an entry\n100 4444table\n\nWrite rule for 4444 packets.\nip rule add fwmark 0×1 lookup 4444table\n\nAdd route at new table 4444table. Here we shall use ’192.168.1.1′ as the gateway for 4444. Address ’192.168.1.1′\nWe copy all entries except default gateway entry from main table.\n sudo ip route show table main | grep -Ev ^default | while read ROUTE ; do ip route add table 4444table $ROUTE; done\n\nAdd default gateway entry for 4444 packets to table 4444table \n  sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 table 4444table\n\nUse ip route show table 4444table to show all routes at 4444table.\n", "Q: Grub issue with dual os?

Some of them are copies of each other. I want to put those photos in one folder and I want a tool to identify the duplicate files. \nI also want some photo managers.\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: The first tool that comes to mind is digiKam. Here are some features mentioned on their site (link):\n\n\n*\n\n*import pictures \n\n*organize your collection \n\n*view items \n\n*edit and enhance\n\n*create (slideshows, calendar, print, ...) \n\n*share your creations (using\nsocial web services, email, your own web allery, ...)\n\n\nThe ony possible issue is that it's part of KDE environment, so it may bring a lot of kde dependencies.\nAnother good tool is Darktable (link). It's description from their site:\n\ndarktable is an open source photography workflow application and RAW\n  developer. A virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers. It\n  manages your digital negatives in a database, lets you view them\n  through a zoomable lighttable and enables you to develop raw images\n  and enhance them.\n\n\nA: It seems that Shotwell also has an automatic duplicated detection on the Import.\n\nFileImportJob -- Duplicate detection occurs in the main thread by\n  searching the database for photos with the same MD5 as the file. If no\n  duplicates are found, a FileImportJob is fired off. This job copies\n  the file into the library (generally ~/Pictures) if necessary or\n  requested by the user. A PhotoFileInterrogator object sniffs out the\n  file’s contents to determine various relevant information, such as the\n  photo’s dimensions, colorspace, etc. That information is used to\n  prepare a data structure for adding to the database. Thumbnails are\n  also generated during this stage.\nIf all has gone well up to this point, the file is formally imported\n  into the database. Because the thumbnail cache needs a database ID to\n  store its thumbnails, writing the thumbnails has to be delayed until\n  this point.\n\nSource: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Shotwell/Architecture/Importing#ImportQueuePage\nCheck also \"How does Shotwell detect duplicates?\" for more details.\n", "Q: Windows 10 update on dual boot, can't boot into ubuntu I decided to update my windows 7 install to windows 10, after which my grub was lost.

To use shared folders inside the virtual machine, please install the Guest Additions if they are not installed, or re-install them if they are not working correctly, by selecting Insert Guest Additions CD image from the Devices menu. If they are installed but the machine is not yet fully started then shared folders will be available once it is.\n\nA: Assuming you have not installed the 'Virtualbox Guest Additions' (you do not mention if you have done so in your question) you simply need to install them reboot the virtual machine and then sharing folders should work.\n\n4.2.1.1. Installation\nIn the \"Devices\" menu in the virtual machine's menu bar, VirtualBox has a handy menu item named \"Insert Guest Additions CD image\", which mounts the Guest Additions ISO file inside your virtual machine. A Windows guest should then automatically start the Guest Additions installer, which installs the Guest Additions into your Windows guest. Other guest operating systems (or if automatic start of software on CD is disabled) need manual start of the installer.\n  Note\nFor the basic Direct3D acceleration to work in a Windows Guest, you have to install the Guest Additions in \"Safe Mode\". This does not apply to the experimental WDDM Direct3D video driver available for Vista and Windows 7 guests, see Chapter 14, Known limitations for details.[19]\nIf you prefer to mount the additions manually, you can perform the following steps:\nStart the virtual machine in which you have installed Windows.\nSelect \"Mount CD/DVD-ROM\" from the \"Devices\" menu in the virtual machine's menu bar and then \"CD/DVD-ROM image\". This brings up the Virtual Media Manager described in Section 5.3, “The Virtual Media Manager”.\nIn the Virtual Media Manager, press the \"Add\" button and browse your host file system for the VBoxGuestAdditions.iso file:\n   On a Windows host, you can find this file in the VirtualBox installation directory (usually under C:\\Program files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox ).\n\n   On Mac OS X hosts, you can find this file in the application bundle of VirtualBox. (Right click on the VirtualBox icon in Finder and choose Show Package Contents. There it is located in the Contents/MacOS folder.)\n\n   On a Linux host, you can find this file in the additions folder under where you installed VirtualBox (normally /opt/VirtualBox/).\n\n   On Solaris hosts, you can find this file in the additions folder under where you installed VirtualBox (normally /opt/VirtualBox).\n\nBack in the Virtual Media Manager, select that ISO file and press the \"Select\" button. This will mount the ISO file and present it to your Windows guest as a CD-ROM.\nUnless you have the Autostart feature disabled in your Windows guest, Windows will now autostart the VirtualBox Guest Additions installation program from the Additions ISO. If the Autostart feature has been turned off, choose VBoxWindowsAdditions.exe from the CD/DVD drive inside the guest to start the installer.\nThe installer will add several device drivers to the Windows driver database and then invoke the hardware detection wizard.\nDepending on your configuration, it might display warnings that the drivers are not digitally signed. You must confirm these in order to continue the installation and properly install the Additions.\nAfter installation, reboot your guest operating system to activate the Additions.\n\nSource: http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#additions-windows\n", "Q: Run daemons before logging-in I have some daemons to run once boot is finished, the main one is a Wifi AP.\nMy question is: how to ensure the daemon run even if I'm not logged-in ? \nEDIT init.d: in spite of gøøg1ing about, I dont understand if it is called once logged or before ?\n\nA: You can put command in rc.local witch will run service. rc.local boot process run at the end.\n  sudo nano /etc/rc.local\n\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\n\nexit 0\n\nservice XXXX start\n\nSave end exit.

It asks for the master password upon its first invocation. It appears to cache the master password as to avoid rewriting it. For security reasons, I would like to set a timeout.  \nI have looked through the pass script in /usr/bin/pass. I have not become wiser from that. My suspicion is that gpg-agent has something to do with it. I tried the answers/comments from here. They did not help.\nQuestion: How do I clear the master password cache?\nIf it has a built-in timeout, that would be nice. Otherwise it will just be a simple cronjob.\n\nA: If you are using gpg-agent all passwords (including the master password) are stored/saved in ~/.password-store. \nFrom the \"pass\" website: \n\nThere will be a nice password input dialog using the standard gpg-agent (which can be configured to stay authenticated for several minutes), since all passwords are encrypted.\n\ngpg-agent manual page:\n--default-cache-ttl n  Set the time a cache entry is valid to n seconds.       \nThe default is 600 seconds. \n\n--default-cache-ttl-ssh n Set the time a cache entry used for SSH keys \nis valid to n seconds. \nThe default is 1800 seconds. \n\n--max-cache-ttl n  Set the maximum time a cache entry is valid to n seconds. \n\nAfter this time a cache entry will be expired even if it has been accessed recently. \nThe default is 2 hours (7200 seconds). \n\n--max-cache-ttl-ssh n Set the maximum time a cache entry used for SSH keys is valid \nto n seconds. After this time a cache entry will be expired even if \nit has been accessed recently. \nThe default is 2 hours (7200 seconds). \n\nand ...\n\ngpg-agent.conf\nThis is the standard configuration file read by gpg-agent on\n      startup. It may contain any valid long option; the leading\n      two dashes may not be entered and the option may not be abbreviated.\n      This file is also read after a SIGHUP however only a few\n      options will actually have an effect. This default name may be\n      changed on the command line (see: [option --options]).\n      You should backup this file.\n\nThis will only be read if you actually use gpg-agent. If it is \"seahorse\" (the default in Ubuntu) gpg-agent is ignored).\nSo you can put any of the 4 parameters in the configuration file with a time in seconds to keep password valid (that includes the master password since that is also stored in ). To release the passwords you can use echo RELOADAGENT | gpg-connect-agent (see the manual for more options).\n", "Q: It's possible to develop ubuntu touch app in C++ without using QML?

I have x64 bit VirtualBox. I installed it on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nI now need the extension package for my VirtualBox, but I am not sure which one and how to install it? \nI only know that I should download it from virtualbox.org. Also, I need it because I followed this tutorial and at one part you can read the following message:\n\nYou should download the main program and the Extension Pack, which will give you support for USB devices.\n\nHow can I install the VirtualBox Extension Pack?\n\nA: If you installed virtualbox from Ubuntu repositories, just install the package named virtualbox-ext-pack.\nsudo apt install virtualbox-ext-pack\n\nThis way you can be sure that the right version will be installed, and they will also upgrade together if needed. So the name of the game is to use same version for the packages, possibly use the same repository as well, preferably your distribution's repos. After installation you possibly need to\nsudo modprobe vboxdrv\n\notherwise you may still get configuration errors in VirtualBox settings. Besides virtualbox-ext-pack I have virtualbox, virtualbox-dkms, and virtualbox-qt packages installed, a bunch of gvfs packages, and of course dkms.\n(You'd want to go to a PPA and fiddle around yourself only if your distribution's offered packages are missing some features and the PPA would offer a later version with those fatures. But then I'd advise to use the PPA for all virtualbox packages and don't mix and match.)\n\nA: To install an extension pack once VirtualBox is installed; click on\n\nFile > Preferences > Extensions > Adds New Package (icon on right\n  side)\n\nIt is important that the extension pack match the version of VirtualBox installed.  If VirtualBox gets updated via a ppa or however, you need to remove the old extension pack, download the new one, and install it.\n\n\nA: You are referring to an article about installing VB on a Windows machine, but you are installing it on Ubuntu.  \nA Google search for \"Install VirtualBox on Ubuntu\" will get you a lot of options including videos.

I have a similar situation with my Microsoft Arc Mouse. \nIn this line: [ 1359.069997] Bluetooth: HCI request failed to create LE connection: status 0x0c the LE connection refers to this new low-energy mode that is only in bluez5. \nA Little Background on Bluez\nBluez is the bluetooth driver and, from what I've found online, each major update for it seems to break a lot of things. When bluez4 was introduced, it wasn't backwards compatible with bluez3 and so it took a long time for Linux to upgrade to bluez4 as every program had to be ported to bluez4. To go along with that, according to this article, apparently Bluez has horrible documentation and so took forever to figure out how to update programs to use it.\nWhen bluez5 came out, it appears that also broke backwards compatibility. See this page. I've read that Canonical was trying to update to bluez5 for 15.04 but couldn't get it ready in time. \nWhat You Can Do\nWell, there's hope! You can download the Bluez5 .deb file here, if you need the AMD version, or here, if you need the i386 version, and then install it with dpkg -i name_of_package.deb. You'll then need to restart your computer. \nThis usually breaks the default bluetooth manager on Ubuntu but install Bluetooth Manager, either through Terminal or the Software Store, and you'll be able to connect all your devices.\n", "Q: Possible to add a command to be run when a currently running command completes? When running time consuming processes in terminal, I like to add something like say \"done\" as an additional command so that I can get alerted when the current process ends. For example:\n$ do_this_long_thing; say \"done\";\n\nWorks great. But sometimes I forget the say \"done\" command, only to realize it once the long command is already running. Is there a way to add that additional command to the queue once a command is already running?\n\nA: \nMy solutions is this: suspend your long-running task with Control+Z,\n  then type something like:\nfg; echo \"Done!\"\n\nIf you want to run react differently based on the success or failure\n  of your command, use && and || as short-circuit operators.\nfg && echo \"Success!\" || echo \"Failure!\"\n\n\nSource: How to execute command after current running command in bash?\n\nA: In the terminal running the long running command, just type say done and hit enter. When the long running command finishes, shell will take what you typed as the next command to run. This assumes the long running command is not going to need to read anything from stdin,\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Wireless not working: no network interface.

I am using Ubuntu 14.04.3 on a server that runs a bunch of homemade web applications. I want each application to launch soon after the system launches—specifically, as soon as Postgresql is running—and then run until the system is shut down.\nRight now I’m doing this with GNU Screen: I run each application in its own terminal “window”. This is straightforward, and it makes it easy to see any error output that gets generated, but it feels amateurish and I have to do it by hand each time the system is restarted.\nI looked into writing Upstart configuration scripts for each application but I’d have to choose one of these unappealing options:\n\n\n*\n\n*System jobs are run by root and require that configuration files be installed in a system path.\n\n*User jobs seem like what I want but they’re deprecated in recent versions of Upstart and apparently not even supported in Ubuntu.\n\n*Session jobs are extremely finicky to set up if you’re running a server.\n\n\nApart from all of this, Upstart has already started to be replaced by systemd in recent versions of Ubuntu.\nWhat is the recommended way to start a task such as I am describing? Should I bite the bullet and use an Upstart system job, or is there an easier way?\n\nA: As long as I'm following Ask Ubuntu, I never saw any one using user & session upstart jobs. This is the first time I heard about their existence.\n\n\n*\n\n*User jobs were deprecated with upstart v1.7, Ubuntu 14.04 comes with v1.12\n\n*Session jobs were made for other purpose mainly user session. It seems not right to start a user init session in a server just to run those daemons.\n\n\nBetter to stick with system jobs, use su or sudo to run them as a different user and may be cleaner if you use setuid and setgid, or exec start-stop-daemon --start -c <myuser> --exec <command> see Run a Job as a Different User\nBTW, You may use start on started postgresql & stop on stopping postgresql as you services are depending on postgresql. So they are started after it get started then stopped before it get stopped. See similar case here \nHow can I make sure one Upstart job stops before another Upstart job stops?\nTo monitor for error, you could use its logging feature.\n", "Q: Looking for video editor that can export specific segments of video I am looking to export the opening themes of some anime I like to watch. Can you tell me a software that is easy to use and can do this? I currently have the episodes downloaded on my computer. I am not very good with Ubuntu so hopefully the program won't involve a lot of commands. \n\nA: I use VLC. It's easy and cross platform.\n\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\nSee this cutting video with VLC tutorial fur a detailed explanation.\n\nA: I am a big fan of avconv under the package libav-tools. Begin with installation using this command:\nsudo apt-get install libav-tools vlc\n\nI am suggesting 'vlc' because it installs lots of libraries for handling many different file types. But you can use your favorite media player to play/test your videos. Once installed enter this command to verify a successful install:\navconv -version\n\nWhat's the format of the videos you're trying to edit? Please post the output of: (NOTE: type the ACTUAL name of the video including whatever file extension it has. ie. anime.mov, or clip.mkv, etc..)\navconv -i your_movie.mp4\n\nNow that you have the tools you need, let's hack up your video the way you want. For example, if you'd like to take a 10 second clip starting at 9 minutes and 57 seconds, you would use this command:\navconv -ss 00:09:57 -t 00:00:10 -i movie.mp4 -codec copy movie_clip.mp4\n\nThe basic format is:\navconv -i [input file] -ss [start time] -t [duration] -codec copy [output file]\n\nNotice that we copied the 'codec' so that the ouput clip has the same audio/video codecs as the original. If you wanted to take a clip, AND output a different format, you could do this:\navconv -ss 00:09:57 -t 00:00:10 -i movie.mp4 -c:a libvorbis -c:v libtheora movie_clip.ogv\n\nThe file extension '.ogv' is the proper container for the codecs we are converting to. This gets a bit tricky but with a little research and trial & error, you can get pretty savvy with these command line tools for editing audio/video. I would check out the avconv manpage for a great place to begin learning these skills. There is also mencoder, which is just as powerful and versatile - you can find more information at the mencoder manpage.\nGood luck, and enjoy!\n", "Q: Different Problem installing ubuntu 14.04 Hello everyone i have a lot of trouble installing ubuntu to my windows 8 pc which is lenovo-G50 series.\n        The problem is that at i tried install ubuntu alongside windows 8.But when i inserting my bootable USB the option is not available.It is displaying that \"Ubuntu didn't recognize any operating system\" and is asking for a full format,but i have windows 8 installed.Then after surfing the net for a long time them i understood that my windows 8 os is installed in a different way and also the partition is different.So the option to \"install windows alongside them\" is not available. \nSo then again tried to install ubuntu in a different way by partitioning my F drive to 50 gb and created a new free space.Again i inserted my both usb and also Ubuntu cd.But i found the option to \"install windows alongside them\" is not available is missing so i clicked the option \"something else\" to install ubuntu in the free space i created.But i could not find that free space too in that list.I can only see \"/dev/sda\".\nNow i don't know what to do.Ubuntu is not detecting my os.**I tried to install ubuntu with and without partition, it is neither showing the option **\"install windows alongside them\" nor \"My created free partition\".I am not able to find answer for this problem.Please help me.\nIn my bios setting i can see that the usb boot is in legacy modes.\n\nA: When you shrink your main volume (or partition it), try leaving the free space UN-formatted. in windows it should say something like \"unallocated space\".

I want to install it in one of my hard drives,preferably D drive. What should I do? How can I perform this?\n\nA: When you install the installer may offer to install alongside automatically, otherwise you can chose the 'Something Else' option and install manually. You will probably need to shrink the partition in Windows, and then install alongside. Make sure you make a backup of important data first.\nIt may help to read the following questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\n\n*\"Install alongside\" option missing. How do I install Ubuntu beside Windows using \"Something Else\"?\n\nA: Yes, you can install Ubuntu on your \"D\" drive.  I ran that way since February.\nFirst download 14.04 and install it on a USB drive instead of a DVD.  \nWhat I did was remove the Windows HDD and then install Ubuntu with only the Ubuntu drive in the computer.  \nThen I added the Windows drive back.  I had to set the BIOS to do the dual booting for me.  Leave the BIOS in EUFI secure mode when you install Ubuntu.  \nThe trick is when you leave Windows to boot to Ubuntu.  You'll need to do a complete shut-down.  The shut-down in Windows normally is just a hybrid of hibernate and sleep.  You'll need to hold the shift key down while clicking the shut-down option in the menu. \nSince I mostly used Ubuntu, I set the BIOS to boot to the Ubuntu drive as the primary.\nWhen I was ready to boot Windows, when the computer gave me the option of going to the BIOS or boot menu, I pressed F-10 and it gave me a choice of windows or ubuntu.  I chose windows and operated.  When leaving Windows, I had to do a full shutdown or start a reboot in order to get the boot option menu again. \n\nA: Linux does not recognize drives as 'drive C:' or 'drive D:'. Rather, the primary hard-drive (probably drive c) is known as /dev/sda, and the secondary drive (probably drive d) is /dev/sdb. So, your windows installation, according to Linux, would probably be on /dev/sda1. \n\nAssuming that drive D is completely empty, you can choose 'Something Else' during the installation, and select '/dev/sdb\n' (assuming thats you D drive).

I don't want dsnmasq running all the time. I want to uninstall it. How to do it? I also found this link(http://overtag.dk/wordpress/2014/06/ubuntu-14-04-trusty-with-dns-server-and-networkmanager-disabling-dnsmasq/). Can i follow the instructions mentioned in here?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: If you don't your computer to host a DNS cache/server for something - e.g. for a WiFi hotspot using ap-hotspot, you can simply remove it with:\nsudo apt-get remove dnsmasq\n\nAs far as I know, it is not needed by default in most Ubuntu installs.\n\nA: Let's examine what  man dnsmasq says about its purpose:\n\nDnsmasq  accepts  DNS  queries  and  either  answers them from a\n  small,\n         local, cache or forwards them to a  real,  recursive,  DNS  server.  It\n         loads  the  contents of /etc/hosts so that local hostnames which do not\n         appear in the global DNS can be resolved and also answers  DNS  queries\n         for  DHCP  configured  hosts.  It can also act as the authoritative DNS\n         server for one or more domains, allowing local names to appear  in  the\n         global DNS. It can be configured to do DNSSEC validation.\n\nSo if you do not need:\n\n\n*\n\n*to read particular ip addresses saved in /etc/hosts \n\n*use local DNS cache\n\n*use your machine as DHCP server\n\n\nremoving dnsmasq won't affect you.\nPersonally, I have dnsmasq commented out in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and use my own DNS server in /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf.\n\nA: It is recommended directly by Steam as a workaround for their slow download speeds in Ubuntu. Steam caps out at 28mbps download speed and I have 200mbs connection. Terminal gets 150mbs using fast command, speedtest.com shows getting speeds of up to 225mbps.\nSo that's quite a big drop. At first I thought it was just my lan configuration was wrong or ethernet drivers were wrong, but apparently it is just a Steam issue.\nThe steam article is 6 years old, so seems like this has been an ongoing issue for past six years??\nExcerpt:\nDue to a bug in the Steam for Linux client it can slow down not only its own download speeds, but all DNS using network activity at the same time. This happens because the client looks up the network address for all the download servers it connects to every time it makes a connection. This can mean it will request the same information ten times a second from the DNS servers your network connection is using. Depending on how that DNS server is configured, it can throttle down the amount of DNS requests you can make. This causes Steam download speeds to start fast, but then quickly slow down into nothing, before starting up again fast for a short while.\nFull site workaround:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/2/616189106498372437/\nSo there is a use for it in 20.04.

Something like :\nif [ $default = \"Ubuntu\" ]; then\n  set default=\"Windows\"\nelse\n  set default=\"Ubuntu\"\nfi\n\nwhen grub is configured to remember the last OS booted (How to get grub2 to remember last choice?)\nIf your PC doesn't boot into the OS you want, just reboot.\n\nA: We can reboot to a given Grub menu boot entry using grub-reboot.

This can be defined with\nsudo grub-set-default <num>\n\nTo make this work we may have to define GRUB_DEFAULT=saved in our /etc/default/grub but on my system it also worked with the default settings.\nSadly rebooting Windows from Windows can not be done by this.\n", "Q: where to place UNetbootin I am in the process of downloading Ubuntu.

Please help me.\nA picture from https://www.youtube.com/html5\n\n\nA: HTML5 is usually better than Flash (particularly security wise), just Youtube's implementation uses Media Source Extensions, which is available in Firefox but disabled by default currently (EDIT: in recent Firefox this should no longer be a issue (since version 44) - IF you have the appropiate codecs installed on your system):\n\n\n*\n\n*Why you can’t play 1080p or 480p YouTube HTML5 videos in Firefox anymore - Nov 5 2013\n\n*no option for 1080p youtube - Jan 25 2015\n\n*How to get 1080p in Youtube’s HTML5 player in Firefox (on Linux) - Jun 29 2015\n\n\nTo fix it, basically go to about:config and:\n\n\n*\n\n*ignore the warranty dragons\n\n*set the media.mediasource.enabled & media.mediasource.webm.enabled entries to true\n\nThe YouTube HTML5 player enabling page should look at minimum like this:\n\nThe more blue things the merrier\nThen sit back and enjoy 1080p playback (if it doesn't need to buffer for half a hour due to broadband bandwidth like mine does :)\n\nIf you need to enable MSE & H264, you should be able to do so using the method suggested here in about:config:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new boolean key called media.mediasource.ignore_codecs and set it to 'True' - it may now work so check https://www.youtube.com/html5\n\n*If it does not work yet, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set media.mediasource.mp4.enabled to 'True'\n\n*Set to 'True' all the things begining with media.fragmented-mp4 - except for media.fragmented-mp4.use-blank-decoder which needs to be set to 'False':\n\nAll should then work (does for me with Firefox Beta AND ffmpeg available... for ffmpeg on 14.* releases try this question):\n\n\nEDIT: In Firefox 43 at least, doing the above may break the HTML5 player. There seems to be other issues (atleast with Firefox's useragent), but anyway if it breaks try setting media.fragmented-mp4.gmp.enabled to false (source)\nEDIT: again in Firefox 44 (with the default FF useragent) some issues may occur, though for me it shows a error about HTML5 videos when actually becuase videos have been blocked for other reasons (e.g. copyright). I am now forcing HTML5 with this addon\nAnother edit: now doesn't seem necessary on fresh profiles, possibly due to https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/44.0/releasenotes/#new\n\nA: the problem is with the YouTube HTML5 player, I had the same problem and fixed at by installing flash plug-in. then go to this link and choose to disable the html5 player if it's still the default. \nAfterwards, it should look like this:\n\n\nA: It can also be caused by the lack of H.264 codec support on Firefox.\nInstalling the FFmpeg plugin for GStreamer solved this problem for me: \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/gstffmpeg-keep\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS can't resolve DNS When I do ping google.com I get ping: unknown host google.com\nBut when do ping 173.194.67.138 I get this:\nPING 173.194.67.138 (173.194.67.138) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from 173.194.67.138: icmp_seq=1 ttl=48 time=5.33 ms\n64 bytes from 173.194.67.138: icmp_seq=2 ttl=48 time=5.40 ms\n\nSo there must be an error when it is trying to resolve the DNS, is there anything I can do?\nThis is from my syslog:\n    Aug 14 19:55:15 localhost ntpd[1184]: ntpd 4.2.6p5@1.2349-o Mon Apr 13 13:39:46 UTC 2015 (1)\nAug 14 19:55:15 localhost ntpd[1185]: proto: precision = 0.102 usec\nAug 14 19:55:15 localhost ntpd[1185]: ntp_io: estimated max descriptors: 1024, initial socket boundary: 16\nAug 14 19:55:15 localhost ntpd[1185]: Listen and drop on 0 v4wildcard 0.0.0.0 UDP 123\nAug 14 19:55:15 localhost ntpd[1185]: Listen and drop on 1 v6wildcard :: UDP 123\nAug 14 19:55:15 localhost ntpd[1185]: Listen normally on 2 lo 127.0.0.1 UDP 123\nAug 14 19:55:15 localhost ntpd[1185]: Listen normally on 3 eth0 108.61.209.172 UDP 123\nAug 14 19:55:15 localhost ntpd[1185]: Listen normally on 4 lo ::1 UDP 123\nAug 14 19:55:15 localhost ntpd[1185]: Listen normally on 5 eth0 fe80::5400:ff:fe10:937 UDP 123\nAug 14 19:55:15 localhost ntpd[1185]: peers refreshed\nAug 14 19:55:15 localhost ntpd[1185]: Listening on routing socket on fd #22 for interface updates\nAug 14 19:55:19 localhost ntpd[1185]: ntpd exiting on signal 15\nAug 14 19:55:29 localhost ntpdate[1216]: Can't find host 1.time.constant.com: Name or service not known (-2)\nAug 14 19:55:39 localhost ntpdate[1216]: Can't find host 2.time.constant.com: Name or service not known (-2)\nAug 14 19:55:49 localhost ntpdate[1216]: Can't find host 3.time.constant.com: Name or service not known (-2)\nAug 14 19:55:49 localhost ntpdate[1216]: no servers can be used, exiting\nAug 14 19:55:49 localhost ntpd[1250]: ntpd 4.2.6p5@1.2349-o Mon Apr 13 13:39:46 UTC 2015 (1)\nAug 14 19:55:49 localhost ntpd[1251]: proto: precision = 0.122 usec\nAug 14 19:55:49 localhost ntpd[1251]: ntp_io: estimated max descriptors: 1024, initial socket boundary: 16\nAug 14 19:55:49 localhost ntpd[1251]: Listen and drop on 0 v4wildcard 0.0.0.0 UDP 123\nAug 14 19:55:49 localhost ntpd[1251]: Listen and drop on 1 v6wildcard :: UDP 123\nAug 14 19:55:49 localhost ntpd[1251]: Listen normally on 2 lo 127.0.0.1 UDP 123\nAug 14 19:55:49 localhost ntpd[1251]: Listen normally on 3 eth0 108.61.209.172 UDP 123\nAug 14 19:55:49 localhost ntpd[1251]: Listen normally on 4 lo ::1 UDP 123\nAug 14 19:55:49 localhost ntpd[1251]: Listen normally on 5 eth0 fe80::5400:ff:fe10:937 UDP 123\nAug 14 19:55:49 localhost ntpd[1251]: peers refreshed\nAug 14 19:55:49 localhost ntpd[1251]: Listening on routing socket on fd #22 for interface updates\nAug 14 19:55:59 localhost ntpd[1251]: Deferring DNS for 1.time.constant.com 1\nAug 14 19:56:09 localhost ntpd[1251]: Deferring DNS for 2.time.constant.com 1\nAug 14 19:56:19 localhost ntpd[1251]: Deferring DNS for 3.time.constant.com 1\nAug 14 19:56:19 localhost ntpd[1255]: signal_no_reset: signal 17 had flags 4000000\nAug 14 19:56:31 localhost ntpd_intres[1255]: host name not found: 1.time.constant.com\nAug 14 19:56:41 localhost ntpd_intres[1255]: host name not found: 2.time.constant.com\nAug 14 19:56:51 localhost ntpd_intres[1255]: host name not found: 3.time.constant.com\n\n\nA: I'll bet you can't do this:\nnslookup rtfm.mit.edu\n\nbut you can do this:\nnslookup rtfm.mit.edu 8.8.8.8\n\nIf you check the content of your /etc/resolv.conf file, it's probably empty, or pointing your DNS resolver to something your Ubuntu can't reach.  /etc/resolv.conf can be configured manually with any plain text editor (vim, nano, etc), or from /etc/network/interfaces if you have the resolvconf package installed.

I always ran scripts using ./ \nFor example ./script.sh \nI recently learned that you can also type . script.sh \nIs there any difference? \nThe second is much easier for me since my keyboard doesn't have a key for / but I need to press SHIFT -.\n\nA: When you do ./script.sh the script is run in a subshell. So any operation/change that the script is meant to do is taken place at the subshell, hence the parent shell i.e. from the shell the script was called from remains unaffected of the changes.\nOn the other hand, when you do . script.sh (. is the same as shell builtin source), the script is source meaning all the commands are executed in this instance of shell (from which it is called). Hence any changes in attributes such as variables, functions declaration affects the shell.\nNormally source is used for user configuration files e.g. ~/.bashrc after making any modification to it e.g. adding a new path to PATH, so that the change is applied from the current shell session.\nPerhaps an example will make you more clear :\n$ cat script.sh  ##Our test script, containing just a variable (spam) declaration \n#!/bin/bash\nspam=foobar\n\n$ ./script.sh  ## Execute using ./script.sh\n\n$ echo \"$spam\"  ## Prints nothing\n\n\n$ . script.sh  ## Lets source it\n\n$ echo \"$spam\"  ## Now we get it\nfoobar\n\n\nA: Both execute the script that is located in the same directory that you are in, i.e. your current working directory.\nDoing . script is referred to as sourcing the script in bash\nFrom http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/x237.html\n\nWhen a file is sourced (by typing either source filename or . filename\n  at the command line), the lines of code in the file are executed as if\n  they were printed at the command line. This is particularly useful\n  with complex prompts, to allow them to be stored in files and called\n  up by sourcing the file they are in.\nIn examples, you will find that I often include #!/bin/bash at the\n  beginning of files including functions. This is not necessary if you\n  are sourcing a file, just as it isn't necessary to chmod +x a file\n  that is going to be sourced. I do this because it makes Vim (my editor\n  of choice, no flames please - you use what you like) think I'm editing\n  a shell script and turn on colour syntax highlighting.\n\nThere's a point to notice: the script is executed as if it was typed on the command line, meaning it expects bash syntax. Thus if you currently are working in bash and you want to execute a script that is written in tcsh style, bash will complain. By contrast  if you do . bashstylescript.sh that will work.\nHere's a demo of that. cwhile.sh is in tcsh style and whileloop.sh is in bash style.\n serg@ubuntu [/home/xieerqi]\n================================\n$ . cwhile.sh\nbash: cwhile.sh: line 8: syntax error: unexpected end of file\n serg@ubuntu [/home/xieerqi]\n================================\n$ . whileloop.sh \n    28206 \n    33672 \n    18406 \n    65344 \n    12022 \n    10751 \n    29707 \n    44303 \n    15081 \n    59236 \n\nWhat about ./script ? In that case , the shell will read #! line, and run the appropriate shell to execute your script. \n serg@ubuntu [/home/xieerqi]\n================================\n$ ./cwhile.sh \nWelcome 1 times\nWelcome 2 times\nWelcome 3 times\nWelcome 4 times\nWelcome 5 times\n\nAs you can see, shell reads my #!/bin/tcsh line and lets tcsh execute the script.\nSide-note : Doing . script.sh in other shells might not work, since it seems to be bash only thing. mksh for instance does not do that, but rather uses source script.sh way\n", "Q: How to fully create a new user (with proper shell settings) in Ubuntu 14.04? TOP EDIT: I just figured out - it's the difference between adduser and useradd. Use adduser to get everything done right. You can use useradd, but it's older and will literally just create the user - not home directory or other expected tasks. That was my problem. :) Leaving this in case it helps someone else.\nOriginal:\n\nI've installed Ubuntu 14.04 on a Ramnode VPS - minimal, no GUI, just SSH.\nWhen I add a user via, e.g. adduser myusername, it doesn't create a home directory, and the terminal is weird (I'm seeing control codes like ^[[A for backspace, and doing ls doesn't show pretty colours like my main user).\nI've added a home directory by running sudo mkhomedir_helper myusername and that did create a home directory... but that didn't solve what I assume is a lack of BASH stuff, or maybe it's the wrong shell or something.\nWeirdly, this is the second user I created. The first one worked fine. I don't know what happened differently. Does anyone have any insight?\n\nA: Basically, I just learned: Use adduser, not useradd. The former adds everything you expect (home dir, etc); the latter is older and literally just creates the user.\n\nA: The first thing you should try is to tell adduser exactly what it should do:\nsudo adduser --home /home/newuser --shell /bin/bash\n\n\nA: Adduser\nadduser  and  addgroup  add users and groups to the system according to command    line    options    and    configuration    information    in        /etc/adduser.conffile.\nadduser and addgroup can be run in one of five modes:\nAdd a normal user:\nIf  called  with  one  non-option  argument and without the --system or --group options, adduser will add a normal user.\nAdd a system user:\nIf called with one non-option argument and the --system option, adduser  will add a system user. If a user with the same name already exists  in  the  system uid range, adduser will exit with a warning.\nAdd a user group:\nIf adduser is called with the --group option and without  the  --system\noption, or addgroup is called respectively, a user group will be added.\nAdd a system group:\nIf addgroup is called with the --system option, a system group will be\nadded.\nAdd an existing user to an existing group:\nIf called with two non-option arguments, adduser will add  an  existing user to an existing group.\nOptions:\n--conf FILE\n--disabled-login\n--disabled-password\n--force-badname\n--gecos GECOS\n--gid ID\n--group\n--help \n--home DIR\n--shell SHELL\n--ingroup GROUP\n--no-create-home\n--quiet\n--debug\n--system\n--uid ID\n--firstuid ID\n--lastuid ID\n--add_extra_groups\n--version\n          \n\nExit values:\n0 --- The user exists as specified.\nThis can have two causes: The  user was  created  by  adduser or the user was already present on the system before adduser was invoked. If adduser was returning 0,invoking  adduser  a  second  time  with  the same parameters as before also returns 0.\n1 --- Creating the user or group failed because it was already present  with other UID/GID than specified. The username or groupname was rejected because of  a  mismatch  with  the  configured  regular expressions. Adduser has been aborted by a signal. Or for many other yet undocumented reasons which are printed  to console  then.

When I do it on a GTK3 app it doesn't. \nThe rest of mouse bindings work fine, so GTK is recognizing the mouse key presses but ignoring the xvkbd -xsendevent instruction as proved by the above test.\nAny insights? \nAll I found was this mailing list email from 2012 without replies and not much info: https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-list/2012-May/msg00001.html \n\nA: My solution was to change tools, xdotool works fine.

I installed OSSEC, and the following file failed a rootkit check. I'm not sure if it's malicious or what it's doing. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\nThe file is a bash file: /usr/bin/svnadd\nBelow are its contents:\n#!/bin/sh\nsvn status | perl -ne 's/^\\?\\s+(\\S.+)$/\\1/g;chomp;system(\"svn add \\\"$_\\\"\");'\n\nThe version of Ubuntu we're running is a fully patched 10.04.4 LTS.\n\nA: The script is legitimate but poorly written.  Its purpose is to put files under version control, using subversion, also called svn, if they are not already control.\nSuppose, for example, that subversion reports the following about your current directory:\n$ svn status\n?       something.c\nM       other.h\n\nThis means that something.c is not currently under version control.  other.h is under version control but the local copy have been modified (hence the M).\nYour svnadd command will cause the following commands to be executed:\nsvn add something.c\nsvn add M       other.h\n\nThe first places something.c under version control.  The second command attempts to place the files M and other.h under version control.  Since other.h is already under version control, this will generate an error.  What happens with M depends on whether there is a file called M in your directory.\nIn sum, this command is not malicious.  It will not infect anything.  But, don't run it.\n", "Q: make samba share visible in Windows \"Network\" tl;dr Shared files are accessible, but server isn't visible in Windows listing.\nI've got printers and some directories shared via Samba, but they do not appear in the listing when a Windows user opens their \"Network\". They can type \"\\computername\\\" and hit enter to see the shared printers and directories, but I'd like to make it easy to see the server listed along with other icons in their Network panel.\nThis used to work (ubuntu 13-something, I think), but recently (ubuntu 15.04) it doesn't. So something must have changed with the default configuration. It's probably a simple setting in smb.conf, I just don't know where to look. Any hints?\n\nA: I have been using OpenSuse Leap 42.2 and as windows updates is breaks my samba network.  This configuration in the [Global] section of samba config has worked until billy's recent updates and stopped working on my Windows 7 and 10 machines. My global section of samba config was:\n[global] \n    workgroup = WORKGROUP\n    netbios name = LINUXSERVER\n    lanman auth = no\n    ntlm auth = yes\n    client lanman auth = no\nI then added the 3 lines found on this site so global now reads:\n[global]\n    workgroup = WORKGROUP\n    netbios name = LINUXSERVER\n    lanman auth = no\n    ntlm auth = yes\n    client lanman auth = no\n    wins support = yes\n    local master = yes\n    preferred master = yes\nNow my samba shares show up in Windows 7/10.  I know this is a Ubuntu forum but I am always willing to try to help fellow Linux users.\n\nA: The problem is that NetBios discovery is now disabled by default in Windows for security reasons, and Samba never implemented support for Web Services for Windows (WSD), which is the \"modern\" way, AFAICT, for things to be visible in Windows Network.\nhttps://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11473\nAlso see: https://github.com/christgau/wsdd for a possible solution.\n\nA: I want to add this here, in case someone else comes looking. The issue with network discovery is the old way was tied to SMB1. The new way WS-Discovery, does not yet appear to be implemented in SAMBA. Windows does not yet support Zerconf so AVAHI does not work for Windows.   \nFalling back to SMB1 while disabling SMB2/3 is not the answer.\nSomeone named stilez wrote an article describing the situation here: https://www.ixsystems.com/community/resources/how-to-kill-off-smb1-netbios-wins-and-still-have-windows-network-neighbourhood-better-than-ever.106/\nAnd the article provides a link to a python script wsdd.py(https://github.com/christgau/wsdd/blob/master/src/wsdd.py), which provides the missing functionality. Running the script caused my SAMBA AD servers to instantly appear on Win 10 boxen.\n\nA: add lines in smb.conf\nwins support = yes\nlocal master = yes\npreferred master = yes\n\n\nA: I've been hammering away at this problem for a few weeks, on and off, and it is only now that I have found the last piece of the puzzle for Windows 10 to see Samba shares in Network (places).\nIt's all described fully at this link:\nHow to detect, enable and disable SMBv1, SMBv2, and SMBv3 in Windows and Windows Server\nEssentially, you need to enable SMBv1 / CIFS sharing support in Windows 10:\n\nJust hit START in Windows and search for 'Turn Windows features on or off' and it'll take you there.\nAfter I did this, all my problems vanished. Tada!\nI don't know if it has reduced the security of my network (probably has!), but if it has it doesn't matter to me too much as it's all on LAN anyway.\nHope this helps some other people out.\n", "Q: Unable to Install OBS I'm a super new Linux user and need some help installing OBS.

The number value for this port is USB_7-1. Again, thank you in advance for all of your help. \n\nA: Perhaps there are some clues in stackoverflow.\nWhat's your output of ls -l /sys/class/tty with and without your device in the USB port?\nAnother way to determine what /dev/ttyS* your device is connected to:\nsudo apt-get install getserial\n\nsudo setserial -g /dev/ttyS*\n\nIf you only have one connected device, it should be possible to parse the output of setserial to determine what port your device is connected to.\n(external source)\nIf neither of these solutions work, I would probably try to filter the dmesg output, e.g. (assuming 'pl2303' is the giveaway string):\ndmesg | perl -ne '/pl2303.*(tty\\w+)/ && print $1,\"\\n\"'\n\nshould print your ttyUSB device string that you may try to connect to instead of /dev/ttyS*.\n\nA: nice to meet another ham on here.  The adaptor likely shows up as a different serial port for each USB port you plug into.  That's what happened to me.  You might want to try different /dev/ttyS# values and see what works.\nGood luck\n", "Q: Run Ubuntu from USB vs. Run it natively alongside Windows? I just upgraded my factory-installed Windows 8.1 PC to Windows 10 and it's running smooth; I'd like to have Ubuntu available for coding/development (a VM is too slow for my purpose), but a lot of my work still relies on Windows and I'm not ready for all the potential troubles of a dualboot (heard all about the UEFI/SecureBoot/hibernation problems). \nI'd like a comparison between running Ubuntu from a USB drive (flash drive or external hard drive) vs. on native hardware alongside Windows (esp. in terms of performance and stability)--thanks!\n\nA: Running through USB (flashdisk,External HDD, etc) is not as faster as running through HDD. So the best one should be running through HDD because the link is more faster using SATA.\nYou may refer for the speed on this link \nSpeed comparison.\nFor the trouble about UEFI you may refer to your motherboard BIOS firmware update. Most of major motherboard company have an firmware Upgrade for their BIOS to comply with Windows 10 Upgrade. Once your motherboard upgraded and support UEFI, there shouldn't be problem using Ubuntu and Windows 10 alongside.\nHope my answer can help you.\n\nA: In my experience, depending on the laptop, booting from a USB is actually very fast. Fast enough that on pretty mediocre hardware, simple tasks like browsing and doing system administrative things are smooth and without hiccups.\nIf you want to use Linux for the purposes of coding, I'd say that whether or not a USB will suit your needs depends on what you are using to code (IDE? Text editor?) and how much you are coding. If you're working on a huge program and using an enormous IDE like Eclipse, I'd say a USB is probably not the best choice. If you're working on a program confined to a few files that you're editing in Sublime or some light text editor, you should probably be fine.\nLike the other responder to this question, I recommend you just dual boot because Ubuntu is extremely hassle-free/installs cleanly. The only problem I've had on modern computers with regards to installing Ubuntu is when Windows' partition scheme is weird. I literally have no idea what you mean by \"UEFI/SecureBoot/hibernation problems\" because I have never had these kinds of issues.\nSo in summary, USB should be fine for smaller stuff/less intensive projects. Dual booting is ideal because Ubuntu is a great operating system worth investing in.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: After my computer boots it shows a black screen, how can i fix this?

So if you want the repo in cm12, you have to cd in to the working directory you have created i.e  cm12.  \nFrom the official documentation:\n\nrepo init installs Repo in the current directory. This creates a\n  .repo/ directory that contains Git repositories for the Repo source\n  code and the standard Android manifest files. The .repo/ directory\n  also contains manifest.xml, which is a symlink to the selected\n  manifest in the .repo/manifests/ directory.\n\n", "Q: Arabic numbers/dates showing in various places I've just installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nI live in the Middle East, and so I set my country location (in the ME) and set my language to English (UK).\nAlthough I'm now getting Arabic numbers and dates coming up in various places, although not everywhere, for example, when I run ls -l:\n\n4 drwxr-xr-x 2 user1 user1 4096 أغس 14 12:59 Desktop\n4 drwxr-xr-x 2 user1 user1 4096 أغس 14 12:59 Documents\n4 drwxr-xr-x 2 user1 user1 4096 أغس 14 14:39 Downloads\n\nI think the Arabic above is where the short month-name should be?

I want my windows key (or super_l) to toggle the lubuntu menu. I'm able to open it with the windows key after adding the key binding from the question below, but so far I haven't found a way to close it by pressing the same key again. A comment in said question here asked about the same thing in november 2011, but after googling I haven't found a solution. Does anyone know if it's possible?  \nBind the windows key to Lubuntu start menu\n\nA: Alternative way to toggle the menu\nThis answer is only \"half\" of the answer that was posted here . Since that question was on Gnome, and tagged likewise, I think it is legitimate to post a slightly edited version here to cover Lubuntu (lxde), or any other window manager.\nI tested it on Lubuntu 14.04, and (as expected) did exactly what it should do.\nThe solution is actually a script that you can easily set up to automatically (virtually) click on any position on your screen, including the menu. Since clicking the menu once will open it, clicking it again will close it, placing the command under your key, as you did, will do exactly what you are after.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport sys\nimport os\n\noption = sys.argv[1]\ndatafile = os.path.join(os.environ[\"HOME\"], \".run_click\")\n\ndef get_mousepos():\n    cursordata = subprocess.check_output([\"xdotool\", \"getmouselocation\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\n    return [d.split(\":\")[1] for d in cursordata[:2]]\n\nif option == \"-run\":\n    try:\n        data = open(datafile).read()\n        coords = (\" \").join([l for l in data.splitlines()])\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        message = \"Please run the command: 'run_click -set' first, to set the click position\"\n        subprocess.Popen([\"zenity\", \"--info\", \"--text\", message])\n    else:\n        cmd1 = \"xdotool mousemove \"+coords; cmd2 = \"xdotool click 1\"; cmd3 = \"xdotool mousemove \"+(\" \").join(get_mousepos())\n        for cmd in [cmd1, cmd2, cmd3]:\n            subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd])\n            time.sleep(0.05)\nelif option == \"-set\":\n    open(datafile, \"wt\").write((\"\\n\").join(get_mousepos()))\n\nAbout the script; how to set up\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Copy the script above into an empty file, save it as click_menu.py\n\n*Now you need to make the script remember the menu position to (virtually) click:\nThe script needs to be run with the option -set, with the mouse in position:\n\n\n*\n\n*open a terminal window, type the command:\nsleep 5 && python3 /path/to/click_menu.py -set\n\n\n*immediatley position the mouse above the menu (do not click)\n\n*after the 5 seconds have passed, the menu position is \"remembered\". The position is written to an invisible file, so you will only need to do this once.\n\n\n*Test if all works fine with the command:\npython3 /path/to/click_menu.py -run\n\n\nThe menu should open, as shown in th image above.\n\n*If all works fine add the command:\npython3 /path/to/click_menu.py -run\n\nto the key, as you did with the other command you mentioned in your question. Now pressing the key should toggle the menu.\n", "Q: Can't read Hard Drive I have 2 fairly new SATA hard drives that I'm moving to a new machine. One was the boot drive, the other had all 'My Stuff' on it. Both drives were installed under Ubuntu 12.04\nI need to copy the contents of the 'My Stuff' drive to the other drive.\nSo new parts (i5, Asus Z97e Mobo, Asus GTX 970 & RAM)\nI couldn't remember which was the boot drive, & accidentally installed Ubuntu 14.04 to the 'My Stuff' drive instead of the boot drive. Not a problem, it made a new partition & I could still access everything.\nSo I removed the 'My Stuff' drive from the machine, leaving just the original boot drive, which I wiped & installed Win10 on.\nI then added the 'My Stuff' drive back in, but could not boot from it. Windows could not read it, disk manager showed the partitions but I didn't do anything.\nI then ran Ubuntu 14.04 from a flash drive, hoping to access the 'My Stuff' drive & copy the contents over to the (Windows) boot drive.\nBUT I can't access any of the 'My Stuff' drive; I apparently don't have the necessary permissions. Apparently the owner is the other drive.\nI know about backing up data I want to keep, it was backed up, a full copy was on the other drive (which is now wiped), & most of it was also backed up to a 12 year old PATA drive (which I have got working via USB caddy) but it is completely full with no room for some of the data I wanted to keep.\nI also tried putting the 'My Stuff' drive into the USB caddy (which can do PATA & SATA) & tried under Win10 (from HDD) & also tried from Ubuntu (from flash drive) but I just cant access the drive. No permission under Ubuntu & Win10 just cant see it.\nI eventually want to run dual boot Win10 & Ubuntu 14.04, but I need to copy some of the contents of the 'My Stuff' drive to the other drive first.\n\nA: Try to copy your files as root of your Live-Ubuntu-drive\nOpen a terminal and type \nsudo -i \nnautilus\n\nto open the file manager as root.

Lots of people in the community have had problems with the Wubi already. I also have those problems. But after checking the logfiles of the problem, I had an idea, and I hope that someone can help me with it. \nFor example, the logfile shows that the Wubi tries to download file from here, but the thing is that it has updated to 14.04.3.\nSo my question is, is there anyway to change the link that it requests, or to talk to the developers about this?\n\nA: The devs must know the issue because of an existing bug report for 14.04.1. 14.04.1 was the first point release where the devs forgot(?) to update the links. \nIMHO there are the following solutions to fix this:\n\n\n*\n\n*You avoid Wubi (recommended).\n\n*You wait until devs will fix this (Maybe, this will never happen) \n\n*You change the file mentioned in bug report by your own. (Maybe, this solution is too difficult for you).\n\n*You use a workaround for 14.04.1 published by bcbc, which works for 14.04.3, too. Thanks to bcbc. \n\n*You trust unofficial, unsigned but fully fixed versions by hakuna_matata which you can find here.

They are generally used by people who want the latest and greatest. If you are going extra lengths to get this kind of software, then you are expected to know what you are doing. The selection in the Software Centre is ample for most human beings. To know more about PPAs, see What are PPAs and how do I use them?\nIf you want to install xiphos from a PPA, open your terminal and type the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:unit193/crosswire\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install xiphos\n\nNote: You do not have to add PPA in order to install xiphos.

However when I do so every user can delete each others folder although he has no rights to that folder.\nWhat I want is:\n1) Every user can write on \"/media/data\"\n2) No user can delete a folder created by another user on \"/media/data\"\nThe data partition is mounted via this entry in the /etc/fstab\n/dev/sdb1   /media/data    ext4    defaults    0   0\n\nWhen the partition was empty I also did this:  \n$ sudo chown -R :users /media/data \n$ sudo chmod -R g+rw /media/data \n\nAs I recall, without these two last commands non of the users could write anything to the data partition.\nNow I think the problem is that giving writing permission to the group \"users\" (g+rw), is part of the problem. Since that already means that everyone in \"users\" can delete anything under \"/media/data\". Still I want my multiuser Ubuntu System to be configured in the way as mentioned above (Everyone can write to the data partition, but nobody can delete stuff created by other users).\nHas anyone an idea how to do this?\n\nA: The answer to this is to set the sticky bit (t) of your directories.\nYou set the sticky bit recursively on your data directory by:\nsudo chmod -R +t /media/data\n\nThis restricts the right to delete or rename a file only to the owner of a file, although the directory might be publicly readable and writeable.\nThe permissions string will after that look like e.g. rwxrwxrwt if the owner user, group and every other user all have full permissions (read, write, execute), whereas only each specific file's owner may delete or rename it.\n", "Q: Can't connect to froxlor clients via SFTP I can login to root and other ssh users using SFTP (ProFTPD) without a problem but I can't connect via sftp to any of the froxlor clients that I add via the panel though.\nWith some help from here, I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the following to /etc/proftpd/modules.conf\nLoadModule mod_sftp.c\n\n*Add the following to /etc/proftpd/sql.conf\nInclude /etc/proftpd/sftp.conf\n\n*Create file /etc/proftpd/sftp.conf with following content:\n<IfModule mod_sftp.c>\n    SFTPEngine on\n    SFTPLog /var/log/proftpd/sftp.log\n    SFTPHostKey /etc/ssh/sshhostdsakey\n    SFTPHostKey /etc/ssh/sshhostrsakey\n</IfModule>\n\n*Restarted proftpd and ssh\nIf I try connecting via filezilla to a froxlor client with host sftp://server-ip username say, user1 and the user password, I get the following error:\nError:  Authentication failed.\nError:  Critical error: Could not connect to server\n\n\nPlease let me know if there's any info, logs, config, etc you would want me to provide.\n\n\nA: I had the same error.\nSolution:\nDo NOT put the Include /etc/proftpd/sftp.conf in the IfModule mod_sql.c section.\nPlace the include command in a new line after the IfModule mod_sql.c tag.\n", "Q: Why do I get an error trying to install php5-intl?

For some reason I cannot write to the following folder /usr/lib/libreoffice/share though I am the root user of my system, in order to add a file and customize LibreOffice. \n\nA: To make changes in the directory /usr/lib/libreoffice/share you should have sudo privileges. Ubuntu doesn't use a root account by default, so you have to use append sudo before you run any command that requires root privileges. \nFor example, if you are trying to edit a file config/soffice.cfg/modules/sglobal/menubar/menubar.xml using nano you should run:\nsudo nano /usr/lib/libreoffice/share/config/soffice.cfg/modules/sglobal/menubar/menubar.xml\n\nYou could also directly edit this file (without the need to use sudo) if you log-in as a root user by sudo su, but this is highly not  a recommended way. \n", "Q: Text editor installed via deb, but not shown in \"open with\" menu I made deb installer.

However, Nano does offer features that allow you to configure some stuff so you can do this:\n\n*\n\n*You can execute external programs, and print the output into Nano.\n\n*You can make custom keyboard shortcuts, including ones that can execute external commands, using macro-like actions along with it. You do not actually need to use Nano's standard macro feature, however.\n\nSo, you can use a third-party command-line timestamp program, and make a keyboard shortcut that uses it.\nHere is how to do this:\nOpen your Nanorc file with Nano (not another text editor, because you'll need to make use of Nano's verbatim input feature); you can do nano ~/.nanorc to open the Nanorc file.\nType the following on its own line (which makes use of the idea that Pilot06 mentioned in the comments):\nbind F5 \"date +%I:%M\\ %d.%m.%Y.\" main\n\nOr if you want 24-hour time do this instead:\nbind F5 \"date +%H:%M\\ %d.%m.%Y.\" main\n\nNow, go between the \"d and press Alt+v; then press Ctrl+t.\nNow, go between the .\" and press Alt+v and then press enter.\nThen press Alt+v and press backspace, once.\nYour line should look something like this (but it might look a little different, and don't copy/paste this, because it probably won't count the special characters as verbatim input):\nbind F5 \"^Tdate +%I:%M\\ %d.%m.%Y.^M^?\" main\n\nSave and close Nano. You're done. It won't work in instances of Nano that are already open (you'll have to close those and restart them).\nNow, whenever you press F5, it'll insert a timestamp according as you wanted.\nTo see directives for the command-line program called date, type man date, date --help, or info date (press q to get out of the manpage or the info page). Directives are the things like %H.\nHere's an example of a fancy timestamp:\ndate +%-d\\ %B\\ %-Y\\ \\(%A\\)—%-I:%M:%S\\ %p\n", "Q: Phonegap Ubuntu build failed When I run \nphonegap build ubuntu\n\nI get this error\n    Adding ubuntu project...\n\nCreating a Cordova Project:\n Project Path: /home/david/projects/cordova/hello/platforms/ubuntu\n Package Name: com.example.hello\n Project Name: HelloWorld\n\n\nmissing icon element in config.xml\n\nDiscovered plugin \"cordova-plugin-whitelist\" in config.xml.

The package says it needs libasound2 (>= 1.0.16), which I think means it needs versions  newer than 1.0.16 which is also available in the trusty repo.\nAnother way of doing it would be to run apt-get install --print-uris sl-modem-daemon[1] on the server, and downloading the needed files with the machine that has internet access, and then install the appropiate deb files. This will likely be better as it sl-modem-daemon dependencies' dependencies. \nFor example, it might give on a Ubuntu 14.04 machine:\n'http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/restricted/s/sl-modem/sl-modem-daemon_2.9.11~20110321-9_i386.deb' sl-modem-daemon_2.9.11~20110321-9_i386.deb 513368 MD5Sum:e46c8d65bf15e284a187ef2fb46521e0\n\nURL filename MD5sum\nOnce you have managed to get the needed deb files, you can install it with dpkg -i /PATH/TO/FILE(S).deb - you can also use gedbi FILE or the Software Center if they are installed. \n[1]: this will likely only work if the machine has previously had access to the internet to update the package lists - the print-uris just tells it to print what was going to download instead of downloading it \n", "Q: Can swap be used instead of RAM? I have an older netbook that I love. It's currently using a relatively recent version of Lubuntu. The hangup is its relatively low amount of onboard RAM: 1GB. This amount also cannot be updated as it is soldered to the motherboard.\nIf I were to upgrade its internal hard drive to a speedy SSD, would I be able to tune Ubuntu to prioritize it as a source of system memory? If so, how would I approach this during a fresh install?\nI understand that swap will never be as fast as onboard RAM, but does this sound like a fair workaround?\nFeel free to add any information of software and other platforms with regard to this problem as well.\n\nA: Best you can do is to shange swappiness parameter\nThe swappiness parameter configures how often your system swaps data out of RAM to the swap space. This is a value between 0 and 100 that represents a percentage.\nWith values close to zero, the kernel will not swap data to the disk unless absolutely necessary. Remember, interactions with the swap file are \"expensive\" in that they take a lot longer than interactions with RAM and they can cause a significant reduction in performance. Telling the system not to rely on the swap much will generally make your system faster.\nValues that are closer to 100 will try to put more data into swap in an effort to keep more RAM space free. \nWe can see the current swappiness value by typing:\ncat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\n60\n\nFor a Desktop, a swappiness setting of 60 is not a bad value. \nWe can set the swappiness to a different value by using the sysctl command.\nFor instance, to set the swappiness to 90, we could type:\nsudo sysctl vm.swappiness=90\nvm.swappiness = 90\n\nThis setting will persist until the next reboot. We can set this value automatically at restart by adding the line to our /etc/sysctl.conf file:\nsudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nAt the bottom, you can add:\nvm.swappiness=90\n\nSave and close the file when you are finished.\n", "Q: How to uninstall ubuntu dual boot with windows 10 as both are in same drive I have inatalled ubuntu 14.04LTS dual boot with windows 10.

I created this script to do this (baring in mind this is my first time ever writing a script):\n#!/bin/bash\n#Get the current directory and append the SO's location\ncurrentDir=$(pwd)'/libs/'\n\n#Change the library path\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$currentDir\n\n#Run the program\n./program\n\nAfter running this from the terminal I thought that it has worked, there were no errors and the program didn't complain about shared libraries. But unfortunately, if I try to double-click the .sh file from Nautilus, nothing happens. The worst part as well, is that since I'm running it from the GUI, I have no idea what error it is getting. I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 and the executable is a C++ program using the SFML libraries (Yes I could just have the dependencies, but SFML isn't commonly installed on Linux computers, and this is besides the point).\n\nA: The property Allow executing file as program is not enough.\nChange the settings in Nautilus Preferences\n\n\nor via terminal:\ngsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences executable-text-activation ask\n\n", "Q: Can I safely cancel in the middle of a system install?

If I just hold the power button down, will that screw with any of my data?\n\nA: No, it will not, if you have data in another drive or u haven't format your system drive.\nBut use another ISO to reinstall system.\n\nA: \nIf I just hold the power button down, will that screw with any of my data?\n\nNo, unless the data was screwed to begin with (for instance due to you telling the system to format the data) all a reboot/shutdown will do is stop the installation. You then can restart the installation. Again though: formatting/repartitioning will be a permanent change to the system during the installation. \nWARNING: The above is only true for this particular case. Holding down the power button on an already installed system is dangerous and will render Ubuntu inoperable.\n", "Q: Can you *simulate* an upgrade from one Ubuntu version to the next? How do I upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu? does a great job of explaining how to do a version upgrade.  It also says \"Upgrading Ubuntu works 99 times out of 100\" which has not been my experience - I've had issues about 6 out of 6 times (I don't blame Ubuntu - I think my messing with my installation without a deep understanding of what I'm doing creates atypical problems).  So I always image my entire system before I attempt an upgrade.  Then I attempt the upgrade, and if it doesn't go well and my attempts to resolve the issues fail, I restore the system back to where I started.  All of which takes a fairly long time.\nSo I'm wondering if there is a way to simulate a version upgrade so I can find out if there are going to be trouble areas and potentially address them prior to the actual upgrade.\nFor example, on my current 14.04.3 installation, apt-get check and apt-get -f install report no issues.  But after I performed an upgrade to 14.10 last night, 3 or 4 packages were broken and I couldn't resolve the conflicts.  Is there a way, before attempting an upgrade, to see what's wrong with an installation that might cause a problem when upgrading?\nI imagine this could be useful information even if one doesn't upgrade - these \"hidden\" issues might be causing stability or performance issues... \n\nA: do-release-upgrade will carry out a release upgrade but do-release-upgrade doesn't have a dry run option. But, it does have a --sandbox option.\nFrom the point of running in --sandbox mode, any changes made to your system will actually be written to a ramdisk, and reset upon reboot via the magic os Aufs. This lets you test your machine thoroughly in a fully functioning state, without risking breaking it.\nFrom the original mailing list;\n\n\"The idea...was to create a writable overlay into /tmp on top the systemdirs in \"/\" and then run the release upgrade. This way we can test easily if the system would upgrade cleanly (if no dpkg errors/maintainer script failures happen). All writes go into /tmp so after the upgrade and on the next reboot the system is back to its pre-upgraded state again (modulo /home, that is not overlayed).\"\n\nFor more information on this refer to the original mailing list or this post.\nFor dist-upgrades, you can use the --dry-run with sudo apt-get dist-upgrade to simulate running this command without actually performing the upgrade.\n   -s, --simulate, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon, --no-act\n       No action; perform a simulation of events that would occur but do not actually change the\n       system. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Simulate.\n\n       Simulate prints out a series of lines each one representing a dpkg operation, Configure (Conf),\n       Remove (Remv), Unpack (Inst). Square brackets indicate broken packages with and empty set of\n       square brackets meaning breaks that are of no consequence (rare).\n\n\n   -u, --show-upgraded\n       Show upgraded packages; Print out a list of all packages that are to be upgraded. Configuration\n       Item: APT::Get::Show-Upgraded.\n\n\nA: The do-release-upgrade script has a --sandbox option which performs the upgrade on an aufs overlay filesystem. This means that all changes are written to a separate filesystem overlaying the original files. Throw away the overlay and you are back with your original filesystem. Disclaimer: I don't have first hand experience with this feature.\nRegardless of your approach, do make sure your pre-upgrade system is consistent. So run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade and resolve any issues showing up before running do-release-upgrade. \n", "Q: Samba share only writable when chown for specific user set I have a samba server running on a Ubuntu 14.04 server\nI set up a samba share.\n[Pictures]\nwriteable = yes\npath = /mnt/data/share/Pictures\nuser = christian test\nvalid users = christian test\nwrite list = christian test\n\nThe problem is that when I set the chown to this:\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 nobody nogroup 4096 Jul 10 18:59 Pictures\n\nI can access and read files but I am not able to edit/create/delete files/folders.\nIf I alter the chown to:\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 christian users   4096 Aug 15 22:03 Pictures\n\nI can edit/create/delete.

Please try the accepted answer instead!!!\nAfter much stress I finally found several posts that recommended the (mostly) same solution.  note that this is a bit hackey but it works, it may cause problems later, or may not I don't know\nI found the most reliable answer on an old steam bug report from 2013.  Reading the thread it became clear that Steam does not do well with HWE releases and tries to pull the libs from the non HWE repository and this causes the conflict.\nThere are actually separate issues that I was dealing with but they are related\n\nFirst was the fact that the \"bug\" caused the Lib.so file to not be found if you installed Steam without proprietary drivers\nIf you were use the proprietary driver(as least with Nvidia, not sure about Radeon) they installed their own libs that Steam could find.  Without the closed drivers you would get the fatal error that \"you are missing the following 32 bit libs Steam may fail to start Lib.so*\" Then the Steam crash notification would come up. This caused the confusion above where one time Steam fails and the next time it starts with the     \nIf I understand right the following fix will take care of this issue with the non-propitiatary but I'm not absolutely certain. \n__\nThe second issue:\nStill related to Steam trying to pull old libs. (or maybe the Ubuntu repo has not updated the newer ones to work yet, that was not clear to me)\nWhen starting with the closed drivers , the window pops up that Steam \"needs to install the following...\" in the code I posted above.  (When using open drivers Steam crashes at the \"lib.so\" stage)\nIf you tried to install you got the errors I posted above, but if you just closed the window Steam would launch normally.\nNOW THE FIX\nThe bug report I referenced earlier contained some recent comments that lead me to the answer the relevant comments start here.\nThe fix is to add i386 architecture then update\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen install the i386 libs (these are the older libs from the trusty repos as you can see by the commands)\nsudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dri-lts-trusty:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-trusty:i386 libc6:i386\n\nAs I said above, this may be a hackey way to get the libs needed but every other way I tried either failed outright or left me with the super annoying window popping up wanting to install needed libs every time I started Steam.  There is a possibility that these libs may cause issues later but it appears that you can remove all of the files that these commands install by \n sudo apt-get purge  libgl1-mesa-dri-lts-trusty:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-trusty:i386 libc6:i386\n\nand then remove the last file with\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nAccording to my tests, it reverts the system back to before the commands where installed.  As most of your system on 14.04.03 is still Trusty and Trusty will be supported for a while yet; I think these libs will be ok but use this fix at your own risk\nOne thing of note, this fix did not remove a single file, program or lib from my system(you might want to test with the sudo apt-get install -s(the -s switch here means simulation) then check the output on you terminal to make sure it will not on yours).\n\nIf any more experienced users out there know of any issues that may arise form installing these libs or knows of a less quick-and-dirty way to fix this, please add info in the comments \n\nA: Original answer\nI solved the problem using Synaptic and installing steam:i386 not steam-launcher (that Synaptic does not find)\n\nEdit by the question OP to add an explanation and more info\nUsing the commands in the answer above the Steam install went fine but it has some quirks:\n1st some background:   I initially installed Steam with the Software Center's \"Reinstall previous purchases function.  This installed steam-launcher  Which as the answer above states cannot be found by Synaptic.  This is because Synaptic only finds programs that are already in the repos but Steam launcher is in it own ppa. The Software Center can see \"for purchase\" applications, which is what Steam initially was released as.  \"For purchase\" here does not necessarily mean that you have to spend money, what this function does is allow you to install apps that are only available in their own ppa.  Installing this was add the ppa as well as the program.\n\nFor some reason installing in the above manner does not pull in the libs from the vivid stack only the original trusty repos and the trusty-updates repos.  This causes the conflicts and the dependency errors that I posted in my question.  Installing per this answer corrects this issue and pulls from vivid.\nThere appear to be several ways to get the steam:i386 one is using Synaptic.  The other graphical way is the Software Center but you have to click on the bottom left of the window to \"Show [a number of] technical items\"  In my tests this also brings up the steam:i386 option.\nThat last way is using the terminal and typing sudo apt-get install steam:i386  (note that here for some reason using the Tab button to auto-complete doesn't work here you have to type the whole steam:i386 out.\nUsing the terminal to do a simulation I saw that it would install the libs from the vivid repos and that I got no errors.  I went ahead and installed.\nIf you check via Synaptic you will see that it pulls in a newer version of Steam than steam-launcher installs, it also installs slightly differently.  These differences lead to the quirks I mentioned above.\n\nThe quirks\nSteam now installs in .steam where as .steam used to just be a link to where the actual Steam install was.  To wit: .local/share/steam  This is the cause of the quirks that I will list below.\nSteam will not find that apps that are in the old location and will want to re-download them all.  If are doing a drag and drop an old folder of the steam apps that you saved previously they need to go in .steam/steam/steamapps/common (note that steamapps is no longer capitalized). The appmanifest files will still go in the steamapps folder but do not copy the  libraryfolders.vdf as that info will have changed to a new location. \nIf you did not save the appminifest files, it's little matter; Steam will just think the games are not installed but if you have placed the steamapps file in the proper location, you can just click the \"install\" button in Steam, Steam will start the install and then discover the existing files and have to validate them.  This will still work fine but will take some extra time as you have to do this for each game.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nIf, like me, you have tried to install Steam via the \"Reinstall previous purchases\" function before installing Steam as detailed above, you should remove the old  Steam repos to avoid conflicts.  Just open \"Software and Updates\" from the dash then go to the \"other Software\" tab, click on the \"installed by the  software center...steam repo\" selection and hit the \"Remove\" button.  When you close the window allow the \"Refresh\" in the prompt and then you can go about the install.\nIt would appear the installing this way only install Steam locally, whereas the steam-launcher was installed system-wide.  This is really only a question of semantics, as steam-launcher didn't really install anything but a link that would activate an option for all users to install Steam. The .desktop file is installed system wide so other users only need to click the icon to install. \nIn either case Steam itself only installed to the local users files and had to be reinstalled for each user.   There is a way to link to the game files for each user so that they can share the actual games and not have to reinstall the same game numerous times but as I never needed to do that, that is beyond my experience.  \nIt looks like you can get the correct version of steam by just installing steam via apt-get, at least after I used steam:i386 sudo apt-get install steam will tell you that \"steam:i386 is already the newest verison\"  Just using steam will allow auto-complete to work but as I was unsure it was the correct package during my test, I did not chance it.\nLastly, this worked flawlessly for me, however in my attempt to fix this I added 1386 architecture via sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386  so if you get errors that steam:i386 cannot be found you may need to do this, but I don't think you will.  One of the dependencies of steam:i386 is multiarch-support which appears to be preinstalled by default so that should make adding i386 architecture superfluous. \n\nLater Edit to include more info\nI was able to later install the latest package directly from Steam and it installed perfectly and the directory folders were installed in .local where they were before. This also added the Steam ppa to the sources so I should get the updates quicker as well(only by a day or so, but..)\nI moved the steamapps folder out of the Steam install so that it would not be overwritten, then sudo apt-get remove steam:i386  Then moved the steamapps folder into .local/share/steam  answered yes to allow the folders to be overwritten and when started Steam logged me in and the games launched without a hitch.\nI'm nearly certain that I had tried the package directly from Steam's website when trying to install before and got the same errors.  Installing steam:i386 pulled in the dependencies correctly, and worked fine \nand I could have left it as was but it bugged me that it seemed \"hackey\".  So you could either install steam:i386 and have it work without fuss, or can remove steam:i386 afterwards and install the package directly from Steam and have the directories were they were previously(and most users expect them to be, this could make it easier to get help form the community in the future).\nEither one you choose should give you a working Steam install\n", "Q: Too many connections and iptables is not working to limit connections per ip I have a dedicated server with 32GB RAM.

Did you install it manually or you relied on the installer?\n", "Q: Cannot boot laptop after copying partitions to new HDD I changed the HDD of my laptop for an SSD. It is a Dell XPS 15, that came with Windows, on which I installed Ubuntu, and has been working for 3 years.\nThe HDD was setup with several partitions, including sda5 (/) and sda7 (/home).\nI created the partition table with gdisk (GPT), and I copied the partitions / and /home into the SSD sbd2 (new /). The partition sdb1 is configured with 1 MB for BIOS.\nThen I booted on CD-ROM to install grub. No error. Run update-grub. OK.\nWhen booting, I can see: \"Operation System not found\". There's no typo, it's actually written Operation System (not operating system).\nI then started again with the CD-ROM, and installed and run boot-repair. It does its stuff, no error reported, and asked to restart. The info is http://paste.ubuntu.com/12093343/\nBut I still have the same message \"Operation System not found\". Any idea?\n\nA: You need to update the /etc/fstab file on the SSD.  It still has the old hard disk partitions, and even a swap partition which you no longer have.  Nothing else looks bad to me, the UUIDs are all correct.\n\nA: Some observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*You claim that you copied both / and /home partitions, but the new disk has just one Linux filesystem partition. This can work if you did a file-level copy (with cp, tar, or something similar); however:\n\n\n*\n\n*At a minimum, you must adjust /etc/fstab and your boot loader configuration for the new setup. The boot loader changes should be handled by Boot Repair, but I don't know offhand if it will adjust /etc/fstab, and it looks from your output as if it has not been updated. This won't explain your primary problem, but you'll have to deal with it sooner or later.\n\n*You must be careful when doing a file-level copy to get permissions and ownership right on the new filesystem. If the permissions are wrong, the system might not boot; or it might boot but misbehave in any number of ways. Again, this issue won't explain your current problem, but you must be aware of it. See the second half of this page for information on how to use tar to copy a Linux installation.\n\n\n*Your partition numbers make me suspicious that your first installation may have used the Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning system; but your new installation uses the GUID Partition Table (GPT). Your current system is set up to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. In theory, this should work; but in practice, some motherboards have problems booting in BIOS mode from GPT disks. If I'm right about this being a problem, there are a number of fixes:\n\n\n*\n\n*These problems can usually be worked around by setting the \"boot flag\" on the MBR's type-0xEE partition. Note that setting the \"boot flag\" on any partition using parted or GParted will not do this. You must use fdisk (in Ubuntu 14.04 or earlier) or set the \"pmbr_boot flag\" on the whole disk with parted or GParted. See this page of mine for more on such problems.\n\n*If your firmware is new enough (newer than about mid-2011), it's probably an EFI, not a BIOS, and in this case it may be better to install an EFI boot loader for Linux. One easy way to test this is to prepare a USB flash drive or CD-R with my rEFInd boot manager. If you can boot with that, then you can install the rEFInd PPA or Debian package -- but you'll need to create an EFI System Partition (ESP) on your disk first.\n\n*You can switch from GPT to MBR partitioning on your disk. You can convert in-place by using gdisk, as described here. You'll then need to re-install GRUB to the disk.\n\n\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't try to combine separate root (/) and /home partitions into one partition; a separate /home partition has clear advantages that you'll be throwing away by combining the two. Depending on your disk sizes, you might be better off using Clonezilla to copy your disk; but IIRC, Clonezilla can't handle copying from a bigger to a smaller partition, so it may not be an option, at least not for the whole disk. (You might be able to use Clonezilla to copy your root partition and then copy /home with cp or tar, though.)\n\nA: I support a few computers that have Windows 7 and ubuntu on them. When I replace a hard drive I use Clonezilla to make an image and restore it to the new drive. I use Gparted to resize the partition(s) and flag the boot partition if needed.\nIf I am going to a smaller drive I resize the partition(s) first if needed then make image. When I restore to the new drive I use the ignore size option in Clonezilla. If the dive I am going to is larger I resize after I have restored the image to the larger drive.\nThere are other methods of doing this however,this method has not failed me yet. With that said, I have not tried this with a SSD drive yet.\n", "Q: Nvidia drivers only work as guest?

So if a process has a name like firefox_foobar and you try to check if firefox is running by pgrep firefox, it will show the PID of the process firefox_foobar. Hence you would get the idea that firefox is running but actually its not.\nHere is an example :\n$ pgrep firefox_foobar\n19002\n\n$ pgrep firefox\n19002\n\nTo get over this issue you should match the exact process name using the -x option of pgrep :\n$ pgrep -x firefox_foobar  ## Shows the PID of firefox_foobar\n19002\n\n$ pgrep -x firefox  ##Shows nothing as firefox is not running\n\nSo in a nutshell your script could take the form :\nif pgrep -x 'ArcaDirect ITD' &>/dev/null; then echo \"Running\"; else echo \"Not running\"; fi\n\n", "Q: Suggestion needed on updating software available on Ubuntu 14.04 LTE Currently I am syncing repo on my laptop running on Ubuntu 14.04 LTE.

A universal unique identifier (UUID) is a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify each virtual machines. It is stored in the SMBIOS system information descriptor. It can be accessed by standard SMBIOS scanning software and used for system management in the same way you use the UUID of a physical computer. \nThe UUID is generated when you power on or reset the virtual machine.

I have a dual boot system with Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 8 on my hp laptop. I have been using this for over a year, but recently, there was some accident after which my Windows 8 is not booting. \nI tried to do a system refresh, but that is broken too.

But I am unsure with resetting.  \n\nA: I can't be positive of what any specific utility will do, but as a general rule, a \"factory reset\" utility is likely to COMPLETELY WIPE YOUR DISK, INCLUDING YOUR UBUNTU INSTALLATION. Less radical repair utilities won't do this, but you must be very cautious about anything designed to restore the computer to its original factory state.\nInstead of running a \"factory reset\" utility, you might consider obtaining a generic Windows installation image and use it to re-install Windows the \"manual\" way. This should be a bit safer, and will set up Windows without whatever bloatware your computer's manufacturer has foisted upon you. You can obtain Windows installation media legally from Microsoft; see this page, or do a Web search on \"obtain Windows legally\" or similar terms, to learn how.\nNote that even re-installing Windows manually is not risk-free; a slipup or bug could end up wiping out Ubuntu. Thus, backing up your personal files is highly recommended. Keeping such a backup up-to-date in the future will help protect you against unexpected random problems -- disk hardware failures, accidents involving disk-partitioning or other low-level disk-access software, mistakes with rm or other file-removal tools, etc.\n\nA: It will not affect Ubuntu unless and until you will not gone a wipe that(Ubuntu) drive.\nIn worse case it may remove your grub loader, but that can be restore easily.\n\nA: once you reset the windows then windows never touch unix paration in your condition. \nonce you completed the windows reset than might be possibility that 1. you have grub with windows And ubuntu menu on start up\n\n\n*if you have no duel boot menu than you have To use ubuntu rescue disk and repair the boot menu.\n\n\nthis will help you lot more but again want To say be careful with my instruction i am not liable for any cause or damage to you.\nthis will work all the time for me.\n", "Q: Bluetooth device appearing and shortly after disappearing Ubuntu 15.04 I am attempting to connecting a pair of Bluetooth headphones in Ubuntu however, when I attempt to pair the headphones the name of the headphones(QY7) will appear briefly and then disappear a few moments later.

How to print using `ldr`? Is typescript for script command the same as TypeScript maintained by Microsoft? How to print using ldr ?\nWhat exactly is typescript in relation to Linux/Ubuntu ?\nSearching Google, I find that TypeScript is a superset of Javascript maintained by Microsoft. Is the output of script stored using this format?\nI see that the output of script is binary.\nHow do I print a typescript file using ldr command ?\n\nA: Take a look at the man script:\n\nSYNOPSIS\n script [-a] [-c command] [-e] [-f] [-q] [-t[=file]] [-V] [-h] [file]\n\n\nNotice that last [file] part. By default, if you simply run script  without specifying where to store the file, it will save everything to a file called typescript. By contrast, if you run script somefilename everything will be saved to somefilename.\nNow if we run file command on typescript to determine the file's type, we get this:\n$ file typescript                                                                                                                                     \ntypescript: ASCII text, with CRLF, CR, LF line terminators, with escape sequences, with overstriking \n\nAs you can see, you've got simple text document there that is in no way related to Microsoft's TypeScript. Even more so, since this is a simple text document you should be able to print it with lpr command easily. \nWord of caution though, if you have output of ls --color -F there, you might run into trouble, because ls adds special characters to colorize the files based on their type. Thus using simple \\ls or dir is recommended\n\nA: They are totally unrelated. Microsoft TypeScript is a programming language while under Unix and Linux typescript is the default output of the script command which is logging everything printed in you terminal session.\nDon't be fooled by the binary status reported by file, it is due to embedded escape sequences. The better way to display typescript files is using the less -r command which preserves formatting/color commands that might be present in the file.\n", "Q: How to use python on eclipse?

So if you only want to see the files from Ubuntu on the Windows PC, just uninstall Samba and its configuration by  pressing Ctrl+Alt+T to go to a terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get purge samba\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nand then install the client only:\napt-get install smbclient\n\nOpen Nautilus and you can browse the Windows network...\n", "Q: switch to root access on a terminal session I have recently installed Ubuntu 14.04. \nI would like to create a root user along with the admin account that was setup during installation.\nThe default admin account does not have a root privilege.\n\nA: Any user in the 'sudo' group should have this privilege.\nYou can make a terminal root (if you're feeling brave and rebellious) by typing sudo bash but there is really no need.\nOther users can be added to this group thusly sudo adduser <username> sudo\nHow can I add a new user as sudoer using the command line?\n\nA: \nI would like to create a root user along with the admin account that was set-up during installation.\n\nAdmin and Root are one and the same on Ubuntu, which means that this:\n\nThe default admin account does not have a root privilege.\n\nis wrong.\nIt really depends what you want to do with the root privilege.\nIf you need to edit a file, you need to use sudo in the terminal - for example this command will open a file called \"file.txt\" from root's home area:\nsudo -i gedit /root/file.txt\n\nIf you are going to be running lots of commands, use sudo su first, then you don't need to keep typing sudo.\nThis answer explains what sudo is and does.\n", "Q: Recently installed ubuntu 15.04 replacing Windows 7, on Thinkpad Edge E430.

If I give ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase my login password, it outputs an hashed string. Is that my passphrase (still unknow...) ? Or it is an hash of the login password ?\nWhat really interest me, it's to be able to backup the passphrase. Sorry for the naive question...\n\nA: ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase is used to display your mount passphrase.\nIf you want to see your mount passphrase, use the following command: \necryptfs-unwrap-passphrase /home/yourusername/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase\nMore related information can be found here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedPrivateDirectory#Recovering_Your_Mount_Passphrase\n\nA: It's not a hashed value, but it is the 128-bit value that is the symmetric encryption/decryption passphrase (key) for your files. It just looks like an MD5 hash because it's a 128-bit value.\nThe passphrase you're queried for is the user's (your?) login password, with which the encryption passphrase/key is encrypted (in ecryptfs' terms \"wrapped\").\nThis enables you to change your login password (with which the encryption passphrase is wrapped) without changing the encryption passphrase itself (which would result in the need to re-encrypt all encrypted files).\nThink of it like an SSH private key that you protected with a passphrase - only that, knowing the \"raw\" encryption passphrase, you can recover your encrypted files without knowing the wrapping passphrase.\nSo you may store this 128-bit value somewhere safe (i.e. write it down and lock it away somewhere), and even if you forget your wrapping passphrase (i.e. login password), or something else goes wrong, you will be able to recover your encrypted files with the ecryptfs-utils - particularly ecryptfs-recover-private after answering the question if you know your LOGIN password with No; it will then ask if you know the encryption passphrase, which you may then type in from the paper on which you've written it down.\n\nA: Did you ever resolve this?  I'm suspecting that you accidentally checked the \"Encrypt home directory\" box when you installed Ubuntu.  I've sometimes neglected to make a copy of the unwrapped hex passphrase myself.  I don't know if there's a way to unlock the encrypted files on a new system if you don't have the hex passphrase.  Thanks for the reminder.  It may have been too late for you.\nIt looks like since timeshift normally runs as root that it doesn't access the decrypted versions of the directories and saves the encrypted versions of them.  This is actually a good thing when you back up to an unencrypted external hard drive but it makes it more important to save the unwrapped hex passphrase.  Maybe the Ubuntu developers should require that a USB stick be inserted at installation time to save it on?\n", "Q: Why isn't NSS using mDNS?

If it already exists, the file will get overwritten.\nThis behaviour is useful for the first of your commands: if there's an existing file, it should get deleted and replaced with the new one. \nHowever, as you need to append all further outputs instead of replacing the previous ones, you need to use the append-redirector >>. This will create a file if it does not exist yet, but appends the redirected output to the file, if it already exists.\n\nAnd please do not use the pipe | to write multiple commands in one line, which would redirect the first command's output (stdout) to the second command's input (stdin).\nYou can use the semicolon (;) to just tell bash to execute one command after the other, as if it was a script file.

It only allows disk sizes up to 2TB and only 4 primary partitions. The other, new type is GPT (\"GUID Partition Table\"), which allows up to about 9ZB (9×10²¹ Bytes, unimaginably huge) for the disk size and allows 128 primary partitions.\nYou obviously have a msdos-partitioned disk, so you may only create 4 primary partitions on it. \nBut you could delete one of your 4 primary partitions and create an extended partition instead. This is not a partition you can format and use to store data directly, but it is like a container for logical volumes/partitions. You can create an infinite amount of logical volumes that behave like partitions to the OS inside this extended partition.\n\nOn a normal Ubuntu installation, you only need / (file system root, format as ext4), but it is very highly recommended to also create a swap partition (format as linux-swap) too. It should have about 1-2 times your RAM size, but that is a discussion itself...\nIf you want, it can also be useful to use a separate /home partition (format as ext4). It will hold all your user data and settings. Otherwise, it is included in /, but having it in a separate partition might make creating backups or reinstalling Ubuntu without losing your data and settings easier.\nAs you dual-boot with Windows, you might also want to create a small (few GBs!) transfer partition to be able to copy data from one OS to the other. Use FAT32 as file system for this, because if you chose NTFS, you might get permission problems. This might be needed because Windows can't access the ext4 partitions Ubuntu uses and needs. However, you may access Windows' NTFS partitions from inside Ubuntu anyway.\n", "Q: Why bracketed paste mode is enabled sporadically in my terminal screen? I use Ubuntu 14.04 and I have a weird issue with my terminal screen which is bugging me a lot. Could someone help me with it or explain me if I'm doing something wrong or non linux-way? I have some sort of a solution but I want understand why this happens again and again.\nI often copy bash commands from my notes or from the Internet and sometimes I get weird 0~ and 1~ symbols which wraps things I copied. It is very annoying and this happens in a totally random fashion.\nAfter a long search I found out that this thing is called bracked paste mode so now I use this command printf \"\\e[?2004l\" to fix my terminal if this mode got suddenly enabled.\nIs it possible to disable this feature permanently somehow? I faced with it on all Ubuntu machines I work now. Previously I used Ubuntu 10.10 and 12.04 and I've never had such issue before.\n\nA: To answer your original question of why this happens, here's a possible scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*My home computer had a new version of zsh that supported bracketed paste (let's call it shell A)\n\n*I sshed into a computer with my shell set to an older version of bash, that doesn't support bracketed paste (shell B)\n\n\nProblem is, my terminal program still thinks bracketed paste is enabled when sshing from shell A to shell B, so it keeps adding the characters around your pasted content (the 0~ and 1~ bits). Shell B doesn't support them so it just passes them through unchanged. You have to tell your terminal to turn off bracketed paste by having your shell print a special escape sequence - which is what printf \"\\e[?2004l\" does.\nThere are a few ways to solve the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't care about bracketed paste at all, turn it off on shell A so it's never enabled in the first place (@jwd's answer)\n\n*If you want to keep using bracketed paste on shell A, but disable on shell B, add the escape sequence to your .bashrc (@MOHRE's answer)\n\n*Upgrade shell B to support bracketed paste, so it properly interprets those 0~ and 1~ characters.\nSide note: if you are using GNU screen, you need to run that printf command outside of the screen. It doesn't seem to work while inside.\n\nA: I resolved it by adding the following content to my ~/.bashrc file:\nif [[ $- == *i* ]]; then\n    bind 'set enable-bracketed-paste off'\nfi\n\nIn that way i dont get bind warnings when i execute bash scripts.\n\nA: You can disable bracketed paste mode.\nTo try it temporarily, in bash:\nbind 'set enable-bracketed-paste off'\n\nThen, if you like how that behaves, you can put the setting in your ~/.inputrc, or system-wide at /etc/inputrc (or wherever it is on Ubuntu).\n\n\nA: You can put that command  in your bashrc. Then it would apply every time you open your terminal.\nJust type vi ~/.bashrc and add printf \"\\e[?2004l\" at the end and save the file with :wq\n", "Q: how to install last.fm scrobbler on ubuntu 14.04? http://www.last.fm/download?showplatform=Linux\nit has the guide for 12.10 but not newer ones\nplz someone help \n\nA: It does not matter which repository do you use.

In the \"Something else\" partitioning menu what partition table (MBR/GPT) does \"New Partition Table...\" use?\n\nA: There is no default partition format for Linux. It can handle many partition formats.\nFor a Linux-only system, either use MBR or GPT will work fine. MBR is more common, but GPT has some advantages, including support for larger disks. The main issue with GPT is compatibility; not all OSes support it, and some can't boot from GPT on BIOS-based computers.\nFor just a Linux system, I'd choose GPT. If you need to dual-boot with Windows, go with MBR.\nThat said, if you have a newer system, a very large hard drive, and you use UEFI I`d go with GPT.\nThe installer will use GPT automatically for disks over 2 TiB, if you choose the automatic option.  It will create either the bios_grub or efi system partition depending on whether the machine supports UEFI or not.\nSo to answer your question, it depends on your system, hard drive size, and whether you have UEFI or not.\nMaster Boot Record (MBR) - Most IBM-based PC storage units use this partition table format. MBR is often referred to as the msdos partition table. The MBR can only support storage devices up to two terabytes. MBR supports the concept of logical and primary partitions. A storage unit with the MBR table can only have up to four primary partitions. Many users wanting to make a multiboot system with more than four Linux distros often have the problem of not being able to support more partitions. Remember, logical partitions cannot be made bootable. Multiboot systems must use a different partition table discussed later.Linux.org\nGUID Partition Table (GPT) - Some IBM-based PC storage units have GPT, although it is usually because the user reformatted from MBR to GPT. However, most Intel-based Mac systems use GPT by default. The GPT partition table offers many improvements over MBR. GPT can support storage units up to over nine zettabytes. GPT is also the most highly recommended partition table for computers needing more than four operating systems on one hard-drive. For example, if a computer with a ten terabyte hard-disk is meant to be a multiboot system for seven different Linux distros, then GPT should be used. Most Unix and Unix-like operating systems can fully support GPT. However, most Windows systems cannot run on a GPT partition table. As for Mac systems, only the Intel-based ones can boot from GPT.Linux.org\n", "Q: minecraft keeps saying this Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM warning: Using incremental CMS is deprecated and will likely be removed in a future release\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM warning: You have loaded library /home/ollie/.minecraft/versions/1.8.8/1.8.8-natives-1423604296267/liblwjgl64.so which might have disabled stack guard.

That way I can use the free space but without being in danger of accidentally changing anything. The virtual disk should be encrypted and contain a swap and ext4 data partition. It has to be persistent between reboots until I manually delete it though.\nAfter I'm done with that computer and having saved everything of importance from the virtual data partition to a persistent location, I want to safely disable swap, unmount the data partition and safely delete (shred) the whole virtual disk image. So in the end, the used HDD does not look modified, except for that one big file being created and deleted, but not giving out any information due to encryption and shredding.\nIs the procedure I have in mind possible or will there be problems? Can you please give me advice how to create such a disk image and use it from my portable system etc.? \n\nA: IMHO you should fully follow this guide and keep your swap file and data safely on your USB SLC disk.\nHowever, if you insist on putting the swap on the HDD, the only things you have to do differently is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a swap file on the HDD:\nsudo fallocate --length XY /media/szSomewhere/file.swap\nsudo chmod a+rw /media/szSomewhere/file.swap\n\nwhere X is the number you want and Y the unit (k, m, g, t, p, e. See man fallocate for more info) and /media/szSomewhere is the location where you want the file to be on the system you're booting from. \n\n*Format the file to create a swapping device: \nsudo mkswap /media/szSomewhere/file.swap\n\n\n*Add the swap to the running system: \nsudo swapon /media/szSomewhere/file.swap\n\nThe additional swap is now available and can be seen by cat /proc/meminfo. Obviously, You'll have to do this on every computer you use, so make this into a script.\nTo have encrypted file storage on the HDD:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the encrypted file system:\nsudo apt-get install sudo apt-get install encfs\n\n\n*Setup an encrypted directory:\nencfs /media/szSomewhere/.encrypted /media/szSomewhere/UnEncrypted\n\nand start using the unencrypted directory like any other.  In order to encrypt the /media/szSomewhere/UnEncrypted directory simply type:\nfusermount -u /media/szSomewhere/UnEncrypted\n\nAs long as the directory is unmounted all the information in /media/szSomewhere/UnEncrypted will seem to have disappeared but is actually stored in /media/szSomewhere/.encrypted. The only way to gain access to this information again is by unlocking it by typing the same command as in step 2...\n", "Q: Chat client supporting Facebook? It seems that facebook more or less recently stopped to provide its XMPP Chat API. As a consequence, Ubuntu users can't chat anymore with facebook contacts using Pidgin for example. I am looking for a chat client able to connect with Facebook and Gmail contacts. I am not sure this is possible, but if any solution exists, I would be happy to try it.\n\nA: It is possible with pidgin and the purple-facebook. purple-facebook is a plugin and available in the official repository. To add the repository and install the plugin, use the following commands:\nsudo sh -c \"echo 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jgeboski/xUbuntu_$(lsb_release -rs)/ /' >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jgeboski.list\"\ncd /tmp && wget  http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jgeboski/xUbuntu_$(lsb_release -rs)/Release.key\nsudo apt-key add - < Release.key  \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install purple-facebook\n\nAfter istalling open pidgin and add the account: Accounts -> Manage Accounts -> Add and choose \"Facebook\" and not \"Facebook (XMPP)\"\nSource of purple-facebook: https://github.com/jgeboski/purple-facebook\n\nA: The Thunderbird email client has a chat function for facebook. \n1.Go to the \"file\" menu on top of the page. \n2.Select \"chat account\"\n\nYou should see this screenshot:\n\n3.select facebook\n4.click next\n5.It will ask you for your username.

Well, I loaded up the latest version of Ubuntu and made a MAC address change before installing it and noticed the changed MAC address carried over to a new install I made. Are there any other changes like this that can carry over?\n\nA: MAC address changes write the new MAC address to the network card. It's kept there so it will apply at moment 0 of power-up. Other changes you make to hardware that is staying behind will stay behind. You can mount the disks rw, and change anything. You cannot expect changes made to software (installs, configuration, removal, etc) while running in Live mode to persist (as the system keeps it's config on the USBstick/CD). \n", "Q: Why can I ssh into my server after I physically restart it, but not after I reboot via ssh? I have a computer in my living room that I built myself to use as an ssh server to run various programs on as a fun project. I put Ubuntu Server 14.04 on there, and then used Google to figure out how to set it up to let me ssh into it to program and do other things on it. This worked perfectly for a while. I was able to ssh in on my Mac from anywhere, and I was able to have multiple terminals all ssh-ed in at once. I could also reboot remotely, wait a minute, and then get right back in.\nThen AT&T came and replaced our router. Ever since then, I haven't been able to consistently ssh into the machine. If I can't get in, I can physically power off the machine and then physically turn it back on again, and then I can usually ssh into it no problem; only that one time though. After that, I will either get a \"Connection Refused\" error or more often an \"Operation Timed Out\" error. I also am never able to get more than one terminal logged into the machine. I am assuming that this is because of something that happened when the router got switched but I can't figure it out. \nI did have to add my port forwarding rules on the new router and I did that by memory, so maybe something went wrong there? Any help is greatly appreciated. I'm pretty new at this if you can't tell...\n*8/21 edit\nI reinstalled Ubuntu Server 14.04 on my machine and reconfigured ssh. I am having more luck being able to ssh into it now, but I am still having an issue where once I log in once, it won't let me log in again from a different terminal. I don't have it set to only allow one log in, so I don't know what the issue is.\n\nA: It could have something to do with your server switching internal ip address. Try setting your server to a fixed address.\n", "Q: Lubuntu 14.04 show internal error after battery is drained I use a 2011 MacBook with Lubuntu 14.04 Whenever I have used up all the battery I get an Ubuntu Internal Error which disappears after rebooting again..

(Next time when it happens I will add more details to the question)\n\nA: This has been going on for a long time now and is not something to be worried about, according to me.\nSometime we need to clear the apport to stop it from displaying an error report on every restart.\nOpen terminal\ncd /var/crash\nwarning: next command deletes everything in the directory \nsudo rm -r *\n exit\nP.S.- be sure to be in the right directory before executing the rm command.

I have checked user permissions and file permissions, nothing has changed.\nI am assuming that there was some NFS related update which has caused my configuration to be incompatible in some way?\n\nA: Although I still do not know why this suddenly happened. I have found a workaround.\nSince running mount -a in the terminal mounts the NFS shares, it was suggested to me to add that command to /etc/rc.local and have it run automatically during the boot up.\nSo edit /etc/rc.local and add mount -a before the exit 0 line.\nNow upon starting the client the NFS shares are once again mounted without me having to do anything manually.\n", "Q: Boot failure after upgrading to Ubuntu 15.04 I have Sony Vaio Fit computer with a dual boot setup of Windows 8 and Ubuntu 14.10. \nAfter upgrading to 15.04, booting into Linux fails with a number of 'builtin file not found' errors. \nI tried toggling Secure Boot but that doesn't help. \nThe boot-repair info is at http://paste.ubuntu.com/12101145.

It may work with lower resolutions, but that is all I tested.\nI have a 1080p USB camera I sometimes use and it was set to high for my USB camera. After I switch it to 720p and then restart cheese it works.\n", "Q: How do I use KeePass app on other computer? I generated several passwords using KeePass on one of my computers.  How do I access KeePass with all my passwords on another computer?\n\nA: Keepass uses a password safe which is nothing more or less than an encrypted file. So the only thing you have to do is install Keepass and replace the empty password file by one that you've taken from another computer and that contains all your passwords.\n\nA: I had to copy the keepass icon in my home folder to a usb drive then plug the drive to my other computer, copy and paiste it to my home folder.  Then I simply clicked on the open folder icon and the account file is showing.  I just clicked it and hit open then entered my master password and that's it.\n\nA: KeePass is an application in the traditional way and not an \"app\", which means by default it doesn't use online storage or syncing and its primary use is to directly work with files on the local computer/device. Also KeePass is not an online service like some of it's competitors.\nThe files KeePass creates for you are password databases. If you don't set up syncing yourself with the mechanisms and plugins offered then you have to transfer the these databases manually and select to open them with KeePass or a compatible application to access your data. Not long ago this was how applications where typically used: users were required to know how to feed data to an application and they were responsible for backups too.\n\nA: I use KeePassX or even KeePass on multiple systems. The database file is encrypted and in my case shared via a cloud memory, eg Dropbox or OneCloud. For more security I use a encrypted filesystem to synchronize.\n\nA: Install KeePass on the other computer. KeePass uses single files as data storage. You created this file when you first used KeePass. In the dialog which pops up every time you open the Application (which also asks you for the password) you can see the path of the data file you're using.\nYou need to put this file in a cloud storage like Dropbox, copy.com, etc. Then you choose the same file on the other computer.\n", "Q: Process pasued but connection not terminated to files in locasystem I am not sure whether this is the right place or not but as this is a question which needed a solution I am posting here.\nI have used\nkill -SIGSTOP 1234\ncommand to pasue a process named as 1234 and its paused then I did like \necho \"\" > mylogfile.log\nand its size right now like 1byte, so its worked. Then I again started that paused process with \nkill -SIGCONT 1234 \nand given ls -sh but I dont know how mylogfile.log showing old size and not  new updated size as 1byte.\nSo what I am trying to achieve ?\nSimple , I dont want to kill the process to nullify my logfile. when I did SIGSTOP process running but my log file went to 0 bytes and when I start it with SIGCONT and its GB size back but I dont want this GB size. I want to have my logfile as 0 byte only\nIs there any way I can achieve this ?\nPlease help and I am sure this will help lot of System Administrators. \nThank you.\n\nA: SIGSTOP pauses a process without the processes' knowledge or consent. The process knows that the next byte it wants to write to one of its opened files is at GB+1. SIGSTOP/SIGCONT does not adjust this position information.  \nThe usual way to handle this problem is catching a SIGHUP in the program and reopening the log, then contuning. \n", "Q: When i tried to uninstall ubuntu i accidentally uninstalled the incorrect version So I tried to uninstall ubuntu but I clicked the wrong one to uninstall and I can no longer access anything to uninstall the other version of ubuntu.

It also says charged rather than keep charging it until it reaches 100%.\nIs there any way to solve this issue?

I tried this installation several times and every time I get the same problem. How can I fix this problem and get Ubuntu to install?\n\nA: Try doing this manually, select 'something else' during install and create a partition to install into.\nSo long as you ignore any NTFS partition you wont hurt Windows, it's not as scary as it first looks.

So, what do I exclude fron the upgrade to ensure my functioning digitizer (Wacom) and pen functions continue to work?\n\nA: Determine why your pen and digitizer work now - what software supports them, and how that software is configured.

Is there another way of doing this? I'm trying to uninstall Ubuntu with the OS uninstaller, and I am facing a problem. The uninstaller says I need to have a USB or live USB and I was wondering if there was another way to remove Ubuntu from my computer.\n\nA: \nI was wondering if there was another way to remove Ubuntu from my computer\n\nYou can only remove an operating system from another operating system. An active operating system can not be removed.\nThe advice they give are the 2 easiest methods that will work for anyone regardless of how many operating systems they have. But you can also remove an operating system from another operating system. Boot up Mac OS or Windows and remove the partitions of that operating system you want removed.\nBesides that you can also use a gParted Live DVD instead of the Ubuntu Live DVD or Live USB.\nA little more difficult and would require a bit of setting it up: you can also do this from an installer you put on a different partition. Create a partition the size of the Ubuntu ISO. Put the ISO in that partition. Reboot. Enter grub menu and boot from the ISO. During the installation part you can delete any partition. \nBut I would assume you want to install another operating system. If so, see the installation procedure of that installation on how to remove the current operating system.\n\nA: Are you trying to uninstall the running system?\nIf you have another system on your computer, you could use that to delete ubuntu's partition(s).\nIf you haven't installed something else but would like to, just delete the partition(s) during the  installation.\n", "Q: Sort files alphabetically before processing I use the command\nfind . -type f -exec sha256sum {} \\; > sha256SumOutput\n\nto hash every file in a folder hierarchy. Unfortunately, sha256sum doesn't get the file names from find in alphabetical oder. How can this be fixed?\nI'd like to have them ordered before they are hashed so they are hashed in alphabetical order (this has a reason).\n\nA: Using some pipes and sort\nfind . -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -r0 sha256sum > sha256SumOutput\n\n\nExplanation\nFrom man find\n   -print0\n        True; print the full file name on the standard output, followed\n        by a null character (instead of the newline character that -print\n        uses). This allows file names that contain newlines or other\n        types of white space to be  correctly  interpreted by programs\n        that process the find output.  This option corresponds to the -0\n        option of xargs.\n\nFrom man sort\n   -z, --zero-terminated\n        line delimiter is NUL, not newline\n\nFrom man xargs\n   -r\n        If the standard input does not contain any nonblanks, do not run\n        the command. Normally, the command is run once even if there is\n        no input. This option is a GNU extension.\n\n   -0   \n        Input items are terminated by a null character instead of by\n        whitespace, and the quotes and backslash are not special (every\n        character is taken literally).  Disables the end of file string,\n        which is treated like any  other  argument. Useful when input\n        items might contain white space, quote marks, or backslashes.\n        The GNU find -print0 option produces input suitable for this mode.\n    \n\n\nExample\n% ls -laog\ntotal 4288\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 4329472 Aug 17 08:20 .\ndrwx------ 57   20480 Aug 17 08:20 ..\n-rw-rw-r--  1       0 Aug 17 08:15 a\n-rw-rw-r--  1       0 Aug 17 08:15 a b\n-rw-rw-r--  1       0 Aug 17 08:15 b\n-rw-rw-r--  1       0 Aug 17 08:15 c\n\n% find -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -r0 sha256sum                  \ne3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855  ./a\ne3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855  ./a b\ne3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855  ./b\ne3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855  ./c\n\nThe values in the first column are the same, as the files doesn' have any content in my test.\n\nA: You should be able to just pipe your output from find to sort.\n", "Q: Lightest text editor with tabs?

I tried following guides by doing sudo apt-get install nvidia-current sudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates in terminal but they don't work.

Not every manufacturer of these dongles have their own chip inside these dongles. They tend to purchase these in large quantities from the same manufacturer so internally they are identical to other dongles using the same chip.\nFor Linux/Ubuntu that normally means someone used a dongle with Linux with the same chipset as you have, figured out how to get it to work and someone updated that generic driver so it got support for that chipset.  That means that that device is supported out of the box on Linux.\nIn Windows each seller of that dongle will have its own software with that dongle and also their own (but maybe just slightly different) driver to go along with it. \n\nA: If you run lsusb terminal command, you will see what chip is installed in your dongle. Your device is\n05c6:6001 Qualcomm, Inc.\n\nIn most cases Linux identifies the dongle by the chip code 12d1:1506.\nSome of devices are implicitly defined in the option kernel module by vendor and product ids, but some are identified by some other parameters.\nYour device works as a network card, not as a serial modem and it is identified differently.\nYou can see in your output Cls=e0(wlcon) this means that the device is a USB_CLASS_WIRELESS_CONTROLLER. That is defined in /include/uapi/linux/usb/ch9.h.\nIt is managed by rndis_host driver. It is linked to it because Sub=01 Prot=03.\nThat is defined in the /drivers/net/usb/rndis_host.c in\nUSB_INTERFACE_INFO(USB_CLASS_WIRELESS_CONTROLLER, 1, 3),\n.driver_info = (unsigned long) &rndis_info,\n\nDo not look for these files in your computer. They are in the Linux source tree.\nE.g. rndis_host.c\n\nA: Linux already contains all the necessary generic drivers that are required by most of the devices out there. This is possible because Linux is powered by a huge community of open source developers (which surprisingly nowadays include Microsoft too.)\nIt does not mean that you an not install your own drivers, you most certainly can.\n\nA: I have identical behaviour with my 3G dongle. Ubuntu has support already built-in while Windows OS doesn't. When you plug in the dongle in Windows the OS installs the drivers which is on the dongle automatically.\n", "Q: APT totally broken i am on Ubuntu 14.04 and my apt is totally broken.\nThe problem started with grub-pc package and now continues , along with that package, with libuuid1:amd64 package.\nintsallation of libuuid1:amd64 package ( using apt or dpkg ) gives error \npackage libuuid1:amd64 2.20.1-5.1ubuntu20.6 cannot be configured because libuuid1:i386 is at a different version (2.20.1-5.1ubuntu20.4)\n\nearlier atleast, whenever i got updates, the other packages got installed.

It then renders the video after it was completely captured. This shouldn't have the problem, which could be caused by running out of ram, using too much CPU power, etc. RecordMyDesktop barely uses any ram or CPU power while recording.\n", "Q: can not open software center 14.04 LTS OS - Ubuntu 14.04 lts \nBackground - wanted to install chrome, but software centre was not opening. \nWhat I did -\n\n\n*\n\n*tried to uninstall and re-install software centre through terminal. failed. result - \n\n\n\n\n\n*opened package manager it says - \n\n\n\n\n\n*Tried this solution - one of the solutions suggested for same question\nit gives this result - \n\nNow what to do??\n\nA: Add a repository, so that the Google Chrome can be installed\nwget -q -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add - \nsudo sh -c 'echo \"deb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list'\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install google-chrome-stable\n\nAfter that start\nsudo apt-get install software-center\n\nIf you don't need Google Chrome, remove with\nsudo apt-get purge google-chrome-stable\n\nand remove the repository\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\nA: Try (re-)downloading chrome from the official website.\nInstall using terminal (replace chrome.deb with the actual filename):\ndpkg -i chrome.deb\napt-get install -f\n\n", "Q: No audio output from Banshee I installed Banshee player on my old Lenovo G430 running Lubuntu 15.04 (Vivid). It was able to scan through my music library and add all files to the library. However, when I try playing something, it goes through all the motions: the play time progresses, and the seek bar moves.. but it does not output any audio.\nAudio and video play back fine in other applications, it's just Banshee that doesn't output anything. I couldn't see any options in the preferences to choose an output device, so I assume it plays back to the default output. How can I fix this problem?\n\nA: To fit this into an answer:\nIt was reported that my comment to → install pavucontrol ← worked with only that first step taken. Maybe some wrong configuration residues. Nice.\n\nA: I had this happen to me a second time. Since I had already installed pavucontrol, I opened it up and under the Playback tab, I found that the application I was having trouble with was indeed playing sound, but had the wrong output selected (HDMI instead of Analog Stereo, in my case.) \nI switched output from the dropdown menu, and that fixed the problem.\n", "Q: ubuntu will not let me set login page background I want to change the background image of my Ubuntu (14.04) login screen, but Ubuntu doesn't display the changes. I tried changing the background in dconf-editor which resulted in there being no background just the vanilla Ubuntu color. And logging in resulted in the screen freezing in a kind of white noise mix of the login screen, after which I come in the desktop.\nThen I tried it with Ubuntu tweak with no change.\nI'm using the cinnamon desktop, I don't know if that may be the problem?\nAnyone have any idea? Thanks\n\nA: Ubuntu Tweak will most probably work.\nPossible reasons of your problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Permissions to your Image file is wrong.\nThe Image file should have the following permissions:   \n\n\n*\n\n*Owner: Root \nAccess :Read and Write     \n\n*Group: Root\nAccess: Read-only       \n\n*Others: Read-only\n\n\n*Your File location is not suitable\n\n\nI strongly recommend you to copy your Image file to  /usr/share/backgrounds\nStep-wise Solution\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all, let's make it easy to open folders with Admin Privilege: \npress Ctrl+Alt+T to go to a terminal and type (Enter Password if prompted):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/apps\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install open-as-administrator\nnautilus -q\n\nNow you can open any folder with permission by right-clicking on the folder and choosing open_as_Administrator (Enter Password if prompted).\n\n\n*Open the background folder with Admin Privilege.\n\n*Now Copy your image and Paste it to this folder.\n\n*Right click on the Image and go to Properties\n\n*Go to the Permission Tab and Change the permissions as listed above.\n\n(Note: Once you Open the folder as Admin, Owner will be shown as Me instead of Root)\n\n*Close the window.\n\n*Now Use ubuntu-tweak and select the file from the Backgrounds folder.\n(Assuming that you know to use Ubuntu Tweak).\n\n\nA: I had the same problem after installing Gnome desktop. I think its because these \"themes\" call for background from different places.\nWhat I did: \n\n\n*\n\n*went to /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme\n\n*found the .png file that was my background (for me it was noise-texture.png)\n\n*replaced that file with a background of my liking (keeping \"noise-texture.png\" name)\n\n\nFor you the directory would probably be more like /usr/share/cinnamon-shell/theme.\nI believe this also depends on the display manager you are using. I was using GDM.\n\nA: Possible cause: the file you want to use as a background is not readable by 'others'.\nCheck the access rights of the file: \n> ls -l\ntotal 21552\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     1320 dec  5  2002 your_image\n\nIt should have 'r' permissions for the group 'other' (as is the case here).\n", "Q: How do you export/move your home directory to another user? Let's say I have 2 account, account A & B. I don't want to use account A anymore, yet I still want to retain all the files. I want to move account A's belongings to account B. How do I do that?\n\nA: If you don't care about already existing application settings of account B, you can copy the contents of /home/accounta with all hidden files and overwrite everything in /home/accountb, I guess. You can simply do that in a terminal: sudo cp -R /home/accounta/* /home/accountb/.\nElse you'd have to sort everything by hand. I'd recommend to create a new folder in Account A (While being logged into Account A) and moving everything you need there. To see hidden files in Nautilus go to (no free translating) Edit→Settings→[ ] Show hidden files and backups and tick it. Then move it as above: sudo cp -R /home/accounta/new\\ folder/* /home/accountb/.\nLastly, I think, you will have to take care of some file ownerships. I think that can be done only by executing sudo chown -R accountb /home/accountb && sudo chgroup -R accountb /home/accountb.\nDISCLAIMER: I didn't look up any of this. To be sure, at least try every command without sudo and look for syntax errors etc.!\n", "Q: Laptop Screen Rapidly Flashes Off/On/Off/On... at Boot I have an Asus laptop with a Radeon HD 8650G (although the sticker says 8670M) graphics card dual booting Windows 10 and Ubuntu 15.04.

The lspci -v command lists radeon as my kernel driver in use. \nI'm concerned that this problem could be bad for my graphics card.\nDoes anybody know what the problem could be and how I can fix it?\n\nA: Does your laptop have double GPU ? (integrated GPU and AMD Radeon)\nIf yes, then try to read the post here.\nGenerally, this issue is due to the non fully support for AMD and Nvidia drivers on Linux, the best solution is to use the integrated GPU instead of the AMD one.\n", "Q: Compiler & Burner for 8051 Micro-Controller lab?

I have been blocking these IP addresses one by one using the firewall. The process was and is still a pain, so I contacted the ISP responsible for these IP addresses and nothing has been done. Right now I need to find out the address pool to which they belong so that I can simply block the whole damn pool of addresses. Anybody has an idea how to do this?\n\nA: I suggest you to set iptables to limit number of connection per host.\nDdos can use unlimited number of ip addresses\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25 -m state --state NEW -m limit --limit 50/minute --limit-burst 200 -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -m limit --limit 50/second --limit-burst 50 -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -j REJECT\n\n-p tcp --dport 25 => Specifies traffic on port 25 (smtp).\n-m state NEW => This rule applies to NEW connections.\n-m limit --limit 50/minute --limit-burst 200 -j ACCEPT =>This is the essence of preventing DOS.\n--limit-burst is a bit confusing, but in a nutshell 200 new connections (packets really) are allowed before the limit of 50 NEW connections (packets) per minute is applied.\nSecond rule – Limit established traffic\nThis rule applies to RELATED and ESTABLISHED all traffic on all ports\nIn summary, 50 ESTABLISHED (and/or RELATED) connections (packets really) are allowed before the limit of 50 ESTABLISHED (and/or RELATED) connections (packets) per second is applied.\nor use set of rules for all input\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -m limit --limit 50/minute --limit-burst 200 -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -j REJECT\n\nAlso you have answer from Oli and usage of whois\n\nA: For an allocation block of IPs, you can just whois the IP you have. This will only get you as far as the ISP level usually unless you're talking about a company big enough to have its own allocations. For example, here's what I see if I enter the IP address of one of my servers:\n$ whois 109.74.xxx.yyy\n% This is the RIPE Database query service.\n% The objects are in RPSL format.\n%\n% The RIPE Database is subject to Terms and Conditions.\n% See http://www.ripe.net/db/support/db-terms-conditions.pdf\n\n% Note: this output has been filtered.\n%       To receive output for a database update, use the \"-B\" flag.\n\n% Information related to '109.74.192.0 - 109.74.199.255'\n\n...\n\nThe block there is 109.74.192.0 - 109.74.199.255. You can use a subnet calculator (or big brains) to work out that that's 109.74.192.0/21, and just block that.\n... But that's a lot of servers, and not just mine.\n\nIt seems unlikely that a DDoS would be coming from just one network though. The rest of this answer assumes that we're actually talking about something coming from many networks though parts of it may still apply to single-network ingress.\nUnless you can get into a command-and-control situation over this botnet —which is extremely unlikely— you'll never know the full scope of it, you'll never know which IPs it contains other than the ones that connect to you.\nThis may well not be a denial of service attack, it might be:\n\n\n*\n\n*People trying to hack the MTA. Like any service, they occasionally contain flaws that can be tested. Mailservers are particularly talkative and poorly configured which makes them a good target. There's nothing you can do about this. \n\n*Is it an open relay? Are spammers just relaying their email through your machine? If you are, stop running an open relay.\nI generally recommend not running mailservers. People who do it professionally, as their only job tend to do it better: focussed security, bigger and more robust networks and much better spam detection that comes from scanning hundreds of billions of incoming emails a day. The cost is usually very justifiable.\n", "Q: Ubuntu, Windows both lag while running apps, playing videos, opening files stored on HDD Ubuntu, Windows both lag while running apps, playing videos, opening files stored on HDD\nWhenever I used anything that was on my hard disk, Windows would freeze momentarily. It would lag on exploring through folders, loading photos, opening pdfs and what not. While playing, a video would run for some time, freeze and again run, only to freeze again - as if it were buffering. But on playing the same video after copying it to a pen-drive, it would play smoothly. Same was the case with mp3s. Adobe Reader, Photoshop; every single application would lag.\nThinking that it could be a problem with Windows, I decided to give Ubuntu a try. There was no hitch while running live session. Everything ran smoothly. But after installing it, I've been facing the same problems I faced on Windows. \nI can't access my BIOS too. Whenever I press the button that's supposed to take me to it, nothing happens. But somehow, it seems, the first priority to boot from has been set to USB.\nI am not a tech-savvy and neither proficient at using linux. \n\nA: This is not because of Ubuntu or windows, it's because your HDD has some bad sectors, try to run a HDD test app like HDD Scan 3.3 to test it, then after you find the bad sectors use and app Like HDD Regenerator(free) to fix it. \nif the bad sector is unrepairable, you can try to cut the part of HDD that has it, Make it unallocated.\nIf all the above doesn't help you fix your problem you have to buy a new HDD!\nNote: I recommend using Hiren's BootCD for this Hiren's BootCD\n", "Q: Accessing A Local IP Address Globally Through a Static IP Using a Web Browser I'm trying to setup an Ubuntu server for my daily Web developments. Now that I run the code the framework puts the deployment (HTTP server that holds the web service) on a local address: 127.0.0.0:89. If the static address of my server is 99.99.99.99, is there a way I can access to the local deployment, globally, through a browser? \nI can't go simply to 99.99.99.99:89 because obviously that port is not recognized/opened globally. The only port that can be used on a browser by default is the HTTP port which is by default 80. \n\nA: As you noted, 127.0.0.0 is a local address.

My machine had a RAID 1/0 system but i'm not sure what is the specific settings.\nHow to make sure that it's safe to format sdb and sdc? Does the available space on the gparted ensure that?\n\n\n\nA: \nHow do I check whether my sdb and sdc drives is mounted? And if they are, where are they mounted?\n\nTo find out what drives are mounted you can check /etc/mtab, which is a list of all devices mounted on the system. It can sometimes have various tmpfs and other things you aren't looking for mounted too, so I reccomend cat /etc/mtab | grep /dev/sd to get only physical devices.\nAs you showed in your answer df also works, if it doesn't show up in df, it's not mounted.\n\nHow can I mount all spare unused drives into a single directory? \n  If not a single directory into separate directories in /media/?\n\nThe file /etc/fstab contains a list of drives on the system and rules for when, how and where to mount them. when you type in mount /dev/sda1 mount checks fstab for info on how to mount the disk. mount: can't find /dev/sdc1 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab means that mount didn't find a line in mtab for the disk, not that it failed to find the disk itself.\nYou can make mount not look in fstab by specifying where to mount the drive yourself, as in mkdir /media/sdb1; mount /dev/sdb1 /media/sdb1\nIf you edit fstab to add entries for your spare drives, you can make your spare drives mount at boot. \nYou can install pysdm to make writing entries in /etc/fstab easy. \n\nHow do I check which disk is used and which disk is still a clean slate[?]\n\nThe best way would probably be to try to mount any partitions on it and look at the data. based on the screenshots from gparted /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdc1 look to be formatted and have data on them. Gparted doesn't have anything in the \"Space Used\" column for unformatted drives, because you can't use space on an unformatted drive.\n\nWhat is a GPT?\n\nIt's a header at the beginning of a disk that describes where the different partitions on the disk begin and end, and some metadata about them. It supersedes and maintains some compatibility with an older format for this task called MBR(Master Boot Record).\n\nA: mount views all currently mounted disks.\nYou can use mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/DISK to manually mount disks wher X stands for the disk number and Y is the partition number and \"DISK\" is the mount point. This \"DISK\" directory should be different for each disk and shoul exist before mounting\n", "Q: I cannot install my Brother DCP-J552N printer I am new to Linux and Ubuntu.  \nWhen I go to Add Printer, my printer shows up.

How can I make those 2 distributions use their own separate Swap Area?\n\nA: SWAP is just an \"extension\" of the RAM. You dont need SWAP partitions for every distro, you can use the same SWAP space for every distro you have installed on you drive, just map it right in your fstab and thats it!!\n\nA: Check /etc/fstab on each system, and read man fstab. For example, on my system (YMMV):  \n$ grep swap /etc/fstab\n# swap was on /dev/sda1 during installation\n#UUID=339b7a56-3b67-47e8-87e1-f483296a39bd none            swap    sw              0       0\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0\n\nAlso, to see how swap is set up at boot time you could read the init scripts found by\n grep swap /etc/init/* /etc/init.d/* \n\nAnother source of information is man -k swap\n", "Q: Is there still no way to delete and rename files in Libre Office? How can I delete or rename files from Libre Office open dialogue box?\n\nA: In Libre Writer from the menubar go to: \nTools - Options - Libre Office -General \nand mark the \"Use Libre Office Dialogue Boxes\":\n\nNow you may delete or rename files withing the open dialogue box!\nThere is another way to delete files without changing default options (for Unity desktop):\n\n\n*\n\n*In Libre Office Writer go to File - Open (Ctrl + O):\n\n\n\n\n\n*Drag the file you want delete and drop it to the \"Trash\" icon on the lower left corner.\n\n\n\nEdit: If you are using Gnome, you will have to customize your desktop a bit for this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install gnome-tweak-tool\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\n\n*Enable \"Show Trash on the desktop\" option within Gnome tweak tools.\n\n*Resize Libre Open dialog, i.e make it smaller so that it will allow you to see that Trash icon.  \n\nA: No there isn't. Why?\nLibre Office is just that - it's a free Office Suite. So the basic requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create new files\n\n*Open files\n\n*Edit files\n\n*Save files\n\n*Close files\n\n\nThe formatting, image / table inserting, text colour are all side effects of the \"Edit files\" requirement.\nSo why don't they enable deleting / renaming files? It doesn't come under the categories:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open files - You don't need to change the name of a file to open it. And you don't want to delete that file.\n\n*Edit files - You don't want to delete the file - maybe renaming would make sense.\n\n*Save files - You don't want to delete the file, and you can use \"Save As\" to rename.\n\n\nIt is very inconvenient. Is it?\nI can see why you would say that - the open dialogue and the file manager look very similar:\n \nBut they do very, very different functions - one if for managing files. The other is for accessing one type of file - opening it.\nIs there a workaround? Sort of.\nI wouldn't call it a work around when it's not a bug. But the solution? Open a file manager.\n\nI have a 1984 sharp FW-710 Font Writer:\n\nThe open dialogue looks like this:\n\nThis gets across the intentions of the open dialogue much better, in my opinion. Nowhere does it suggest you can delete any files - it clearly shows you need to enter the file name and it will open it. To delete, you have to close Word Processor and open Utilities.\nWhile I wouldn't suggest Libre Office adopts this (for a start we have complex things like Directories and Symbolic Links that make it harder - and I doubt you remember the name of every file. But, when you see it like that, it shows clearly that it is an open dialogue and nothing else.\nThe save is the same:\n\nThis box doesn't look like you can remove anything, because a) you can't and b) you shouldn't be able to.\nMaybe a couple of things were better 30 years ago?\n\nIt's by design. Who wants a coffee machine (Libre Office) that also cooks pizza (Deletes Files)? Not me - I want my coffee machine (Libre Office) to make coffee (Open Files).

For example:\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --scale 2x2 --mode 1920x1200 --fb 3840x2160 --pos 0x0\nxrandr --output DVI-0 --scale 1x1 --pos 320x2160\n\n--scale 2x2 - make everything on 4K screen twice larger\n--mode XxY - explicitly set the resolution for the screen (not necessary if is already set)\n--fb XxY - set the size of a virtual screen (framebuffer) (this iss very important. \nWithout this, you will be able to use only a fourth of your screen). That maximum framebuffer size might be specified in xorg.conf - then you cannot exceed it (it is written in the first line of xrandr -q output).\n--pos XxY - in my case I set the absolute positioning of the screens, so my laptop screen is directly on the bottom of the external screen.\nsources: Arch Wiki Page and This post\n", "Q: Wlan driver fails to auto-load in Xubuntu 14.04 I installed Xubuntu 14.04 on my dad's laptop, it has a Broadcom 43 wireless chip that works fine with the wl driver, but it fails to load at boot.

However, when I tried to shut down, the dialog box for shut down wasn't able to be clicked, and after trying several things, I was forced to do a hard shut down.\nTurning my computer on today, I was greeted with several \"System Program Problem Detected\" dialog boxes dancing around on the screen.

I'm still trying to figure things out. I ditched Windows 8.1 after their free upgrade to Windows 10. \nI used gparted live to delete the partitions of the disk (500gb hitachi HDD) then partitioned and formatted the hdd to a ext4 format. I burned the KUbuntu 15.04 iso to a DVD and booted to perform a new install. I used the non-UEFI CD drive. \nDuring the installation of Kubuntu the installer asked me about the size of the partition. I accepted the installations default which was two partitions each at approx 230 GB. \nI thought it would be like in Windows where you could see two disk drives and be able to save to either one. Once I got into the new OS I can see both drives listed. When I click on the second partition I see a folder in their but cannot open the folder. I cannot add a new folder to the drive to save anything onto it. The second partition seems to have no purpose. I used gparted to see the partitions and it lists the second partition as an extended partition. It shows approx 10 gb used on that partition. \nNow that I have everything setup the way I like it (took several hours) I would rather not start over to get the partition size right. Is there a way to either use the second partition so I can save files to it or a way to combine both partitions together without losing anything?

To swap to booting from linux, I then just need to modify the menu.lst file on the c: drive to make it boot into Linux on the second partition...\nIt seems like the documentation for grub4dos is pretty terrible, but http://diddy.boot-land.net/grub4dos/Grub4dos.htm helped a lot\n", "Q: How to reinstall ubuntu and preserve home directory I am trying to reinstall Ubuntu after running into some pretty troublesome issues. I am following the directions here but I can't seem to figure out how to start the UbuntuInstaller like it's telling me to. My current setup involves a dual boot with a USB. Do I need to delete the contents of the USB and start over with how I originally installed it, or should I be doing something different from this?\nI'm not sure if this is persistent live or fully installed - it was set up with this tutorial.\n\nA: After spending the better part of a day on this, I finally have a good idea of what's going on. The installation package was on my flash drive, but Ubuntu itself was installed on the partition of my hard drive. So, the way to reinstall is to use the same flash drive that had the installation package and boot directly through that. This allows Ubuntu to do the installation process again, and about halfway through the installation process, you will have the option to either upgrade or install alongside the current version of Ubuntu, or \"do something else\". Since the installer version on my flash drive was actually older than the current version on the hard drive, I decided to re-download the most up-to-date version of Ubuntu on a new flash drive, and boot through that one instead. Then, using that, I chose the \"do something else\" option and was able to manually select the partition I wanted. The dialog box showed which one Ubuntu was already installed on, so I chose that partition, and then changed the mount point to '/'. Choosing this one meant that all of my stuff would stick around, and lo and behold, it did!\nNOTE: if the version on the flash drive is newer than the version on the hard drive, your best bet is the upgrade option. This updates the OS but preserves all of your information/files/etc. I didn't have this option because my flash drive and hard drive versions ended up being the same.\nThis site contains a useful step-by-step guide, if you need any additional direction.\n\nA: The last line and the link indicates that you have a persistent Live USB\nIf you have a full installation in an USB drive see Re-install Ubuntu without losing data in home folder\nThe instructions for reinstalling while preserving the /home directory is for a full installation in an internal hard drive. This may or may not work for a full install in an USB drive. These instructions will definitely not work for a persistent live USB.\nSee What would be the differences between a persistent USB Live Session and a installed Ubuntu in a USB drive? for some detailed answer about the differences between full install USB and persistent USB.\nIf you can boot from the USB and get to your personal files, copy them in a different USB and in the internal drive so that you don't lose your data.\nTo copy your personal data into your internal drive, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the USB\n\n*Open \"Files,\" the second icon on the left.\n\n*You should see your home folder. right click on the\nfolder(s)/file(s) you want to copy and select copy. You can select multiple folders/files by holding down Ctrl button and clicking on different files and folders.\n\n*On the left panel of \"Files\" look for hard drive icons under\nDevices.\n\n*Click on the one that has your other personal files.\n\n*Navigate through folders to get to the folder where you want to put\nthe files/folders you have copied. Create a new folder if you want.\n\n*Right click at an empty space inside the folder and select paste.\n\n\nOnce you have your data safe and secure, you can use the tutorial you had used before to format the USB drive and start over again.\nIf you want to have a full install in an USB, you will need two USB drives. \nFirst one to install from, a Live USB, like the one you have now. \nSecond one 8GB or a bigger one to install to. \nFollow the instructions at How do I install Ubuntu to a USB key? (without using Startup Disk Creator) for creating a full install in an USB.\nIf you have a full installation in an USB\nFirst, you will not be able to use that USB to install Ubuntu in another disk. If you are choosing \"Install Ubuntu\" from your USB then you don't have a full install.\nIf you have a full installation in an USB, you will need another Live USB that you can boot Ubuntu from. Use the second USB to install Ubuntu in your first USB. \nHope this helps \n", "Q: how to add some space for a specific DIR with a USB key I have a /home/Completed dir.\nFor some reasons, I can not move this directory. Now my system is quite full.\nSo, I would like to grant some space to the /home/Completed directory from a usb key.\nIs it possible ? \nThanks \n\nA: If you can't move it due to operational reasons (in other words, you can move, but things won't work anymore), then here's what you a gotta do:\nIn Terminal:\ncd /home\nmkdir usb\nsudo mount /dev/sd_\nsudo mv /home/Completed/* usb/\nsudo rm -r /home/Completed\nsudo umount /dev/sd_\nsudo mv usb Completed\nsudo mount /dev/sd_ Completed\n\nAnd the USB drive will hold the contents, but they will show up as that same directory.  Also make sure to run\nsudo mount /dev/sd_ /home/Completed\n\nwhen you boot up, otherwise it won't show up.\nREPLACE /dev/sd_ with /dev/sdc or /dev/sdd or whatever your USB shows up as in /dev/.\nIf you can't move it due to permissions, then you're out of luck.  Use the USB for storing other stuff you can move.\n", "Q: \"No Bluetooth adapters found\" I'm using an HP 250 G3 notebook with Ubuntu 15.04 32-bit. But I can't use the bluetooth service.

Actually I thought that one of the benefits of a Linux system are the shared dependencies, which makes individual programs small in space. GIMP needs 15 MB disk space, the requirements for Photoshop are 2 GB. \nWhen Ubuntu switches to snappy packages which bring there own libraries, won't they also need a hell lot of space?\n\nA: \nWhen Ubuntu switches to snappy packages which bring there own libraries, won't they also need a hell lot of space?\n\nNope (well probably not). Libraries tend to be small anyways but a Snappy application is basically a single compressed archive package with all the files contained for the app to run. So the libraries are compressed as well making them a few KB.\nBut I agree it's a different approach from the shared library vision where 1 library is used across the system. I consider it a small price to pay for the other benefits: snappy lets you install different versions next to each other (it has a \"current\" symlink pointing to the active version) so rollbacks are just a change to the symlink. It is a big improvement regarding security (it is a container and most/all of snappy files are readonly).\nI do wonder what the method will be if there is a bug in 1 of those libraries and tons of apps need to be updated... (how would they do that? I hope they do not create a new version for every app :P)\n\nGIMP needs 15 MB disk space, the requirements for Photoshop are 2 GB. \n\nThat's not necessarily due to shared libraries. \n", "Q: Terminal periodically swarmed with kbuildsyscoca4 lines Every several hours, my terminal session is hit with hundreds of lines starting with kbuildsycoca4(10461). \nAn example line is kbuildsycoca4(10461) KBuildServiceFactory::populateServiceTypes: \"phononbackends/gstreamer.desktop\" specifies undefined mimetype/servicetype \"video/anim\"\nThis started happening yesterday when I installed konqueror from the Ubuntu Software Center.

Select the USB drive. When Ubuntu starts, select Spanish. The installation should be now in Spanish\n\nA: In your BIOS you need to change it from UEFI to legacy. \nFrom there you can choose USB from the boot menu (Usually F12) when starting your computer.\nFrom there you will be able to boot from usb.\n\nA: *\n\n*From the Windows settings/power options, turn off fast boot.  When shutting down, try selecting \"shut down\" instead of sleep or any other options.\n\n*At power on, get into the UEFI settings with some function key, like F2 (varies by machine).  Go to the boot order and put the USB and DVD before the hard disk.\n\n*If you cannot get to the UEFI settings with some function key, from the Windows shutdown, hold down the shift key, and select \"restart\".  At restart, you will have a screen of option icons, you may actually select the USB device here to see if you can boot, but that will not be permanent. Select the Trouble shooting icon, then from the next screen select the UEFI settings (I think that's were it is).  Now change the boot order to have USB and DVD before the hard disk.\n\n*You should now be able to boot the USB.  If there are multiple USB choices in the boot order, the ones with \"UEFI\" in their name should be the ones used for UEFI mode.\n\n*If none of the above works to boot the USB, you may have a machine which only boots USB in legacy mode, but that should only be a last resort, since by booting in legacy, you will install in legacy (Which in your case, in which you want to \"remove\" Windows, that may not make much difference, but you might want to dual boot awhile before removing Windows.\n\n\nA: Easier way to do this:\nBoot into Windows.

On the first I had all three OS's (Windows 8.1, Ubuntu 15.04 & Kali Linux 2.0) partitioned and installed prior to running Ubuntu boot-repair via live USB. This successfully gave me an Ubuntu GRUB. On the second laptop, It was dual-booted with Windows 8.1 and Kali 2.0 when I ran Ubuntu Boot-Repair via a live USB. This gave me a Kali GRUB default menu.\nI would like to switch my second laptops default GRUB to Ubuntu's now that I have added the Ubuntu OS to it (After already running Ubuntu Boot-Repair). Mostly this will be so I can use Ubuntu Grub-Customizer to quickly and easily make changes as OS's are added and/or subtracted.\nI'm sure this is an easy fix but I'm stuck and I've spent days trying to read and sort through material, but all I can find is changing fonts, orders, images, etc. \n\nA: first off all you have to boot from Live-USB with Ubuntu OS on it.\nthen run this command:\n sudo apt-get purge grub grub-pc grub-common\n\nwhen asked select yes.\nafter that install grub with this command: \n sudo apt-get install grub-common grub-pc\n\nEnsure that you select “/dev/sda” over the “/dev/sda1″ partition.\nreboot your PC and you'll get the default grub2. \n", "Q: Grub - what now This OS is so difficult.

Since I had Ubuntu on a USB stick (that's how I installed it originally also), you just boot the computer from it and choose 'install'. \nIt then asks you if you want to reinstall it. I selected this option and it did things I can't recall, but they weren't good. Later, I booted again to the USB and on the USB options menu I found another option called something like 'wipe entire drive clean and reinstall'...so I selected that one and it did a great job.

Also do I even need to change the drivers manually, or can I just swap out the card and the software manager will just find the Wright drivers for me? I'm using ubuntu 15.04 with nvidia drivers current gpu: gt 730 New gpu: gtx 950 (when it is relesd).\n\nA: I upgraded my card by powering down, swapping cards and then booting up and installing the new drivers from the command line. It looks like the GTX 950 was added in the 352.41 version of the drivers, so you will need at minimum that version. (nvidia-352 should work but I haven't tested.)\nInstall the new drivers by adding the official PPA and following these instructions:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-355\n\nThe install process was straightforward and I have not had any problems with the driver/card.\n\nA: There are several ways to do it, but I advise you to install via repository\nThis is how I do it:\nInstructions\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us and find the name of your latest NVIDIA Drivers for your card. Mine is 352.\n\n*In terminal:sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mamarley/nvidia\n\n*In terminal:sudo apt-get update\n\n*Finally, to install, via terminal(replace 352 with your driver number you found on nvidia site):sudo apt-get install nvidia-352 nvidia-settings \nNote sometimes NVIDIA Driver doesn't let you install giving you an error of X server something. To fix this you have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*CTRL + F1 \n\n*Login and stop lightdm: sudo service lightdm stop\n\n*Run the commands for terminal that I wrote on top and it should work fine.\n\n\n\nAnother way is just go to Settings > Software & Updates > Additional Drivers and select the latest NVIDIA for your card.\n", "Q: software center \"install\" buttons greyed out Running ubuntu 14.10 with software center 13.10 on my laptop.

I made a custom LiveCD with the tools I needed for a no-harddrive laptop (getting to reuse some old chassis I have for basic network config tasks), using the uck.\nI can boot to the new liveCD no problem. One of the tasks I want to use this for is to upgrade IOS on a Cisco router in my lab. I have other CDs that hold a variety of IOS binaries, and want to be able to (at least briefly) swap out the liveCD for the IOS cd, copy the IOS I want into /home/tmp (that I created), then TFTP it from there to the directly connected. I would prefer not to bake the IOS images into the boot iso, because code changes frequently and I don't want to have to keep recreating the image.\nMy problem (after opening a couple of xterms, opening the Files gui file explorer, and copying cp and ls into /home/tmp to presumably get it into the ramdrive and not needing to be called off of the boot cd):\nI can ls the liveCD, and see the files in Files. When I switch disks and repeat the ls, I see zero files (like the mount is empty). I can read the CD on a different laptop with a hard drive, so suspect the loop mountpoint is bound to the livecd and can't be used for something normal but not sure. Is there a way to get around this, beyond a second cdrom (presumably external, on another USB port), or flash media (like a USB stick)?\n\nA: Bensel:\nIt has been in my experience, when running from the LiveCD, you cannot remove the LiveCD for any reason and expect the system to stay up.  Why not create a bootable USB thumbdrive to run off of and leave the CD-R for doing your updates?

Is there a way I can run \"lock_logoff jon\" or \"unlock amber\" and it runs the script for that user?\n\nA: You absolutely can use only one script instead of 3. For that, you could just pass arguments from the command line. In every bash scripts and functions, some variables called positional parameters are automatically generated. At the beginning of your script (i.e. when no other command has been executed yet), you will have :\n$0 : the name of the script\n$1 : the 1st argument passed\n$2 : the 2nd argument ...\n\nNote that those arguments are affected by your IFS & your quotation, so john doe will count as 2 arguments whereas \"john doe\" will count as one. You can read more about it here\nOnce you've read the arguments, you will also have to ensure that the user really exists (i.e. you didn't call your script with a typo). To do that, you could use the following code snippet :\n#!/bin/bash\nuser_name=\"$1\"\n\n#here, id returns 'true' if the user exists, else 'false' \n#>/dev/null 2>&1 hides the output of the id command\nif id -u \"$user_name\" >/dev/null 2>&1; then\n    sudo passwd -l \"$user_name\"\n    sudo pkill -u \"$user_name\"\n    echo \"Account locked and logged off!

The students bring their own computers, and to standardize things I'm making everyone boot from a LiveUSB of Ubuntu with persistence storage.  I had every student bring in a USB, and I formatted them over the weekend to work with UEFI.\nI used the Mac Linux USB Loader since I use Mac, and some of the students use Mac, and since it's supposed to be compatible with PCs as well.\nThe students came to class, I handed them out, and all of the students with Macs had theirs boot perfectly, no problems, went right to Ubuntu.\nThe students with Windows, the USBs would not boot, no matter what anyone did.  We loaded the boot menus and disabled secure boot and all of that, and it still wouldn't work.\nOnce student got very, very close: he got dropped to a GRUB shell.  I think this is the only student in class who actually has UEFI hardware.  The rest, I presume, have BIOS.\nI have since tried to make a Live USB of Ubuntu that will boot on BIOS.  The only test of a BIOS machine I have is an old HP desktop.  It is capable of booting from USBs, and I can select the USBs from the boot menu.  I also have a Surface 3, which boots from UEFI.  The original live USBs boot just fine from my Surface 3 and from any Mac.\nI have tried making a live USB and booting it from the Mac, the Surface 3, and the HP Desktop.  So far I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*UNetbootin from both Mac and from Windows\n\n*PendriveLinux's Universal USB Installer (run from Windows on the same machine)\n\n*Making a startup disk in Ubuntu, using the Startup Disk Creator app\n\n*I tried installing Porteus, following all instructions from within Ubuntu\n\n\nEach time I have reformatted the USB sticks to erase old files.\nNothing works.  None of these methods produced a USB that would boot on my HP desktop OR on my Surface 3 OR on any of my macbooks.\nThe original sticks were definitely functional for UEFI machines.\nWhat do I need to do here?\nThanks.\n\nA: Short answer\nThere might not be a universal solution, so you may have to resort to different tools for different computers.\nLong answer\nIt sounds like the students have their own computers, which in turn means that you're probably dealing with a dozen or more different models. If so, there are quite a few variables at play, including (but not limited to):\n\n\n*\n\n*Computer age -- As a general rule, brand-new computers are often hard to get working because they have new hardware for which Linux drivers may not have yet been written.\n\n*Firmware type (EFI vs. UEFI vs. BIOS) -- Computers older than about mid-2011 mostly used BIOS firmware, whereas beginning in mid-2011, manufacturers shifted rapidly to UEFI. All Intel-based Macs use EFI, which is similar to UEFI. (UEFI is essentially EFI 2.x.) EFI and UEFI boot in mostly the same way, but there can be some subtle differences.\n\n*Boot mode -- Most EFI- and UEFI-based computers provide a feature called the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which enables them to boot BIOS-based computers. Some UEFI-based PCs that shipped with Windows 7 installed Windows in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, and so may be configured to more easily boot Ubuntu in BIOS mode, rather than in native UEFI mode. It's also usually possible to boot Ubuntu in this way even on newer machines, although system-specific firmware options will have to be set. Understanding and controlling this detail on a dozen or more computers can be a challenge.\n\n*Buggy firmware -- Even aside from the firmware type, a lot of computers ship with downright buggy firmware. This can make booting certain media difficult or require system-specific workarounds.\n\n*Selecting boot media -- Many computers require hitting Esc, Enter, or a function key to bring up a boot manager menu that enables booting from a removable disk such as a USB flash drive. The \"magic key\" varies from one computer to another, though.\n\n*Secure Boot -- This is an optional UEFI feature that can interfere with booting Ubuntu. In theory, Ubuntu works with Secure Boot enabled. Practice usually follows theory, but there are exceptions to this rule.\n\n*Hardware support -- Even aside from hardware age, sometimes you need to tweak boot options to get things to work. A year or two ago there was a rash of problems with video hardware. I see fewer questions about that today than I did then, probably because support has improved; but you might still need to pass particular kernel options (like nomodeset) for some computers.\n\n\nA lot of your problems are likely to be caused by firmware issues, and in particular by system-specific quirks and bugs. Furthermore, your ideal solution boots in either BIOS mode or in EFI/UEFI mode and supports storing files on the boot medium. I don't know offhand if there are any tools that support creating such media. If there are, I wouldn't be surprised if these tools were to fail on some computers, so you might need to prepare media in some other way for some of your computers.\nOverall, my recommendation is to abandon your current approach and to try another: virtualization. In particular, VirtualBox is open source and is available for OS X, Windows, and Linux, so chances are all of your students can run it. You can install Ubuntu under VirtualBox yourself, then distribute your installation to your students, who should be able to run it on their own systems, no matter what the host OS. This will neatly bypass all of the variables I've just identified.\nThe main downside to virtualization is that it imposes extra overhead. On a computer with lots of RAM (say, 4GiB or above), this shouldn't be a big deal; you can run a lightweight desktop environment and all the tools you need for C++ development in 1GiB or a bit more, so on a 4GiB system, you can give 1GiB to the virtual machine and be fine. (Starting with Lubuntu rather than the \"base\" Ubuntu can be a good approach.) If a student has just 1GiB of RAM, though, either the virtual machine will be memory-starved or VirtualBox will end up relying on swap, thus dragging performance down. Thus, before you embark on the VirtualBox solution, you should probably take a survey of the hardware your students will be using to be sure this approach is viable for the available hardware.\nOf course, you could use a mixed approach, too -- VirtualBox for students who have sufficient RAM, and deal with individual issues on a USB-based dual boot for those who are more resource-impaired.\n\nA: Use YUMI on Windows.

Similar to the Emoji picking keyboard that appears in Android or iOS.\n\nA: I know this question is very old, but I've also been interested in this matter for a while, so I've developed a simple emoji picker tool for Ubuntu. \nThe main issue with this approach is that you need to paste the emoji where you want it after choosing it.\n\nA: $ uname -a\nLinux aardvark 3.13.0-61-generic #100-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jul 29 11:21:34 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n$ apt-cache search emoji\nfcitx-table-emoji - Flexible Input Method Framework - Emoji table\nibus-table-emoji - ibus-table input method: Emoji\nlibrime-data-emoji - RIME schema data - Emoji\nlibunicode-japanese-perl - module for converting Japanese encodings\n\nYes.\n\nA: You can go here for a good emoji picker: http://emojikeyboard.org\n\nA: You can use pro emoji keyboard (or emojiselector) at http://emojiselector.com. They issued extension for Chrome, Opera, Firefox. This emoji keyboard is very cool with real feeling when typing.\n", "Q: Automatic updater on Ubuntu 14.04 I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and I have enabled automatic updates but every time my Firefox and Chrome are updated they are downloaded from scratch, so every time my update size is more or near 100MBs.\nWhy doesn't Ubuntu download only the update patch for these two browsers? I want it to download only  the patch files, not the complete browsers on each update. I think Ubuntu does this for all software.\n\nA: So does the package management. lt is not intended that individual patches are downloaded. That would mean that the software must be recompiled on your system. For this Ubuntu is the wrong distribution. You should try in this case Gentoo.\n\nA: I'd strongly disagree that Gentoo is the fix for this. Gentoo might download a source patch but you'd still need to keep the full source, all the build dependencies and then recompile the whole thing. Wholly more expensive than just downloading a binary archive of the whole thing (in most cases).\nAnyway, what you're asking for has been mooted before as delta-packages. Rather than downloading a whole package, you download successive upgrades and apply them.\nWhile that might sound nice, it has serious practical problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Calculating deltas on the build servers is really time and memory -expensive. These are servers that are already overworked.\n\n*All the changes also have to be stored and listed and mirrored. That's a lot of extra disk space (the Debian version of this ran out of disk space two years ago).\n\n*To fully upgrade from an initial release can mean downloading data that has been repeatedly patched multiple times. This is bad for both mirror and user.\n\n*Updates take longer to apply because you're unpacking and patching from so many files. Far more expensive on the CPU than just replacing some files.\n\n\nThe first three points above alone spell out a situation that somebody creating and hosting packages would want to stay well away from.

For example, when I type ping 8.8.8.8 &, why can we see ping process working? And when I type find / -name '*test*' & , it's also seen on monitor.\nWhy is that? Is it not really in background?\n\nA: The & directs the shell to run the command in the background, i.e, it is forked and run in a separate sub-shell, as a job, asynchronously. \nNote that when you put & the output - both stdout and stderr - will still be printed onto the screen. If you do not want to see any output on the screen, redirect both stdout and stderr to a file by:\nmyscript > ~/myscript.log 2>&1 &\n\nUsually you may want to discard the stderr by redirecting it to /dev/null if you are not worried about analyzing errors later. \nYou can also even run commands/scripts at the same time, in separate sub-shells. For eg;\n./script1 & ./script2 & ./script3 & \n\nA background  job can be brought back to the command line before it finishes with the command:\nfg <job-number>\n\nThe job-number can be obtained by running\njobs\n\n\nA: When you use &, the process is running in background. But its standard output is still the terminal.\nIn fact, you may run ping 8.8.8.8 & and find / -name '*test*' & at the same time (resulting in a mixed output), but you may not run ping 8.8.8.8 and find / -name '*test*' at the same time on the same shell.\nIf you don't want to see anything, use something like ping 8.8.8.8 &> /dev/null &.\n\nAdditionally, you may want to learn about nohup and disown.\n\nA: I wanted to try and answer specifically the why part:\n\nWhy is that?\n\nPOSIX implementation of job control, choose to attach STDOUT,STDERR to the parent terminal[1]. I suspect this was the default choice historically perhaps because there used to be just one physical terminal and no emulators back in the day, and so the terminal was the only choice where all jobs could write output to(?)\nAnd STDOUT/ERR seems to be rather hard to get back if you have created the the terminal without a program like screen and your terminal and the shell in it is in-accessible or susceptible to die if you closed your SSH: https://superuser.com/questions/50058/after-the-fact-remote-nohup-with-tcsh/50077#50077 Though as the answer there indicates, it could be done by attaching gdb if the parent shell has disowned the process.

Is this normal?\n\nA: \nNext, I used my father's USB to transfer another file from my netbook to his laptop (my USB was with my teacher at the time) and then the USB got infected.\n\nFirst, how do you know? Have you scanned it? What does the virus do? How did it get there, or do you not know?\n\nSo it means that a virus from the library computer (which runs on Windows 8) got into Ubuntu\n\nI'm not sure what you mean here. You plugged a USB with a possible Windows virus into an Ubuntu laptop. Now maybe the virus tries to run itself as soon as you plug it in - I guess that's possible. If it is a Windows virus, maybe it runs this command:\nmove . C:\\Program Files\\NotAVirus\n\nto move the virus to program files. But in Ubuntu there is no path called C:\\Program Files\\NotAVirus, or any move command. A virus running that command here, would get this error:\nmove: command not found\n\nSo lets summarise:\n\n\n*\n\n*A virus is at school - possible, although unlikely in my opinion.\n\n*It moves to your USB (USB 1) - quite possible\n\n*It moves to Ubuntu - almost impossible. Okay, so you can write a virus for Linux, and you could even write one for Windows and Linux, but it's 3 or 4 times the amount of coding and gets you maybe 2% extra computers being infected. Unlikely that someone would.\n\n*Assuming it is a Cross-OS (Windows and Linux) virus, it moves itself to your Ubuntu laptop, and does what?\nIf you have WINE installed, so you can run Windows programs (.exe files, like SketchUp or Microsoft Word).

Currently running 14.04, I ran the software updater twice, was expecting to be \"automatically\" upgraded/updated to 15.04, but this did not happen. \nSo either I'm doing something wrong or I'm wrong about how the update/release/upgrade process works. \nDo I really need or want to upgrade to 15.04? If so, how? \n\nA: I'd recommend sticking with 14.04 LTS.\nThe LTS stands for Long Term Support, which means that issues with software and security vulnerabilities will be fixed and maintained for 5 years, so until April 2019.\nThe next LTS release will be in April 2016, otherwise the standard support period is 9 months. So if you chose 15.04, you'd ideally want to move to 15.10 before the end of January 2016. More info about the release schedule for Ubuntu can be found here.\nThere may be new features in newer releases, and they are likely to support newer hardware, but an LTS is more likely to be stable for longer.\nI think there's a 'move to new release' option in the software updater somewhere if you're set on the upgrade, but I don't tend to use the GUI for updating so can't point you there more accurately.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 is an LTS -- Long Term Support -- release.  As such, it will be serviced at least until the next LTS verion is released (likely 16.04, based on past history).  Given support expires much more quickly (one year from release, as I recall) for non-LTS versions, if you don't want to upgrade every few months, you may want to stick with 14.04 for the time being.  IMO, you don't need to upgrade at 15.04 unless there's a feature change you consider important.\n", "Q: Ubuntu bootable Usb So I created a bootable Ubuntu pendrive. When I reboot, it just goes straight to Windows. Same thing if I boot from UEFI or if I change the boot order to external. It just won't do anything. I'm running Windows 10 and want to dual-boot with Ubuntu 14.04 (I think that's the one). Thanks!\nEDIT: I downloaded the latest build of Ubuntu, been hearing about 14.04 not working on some Windows 10 computers (if not all). I tried booting into Legacy, and it worked...sorta. It showed me the installation options, but as soon as I typed something, it would report an error, and then I would be stuck in a terminal with no way to access anything. Reverted back to windows to download the latest build. I'll let you guys know if it works.\nEDIT EDIT EDIT: After updating, it seems it is working. Thank you all for your help!\n\nA: You need to go to your UEFI settings and specifically tell it to boot from the USB stick only.  If you change the boot order and something else is wrong with your USB stick (like it's missing its UEFI boot loader) it'll just skip it...\nUnfortunately, UEFI settings are vendor-dependent so I can't tell you what to press exactly and what menu to go to, but I'm betting it's in the Advanced Settings.\n\nA: There probably is a key like F2 which you can press right when you start your computer to be shown all boot media available. You should find your USB pen drive there and be able to select it.\nIf you get this dialog but your USB stick doesn't appear, Ubuntu probably isn't put onto the USB stick properly.\nMake sure there only exists 1 partition on the USB stick. Some systems have problems with more than 1 partition existing when booting from a USB pen drive, others don't. Format this partition with FAT32 (make sure it is this FS!) and put on Ubuntu again.\nAlso, make sure that booting form external / usb is enabled in the bios settings.\n\nA: UEFI only detects FAT32 flash drives. Use LinuxLive USB Creator to create a FAT32 live USB. Then from Windows 10 Advanced Recovery Settings boot into the advanced boot menu. Go to Troubleshoot. Then choose \"Use device UEFI USB\". That's it. It should work.\n\nA: Dual booting Windows 10 and Ubuntu\nIn the above link, I answered how I was able to create a dual-boot a laptop to an HDD with Windows 10 and a Flash drive to Ubuntu.

Use git clean -xfn for a dry-run to check that everything is ok.\n\n", "Q: Removing MAC OS X and installing clean Ubuntu I have MacBook Air with an older MAC OS (10.6…).  I’m unable to boot it in to OS X just getting an Apple logo and a little thing keeps spinning below the logo.  I spent tons of time troubleshooting this issue to no avail.  I’ve decided dump MAC OS and install clean version of Ubuntu from scratch.  Is there a way of accomplishing this?\n\nA: Make a USB stick with Ubuntu and boot from it. Select \"Try Ubuntu\".\nThen open GParted and select Device → Create Partition Table. This will destroy all partitions on the disk. DON'T DO THIS IF THERE IS ANY DATA YOU WANT TO RECOVER. In this case either copy all data to an external hard drive or to a USB stick or ask me about it in the comments if you're dealing with too much data. If your internal hard drive is less than 2 TiB in size, choose \"msdos\" (default). If it's bigger than 2 TiB, you might have to choose \"gpt\", depends on how big you want your partitions to be. If you have disk bigger than 4 TiB, alsways select \"gpt\". You cannot make partitions bigger than 2 TiB with \"msdos\" and you cannot make any new partitions after the fist 2 TiB with \"msdos\". That's why there are the limits of 2 TiB under which it's better to choose \"msdos\" and 4 TiB over which \"gpt\" is the way to go. Note that this is a disk specific choice. You will be able connect 6 TiB external hard drives, no problems, even if you choose \"msdos\" for your internal disk.\nThen make the partitions as you wish. Make a swap if you might run out of ram and make ext4 partitions for system, home, whatever you want. If you only want one partition, that's also fine.\nThen start the installation and when you get to the point where you're asked where to install Ubuntu, select \"something else\". Then choose the ext4 partition you made as /. This is where your system will go. If you made other partitions for home, etc., also select them.\n", "Q: hwinfo replaced with ... what?

When Windows is installed in UEFI mode you already do have an EFI partition.\nThen you have to install ubuntu in UEFI mode - the existing EFI partition will be used.  \nLearn more : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\n\nA: *\n\n*Is it important to create EFI system partition for partition table type MBR?\n\n\nNo. Generally computers that came with partition table type MBR have BIOS. Newer computers that come with partition table type GPT, also come with UEFI instead of BIOS. If this is true for your computer, then your computer has BIOS and not UEFI. If there is no UEFI, there is no need for EFI system partition, as a part of UEFI goes into the EFI system partition. So, only computers with UEFI must have EFI system partition.\n\n\n*If yes, then EFI system partition should be primary or secondary?\n\n\nThe EFI system partition should be primary. In partition table type GPT, all partitions are primary, is this type of partition table can have many more than four primary partitions. If you do need to create an EFI System partition in a MBR, the partition should have the ID 0xEF.\n\n\n*What is an EFI system partition and what its significance?\n\n\nThe new computers don't have a BIOS, but have UEFI, United Extensible Firmware Interface. The Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) needs a partition called EFI System partition (ESP). \nFrom wiki: ESP contains the boot loader programs for all installed operating systems (which are contained in other partitions on the same or other storage device), device driver files for devices present in a computer that are used by the firmware at boot time, system utility programs that are intended to be run before an operating system is booted, and data files such as error logs.\nNote: If your computer came with UEFI and GPT, and you changed the UEFI to Legacy/CSM/BIOS mode, before installing Windows 7, then you should install Ubuntu in the same mode. In this case you will not need the ESP partition. You may delete it or keep it if you want to revert back the UEFI mode for some reason. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI for more on UEFI.\nFrom oldfred's comments:\nYou can install Windows 7 in UEFI mode but have to copy to flash drive and move some files around. And if you install Windows 7 in BIOS mode to a gpt drive it converts drive to MBR, but does not do it correctly. It leaves the backup gpt partition table, so Linux sees both MBR & gpt. Since it does not know what you want, the only choice is to start over. But you can remove the backup gpt data with fixparts. But to fully utilize new hardware installing in UEFI mode is better. \nHope this helps   \n", "Q: Connecting Mobile Broadband and WIFI simultaneously on Ubuntu OS Ubuntu 14.04.\nObjective: wwan0 is my Broadband Connection - want to use to connect to intranet only (corporate network)\nwlan0 is my WIFI connection - want to use to connect to internet only\nI am using NM and able to connect to both networks simultaneously.\nProblem:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I check \"Use this connection only for resources on its network\" for WIFI (wlan0), I can only access intranet.\n\n\noutput of route\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\ndefault         10.103.6.66     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 wwan0\n10.0.0.0        *               255.255.255.0   U     9      0        0 wlan0\n10.103.a.bc     *               255.255.255.192 U     13     0        0 wwan0\n\n\n\n*When I check \"Use this connection only for resources on its network\" for Mobile Broadband (wwan0), I can only access internet.\n\n\noutput of route\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\ndefault         10.0.0.2        0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 wlan0\n10.0.0.0        *               255.255.255.0   U     9      0        0 wlan0\n10.103.d.ef     *               255.255.255.192 U     13     0        0 wwan0\n\nHow/What do I configure so that I can achieve my objective? viz, use WIFI for internet and Mobile BB for intranet\n\nA: I have solved the problem and have met my objectives. \nI am using the hint provided to me by Pilot6. \nBy using a script I am able to identify the default route that is assigned when connecting to wwan0 something like :\nIP=$(nmcli dev list iface ttyACM1 | awk '/gw =/ { print $7 }')\nI then use the default route to set routes for specific IP addresses on the intranet. \nroute add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 gw $IP\n\netc\nAll other traffic is then routed via wlan0.\n\nA: Well theoretically, you can't connect to two networks simultaneously.

I have seen that the grub menu entry for recovery on my Ubuntu is :\nlinux   /boot/vmlinuz-3.16.0-45-generic root=UUID=c1f08a7e-c1e0-4409-97cb-8094359408cb ro recovery nomodeset\n\nbut I didn't find any explanation to what does the recovery flag involve. Is that a way to configure the kernel in a different way? Is that only true for Ubuntu?\nSince I have only one kernel on my computer I guess it boots in the same kernel only with different modules loaded and different options set.\n\nA: Recovery is for every kernel. If you have 5 kernels, you'll have 5 recoveries and they'll be named after the names of the kernels in grub. You have other options than booting the normal system when booting into recovery (for example freeing space or updating software or opening a root shell). If you boot the normal system from recovery, that's not a full graphical boot which means that not all graphic drivers can be loaded this way. That's why you might get worse graphics performance. Also, boot flags are set differently.\nWhat does nomodeset mean specifically? I'll just copy this one from here:\n\nThe newest kernels have moved the video mode setting into the kernel.\n  So all the programming of the hardware specific clock rates and\n  registers on the video card happen in the kernel rather than in the X\n  driver when the X server starts.. This makes it possible to have high\n  resolution nice looking splash (boot) screens and flicker free\n  transitions from boot splash to login screen. Unfortunately, on some\n  cards this doesnt work properly and you end up with a black screen.\n  Adding the nomodeset parameter instructs the kernel to not load video\n  drivers and use BIOS modes instead until X is loaded.\n\n\nA: Recovery mode is a boot method that allows you to perform certain administrative tasks and recover your faulty Ubuntu system. This mode is useful when no session is able to be opened because your hard drives are failing, when the file systems are corrupt or it is impossible to start Ubuntu because a graphical session can not be started (e.g an update of the graphical server no longer supports your old proprietary drivers) or when the password of the primary user account is forgotten. Once you have selected the recovery mode, the root partition is mounted read-only that avoids writing information to your hard disk.\nIt is not only applicable to Ubuntu but to other Linux flavors as well.\nIn the systems using (or used to use) Upstart, when you boot into recovery mode, the init daemon run the scripts in /etc/init/rcS.conf. In addition, if you do not want to see the 'recovery' entrieds in grub menu, you can set the GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY=true in /etc/default/grub\n", "Q: boot problem with linux and windows is their solve to my problem i was used kali and ubuntu and windows 8 but when am install new windows boot menu disappeared and my laptop log into windows automatically all time\n\nA: Boot into a live session, then execute sudo fdisk -l.

We've resolved to just reinstall and cut out losses, not waste anymore time on this.\n\nA: In Ubuntu setup, you cannt set a blank password.

There will be some more work completed in these directories before I can replace the support server, so my tarball will be out of date.\nTo save time, I'd like to unpack the archive into the correct location with all of the correct permissions and ownerships, which I already know how to do, then run the normal rsync command to just update the differences.

To see your disk partition information, use sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda.  \nRather than risking fiddling with disk partitions (although I'll get to that), I suggest that you find out what is using 99% of /boot.  \nSee the question and my answer at this post\nAnd now, how to risk destroying your disk by \"adjusting\" partitions.\nStep 1.  \nMake absolutely sure you have a backup that you can restore. \nStep 2.\nDownload and burn to a USB key a \"GParted Live\" distribution. Google will help you find one.\nStep 3.\nShutdown your system the official way, not by pulling the plug or the vulcan nerve pinch. This will let the system get the filesystems on the disk into stable, up-to-date states.\nStep 4.\nBoot from the GParted Live USB key\nStep 5.\nTell GParted which disk you want to \"fix\". Once it's selected, GParted will show you a picture of the disk layout.  \nStep 6.\nYou can use GParted to resize partitions into adjacent I've had trouble before Free Space, or shrink them (don't go below the size the filesystem thinks is used) to create Free Space.\nYou can use Gparted to move partitions, but cannot change the order. \nGParted will store your intended actions, and do them all at the end, once it gives you a final Go/No-Go choice.\nStep 7.\nAs your penultimate action, tell GParted to run fsck on each and every partition you've touched.\nStep 8.\nIf you are happy with what you have set up (and be sure to check and recheck - are you sure you can restore the backup?) tell Gparted to proceed.\nStep 9.\nWait. Interrupting partition moves, GParted at work, etc leads straight to doorstop mode. (Your disk becomes more useful as a doorstop than connected to a computer).\nStep 10.\nShut down GParted, remove the USB key and reboot.\nStep 11.\nYMMV, not responsible, Linux is a powerful tool, THIS IS RISKY!\n", "Q: Downloading Wine from the Ubuntu Software Center In the Ubuntu Software Center, I attempted to download the application Wine.

But I can't start Windows when UEFI mode is turned on. That means I need to go back to Legacy mode which doesn't have an option to turn off secure boot. I'm confused. \nHow should I proceed?\n\nA: To elaborate a bit on Fabby's answer:\nModern EFI/UEFI-based computers can usually boot either in native EFI/UEFI mode or using a feature called the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which enables them to boot using older BIOS-mode boot loaders. This latter mode is often called \"legacy mode,\" so it has three names: BIOS, CSM, and legacy; all mean the same thing in this context, and are distinct from native EFI/UEFI-mode booting.\nSecure Boot is a UEFI feature that is active only in UEFI-mode booting. Thus, when you activate BIOS/CSM/legacy support, Secure Boot is either automatically deactivated or becomes relevant only for UEFI-mode boots, depending on the design of the firmware.\nIf your computer is booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and refuses to boot when you switch the firmware to EFI/UEFI mode, then that implies that Secure Boot is already disabled, or at least bypassed, for booting Windows. Fabby asked for the output of parted -l, and that output will indicate Windows' boot mode with certainty. Specifically, Windows boots in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode only from MBR-partitioned (aka \"MSDOS\") disks, whereas it boots in EFI/UEFI mode only from GPT-partitioned disks. Thus, the disk type will indicate, with 100% certainty, what the current Windows boot mode is.\nAs a side note, any instructions that tell you to disable Secure Boot as a matter of course are suspect. Ubuntu has long supported Secure Boot, and should install just fine (in EFI/UEFI mode, of course) on most computers with Secure Boot active. Note the word \"most,\" however; there are a few computers on which Ubuntu's Secure Boot support does not work. IMHO, those are best dealt with on a case-by-case basis rather than issuing instructions to disable Secure Boot on all computers.\n\nA: Don't do anything: apparently your Windows isn't installed in UEFI mode.\n(This is the first time on this site I've told someone to not do anything!)\n:-)\n", "Q: Cannot install NIS package I cannot install NIS package on Ubuntu 14.04 (upgrade from 13.10).

They seem to corrupt each other I have a Macbook Pro (mid 2014) and want to run OS X, Windows and Ubuntu.\nI installed Win 8.1 using Bootcamp in the standard way recommended by Apple. I set Windows as the default in Bootcamp, but pressed Option when I wanted OS X.\nI then created a Ubuntu 14 installer flash drive, and installed Ubuntu 14 to another flash drive. I figured I could just boot from the USB when I needed Linux. But the installer also installed GRUB to the Macbook SSD (same happened to a colleague).\nOn the first few boots after this, I could boot with the Ubuntu flash disk in and it would offer a plain text (I assume GRUB) menu, which would enable me to choose between Ubuntu or Windows. If I booted without the flash disk I could hold Option, and could get into OS X.\nThen behaviour changed. If I booted without the flash disk I got the GRUB command line with a flashing cursor. I assume booting into the flash Ubuntu put it there. Typing exit [enter] booted me into Windows. If I booted with the flash disk I got a Ubuntu menu that let me choose between Ubuntu and Windows. But I had lost OS X. I tried holding Option while typing exit into GRUB but it just booted into Windows.\nThen behaviour changed again, possibly when I opened the Windows system tray Bootcamp assistant. Now, booting with Option held down offers the Bootcamp menu, with OS X or Windows. But I have lost Ubuntu on the flash disk!\nCan I get my Macbook to simply boot from USB, like any Windows laptop could, by setting that in the BIOS? I tried holding C, but the Macbook doesn't seem to find the flash disk Ubuntu. Is triple boot possible, with eg, rEFInd? (Sources suggest it is with Bootcamp, too, but not in my experience.) I could re-install Ubuntu - is there a way of doing it without corrupting Bootcamp? How could I avoid losing Ubuntu again?\nIs there some reason why Ubuntu won't co-exist with OS X? Is one EFI but the other not?\nHelp with understanding or diagnosis would be massively appreciated, let alone assistance with a solution.\n\nA: That is rather odd... I've never used rEFInd, but it does seem like it might help. It seems like the boot selector may only scanning the local disk for operating systems, in which case rEFInd would likely solve the problem (it seems worth a shot).\nI triple booted my MacBook a while ago and BootCamp didn't have a problem recognizing my Ubuntu partition (that was around 5 years ago, though - I'm not sure they may've changed).\n\nA: This seems like a much better route to go than the one I was suggesting:  How to triple boot OSX, Linux and Windows 8.1 with a shared Data Partition...\n\nA: I have done both the dual and the triple boot on my late 2011 MBP 8,2. If you wanted to change an OS it was quite an endeavor to do. Spend the fifty bucks and you don't have the headaches with rEFInd or bootcamp, check out VMware Fusion 8, you can install up to five OS's. I don't know if you can run all five at the same time, I do know you can run two well three including OS X, Linux Mint and Win 7 or whatever OS's you like.

The .smbcredentials file contains the user/pass combo for RW access to the share.:\n//NASNAMEHERE/Archive    /home/user/Archive        cifs    credentials=/home/user/.smbcredentials,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 0 0\n\nHowever, when I run sudo mount -a to mount the new device, it gives me this.\nmount error: could not resolve address for martinez-nas: Unknown error\n\nIt seems to be a networking issue, as I can't seem to ping the NAS by name directly, but I'm confused about why this won't work, if smbclient can properly find the NAS and list the shares.\nRunning Ubuntu Server 14.04.2\n\nA: Found this question which answers it for me. Basically, Samba can do hostname lookups, while mount can't. I set the IP address instead of the hostname in /etc/fstab, and it worked like a charm.\n\nA: The difference is the samba client does netbios name lookups while mount.cifs does host name lookups which requires some kind of lan-side DNS mechanism. CIFS has no idea what a netbios name is. \nThere are some solutions:\n[1] Some routers provide that lan side DNS mechanism automatically. That's why only a subset of CIFS users experience this name resolution problem. Perhaps your router does this but it is not enabled - it's worth investigating.\n[2] You could give your nas a static ip address. This can also be done on the router if you don't want to do it on the nas itself. Then just access the server by that ip address.\n[3] You could use an mDNS qualified host name ( hostname.local ) if your nas has one. Currently Linux, Win10 ( you have to enable it ), Apple Macs, and these network devices designed to work with Macs all have these host names. If you know the current IP address of the nas you can use this command ( with the correct ip address ) to see if it has one:\navahi-resolve -a 192.168.1.208\n\nUse the name from that output and attach a .local at the end if it doesn't already have that.\n[4] And lastly is the much misunderstood and misinterpreted winbind \"gimmick\":\nIf an application wants to resolve the ip address of a host name it looks to /etc/nsswitch.conf file to know how. If you look at the file you will see the different ways it does that: \"files\" ( /etc/hosts ), \"mdns4\" ( mDNS ), and \"dns\" itself. Nowhere in there is any reference to netbios. So add it by placing the parameter wins before the parameter dns.\nwins in turn needs the libnss_wins.so library and you get that when you install the following package:\nsudo apt install libnss-winbind\n\nInstalling that package also installs winbind itself.\nSo you end up installing something ( winbind ) designed for something completely different in order to make a netbios name appear as a host name to things like CIFS and ping. Back in the day this \"solution\" had consequences as it sometimes slowed down internet access but given the relative speed increases over the years I'm guessing no one would notice.\n", "Q: Trying to get two websites on one server and ip Ok I've been looking around for a while and I'm pretty sure I have the virtualhost file configured properly.\n<VirtualHost *:80>\nServerName example.com\nRedirect permanent http://www.example.com/ /\n\nServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\nDocumentRoot /var/www/html/example\n\n\nErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log\nCustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined\n\nScriptAlias /cgi/ /var/www/html/cgi-bin/\n\n<Directory /var/www/html/cgi-bin/>\n    Options ExecCGI\n    AddHandler cgi-script .py\n</Directory>\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\nServerName example.net\nRedirect permanent http://www.example.net/ /\n\nServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\nDocumentRoot /var/www/html/example\n\nErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log\nCustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\nServerName test.com\nRedirect permanent http://www.test.com/ /\n\nServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\nDocumentRoot /var/www/html/test\n\nErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log\nCustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined\n</VirtualHost>\n\n# vim: syntax=apache ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 sr noet\n\nThis is one .conf file.

Then I logged out and rebooted.  Login shells (e.g., virtual TTYs and SSH) now start fish.\nAnd yet, when I start a terminal with either gnome-terminal or urxvt, a bash session is started.  Additionally, the SHELL variable is still set to /bin/bash.\nInterestingly, Terminator does use fish as the default shell.  But even in that session SHELL is set to /bin/bash.

I still see a few failures per hour in auth.log before they get blocked with fail2ban. \nWell-designed services will log authentication failures with the syslog auth facility and would be logged here as well.

Would separate disk drive(s) be of use? Which OS runs the hardware (WIN Licence issues)? I'm sure some people have come across a similar situation. Thanks.\nEdit:\nTo Run an OS or multiple OS's on a current host operating system (pref: Ubuntu) Using existing partitions on the same disk drive, or possibly use separate drives and set up something like a 'desktop server' OS - I was thinking using Debian for that. Would a version of Apache assist? Is there a way of using view ports to achieve the result of using an existing guest OS(s) from within a host machine with the 'guest' already installed on a separate partition, that is not reinstalling the 'guest' but running it from the partition where it is currently installed. \nApologies, Is this better explained? It comes from the situation of having to re-boot a dual booted machine, get's a little tedious. Thanks.\nEdit: I contacted a systems consultant who recommended Xenserver to run multiple OS's of a single computer. I'm going to have a look at that software, see how it goes.\n\nA: Yes, but there are things you should be aware of. At least in the past, switching hardware for Windows has caused issues. That means you'd either always run Windows virtualized or always on metal. However, this is very rarely an issue with Ubuntu. I don't know what the situation is with Windows 10. \nSo what you can do, is to have Windows on one drive and Ubuntu on another. Then you can create a VirtualBox VM definition that uses the Ubuntu drive directly as a raw device. That way you can choose whether to boot it on metal or as a virtual machine while running Windows. However, you must not boot the VM while Ubuntu is running, or you'll break your system. \nI've always done this with separate physical disks and it works quite well. I'm not sure if it's possible to do the same using different partitions on the same disk, but I wouldn't recommend it, or at least you should investigate it thoroughly before you make an attempt. Having two OSs accessing the disk directly at the same time is a very bad idea. \n\nA: I am not sure exactly what you are asking so this may not be responsive, but it is certainly possible to run Windows in a virtual machine on an Ubuntu computer, or Ubuntu in a virtual machine on a Windows computer, or Ubuntu in a virtual machine on an Ubuntu computer, etc, etc.  \nYou do not need to repartition to run virtual machines.  Nor are separate disk drives required (but they are not ruled out).\nThe \"host\" i.e. physical machine runs on the hardware.  Licensing is still required in the \"guest\", i.e. virtual machine to the same extent that it would be in a physical machine.  In other words, to have a fully operational Windows installation you need to jump through the same Windows verification hoops that you do on a physical machine.\n", "Q: Problem with compiling C++ program I'm using linux live image.

While using Ubuntu I notice some things about installing software. I've read some installation guides about installing software, and been curious about two things: the first thing is the dependencies and the second one is the repositories.\nI've search over the internet, and by definition I found this:\n\n\n*\n\n*A dependency is a file that something you are trying to install requires.\n\n*A software repository is a storage location from which software packages are retrieved for installation. \n\n\nBut still I do have some questions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Do I really need this two things as always? Why?\n\n*How can I identify which and what repositories and dependencies to use?\n\n*What things must I remember before installing dependencies and repositories?\n\n*Is there a good book to read about these two things?\n\n*Another option to deal with aside from using terminal? Should I use software center?\n\n\nA: Repositories serve several purpose :\n\n\n*\n\n*every program from an \"official\" repository has been validated by canonical. It is thus considered safe for your system (not a malware).\n\n*repositories allow to notify users when an update is ready. Your system is automatically up to date with new features and security releases.\nTo answer your questions :\n\n\n*\n\n*Not necessarily. For instance, a .deb file can be installed without a repository (just download the file, and use dpkg -i file.deb to install it)\n\n*You can read the official documentation about this. There are default repositories from canonical, but you can also add custom repositories if you need some other resources. Dependencies are shown automatically when you try to install a package.\n\n*If you are invoking the update manager from the terminal, be careful about which options you use. For instance, apt-get update and apt-get upgrade are fairly harmless, but option like apt-get dist-upgrade or apt-get autoremove can break your distro in some occasions.\nAlso, always run apt-get update before upgrading your system or after you modified your repositories information.\n\n*I don't know of any. I learnt from reading the official documentation & practice.\n\n*All package managers do about the same thing, the interface and some functionalities change. Have a look at this question for more details about the differences between them.\n\n", "Q: apt-get: error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.6: \ncannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nThis started after rebooting the server (sudo reboot).

Can someone please please give me some directions?\n\nA: I was finally able to resolve the issue by simply copying libstdc++.so.6.0.19 from another installation and simply placing it in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu folder.  Right after that everything went back to normal.  I am still curious as to why a simple reboot would result in this nightmare.\n", "Q: How can I run a program on startup, minimized? I just want Telegram to be run and I have added it to startup apps. The point is that I need it to be minimized. Any commands?\n\nA: It's good to have the scripts given by user72216 and Sergey as general solutions to the problem, but sometimes the application you wish to startup minimized already has a switch that will do what you want.\nHere are a few examples with the corresponding startup program command strings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Telegram (since version 0.7.10) has the -startintray option: <path-to-Telegram>/Telegram -startintray\n\n*Steam has the -silent option: /usr/bin/steam %U -silent\n\n*Transmission has the --minimized option: /usr/bin/transmission-gtk --minimized\nIn Unity these applications start minimized as icons in the top menu bar rather than as icons on the launcher, though the normal launch icon will still appear once you start using the application. Other applications may behave differently.\n\nA: Starting an application minimized\nStarting up an application in a minimized way takes two commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*starting the application\n\n*minimize its window\n\n\nTherefore, the command or script needs to be \"smart\"; the second command should wait for the application window to actually appear.\nGeneral solution to startup an application minimized\nThe script below does that and can be used as a general solution to startup an application in a minimized way. Just run it in the syntax:\n<script> <command_to_run_the_application> <window_name>\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\nimport time\n\nsubprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", sys.argv[1]])\nwindowname = sys.argv[2]\n\ndef read_wlist(w_name):\n    try:\n        l = subprocess.check_output([\"wmctrl\", \"-l\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()\n        return [w.split()[0] for w in l if w_name in w][0]\n    except (IndexError, subprocess.CalledProcessError):\n        return None\n\nt = 0\nwhile t < 30:\n    window = read_wlist(windowname)\n    time.sleep(0.1)\n    if window != None:\n        subprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"windowminimize\", window])\n        break\n    time.sleep(1)\n    t += 1\n\nHow to use\nThe script needs both wmctrl and xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl xdotool\n\nThen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as startup_minimizd.py\n\n*Test- run the script with (e.g.) gedit the command:\npython3 /path/to/startup_minimizd.py gedit gedit\n\n\n*If all works fine, add the command (for your application) to Startup Applications\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*The script starts up the application, running the command you gave as first argument\n\n*Then the script checks the window list (with the help of wmctrl) for windows, named after your second argument.\n\n*If the window appears, it is immediately minimized with the help of xdotool\nTo prevent an endless loop if the window might not appear for some reason, the script practices a time limit of 30 seconds for the window to appear.\n\n\nNote\nNo need to mention that you can use the script for multiple applications at once, since you run it with arguments outside the script.\n\nEDIT\nrecognizing the window by its pid\nIf the window title is unsure or variable, or there is a risk of name clashes in the window's name, using the pid is a more reliable method to use. \nThe script below is based on the use of the application's pid, as in the output of both wmctrl -lp and ps -ef.\nThe setup is pretty much the same, but the window title is not needed in this version, so the command to run it is:\npython3 /path/to/startup_minimizd.py <command_to_run_application>\n\nJust like the first script, it needs both wmctrl and xdotool\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\nimport time\n\ncommand = sys.argv[1]\ncommand_check = command.split(\"/\")[-1]\n\nsubprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n\nt = 1\nwhile t < 30:\n    try:\n        w_list = [l.split() for l in subprocess.check_output([\"wmctrl\", \"-lp\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()]\n        proc = subprocess.check_output([\"pgrep\", \"-f\", command_check]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip().split()\n        match = sum([[l[0] for l in w_list if p in l] for p in proc], [])\n        subprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"windowminimize\", match[0]])\n        break\n    except (IndexError, subprocess.CalledProcessError):\n        pass\n    t += 1\n    time.sleep(1)\n\nNote on the second script\nAlthough in general the second version should be more reliable, in cases when the application is started by a wrapper script, the pid of the command will be different from the application that is finally called. \nIn such cases, I recommend using the first script.\n\n\nEDIT2 a specific version of the script for Steam\nAs requested in a comment, below a version, specifically made for starting up STEAM minimized.\nWhy a specific version for Steam?\nIt turns out Steam behaves quite different from a \"normal\" application:\n\n\n*\n\n*It turns out Steam does not run one pid, but no less then (in my test) eight!\n\n*Steam runs on start up with at least two windows (one splash- like window), but sometimes an additional message window appears.\n\n*Windows of Steam have pid 0, which is a problem in the script as it was.\n\n*After the main window is created, the window is raised a second time after a second or so, so a single minimization won't do.\n\n\nThis exceptional behaviour of Steam asks for a special version of the script, which is added below. The script starts up Steam, and during 12 seconds, it keeps an eye on all new windows of the corresponding WM_CLASS, checking if they are minimized. If not, the script makes sure they will be.\nLike the original script, this one needs wmctrl and xdotool to be installed.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\ncommand = \"steam\"\nsubprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n\ndef get(cmd):\n    return subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n\nt = 0\n\nwhile t < 12:\n    try:\n        w_list = [l.split()[0] for l in get([\"wmctrl\", \"-l\"]).splitlines()]\n        for w in w_list:\n            data = get([\"xprop\", \"-id\", w])\n            if all([\"Steam\" in data, not \"_NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN\" in data]):\n                subprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"windowminimize\", w])\n    except (IndexError, subprocess.CalledProcessError):\n        pass\n\n    t += 1\n    time.sleep(1)\n\nTo use it\n\n\n*\n\n*Simply copy it into an empty file, save it as runsteam_minimized.py\n\n*Run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/runsteam_minimized.py\n\n\nA: I needed the programs closed to tray, not minimized, and I've tried all the scripts posted here, the ones that worked, worked only for some programs and not for others. So I've coded one that works much better (you almost don't see the window appearing, only the tray icon, it looks native) and works for all the programs I've tried. It's based on the Jacob's one. With this script you may need to add an argument depending on the program (see below) but always worked for me with lots of programs it should also work with steam.\nUsage:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install wmctrl xdotool\n\n*Save the script as startup_closed.py give it execution permissions and then execute python3 ./startup_closed.py -c <command to open program>\n\n*If the program tray icon does not show or the window does not show then you need to add one of these arguments: -splash or -hide, by trial and error. For example: python3 ./startup_closed.py -hide -c teamviewer or python3 ./startup_closed.py -splash -c slack\n\n*There are more arguments but you probably don't need them.

One example of such program is Viber. In this case one could use following script start_closed.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Check that there is only one input argument\nif [[ $# -gt 1 ]]; then\necho \"Usage: $0 <program-to-start>\"\nexit 1\nfi\n\n$1 &                               # Start program passed in first argument\npid=$!                             # Get PID of last started program\nxdotool search --sync --pid $pid | # Wait for window with PID to appear...\nxargs wmctrl -i -c                 # ...and close it\n\nUsage: <path-to-script> <program-to-start>\n\nA: I came with a rather elegant solution that relies exclusively on xdotool, and it's quite useful for applications that don't have a \"start minimized\" argument, like Telegram.\nThe only downside is that solution has to be manually crafted for each app, but assuming that's not a problem (e.g.: if you want to autostart a certain application without allowing it to pollute your screen after logging in), this is much simpler and straightforward.\nActual Examples\n## Starts Telegram and immediately closes it\nxdotool search --sync --onlyvisible --name '^Telegram$' windowclose &\ntelegram-desktop &\n\n## Starts WhatsApp and immediately closes it\nxdotool search --sync --onlyvisible --name '(\\([0-9]*\\) ){0,1}(WhatsApp$|WhatsApp Web$)' windowclose &\nwhatsapp-nativefier &\n\nThe  Solution\n\nAt first glance, you might think it's better to use the process' PID or class to match against, however that's actually counterproductive as you frequently will get multiple results for the same PID. Examples are a 0x0 window that's actually waiting for a notification, a systray icon, or any other \"hidden\" window.\n\nThe solution is crafting a xdotool command that always returns only one unique window. In both my examples that was done using --name, however you can combine multiple selectors with --all (e.g.: match a given classname + a class name + a name regex). Usually a good --name regex  does the trick.\nAfter crafting your search conditions, simply spawn a instance of xdotool (detached from the shell) with the --sync parameter and your conditions, followed by windowclose. Run your app afterwards:\nxdotool search --sync [... myapp-match-conditions] windowclose &\nmy-app\n\n\nCheck out xdotool search --help for all the possibilities of combinations you can arrange to be able to target the exact window you want. Sometimes it gets tricky and you have to combine several conditions, but once your finished, it'll rarely ever fail (unless an update changes the application and break your implementation, of course).\n\n\nA: I took Jacob's scripts and modified them a bit to make a more universal one.\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\nimport time\nimport signal\n\nWAIT_TIME = 10\n\n\ndef check_exist(name):\n    return subprocess.Popen(\"which \"+name,\n                            shell=True,\n                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE\n                            ).stdout.read().rstrip(\"-n\")\n\n\ndef killpid(pidlist):\n    for pid in pidlist:\n        args = [\"xdotool\",\n                \"search\",\n                \"--any\",\n                \"--pid\",\n                pid,\n                \"--name\",\n                \"notarealprogramname\",\n                \"windowunmap\",\n                \"--sync\",\n                \"%@\"]\n        subprocess.Popen(args)\n\n\ndef killname(name):\n    args = [\"xdotool\",\n            \"search\",\n            \"--any\",\n            \"--name\",\n            \"--class\",\n            \"--classname\",\n            name,\n            \"windowunmap\",\n            \"--sync\",\n            \"%@\"]\n    subprocess.Popen(args)\n\n\nsys.argv.pop(0)\n\nif check_exist(sys.argv[0]) == \"\":\n    sys.exit(1)\nif check_exist(\"xdotool\") == \"\":\n    sys.stderr.write(\"xdotool is not installed\\n\")\n    sys.exit(1)\nif check_exist(\"wmctrl\") == \"\":\n    sys.stderr.write(\"wmctrl is not installed\\n\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\ntry:\n    prog = subprocess.Popen(sys.argv, preexec_fn=os.setsid)\nexcept OSError, e:\n    sys.exit(1)\n\ntime.sleep(WAIT_TIME)\nidlist = subprocess.Popen(\"pgrep -g \" + str(prog.pid),\n                          shell=True,\n                          stdout=subprocess.PIPE\n                          ).stdout.read().splitlines()\n\nps1 = os.fork()\nif ps1 > 0:\n    ps2 = os.fork()\n\nif ps1 == 0:  # Child 1\n    os.setpgid(os.getpid(), os.getpid())\n    killpid(idlist)\n    sys.exit(0)\nelif ps2 == 0:  # Child 2\n    killname(os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]))\n    sys.exit(0)\nelif ps1 > 0 and ps2 > 0:  # Parent\n    time.sleep(WAIT_TIME)\n    os.killpg(os.getpgid(int(ps1)), signal.SIGTERM)\n    os.kill(ps2, signal.SIGTERM)\n    os.waitpid(ps1, 0)\n    os.waitpid(ps2, 0)\n    sys.exit(0)\nelse:\n    exit(1)\n\nMain differences are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Program sets group ID (GID) for the process.

Any solution for it or there is any problem with the driver?\n\nA: There are two main possibilities:\nFirst, your wifi could really be disabled by hardware switch. You may notice that there is a switch on your computer that has a signal station (meaning wifi) on it. If that is the problem, then you may have to turn it on. But you said that it works fine on Win 8, then it may not be this one.\nSecond, the system (Ubuntu) may not recognize the wifi card status, or the card may not be supported. A recommended way to solve this is to search drivers of your wifi card on Ubuntu.\n\nA: If your laptop does not have a hardware wireless switch, then you can fixed it by\nsudo modprobe -r ideapad_laptop\n\nThis will unlock wireless until you reboot.\nIf this helps, I suggest reporting a bug by running\nubuntu-bug linux\n\nFollow the directions and post the bug link to comments.

I'm not sure where I did it right, & if it has no side effect... so I don't advise anyone having similar issue to follow what I just out-laid.\nHowever, you could keep exploring till you a get a fix. Document it, so in future you know exactly how you handled it in the past.\n", "Q: shortening the output from the command ps efo cmd | grep I want to condition on whether or not a certain process is running.     The process has a very long description, more or less like\n/usr/bin/xpdf -remote myXpdfServer -title Bayes2_notes -papercolor cornsilk -geometry 1910x1019+0+29 /home/simon/research/Ward/Bayes2_notes.pdf\n\nI sometimes have to use an xterm with a small # of columns, say n.   In this case,if I run ps -ef then grep for some element far out in the tail of this string, ps truncates the string, returning only the first n characters, and my grep command fails.\nTo fix this, I've tried ps efo cmd | grep etc etc.    This helps some but\nnot as much as I like.    For example the obvious command to try:\nps eco cmd | grep xpdf | grep -v grep\n\nreturns the following:\n|..................................\\_ /usr/bin/xpdf -remote myXpdfServer\nwhere those dots denote whitespace which doesn't show up on this forum. I'd very much like to get rid of the garbage, especially the whitespace, at the beginning, i.e., everything that precedes /usr.    Note that piping to cut or sed or something else won't help in this case: the length of the string returned by ps is determined by the number of xterm columns, so shortening this string by post-processing can't help me, because the string I need to examine  has already been truncated by the time that cut gets to do its thing.     I'm sure the only way to do what I want to do is to add some other flag to the ps ef command.\nThanks very much for any advice!\n\nA: ps -ww provides unlimited width output. You can grep for as much of your command line as you like. If you prefix your string to match with [ ] then grep will not match itself. If you add -q to grep there is no output but you can use the return code: it will be 0 if found, 1 otherwise. So\nif ps alxww | grep -q '[ ]/usr/bin/xpdf -remote myXpdfServer -title Bayes2_notes -papercolor cornsilk -geometry 1910x1019+0+29 /home/simon/research/Ward/Bayes2_notes.pdf'\nthen echo running\nelse echo not\nfi\n\n\ngrep in fact matches patterns, not exact strings. In a pattern there are \"magic\" characters that do not stand for themselves. Fortunately, the command line string you are grepping for has no magic characters, so your pattern just matches exactly the string. Some magic chars are [, *, ., (, +. In particular the pattern [ ] means match the space character. So it is an apparently pointless pattern because it is just the same as a space on its own: \" \".  \nBut as you know, doing a ps|grep string will find the grep command as well as the command we are interested in. But by using [ ], grep will no longer match its own command because in the output from ps there will be the 3 chars \"[ ]\" and not the single char \" \", so the pattern (1 space) will not match.\nIt's a bit hard to understand. You can read about patterns, which are called regular expressions, in man grep. They are incredibly useful.\n\nWhen you do isRunning=$(ps -ef | grep -q '[ ]xpdf ') your variable is set to an empty string because grep -q produces no output. The return code of the last command run by the shell is available in the shell variable $?. It will be 0 for true, i.e. the grep matched, or non-zero (usually 1) otherwise.  The value to expect is shown in the EXIT STATUS section of  man grep.\nSo if you want to hold on to the result you can do, eg:\nps -ef | grep -q '[ ]xpdf '\nisRunning=$?\nif [ $isRunning = 0 ]\nthen echo \"running. isRunning=$isRunning\"\nelse echo \"not. isRunning=$isRunning\"\nfi\n\n\nA: \nI want to condition on whether or not a certain process is running.\n\nI would use\npidof nameofyourprogram \n\nSee the man page for the exist status for your condition.\n", "Q: Problems with unzipping openfire_3_10_2.tar.gz While installing openfire got an error with unzipping the downloaded file that \ngzip: stdin: not in gzip format\ntar: Child returned status 1\ntar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now\n\nWhen checking file format it shows like\n$ file openfire_3_10_2.tar.gz\nopenfire_3_10_2.tar.gz: HTML document, ASCII text, with very long lines, with CRLF line terminators\n\nHow to resolve this issue?\n\nA: Open this site in your browser and download the Linux version again and don't use wget, the link on the page is a redirection.

Once you\n  do that, restart nautilus and see what happens.\n\n\nA: In my case it was a \"conflict\" betwen versions. I resolved it,then i saw that the bomb icon stayed there,despite there was no more conflicts, so i used \"nautilus -q\" to close all nautilus processes, (i'm using nautilus as files administrator).\n  This should work, rabbitVCS is installed as a plugin on your files administrator, you have to reload it completly to fix it.\n", "Q: Problems Installing ubuntu 14.04 My pc has 2gb of ram.. By mistake I have downloaded Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (64 bit) \nCan I install it on pc with 2 gb of ram and it has intel dual core processor. \n\nA: If you successfully installed a 64-bit version, then your CPU is 64-bit.\nThere is no problem at all.\nBut a 32-bit version may perform better on old Intel CPUs in some cases. Also it will consume less RAM.\nBut if everything works well, there is no need to re-install!\n", "Q: Xubuntu indicator plugin background I'm running Xubuntu 14.04 and my indicator plugin has white background in most themes. It looks like this (Numix).\nBut in Adwaita and High Constrast themes it works properly. Screenshot here.\nQuestion is what fix do I need to perform in order to make Indicator plugin background in Numix transparent like it's done in Adwaita and High Contrast themes?\n\nA: Open terminal and type:sudo vi /usr/share/themes/name/gtk-3.0/apps/xfce.css. You will find something like this:\n.xfce4-panel .button {\n    border-image: none;\n    background-color: #454545;\n    border-color: transparent;\n    border-radius: 0;\n    border-width: 0 1px 0 1px;\n    color: @dark_fg_color;\n    text-shadow: none;\n\nChange 'background-color: #454545;' to 'background-color: transparent;'\nthen logout and login and that's it \nPs, name is the theme name.\n\nA: Well, I removed Indicator plugin from the panel and after xfce4-panel -r most indicators went to Notification area. Unfortunately, sound indicator disappeared, but I solved the problem by installing xfce4-mixer which does the same job, but looks slightly different.\nNow the panel looks smooth.\n", "Q: After an upgrade, Unity system settings are transparent I've upgraded from Ubuntu 14.04 to 15.04 and I now have a problem with my settings.

It's the same problem on each settings page. I've already reboot many times and all updates have been installed.\n\nA: Try to delete this package gnome-settings-daemon using :\nsudo apt-get remove gnome-settings-daemon\n\n", "Q: I deleted my password but sudo keeps asking me for it I've deleted my password using sudo passwd -d alexwolf153. Now even though I have no password anymore sudo still keeps asking for one. What do I do?\nEDIT: thankfully, my terminal with provided sudo privilleges was still open. I ran sudo passwd alexwolf153 <password> and now it's all back like it was before.\n\nA: I had the same problem and this solved it, unfortunately ubuntu can not handle this situation you created. \nYou need to boot to recovery and set a password.\nBoot up the machine, and after the BIOS screen, hold down the left Shift key (note that for UEFI BIOS you might need press ESC instead). You will then be prompted by a menu that looks something like this:\n\nI've noticed on some systems that timing when to hit the left Shift key can be tricky, sometimes I miss it and need to try it again.\nHit the down arrow until you select the 2nd entry from the top (the one with the recovery mode in the description) and then hit Enter.\nNow you should see this menu:\n\nUsing the arrow keys scroll down to root and then hit Enter.\nYou should now see a root prompt, something like this:\nroot@ubuntu:~#\n\nAt this stage you should have a read-only filesystem. You have to remount it with write permissions:\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nNow we can set the user's password with the passwd command. (In this example I will use jorge as the example, you need to substitute whatever the user's username is):\nroot@ubuntu:~# passwd jorge\nEnter new UNIX password:\nRetype new UNIX password:\npasswd: password updated successfully\nroot@ubuntu:~#\n\nType in what you want the new password to be at the prompt. After it's successful reboot the machine and the user will be able to log in with their new password.\nRecovery Mode documentation\nLost password documentation\n\nThere is concern about this being a security vulnerability. It is not. You need to have physical access to the machine to do this. If someone has physical access to your PC, they could do far worse than change a password. When it comes to physical access, the battle for security is lost. Be wary of who you let on your PC.\nEven setting a root password will not be successful, as one can simply boot with init being /bin/sh and have full root access. Again, given physical access, anyone with computer knowledge can do ANYTHING to your computer.\n", "Q: How to increase limits for processes created from fstab? I am using ciopfs in Ubuntu 14.04 to mount a case insensitive version of a game folder which is the target for a wine-based modding program.  Unfortunately, as the modding tool parses through all the files it causes a \"too many open files error\".\nI have traced the fault back to the ciopfs process, which is stuck with the kernel default limits of 1024/4096.  I can get around this by increasing my limits in /etc/security/limits.conf and manually mounting with ciopfs after I log in, but this means the filesystem wont be listed in /etc/fstab and therefore won't be mounted at boot.\nDoes anyone know of a way to circumvent these limits while still using /etc/fstab?\n\nA: Interpose your own mount helper. Edit the 3rd field of the /etc/fstab entry from ciopfs to myciopfs then create the file /sbin/mount.myciopfs and do chmod a+rx on it.  This script will be executed by mount when you manually or automatically mount the entry.  It will pass most of the fstab line options to the script.\nWrite a shell script in the helper file to set a new ulimit and then execute the real mount.ciopfs helper. Eg:\n#!/bin/bash\nulimit -n 5000       # maximum open files\nexec /sbin/mount.ciopfs \"$@\"\n\n", "Q: opt command not working [LLVM] My linking looks broken.

I've been given a WiFi dongle and a task to implement WiFi access point that devices can connect to and use internet trough the ethernet port.\nSo far I've managed to create the access point using hostapd and create a simple bridge interface that uses DHCP from the network behind ethernet port. So far so good, devices can access the internet. This is what my /etc/network/interfaces looks like:\nauto lo br0\n\niface lo inet loopback\n\nallow-hotplug eth0\niface eth0 inet manual\n\nallow-hotplug wlan0\niface wlan0 inet manual\n\niface br0 inet dhcp\n   bridge_ports eth0 wlan0\n   bridge_waitport 0\n\nNote: Network behind the ethernet port is not the internet but a simple private network (192.168.100.0/24) with access to internet. I have no knowledge about that network organization.\nAdditional question: While I was searching trough the internet I found out that I need to do some MAC addresses modifications, using ebtables, because AP is dropping packets form non-authorized sources, which I didn't do. What's confusing me is the fact that everything is working. \nProblem with this approach is that devices that connect to the AP are given addresses from the address space of the network behind the ethernet port. What I need to do is to create private wireless network for those devices.\nI've managed to set up a DHCP server for the AP interface (wlan0) using isc-dhcp-server, but it's not working very well. Devices are assigned with private addresses (network 192.168.42.10 - 192.168.42.50), but in that process DHCPDISCOVER is propagated all the way to the DHCP server in the network behind the ethernet port which creates confusion in the network and bunch of DHCP messages floating around until finally device somehow gets the intended ip address (192.168.42.10). This little knowledge I have says to me that it's happening because DHCPDISCOVER is a broadcast message (on L2 and L3) and br0 is simply forwarding traffic. Correct me if I'm wrong.\nNeedles to say there is no internet access on the connected device. I guess I need to route traffic between wlan0 and eth0 networks, instead of bridging it, do NAT from wlan0 to eth0 and also somehow block DHCP traffic from going outside of private wireless network.\nI do know a little bit of theory about networks from networking course in my school, but absolutely no practical experience. Can someone, please, walk me trough these last steps of setting up my network? Of course any references with detailed explanations are welcome.\n\nA: Most simple must be to get one repeater of wireless that has etherenet connection. I have one \"netgear range extender\" that has ethernet interface.\nThey do not cost much, and you do not need to change anything in the system.\n", "Q: Ethernet-Connection ubuntu with VMware Player I installed VMware Player 7.1.2 on my Windows 7.

Which settings do I have to change. There are a lot of settings (VMware Player Network Adapter, IPv4 Settings and and and...) and I am not a pro ;-)\n\nA: Without further data, the easiest fix is to go into the VM's settings directly, select the virtual network adapter, and edit it so that it is using NAT.\nThis will let it communicate outbound via the host computer's connections which are already active.

[Y/n/q/?] y\n\n\nA: Do you really need the 3 version?  4.8 is the current one on my trusty system.  If you have an old executable referring to such an old version, try just adding a link to the 4 version.  That might work, unless the old exe is using obsolete functions.  \nAssuming you really need the 3 library, maybe one way is to install the 32 bit versions to avoid conflict with the 64 bit versions of the library.  \nTry looking at the still supported 12.04.5 release to see which version it uses, but assume it's at 4 too.  Any release with the 3 fortran as standard will not be currently supported.  \nYou could remove the conflicting package (probably a few), try installing the lib3, see what new complaints are made, delete those, until finally there are no conflicts. Then you would need to supply sources for the required versions, getting messy here, then if you can successfully get things consistent, freeze it so no further updates will happen on those packages.  Certainly not your desired standard install.  \nThe best approach I can see is to treat the lib3 stuff as a cross compiler.  Install what you need locally, and don't touch the regular system.\n", "Q: Is “Ubuntu Server 14.04.3 LTS + LAMP” production-ready? Installing a fresh copy of Ubuntu Server 14.04.3 LTS and then:\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get upgrade\n$ sudo apt-get install lamp-server^\n\nIs this configuration production-ready in terms of security and stability?\n\nA: You need to do 2 things yourself.\n\n\n*\n\n*configure Apache to your personal requirements. Apache comes with a webpage that shows \"ItWorks!\" so you need to set up at least 1 virtual host in ./sites-enabled/\n\n*configure MySQL to your personal requirements. MySQL has no user databases so you need to set this up. \n\n\nBoth could be a problem regarding security: if you mess up the virtual host it is possible to exploit your machine.\nBut when it comes to this setup being secure and stable out of the box the answer is a plain \"yes\". \n\nA: No. Make sure to use dist-upgrade so that you get the latest kernel. And reboot after the kernel upgrade. Then set something up to continue to receive security updates and reboots after kernel updates, for example the unattended-upgrades package. For stability, you still need to add monitoring and backup solutions, as well as deployment reproducibility and upgrade testing.\n\nA: No. Your application and its usage will determine whether or not it is stable. If your application is more than simple website with a small memory requirement then you may need to tweak your apache2, mysql and php settings to get it stable e.g. increase php memory, apache2 processes, install a cache etc \n\nA: I did participate in a project where Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS, LAMP and  Joomla was used.

I am thrown into the initramfs prompt without any errors. What did I miss?\n\nA: I went through almost same steps, just to change to size of the default /boot partition. I gave up and modified the parameters of the default installer. If you are also only trying to have a separate /home partition, take a look at this: https://askubuntu.com/a/678074/313386.\nYou can change the default recipe to include a /home partition.

There are a few that have a few problems, but that probably will not matter if I switch over to a different OS.\n\nA: Okay, first things first. The 10 refurbished laptops. If they work, don't mess with them. Most people will know Windows better, and using Windows will be better for them. I'm not saying Ubuntu is bad, simply Windows will probably be more familiar. Windows 7 isn't a bas OS - and if you can get the free Windows 10 update, even better.\nThe wireless printer - we need to know the brand. Some it is easy to get working, others less so. Essentially, this guide is what you need.\nFinally, MS Office 360 won't run on Ubuntu - Microsoft only provide Windows and OSX installation programs. Depending on what you are doing, Libre Office should fulfil your needs - it has all the basic programs and comes pre-installed on Ubuntu releases\nAlternatively, to avoid compatibility issues you can use MS Office online.\nThe issues with the computers may not fix themselves with a new OS. We need to know what you are hoping to solve - and maybe ask over on Super User, one of our sister sites for Windows questions. Also, if you can get the aforementioned Windows 10 for free, that may fix the issues.\nNow, if you do decide to go for Ubuntu, I'd reccomend 14.04. It's what I'm writing this on, it's a stable release and it's supported for 5 years in total - until April 2019.\nFor an easy to follow install guide, this question and answer is your friend, and if you encounter any issues then pop back here and ask a new question!\nWhile Ubuntu (which by default uses a \"Display Manager\" called Unity) isn't a lightweight OS, it doesn't need much to run well. I can put up with it on a PC with 1 GB of RAM, but I'd advise 2 or even 4 GB.\nIf you have less than 2 GB of RAM, or an old processor, consider using Xubuntu or for less that 1 GB Lubuntu may be better. I'd suggest reading this answer - it explains why it would be slow, and what you can do to speed it up. That said, anything that run Windows 7 acceptably should be fine with Ubuntu!\nGood luck with your project, and remember to ask another question if you have any specific issues, or comment here and I'll do my best to help.\n", "Q: Adding Skype to start-up programs I use the command below to automatically open and sign in Skype from a terminal:\n$echo myusername mypassword | skype --pipelogin\n\nBut when I put the exact command in Startup Apllications...nothing happens when I login in to Ubuntu (Unity).\nWhat could be the problem?\n\nA: In SkyPe Beta, there is an option to launch at login\nTools > Launch at Login\n\n\nA: To make Skype auto-login when it starts launch Skype, then login with the automatic login tick box selected (I have highlighted the bit which you will need to tick in the bottom right hand corner):\n\nAfter you have completed that part, you can then do as @Harris  says to make Skype launch automatically when you login:\nMove your skype.desktop file into your autostart folder with:\ncp /usr/share/applications/skype.desktop ~/.config/autostart/\n\nAnd you shouldn't need to make the skype.desktop file executable for it to work.\n\nA: My solution is the following.

The developers based some features on already existing packages. This saves time, money and (indirectly) storage space.\nImagine if you installed 5 programs, each requiring a different program to the others that does the same thing. That's maybe 50MB when it could have been 10.\nIn this case, none of the \"extras\" have been installed before, and so you have to install them all.\nIn total, the programs that don't have \"gnucash\" in the name are 86 MB - so the 3 programs gnucash, gnucash-common, and gnucash-docs are together about 185 MB.

One of the most useful rsync flags I have found is -F which simply allows you to place such lists of exclude file-patterns anywhere in your source tree.\nFor example, I have many directories where there are C files I want to backup but not the objects, or git directories where I don't want the .git backed up, etc.  In any directory I can place a file .rsync-filter which holds patterns, just like --exclude, for that directory (and all sub-directories as usual depending on your pattern).  rsync -F will look for these files and obey the exclusion (or inclusion) rules in them. \nThe filter rules are a bit hard to master, but if you stick to simple cases, and always test with a -nv you can trim down your backups to something small and useful.\n", "Q: control brightness on pc I want to control brightness on pc.

I am clueless about the cause behind this.\nPlease write an explanation for this and also suggest the remedy. thanks\nI am using UBUNTU 14.10.\nEDIT- I have tried to remove the escape sequence for white color foreground by setting the alias for ls as:\nalias ls='ls --color=auto |sed -r 's/\\x1b[37m]//''\n\nBut, this has a problem too, the ls outputs all the directory names and filenames with single color ,i.e not with the default colors for all items.This is strange as I have removed just the [37m which is the white foreground but it removes all the colors.\n\nA: Commands which set colours may finish by sending the sequence ESC [ 0 m to reset the current attributes for the terminal.  The easiest thing for you to do is change your shell prompt to always set the colour back to what you want.\nAdd to your .bash_profile:\nexport PS1='\\e[1;31m'\"$PS1\"\n\n\nA: UPDATE- As waltinator says executing bash command right after ls command will create child shell which will probably eat up resources , I had to look for another solution. I tried executing echo -ne '\\e[1;31m' light after ls command therefore I put it in the bls funciton.\nI somehow reached to my own solution to this problem. The suggestions by meuh and waltinator were to look for escape sequences sent by ls command and I even found out those. I tried to remove escape sequence by using sed but due to my inexperience at this I was not able to use it perfectly perhaps.\nLater,I noticed that executing bash after ls command reverts the foreground back to the color I wanted.I decided against using bash after ls\nMeanwhile , I found a way as :\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all I put the command echo -ne '\\e[0;31m' in a shell script and add the shell script to .bashrc.\n\n*Second, I defined a function so that bash would be executed right after ls as :\n\n\n\nbls( ) {\n ls \"$@\" && echo -ne '\\e[1;31m';\n }\n\n\n\n\n*I exported the above function as :\nexport -f bls\nSo, Now I have to do a bls for listing directories and not changing the foreground color. This didn't actually solve the ls problem but it did find me another way. I just have to type one more letter in bls\n", "Q: How to put a box around something in GIMP? This is a very simply question, but one that I have been struggling to find an answer to: How can I put a box outline around something in GIMP? So that you can easily circle (but with a rectangle or square and not a circle) something in an image that you want to point out to someone. Or is there a better tool which would easily allow it without lots of manual drawing if it cannot easily be done in GIMP? When on Windows I would use Paint for this as I could not find an option in GIMP, but now in Ubuntu I can't find anything else to do it in.\n\nA: Create new layer.\nRectangle select for outer wall of rectangle.\nBucket fill that rectangle or paste a texture if you want to use a texture for your outline.\nEdit shrink selection by the width you want for your rectangle.\nCut.\nRight click on the layer and merge the layer down.  \n\nA: I have a simple solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the Pencil tool\n\n\n*Click on your image\n\n\n*Press Shift and hold and press Ctrl and hold for the steps below\n\n*Move your mouse and click\n\n*Move and click again to complete your rectangle\n\n\nA: Select the area you would like to outline with the rectangle select tool.\n\ngo to Edit > Stroke Selection.\n\nYou will get a dialogue. Choosing Solid Line will create an outline using the currently selected foreground color. Choosing Stroke with a Paint Tool will give you more creativity.\n\n\nA: You have answers for gimp, but \nI also find gimp a bit hard work for this sort of thing. I don't have windows so I don't know what its Paint is like, but I can recommend the very simple and old xpaint, the even simpler gnome version gpaint, or my favourite for over 10 years (and more sophisticated), xfig, all in ubuntu.\n\nA: A GIMP Alternate:\nA simple tool for drawing rectangles and ellipses on pictures is already included in Ubuntu\nLibreOffice:Draw\n\n*\n\n*Open the image in LibreOffice Draw. You can do this by first opening\nDraw and then opening the image in it. Or you can right click on the\nimage and choose Open with > Other Applications > Show other\napplications.\n\n*Look for Basic Shapes in the left hand tool bar and click the\ndown arrow next to it. See Step 2 in the picture below:\n\n\n\n\n*Select Frame or Ring shape. You can reduce the width of the\nring and squish to to an ellipse if you want.\n\nHope this helps\n\nA: Select Filters > Render > Gfig... From there you can draw boxes and other shapes boxes in various styles.\n\nA: A different tool that I use a lot for this purpose is Flameshot. It is very handy when you want to take a screenshot of something, then mark, annotate, blur, point to stuff, etc.\n\nBasically, we use Right-Click to pick colors, and Ctrl+Mouse_Wheel to increase and decrease stroke width.

I installed webmin to control my website better than command lines and also to not install desktop for perfomance. \nAs I could understand what DNS is, how can I configure my server as a DNS server using BIND DNS server?

And how can I set a DNS server without a domain? \nI got a registered domain but I don't know where to point it without DNS server and how to set a DNS server without a linked domain to the server? o.O \nI'm confused, please help.\n\nA: If I understand correctly you have a Ubuntu machine being hosted for you by some company. \nIf so you have a web address of some sort to find that machine. Maybe its 123.456.78.90 or maybe its http://abdel.saad.hosting-company.com.\nWhat is the address of your server, either the number or the FQDN.\nA DNS server is like a phonebook it links google.com to 216.58.192.4. However domain names (at least good ones) aren't free. IF you want to buy abdelrahman.net you have to pay a registrar like namecheap or godaddy or ....\nThen you like the EXTERNAL ip address to the new purchased domain. You don't use your personal DNS to map your machines public internet facing ip to a domain, thats what someone like google DNS or opendns does. \nWebmin will use a port number by default it is 10000. That means that webmin is looking for a connection to the server it is installed on at port 10000. \nThe kind of DNS server you referenced are more for internal networks behind NAT.\nANSWER: go to http://'your_ip>':10000\nGo to namecheap.com, buy a domain. In the dns section put in the ip address of that server. That will \"link\" the domain to the ip.\n", "Q: Integrate Java into Eclipse I just downloaded an Eclipse mirror (Kepler) for C/C++ developers. My question is how I could integrate Java into Eclipse.

Now you can remove the file /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf in order to disable auto-login for your user again.\n\n*You must first stop lightdm using the command:\nservice lightdm stop\n\nthen you must use the following command to start an x-session manually:\nsu - YOUR_USERNAME \"startx -- :0 vt7\" &\n\nthis command starts a new x-session logged in with your username on tty7, the default tty for lightdm. the & sign at the end detaches this process.\nNote 1: if you receive an error saying \n\nX: user not authorized to run the X server, aborting.\n\nyou must edit the file located at /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config and set allowed_users to anybody. After the start of the x-session you can return it to the previous value(normally console) for security reasons.\nNote 2: If your x-session is showing only the desktop and not the unity panels, try removing files .config and .cache located at home folder of your user. \nIf you know any better ways or some improvement you might think is useful please share it here.

I made a windows 7 installation USB to try to at least get him back on to use the laptop.

I wrote a guide on how to install 14.04 with UEFI boot here: How to install Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit with a dual-boot RAID 1 partition on an UEFI/GPT system?. You should be able to use the guide, ignoring the RAID stuff (everything referring to mdadm/RAID).\n\nA: There are several issues here ..\n\nDo you really want to install Windows 10?\nThis needs to be activated, and so needs to be either a 'free upgrade' from Windows 7 or 8.1 (and already activated) or you need a full retail install license for Windows 10.\nAlso, for best results, any upgrade needs to overwritten (once activated) by a fresh install of Windows 10.\nYour laptop is crippled by its hard-drive.\nStrongly recommend replacing with (at very least) 7200 rpm or better SSHD (or SSD) drive.\nYou will get much better performance with at least 4GB or RAM.\nDon't be too ambitions ..\nUnless you are willing to muck with partitions, just install Windows (whatever version) first, and then use the Ubuntu installer to install alongside.\n\nGeneral comment:\nIf you are (giving up and) returning to Windows 7, you need to revert to pre-UEFI (Legacy) setting in BIOS and may need to use the Ubuntu installer to remove (delete) any existing partitions (and formatting).\n\nA: I'm not honestly sure what I did, but I got Ubuntu to load up correctly.

Note that you may adapt the Desktop directory name depending on your locale.\nFor all users in general, create a root owned .desktop file in /etc/xdg/autostart folder for all users to access, and for Exec= line , create a symbolic link to the program you want users to access. For instance,\nbash -c 'ln -s /usr/share/applications/gedit.desktop /home/$USER/Desktop/gedit-link'\nNote, the above exaple uses as gedit.desktop just as an example; adapt as necessary for your specific case.

In this moment I have installed on my PC Windwos 8, Ubuntu 15 and Ubuntu 14 but just Ubuntu 15 have visible on bootloader\n\nProper diagnosis of this type of problem requires more information, starting with the partition table information and GRUB configuration file. This information can all be gathered into one convenient report by the Boot Info Script, which can be installed from the boot-info-script package, IIRC. Run this tool and it should generate a file called RESULTS.txt. Post that file to a pastebin site and post a URL to your document here so that we can review it.\nAbsent that diagnostic information, I do have one suggestion that might help: Prepare a USB flash drive with my rEFInd boot manager. Unlike GRUB, which relies on a configuration file with boot options, rEFInd generates them on the fly based on its scan of available boot loaders (including Linux kernels) on your computer. Thus, rEFInd might enable you to boot any of your OSes. I emphasize the word might because there are a number of situations in which rEFInd won't help, not least of which is if you don't actually have all three OSes installed the way you think they're installed. (It's quite common for people to accidentally trash one OS or distribution when installing another one, so this is a very real possibility. The Boot Info Script output will help us figure out if that's happened to you.) Thus, the rEFInd solution is, at best, a shot in the dark; but at least trying it from a USB flash drive or CD-R is unlikely to make matters worse.\n\nbut it don't works\n\nIn the future, always be more precise about what is and is not working. A claim that something doesn't work, with no elaboration, is unhelpful from a problem-solving perspective. Even if the symptoms are exactly what you described earlier, say so. If the symptoms differ, even slightly, describe how they're different.\n\nI've obtain that message: WARNING: GPT (GUID Partition Table) detected on '/dev/sdb1'!\n\nAssuming this is an accurate report of the message, you've made a critical mistake: You must use partitioning tools, such as fdisk, gdisk, and parted, on whole disks. The /dev/sdb1 device specified in this error message, though, is a single partition. The corresponding whole-disk device is /dev/sdb (with no trailing 1). Running something like fdisk -l /dev/sdb1 will be misleading but harmless; but if you actually created partitions inside a partition, you might have trashed whatever data existed on that partition.\nAs oldfred points out, fdisk is also useless on GPT disks, at least in Ubuntu 14.04. (15.04's fdisk supports GPT, though.) That said, if the output was an accurate cut-and-paste without typos, then the error of applying fdisk to a partition rather than a disk means that we don't really know that the disk actually is a GPT disk. This in turn means that we can't be certain that Windows is booting in EFI mode, much less that Ubuntu is (or should) be doing the same. All of this brings us back to my initial point: We need more data, in the form of Boot Info Script output, before anything conclusive can be said about what's wrong.\n\nEDIT:\nYour Boot Info Script output is helpful. Some observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have at most two Linux installations. /dev/sda5 holds what looks like Ubuntu, and /dev/sda6 appears to hold something else.\n\n*Boot Info Script shows two GRUB configuration files. One identifies /dev/sda5 as Ubuntu and does not have an entry for /dev/sda6. The other identifies /dev/sda5 as OpenSUSE and /dev/sda6 as Debian. From your description, I suspect that the first of those is active.\n\n*Your disk is MBR and your computer is booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. This is not (or should not be) a problem, but you should keep it in mind. Ignore the GPT warning you got when you tried to read /dev/sda1 with fdisk. Also ignore suggestions to install an EFI version of GRUB; that will just create new problems.\n\n*/dev/sda5 uses ext4fs, which is the default filesystem for Ubuntu. /dev/sda6 uses Btrfs, which is supported by Ubuntu but is not standard. Btrfs is more likely to cause problems than ext4fs, but Btrfs is more advanced. For the most part, Btrfs should be used only by experts who fully understand its features and quirks.\n\n\nYour best course of action at this point is probably to run Boot Repair on the computer. With any luck, that will fix the problem. If it doesn't, the next thought that occurs to me is to dig into manual boot loader configuration; you could install LILO or GRUB Legacy, or create a custom GRUB 2 setup that's not configured by GRUB's automatic scripts. This approach requires considerable knowledge, though. There are lots of (mostly older) Web sites that describe how to do this, but I don't have any URLs handy. Overall, though, I don't recommend that you try manual boot loader configuration; given your current level of knowledge, you'll find it frustrating.\nIf Boot Repair doesn't work, an easier option may be to use virtualization (VirtualBox, KVM/QEMU, etc.) rather than multi-booting. This approach bypasses the need for such a complex boot loader setup, and so is likely to be both much easier and much safer to manage. It has the drawback that you won't have direct hardware access in the guest OS(es), though, which could be an issue if you want to run games. Running OpenSUSE or Kali under Ubuntu should not be a problem, though; if you need direct hardware access, you can use Ubuntu for that. In this scenario, your OpenSUSE or Kali installation would exist so you can familiarize yourself with those distributions, not for real work. Since that's presumably the point of dual-booting two Linux distributions, this should be fine. If you go this route, you'll probably want to either erase one of your Linux partitions (probably /dev/sda6) and mount it within your Linux directory tree for use as data storage or delete the partition entirely and use GParted to expand the remaining Linux filesystem into that space.\n\nA: Are you saying Kali initiated the \"catastrophe\"? Or did you go to Kali expecting to go from only Ubuntu 15 to a menu with 4 systems? Or were you destroying Ubuntu 15 and Ubuntu 14 at will because you didn't have anything there, simply you wanted some multi-boot experience? Anyway, if booting into Ubuntu 15 is OK and you haven't overwritten the \"correct\" partitions, especially the EFI partition, then the fix should be as simple as apt-get update; apt-get upgrade, either from Ubuntu 15 proper or from Advanced/Recovery for Ubuntu 15, since you are certain to fetch a new grub version (I am guessing grub-efi) and reconfigure it \"automatically\". In the recovery session just remember to start with a disk check, and drop to a \"root prompt\" ideally being networked by cable. \nP.S. with these Windows computers you should be installing and using gdisk instead of fdisk, and gparted if you are in the GUI. On the other hand, Boot-repair saved me more than once, of course by copying and pasting exactly what it says when it says it, you may have damaged all your important partitions already. \n", "Q: Dual boot - Windows missing after installing ubuntu I am posting a question and also post the answer as I don’t know other way around to help others.\nI Have been struggling from last 1 month to make dual boot on my hp laptop its hp g6-2313ax, however finally I did it tonight .\nMy problem was, I was not getting option to select win7 and laptop was keep on booting with Ubuntu.\nBelow is the solution \nsorry guys if i am doing anything wrong (if yes), please guide me the right way :)\n\nA: I have installed win 7 normally, made 2 partition please make note its in MBR \n\n\n*\n\n*100 mb system reserved\n\n*50 gigs for my win 7 \n\n*Left rest as unallocated \nNow after the installation I rebooted the and booted with bootable ubuntu USB \nI am not able to see option “alongside” so selected something else \nThen coming on to Ubuntu partition (doesnt matter under GPT primary or logical.

I did all the standard procedures to fix this and none of them remotely worked. When I boot up into Windows the sound works, when I boot into Ubuntu without touching or editing the sound what so ever, there is no sound. Any help is much appreciated.\n\nA: My apology by asking, but did you tried out the system testing, if you checked out the hardware or software of your sound in windows, there´s mostly a chance you can find the drivers, for your sound issue within the synaptic toolbox where you can find any broken system issue, even if you would try to find it out check the hardware info on Ubuntu and you will find a solution to it,, if not you can give me the name of your hardware then i will look for it.\n\nA: If you are using only the free driver (not Catalyst) try a kernel build from here: \nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\n4.1.6 should be good enough.\nRead here on how to choose the correct packages to install:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds\n", "Q: Dual booting Windows 10 and Ubuntu I have a hard drive with Windows 10 on it and a spare one I installed Ubuntu on. I wanted to have it automatically boot the hard drive with Windows 10 on it instead of showing a grub menu and having to select what OS to boot into and then if I wanted to use the Ubuntu drive, I could just hit Esc key when my computer boots and select the Ubuntu drive and then have the grub menu pop up. Now when I select my Windows hard drive to boot it, it brings up grub rescue prompt but if I select the Ubuntu drive it brings up the grub menu to select the OS. I unplugged the Windows 10 hard drive when I installed Ubuntu so why is it being affected by the Ubuntu install when I try to boot that hard drive?\n\nA: I just set this up for my Dell laptop.  I installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (not live) on a USB flash drive. When I boot my laptop, it boots to Windows 10 by default.  Then, when I plug in the U-14 flash drive, I press F12  for the boot menu and choose Ubuntu.\nIn the computer BIOS, I turned OFF secure boot. I set Boot Options to Ubuntu, Windows Boot Manager, none and none.\nThen I plugged in the Live and target USBs and booted to the Live USB. I used Gparted to partition a 2GB swap partition at the end of the target drive and formated the rest of the drive as EXT4, /.  After applying the changes, I changed the flag of the main partition to boot.  \nWhen I chose the partitions to install I chose to install U14 to the / partition.  I also changed the Boot option to SDB (not a partition.)\nWhen I was done, I booted to the BIOS and turned ON the security boot. \nWhen I boot, I press the  F12 key and get a choice to boot to Windows or Ubuntu.  If I remove the USB, it default boots to Windows.  \nI can also change the BIOS boot order to Ubuntu and then Windows.  Once set, I can boot to Ubuntu as long as the flash drive is plugged in before I turn on the computer.  But if I boot without it, I will have to use the boot menu to boot to Ubuntu until I change the BIOS default order again.\nUbuntu always boots through the Grub menu.   Windows does not use the Grub menu.\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: no sound after upgrade to 15.04 hello I tried the alsamixer in the terminal and the GUI both have volume all the way up and was unmuted and I had sound before but I had to upgrade case something happened and every one said an upgrade would fix the issue from before I use my computer to watch Netflix on my TV so M was trying to fix this issue quickly if I could I'm not sure of what to do could y'all help me with what I need to give y'all for info to help solve this issue.\n\nA: What kind off connection do they have wired blue tooth, which kind off hardware? then there could be a chance to find some thing\n\nA: After several days trying to learn how to fix this by reading all of your posts, testing all advice to no avail, the solution turned out to be hitting F10 during boot up and finding that  'integrated audio' was disabled.\nAm new here and a novice so may still be missing something but damn glad to have sound back.

How to find details like whether the mounted file-system is read only or read-write?\nIn addition to it how to find details of the hard disk or partition health status without affecting the data of that mounted disk or partition?\n\nA: Command mount will list all mounted partitions and will indicate whether they are mounted read only (ro) or read-write (rw).\nThere is no way to tell whether a filesystem is \"healty\" while mounted in a normal read-write mode. To determine whether a filesystem is healthy you need to use fsck (or a similar tool) and these require either unmounted filesystems or filesystems mounter read-only.\nI guess you could look in the kernel log using command dmesg and look for messages like \"journal replayed\" - they will indicate that the filesystem has been mounted dirty.\n\nA: The file /proc/mounts contains the neccessary information. \nFor instance, there I have an entry for my jump drive\n/dev/sdb1 /media/xieerqi/Lexar vfat rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,uid=1000,gid=1000,fmask=0022,dmask=0077,codepage=437,iocharset=iso8859-1,shortname=mixed,showexec,utf8,flush,errors=remount-ro 0 0\n\nComa separated list of options and specificallyrw indicates that this is read-write mounted filesystem. For read-only it would say ro\n\nA: you'll need a combination of tools, which I believe are bundled in the package smartmontools. This links holds a fairly nice plan. \n\nYour first step should be to evaluate the SMART report of each drive\n  using smartctl. smartctl -a /dev/sdX assuming a standard SATA\n  controller, with X being the actual drive identifier \nYour second step should be an extended drive self-test, smartctl is\n  the way to go here as well: smartctl --test=long /dev/sdX and after\n  the test time has passed (between 60 and 240 minutes for most drives),\n  read the results with the command in step 1.\nYour third step should be a drive conveyance test, if supported by\n  your drive. You get an error from the following command if it is not\n  supported: smartctl --test=conveyance /dev/sdX. Results: see step 1.\nUp to this point, simply writing the whole drive would have been a bad\n  idea, since bad sector remappings are done during write operations. In\n  other words, the evidence of the drive failure might have been covered\n  up.\nAssuming that all steps above fail to find a problem, you should now\n  use \"badblocks\" to scan your drives for write errors:\nbadblocks -nvs /dev/sdX\n\nThe above is a nondestructive test, use -wvs is the destructive\n  alternative, may be a bit faster.\n\nThe ones I pay attention to on my laptop (with SSD drive, different disks have different S.M.A.R.T. tests) \n5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct\n183 Runtime_Bad_Block\n184 End-to-End_Error \n233 Media_Wearout_Indicator\n\nEspecially the first indicator is nice, as it tells you how many bad sectors/blocks have been remapped on the disk.\n", "Q: Can't get into desktop after messing with input method settings I wanted to use fcitx as the input method framework in Xubuntu desktop and made the changes using im-config.

Can someone give me some ideas as to where to check and how to fix this? I really don't want to re-install this box (it's a VM).\n\nA: For normal use, you should never need to call im-config manually in the first place. Switching between IBus and fcitx is best done using Language Support.\nAnyway, you did. If you are reasonably sure that the problem is caused by your \"messing\" with IM settings, I'd suggest these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a console window with Ctrl+Alt+F1 and log in.\n\n*Run these commands:\nrm .xinputrc\nsudo apt-get purge im-config\nsudo apt-get install im-config\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\nsudo reboot\n\nPlease note that purging im-config will likely result in the removal of a bunch of other packages.

Now both Windows boot options take me to GRUB, which lacks an entry for booting Windows.\nMind you, my Windows partition still exists, the files are still there, and I can boot it from a virtual machine without a problem.\n\nA: It looks like you've got a BIOS-mode version of GRUB installed to your hard disk's MBR, and it's getting confused about how to boot Windows. Your /sys/firmware directory's contents indicate that you've booted Ubuntu in EFI mode, so I'm guessing you're booting your Ubuntu kernels directly from rEFInd, thus bypassing GRUB. In other words, GRUB is useless to you. Unfortunately, completely removing GRUB is tricky, since Ubuntu will try to add it back. You can probably minimize the damage it can do by switching to an EFI version of GRUB, though:\nsudo apt-get install grub-efi\n\nThis should cause the BIOS version of GRUB to be uninstalled, so subsequent updates shouldn't cause more grief; but you may end up with an extra GRUB boot option in rEFInd's menu. Installing the EFI-mode GRUB alone will not solve your problem, though. For that, you'll need to use a Windows recovery disk to re-install the Windows BIOS-mode boot loader. You may be able to use your Windows installation medium for this. If not, repair disc images are available from Microsoft. Unfortunately, I have neither direct download links nor explicit instructions of what you must do to fix this; but doing a Web search on re-installing the Windows boot loader should turn up some options.\nWith any luck, this will get you booting, but you may have extra options in the rEFInd menu. You can hide these by using the dont_scan_volumes, dont_scan_dirs, and/or dont_scan_files options in refind.conf. Read their descriptions in the configuration file itself for information on how to use them. You'll have to pay attention to the item descriptions presented in rEFInd when you highlight an option to figure out what to pass as options to the dont_scan_* tokens.\n", "Q: How to configure MAAS to be able to boot virtual machines via VMware type I've installed Ubuntu MaaS using VMware Workstation on a vm with Ubuntu 14.04 and upgraded it via ppa stable.\nI'd like to add some vnodes to MaaS and setting them their Power Type as \"VMware\" but I don't know how I've to make that\n\nI've also installed the package python-pyvmomi\n\nsudo apt-get install python-pyvmomi --install-suggests\n\nas suggested here \nhttp://maas.ubuntu.com/docs1.8/changelog.html\nbut nothing. anyone knows how making that? thanks in advance \nSOLUTION:\nas suggested me by Mike, the solution has been:\n\n\n*\n\n*create all my VMs under \"Shared VMs\";\n\n*filled all parts in  \"Add Hardware > Chassis\" using as values my Host.\n\n\n\nThen after few seconds I've seen all VMs in MaaS \n\nrun the commission step\n\n\nA: First, for MAAS to be able to manage VMware Workstation VMs, they must exist under the Shared VMs folder in VMware Workstation.\nNext, rather than adding nodes manually and then trying to set the power type, I would recommend using the Add Hardware > Chassis feature to add the nodes. This is a much more user friendly experience, as it will automatically discover all the nodes in a particular hypervisor, and configure them properly for use with MAAS, including the power type information.\nBe very careful if you are using this with a production VMware system, since performing this operation will change the configuration of your virtual machines. If you are using a VMware setup which contains a mix of VMs which will be MAAS managed and VMs which will not be, I strongly recommend renaming the MAAS-managed VMs within the hypervisor so that their names start with something identifiable, such as \"maas\". Then you can use the Prefix filter option and specify (for example) \"maas\" to manage only those nodes.\nWhen you enter your username and password, keep in mind that for VMware workstation, I've found that the username and password are the same as what you use for your OS login. (There are ways to add another user and give it access to your VMs if you aren't comfortable with giving MAAS that information.)\n", "Q: Two servers(services) on one machine (IP) I'm wondering, is there any option to run multiple servers or services on one device (Ubuntu server) on one IP?\nFor example\nI want to install something similar to ActiveDirectory, let's say it will be Zentyal Server or 'clean' samba.\nThen, i want to install a jabber server, and finally, an ownCloud server, and an Apache server.\nI will have two interfeces on my machine.

I went to http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows and got PenDriveLinux installed. The USB has 2.2gb partitioned and everything looks well except for one thing: My computer refuses to run the USB drive!\nI accessed my boot menu and there were about 5-6 different choices to boot from. I chose USB HDD but it loads up with a windows logo and I don't see ubuntu anywhere... Is my computer not able to run Ubuntu or am I doing something wrong? I've clicked on most of the USB options from the boot menu and I have not gotten anything different...\nI am using windows 8.1 64-bit and I also installed ubuntu on 64-bit.\n\nA: To be able to boot to your Ubuntu USB drive you will need to turn off the fast boot option.\nPress the \"super\" key (Windows key) and then click the magnifying glass in the top right corner.\nEnter \"Control Panel\". Click on the \"Control Panel\" option that appears.\nWhen the \"Control Panel\" appears click on the \"System and Security\" heading.. \nFor reference here\n\nA: I have a Dell Laptop with Windows 10 (upgraded from 8.1) installed on the HDD. I have a 32GB USB 3.0 Flash drive with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installed (not Live).  In order to run it, I set my BIOS boot options to Fast Boot Enabled, Secure Boot Enabled, and I set my Boot Option Priorities as follows: \nBoot Option #1 [Windows Boot Manager]\nBoot Option #2 [ubuntu]\nIf I want to always default boot to the USB, I move [ubuntu] up to Boot Option #1.  It will work as long as I don't remove the USB while the computer is on. \nWhen I want to boot to whatever is non-default, I press F12 to enter the BIOS boot options and choose Windows or Ubuntu accordingly.  \nAlso, when I boot to the USB drive, the GRUB has links to Ubuntu and Windows, so I can choose either from there.  If I forget and remove the USB while the computer is running or I don't have it in when I turn it on, I have to use the BIOS boot menu to access Ubuntu.  Otherwise, when I boot, I get the Grub and can choose, with Ubuntu being GRUB's default.\nBTW, Ubuntu on the USB 3 boots faster than Windows 10 recovers from a Hibernate. \nEdit:  My system operates with Fast Boot on in both the BIOS and Windows.  I generally hibernate windows when leaving and only shut it down when I am at home. Even if I shut it down, it comes up quickly.  Regardless, Ubuntu is faster.  :)\n", "Q: Shut down list of servers given in a file I have a list of 17 servers in this format \n172.16.1.4      #servername-A\n172.16.2.75     #servername-B\n172.16.5.53     #servername-C\n172.16.5.61     #servername-D \n\ni'd like a script that can ssh/login to each and every of these servers and shut them down which is easy enough but the catch is that they need to be turned off in a particular order shown above (down the list) where each preceding one has to be completely turned off before the next shut down begins.\n\nA: Perhaps:\nwhile read ip rest_of_line; do\n    ssh user@$ip sudo poweroff\ndone < server.file\n\nThe ssh command will return when the ssh daemon on the remote server is shut down.

I have a 60 GB SSD where my Ubuntu installation and home folder is and a 1 TB HDD that I used to use as storage device (movies, music..). I have decided to sell the 1 TB drive but before I do that I want to completely erase all data on it or at least make it unrecoverable by most software out there. What I want to do is the following:\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdc\n\nand then quick format the drive using Disks utility.\nMy question is this: do I need to unmount the /dev/sdc before I proceed with the dd command? \n\nA: It's possible (checked in this moment) but it's highly advisable to umount the device before a dd.\n\nThis may be not a problem in your special case if=/dev/urandom, but in other cases:\nIf is some activity on that partition during the dd command, there is no guarantee that you partition isn't broken.\n\nA: You should boot into a Live USB and unmount the disk you are trying to erase. If you absolutely must, you can try remounting the root filesystem as read-only using Alt+SysRQ+u, then use dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX where /dev/sdX is your disk. You really should consider using a Live USB though, since it is MUCH safer.\n\nA: The srm (secure-remove) utility provides several options/patterns for overwriting previous disk contents. \nSome of these options are secure enough to ensure that forensic disk scans will not be able to recover the previous files; but: more security = lengthier overwrite process.\nTo install srm type:\nsudo apt install secure-delete\n\nto use:\nsrm szFileName\n\n", "Q: Problems after removing gnome-shell package I recently installed the gnome-shell package to try out gnome desktop, didn't like it so much so I removed it and returned to unity.

My ageing PC running Mint 17 (based on Ubuntu 14.04) has been working fine for years, with everything working perfectly for me. However I have a problem whenever I add a new user, which I have to do frequently. The LC_TIME part of the locale always defaults to Spanish, presumably because my time zone is \"Europe/Madrid.\" The down side to this is that the dates are always in Spanish, everything else in UK English, whereas the date for me (the user created during installation) is shown correctly in English. There is a workaround here but do I really have to do this every time I add a user? What would be better is the ability to customize the DEFAULT locale settings so that they are inherited at creation time.  \nIn the screenshot you can see that the LANG and LC_TIME are different. The output from the command \"locale\" is different for me and any new user I create, which is where (I think) the problem is.\nBTW the /etc/default/locale file is as follows:\nLANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"es_ES.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"es_ES.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"es_ES.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=\"es_ES.UTF-8\"\nLC_NAME=\"es_ES.UTF-8\"\nLC_ADDRESS=\"es_ES.UTF-8\"\nLC_TELEPHONE=\"es_ES.UTF-8\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\"es_ES.UTF-8\"\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\"es_ES.UTF-8\"\n\nbut as my sign in gives en_GB.UTF-8 (which is what I want), something clearly changes it. What is it, and how do I fix this problem?\n\nA: You need to change /etc/default/locale. The easiest way is to open Language Support and select the Regional Formats tab.

Also, if the list is smaller than the available area, there are no issues with scrolling.\n\nHowever, if the list is large enough, while scrolling and also after the scrolling is finished, the list overlaps the component above:\n\nMain.qml\nimport QtQuick 2.4\nimport QtQuick.Layouts 1.1\n\nimport Ubuntu.Components 1.2\n\nMainView {\n\n    width: units.gu(40)\n    height: units.gu(30)\n\n    Page {\n        ColumnLayout {\n            spacing: units.gu(1)\n            anchors {\n                margins: units.gu(2)\n                fill: parent\n            }\n\n            TextField {\n                id: textInput\n                Layout.fillWidth: true;\n                placeholderText: i18n.tr(\"Add an item\")\n            }\n\n            MyList {\n                anchors {\n                    left: parent.left\n                    right: parent.right\n                }\n\n                Layout.fillHeight: true\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nMyList.qml\nimport QtQuick 2.4\nimport Ubuntu.Components 1.2\nimport Ubuntu.Components.ListItems 1.0\n\nItem {\n\n    ListModel {\n        id: listModel\n        ListElement {itemName: 'one'}\n        ListElement {itemName: 'two'}\n        ListElement {itemName: 'three'}\n        ListElement {itemName: 'four'}\n    }\n\n    UbuntuListView {\n        anchors.fill: parent\n\n        model: listModel\n\n        delegate: ListItem {\n            id: listItem\n\n            divider.visible: false\n            Label {\n                id: label\n                text: itemName\n\n                verticalAlignment: Text.AlignVCenter\n                height: parent.height\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nI tried changing the z property on the components, but it didn't help.\nAm I misusing the API?\nOr is it a bug in the Ubuntu SDK? (and if so, is there any workaround possible?)\n\nA: Add clip: true to the UbuntuListView.\nBy default, QML objects have this set to false, which allows them to draw outside their allocated rectangle.  I assume this is an optimization, since it allows the renderer to avoid calculating clipping for each element.  Most QML objects only draw within their allocated rectangle, so you don't notice this.  But list views with lists long enough to scroll will draw outside of that rectangle, so you need to turn on clipping if you don't want to see that.\n", "Q: Gedit not preserving extended attributes on file edit I'm working on a project where i rely mostly on the file's extended attribute that i set when i create the file. But i'm facing problem while modifying the file.\nExample:\nWhen i edit a text file in Sublime Text, all the extended attributes are preserved, also the inode value remains the same as before. But when i do the same in Gedit, it is creating new file instead of modifying the existing one. So inode value, user defined/extended attributes are not preserved.\nI see this problem is due to the copying behavior of Gedit. \nIs there a way to preserve them while using Gedit?\n\nA: The answer is no. You will have to file a bug report, or fork the project and implement an extended attributes protocol.\nIn C++/Qt, I wrote a Library that accomplishes this using the <sys/xattr.h>. It is something you would have to attach to a QFile, and if its something you want to merge into Gedit, you would have to convert it to C code.

This script runs just fine if I run it manually. Running it from crontab just isn't working.

As the default shell for cron (not the same thing as your scripts shebang) is sh (which is dash in Ubuntu), it does not understand &> syntax. As a result it is treating the & to put the shell script as a background job.\nTo overcome this, use the portable way of redirection :\n*/1 * * * * /home/rommy/spam_monitor.sh >/home/rommy/cronresults.txt 2>&1\n\n\nA: This is more of a style criticism.

I'm currently having trouble installing the daily Wily release (it's failing). I'm only able to get:\ninitctl: Unknown job: lldpd\nstop: Unknown instance: \nI'd like to get more/better debug output during the install to help identify what exactly is happening here.\n\nA: When using MAAS and the curtin installer (which is the default since release 1.7) a node install happens in the following set of steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*The node PXE boots into an ephemeral environment using the version of Ubuntu you selected to install.\n\n*cloud-init downloads user data from MAAS, including ssh keys and curtin.\n\n*cloud-init sets up the ssh keys and starts curtin installing the node.\n\n*curtin finishes installing and reboots the node.\n\n\nIt looks like step 1 is working for you. To debug steps 2 and beyond you need to capture the console output from the node while it boots. If you are actually deploying a VM (as opposed to bare metal), that's easy -- just access the output from the host. For the bare metal cases, you will need to use remote KVM or serial over LAN functionality to capture the console output. The console output will contain cloud-init log messages that indicate how it's progressing. It can fail in various ways so you'll need to dig further into whatever you see there.\nIf you don't have a way to grab the console remotely, one way to dig further into failures as this stage is to backdoor the ephemeral install image with a user/password that will allow you to login via the console or via ssh. Here's how that's done:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, disable image syncing on the settings page of your MAAS server. This prevents MAAS from overwriting the backdoored images.\n\n*Then, this script can be used to setup the backdoors on all of the images in the server.\nsudo apt-get install --assume-yes bzr\nbzr branch lp:~maas-maintainers/maas/backdoor-image backdoor-image\n\nimgs=$(echo /var/lib/maas/boot-resources/*/*/*/*/*/*/root-image)\nfor img in $imgs; do\n    [ -f \"$img.dist\" ] || sudo cp -a --sparse=always $img $img.dist\ndone\n\ncd backdoor-image\nfor img in $imgs; do\n    sudo ./backdoor-image -v --user=backdoor --password-auth --password=ubuntu $img\ndone\n\n\n*Now, retry the installation of the node. Once the node starts ssh you should be able to login with user 'backdoor' and password 'ubuntu'. If SSH never starts, you can login on the console with the same user and password. Once logged in you can use 'sudo' to debug.\n\n*Once you have figured out the problem and addressed it, be sure to re-enable image synchronization, and replace the backdoored images with stock ones:\nimgs=$(echo /var/lib/maas/boot-resources/*/*/*/*/*/*/root-image)\nfor img in $imgs; do\n    [ -f \"$img.dist\" ] && sudo mv -f $img.dist $img\ndone\n\nEven without the backdoor there is a window of time during which you can ssh in, as during installation cloud-init sets up ssh keys and starts sshd. Once  ssh keys are in place, curtin starts installing; at this point you can ssh  into the system using the 'ubuntu' user and the ssh key for your MAAS user.  You must do this quickly, before curtin finishes and reboots the system. To prevent curtin from powering off the node, run\ntouch /tmp/block-poweroff\n\nas soon as you are logged in. You can do this in a while loop to avoid needing to get the timing exactly right; this should to be run as soon as you trigger the installation:\nwhile true; do ssh node-foo.maas touch /tmp/block-poweroff && break; done\n\nAt that point you should be able to ssh in normally without worrying about curtin powering the node off.\nWhichever way you logged into the system, remember you can use sudo as the ubuntu user; this lets you, for instance, access all the logs on the system.\n", "Q: 12 Hour Time Instead Of 24 in linux I want to set my linux machine box 12 hours format,how to set it ,please advise\nI am able to display with #date +%r,but wanted to set it permanently\n\nA: You can set LC_TIME to a different locale.

Before I do so I plan on dropping Ubuntu onto a spacious thumb-drive and playing with it to learn the ins and outs a bit. However I had a few questions I thought you folks might be able to answer which would help me prepare for the transition.\n\n\n*\n\n*I play games. Can I run Diablo II, Steam, and my AMD Catalyst/Gaming Evolved software in Ubuntu? (Yes, running Diablo II is that important...)\n\n*Does OpenOffice run well in Ubuntu?\n\n*How difficult is it to communicate on a home network over a WIFI connection with other devices (Android phone, Windows laptop which is soon to be an Ubuntu machine as well, etc.)?\n\n*How challenging is it getting all of the hardware drivers for my PC (an HP Pavilion) to work well with the Ubuntu OS?\n\n*Will my Adobe CS 5.1 Master Collection run on Ubuntu? \nThe little research I've had time to do on Ubuntu has led me to believe I'd be far happier with it in general than I am with Windows. It seems like once I have some familiarity with the basic suite it's pretty customizable, and many of the encumbrances Windows suffers from (just look at the stuff in the start menu on any Windows machine for an example) are optional (more or less) in Ubuntu if I'm reading things right. I don't expect Ubuntu to be an easy OS to master, but it doesn't seem to difficult to learn to get started, and if I could kiss Windows goodbye, well... that would be fantastic.\nAnyways, thanks for your help in advance.\n\nA: Welcome to the community! Hopefully I'll be able to help you out with all of your questions.\n\n1) I play games. Can I run Diablo II, Steam, and my AMD\n  Catalyst/Gaming Evolved software in Ubuntu? (Yes, running Diablo II is\n  that important...)\n\nSteam most definitely runs on Linux. As for individual steam games, you'll have to check their pages in the store to see if they support Linux. Your AMD catalyst card has supported drivers, you just have to enable them. You should be prompted to do so during setup, which is as easy as just clicking on them and hitting okay.\nDiablo II isn't available on Steam last I checked, but there is software called Wine. Wine will help you run Windows executables on Ubuntu, and according to their app database Diablo II works fantastically.\n\n2) Does OpenOffice run well in Ubuntu?\n\nIn my opinion, OpenOffice runs BETTER in Ubuntu. However, Ubuntu does come preinstalled with the successor of OpenOffice called LibreOffice. LibreOffice has all of the same functionality and more, and supports all OpenOffice formats. Not surprising, because it was created by the OpenOffice team. Give it a shot first! I think you'll like it a lot.\n\n3) How difficult is it to communicate on a home network over a WIFI\n  connection with other devices (Android phone, Windows laptop which is\n  soon to be an Ubuntu machine as well, etc.)?\n\nIt's really not difficult at all. It's infinitely easier to communicate with an Android phone than an iPhone (trust me, months of futzing with an iPhone I was stuck with taught me my lesson). But you definitely shouldn't have any issues with getting in touch with your devices over WiFi at all, that is built in functionality that you should see in the menu while browsing your files.\n\n4) How challenging is it getting all of the hardware drivers for my PC\n  (an HP Pavilion) to work well with the Ubuntu OS?\n\nGenerally speaking, most computers work with Ubuntu out of the box. HP especially, because Canonical (the company that heavily supports Ubuntu) works closely with HP to make sure it works. You can always check this page to see if yours is certified to work, but in my experience it's easily possible to get Ubuntu to work on just about anything.\n\n5) Will my Adobe CS 5.1 Master Collection run on Ubuntu?\n\nThis is a tough question. Some pieces of CS5 run under wine, others do not. I would search for them in the Wine App Database. I would also ask around here or the forums to see if there are any suitable alternatives to you - I transitioned away from the Adobe suite long before I left Windows for good and I've never looked back. GIMP is a very solid graphics editing program available for every platform, and is one of Photoshop's biggest competitors. If you can't get something to work, there are always open source alternatives.\nI hope you enjoy Ubuntu! Let me know how everything goes.\nNow the boring stuff:\nOn AskUbuntu they typically prefer that you focus on one question per post. Try to make sure you do that from now on! If you have a whole bunch of questions about a specific or general topic, it may be faster for you just to post them all at once in one thread on the Ubuntu forums.\n", "Q: Disable low battery notifications/warning on 15.04 I would like to disable the low battery warnings on Ubuntu 15.04 with Unity.

So when installation finished and I rebooted, the system went straight into Windows. I went to Ubuntu IRC Support and they told me to turn off the secure boot and reinstall Ubuntu. I did that but my system still\nboot into windows.\nThis is a picture of partitions on my system:\n\nThis is my first Ubuntu install on my new laptop.\nI followed everdaylinux guide to install it and I used something else option.\n\nA: Re-installing GRUB is almost certainly overkill, and carries a small risk of messing things up. Instead, try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Windows.\n\n*Open an Administrator Command Prompt window by right-clicking the Command Prompt icon and selecting the option to run it as Administrator.\n\n*Type bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\n\n*Reboot.\n\n*If you boot into Ubuntu but GRUB did not give you a menu or if that menu did not include Windows, type sudo update-grub in a Terminal.\n\n\nThat should fix it. Alternatively, instead of steps #2-3, you could try the third-party EasyUEFI, which gives you a GUI menu for rearranging EFI boot priorities. Some EFIs provide similar functionality in their setup utilities. You can also do the same thing with efibootmgr in Ubuntu, but that sometimes fails due to bugs in either efibootmgr or EFIs, and it's harder to explain than is the same procedure with bcdedit in Windows.\n\nA: Okay, this is a bit of a process, so fair warning beforehand: it gets a little complex.\nYou'll have to boot into the Ubuntu LiveCD, and select try Ubuntu. From there, mount your root partition. You can do this by going into the file manager and then clicking on \"20GB Filesystem\" (or something very similar to that - you'll know it when you see it on the side). Now open a terminal and type  sudo -i \nThat will transfer you to a root shell , so be careful! \nRun cd /media/ubuntu\nthen type ls and hit enter.\nYou should see 1 (maybe 2) options . One will have a very strange name, the other one will have a label denoting as a CDrom. \nIf there is a second entry , go to the  very strange name by typing cd foldername and hitting enter. Then execute\ngrub-install /dev/sda; chroot . grub-update\nThe output will be \"done.\" Reboot, and your bootloaded should be back in place with your choice.\n\nA: Write the Super Grub disk to a USB drive and boot from it.\nStart Ubuntu.\nIf you are in Ubuntu, open a terminal and type\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n\nA: ISSUE -- \n\n\" I CAN'T ACCESS THE GRUB (UBUNTU) MENU BECAUSE MY LAPTOP/PC BOOTS\n  DIRECTLY TO WINDOWS. \"\n\nSOLUTION -- \n\n\" PRESS THE KEY THAT OPENS YOUR BIOS SETTINGS DURING START.

Note, that there are no spaces around = and no dollar sign before the variable name.\nIn the second line, you shows the variable in a message box. To access the content of the variable, you need the dollar sign here.\n\nAnd here is the solution as I understand you question before my edit ;)\nRESULT=$(dialog --inputbox \"Enter a Line, please\" 10 60 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3 3>&-); echo \"result: ${RESULT}\"\n\nIn the example standard out and error out is written to a variable 3 and transferred from there to the RESULT variable.

My SSD is not showing up as option to automatically boot from in the BIOS in my boot load order; however I can manually boot from it in the BIOS.\nWhy is this happening, and how can I fix it?\n\nA: I am assuming your SSD is external, as is mine.  I should add that if that is the case, most readers here will not understand that.  Some bioses have that issue.  My asus is one fine example of this.  On my asus, I need to press esc every time it boots to bring up the boot selection method.  It takes just a little getting use to, but is worth it.\n\nA: If BIOS can boot to it manually it [almost certainly] can boot to it automatically. It's just a case of working out what needs kicking. Many motherboards have multiple disk controllers (with some being third party that get a much lower boot priority). It might be worth moving to another controller if you can and seeing if that allows you to select the correct drive.\nAnyway, failing that and as a very distant workaround, you could install Grub (the bootloader) onto other devices... Like a small USB drive. Then make that the bootable device.\nBut seriously, I'd take this up with the Motherboard/SSD manufacturers before getting that far.\n", "Q: Transfer files to cloud by terminal I need a free cloud system, where I can transfer my backup files in range of 1-10 GB, by terminal command from server.

All I wanted was close the lid and get it locked immediately.

In Ubuntu Unity, click the gear icon in the upper right, select Startup Programs, and click Add.\nName: X Environment Variables\nCommand: /home/your_user/export_x_info\n\nNow you need to edit your /etc/acpi/lid.sh file which catch lid open and close event\ngksudo gedit /etc/acpi/lid.sh and paste\n/home/your_user/lid_event just after #!/bin/bash. Save and close.\nNow you need to create a script for close event so that you can lock your screen.\ngedit ~/lid_event and paste the following.

How can I merge files in different directories? Using cat to merge them all is a meticulous task. It is the only way I know.\nThanks in advance,\nSaikat\n\nA: When having simple text files, you can merge them without difficulties by using the >> operator. It will add the output of the previous command to the end of the file specified after.\nBasic Procedure (not for many files)\nExample:\nImagine a directory structure like this:\nparent\n |--a\n |  \\--first.txt\n \\--b\n    \\--second.txt\n\nNow the contentents of a/first.txt are\nHello! This is my first Textfile.\n   ~~some lines~~\nend\n\nand b/second.txt contains\n    ///////////////////\n   //               //\n  //  second file  //\n //               //\n///////////////////\n\nSo we can merge it by typing:\n$ touch merge.txt\n$ cat a/first.txt >> merge.txt\n$ cat b/second.txt >> merge.txt\n\nA new empty file merge.txt in the current directory will be created and the files contents will be added without overwriting, like > would do.\nmerge.txt now contains:\nHello! This is my first Textfile.\n   ~~some lines~~\nend\n    ///////////////////\n   //               //\n  //  second file  //\n //               //\n///////////////////\n\nDone!\nAdvanced Scripting (to cover many files in different directories)\nIf you have more than ten files, maybe even in ten different directories, you can make a bash script and let the computer do all the selecting and copying on its own. If you're completely new to bash or shell scripting, I'd recommend you to read a little beforehand about what it is capable of and getting a basic understanding of the appearence of variables and loops, so you don't get too confused.\nI'm using the top of http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/bash-loop-over-file/ as a reference now. Our script will look basically like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nFILES=\"file1\n/path/to/file2\"\n\nOUTPUT=\"merge.txt\"\n\nfor f in $FILES\ndo\n    cat $f >> $OUTPUT\ndone\n\n(Oh, I hope this will work)\nIf all your files share something that differenciate them from other files we don't want to merge, that's exactly what we need. Ideally they share a common parent or anchestor folder where you can't find any other files but ours. Then we can simply use /the/path/to/that/folder/* as selector when defining our $FILES variable. As you see in the model, we can set multiple selectors. I hope you don't care too much about the order the files will be selected automatically, else we'd have to think about some way to specify this... For our example above, we could set:\nFILES=\"*/*\" or FILES=\"*/*.txt\" or FILES=\"a/* b/*\" or so and\nOUTPUT=\"merge.txt\" of course.\nSome last thoughts\nMaybe we'll need to pay attention to not selecting our merging file with \"*\", that may end awkward... Above I therefore included one / everytime. You also could simply put it somewhere else.\nIf your files follow some pattern, like p_some-thing-axy-1,p_some-thing-axy-1,p_some-thing-bxz-1, you can choose some selector like p_some-thing-* or so.\nNow I hope you can make some use of that, because I'm out.\nGood luck! :D\n", "Q: Encrypt USB That Is Compatible With Windows I want to encrypt a USB stick, and be able to decrypt it on Windows as well as Ubuntu. How do I do this & what programs do I need to use?\n\nA: Veracrypt is an open-source encryption package that will certainly do this since there are versions of the software for both Linux and Windows.\n\nA: https://github.com/t-d-k/LibreCrypt implements LUKS compatible encryption on Windows.\nI haven't tried, but LUKS is the main Linux disk encryption method, with kernel support, so I think it might work.\n\nA: Perhaps this might help, from Wikipedia:\n\nSoftware solutions such as dm-crypt, FreeOTFE, Data Protecto and TrueCrypt allow the contents of a USB drive to be encrypted automatically and transparently. Also, Windows 7 Enterprise and Ultimate Editions and Windows Server 2008 R2 provide USB drive encryption using BitLocker to Go. The Apple Computer Mac OS X operating system has provided software for disc data encryption since Mac OS X Panther was issued in 2003 (see also: Disk Utility).[10]\nAdditional software can be installed on an external USB drive to prevent access to files in case the drive becomes lost or stolen. Installing software on company computers may help track and minimize risk by recording the interactions between any USB drive and the computer and storing them in a centralized database.\n\n\nA: There is an other portable software, which I found on German Ubuntu Wiki: It is called gpg4usb. I tested it: On a public Windows PC it works with Guest rights. But unfortunately it worked only for text files, and not JPG or PDF.

How can I make it work?\n\nA: Pasting files needs to have all the elements given at the same time to paste. Since you are reading a file, you then need to firstly store the content somewhere -in a temp file, for example- so that you can then paste them together.\nSo I suggest something like this:\ni=1\nwhile read -r file\ndo\n    awk '{print $3}' \"$file\" > file.$i\n    ((i++))\ndone < ind_list\n\nNow you have many file.XX files with the 3rd column of the file.\nThen, just use something like this, where glenn jackman enlightens us:\npaste -d \" \" file.{1..69} > output\n\nAnd then you can clean all the temp files by saying rm file{1..69}.\n\nA: I don't have a terminal to test my answer, so I'll try a blind guess.\nI'd think there might be a difference in behaviour between \npaste <(cut -f3 Ocu27.sites.pi) <(cut -f3 OS10.sites.pi) >output\n\nand\npaste <(cut -f3 Ocu27.sites.pi) >>output\npaste <(cut -f3 OS10.sites.pi) >>output\n\nTo address that, you could change your original loop to :\nwhile read i\ndo\n    arguments=\"$arguments <(cut -f3 $i.sites.pi)\"\ndone < ind_list\neval \"paste $arguments >output\"\n\nAnother benefit from this is that you execute paste only once at the end of your loop, and could thus have some performance improvement compared to computing the pasting at each iteration of your loop\n\nA: Using cat and awk\ncat ind_list | xargs -i'{}' awk '{print $3}' \"{}.sites.pi\" > output\n\n\nExample\nInput files\ncat OC8.sites.pi\nfoo bar foobar\n\ncat OC9.sites.pi\nfoo bar foobar\n\ncat Ocu27.sites.pi\nfoobar foo bar\n\ncat ind_list\nOC8\nOC9\nOcu27\n\nThe command\ncat ind_list | xargs -i'{}' awk '{print $3}' \"{}.sites.pi\" > output\n\nThe output file\ncat output\nfoobar\nfoobar\nbar\n\n", "Q: Changing Nvidia Driver black screen I searched everyone online for solution, but it is still not working.\nAt first I changed the Nvidia driver to use the propriety driver from the additional tab, twice, and it shows black screen which cause me to reinstall.\nAnd then I learnt about the alt+ctrl+f1 to show command prompt. \nWhen I tested Dota 2 in Ubuntu with nouveau driver, there is some lagging.

But this requires a lot of RAM an CPU power, because a virtual machine can use only part of these resources.\nWine allows you to run some Windows programs in Ubuntu. Not all programs will run well, some will not run at all.\n\nA: Wine\nPros: You can run some Windows apps without needing Windows.\nCons: Only some Windows apps will work.\nVirtualBox\nPros: You can run virtually any Windows app.\nCons: You need a pretty beefy computer to run VirtualBox effectively, and a full install of Windows.\nIf the apps you need, run via Wine, then I would say that is the best choice.

I have Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. My external bluetooth adapter is not working in this version of Ubuntu, but it is working very well in Ubuntu 12.x versions. So i downloaded and installed Ubuntu 12.x kernel in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Still my external bluetooth is not working. Does the kernel store linux drivers? Then how can I find driver for specific hardware for Linux? (Like external bluetooth device)\nHow to solve this?\n\nA: You are right: Linux kernel comes with the drivers (aka modules), and if some of the drivers do not work, you may try installing or booting (if you have) a different kernel.  For instance, on 14.04LTS, kernel 3.19 I had a problem with the Virtual box kernel module. But with 14.04LTS and kernel 3.13 there is no problem. Notice, however, that if the Linux kernel does not contain a driver for your device, you may need to find it from your manufacturer or from open source repositories. \nTo try a different kernel, first find out what kernel you are using with the uname -r command in terminal. Then reboot the machine, chose Advanced Options for Ubuntu, and choose any option that has a different kernel number (than shown with uname -r command ) and not displaying ( recovery mode ).\nIf your bluetooth donlge works with an older kernel, it's definitely a driver issue. \nTo tell Ubuntu to boot with your desired kernel, first remember the item you chose from the Advanced Options menu.  For instance, I want to always boot with 3.13 kernel, and I chose to boot with Ubuntu, with Linux 3.13.0-62-generic. \nNext, run this command:\nawk '/menuentry/ && /class/ {count++; print count-1\"****\"$0 }' /boot/grub/grub.cfg | less\n\nRemember the number next to your desired entry.\nFinally, run  the command bellow. REPLACE X   in GRUB_DEFAULT=X with the number you remembered.\nsudo sed -i  's/GRUB_DEFAULT=0/GRUB_DEFAULT=X/g' /etc/default/grub; sudo update-grub\n\nNow, when you reboot, you should be booting with older, working kernel.\n", "Q: Removing changes made to geany Actually I am a newbie here and I installed geany IDE and made some changes to it like hiding the menu (using the full view ).\nNow I want to undo those changes but don't know how to do it.\nCan someone please tell me a way how I can do this . I have tried uninstalling it using  sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove geany and again installing it.

Because currently videos stutter extremely, and even web forms are very hard to fill out (a lot of lag while typing)\nIf anybody could have a solution for this problem, i would thank him very much.\nAlso, my problem is not the one described here:How to use Intel HD Graphics for regular desktop usage, while just using my NVIDIA GPU for DNN training\nbecause i do not want to switch between GPU's, but run them simultaneously.\n\nA: Based on your query in http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2291771 and the answers there, what you are asking for is not possible.\nFrom the forum:\n\nFrom my understanding of Nvidia Optimus technology I do not think it\n  is possible. The purpose of Optimus is automatic switching between a\n  more powerful GPU for high intensity graphic tasks with likewise high\n  battery drain and a less powerful GPU for low intensity graphic tasks\n  with the benefit of less battery drain.\nIn Linux we have yet to get an Nvidia driver that will do automatic\n  switching.\nI am guessing that the problems you are having with video play back\n  are nothing to do with which GPU is being used but in connection with\n  the CPU being under intensive use and needing to task switch. The\n  Nvidia GPU should handle video playback easily. If it is not then it\n  could be a case of too much going on at the same time.\n\nOn the other hand, you can try bumblebee/optirun as described in Correct nvidia+intel graphics setup in 14.04 \nThen you can start ue4 with optirun prefix, thus using the Nvidia card for it and use Intel for other processes like the browser. Open a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and enter:\n(optirun <name of the program> &)\n\nThe (parenthesis) and & will detach the process from the terminal. This will allow you to work on the terminal after launching the program.

I'm pretty sure it's a setting in your BIOS setup. Hold down the DEL key when you turn on the computer to enter the BIOS setup. Somewhere inside there should be an option for the internal graphics card (whether to have it enabled or disabled). You'll need to set this to be enabled, then hit F10 to save the changes and restart. If there is no such option, the decision is made automatically, and you can't control it.

How do I wipe/format my hard drive to start fresh and try again? I had been dual-booting with Ubuntu and windows 8.1 for a while now without issue. However, when attempting my free upgrade to windows 10, it killed both. I am not entirely sure why, but it looks like it wiped a partition. I now do not have a useable computer. My boss provided me with a way to clean install windows 10 from a cd, but the process refuses to make a new partition for it, stating that I need GBT format and I am in MBR. \nHence I am trying to determine how to format my hard drive to GBT now (I really dont even know what any of this means). My boss suggested running the Ubuntu installer to re-format without actually installing Ubuntu. This is where I get stuck. I have the installer successfully booted, but dont know how to carry out this actual task (it seems that it will do a full ubuntu install). \nUltimately this is what I am trying to accomplish:\n-I want to start fresh on my system, get it back to factory settings. It came with windows 8.1 pre-installed. Since I dont have an OS, I cant just run a system restore it seems. What can I do?\n-I want to be able to upgrade my windows 8.1 to windows 10 BEFORE installing Ubuntu (since it is believed that upgrading to windows 10 with Ubuntu already on the system is what causes the problem). \n-I would like to be able to use both windows 10 and Ubuntu on my machine, I use each for respective occupation purposes. \nPlease let me know if you have any ideas or experience with this issue. I am not great with advanced computer stuff. I have been running around in circles with this and its all trial and error for me.

I would not install it (would not work anyway) but if I were to boot from it, could I theoretically complete a system restore from there? Again, my machine came with windows 8.1, not 7. \n-Because 8.1 came pre-installed on my machine I dont have a license key. Its electronically embedded in my BIOS and the manufactorer doesnt know it. I have no boot disk for it.  \n\nA: *\n\n*Reinstall Windows 8.1 from scratch. Use a valid legit key (if possible, or the Windows 10 upgrade will fail most likely). \n\n*Upgrade to Windows 10 from the Windows 8.1 (Windows Update). \n\n*Apply all the patches to Windows 10. \n\n*Insert the Ubuntu disk into your machine, boot from it, and the Ubuntu disk partition some free space from the Windows 10. This is where your Ubuntu will then be installed. \n\n\nI would suggest going through all the Windows \"motions\" first then adding the Ubuntu afterwards. \nIf you continue having problems with Ubuntu partitioning your hard drive, during the Windows 8.1 installation, use the Advanced option to create a separate partition you will later install Ubuntu on (this is call unallocated space). \nAlso, if it ask during the Ubuntu installation, replace the Windows Boot Loader with Ubuntu's one, and make Ubuntu your main OS. \nLet me know if this works out for you. \n\nA: Ok, here's what to do, even though this is technically not Ubuntu topic. Go to http://gparted.org/ and download their live iso. After that, boot into it and use Gparted like you normally would, then wipe the table clean. After that, go online and find a Windows 8.1 iso to burn onto a usb/cd so you can reinstall that, then upgrade to Windows 10, and after that install Ubuntu. Hope this helps.\n\nA: You can download and use \"hirens boot dvd\" to get the partions back the way you want, I assume you already have created backup media to restore windows 8.1, if not then you must be having a valid license key for 8.1 or most likely the upgrade will fail/ give warning that you were a victim of piracy and need to activate the licence in 3 days. I would suggest using the microsoft media creation tool to download a fresh copy from Microsoft Website and install the Windows 10. After that you can install Ubuntu. If you do not have the media backed up then you can contact microsoft/vendor for the media, alternatively look for unaltered media from any other source. \n\nA: To retrieve your 8.1 license key install windows 8.1 from any copy that is \"untouched\" you can use any license key you have at your disposal, then go to \"rweverything.com\" download the 64/32 bit \"read/write portable utility\" and run it, click on \"ACPI\" button and then in the \"ACPI Table\" pop up click on the \"MSDM tab\", at the bottom you should see the Product key in the \"Data\" entry, write this down, now right-click Computer, and then click Properties. Scroll down to the bottom of the window that appears, and then, under Windows activation, click Change product key. If you're prompted for permission to continue the process, click Continue. Once this is done you can continue with your upgrade to windows 10 through windows update and finally install Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How can I determine total Boot Time What command do I use to determine how long my actual boot time is? From the grub screen until all the start up processes are finished in the background.  I ask because Launcher stays purple for at least another minute or so after I have desktop use.  So, I wait until I see it change to the color that matches the theme in use before I begin my session.  \nThe next logical step would be to analyse the boot time data, determine if there are errors, fix, and stream line it.\n\nA: Generally 'dmesg' has the seconds-since-boot time stamp in the left hand column. So 'dmesg | head' should show that all the first events occurred within 0.000000 seconds since the kernel started. Running 'dmesg | tail' immediately after you login should give a pretty good idea. /var/log/kern.log has this same info but each seconds-since-boot stamp is accompanied by the system time as well, so logging in, running 'date' and doing some arithmetic will give you a what might be a more reliable approximation, depending on exactly what you're looking for. The number you're looking for is subject to interpretation. You may be looking for the time it takes before you are given a login prompt, or the time it takes between startup and running your first interactive command, or you may want to know how much time passes before init starts and this gives you a chance to run user-space code via the startup scripts, etc.\n\nA: You might want to take a look at BootChart. It has probably more features than you need, but from what I remember has what you are looking for. \nhttp://ccm.net/faq/4268-ubuntu-monitor-your-boot-sequence-with-bootchart\n\nA: Type in console;\nlast -x | grep boot\nand also you may want to use;\nlast -x | grep shutdown\nlast -x | grep reboot\nFor boot inf;\ncat var/log/boot.log\nor\nless var/log/boot.log\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS: Need a way to recover from a system freeze I encounter often (deleting folders) Quick bit of context:\n\n\n*\n\n*This is a machine I use at work, and I have to use 12.04 LTS. I know it's old at this point, but I can't go to a newer version.\n\n*I don't know much about the inner workings of the OS or how best to troubleshoot/fix things since I only use it at work.\nThe problem is trivial to reproduce for me on this machine, all it takes is deleting a folder (from the terminal) that I currently have open in \"Files\" (nautilus?).\nI get a popup message that the folder is invalid (\"the location is not a folder\"), and everything freezes.\nI can still move the mouse, but I can't click on anything.\nI can switch to a fullscreen terminal with Ctrl+Alt+F2... but I can't figure out how to unfreeze my GUI.\nUsually I am forced to reboot.\nThis happens to me fairly often because I sometimes have a folder in the build path for what I'm working on open in \"Files\" (nautilus?) and run the \"clean\" command in our build system which deletes that folder.\nIt's extremely frustrating.\nIs there a reliable way to fix my gui when this happens without having to reboot? I tried using 'top' and killing random processes (including nautilus) but it never seems to really fix it.\nIdeally, of course, this would never happen in the first place, I can't believe the file manager can't cleanly deal with a folder being deleted from under it. Maybe there's something in the way these machines are configured that causes it.\n\nA: This happens to me often. After Ctrl-Alt-F2, I do this at full screen terminal\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nThis brings me back to login and saves a full restart.\n\nA: To kill any GUI program which freezes use xkill command.\nxkill is very useful in situations like these. I suggest you make a xkill keyboard shortcut.\n", "Q: Dell Precision 7910 Ubuntu 14.04 freezes I am currently running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (fresh install) on a Dell Precision 7910.  When I attempt to do any heavy analysis (ie. processing 4-10 large files at one time), the machine completely freezes.  Neither the mouse nor keyboard respond, and I end up doing a hard reboot.  ALT + PrtScn + R E I S U B did not do anything.\nI looked at the log files, but there is nothing there from the time of the freeze.\nAlthough I am quickly able to reproduce this problem running a particular java program called GATK, I have also run into it while running C programs.  Sometimes it freezes right away, and other times it takes 20-30 minutes.\nThe Dell ePSA diagnostics test and memtest86+ test both passed.\nCan anyone provide a step-by-step way to figure out what may be causing the system to freeze?\nThanks for your help!\nRC\n\nA: I would start further investigating by monitoring system resources leading up to the freeze. Basic tools like htop or top, and iotop work well. Maybe RAM or swap is filling up, or disk I/O is being held by 1 process? \nYou can try setting the CPU affinity of your intensive process, or setting its niceness (I believe there is I/O niceness as well), to try to prevent resource starvation for kernel/system processes.\n\nA: After hours of googling, I read something similar where a complete system freeze was caused by some sort of error in the processor clock (?).  I went into the BIOS and disabled the \"Intel Hyperthreading Technology\", and this seems to have fixed it.  Although my machine now shows 8 cores, rather than 16 cores, it is no longer crashing.  I can live with this, however, if anyone has any ideas on how to enable the hyperthreading without major crashes, I would love to try it.\nThanks,\nRC\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 will NOT run on HP DV2845se with dual core AMD Turion and nvidia 630M graphics I have been an Ubuntu user for about 5 years and have had Ubuntu on the subject laptop the entire time. Yes I have had some trials and tribulations with the nvidia hardware but always managed to make it run. \nWith 15.04(3.19 kernel) no matter what I do ( and I have been in all the trenches) the computer will either black screen with the recommended nvidia 304.125 driver or I get GPU lockup with nouveau on a clean install. \nI have even done a clean install of 14.04 (on which it was running fine) but at the first update (kernel 3.16) here we go again with nouveau lock ups or nvidia black screens. \nI have tried everything I can find over the last 2-3 weeks-all sorts of manual installs and NOTHING works. \nAnybody got any suggestions? I am currently reduced to 12.04 as 14.04 will no longer run either. \n\nA: I had to drop back to Lubuntu from Ubuntu after the Ubuntu 14.04 updates left the system too glitchy.  The Nouveau driver worked under Lubuntu, but ran too hot, but the Nvidia 304.125 was better (still warm, but runnable).  Unity is the killer for you, try another desktop, and that might be your solution also.  \n\nI did succeed in getting Ubuntu 14.04 to run by installing xfce4 and removing all the unity packages.  Dual booting that now with Lubuntu, still deciding which I like better.  Getting xfce4 installed needed to be done at a virtual terminal since there was no usable GUI until unity was totally removed.  There did seem to be some sort of glitch on the Nvidia 304 driver install -- from the GUI additional drivers it looked like it worked, but checking the actual modules the only Nvidia driver was the frame buffer one, not the normal nvidia-304.  A simple apt-get --reinstall install on it did set things right, no idea what the problem was, but do check on what video module is in use as you are working on this (with lsmod).\n", "Q: How can 'system monitor' can be turned into as powerful as Task manager of Windows in Ubuntu14.04? When I use heavy software sometimes my computer gets hanged. I have shut down my laptop holding the power key. Is it possible to open system monitor by keyboard shortcut like what we do in windows by ctrl+alt+delete?\nI am trying to mean that, even in hanged stated if I press ctrl+alt+delete the task manager appears and from there I can stop problematic programs successfully. But the system monitor is not that powerful in ubuntu. When ubuntu gets hanged I have no other option to restart it manually. Even I cannot open terminal by ctrl+alt+T.\n\nI need the system monitor or the terminal to be that powerful to appear on hanged situation by keyboard shortcuts.\n\nA: I'm not aware of something for Linux that is as mighty as Window's Task Manager. \nTry htop, this will most likely do what you are looking for - according to the headline of this post More information about htop on wikipedia.\nYou can simply install htop via Ubuntu's Software Center.\nOnce htop is installed, start the terminal CTRL+ALT+t and enter htop in the terminal.\nhtop is a very powerful tool for managing and monitoring processes on your Linux. \n\nA: If you go to System Settings->Keyboard you can set up shortcuts manually on one of the tabs (don't have my laptop in front of me to tell you exactly what the tab is called).\n", "Q: How do I properly install a python app that is not packaged (and without installer) Every few months I encounter an app (java, python, etc) that I would like to install in Ubuntu, but it doesn't come as a linux package, nor is there any included installer. It's not often that this happens and so I usually have forgotten the appropriate way to do it. Unfortunately, more times then not, the instalation instructions are like this, and really don't help much:\n\n...\n  Once you have extracted the program.zip and installed the required\n  dependencies, you should be able to run the application with this\n  command::\n      python /source/program-name.py\n  Preferable you create a shortcut on your platform that issues this\n  command.\n\nCould someone tell me (step-by-step) how to install python apps, as if they had been installed with a \"standard\" package manager (as a ubuntu/debian package)? (I was hoping there was a simpler way to do this, rather then having to create a package myself -- even something like what I do when installing an app with source files -- ./configure->make->make install).\n1) where should I install (move?) python files (does it matter if it uses Python2 or Python3, should I install locally or for all users), \n2) do I change the Python file/folder permissions  \n3) how do I create a menu item with an icon\n4) and anything else to properly install the app (including steps so that I can uninstall and upgrade without problems)\nI have always hoped that someone would create a script or gui that would walk me through these steps... if there is such a thing, then disregard the above and just let me know the name of the app and where to find it.\n\nA: You don't actually have to \"install\" the app. Python apps are interpreted, which means the source code is pretty much executable.\nIn order to run the source code, for a file that is in ~/AppName/ called AppName.py, you can open a command line and just type\npython ~/AppName/AppName.py\n\nAnd that will launch your Application in whatever version of python came with your version of Ubuntu. You can turn this into a desktop shortcut pretty easily... But I'm not in Ubuntu right now, so I can't give you precise instructions, sorry about that.\n\n\n*\n\n*Put the files wherever you want, as long as you can navigate to the path and have permissions there.\n\n*You probably don't need to change any permissions.\n\n*This should be pretty easy, but I'm not in linux right now, so hopefully somebody else will edit this part in... sorry.\n\n*Nothing else. You didn't install it, so just remove the files and the shortcut you made, and it will be gone. Upgrading might involve upgrading python, but probably won't. \n\n\nA: I've found a great way to install python apps in Ubuntu. \nLets say we have an app, app.py. First, make this file executable by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adding the proper shebang to the top of the file. For Python3 apps add #!/usr/bin/env python3 to the very top of the file if it isn't already there. For Python2 apps add #!/usr/bin/env python instead.\n\n*Next, change the file permissions to allow execution by any user $ chmod a+x app.py\nIf you have an executable python prog, for example one made from pyinstaller or the likes, you can skip the previous steps and just mv the executable instead in the next steps.\nAt this point you could simply save this file wherever you want and execute it directly in the terminal with # /path/to/file. BUT, that's not how apps are typically installed... The proper way IMO is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*move the file to the /usr/bin/ directory. This is where much of the executable code goes for other apps installed with apt or other methods. Use this command to do so: $ mv app.py /usr/bin/app. After that you can execute the app at any time from any directory in the terminal by simply running: # app. Notice I dropped the \".py\" from the file when moving it... this is optional, whatever you name the file when moving it becomes the command to run it...\n\n*Many people might stop here... But I prefer this last step for my apps. Create a desktop file touch app.desktop. A simple desktop file contains the following: \n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=App\nComment=My custom app\nExec=app\nIcon=/path/to/some/optional/icon.png\nTerminal=false\n\nExec should be set to whatever you named the file in the previous step when moving to the usr/bin/ driectory. the Icon field is optional. If you need to see the terminal to use the app set Terminal to true.\nSave this file to the /usr/share/applications/ directory with $ mv app.desktop /usr/share/applications/\nAt this point, you should be able to hit the super(windows) key and start typing the name (the one you listed in the .desktop file) and see your application pop-up as an option... hitting enter or clicking it with your mouse should launch it. You can right click on the option and add to favorites if you'd like.\nTo see an example hello world python app and it's corresponding desktop file and install bash script see my project at: Hello_project\n\nA: I agree, it is a simple way to do it, which is similar to my approach.\nSome time ago I wrote a small bash script to install to ~/.local/...\nBelow is the script, which you will need to edit to suit your installation:\n#! /bin/bash\n## #############################################\n## Install simpelregner application:\n## simpelregner.py         ---> $HOME/.local/bin/\n## simpelregner.ui         ---> $HOME/.local/bin/simpelregner/\n## simpelregner-64.png     ---> $HOME/.local/bin/simpelregner/\n## simpelregner.desktop    ---> $HOME/.local/share/applications/\n## By Carl Friis-Hansen\n## #############################################\n\n## -------- Get path of this script --------\nDIR=\"$( cd \"$( dirname \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\" )\" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd )\"\nAPPNAME=\"simpelregner\"\n\n## -------- Write the .desktop launcher file --------\necho \\\n\"[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nEncoding=UTF-8\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nName=$APPNAME\nExec=$HOME/.local/bin/$APPNAME.py\nPath=\nComment=Simpel Regner\nIcon=$HOME/.local/bin/$APPNAME/$APPNAME-64.png\nName[en]=simplecalculator\"\\\n | tee $HOME/.local/share/applications/$APPNAME.desktop\n## -------- Executable .desktop launcher file --------\nchmod +x $HOME/.local/share/applications/$APPNAME.desktop\n\n## -------- Copy the rest of the files --------\ncp $DIR/$APPNAME.py $HOME/.local/bin/$APPNAME.py\nchmod +x $HOME/.local/bin/$APPNAME.py\nmkdir -p $HOME/.local/bin/$APPNAME\ncp $DIR/$APPNAME.ui $HOME/.local/bin/$APPNAME/$APPNAME.ui\ncp $DIR/$APPNAME-64.png $HOME/.local/bin/$APPNAME/$APPNAME-64.png\ncp $HOME/.local/share/applications/$APPNAME.desktop $HOME/Desktop/$APPNAME.desktop\n\n## -------- Done, so message to user --------\necho\necho \"-----------------------------------------------------------------\"\necho \"Simple Regner simpelregner er nu installeret\"\necho\necho \"Dobbeltklik på desktop ikonen simpelregner, enten på desktoppen eller i menuen.\"\necho \"Første gang må du svare på, om du accepterer at køre programmet.\"\necho \"-----------------------------------------------------------------\"\necho\n\n", "Q: Selected manual install and now grub can't find moddep files I recently re-built my PC and decided to re-install my OS'es.\nI had Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04, now I'm installing Windows 10 and Ubuntu 15.04.\nI followed this guide:\nhttp://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2014/05/install-ubuntu-1404-alongside-windows.html\nI was not able to select \"install alongside windows\", so I did a manual install.\nIn grub, I now see:\n*Ubuntu\nAdvanced options for Ubuntu\nMemory test (memtest86+)\nMemory test (memtest86+, serial console 115200)\nWindows Recovery Environment (loader) (on /dev/sda1)\n\nI choose \"Ubuntu\" and I get:\nstarting version 219\ncould not open moddep file '/lib/modules/3.16.0-34-generic/modules.dep.bin'\ncould not open moddep file '/lib/modules/3.16.0-34-generic/modules.dep.bin'\n[    2.661604] usb 2-1.17: device descriptor read/64, error -32\nGave up waiting for root device.

It says something about \"/dev/dsk/by/uuid/92c34803-4e28-89c7-78480f11df455 does not exist\" which usually means the Grub configuration file is bad. I had a similar problem when I installed Ubuntu Mate 14.04 LTS but Boot Repair Disk solved that for me.\nHowever, I do wonder too why you abandoned an LTS version? By the way, I used that installation guide too. It suggests creating an external home partition. This way you can reinstall Ubuntu and keep your application settings.\nHope it works out for you.\n\nA: Make sure that when you create the bootable USB drive, make sure the downloaded ISO is not corrupt.

How to change their appearances? \nIn gnome-terminal, I can change their looks by editting $HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css, but it's not working for terminator.\nUPDATE:\nThe tabs is a little bit thick and the background color is white so it's too conspicuous. \n\nA: Update: terminator also uses gtk in background so check your version of terminator using:\nterminator -v\n\nIf it is version 0.97 then make changes in the gtk2 file because it uses gtk2, and Ubuntu uses gtk3 so you have to change in both files.\nFor the theme check use:\ngsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme \n\nthen change the following in /usr/share/themes/<YOUR_THEME>/gtk-2.0/gtkrc:\nstyle \"notebook_bg\" {\n  bg[NORMAL] = shade (1.02, @bg_color)\n  bg[ACTIVE] = shade (0.97, @bg_color)\n  fg[ACTIVE] = mix (0.8, @fg_color, shade (0.97, @bg_color))\n}\n\nReplace @bg_color in bg[NORMAL] with a color of your choice, e.g., \"#F98686\"(quotes required).\nTo make changes in gtk3, open ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css (if it doesn't exist then create it):\nTerminalWindow .notebook tab:active{\n  background-color: @bg_color;\n}\n\nSave it and reopen the terminal.\nFor other change :\nright click on terminator screen --> preferences \n\nHere  you can change terminator appearance that you want to change like custom profile, layouts, plug-ins, colors, etc. Once you add a new configuration it will create configuration files under ~/.config/terminator/.\nEdit :\nfor color change : \npreferences --> profiles--> colors \n\nfor layout change :\npreferences --> profiles--> Layouts--> Add--> give name --> close\n\nIt will create config file ~/.config/terminator/config \nopen this file using \ngedit ~/.config/terminator/config\n\nChange size and other things that you want in this file. You can also change color from this file.\nreference :link\nNote : Kindly re-launch the application for the changes to take effect.\n\nA: The accepted answer seems to be quite outdated and doesn't work with newer Ubuntu versions.\nTo change the look of tabs in terminator have a look at the following post:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/50082359/terminator-1-91-change-tab-theme-color-using-gtk3-css\nThe following settings worked for me:\n/* ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css */\n\n.terminator-terminal-window notebook tab {\n  background-color: darkgrey;\n  padding: 0;\n  border: 0;\n}\n.terminator-terminal-window notebook tab:checked {\n  background-image: none;\n  background-color: #459cc4;\n}\n.terminator-terminal-window notebook tab button {\n  padding: 0;\n}\n\nThe following blog shows some more customization settings:\nhttp://blog.nabam.net/workstation/2017/09/15/terminator_tabs\n", "Q: Is there any command in Linux which does not make a system call? I was reading about system calls and I got a doubt whether any command runs without making even a single system call. If not then what is the command with minimum number of system calls? I used strace for some commands but it is giving some long list. Can someone tell me such a command?\n\nA: /bin/true and /bin/false should be the preinstalled commands with the least system calls.\nYou could save some system calls by static linking:\nSave the following as e.g. minimal.c\nint main() {\n    return 0;\n}\n\nand compile it using\ngcc --static -o minimal minimal.c\n\nThis will get you the program minimal in your current working folder.\n\nA: Speaking about what syscalls are actually executed in order to \"run\" (\"run\" therefore interpreted in an acceptation wider than the acceptation you're probably referring to) a program, no: for one, the execve() syscall is always executed just to run the command (in this case I think we're better off talking about executable) itself, and the exit() syscall is always executed upon main()'s return:\n\nthe C compiler places a call to exit() after main() returns\n\n(Source)\nTo somehow address your question, which is executable-dependent and hence very broad: as a proof-of-concept to state that probably any executable actually useful will make use of at least one syscall, it's worthwhile to state that, for one, an exit() syscall is very likely to be executed from the program itself in case of errors; not to mention that any executable opening / closing a file descriptor will make use of the open() / close() syscalls.\nIn the end in any command actually useful there will very likely be at least one syscall (e.g. such as exit() if the program experiences an error during the execution and / or open() / close() if the command has to read a file whatsoever).\n\nA: Yes. There are a few commands that run without making any system calls.\nOne prerequisite of such commands is that they are built into the shell (bash, for my system). This eliminates both the setup overhead (a number of system calls performed by the linker and libc to set up the environment for the code to run) and the eventual exit() call.\nstrace will not help you identify these commands, though, since they are not actual programs. There is no file that corresponds with built-in commands, and so if strace does find the command, it will be an external version, complete with the setup and teardown any process entails.\nThe bash command help lists all available internal commands. Note that many of these make system calls, as well. Some that don't use system calls:\n\n\n*\n\n*function\n\n*for\n\n*declare\n\n*true (the built-in version; not /bin/true)\n\n*false (the built-in version; not /bin/false)\n\n*shift\n\n*set\n\n*case\n\n*alias / unalias\n\n*set / unset\nIn general... if a command is internal to the shell, reads no input, writes no output, and only works with variables in memory, it probably doesn't use a syscall.\n\nA: System calls are the only way the program can communicate with the outside world, including announcing that it has run to completion.\nSo a program that does not use any system calls has no observable effect, and cannot terminate or relinquish the CPU, and thus must run forever using full CPU power. Not very useful.\n\nA: There isn't a lot a program can meaningfully do without making any system calls at all. System calls is the primary method through which a program communicates with anything outside the program itself.\nCommunicating through memory mapped files or shared memory is possible, but it still requires system calls to set this up in the first place. Afterwards it can be used to communicate without further system calls.\nA program can receive information from the outside through signals. But if no signal handler is installed the signal would just kill the program, and installing the signal handler in the first place requires a system call. In principle a program also need to make a system call at the end of processing a received signal, but if the signal was set up to not block signals at receipt, then leaving the signal handler could be done without a system call. This is more of a curiosity than a meaningful technique with real life applications.\nA program which doesn't make any system calls will be consuming all the CPU time it can get because sleeping (in most cases) requires a system call. A program can be sleeping because it is waiting for mapped pages to be loaded from disk. But without system calls the only mapped pages to be loaded would be the executable itself, which would soon be cached.\nWhile running the program can make partial results visible to other programs by modifying its own command line or environment variables. Those can be modified without a system call.\nEven a normal termination of a program involves a system call. But a program can trigger a signal to terminate without a system call. Signals which could possibly be triggered include SIGILL, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGSEGV.\nGiven all of this it would be possible to write a program which when started would do some calculations on the values provided on the command line and eventually terminate through a different signal depending on the result of that calculation. This is not the most useful way to indicate the result of a calculation, but it is certainly possible.\n", "Q: I can't update my system ubuntu 14.4 minna@minna-System-Product-Name:~$ sudo apt-get updates\n[sudo] password for minna: \nE: Invalid operation updates\nminna@minna-System-Product-Name:~$ sudo apt-get install updates\nReading package lists...

I'd bought a combo keyboard and mouse, just like yours with a usb receiver. The first time I plugged it in, it was not working, the whole set. \nYet, your case looks a little bit different to me. Your keyboard is working but mouse is not. So, first, check if there is any hardware/manufacturing problem with the device. This is pretty common. It could be anywhere from battery issues to receiver problem.\nNext, here are some more things you can do:-\n\n\n*\n\n*Check if there is any need of drivers. Or, you could use the software and updates app in Ubuntu to install drivers for 3rd party.\n\n*Try plugging the device to another machine (windows or linux) . If it also does not respond, consider getting it replaced, it might be faulty.\n\n*Try to run a linux distro live (ubuntu or another one), and then check if the mouse works. This happened once. My mouse was not working with Opensuse, but on trying it with Fedora live, it worked seamlessly.\n\n\nThis is all I have as far the case of the mouse is concerned. I hope it helps you ! \n\nA: I have a wireless mouse with usb dongle (cdrking). Works fine when plugged to a 32 bit peppermint linux.\nOn my 64 bit 14.04 ubuntu it wouldn't work when plugged in directly to a USB3.0 port on my laptop. But, it works when plugged through a 4-port usb2.0 hub extension. This is just a workaround instead of having to buy a new mouse.\n\nA: Have you tried this:\n gsettings set org.gnome.settings-plugin.cursor KEY=active VALUE=true\n\nand it might work fine this way.\n", "Q: How to install Skype I have downloaded Skype for Ubuntu from official website http://www.skype.com/en/ \nWhen I try to open it, file automatically running trough \"Ubuntu Software Center\".

Here is my partition list.\n\n/dev/ubuntu-vg/root is not in the Partition list and I think it is some where inside the /dev/sda5. Ext2Fsd identifies the file-system of this partition as RAW.\nPlease let me know if there is a way to access this Partition from Windows 10.\n\nA: There is many ways to do it. This are the best two ways.\n1- If you want to show the ext partition in my computer use \"Ext2Fsd\"\nfor download  Click here\nYou can have Ext2Fsd launch at every boot or only open it when you need it. While you can theoretically enable support for writing to Linux partitions, I haven’t tested this. I’d be worried about this option, myself – a lot can go wrong. Read-only support is fine, though, and doesn’t have a risk of messing anything up.\nIf you didn’t set Ext2Fsd to autostart at boot, you’ll have to go into Tools –> Service Management and start the Ext2Fsd service before you can access your Linux files. By default, the driver automatically mounts and assigns drive letters to your Linux partitions, so you don’t have to do anything extra.\n2- If you want to explore your ext partition in an app use \"Ext2explore\"\nIt’s an open-source application that works similarly to DiskInternals Linux Reader — but only for Ext4, Ext3, and Ext2 partitions. It also lacks file previews, but it has one advantage: it doesn’t have to be installed; you can just download the .exe and run it.\nThe Ext2explore.exe program must be run as administrator or you’ll get an error – you can do this from the right-click menu. To save some time in the future, go into the file’s properties window and enable the “Run this program as an administrator” option on the Compatibility tab.\nAs with Linux Reader, you’ll have to save a file or directory to your Windows system before you can open it in other programs.\nFor download Click here\n", "Q: Preventing the dd command on extra drives I use dd a lot day to day for writing Raspberry Pi SD card images. \nHowever every now and then I slip and by accident dd the wrong partition and thus  killing my other drives.\nI was wondering if there was a way to be able to block writing using dd to say /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc.\n\nA: This is Linux, so it's easy.

Have I done something wrong?\n\nA: First of all it looks like you downloaded an OEM version of Ubuntu.\nI suggest installing a normal version from www.ubuntu.com.\nAlso after you installed Ubuntu you need to boot from your HDD, not from the installation media.

I think Microsoft finally got it right with windows and I'm ready to upgrade my windows OS to 10. The only issue is that I do not want to lose my Ubuntu partition. Is there anything that I need to know before upgrading?\n\nA: Windows 10 will overwrite your GRUB, but you can simply recover it with a live CD.

It is usually /dev/sda or /dev/sdb. Then run \"grub-install \".\n\nA: Upgrading to Windows 10 from Windows 7 will only replace the boot manager with the Windows one. If it asks you for the partitioning, be sure to select ONLY the Windows partition. If you want to use the Windows 10 Boot Manager, it's OK, but you have to add the boot entry for Ubuntu to it.

While compiz is running, open a terminal and type:\nsleep 10;metacity --replace\nnow lock your screen and wait, you will see compiz end and metacity comes in, in an unlocked state.\nWhat I expected was that compiz would not allow anything like that to happen, while it is locked. (and if it crashes while locked, it should take X together with it, and so all running applications)\nIn the other hand, if you lock your screen using XScreenSaver, metacity will still replace compiz, but screen will remain locked (but have its flaws too, see the comments)!\nIt seems the compiz screen lock runs under compiz (dependent on it) while XScreenSaver is another independent process/instance; did I just bumped into a security problem?\nObs.: Compiz version: 1:0.9.11.3+14.04.20150122-0ubuntu1\nPS.: I have metacity, and also jwm as when using some 3D applications, these work better when compiz is not running (here at least).\n\nA: Basically, if someone has access to the user's terminal, there is no level of security.\nFor example, a user could use htop to kill xscreensaver. \nAlso, if a user gains access to the terminal, they should need a password.\nThe fix is to use a strong password and sign out of tty whenever you are done.\n", "Q: Errors executing Visual Studio Code in 14.04 I'm using Ubuntu Server 14.04 64bit with Putty and xming to ssh into.

Read that it is not a virus.. came from saving files from ubuntu in newvolumeG.\nWas going smoothly except for a few unity issues. Which i was slowly learning to get rid of.. to get my convenient desktop back. Had swap partitions with missing UUID.. \ndev/mapper/cryptswap not found error was there.. \n.bashrc file showed a filename instead of a uuid of the sda6 or 8. There were two swap partitions.. one with 2 gb another with 5 gb. None were used after the error started to show up as i guess after i checked disk-utility.\nA few days ago i unpluged LAN cable. Was doing some offlne reading of offline saved web pages on unity issues. Net was not needed. And i sometimes do. \nWithin 24 hrs a strange ticking sound started like when a cd gets stuck.\nI got afraid and closed the lid.

It's usually the last entry in the boot order, so it means your hard drive isn't being seen. The clicking sound and this boot problem lead me to believe that your hard drive is dead. You're almost definitely going to have to take it in to have the drive cloned or the data taken off. If you have another computer though, you might be able to make an Ubuntu LiveUSB, boot from that and then copy your important files to another USB drive, before buying a new hard drive and reinstalling Windows and Ubuntu. I recommend the professional drive transfer, though.\n\nA: I think i have guessed the reason now. Last night i opened my valuable harddisk filled with memories of people i may never meet again.. the last voices.. the first interactions... expressions... copies of important documents.. programs.. and plans... etc. But they are best left inside my mind.\nMay be i was mad too and went crazily daring. Took as much precaution as i could.. created a stand to safely keep the HDD.\nThe inside was filled with tiny small black remnants. The coarsed thin rubber sides was clearly visible. The head was aside... not on the disk. And it could not go radially inward beyond a certain radius.. as i very very gently tried to slide it over the disk. There was initially no line of scratch on the disk but my trial did leave a tiny mark. Ya... I ruined it further.\nThe rubber may got coarsed from extreme heat to hv undergone continuous power flow for more than 24 hrs.. quite reoeatedly over tge last few months.\nOr ants got inside through spaces.. ya am having a breakout of very small red ants in my place. And choaked the movement of head and died. Do not hv enough knowledge or set up to test the residue. May be a rubber solvent or protein solvent could tell me. But i had none.\nSo i focussed cleaning up by blowing air as carefully as possible.. not touching anything.. and set everything back to turn it on to see if the ticking persists.. ya. It persisted. The head was not able to move inner most region.\nOnly possibility is that the spindle got higher enough before i closed the lid on thursday. And it got stopped right then as the power was off... i had no battery charge left in the lappy. And may be it expects the head to be at default reading position at the beginning of each start up. Do not know the rest. I opened it up and now saw a ring of scratch near the inner rim. I rotated the spindle following the thumb rule to try it last time to get it in the reading sector.. i could not.. as i suppose .. match the rpm of 5400. Even trying for hours.\nSo bottomline.. i ruined everything.. may be all data is lost forever... nothing to do apart from using live usb stick. And it is serving me well for now.\nHope this information helps you. But i wd say go to extreme to know it. Do Explicitly All for what you love and care. Human beings and memories of them are worth any possible disaster that may come in the way.. break the norms.\nThough i feel sort of numb.. but i think they wd cradle me with love being there by my side for whom i just could not leave it on some strangers and did all i could at the moment... \nOr should i just hv waited?? In patience? \nBoth feels correct.\n", "Q: Simple, plug-and-play live USB instalation , step-by-step?

When I turn on my computer, I see the grub2.02 command line. It says \"GNU GRUB version 2.02~beta2-15\nMinimal BASH-like editing is supported. For the first word, TAB lists possible command completions... \" etc.\nAfter much googling and trying different chainloading commands, I still couldn't find a way to boot back into windows. I also tried booting from an ubuntu recovery usb, but I couldn't figure out how to get GRUB to recognize/boot the usb.\nIs there a way to get back to my laptops BIOS/UEFI so I can change the boot settings? I would hate to loose my memory; my music isn't backed up anywhere. \nMy laptop:\nASUS x550-la,\nintel i7, preinstalled with windows 8 64bit.\n\nA: The problem is caused by the fact that a part of the GRUB boot loader remains installed on the computer, and is being launched by default. Unfortunately, the way Ubuntu sets up GRUB causes it to rely on files located on the Ubuntu partition, and since you've deleted that partition, those files effectively no longer exist.\nThere are several possible solutions to this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*You may be able to launch your firmware setup utility and use it to delete the Ubuntu entry or re-order the entries so that the Windows entry comes first. Unfortunately, the details of how to enter the firmware setup utility vary from one machine to another. Most use Del or a function key early in the boot process, but details vary. Some make this very hard. Furthermore, the details of how to modify the boot order vary from one to another. Thus, you'll just have to poke around or ask on a manufacturer forum to learn how to do it this way.\n\n*There is a way to exit from GRUB, but I don't recall the precise command -- try exit, quit, or synonyms of that. Exiting from GRUB should cause the next boot loader in the NVRAM list to launch. This will probably be the Windows boot loader, so you should be able to get into Windows in this way. This won't solve the problem permanently, but can be a step to a solution.\n\n*The firmware's built-in boot manager should be able to bypass GRUB. As with the firmware setup utility, this is accessed by a system-specific keypress -- usually Esc or a function key.\n\n*If you can boot to Windows by exiting GRUB or by using the firmware's own boot manager, you can launch an Administrator Command Prompt window (by right-clicking the Command Prompt icon and selecting \"Run as Administrator\" from the options). Typing bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\Microsoft\\boot\\bootmgfw.efi should then reset the Windows boot loader as the default.\n\n*If you can boot Windows, you can try using the third-party EasyUEFI tool to adjust your boot priority list. Move the Windows option to the top of the list.\n\n*You can boot a Linux emergency disk (such as an Ubuntu installer) and use efibootmgr to set the default boot loader and/or delete the Ubuntu entry. Type sudo efibootmgr, then use sudo efibootmgr -o ####,####,#### to set the boot order. For instance, if Windows is Boot0003, you'd type sudo efibootmgr -o 0003 (and optionally add others in a comma-delimited list) to set Windows first.\n\n*You can boot to any OS, mount the EFI System Partition, and delete GRUB, which resides in EFI/ubuntu -- delete that entire directory, in fact.\n\n\n*\n\n*In a Linux emergency disk, you'll need to figure out which partition your ESP is by using gdisk, parted, or some other tool. It's usually the first or second partition on the disk, and it always uses the FAT filesystem. In gdisk, it's got a type code of EF00; and in parted, it has its \"boot flag\" set. Mount it with mount, as in sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt.\n\n*In Windows, typing mountvol S: /S in an Administrator Command Prompt window should mount the ESP at S: -- but only from within that window, so you'll need to use text-mode commands to delete the directory.\n\n\n", "Q: How to Convert All The .MOV Videos To .MP4 in folder using ubuntu 14.04 i am a newbie can anyone help how to easily convert all the .mov files in my /var/sentora/hostdata/zadmin/public_html/ctkdonline_com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08 folder need to convert all the .MOV files to .MP4 please help :)\n\nA: Here are the proper methods:\nStream copy\nIf you simply want to re-mux instead of re-encode, and if the input streams are compatible with MP4, you can just stream copy.

It uses a 0-8 step brightness scale where 0 is the least bright and 8 is the brightest.  0 is too bright for my comfort level especially at night\nFollowing the suggestion in an answer below I added the following to etc/default/grub:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"resume=UUID=8bcb4169-f5ab-4ab6-b644-23e528088d41 acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\nand updated grub\nMy screen brightness did not go any dimmer than it had before.

With the second command in terminal my screen went darker than it ever has.  I then tested:\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --brightness 0.9\n\nWhich got me back to the usual lowest level.  This appears to be changing contrast levels not brightness, which is exactly what I was asking about.

I'm working with ROS indigo on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, which automatically installs OpenCV 2.4.8 on my Linux machine. I'm very new to how Ubuntu works, so I really don't want to mess with the OpenCV that's already installed on my machine.\nI do however, want to see whether one of my programs still works with OpenCV 3.0, so I'd like to install OpenCV 3.0 and link to that instead in my CMakeLists.txt. Is there any way I an install OpenCV 3.0 without messing with the OpenCV 2.4.8 that's already on my machine so I can experiment with both? \nThanks \n\nA: Go to OpenCV documentation here and follow the steps. \nThe only change is in Step 2. The cmake command should be modified to suit your needs:\ncmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX= ..\nYou existing installation should be in /usr/local, so use a different folder, for example you can create one in your home directory. \nHere is how you compile with your new version of OpenCV:\nCreate a folder for your project. It should have the .cpp file and another file names CMakeLists.txt with the following contents:\nCPP = g++\n\nCPPFLAGS = -L</path/to/opencv3.0.0/lib> \\\n       -I</path/to/opencv3.0.0/include>\n\nall: <name-of-.cpp-file>\n     $(CPP) $(CPPFLAGS) $^ -o $@\n\nThere are three changes you need to make to this file. In the folder to which you installed OpenCV, there will be two directories by the name 'libs' and 'include'. You should put those in lines 2 and 3 respectively. Then in the second last line, put the name of your cpp file.\nTo compile your project, in a terminal, cd to you project folder and type make. The output binary file will be created in the same folder. \nSource - StackOverflow\n\nA: You should be able to just put the OpenCV download into a directory, run cmake there and make it.

But I seem to have run in to a bit of a problem.\nI am going to use this computer for mostly programming. However, I am also going to need it for schoolwork as well. To meet both requirements, I have decided to do a dual boot with both windows and Ubuntu. But when I went to set up my disk partitions, the disk manager only let me cut my windows partition in half.\nA quick google search told me that this was because windows put some really important files that are required to boot windows in the middle of their disk space. Not the way I would have done it.\nAnyway, a simple solution would be to just do what windows wants and simply cut the drive in half. With a 1 terabyte hard drive, I'm sure I would have plenty for Ubuntu.\nBut it seems wasteful doesn't it, setting aside more than half of your hard drive to an operating system you will use a lot less than half the time. Plus, I'm sure there are other people who would benefit from knowing the answer to this question.\nAll that I've found so far as to solutions that don't involve sketchy third-party software, is I could make a recovery disk of windows, install Ubuntu over windows, set up my partitions, reinstall windows with the recovery disk, and finally update grub. This solution could, in theory, work. Or go terribly wrong and ruin my brand new computer.\nIf anyone can think of any other, better ways to accomplish this goal, your advice would be hugely appreciated.\n\nA: Using Defraggler to defragment will allow you to move the files Windows places at the end of its disk space to make all files contiguous at the beginning. After using Defraggler, you will then be able to make the Windows partition much smaller. https://www.piriform.com/defraggler/download \nI have done this before, and it worked.\n\nA: I have followed the instructions found at this link in Windows 10 computers to shrink volumes beyond the point Windows initially shows. This part has to be done from the Windows side. It doesn't require third party software.  The link contains very detailed instructions and screenshots that are easy to follow.\nBasically, as @oldfred mentioned, you have to disable hibernation, disable pagefile, and disable system protection.  (It seems to me that the link he provides gives instructions for Windows Vista.  The link I provide works for windows 8 and 10).  Then you have to restart your computer and resize the partition using Windows.  You should be able to shrink the volume containing Windows beyond the point that you mentioned.\nYou can shrink the Windows volume even if Ubuntu is already installed and take advantage of the extra space.  Backup all your files and use GParted to move the partition that contains Ubuntu to the starting point of the space you have just made, and then extend the partition to use all the remaining space at the end.\n", "Q: Recover an partially(~5%) zero overwritten, external HDD with single partition I have an external Seagate HDD of 1TB. I was using the default partition it came with. Never repartitioned it.\nYesterday I accidentally started reformatting it instead of my other disk, with an option to overwrite with zeros. But then I quickly noticed my error and plugged out the HDD in a moment of panic.\nNow if I try running testdisk, I'm unable to find any partitions. Deeper search doesn't help too. Photorec is able to recover files. But since there are a lot of files and all without the original names or folders, it is turning out to be a re-organization nightmare.\nI just wanted to know if anything can be done to recreate the Partition table and recover the data(remaining 95% of the disk) with proper folder structures in the disk. Especially since my HDD had only one Partition(the default one), is there a weird tweak I could try?\n\nA: Likely the filesytem your external drive came with did not store additional file system details or recovery partition tables to ease recovery. Therefore, once the partition table, or the file allocation tables where overwritten by zeros I see little to no chance to recover these.\nTherefore you are faced with the cumbersome task to manually rename files recovered by PhotoRec to be able to use them again. \nFor some files such as photos, audio, video, or text documents there are tools to mass-rename them according to metatag information but still reconstructing the folder structure, or file dates would have to be done manually, and many file types can not be renamed by this.\n", "Q: Gnome is being incredibly unstable and applications are frequently crashing I don't know how this happened, after I updated my software everything on Gnome started breaking.

How can I fix this?\n\nA: OK. This is really a workaround, but it's the only way I can think of short of reinstalling completely. Since reconfiguring and reinstalling GNOME didn't work, I have to go with this.\nFirst, you need to install another desktop interface, such as KDE or Unity. I recommend Unity, since it shares a lot of packages with GNOME, and will be a smaller download. \n\n\n*\n\n*To install Unity, run sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^.\n\n*Log out and look for a gear icon or GNOME themed icon, usually near the login Window. Click this and choose the Unity option and log back in. You should now be in Unity.\n\n*Open a terminal and run sudo apt-get install lightdm and then sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm. Choose lightdm in the window that hopefully comes up. If it doesn't, comment and I'll help.\n\n*Run sudo apt-get remove --purge gnome-shell. Reboot.\n\n*After the reboot (your login screen will be different), run sudo apt-get install gnome-desktop-environment and then sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm to select gdm.\n\n*Reboot and hopefully you'll be back at the original login screen.\n\n*Click the icon to switch the desktop environment and choose GNOME before logging back in.\n\n\nHopefully everything will be fixed. If you want to remove Unity, just run sudo apt-get remove unity.\nIf you can't find the icon on the login screen or if the reconfigure commands don't work, tell me and I'll see if I can help.\n", "Q: Problem accessing the DNS I am using rtmpdump to download streaming video.

Also, when I try to modify config files for programs it comes up with a 'no permission' error. I am an administrator on my computer. How do I fix this?\n\nA: When at the Terminal and it asks you for a password, it seems that you're not writing, but actually you are.\nTry to write your password again and press Enter\n\nA: Terminal doesn't show password while you typing (not even Bullets or Stars)\nSo when it prompt for password, just type your password blindly, and press Enter\n\nA: Regarding your first question - this is normal UNIX behavior. It will not display anything while you type a password. It is \"concealed\". Trust that it is indeed there, and press Enter when you're finished typing. Since concealing like this is possible by using a simple ANSI escape code (the same method by which we color and bold text in the terminal), it is possible that it was used the a third-party developer as well.\nRegarding your second question - just because you're an administrator on the computer doesn't mean you can edit files outside of your home folder right off the bat. This is one of Linux's core security features. Being an administrator means that you can \"sudo\", that is, work as the system root. You have to outright tell the computer you want to work as sudo before you can in any given session, however. That's also for security reasons (and so you don't accidentally mess something up.)\nLet's say you want to edit /etc/foo.conf (that file doesn't actually exist...I made it up for the example.) You could not just say gedit /etc/foo.conf, as that would say \"No permission.\" Instead, you would have to run sudo gedit /etc/foo.conf and enter your login password if/when prompted.\nSince these are pretty normal things, my guess is that you're new-ish to the terminal. I recommend you read up on the basics. The Terminal is a powerful tool, but it is equally dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.\n\nA: Which password are you typing in? Your steam account or your user password on the computer? I imagine it's asking for a sudo command, and typing your steam password then would result »sorry, try again«\nAlthough, I agree with Serg that this sounds fishy. Steam starts terminal but doesn’t ask for my password.\n", "Q: How do you delete old ubuntu partitions? I have done a fresh install of Ubuntu 15.04 in order to upgrade from Ubuntu 14.10.

I will assume, though, that you are doing this as an exercise in learning shell scripting.\nTo fix the immediate problem, all you need is a second shell variable, here called new:\nfor file in *\ndo\n    new=$(echo \"$file\" | sed -e 's/  */_/g' -e 's/_-_/-/g')\n    mv -f \"$file\" \"$(echo \"$new\" | tr A-Z a-z)\"\ndone\n\nAnother approach is to extend the pipeline:\nfor file in *\ndo\n    mv -f \"$file\" \"$(echo \"$file\" | sed -e 's/  */_/g' -e 's/_-_/-/g' | tr A-Z a-z)\"\ndone\n\nIf you have GNU sed, then the pipeline can be simplified further:\nfor file in *\ndo\n    mv -f \"$file\" \"$(echo \"$file\" | sed -e 's/  */_/g' -e 's/_-_/-/g' -e 's/.*/\\L&/')\"\ndone\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*Since you used the -f option to mv, it is possible that this script will cause files in your directory to be overwritten and their contents lost.\n\n*Consider using $(...) in place of backquotes for command substitution.  The dollar-parens form nests well, it is visually clear, and it avoids that confusion that happens because many fonts don't show a clear difference between back ticks and regular ticks.\n\n*Many languages require a semicolon at the end of each command.  shell is not one of those languages: the newline character ends a command just the way a semicolon does.\n", "Q: How to paste the text selected from gui mode after switching into cli mode? I have set up ubuntu-14.10 to boot up in text mode (cli) and I start gui with the command sudo service lightdm start then toggle between gui and cli mode with Alt+ctrl+F1 (to get into cli) and Alt Gr + LEFT ( to get into gui mode).\nHow can I paste the selected text from gui and toggle to cli mode and then paste it there (especially in vim)?\nNote- I have tried ctrl+shift+v , ctrl+shift+insert,ctrl+y ctrl+v but none of them are working. I have modified my .bashrc\nso that it starts tmux inside cosole upon startup. I don't know if this has anything to do with tmux so please guide me?\n\nA: \nHow can I paste the selected text from gui and toggle to cli mode and\n  then paste it there (especially in vim)?\n\nIf your goal is to go directly from GUI to TTY and paste, that's impossible. You have to have something in the middle, something in common between tty and gui. \nTerminal multiplexers such as screen, tmux, and byobu allow creating shared sessions.  That means, if you run screen in graphical terminal emulator, then login to TTY1 and attach yourself to the shared session, everything you type in GUI will show up on TTY1 as well. \nThe two terminals will behave as one\nNote: taking screenshot form TTY is difficult, so for demonstration purposes I will create shared session between two GUI terminals.\nOf course, the 3 multiplexers don't come with Ubuntu by default. If you want to get either one, install them with sudo apt-get install app-name. Note, that installing byobu gives you all 3 together.\nGNU SCREEN\n\n\n*\n\n*Start screen session in TTY1.\n\n*Press Ctrl+a, then :. type multiuser on\n\n\n*Return to GUI. Open terminal emulator. Type screen -ls to list sessions.\n\n*Type screen -x and the id of the session you found with -ls command. \n\nNow you should have 2 shared screen sessions\n\nTMUX\n\n\n*\n\n*Start tmux in TTY1. Return to GUI\n\n*Open terminal emulator.List sessions with tmux list-session\n\n\n*Attach GUI tmux session to TTY1 session with tmux new-session -t X , where x is the number of the TTY1 session. \n\n\n\nBYOBU\nSimply open byobu session in TTY1 and then go to GUI and open another byobu. They attach automatically. \nSources and Suggested Reading\nShare existing tmux session\nGNU Screen Splitting\nHowTo Share A Terminal Session Using Screen\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/RlzTj.png\n\nA: To my surprise it is actually possible. First some setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install xclip.\n\n*Switch to the virtual terminal with Ctrl-Alt-F1.\n\n*Run alias pc='$(xclip -display :0 -out)'.\n\n\nNow, assuming you've copied some text and changed back to the VT:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type (don't run) pc.\n\n*Press Ctrl-Alt-e. If this doesn't do anything immediately* then do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch back to X with Ctrl-Alt-F7.\n\n*Switch back to the VT with Ctrl-Alt-F1.\n\n\n\nWhat happens in the last step is that the shell-expand-line readline command replaces the command line with the output of the pcalias.\nYou may also want to add the alias to your ~/.bashrc for convenience.\n* When copying text in Firefox the xclip command blocks. However, after selecting text in an XTerm window it didn't.\nI am not using tmux.\n\nYou can use the same method to paste into vim: just type vim - <<'EOF', press Enter, type pc, press Ctrl-Alt-e and Enter, and finally run EOF.\n", "Q: Acer Aspire 5734Z I have an Acer Aspire 5734Z, 3.00 GB, 64 bit O.S. I want to know if there's a distro that's absolutely lighting fast for this computer. I have tried Ubuntu 14.04 on my old Dell Inspirion and it was the fastest thing I had ever seen (since moving away from snail slow windows). I was considering the new Ubuntu Studio 15.04 for the Acer I have. Do you guys think that it would be too \"heavy\" and slow down this older computer?\n\nA: No it's not heavy at all. Especially with that much ram. Ubuntustudio is one of the lightest running desktops. The extras are installed software for media that do not run in the background.\nUbuntustudio actually runs really well even on old hardware as it uses the xfce desktop.

All things are possible given enough time and effort.\nOne way to accomplish DNS benchmarking is to utilize the namebench program as mentioned here. It hasn't been updated since 2010 but is available here\nAnother way to accomplish this on a recent version of Ubuntu  (limited testing accomplished on 14.04.5) is to:\n1) Download  Gibson Research Centers DNS Benchmark (Granted this is also hasn't been updated since 2010)\n2)Launch it with Wine with wine DNSBench.exe via the terminal in the directory you downloaded it to or right click on it in nautilus and select Open with -> Wine Windows Program Loader.\n\nTo add your custom list of DNS servers, Click the Nameservers tab and then the Add/Remove button.\n\nLimitation: If Add System`s Nameservers doesn't do the trick you'll need to parse your csv file to obtain the IP addresses and add them (manually?) to the DNSBench list of servers. \nThen Click Benchmark to complete the benchmark testing. This can take awhile so it's a good time to get up from the keyboard and stretch. \nOnce Benchmarking is complete you can click the Tabular Data button which will provide final bench mark results sorted from fastest to slowest.\nRegarding the safety of updating your local list in /usr/share/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv You can safely test updating any file on your system provided you have a good strategy. There's nothing quite like having a backup copy to insure that you can revert your changes if something goes awry.

When I type ls in the terminal, it shows the files that are present as well as the files that I have deleted. How can I see the current files only, and why does ls keep a record of deleted files?\nls shows the deleted file names followed by a tilde (~).\n\nA: ls does not cache file names. It really does show you exactly what is currently on the file system. However, as @Ravan hinted, there may be similarly named files in your directory. These are typically runtime caches or lock files created by programs such as Vim and Emacs, but could be pretty much anything. For example, if I do the following in one terminal:\n$ touch foo\n$ vim foo\n\nThen I'll see the following in another terminal:\n$ ls -A\nfoo  .foo.swp\n\n.foo.swp is a hidden temporary file which will be deleted if Vim exits nicely.\nSuch files can be safely deleted if they are left around from earlier editing sessions which are no longer open. Just make sure you quote the file names, since they may contain special characters like tilde (~):\n$ rm '.foo~'\n\n\nA: You may use \nprintf '%s\\n' *\n\necho *\n\nls -U\n\nany one of those instead of ls reference here\nThe ~ symbol may runtime cache or backup files.For that refer here\nI edited this after seeing your comment;use this command to delete those backup files (files with ~ symbol)\nfind ./ -name '*~' | xargs rm\n\n\nA: The name followed by \"~\" is actually a cache file.\nWhen you delete the file it may still remain as an hidden file for the nautilus but the \"ls\" command will show them.\nRun rm *~ to remove those files.\n", "Q: How to lock the screen in XFCE?

When we use ls -l or stat or any other program that get us the file attribute uses the stat(2) system call underneath. \nNow inodes are filesystem dependent property, they are created as fixed numbers when the filesystem is created. There is a program dumpe2fs to read the superblock of a ext* filesystem so that we can get some idea e.g. :\nsudo dumpe2fs -h /dev/sda1\n\nNow let's check the inode related properties:\n$ sudo dumpe2fs -h /dev/sda1 | grep -i 'inode.*:'\n\nInode count:              9379840\nFree inodes:              9297243\nInodes per group:         8192\nInode blocks per group:   512\nFirst inode:              11\nInode size:               256\nJournal inode:            8\n\nAs you can see you get enough info like first inode, inode size, inode count etc. If you do a multiplication of Inode count and Inode size you get how much is reserved for the inodes.\nFile copying programs such as cp or rsync have the -a (archive) option to copy the attributes stored on the inode for a file, so you need to look for those or similar options available in the program you are likely to use.\nFor preserving attributes of files and then use it later you can check this answer from mighty Gilles.\n\nA: This may not be a complete answer, but this is what I was able to find from my research.\nFile attributes are stored in inodes and the 'inode tables' are generally scattered throughout the file-system. In general, to find where you have the inode tables (at least in ext3 filesystem), you can run:\nsudo dumpe2fs /dev/<device> | fgrep 'Inode table'\n\nand you can do a hexdump of the raw data at the block where the inodes resides (Note I've not tried this command!):\nsudo dd if=/dev/<device> ibs=4096 skip=<inode block> count=1 | hexdump\n\nReplace the <device> and the <inode block> with the block offset to the inode table you want to look at.\nsource: LinuxQuestions, SO question\n", "Q: How to unmount nfs on shutdown of system via Network Manager I use network manager and mount a NFS drive via a custom script\n/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99nfs.sh:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nIF=$1\nSTATUS=$2\n\nif [ \"${IF}\" = \"eth0\" ] && [ \"${STATUS}\" = \"up\" ]; then\n\n        mount /media/media\n        exit $?\n\nelif [ \"${IF}\" = \"eth0\" ] && [ \"${STATUS}\" = \"down\" ]; then\n        umount /media/media\nfi\n\nBut when I shutdown my computer it does not switch of. Pressing ESC revealed that the stop job for unmounting /media/media does not stop running.\nHow can I properly umount on shutdown? I think the unmount has to happen before NetworkManager disconnects.\n\nA: Based on adonis' comment I was able to fix this as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a new file /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-down.d/99nfs.sh\n\n*make it executable\n\n*contents:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nlogger \"down: unmounting nfs shares PREDOWN\"\numount /media/media\n\nof course I could also have checked for the interface, but I did not this time.\nedit\nThis solution broke.

They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\nI have chosen \"Main Server\" for source list.\n\nA: If your country's server is working fine at the moment then you should switch to that for it is effectively a mirror server to download your software packages from. As stated here this affects:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*spreading the load among multiple servers instead of just one\n  \n*generating less international network traffic which is expensive (not directly for you but for other parties involved in transmissions)\n  \n*lowers network latency\n  \n*maybe higher throughput - that really depends on a server\n  \n  \n  I don't think there are CONS that you should be concerned about.\n  Availability, redundancy of a mirror could differ between one another,\n  meaning that mirror X could have a higher availability percentage than\n  mirror Y but it's not that much of a time-sensitive service.\n\nSo if your country's server works for you, but not the main server, then use your country's one. Although there is a delay with local country servers, so the main one does get software updates faster, although if currently you are not able to get anything from it, then I think that the country ones for now are best for you until the main server is back up.\n", "Q: Lenovo IdeaPad Z570 touchpad stopped working after upgrade to 15.04 Having just upgraded to Ubuntu 15.04 (from 14.04 via 14.10) my touchpad does not appear to be working.

Well, other than two main things which really disappointed me.\n\n\n*\n\n*The G-keys and their profiles cannot be configured to do anything, so they are just sitting there being useless.\n\n*(Not so important) The scroll lock key does nothing.\n\n\nI was wondering if there is anything I could do to allow me to remap the G-keys to do stuff such as opening the Terminal or a web browser.\nUntil now, I tried the following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running the Corsair K30 keyboard software through Wine. It launched and everything seems to work, but it does not detect the keyboard as a K30 and as such does not register any of the \"not normal\" keys I press, such as the brightness, macro profile, and macro record buttons. (The brightness works and changes the keyboard's LED brightness, but the program does not detect it.)\n\n*Using xbindkeys and figuring out the key codes of each G-key and other keys. The G-keys are all the same, but the other keys like the macro profile and the macro record have different ones.\n\n*Just going in through a normal program such as Keyboard > Application Shortcuts and trying to bind the G-keys over there.\nNone of that worked obviously, so is there any other way I could get my keyboard's G-keys to work?\nUbuntu version: Ubuntu 15.04 (Vivid Vervet)\n\nA: This may be on the bleeding edge, but there is a Linux kernel driver for Corsair Kxx that is currently under active development. The base is Corsair K90, but there are reports for the Corsair K40. It might work for the Corsair K30.\nA feature worth mentioning is:\n\nRemapping G keys so they send proper key codes.\n\nAn alternative is the K65/K70/K95 RGB Unofficial Driver for Linux and OS X, but it seems to be for the RGB editions only. It is on GitHub, though.\nNote: I don't know about the Corsair K30, but for the Corsair K95 RGB the G-keys do not work because they are not executed in the keyboard itself, but by software in the operating system (only intended to be Windows).\n", "Q: Play dual movies, using two sound devices one for original version and the other one for dubbed I have some movies, in avi and mp4 format, with two sound channels.\nIt would be great, if I could play both channels on different sound cards to be listened with earphones (one for me and the other one for my girlfriend).\nI've seen external USB sound cards.\nBut I have never seen any movie players that allow this feature.\nIs it possible on Ubuntu?\n\nA: Install pavucontrol from this link using Software Center. \nNext Start two instances of vlc for the same video file, use the following cmd:\n`vlc /path/to/video.avi & vlc /path/to/video.avi`\n\nStart pavucontrol in a new terminal using the following cmd:\npavucontrol\n\nNow in the playback tab, scroll down to find two vlc applications.

When use this connection only for resources on its network is unchecked your default gateway is 0.0.0.0\nAlso when you are connected to vpn resource witch is routed trough ppp0 interface is only one host 192.168.100.180\nIn first case you can manually add route to resource on vpn site\nsudo ip route add xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/yy dev ppp0\n\nxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - represent host/network\nyy - represent network mask\nexample:\nadd route to host 192.168.100.181 trough ppp0 \n sudo ip route add 192.168.100.181/32 dev ppp0\n\nadd route to network range 192.168.100.0 with mask 255.255.255.0 trough ppp0\n sudo ip route add 192.168.100.0/24 dev ppp0\n\nThis also can be done in Network Manager. On same places where is use this connection only for resources on its network you can add route.\nIn second scenario, when use this connection only for resources on its network is unchecked you add default route to eth0 interface. This will allow to access resources on internet\n sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.1\n\n", "Q: HP Spectre x360 disable trackpad in tablet mode I have the HP Spectre x360 and when I bend the laptop back into tablet mode (360 hinges), usually the keyboard and mouse disables in Windows. \nIn Ubuntu 15.04 the keyboard successfully disables, but not the trackpad. \nWhat wizardry can I perform to rectify this issue? \nHopefully I could create an actively running script where it listens for particular events (activation of tablet mode) and then disable the track pad once boolean value equals True or something.

It says Supported FSBs::   533/800MHz,  but also says Memory Types::     DDR 333/400, DDR2 400/533.  Since I am planning to upgrade RAM, can i buy DDR2 800MHz ?  I see DDR3 is selling for even lower prices now a days, but I am not sure if i can use a DDR3 on this.\n\n*The above intel link also says under memory specs, Physical Address Extensions::    32-bit and I was wondering if this means that I CAN NOT run ubuntu/debian 64 bit versions. I need the 64 bit version of one of these OS installed because I plan to run mongoDB server on this machine, and mongoDB supports only 64 bit versions of these two OS. My understanding of PAE makes me guess that \"32-bit\" means that it supports more than 4GB memory space and 64 bit architectures.\n\n*Hard Drive:  Currently Hitachi 7200rpm SATA 80GB. Under Windows 7 control panel I see that SATA Controller is Intel 82801FB Ultra ATA 2652(and Ultra ATA 266F).  Come thanksgiving, I want to get a SSD, but since I do not see AHCI listed anywhere in BIOS, i wonder if this hardware will support SSD. \n\n*Wireless: I currently have 2 wireless N adapters, but not sure if either of them will work under Ubuntu or Debian. First is a Zonet ZEW1642D model PCI card that has RaLink chip RT3062F.  Second is a Linksys N300 USB adapter that has been certified for Windows 7, but i do not see linux listed on the box.  Do i need to buy a wireless card for this machine and if so, where can i find compatible cards for this hardware ?\n\n*Ubuntu version:  I have already looked up the supported hardware list but it says only older versions of Ubuntu were tested on this hardware. Will i be ok with installation of latest Ubuntu/Debian ?\n\n*Goal is to run this machine as a learning machine at home and run simple apps. MongoDB server would be installed but only for learning purposes. Which flavour of linux is recommended - Ubuntu or Debian ? I am mentioning Debian because i read a webpage that said Debian is more suited for server machines. But this is not a industry server, but home machine.\n\n*Video upgrade : Will i get better performance on this, if i upgrade to a PCI video card ? No gaming on this machine, but potentially internet streaming maybe done for Netflix or Hulu movies. Currently my plan is to upgrade to 8GB RAM and SSD as the basics. In today's market prices, this is going to cost me about $150. I am guessing that if Wireless card is needed that would cost another $25 for Ubuntu. So, if i add $50 for a video card, that would bring upgrade costs to about $225. But a newer laptop with SSD+4GB ram is about $350, here in bay area (Toshiba Satellite Radius 11 L15W-B1120, Pentium N3540, 11.6\" Convertible Laptop With 4GB, Memory, 128GB SSD, Windows 8.1). I only have to add a wireless card and reformat it for Ubuntu. The only sacrifice here would be the lower 4GB RAM on the laptop. As i finish writing the question, i am starting to wonder if this machine is worth upgrading, but would like to find answers to my questions anyways. This would become the 5th PC i have at home, and wife would object if she saw me getting yet another new laptop :-)\n\n\nThanks a bunch for reading my long post.\n\nA: Here is my $0.02....\nRAM: According to Kingston.com you have a max of 2GB with 2 sockets. If someone has been able to have 4GB installed, and usable, then there may have been a BIOS upgrade that enabled this. I do not think 8GB would be possible. DDR2 800MHz is the top for you. DDR3 will not work. 915GV is the chipset. If BIOS is reporting 82915G/GV/910GL, 82915G is you.\n32-Bit vs 64-Bit: If the board is 32-Bit, that is what you have to install. You CANNOT install a 64-Bit operating system on a 32-bit board. You can install a 32-bit operating system on a 64-bit board though. Short of buying a 64-bit board, there is nothing that can be done to upgrade the board to 64-bit.\nHARD DRIVE: Off the top of my head, I do not see any reason why you should not be able to run a SSD. As long as it is a SATA drive, you should not have a problem there.\nWIRELESS: I am not familiar with the other 3 adapters but, the Linksys should work. I would suggest booting the system off of the DVD and just run a live session. If the adapter works there, it will be just fine.\nUBUNTU VERSION: You should be good there. If it has been tested with a recently older version, you should be fine.\nGOAL: My recommendation, use what you are familiar with. Since this is a learning PC, why not duel boot both Ubuntu and Debian? I would also suggest, make sure you can make several images of the drive as you play. I have found myself with dead installs by playing with seemingly harmless settings and programs. Ghost was a very close friend.\nVIDEO CARD: You have PCI Express. You can always upgrade there. Being that this will be a learning PC and you will not be doing any gaming, I don't see a need to upgrade there. Steaming video could be a concern. Even then, a decent $50 card can go far.\n\nA: I would suggest that if your old computer can boot from a cd/dvd or USB memory stick, to try a few different live-cds.\nI have tried many many different distros on older (and newer) machines. My prefered distro is: Puppy Linux Lucid v5.28 http://puppylinux.org/wikka/Puppy528, which is semi-compatible with Ubuntu 12.04.  (You can find newer versions of PL that work well with newer Ubuntu versions.)  I find that Puppy Linux is very stable and supports very old hardware as well as the very newest.  I run PL on a 15 year old laptop, and I also have installed the newest version of Puppy Linux Tahr (TahrPup) on my new server (with a SSD).  Puppy Linux is well supported through lots of help tutorials and a many forums -- so if something doesn't work with your hardware, join a forum and ask them, you will get help.\n\nA: To answer your question regarding the Toshiba Satellite Radius 11 L15W-B1120, I have the exact machine, and there seems to be an incompatibility somewhere in the kernels from 14.04lts, 14.10, 15.04lts, 15.10, and 16.04lts.\nGood news the wireless card works out of the box, but it will cut in and out until you disable power management on the wireless adapter. But the bigger issue is the \"toshiba-wmi\" \"toshiba_acpi\" kernel modules either is incompatible with this particular laptop (bios flashed to the latest version did not seem to help). The package toshset complains the kernel is not set up to support 'toshiba_acpi', even with the module loaded successfully according to dmesg.. The issue seems to be in the kernels in ability to detect the CPU fan in the device, and no way to force it to locate it, so CPU throttling software would have be setup (sensor, tlp, tlp-stat, and thermald). The 4 core processor supports throttling from its normal operating speed of 2.1ghz up to a max-\"turbo\" 2.6ghz, all the way down to 500mhz, and when it hits 55 deg C, I throttle it down to its lowest clock speed until it starts to cool down to 40 deg C before the system re-clocks to 2.1ghz-2.6ghz.\nIts not a great solution, but its a work around until the issue is resolved in the kernel (if it ever is resolved in a future update, currently tracking the bug). It runs Ubuntu so much faster than the default installed OS, Windows 10.\nI'm sure you could find another 2 in 1 laptop quad-core, 4gb and 128gb SSD for roughly the same price that is a bit more compatible out of the box with Ubuntu (Linux in general, being its a kernel issue). \nA portable Linux machine would probably suit your \"learning\" project more than an at home desktop because of the portability of being able to turn it on anywhere and poke around and \"learn\" the OS, and being newer hardware than this old machine you have, it should perform far better. (I have an old quad-core dell desktop, and everything runs extremely slow on it, except Gentoo. The Toshiba laptop easily out performs it in Ubuntu).\nEdit: its a 64bit processor, so you would be able to run the 64bit versions of it...the 32bit version only of Ubuntu would work on the machine you have. Considering its only DDR, 800mhz in the old machine, the performance difference from DDR3 is night and day, but your old motherboard will not take it. And being a proprietary system, normally they are extremely picky about the exact memory you toss in there, so you would have to pay attention if it supports ECC or Non-ECC, because it will not even recognize if you get the wrong memory upgrade.\nso cost analysis, I'd personally go with the newer hardware of one of those 2 in 1 laptops you mentioned for roughly the same price as your intended upgrade on the older machine... (just choose something different than the L15W-B1120 Toshiba, unless you have some experience in recompiling kernels, reloading grub, reconfiguring just about everything in linux, fixing UEFI issues and the like)\nUbuntu 16.04 screams on my AMD 8-core FX-8350 32gb Desktop/Radeon R9-380x though.. but I still seem to use the L15W-B1120 Toshiba laptop with Ubuntu 16.04 far more because of the portability, even with the slight frustration I'm having with the system.\nBut that's IMO.\n", "Q: Java 7 reporting not installed?

Is that OK or must I create one?\n\nA: Swap partition is needed for the system itself and some apps go crazy if there is no swap partition, and it is used for hibernation too. So I think it would worth that amount of space it needs.\n\nA: The Swap partition is necessary. However, IF the PC that has been installed\non has large amounts of RAM, the swap partition may be used less. System itself will deal with RAM/swap usage. Should be no real need to tinker.\nWith small RAM amounts, swap partition is crucial! In this situation, swap is needed so that the system has a 'place to go' once the RAM is filled up.\nRemember that swap is going to behave as if it is RAM, meaning random access.\nThat means data is constantly in/out of RAM/swap while applications and the \nOS itself runs.

I haven't planned to update for so long because I don't see the urgency to run software updates  in the past. \nBut I did it this morning, I am expecting the performance will be increasing after running the software update. But the fact, I encounter computer hang event only open google-chrome with 2 tabs and sublime-text.\nI am not sure, how do I search the main problem on this update.. Have anyone experienced the same thing? If os, what's the solution?\nThank you in advance! \n\nA: A couple of months ago, I tried installing Ubuntu 14.04 on my desktop machine. It ran really well until I installed a ton of recommended updates. Then, boot time was longer, and the system would hang all the time. The software center was almost unusable as well. \n\nAs for a solution, I would recommend using Linux Mint (which I installed instead of Ubuntu); its basically Ubuntu with a different desktop; I find it to work better. Or, you could try Ubuntu 12; I haven't tried it myself, but I have heard that its really good.\n\nIf you are determined to keep what you have now, try looking at the update history, and uninstalling whatever the update installed. This is not the best solution, so be very careful so you don't break your system.\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu Openstack free or does it cost money? I have read through the links on ubuntu.com for cloud and also read through few questions asked previously on askubuntu, but am still confused, hence this question (appreciate if you don't mark this as duplicate, but help me understand):\n\n\n*\n\n*Suppose I wish to install Openstack (on more than 10 nodes) on Ubuntu server following the manual method (referring to Openstack installation guide) - I guess this is called Ubuntu Openstack (as its packaged for Ubuntu). \n\n\n*\n\n*Do I have to pay any license fees for this Openstack installation?\n\n*Can I still purchase support for openstack, to get bug fixes with a  faster response (for production deployment)\n\n*Instead of manual installation, could I use Juju, MaaS for installing Openstack on Ubuntu server for free for more than 10 nodes? or it is only available for Canonical distribution of Ubuntu Openstack?\n\n\n*Suppose I want to use the Canonical distribution of Ubuntu Openstack \n\n\n*\n\n*I understand that I can use it for free (no license fees) for upto 10 nodes - Is this correct even if I want to use for commercial/production purpose, or this is only for some beta release etc.?\n\n*Can I still buy only support (for my production use case)for this installation of upto 10 nodes (where I am not required to pay for any license fees for upto 10 nodes)?\nWould really appreciate any help from Canonical in helping me understand these scenarios.\n\nA: Thanks for getting in touch. My name is James Wengraf and you can reach me on james.wengraf@canonical.com or 0044 207 630 2463 and I sit on the Cloud Platforms team at our HQ.\nIn answer to your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*No\n\n*Yes\n\n*Automated installation better route to go, for many reasons. Please refer to Ubuntu OpenStack Autopilot, which will automate the installation for you. Our Landscape Systems management tool can provision up to 10 nodes for you  to test on. \n\n\n\n\n\n*In detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, correct. You can use for free.\n\n*Yes, you can buy only support. There are caveats though. The cloud must be built using our tools. \n\n\n\nI would recommend that you contact me so we can discuss further. I would like to know more about your use case. I can hopefully also give you some insight into what other OpenStack end users are doing. \nFinally, for production workloads, I would actually recommend our BootStack offering. It will save you time and money and is one of our most advanced cloud platform products, specifically catering to smaller scale cloud deployments.\n", "Q: Safely remove an OS from dual boot How can i safely remove a linux os from a dual booting laptop? Do i create a bootable gparted disk and just format that particular partition with the unwanted os on it and change it into something else(e.g. ext2 or swap or something like that?)\nI want to make sure it's cleanly removed and won't mess up my partition table.\n\nA: It is as tricky as making it dual boot. If you did not go through too much hassle while installing it and have kept two OSes in different file systems then all you to do is remove OS entry from GRUB and then see if you can safely delete the partition on which that OS reside.\n\nA: Keep Windows and Remove Linux:\n\n\n*\n\n*Head to the Start menu (or Start screen) and search for \"Disk Management.\" Open up the Disk Management tool.\n\n\n*Find your Linux partition. It won't be labeled since Windows doesn't understand the Linux file system, so you'll need to figure out which one it is by size and where it is on your hard drive. Make sure you have the right one before continuing!\n\n*Right-click on the partition and choose \"Delete Volume.\" This will delete the partition from your hard drive, leaving free space. If you get a green box of \"free space,\" you'll have to right-click on it and choose \"Delete Volume\" a second time until you get the black \"Unallocated Space.\"\n\n*Right-click on your Windows partition and choose \"Extend Volume.\" Extend it to fill the free space your Linux partition left behind.  \n\n*Lastly, insert your Windows recovery disc (or recovery USB drive) and boot from it. Choose \"Repair Your Computer,\" go to \"Troubleshoot,\" and then enter a Command Prompt. Type the following command:  \n\nbootrec.exe /fixmbr  \n\nThis will remove Linux's bootloader and replace it with Windows'.\nReboot your computer and you should find that it boots directly into Windows, with no Linux partition to be found.\nReference here\nAlso for pictorial guide refer here\n", "Q: Need advise on ubuntu partition to install opensuse in dual boot I have ubuntu 12.04 with below details shown by gparted.

Open Gparted in Ubuntu and use it to make sda3 a little smaller. Then select Apply. Make sure not to format it or resize the wrong partition.\n", "Q: Stop internet service provider website from loading automatically every time I connect to internet for the first time I am using a 3g dongle for Internet connection, every time I connect to the Internet the website of my service provider opens up automatically. Is there a way to stop it from happening? I once installed their cross platform user -interface, and couldn't remove it properly or undo the changes it did.\n\nA: Some ways to find this software:\nLook at the output of ps -ewfH -- does anything in there look like the brand name of the dongle or the service provider?\nIn a terminal, run grep -Ri <brand-name> /etc/ , where <brand-name> is some distinctive part of the brand name of the service provider or dongle. If you get any matches, that might tell you how the script is auto-starting.\nIf you remember the date when you first installed the software that came with the dongle, you can try to find the files it modified by doing:\nfind / -newermt <1 day before dongle> ! -newermt <1 day after dongle>\n\nfor instance, if you did the dongle software install on December 21st of last year:\nfind / -newermt \"2014-12-20\" ! -newermt \"2014-12-22\"\n\nVery slow, but might work:\ngrep -Rli \"<distinctive part of url the software takes you to>\" /\n\nThis searches every file on the system for that URL. If you have 1 TB of files, this will take approximately 3-4 hours to complete. You can speed it up by first trying with /usr /etc /*b* /var /opt in place of the last /, but if the script is hiding in your home directory, that won't catch it.\nExtreme measures:\nOn a different computer (one that you don't mind reformatting), take a full backup of every file. Then, connect the dongle to it and install the software. Now compare the entire machine to the full backup, and see what changed.\n", "Q: Dual-booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu with UEFI on two separate drives? I've already installed Windows 8 in UEFI mode and it is currently running off of one SSD. On another SSD, I want to install Ubuntu GNOME. Is there any sort of special configuration or setting I have to choose in my BIOS?\nThe Windows 8 installation is installed in UEFI mode and the entry for it in my BIOS is Windows Boot Manager.\n\nA: Well, I'd recommend installing Ubuntu MATE (the supported remake of GNOME for modern versions of Ubuntu), but aside from that you should be fine. GRUB should recognize Windows automatically. Just make sure, if you can, to boot into the Ubuntu installer in EFI mode. You'll also want to set the SSD that Ubuntu is on to be before the Windows drive.\n", "Q: HDD pooling/partitioning suggestions for media server I have multiple hdds that I would like to pool together.  Sizes are as follows: 2x1TB; 2X2TB; and 1x4TB.  Running Ubuntu server 14.04 on a separate SSD with the primary purpose of using this machine as a media server.  Currently have about 2.5TB-3TB worth of data that would be stored in the pool.  In addition, it will be used for storing client OS images, file shares, and running a VM environment for testing/learning.  \nData replication for media is crucial, but it does not have to be live replication so long as if a drive fails my data is accessible somewhere (was thinking an rsync cron job).  While I could be wrong, I think RAID would be overkill, and difficult to implement with different size drives.  However, RAID is a possible upgrade in the future.  My intention for right now is just to make use of all the drives I have. \nNot all drives need to be apart of the pool, in fact I was considering separating/isolating out one of the 1TB drives for storing OS backups and VM usage.  Bulk of storage space would be dedicated to media storage.  \nSuggestions???  TIA\n\nA: If you have 8GB mem and run a 64-bit system, have a look at zfs: zfs on linux FAQ, nice presentation.\n\nA: Thanks, I was checking that out, as well as others.  I'm fairly new to linux and the ability to choose my file system.  In the end decided to go with btrfs, and so far so good.  Just a file system after all.  Decided against zfs, as most articles I read indicated it was losing favor over btrfs for various reasons.  Haven't done much more than basic setup and creating subvolumes.  Its ease of adding more storage (pooling) and snapshots (I believe zfs does these things too) were the key features for me.\n\nA: When you say HDD pooling, do you mean creating one big (or several bigger) logical volume(s) out of the HDD's? If that's what you mean, you should take a look at LVM. I've used it to combine two 3TB HDD's in my home server (I have a separate one for the OS) into one big volume group and of top of that I created several logical volumes to be used for different purposes (ownCloud data, backup drives for different family members, video/music storage). It's easy to use and never had any big problems with it (yet). (Even if it's not what you meant you could use it to easily change the partition sizes.)\nYou could use RAID (on top of LVM, I believe) to duplicate the data to ensure the data is still available to the server, but remember that it's not a substitution to regular backups on another machine/HDD!\n", "Q: shell script executing on remote host I want to run testcmd.sh on remote host (Testhost) using the following command:\nssh test@Testhost 'bash -s' < /test/testcmd\n\nBut I get the below error :\n!!!!!Running MASTERCMD!!!!!\nbash: line 31: /test/PROCESSLIST: No such file or directory\n\nI dont want to have the PROCESSLIST file placed locally on the Testhost.

The problem is that a necessary dropdown menu won't work.\nTo sign in to battle.net you are required to select a region, but when you press the button to do so, the terminal says :\n\n\"fixme:wbemprox:enum_class_object_Next timeout not supported\"\n  \"fixme:win:FlashWindowEx 0x33bc2c\"\n\nand the menu won't appear, so I can't progress any further.\nIs there any solution to this?\nThanks for reading.\n\nA: Seems this is a known Wine bug, with only a luck based workaround.\nThe dropdown menu does exist, and you can navigate it, you just can't see it.\nIf you're having this problem yourself, use the tab key to make sure the focus is on the region button, then use Up/Down arrows to navigate inside the invisible region menu, then press enter to select which ever region you got. Then it's just trial and error until you find your region.\n\nA: I am new to Linux, and I am using Mint and ran into the same exact problem, which brought me here.\nI don't know if this will work for you, but I have a duel monitor set up. So I clicked the dropdown menu to select region, which obviously didn't work. So I held down tab and the menu itself popped up on my other monitor. Basically I just moved my mouse over to the right monitor and selected my region.\nI don't know if this will help you at all. I was just thinking instead of the menu being invisible, for some reason it's popping up off screen instead of dropping down. Maybe I only noticed it because I have two monitors. \n", "Q: problems with pidgin-sipe and office 365 does anyone have problems logging into office365 IM via pidgin-sipe?

It is a setting that helps your PC start up faster after shutdown. Windows does this by saving system info to a file (hiberfil.sys) upon shutdown. \nUbuntu detects this as a corrupt NTFS partition. Windows 7 also detects this as corrupt but repairs it making the file system accessible by Ubuntu.\nYou can fix this in Windows power options. Find the setting for what the power switch does and turn off fast startup (you may have to use advanced settings).

I came back about an hour later with a black screen, as if the PC was off, but it wasn't. I rebooted using the physical button and went into the grub menu and from there dropped to the root shell and uninstalled the driver using firstly mount -o remount,rw / and then apt-get --purge remove nvidia-* and then I hit reboot.\nThe system started up, and I was logged in, normally, as if nothing was happened, I opened the Softwares & Updates window and saw that the driver was set back to the Nouveau one, I guess that happened because I deleted the NVIDIA ones. So then, I google a bit and install some ppa's for drivers. Namely sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa -y and then sudo apt-get update and finally sudo apt-get install nvidia-352, the 352 being the version I got from the official NVIDIA site. Low and behold, I reboot, and the exact same thing happens.

In other words, you are trying to contact the server at linux-server.home but the cert says linux-server.tpgi.com.au.  Is this the case?\nUnfortunately, the hostname you contact needs to match your certificate.  This is the only way that the landscape-client has to validate the landscape-server (at this point in time).\nAlso, I'm including another link that you will run into later if you don't have agreement with the root_url and what landscape thinks the hostname of your installation is.  \nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.landscape.canonical.com/LDS/SSL\n", "Q: Recommended branch I am on 14.04 and I was trying to solve my weak wireless connection (download 1Mbs vs 30 Mbs wired) problem using this tread.\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2219952\nby doing the following command\nTry these steps with the Realtek card (updated driver and module parameters:\nCode:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-headers-generic linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential dkms git\ngit clone https://github.com/FreedomBen/rtl8188ce-linux-driver\ncd rtl8188ce-linux-driver\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo cp -r firmware/* /lib/firmware\necho \"options rtl8188ee ips=0 fwlps=0\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8188ee.conf\n\nhowever,after running the code make in the terminal, i got this message\n\nRecommended branch is ubuntu-15.04 based on your kernel version\n  (3.19.0-25-generic) Should I switch it to ubuntu-15.04 for you? \n  (y/n):\n\nDoes it mean that it will upgrade my OS 14.04 to 15.04?\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04.3 and 15.04 have same kernel version 3.19.\nThe Realtek driver detected that kernel and suggests to install the driver from a different branch that will work with this kernel.\nSo just install the driver from that branch.

I know you can deny it for specific users.\n\nA: If you want to run a cronjob for a user that they can't modify, it is easy.

So, to find all OpenCV libraries you can do the following (this might take a while)\nsudo find / -name \"*opencv*\" -exec rm -i {} \\;\n\nThe above command will find any file containing opencv in the name, and will prompt you to remove it. As always, be careful when deleting things manually!\nReference here\n\nA: You can also uninstall by going to the \"build\" folder directory of opencv from terminal, and execute the following\n make uninstall\n cd ..\n sudo rm -r build\n sudo rm -r /usr/local/include/opencv2 /usr/local/include/opencv /usr/include/opencv /usr/include/opencv2 /usr/local/share/opencv /usr/local/share/OpenCV /usr/share/opencv /usr/share/OpenCV /usr/local/bin/opencv* /usr/local/lib/libopencv*\n\n\nA: Is this a live-media with persistence USB?

This issue is not present when connecting to the same cluster with another laptop running Ubuntu 14.04. The issue is also not present when using the laptop with Ubuntu 15.04 to connect to the cluster an launch MATLAB version 2010b. Possibly some changes in java support from Ubuntu 14.04 to 15.04 that affect specifically some aspects of Swing that have been added to MATLAB in recent versions? Has anybody had experience with this and knows of any fixes (possibly other than replacing Ubuntu 15.04 with 14.04)? Thanks!\n\nA: Solved. It was a particular case of the following issue:\nhttps://xpressubuntu.wordpress.com/2015/08/08/random-disappearing-letters/\nwhich in my case only affected MATLAB over ssh. Reverting from SNA to UXA fixed the problem.\n", "Q: How to give the \"Session and Startup\" feature a working directory for a python script I turned a GUI that I wrote in python into an executable via chmod +x mygui.py, added a shebang. Then I added this script to the \"Session and Startup\" list of programs (Settings -> Session and Startup) in order to run it when I turn on my computer. When I reboot my computer, the GUI is opened but some of its widgets are not drawn. \nEdit: After opening the properties of a launcher I created on my desktop for the same python script, I realized that the difference is that the launcher has a \"working directory\" which the startup manager doesn't know about. I am pretty sure that this is the reason why some widgets aren't loading since they use some icons and other elements that are in the same directory as the script. So now my question is, how do I tell ubuntu where to look for everything in my script when it opens it on startup? Thank you.\n\nA: you can set \"working directory\" or in Linux term \"path\" in three different ways: \n1) add your script PATH to environment variables. It's a fairly easier way and works good but it's permanent and it's not a good practice IMO. The way to do that is to issue this command:\nexport PATH=$PATH:your_path\n\n2) add your script PATH to the shortcut .Just open the .desktop file in a text editor (if you're having trouble finding it, you can create the launcher on your desktop and find it in ~/Desktop, then move it later), and add a line at the end that says Path=YOUR_PATH. Then add the .desktop file to the startup\n3) first go to your directory then start your script. for example:\nbash -c \"cd /path/to/directory && /path/to/directory/executable\"\n\n", "Q: Getting Jungledisk working on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I'm trying to get the desktop client for Jungledisk working on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, so that I can restore some family photos which have been backed-up into a jungledisk-format backup vault (which can't be done through their web interface or using the command-line jungledisk command).\nI've successfully installed Jungle Disk (from 64-bit deb) and sorted out the LibNotify error as discussed here:\njungledisk fails with libnotify error.\nThen the first time I started junglediskdesktop it ran ok (i.e. windows appeared and so on), and I set up the config.\nSo now it seems to be configured correctly, but when I run it:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first time it seems to do nothing at all,\n\n*The second time it gives this error \"Jungle Disk Desktop is running in standalone mode and has detected that the service is already running, or the service network port is in use.

The built-in [ and binary /usr/bin/[ are just commands like any other, e.g. ls or grep. \nThe if statement executes the command(s) between the if and the then. If the last one has exit code 0, it executes the commands following the then. The [ command exits with 0 if its arguments -- which it interprets as a logical expression according to certain syntax rules -- evaluate to true.\nIn fact, you could eliminate the if altogether and use only the [ command, as in the idiomatic:\n[ $(ipcs|grep test|wc -l) -ne 630 ] || echo \"...\"\n\n", "Q: While writing npm install learnyounode -g on terminal? 12.04 LTS ~$ npm install learnyounode -g\n\nnpm ERR! registry error parsing json\n\nnpm ERR!

Also it takes a really long time to boot (about 1.5 min, and sometimes it does not boot at all as it has a black screen at boot.)\nUpstart:\nWhen I tried the upstart options at boot, it performs as expected, booted in seconds, and it was awesome as it should be.\nLaptop:\n\n\n*\n\n*AMD A8\n\n*Radeon\n\n*SSD\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does upstart perform better than systemd?\n\n*How can I debug systemd?\n\n*Should I switch to upstart? If yes, how do I do it?\n\n\nA: 1- Why:\nUpstart's model for starting processes is greedy event-based, all available jobs whose startup events happen are started as early as possible. During boot, upstart synthesizes some initial events like startup or rcS as the tree root, the early services start on those, and later services start when the former are running.\nSystemd's model for starting processes is lazy dependency-based, a unit will only start if and when some other starting unit depends on it. During boot, systemd starts a root unit, which then transitively expands and starts its dependencies.\n2- systemd-debug-generator\nIs a generator that reads the kernel command line and understands three options:\nsystemd.mask= option\n\nFollowed by a unit name,this unit is masked for the runtime. This is useful to boot with certain  units removed from the initial boot transaction for debugging system startup.\nsystemd.wants= option\n\nFollowed by a unit name, this unit is added to the initial transaction.    This is useful to start one or more additional units at boot.\nsystemd.debug-shell option\n\nThe debug shell service \"debug-shell.service\" is pulled into the boot transaction. It will spawn a debug shell on tty9 during early system startup.\n3- To do so:\nSelect the Advanced options for Ubuntu at the boot prompt when your computer starts.\nThen, select the Ubuntu, with Linux ... (upstart) entry.\nHowever, this will work only for the current session\nSo if you want to make it permanent, you'll have to install the upstart-sysv package.\nSource\n", "Q: Oracle Database Express 11.2 job for oracle-xe.service failed Environment:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 \n\n*Oracle Database Express 11g Release 2\n\n\nI'm receiving an error by starting service oracle-xe\nsystemctl status oracle-xe.service\n● oracle-xe.service - LSB: Oracle 11g Express Edition\n   Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/oracle-xe)\n   Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since lun 2015-08-24 22:24:32 CEST; 18min ago\n     Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8)\n  Process: 12274 ExecStart=/etc/init.d/oracle-xe start (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)\n\n... systemd[1]: Starting LSB: Oracle 11g Express Edition...\n... oracle-xe[12274]: Starting Oracle Net Listener.\n... su[12282]: No passwd entry for user 'oracle'\n... oracle-xe[12274]: Starting Oracle Database 11g Express Edition instance.\n... su[12288]: No passwd entry for user 'oracle'\n... oracle-xe[12274]: Failed to start Oracle Net Listener using /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin/tnslsnr and Oracle Express Database using /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin/sqlplus.\n... systemd[1]: oracle-xe.service: control process exited, code=exited status=1\n... systemd[1]: Failed to start LSB: Oracle 11g Express Edition.\n... systemd[1]: Unit oracle-xe.service entered failed state.\n... systemd[1]: oracle-xe.service failed.\n\nI think that the problem could be with:\n... su[12282]: No passwd entry for user 'oracle'\njournalctl -xe\n...\n.. polkitd(authority=local)[641]: Registered Authentication Agent for unix-process:12249:680724 (system bus name :1.73 [/usr/bin/pkttyagent --notify-fd 5 --fallback], object path /org/freedesktop/PolicyKit1/AuthenticationAgent, locale es_ES.UTF-8)\n... systemd[1]: Starting LSB: Oracle 11g Express Edition...\n-- Subject: Unit oracle-xe.service has begun start-up\n-- Defined-By: systemd\n-- Support: http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/systemd-devel\n-- \n-- Unit oracle-xe.service has begun starting up.\n... oracle-xe[12274]: Starting Oracle Net Listener.\n... su[12282]: No passwd entry for user 'oracle'\n... su[12282]: FAILED su for oracle by root\n... su[12282]: - ??? root:oracle\n... oracle-xe[12274]: Starting Oracle Database 11g Express Edition instance.\n... su[12288]: No passwd entry for user 'oracle'\n... su[12288]: FAILED su for oracle by root\n... su[12288]: - ??? root:oracle\n... oracle-xe[12274]: Failed to start Oracle Net Listener using /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin/tnslsnr and Oracle Express Database using /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin/sqlplus.\n... systemd[1]: oracle-xe.service: control process exited, code=exited status=1\n... systemd[1]: Failed to start LSB: Oracle 11g Express Edition.\n-- Subject: Unit oracle-xe.service has failed\n-- Defined-By: systemd\n-- Support: http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/systemd-devel\n-- \n-- Unit oracle-xe.service has failed.\n-- \n-- The result is failed.\n... systemd[1]: Unit oracle-xe.service entered failed state.\n... systemd[1]: oracle-xe.service failed.\n... polkitd(authority=local)[641]: Unregistered Authentication Agent for unix-process:12249:680724 (system bus name :1.73, object path /org/freedesktop/PolicyKit1/AuthenticationAgent, locale es_ES.UTF-8) (disconnected from bus)\n... sudo[12248]: pam_unix(sudo:session): session closed for user root\n... pkexec[12404]: pam_unix(polkit-1:session): session opened for user root by (uid=1000)\n... pkexec[12404]: jose: Executing command [USER=root] [TTY=unknown] [CWD=/home/jose] [COMMAND=/usr/lib/update-notifier/package-system-locked]\n... kernel: toshiba_acpi: Unknown key 120\n\n\nA: To resolve the issue, you should uninstall completely (uninstall instructions) and then reinstall following the next steps.\nInstructions to install Oracle Database Express (install instruccions)\n1) Download the Oracle 11gR2 express edition installer from the following link\n2) Unzip it :\n\nunzip oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip\n\n\n3) Install the following packages :\nsudo apt-get install alien libaio1 unixodbc vim\n\n4) Convert the red-hat ( rpm ) package to Ubuntu-package :\nsudo alien --scripts -d oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm\n(Note: this may take a while , till that time you can go for step 5 )\n5) Do the following pre-requisite things:\na) Create a special chkconfig script :\nThe Red Hat based installer of Oracle XE 11gR2 relies on /sbin/chkconfig, which is not used in Ubuntu.

When it freezes, it freezes completely. I can't use my mouse, keyboard etc. and the sound freezes too. The only solution is to reboot.\n\nA: Could be GPU related, since both watching videos and listening to music videos (if there are a lot of animations) makes the GPU work hard, especially if the driver is not a recent one.

I also want to be able to ping from host machine to guest. \nHere are some detailed information:\n\n\n\n\n\nA: VMWare is running on your host and you set the network to NAT? And you want to be able to ping your host as well as connect to the internet through your machines connection? I'm wondering about your static network configuration, I would have expected VMWare creating a DHCP server for you. Maybe setting the network to DHCP works better (/etc/network/interfaces):\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nBut if you want the server to be able to serve something in your LAN, I would recommend to change the network in VMWare to bridged. Than it will behave as if its another computer in your LAN. It could get its IP settings from your routers DHCP or you set it statically like above to settings fitting your LAN. To have DNS settings as well, you might want to add \"dns-nameservers 12.34.56.78\" (with your DNS servers IP (probably your router)) to /etc/network/interfaces.\nMore information about Ubuntu/Debian network configuration can be found here: https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkConfiguration\n", "Q: Grub is only a command line, and cant see windows I recently set up linux on my main machine, to be compatible with a research group I'm now working with, as a dual boot with windows 10.

The only variable needs to be a randomly generated password. I have a script for that part. I am not sure where to start with automating the install, however. Is there a way to do this? Somewhere I can place a script or config in the iso maybe? Is there a way to interface with and customize the installer iso so I can just tell it ahead of time how to partition, what the hostname is, etc?\nAny help would be eternally appreciated. \nUpdate: This might help someone down the line, so my advice if you have many of the same devices to install and configure on OS on is to pick up a usb rubber ducky and program it to click through the installations and run a post install shell script if need be.\nThe ducky is a programmable keyboard that types for you, and I have successfully used this to automate & configure a bunch of Ubuntu installs, as well as Android tablets. \n\nA: I don't think that there is a short way to do automation to anything, especially when we talk about OS!\nThere will be a number of cases, such as partitioning the disk, only if it will wipe the whole drive and just copy paste the System files without any other consideration.\nWell, you are right when mentioning Shell scripting as a solution to this  because that is why we do coding since the early ages of technology, but I advice you to have a look at this link before you really want to dive into this really WIDE stuff - FAI Project.\nIt says :\n\nIt's a tool for unattended mass deployment of Linux.

When I tried using it on my HP pavilion laptop, I am not able to make the laptop boot from USB. Am not able to figure out how to change the boot order. I want to install Ubuntu on a separate partition and want to retain windows 8 as well. Step-by-Step instructions required please.

I am especially interested in the number of open file descriptors. How is that set for a given process? If it is based on the user who started the process then how is it set for the user?\nHow can I set these limits for a particular user?\n\nA: If you have not changed the value of any resource shown by ulimit, it would use the default value which is what you see while running the shell built-in ulimit -a. Note that the system call inolved in getting the value is getrlimit(2).\nAgain if you need to change the value you need to use setrlimit(2) system call, ulimit does exactly this while setting a new resoure limit for processes.\nThe resource limits shown in ulimit are applied on individual processes, not users.\nTo set the new value for the number of open file descriptors (default is 1024) per process, you can use :\nulimit -n 512\n\nNote that you can check the hard limit and soft limits with ulimit -Hn and ulimit -Sn respectively. You can decrease to any value and increase upto the hard limit.\nTo increase the limit beyond current hard limit (1024) you need to be root.\nNote that you can not increase the value beyond kernel specified maximum.\nNow there is a file /etc/security/limits.conf that is used by pam specifically pam_limits.so upon start of each user session, you can set values here to take permanent effect as ulimit set values only for the running session.\nAlthough you need to set the values on this file on a user/group basis the limits are applicable on per process under that user/group apart from some items like maxsyslogins, maxlogins. /etc/security/limits.conf has sufficient description within the file to get you started.\nAlso check help ulimit, man 2 setrlimit to get more idea.\n\nA: It's POSIX - see man 3 sysconf\nNAME\n       sysconf - get configuration information at run time\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       #include <unistd.h>\n\n       long sysconf(int name);\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       POSIX  allows  an  application  to  test at compile or run time whether\n       certain options  are  supported,  or  what  the  value  is  of  certain\n       configurable constants or limits.\n\n       At  compile time this is done by including <unistd.h> and/or <limits.h>\n       and testing the value of certain macros.\n\n       At run time, one  can  ask  for  numerical  values  using  the  present\n       function  sysconf().

I need to at least recieve APRS packets (that use the AX.25 protocol) inside GNURadio. To do this I was hoping to install the well known software GNURadio Companion, and the pre-written/built software package for it (gr-packetradio) to do this.\nI've got a dedicated computer to do this and I'm willing to format the machine and start over to get it to work. What I need is detailed instructions that will actually get me to that goal.\nCan anyone out there give a guy a hand?\n\nA: Perhaps you could boot into this live distro. http://www.shackbox.net/ I haven't used it myself but I hear it works just fine. \nIf you have a dedicated machine and do a fresh install you're not able to follow the pybomb directions?

In some of these cases you will never be able to host a service because of the NAT part that is not under your control but the ISP. I have found that some providers detect if customers have port forwarding active and try to host services on their boxes, after some time (a few days) of leaving your router configured properly you may be able to connect remotely.\nIf the is the first time you are trying to configure something with this connection/router ask your ISP what their policy is.

I ran Boot-Repair on a live CD and managed to get the Windows Partition back. However grub still doesn't come up for me. \nThe boot-repair url I received was http://paste.ubuntu.com/12189762/. \nEdit:\nOldfred helped me figure out the problem. I didn't really understand how the partition worked. The extended partition wraps around both the linux and swap partition, but for some reason the linux partition was not showing up.

As the title asks, I need both, both Oracle Java 7 and Oracle Java 8. I've installed Oracle 8 (through webupd8), but software I want to run (Gephi) will only work on 7. Please advise.\n\nA: There should not be much of a problem installing multiple versions of the JDK. Only one will be first on the path but you can explicitly run the other as needed by just using its full path name. Depending on how you are running it you may have different settings associated with each program. For example in Netbeans each project has an associated JDK, so when I run some projects it runs with JDK 7 and others run with JDK 8. You could also embed different JDK dirs in startup scripts or .desktop files for each program.\nGephi can be run on a system where JDK 8 is first on the path with the command:\ngephi --jdkhome /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-i386/\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu smart phones Is it possible to install Ubuntu programs like different desktops environments on Ubuntu Touch compatible phones?\nI would like to install an Integrated Development Environment with a GNU compiler on them.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Currently, the Ubuntu Touch SDK can only be installed on full-fledged PCs, so no, there are currently no IDEs that run on the actual phone hardware.\nSorry to be the harbinger of bad news...\n", "Q: Unable to connect via SSH from my PC I am having problems to connect a Linose server via SSH from my ubuntu console.

The Perl script should listen for a TCP connection on some unused port above 1024 and below 65536, say port 12345. When it receives a message (over TCP port 12345), it can generate the pop-up, and wait for the next line.  \n2) On Windows, use putty to connect to TCP port 12345 on the Ubuntu server, and type your message.\n\nA: Grant access\nxhost +local:\n\nor disable access control, clients can connect from any host (bad idea, but seems to be ok in your network)\nxhost +\n\nNow you can do this from your remote connection:\nDISPLAY=:0 xmessage -center \" THIS IS A TEST MESSAGE\"\n\nBellow is a little demo. I have shared session between TTY1 and GUI terminal. As you can see, there's no environmental variable set for DISPLAY, thus that terminal is as if I was working in TTY1.

What I'd prefer is to use zenity dialog. For instance, \nDISPLAY=:0 zenity --info --text=\" THIS IS ZENITY INFO DIALOG \"\n\nA: If it’s a short simple message that you want, you could use notify-send. This will create a short-lived alert message in the top right of the screen (in the same style that Thunderbird uses to alert you to new mail, or Filezilla uses to alert you that a long-running operation is complete).\nnotify-send \"message text here\"\n\nor\nnotify-send \"title here\" \"message text here\"\n\nor, if you really want their attention,\nnotify-send \"title here\" \"message text here\" -i face-angry\n\nwhich will put an angry face (there’s a surprise!) before the message.

I've looked at PulseAudio Equalizer, but it doesn't have the bands I need. Its lowest band is 50HZ, whereas the one on my phone is 16. I've tried applying a small boost with this, but it sounds terrible, and nothing like how it sounds on my phone.\nI also tried using qpaeq, which does have the bands I need (it doesn't show decibels however, perhaps I am using the wrong version?) but I can't seem to get it to apply to my sound output. Nothing sounds different when adjusting the bands. Even when I move them all the way to the top nothing is heard differently.\nI am really stuck.

To run a command before anything in the login process, add something like:\nauth [default=ignore] pam_exec.so /path/to/some/script\n\nFor example, if I use /usr/local/bin/foo.sh containing:\n#! /bin/sh\n\ncat <<EOF >>/tmp/log\nPAM_RHOST $PAM_RHOST  \nPAM_RUSER $PAM_RUSER  \nPAM_SERVICE $PAM_SERVICE  \nPAM_TTY $PAM_TTY  \nPAM_USER $PAM_USER  \nPAM_TYPE $PAM_TYPE  \nEOF\n\nAnd then I do ssh muru@localhost, I get:\n$ cat /tmp/log\nPAM_RHOST localhost\nPAM_RUSER\nPAM_SERVICE sshd\nPAM_TTY ssh\nPAM_USER muru\nPAM_TYPE auth\n\nThis doesn't happen before the password prompt shows up, but auth modules are the first ones run after the password is entered - they check whether the user is authenticated, after all:\n   authentication - authenticate a user and set up user credentials.\n   Typically this is via some challenge-response request that the user\n   must satisfy: if you are who you claim to be please enter your\n   password. Not all authentications are of this type, there exist\n   hardware based authentication schemes (such as the use of smart-cards\n   and biometric devices), with suitable modules, these may be substituted\n   seamlessly for more standard approaches to authentication - such is the\n   flexibility of Linux-PAM.\n\nSo, in effect, auth modules run before login, and if the first auth module is pam_exec, that's pretty much the first thing to run.\nNote the [default=ignore] part - since auth modules authenticate the user, we don't want the script's exit status to mean anything. default=ignore tells PAM to ignore pam_exec's return value, whatever it may be, which in turn depends on the script's exit status. See man pam.d for more details.\nCaveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*This doesn't run if the user just quit before entering any password.\n\n*This doesn't run if the user provided an empty password (the default SSH configuration has PermitEmptyPasswords no, so SSH rejects those out of hand).\n\n*SSH needs to have UsePAM yes for it to use PAM.\n\n", "Q: No apport report written because the error message indicates its a followup error from a previous failure I was trying to install PDF Acrobat in ubuntu 14.04.

Here is a shell code used to track changes in a file and output the content to the terminal:\nwhile read LINE\ndo\n  echo $LINE\ndone < `tail -f /var/log/messages`\n\nIt doesn't work, why?\n\nA: There is no need for a while loop. You try to do two times the same. Also the file /var/log/messages is not present in ubuntu anymore.\nJust use:\ntail -f /var/log/syslog\n\nto track new content that is added at the end of the text file. If something new is written to the end of /var/log/syslog it is printed to your terminal.\nEdit: Why the command in the question doesn't work:\nFirst, of course, /var/log/messages does not exist. But if it would exist, the command between backticks is executed and replaced by its output (minus the trailing newline characters). So the output of tail -f ... would be taken as filename for the input redirection <. What you probably want would look as follows (the the <(...) redirection):\nwhile read LINE; do\n  echo $LINE\ndone < <(tail -f /var/log/messages)\n\nThe <(...) redirection creates a named pipe, where on one end the command tail -f writes to. On the other end the while loop reads the contents line by line. A named pipe behaves likely to a regular file. It is just a connection piece between two commands. BTW, the | does exactly the same, but those pipe are not named, they are the default channels: 0 -> stdin, 1 -> stdout and 2 -> stderr.\nFrom the bash manpage:\n Process substitution is supported on systems that support named pipes (FIFOs) or the \n /dev/fd method of naming open files. It takes the form of <(list) or >(list).  \n\n\nA: The usual portable way of doing this is:\ntail -f /var/log/messages | while read LINE\ndo\n  echo $LINE\ndone\n\n@chaos's answer is using process substitution syntax which is only found in advanced shells such as zsh and bash. You should not rely on their features if you ever need to run your script on a different computer.\nOf course, I assume that you want to put something more complex than echo $LINE into the loop.\n", "Q: Language change doesn't work in ubuntu 15.04 Recently I've installed Ubuntu 15.04, everything had worked fine, but suddenly language change stopped working.

F6 it is possible to access a tty which is a fully-textual and full-screen terminal. But in contrast with the graphic terminal emulator tabs, a new login is required every time and for each new tty.\nIs there a way to avoid this? I would like to be already logged in when I press Ctrl+Alt+F1 ... F6, when I access those text-terminals from the graphic environment (where I logged in!).\n\nA: See man screen, it says, in part:  \nDESCRIPTION\n       Screen  is  a  full-screen  window  manager that multiplexes a physical\n       terminal between  several  processes  (typically  interactive  shells).\n       Each  virtual  terminal  provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal\n       and, in addition, several control functions from the ISO 6429 (ECMA 48,\n       ANSI X3.64) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support\n       for multiple character sets).  There is a scrollback history buffer for\n       each virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving\n       text regions between windows.\n\nI use it on CTRLAltFn screens all the time\n\nA: Ubuntu by default uses agetty to manange TTYs. The man page for that defines -a, --autologin username options for logging in a specified username automatically. Thus one can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open with root permissions /etc/init/tty1.conf file in your favorite text editor. I'm doing sudo vim /etc/init/tty1.conf but you can use pkexec gedit /etc/init/tty1.conf\n\n*Alter the default line exec /sbin/getty -8 38400 tty2 to exec /sbin/getty --autologin myUserName -8 38400 tty2.\n\n*Save and exit.

If you are running it already, lsb_release -a shows this information like this:\n$ lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\nRelease:    14.04\nCodename:   trusty\n\n\nA: There will be a hidden folder called .disk. So, if you are in Nautilus hit Ctrl + H to show hidden files. \n\nInside .disk there is a file called info which if you open, will tell you the Ubuntu version, including the architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).\n\nA 'quick' way to find out the info is to open a terminal and type:\ncat <mount-point-of-usb>/README.diskdefines\n\nReplace <mount-point-of-usb> accordingly.\n\nA: Look at dists/[release name]/Release.

I currently have 15.04 installed. I have tried using both Chrome and Firefox. Chrome (updated) has flash 18, which is good. I've read though that it uses peppered flash, which prevents the drm from passing though giving the OK. So I gave up on Chrome a while back.\nFirefox then blocked flash 17, and caused a great panic that made everyone switch to flash 18. Flash 18 apparently has better security. The problem? Flash stopped supporting ubuntu like years ago. I use to be able to get away with this, because NBC only required 11 or greater, but NOW they require 18 or greater. \nYes I've tried hal (hardware abstraction layer), yes I've removed all the ~/.adobe files, yes i've tried to re-install the plug-in. I've tried most if not all google(able) things, and I'm kind of at a loss for what to do. I've tried using wine, but I need to upgrade to Flash 18 within Wine, which appears impossible right now.\nI guess my only two options are to either get Firefox to use Flash 18, or to get chrome to accept the DRM; neither of which I know how to do.\n\nA: Try Pipelight:\nhttp://pipelight.net/cms/installation.html\nIt's also a good way to get Silverlight for the occasional weirdo site that uses it.\nIn case you have problems, read advice on this page:\nhttp://pipelight.net/cms/faqs/faq-most-common-problems.html \n", "Q: how to install tgcil EST assembler on ubuntu I downloaded TGICL-2.1.tar.gz  file  from sourcforge.\nand  I extract  the file.

There are certain applications that I don't want people to be able to open unless they have root privileges, however I do not want to give the programs root privileges. So how can I make it so that only root can run certain applications, but so that the applications are not actually run as root (I don't want them to be for security reasons)? I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.04, with GNOME Shell, and GNOME 3.16.\n\nA: This answer is complementary to Heather's one (which will work). \nFirst of all, take into account that in Unix (and Linux) if one is able to take root privileges, they can do anything. In the case of Heather answer, nothing will stop your user to just sudo /usr/bin/applicationcommand (with a bit of search for the real path or whatever). But I suppose this is ok with you. \nIn that case, why do not simply(1): \nsudo chgrp sudo /usr/bin/applicationcommand\nsudo chmod 750 /usr/bin/applicationcommand\n\n? If the users are able to use sudo, it means(2) they are in the sudo group; the above commands make the applicationcommand readable/executable only to members of the sudo group. When they run it, however, they will run it as their real user, as any other command. \nHowever, the \"classic\" Unix solution is: \n\n\n*\n\n*create a group, call it privileged.\n\n*sudo chgrp privileged /usr/bin/myapp and then sudo chmod 750 /usr/bin/myapp.\n\n*add the user(s) (unprivileged!) that you want to be able to run the app to the group privileged\nand now the user will run myapp as its user, without any need to have sudo privileges. \nNotice that if you want the application to run as a different user, you can use the set-uid mechanism combined with the above techniques. \n\nFootnotes:\n(1): Notice that you can't do this if the application has a set-gid flag (it happens with some mailer, for example). Check it before changing the group of the binary.\n(2): in most configurations. sudo can be fine-trimmed (see man sudoers) in zillions of way, so the effectiveness of this simple hack will vary depending on how much you have customized it. \n\nA: Try using setuid from package super. Do sudo apt-get install super, then create a shell script that can only be run as root. Have that shell script run only one command:\n#!/bin/sh\nsetuid $ORIG_USER applicationcommand\nexit 0\n\nThen, set an alias for each of the users so that applicationcommand points to the shell script you created by adding into each of their .bashrc files:\nalias applicationcommand=\"sh /path/to/shell/script\"\n\nAlternatively, or as well as creating an alias you can edit the .desktop file of the application you want to run, assuming that your applications has a .desktop file (if it's not an application that runs in the GUI, but rather the CLI it is likely not to have a .desktop file), so that the Exec= line has sh /path/to/shell/script after it, or the name of the alias if you decided to create that. You will find .desktop files in /usr/share/applications and ~/.local/share/applications.\n", "Q: Get mysql to start automatically on startup I realize that there are many questions around here to answer that problem - but none seems to work for me so far.\nI attempted:\nsudo update-rc.d mysql defaults\nThis resulted in a locale error, which I fixed with How do I fix my locale issue? by altering /etc/environment\nLC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\n\nNow, by trying update-rc.d again, I get:\nupdate-rc.d: warning: /etc/init.d/mysql missing LSB information\nupdate-rc.d: see <http://wiki.debian.org/LSBInitScripts>\n System start/stop links for /etc/init.d/mysql already exist.\n\nI found a suggestion on http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1313898 to use:\nuser@computer:/etc/init.d$ sudo update-rc.d -f mystartupscript remove\nuser@computer:/etc/init.d$ sudo update-rc.d mystartupscript defaults\nuser@computer:/etc/init.d$ sudo chmod +x ./mystartupscript\n\nBut do I risk to break my mysql implementation here?

The python-opencv package is required for cinnamon, but not the other way around (obviously).\nThe \"correct\" solution would be to find a later version of python-opencv which is packaged as a .deb file so that the package manager is aware that it is present, and can check if it meets the requirement for the cinnamon package.\nYou cannot simply leave the existing python-opencv package installed, and install your new version over it, because at some later time there may be a patch released which would overwrite your new version, but if you are absolutely confident that you know what you are doing, you could leave the existing python-opencv package installed, and \"hold\" that package so that it is not updated, and then overwrite it with your own version.... so long as your version is compiled to install in the same location.... this is definitely not for the uninitiated tho.... \nYou would use:-\nsudo apt-mark hold package_name\nsudo apt-mark unhold package_name\n\nTo hold the python-opencv package at the current version, and then when compiling your new version, ensure that the PREFIX is set to /usr, not /usr/local for example.\n\nA: It seems that cinnamon does in fact use the opencv library for webcam access.

When you see what is called a \"GRUB\" screen, you need to select the Advanced options for Ubuntu and then chose \"Recovery Mode\".\nWhen you see a screen with about 8 options, you need to use the arrow keys to select \"Drop to Root Terminal\".\nThen when that opens, run the following commands:\nadduser username\n\nthen you will see this (in this example, I replaced username with twimmy:\nAdding user `twimmy' ...\nAdding new group `twimmy' (1001) ...\nAdding new user `twimmy' (1001) with group `twimmy' ...\nCreating home directory `/home/twimmy' ...\nCopying files from `/etc/skel' ...\n\nThen it asks for the username twice:\nEnter new UNIX password: \nRetype new UNIX password:\n\nIf it's successful, it asks for this:\npasswd: password updated successfully\nChanging the user information for twimmy\n\nIt asks the following info, make sure to enter a name (as it's used at the login screen).\nEnter the new value, or press ENTER for the default\n    Full Name []: Tim Hitchins\n    Room Number []: \n    Work Phone []: \n    Home Phone []: \n    Other []: \nIs the information correct?

I want to mount the LFS system but I do not know where the proper place to mount it at. Should I mount it as / (root) or someplace else like desktop with a symbolic link or something like that? \n\nA: From LFS guide:\n\nLFS is usually installed on a dedicated partition. The recommended\n  approach to building an LFS system is to use an available empty\n  partition or, if you have enough unpartitioned space, to create one\n\nSo after you have made partitions using tools such as GParted or fdisk, you'll have to create filesystem on the that partition (possibly ext4 and swap) using mkfs. \nWhere to mount?\nNow, you can mount the parition anywhere you like, but if you are following the LFS book it will be easier for you if you mount the new parition at /mnt/lfs.\nRead chapters 2.2 to 2.5 in the LFS book. It is described nicely there.\n", "Q: Unable to access password protected folder on Windows share I'm able to connect to the Windows share via both the GUI and command line - the share itself does not require credentials, but the folder I am trying to access is limited by username/pw. When I try to open this folder, Ubuntu returns that I don't have permission to access this folder (which is true) but does not prompt me for credentials.\nRunning 14.04 LTS.\n\nA: Windows and Ubuntu have completely different security architectures (Ubuntu being the more secure one) so it just refuses to open the folder (=directory).\nThe correct way of doing this under Ubuntu is to give permissions on that directory to a group and have you as a member of that group and then you will be able to open this.\nAs this is a Windows share, you need to read up on the NTFS permissions here and synchronise both Ubuntu and Windows users using the advanced options of the ntfs-3g driver.\n\nA: Connecting to the server in the format smb://user@sharename prompted me for a domain and password, and I was able to gain access to the share.

I use Ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop at my desk with a second monitor.

But, it seems to me there should be a way in Ubuntu to get an off-screen window back onto the screen.

So, it seems as if the application has something to do with this.\n\nA: Move all windows into the visible area\nAs proposed/requested in a comment, the script below will move all \"normal\" windows to the visible area on the current workspace.\nThe solution is a workaround; the screen info is updated correctly, given the difference in the output of xrandr, before and and after disconnecting. The reason why the windows do not move by themselves is (currently) unknown, unless another answer solves the issue.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\n\n# get the resolution of the screen (+0+0)\nres = [\n    int(n) for n in [\n        s.split(\"+\")[0].split(\"x\")\\\n        for s in subprocess.check_output([\"xrandr\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\\\n        if \"+0+0\" in s][0]\n    ]\n# create list of windows\nw_list = [w.split() for w in subprocess.check_output([\"wmctrl\", \"-lG\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()]\n# filter only \"normal\" ones\nvalid = [\n    w for w in w_list if \"_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL\" in\\\n    subprocess.check_output([\"xprop\", \"-id\", w[0]]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n    ]\n# get the number of valid windows and calculate a targeted position\n# the targeted position is a hunch, it will be exact if the window fits completely inside the resolution\n# it will work anyway\nparts = len(valid)+2\npositions = [(int(n*res[0]/parts), int(n*res[1]/parts)) for n in list(range(parts))[1:-1]]\n# unmaximaize, move the windows to the visible area (current workspace)\nfor i, w in enumerate(valid):\n    subprocess.Popen([\"wmctrl\", \"-ir\", w[0], \"-b\", \"remove,maximized_vert,remove,maximized_horz\"])\n    # weird, but sometimes wmctrl refuses to move a window if it is not resized first (?)\n    subprocess.Popen([\"wmctrl\", \"-ir\", w[0], \"-e\", \"0,200,200,200,200\"])      \n    subprocess.Popen([\"wmctrl\", \"-ir\", w[0], \"-e\", (\",\").join([\"0\", str(positions[i][0]), str(positions[i][1]),w[4],w[5]])])\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs wmctrl:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, safe it as move_windows.py\n\n*Test- run it: open a number of windows, place them on different workspaces etc., or try disconnecting the second monitor. Then run the command:\npython3 /path/to/move_windows.py\n\nAll \"normal\" windows should move to the visible area of the current workspace.\n\n*If all works fine, add it to a shortcut key: choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\npython3 /path/to/move_windows.py\n\nNow you should be able to move all windows into the visible area on the current workspace, with your shortcut key.\n\nA: A simple solution that worked for me in recovering windows left on \"screens\" of disconnected monitors (not quite the same problem as the OP, but related) is using the keyboard shortcut to maximise the window: Ctrl + Super + ↑.\n[N.B. Super is the key with the \"Windows\" symbol on it, usually between Fn and Alt. On a Mac it corresponds to Command = ⌘.

Is it possible to deploy a bare-metal machine with MAAS and create some LXD instances that are registered in a MAAS zone?\n\nA: You might want to lookup:\nGetting Started with LXD\nAlso, you could specify in a .juju/openstack.cfg file like:\nnova-compute:\n  virt-type: 'lxd'\n\n...combined with a deployment like:\njuju deploy --config=.juju/openstack.cfg nova-compute\n\n\nA: I don't believe this is possible right now. MAAS itself isn't aware of LXD containers or of the LXD daemon so containers won't show up in MAAS.\nYou can certainly deploy LXD on top of MAAS managed servers by using JuJu or even doing it manually, but LXD will not be added to MAAS as say libvirt can be. Nor does it really make sense either since LXD containers can't be PXE-booted and so can't run the MAAS installer.\n", "Q: How do I use Java 6 when java 7 is installed?

Why cannot allow specific software (like Firefox) to use internet but deny other software (link Chrome) that are using same port in ufw? In windows there is the feature, why ufw don't have that?\n\nA: You can use apparmor to deny network traffic for some application.\nFirst you must install apparmor and apparmor-utils ..\nsudo apt-get install apparmor*\n\nAfter that you can generate profile to you application ...\nsudo aa-genprof /usr/bin/google-chrome\n\nNext step is to change Networking part in profile to:\nsudo nano /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.chromium-browser\n\naudit deny network,\naudit deny network inet stream,\ndeny network inet6 stream,\ndeny @{PROC}/[0-9]*/net/if_inet6 r,\ndeny @{PROC}/[0-9]*/net/ipv6_route r,\ndeny capability net_raw,\n\nNext, check config with apparmor_parser and reload config\nsudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.chromium-browser\n\nChange mode from complain to enforce aka turn on apparmor for this app.\nsudo aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.chromium-browser\n\nMore manual you can find here and here and here \nSecond solution is more simple but is not completly what you want\nSurfing on net I found trickle.

In order to test to make sure I haven't broken any other functionality I have been attempting to run the provided test suite. Every openstack charm includes a tests directory which contains the steps for running tests. I have been running the following commands on a completely clean ubuntu 14.04.3 virtual machine that has had no other commands run on it (note that the code I am running it on is directly from the repository and does not contain my modifications):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:juju/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -y upgrade\nsudo apt-get install charm-tools\nsudo apt-get install juju-core\nssh-keygen -t rsa\njuju init\njuju switch local\nbzr branch lp:~openstack-charmers/charms/trusty/neutron-api/next\ncd next\nmake test\n\nAfter the last command runs I end up with nearly all tests failing with the error\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"tests/014-basic-precise-icehouse\", line 5, in <module>\n    from basic_deployment import NeutronAPIBasicDeployment\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/next/tests/basic_deployment.py\", line 47, in <module>\n    from charmhelpers.contrib.openstack.amulet.utils import (\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/next/tests/charmhelpers/contrib/openstack/amulet/utils.py\", line 25, in <module>\n    import cinderclient.v1.client as cinder_client \n\nAm I just missing some obvious configuration option or is the test suite broken for all openstack juju charms?

Unit test and Amulet test coverage are indeed going to help speed up the review process.\nI can confirm that the issue that you described is a known issue.  We have merge proposals in flight to address those amulet test dependency issues ahead of the 15.10 OpenStack charm release.  In the mean time, Amulet test dependencies can be satisfied by editing the 00-setup file to make it look like the proposed 00-setup file.\nTo ensure a smooth review and landing of amulet test contributions, proposed amulet test additions should be in the form of new idempotent test_ methods in the tests/basic_deployment.py file.  Each test_ method is exercised against and is expected to pass for all currently-supported Ubuntu + OpenStack combinations, regardless of test_ execution order.\nThe Ubuntu Cloud Archive page provides a chart which describes which combinations are supported at any given point in the release timeline.\nTo ensure a smooth review of added hook features, corresponding unit test coverage should be included so that those code features can be validated.\nOn the broader topic of contributing to the OpenStack charms in general, the OpenStack Charm Development Policy is worth reviewing.\nSpecifically, any proposed changes should be made against the \"next\" (development) charm branches, and not against the trunk or stable charm branches.  In the case of neutron-api, that next branch would be:\nlp:~openstack-charmers/charms/trusty/neutron-api/next\nThank you and feel free to reach out here, on freenode #juju, or on the Juju mailing list.\n", "Q: How can I upload a file to a Garmin 260?

The upper case L does work from all clients.\nI performed this (from: xrdp - how to change keyboard layout):\n$ xrdp-genkeymap /etc/xrdp/km-0409.ini\n\n\nA: this is a known issue with xrdp. \nSpecial keys on keyboard might not be working when connecting through xrdp.  It's possible to fix it by updating the keyboard mapping file used by the xrdp software\nTo fix your issue, you will need to dump the keyboard layout used when no xrdp connection are performed, them dump the keyboard layout in the xrdp session.  You will then compare both files to get the value representing your special keyboard key and update the keyboard mapping file used by xrdp.\nThe process is not easy to describe or summarize. To better understand the issue and the possible solution , I recommend you to read the detailed instructions found here\n\nA: The culprit causing some of the keys not to function in a Remote Desktop xrdp session is Cairo-Dock.  Many people may not have been able to replicate the issue because they don't use Cairo-Dock.  However, every since Unity came to Ubuntu, I have used Cairo-Dock as my launcher in all my Ubuntu installations.  Being one of the first things installed in a new installation, it was in all my remote desktop attempts.\nThe fix is to change the Cairo-Dock's offending hotkeys to a different keystroke, or exit Cairo-Dock.\n", "Q: Error updating mailman Received this error message today doing apt-get upgrade\nSetting up mailman (1:2.1.16-2ubuntu0.1) ...\nLooking for enabled languages (this may take some time) ... done.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/eu  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/eu not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/no  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/no not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/he  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/he not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/tr  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/tr not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/pt_BR  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/pt_BR not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/lt  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/lt not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/sk  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/sk not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/nl  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/nl not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/et  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/et not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/hr  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/hr not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/de  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/de not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/it  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/it not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/zh_CN  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/zh_CN not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/fr  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/fr not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/sr  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/sr not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/zh_TW  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/zh_TW not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/ru  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/ru not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/ja  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/ja not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/cs  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/cs not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/fi  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/fi not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/el  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/el not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/ca  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/ca not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/ar  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/ar not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/sl  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/sl not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/pt  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/pt not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/hu  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/hu not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/es  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/es not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/vi  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/vi not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/ko  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/ko not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/ro  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/ro not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/gl  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/gl not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/fa  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/fa not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/da  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/da not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/pl  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/pl not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/ia  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/ia not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/uk  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/uk not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/sv  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/sv not empty, not removed.\nRemoving unmodified files from /etc/mailman/ast  done.\nDirectory /etc/mailman/ast not empty, not removed.\nInstalling site language en ............................................ done.\nDowngrade detected, from version 0x20112f1 to version 0x20110f0\nThis is probably not safe.\nExiting.\ndpkg: error processing package mailman (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n mailman\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nI am running Ubuntu 14.04.3.

Also I've been mounting it using PCManFM instead of luksOpen because it's easier. \nAnything I'm doing wrong? \n\nA: You are not doing anything wrong. This behavior in fdisk and gparted is expected since you formatted the entire raw device as a LUKS volume, so there is no partition table on the device. The partition table normally resides at the beginning of the device (and also the end of the device for GPT), but it is not strictly necessary if the whole device will be encrypted anyway.\nHowever, I prefer to have a partition table even on devices containing only a single volume (whether it be LUKS or a filesystem) for the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Standard tools will recognize that there is an existing partition even if they do not recognize the contents inside the partition, so they are less prone to accidentally overwrite the contents.\n\n*More flexibility for resizing in the future, in case you want to shrink the volume to create space for another partition.\n\n", "Q: ctags basic usage I am Following tutorials on how to use exuberant-ctags on Ubuntu 14.04.\nI run the commands:\nsudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags\n\nThen I cd into the root folder a project and run:\n$ ctags -R .\n\nI also tried \n\n\n*\n\n*ctags -R *\n\n*ctags -R <folder_name>\nin all cases ctags consumes all computer resources - locking up PC, and I need to kill the process, after which a tags file that is many gigabytes will be sitting in My current directory.\nwhat is going wrong?  \n\nUpdate\n\nAs per @muru request, when I run ctags -R . inside a completely empty directory, newly created ctags file contains:\n!_TAG_FILE_FORMAT       2       /extended format; --format=1 will not append ;\" to lines/\n!_TAG_FILE_SORTED       1       /0=unsorted, 1=sorted, 2=foldcase/\n!_TAG_PROGRAM_AUTHOR    Darren Hiebert  /dhiebert@users.sourceforge.net/\n!_TAG_PROGRAM_NAME      Exuberant Ctags //\n!_TAG_PROGRAM_URL       http://ctags.sourceforge.net    /official site/\n!_TAG_PROGRAM_VERSION   5.9~svn20110310 //\n\n\nA: thanks to @muru pointing me in the right direction, it seems the grunt packages (grunt and/or grunt/less) in the node_modules directory were causing the issue, I removed the grunt packages and now I am getting output that ostensibly seems correct!\n", "Q: How to find why 64 bit application can run on 14.04 but not 12.04?

I have been quite happy, but when I got back to school and plugged in my monitor I was very disappointed. Kubuntu is often not configuring my monitor properly. When I plug in the HDMI cable, I sometime get some sort of tearing (different views within the GUI are being scaled and displayed in distorted ways throughout both monitors). Sometimes, the viewport for the X server is enlarged, but the second monitor is turned off (this creates a panning situation with my single laptop monitor). \nLastly, whenever I remove my monitor, the X server viewport does not change size and I again have an issue of a huge viewport with a 1366x768 monitor (aka panning with the mouse). The extra edges on the viewport aren't usable, though. It's like KDE knows that there shouldn't be anything there, but displays it anyway.\nIn short, it half way initializes the monitor and when I get the monitor to work and unplug it, it only half way removes the monitor from the system. Plus, the odd tearing or malfunctioning rendering problems...\nI've tried using the NVidia Server Settings and the built-in Display Settings module within System Settings to set the default actions, but it never works quite right.\nIf the monitor doesn't turn on and the viewport is resized, I can easily open NVidia Server Settings, turn it on, and voila, it works perfectly, but I shouldn't have to do that!\nAny help is much appreciated.

I have been looking at Live disks with persistence and the fact that you can install Ubuntu to a Flash Drive, but there seems to be no stated way to install Ubuntu on a USB drive with persistence and a way to boot it from any EFI based computer.\nI have a spare 124GB Flash Drive that I would like to run as a \"portable\" Personal OS boot device. In short I want to be able to plug this device into any computer (specifically using EFI but BIOS support is also nice) and run a full Ubuntu distro with all of my personal files and applications on it. I recently have used the mkusb code from another post to try to accomplish this and while it was the closest to what I wanted it was only a persistent version of a Live disk (in other words it was a demo set up to run like a full os.) It was interesting, though, because it made me wonder that if there was a full iso file for the code to use instead of the Live USB iso will it create a persistent, full, boot-able, drive, or (with my current luck) end up being a disaster.\nI have currently looked at nearly every main break off post similar to my question but I have not found an answer.

It is anywhere on the disk.\n\n*The other part is what you can see with any file explorer. This part does not hold any content but the location of the content on the disk. So this part is something like an entry-point to the actual file, which is anywhere else on your disk. (example: this is anyhow like an URL: a piece of information that points to the real content)\n\n\nThis only works inside one file system: There is no chance of having the second part pointing to another hard drive/partition or anything similar.\nThis is the reason why hard links can only be set inside one partition/hard drive.\nWhat are hard links?\nAs explained above a file consists of two parts. A hard link is just another second part: The content stays always the same; but you have two entry points. So two files in your file explorer point to the exact same location on your disk. This is the reason why there is no \"original file\" anymore; they both are the same file. And hard-links can't be set to directories. Hard links are anyhow outdated. There are sometimes situations where you have to use those but they have some disadvantages that soft links don't have.\nWhat are soft links?\nSoft links are also called symbolic links or sym-links. They can be set to directories and even other partitions/hard drives! These are files with one purpose: Pointing to another file. But unlike hard links they are pointing not to the \"content part\" of the file but to the entry point. So the original file is still the unique original file but there is another file that points to it. This is the reason why soft links can be broken: they can point to a file that doesn't exist (anymore).\n\nSo the thing that you are looking for are soft links. You have two directories named /Directory/RealTorrentFile and /SymlinkedDirectory. You want to move RealTorrentFile from /Directory to /SymlinkedDirectory. (It's always a good idea to stop the torrent before you go on).\nFirst move RealTorrentFile to /SymlinkedDirectory and rename it as you like:\nmv -i /Directory/RealTorrentFile /SymlinkedDirectory/ChangedNameTorrentFileOrAnyOtherName\n\nThen create a soft link in the origianl directory pointing to the new directory with the renamed file:\nln -s /SymlinkedDirectory/ChangedNameTorrentFileOrAnyOtherName /Directory/RealTorrentFile\n\nBe aware that RealTorrentFile has to have the same name as the original torrent file. Otherwise your torrent would be very surprised that there is another file :)\nSo that's already it!\nI hope everything got a little clearer about soft and hard links. If you have any further questions feel free to ask!\n\nA: You can start your torrent, stop it, move the directory to the drive with more space and use ln -s to link between those:\nln -s /moar/space/CoolTorrent /torrent/download/dir/\n\nThen start the torrent again and it will be saved in /moar/space/CoolTorrent.\n", "Q: I want to turn of dash search animate The animate of search is slow (I was using Unity Tweak Tools and CCSM to turn some animation off, but search animate on dash is slow still), anyone knows how to turn it off?\n\nA: This would not be possible, at least since 12.04 and beyond this has not been possible. Disabling every single Unity animation would require someone to recompile Unity completely, as the animations are hard coded into it. Another option was available at one point and that was \"Ubuntu 2D\", but that has been marked discontinued for a good period of time.\nSo at this time being, there is no way of disabling the animations that appear in the Unity Dash. The only option that you could do is make the responses quicker, but that would not relate to anything dealing with the animation.\n", "Q: How can I get all of my GMail directories to appear in Thunderbird? In the left pane of Thunderbird, my GMail account e-mail address is listed and under it is \"Inbox\", \"Drafts\", \"Sent\" and \"Deleted\". When I access GMail via the web interface, there are other directories (\"labels\") such as \"SMS\". How can I get these to appear in Thunderbird?\n\nA: According to this source, Gmail uses a special implementation of IMAP. In this implementation, Gmail labels become Thunderbird folders. When you apply a label to a message in Gmail, Thunderbird creates a folder with the same name as the label and stores the message in that folder. Similarly, if you move a message to a folder in Thunderbird, Gmail will create a label with the folder name and assign it to the message.\nYou should switch to IMAP if you're using POP3 and, in \"Server Settings\" for the GMail account, select \"Advanced...\" and then uncheck \"Show only subscribed folders\".\n", "Q: Automatically running ntfsfix on boot? Recently, I set up a nice symlink system so my documents and various things are synced between my Ubuntu and Windows installs. However, this depends (obviously) on my Windows partition being mounted and being healthy.\nThe problem is that Windows and NTFS like being annoying -- marking the filesystem as \"dirty\" and requiring ntfsfix to repair it to allow a drive mount.\nIs there a way to run ntfsfix if the partition fails? If so, how? Is this even a safe thing to do?\n\nA: \nIs there a way to run ntfsfix if the partition fails\n\nYes, a method would be to create a UDEV rule (example with an external USB) and add a \"ACTION\" to run a script that. In that script you can check the health of the disk and, when needed,  run ntsfix.\n\nIs this even a safe thing to do?\n\nI have my doubts. It will delete data from your Windows if that data is only stored in the Windows hiberfile. The correct way to fix this is by turning off hibernation/suspend/fast boot from Windows. \nCommand line powercfg -h off to turn it off.\n", "Q: By default, who is allowed to gain root privileges with pkexec? I learned today that one can use pkexec from the command line, in a manner similar to sudo, to execute programs with root privileges.  I am curious how pkexec decides who is allowed to do this.\nThe man page for pkexec(1) says\n\nBy default, the org.freedesktop.policykit.exec authorization is required unless an action definition file is present for the program in question.\n\nThis is a little challenging to parse for someone unfamiliar with policykit.

I need to be able to update the server through it and such. Many of the links in a previous incarnation of this question (see Is there a secure web-shell for my server?) are broken, as it is now 4 years old. Others haven't been updated since 2006 and I feel in that time there will be huge incompatibility issues, if not security implications.\nI'm looking for something easy to install (I have to do this via TeamViewer or RDP by connecting to a Windows machine then using putty to SSH into the server, and uploading files to the box using SCP or whatever isn't in my bucket list.). It needs to be capable of running on a port other than 80, 8080, 8081, 8181, and 81, since those are already in use, and it must run on another port out of the box (I can't do any initial setup on those ports, they need to be utilised for server uptime diagnostics I'm running).\nBasically, I'd like to access this terminal from behind a secure firewall. I know the machine is safe (it's hosted in my house and I'm particularly careful with it) as it stands. I'd like to keep it that way, so if there's something that Canonical recommends, or that is lightweight and open source (to the extent that I could flick through 3-4 pages of code and see what it's doing), that'd be great. I'm not sure how difficult it is to implement something like this, so excuse me if that's an ambitious expectation.\nTo add to the above, I'd prefer a standalone server application, but would be happy to use something that integrates with apache2 or nginx provided I don't need to rebuild apache to add extensions or whatever.\n\nA: Have you tried http://anyterm.org/, seems like it will work for you.\n", "Q: Bind on non-recursive mode doesn't work I installed bind for caching server and recursive mode works well.

But when I play video using OMXPLAYER it plays it on the whole screen with the correct resolution.\nIs there any solution ?\n\nA: I think this should help you and all rasbperry pi users (no modification to any text files is necessary), I ran into the same problem, where the default was 640x480 resolution, the monitor was unknown and I ended up using xrandr at first and all the other stuff which didn't work. But I realized that ubuntu mate like raspbian does have raspi-config available so you can do is go into the mate terminal then type\nsudo raspi-config\n\nthen you can choose advanced settings then Resolution, you should be able to select optimal resolution settings. After rebooting the changes should take affect. Well for me I chose the 1920x1080 and oddly enough when I checked the display settings it wasn't monitor: unknown anymore but my samsung monitor this time was recognized, you can view it  here, which allowed me to choose from lots of resolutions so I hope this helps the readers too.  \n\nA: maybe you're experiencing the default setting for the overscan.\ntry uncommenting\ndisable_overscan=1\n\nin /boot/config.txt (or /boot/firmware/config.txt on some distros) by removing the # and save (as root)\nhere's a more detailed description.\nEDIT:\nmanpage\n\nA: I made it.\nOpen Terminal.

After modifying /etc/hosts, which service(s) need(s) to be restarted for the change to take effect?\n\nA: If you use dnsmasq (is set by default), then do following:\n$ pkill -HUP dnsmasq\n\n\nA: Theoretically, changes to the /etc/hosts file take effect immediately.\nBut, if you get old hostname after this \n$ hostname\n\nthen, either reboot or restart your network connection... that should show you the right hostname.\n\nA: Actually I noticed that postfix might benefit of a restart to include the new hosts in its local host file version that is available here /var/spool/postfix/etc/ (ubuntu 16.04)\n\nA: For the most part etc/hosts changes should be recognized immediately. If you add a new entry then ping it by name on the machine hosting the etc/hosts file it will most likely ping, that means the etc/hosts update has been recognized by DNS. On a pihole system if you restart the DNS resolver it will pick up the newly-added/edited etc/hosts entries. Most likely it's a function of whatever program is trying to utilize the hosts entries, did it read the current stuff or did it read just at boot time, or like pihole, will it reread by restarting a simple internal function?\n\nA: You need to restart systemd-hostnamed service which is a system service that may be used to change the system's hostname and related machine metadata from user programs.\n/bin/systemctl restart systemd-hostnamed\n\nA: You probably don't need to restart anything, unless there is a temporary cache of the DNS somewhere.

I thought I needed to restart some service, but actually I found it was my fault:\n$ ping remote_hostname\nping: unknown host remote_hostname\n\nThe reason why hosts wasn't recognising a new entry was a typo in the IP address:\n##.2480.##.##    remote_hostname\n\n", "Q: Piping find -name to xargs results in filenames with spaces not being passed to the command Normally to remove files with spaces in their filename you would have to run:\n$ rm \"file name\"\n\nbut if I want to remove multiple files, e.g.:\n$ find . -name \"*.txt\" | xargs rm\n\nThis will not delete files with spaces in them.\n\nA: You can tell find and xargs to both use null terminators\nfind . -name \"*.txt\" -print0 | xargs -0 rm\n\nor (simpler) use the built-in -delete action of find\nfind . -name \"*.txt\" -delete\n\nor (thanks @kos)\nfind . -name \"*.txt\" -exec rm {} +\n\neither of which should respect the system's ARG_MAX limit without the need for xargs.\n\nA: Incidentally, if you used something other than find, you can use tr to replace the newlines with null bytes.\nEg. the following one liner deletes the 10 last modified files in a directory, even if they have spaces in their names.\nls -tp | grep -v / | head -n  10 | tr \"\\n\" \"\\0\" | xargs -0 rm\n\nA: The xargs command uses tabs, spaces, and new lines as delimiters by default.

And its not going from 15.04 to 15.10)\n\nA: Unfortunately, if you wish to \"upgrade\" (Except between LTS versions), you must upgrade in sequence, so from 14.04, you need to upgrade to 14.10, and then 15.04.\nOnce you are on 15.04, and you are fully patched (it will refuse to upgrade if you are not patched fully), you can open a shell and run sudo update-manager -d. The -d option allows it to give you a development version, and it will upgrade from 15.04 to 15.10.\nPlease be aware that upgrading to a development release may give you problems, especially if you have some PPA's installed.

I am not sure as to what extent the damage is to the system and know that these are critical to the system. I hope there is a way to restore them back.\nPlease help. Thanks.\n\nA: It is unlikely that you system is usable after removing the /lib directory, since this contains the runtime linker (e.g., /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.21.so).\nWithout this file you will not be able to run any dynamically linked binaries (which, in general, means everything).\nAny attempt to restore these directories is probably going to be complex and error prone; you are far better off simply starting from scratch.  If you have data on the system that needs to be preserved, you can boot from a live CD and copy it onto another destination (e.g., a USB thumb drive or another host on your network).\nIf you really wanted to try to restore things, the process would probably look something like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from a live CD\n\n*Copy over enough files to get apt working (this will probably include select contents of /lib as well as all of /etc/apt)\n\n*chroot into your broken environment and use apt-get to reinstall all your packages, possibly with a command line like apt-get --reinstall install $(dpkg --get-selections | awk '{print $1}')\nBut even if that works, it probably won't be an exact replica of what you had before.\n", "Q: How do I make a unified patch with diff?

Other applications in Ubuntu play sounds as expected. Firefox, however, won't output any audio through the native speakers or headphones.

Thanks!\n\nA: If you install an app called \"pavucontrol\", (direct link apt://pavucontrol ) you can look at which applications are playing audio, and which device they are sending audio to on a per-application basis.\nBecause (as far as I know) firefox does not have any way to select an audio output device, if you change the output device for an application it will retain that information.... my guess is that at some point you, or someone else (or some application) has selected HDMI audio for firefox, and that has been stored.... you just need to change it back to the default device.\n\nA: Long story short:\nchange audio output device to something else and then back to the desired device\n\nFull version:\nI know it's bit outdated, but still. I've just run into similar problem on Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 - everything worked apart Firefox. I remember lately using my laptop with TV via HDMI and changing sound output to it. Today, in my \"Sound\" application, I had only one position available: \"Speakers - Built-in audio\". Plugging in headphones to my dock or socket on laptop's side didn't change a thing.\nI managed to get it working with some workaround - I suspected that if I will be able to choose something else from the output devices list and then back to \"Speakers - Built-in audio\", Firefox will be updated with this info.

I am interested in knowing the stuffs about Linux,From last 8 months i am addicted with Ubuntu Versions, but still i don't know the difference between actual Ubuntu and Ubuntu Kylin. please give me clear understanding between those two. Is Ubuntu Kylin is available only in chinese language? If not so please give me the latest LTS version of Ubuntu Kylin which can be usable in India. Is it safe for use? and i also curious about differences between different Ubuntu Versions other than normal releases.\n\nA: Ubuntu Kylin is an official flavour of Ubuntu. It is a free PC operating system created for China and complies with the Chinese Government procurement regulations. It includes all the features you’ve come to expect from Ubuntu, alongside essential Chinese software and apps. The interface has been designed specifically to put Chinese users first — and with new support for touch screens and HiDPI monitors, it runs beautifully on all kinds of hardware.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/ubuntu-kylin\n", "Q: Citrix Error \"You have not trusted certificate\" I'm having a problem. I installed Citrix receiver icaclient 13.1.0.285639 in a machine running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I'm attempting to access my Citrix applications, but I get the following error: \n`You have not chosen to trust 'RapidSSL CA', the issuer of the server's security certificate (SSL error 61).`\n\nI have read multiple sites about how I can move the Mozilla certificates to the Citrix folder and attempted the proposed solution, however the problem persists. Currently I also have a Windows machine working perfectly with the server. Is there a way I can download the certificates from the Windows machine and install them in the Ubuntu machine?\nThanks!\n\nA: You don't need to get them from Windows, Firefox has the certificates you need, so you can use them: e.g.\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/* /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts/\n\nsudo c_rehash /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts\n\nI've argued this point with Citrix, but they seem to view the Linux version of the client as a tool for creators of thin client machines, and not as something that an actual user might install.\n\nA: I've had this exact same issue with 13.4 and ubuntu 16.10\nA lot of the answers I've found are nearly correct, but this worked for me after reading this guide: https://www.citrix.com/content/dam/citrix/en_us/documents/downloads/citrix-receiver/linux-oem-guide-13-1.pdf\nsudo cp /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/* /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts/\n\nsudo rename 's/\\.crt/\\.pem/' /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts/*.crt\n\nsudo /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/util/ctx_rehash\n\n\nA: I had similar problem (with icaclient 13.0) under Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Like javy666, regardless what I did with certificates, I was still getting this error. I have installed them correctly into /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts, then I did the rehash with \"c_rehash /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts\", I have also updated directories /etc/ssl/certs/ and /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/ and run update-ca-certificates. Google advised a lot of things that did not help, the same error message still persisted. Then I found out that the problem in my case was that my icaclient did not support SHA256 certificates (it did not support any SHA-2 certificates). The message is unfortunately very misleading, it is probably re-used for multiple different situations. I found out that newer version of icaclient (13.3) supports SHA-2 keys, so upgrading of icaclient solved the problem.\nIt might not solve all the occurrences of this error, but at least some of them.\nThe reason why this may appear just now more frequently is that SHA-1 are not very secure so logically servers migrate to new SHA-2 certificates, which have poor support in slightly older ICA clients and this produces this misleading error. In my case, our company upgraded intermediate certificates to SHA256, unfortunately at the same time they disabled HTML5 client (probably for compatibility reasons related to SHA256), so Citrix  was suddenly completely broken in Linux.\n", "Q: Need help on choosing OS I have an older Toshiba Satellite A205 S5812 laptop.

Currently I have 2 drives in my system, a main SSD where my Windows 8.1 copy is installed, and a 2TB storage drive for all files.\nMy plan is to partition the 2TB hard drive into a 200gb partition solely for Ubuntu. I'm not keen on being asked whether I want to boot into Windows or Ubuntu everytime, so I'm hoping that by making a partition on my HDD and installing Ubuntu on that, I won't be asked every time. If I'm correct, to boot to Windows I just need to boot up from SSD, and to boot to Ubuntu, I just need to boot from my HDD. Is this correct?\nIf so, how would I go about doing this? Do I just install Ubuntu normally from a CD? Would I need any tweaks? \nAny advice is appreciated as I am a novice on this. I would like my Ubuntu installation to be seperate from my Windows, in that I can just delete the partition if I no longer need Linux.\nThanks.\n\nA: A similar question about windows and ubuntu from another user is Windows 10 & Ubuntu read my advice and try reading both articles I linked there.\nYou can alternatively install Ubuntu as a virtual box and try before switching to Ubuntu when you are comfortable.\n", "Q: How do i install less css compiler?

It doesn't saves the selectedIndex into my database.\nIt should restore the selectedIndex from database.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: I'm not 100% certain, but I suspect the problem is that you're storing the database connection instead of re-obtaining it each time you need to access the database.  The LocalStorage documentation says, \"Database connections are automatically closed during Javascript garbage collection.\"  This makes me wonder if the  connection is closed at the end of the openDB() function, as it doesn't recognize that the connection is being stored in a QML property.\nI would change to code so that openDB() calls openDatabaseSync() each time, and returns to the database connection to the caller, which will use it as a local variable.  This is the pattern I've always seen used.\nIt looks like your database initialization code is properly guarded, but there may be a better approach.  The first would be to pass a callback to openDatabaseSync().  This will only be called if the database is just now created, and a database connection is passed as an argument.  Thus, the initialization code can be run inside the call back.  Another approach would be to check db.version after getting the connection.  On first run, this will be the empty string.  In later runs, it will be set to the value passed in openDatabaseSync().  Checking this value is also useful for performing database upgrades.\nAs an example, you can check out this QML file from my project Beru.\n", "Q: Windows 7 not booting after installing Ubuntu 14.04.03 I installed Ubuntu 14.04 to make a dual boot system after a fresh installation of Windows 7 (64-bit, Professional). Windows 7 was installed in UEFI mode on an SSD, after that I shrunk the main partition and booted the Ubuntu boot stick in UEFI as well. Windows at that point worked without any problems.\nI was following a guide, but was not aware of the specifics of UEFI, and here is where I believe I went wrong the first time. \nWhile installing Ubuntu I I created a swap space bigger than my RAM on the SSD and a partition for root formatted in ext4. I also created a home partition on an HDD. What the guide I was using at the time did not mention was telling the installer to change the “Device for boot loader installation” to the EFI partition already there. Instead, it remained on /dev/sda.\nInstalling Ubuntu went off without a hitch, and when I tried to boot there was the list containing Ubuntu and Windows. I then chose Windows, but it would only show a loading bar with \"Windows is loading files\" and then return to GRUB.\nFollowing additional posts I found, I used boot-repair, which resulted in GRUB showing Windows 3 times, but still not Windows loading. I tried a few things more, but it was hard to find information as most of it seemed to pertain to Legacy mode or Windows 8.\nI deleted the partitions, re-formatted the drive again and repeated the process a few times, doing a few things differently, but always returned to the same problem with Windows not booting.\nThe last time, I installed Ubuntu to the HDD instead, with Windows on the SSD, and Ubuntu again works fine, but Windows won't boot. I ran the Windows repair utilities, ran chkdsk /f, but the only thing that produced any change was the physical memory repair. When I did that, when booting Windows, the Windows 7 welcome screen flashed for a second, but returned to GRUB after that. \nRunning chkdsk for the first time also showed a few errors on the SSD, but after that it did not show any more. I also ran TestDisk, which showed everything as ok.\nAt this point I've been at it for two days, and I don't know what to do.\n\nA: Okay, finally got it to work this morning.\nThis time I installed both to the SSD again, making extra sure to direct Ubuntu to the Windows EFI partition during installation.\nThe only two things I really did differently this time was formatting the HDD in GPT and running chkdsk three times on both the SSD and HDD, so thank you very much to oldfred for those suggestions.\nWorked perfectly.\n", "Q: From where Ubuntu help(yelp) reads its files?

So e.g. \"Document->Set Filetype->Scripting Languages->Python source file\" for setting Python\n\n\nIn some cases the so called shebang -- the #!/bin/... at the start of a file -- is also used to determine the file type. \nIn your case, you should ensure you have saved your file with a extension marked as Python and/or choose manually. \n\nA: There is a great collection of syntax highlight themes on Github. Please check:\nhttps://github.com/codebrainz/geany-themes\nJust follow the Unix-like Installation section:\n\nExtract the tarball and copy all of the files in the colorschemes directory to your ~/.config/geany/colorschemes/ directory. Create that directory if it doesn't already exist.\n\n\nA: Besides connecting the file extension to a file type (like mentioned in frian's answer), there is a general setting that was overseen by me. Make sure that in \n\n\n*\n\n*View --> Color Schemes... \n\n\nthere's not an entry selected that says \"null\" as the bracketed value. Im my case, this was: \"github.conf (null)\". You can either pick one of \"Standard\" or \"Alternate\" or even add further color schemes as described in Michal's answer. \n", "Q: How to install i386 (32bit) boost-regex library to amd64 (64bit) system, 15.04 I tried to use this command:\nsudo apt-get install libboost-regex1.55-dev:i386\nAnd i have some errors:\n\nReading package lists...

Does this have any negative side effect on other system programs?\nPS. I would change the permission of /var/log/wtmp through /etc/logrotate.conf and the permission of /var/run/utmp through /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh.\n\nA: Changing it to 660 does not cause any problems if you do it through logrotate.conf. That is the proper way to do it.\nYou can however test it by changing it manually\nsudo su\nchmod 660 /var/log/wtmp\n\nwould be the 2 commands to do this. For example the command \"last\" will then show a \"permission denied\".\nSetting it to 644 will cause problems though: the file will no longer be updated except for the users in the group (and there should be none in it).\nSame goes for \"utmp\".\nCommands related to these 2 files are for instance \"last\", \"w\" and \"who\".

To get over it you need to use bash functions.\nAn example will make you more clear :\n$ cat file.txt \nfoo\n$ cat bar.txt \nfoobar\nspamegg\n$ grep -f file.txt bar.txt \nfoobar\n\n$ alias foo='grep -f \"$1\" bar.txt'  ## Alias 'foo'\n$ foo file.txt \ngrep: : No such file or directory\n\n$ spam () { grep -f \"$1\" bar.txt ;}  ## Function 'spam'\n$ spam file.txt \nfoobar\n\nAs you can see as the first argument in case of alias foo is being added at the end so the command foo file.txt is being expanded to :\ngrep -f \"\" bar.txt file.txt\n\nwhile in case of function spam the command is correctly being expanded to :\ngrep -f file.txt bar.txt\n\nSo in your case, you can define a function like :\ngr () { xmgrace -legend load -nxy \"$@\" -free -noask & ;}\n\n", "Q: Routing internet protocol with either bird or quagga packages I would like to advertise routes with RIP (either version 1 or 2).

It also has (had?) ISIS support. \nIt boils down to what you need. I've heard bird is focused very heavily on BGP, but Quagga is definitely no slouch in that area either.\nHere's a NANOG list thread from 2010 that I was a part of with some info on the Bird vs. Quagga dilemma, and another thread from the same group dated only a couple of years ago.\n", "Q: libvirt networking problem: Host cannot access Internet (while guests can!)

You could try to ifdown br0; ifup br0.  You would expect to see the default route on your system going out br0 and not eth0, given your configuration.\neth0 should not have any ip address assigned.\nNote that bringing the bridge down and up may interrupt internet access from your virtual machines such that they need to be restarted (I'm not sure if it will or not but I'm not able to test that at the moment).\n\nA: There seems to have been an outside cause. The switched network was configured in a way that does not run the STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) and therefor disconnects ports that send STP packets. In the network config bridge_stp yes led to sending theses packets. However, it is unclear how the VM guests could still communicate with the outer Internet. Anyway, the problem is now solved - thanks!\n", "Q: Restore default ppa settings I accidentally removed a ppa and now I am unable to download any app from app center. How can resolve it?

They are personal package archives; the default is no PPAs, so it's unlikely removing one would cause your symptom \"unable to download any app from app center.\"\nIf you need to replace your default main source settings (e.g. /etc/apt/sources.list), this online tool can generate the files for you: http://repogen.simplylinux.ch/\n", "Q: Recommended partition setup for two 128 GB SSDs I have two 128 GB SSDs and want to install Ubuntu with them. At first I filled the first disk with a / partition. Then I made the second disk have a big /home partition.

You could use a filesystem that can use more than one partition or you could use LVM to make a 180gb /home and a ~64gb /. Honestly though, I think thats overkill for a simple private system. I always use symlinks in these situations:\n\n\n*\n\n*When your /home reaches 75% find a bigger directory that won't change size that much\n\n*Create /home2/username on / and chown to your user\n\n*Move the bigger dir to /home2/username\n\n*And link it with 'ln -s /home2/username/Music ~/Music'\n\n\nA: A modern solution would have been to format both partitions in BTRFS, may be link them all in multi-disk setup and use virtual partitions over it. It would have allowed you to utilize all free space without worries where folder is kept or create extra robustness by duplicating data + a load of cool features. \n", "Q: Wireless disabled problem I had a problem with wifi on my Lenovo g50-30. wifi was disabled.

UEFI boot, guid/gpt partition table. The ubuntu live pendrive is booted in UEFI mode. When I started the custom installation it asked me where to install grub. I selected the whole disk (dev/sda) and continued. When it finished and rebooted, it booted into Windows 10, and Windows 10 doesn't recognize any other OSes. It's because of the UEFI partition, with only Windows boot manager installed. So what do I need to do in order to install grub in the UEFI partition without deleting Windows Boot Manager? Do I just have to select \"Install GRUB in dev/sda2 (UEFI partition)\"? Will it keep Windows Boot Manager, as said in the UEFI wiki article? (I have read many post and the uefi article but none of them say what to do in my case.) \nThanks \nQuotes from the wiki:\n\"If your disk already contains an ESP (eg if your computer had Windows 8 preinstalled), it can be used for Ubuntu too. Do not format it.\"\n\n\"Note that in a UEFI-mode installation, Ubuntu will not ask you where to install the boot loader.

You can create new partition  by shrinking your existing partition from windows in disk management tool without loosing your data or you can also use gparted from live ubuntu.\n\nA: My toshiba (EFI/GPT) started with pre-installed w8.1, and using a usb stick (unetbootin), I simply shrank w8 into a 40 GB 'broom closet'  and then installed Mint (Ubuntu).\nI then had to use boot-repair-disk (see below) to stop windoze always behaving like it was the only kid on the block.\nThe usb was prepared using unetbootin in w8.1 and thus probably automatically booted in uefi mode, and installed its boot loader directory (and grub/loader) therein.  \nIf you can log into your Ubuntu installation, open a terminal and \ncd /boot \nls -al\nlook for a directory called efi (if it isn't there, your ubuntu isn't a uefi installation)\nIf efi is there, \ncd ./efi\nls -al\nand you'll probably see yet another set of directories, including one called EFI so\ncd ./EFI\nand look for a directory called ubuntu\nIf it's there, your ubuntu is pretty definitely installed under uefi, and all you need is to download a copy of boot-repair-disk (google it) prepare a bootable usb via unetbootin in windoze - boot it and follow instructions.  (boot-repair may already be on your ubuntu install pendrive) \nIf you haven't actually finished installing Ubuntu, go back into windoze, google unetbootin and install it, re-prepare your pendrive with your ubuntu iso using unetbootin in windoze, shut windoze down and boot into the pendrive, use gparted to shrink windoze main partition create ext4 partition and swap and 'manually' install ubuntu in the ext4 one.\nThen reboot.\nYou may find yourself only offered windoze, and if so, download boot-repair-disk, re-do your pendrive using unetbootin and your boot-repair-disk iso.  reboot into that, and follow the default instriuctions.\nEverything should be ticketty boo.\nHope that's some help\n;)\n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu onto a software RAID 10 array? I'm planning to set up a low-traffic server using RAID 10 with four disks.  I'd like to have Ubuntu 14.04 installed onto that RAID array.  I've seen plenty of guides explaining how to set up RAID 10 using mdadm with the OS on a separate disk from the array, but the only thing I've heard about putting the OS on that array is that it doesn't work because GRUB doesn't work on RAID 10 (that information was five years old).  How can I set up a system that has all of its data on the array?  I want to be able to run when any of those four drives fails.\n\nA: It's not really an direct answer for your problem, but if your goal is to have the system run even when one drive fails, a raid 5 would do just that and give you more disk space.\n\nA: How does your system boot? Via EFI or MBR (CSM)? If the former, I can't see why you couldn't use my guide, but create a RAID10 instead of RAID1 in steps 2+more. For maximum redundancy, I would clone the EFI boot partition to all four drives.\n", "Q: How to install Plasma 5.4 on Kubuntu Can anyone tell how to upgrade Kubuntu 15 plasma to 5.4?\nI found these commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nBut after restart I still have plasma 5.3.

But, I did try another separate usb. Used Unetbootin to make Ubuntu 14.04.3LTS Live USB. Booted with live USB. Once booted I used gparted to delete and format all partitions. I formatted my msata to a ext3 partition instead of ext4. Mounted the msata as / and I formatted my hdd as /home as ext4, I also put an 8GB swap on my HDD. Rebooted..... WORKS GREAT!!! For some reason using the root file system as ext4 format did not work on my computer, when I changed it to ext3 it worked great. Also verified that my /home directory is my 1TB HDD and it is.

I have a .mysql database file. I need to open it and view the data. I've MySQL Server & MySQL Workbench installed into my Ubuntu 14.04.\nNow how do I open the .mysql file and view the data inside it?\n\nA: The data is visible in any text editor, albeit it is in mysql format, to put it in a database you can import it to one, if you want you can create a database with \"create database\" command, next if you want to assign a separate user create a separate user with \"grant\" command for that database, flush privileges and quit mysql prompt. Now you can import .sql file to database by: mysql - u \"username\" -p  'databasename' < filename.sql  I use an extra space inbetween -p and databasename so it will prompt for password and not log the mysql user password in the system command history. if you require the actual commands let me  know. If you are looking for an easier option to view install phpmyadmin and import the .sql file. this will give you a frontend to view the data. \n", "Q: Cannot resolve the \"This web page has a redirect loop\" problem I am getting  Error message This web page has a redirect loop  on Chromium when I want to watch a movie on Netflix (the home page works very well, it is just the video player)\nI followed the instructions into clearing the Cookies from Chromium Settings and using BleachBit, but I still receive that error. \nI am using Ubuntu 15.04 but the same problem occurs on 12.04\nI searched for a solution everywhere without success.

Can someone just help address this concern: some user is claiming to have had his computer crash in a similar situation :\nhttps://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=64425\n\nA: This message is not specific to you. \nFirst of all this is not an error, this is a warning message made simply so that people are careful to not erase their disk if they don't want to. You however are installing this on a virtual machine. \nA virtual machine is like a separate computer inside your own computer, so it cannot erase the disk inside your actual computer. Not even if you tried, so you can safely press the Continue button\nAs for the computer crash, don't worry it seems to have been some specific issue with the virtualbox software so it probably will not affect you. He had an issue with the fact that he had some VM files on another partition on his actual fisical disc and that got messed up somehow.\nIf you follow the default options for Virtualbox, that will not hapen to you.\n\nA: If you are installing this within VirtualBox then you are fine to erase the disk since it is a virtual disk within VirtualBox only. \n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on Win 8 Tablet I know this may seem a little bit duplicated, but my problem is more worse. It's like this:\nI have got a Win 8 tablet pc, which uses EFI boot option instead of UEFI. But what make it worse is that it seems like the tablet doesn't support USB boot options. It just doesn't have this module when you go into boot menu and select it.\nAnd, as well suggested by most articles, wubi should not be used. As a matter of fact, I've tried every way I can get and failed.\nAfter all, I just hate Windows and want to install a Ubuntu on it, whether it's Desktop or Touch. Can anyone tell me some possible approaches, or should I just give up? Thanks very much.\n\nA: Installing and running Linux on this device is a challenging task. It would require  intermediate to advanced knowledge in Linux. \nThis is because the Linux kernel shipped with Ubuntu Desktop doesn't entirely support the hardware(It's made for Desktops!), and so many non-critical hardware like WiFi, Audio, Webcam may not work. Still it's possible. But the ultimate solution \nHence you will have to try third-party kernel modules, find and install opensource drivers for not-working hardware manually, test different kernels etc. to get the entire system working.\nThat being said, here is a good guide which will get you going. Some excerpts from the page which answers your question:\nYou need to boot Ubuntu USB on the device. As mentioned in the above page, this computer has a UEFI firmware without legacy mode emulation (or disabled). What we will do is to load grub on the device and manually boot Ubuntu from it. Fot this, you will need a externally powered USB hub, and two flash drives, one with the boot loader and other with Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the UEFI menu and Disable Secure boot. To make a bootable USB stick, format the other USB drive in MBR format  with a single FAT32/LBA partition (type 0x0C) and put the bootloader as EFI/boot/bootia32.efi.\n\n*Generate the grub image with the modules specified in the guide.\n\n*Boot into the USB and GRUB should load.\n\n*Now manually boot into the Ubuntu USB from the grub command line.

I would like to not only install an Ubuntu edition from a USB, but keep the OS on the USB drive all the time. The idea is to have my private OS on my work laptop.

One trick is to use hardlinks on an EXT4 drive. This means that if files don't change, they will appear in every snapshot, but will only exist (and be copied to the drive once). Here is script I've used before:\n#!/bin/sh\nNEW_FOLDER=\"$(date +%F\\ %H-%M-%S)\"\nrsync --archive --human-readable --progress --link-dest /media/current \"/etc/\" \"/media/incomplete/\"\nmv /media/incomplete /media/'$NEW_FOLDER'\nrm -f /media/current\nln -s /media/'$NEW_FOLDER' /media/current\n\nBy using an incomplete folder, if the backup is stopped halfway through (very useful for large backups), it will pick up again when you next try. You can then browse each folder as a complete incremental backup. This is a similar approach to Apple Time Machine.\nIf you don't want to use hardlinks to save space, and don't mind file duplication, remove the --link-dest /media/current setting.\n\nA: Rsync will perform incremental backups by default, but probably not with the result that you expect. The command \nrsync -av /etc/ /mnt/\n\ntransfers only changed files. For that, it compares the content of /etc and /tmp. If you add a computed date, eg /tmp/$(date), the target folder is empty and therefore, all files will be transfered again.\n\nThe options --backup and --backup-dir are only useful, if you need a backup of the files, which would be deleted, if you start the rsync command with the option --delete.\n\nSummary\nTo create true incremental backups, you will need another tool, eg. rsnapshot.\n\nA: I've been looking for an answer here before and went with @Hadog's answer at first. It works perfectly, until you run rsync over a network connection and it has a hickup while connecting. Rsync will simply exit and not try again. The problem is that although it fails, the symlink is changed to a new folder that is non-existant (broken link), leading rsync to ignore --link-dest. That means, a full copy is made again instead of using hard links.\nHere is my variation of @Hadog's script with improved error handling:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# determine how the new folder should be called\nNEW_FOLDER=\"$(date +%F\\ %H-%M-%S)\"\n\nrsync --archive --human-readable --progress --link-dest $PWD/current source \"$PWD/destination\"\n\n# get exit code of rsync. -> don't put anything between this line and the rsync command!\nrsync_exit_code=$?\n\n# if the rsync command exited with a code that we consider \"successfull\" ...\nif [ \"$rsync_exit_code\" -eq \"0\" ] || [ \"$rsync_exit_code\" -eq \"23\" ] || [ \"$rsync_exit_code\" -eq \"24\" ] \nthen\n    # move files to their actual destination\n    mv $PWD/incomplete $PWD/\"$NEW_FOLDER\"\n    \n    # remove the old symlink\n    rm -f current\n    \n    # set the symlink to the newest backup that we have just created\n    ln -s $PWD/\"$NEW_FOLDER\" $PWD/current \nelse\n    echo \"No moving of incomplete folder! Rsync exited with code $rsync_exit_code\"\nfi\n\nThe significant difference is the condition. We should only reset the \"current\" symlink if we actually have a new working backup. For my example from above where building the network connection fails, that will mean that the backup script exits without retrying. A retry would be to re-run the script. Instead of using if conditions, you may want to use a do-while loop to retry the rsync command until it succeeds.\nIn my code, I consider rsync's exit codes 0, 23 and 24 successful. Here is what they mean (see rsync man page for all codes):\n\n*\n\n*0: success\n\n*23: Partial transfer due to error\n\n*24: Partial transfer due to vanished source files\n\nUpdate 4 months after posting: script as provided above hasn't caused any issues so far so I'm confident to say that at least for me it's stable.\n", "Q: Syslog still receiving entries after filter to sepaqrate file I am trying to get remote devices to into separate log files and not in the main syslog file. \nI have created a filter for remote devices to go to a separate file per host, but still remote devices log contents end up in main syslog.

There is a setting called unsupported updates vivid-backports in the update-manager. What exactly does this setting and is it recommended? (The linked question doesn't answer my question.)\n\nA: The following is adapted from UbuntuBackports:\n\nWhat are backports?\n\nBackports is feature that offers a way to provide newer versions of software for older Ubuntu releases. generally, there backports or \"new versions of standalone applications\" can be safely updated without breaking the rest of the system. Although this is the 'common' case, few points should be noted:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backports do not come with any security support guarantee and Ubuntu Security Team does not update packages in Backports.\n\n*There may be some unwanted interactions between backported software and other software installed in your system that are overlooked while backporting.\n\n*Backported software may sometimes behave in unfamiliar ways, and may be incompatible with configuration format etc.\n\nIs it recommended?\n\nFor the above reasons, it is recommended to configure the package manager to only install backported packages when they are explicitly requested, which is the default for all Ubuntu releases after and including Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal). That means even though the Ubuntu Backports repository is now enabled by default, to enable users to more easily receive new versions of software, the packages from backports will not be installed by default.\nIf Backports are configured for manual install (which is the default configuration in 11.04+), you can append /trusty-backports(or your release) to the package you want to install. For example, to install a single package, run:\napt-get install amarok/trusty-backports\n\nOnce installed, packages from backports will automatically be upgraded to newer versions.\n", "Q: How to protect PGP key details against be snooped?

Or can you just kept your PGP key details hidden on an encrypted volume, and take them out when you want to encrypt or decrypt some message?\nI haven't been able to prove the later.\n\nA: As for all infosec related questions, the first thing to consider is who is the attacker you want to mitigate. Then, elaborate possible attacks he might perform, and how much effort your data is worth to him.\nYou will never be able to prove safety. You'd need to prove safety of not only the whole software in use (including operating system and application software), but also the hardware and cryptographic algorithms in use. Right now, science still fights with proving very minor snippets of software, far away from even proving GnuPG or similar applications.\nAll you can do is consider possible (known, expected) attack vectors, select by the value of your information to the attacker and apply appropriate counter measures. To get a maximum extend of security, consider using an offline machine not connected to any computer networks inside a protected vault. Does not seem appropriate? Very likely it isn't, but you'll have to choose somewhere in-between convenience (and cost effectiveness) and safety.\nEncrypted Hard Drive\nAll together, not even encrypting your hard drive will be safe, if you put your machine into sleep mode and the attacker is able to read the memory (with a large amount of effort), or even modifies/backdoors your hardware (or simply gets hold of the running machine, while it's unlocked). Malwared software will obviously also expose your private keys.\nEncrypting your hard drive, including swap space, is probably enough against most attackers.\nEncrypted GnuPG Home Directory\nIf you only want to be sure a \"casual\" attacker (no special hardware support, no much deeper than \"off-the-shelve\" IT knowledge) or thief of your computer does not get access to the information stored in your GnuPG keyring, an encrypted volume should be fine. Possible attack vectors I can imagine:\n\n\n*\n\n*temporary files left over\n\n*your mail store, which contains encrypted/signed mails\n\n*malware that accesses your keyring while it's unlocked/sniffing your passphrase\n\n*admin users accessing your keyring while it's unlocked/sniffing your passphrase\n\n*...\n\n", "Q: How to scale intel_pstate driver on Ubuntu 15.04? I nearly tried all the solution to scale the cpu frequency but no success. I have Intel Core i5-3210m 2.5Ghz-3.1Ghz. I want to permanently set it to 1.6Ghz with no turbo boost to improve battery timings. Please tell it accordance with intel_pstate driver.\n\nA: To limit the upper CPU frequency with the intel_pstate driver to 52% do:\necho \"52\" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct\n\nNote 1: In calculating 52%, I have assumed that you have turbo enabled, for a max pstate of 31. Therefore 1.6 / 3.1 = 52%. If you have disabled turbo then the number would be 64%. There is no need to specifically disable turbo, as with this limit, it will never go into the turbo range anyhow.\nNote 2: Depending on your applications and processor, limiting CPU frequency might not result in the longest battery life. In some cases, completing the task faster, via higher CPU frequency, and therefore allowing some CPUs to go into deep sleep (highest C state) sooner and for longer, can result in less power consumption overall.\nNote 3: The solution is not permanent, and the setting will be lost upon re-boot. I suggest you try it for awhile, report back and then we can think about how to make it permanent. There are other higher level tools for this, but I never use them. Someone else might provide another anwswer involving the higher level tools.\nAn example (different processor, different numbers).

I know backporting is being done, but I do not know the release timelines.\nTo make the change always occur during boot, first make it a script, for example:\n$ cat set_cpu_max_perf_pct\n#! /bin/bash\n\necho 52 >/sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct\necho -n \"intel_pstate maximum performance request is (percent): \"\ncat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct\n\nTest the script, running as sudo.\nThen refer to one of the many other questions and answers that address making it run during boot.

I understand from this that it is best for detecting Windows malware, but can it also detect Linux malware?\n\nA: ClamAV does detect viruses for all platforms. It does scan for Linux viruses as well. However, there are so few viruses ever written for Linux that a Linux virus is not a huge threat.\n\nUnix-like systems (which eventually led to Linux) has been around for roughly 30 years, and Windows has been around for about 20 years.

It is not working anymore (I tried low-level formating etc...) And I want to install lubuntu on my usb drive. but I want to keep my changes on my external hdd.\nOr;\nIs there any chance to install lubuntu on my ext hdd without losing data\n\nA: If the pc boots off usb you can install directly to the external hard drive and boot entirely off that. However acessing everything off a usb drive will work but will be slightly slow compared to new sata drives. If you have a usb flash drive you could use live session and save everything to to the hard drive but this would not get latest security updates. You could make a /home partition on the usb hard drive but you will not get security updates on the usb flash drive without persitance. Also usb flash drives as flash memory are limited in the number of writes and do not get the speed of say a sata solid state drive because at there low price point and to use only enough power to run of usb they do not have the best controller to get the data stored electrictally in the nand cells. \nWhat I would do is just run everything off the external hard drive. Running a / partition on the a smaller flash drive will probably result in wearing the flash drive out over prolonged use. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_leveling is minimal on these usb drives as they are generally to like save photos to transfer files not designed to run an operating system on but they are inexpensive and small. \nWith that in mind I would end up booting the live installer to the external hard drive removing other disks as this can make things more complicated if the installer. However most extenral hard drives purchased from stores come ntfs formatted for windows or sometimes there are ones for mac os X with hfs + with one partiton for the entire drive. I would still want another backup copy of my data. I think taking out the broken hard drive may make things easier if you can open the case of the machine. And if it detects the install on the internal it might try to dual boot the internal drive and external drive which leads to a more complicated setup and is more error prone. Then I would physically remove the bad hard drive as it will only waste power or make things trikier by trying to save the disk. I recommend selecting something else at the installer at this step. If you do not have any data kept on the external hard drive and you had say another backup say on another external hard drive you could delete the entire ntfs partition and replace it with ext4 the defualt. Or you could leave the ntfs partition if you interface with windows computers a lot and want to still be able to tranfer files to it normally. Over usb resizing the partitions can take quite a while. When selecting manual partitioning you will also get to choose the bootloader. You do not want to select the small usb flash normally unless you have problems booting from the external hard disk. \nenter your information and install like you normally would and then reboot press enter remove the usb. In bios or uefi you want to set the machine to boot from usb as defualt. However sometimes external hard disks that are the small 2.5 inch laptop drives booting off usb can cause situations where the drive is not initalized at startup and it does not load the bootloader properly from the hard disk. On my 1 tb seagate expansion drives I find sometimes it has enough power to initlize the drives on reboot but not from booting when powered off. However if you keep the usb flash drive as the live session and then reboot remove that you can get it to boot of this external laptop drive. If you had say an desktop external hard drive with a power cord that plugged into the wall then it would gets its power through that and not be complicated. Once you boot from the hard disk you should be good to go.  \n", "Q: VMware Player - Failed to build vmnet.

I suggest you create a copy of the running kernel somewhere first just in case you make a mistake.\nYou can remove old kernels several ways.\nJust deleting them (not recommended).\nUse a tool: How do I remove old kernel versions to clean up the boot menu?\nOr manually remove with package manager:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/RemoveOldKernels\n\nAlso to identify what is taking up all the space.  From a shell type the following commands and post the output.  Also what filesystem type is /boot I presume ext4?\ncd /boot\ndu -sk *|sort -n\n\n\nA: I finally found out how to solve this:\nThere was a trash folder inside the \"boot\" partition taking up all the space. You need to log on as root to be able to see and delete the files inside that trash folder, by clicking Shift+Delete, otherwise the files will just come back into existence after one second, in the exact same folder.\nVoilá! :)\n", "Q: Creating system sounds I'm trying to set up individual system sounds for ubuntu 15.04. I've read some instructions but they're a bit pithy for me.\nIs there an app to add? \n\nA: Sound themes are located in /usr/share/sounds/ , there should be 2 real themes \"ubuntu\" and \"freedesktop\".\nNow copy one of those 2 directories to ~/.local/share/sounds/, change its name and change the name in the index.theme file. If you are not that linux-savy to copy directories from root ownership to your home folder and change ownership to urself, you could alternatively download the freedesktop theme here: http://people.ubuntu.com/~dylanmccall/soundgallery/ and put it to ~/.local/share/sounds/\nNow you are good to go, exchange soundfiles with whatever you like. Make sure to keep the names of files and the .ogg format.\nTo change the soundtheme, install dconf-editor, open dconf-editor and change value org.gnome.desktop.sound.theme-name to the name of your new theme. Done.\nYou might need to logout and back in to activate the change in sound theme.\nHave Fun.\n"]
