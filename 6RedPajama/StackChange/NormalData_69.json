Is there anyway I can automatically have my iPad unlock when I pick it up, so its ready to use straight away?\n\nA: Unlike the recent crop of iPhone and iPad Pro, iPad mini 5 doesn't feature Face ID. It comes with a physical Home button with a Touch ID built-in. Neither does it feature Raise to Wake setting, which automatically wakes the screen when you pick up the device.\nSo there's no way you can configure it to unlock without a physical intervention required from your end.\nThe best/fastest you can do it to configure it to unlock just by resting your finger on the Home button. Go to Settings → General → Accessibility → Home Button and enable Rest Finger to Open.\n\nThis way, you can speed up the process of unlocking your iPad and making it ready for use. Once the setting is enabled:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your iPad screen is turned off, simply pressing the Home button will both wake and unlock it.\n\n*If your iPad screen is awake, just resting the finger will unlock it and get it ready to use.\nThe aforementioned (picking up the iPad, while keeping your registered finger, generally thumb, on the Home button) is the fastest you can go from picking up your iPad to taking it to the unlocked usable state.\nAdditionally, with the screen awake, you can swipe left to launch the Camera app. The iPad mini 5 also works with Apple Pencil 1st generation. Thus, tapping on the screen with the Apple Pencil will directly launch the Notes app with a new note.\n", "Q: How to open/use/enable Spotify Desktop Web Player on iOS? Is there any trick to use the Desktop version of Spotify’s browser-based web player on an iOS device (e.g. iPhone)? On a Mac you can access it for instance using Chrome at open.spotify.com/browse. On the iPhone however you'll always get an \"Unsupported Browser\" warning regardless on whether you try Chrome, Firefox or Opera.\nAccording to my knowledge iOS is forcing those browsers to use Apple’s Web Kit, which is probably the reason for the incompatibility, due to the fact that Spotify has dropped Safari support long time ago.\nExplicitly requesting the Desktop view via iOS’ share sheet (or using the Puffin web browser) gives you a slightly wider layout, but there’s still no login option and no full-fledged web player.\nSo the question is, whether there is any workaround!? Preferably with included support for uBlock Origin... ;)\n\nA: Try iCab http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/icab-mobile-web-browser/id308111628?mt=8\nIt will allow you to set the \"User Agent\" of the browser to pretend that you are using a different web browser, so you can tell Spotify that you are using the \"desktop\" version of Safari on the Mac, or Firefox on the Mac, or even Chrome, etc.\nYou can check your browser's User Agent at http://ua.luo.ma/ too. If it says anything about \"iPhone\" then Spotify will probably give you the \"Unsupported Browser\"\n\nA: The problem is that Safari on iOS does not support Encrypted Media Extension (a.k.a. DRM), so there is no way for Spotify to play the files without breaching license agreements.\nCheck:\nhttps://caniuse.com/#feat=eme\n", "Q: How to install High Sierra on a second partition on a MacBook which already runs Mojave? I am running macOS 10.14 Mojave on a MacBook Pro with a single APFS volume. For testing I would like to intall macOS 10.13 High Sierra on a second volume / partition to be able to switch between the two versions.\nI found a lot of tutorials how how to add Mojave when using High Sierra. However, the other way round (adding the older High Sierra to the newer Mojave) seems to be not that easy.\nLuckily I still have a the old High Sierra installer file, so this problem is already solved. However, when trying to run the installer I only get a waring, that this file is too old to run on the current os (Mojave). So I cannot even start the installation.\nAny idea how to solve this?\n\nA: There is a simple solution. \n\n\n*\n\n*Using Disk Utility create a second Partition for the High Sierra:\n\n\nProbably your disk is in APFS, so simply use \"+ Volume\" button at the top left of Disk Utility app, give new Volume a name (for example \"Test HD\").\n\n\nIf there is a need to install OS that can't be installed on APFS (for example Sierra and earlier) use \"Partition\" button to create separate HFS+ Volume.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Then, create a USB flash installation disk of High Sierra using terminal:\n\n\n\nUSB disk needs to be formatted with a GUID partition table (GPT).

The first one works in most cases except where I'm trying to connect to an enterprise network that uses a certificate. For some reason connecting this way doesn't work in that case. But in all other cases both scripts work great.\n\nA: I note what @Allan has stated in his comment below your question.\nWhilst I don't get a delay as long as 10-15 seconds using the commandline, I do find it demonstrably and consistently slower (by a few seconds) than clicking the WiFi icon.  I don't know the underlying operations performed by networksetup, but I'm wondering if it performs a network scan each and every time a request is made to join a new network, which may account for the delay.  Network scanning times can be influenced by many factors, so this delay would likely vary between users in different environments.  This is just hypothesis, though.\n\nI'd love to be able to make an applescript that manually clicks to change Wi-Fi networks\n\nI'll give you two scripts.  \n1. Service-scripting with AppleScriptObjC\nThe first script uses AppleScriptObjC to interface with the system directly and control the WiFi interface.  A quick summary, which I expand on below:\n\n\n*\n\n*+ Robust/reliable\n\n*+ Faster than networksetup\n\n*+ No need to manually enter passwords\n\n*+ No visual disturbances on screen; operates in background\n\n*− Slower than clicking the WiFi icon\n\n*○ SSID case-insensitive, whole phrase matching (can be changed)\n\n\nuse framework \"CoreWLAN\"\n\nproperty this : a reference to current application\nproperty nil : a reference to missing value\nproperty _1 : a reference to reference\n\nproperty CWWiFiClient : a reference to CWWiFiClient of this\nproperty NSPredicate : a reference to NSPredicate of this\n\n\nto joinNetwork given name:ssid as text, password:pw as text : missing value\n    local ssid, pw\n\n    set |?| to NSPredicate's predicateWithFormat:(\"self.ssid ==[c] %@\") ¬\n        argumentArray:{ssid}\n\n    tell CWWiFiClient's sharedWiFiClient()'s interface()\n        its setPower:true |error|:nil\n\n        set networks to {}\n        tell cachedScanResults() to if it ≠ missing value then ¬\n            set networks to filteredSetUsingPredicate_(|?|)\n\n        if the number of networks = 0 then set networks to ¬\n            (its scanForNetworksWithName:ssid |error|:nil)\n\n        set network to (allObjects() in networks)'s firstObject()\n        its associateToNetwork:network |password|:pw |error|:_1\n\n        set [success, E] to the result\n        if E ≠ missing value then return ¬\n            E's localizedDescription() ¬\n            as text\n        success\n    end tell\nend joinNetwork\n\nYou would then call the joinNetwork handler from within your script like so:\njoinNetwork given name:\"my network ssid\", password:\"Passw0rd1\"\n\nThis script will be robust and reliable (barring any human error on my part, which I will correct if you find a bug I've overlooked during testing).  It preferentially uses cached scan results to connect to networks; if none are available, or the specified SSID didn't appear when the scan results were last cached, it will perform a fresh network scan.  Therefore, if my hypothesis about networksetup is a contributing factor, this script will be faster than the commandline on the majority of runs, but may take the same amount of time on the occasional run when forced to do a scan.\nOne benefit is that, because you can specify a network password when calling the joinNetwork handler, you won't need to enter it manually when joining a new network.\nThe SSID—specified by the name parameter—is case-insensitive in both scripts; the password, obviously, is not.  The script above has elected to perform an entire phrase match on the SSID, i.e. \"my net\" will not ever join a network called \"my network\"; the script below has elected to do a fuzzy matching, i.e. \"net\" will potentially join \"my net\" or \"my network\".\n2. UI Scripting\nThis second script is actually the one you requested: it interfaces with the UI to click the WiFi menu icon and then select the network (if it appears in the list).  A summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*+ Despite being a UI script, it ought not to suffer from the same weaknesses inherent to most UI scripts; so hopefully reliable\n\n*+ Fastest implementation—networks joined immediately\n\n*− Visually jarring when menu appears; also, user must not interact with system until the script has exited (the nature of any UI script)\n\n*− Must manually enter passwords if not already saved\n\n*○ SSID case-insensitive, fuzzy matching (can be changed)\n\n\n    use application \"System Events\"\n\n    property process : a reference to application process \"SystemUIServer\"\n    property menu bar : a reference to menu bar 1 of my process\n    property menu bar item : a reference to (menu bar items of my menu bar ¬\n        where the description contains \"Wi-Fi\")\n    property menu : a reference to menu 1 of my menu bar item\n    property menu item : a reference to menu items of my menu\n\n\n    to joinNetwork given name:ssid as text\n        local ssid\n\n        if not (my menu bar item exists) then return false\n        click my menu bar item\n\n        repeat until my menu exists\n            delay 0.5\n        end repeat\n\n        set M to a reference to (my menu item where the name contains ssid)\n\n        repeat 20 times --> 10 seconds @ 0.5s delay\n            if M exists then exit repeat\n            delay 0.5\n        end repeat\n        click M\n    end joinNetwork\n\n\n    joinNetwork given name:\"my network ssid\"\n\nScripts that try to control the UI are using a method called UI or GUI scripting. These are popular amongst and popularised by novice scripters, simply because these are the most commonly-found scripts on the internet.  I won't go into it here too much other than to caution you against using scripts that rely on clicks and keystrokes—they're inherently fragile and unreliable even when well written, but most UI scripts (written by novices) are terribly written, which compounds the problem.  There's almost always a better way to achieve the desired outcome.\nThat said, this is one of the few sorts of UI scripts that are perhaps an exception to my warning, and in my view, a pretty acceptable implementation.  This is because it's targeting an aspect of the UI (a menu bar icon owned by the system) that is virtually guaranteed to always be accessible regardless of what window or desktop has focus, etc.  The one situation where the script of this nature would potentially break is if the menu bar icon wasn't there (i.e. the user has specifically set a preference not to have the WiFi icon available); however, I've put a line in the script that checks for this, and performs a graceful exit in that situation.\nThis script appears to be the speediest implementation, which doesn't surprise me as it will be equal in speed to clicking the icon manually; but, it impresses me in that I can't think of many UI scripts that would end up out-performing an application- or service-targetted script.  The network is joined almost instantly, provided the password is already saved in your keychain.  On occasion, the network you'd expect to see in the menu list might not be there until the background scanning refreshes and the list updates.  Therefore, I built in a 10-second period within which the script checks every half second to see if the menu item has appeared; if it doesn't, the script exits and you'll have to try again.\nThe drawback is the absence of a keychain password for a network will necessitate you needing to manually enter the password when asked for it.  It is possible to script this using UI techniques as well, but this immediately makes the script highly susceptible to the issues I mentioned and then I, personally, wouldn't use it.\n\nSystem info: AppleScript version: 2.7  System version: 10.13.6\n", "Q: make my laptop tell me when battery is low even while \"show battery status in menu bar\" is not checked I unchecked \"Show battery status in menu bar\" in System Preferences > Energy Saver, because I use coconutBattery instead (and obviously I don't want to just re-check that).\nBut this means that now my MacBook doesn't alert me when the battery is getting low and just drains itself to 0% then dies on me.\nI want to make an automatic AppleScript/cron job/whatever to alert me when the battery is less than 50%, and again when it's less than 20%.\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: I had the same issue when I use a Bitbar plugin on OSX and have the default battery menubar unchecked.

If not, what would be the best alternate solution to get it working? Ideally, I'd like to avoid buying a separate £200 dock to be able to use multiple monitors and still power the MacBook as well.\nThe monitors in question are Dell U2515h if that helps - they support daisy chaining through DisplayPort 1.2, although ideally, I'd also like to be able to chain to another monitor too.\n\nA: No, there's no third party driver or other software available to make this work. You say this is the way it was intended to work, but as far as Apple's documentation goes, it is not intended to work this way on macOS. MST is simply not supported, and you'll need to use Thunderbolt 3 for display chaining.\nYou do not need a 200 pound dock in order to use multiple monitors and power the MacBook. Various smaller and larger docks in different price ranges exist for Thunderbolt 3. Usually they have a combination of a Thunderbolt 3 port and a DisplayPort or HDMI port for connecting two monitors simultaneously.\n", "Q: After upgrading to Mojave lpass-cli fails to execute properly?

The issue was reported in various forms on the LastPass Github project page for lastpass-cli. Specifically this issue: Segfaults on macOS Mojave Beta #427.\nThe solution is pretty straightforward. Simply upgrading lastpass-cli via brew like so:\n$ brew upgrade lastpass-cli\n\nResulting in this version being installed which fixes the malloc issue mentioned.\n$ brew info lastpass-cli\nlastpass-cli: stable 1.3.3 (bottled), HEAD\nLastPass command-line interface tool\nhttps://github.com/lastpass/lastpass-cli\n/usr/local/Cellar/lastpass-cli/1.3.3 (10 files, 216.6KB) *\n  Poured from bottle on 2019-04-15 at 15:15:05\nFrom: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/lastpass-cli.rb\n==> Dependencies\nBuild: asciidoc ✘, cmake ✘, docbook-xsl ✔, pkg-config ✔\nRequired: curl ✔, openssl ✔, pinentry ✔\n==> Options\n--HEAD\n    Install HEAD version\n==> Caveats\nBash completion has been installed to:\n  /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d\n\nzsh completions have been installed to:\n  /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions\n==> Analytics\ninstall: 2,555 (30 days), 5,077 (90 days), 18,589 (365 days)\ninstall_on_request: 2,378 (30 days), 4,832 (90 days), 17,108 (365 days)\nbuild_error: 0 (30 days)\n\nVersion details from CLI:\n$ lpass --version\nLastPass CLI v1.3.3.GIT\n\n", "Q: How to find all the available tools in mac terminal? I am trying to setup a bunch of development projects in my Mac. I have to run various tools like python, ruby, scala, groovy etc. \nTo see if a tool is available I use options like \nruby --version. \n\nInstead I would like to see all the list of tools available in Mac terminal via a single command. What is the command/options for it?\n\nA: You could take the PATH variable and translate the colons into spaces then list the files in those directories.\nls  $(tr ':' ' ' <<<\"$PATH\")\n\nAnd as Peter Cordes points out, the above will break if directory paths have spaces in their name. In a subshell, change the IFS (Internal Field Separator) to only a newline and translate the colons to newlines.\n( IFS=$'\\n'; ls  $(tr ':' '\\n' <<<\"$PATH\") )  \n\n\nA: When a command is installed, an entry should have been placed in the whatis database. However, there is no requirement to do so. To get a one line description of a command in the database, enter whatis followed by the command. For example, the output from entering whatis \"ruby\" is shown below.\nerb(1)                   - Ruby Templating\nirb(1)                   - Interactive Ruby Shell\nri(1)                    - Ruby API reference front end\nruby(1)                  - Interpreted object-oriented scripting language\n\nThis the whatis command will accept regular expressions. Therefore, to get a list of all commands in the database, enter the command given below.\nwhatis \".\"\n\nThe man page for whatis states the following:\n\nwhatis  searches  a  set of database files containing short descriptions of system commands for keywords and displays the result on the standard output.  Only complete word matches are displayed.\n\nThere also exists a similar command called apropos. The man page for apropos states the following:\n\napropos searches a set of database files containing short descriptions of system commands for keywords and displays the result on the standard output.\n\nBasically, the difference is apropos does not require complete word matches. For example, whatis \"string\" would not find a match when encountering strings, but apropos \"string\" would.\n\nA: The easiest is simply to open the Terminal and then press the TAB key twice. You'll be asked if you want to see all possibilities - reply \"y\" and you'll get the full list.\n\nA: See the answers from this U&L Q&A titled: \n List all commands that a shell knows\n.\nMy personal favorite is to utilize compgen since this is part of the family of tools used to build all the tab completion when you're in a terminal and hit tab> + tab twice.\n$ compgen -c\n\nExample\n$ compgen -c | tail\ndeepcopy-gen\nkube-controller-manager\ninformer-gen\nlister-gen\netcd\ngen-apidocs\nkube-apiserver\nkubectl\nkubebuilder\nconversion-gen\n\nIncidentally, if you want to know where one of these executables lives on your HDD use type -a <cmd> to find it:\n$ type -a ansible\nansible is aliased to `ANSIBLE_CONFIG=~/.ansible.cfg ansible'\nansible is /usr/local/bin/ansible\n\nThis shows that the command ansible is an alias and also lives locally on the HDD here: /usr/local/bin/ansible.\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*8.7 Programmable Completion Builtins\n\nA: Seconding what @jksoegaard already mentioned, the simplest way is to use Tab autocompletion feature in Bash. Hitting the Tab key twice lists all available shell internal commands, external commands and alias available. If you enter the initial characters of a command, the matching commands are listed when hitting Tab key twice.\nThere are 3rd party package managers available for macOS which lets you install command-line-tools which are either unavailable in the native installation of macOS, or have their older version installed. A couple popular package managers among software developers are Homebrew and MacPorts.\nThus, if you are interested in the broader spectrum of developer tools available to run on your Mac, you can also list all the command-line-tools available for easy installation and running by executing brew search for Homebrew and port search for MacPorts. Executing the said commands require the respective package managers to be installed on your system.\n\nA: For completeness's sake, if you use zsh, you can use ls \"${(@)path}(N)\". To get a list grouped by directory, use ls \"${(@)path}\"/*(-*N) or printf \"%s\\n\" \"${(@)path}\"/*(-*N) (unsorted but in the order they would be found); printf \"%s\\n\" \"${(@)path}\"/*(-*N) | xargs -L 1 basename | sort -u will give you a list of just the commands without paths.\nDo note that this only shows executables, not aliases or functions.

I have a folder full of old aliases whose sizes range from 50 KB to 6 MB, but new aliases seem to be always less than 1 KB.\nI want to recreate all my large, old aliases to save disk space. I know I can update an individual alias by finding the file the alias points to, deleting the alias, and option-command-dragging the original to where the alias was. However, this loses the Date Created of the alias, and more steps are needed to preserve the name of the alias if it is different from the original file. Also, this would take too long to do for my hundreds of aliases. How can I shrink my aliases in bulk while preserving the name and Date Created?\nThere is another, very similar question Recreate an alias with the same name and timestamp programmatically. The difference is that that question requires an answer that doesn’t change the Date Modified of the alias. I am fine with the Date Modified being updated, as long as the Date Created is unchanged.\n\nA: On macOS 10.14 Mojave, inspecting any individual legacy alias with Get Info (⌘I) causes it to be regenerated with a smaller size.\nTo use Get Info to regenerate aliases in bulk, first show a list of the aliases to update in Finder in List View. To find all your aliases, press ⌥⌘Space to open a new search in Finder, click ‘+’ to add an criterion, and set the criterion to “Kind” is “Other”, typing in “Alias”.\nIn this list of aliases in Finder, select the top result, then press ⌥⌘I to Show Inspector. The selected alias will be regenerated – you will see its size go down. Now hold down the ↓ arrow key to select each alias one at a time. Each of them will be regenerated, getting an updated Date Modified but keeping its Date Created.\nYou have to inspect each alias one at a time because inspecting multiple aliases will only update the first one.\n\nA: Here is a rather efficient solution using AppleScript. In Script Editor.app/Preferences, select the option to \"Show  Script Menu In Menu Bar\" & \"Show Computer Scripts\" \n\nThen paste this following AppleScript code into a new script editor document.  Then save that new AppleScript document as a .scpt file to this following location...\n/Users/YOUR SHORT NAME/Library/Scripts/\nBasically this AppleScript code will take the selected alias files in your front Finder window and create new alias files to the location of your choice.  If this save to location is different than the location of your current alias files, you will be given the option to delete your original alias files.

Select it and then open up the info dialog about this particular file (⌘ + I). \nFor example\n                              \nWith the details such as the \"Kind: Plain Text Document\" and what application it's associated with to open it, \"TextEdit\" we can then look through lsregister output and see if we cannot correlate things a bit.\nFor starters lets look for that \"Kind: Plain Text Document\".\n$ lsregister -dump | grep -A5 -iE 'name:.*Plain text document'\n        name:          Plain text document\n        rank:          Default\n        roles:         Viewer\n        flags:         relative-icon-path  doc-type\n        icon:          Contents/Resources/document.icns\n        bindings:      .txt, .text, 'TEXT', text/plain\n--\n        name:          Plain text document\n        rank:          Alternate\n        roles:         Viewer\n        flags:         apple-internal  relative-icon-path  doc-type  resolves-icloud-conflicts\n        icon:          Contents/Resources/txt.icns\n        bindings:      .txt, .text, 'TEXT', text/plain\n\nAbove we can see that the icon for the default is this: Contents/Resources/document.icns.\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*Where does Mac OS X store file association information?\n\n*defaults CLI\n\n*Launch Services Concepts\n\nA: Here's a programmatic way to retrieve this information:\nosascript -e '\n    on run {filepath}\n        local filepath\n\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            set A to the default application of the ¬\n                item named filepath as alias\n\n            set filename to the value of the property list item ¬\n                \"CFBundleIconFile\" of property list file ¬\n                (A & \"Contents:Info.plist\" as text)\n        end tell\n\n        try\n            path to resource filename in bundle A\n        on error\n            try\n                path to resource filename & \".icns\" in bundle A\n            on error\n                return 0\n            end try\n        end try\n\n        POSIX path of result\n    end run' /path/to/file\n\nwhere /path/to/file is the path to any file.

I like to ask Siri to play music, a playlist or a specific song. However, (s)he likes 50% volume and that's too loud for me.

For now, I have to say \"Siri - set the volume to 25%\" when I forget to do that. I do already enable sound check, but that seems to be a 3 to 6% benefit and I’m looking to go from half volume to 1/4 or less.\nIs there a way to make my preference more sticky and the music start more softly?\n\nA: Upon some experimentation, the issue I’m having is that each device that connects to HomePod changes the “last volume” so if I forget to turn down my Mac volume when watching a video or show with low volume (or I’m playing some music at party volume) then the next time I ask Siri for the weather early in the morning, I will continue to be surprised by volume louder than I expected.\nI’ve put in a feature request to reset the volume after 60 minutes to a low or pre-set level, but I’m not holding my breath Apple implements that or uses the microphones to realize the room has been silent as a mouse for an hour and adjust back the “system volume” to be an indoor voice in the morning after a night partying.\nWith iOS 15 and the sleep focus / synchronized alarms and sleep mode do not disturb, things seem a little better. Another workaround is to just ask Siri to play ambient sounds and set the volume low ensuring a mellow start to the day.\n", "Q: Solid coloured wallpaper for Home Screen on my iPhone I had a wallpaper on my iPhone (running iOS 12), which I had to change (because details were incorrect). So far so good, but I made the mistake of changing both.\nHow can I get a plain background on the Home Screen without any distracting graphics?\nI seem to be able to select a Black background, but nothing else from the default wallpaper set. I am sure there were more options on older iOS versions.\n\nA: I'm assuming you are selecting from the official backgrounds that are under Settings > Wallpaper > Choose a New Wallpaper menu. There used to be more plain backgrounds available, but Apple keeps removing the older ones after each iOS update. If you want to access older iOS wallpapers, check out this gallery (there are some plain backgrounds under iOS 7):\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS Wallpapers\nIn case you want to set your own wallpaper, simply save the image to your gallery, tap the share icon on the bottom left, and select the Use as Wallpaper option.\n\nA: \nHow can I get a plain background on the home screen without any distracting graphics?\n\nBy default, iOS 12 contain only one solid colored image for wallpaper which is Black.\nIt is not possible via built-in iOS Wallpaper setting to generate random solid color for use as Home Screen and/or Lock Screen background. To get a plain background on your Home screen, you simply need to obtain/generate a solid colored image with the desired background colour.\nThe same is illustrated below step-by-step:\n\n\n*\n\n*Obtain/generate an image with the desired background colour. It's not mandatory, but generally a good idea to match the image resolution with the device screen resolution or get a higher resolution one. One is attached for example below. It's an image with the color code #767676 with 3360 × 2100 resolution.\n\n\n*Now save it in the Photos app on your iPhone. There are multiple ways to do so, you can AirDrop it from your another device, transfer via a messenger app, email it to yourself, or simply host it somewhere, open it in Safari and save it in Photos. You should have the image appear in your Camera Roll.\n\n\n*Select the image or tap to view it. Tap on the Share button at the bottom left of the screen to open the Share sheet and tap Use as Wallpaper option in the bottom row.\n\n\n*You'll be shown a preview of the screen with the image set as wallpaper. Select Still (as there's no point in selecting Perspective as its a solid image) and tap on Set button.\n\n\n*Now you'll be prompted to set the image as wallpaper for either Lock Screen, Home Screen or both. Since you require plain background only on the Home Screen, tap on Set Home Screen.\n\n\n*Voila, your new Home Screen background is set with the solid color of your choosing.

As expected, all apps with login changes asked me to re-login, no issues there.\nExcept with OneNote. I've been using OneNote in this MBP Sierra for a long time without any problem. It prompted me it couldn't sync with the cloud, understandably, and asked for the correct login info, so I did like I did with other apps. But here's what happens:\n\nI enter my e-mail, click Next:\n\nAnd that's all she wrote. I can't put in a password; it gets stuck there forever. I've tried reinstalling; reinstalling with a mac reboot in between; uninstall, update everything and install back... Always cleaning the plist's, cache's, etc. with CleanMyMac. No luck. It's the only office product I use. And it gets stuck whatever I write as the username.\nI can log online fine. But OneNote in local is stuck.\nI've talked to the \"Office support team\" on the chat, and then over the phone, to no avail. The phone assistant who was supposed to be the last resort could only tell me to sign out and in again, having missed that I'm not logged in. Well, they did give me a link to prior versions, same problem. So I'm thinking something's fishy with my mac.\nI've observed weird behavior from the Console. At the beginning you could tell the thing was in a loop:\n\nAfter reinstalling back the newest version again, I see this:\n\nBut then it goes back to the last capture with green arrows.\nReading \"keychain\" there made me think maybe OneNote has always stored the password there (I don't recall, honestly) and it has some meltdown because it's not a valid password anymore. So I opened the Keychain app and found one instance of \"OneNote\" with the password \"M\" (??). Weird. I deleted that entry... and it's still stuck the way you see it from the captures.\nWhat can I do? Are there any caches or files I should do something with? It's still seemingly prompting the keychain...\n\nA: I like to do a quick test by making a new user account on the Mac and log out of the user account with the problem, in to the new account and try launching and re-licensing the apps.\nOutlook seems to pull the most reliable licenses, followed by Word / Excel / PowerPoint, but I don’t know you can’t start with OneNote - just that I typically use another app.\nThat being said - here is one official KB on fixing keychain permissions and three super helpful / open-source scripts to help with removing licensing entries so you can get a fresh launch. FWIW - reinstalling almost never fixes a license or keychain issue, but it does solve other issues from time to time, so good you ruled that out already.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.office.com/en-us/article/office-for-mac-repeatedly-requesting-keychain-access-ced5a09c-3099-47cb-9190-e961bf63e240\n\n*https://github.com/pbowden-msft/NukeOffKeychain\n\n*https://github.com/pbowden-msft/Unlicense\n\n*https://github.com/pbowden-msft/FlightReset\nI like to start with nuking the keychain first, then proper clean unlicensing and if all else fails, resetting the flight (Insider slow / fast / etc...).

I had bought office 365 under a different email and could not get desktop to work with either email. \nSomeone from microsoft fixed it remotely. I'm not totally sure what happened, but as they were trying to reopen onenote, they clicked on the web clipper. \nWhen onenote did then open, it was correct and didn't have the issue. The person thought it was to do with activating the account but I think somehow the web clipper was keeping the old account active in some way. I hope this helps someone. \n", "Q: How do the sleep sensors in latest Mac laptops work? On older Mac laptops, placing a magnet near the steep sensors sleeps the Mac.  However, on newer Macs, putting magnets on the sleep sensors won't sleep Mac, such as closing the lid does.\nHow do sleep sensors work then? I did many tests with different laptops (12\", 13\" 2016/2017) etc.. I know where the sensors are, but they won't sleep the Mac, not even putting a magnet on each sensor.\n\n\nA: Sleep sensors are typically Hall Effect sensors. You can consult this PDF that Apple produces for case manufacturers which illustrates where the sensors are located per device.

I can now see the 500GB drive in Disk Utility, but there is only a single 300GB APFS container, and Boot Camp Assistant is giving me some errors when I try to repartition the drive.\nI’m due to reinstall macOS from scratch anyway for some other reasons, so I’d like to completely destroy the disk (including all of the APFS containers and volumes) and have it reinitialized back as if it was a freshly out—of-the-box machine.\nIf I reboot into Recovery Mode and use Disk Utility, is there a way I can delete and then recreate all of the disk configuration?\n\nA: Doing a clean install over the Internet\nHold down the Option+⌘+R keys at startup to boot to internet recovery. After booting to recovery mode, use the Disk Utility to erase the drive. Choose the APFS format. \nDoing a clean install using a flash drive\nYou can also choose to download Mojave from the App Store. You can then transfer the installer to a flash drive.

This isn't ideal as it ties the volumes to the user account, meaning if I log out the volumes are locked again.\nThis behaviour differs from encrypted APFS volumes, which mount automatically exactly as before. I know Apple is pushing us to move to APFS, but with still no conversion for AppleRAID (I'm not keen to erase and restore a multiple terabyte volume just to switch), and no use for Time Machine which still doesn't support an APFS backup volume.\nIs there a way to restore or securely emulate the previous behaviour such that the volumes are unlocked automatically for all users?\nIn case the specifics of my setup are useful; my startup volume is an APFS encrypted volume that only my admin account is authorised to unlock, but I use other, standard, user accounts (one for work, one for general use etc.) when actually using my system. I then have an AppleRAID volume of several disks using Core Storage encryption, and a CS encrypted Time Machine disk.\n\nA: It appears to be a bug that was introduced in macOS 10.14.4. In this discussion some users report that the problem went away by itself, a recent poster found the problem was solved in the latest 10.14.5 beta, and others have resorted to using the third-party app AutoMounter.\nIn my case, I have a SD drive permanently inserted into the SD card reader. That worked perfectly for years. Since the update it would auto-mount only about 50% of all reboots.\nTherefore, it seems your best bet will be to wait for macOS 10.14.5 and report the issue to Apple. Another thing that you could try is to delete and re-enter the passphrase in your Keychain Access.app. Concerning your comment, the necessary steps would be: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Keychain Access.app\n\n*Find the key by entering the volume's name in the search field\n\n*Select & delete the key\n\n*Open Disk Utility.app\n\n*Mount the volume in question and check the \"Save passphrase\" box\n\n*Go back to Keychain Access.app and locate the volume key again\n\n*Drag & drop they volume key into the \"System\" category in the left sidebar of Keychain Access.app. This step is necessary to enable auto-mounting.\n\n\nP.S.: I experience another issue, which I suspect is related to this one. Possibly a new UUID is assigned to the drive which could be the reason it is not auto-mounted anymore.\n\nA: So Apple do indeed seem to have resolved this issue in macOS 10.14.5, it feels weird to answer this myself but there it is.\nIf you're having trouble with encrypted drives not mounting automatically, and are on macOS 10.14.4, then upgrade.\n", "Q: How to unlock or restore Safari One day my Safari got blocked.

This should fix your issue.\n\nA: Reinstalling the system drops a new functional system and then migrates all user data and settings in place, so you don't lose anything.\nIf no one has a more surgical fix, I would boot to recovery (Internet Recovery is a nice option if you have somewhat new to new hardware) and you don't have a USB installer handy. You can of course download the installer and make a local installer from the App Store, but recovery is the recommended way to fix this and other issues where a system framework or critical app like Safari gets broken.\n-\nBefore you reinstall:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have you verified that making a new user account (System Preferences) and logging in there is still broken?\n\n*Have you also verified this doesn't resolve itself after a restart?\n\n\nIf it's not the system, you will have wasted time reinstalling and have to fix your preferences / settings if that's causing safari to break. It's less likely, but I've seen user corruption cause this on occasion.\nThere's no harm in trying recovery first, just these might save you time if you are not keen to reinstall for any reasons.\n\nA: Clear all website data first. Malicious software can make uses of your browser cache and cookies to escalate access of your OS . And then restore the Mac OS . That reinstalls everything \n\nA: Reinstalling the system, as other answers suggest, is always a painful option.\nI actually found by chance the solution to my problem. And it was:\n\nopening Safari pressing the Shift ⇧ key.\n\nThat opens Safari without restoring Tabs and Windows.

I'd start with the WiFi because I've seen it be the source of problems more times than I'd like to admit. You can use tools such as PingPlotter (free for basic use).\n\nNOTE: I generally just keep this running all day long, the vertical red bars are when I encountered network drops between myself and the WiFi access point.\nThere are other methods I'll use to do something similar to this, For example you can use the terminal application mtr which I highlight here as well - How does MTR (run with TCP protocol) calculate the loss rate?]3.\nIf you find you're having issues and have the ability to use Ethernet instead, you can try switching to a physical Ethernet connection to see if the problem goes away or is mitigated.\nStorage\nIf you've progressed past eliminating the WiFi as the problem, look next to the NAS storage connection that the macOS systems are using to communicate with the NAS.\nHere you'll want to see what protocol is being used to establish the connection. Is it Samba (SMB), is it NFS or is it something else. Each of these can be problematic in their own unique ways. If you find it's one of these, then understand the stack of software that is constructing this connection from your client Macs to the NAS and verify they're using the latest versions and dig into any logs they may provide.\nI can go on but this should get you started in the general direction.\n", "Q: Share a wifi connection via another wifi connection Having just recently discovered how easy it is to share a wifi connection via Ethernet, I wondered whether I could plug in another wifi USB stick and get another \"WLAN\" entry on this screen (my apologies it's in German)\n\nwhich would allow me to select it in the dropdown on the left here:\n\nUnfortunately I was not succesful with the USB wifi stick I had at hand (it is capable of creating a hosted network - at least on Windows and on my Raspberry). \nWhat do I have to do what I want to achieve with OS capabilities preferably?\n\nA: It turned out the wifi dongle was not fully compatible/supported by Mac OS.

You can greatly speed up the process by employing a neat trick built into iOS.\nOnce you are into selection mode, tap down to select an image. Now without lifting your finger, simply drag your finger in the direction of unselected images (i.e. towards the bottom of the grid of images).

I have a little suspicion that the first technician did something to the file structure so others could not repair it in full. Please help. \n\nA: This sounds like an ad. It's not. Just timing - I just did this the other day (but on purpose). I've been erasing old drives for the last week or so. For kicks, I reformatted one (If I recall correctly, default security settings (no zeroing or writing random data), formate as HFS+ journaled/encrypted.\nThen I decided to see what I could still get from the original drive. \nI used Data Rescue 5. You can download a demo (this is what I used, as my old paid version doesn't work on Mojave). I did not delve in to file contents for more than a few sample files, but I did get what looked like the entire directory structure. The demo let's you recover a whopping total of 10 files. I recovered none, but opened a few for viewing. Paid version is $99. A tad painful, but beats the 2kish that the recovery company was probably going to charge. \nIt requires another blank (hfs+) drive to use for working space, and you might want another to recover to.\n", "Q: running XQuartz: display background is black after screen is unlocked or awakened I use XQuartz 99.9% of the time I'm on my Mac.

Apple has announced that all programs in the next release of its operating system must be notarized. \n\nBeginning in macOS 10.14.5, all new or updated kernel extensions and\n  all software from developers new to distributing with Developer ID\n  must be notarized in order to run. In a future version of macOS,\n  notarization will be required by default for all software.\n\nHow will this affect programs written in Python? Will they need to be notarized? Or will notarization be required for using certain APIs? How about browser plug-ins? Will they require notarization? \n\nA: I'm starting to research this to better understand its implications as well, since I installed a number of 3rd party apps on my laptop and never use the store. Everything I install is either DMG or via brew.\nBackground & Python\nFor starters I would suspect any applications that are in binary form would be what Apple's referring to when they executables have to be notarized. A Python script, though executable, is not technically a binary, the shebang, #!/usr/bin/env python at the top is what makes it executable, so I would expect that only the literal /usr/bin/python binary would need to be notarized to appease GateKeeper.\nAPIs\nIf you look through the documentation around Notarization, you're uploading your build artifacts from your project to an Apple server where they'll analyze it and then provide a will return a unique ticket that you'll need to \"staple\" to your application. This ticket will allow GateKeeper to later verify your application for authenticity with Apple.\nSo they won't be doing anything through high level APIs, but rather through forcing applications to use macOS 10.9 libraries or later SDKS, per this bullet:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Link against the macOS 10.9 or later SDK.\n  \n\nSo they will be restricting applications through low level libraries (APIs) that they may be using.\nPlugins\nBy default plugins will inherit whatever notary their native application they're running in will provide:\nNotarizing Your App Before Distribution\n\nPlug-ins don’t declare their own entitlements. Instead, they inherit\n  the entitlements of the host process. Therefore, a host app must\n  include all the entitlements that prospective plug-ins require, even\n  when the plug-ins are notarized separately.\n\nHowever, this paragraph looks to state that basic plugins should be able to just work through their parent, but if they're doing something low level themselves, perhaps in some C plugin to Photoshop, this extra level of capabilities will need to be addressed by the parent app as part of its entitlement on behalf of the plugins that may run underneath the parent app.\nNotarizing Your App Before Distribution\n\nFor example, if a plug-in employs deep integration with the host\n  executable via C function pointer overrides, or uses a JavaScript\n  engine for custom workflows, the host executable must declare the\n  Allow Unsigned Executable Memory Entitlement or Allow Execution of\n  JIT-compiled Code Entitlement, respectively. In some cases, a plug-in\n  fails to even load if the host executable lacks the proper\n  entitlement.\n\nAn author's perspective\nI found this blog post from the author of Acorn, a commercially available image editor.\nMacOS Notarization\n\nAnd automating the notarization steps weren't as bad as I thought they\n  would be. I wrote a Python script which calls out to the notarization\n  tools with the addition of having the response format set to xml (and\n  it was in the plist format, which was then easily fed into\n  Foundation.NSDictionary). The script analyzed the current state of\n  things and either waited a while before querying the notarization\n  servers again to see if it's done, or stapled on the notarization bits\n  if it was. Then a new build of Acorn makes its way to the internet.\nNotarization adds a few minutes to the build time, but maybe it'll be\n  worth it? I don't like having to depend on Apple's servers to put\n  something up on mine. But if notariation prevents those \"Foo.app is an\n  app downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?\"\n  boxes from scaring customers unnecessarily, it will be worth the\n  hassle. I can hope at any rate.\n\nI felt like this author's perspective was reasonable. I've always just dismissed the warning when installing 3rd party software, but can understand some people's reluctance.\nThis article had some additional takes on Notarization that I found germane to you question but didn't want to overload my answer with too much more info. The article is titled: What the Apple Notarization Program for macOS Apps Means for You.\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*Notarizing Your App Before Distribution\n\n*How to notarize your software on macOS\n", "Q: Company software still on computer I bought an iMac from a company that was upgrading their computers. They assured me that it was clean of their applications. Just to be safe I did a wipe of the hard drive and reinstalled macOS High Sierra.\nA problem arose when I was setting up the computer after the install. It asked me if I wanted the company to configure the Mac for me. I kind of ignored it since that was the only time I saw anything related to that in the weeks I've had it, until today when a notification popped up asking if I want to automatically configure my settings.\nI called the company who patched me through to IT who assured me several times that everything was ok. To be honest, it has worked just fine. No issues at all - I'm just a little on edge. When I was setting up the computer it stated that the admin (company) would have access to files and apps, and can even see my Web traffic. Apple stated there's nothing that they can do. I'm stuck.\nHere's what I've done to try to fix the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried a clean install of macOS High Sierra again, with no luck.\n\n*Upgraded to macOS Mojave which didn't resolve the issue.\nThe only thing I can think of is the macOS base system (I'm assuming that has stayed the same.)\nSo what can I do? Everything I try doesn't get rid of the notification to set up my computer for the company. Somewhere there is some pre-installed software that won't go away.\n\nA: There is no company software leftover on your iMac that is prompting you. The most likely explanation is that the iMac that you bought is enrolled into Apple Device Enrollment Program.\nDEP lets organization automatically enroll devices into a MDM (mobile device management) system even without touching the device. The devices are enrolled into DEP at the time of purchasing via Apple or partner. Basically, Apple or resale partner associate the device serial numbers with the organization that made the purchase. This will let otganization IT team supply a configuration profile over the air, without even physically accessing the device.\nThe enrolled device checks with the Apple's servers to see if its enrolled into a DEP. You'll need to contact and ask the organization (basically the IT team thereof) to un-enroll your device from DEP. They should have ideally done this as a part of handing over the device to you (as it is no longer the property of the said organization).\nOnce un-enrolled, you'll no longer see the message and can use your Mac normally just like any other Mac.\n", "Q: How can I charge powerbank that has single C-type in/out from MacBook?

The use case will be Charger → Macbook → Power Bank, which I expected to charge both devices, but if I connect like that, the power bank seems not to be charging.\n\nA: If the macbook usb-C port is not rated to provide what the powerbank demands then it will not negociate and deliver power.\nAs you say the macbook charger will charge the powerbank correctly and the powerbank will charge the macbook, then the issue is the rated output of the macbook USB-C port.\n", "Q: Change / correct desktop to display mapping I have a Mac Book laptop with Mojave.

Dragging a folder in Finder while pressing Command + Option (⌘ +  ⌥) creates an alias. But is there a quick and similar way to create a symlink this way?\n\nA: macOS does not have a native drag and drop method to create a symlink in the same manner as creating an alias in Finder. By default, symlinks are created by using ln from the command line in Terminal.\n\nIn Terminal:\n$ ln\nusage: ln [-Ffhinsv] source_file [target_file]\n       ln [-Ffhinsv] source_file ... target_dir\n       link source_file target_file\n$\n\nFor additional details, use: man ln\n\nFor a homegrown solution using Automator and AppleScript, the following is a bare-bones example of an Automator Service (QuickAction in macOS Mojave) that when assigned a keyboard shortcut, e.g. ⌘S in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services, will create a symlink of the selected items in Finder at the selected destination folder that is brought up by pressing e.g. ⌘S:\nThis Service (QuickAction) will be available on the Services menu in Finder or from right-click Context menu, and or the assigned keyboard shortcut once an item or items are selected in Finder.\nBare-bones example AppleScript code:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    if input is equal to {} then return\n\n    activate\n\n    set posixPath to POSIX path of (choose folder with prompt ¬\n        \"Select destination folder for Symlink...\" default location ¬\n        (path to desktop folder) with invisibles)\n\n    repeat with thisItem in input\n        set thisItem to POSIX path of (thisItem as alias)\n        try\n            do shell script \"ln -s \" & quoted form of thisItem & ¬\n                space & quoted form of posixPath\n        end try\n    end repeat\n\nend run\n\nThe example AppleScript code assumes you have write privileges at the selected destination folder, other then the selected items source folder, and as coded only creates the symlink if it doesn't already exist. Changes can be made to the code to accommodate other options.\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and, other then a single try statement, does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide.

This app crashes every time I try to open it. Also, it's not available on the App Store. I just need to recover the data somehow. I know that the data is stored in the app.\n\n\nA: Local persistence of data in an iOS app can be done in a variety of ways (Core Data, SQLite database, NSUserDefaults, Plist file, Documents directory etc.). Whether it's possible to recover it would entirely depend on how FriendLoan app implements it.\nIf the app stores the data in the form of on-disk file(s), you can attempt to recover it. Connect your iPhone to your computer, launch iTunes, select your iPhone and click on File Sharing under Settings in the left sidebar.\n\nApps which are programmed with support for File Sharing are listed. Click to select the app to see the files available for sharing within the app bundle. You can drag and drop the available files to Finder to save a copy on your computer. This is one potential way to attempt recovery of data. Whether the data is actually what you are looking for totally depends on the how the app developer has written the implementation for handling it.\nAlternatively, you can search the Web to look for desktop apps which lets you access filesystem of connected iOS device. It's another way to attempt recovery of data if the aforementioned approach doesn't yield the desired.\nAs a last resort, it doesn't hurt to contact the developer of the app and see if they can provide any help with resolving.\n", "Q: Using a pre-owned Mac My Dad passed away a few weeks ago and I now have access to his Mac computer.

I have multiple windows open on the screen. The one in the foreground is a Finder window, then some other stuff and then another Finder window in the background. If I close the Finder window in the foreground then the one in the background appears. How can I prevent this behavior?\n\nA: I know of no way to do this if the Finder is the frontmost app at the start of your sequence. It's fairly standard practice that if you close the frontmost window in any app, the next behind it will come to focus.\nHowever, if Finder is not the frontmost app, then  Cmd ⌘ -clicking the red dot will close the window without bringing the Finder to the front.\nThere are a few  Cmd ⌘  + action functions that will operate on a window without bringing it to the front - you can drag window edges to resize, minimise, close, etc.\nYou can kind of 'fake' what you want if you click on the Desktop first, then when you close your first window, the Desktop itself will be 'frontmost'... yet of course will not actually move.\n\nA: If you have multiple windows open temporarily click one of the non-finder windows to bring it to the front.

On a scandinavian keyboard you also have to add the shift modifier, which doesn't help.\nCurrently, I feel like shift+backtick+space is the most predictable way of typing backticks.\nBut! I realized that I never use that key for anything other than backticks, and figured that it would be neat to modify the key to simply always output a single backtick.

After quitting (nearly) every application:\ncraig@pluto ~> ping 192.168.1.242 -i 2\n...\n22 packets transmitted, 22 received, 0% packet loss, time 78ms\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.037/*22.550*/*89.237*/28.546 ms\n\nBut outgoing pings are fine:\ncraig@Craigs-MBP ~> ping 192.168.1.3 -i 2\n...\n266 packets transmitted, 266 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.909/1.526/8.716/0.686 ms\n\nNow here's something curious. If I rapidly send pings out, the inbound variance disappears!\ncraig@Craigs-MBP ~> ping 192.168.1.3 -i 0.2\n...\n417 packets transmitted, 417 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.984/1.469/3.799/0.290 ms\n\n(while the above is running)\ncraig@pluto ~> ping 192.168.1.242 -i 2\n...\n38 packets transmitted, 38 received, 0% packet loss, time 147ms\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.001/*1.664*/3.758/0.767 ms\n\nGiven this, my best guess is there is some kind of power saving mechanism turning off the radio.\ncraig@Craigs-MBP ~> pmset -g\nSystem-wide power settings:\nCurrently in use:\n standbydelaylow      10800\n standby              1\n womp                 0\n halfdim              1\n hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\n powernap             1\n gpuswitch            2\n networkoversleep     0\n disksleep            10\n standbydelayhigh     86400\n sleep                0\n autopoweroffdelay    28800\n hibernatemode        3\n autopoweroff         1\n ttyskeepawake        1\n displaysleep         10\n highstandbythreshold 50\n acwake               0\n lidwake              1\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 3: Here are two simultaneous packet captures with the \"same\" ICMP packet highlighted. The left was captured using tcpdump on the Ubiquiti UniFi access point that my MBP is connected to, and the right was captured on the MBP. You can see the sequence number is the same. But the calculated response time from the access point's point-of-view is relatively high at 71 ms, while the MBP saw < 1 ms between the request and the response.\n\n\nA: Yes, there is indeed such a power saving measure implemented on the Mac. This is common across WiFi chipsets on all platforms and operating systems, and is actually part of the WiFi standard itself. \nThe PSM (power saving mode) of the WiFi chipset takes many forms. This you're probably experiencing is known as the \"connected-idle\" mode. In this mode it introduces a small latency of less than 100 ms (typically 50-100 ms) for the first packet received after the module was put in the connected-idle mode. \nOther power saving modes exist that save more power, but for example the connected-sleep mode introduces an extra latency of typically 300 ms, which is more than you measure here.\nUnfortunately there seem to be no official interface from Apple to change power saving modes manually, or to disable certain power saving modes. The only work around is simply to actually use the radio for something which will prevent it from going into the connected-sleep mode at all. That could be done with for example a ping running in the background permanently. Obviously this will consume more power, which could be a nuisance when running on battery.\nHowever despite the above, you should be aware that this power saving mode isn't really something that the end-user is supposed to or normally notices at all. Remember that the latency only affects the very first packet received after the module is put into connected-sleep mode, and that it is only put in connected-sleep mode after a period of nonuse.\nWhen using Steam In-Home Streaming you would have a constant stream of packets to/from your Mac. This means that the WiFi module isn't going to go into the connected-sleep mode while streaming.\n\nA: I don't think your conclusion is correct. I'd continue to diagnose the problem without making any assumptions as to what the potential reason is for your intermittent WiFi connectivity issue. It could be a whole host of reasons so the trick with this type of troubleshooting exercise is to eliminate potential sources of problems until you can build up a case as to what's causing your issue.\nFor starters ping isn't really a good tool for diagnosing problems like this. It can be useful for gross connectivity issues, but in this case I'd use something like PingPlotter (free for basic use) or the CLI tool mtr (available via brew.\n\nThe above shows red bars where my Macbook Pro was having intermittent issues connecting to the WiFi access point. These issues were isolated enough that we could identify that they were actually being caused by the access point and not the WiFi network in the Macbook Pro.\nOnce you've started to monitor things see if your issue shows any patterns. \nSpeed tests\nYou can also typically uncover intermittent issues by using something like speedtest-cli.\n$ speedtest\nRetrieving speedtest.net configuration...\nTesting from Spectrum (65.190.136.112)...\nRetrieving speedtest.net server list...\nSelecting best server based on ping...\nHosted by Spectrum (Durham, NC) [30.67 km]: 16.144 ms\nTesting download speed................................................................................\nDownload: 402.10 Mbit/s\nTesting upload speed................................................................................................\nUpload: 21.87 Mbit/s\n\nThere's another application which is a GUI with the same name, Speedtest, from the Appstore which could be helpful if you'd rather have a GUI form of something like speedtest-cli.\nAnother GUI tool for analyzing your WiFi network that I've found useful is NetSpot. There's commercial as well as free options available to use it.\nDiscover view\n\nBuilt in WiFi tools\nmacOS also includes a basic scanning app. It's completely not obvious how to get to it IMO. To access it you'll want to hold down the Option key,  ⌥ and then click on the networking icon in the top menubar.\nWiFi menu\n                                           \nOnce the diagnostic window is open you can launch additional tools from it. This is the part that most people seem to be unaware of with this app.\nWith the diagnostic window open and focused, look in the menubar and open up the \"Windows\" pulldown, within it are several tools to analyze your network.\nWireless Diagnostic dialog\n\nWireless Diagnostic top menubar\n\nFrom this menu you can launch a variety of tools such as \"Logs\" to collect detailed logs or \"Performance to analyze your WiFi connection.\nPerformance dialog\n\nDeeper dive with Wireshark\nIf you're still not finding the cause of your WiFi troubles, you may want enlist the help of Wireshark. Installing it is pretty straightforward, you can use brew to install the DMG through casks (CLI + GUI) or you can install the CLI only version through the vanilla brew formula.\nDMG install via cask\n$ brew cask install wireshark\n\nCLI only\n$ brew install wireshark \n\nWhen you launch the GUI, you'll need to tell it which network interface to capture data from. Here I'm telling it to capture data from my WiFi interface, en0.\n\nIf you double click the interface's name Wireshark will immediately start a packet capture session. After you've let that run for a bit, hopefully during one of failure scenarios that you're trying to troubleshoot you can click the red square to stop the capture (red #1 in diagram below).\nYou can then analyze the packets caught in the red #2 area of the UI and you should be able to identify types of packets (red #3, for eg. is a ping packet).\n\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*How To Access The WiFi Scanner In macOS Sierra\n", "Q: Is it OK to install one Office 2019 license on both Mac and Windows?

I'm using macOS Mojave and I have 2 monitors. I want the dock to stay on my right screen.\nMy problem is when I move the mouse to the the bottom center on my left screen the dock permanently changes it's location to the left screen until I do the same again on my right screen.\nThe following solutions do not work for me for reasons below:\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't want the dock to move to right. I want it at the bottom.\n\n*I don't want to disable separate spaces because I want to use this feature.\n\n\nIs there any way to do this besides these 2 options?\n\nA: I use 2 external  monitors on my MacBook Pro. The dock jumping around drove me crazy.It is by far my biggest MacOS gripe.  I tried the auto-hiding dock but didn’t like it either.\nSo today I installed a 3rd party app ubar 4. It seems to work well and so far I’m very pleased. The status bar stays where it supposed to. It is very customizable and I am tuning it to my taste. It does cost $30, but it fixes a problem that Apple should have addressed.\nThe paradigm is similar in some respects to the menu system the Mac had pre-OS X. TBH I was never a fan of the Dock. I felt it was a step backward,but I got used to it. \nBut to-date Ubar  is the best solution I’ve found.\n\nA: I will explain to you how it's implemented, but I don't believe it's what you want.\nI have 4 monitors. When I set the dock to \"bottom\", with auto-hide off, moving to the center of any of the monitors cause the dock to jump to the bottom of that monitor and stay there until I do the same on another monitor.\nIf I set the dock to the left or right, it will remain permanently on either the left-most or right-most monitor.\nI do not believe it is possible to have the dock on the bottom of ONLY one of the monitors. It just doesn't work that way.\nUnfortunately, sometimes the answer is \"You can't do that.\" \nThere may be a third-party app somewhere that would allow you to pin the dock to the bottom of only one display, but I'm unaware of any.\nMy suggestion is that you file a RADAR with Apple and request it as a future feature.\nI can envision writing an app that would do what you're asking, but given that a quick check of all the multi-monitor software developers and video editors I know shows all of them with either a left-side or right-side dock, the audience would be insignificant...if I thought I could get 200 people to pay $1, I'd set up a Patreon and do it, but I think you're a lonely unicorn...\nSee Why does my dock keep moving back to my other monitor?\n\nA: This may or may not make a difference, but is worth a try.\nUnder System Preferences > Displays > Arrangement drag the menu bar (thin white rectangle) to your rightmost display.\nI'm only mentioning this because in my case the dock was stuck on one monitor (the opposite of your problem), and moving the menu bar from my MacBook Pro's display to my external monitor resolved this (dock tracks to monitor now).  I just tested moving the menu bar back to the MacBook and it anchors the dock to that monitor again (cannot be displayed on the other monitor).\nI am using Catalina and like you use separate spaces.\n\nA: Having this problem myself on a new Mac and a bit mystified because on my old Mac I had docks on all monitors I poked around a little.\nI think the only way to have the dock on all monitors is to check \"Automatically hide and show the dock\" in System Preferences > Dock. It doesn't show the dock on all monitors but it's available on all monitors and is a lot less mouse travel.\n", "Q: iMac tripping breaker just by plugging it to electricity, without even pushing the power button! iMac 21” (EMC: 2638)\nThe iMac was connected to a UPS but through an extension cable, so not directly.\nSo the iMac was running as usual when suddenly it went off, with all the other devices that are connected to the UPS.

Sometimes a row of desktops appears at top of the screen while dragging window to the top. It happened without activating Mission Control.\nUnfortunately I am not able to reproduce this behaviour. How do I do it again? I wish to use this to move an app window to another Desktop.\n\nA: To move an app window to a new Desktop without manually invoking Mission Control, simply drag the app window all the way up to the edge of the screen and hold. You'll be shown the row of desktops at the top.\nSimply dragging the app window to top may not work. To make sure you enter this mode every time, drag the app window in one fast and smooth motion, and to the top most edge of the screen.\nCarefully watch how it's done in the linked GIF. I have purposely dragged the window down, then dragged it smoothly in one go towards the top.\n\nYou can either move the app window to one of the already available desktops or drop it onto the + symbol towards extreme right corner to create a new desktop.\nA blank desktop with the name of the app underneath is also show at the end of the list of desktops. Dropping the app window onto it will take the app window full-screen.\nIf you have a multi monitor setup, the app window can also be dropped onto the other monitor(s).\n\nAn alternate method to move an app window to different desktop is to move it in a similar manner to the right or left edge of the screen. However, this will work only if there's already an existing desktop to the right of left. Unlike the above, this approach has the limitation that it won't give you the option to create a new Desktop, and the app can't be directly taken to full-screen mode.\n\nA: The alternate method above (right or left edge) appears to be disabled with multiple monitors if \"Displays have separate Spaces\" is enabled.\nA third alternate method is to click on the window title bar (as if you are going to drag it-don't release!), and then take any action that would switch desktops.  Depending on your setup, this may be awkward or not possible; you can't click-and-hold on a trackpad while using a swipe on the same trackpad.\nMy experience with dragging to the top is that it works for me about 30% of the time.  More specifically, it works about 5% of the time when I want to move a window, and about 50% of the time when I actually just wanted to drag the window to the top of the screen.  I'm sure I'm not \"fast and smooth\" enough.  Is there a way to tweak the motion that triggers Mission Control?  Or at least to turn off this method of activating Mission Control (although that defeats OP's goal).\n", "Q: iMac 27-inch, Late 2014, RAM upgrade size combinations There are 4 slots. 2 slots taken by 2x4GB that came with Mac at purchase. Max memory is specified as 32GB. Can I buy 1x8GB and 1x16GB to fill the remaining 2 slots. Or do I need to use 8GB for both remaining slots. Thank you!\n\nA: The general rule is you can mismatch sizes in pairs but not in individual slots.\nComputers use interleaved memory, which requires each pair of slots to be populated with the exact same RAM. Having mis-matched slots will 'break' the interleaving & slow down the RAM access. As far as I'm aware this isn't 'dangerous' at all, merely slower.  \nSome machines can also use triple-channel memory, where three matching memory sticks can be interleaved. I don't know whether your iMac can do that, it may only be the Mac Pros that can - though in this case would make your issue harder to solve [I'm just including it for completeness]\nSo, your ideal way to achieve 32GB would be 4 x 8GB, which is probably cheaper than 2 x 16 anyway. If you keep the existing 4's I would add a pair of 8's.\nCrucial's RAM configurator, on a quick search [check for your exact model] shows no 16GB sticks at all.\n", "Q: Macbook pro mid 2014 15\" turns screen off when unplugged and starts fans at max power I'm having a problem with my macbook where, for some reason, when it's unplugged to the power the computer randomly turns the screen semi-black (not totally black) and starts the fan at max power. \nThe computer itself is still on (the apple is bright) and I have to turn it off by long pressing the power button.\nI'm not able to understand what is going on:\nThe logs from system.log\nApr 19 09:15:03 marco com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.sandboxd[153]): Service exited due to SIGALRM | sent by kernel_task[0]\nApr 19 09:15:03 marco syslogd[96]: ASL Sender Statistics\nApr 19 09:15:05 marco com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.bsd.dirhelper[9925]): Endpoint has been activated through legacy launch(3) APIs.

Obviously, we can continue to use the phone but now cannot update any apps like WhatsApp so cannot now use the app. \nThe data is still relevant to us and we are the owners of the data.\nCan we change the appleid, or do something else to allow us to update apps without losing all the data?\nI hope someone can suggest something. Many thanks\n\nA: Not only does the data, but all the apps & the device itself still belong to the original Apple ID.\nApple's policy isn't that anything belongs to the human holding the device, it belongs to the owner of the ID.\nWithout that ID/password & no way to obtain it or contact the previous owner, yet with access to the phone itself & presumably its passcode, the only option will be to transfer what data you can off it, then throw the phone away.  \nThere are methods to gain full access to the device itself if you can prove ownership - see How can I bypass Activation Lock? - but none of these will gain you access to the existing data, merely allow you to re-purpose the phone under new credentials.\nEaseUS web site has How to Transfer Contacts from iPhone to Android in 4 Easy Ways. They are, of course, trying to persuade you in the end to consider their own software, though they show a method to transfer contact data to Google, which will then give you access to the contacts as .vcf files.\nI'm not certain that you can really get right through any of those methods without at some point needing the Apple ID & password.\nIf you hit that at any point, then your method will be reduced to typing it out by hand into another computer.\nFor WhatsApp, I don't know of any method that doesn't involve paid [& often quite dodgily-marketed] software, which I've never tried [& am never likely to.] You'd have to do some further research... & caveat emptor, read reviews on sites not connected to any of the software makers.\n\nA: It sounds like you do have the passcode, so you can probably use iMazing to transfer all the contacts, WhatsApp messages, etc., and most other data to a computer. The software is expensive but worth it.\nDepending on the iCloud configuration, you could then set reset the iPhone (again, assuming you have the passcode, and there's not an activation lock), then re-import (some) of the data you extracted from iMazing into a new iCloud account.\n", "Q: Unified Logs | macOS High Sierra I have macOS unified logs from System A in .logarchive format.

Alfred is great, of course, and I use it all the time. However, if I haven't opened it for a little while it can take a few seconds to open the search-bar UI. Otherwise, it will open in less than a quarter of a second.\nI believe this is to do with the fact that it is moved out of memory by the operating system, meaning it has to be copied back in next time I request it (note: I have a mechanical hard-drive, not an SSD, so that takes ages).\nSo my question is this: can I force macOS to leave an application in main memory even if I'm not using it?\n\nA: MacOS's memory management is quite sophisticated, and it generally does try to keep as much stuff in memory as possible. If Alfred is still running, then it will be in memory. \nIf you have quit Alfred, then it might still be retained in memory, which is why it is faster to load next time. However, the OS will clear the quit app from memory, if the memory is needed for something else. So you might experience slowness somewhere else if you don't let the OS clear the quit app.\nRecommendations for improving speed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Leave Alfred running all the time. If it's slow to come to foreground sometimes, even when its been running in the background, then that's not a memory issue, but something else: possibly related the slowness of the HDD.\n\n*Get more RAM, if possible. You don't say what model of Mac and how much RAM.\n\n*Replace the HDD with an SSD.\n\n\nA: If your goal is to simply keep an application running all the time even when you close it you could use the method described here in this articled titled: Always keep an application open .\nIn that article they describe using this method for the Stickies application.\nSteps\nExcerpted here in case it ever gets deleted\n\nFor example, to keep Stickies permanently open, remove Stickies from\n  the login items for your account (if you've placed it there), quit\n  Stickies, and then create the following plist file in the LaunchAgents\n  folder of your home Library (~/Library/LaunchAgents) with the name\n  user.launchkeep.stickies.plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>user.launchkeep.stickies</string>\n  <key>KeepAlive</key>\n  <true/>\n  <key>Program</key>\n  <string>/Applications/Stickies.app/Contents/MacOS/Stickies</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nNow load this launchd job by logging out of your account and logging\n  back in or launch Terminal and enter:\n$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/user.launchkeep.stickies.plist\n\nStickies will now effectively be un-removable -- any time it quits,\n  crashes, or gets forced-quit it will pop right back up.

But the Home button on the iPhone isn't working.\nHow can I get past this without replacing the Home button right now, and set it up with the Assistive Touch, until I get it fixed.\n\nA: There is no way to access Assistive Touch until the device is done past the initial setup. The only way to get through the first step is to have a working Home button.\nYou'll have to get the Home button fixed before you can setup your iPhone.\n\nA: Believe it or not, this is easy.\nYou must have access to a mac and the right cable for your phone\nWith the phone at the setup welcome screen, you plug the phone in and iTunes should pop up. Open the Summary page for the device, and scroll to the Options section at the bottom.

I'm building a book app where you can read one book for free, but if you pay, you have access to all the books until the end of your subscription (30 days).\nMy query is regarding this item in the App Store review guidelines:\n\n3.1.1 In-App Purchase:\nIf you want to unlock features or functionality within your app, (by way of example: subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels,\n  access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use\n  in-app purchase. Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock\n  content or functionality, such as license keys, augmented reality\n  markers, QR codes, etc. Apps and their metadata may not include\n  buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct\n  customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.\n\nI understand I can't use an external link to pay, but:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do I need In-App purchases?\n\n*Can I use external payments like Stripe?\n\nA: No. You don’t need in app purchases if you can just have a log in to identify people that already have a subscription external to the app.\nSee 3.1.3(a) “Reader” Apps of the review guidelines.\nYes - if you are a valid reader app and not required to offer IAP alongside the external purchase, you can then use stripe or anything else on your external payment system, but you have to host, design, collect everything externally.\n\nYou are not prohibited from having an external payment or subscription like Netflix or many other apps do. Some are blended like Major League Baseball where there is IAP for people who want to pay (and of course IAP pays Apple a cut per the agreement on purchases and subscriptions that you have available in your terms as a developer). And people can bring a paid subscription and log in from external to the app, and those pay nothing to Apple.\nEverything hinged on strict adherence to what Apple defines “unlock within the app” which is in summary (as I understand it):\n\n\n*\n\n*There can be no link or mention in the app how to find the actual payment terms. You can offer a sign in, but you can’t say it’s for payment.\n\n*You can’t have functionality that unlocks to mimic IAP or use the API or payments through Apple.\n\n\nTons of apps have trial subscriptions when they use IAP - look at Omni Group for OmniGraffle and such.... I believe you will run afoul of Apple review if you deliver everything and then force someone to pay later if that “pay later” isn’t explicitly IAP using Apple as the payment processor, but you can find that out by initially shipping no paid functionality and only do the log in.\nFor this potential wrinkle, see 3.1.3(a) and 3.1.3(b) and 3.1.5(a) of https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\nThen once your app is approved, let Apple review know you have a question for a future change. They will tell you exactly what’s allowed and what’s not during review in my experience. \n\nA: Yes, as per App Store terms & conditions, for in-app consumables, you are limited to using the payment method linked to users Apple ID which can be used via In-App Purchase.\n", "Q: F4 will not show Dashboard I just got a brand new Apple space grey wireless keyboard.

It doesn’t let you delete all alarms at once in\n  iOS, which would be a very convenient option for those who end up\n  having a dozen or more alarms that are not relevant anymore.\nNormally, you’d need to enter ‘Edit’ mode and hit the delete button\n  for each alarm you want to remove. In many cases, avoiding all this\n  manual work is what causes all those alarms to pile up in the first\n  place.\nWhile the stock Clock app doesn’t have a ‘Delete all’ option, Siri\n  provides a solution. Since Apple’s virtual assistant integrates with\n  the Clock app, among the many other things it can do, is you can use\n  it to delete all alarms at once in iOS.\n\nNOTE: if you have many alarms (>100, approximately), Siri might say \"Sorry, there is something wrong. Please try again\", as shown in the screenshot below. The issue is due to the fact that the Clock application takes some time to remove all alarms, which exceeds Siri's timeout.

I'm running a 13\" Macbook pro 2017 with operating system Mojave 10.14.4.\nI have an HDMI connected tablet (Huion Gt-220). When I connect my drawing tablet to my computer, it locks out my sound for the computer.\nI've tried going into System Preferences and changing the output to internal speakers. I've gone into the Audio MIDI setup and tried to configure it from there as well. \nIn the audio MIDI setup I've also tried making a multi output and an aggregated device.\nI've tried it with and without headphones. I can't get it to work for the life of me. Does anyone else have any ideas on how to fix this? I'm dying here because I'll need to watch/listen to classes at the same time as I work and I can't seem to set it up.\n\nA: 1. Facebook Huion Thread\nI found a thread with your issue on the Huion facebook page. They suggested there trying to re-install the drivers for this particular device there. The thread.\nThis was the verbatim from the support person in the thread:\n\nHuion Cerine Oshiro\nPlease try to reinstall the driver from our website to see if it\n  helps: https://www.huiontablet.com/support/ Here's a step by step to\n  reinstall, please try and see if it works:\n(If you are using Mac system, please skip 3-4 steps）\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Log out the Huion driver, close all drawing programs you are running, close your anti virus software.\n  \n*Uninstall the Huion driver from control panel.\n  \n*Find the TabletDriver folder from C:\\Program files\\ and delete it. (If you are not able to find this folder, that means you have\n  deleted it already, and you may skip this step.)\n  \n*Go to C:\\windows\\system32 or C:\\windows\\system64, find wintab32.dll and delete it.\n  \n*Unplug the USB cable.\n  \n*Download driver from Huion website and install it as an Administrator.\n  \n*Reboot the computer and wait until it finishes rebooting.\n  \n*Plug the tablet back in. If the problem still persists, please send your problem to:service@huiontablet.com to get instant technical\n  support, thank you!\n  \n\n2. DeviantArt Thread\nI also found another thread mentioning a prior version of a Huion device, Huion GT-185 HD. This is a tablet monitor which I assume is the same type of item as your Huion Gt-220.  The thread was on DeviantArt page for the GT-185 HD device.\nIn the thread a Huion support staff made the point that these tablet monitors do not include audio.\n\nhuion Oct 20, 2017 \n  Hello,\nKindly note that there is no audio device in the monitor, so it can\n  not give off any audio.\n\nThey then went on to suggest that the ordering of the displays mattered because of this fact.\n\nhuion Oct 23, 2017  Hello,\nYes, it supports extended mode. Kindly inform you that if you want to\n  use the monitor in extend mode and then use the pen on the HUION\n  monitor, you need to go to control panel to identify Huion monitor is\n  recognized by which monitor in your system. For instance, if GT-185HD\n  is monitor 2 in your system, please select Monitor 2 in the driver. If\n  you have selected Monitor 2, but you still couldn't use the pen on it,\n  please try to select \"all desktop area\".\n\n", "Q: Recover Deleted Data from Malfunctioning Hard Drive I deleted some data accidentally on my Macbook a while ago, and then a couple weeks later the hard drive failed. Now my Macbook can't start normally. I took it to an Apple store and they told me they could replace the hard drive but I need to go somewhere else to extract the data. Is it possible for me to recover the data I deleted? Thank you in advance!\n\nA: Sorry to say this but not very likely. \nEspecially if the HDD was used after the deletion for any period of time. The problem is that once files and directories are deleted there locations are removed from a table that maintains where they're located on the HDD. When these items are deleted, it's often the case that the data will remain on the HDD but just the location information is deleted, but the space they were using is released back into the available pool for reuse.\nAs new files are written to the HDD, this space, or portions of it, will get reused by the system with newly written files and directories. \nSo even if someone were able to recover these files & directories, they'd be only able to recover portions of them if anything.\n", "Q: How can I repair a keychain in Mojave? Whenever I encounter a password field in Safari which it wants to auto-fill using my keychain, it freezes up for a few minutes and shows nothing but the beach ball. I presume it has to do with a corrupted keychain.\nIn previous versions of macOS, there was the option to repair a keychain. In Mojave, there is no such thing. When I \"reset my default keychains\", it fixes the problem and everything works as usual. However I lose all my passwords and notes.\nWhat I've tried that didn't work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run first aid from the Disk Manager\n\n*Restored my keychain (contents of ~/Library/Keychains) from a Time Machine backup\n\n*Moved everything but login.keychain to the trash\n\n\nI know that you could theoretically create a new keychain and copy items from the original keychain, but it keeps prompting for a password for each item which would not be feasible with the amount of items I have stored.\n\nA: The repair tool was removed over security concerns where it could be use to export your keychain without your permissions. what we're left with are guidances you'll find throughout various blog articles explaining some specific problems with workarounds to \"fix\" specific issues related to the keychain.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to Resolve Mac OS X Keychain Problems\n\n*5 Common Keychain Problems on Mac and How to Fix Them\n\n*Keychain Access Mojave\nMost of these solutions involve deleting specific offending keys or toggling \"Show Summary\" or other aspects of a problematic key.\n\nA: A corrupt Keychain can prevent multiple services from loggin in, including iCloud.  Here is a way to figure out if your Keychain is the cause of not being able to login to iCloud.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your Console app (under Utilities)\n\n*In the Search field, type \"Login\"\n\n*Press the Clear button.\n\n*Try to login to your iCloud.\n\n*Note the error messages.  They may look something like this\"\n\n\nError Domain=com.apple.accounts Code=13 UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=, NSUnderlyingError=0x7f*******c10 {Error Domain=com.apple.accounts.keychain Code=-25295}}}}\nBreak down the error codes:\nError Domain=com.apple.accounts Code=13\nThis code can be linked to Keychain errors with a simple Google search\nError Domain=com.apple.accounts.keychain Code=-25295\nThis error code (and many others) can be nterpreted at this link:\n           https://krypted.com/lists/comprehensive-list-of-mac-os-x-error-codes/\n\nIn this case, 25295 is interpreted by pressing Command F and searcing \"25295\".  The search locates the following code:\nKeychain Manager error codes\nerrKCInvalidKeychain = -25295\nAll indications are that the Keychain is corrupt, blocking services from logging in.  In fact, by searching your own Apple ID in the keychain to locate login keys, you might try deleting Public keys.  In doing so, MacOS will fail to delete any key that is corrupt.\nSOLUTION:\nThe solution is at this link:\nHow to back up your iCloud Keychain\nhttps://eclecticlight.co/2019/09/05/how-to-back-up-your-icloud-keychain/\nIf you backup your MacOS device, your Keychain is also backed up.  The article describes how to ensure your iCloud keychain items are also included in any local backup, and in doing so, it also describes how to restore your Keychain.  Your Keychain is located in a file within your Library at ~/Library/Keychains.  In finder, you need to select GO at the top menu (there's a way to unhide the \"Go\" tab... I don't remember offhand, but it is easy to find). Library is under the GO tab.  This being said, this folder is also backed up to Time Machine or any duplicate of your MacOS device.  Follow the instructions in the link to restore the ~/Library/Keychains folder to your MacOS device.  I restarted my MacBook Pro, at this point, and for the first time in a couple of weeks, was able to login to all services.  Problem solved!\n", "Q: Apple Mail rule that combines \"all\" and \"any\" I would like to create a rule for Apple Mail that combines \"all\" and \"any\".\nSpecifically, I need to do a rule where I have a group of \"any\" criteria, \"Message content contains X\" OR \"Message content contains Y\" (and potentially some more ...) but I would like this to only apply to one of my email accounts, so the condition \"Account is iCloud\" must always be met.  Somehow along those lines \nIn the Rules\nI could, of course, create multiple \"all\"-rules and have them perform the following action, but that is cumbersome.  Any suggestions?  \nEDIT:\nThe action I would want to attach is to move the matching messages to a designated \"On my Mac\" mailbox/folder and at the same time moving them to the IMAP trash so they'll get deleted from the server. \n\nA: There are three ways to do this, but all are cumbersome. There's no simple way.\n\n*\n\n*Like you mentioned make one rule per OR condition, such that each rule looks like\nbelongs to <account> AND message content contains <blah>\n\n\n\n*Make a \"guard\" rule to match all your other accounts, like so:\nbelongs to <other account> OR belongs to <other account> OR ...\n\nwith an action of \"Stop evaluating rules\". Position this rule to be the last of all your rules. Then below it, you can add one final rule with your other conditions:\nmessage contains <blah> OR message contains <blah> OR ...\n\nwith the action you want to take. The second-to-last rule will stop all your other accounts from reaching this final rule, so by deduction only your desired account will apply the action.\n\n*(Advanced) Write an AppleScript to check the conditions you need, and sort the mail into the right mailbox. In Mail, you can set a rule to run on \"Every Message\" with an action of \"Run AppleScript\". You'll have to look elsewhere for the details of writing the AppleScript.\n\n", "Q: Connecting Mac Book Pro 2017 to 2 Projectors via USB C Just wondering can I connect my 13\" MacBook Pro to 2 HDMI projectors?

tried reading other posts that came up googling using the error messages and it seems to point to corruption of the partition table ? Hope someone could advice & guide me through this process. It's super frustrating as I can't seemed to be able to fid anything that's similar to this. \nRegards, \nchris \n\nA: Before doing any more scans and operations on the device, it is worth connecting the drive to a different device. Mac/Windows just see if it works. It could be that the physical drive may be damaged or shocks could've damaged or corrupted the controller/data.\nThe fact that it is only recently that it has suddenly changed state would indicate that there may be a problem with the hardware. It is possible, so get it checked just to be sure.\nIs the cable you are using USB Micro-B? Check to make sure it isn't bent or damaged. It is unlikely that it would cause this type of fault, but just check to make sure.\nI would suggest doing these checks before changing the partition scheme, as that can cause loss of data by erasing and corruption.\n\nA: Besides trying with another computer and OS, as mentioned before, a disk repair program might be able to help here. If your files are important, you should first make a copy of the disk by copying a block-by-block image of it to another disk. Then you can experiment with different repair options or, if all fails, try to extract the most important documents manually (Only useful to extract some of the text and copy it into new documents).\nOn a side not, FAT, ExFAT and such have no journaling, and accordingly not a lot of options to repair them if something goes wrong - like a power outage during a write operation. They also don't preserve all the headers - like camera information for your pictures. It's generally better to use a more modern format like APFS or NTFS. You should use such older formats only for temporary uses like data transfer, never for backups of important data.\n\nA: This is just to notify everyone that after many days of waiting, I have decided enough of waiting, time for next plan. I had hope that someone would be kind enough to guide me through the steps required to fix the corrupted MBR (that that's the case) and maybe I won't have to go through the tedious steps of doing a full disk scan using tools like TestDisk or PhotoRec. It seems like that is not to be. \nI have now completed a full disk scan using PhotoRec tool, ran some scripts i found on the internet to sort the files according to filename extension. For the photo files, I am in the process of renaming the files according to date created. \nThank you to those who have answered. I am aware & fully understand that any assistance provided is purely on voluntary basis. So while I am disappointed with how this turns out, I fully understand. Consider this closure of this thread. \nHave a good day. \n", "Q: Slightly broken SD card is not readable on macbook I put the SD card (sandisk ultra 32gb) in the card slot in macbook pro. But it is not getting detected. When I tried to find on Disk utility it doesnt show up. I have very important data in the SD card which I am not able to procure. Please help. Thank you\n\nA: There's really no such thing as 'slightly broken' when it comes to electronics. \nIf it's just the contacts, it may be possible to replace them. If you cracked the circuit board, then at best you will have to send it to a professional data recovery company, who will be expensive & make no guarantees of recovery.\nAt worst, you now know why it is extremely unwise to ever trust something as delicate as an SD card or USB stick to be a repository for the only copy of any data. No important data should ever be kept in only one place, two at minimum & three to be sure; the third not in the same building as the other two.\n", "Q: windows pdf highlight, underline, etc come with a square in mac preview?

I also tried adobe dc reader\nThe squares are all empty, I didn't add anything in it.\n\n\nA: This is a compatibility issue I think.\nSame behavior happens when I copy something from MS Word 2013 to MS Word 365 (for Mac)\nBy the way, is it a macOS question or a Windows related question? If it's the latter, your question should not be here. :-)\n", "Q: Can an iPhone 7 be made to function as a NFC Tag? From what I’ve read, I know the iPhone 7 can work as a NFC reader, but I want it to be a NFC Tag. I have a NFC reader (an ID-12 RFID reader) for my house that controls a door. I’d like to be able to put my iPhone up to it and have the NFC reader on my door read my iPhone's Tag and open.\nCan an iPhone 7 be made to function an a NFC tag for a regular external NFC/RFID reader?\n\nA: No. iPhone can function only as a NFC reader. It is not possible to use it as a NFC Tag, and read it via some external NFC reader.\nNFC is available in iPhone 6/6 Plus/6s/6s Plus/SE and NFC with reader mode is available in iPhone 7 and later.\n\nA: The iPhone is perfectly capable of this, but this is a privilege Apple keeps to themselves.\nIf you're jailbroken, you can install NFCWriter X and do pretty much everything you've asked for. I haven't personally checked, but I would strongly assume this is the exact same way Apple Pay works as well. So the iPhone is certainly capable of this.\nThe problem is that apps are not capable of this, because Apple denies them the availability of such an API. The CoreNFC framework only allows reading, and the story has gone so far as that organizations have sought fully third-party access to the iPhone's NFC chip on a legal basis. They were dismissed however, with Apple Pay keeping its uniquely privileged status.\n", "Q: Upgrade iPhone 4 to run iOS 9 How do I upgrade my iPhone 4 to run iOS 9.0? Can this be done without a computer? I need it to download Facebook, YouTube and WhatsApp.\n\nA: The latest version of iOS that can be installed on iPhone 4 is iOS 7.1.2. It is not possible to upgrade it to run iOS 9.\niPhone is pretty old now as per iOS release schedule. It was discontinued in 2013 with support being stopped by Apple in 2014. To run iOS 9, you need at least an iPhone 4s which can run iOS 9.3.5.\n", "Q: Is there a lightning cable power splitter / double charger? A small example use case will make this clearer. I have a really long lightning cable that I use to charge my iPhone on my bedside table at night (there's no wall socket close). I'm thinking of buying AirPods and naturally I would like to charge them with a cable also on my bedside table next to my iPhone. However, I have no interest in using another USB wall adapter or buying/using another really long cable.\nSo, is there any small lightning cable power splitter for charging two devices from one cable? What I mean is a small adapter where on one side there is a female lightning port (to connect to the already existing cable) and on the other side the cable splits into two small cables each with a male lightning connector.\nI imagine this would be quite easy to do by manually splicing the cables. Since I'm only going to use this for charging (not syncing), it is just a question of splicing two male lightning connectors together by putting power and ground in parallel. But I'd be willing to pay a few bucks for something fabricated. Does anyone know of any product like this?\nNote: This is NOT a power/headphone lightning splitter for iPhone7+. I've searched the internet with all the search terms I can think of and all I can find are those splitters.\n\nA: No, this is not possible to make.\nYour question implies that you think of the Lightning cable as solely providing power in the form of two wires with +/- electricity. This is not the case.\nIn addition to simply power supply, the cable also contains wires that are used for communication between the charger and the device. When you plug your phone or other device into the charger, they start negotiating right away what kind of supply is needed. The charger acts differently according to the needs of the device plugged in.\nThis is the reason why you cannot have both a phone and AirPods (for example) spliced into the same charger cable - as the negotiation process would go hay-wire with multiple devices communicating on a protocol that is designed strictly for one-to-one communication.\nI would recommend instead getting a charger with multiple USB outputs. These can be bought quite cheaply - for example IKEA has a cheap charger with 3 USB outputs for plugging in Lightning cables. \nIn order to keep the Lightning cables short, you would have to extend the use of the 110/230V cable and place the actual charger nearer your devices.\n\nA: My recommendation is to get a small powered charging hub and run each charger independently. Anker and monster ones are very reliable, inexpensive and available worldwide. You can get them on clearance for $10 usually at http://meh.com and similar sites. \nGo for low power chargers, you don’t need fast charging at night and the non fast charge models are commodity priced now and not premium priced ($25) like the fancy fast chargers that run 5 devices. \n\nEven the fancy fast charge 2 USB devices are down to the $10 price point now - https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-PowerPort-PowerIQ-Foldable/dp/B071YMZ4LD\n", "Q: Applescript transform date format I'm using this to transform my date from a DD/MM/YYYY to MM/DD/YYYY\nset today to short date string of (current date)\nset t to (time string of (current date))\nset [_day, _month, _year] to [day, month, year] of date today\n\nset _month to _month * 1 --> 3\nset _month to text -1 thru -2 of (\"0\" & _month) --> \"03\"\nset the text item delimiters to \"/\"\nset today to {_month, _day, _year} as string\nset fullDateToday to today & \" \" & t as string\n\n\ne.g 04/20/2019  >  11/15/18\n\nAlthough how can I transform the year in YY instead of YYYY ?\n\nA: NOTE: I took what was described in a comment and converted it to an answer for completeness on this Q&A.\nTo convert the date so that the year is in YY format vs. YYYY format you could use this line to set _year.\nset _year to text -1 thru -2 of (\"0\" & _year)\n\nExample\nHere's a full example of the your AppleScript snippet:\n$ cat showdate.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\nosascript <<END\nset today to short date string of (current date)\nset t to (time string of (current date))\nset [_day, _month, _year] to [day, month, year] of date today\n\nset _month to _month * 1 --> 3\nset _month to text -1 thru -2 of (\"0\" & _month) --> \"03\"\nset _year to text -1 thru -2 of (\"0\" & _year)\nset the text item delimiters to \"/\"\nset today to {_month, _day, _year} as string\nset fullDateToday to today & \" \" & t as string\nEND\n\nAnd when it's executed we get the following.\nToday's date\n$ date\nSun Apr 21 00:21:08 EDT 2019\n\nvia AppleScript\n$ ./showdate.sh\n04/21/19 00:20:45\n\nHow it works\nThis AppleScript line:\nset _year to text -1 thru -2 of (\"0\" & _year)\n\nWhen executed, will set the variable _year to the last 2 digits of the contents of _year prior vale. So if the value was 2019, the above line would result in _year being 19.\n\n\n*\n\n*(\"0\" & _year) - converts _year's contents to a string by prefixing a 0 to the beginning\n\n*-1 thru -2 of ... - will slice the last 2 digits from _year, and remove everything else from _year\n\n*-1 starts indexing from the right instead of the left\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*Index » unScripted » Dates & Times in AppleScripts\n", "Q: What commands can I run in the Terminal, and how do I use them? I just found the Terminal and I want to know which commands I can run, and what they do.\nIs there a command that would list me the available commands?\nIs there a command that tells me how to use the commands (like \"help\" in the Windows command prompt)\n\nA: You can get a list of all the available commands by pressing the TAB key twice, and confirming that you want the list by pressing y.\nFor help on what each command does, use the man command to lookup manuals: \nman <command>\n\nYou’ll probably want to google a cheat sheet of the most useful commands as there’s hundreds and hundreds of commands even on a freshly installed system.\nBy the way - using the command line is not actually called “coding”. This term is usually only used when you create something that runs multiple “commands” following an algorithm (i.e. something that includes conditionals and/or loops).\n", "Q: Messages in iCloud not exhibiting expected behavior So I have Messages in iCloud enabled on my iMac - High Sierra, 10.13.6.  My iPhone - version 12.2 and iPad - version 12.1.4.  The issue id like to solve is this - on the iPhone an iPad when I delete a message, I get the warning / confirmation that if I delete a message it will delete across all devices, do I want to delete?  When I answer yes, the message will delete from the iPhone and iPad but not the iMac. When I go to delete a message on my iMac, I get no prompt / confirmation, the message will just delete.  I have sent numerous logs to apple, enabled a pin code for them to rest my iCloud account and sent them some sort of profile info, but they have been unable to get my messages to sync when deleting across all the devices.  I have also disabled and re-enabled iMessages in the cloud on all devices with no luck.\nCan anyone help me to get the iMessages deleting across all devices?  I am almost certain it did work properly at some point, but started this after an update.  Sorry to not be more specific on what I did with apple, but I did not write down all the info - but they have collected a lot of info and I do not remember for 100% sure when it started to act up.  This has been ongoing for awhile now and they just won't respond any longer.  Tks much!\n\nA: So I tried again with another apple senior advisor today as the previous one would never do what he said he would.  I think the issue is solved....

Regardless, you will need an installation disc for this appropriate version. Follow the instructions that come with the installer to install from the disc.\nRecovery mode is persistent on newer Macs, but can be erased on older ones.\n\nA: A circa 2001 iMac can run OS X Tiger 10.4.11 at the latest. You'll need installation media to boot the system. As well, the Linux installation will have partitioned and formatted the HDD in a fashion that OS X will not be able to use. As such, the very first step after booting to the installation media will be to run Disk Utility to remove and re-create the partition on the HDD. Once that is done, format the HDD as HFS+. After the HDD is successfully partitioned and formatted, the OS X installer will find a suitable installation target and your installation should proceed as normal.\n", "Q: cpu clock too low / force cpu clock / overclock I have a MacBook from a few years back. \nWhen I use it write some code and browse the internet, the fans go very fast and the noise is horrible.

I used to have a standard 24\" monitor (1920x1080) connected to the adapter, and it worked just fine; however, I have put a video capture device in between and while this device supports a 1080p resolution, macOS keeps on detecting it as running at 720p as its native resolution.\nI am able to force macOS to run this external device at 1080p by selecting the \"scaled\" video modes (and it appears to output a correct 1080p signal); however, every time macOS has a video configuration change (from me e.g. switching between mirroring and extending the desktop), it always defaults back to 720p.\nEssentially, it always defaults to \"best for display,\" but thinks that this best setting is 720p rather than my preference of 1080p.\nIs there any way to force macOS to change its default resolution for an external device, so I don't have to manually change the resolution every time?\n\nA: It turns out this is one of the many things that SwitchResX can do.\n", "Q: Software Glitch iPad 2 Caused Activation Lock I’m very new to this thread and I hope I’m in the right place for help. \nI’ve got an iPad 2 WIFI only model and have an issue, some time ago whilst I was using the iPad it suddenly and out of nowhere went to an activation required screen.\nI believe this to be a software issue as the iPad hasn’t gone to the very beginning of the setup process, I’ve attached 3 screenshots showing what it does. \nWhen I turn on the iPad I can see my wallpaper I’m required to enter my PIN to unlock but after that it goes straight to an activation required screen. Unfortunately it’s been years since setting up the device and as I’ve never had need to use iCloud password as I’ve got a seperate iTunes and App Store Apple ID have forgotten it. I can’t reset the password as I’ve got two step verification setup and I can’t find the recovery key, and unfortunately when two step verification is activated Apple automatically take away elements of the account recovery process. I no longer have the option to reset the password by answering security questions, recovery email or even submit an account recovery request. \nUnfortunately Apple won’t assist me without proof \nof purchase and as I purchased the iPad in Oct 2013 I’ve found it impossible to get a copy of an invoice from the supplier thus no help at all from Apple. \nAs the iPad still has everything installed on it is there some way of extracting the password by some means. \nIs data extraction or connecting the iPad to my iPhone Wirelessly to access the iPads data even possible? \nI’d appreciate any assistance anyone could give me.\n\n\nA: I would try contacting Apple about resetting the password on your Apple ID. Did you set up any security questions? Do you have a recovery email? Your best bet is to give them a call or live chat and tell them that you do not know the password to your account and do not have the 2WA code.\nSee what they say, you might be lucky enough to get it one-time reset with the right answers to their questions :)\n\nA: No. When you are at a passcode lock screen or activation lock screen, you can’t join any new networks. \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I bypass Activation Lock?\nBypassing activation lock is close to impossible and usually requires great expense if you cannot prove ownership to Apple’s satisfaction. \nWhat’s the chance you have a computer where it synced or backed up?\nAlso, check all Apple ID you control in case the device is registered and can be remotely unlocked / released. \nBarring that, you might need to sell the device for parts or learn how to repair these / recycle things when you’re done with it.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 8,2 (Early 2011, 15'' Unibody 2.3 GHz i7) - OS crashes randomly, after log in screen goes all white I have a Macbook Pro, randomly started running into issues when logging in after start up. Occasionally will get the desktop to load but shortly thereafter the OS crashes leading to a screen with multiple colored lines which sometimes resolve after varying amounts of time. Following the crash and after re-boot/log-in the screen will go to all white. \nAfter many of these crash sequences I booted into Recovery Mode and did a complete wipe of the harddrive with a fresh install of macOS (Sierra). I created a new user profile and logged in. All seemed well with normal use but after about 15 minutes of function as usual it went back to the same crashing sequence and white screen after log in.\nSuspecting a hardware problem, I ran AHT (apple hardware test) and cycled 4 times with the Extended Testing which read \"No trouble found.\" for each cycle. Subsequent to this and suspecting a hard drive issues that is simply not being picked up by the AHT I booted again into Recovery mode to try running first aid on my hard drive and noticed that it is registering and being completely used with no free space (after a complete wipe and reinstall of macOS...it should be essentially empty).\nI figure the complete wipe and re-install of mac OS would have solved any software related trouble that could be leading to this issue. That being said, I'm leaning toward one of three potential hardware issues being the source of my woes: hard drive, logic board or RAM. Right now the hard drive is my top suspicion but the clean cycles of AHT is confusing me.\nAny ideas on where I can go from here to try and narrow down the source of the problem before I go trying to get any of the hardware replaced?\n\nA: Many condolences. The 15\" MBPs from 2011/2012 had a very high frequency of hardware failures on the logic board, specifically the onboard graphics. From recollection, it was a manufacturing fault that was not suspected by Apple's hardware designers until large numbers of them started to fail in the wild, leading to a class-action suit against Apple, which was kept very quiet. AFAIK, there is no economically sound way of fixing this issue.\n", "Q: how can I delete a pkg file on a mac? I have a .pkg file for Malwarebytes on my computer.

When I go to a site that has a password saved and I select the password, Safari attempts to log me in immediately. However, this completely breaks functionality on some websites (ex adding accounts to RES etc). I believe this \"feature\" was added recently (10.14.4?).\nI was able to disable requiring Touch ID to log in, which is a step in the right direction, but I want to disable the auto login completely, while still autofilling passwords. Is this possible/how can I do it?\n\nA: Background\nUnfortunately it looks like Apple decided to change this behavior in Safari, at least according to this article titled: Safari: macOS browser now autosubmits logins. Here’s how to disable it:\n\nApple changed the behavior of Safari in macOS 10.14.4, and you may\n  have noticed it and thought it was a bug. Now, if you have stored a\n  password for a website, when you select a login entry to autofill,\n  Safari 12.1 for macOS automatically submits the login. Previously, it\n  would fill the fields and still require you to click a Login or Submit\n  or other button to proceed.\n\nApple mentions it here in their Mojave 10.14.4 Update release notes (2nd bullet):\n\nSafari\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Adds Dark Mode support for websites that support custom color schemes\n  \n*Streamlines website login when filling credentials with Password AutoFill\n  \n*Allows push notification prompts only after interacting with a website\n  \n*Adds a warning when an insecure webpage is loaded\n  \n*Removes support for the expired Do Not Track standard to prevent potential use as a fingerprinting variable; Intelligent Tracking\n  Prevention now protects against cross-site tracking by default\n  \n\nWorkaround\nSo it looks like your only recourse here is to disable auto fill under the  \"User names and passwords\" section of the AutoFill tab of Safari's preferences.\nAutFill tab under Safari Preferences\n\nEdit under User names and passwords\n\nNOTE: That dialog is actually just the Passwords tab, so you can just navigate to it directly.\n\nA: Or you could just Private Browse.\nThis stops the auto logging in functionality but leaves the passwords you have for any particular site. This seems to work when I have multiple logins for each site under different email addresses. This does seem to halt the auto login process\nThe downside, your website history is not recorded. Though that may be a good thing? \n", "Q: Why am I getting \"An internal error occurred while preflighting your volume for APFS conversion\"? I have a Mac Mini 2014.

If I try to install from an external USB, instead of the folder with a question mark, I get booted into Recovery again instead of continuing the installation process.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Try to install on the old disk first, to see whether there is a hardware issue with your new disk, for instance by copying a lot of files to it. You can also then install a second copy of your OS to the SSD and see where it fails.\nOnce both work, if you boot with ALT and press CTRL, it will save the ssd you are booting to as default.\n\nA: Its the hard drive cable in most cases.\n", "Q: Why is Apple Mail showing as 61GB? Can anyone explain/help with this? (My local Mac techy can't.)\nMy 2013 Retina MBP (running Mojave) is almost full, but it tells me Mail is somehow using 61GB. It was showing 70GB until I deleted almost all my mails and changed the settings so downloads do not automatically download. What is creating this mysterious 61GB and how to get rid of it (and prevent it from coming back), please?\n\nA: Mail is one of the easiest to clean up in most cases.\n\n\n*\n\n*Verify your mail providers have all of your mail stored in the cloud.\n\n*If you are cloud based, remove each mail account one by one, then repeat the measurement of the databases.\n\n\nUsually it’s attachments and indexing that take that much space, but when you delete the mail account from settings, that should clean up all the local storage.\nIf you have local copies of mail, you’ll have to export / back that up to be sure you don’t lose those mails before removing the account.\nHow much space is used once you delete all accounts or get a good backup and then delete accounts?\nIf you show a screen shot of how you're measuring, we might have some extra advice, like not using the system information if there are time machine local snapshots (or how to purge them) or if you just need to remove some library files or ask for a database \"vacuum\" process.\n", "Q: 2018 MacBook Pro won't let me install macOS High Sierra 10.13 from USB installer I've got a 2018 MacBook Pro (Model ID : MacBook 15,1) that shipped with macOS Mojave 10.14, that I need to downgrade to run macOS High Sierra 10.13.\nI've tried reformatting the main drive using Disk Utility and then re-installing the OS from recovery mode, which from past experience loads the lowest OS the machine shipped with (for the 2018 MBP that is 10.13.6). But for some reason when I do this it keeps loading macOS Mojave 10.14.\nSo I've gone for another solution: I've created a USB installer of macOS High Sierra 10.13, wiped the MacBook Pro drive again, gone to the Startup Security Utility, and set medium security and allowed boot from external drive. I then restart the computer holding the Option key and booted using the USB installer.\nAfter a loading screen, I keep getting a Install macOS Mojave menu. Any ideas why this would be, and why it's not letting me install macOS High Sierra 10.13?\nAlthough the 2018 MacBook Pro originally shipped with macOS High Sierra 10.13, could it be that I have a later model of 2018 MacBook Pro, that only has drivers for macOS Mojave 10.14 and later? Or do all 2018 MacBook Pros work with the same drivers?\n\nA: Original answer\nAs described in this support article, there are different ways to load macOS Recovery: \n\n  \n*\n  \n*cmd+R: Install the latest macOS that was installed on your Mac.\n  \n*alt+cmd+R: Upgrade to the latest macOS compatible with your Mac.\n  \n*shift+alt+cmd+R: Install the macOS that came with your Mac, or the closest version still available.\n  \n\nI suggest you try the last option and see if it lets you install macOS 10.13.\n\nUpdate as per OP comments\nApparently the key combinations from my previous answer did not work for you and you receive the message \"/Applications/Install macOS High Sierra.app does not appear to be a valid OS installer application.\", when creating the USB installer.\nIt seems you face exactly the issue discussed here. The AppStore downloaded only a down-sized version of the installer image. Try the solutions offered in the answers over there. Basically you have to first download the full image / SharedSupport folder before you can create your USB boot installer.\n\nA: What you have posted in your comments to your question, the download of High Sierra from the App Store is only c. 20mb. I have High Sierra on a iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) and Get Info on my High Sierra download shows a size of 22,697,095 bytes (15.1 MB on disk). However, when downloading High Sierra from a iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013) running Mojave results in Get Info returning a size of 5,233,714,192 bytes (5.24 GB). So did you even try the answer I posted in your original question?\n\nA: Macs can usually only go back to the version each one shipped with. So even if the model can go back to 10.13 if it was bought earlier, if yours had 10.14 factory installed, it will refuse to go back to 10.13.\nHowever, there are ways around that.\nBesides making sure that you create install media with the complete install (5-6 GB, not 20MB, as mentioned by David Anderson), you can also, if that fails, copy a whole image of a 10.13 system to your hd. Easiest if you have the working 10.13 disk attached externally and boot from it - this will also show you whether the 10.13 system will boot on your Mac at all. If it works, you may have to boot into recovery if disk utility can't copy the image directly to the internal disk.\n\nA: It is possible but not all the time. Here's why:\n\n\n*\n\n*Latest macOS might have features that won't run on the older Macs(hardware wise. eg: fingerprint reader on new MacBook but older macOS won't have support for that)\n\n*Drivers might be outdated\n\n*The bootloader and other parts of the hardware might outright restrict this due to security issues.\n\n\nIs it possible to install an old version of Mac OS on a new Mac? will answer a lot of your questions.\nAgain, it's not impossible but you need to consider the above points.\n", "Q: How do you connect an Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric pad to Windows 10 via Bluetooth? I recently bought an Apple magic keyboard with numeric pad to use with my computer, after reading threads online that you can connect it via Bluetooth to a Windows PC. When I search to add a new Bluetooth device, my PC doesn't find the keyboard.\nI tested the keyboard with my MacBook Pro where I am able to use it fine. It also connects using the wire to my PC, but it won't find the keyboard via Bluetooth. My Windows PC has Bluetooth 5.0, and I've tried holding down Command + W, tried resetting the keyboard via my MacBook Pro, but it still isn't able to find my keyboard.\nDoes anyone know a way to fix this issue?\n\nA: When you have the Windows Bluetooth pane open and it is searching for devices then slide the power control on the keyboard to Off and then On shortly after. This should make the keyboard discoverable by Windows.\nMake sure that the keyboard is not plugged in via cable to another computer, and make sure that it is not able to communicate with a previously paired Mac at the same time.\nNote that the comments you have received earlier regarding duplicates and directions concerns a completely different keyboard, namely the \"Apple Wireless Keyboard\". You have the \"Apple Magic Keyboard\" which works in a slightly different manner regarding Bluetooth pairing - and it doesn't have a power button, but rather a slider. \n\nA: Okay, so I also tried to connect the Apple Magic Keyboard to Windows 10 and I ran into several problems.\n\n\n*\n\n*As long as I had it connected via USB, it couldn't be discovered by\nWindows\n\n*Even when pairing was then initialized, Windows showed a driver\nproblem\n\n\nSo I unplugged the keyboard and installed Magic Utilities.\nhttps://magicutilities.net/magic-keyboard/download\nOnce they were installed, the pairing worked fine - no driver issues any more. I didn't have to enter any sort of PIN on the keyboard - as mentioned elsewhere on the web -, but simply confirmed that this was the right device.\nI am writing this via bluetooth now! :)\n\nA: You can map all of the fn keys and more to their functions(e.g. F11 for VolumeDown) through this github package that I have submitted a PR for to add installation instructions.\nI haven't been able to connect to my keyboard through bluetooth, although it does show up in the pairing section, it just doesn't let me connect.\n", "Q: The screen on my iPhone 5s no longer turns off automatically while I am talking on a call How to turn the screen off of my iPhone while on a call? Screen remaining on is causing unintended things like putting people on hold and unintended button presses. This is really annoying.\n\nA: The most likely explanation for this behavior is that the Proximity sensor in your iPhone is not working as expected. It is a sensor located near the earpiece of your iPhone.\n\nProximity sensor is responsible for detecting if your iPhone is placed near your face, and in case it is, turn-off the screen automatically. This helps in preventing unintended taps on the screen as well as preserving battery life while on a call.\nTo resolve, you can try the following steps one by one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure nothing is obstructing the proximity sensor. A screen guard, dust accumulation, case etc.\n\n*Restart your iPhone. This can sometime help in re-setting any software bug/glitch which may be interfering with the working of Proximity sensor.\n\n*Update to the latest version of iOS software available for your iPhone. This can help by doing away with any software bug which may be interfering with the working of Proximity sensor.\n\n*If everything above fails, you can try by factory resetting your iPhone and see if that fixes the issue.\n\n*Your last resort would be to get your iPhone inspected by an Apple authorized service provider or technician and get the Proximity sensor replaced.\n\nImage source: https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/fix-your-iphone-proximity-sensor-by-yourself.html\n", "Q: iOS mail app opens links in safari, not Facebook I am trying to figure something out for my mom.

She wants to be able to click on the link in Mail on her iPad and have it open in the Facebook app, not in  safari. How does one do this?\n\nA: There's no way, at the current time, to open links in anything other than Safari from iOS.  Apple has not provided a way to set the default application for opening links, it's always Safari.\nI'm assuming she's using the default Mail app (you didn't mention if she's. using a 3rd party app).  One way might be to have her try a to tap and hold the link.  This could bring up a share sheet.  If Facebook is in that share sheet, she can tap Facebook to send the link to the Facebook app.\nAnother option is to you an app like Opener.  \nThis app lets you open a copied URL in different applications but it's more of a work-around to the problem.

Any way I can fix this?\nI'm not making very many purchases on my iPhone so I know it's not being caused by actual new purchases each time.

When I looked a little more closely, I found I had checked that I wanted \"Selected Books\" to be synced.  For the three books I had checked as ones to sync, I am now showing multiple copies (10 copies in one case) in the iTunes Books sync page; although there is only one copy of each when I look in the Books app on my iPhone and Mac Mini.  Since I have my Books app on the iPhone set to use iCloud anyway, decided there I didn't need to also sync them when I do my iTunes sync.  After unchecking \"Sync Books\" and hitting \"Apply\" in iTunes, the every-time-I-do-an-iTunes-sync reminder to transfer purchased items have stopped.\nMaybe when iTunes gets split up into separate apps (as I heard might/will happen) these iTunes sync issues will get sorted out.  But don't get your hopes up.  I think we're lucky Apple supports sync-to-your-computer-without-using-iCloud at all.\nOther details: iPhone 7, iOS 12.2, MacOS Mojave 10.14.4, iTunes 12.9.4.94, Lightning cable.\n", "Q: Safari in a strange mode where pages randomly zoom in and pages slide to the right Recently Safari has gotten into a mode where unwanted events are happening.

Pages will also \"slide\" off the app by sliding finger across mouse.\nI've tried restarting Safari and I've tried restarting my computer. Neither of these helped.  I have a \"Zoom\" extension for Safari but I've turned it off.\n\nA: Sounds like you have system zoom enabled. You can disable it from System Settings > Accessibility > Zoom.\nWhen you have system zoom enabled, you can toogle it with cmd-opt-8, or use your control gesture which is by default the ctrl button in addition with the scroll gesture (i.e. sliding your finger across the mouse as you mention, or using the scroll wheel on a mouse).\nRegarding Safari it seems like you're not aware that you have gestures enabled. If you go to System Settings > Trackpad or System Settings > Mouse according to what you use, you can see the gestures that are enabled.

Is there a way to view the background process, of ls for example, within terminal to trace these back to an answer?\n\nA: The manual page for ls(1) documents the defaults:\n\nThe default is \"exfxcxdxbxegedabagacad\", i.e. blue foreground and default background for regular directories, black foreground and red background for setuid executables, etc.\n\nThose defaults are compiled into the ls binary - you can confirm this by browsing the source code.

Whenever I copy something from the web and paste it in my Mail or Evernote, or Apple Notes, it always brings the text style from the page and inserts those weird looking fonts in my mail, or notes.\nMy solution for that is to paste it in a plain text editor, VIM in my case, and then copy and paste where I need it to get rid of the style. It's pretty elaborate process, especially when I need to copy/paste often during research.\nI'm wondering how other people cope with the fonts, and what's a better solution?\n\nA: Most people I know set the paste shortcut to invoke paste and match style. Here is the command to change:\n\nYou can paste with style when you really want it, but for me 95% of the time I don’t want the style and only the raw text. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Select Keyboard\n\n*Go to the Shortcuts tab\n\n*Select App Shortcuts\n\n*Select the + button\n\n*Type Paste and Match Style into the Menu Title field\n\n*Select the Keyboard Shortcut field\n\n*Enter ⌘V as the shortcut.\n\n\nYou can then have another shortcut for the “normal” paste that includes styled text when desired.

You can download the software from the given link. With later versions of macOS, the Boot Camp Assistant can be used to download the software.\nYou probably will need to install Windows to legacy BIOS boot. This means the drive will have to be hybrid partitioned. This is where Windows uses the MBR partition table and macOS uses the GUID partition table (GPT). Also, you should use the optical (DVD) drive to install Windows. If you have latest firmware installed, then you might be able to use a flash drive to install the latest Windows 10. Currently, with would be the October 2018 update. You can get the latest firmware by having the latest version of High Sierra installed.\nYou can not BIOS boot from a flash drive. If you succeed in booting the Windows installer from a flash drive, then you will have used an EFI boot method. However, even though you have EFI booted the installer, you still will need to install Windows 10 to BIOS boot. This is because the Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621 probably contains drivers that require Windows to BIOS boot. Instructions for properly use a flash drive to install Windows 10 can be found at the accepted answer to the question: How to install Windows 10 into a 2011 iMac without using the Boot Camp Assistant, an optical (DVD) drive or third party tools?\n\nA: According to Apple the earliest model of MacBook that supports Windows 10 is the 2012 and later models. Which leaves your model officially off the list of supported systems.\nIt may be possible to install Windows 10 anyway and there are a lot of discussions on AskDifferent and elsewhere with hints, tips and instructions on installing an unsupported Windows via Boot Camp on various Macs. \nI will leave finding those resources up to you.\n", "Q: iMovie will not recognise my 60fps video?

I then tried changing it to record with hardware NVENC (which I'm guessing ShadowPlay uses) and with all the other settings the same this doesn't work, refuses to save at 60fps.\nSo I think its nvidia hardware recording... not 100% sure, but it seems pretty damning evidence.\n", "Q: Disabled always use location for Google Maps, but I still get \"Google Maps is using your location\" So basically, here are my settings for Google Maps for iOS (running on an iPhone):\n\nAs can be seen Location is set to While Using, and Background App Refresh is turned off.\nBut, still when I exit from Google Maps, I get the message that it is actively using my location:\n\nI remember few iOS update ago this didn't happen. I have an iPhone 6s running iOS 12.2.\nHow do I disable Google Maps from accessing the location after leave the app by pressing the Home button?\n\nA: Google Maps uses one of the special privilege modes in iOS called background execution mode. Background execution is crucial for certain kind of apps such as those playing music, VoIP apps and the ones which provide navigation functionality.\nApps with the said requirements can be programmed in a special way so that they can continue execution even after you return back to the Home screen. Since the Google Maps app is providing navigation functionality (which can include spoken navigation), it continues to run when you press the Home button. Since the app is using location, the same is shown to you in the form of elongated and highlighted status bar.\n", "Q: How do I configure DNS now that OS X Server doesn't support it? I was using OS X Server to run DNS for my local network.  As many know, the Mojave version of Server dropped a lot of the services that were there, one of which was DNS.  Unfortunately I didn't read the fine print when I upgraded my server to Mojave and was later surprised when I couldn't find the DNS settings in Server any longer.\nThe thing is that DNS is still running.  I can still hit my servers within my local network by name same as I was in High Sierra.  The problem is I have no way to make changes or even pull the settings so I can migrate to another DNS server.\nIs there a way from the CLI to grab the settings from the old DNS server instance?  Then how do I shut that one down so I can try to migrate to another version?\n\nA: Locating configs with lsof\nYou could use lsof to try and find out what files the running DNS server is currently using and perhaps find out where the existing files are located.\n$ lsof -p $(pgrep -f <name of DNS server>)\n\nNOTE: I believe the configuration files are typically located here ,/Library/Server/, so you may want to look through there for them.\nYou may also want to look at the following resources regarding this from Apple:\nBIND\nDNS on Mojave server\n\nDNS is no longer included in Server.app so you will have to do it\n  either on a Mac running an older version of macOS and hence older\n  version of Server.app or do it via the command line.\nIf you manually install BIND then at least the config files will be\n  the same as previously used in Server.app although in a different\n  location\n\nBased on this it sounds like you may be able to simply take your existing configs, if you can find them, and use them directly with BIND.\nService Migration Guide\nAlso take a look at this guide put out by Apple titled: macOS Server\nService Migration Guide v1.2.\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*Setting up a local DNS server on OSX\n\n*Configuring Your Own DNS Server on Mac OS X\n", "Q: Import keychain to clean macOS install?

There is a way in the mac world to monitor all the signals an HID device (a remote)  sends to the OS?\nThe final aim is to handle those and remap them to keyboard shortcuts.\nMore details: a Logitech remote I have (Logitech S510 media remote, a combo keyboard/mouse/remote) doesn't works on macOS (just the volume controls and few other buttons works). I was wondering if there is an easy way (in any language) to listen the remote signals and remap them. \nSo the first step is to find a way to monitor the signals and check if all buttons signals are recognized by the OS.\n\nA: NSEvent\nTo monitor input events sent to macOS from Human Interface Devices (HID), look at NSEvent's addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask:handler:. This is the method used to associate scripts and tasks to hotkeys by third party macOS tools.\nYou will likely need to write in Objective-C or Swift and codesign the resulting binary. I expect you will also need to grant the binary additional access rights at runtime – probably in the Accessibility panel of System Preferences > Security & Privacy.\nA search on GitHub will provide a few sample projects using this method.\n", "Q: Update style button not appearing in Pages This issue occurs for me constantly in Mac Pages. When I want to update a style, such as changing line-spacing or fonts, the \"Update\" button will not appear next to the selected style in the format section. Therefore I cannot make global changes to the style. \nSometimes I am able to \"force\" the button to appear by changing line spacing to a different number then click Update, then change it back, then click Update again. But this does not always cause the Update button to appear either. The appearances are totally random.\n\n\nA: I think this has to do with your current selection. I think Pages makes a distinction between paragraph and character styles, just like MS-Word (bleh). I seem to remember that in older versions of Pages this was a bit more obvious (are character styles even a thing in Pages anymore?). In typical Apple fashion, things seem to be handled \"automagically\" now.\nI'm using v8.2.1 here, and I seem to be able to get the \"Update\" button on the style whenever the current selection is clearly \"an entire paragraph\". Line spacing will always be a paragraph-only property, so the \"Update\" button will appear, even if the selection isn't just a paragraph. Changing the color of a single word on the other hand, will not offer the \"Update\" button. But the button does appear when you select an entire paragraph first, and then change the color. \nI still keep a copy of good ol' Pages '09 around, because it has some features that are still missing in the rewrite (mirrored page margins for example). I'm not a fan of this type of \"productivity\" software, but Pages is the least annoying of the bunch (MS-Word being the worst, Google Docs way too limited for anything serious).\n", "Q: LG Ultrafine 5k -- right half is a slightly different color from left New refurbished model # 27MD5KA.

On the right side of the screen the panel is slightly lighter than the left side (or the left is slightly darker -- I'm not sure which is the 'correct' color/brightness). You can tell very clearly in Intellij IDEA in the default darcula color scheme. It's harder to tell on light backgrounds.\nI'm guessing this has something to do with the dual display port 1.2 streams that the monitor uses.\nIs there any way to color correct this?\nThanks!\n\nA: I've been having this issue for quite some time. Usually, a reboot would make it go away, but recently it has become much more persistent.

Last week some students delivered me some image files over an image processing assignment. I have an automated routine on Matlab to grade the assignments, but it only loads files with a specific \".jpeg\" extension.\nRather than rewrite my routine, I usually just rename the files (a mess of \".jpg\", \".JPEG\", \".JPG\") on terminal. I'm used to do that on my University issued linux desktop. But that day I had my MacBook Pro with me, so I got them with it.\nAlas, my terminal command \"mv *.jpg *.jpeg\" returned with a no such file or directory error, so I left this task for later. Earlier today I got to work after a three day weekend and when I opened the folder, I realized that about half of the files were missing.\nMy guess is that the mv didn't \"fail properly\" and, based on some thing that I've already looked around, may have lost the data for good! My Time Machine is at home, so it never got to back up those files.\nI have already looked for possibly hidden folders where the files might have ended up, but no luck. Does anyone has any idea where the files may have gone? Or if they are truly lost?\nAtt.\nOsmar\n\nA: If you have a directory/folder of JPEG files that have either a .jpg and or .JPG extension and you want to change the extension to .jpeg, then in Terminal, use the following compound command after changing directory cd ... to the directory containing the JPEG files:\nfor f in *.[jJ][pP][gG]; do mv -n \"$f\" \"${f%.*}.jpeg\"; done\n\n\nA: Try completing your Time Machine backup. macOS uses the free space on your hard disk to do backups of changed/new files hourly and writes those to your backup disk when you connect to your Time Machine.\nIt's quite likely that if you do a Time Machine backup, then search for your missing files, you'll find them.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Have DHCP for Wi-Fi and static IP for Ethernet?

This discussion shows a screenshot where you can augment the service order for the network connections.\n\nSet your connections appropriately under their respective configurations (Wi-Fi vs. Ethernet) and then set the order so that the connection you've decided and configured as the Internet facing one is the one with higher service order than the other.\nThis should give you what you want.\n", "Q: Enabling \"Hardened Runtime\" from outside of XCode This question is prompted by the new Notarization requirements that Apple will enforce for Mac Apps distributed outside of the Mac App Store targeting Mojave (in the near future.)\nI maintain a suite of self-hosted, Developer ID Application certificate-signed apps, using a custom runtime (Excelsior JET for Mac Java JIT Compiler / Runtime); custom bash scripts (are used as part of the apps in the installation process) and automate the builds. Therefore, there are no XCod` projects per-se involved in this process. \nAfter consulting the developer docs, I wasn't able to find a way to activate and customize this \"hardened mode\" (described here) by using any kind utilities from XCode, but from the CLI (instead of the IDE GUI).

I was having some issues with my mac so I reset NVRAM by holding ⌘+⌥+P+R.\nThe problem is that this laptop does not chime when NVRAM is reset, so I'm not sure if NVRAM was indeed reset.\nHow can I find out whether NVRAM was reset?\nIs there some terminal command that shows when NVRAM was last reset? \n\n\n*\n\n*Laptop: 2017 MacBook Pro\n\n*OS:MacOS High Sierra\n\n\nA: Doesn't appear to be a direct way to do this. Part of the problem is that your changes to the NVRAM, if you were to clear it (nvram -c), will not take effect until after a reboot.\nYou could try this method which will perform a side-by-side diff of the contents of NVRAM prior to running a nvram -c.\nFor example:\n$ sdiff <(nvram -xp) <(nvram -c &> /dev/null; nvram -xp) | less\n\nIf there's any changes you should see lines with vertical bars (|) which will denote lines that changed. Content on the left side will be your before and content on the right will be your after.\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*How to View & Clear the Mac NVRAM Contents from Terminal in Mac OS X\n\nA: The no fuss way\nThe simplest way to know for sure that NVRAM was cleared would be to use Terminal to run:\nsudo nvram -c\n*enter your password at the prompt*\nnvram -p\n\nConfirm nvram -p produces no output except a blank line, then restart your computer. If this fixes your problem, excellent. If not, you can move on to the next troubleshooting step knowing you properly cleared your NVRAM.\n\nThe reason this can be a bit tricky to determine is that even when\nNVRAM is cleared, your computer still populates NVRAM with some\ndefault information during the start up process, which varies between\nparticular machines.  So after you restart, if you run nvram -p yet\nagain, you'll see it's no longer blank.\n\nThe scenic route for the curious\nIf you haven't already done the above, but have tried the option + command + P + R method during startup, you can more exhaustively investigate your NVRAM by doing something like this:\nnvram -p >> ~/Desktop/nvramBefore.txt\n*expect a text file to be created on your Desktop*\nsudo nvram -c\n*enter your password*\nnvram -p\n*verify no output*\n*restart computer*\nnvram -p >> ~/Desktop/nvramAfter.txt\n\nThen compare nvramBefore.txt to nvramAfter.txt manually or with a command line tool like sdiff. You should be able to see what your NVRAM looked like before you noodled with it and after.\nAssuming you tried the key combinations during startup method before running these commands in Terminal, use the following as a guide as to what happened:\n\n*\n\n*If the before/after files are the same or very similar: the keypress method worked.\n\n*If the before/after files are very different: the sudo nvram -c method worked.\nYou can delete your before and after files at this point if you're done or save them in a NVRAM folder with notes to investigate a particularly difficult problem.\n\nFor more info on NVRAM run nvram -h and man nvram in Terminal or visit: https://ss64.com/osx/nvram.html\n", "Q: How can I manually lock an iPhone X screen I have my iPhone X configured to auto-lock in 30 minutes. But sometimes I want to manually lock sooner, is this possible? By lock, I mean require the passcode.  I know that I could set the phone to require a passcode \"Immediate\" but, I would like to keep it set at 15 minutes for general use.  I only want to force it to require a passcode when I'm out for a run which is just 3 times a week.\nI run with the iPhone, and sometimes find it's unlocked and in some unwanted state, due to unintended touches.\nI don't have Face ID enabled I just require a Passcode. I know I can press the Side button to make the screen go dark. But for the next 15 minutes, all I need to unlock is swipe up. I want to lock it so that a Passcode is again required. That way when I'm running, nothing will happen other than me accidentally pressing the wrong numbers for the passcode.\n\nA: You can press the side button once to lock your iPhone X screen. This puts your iPhone to sleep mode and locks the screen (you'll be required to verify with facial attention or input passcode to unlock).\nFor more details, refer to the Apple Support article:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use gestures to navigate your iPhone X and later\n\nWake and sleep\nRaise to wake or tap to wake your iPhone X.\nTo put your iPhone X to sleep, press the side button.\n\n\nAs pointed by @ernie, it's worth noting that an iPhone X with Face ID enabled unlocks as soon as you look at the screen when it is in awake state. To test that the screen was locked using this approach, you'll need to wake the device while not directly looking at the screen.\n\nIf you are not using Face ID\nIf you have turned off Face ID for your iPhone X, you'll need to enter your device Passcode to unlock. However, there's an additional setting which could prevent your device from going into lock mode after turning off the display by pressing the Side button. It is possible to set a time duration until which the iPhone is not locked (when you have turned off Face ID). To lock your iPhone immediately after putting the display to sleep after pressing the Side button, go to Settings app → Face ID & Passcode → Require Passcode and tap on Immediately.\n\n\nA: I realize this is old but the answer may have come with the new OS. I’ll try with an old one to check.  I have my Lock Screen set to 15 minutes, but if you press and hold Volume Up and the right side button like you are trying to power down, then hit Cancel, it will immediately lock. So you can force a lock quicker than your settings by doing this. Most comments I think misunderstood the question.\nSo for the 99% of the time you want the Lock Screen delayed you have it set to whatever you want in settings. But if you want immediate lock without restarting then hold volume and right side and then cancel. Immediate lock.\n", "Q: Take screenshot of screenshot with AppleScript I want to open an image on the desktop with the 'Quick Look', then screenshot it, and then open the new screenshot to take another one of it.

That is not true obviously, when I get to that point I need to plug it to the MagSafe, or do a SMC reset, or if none of the previous work, a PRAM reset. Then it will work perfectly for a few hours (or days, randomly).\nCoconutBattery states the battery has a good health but I noticed (before doing an SMC), that battery was disappearing and reappearing suddenly from battery, as if it doesn't exists. I did a few hardware checks at boot ant they always looked perfect but one time in which I got PPT001 error (battery not detected).\nI can't get to have a permanent fix and I wanted to ask someone else before bringing it back to the Apple center as it's a bit far away from my home.\n\nA: Check if your charger might be dying.\nI recently had to change the charger of an old MacBook, after experiencing very similar issues and eliminating all sorts of other possible problems. I even bought a new battery (yes, it was that old). I was about to give up on the device, thinking the motherboard was dead or something.\nAs a last resort I went to a local store and asked to try charging it with a new MagSafe charger. The device has been happily working again ever since.\nTry doing the same; it's basically free to try if they have a relevant charger in stock.\n", "Q: FaceTime continually drops and loses net connection Comcast high-speed internet; up-to-date Apple devices.

I have a couple of these keychains that I've brought with me to each new machine over the years. \nWhen I login, it asks me several times for the password to these keychains, how do I prevent this?\nNote these keychains are not my login keychain.\n\n\n\nA: Doesn't look like this is possible. At least according to this blog post.\nReference: Mac and iOS Keychain Tutorial: How Apple’s iCloud Keychain Works\n\nNote that while your login keychain is the default, it is unlocked as\n  soon as you log into your Mac. You can increase security by creating a\n  non-login keychain — all this requires is an additional password when\n  you start up or log into your Mac\n\nI think what you'd need to do here is likely import the copied keychain file's content to the main keychain file if that's the behavior that you want.\n", "Q: Is there a spec or standard for .mobileconfig?

Does anyone know what's wrong with my computer?\n\nA: The easiest way I've found to do this is to simply right click on the desktop, which will open up a popup menu (see screenshot below of popup menu). \nNOTE: Right clicking can either be a 2 finger click or a 2 finger tap (depending on how you have your gestures configured).\n\nThen from here you can change the image.\n\n", "Q: MacBook going into blank screen after Apple Logo I’ve been trying to turn on my MacBook Pro. It goes into a black screen while it’s trying to boot ( as the progress bar reaches 50% on the Apple Logo Screen).\nI am able to boot into the recovery mode and I've run the FirstAid test for my hard disk. It didn’t find any issues with the device. \nTried to login into safe mode, after the Apple logo progress screen. It goes into a spinning circle screen and it gets stuck in a loop.

I went through with the whole downloading and installation process. But I still end up with the same issue after booting my MacBook. I am only able to access the recovery menu.\n\nA: It's possible that something in the OS got corrupted. Boot into recovery mode (hold ⌘-R on boot for those who don't know) and select the option to Reinstall OSX. It won't touch your user files or applications; it just lays down a new copy of the OS, which will likely fix your issue. You may need to explicitly connect it to your wifi/ethernet to do this.

There is a version 10.13 and below. It isn't cheap at $120 new and $60 upgrade, but it's very, very good at unpicking a corrupted system.\nIf you have a clone of your OS you can load the clone download DW and run via the clone against your harddrive. They will also post you a bootable system on a USB as well (if you don't have any way of imaging the harddrive). If their bootable system doesn't work, it's a hardware fault such as RAM.

One display is connected to the docking station via DisplayPort; the other via HDMI. The Mac is connected to the docking station with a single USB-C cable. The display arrangement in macOS is set up accordingly and is working perfectly.\nHowever, when I disconnect the Mac from the docking station and connect it to a different external monitor (e.g. a TV) via a HDMI dongle, then the display arrangement settings in macOS are reset the next time I reconnect the Mac to the docking station.\nDoes anyone have any idea why this is happening and how to fix it, so that I don't have to reconfigure the display arrangement each time I connect my Mac to a different display?\n\nA: macOS fails to preserve my monitor layouts too. I wrote a tool called displayplacer that lets describe your monitor layout as a terminal command. I then use BetterTouchTool to execute these profiles via hotkeys. Create a profile for your layout with the docking station and then execute the profile after you plug in.\nFor example, on my 4 monitor setup at home I have this profile: displayplacer \"id:A46D2F5E-487B-CC69-C588-ECFD519016E5 res:3840x2160 hz:60 color_depth:8 scaling:off origin:(0,0) degree:0\" \"id:F466F621-B5FA-04A0-0800-CFA6C258DECD res:1440x900 color_depth:4 scaling:on origin:(-1440,1437) degree:0\" \"id:4C405A05-8798-553B-3550-F93E7A7722BB res:1440x2560 color_depth:8 scaling:off origin:(3840,-363) degree:270\" \"id:18173D22-3EC6-E735-EEB4-B003BF681F30 res:1920x1200 color_depth:8 scaling:off origin:(960,-1200) degree:0\"\nAlso available via Homebrew brew tap jakehilborn/jakehilborn && brew install displayplacer\n", "Q: Is it possible to make a macOS app accessible via Status menu?

Recently I updated my iPhone 6s to iOS 12.2.\nWhen I went to compile my app, Xcode told me it needed to be upgraded to deploy to device running iOS 12.2.\nWhen I went to upgrade Xcode, it told me my OS needed to be upgraded to macOS Mojave.\nWhen I went to upgrade my Mid 2010 MacBook Pro to Mojave, App Store said “Nah uh, your computer is too old”.\nI tried to restore my iPhone to 12.1.4 from the .ipsw, and iTunes says Apple says “Uh um, nope; I decline to authorize…”\nAm I separated from my app and data until I pony up for a newer Mac?\n\nA: Your computer is too old to be officially supported on macOS Mojave, I'm afraid. Also it is not possible to downgrade an iPhone to an older iOS version, unless you have saved certain information before you did the upgrade (which you didn't do).\nHowever there are two unsupported methods of running macOS Mojave anyways, which will enable you to install Xcode 10.2 and develop for iOS 12.\nThe first option is to use the Mojave Patcher third party utility found here:\nhttp://dosdude1.com/mojave/ \nIt essentially patches a Mojave installation package to be able to run on older, otherwise unsupported hardware.\nThe other option is to use a virtualisation system such as VMware Fusion or Parallels Desktop and run Mojave inside a virtual machine.\n\nA: Yes. Turns out your only option is get a newer Mac capable of running macOS Mojave.\nYour MacBook Pro can't upgrade past macOS High Sierra 10.13.6.

Examples given in the man page mention removable media readers equipped with a motor to physically eject a volume, such as a CD-ROM player. Also, when there are more than one filesystem on the media, diskutil eject will unmount all volumes on the media, while diskutil unmount just unmounts the one filesystem you mention explicitly.\nWhen in doubt, I'd always go for the eject verb.\n\nA: You unmount a volume, and eject a drive. For non-removable media, eject and unmount are equivalent. If the media is removable, eject tells the OS the media is to be removed and the OS releases all links to the drive.   This question was asked on the apple discussion board and you can review the responses here.\n", "Q: Is there any command line alternative to Activity Monitor that would yield the same results? I know there's top and htop commands, but they lack a lot of information. For example there is no way to list processes from Energy tab.

These work fine.\nI have a Windows-to-Go Win10 install on a Sandisk Extreme 1TB USB-C SSD. This works fine - with an external mouse and keyboard.\nWithout the external input devices, I'm forced to use the touch bar for function keys, etc. The touch bar doesn't change context - swapping feature keys for F1...F12, etc. - when holding the Fn key. It displays all of the feature buttons (apologies as I don't know the term for these), but all of the buttons behave as Fx keys. So, I can't change the display brightness, volume (other than via the speaker icon on the task bar), etc. \nI could live with that, but it's annoying.\nThe touch pad is the big issue. I can point and click. It does not however recognize two finger clicks, so I can't scroll or access a context menu.\nTo clarify: All of this works on the Win10 install on the internal SSD. It does not work when booting form the external drive. The internal SSD is hosting a Windows Insider version that I need for work. The external SSD has the latest public Win10 release.\nEverything works fine under MacOS.\nI've run the Bootcamp WindowsSupport install (obtained on this machine via Bootcamp Assistant) to get all of the drivers in place, and it claims to have succeeded. I have network, keyboard, AMD drivers and almost everything except for this odd behavior from the touch bar and the touch pad. \nHelp? \nI suspect this is a driver issue, but I've not been able to install anything beyond what the Bootcamp installer provided. \n\nA: The Boot Camp Windows Support Software contains files that should be exposed to the Windows installer early in the installation process. There is also software that can be installed after Windows finishes installing. You may have only preformed the after part. In other words, have you made sure all the INF-style drivers were copied to the driver store before the first reboot during the installation process.\nWhen using the Boot Camp Assistant to install Window 10, the files contained in the Widnow 10 ISO files are copied to the same volume as the Boot Camp Windows Support Software downloaded from the internet. So when GUI Windows installer executes, the needed files (such as drivers) are extracted from Boot Camp Windows Support Software. There is no indication to the user that this happens. Also, when Windows finishes installing, the Setup.exe application included with the Boot Camp Windows Support Software executes. This is what users do see.\n\nNote: If the version of Window is sufficiently newer than the model Mac, then most likely the needed software will already be include with Windows. This is only a problem when the Mac is new enough that the needed software in only exists in the Boot Camp Windows Support Software.\n\nYou may want to try a normal install of Windows 10 to the external drive instead of a Windows To Go.\n", "Q: Can not erase my Mac OS X base system My Mac won’t boot up it makes the noise but just has a grey screen.

When the device is connected and the serial port is configured to use 115200-8-N-1, I have no problem using minicom, screen, etc. to communicate with my device. However, when I configure the device to use 1.5Mbaud instead, Darwin refuses to operate the interface at 1.5Mbaud. I tested the device on Debian using minicom at 1500000-8-N-1 to confirm that the device is operating correctly.\nFirst, it appears that stty does not allow the user to set the baud rate to 1.5Mbaud.\nstty -f /dev/tty.usbmodemXXXX 115200\n\nSucceeds, while\nstty -f /dev/tty.usbmodemXXXX 1500000\n\nFails with stty: tcsetattr: Invalid argument and nothing more. I have seen this question, but I don't seem to be having this issue, and trying all of the answers provided only causes stty to hang without successfully changing the baud rate.\nIt gets better. When I run minicom, which supposedly initializes the interface to use 1500000-8-N-1 (the configuration in my .minirc.dfl), I have confirmed from the device side that the interface is not running at 1.5Mbaud, but at some baud rate that's much lower instead (haven't confirmed what the exact speed is).\nI'm really stuck on this one. The strange behavior seems to suggest a driver problem, and I've heard that Apple's com.apple.driver.usb.cdc.acm driver is still not fully-featured. Might this be the issue? Thanks for your help!\n\nA: It is a driver problem. The com.apple.driver.usb.cdc.acm driver actually instantiates an IOSerialBSDClient for the device, as seen in the output from ioreg:\n+-o IOUSBHostInterface@1  <class IORegistryEntry:IOService:IOUSBNub:IOUSBInterface, id 0x100007a62, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (208 ms), retain 7>\n  +-o AppleUSBACMData  <class IORegistryEntry:IOService:IOSerialStreamSync:IORS232SerialStreamSync:AppleUSBSerial:AppleUSBACMData, id 0x100007a6c, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (1 ms), retain 6>\n    +-o IOSerialBSDClient  <class IORegistryEntry:IOService:IOSerialBSDClient, id 0x100007a72, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (0 ms), retain 5>\n\nWhich is very limited in the number of baud rates that it supports. Version 11 of the IOSerialFamily, the version on my machine, only supports the baud rates listed in the static struct speedtab iossspeeds[] in the IOSerialBSDClient class source. I tested this by successfully setting the baud rate for the interface to 1843200.\nThe solution, unfortunately, will probably require me to locate a generic driver that supports the baud rate I require.\n", "Q: How can I download and install macOS 10.12 SDK? I need to download the macOS 10.12 SDK to build and run ispwDownloader (because there were no built downloads).\nHow can I download and install the SDK?

Tech guys told me the problem was with the power controller board (because of the constant overheating) and that they had fixed it. However, the cooling system (the radiator itself) was failing (probably out of gas inside due to them) and needed to be replaced. They failed to find a replacement part (since the laptop is old) and recommended me to restrain from overloading the system in the meantime. \nThe laptop is now running smoothly. I'm measuring the CPU temperature with Macs Fan Control and it is showing 103 Celcius degrees on the CPU cores under the heaviest load possible (which according to the tech guys is a way too high).

The 12.2 update has broken my WiFi When I updated my iPhone 8 to 12.2 (16E227), it broke the WiFi and now apps like YouTube can't connect and often times I can't even load apple.com in Safari. When I restart the phone then it works for about a minute. When I turn airplane mode on and off, it works for about a minute.\nHowever my iPad with iOS 9.3.5 works flawlessly. My Samsung laptop works flawlessly. Also when I turn WiFi off on my iPhone and use cell data, it also works.\n\nA: Basically, you can't.\nApple stop signing previous versions shortly after a new one comes out. iOS 12.1.4 is no longer signed since April 4.\nRef: MacRumors - Apple Stops Signing iOS 12.1.4 Following Release of iOS 12.2\nI would look elsewhere for your solution, because had it been a widespread issue it would be well reported by now.\n", "Q: FFFFFFFF problem with hybrid partitioned drive, not able to fix with the guide in other topics Like many other uses who reported the same problem, I tried to install and delete Ubuntu in my 13' mid-2014 MBP, messed up and got FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFF partition, tried to follow the solutions in other topics, especially this one OS volume shows as type 'FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF' [duplicate]\nEDIT1: I had macOS Mojave and APFS.\nUnfortunately was not able to fix the issue.

If so, you can just edit and correct it there.\nIf not, then it is probably stored in the address history. You can open this from the Window->Previous Recipients menu. You can search for the address in the dialog and delete it.

I myself own and use BT headphones and I rarely connect them to my MacBook Pro laptop. Fortunately, my headphones remember the device I last connected them to, and will auto-reconnect to that device when they power up, but only if that device is available. \nHowever, this auto-reconnect will only happen if the device (iPad, iPhone, etc) has already been paired with the headphones. So, one way to keep your headphones from pairing with your laptop is to remove the pairing record for it. This is done via the \"Bluetooth\" preferences panel. Just select the pairing entry for your headphones and remove it by clicking on the \"X\" button after selecting the right entry.\n\nThe only downside to this is that you need to re-pair your headphones each time you want to use them with your laptop.\n", "Q: make dictionary result white text in spotlight in mojave dark theme \nI can't read the result.

It now is not making noise, it is silent with the orange light flashing but nothing happening. \nPlease help!\n\nA: Spinning disk drives fail, and its clicking-then-silence and invisibility to the host computers both indicate that this one has given up the ghost. \nExpensive disk-repair software such as DiskWarrior might be able to repair it, or to retrieve the data.

I am trying to save photos to Photo Library from my app. While saving I am checking whether user has given permission to do so, otherwise I am asking the user to go to Settings and turn on the permission. Only if the permission has been given only, I am saving the photos. For this I am using PHPhotLibray's requestAuthorization() method and NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription key in my app's Info.plist.\nBecause of these checks that I do in my app, there is no chance of crash even if I don't add NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription key in app's Info.plist. \nBut my concern is whether it will be rejected during the App Store Review?\n\nA: The Apple Developer documentation for NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription key says:\n\nDiscussion\nImportant\nThis key is required if your app uses APIs that have write access to the user’s photo library.\n\nSo, yes, it's possible that for the app to get rejected in the absence of the key. If the app happen to crash during the review process due to the absence of the key (or for some reason we don't know how the SDK works internally), it may get rejected.\nPer, this answer on Stack Overflow:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46681344/what-is-the-crash-of-the-apps-info-plist-must-contain-an-nsphotolibraryaddusag\nFrom the question:\n\nThis app has crashed because it attempted to access privacy-sensitive data without a usage description. The app's Info.plist must contain an NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription key with a string value explaining to the user how the app uses this data.\n\nFrom the answer:\n\nObviously, to solve this crash you have to add the NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription into the application's plist file:\n<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Our application needs permission to write photos...</string>\n\nAs property list view:\n\n\n\nNote: It's better to adhere to Apple's guidelines and include the key in your app's Info.plist. There's no harm/performance penalty by adding the key. In-fact with the key added, there's one less reason for your app to get rejected.\n", "Q: Using wildcards in Find and Replace (Mac OS app) I'm using an app called Scapple which (I think) accesses the built in Find and Replace of Mac OS.\nIt's a mind map app into which I'm pasting dozens and dozens of paragraphs from Kindle books.

Book Title (Kindle Locations 637-639).\n  Publishing House. Kindle Edition.\n\nI want to get rid of these, and deleting them one at a time is getting laborious.

There is no way for Safari to actually save a password, it hands it off to the keychain.\nSo any time Safari (or Mail.app, Finder, etc.) offers to save a password it is being saved in the keychain.\nyou can verify this by signing on to a new website with a username and password, letting Safari prompt you to save the password and then opening Keychain.app and seeing the new username/password saved there with a date/time stamp of only minutes ago.\n", "Q: Siri spells my child’s name wrong in texts Siri spells my child’s name wrong in texts. I tried all the suggestions given on here and it didn’t work. Added the field ‘phonetic spelling’ and spelled it the way Siri is spelling it. Then added the field “nickname”. When neither of those worked, I tried putting quotes around the correct spelling of the name. None of these worked. I just got an Xr. I even tapped on ‘tap to edit’and changed it but that didn’t work either.\n\nA: If a person is a contact and Siri doesn’t pronounce it correctly, you can ask Siri to show you their contact. After  she shows it to you, you can say “that’s not how you say that”, and Siri should ask you how to pronounce it.\n", "Q: How do I move a music collection Sorry for what must be a very simple question but how would I move all the tunes I have on my laptop to an external drive connected to the laptop.  Storage has become an issue and the laptop is quickly running out of space so I want to put all my tunes on an external and free up some space.  This would not be for a backup but to free up space.\n\nA: This is pretty straighforward, the steps are essentially:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes and consolidate your existing library (File > Library > Organise Library)\n\n*Quit iTunes\n\n*Copy your ~/Music/iTunes folder to the external drive\n\n*Open iTunes while holding down the Alt key, which will prompt you to select the new library\n\n*When you're sure it's working, delete your original library.\n\n\nFor more details on each step, see this iMore article.

I use two sim cards and when I swap them, I noticed that the balance gets lower, every single time.\nThis looked fishy, so I contacted telecommunications company, and they sent me the last 5 deals and I discovered that they all were messages sent from the phone to an international number 447786205094, and I checked it many times, and every time I swapped the sim card the phone always sent a message to the previous number.\nI made sure that iMessage and Facetime are disabled.\nWhat is happening here?\n\nA: This is one of the phone numbers used by iOS for Apple to activate a new SIM card. iOS chooses a number within the same region as the device to avoid international charges. In this case, the number is a UK number, so if you are not in the UK double-check the region of your device and SIM card.\nCarriers should not charge for this message, but if you have been charged, contact the carrier and ask that they resolve the situation. A warning is displayed the very first time activation is performed, warning that ‘your carrier may charge for SMS messages used to activate iMessage’.\n", "Q: Macbook Air 2013 causing Wifi Drop Odd problem.

It claims to have syntax highlighting for over 80 languages. If you want to program exclusively in Python, there is an app called Pythonista. This is more of an IDE than just a code editor.\n\nA: Apple has a curated list - Powerful Apps for Developers\nHere are my “go to” apps for my iPad Pro - I do use it to screen mirror to and from a MacBook and typically travel / work with both equally, there’s still where the macOS experience is so much more productive than iOS.\n\nThe only ones I would consider IDE are Coda, Pythonista and Playgrounds but working Copy and Drafts are amazingly productive for me.

OK, fine, not quite intuitive, but understandable. \nHowever, now I empty the Trash. \nThe message still remains in the Smart Folder. It still says \"Trash\" as location, yet the entire trash is empty (the IMAP trash folder as well as On My Mac trash folder).   \nNow I click to \"delete\" it (from within the Smart Folder by right clicking and choosing \"Delete\" from the context menu) and it disappears (it doesn't show up in the Trash either, thankfully, that would have been even more bizarre). \nAnyways.  Am I just not understanding how Smart Folders are work?  Or is there something wrong.\nAnd after emptying the trash, where exactly is the actual (physical) location of my message (for purposes of troubleshooting)? \n\nA: Your understanding is very correct and one of two things is the root of your confusion and the software not working dependably.\n\n\n*\n\n*Spotlight is the database where all files get indexed.

If you have fast internet and a modern Mac, boot to internet recovery and run Disk Utility to repair the boot drive.

From what I am understanding from the responses collectively is that determining which install disk came with my machine is going to be not as straightforward as I thought. Second regardless of what I choose to do I would need to start with Snow Leopard first and then work my way up. I was thinking the along the same lines as in I probably dont have the right disk. \nSince I posted this question I have been on the phone with Apple Support as Bmike had suggested for an unbelievable amount of time. The customer service rep was a nice guy I felt that he wanted to help but was ultimately not well versed with apple products from this time period. He told me that the disc I have isn't model specific and that any disc should work, he didnt seem to worried about weather it was the correct one. Also I gave him the serial number and despite this he could not tell me what specific disk I would need to boot, instead he focused on getting the machine to boot with the disc I had on hand. We tried every possible keyboard combination while booting, booting while connected to a network via ethernet, resetting the svram, nothing worked. He ultimately set me up with an appointment to an Authorized Service Center. I am not sure if I will go as I dont want to explain everything and spend time just so that the genius bar can conclude the same thing or worse tell me that this model is no longer supported (which is the most annoying statement) its like taking a 2009 Prius in for service and Toyota saying oh man sorry bro that model has been discontinued we only meant for you to buy our super expensive computer to use for 100k miles then we expect you to trash it and buy another one. \nI was lucky to find another drive from another MAC PRO that has the operating system on it and I plugged it into the computer in question and it booted just fine. So before I try and get my hands on Snow Leopard, I am going to attempt to clone the bootable drive and hope that the clone will boot without any issues. Problem is that the bootable drive is 2TB and I only have 250 GB drive as a target drive, so I plan to shrink the partition on the bootable drive and then clone it to the smaller drive that would have the same partition structure. I have never done this and I know its harder than I am making it seem, can anyone give me any tips or advice on how to do this correctly? I read somewhere that I might have to change the blocksize, true? I am planning on using Clonezilla. \nSorry I typed way too much.\nlink to new related question: I am trying to clone a 2TB drive that has mac os x 10.6.8 onto a smaller drive but dont know what I am doing\n\nA: According to everymac.com, your Mac is a 2006 model which was discontinued January 8, 2008. (I made the assumption 2.66QX means 2.66 GHz Quad Core Xeon) This model originally was designed to run OS X 10.4.7. Since the \nMac OS X v10.6.2 Update is dated Nov 9, 2009, I doubt the disc you have is the correct one for this model Mac.\nThe OS X 10.7.5 (Lion) was the last version designed for your Mac model. \n\nNote: Since this model has a 32 bit EFI, you can only run 32 bit EFI booting operation systems. However, you may be able to run 64 bit BIOS booting operating systems such as Windows and some versions of Linux.\n\nIf you were to purchase Lion from Apple, then a requirement to install would be to have Snow Leopard already installed. In other words, the DMG file only offers an upgrade to Lion. You probably can not use the DMG file to create a bootable installer. You can read the requirements from the Apple Lion website given in the above link.\nYou would not need a Apple ID to install Snow Leopard, but the installer will still ask. You can decline to give an Apple ID if you wish. Snow Leopard was released on a DL DVD. Apple still sells Snow Leopard DVDs, but you can also download an ISO from the internet. Instructions are given below for creating a Snow Leopard USB flash drive installer. If you chose to burn a DVD, then you will need a DL DVD, since the contents of the ISO is over 4.7 GB.\nOnce you have Snow Leopard installed, you should install all the available Snow Leopard updates. This would update Snow Leopard to OS X 10.6.8. From here, you could upgrade to Lion by using a purchased DMG file.\nCreating a USB Flash Drive Installer from a Snow Leopard ISO File.\nThis was done use an iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 with MacOS High Sierra 10.13.6 installed. The flash drive was testing using VirtualBox Version Version 5.2.26 r128414 (Qt5.6.3). The flash drive needs to be at least 8 GB in size.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Finder application to mount the Snow Leopard ISO file.\n\n*Use the Disk Utility application to erase the flash drive, as shown below. I chose the default name Untitled. Finally, click on the Erase button.\n\n\n*Highlight the name Untitled, then click on the Restore button on the top of the Disk Utility application window. In the popup window, select restore from Mac OS X Install DVD, as shown below. Finally, click on the Restore button in the popup window.\n\n\n*The flash drive was tested using Virtual Box. Other than selecting the flash drive, I used the default settings for a 64 bit Snow Leopard installation. After booting from the flash drive, you need to use the Disk Utility application to erase the internal drive before installing Snow Leopard. Basically, select the setting shown below, then click on the Erase... button.\n\n\n*The result is shown below. Make sure the partition map scheme is GUID Partition Table.\n\n\n*Return to the Mac OS Installer and choose to install to the Macintosh HD disk.\n\n\n*When the installer finishes you should get a Welcome window similar to what is shown below.\n\nThe result after answering all the questions is shown below. I selected About This Mac from the menu bar.\n\n\n*Software update includes OS X 10.6.8.\n\n\nA: I would guess 10.6.2 would be just fine to boot most MacPro with that model, so you might have a hardware issue or bad DVD.\nMore specifically, there are 8 models with A1186 - so you might need to try OS between 10.4 but most of them would work with 10.6.8 - so I’d start with any 10.6 media you can get your hands on if you can’t get a serial number or more precise handle on which hardware you have.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://everymac.com/ultimate-mac-lookup/?search_keywords=a1186\nEven easier would be to get an external drive with 10.6.8 installed on it from hardware where the drive isn’t possibly broken and then hold the option key to get this mac to boot to an external drive rather than fussing with the optical drive and uncertainty on which media would boot this without an OS.\nFrom there, you could get at the serial number or details on the exact model you have.\nApple will ship you the exact media you need (at a cost) so worst case, you can go that route with Apple Support if you’re unable to resolve this here or on the internet in general.\n", "Q: Deleted an APFS Volume, but it still shows as \"Other Volumes\" claimed space within the container I have an older MacBook Pro running OS X 10.13.6, the last version supported on the hardware. It has an SSD which was upgraded to APFS a while ago. A few months back, unfixable filesystem corruption developed (APFS - sigh). The total amount of used space on the filesystem was less than half the size of the drive capacity, so I decided to \"fix\" the corruption by using Disk Utility to create a new Volume within the SSD Container and copied the boot volume to this with Carbon Copy Cloner.\nThe new Volume approach worked. After a few months I decided I was satisfied that it was all working as expected and I didn't need the old Volume, so went to Disk Utility, selected the old Volume (at that point named \"Old Mac HD\") and used the \"remove\" button in the toolbar. This did get rid of the named Volume, but not the space it consumed.

Your APFS container doesn’t show a volume that the GUI does, so I would primarily make sure you are backed up.\nIt could be a bug, so a reinstall of the OS or waiting for Apple to release and applying updates are your only path forward. It’s not super concerning, since you have a lot of room to grow and I’m presuming you have a valid backup of all the data.\nThis would be concerning if you can’t keep things backed up or don’t have a backup.\nIf it were me, I’d want to know if an erase fixes it, but your call when you do that or if you want to play the waiting game assuming there is a display bug instead of actual corruption that didn’t get resolved.\n", "Q: How can I automate mouse clicks and keyboard input with Automator in Mac Mojave? If I position my mouse cursor at a certain point on the screen, is it possible to use the Automator or AppleScript to \"click\" the mouse, enter a keyboard shortcut (say, command-5), press the return key, and then repeat those three things n times?\n\nA: This code requires the third-party utility, Cliclick.\n\n“Cliclick” is short for “Command-Line Interface Click”. It is a a tiny shell/Terminal application that will emulate mouse clicks or series of mouse clicks (including doubleclicks and control-clicks) at arbitrary screen coordinates. Moreover, it lets you move the mouse, get the current mouse coordinates, press modifier keys etc.\n\nIt's free to download but it's donationware, and is easy to install.\nOn my system I have. cliclick in the following directory: /usr/local/bin/. Because of this location, in my AppleScript code and in Terminal app, I need to use the full path to cliclick to call the command. For example: do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/cliclick c:.\" In AppleScript it's telling cliclick to click at current mouse location.\nThis AppleScript code works for me using the latest version of macOS Mojave.\nrepeat 3 times -- Enter Your Desired Loop Count\n    -- Clicks At Current Mouse Location\n    do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/cliclick  c:.\"\n\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        delay 0.2 -- Adjust Value If Necessary\n        keystroke 5 using {command down}\n        delay 0.2 -- Adjust Value If Necessary\n        keystroke return\n    end tell\nend repeat\n\n\nA: Yes, you can use Automator -> Utilities -> Watch Me Do and record mouse and keyboard actions and then add an Automator -> Utilities -> Loop and configure it to loop however many times you like.\n", "Q: iPhone Xr: Ringer volume sound loud for the first second then goes real quiet?

The last disk does not work, as it is damaged. So what can I do?\nI tried install on TransMac.\n\nA: According to everyman.com, you mac appears to be a mid/late 2007 model.\nThe Pre-Installed operating system was OS X 10.4.9 (8Q1058) (Tiger). The Maximum operating system is OS X 10.11.6 (El Capitan).\nIf you are using TransMac, I assume you have a DMG file. You can use DMG files to upgrade OS X, but you can not use a DMG file to do an clean install of OS X. For example, if you purchase Lion from Apple, then you must first have Snow Leopard installed in order to use the purchased file to upgrade to Lion.\nApple still sells Snow Leopard DVDs, but you can also download an ISO from the internet. There are plenty of websites that explain how to make a bootable USB Snow Leopard installer. I have not tried any of these methods. If you succeed, then maybe you could post a method that works.\n\nI would recommend burning the Snow Leopard ISO file to a DL DVD.\n\nOnce you have Snow Leopard installed, you should install all the available Snow Leopard updates. This would update Snow Leopard to OS X 10.6.8. \nOnce Snow Leopard OS X 10.6.8 is installed, you can upgrade to El Capitan for free.\nEnter this address: https://itunes.apple.com/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1147835434?mt=12 into Safari on the Mac running Snow Leopard. You should be able to download El Capitan. Follow the instructions at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372 to create a bootable USB El Capitan installer.\nPlease post of comment, if you needed an Apple Id to download El Capitan.\n", "Q: Can iOS apps upload camera roll pictures automatically So today I opened Facebook iOS application and I click photo tools option in your photos menu. I was shocked to find out that Facebook application had loaded my private camera roll picture there ready for posting and it was just missing post content with ready to share. So am wondering is that flaw in iOS or what I mean like that every app can secretly read your camera roll picture and will be uploading to their servers right. After that I went to settings of my iPhone there in privacy section I looked for Facebook and photos where permission was read and write , so just wondering tomorrow some another app will ask for profile picture upload and it will ask for permission you give it and forget to disable permission again that mean this app have got access to your camera roll by tricking you by asking to upload profile picture knowing that a lot of lazy pictures will not revoke this permission from settings manually. \nI think Apple should limit this and should never ever give full time read write permission to apps. Apps should be allowed to read picture which use select in camera roll and app permission should be revoked automatically every time use finish up selecting picture from its camera roll , because this is privacy issue that these Facebook and instagram like applications ready pictures from your camera roll and displaying in front of you without your permission one mistaken click would share them to internet and also no body knows that they are not uploading it to their servers. I mean their are tons of apps on App Store apple can’t check their apps code that what it’s doing in background. \n\nA: In the iOS settings app - privacy - disable photo permissions for the apps you don’t trust. \nThen add those apps as receivers when you use the photos app to push only selected photos. \nOr delete the apps from your iOS devices and only use web versions or eschew them entirely. \n", "Q: Is compressed air effective to clean a 2018 MacBook Pro keyboard which displays repeated keypresses? My 2018, 15\" MacBook Pro is starting to display the dreaded keyboard defects. Specifically, the A key started to register double keypresses. Initially this was very infrequent, but it appears to be getting worse. I would estimate that, in the last few minutes, about 5-10% of the time, a repeat keypress is happening.\nAlthough I could take the computer to an authorized repair shop as it's still under warranty (and I bought AppleCare for it), I know the turnaround time is fairly long, and this is the only computer I can realistically use without immensely disrupting my workflow. Also, there is no Apple Store within 500 Km of my location. Therefore, I set out to look for DIY fixes.\nI found this support document on Apple's site recommending the use of compressed air as a possible fix to the issue. I have an oil-free air compressor that I could use to apply compressed air to the keyboard.\nHowever, I'm somewhat afraid of doing this. Although this is an Apple recommended procedure, I can't help but think this is aggressive procedure applied to a very delicate mechanism. In particular, I'm afraid my compressed air source may have a small rate of dust contamination which may actually worsen the problem. Has anyone actually used this procedure on a 2018 MacBook Pro keyboard, with the new silicone membrane, to see whether this recommendation is actually effective? I intend to postpone doing this until I see a success report.\n\nA: The 'Butterfly' keyboard Apple uses is known to be faulty and many users experience problems with it. A quick google search for 'Butterfly Keyboard Problems' will show you the scale of this issue. The solution you found may work, but I would strongly suggest taking it back to Apple, since its still under warranty it should be free and it will likely prolong the lifespan of your Macbook. \n", "Q: I am trying to clone a 2TB drive that has mac os x 10.6.8 onto a smaller drive but dont know what I am doing I have a Mac Pro that I cant install an OS onto at the moment because I do not have snow leopard. I do have a bootable 2TB Western Digital drive that comes from an identical Mac Pro that has 10.6.8 loaded onto it. I have tested this drive onto the computer in question and it boots ok. I only have a 250 GB drive to use as a target disk. The 2TB drive has only about 65GB used space. When I try to shrink the partition via Gparted, a caution exclamation point w an orange box appears that says it can not read the contents of this drive while terminal indicates that gparted only supports 512 byte length sectors and the journaled drive is not 512 byte length. When I mount the drive, the exclamation point goes away but mounting it doesnt allow me to shrink the partition. \n\nlink to my previous related question: Mac Pro install disk keeps ejecting itself\n\nA: Assuming your info is correct & there is going to be room on the 250, this should be simple in a Pro.\n\n\n*\n\n*Put both drives in the Mac Pro.\n\n*Boot from the one that works.\n\n*Format the other [just to be certain] in Disk Utility as a single volume, GUID/HFS+ [Don't name it exactly as the other, to save confusion]\n\n*Get Carbon Copy Cloner*.

I would like to limit kernel_task's CPU usage on my computer. I provided cooling for my MacBook Pro, cleaned out the internals, and tried resetting the SMC multiple times. I haven't tried re-installing macOS 10.12 yet, but do that every once in a while.\nkernel_task's CPU usage often makes my laptop unusable, and the only fix for this is to leave my computer wait until my mouse can move smoothly.\nIs there any way to limit kernel_tasks CPU usage during/for spikes?\nI have a mid-2012 MacBook Pro (model w/ superdrive), 16gb ram, 1tb+500gb drives\n\nA: Kernel_task is not just one process, but a representation of all the kernel's input and output. High k_t usage can be a symptom of problems, rather than a cause in itself that needs to be corrected.\nCauses could include third-party kexts, Spotlight indexing, or other background processes. One of its functions is to use up CPU as a means of restricting other processes, in order to prevent overheating.\nI had that model of MBP and did not observe it becoming 'unusable' ever, so it may be some issue relating to your installed software or preferences.\nThere is little need or benefit to re-installing the OS on a regular basis.\n\nA: You cannot limit kernel_task since it is the enforcer of all tasks and does the limiting and scheduling of other tasks that run.\nTo reiterate, kernel_task only does two things when it’s showing high CPU allocation:\n\n\n*\n\n*When the CPU measures too hot temperatures, it throttles things. It’s not busy, it’s just putting one or more portions of the processor in time out until it cools to the programmed thermal envelope.\n\n*It does work that other programs request of the system.\n\n\nYou mention you already are addressing cooling, so you can now look at quitting whatever other apps are tasking the kernel so that you get back to idle. Are you able to know what other programs run right before the kernel is busy?\nHopefully it’s other programs demanding kernel services and not that your CPU has a bad temperature sensor or just runs hot and is about to need to be replaced. It’s very unlikely, but chips can fail in ways that manifest as an inability to do the normal workload.\n", "Q: How to Start Postgres Service in MacOs?

I've recently been building a large photo library, and, now that almost all of the content is in, I would like to start completing the people album. Photos says that it will \"continue to scan your remaining photos when you're not using the app and your Mac is connected to power\", so what I've been doing is letting the app run in the background (opening it and the focusing to another Window), telling my Mac never to sleep, plugging it in and leaving it on overnight.\nThis, however, does not seem to be working; indeed, the number of faces scanned seems to be going DOWN (yesterday 57,807 photos had been scanned and now it's just 57,381). I seem to be meeting perfect conditions and yet nothing's happening. I should perhaps mention, however, that I've been getting it a little off each time, but not in a way that should affect it, I hope.\n\n\n*\n\n*The first two nights I quit photos \n\n*The third night I left Photos focused.\n\n*And tonight I left Mission Control focused \n\n\nThe third night I left Photos\n   focused and tonight I left Mission Control running.\nWhat is causing this problem, and what am I doing wrong?\nIf it helps, here are my system specs:\n\n\n\nA: Apparently because the library is on an external drive there's a bug that's causing this to happen. I'll keep everyone posted for when there is a fix!\n\nA: The conditions are unclear at this time.\n\nApple does not inform on how photoanalysisd or photolibraryd work. It is something they need to address properly. As far as I know, photoanalysis uses CoreML and Vision to analyse what images contain, not only Faces in People. So if you search for mountain, it should retrieve images of mountains.\n\nWhen it comes to how this daemon actually work, I've looked at the process and how it responds to different changes in the macOS environment. From a bit of trial, \nI think I've figured out how to make it work in a somewhat expectable way. To summarise, the following technique (if you will) should help you crawl about 1K images an hour. \n\nNote: this depends on the hardware you are currently running on. You milage may vary.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have photos imported into Photos.app\n\n*Have manually marked faces of people you want Photos to recognise.\n\n*Make sure you do not have any items in your library that can cause havoc. You can use Smart Filters with Unable to Upload.\n\n*Ensure that your power settings are set to never sleep. (Screen saver can still be on).\n\n*Plug your Mac to power, it will be running for a while depending on your collection size.\n\n\nSolution:\nClose all apps, reboot your Mac, make sure you untick the \"Reopen windows...\" before you reboot. We want macOS to return to desktop without any apps loading. \nAlso make sure you have disabled any apps from starting with macOS too: Users & Groups > Your User > Login Items\nThen, once rebooted:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Activity Monitor.app and search for photoanalysisd. It should not be found (but leave the window open). \n\n*Open Photos.app, wait a minute, then close it. You should see photolibraryd and photoanalysisd in Activity Monitor.app now. \n\n*Give it a minute or two (or maybe 10), and now you should see photoanalysisd begin to churn through your photos rather quickly.\n\n\nFor the best possible result, make sure you leave the Mac running over night. If you have a lot of images (50000+) you probably need to do this a couple of nights.\n\nA few things to consider. \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The daemon can take some time to get it going. When I open Safari it starts churning. You can try this if you don't see any activity after 10 minutes.\n  \n*photoanalysisd can hang up some times. If this happens, check if photolibraryd is doing something (check Activity Monitor.app). If this is the case, It is probably pushing updates to the library.\n  \n*It can sometimes help if you leave your iPhone/iPad unplugged. It seems that Photos only work on a single device at one time. \n  \n*If there is no activity for a while and you don't manage to solve it with the above. Reboot and repeat.\n  \n\nThe above has worked for me on 12K photos. I've re-imported them twice to confirm. It took me two days total (by making sure it starts and leave it over night).\nEnjoy.\n\nA: Firstly, you should completely Quit photos. The scanning service will run in the background even if the app is closed.\nSecondly, when you go to the People tab, is there a button to see the (incomplete) People album? This might give you better insight into its progress.\n\nA: For me, the answer seems to be to ensure that photos is not running on any other device. That meant I need to close photos on my iPad and iPhones (for extra safety, I powered them off but I don't think that was necessary). On my AppleTV I signed out of my iCloud account. After doing this, Activity Monitor showed that photoanalysisd began using significant CPU time (until this its CPU time was insignificant). I'm posting this in real-time. I hope the update finally finishes now - I've got 15k photos and 300+ people, running Catalina on a 2019 MacBook Pro 13\".\n\nA: @Elmo's answer solves problem for me (250k photos in library). One thing that helps is to do all of those steps with your Mac disconnected from the Internet. This means you don't have to go around turning off Photos on iPhones, iPads, Mac Minis, iMacs and all the other stuff that might be connected to your cloud. It also has the advantage that all the other Internet activity that uses up CPU time stops. \nI'm using a Mac Pro (2013) with 2Tb OWC SSD upgrade for my Photos library. photoanalysisd getting to use 150%+ of CPU(s, writing about 1Gb/hr to disk and doing about 4300 photos per hour.   \n\nA: I found that photoanalysisd was using 0% CPU and 0 CPU time in Activity Monitor and nothing was happening..  However, I selected that line in Activity Monitor, and clicked the Cog Wheel icon. I picked SAMPLE PROCESS.  It ran a sample of the Photoanslysisd process and that caused it to kickoff.\nIt is running and now I also see activity in Photolibraryd.  I assume it is updating as it finds things.\n\nA: Initial stage\nMac Photos had 0 recognized faces, iPhone Photos had a few. For over a year. Both synching to iCloud.\n\"Fix\"\nOn my Mac I have disabled iCloud synch on my Mac via Preferences => iCloud, waited a while for the local image cache to be deleted and re-enabled iCloud synch.\nThen I had to follow @elmo's answer and let Photos on Mac reprocess the entire library, but I had to leave Photos app on this time.\nThe results\nBoth Mac Photos and iPhone Photos have begun reprocessing the entire library and ran facial recognition on all the images.\nHowever, Apple being Apple, the people tags are not shared between devices. You have to do the entire process of fixing recognitions and manually tagging people on each device separately.\nThe setup\n\n*\n\n*MBP 2019 i9, running Monteray 12.6.\n\n*iPhone XR, runniung iOS 16.0.\n\n", "Q: Restoring data deleted from Directory Utility When trying to rearrange user accounts, I deleted some data using the Directory Utility (data on a user account under \"Users\" in the Node \"Local/Default\").\nI would like to restore this data.\nI have a Time Machine Backup available from before the change.

Which seems quite decent considering that laptop batteries are expected to last 2 to 4 years, according to a quick Google search.\nIn other words, you are probably doing everything right.\nAs mentioned before, heat (and cold) is an issue. However, leaving it plugged in during work should not be a problem, as cycles add more to battery loss than leaving it at high charge. So the rule about 20% to 80% is more useful for storage than for an actively used Mac, as it will add cycles to always move between the two values. Reconditioning a battery also adds cycles, usually without any advantages. Do that only if the battery has serious issues. When you don't work, keep it unplugged, but make sure you reload it before it gets below 20%, and only up to 60% if you don't intend to use it for a longer time.\n\nA: Heat kills batteries. It’s not a good idea to keep a battery on the charger constantly, nor should you keep it almost dead. For the best battery life, keep it between 20 and 80%. Try a utility like “FruitJuice” which will also help recondition your battery.\n", "Q: Why does my Photos library differ in size looking in Finder vs in the \"Get Info\" of Photos? Hopefully I am under-thinking this issue. I've been going through my Photos library, deleting duplicates and lame pictures. When I went to look at the total library size, I got a different calculation in the Photos app compared to Finder. Photos says the library size is 603GB and Finder says it is 665GB. What is taking the extra 60GB? Is there something I'm missing here? Thank you for your help!\n\n\nA: I assume Photos is reporting the total size of all the pictures (and just the pictures). This is sort of confirmed by selecting all the photos in the library and then using Get Info: this shows the same size as selecting the library. \nFinder is showing the actual size of the library file on disk. This file contains all the photos but also a lot of other \"meta\" information about the photos, albums, places, faces, etc. that allows Photos to manage and display the pictures.\n\nA: The photo library file on disk is actually a directory and you can descend into the directory.  Finder normally wont do this because it knows it is a special directory (you can right-click on it and pick 'Show Package Contents').\nA better way to get more detailed info is to open the Terminal utility and use the command line:\ncd ~/Pictures/GKJones\\ Fam\\ Library.photoslibrary\n(or just type enough characters to be unique then hit the tab key to auto-complete)\nThen use the du utility (display usage) to get a summary for each folder.  I'd probably use the \"depth\" option (-d flag) and set the depth to 1 (only summarize to 1 sub-directory deep ... otherwise you'll get a very long output).  Use the -h flag to put the values in human-readable format (the default is to display the usage as the number of blocks occupied)\ndu -hd 1\nThis will give you a list of all the sub-folders with the usage of each folder.\nIf you hold both [cmd] + [opt] while clicking the Photos icon to launch the app it will  offer to repair the library.  This takes a some time to complete depending on the size of your photo library.\n", "Q: How can I record the screen and the rear camera on an iPhone simultaneously? I've seen many apps that can record the iPhone screen and the front camera (facecam) into a single video. It embeds the facecam into a corner of the iPhone screen recording.\nI want an app to record the rear camera and combine the video/overlay the video with the screen recording.\nBasically I want to make a video showing how a WiFi light bulb reacts when using the iPhone app (screen controls).\nSo as I record the screen of the iPhone showing the changing the settings of the bulb on the app, I want to use the rear camera to simultaneously record and embed into the screen recording what's happening with the bulb in real time.\nThe key here is the rear camera, there are software which use the front camera (facecam) and screen recording at the same time but I can't find any app (or a way) to use the rear camera and the screen recording at the same time.\nIs this something apps can do on the iPhone with iOS?\n\nA: In the absence of an app that allows overlaying screen recording and a rear camera recording simultaneously (odd why the app makers didn't provide an option to select the rear camera instead of just the front facing camera), here is a workaround I found.\n\n\n*\n\n*Record the screen recording using the iOS screen recorder\n\n*Record the rear camera video using the iOS camera app\n\n*Download iMovie from the App Store and overlay the two recordings together (split, picture in picture etc).\n\n\nHere is a video tutorial I found on YouTube which explains how to combine/overlay two recordings/videos using iMovie on iOS.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_qx75zTjr0\nI'm not marking this as the answer as this is not my ideal scenario, it would have been nice to have an app do it, but it's a workaround for now.\n\nA: Assuming this isn’t possible, you’ll need to mount two phones side by side or atop each other on a stand and record video from one, screen on the other and combine the streams in post-production.\nI’ve seen this done many times for marketing / training videos. My hunch is the hardware is capable of this resource wise, but the API isn’t out to do it yet from Apple for apps to ship.\nThe virtual reality overlays might be how you would need to make this sort of app so that the camera is shown on the screen as you tap and operate controls.\n", "Q: iOS Clips app: What is the difference between Save Video and Save to files on iPad?

One column is date/time info, formatted like so:\n21.05.2018 12:00\n\nThis is the correct date format in the country I am in.  My Mac knows this, so I assume Numbers ought to.\nI need to get rid of the time from this col.  You'd think that would be pretty simple.  I select the cells in that col (not including the header, in case that single plain text cell confuses things), then click Format, then Cell, then under Data Format I choose Date & Time.  No matter what Date or Time option I choose ... absolutely nothing happens.  My selected column of dates does not change - the displayed text is in exactly the same format as it started as, as shown above.\nI know there isn't, but it is as if there is an \"Apply\" button I am missing, so my chosen settings aren't actually applied.  If I click another cell in the sheet, then back to one of the ones I just tried to format, the Data Format has gone back to Automatic, not whatever I just chose.\nSearching for help turns up the official Apple guide which, AFAICT, tells me to do exactly what I am doing.\nI also found this old question and answer right here on Stackexchange which seems again to be exactly what I am doing - though the answer suggests that typing in new dates will result in them being formatted as required.  Maybe I can't reformat existing dates in the sheet?  That makes no sense!\nWhat am I missing?\nEdit\nI tried adding a new col and using a formula to generate a date without the time:\nYEAR($A2)−MONTH($A2)−DAY($A2)\n\nBut it just shows an error:\n\nThe function “YEAR” expects a date, but cell A2 contains a string.\n\n\nA: I suspect your date is simply not in a format Numbers natively recognizes. To test this failure-mode and see the same symptom, try typing in something else it may not recognize, like 999999999999, and set it to a date format. Again, it doesn't change, because Numbers doesn't want to assume how to parse it, and risk outputting incorrect values.\nA solution is to pre-parse the input by field. Here's a demo using MID to extract the year, month, and date fields by their position in the string, and hand them off to the DATE function.\n=DATE(MID($A2,7,4),MID($A2,4,2),MID($A2,1,2))\n\n\n\nA: Add a formula replacing $A2 with the cell you wish to use.\nDATEVALUE(MID($A2,1,10)) + TIMEVALUE(MID(A2,12,5))\n\n", "Q: Using external NTFS drive from windows on mac with bootcamp I am new to StackExchange so please pardon, if my request does not follow all best practices. \nMy dad uses Windows 10 on a MacBook pro 2015 via Bootcamp.

Out of my total 121GB, 47GB are iCloud Drive and 22GB are music creation.\nMy question is whether my music creation files, many of which are stored in iCloud, are taking up space twice? My music creation storage consists of 19GB of Logic Pro projects (7GB on disk) and 16GB of Audacity projects (at least I believe the Audacity projects register as music creation). Beyond the music creation files I don't really have many files on here, so I'm having a hard time understanding where 47GB of iCloud Drive files are coming from. Is some of that space being taken up by duplicates of my music creation files?\n\nA: If you go to Sytem Preferences/iCloud you'll see an option button as shown below.\n\nClick on the options button and you'll get a new pane. At the bottom of this pane is a checkbox to optimize Mac storage. See the figure below.\n\nThis option can effect the free space on your hard drive. read the description next to the checkbox to determine which setting you want.\n\nA: I presume you're looking at the page displayed when you go to Apple menu->About this Mac->Storage->Manage...\nThe number shown as \"iCloud Drive\" is the amount of space that duplicates what you have stored in iCloud. This is a very confusing number since macOS controls how much of your iCloud data is retained on your local disk. macOS will keep local copies of files you frequently access in a \"cache\"; this allows you to access them quickly without waiting for them to be downloaded. If your disk begins to get full, it will silently remove files from the cache, which is okay because you already have them in iCloud.\nI hate saying things like this, but consider it to be behind-the-scenes magic. \nMost likely you have a \"cache\" copy of most of your iCloud on your local disk, but the OS will manage it for you. It's unfortunate that (a) Apple doesn't allow much control of what gets cached and (b) some applications hide what's cached while others show it.\nOnce you've enabled iCloud Drive, it becomes difficult to tell how much free space you actually have. You may even get a warning that you're almost out of space, only to come back an hour later and find that hundreds of megabytes have suddenly become available...because the cache was pruned and/or files were pushed into your iCloud storage.\n", "Q: Dynamic XFA PDF forms on a Mac and Safari I am using Mac OS 10.13.6.

Now I am 100% certain the Find my iPhone option was turned on on my iPhone, but will the \"Lost Mode\" be of any help if it was not turned on on the iPhone? Would it be showing \"Offline\" if I did not turn on the option?\n\nA: A casual thief would eventually need to bring the phone to an Apple Store or at least power it on, at which point you would be notified. Professional thieves will scrap the phone...reselling the parts that can't be identified and may never turn the phone on again.\nIf your phone is turned on again, the moment it makes contact with the Internet and pings Apple's servers, it will enter \"Lost mode.\"\nIf your phone were not registered with iCloud/Find my iPhone, it wouldn't show up at all.

I'd start with adding additional -v's to your ssh command to get additional logging from your SSH client.\n$ ssh -vv   ...\n$ ssh -vvv  ...\n$ ssh -vvvv ...\n\nThis will return more and more logging from ssh as you add them. The message you're receiving indicates that the server (the peer) is resetting the connection from your ssh client.\nThis can happen for a variety of reasons one of which is the host is unable to establish (fork) an SSH daemon for your client to connect to. I would suggest rebooting the RPi as a first level of debugging this.\nReference: ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host (not using hosts.deny)\nIt's very likely that this won't be your issue.

It was permanently resolved by replacing the LCD assembly at AASP as the warranty was active - it did essentially qualify for DOA (wtf? - still do not know the possible answer to that)\nWorkaround was to get the system in the target mode (T at startup and connect with a Thunderbolt cable to some other Mac) and install the MacOS from a good source.\nASD may help to point the finger to the dead part in need of replacement.\n\nA: There is a very good possibility that if you had a external drive with a version of OS X (macOS) that is compatible with your Mac, then your Mac would boot from this external drive. The reason is that when the default operating system is not bootable, then the firmware will try to find an alternate operating system to boot. This would happen without you needing to hold down any keys.\nThis would require for you to have an external HDD or SSD and another Mac. You would use the other Mac to install the OS X (macOS) operating system onto the external drive.\nOnce you have booted from an external drive, you could proceed with installing a OS X (macOS) on the internal drive.\n", "Q: How to upgrade to latest macOS with a clean install?

I am not going to install and trust such third party software. All I need to do is download the full version of the installer. Surely Apple must provide this somehow, since their own command is referring me to their own documentation (which strangely doesn't tell me how to download the whole installer in a way that works!)\nHow do I get the full installer?\nNote: This may seem like a duplicate of this question which is marked as a duplicate of this question. But all of the answers for those question either don't work (lead me in a circle back to the App Store which downloads a tiny installer even after I delete it and try again) or refer me to a third piece of software that I'm not going to trust.\n\nA: To perform a clean install, try using Internet recovery.\n\n\n*\n\n*About macOS Recovery\n\nNewer Mac computers and some older Mac computers automatically try to start up from macOS Recovery over the Internet when unable to start up from the built-in recovery system. When that happens, you see a spinning globe instead of an Apple logo during startup. To manually start up from macOS Recovery over the Internet, press and hold Option-Command-R or Shift-Option-Command-R at startup. Learn more about these key combinations.\n\n", "Q: Oops!

I have larger hands and my fingers accidentally press buttons on the Touch Bar without me noticing all the time.\nI like the Touch Bar and I'd like to use it, but I can't seem to find anywhere that will allow me to enable a lock screen type feature on the Touch Bar.\nI'd really like to disable input unless explicitly enabled. How do I do that?\n\nA: Fully disabling it seems not to be possible, as some vital functions like the Escape key require it.\nWhat I found others doing was to put scotch tape over the touch bar. This makes it less sensitive up to completely unresponsive.\nIf you configure the touch bar to just show the control or function keys (whichever you prefer), and put some holes in the scotch tape before applying it, you can still press the keys and not do it accidentally.\nI also suggest to log a complaint with Apple that the touch bar is too sensitive and gets pressed accidentally, so their engineers get a reason to improve it in future models, so no scotch tape is needed.\n\nA: My Touch Bar was going cuckoo, and it would randomly press the buttons in it for no reason. Restarting the computer or killing the process did not solve the problem. While changing the Touch Bar options to \"Expanded Control Strip\" gave me the option to empty it, the 'esc' button was still there, randomly being pressed and driving me insane.\nThe way I solved the issue was less gentle than some of the options suggested here (but I didn't want to download a new app to deal with the touch bar):\n\n*\n\n*Find the touch app process in the \"Activity Monitor\", in my case named \"Control Strip\".\n\n*Find its PID number (e.g. pidnum).\n\n*Open the terminal and type kill -STOP pidnum. This will suspend the touch bar, which will now become unresponsive. Alternatively, one can also use: killall -STOP \"ControlStrip\"\n\n*Since my 'esc' button is in the damn touch bar, I also changed my keyboard settings to use my 'caps lock' as 'esc' button. That is, System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys, and change accordingly.\n\nIf you need to turn the touch bar on again, you can always type kill -CONT pidnum.\nOne of the problems (potentially many) of my solution is that whenever you restart your computer, the touch bar will be enabled again. So you will need to kill -STOP the process again. You can always run a little script at the login that finds the PID number and runs the kill -STOP command. I haven't tried doing so, but it should be fairly straightforward.\n\nA: You can tinker with the Keyboard Settings to get something close to your desired behavior. Here's one idea:\nSet \"Touch Bar shows\" to \"Expanded Control Strip\" and remove all buttons on the Control Strip using \"Customize Touch Bar...\". Then set \"Press Fn key to\" to \"Show App Controls\".\nNow your Touch Bar will be empty unless you press fn to show the App Controls.\n—\nI also outline some ways to use Better Touch Tool to temporarily disable the Touch Bar in my answer on a related question.\n\nA: Unfortunately I do not have a touchbar Mac to test, but it seems like BetterTouchTool is able to do what you want:\n\n\nA: For my 2019 16\" MBP I ended up with this:\n$fn = 20;\n\nmodule RoundRect(w, d, h2, r, scale=1) {\n  h = h2/2;\n  linear_extrude(height=2*h, scale=scale)\n  translate([-w/2+r, -d/2+r, 0])\n  minkowski() {\n    circle(r=r);\n    square([w-2*r, d-2*r]);\n  }\n}\n//RoundRect(10, 11, 1, 2);\n\nmodule Cover() {\n  w = 242;\n  d = 11;\n  h = 1;\n  h1 = 0.5;\n  xside = 15;\n  holeDist = 5;\n  solid = xside + 11 * holeDist;\n  holeW = (w - solid)/12;\n  x0 = -w/2 + xside/2 + holeW/2;\n  xDist = holeW + holeDist;\n\n  mirror([0, 0, 1])\n  difference() {\n    union() {\n      RoundRect(w+2, d+2, h, 3);\n      translate([0, 0, h]) RoundRect(w+2, d+2, h1, 3, [w/(w+1), d/(d+1)]);\n    }\n    translate([0, 0, -1]) RoundRect(w, d, h+1, 2);\n    for (x = [0:11]) translate([x0+x*xDist, 0, 0]) RoundRect(holeW, d-6, h+1, 1);\n  }\n}\n\nCover();\n\nThis is a cover for the touch bar you can create with OpenSCAD. \n\nIt fits snugly (at least for the over-extrusion my DIY Prusa creates). For now this thingy converts that nonsense-bar into something more like a \"keyboard\". You can rest your fingers on the strip and to actually press a key you need some explicit force inside the holes. And if eventually in some future I might have the need for that touch bar I can pull the cover off and store it aside.\nFor another MBP (elder one or different size) you need to adapt the sizes. The ones I used were measured with a caliper.\n\nA: After checking this post and not finding a right and free option, I found Bar None:\n\nhttps://shauninman.com/archive/2020/04/12/bar_none\n\nIt allows you to lock the Touch Bar unless you press the fn key. Now I have F controls by default, but they do not work, unless I press fn and then I get the Control Strip :D\n\nA: As part of disabling the Touch Bar as much as possible on the Mac, here is how to prevent the default Touch Bar buttons on your lock screen / login screen from being able to do anything, if you accidentally press them.\nMy example is the 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro (physical Esc key) so it has 8 default irremovable buttons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Karabiner-Elements. Make sure your Touch Bar device is ticked under Devices tab for what it can modify.\n\n\n*In Simple modifications tab, this is what it looks like to disable all the above 8 keys:\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The last four buttons are listed under Media controls list by default.\n\n\n*The first four buttons need to be added manually via key detection by Karabiner-EventViewer (Karabiner-Elements menu bar > EventViewer). For each button, press it in EventViewer then add it to Karabiner-Elements as shown by the arrow.\n\n\n\n*Remap each key to VK_none to make them do nothing.\nI have not found a way to disable the Touch Bar at the driver level (i.e. the kext files), based on a cursory look.\n\nA: It's possible to completely remove everything from the touchbar by switching it to Expanded Control Stip mode in Keyboart Settings and then using \"Customise Control Strip ...\" in the same settings dialog to remove all the buttons from it.\nWell, it's not physically disabling the device, but there's nothing in it to accidentally touch.\nThe volume keys can be re-mapped to something like Option <> (with Karabiner Elements for example)\nWorks on Big Sur 11.2.1\n", "Q: Sleeping Apple Devices Responding to ARP Requests for the Default Gateway Hoping to get some insight regarding a bizarre issue that is being seen at a few of our networks, as well as others (based off reddit and NANOG posts). The short story of what is happening is that Apple devices (primarily MacBooks as well as some iMacs) that are sleeping will hijack the default gateway IP for the wireless VLAN that they are in, as well as responding to ARP requests asking who the default gateway is. This behavior makes the AP's log a message \"CAPWAP detected next hop MAC changed from correct_DG_mac_address to apple_mac_address.\"\nWe have tickets open with Cisco who is blaming Apple, and Apple who is stating we need logs that are utterly impossible to get as we cannot recreate this behavior. Apples current workaround? Push out a script to completely disable sleep on all Apple devices.\nMore specifics:\n\n\n*\n\n*This is only affecting 3802i WAPs that are in flexconnect mode, and\nwe are seeing this at multiple sites, on two different wireless\ncontrollers. The 3802i's do not reboot - they lose connectivity,\nrecover, repeat.\n\n*Wireless subnets are generally as large as /20 and contain the AP's\nas well as all clients. We plan to move AP's to a different subnet as\na test, but we are hesitant due to the fact that if AP's no longer\nlog the CAPWAP message/drop from Prime - then we will not know when\nthis behavior occurs making it harder to track.\n\n*The ARP entry on the switches NEVER changes. For this reason, I\nbelieve DAI/DHCP snooping would not be an effective solution as I've\nseen others suggest.\n\n*We think this behavior may be related to sleep proxy that can we seen\nwith out of the box Apple TV's, but have yet to prove that.\nMy question is - has anyone ran into this type of behavior before. In addition, does anyone have any suggestions as far as how to remedy this behavior so it no longer occurs?\n\nA: We've been experiencing this issue and we're running Cisco 3802 Flex Connect with a WLC 8500.\nWe are going to attempt DIA This weekend but from both Cisco and Apple they are saying there isn't much we can do. Cisco is saying they will have a patch for the Wireless Controller to introduce ARP security for this in about a month and Apple won't release to the public what is the issue or when their patch would be out to fix it.\nSome Options that have been floated to us as a Temp Solution\n-- Downgrade the WLC to 8.2 from the current recommended version 8.5.140\n-- Upgrade the WLC to 8.5.140.11 a special release not provided without support consent that will require DHCP reassociation on every device when roaming. Not a great Trade off.\n-- Remove Flex Connect and re design your WLAN to Central which would tunnel the ARP traffic to the WLC and use built in security for ARP protection. \"We are not going to do this\"\nWhat we will be trying!\nEnable DIA on the Switching platform and log the drops. The hope is if this is from a sleeping Macbook then the getting dropped won't matter and we'll see some kind of containment. \nThis is our last option.\n\nA: This is Cisco's public document on the topic.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/aironet-3800-series-access-points/214491-arp-responses-for-default-gateway-ip-add.html\nThe issue is real.

For a long time now, my Macbook has been overheating and hogging my CPU. According to Activity Monitor, Google Chrome Helper is the culprit. Whenever I am browsing the web, there are usually ten seperate entries of Google Chrome Helper in Activity Monitor, each individually using around %0.5 of my CPU. On YouTube, one of these can spike up to using %82, with a second using %22. I don't understand the math behind it but its evident in the screenshots I took. I own an up-to-date MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012) so it could be a result of an old system but only Chrome and YouTube (or just videos) are causing this issue.\nHere are some things I’ve attempted to control / solve this:\n\n\n*\n\n*updating FlashPlayer\n\n*disabling extentions\n\n*turning off Unsandboxed plug-in access to \"not allow any site to use a plug-in to access [my] computer\"\n\n*turning off JavaScript (which, of course, just stopped the page from loading in - very power efficient and cool, but not the trade off I had hoped to accomplish)\n\n\nI've tried other web browsing apps and they net similar results as Chrome. I believe it has something to do with videos in general that are being served\nAt the moment, I have had to use an app called MacsFanControl so my fan stops the CPU and computer from overheating as it used to get to around 50˚C. Now, it is sits at 40˚C with the fan running on high to prevent it increasing.\nAm I missing controls or options to have less heat from the CPU of this era MacBook Pro?\n\nA: You can test the efficiency of video encoding and decoding quite well by getting a video from Apple’s events page and playing it in QuickTime player.\nSame in Safari - and then same in Chrome.\nYou’ll quickly find out which encoding are easy to run for the CPU and which have GPU acceleration.\nWhen that’s done, you can see if Chrome or the app in question can choose a lower resolution or if you can download the file for offline playing so that it doesn’t hit the CPU so hard. Also, you might use an iPad or other far more efficient video handling device if you just want to watch videos with the most economy / least power.\n\nA: I’d suggest trying Opera browser if you have not. I’m sure someone will have bench tested browser resource use. \nAlso I think there two problems here, intense graphics and a greedy browser. \nIt might also be worth checking if you can, if the heat sink for the GPU is clogged with dust. \nThe fan control you mention is excellent. \nCan you reduce the resolution settings for YouTube only and try this with the same video?\n\nI have had major overheating grief with my iMac 27” 2011 GPU. \n\nA: Google Chrome is exceptionally inefficient, especially on macOS. Some developers (including myself) suspect Google has purposely made Chrome consume excessive and absurdly expensive resources.\nJust for grins, try using Safari instead of Chrome.\nIf that convinces you Chrome is a resource pig, try using Firefox for the same activities.\nIn my experiments, Firefox is 15% worse than Safari, but Chrome squeals like a pig.\nSee Why do so many insist on using Google Chrome instead of Safari?\nBTW, with a video playing in Safari on my 15\" MacBook Pro, I get a whopping 5.5% CPU usage. Activity Monitor takes twice as much CPU as YouTube playing in Safari, and I have a host of other applications running at the same time, including Docker, Creative Cloud, Mail, etc.\n\n\nA: When Firefox released their cool new multi-threaded version, I experienced exactly the same problem as you. The use of multiple CPUs heats the CPU much quicker. \nProbably you will not like this solution, but ever since I resorted to using Safari almost exclusively. It keeps my MacBook Pro much more quiet and gives me quite some extra battery time.\nIn addition to that you can try the following things (some of these apps may not work on your specific MacBook Pro model):\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Turbo Bosst Switcher. This app disables the Intel TurboBoost functionality, meaning it won't overclock the CPU above the base frequency anymore. The result is a slower Mac, especially in single-threaded applications, but also some power saving and less noise. \n\n*Use Volta. Basically the same as the above, but it can undervolt your CPU in addition. Undervolting can lead to unstable operation, while disabling TurboBoost usually creates no issues. I have less experience with this app. \n\n*Use App Tamer. It more or less does the same thing as the macOS built-in App Nap function and throttles inactive or background apps. However, it gives you more control and can be more aggressive. This sometimes leads to unexpected situations, such as a slow clipboard, and therefore takes some experimenting. Especially if you use many apps in parallel this can help to keep your Mac more quiet.\n\n*If your MacBook has a dual-GPU, don't use an external screen and avoid apps that trigger the use of the dedicated GPU. This used to be an issue for Chrome, but I am not sure if it still is.\n\n\nIn addition to these things, I also observed that all my older Macs became more noisy over time. As others said this may have to do with dust, but also with thermal paste thermally connecting the CPU to its heatsink, becoming less efficient. A number of people reported some success when replacing the thermal paste. \n\nA: Appreciate this is an old post, but I was experiencing the exact same performance issues with Chrome on my 2012 Macbook running Catalina. As soon as I opened Chrome, according to Chrome's own Task Manager, the \"Chrome Browser\" process was eating CPU, resulting in my Mac sounding like an Apache helicopter whenever I had Chrome open, regardless what I was doing in Chrome.\nAfter uninstalling all extensions, then Chrome itself, and re-installing everything, no change!\nWhat has worked? Taking the screws off the back, removing the bottom panel and removing the fan and the subsequent magic carpet of dust blocking the fan assembly. Put it all back together, my Mac is now silent and the Chrome CPU munching has gone. Assuming increased thermals resulted in throttling which Chrome and/or OSX didn't like.\n\nA: In my case, \"ten separate entries of Google Chrome Helper in Activity Monitor, each individually using around %0.5 of my CPU\"(more like 40 entries) turned out to be caused by ads served by pubmatic. Installing adblocker made Chrome CPU utilization go from 98% to 3%-4% immediately. My device is a mid 2014 MacBook Pro.\n\nA: As used with Google Chrome, pretty much often my Apple MacBook Pro 2020  (i7 with 32 GB of RAM) had a fan spinning hard  and temps were going up to 90°C.\nWhat worked for me and something that anyone never spoken about (to my great surprise) is to simply disable Hardware Acceleration in Google Chrome settings.\n\nA: Unfortunately, Mac overheating issues arise often :(( \nIf you faces this problem constantly, I kindly recommend you to make the following steps in order to reduce and prevent overheating of your Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*monitor the state of Mac constantly (special apps can help here)\n\n*clean your Mac from all the unnecessary files and apps\n\n*move large files to the cloud\n\n*don't open too much apps or tabs in browser at once\n\n\nAlso I use several apps which help me a lot to overcome overheating problem. But I know almost definitely that I have no troubles with hardware, so if you had ones - I don't know whether these apps will also help you. Anyway, if someone have overheating problems - I recommend to start from this step (for instance, try iStat Menu and CleanMyMac - here you can try these apps for free https://explore.setapp.com/8) and then see what happens with your Mac (whether cleaning your Mac helped you) and decide what to do next.\n", "Q: How to decide which is the better browser for me: Google Chrome or Safari?

I'm not sure if it got unplugged or nudged while powered up but it now doesn't work. I can mount the drive but I get errors when trying to mount the main partition.\nI have followed advice given here:\nExternal disk - Unrecognized file system (-69846)\nMount external HDD readOnly option\nHow to change the \"Recovery HD\" partition to type \"Apple_Boot\"?\nhowever none of the solutions have had much effect.\nLooking at my partition list I see that the partition type and name for my main partition is screwy:\n /dev/disk4 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *275.1 GB   disk4\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk4s1\n   2: 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC               274.9 GB   disk4s2\n\nI presume that they should be \"Apple_Boot\" and \"Macintosh HD\".\nI had hoped that using\nsudo asr adjust --target /dev/disk4s2 -settype \"Apple_Boot\"\nwould do the trick (or at least help) but all I get is\nasr: Volume adjustment failed: Invalid argument\nand as there appears to be very little documentation on the \"adjust\" functionality of asr I don't know how to proceed. I bought a new drive and hoped to restore my data from a Time Machine backup but it turns out that's corrupted!! So, I really do need to try and get this drive back into action again. Any help would be hugely appreciated.\nDrive was running OSX 10.14.3 Mojave.\n\nA: Here, I assumed \"primary drive\" meant a drive containing a APFS container from which you boot Mojave.\nI have not seen an recent posts referring to asr adjust. There is is no mention of adjust in the man page of asr in both High Sierra or Mojave. I would recommend avoiding the use of undocumented commands when other documented commands can accomplish the same task. In this case, you could have used gpt or the third party command gdisk.\nIn your case, you are trying to change a value that is already correct. The GUID for a APFS container partition is suppose to be 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC.  I assume when you executed diskutil you were booted to either a macOS (OS X) operating system or recovery that was too old to recognize the APFS partition type.\nIf you wish to boot to macOS Recovery over the Internet, then you should use the key combination Option-⌘-R to boot to the latest version compatible with your Mac. See the  Apple website About macOS Recovery for more information.\n", "Q: How to force Disk Encryption password on boot for ALL users? I want my MBP to be unlocked with Disk Encryption Password before getting access to the login screen. (read : I want to have two passwords prompts before the MBP can be used)\nTherefore, I made a clean (re)install of High Sierra and chose APFS Encryted. However the subsequent created admin account has a security token, which seems to be my issue.\nNow on startup I have the choice between the admin account and the Disk Encryption Password for others accounts with a disabled Token.\nI tried the following :\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried to remove myself (aka admin) from having the Secure Token with sysadminctl -secureTokenOff admin but I end up with the following error : \nOperation not permitted without a secure token unlock.\nHowever I do well have a one (sysadminctl -secureTokenStatus admin shows ENABLED)\n\n\n*Tried to remove myself from being able to unlock the disk with fdesetup remove -user admin but as I'm the only user, I got the following User could not be removed because it's the last OS user on the Volume\nIn short, how can I force the Disk Encryption Password prompt for ALL users, including admins ?\nIt makes echo to this post : Prompt for encrypted disk password on startup\nNote : \nOn a buggy install of HighSierra, I ended up with an admin account without Security Token, and it worked as intended. I had to go through the Disk Encryption Password prompt before anything else.\nHowever I re-installed MacOS because this situation made me unable to access the terminal from the MacOS Recovery (I had a error message saying that no admin with the correct statuts (read Token) with was found on the system)\n\nA: Ok, so here is half an answer.\n\n\n*\n\n*With a first admin account (e.g. admin) you create another one (admin_tmp) and you log into.\n\n*In the terminal you remove the first account from being able to unlock the disk with fdesetup remove -user admin. Meanwhile its SecureToken switch to Off.\n\n*You logout and log into 'admin'. Then from the Users accounts Preferences you remove the admin_tmp from the system.\n\n*Then you have an admin account with no SecureToken which seems to be the only way to force a Disk Encryption Password prompt on boot. Next accounts will inherently have no SecureToken, hence no allowance to decrypt the disk with their own password.\n\n\nThat's not ideal as this may break some stuff (See my Note in the initial post)\n", "Q: macOS: Can another user recover files I've deleted? I currently live with someone that I think may be recovering files I emptied from the Trash. It's their computer, they are admin, and I have a standard account. I just want to know are they capable of doing this? Is there anyway to find out obviously without having to just ask cause they'll lie anyways.\n\nA: There are various ways how this can be done:\n\n\n*\n\n*They may simply have a background job running which regularly copies all your files (whether in Trash or still in Documents etc) into a folder they control\n\n*They may use the backups created by Time Machine or any other backup software used\n\n*They can use data recovery software to recover deleted files\n\n\nHowever, this doesn't necessarily mean that the other person is reading your files.\nIf you are concerned about the sensitivity of data/files, you are advised to take measures such as using an encrypted volume, not creating files locally, using an external drive to store and view files and additionally, using Private browsing mode in Web browsers etc. \n\nA: When files are deleted from the trash, the information about the file is removed from the filesystem, but the areas on the disk that held the file (\"sectors\") are normally not zeroed out but awaits being reused later by other files as the operating system sees fit.  \nThis mean that if none of the sectors that held the actual contents of your file have been overwritten yet, the file can be reconstructed.  Programs exist that can scan all the sectors on a disk (requires superuser/admin rights) and look for hints about which sectors go together, and knowing stuff that sectors are typically allocated sequentially so sectors often belong together with the ones next to them, and can reconstruct files.  \nIf you really do not want this to happen, I would suggest creating an encrypted disk image which you then mount when logging in, and keep all your sensitive stuff on.  This will require your password to decrypt.   \n\nA: As implied in Nimesh Neema's answer: they wouldn't need to recover your deleted files -- because they already have access to ALL your files before they are deleted! It's their computer and they have admin privileges. \nThey wouldn't need to go to the effort of recovering your deleted files.\n", "Q: Adding symlink to /usr/bin I'm trying to add python3 to my path by adding a symlink but it's erroring and I'm not sure why.\n/usr/bin $ sudo su\nsh-3.2# ln -s /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/python3  /usr/bin/python3\nln: /usr/bin/python3: Operation not permitted\n\nsh-3.2# whoami\nroot\n\nsh-3.2# ls -la | head -n 2\ntotal 139064\ndrwxr-xr-x  977 root   wheel     31264 24 Jul  2018 .\n\n* Edit *\nI have symlinked from /usr/local/bin/python3 so that's fine.\n\nA: /usr/bin is, as a lot of directories installed by default, protected by SIP and can't be modified by any user.

I am used to using the American Webster dictionary.\nI have an iPad Pro, and I am using Apple Books app. Under Settings app → General → Dictionary, I am not able to add additional resources. I was able to download the Webster dictionary app from the App Store. Yet the dictionary was not added to the list in the Settings of my iPad.\nHow do I make the Webster dictionary database available under system dictionary?\n\nA: Unfortunately, what you are trying to accompanist is not possible due to nature of how iOS works.\nThe list of dictionaries available under Settings app → General → Dictionary is curated by Apple, and can not be altered/added-to by end users.\nIf you download a dictionary app from the App Store, it does not, and cannot be automatically integrated into the iOS operating system and made available system wide.\nTo use the Webster dictionary, in your case, you'll have to manually type/copy the word into the app and determine the meaning.\n", "Q: Set the Working Folder of `.app` Created by Apple Script I have a simple Shell File .sh which copies files form the PWD to a destination folder.\nThis is basically Hand Made installer of a program.\nI want to create an APP from it.\nThe idea is to have the following structure of the files at the user:\n- MyApp\n    - SourceFiles/\n    - MyInstaller.app\n\nSomething like:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Copying\n\ncp -r './SourceFiles/.'

I have a few folders with a large number of images that I typically sort by modification date.\nSometimes I'll accidentally trigger one of Mojave's new Quick Actions, such as rotating the image. This incidentally updates the modification time, moving the image to the top of the list. Even undoing the action won't restore the old modification time.\nThey are shown in a bar at the bottom of the preview pane. Next to them there is a handy \"More...\" button, with a Customize option. This links to System Preferences, where it looks like you can easily disable the ones you don't want.\nHowever, this does not disable the keyboard shortcut, which is what I tend to hit by accident.\nHow do I disable either these actions, or the shortcuts triggering them?\n\n\nA: keyboard shortcuts are usually managed in System Preferences > Keyboard, under the Shortcuts tab.\nYou don't say what the shortcut is, but a quick test reveals that it's Command R. (The Edit menu flashes, but there's no corresponding menu item.) Command Alt R goes the other way.\nYou may be able to assign that key press in the Finder to some other (rarely used) menu item or service, and see if that stops it.\n\nA: As benwiggy says above:\n\nYou may be able to assign that key press in the Finder to some other (rarely used) menu item or service, and see if that stops it.\n\nIt does indeed. Before Mojave, Command-R activated \"Reveal Original\" in the File Menu. I created a shortcut in the Keyboard preference panel restoring that connection, and another one for Cmd-Opt-R to \"Rename\" in the File menu, which seems innocuous.\n\n\nA: If you're like me and you want it to do nothing (maybe you have a mouse button mapped to CMD+R and you don't want to accidentally rotate images), remap \"Bring All to Front\" to CMD+R in the Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts preferences.\n", "Q: Merging APFS Containers using the Disk Utility Application I recently deleted my dual boot from my mac, but I am now left with two partitions that I can't figure out how to merge.

I am unable to use iTunes to manage it as the device is locked to a single computer which happens to be in a different country, as such sending it back there just to have it sorted is a last case scenario.\nThe issue is that no matter what type of backup I try and perform, the system is reserving 6GB for itself and the videos taking up the remaining 10GB of the 16GB device, which basically fails every single backup attempt due to insufficient space (Just to confirm I got 50GB limit on iCloud, with 0GB in use). Is there no way to tell the system to re-evaluate what it's keeping reserved because I am pretty sure it's just a bunch of old backup references or temporary files. Also how much space is required on the device to perform this backup?\n\nA: So I left the iPad overnight and it successfully uploaded everything to iCloud despite having very little available space. I believe this may have something to do with the fact that I manually started a backup via Settings->Name->iCloud->iCloud Backup->Back Up Now rather than using iCloud Photo Library/Sharing function. The backup did complain about not having sufficient space but at some stage it seems to have kicked in, perhaps the device re-evaluated what it was reserving in system storage and made sufficient space.\n\nA: One way to see what is taking up space on a device is through the Settings app >> General >> iPad Storage. Here, you can see a breakdown of what app/service is using how much space. This will also show you how much space the system is holding or taking up. You can also Offload apps to save space.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How to avoid 'Move to Applications folder' prompt? I downloaded the zip file of iterm, unzipped it and copied the iterm.app folder to /Applications from terminal. When I open the iterm file in applications, I still get the prompt to move it to Applications folder. Tried moving it to Users applications folder too. How do I avoid this error?\n\nA: Although this is hard to check, it seems like Gatekeeper was being overly-protective, but has since been adjusted.\nWhen using macOS Sierra (10.12) or later, if an app is in /Applications/ but prompts to be moved to /Applications/ when run, then chances are very high that the app has recognized that it has been subjected to Gatekeeper’s “app translocation”. If you’re interested in the details you can find them online, but the practical effect is that if you went into Terminal (or iTerm) and ran\nps auxwww | fgrep -i YourAppHere \nYou would see a path that is not /Applications/YourAppHere.app but more like /private/var/folders/[something-random-looking]/AppTranslocation/YourAppHere.app.\nThe preferred way of moving apps around (according to Apple) is with the Finder. If you drag an app from the ~/Downloads/ folder to /Applications then it will not be 'translocated'.\nIf you insist on not doing things Apple’s preferred way, your only option is to remove the quarantine flag from the app. This will remove all of Gatekeeper’s protections, so use at your own risk. You can remove the quarantine flag using this command:\nfind \"/Applications/iTerm.app\" -exec xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine {} \\;\n\nReplace \"/Applications/iTerm.app\" with the appropriate app name as needed, obviously.\nYou will need to re-launch the app for the app translocation to go away.\n\nA: Although 5 months ago - did you ensure that there is no other iTerm2 application stored at your local machine except for the one in the application folder?\nFor example, if a different copy is still in the Download folder, then it might be called from there. Later the prompt appears to move it in the application folder. \n", "Q: ssh to non-existent .local name never times out If I try to connect to a non-existent .local hostname using most utilities, including ping and telnet, it times out after 5 seconds:\n% time telnet host.example.local\nhost.example.local: nodename nor servname provided, or not known\ntelnet host.example.local  0.01s user 0.01s system 0% cpu 5.018 total\n\nThis matches the timeout for the .local config in scutil --dns.\nBut when I try to ssh to such a hostname, it never times out. (I just Ctrl-C'd one that was still waiting after 16 minutes.) I can't figure out any existing option in any of the ssh_config files that would seem to affect hostname resolution. The only option I see that seems relevant is \"CanonicalizeHostname\", and it's not configured in any config file, but I manually set it to \"no\" with no change in behavior. Adding -v flags to ssh doesn't reveal any additional information about hostname resolution beyond the fact that it's \"Connecting to host.example.local port 22\", which is the last debug line produced.\nI tried capturing the MDNS queries for telnet and ssh. It appears to make an initial query, then wait 1s and ask again, then again 3s later, etc., each retry waiting 3 times longer than the last. telnet gave up after three requests (0s, 1s, and 3s), but ssh got up to the seventh request (0s, 1s, 3s, 9s, 27s, 81s, 243s) before I stopped watching.\nI can kind of work around the problem by setting ConnectTimeout 5 in ssh_config (even limiting it to *.local), but that breaks if the name resolution completes but the remote ssh server is slow to respond.\nHow can I get ssh to timeout name resolution in the same manner as other network tools?\n\nA: Rather than make a bunch of comments, here’s how I would start to corner this. I can’t reproduce this yes, so I might be totally wrong. \nFirst, does ssh using a known bad local IP address time out fast or understandably / reliably?\nSecond, does the potential (or any) machine show as advertised?\n dns-sd -B _ssh._tcp local\n\nThird, do you have any apple device that’s proxying bonjour sleep wake?\nIf not, why even try ssh to something that mdns could dig up later or have bonjour sleep proxy trying to keep waking that device.

If you truly want to analyze/filter the stream of logs as they occur then you'll want to use log stream like this:\n$ log stream --source | grep -iE \"some regex string\"\n\n-or-\n$ log stream --source --predicate 'processImagePath contains \"some bit of text\"'\n\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*How to filter logs via processImagePath?\n\n*log man page\n\nA: You could also just use zgrep to recursively (-R) search the logs directory (/var/log), though it doesn't handle Apple's asl format so nicely e.g.\nzgrep -R that_thing /var/log\n\n", "Q: macOS Mojave on iMac won't boot into safe mode My iMac (late 2015, 8/1TBSSD) has run happily for more than a year on High Sierra, and I just now upgraded the OS to Mojave. Now, the machine won't boot into safe mode or into Recovery. When I hold down the appropriate keys before or at the startup chimes, the regular boot ensues. Booting is brisk and correct. No firmware password is set. The keyboard is a wired Apple keyboard A1243; in use it gives no indication of fault with any of its keys.\nIn all other respects, the Mac operates as it should. I updated my MacBook Air (mid-2013, 4/512SSD) at the same time using the same Mojave installer, and the Air behaves as it should. \nWhat's gone awry here, and how might I return the iMac to its correct functioning?\n\nA: I am relieved (and embarrassed) to report that the fault was a poor USB connection between the wired keyboard and the iMac USB port. A little unplugging and re-plugging solved everything. The iMac now boots correctly, in whatever mode I select.\nThe keyboard connection was only faulty in the computer's un-booted state. When booted, the computer accepted keyboard input from every key, including the various function keys.\nThe USB connections had been in place for about a year, since I bought the computer. Apparently prudence dictates that these connections be periodically unplugged and reconnected. \n", "Q: Can I create two different keyboard shortcuts for the same command? The Preferences.app > Keyboard > Shortcuts pane allows for the creation of shortcuts to activate menu commands. However if that menu command already has a keyboard then that shortcut is overridden by the new shortcut. \nFor example, the Paste menu command - I would prefer to use more than one shortcut to execute that command.\n\n\n*\n\n*Command + V\n\n*Shift + Insert \n\n\nHow do I prevent the second addition from removing the first that so that I can create as many keyboard shortcut aliases as I want for a given menu command?\n\nA: Look into using the application \"Keyboard Maestro\" as a possible solution to your problem.\n", "Q: Collaborative spreadsheet application I'm looking for an application that will allow me to create fields that represent 'points' to keep tally on mod actions by my online community. Another mod or user who i give permissions to can update the points while mods without permissions to update the points have read only access.\nOnce points are updated, the 'total' column is updated.\nWhile you get 1 point for every mod action, some column should be worth more or have a higher multiplier than others.\nI'm not even sure if a spreadsheet is strictly needed or if it can be something else.\nI've tried google sheets but that seems clunky.\nI was wondering if there was a mac specific or ios specific app i could use that wouldn't require the participants of the spreadsheet to have a mac to view it.\nmaybe something with bot an ios and android app.\n\n\nA: Create a Numbers spreadsheet with the appropriate function logic, then lock the cells that viewers shouldn't touch.\nThen share a link from Numbers, with no protection so that anyone can use the web link.\nI think you'll be pretty pleased with it. \n", "Q: File Save dialog unreadable I just updated my iMac to Mojave, and am still trying to setup my preferences.\nI tried dark mode, but did not like it (half of me apps seem to ignore it anyway).\nI switched to light mode, but this too has problems.\nThe File Save dialog shows a list of Directories and existing files, but the latter are very light grey, almost indistinguishable from the background.\n\nI have searched the Preferences menu, but can't seem to find any setting to set normal contrast levels like in High Sierra.\n\nA: Can you supply a screenshot? Greyed-out files in file dialogs usually mean that those items can't be selected. For an Open dialog, greyed files are ones than can't be opened by the app.\nFor a Save dialog, it's normal for existing files to be greyed out, because you're not going to select them, you're creating a new file. (However, you can actually select them to inherit their filename.)\nThere should be no difference in Light Mode between Mojave and previous versions of MacOS.\nThere are settings in System Preferences > Accessibility > Display that increase the contrast and Reduce Transparency, which you may have previously used.\n", "Q: Salt Water Damaged iPhone, Can I get the content off it? My iPhone X keeps showing the Apple Logo, then cuts out and does the same. I have got a lot of photos on in that I would like to get off. Would that be possible?\nAny software, or other methods to get the content off a dead iphone?\n\nA: What you described is called a boot loop.  It is caused by any number of things, but based on your description, it sounds like it was caused by physical damage. \nCan this be recovered?\nYes, but there’s no software that gets around a physical problem.   For this type of issue, it’s possible that restoring your phone from a backup you may be able to “fix” the problem.  However, any data not backed up can and will be lost.\nThere are 3rd party services that offer recovery services - iPad Rehab is one such example.  They are a bit pricy, but on the flip side, they don’t charge you unless they’re successful. (I’m not affiliated, just very familiar with their offerings)\n\nA: yah boot loops can be a real pain. Salt water damaged iPhones can have a few walls to hop over in order to get the data recovered. The main problem is encryption, a few companies can recover files directly from the NAND flash. It really depends on if the phone version is encrypted and how the smartphone is damaged.\nMany people do not have a backup, in this case, if the lost data is important you will want to recover it I am sure. In this case just get the phone to a smartphone recovery company as soon as possible. The longer you wait the more damage will take place due to corrosion. eProvided is a place I would speak with.\n", "Q: Turning on/off Airplane mode on iPhone X from a desktop computer Is there a tool similar to the Android debug bridge (adb) for iOS? Specifically, if connected to a computer via USB, is it possible to turn on and off Airplane mode with some command, interface or tool?\nI have tried libimobiledevice. However, they don't have support for Airplane mode toggling.\n\nA: libimobiledevice (and technically, usbmuxd as well), like you mentioned, is the functional equivalent of adb in the iOS world, in the sense that it allows you to communicate with your iOS devices over USB.\nlibimobiledevice doesn't  provide any API that I know of which allows you to toggle Airplane mode.\nHowever, what you can use is UI Automation on an iOS device. You can create a script which would simulate a user opening the Settings app and toggling Airplane Mode.\nIf your machine is a Mac, you can use Appium (a framework which builds on top of UI Automation). In Appium, you'll first have to create a test automation session, and then toggle Airplane mode. There is sample code on the Internet which explains how you can do this.\nIf your machine is not a Mac, you can still use Appium but with a twist - you can use commercial tools like Appium Studio, Quamotion WebDriver or xcuitrunner.\n", "Q: How to make a table editable in a keynote template? When adding Images, Text & Shape to a Master slide you have the option of Define as Media Placeholder.\nNo such option (appears to) exists if you add a Table to a master slide. This means that when someone adds a slide from a template which contains a table it is non-editable.\nIs there anyway of adding a Table to a Master Slide which allows that table to remain editable?\n\nA: No.\nThe only thing you can do is to add an object placeholder to the master so that the table gets inserted with the desired position/dimensions.\nPlus a table style with the desired color scheme. If you then delete all the default table styles, your custom table style gets applied when inserting the table into the slide.\n", "Q: Senior Apple Customer Service Contact Required I’ve currently got an issue with Apple that issue being that I’m attempting to recover purchases that I’ve paid money to Apple for an Apple ID that I’ve forgotten the password to. \nUnfortunately I cannot reset the password as I’ve got an outdated (and since removed) two step verification setup on the account, and I cannot locate the required recovery key to reset it. \nAll other reset options were taken away by Apple when two step verification is enabled. I’ve had several phone calls and online chats with Apple advisors, Senior advisors and iTunes Support and I keep getting told one of three things “sorry we need password verification to access the account” or “purchases can not be transferred to another Apple ID” or it’s an Apple “privacy” policy. \nWhilst I reluctantly accept that I’m locked out and cannot regain access my account I do not accept that I have to readily forfeit everything that I’ve paid good money for to Apple for. \nApple unfortunately haven’t thought through the account recovery process for accounts with two step enabled properly and have in my opinion dropped the ball.\nThe only assistance I’ve received is an email from iTunes Support with a feedback link, I’ve chosen not to use this as it is exactly what is says “feedback” and Apple advise on the feedback page that they will not respond to individual comments. I actually want my case to be looked into and I want my primary Apple ID credited with everything I’ve paid for and I require a written response. \nI previously asked an Apple advisor for a senior point of contact/department where I can take up my grievance and the only contact that they could give me was a surface mail address in another country, this is totally unacceptable especially for a technology company. \nI’ve also been told by an Apple Senior Advisor that they can’t due to the way in which their system is engineered see an Apple ID’s details/history without an account holders password. \nI’m located in Australia and I’m looking for contact details for an Apple Department that is capable of accessing Apple ID’s and seeing its history without a password being needed and has the authority to credit an account. Law enforcement agencies seem to get what they want without to much trouble and they don’t have passwords this according to the public disclosures on Apples Privacy webpage. \nApologies for rambling on, any help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: Apple makes it easy to request legal access to things you can’t get when you can’t reset the password via normal channels.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/legal/more-resources/\nIf you’re not a lawyer or part of the government, you probably won’t get much help there. Same trying to get Apple support to disclose information or rescue an account if you can’t just follow the instructions for forgotten passwords / lock out.\nApple surely has their people trained and they know full well what you want and they are saying no. If you’ve been through 3 people, you’re not going to get a better audience by stalking / brow beating someone in my experience. Apple said no to the US FBI for unlocking phones and accounts, so they’re likely not going to cave with someone that’s not able to unlock purchases on their account.\n\nA: Australian Competition & Consumer Commission\nAs you are in Australia, and assuming you made the purchases in Australia, contact the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission:\n\nThe ACCC promotes competition and fair trade in markets to benefit consumers, businesses, and the community. We also regulate national infrastructure services.

He was mostly using Windows with Boot Camp. macOS was not used at all.\nHow likely is it, that the thief may be able to reset Windows password?\nIs it possible to transfer the hard disk to another computer and access it through Windows files.\nAnd of-course, I don't want specific information about resetting password for accessing files etc. Only a confirmation what might be the worst situation.\n\nA: You didn’t provide enough detail to adequately address the actual problem (I.e MacBook model, version of Win10, was it unlocked/unencrypted, etc ),  so we must look at this from the worst case scenario:\nOnce a device is physically in the possession of nefarious parties, you must assume the entire system is compromised. \nGuessing what the risk is at this point is an exercise in wishful thinking.  \nThis is where you advise your friend to start securing accounts (change passwords, add two factor authentication, etc.)\n\nA: If a person created a Windows 10 installer flash drive and use this flash drive to boot the Mac, then the person would have access to the Windows user files. The ISO file needed to create this flash drive is made available free of charge by Microsoft. The file can be downloaded from this Microsoft website.\nFor example, when booting from the October 2018 Windows 10 update, you will first get the screen shown below.\n \nIf you press the key combination shift+F10, then you will get a the Command Prompt windows shown below.\n\nIf a user account was named dma, the one could change the directory to this users Desktop by entering the command given below.\ncd /d c:\\users\\dma\\desktop\n\nSome newer Macs will have Windows installed with a Windows Recovery Environment (WRE). However, if someone tries to use WRE to open a Command Prompt Window, then they will be prompted to select a existing user account and will be required to enter a password.\n\nA: If the Mac is booted into Windows, you lose all the benefits of macOS like Find my Mac. Unless you've set a firmware password, presume the thief has access to absolutely everything on that system since it's now effectively a Windows PC.\nMy strong suggestion is that it's better to run Windows under Parallels than to use Boot Camp and thereby give up so many macOS-related protections. FileVault, for example, is effectively useless on a Boot Camp-enabled machine.\nA T2-equipped Mac with FileVault enabled and ONLY macOS installed (no Boot Camp) is practically impenetrable, especially if a secure firmware password has also been set.\n\nA: It depends on the specifics of the Windows setup. If your friend had the Mac setup with \"Device Encryption\" (known as BitLocker and/or Full Disk Encryption in earlier versions of Windows) - then the data is reasonable secure as long as your friend had a hard-to-guess passphrase for unlocking the encryption.\nIf your friend did not encrypt the Mac, then all bets are really of.

Internet Recovery was still able to connect to the Wi-Fi access point. From this it follows that the Wi-Fi configuration (of the last used Wi-Fi access point) must be stored somewhere else. Where and how can I read from there?\n\nA: Passwords for the previously connected Wi-Fi access point are also stored in your Mac's NVRAM (along with the keychain which is managed by macOS and is stored in your hard drive).\nFrom the Apple Support article, Reset NVRAM or PRAM on your Mac:\n\nNVRAM (nonvolatile random-access memory) is a small amount of memory that your Mac uses to store certain settings and access them quickly.\nSettings that can be stored in NVRAM include sound volume, display resolution, startup-disk selection, time zone, and recent kernel panic information.

The episodes are listed in the iTunes Store but they no longer download. I tried deleting the podcast and resubscribing but it quits at the same spot.\nIs there a way for me to reset iTunes or the podcast to get this working? It's working for other subscribers but not for me. The same happens in the Podcasts app for iPhone.\n\nA: Based on our troubleshooting in the Comments, the problem appears to be from the podcast provider's side.\nUsing two different podcast players in iOS, the last available episode for download was several weeks ago.  The latest version is not yet available.\nBy going directly to the podcast owner's site, the episode is playable directly from there.  It will not download to the podcast player, however. The OP will contact the podcast creator for further assistance.\n", "Q: New iPhone, took a few nice pictures, then restored with the data of old iPhone. Pictures gone - help! Bought new iPhone, took a few nice pictures with girlfriend, then proceeded to restore with the data of old iPhone. Pictures gone now. Can I get them back somehow?\nThe pictures were not backed up by iCloud or anything like it. Already tried Fonelab as a data recovery tool, but no photos showed up.\nIt's so stupid that the apps that I downloaded before are still there but the photos are gone... just does not make any sense! thanks!\n\nA: When you restored the phone, you have changed the encryption keys on the iPhone and the old keys are gone. Unfortunately, the chances of recovering those pictures are almost 0%. It is not simply not worth trying.\nThe apps are there because when you've downloaded them, you have been logged in to the App Store with your account, so the information about your download/purchase was stored on Apple's server. After you have restored your phone, you have logged in again with the same account, and thus it is possible for the phone to restore your purchases/downloads.\n", "Q: How can i install version 10.12.0 on my late 2008 macbook pro? I need to install microsoft word for university but it won't let me without version 12.1.2 on the macbook however it doesn't say that the mac needs updating?\n\nA: The latest version of Mac OS X for a Late 2008 MacBook Pro is OS X 10.11.6, and therefore if the requirements for the version of MS Word your university is using is macOS 10.12.0, you'll not be able to install it.\nFrom the Microsoft website:\n\nOperating system Office 2019 for Mac is supported on the three most recent versions of macOS. When a new version of macOS is released, the Office 2019 for Mac Operating System requirement becomes the then-current three most recent versions: the new version of macOS and the previous versions.\nProduct functionality and feature availability may vary on older systems.

I work on multiple physical locations with different Wi-Fi's to connect to. Certain Wi-Fi's are within local networks that have specific network settings. I have added different \"Locations\" in the network preferences but those need to be changed manually as it's not attached to a geo location or a specific connection.\nI was wondering if there's any way to automatically update my network settings (eg. proxy settings) based on which Wi-Fi I'm connected to...so that when I switch to a different network I also switch network settings?\n\nA: The locationchanger commandline tool allows changing the macOS Network Location setting according to Wi-Fi SSIDs.\nBasically, after installing, you create Location settings in the Network preferences with the same name as the Wi-Fi SSIDs you connect to. The tool then changes the network location setting according to the connected Wi-Fi network SSID.\nIf no matched name is found, it falls back to the \"Automatic\" network location setting.\nSee https://github.com/eprev/locationchanger for download and usage instructions.\nIt even supports advanced features like running scripts when a specific Wi-Fi network is connected.

While I was trying to erase the partition, the minus button was grayed out, but I found that if I clicked the minus on the other small partitions (I'm assuming retrospectively that it was the disk utility partition and something else) then I was able to delete the Ubuntu partition, so that's what I did.\nSo now my hard drive has one partition, disk0s2 with about 900gb and then an extra free space of 99.8gb. The free space can't be partitioned or reconfigured in any way, attempting to do so starts up a progress bar that never gets beyond 'preparing'. disk0s2 is unmounted, the mount button is blue and not grayed out, but clicking it does nothing.\nRestarting and running in disk utility mode (I believe that's what it's called, CMD+R), does work, restarting holding OPT shows only the EFI boot, which takes me to GNU Grub version 2.02, which is also what happens when restarting normally. I thought that maybe inserting a USB and downloading Mac OS onto that from the disk utility start up might be a way of solving this problem, but my computer won't mount the USB (the mount button is not grayed out but clicking it does nothing) so it doesn't show up when trying to reinstall the OS. \nWhat should I do? I have access to an external hard drive with enough space to put what was on my hard drive if that is possible, but obviously I would prefer to be able to recreate the disk utility partition (?) and remount disk0s2.\nHere is the result of running diskutil in terminal: \n\n\nA: You should be able to repair you existing partition so you can boot to OS X. The steps are given below. Here, I assume you were using Yosemite or some other version of OS X that installs to a \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" formatted volume.

But starting a few weeks ago, I'd wake up having created no new files, and 5gb would be gone, or 10gb.\nToday, it told me that no storage was left. I freed up 5gb by deleting some apps I no longer used... and it has slowly eaten that as I watch the finder window's footer. Down to 546mb at the moment. And there's nothing else left to get rid of.\nWhat the hell is going on? I have a Terminal.app open. I have a Firefox window open (that I'm typing into right now). And a few Sublime tabs.\nIf I reboot, I'll get maybe 11-12gb of this back... and it will slowly gobble that up over a period of at most a few hours. I don't know what's going.\nI don't think this is malware, no files are messed up anywhere, no ransomware horseshit. Where do I start checking? Down to 373mb now. \nIt has done this in the past, of course, but an hour later whatever it was using that storage for would be freed, and I'd have no incidents for weeks/months afterward. This is the first time that it didn't self-correct.\n\nA: You might want to check the disk usage with something like \ndu -h \nwhich will scan the current working directory.\nor \ndu -hs if you have an idea which directory might be taking much of the space.\nOmniDiskSweeper is also an awesome free tool to see where all the files are taking so much space but be extra careful with it as you would not want to remove any system files, here is a video where you may get some ideas.\nAnother reason can be swap memory. When there is a lot of applications running and the system memory cannot take it anymore, it saves temporary memory into ssd, as a result when you are rebooting, it is going away but then the system is making it again.

It's a special type of file, which is mapped on your Macbook's 234 Gb (formatted capacity) SSD. In short, virtual memory is used when your RAM is full of apps and portions of it is \"swapped\" to the SSD.\nSo, your Macbook Pro has only one SSD drive.\nIf you have Homebrew installed, you can install ncdu with this command in Terminal:\nbrew install ncdu\n\nand then you can use it in the terminal with:\nncdu \nto see where your Macbook's disk space went.\nYou can see additional options by pressing ? while running ncdu.\n", "Q: Maximizing app window while persisting Menu bar on top I would like to maximize all my app windows, especially browser windows. But I don't want to cover up the Menu bar at the top of the screen.\nRight now, when I maximize Google Chrome for instance, it will expand all the way and hide the Menu bar, but when I hover the mouse pointer to the top, the window will jump up and down to reveal/conceal the Menu bar. I find this to be super annoying.\nThe first step of the dance routine:\n\nThe second step of the dance routine:\n\nAnd, as I move my mouse up/down the view will toggle. I just want the Menu bar to always remain visible, but for my app windows to be maximized. Is that so hard?\n\nA: You can use the free tool Spectacle App which allows to maximize (but no full-screen) the windows to use all available desktop space with following keyboard shortcut:\nOption + Command + F\nThe keyboard shortcuts are visible in the app menu and can be changed within the app if they interfere with your workflow.\n\n\nA: I also found this annoying and I use the excellent BetterTouchTool in two ways:\nFirst, I defined an action that right clicking the maximize button will maximise windows rather than trigger fullscreen mode. Of course, you can set your own action or key combination instead or even override the green button entirely. \n\nSecond, I use Window Snapping, which basically imitates the functionality in Microsoft Windows. When you drag a window into a corner or to the top of the screen it will either enlarge it to an area of the screen or maximize it, respectively. \n\n\nA: It's very easy to accomplish something very similar to what you are trying to do without resorting to any 3rd-party tools.\nIn macOS Mojave, the default action for the maximize button is to take an app window full-screen. Notice how the icon displays two triangles facing in diagonally opposite direction.\n\nWith an app window is in full-screen mode, the default behavior of macOS is to hide the Menu bar, and reveal it upon hover at the top.\nYou can press and holding the Option key while clicking on maximize button, to prevent the app window from going into full-screen mode. But this will only maximize the window to reveal all content (which may not necessarily be same as full maximizing).\n\nAs this is not what you want, you can achieve a very similar end-result without taking app window full-screen. To accomplish this, simply move the cursor to any of the four corners of the app window, until it turns into a double sided diagonal shaped arrow like one of these (depending on which corner you choose):\n or \nNow, with this cursor icon visible, press and hold the Option key, and double click to maximize the app window to cover the entire screen, without hiding the Menu bar (as shown):\n\nTo reap the full benefit of this approach (i.e. achieving full-screen mode like appearance with Menu bar visible), it is recommended to enable Dock auto hiding by going to System Preferences → Dock and check Automatically hide and show the Dock.\n", "Q: Tell application next track inside repeat I am trying to define script to play next on iTunes an Spotify like this.\non run {input, parameters}\n    set apps to (\"Spotify\", \"iTunes\")\n    repeat with thisApp in apps\n        tell application thisApp\n            next track\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend run\n\nBut on the tell block, I keep getting: \"Expected end of line but found identifier.\"\nHow can I use application's name as iterable var in this case?\n\nA: This format will work:\nset apps to {\"Spotify\", \"iTunes\"}\nrepeat with thisApp in apps\n    if (thisApp's contents = \"Spotify\") then\n        tell application \"Spotify\" to next track\n    else if (thisApp's contents = \"iTunes\") then\n        tell application \"iTunes\" to next track\n    end if\nend repeat\n\n", "Q: How to resize my partitions?

I don't see any reference to do that. Can any one help me on this. \n\nA: Ideally you want to avoid custom user interface elements within modern installer packages on macOS.\nWhere possible, fit your needs into the built-in options provided by the Installer. Alternatively, place the requirements into a supporting tool or first run sequence of any installed application.\nInstaller Plug-in\nIf you must use a custom Installer plug-in, the latest Xcode continues to include a template project to get you started. Know that this route will be expensive in terms of development time and effort; additionally it is unlikely to be supported in future versions of the operating system.\nCreate a new plug-in in Xcode using the menu item:\nXcode.app > File > Project… > macOS / Installer Plug-in\nThe project includes a template for you to customise. In particular, take a look at the source code of the InstallerPane class. The header file contains comments and insight into how to subclass the class.\nExamples and Documentation\nThe plug-in tutorial by Stéphane Sudre looks like a great resource.\nAnother good resource is the Installer Developer mailing list archive.\nShowing End User Licence Agreements\nIf you need to show an End User Licence Agreements (EULA) in your installer, use the built-in license entry in the package's distribution definition file.\nWhere more than one EULA is required, concatenate the licences into one document.\n", "Q: What are the verifiable privacy features macOS provides?

There's also an overview of the security technologies used in MacOS.\nOn MacOS, the main feature is FileVault (or the default encryption on the newest Macs with \"T2\" controller chips. Disk encryption means that the data on your Mac can only be accessed by someone with the password.\nSafari has been at the fore-front of technologies to stop user tracking and maintain privacy.\nOn iOS, I'm sure you will have seen new reports of the US government wanting Apple to help them get into iPhones, and Apple indicating that is unable to comply, (and also unwilling). Here's Apple's iOS Security documentation.\nThere will always be vulnerabilities, exploits, and mistakes, of course.\n\nA: If you want something that's 'legally binding' then your only option is Apple's own Privacy Policy.  These are the items to which Apple will be held.\nOn that page is simple navigation, in every language Apple supports, that leads you to easy to read pages on the features/privacy/security they provide.\nTechCrunch wrote in 2017 about these pages:\n\nToday, Apple  is launching a new version of its privacy page that presents security and privacy as a consumer feature set.\nThe version of the site that launches today I think finally brings together all of these pieces and tells a story of Apple’s security policies as true, usable consumer features.\nThe security features of iPhone, iOS and other devices are presented on the site as a product showcase inside the philosophical framework of security — with a splash of customer education.\n\n", "Q: How can I preview an image in its original size? I have 2 images in a directory and I see from the Get Info that one has Dimensions: 532 × 1051 and size 45KB on disk. The other based on the Get Info has Dimensions: 1440 × 2900 and size 379KB on disk.  \nProblem\nWhen I open them with Preview they both show in the same size although the resolution is better in the latter, but how can I preview them and have the images open in their original size? I think the one with 532 × 1051 should be smaller when opened.\nI see that there is an option in Preview -> View -> Actual Size, I selected that but the size remained the same (slightly zoomed in) and now that option is grayed out.\n\nA: \"Resolution\" is not the number of pixels, but the number of pixels per inch, or centimeter, or other unit.\nMost image formats contain data about the resolution: i.e. how many image pixels should appear in a given screen area. If the smaller image has a resolution of 72 pixels per inch, and the larger image a resolution of c. 200 ppi, then they will appear the same size on screen in Preview.\nYou can see the DPI setting for an image in Preview by showing the Inspector window -- Command I. If the image file has a resolution set, it will be listed there as DPI Height and DPI Width.\nPreview does have a Preference to define 100% scale as either 1 image pixel = 1 screen pixel, or to use the resolution data in the image (\"size on printout\").\n", "Q: How to migrate WhatsApp messages data from Android to iPhone?

Please, read the description of my problem, I already know macOS can change certain individual strings. What I want is different.\nI bought a MacBook from Ebay.com with macOS High Sierra, and being Spanish, I normally use the Spanish keyboard distribution (because I need to type things like ñ, á, é, í..., which would be very slow to type using Option + e + letter). The problem with this is that most symbols don't match what I see on my physical keyboard, and using the Spanish distribution I actually have to memorize which keys do what. Therefore, I've tried to change the keyboard configuration so that something like 'a (easy to type, uses the same keys as á in Spanish) gets changed automatically to á. But it only works when 'a is typed like that, and not when it's part of a word (like lloverá).\nCould I somehow use the English distribution (so that I can actually see in my keyboard what every key does) but have things like 'a or 'n automatically changed to á and ñ?\nThanks.\n\nA: Go to system preferences/keyboard/input sources and add the keyboard called US International PC to the list.  Then remove the others.  This keyboard turns ` ~ ' \" ^ into dead keys to add accents.  So 'e produces é, ~n produces ñ.\n", "Q: 2018 Mac Mini - Won't boot when power applied I work in an environment where power is turned off to the building nightly.

I am on IOS 12.2 and it is was updated a couple weeks back without issue What did happen is that I was reading one of the PDFs and the next time I opened it, the Book app was frozen.  So, I shut off the ipad.  When I turned it back on, I realized that I went from 130 PDFs to 4 losing nearly everything.  Luckily, about 105 of the PDFs were on my iphone.  So, I quickly bought more iCloud storage and transferred that there and then those PDFs were now back to my ipad, but I did lose 25 or so documents.  I would really like to get these back and I do not know which ones I lost.\nI tried all kinds of remedies I found on the web - including one that worked after an IOS update that zapped my PDFs a couple months back (no IOS update this time):\nhttp://blog.irarott.com/blog/2018/01/17/restoring-missing-pdfs-in-ibooks/\nThere have been a few other ideas tossed around, like deleting the Books app and reinstalling it - that failed too.\nOh - and today my 105 documents became 95.\nVery trumping irritating!\nI am pretty bearish on a solution as many people appear to have this problem and have posted about it with some solutions that worked for them, but none of which worke for me on this cut.\nNot sure why such a monumental bug is so difficult for Apple to handle.\nPS:  Another thing worth mentioning is that when I re-downloaded one of the missing PDFs (Actually, the one that was frozen), the document ended up in the correct folder in my collection and when I opened it, it was on the page I was last looking at - so Book still has some kind of memory of the PDF - I just hope that it can eventually make all the missing PDFs - reappear.  It is very scary to me that I cannot trust the Book app - or even iCloud - after all, the 105 documents that became 95 today were theoretically on iCloud!\n\nA: I've had the same problem. One of my friends gave me a slew of books in ePub and PDF format. Most of them are crap, but a few I really hoped to read. The only thing that has saved me is that I have iCloud backups of my iPad Pro. \nI've also been able to recover a few by syncing with my Mac, then opening Books and going to Collections->PDFs. Then I had to manually get them back onto my iPad Pro. \n\nWhoa! Suddenly they all are there.

While this is nice in principle, the problem is that those pictures have some mbyte in size each and together they eat up my cellular data volume.\nUnfortunally, you can't tell iOS Mail not to load e-mails above a certain size (or to download those pictures automatically). You can switch off downloading images from remote servers (I did that), but that doesn't work for pictures embedded into the e-mail. Also, attachments of a certain size are not automatically downloaded, but somehow pictures are not considered to be attachments.\nMacOS Mail has the possibility to set a limit for POP accounts, above which a confimation is needed before download. Why on earth not on iOS.\nI also tried spark as an e-mail client, but I don't find that option either. And I don't find it in the description of any e-mail app.\nIs there an alternative e-mail client to support this feature?\n\nA: I think you can't stop the whole email downloading.\nThis is because an email is a stream of text the format is defined in this RFC. The programs that transmit and receive the email do not look at what the data is in the body of the email and so have to send all or nothing.\nThe files downloaded from other servers are represented in the email body as just text containing the name of the external file (a URL).\nThe mail client (the app on your iPhone) is the only software that looks at the body and it recognises certain plain text that the text after it is an encoded image.\nApple's mail clients including mail on the iPhone allows the sender to decide if large attachments are not put directly in the email body but held in iCloud as a external file so take up the small space as other external linkss..

I'm looking for a Mac program that will change the keyboard layout based on the program that is currently in use. I want it to re-map certain keys to new mappings, not change the whole keyboard layout. For example, when I'm in the finder, I have a normal Mac keyboard layout. When I'm in Vim, I want to remap the escape key to one that is more reachable. Ideally this would just happen when I'm in the program without having to choose a modified layout from the keyboards option in the menu bar.

Few months ago, around 2018 Nov, bottom of the device appears a bit uneven, with slight gap with my desk. Over past few months, it wobbles more and more serious. Today I brought it to Apple Store Singapore for diagnostic, specialist at Genius Bar confirmed that it's caused by swollen battery. Consider it was just after about 2.5 years use, I find it hard to believe. According to the staff, it depends on usage. If under heavy usage or often charge it overnight, it's normal that MacBook Pro's battery can become swollen pretty soon.\nMy battery charge cycle is under 300, battery life drops a bit but still strong (9 hours instead of 10). I rarely charge overnight, normally turn AC power off and leave my MBP in sleep mode. I do use my MBP heavily though, say 10 to 13 hours a day. However, I still find it hard to accept the explanation given by Apple Singapore.  I wonder if other MBP 15\" users experience the same? Or... am I the isolated case?\n-- edit\nTo make the question more specific, is it generally expected that, Macbookpro battery will start swelling after 2-3 years use if laptop usage is heavy, e.g. 10-13 hours a day? The concern is not about the slightly reduced battery life (the battery life is still strong), but the physical expansion. I'm asking this because I've used few other laptops before, among which I never experience battery swelling except one (after near 5 years use). If the experience with my MBP is aligned with most other users, which means it's just a matter that I should adjust my expectation, and include the near SGD300 battery cost per 2-3 years into my next purchaser's consideration; Otherwise, I will try to ask them to consider replacing without me paying the full cost.\n-- update 2019/6/21\nApple has just announced a battery recall for Macbook Pro 15\" mid-2015 model. They confirmed that these batteries may pose fire safety risk:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-sg/15-inch-macbook-pro-battery-recall\n-- update 2022/1/6\nJust to keep info in this thread up-to-date. Few months ago, the battery was again found swelling in 2021-Oct, roughly 2.5 years after the last replacement at Apple Store.\n\n*\n\n*Since last replacement, I'd been taking extra care following the battery care advice from Apple specialist.\n\n*Charge cycle count was around 350-400 (can't recall the exact number).\n\n\nA: Update: It may be worthwhile to note here, that certain 2015 MBPs are now eligible to a battery recall: https://support.apple.com/15-inch-macbook-pro-battery-recall\nAlthough I really like @Allan's compact answer (first version), I think the danger of a swollen battery should be stressed here.\n\n*\n\n*\"It happens\", however, very rarely.\n\n*It is potentially dangerous as the battery may catch fire or explode.\n\n*The device should be disconnected from the power source and not be used anymore as of now.\n\n*The battery should be replaced immediately by a professional.\n\n*Store the computer in a fire-safe environment until you get it fixed.\n\n*In case it should catch fire, emit smoke or start smelling, do not use water when trying to extinguish it as Lithium reacts with water.\n\nYou find more info here: https://www.ifixit.com/Wiki/What_to_do_with_a_swollen_battery\n\nA SWOLLEN LITHIUM-ION BATTERY MAY CATCH FIRE OR EXPLODE. PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION AND AT YOUR OWN RISK WHEN REMOVING A SWOLLEN BATTERY FROM AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE. IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO DO SO SAFELY, POWER DOWN AND ISOLATE THE DEVICE, AND CONSULT A PROFESSIONAL REPAIR TECHNICIAN IMMEDIATELY.\nRemoving a swollen battery can be hazardous, but leaving a swollen battery inside a device also poses risks. To prevent potential device and bodily harm, a device should not operate with a swollen battery. These guidelines offer best practices for removing swollen batteries, but cannot guarantee a safe repair. If you have doubts, power the device down, place it in a fireproof container, take to a repair professional and ask them to remove the faulty battery. Do not delay battery removal. If your swollen battery was purchased from iFixit, take photos of the battery before and after removing it, then contact our customer service team for warranty claims or replacement.\n\n\nA: I purchased my mid-2015 15\" MacBook Pro (top end model with dGPU) in 2016 with AppleCare.  I had zero hardware issues with it in my 3 years of use.  In August 2019 I read the news about the battery recall, so I visited Apple's website and typed in my Serial No. which said my machine was not covered in the recall.  Since my AppleCare had just expired in July, and with nothing to lose, I decided to open my bottom lid to repaste the CPU and GPU (after seeing videos on the subject) and to clean out dust.  To my surprise, I found my battery swollen.  I was very surprised because my computer reported a 92% battery health and only 183 charge cycles over the 3 years of use (which is a very low cycle count). \nWhen I telephoned Apple about my swollen battery, I asked if my leaving the MBP plugged into the official Apple power adapter most of the time could have led to a swollen battery.  They told me, \"No.\"  They then told me, \"it would be an inherent defect in the battery itself that would have led to it becoming swollen.\"  Naturally I was not pleased with myself for waiting so long to open the bottom case and check.  Had I done so during my AppleCare coverage (assuming the problem existed then), I could likely have avoided paying $200 to Apple for the replacement.  But such also indicates that Apple's battery recall program is perhaps a bit limited in that it only covers a small number of 2015 15\" models, whereas my case indicates there could be many more inherent battery defects which fall outside the coverage of the program.\nI made a video about this topic today, showing my before and after battery condition:\nhttps://youtu.be/Om1c-FCc5u0\n\nA: No, it is not “generally expected” that batteries will swell after a certain amount of time.\nWhat you have is a defective battery - it happens.  It needs to be replaced. \nThe swelling is caused by trapped off gasses from the chemical reaction not venting properly.  It could swell and not cause any issues or it could go into a condition known as thermal runaway where it will burst and catch fire igniting the off gasses in an uncontrolled manner.\nThis is not typical, but it does happen. Batteries, like everything else produced by humans, aren’t “faultless.”  Trying to pin down how common it is, is like trying to determine your odds of getting a “lemon” Toyota.  It’s rare, but it happens.\nMacBooks from 2013 on started using batteries that were glued into place requiring you to replace the entire top case.\n\nA: Yes Macbook Pro mid-2015 15\" have serious battery failure rates. Mine failed twice already, both times after 2 years, almost like clockwork. My colleagues who have their MBP from around the same time experience the same, on average every 2nd MBP in the company has had this issue, some of them have already had their 3rd battery replaced within 4 years.\nThis failure rate is not normal in any sense. Apple is just trying to do PR damage control. They replaced my first one for free even though it was out of warranty after 2 years, and per serial number not affected by the recall program (meh meh). The replacement battery was nothing better, same defective malfunctioning battery that has swollen after 2 years.\nAnd contrary to what Apple is trying to communicate, a swollen battery is a serious fire hazard: https://www.ifixit.com/Wiki/What_to_do_with_a_swollen_battery\nLook out for the class action lawsuit.\n\nA: There are no guarantees how long any battery will last or that it will or will not swell up. I have had batteries last for 6 or 7 years before losing their ability to be recharged altogether that never swelled up. If you are still under warranty, you should take it back to where you purchased it for replacement. If not,then it will be up to you to buy a new battery but be careful of low quality replacement batteries. They may be cheaper, but may not last as long or hold the same amount of charge. The cheap battery also may not respond to requests from OS X or third party software as to it's status so you won't know if there is a problem until it becomes blatantly obvious. You do have to get that swelled up battery taken care of, though. It may still hold a good charge but swelling up means there is something wrong. You don't want it to ignite or explode when you're using it and cause yourself an injury. A good quality replacement battery is cheaper than a visit to the hospital with third degree burns. \n\nA: I too facing the same problem I bought MacBook Pro-2015 mid 15.4 inches on 2017 and used it very rarely even my cycle count is 88 but from past few months I was observing the same problems you mentioned where my MacBook battery is swelling I visited apple care and my warranty is expired on Sep 2018 bad luck I didn't opt for extended apple care plan so I need to pay for the new battery replacement it was ridiculous because Apple is replacing mac book pro 2015 13inch model battery for free of cost but they refusing it for 15inch model I contacted apple care but there is no proper response from them I hope they would consider all the 15inch customers pleas and replace the battery for free of cost \n\n\n\nA: I have a mid 2015 15 inch retina Macbook Pro, and also had my battery swell. In my case it was on the top side, so my trackpad and keyboard were lifted and I was unable to close the laptop. Mine was not eligible for the recall others have linked to.\nI use it normally plugged in and very rarely disconnect it (somewhere I had read that a low battery cycle count is a sign of a healthy battery, so I decided to keep it connected as much as possible). The person said this could happen because it is plugged in all the time. He recommended to let the battery fully discharge at least once a week or two.\nEven though mine is not longer under warranty, he said that if this occurs within 3 years of purchase it is considered a manufacturing defect and the battery (and case) are replaced free of charge (I purchased it in the US but took it to an Apple Store in Spain and even here I was not charged). In my case this occurred about 2.5 months before the 3 years, so I was lucky in this sense. The replacement of battery and case would have cost 176€, so even then it would have been a reasonable price.\nAfter the battery and case are installed, there is an additional 6 months of warranty for these parts.\n\nA: [Note : This comment has been voted down as \"low quality\". Can the person tell me what is wrong, so that I can improve it ? I thought it might be useful for people to know that the defect can happen, even though the serial number is not eligible by Apple, which can be falsely reassuring. If this information not accurate enough, I will remove my comment altogether.]\nSome units can have the battery swell, although they are not eligible for the recall : I bought my MacBook Pro Mid-2015 in November 2016, and its battery started swelling in July 2020.  According to www.chipmunk.nl, my battery was produced in 2016, Week 33, which is within the timeframe reported by Apple (Sep 2015-Feb 2017).  The whole computer was manufactured in 2016, Week 35.\nMy cycle count was very low (22), and the Apple shop technician told me it that this increases the risk of having the battery swell.\nThey charged 249 euros for the battery replacement (including the top case).\nI hope that Apple will revise its eligibility criteria to include more serial numbers, when a significant number of cases will be reported.\n\nA: Mid 2015 MacBook Pro, bought in 2016, Batteries were replaced by Apple in 2019 and now in 2021 they were swollen again. I would not mind the 200€ for replacing the battery at Apple, but (1) I can not afford to have the MacBook for days in repair and (2) I don't care about the battery, as I'm always working connected to mains although in different places. I was told repeatedly by Apple, that low charge cycles (68 after two years of daily usage) is reason for battery problems. I hope this problem is solved by Apple for newer generations of MacBooks...\nSo I decided to let the air out of the batteries and it took just minutes. All you need is a Pentalobe P5 screwdriver, a needle and a bit of tape. I did drain the battery fully before opening the case for safety reasons. Mind that those 2 screws next to the hinge are shorter. Opening was a good idea as it also allowed me to remove dust and fluff from the ventilators. With a needle I punched a tiny hole into each of the swollen batteries. The air stinks, you may want to do this in a well ventilated place. I closed the small holes with a bit of tape and assembled the MacBook. Works fine so far. Swelling wasn't that bad, so now the MacBook stands properly on its pads again, all metal is back it its proper position. If anything bad should happen, I'll try to remember to post it here.

No users, no apps, nothing, just as if I got it fresh from the factory.   Just like if I never ran the restore in the first place.   But I saw it run, I was waiting for it the whole night.\n\n*I switched to CCC next.   First I had to fight with allowing booting from external devices (because of the T2 chip).  I got that sorted out by going to command-R and allowing it.\n\n*Next, even though it now let me boot external drives,  I would get the \"no-go\" icon (circle with a line through it).  I figured out that it was probably due to another incompatibility.**  So I booted the USB drive on my mac mini and successfully upgraded it to Mojave there.\n\n*After this I was able to boot into Mojave on both Mac Mini and the new MacBook Pro.  (All my files were there too)... so close....\n\n*I thought the final step would be as easy as blowing away /dev/disk1 (reformat) and then cloning from USB to /dev/disk1 using CCC.   I even gave CC extra permissions it asked for (for contacts and calendars or something like that).  It said it completed successfully but during boot (from internal SSD now with USB disconnected), it would go about 75% at the apple logo before showing \"no-go\" icon.... ARGHH!!!! ... WHY?  It only works through USB\n\n*Next I tried using disk utility to clone USB to internal HD but it completed with error \"RPC version wrong\"\n\n\nI'm out of ideas.   Why is this so hard?   Is it the damn T2 chip fighting me a each step?  Am I just doing all this wrong?  What's going on?\n** I simiplified this step a lot because the following details are not important (I hope).  In reality it was much more strange than the summary I wrote. The very first time after I successfully allowed booting from external drive, I was able to boot from the USB drive, but it popped up with a window saying that my OS was incompatible and that I should click next to upgrade to Mojave.  I didn't do it right in that moment because I didn't want to corrupt my one and only CCC backup on that USB drive.  So instead I shut the whole thing down and took a backup of my USB by doing dd on Linux.  From that moment on I was working with the clone.   To my shock, the next time I tried booting both of my USB drives went straight into the \"no-go\" icon .. I wasn't prompted to do the upgrade to Mojave as I have been prompted before.  Somehow that Mojave upgrade offer was a one shot deal.   That's what gave me the idea to boot up on my Mac Mini, upgrade to Mojave inside there and then carry on.  That worked (for a while) if you keep reading on.  \n\nA: Use “Migration Assistant” instead of attempting a direct restore. This mitigates hardware change issues, T2 issues, minor OS difference issues, some software licensing issues, and a few other potential issues. \n", "Q: How do I configure Time Machine to backup my Macs to iCloud? I have the 2 TB iCloud storage plan and back up my iPhones and iPads there. How do I configure Time Machine to do the same with my MacBook Pro's and Mac Mini's?\n\nA: You cannot officially back up a Mac to iCloud at this time.\nIf you want to write a program that does this, you could utilize CloudKit. This would be beyond the scope of a single Stack Overflow question, so I'll just link to the CloudKit documentation here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/\n", "Q: My AppleCare is about to expire with my battery at 81%. Is there a good way to get it to 79% so I can get a new battery? AppleCare covers the replacement of a MacBook Pro battery if it drops below 80% capacity before 1000 cycles. I have until the end of the year and I'm at 81% and 300 cycles. It would be nice to get a new battery in exchange for the $379(?!!!) I spent for AppleCare. I'll get an extra year of warranty since I purchased it on my American Express, but I would like to get something out of what I paid for AppleCare+ rather than pay $200 for a new battery and harass my credit card company into reimbursing me.\nAny thoughts on what to do? Will Apple give me a new battery if I tell them I'm 1% away?\n\nA: What’s the harm in asking them to diagnose your battery and not even say anything about wanting a free swap? See what they say and document they had a chance to diagnose things before the warranty ends.\nMy feeling and expectation is Apple would not offer to replace things unless you have them perform diagnostics and they see something amiss or feel it’s about to fail. I also see +- 5% FCC estimate when I run things from day to day, so I wouldn’t worry about +- 1% either to be eligible for a swap on the pooled plan (you are pooling risk - so it’s not free, it’s paid for out of the pool). It’s also not free since you would waste a 80% good battery that might last for years if your assumption that the only thing wrong would be measured capacity below 80% FCC within 3 years of delivery.\nThe 80% FCC is the standard, so it’s understandable for you to look at things around that as a line, since Apple established that design line and goal, but in practice, 60% FCC still gives a lot of run time and sometimes it’s not even worth paying for batteries below 40% or less. For some needs 40% FCC is perfectly serviceable and causes no real harm.\nAppleCare plans are pro-rated and you’re paying for the term benefit (just like paying in for insurance of any kind) and no one gets to collect for “close to needing care” or a refund if you don’t use the benefit. Of course, you can cancel the coverage any time before it ends (and then the return is pro-rated). If you really think through the coverage, I think you’ll join me in “not wanting to get something for your payments” since the FCC is just one aspect of performance.\nI would hope Apple wouldn’t replace the battery unless they feel it’s not performing, so I would just get it service diagnosed now and then about 2 weeks before the end of the coverage (or anytime you see 75% FCC). Since Apple can run diagnostics remotely , you can get a quick diagnosis and chance Apple would want to swap out parts (maybe something other than the battery needs service).\nIn the end, I gladly pay for battery service when it’s needed and if it takes 3 years to get to 80% FCC you might have another 1-3 years before the charge falls off and only have AppleCare and a $90 or so service for 6 years of productive use of a Mac spanning one original battery.\nSo in the end I would recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*read up and learn what the numbers mean\n\n*talk about the trade offs - some are being green, some are being frugal and not wasting time / resources / materials\n\n*balance the potential harm if you don’t get it serviced - your time is also valuable - driving in or having to go back for a repeat test also wastes resources\n\n*my experience is that when batteries are just being exhausted, they don’t fall sharply and any 5 to 9% change is meaningless to the eventual out of service date.\n\n*my experience is that when batteries fail, they plummet in days or weeks and Apple still covers them even after since they were at 85% and now are at 45% within a short period of the end of warranty.\n\n\nA: I had a similar situation: Apple's diagnostics revealed that battery was failing, but not failing enough to warrant a replacement.\nHowever, by smiling sweetly, and asking nicely, and joking with the Store guy, he went to his boss to ask if they could take it in anyway. They did.\nSo, that's worth a shot.\n", "Q: Minimum required specs of a Mac for iOS App development I'm planing to develop an app with React Native for Android and iOS. I need to buy a Mac to run Xcode for iOS app development.\nI do not have a high budget, which is why I would prefer to buy a (used) Mac with the minimum required specifications that is able to run the latest version of Xcode and iPhone simulator. The app I want to develop is mostly running in the background, so there will be no heavy graphics or computations.\nI know this has been asked before, but it's been a few years since then, that's why I ask again.\nI'm happy about any comments about RAM, Processor, manufacturing year or anything else.\nEdit (November 2019):\nJust wanted to give future visitors an update: I spent a few hours to test macinacloud, however since it felt pretty slow and a bit overcomplicated,  in the end I decided to get a used Mac Mini from late 2014 with 8 GB RAM. In general I am very happy with it, everything works fine (not super fast, but not too slow either). Sometimes I am hitting the limits (for example when running an iOS simulator and having too many other programs running at the same time), however I am always able to just close the ones I am not using right now and get everything to run fluently again.\nThanks for the advice everyone, I hope this can help some other iOS-developement-beginners :)\n\nA: Xcode 10 is available in the Mac App Store and includes SDKs for iOS 12, watchOS 5, macOS 10.14, and tvOS 12. Xcode 10 supports on-device debugging for iOS 8 and later, tvOS 9 and later, and watchOS 2 and later. Xcode 10 requires a Mac running macOS 10.13.6 or later.\nAny 64-bit Mac with 8 GB of RAM and at least 200GB of disk space should do, if you don't care much about your time (compiles can be slow).\nIf I were scraping rock bottom, I would head over to https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac and wait for an 8 GB Mac Mini to show up. Check every morning around 8 AM PDT and again at 5 PM PDT. Be patient...which will prepare you for compiles that take 10 minutes each turn, but it'll work.\nYou'll still need a keyboard, mouse and monitor obviously, but you can get those at Best Buy refurbished. Also, consider Craigslist.org and any other site where you can buy used Macs.\n\nA: What I can definitely say is that a 2012 Mac Mini with 4 GB of RAM and a mechanical hard disk is not up to the task at all. Xcode 11 needs several minutes alone to launch, and launching a single simulator takes anywhere from 20 minutes to half an hour. Not recommended!\n\nA: It looks like apple now maintains a table at https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/ listing each xcode version and supported development targets.\nThe specs of the machine you need depend on what MacOS and Xcode versions it is able to support.\nThe version of Xcode you want to run depends on what devices and software versions of Apple products you want to develop for as well as if you intend to upload to Apple's app store.\nIf you do intend to upload to the app store, then this answer linking to this page from apple may help you. A little ways down the page the current minimum supported version of xcode for uploading to the app store is listed and, according to the answer, is updated every April. Currently it reads:\n\nAs of April 2022, all iOS apps submitted to the App Store must be built with Xcode 13 and the SDK for iOS 15.\n\n", "Q: View printers from Windows Print Server on a Mac On windows, \n\nGet-Printer -ComputerName \\\\XXX\n\nwill give me a list of printers that exist on that print server.

I'm currently able to connect 2 monitors using HDMI-Thunderbolt 3 cables, but I'm unable to get the 3rd monitor to detect a signal. I have a 3rd HDMI-Thunderbolt 3 cable, and I also have a VGA to HDMI adapter I can use as well.\nIf I plug the VGA-HDMI cable into he HDMI port on the Mini, the two functioning monitors begin to flicker. The third monitor is still not detecting a signal. \nThe monitor is a 1920x1080, 75 Hz\nHas anyone successfully configured a 2018 Mac Mini to 3 monitors using one of these configurations?\nThanks!\n\nA: You can’t use three Thunderbolt 3 ports to drive three displays.   You can accomplish this by connecting two Thunderbolt 3 to HDMI adapters/cables and one HDMI to HDMI/VGA/DVI adapter via the HDMI port.\nA couple of things to consider when connecting monitors:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use native signals rather than convert.  Thunderbolt 3 is also DisplayPort, so it’s better to go from TB3 to mDP/DP\n\n*If you must convert video signals, use an active adapter instead as it actually recreate the native video signal\n\nA: According to Apple\n\nUp to three displays: Two displays with 4096-by-2304 resolution at\n60Hz connected via Thunderbolt 3 plus one display with 4096-by-2160\nresolution at 60Hz connected via HDMI 2.0 [...]\n\nSo it is important to not exceed the maximum resolution supported.\nYour 1080p Monitors seem to meet that spec so you will need to look at your cabling setup. It is good that you got the Thunderbolt to work, can you attach the third monitor via the Mini's HDMI port?\n\nA: See https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/specs/\nI think you're getting into trouble by trying to run a monitor at 75 Hz. Either lower the resolution or the refresh rate. Try 800x600@60. Once that's stable, step it up a notch until you know the limits.\nI would also be susipscious of the quality of your HDMI to VGA adapter/cable. Does your monitor have an HDMI connector or perhaps DVI or mini-Displayport? VGA should always be the last alternative; things get freaky when you introduce analog to the mix.\n", "Q: Desktop shows only background image – how to return to default behavior? I have an iMac running macOS High Sierra. Recently I setup my system so that my Desktop does not show the connected drives and doesn't show anything on my Desktop.\nMy desktop is completely clean. I also had many files and folders on my desktop. All those are hidden as well. I can't remember how I did that and now I'd like to change settings or turn it off but can't. Does anyone know how you would do what I have done and can tell me?\nI have all the boxes checked in the Finder preferences panel so thats not the issue.\nI remember a pull down menu with several options for displaying the desktop. I just don't recall how I got to the pull down menu.\n\nA: In Finder, go to menu item Finder > Preferences and you will see your options there.\n \n\nA: The description of the problem in question is possibly a bit ambiguous. But the most common causes for these symptoms are: \n\n\n*\n\n*The individual Finder preferences are one option, described in wch1spink's answer. But with these options deselected regular files should still appear on the Desktop.\n\n*Another option would be using the defaults-system (as often this variable is set to a certain state by many 3rd party GUI tools of the type \"CustimzeHiddenFeatures\" as well, as described by user3439894' answer). With the following variable set to false only the Desktop background picture is shown, regardless whether any files exist at the path ~/Desktop/:\nTo check whether this was done, enter in Terminal:\n defaults read com.apple.finder CreateDesktop\n\nIf that shows as result: \"The domain/default pair of (com.apple.finder, CreateDesktop) does not exist\", the following will not do much.\nIf the result is shown as: \"false\", then proceed, as we've found the problem:\nTo hide desktop icons, copy and paste each of these into Terminal\n defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop false \n killall Finder\n\nTo show desktop icons again, (i.e. the default state, even the variable is unset)\n defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop true  \n killall Finder\n\nalternatively, completely unset the variable and let the defaults take over again:\n defaults delete com.apple.finder CreateDesktop\n killall Finder\n\nSo in this case one of the last two commands would be the one needed to reverse the situation of unwanted barrenness of the Finder's desktop.\n\nA: One possibility is if you used a tool like OnyX.\nAs shown in the image further below, with the Hide the desktop icons check box ticked, and with all the Finder > Preferences > General > Show the items on the desktop: still ticked, there will be no icons on the Desktop.\nAdditionally, the output of defaults read com.apple.finder CreateDesktop in Terminal will be: 0\nThe default setting for CreateDesktop in the com.apple.finder.plist file the preference key is non-existent, so if it is set and the icons are hidden, then to return to the default setting, run the following compound command in Terminal: \ndefaults delete com.apple.finder CreateDesktop; killall Finder\n\nThere is also an app called TinkerTool that has some Finder settings that may do the same thing.\n\n\nA: Finder Preferences-> General. Turn off showing everything.\nSet your dock to auto-hide. Set the menu bar to auto-hide (both from System Preferences).\n", "Q: Transfer MKV files to VLC player on iPhone using Airdrop I Airdropped a folder containing MKV files from my Mac to my iPhone. Where can I spot them on my iPhone 8?\nI am not able to see the Folder with the files. They don't seem to appear in VLC app as well.\nHow do I wirelessly (such as using AirDrop) transfer files to VLC player on my iPhone from my Mac?\n\nA: First of all, let us see what happens when you transfer MKV files to iPhone via AirDrop.\nIf you are successfully able to complete the file transfer of MKV file(s) from your Mac to iPhone, you will see an alert like one of these:\n \nIf you choose to save it to iCloud Drive, you will be able to see them after installing Files app for iOS by Apple.\nOnce installed, open Files app, tap on Browse tab and select iCloud Drive to view the file.\n\n\nHowever, it turns out that it is not serving the purpose that you are looking for, i.e. to transfer the files using AirDrop to VLC media player app on your iPhone. Transferring via AirDrop doesn't appear to be achieving the intended purpose. \nHowever, there's an easy and very similar approach you can take to archive the desired end result. VLC iOS app has a feature called Sharing via WiFi. Launch VLC app on your iPhone, tap on the VLC icon at top left corner and tap on Share via WiFi. You'll get an IP address as shown:\n\nMake sure your iPhone and Mac are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Now, simply access the IP address shown in any Web browser on your Mac and you'll get this:\n\nSimply drag and drop the desired files that you wish to transfer to VLC app on your iPhone into the browser window. Keep an eye on the progress indicator:\n\nVoila! your files now show up in VLC app on your iPhone.\nDo note that for the file transfer to complete successfully, you'll need to make sure that the VLC app keeps running in the foreground on your iPhone and it doesn't go into sleep mode.\n", "Q: Skype for Business has no sound and I am not able to make calls So first of all I have checked sounds settings, tested normal Skype client, updated Skype for Business, uninstalled and re-installed it, etc. and my microphone and speaker are working as expected in regular Skype client and in general.\nBut when I join a meeting with Skype for Business, I can't hear anyone speak and they don't seem to see me as a participant in the conversation. My mic is muted right away and the button is disabled. I have tested meetings created by my self, and ones created by others. I also seem to being having troubles calling others (one to one). It gives me the classic sound from Skype when calling but the others are not receiving the call. My college then tried to call me and that worked fine, calls and sound was fine.\nI just experienced that when joining the meeting my colleague says I have a status as \"Not in the call\" when he howers over my icon and after waiting a bit I actually got a message from Skype saying that the call could not be made. So maybe when I am joining the meeting I am actually not with the voice call - and I cant make calls directly to others.\nMaking calls/joining meetings from my windows laptop works.. but not from my macbook.\n\n\n\nAny ideas how to resolve this?\nI am running Skype for Business version 16.26.19 on a 15\" 2018 MacBook Pro running macOS Mojave.\n\nA: Apparently (according to IT) a restart of the Exchange server and the Skype server (in the right order) was enough to solve the issue.\n", "Q: Should I use the manufacture's print driver instead of secure AirPrint? I've noticed that macOS appears to default to using secure AirPrint as it's printer driver over the manufacture's printer driver. Any reason why I should choose one over the other?\n\nA: Consider this.\nIn the near future, there will be a macOS update. Your printer manufacturer may or may not release a timely driver update that matches the updated OS. As a result, your system may become unstable, not be able to print or worse. \nMy strong suggestion is that, unless there's some mission-critical functionality you need, it's always best to go with the built-in drivers. With it, there's a much higher probability that your system will remain stable through multiple OS updates.\n", "Q: Unable to delete files & folders from my USB drive I got this USB stick with some music on it.

The filesystem on USB drive is NTFS.\n\nA: Your USB drive is formatted with NTFS file system. By default, macOS can only read a drive formatted with NTFS file system. It does not include drivers to write to NTFS filesystem.\nTo delete (technically writing, i.e. making changes) the files and folders on NTFS formatted drive, you'll need drivers for NTFS to be installed on your Mac.\nIf you wish to remove all the contents of the USB drive and use it on computers running macOS, Windows and any Linux distribution, it is recommended to format it with ExFAT or MS-DOS (FAT) file system by using Disk Utility app.\n", "Q: Any way to reset volume level after unplugging headphones? I have a MacBook Pro, running Mojave, that I take between work and home. \nWhen at home, I plug a set of speakers into the headphone jack and play music through the speakers.

I'm unable to resize the window. Any ideas how can I fix this?\n\nA: The easiest way I've found to bring a window back from under the Menu bar is to resize the window by pressing and holding the shift key and grabbing the left or right side edge of the window and dragging the mouse inwards towards the center of the window.\nThis resizes all four sides of the window at the same time, thus making it smaller and bringing the top of the window out from under the Menu bar.\nYou can then afterwards move and or resize the window as wanted on the screen.\n\nA: I hate it when that happens.\nTry doing the four-finger swipe up (Mission Control), then drag Firefox lower on the screen.\nIf that doesn't work, try killing Firefox by right-clicking on its icon in the Dock and clicking Quit.\n\nA: A very simple solution is to temporarily hide the Menu bar.

So I've used the search bar to find this app:\n\nand it seemed like its hidding in the system files when I taped on it led me to the iCloud interface.\nSo first of all is it a spyware?  If yes, then how can I prove it and get information about who installed it (like getting the IP address it is sending information to for example)?\nAnd finally, how can I get rid of it?\nP.S.: Note that the official News app from Apple is called 'Apple News' and has an icon: Apple News Homepage\n\nA: The entry that you see corresponds to Apple's News app. The icon isn't displayed because you don't have the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nAfter setting the two-factor authentication system on it earlier this week, a connection attempt has been made by someone else (I've received an authentication code on my second phone when I clearly didn't try to connect in any way).\n\nThere is apparently no unintended connection attempt.

Is there a way to stop iOS from ending apps when idling? It's terribly frustrating to have watched parts of a Youtube video, then have iOS quit it. Unless I wrote down the time-stamp, I would have no idea where I left off. Is there a way to stop iOS from ending apps when idling? Thank you!\n\nA: iOS automatically quits apps which haven't been used for some time, especially if available memory required for the active apps runs low. There is no setting to disable that (which probably wouldn't be a good idea anyway as it would block other apps from getting loaded/started).\nBut usually apps get notified before they get unloaded and are supposed to store their current state (including for instance the playback position for YouTube) so they can restore it when you switch back to them/restart them.

I really would like to not have to have two calendar apps if possible.  I poked around in the Mac calendar settings and didn’t see a way to share one calendar without having to add her account (which I don’t want to do).

But for the errors, I use this to create error logs.\nThe problem is that what I'm getting in my error logs is often not errors. For example, the error log for my launchd VPN script writes every incoming VPN connection to the error log. \n2019-05-04 06:33:43 EDT Server 'com.apple.ppp.l2tp' starting...\n2019-05-04 06:33:43 EDT Loading plugin /System/Library/Extensions/L2TP.ppp\n2019-05-04 06:33:43 EDT Listening for connections...\n2019-05-04 06:34:23 EDT Incoming call...

Address given to client = [redacted]\n\nThat doesn't look like error output. That looks like regular old normal, no problem output. The two \"calls\" were me connecting and disconnecting from the VPN normally.\nWhat is going on here? It's possible I'm not fully understanding what stderr and stdout actually are. Does this make sense to anyone?\nI'll have more examples in a few hours once more scripts run, as I have intentionally flushed all these logs.\n\nA: There is nothing wrong with the output you are capturing.\nConvention Only\nDevelopers are free to output anything they want to stdout and stderr. Convention suggests passing error related output to stderr but nothing enforces this choice.\nIn this instance the php script authors have written debug or progress information to stderr. I presume they expected stderr to be ignored, until a problem needs debugging.\nSee Confused about stdin, stdout and stderr? for a detailed question and answer on the subject.\n", "Q: PF Firewall : Every time I use `pfctl`, I get errors about ALTQ support I have a slightly elaborate firewall setup where my server usually has between 400 and 800 ip addresses firewalled. It switches back and forth between two different pf tables. Every day it rebuilds the firewall list in the new table and flushes the old one. It does this all via script and it works very well.\nBut the problem is this ALTQ error. Every time you use pfctl for anything, the first thing it does is output two error lines:\nNo ALTQ support in kernel\nALTQ related functions disabled\n\nProblem is my script runs pfctl hundreds of times per day. The error log for my script is growing WAY too fast. \nIs there any way to suppress these error messages? pfctl does have a -q flag but that's only for ignoring non-error output. Is there a way I can more fully disable ALTQ in the config file so it won't even try to use it? \nNote that I don't know what ALTQ is, but I know I don't need it. My firewall works perfectly aside from the log flood.\n\nA: I am probably missing something, because this does not seem to be a complex question. If you what to screen out these 2 error messages, then enter the command given below.\npfctl >2 >(grep -v -e \"No ALTQ support in kernel\" -e \"ALTQ related functions disabled\" 1>&2)\n\nI omitted any parameters that would normally occur between pfctl and >2. A function could be defined which would simplify the use of this command. One such function implementation is shown below.\npfctl() {\n    command pfctl \"$@\" >2 >(grep -v -e \"No ALTQ support in kernel\" -e \"ALTQ related functions disabled\" 1>&2)\n}\n\nUnder certain conditions, the above solution could result in the output appearing \"out of order\". This could be corrected by piping the output through the cat command. In other words, you could use the command given below.\npfctl >2 >(grep -v -e \"No ALTQ support in kernel\" -e \"ALTQ related functions disabled\" 1>&2) | cat\n\nAlso the function could be replaced with the one given below.\npfctl() {\n    command pfctl \"$@\" >2 >(grep -v -e \"No ALTQ support in kernel\" -e \"ALTQ related functions disabled\" 1>&2) | cat\n}\n\nReferences\nBash Redirections Cheat Sheet\n\nA: This means that the macOS kernel is missing ALTQ support. Basically, ALTQ are optional various queues in the kernel used by pf(4) for better packets queueing. All of them are disabled inside the kernel and there's no option to enable it. \nIn your case you might just ignore these lines.\nIn other OS like OpenBSD or FreeBSD, you can compile kernel with ALTQ enabled (it's a compile-time feature)\n\nA: I am just having the same problem as yours in a shell script.\nI resolved it by writing the pfctl command this way :\nsudo pfctl -s info 2> /dev/null\n\nThis send the error output to trash but keeps the standard output.\nI found the answer here : https://www.baeldung.com/linux/silencing-bash-output\n", "Q: Mojave bootcamp assistant limits partition size MacBook Air 2015, Mojave installed, 125 GB flashdrive \nWe had a VM for windows, but with installing Mojave, deleted everything additional down to bare Mac OS and tried to install W10 with boot camp assistant (BCA).

While the use of a flash drive is not required, the procedure is simplified when one is employed. A Microsoft recommended install of W10 involves creating 3 new partitions which are listed below.\n\n\n*\n\n*A Microsoft Reserved (MSR) partition of about 16 MB.\n\n*A Windows partition of at least 20 GB.\n\n*A recovery tools partition (WRE) of about 800 MB.\n\n\nEven though Microsoft recommends a MSR, often the Boot Camp Assistant does not create this partition and Windows apparently works correctly when omitted. If the WRE partition is not created, then the software normally installed in this partition will be installed in the Windows partition. So technically, you only need the Windows partition. You can manually create the other partitions, but again this complicates the installation procedure. The exact Microsoft document explaining these requirements can be found at the Microsoft website UEFI/GPT-based hard drive partitions. Note: This document states the WRE should be 500 MB, but with the current W10 release, the size needs to be 800 MB. So, if you wish to create the three partitions, then the procedure would be as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the flash drive.\n\n*When the first Windows 10 installation screen appears, enter a shift+F10 to open a Command Prompt window.\n\n*Run the diskpart command to create the partitions. In other words, create free space by deleting the single partition you created using macOS and create the three partitions in the free space.\n\n*Close the Command Prompt windows an proceed with the installation of Windows.\n\n\nInstructions for creating a USB Windows 10 installer flash drive can be found as part of the accepted answer to Boot Camp Assistant fails to create the USB installer from the Windows 10 October 2018 Update.\n\nNote: When installing using a flash drive, the Mac may reboot back to macOS before Windows finishes installing. If this happens, the select Windows from the \"Startup Disk\" pane of the \"System Preferences\" application, then click on the \"Restart\" button. The Windows installation process will pick up from where it left off.\n\nSteps to Download the Windows Support Software\nThis example as done using a iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013) running macOS Mojave Version 10.14.4.\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the Finder application, open the Applications folder. Next, open the Utilities folder, which can be found in the Application folder.\n\n*Open the Boot Camp Assistant, which can be found in the Utilities folder.\n\n*From the menu bar, select Action, then Download Windows Support Software.\n\n\n*In the popup window, select where to store the download. In the image shown below, the Downloads folder was selected.\n\n\n*Below is an image of what to expect during the download.\n\n\n*Below is an image of what is shown when downloading completes. Some of the Windows Support Software files may be needed during the installation of Windows. Therefore, even though you are suppose to run the Windows Support Software application (Setup.exe) after installing Windows, you still need to copy this software to the same flash drive containing the Windows ISO files.  \n\nInstalling Without the Windows Recovery Environment (WRE) Partition\n\nNote: You probably can skip step 2.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the Windows 10 flash drive.\n\n*In this case, you will not need to use the diskpart command. However, you still could use the diskpart command to view the partitioning of the drives. When the image below appears, press the key combination shift+F10 to open a Command Prompt Window. \n\nEnter the following commands.\ndiskpart\nlist disk\nselect disk 0\nlist partition\nlist volume\nexit\n\nYour results should be similar to what is shown in the image below.\n\nNote: The output from list disk command must show a * in the Gpt column for Disk 0.\n\n\nAfter entering the exit command to close the Command Prompt window, proceed with the installation.\n\n*If you encounter the image shown below, select Custom: Install Windows only (advanced).\n\n\n*When the image shown below appears, select Drive 0 Partition 3. \n\n\n*Confirm the selected partition is approximately 75 GB. Next, click on the Delete button, then click on the OK button in the popup window.\n\n\n*When the image shown below appears, select Drive 0 Unallocated Space.\n\n\n*Confirm the selected unallocated space is approximately 75 GB. Next, click on the New button, then click on the Apply button. Click on the OK button in the popup window.\n\n\n*The result should appear similar to what is shown below. Confirm the selected partition is approximately 75 GB. Click on the Next button to continue with the installation of Windows.\n\nNote: If you do not what a Microsoft Reserved (MSR) partition, then you can delete the partition before proceeding. In this example, I did not delete this partition. \n\n\n", "Q: Requirements for restoring a Time Machine backup from a sparsebundle? I have a Time Machine sparsebundle backup on an NTFS volume on a USB drive. When I wanted to restore from it I connected it and the volume was mounted as read-only, but  I was unable to mount the sparsebundle and migration assistant didn't offer it as a source to restore from.\nAfter copying the sparsebundle to a read-write HFS+ volume (on a USB drive) I was offered the option to restore from it, leading to my question.\nWhat are the requirements to be able to restore from a sparsebundle? Is it that the containing volume is writable, or something else?\nBackground\nI'm doing my backups over SMB, so I want a file system that's journalled on Linux (i.e. I can't use HFS+) and from which I can restore when using it as a USB drive (so far not NTFS). I'm aware of paid drivers for NTFS on macOS, but I'm initially looking for a free solution for Mojave.\nThe ntfs-3g project seemed completely dead judging by its website, and the install/compile instructions seemed lacking and outdated (packages from 2015 as opposed to the latest release in 2017).\n\nA: I have experienced problems using sparsebundles on APFS volumes, whereby writing ~50gb lead to a backup that had incorrect checksums (determined by running tmutil verifychecksums and seeing a failure).\nI then switch to using sparsebundles on HFS+ volumes, and no more problems.\nWorth mentioning that you are probably using sparsebundles that are themselves HFS+ formatted, if you are using them for Time Machine.\nIf I had to take a guess, I would say it probably has more to do with the filesystem that the sparsebundle lives on (not the filesystem internal to the sparsebundle)... and less to do with the read/write vs read-only issue.  You can test this simply...  try to mount your sparsebundle while it lives on a read-only HFS+ volume... does that work? (can you mount?)\nYes, I realize that the filesystem where the sparsebundle lives should not matter, but I have myself seen that sometimes it does.  One reason is quite simply that filesystems themselves have bugs.  APFS, NTFS, and HFS are no exception to this.\nAs some further detail, I noticed that verifying checksums for a sparsebundle on an APFS volume took significantly longer than performing the same operation on a similar sparsebundle on an HFS+ volume.  \n", "Q: Hard Drive Full, can't figure out why My mac recently started to indicate that the startup disk was full.

Why is that? I have read online, from multiple sources, that icloud drive is like Google drive or Dropbox, so why would iCloud drive take up 58 GB on my internal drive. I thought putting files in the iCloud drive was storing them in the cloud.  Google drive and Dropbox doesn't take up a lot of space on my internal drive. Why is iCloud Drive using so much space on my internal drive?\n\nA: Depending on settings, for both Dropbox and iCloud the files may continue to take up space on the originating computer, and on any computer that has been \"synced\" to allow offline usage of the files.\nFor iCloud you control this behavior by the storage preferences:\nOpen \"About This Mac\" from the Apple () menu, then click Storage. There is an overview of your free space, space used by different types of files, and options for optimizing usage.\n\nA: iCloud is different from Google and Dropbox in that it's not primarily an external storage; it's a syncing solution. \nThis means that files you put in iCloud are available and accessible from every device that’s signed in from that same Apple ID.\nTo do this, it has to keep a purgeable copy of your data in each device.  It will periodically sync changes to the files across all your devices. \nSo you can use iCloud like you use Dropbox and Google but those service have a fundamentally different purpose than iCloud. \n\nA: MacWorld says (and I seem to recall hearing the same) that the files stored in iCloud on your local drive are essentially a local cache and as such generally purgeable if you start running out of space on your local drive.\nBasically it is there to give you faster access to some files, and on the chance that you need one of those files when you have no network.\n", "Q: How do I get Split Screen to work on an iPad I have a 6th generation iPad running iOS 12.2. I have tried Split Screen (as described in Use Multitasking on your iPad), but can't seem to get it to work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open an app.\n\n*Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to reveal the Dock.\n\n*On the Dock, touch and hold the second app that you want to open, then drag it off the Dock.\n\n*When the app opens in Slide Over, drag the dash icon down.\nAfter point #2, I see the Dock (and a normal home screen) - not sure if this is intended. When I try point #3, it just seems to rearrange apps on the Home screen.\nI have Multitasking features turned on.\n\nA: When you swipe up, swipe up just a little so the dock shows.

They couldn't figure out so an engineer is gonna take a look at log files.\n\nA: https://1password.community/discussion/30286/mrcs-convert-to-1password-utility-mrc-converter-suite\nYou'll find a dropbox link there. Download it, and follow the instructions to run the AppleScript for Safari 11/12. It will run for a while and collect every password item from Safari preferences and in the end, write them to a CSV file.\nThat can be converted further to other password manager formats including Chrome, Firefox, 1password etc.\n\nA: Engineer responded with something like \"While third parties may support exporting from iCloud and previous versions may support it, current macOS versions doesn't support it by default. But it maybe supported in future.\".\nBased on how low level the error message is, I suspect that this feature was broken unintentionally and Apple is just too lazy to fix it. I interpret the engineer's statement as something to the effect of \"Oops, we broke some really useful thing that some people used, and we are too lazy to fix it so I am just gonna say its not supported anymore, but give a cushion of 'we may support in the future' incase someone complains enough and we do decide to put it back in.\".\nPretty annoyed tbh. It appears...\nDue to Apples special encryption method used for iCloud keychains, it is nearly impossible for a third party to decrypt it, even with the password and due to whatever reason, Apple has stopped supported exporting to local keychain, which can be decrypted by third parties.\nAfter looking more into it, the entire implementation seems to be open source. If anyone with the skill would like to take the time to figure out how to decrypt it, that'd be pretty cool.

You may need to manually reinstall any user-installed CPAN modules again afterwards. \n", "Q: Use Apple Watch LTE data for hotspot I'm paying $10/month for LTE data for my Apple Watch series 4 on Verizon. That gives me 15GB of hotspot data on it and unlimited data for use from the watch.\nHowever, my usage always shows 0 bytes. I'm always out of hotspot data so I would love to slurp that 15GB on my laptop, but I can't find any method of using my Apple Watch as a hotspot. For that matter, it looks like as long as my iPhone is around, I never actually use the LTE data on my watch, or it's such a tiny amount of data that it never reaches .01 GB.\nHow can I make use of my LTE data plan on my Apple Watch?\n\nA: TLDR - Could Apple do this with a quick update - of course it’s technically possible. Will Apple do so? I expect this decision to ensure battery use is minimized to hold, but who knows what new hardware might do efficiently or if software in the future is allowed to spend more watch battery energy on this feature.\n\nOn a technical level, with the current iOS/iPadOS/watchOS throttling background data connections at 30 seconds in general when it used to be 10 minutes, there is no way you’ll be able to fit that much data through the watch hardware. My opinion is the carriers can easily offer unlimited “watch data” knowing it’s highly constrained by the hardware to short bursts of data. It would be a triumph to accumulate a GB of watch data with the hardware and software going into 2020.\nYou are correct that if the watch is on WiFi - it will tunnel all data over that and if that doesn’t work, then the watch will talk to your iPhone over bluetooth to avoid running the LTE on the watch.\nWatchOS will only consume cellular as the last resort and certainly the tethering code is disabled on watchOS as well to save power and allow it to run as described above.\nIf cost savings is your desire, consider dropping LTE on the watch and seeing if you can manage without it and fund more phone data instead of the typical $10 monthly fee for the watch specific data connection.\n\nA: As per your intent to know about whether the watch can tether or not, here are two comments, by people on the internet, just like us:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*I doubt it. I can't see the watch modem being able to push enough data to a device to be of use.\n  \n*Doubt it and that would also murder your watch battery in a quick minute.\n\nhttps://forums.imore.com/apple-watch-series-3/393615-can-apple-watch-3-used-hotspot-tether-other-devices.html\n\nThis one by person with ~23k points on Apple Forum:\n\nNo, your Apple Watch is not capable of acting as a hotspot to support other devices on cellular or WiFi. Your iPhone should be able to support the iPad using Personal Hotspot.\n\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/8627662\n\n\nTurning on cellular for extended periods uses more battery power. Also, some apps might not update without a connection to your iPhone. \n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-in/HT207578\n\nAdding my two cents: If there's no On/Off switch, then there's no feature. \n", "Q: f3 Fight Flash Fraud: \"f3probe command not found\" Mac OS Mojave I'm testing SD Flash Cards and my linux machine decided to be rude and stop operating the SD Card Reader (time for a USB device).

I believe the thunderbolt port puts out 9.9 W max and this display Power Consumption(Typical):<7.5W* *measuring a screen brightness of 200 nits without audio/ USB/ Card reader connection)\nbasically I need a second portable screen 13\" - 15\" preferably type C like a large variety of modern displays available as mentioned above, preferably powered from the adapted thunderbolt 2 port etc, that way when I update the Macbook Pro later the screen will be usable on any updated model with Thunderbolt 3...\nIt doesn't have to be the above mentioned Asus screen but it looks the goods and no less then 1920x1080. I am not against the idea of utilizing the two thunderbolt ports one for display and one to power said display if required OR even use the HDMI port etc...  just as long as it works and powered by the Macbooks ports as the Macbook can be running from the wall charger as required...  \nAgain a portable setup preferably single cable.    recommendations and ideas much appreciated.\n\nA: No.  This will not work.  You will need to get a display with its own power supply.\nThunderbolt 1/2 doesn’t support power delivery.  Even though Thunderbolt 3 does, connecting an adapter doesn’t magically make power appear.\nThe (up-to) 9W of power is bus power - you can’t  assume that because it’s there, it can be utilized, especially to power a device.  Remember, Thunderbolt can support up to 6 devices, so it wouldn’t make sense that a single device allocate most or all of the bus power.\n\nA: I agree with other answers that this will not work but for a different reason.  A Thunderbolt adapter will not work because this is not a Thunderbolt device.  This is a DisplayPort device.  To get video to this display means using a DisplayPort cable.  Because DisplayPort does not provide power to the device this display will not work with a mini-DP to USB-C cable.  DisplayPort specifies that both the source and sink are to supply power to the cable.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#DP_PWR_(pin_20)  This is so that there is power for active or amplified cables.\nWhat should work is a Thunderbolt dock.  A common Thunderbolt 3 dock should work so long as it provide the necessary 7.5 watts on a downstream USB-C port that supports USB and DP.  The upstream port will be USB-C as well but a TB2 to TB3 adapter to the laptop will provide the necessary connection.\nIn reading reviews of people using TB3 docks with TB2 hosts the downstream USB ports will still work as it seems every TB3 dock has a USB controller in them.\nThis is not a low cost solution and so I don't expect people to just run out to buy a TB3 dock to plug in a portable USB-C display.  For those that already have a dock this is a workable solution.  There may be another similar case that this information is helpful.\nThis is an educated guess, I have not tried this myself, so if there is someone that tried this and it does not work then I'd appreciate feedback.\nI realize this is an old question and a resolution has been found but this question popped up and I thought I'd offer an alternative to those with a similar problem.\n", "Q: What is the function of `Library/Application Support/updater_mcy/updater_mcy` file?

I'd like to keep the original versions of the iOS apps instead of upgrading them to the latest available from the App Store.\nIs is possible?\n\nA: This used to be possible up to iTunes 12.6\nIndividual .ipa files for each app were stored on the user's local computer & could be restored to a new device [assuming they were capable of running on it].\nSince 12.7, iTunes no longer keeps copies of .ipa files & after a new device install, apps are downloaded direct from the App Store - these will always be latest versions.\nApple did keep a special corporate version of iTunes available - currently 12.6.5 - via this link; Deploy apps in a business environment with iTunes but it requires you already have the .ipa files on your computer, or can pull them from the old device.

I have, on a couple of occasions, experienced bouts of chronic network timeouts, but they have \"cured themselves\" after a restart. Your problem sounds persistent, and my curiosity was piqued. So here's what I found: \nFrom OSX Daily is an approach that requires you delete a set of files in /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/. Apparently these are files the system generates, but it sounds like you'll need to re-enter the settings, and that could be an effort if you've made a lot of WiFi connections. The procedure is basically as follows: \n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off Wi-Fi in System Preferences or menu bar. \n\n*Remove aall Thunderbolt or USB devoces connected  \n\n*Create a backup folder & copy the files you will delete below into it\n\n\nHere's the list of files to be copied to a backup folder, and then deleted from: /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/: \n- com.apple.airport.preferences.plist  \n- com.apple.airport.preferences.plist-new   \n- com.apple.network.identification.plist   \n- NetworkInterfaces.plist  \n-  preferences.plist  \n\nThere is also this article from OSX Tips that, essentially, prescribes the same approach. It's recent vintage (March, 2019), and that could be taken as some sort of affirmation that it still works? \nSo, if you're in the mood to be a guinea pig, try this, and let us know if it worked! \n", "Q: How does one write Right-to-Left in Pages?

I've heard that battery improvements from iPhone 6 to iPhone 7 have been incremental. That jibes with battery technology progress in general (i.e. slow progress), and a quick search found this article that seems to back up the \"limited improvement\" opinion: \n\n\"... the battery capacity has changed little (iPhone 6 - 1810mAh, iPhone 7 - 1960mAh) and you’ll still struggle to get a full day out of it... \n\nThose figures are repeated in this article - a compilation of battery capacities for all iPhone models from 2007 to 2017.  One interesting thing to note from the table is that \"size matters\" - for batteries at least. Notice that the jumbo phablets have significantly more battery capacity, but that's down to the batteries being larger. And of course a phablet will demand more power than a 'normal' phone due to the larger display. \nFor all these reasons, I'd tend to discount the claim that battery life is \"inferior\" for the 6S. I'm not saying that there's no improvement; I'm saying that the improvements are \"evolutionary\" instead of \"revolutionary\". \"Inferior\" suggests poor quality and/or significant differences, and the data simply do not bear that out. I think Apple will do what they have to do to remain competitive; that includes battery technology. \n", "Q: Can't find recently edited numbers file nor the folder the file was in I have an iMac running High Sierra. I created a spreadsheet in Numbers a couple of months ago. I have been updating it a few times each week. Last edit was this month a couple of times. The Numbers file was stored in a folder named finance. When I tried to edit it yesterday, Saturday, I couldn't find the file nor the folder. I tried searching for the file and found a couple of files with the same name but they were older copies. I started the Numbers app and tried the \"open recent\" option in the file menu. I again found a couple of files with the correct name but they were the older files mentioned earlier.\nWhat could have happened to the file and folder? I suppose I may have accidently deleted them. Is there any way to tell? If I deleted them do I need a 3rd party app to try and recover them?\n\nA: A time machine backup is good for such cases. If you use time machine, open it while you have the location of the folder open in Finder and go back to when the folder was still there.\nIf you deleted it, there should be a copy in the trash. Look there, too.\nPeople sometimes accidentally move files or folders around or rename them. A terminal search for the file name can also find it in hidden and system directories, if your setup allows dragging things there.\nWithout a backup, I'm afraid it's very unlikely any tool can undelete it, as it has probably already been overwritten by what you did in the meantime. It usually only works when not doing much with the Mac and starting the undelete tool from another disk. However, you may try, especially if it's important.\nTry to avoid adding anything to the disk - files, apps, updates, even logs (which the computer does automatically when you use it), until you recovered the file.\nYou might also want to spend money on professional recovery services if the file is really important. Their chances are higher as they know which tools are best from frequent use. But I doubt they'll be successful.\nI suggest starting time machine from now on - it runs in the background and makes it possible to recover such files.\n\nA: It turns out I had acidently deleted the folder. I used StellarDataRecovery app to search my disk for deleted files. The free trial copy of the app recovered the files for me.  They were only 25-30 lines in each of the 2 files so they were pretty small.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2017 with 2 thunderbolt ports with triple monitor setup I currently have a macbook pro with 2 thunderbolt 3 ports and integrated graphic card and a belkin dock that I use for work, but can't get work done with just 1 monitor.\nI have a triple 1080p monitor setup at home that uses VGA and/or HDMI and was wondering if there is anyway I can use all 3 monitors with my laptop.

I also have a 2011 Macbook that I'm using now.  I also have a raspberry pi.\nThanks,\nRon\n\nA: From macOS help:\nIf you have two Mac computers with FireWire or Thunderbolt ports, you can connect them so that one of them appears as an external hard disk on the other. This is called target disk mode.\nConnect the two computers with a FireWire or Thunderbolt cable.\nOn the Mac you want to use as the disk in target disk mode, do one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the computer is off, start it up while holding down the T key.\n\n*If the computer is on, choose Apple menu  > System Preferences, click Startup Disk, then click Target Disk Mode.\nWhen the computer has started up, a disk icon appears on the desktop of the other computer.\nTransfer files by dragging them to and from the disk.\nEject the disk by dragging its icon to the Trash. While you drag, the Trash icon changes to an Eject icon.\nOn the Mac you used as a disk, push the power button to shut it down, then disconnect the cable.\nThe Apple Target Disk Mode support article is here.\n", "Q: Format Macbook 2, 1 running 10.4.1 I bought a MacBook 2, 1 at a market day and the user didn't wipe the computer.

I also tried the \nadvice from the following thread and it didnt seem to work either:\nClean wipe iMac running 10.4.11 OS X?\n\nA: In order to “wipe” the drive and reinstall, you need the original install disks.   The Early 2008 (White) MacBook did not support internet recovery at all.\nAlso, the highest supported OS is 10.7.5 (Lion) so if you intend to upgrade, keep this in mind.  These install DVDs are available on the secondary market (eBay).\n", "Q: Cannot reset password due to does not match any of last n passwords requirement I've recently added some rules using pwpolicy. When I restarted the mac, it asked to reset the password after I input the current password. But I can't satisfy the does not match any of last 3 passwords requirement.\nThe mac used to have no password policies, so I think it is probably failing because it has no history of old passwords. \nAnyone know of a solution for this?\n\nA: I contacted Apple Support. I was able to reset my password using macOS Utilities in Recovery Mode. \nBoot up holding command+R until the macOS Utilities screen comes up and go to Utilities > Terminal. Type in resetpassword and follow the prompts. I chose the second option, something like 'my password does not log me in' which lets you reset your password if you know the current one. It worked in that reset password function but not the one from the login screen.\n", "Q: How to chian two External Monitors with Macbook Air 2017 13\" About the Mac:\nMac OS Mojave\nVersion 10.14.4 (18E226) \nMacBook Air (13-inch, 2017)\n\nI wish to connect two external monitors with following specifications with my Apple device. \none pure HDMI \nother VGA (converted to HDMI using a VGA to HDMI Adapter)\n\nMy device has one mini-display port. I have bought a (not an apple product) 3-in-1 mini-display port to (DVI, HDMI, VGA) adapter.\nI have two options to connect.\n1. Connect pure HDMI, VGA based monitors into one 3-in-1 mini-display port adapter. (FAILS!)\n2. Connect the pure 3-in-1 Adapter to a splitter (another device that accepts one HDMI input and spilts into 4 HDMI outputs) using HDMI cable and then connect the two monitors using HDMI outputs. (WORKS!)\n\nThe second method is able to connect two monitors but my Apple device shows only one device connected in Display Settings and the two external monitors mirror each other but I want a chain display.\nAny help?\n\nA: The 2017 MacBook Air does not natively support dual external displays. When you connect a monitor through the mini-DisplayPort, you'll only get a single display. Even when using the splitter - you'll always get a single display mirrored across both monitors.\nThe 3-in-1 mini-DisplayPort adapter is meant for converting the DisplayPort signal to one of three other signals - but only one at a time!\nI would suggest using your existing adapter to connect the HDMI monitor to the MacBook Air using the mini-DisplayPort on the MacBook Air. Then buy a DisplayLink VGA adapter for connecting the VGA monitor to the MacBook Air's USB-port. Note that this display won't have the same performance as the built-in display and the HDMI monitor - so if you're using this for intense gaming applications, you'll probably want a different computer.\n", "Q: On Mac OS X 10.7, Java Control Panel crashes unexpectedly I'm wondering if this is a serious problem that I should be concerned about.\nI have the latest version of Java installed (currently Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_212-b10) via command java -version).\nI'm running Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.

But my problem was that many casks leave their installers in /usr/local/Caskroom, which is not considered part of the cache, and thus taking up a lot of space, while in fact the installer might not be needed after the installation.\n\nNow brew cask cleanup is merged with brew cleanup.\nHowever, I haven't found a way to purge my Caskroom folder using brew cleanup.\nThe man page says:\n   cleanup [options] [formula|cask]\n       Remove stale lock files and outdated downloads for formulae and casks, and remove old versions of installed formulae. If arguments are specified, only do\n       this for the specified formulae and casks.\n\n       --prune\n              Remove all cache files older than specified days.\n\n       -n, --dry-run\n              Show what would be removed, but do not actually remove anything.\n\n       -s     Scrub  the cache, including downloads for even the latest versions.

For example, the mactex installer takes up almost 4 GB of space.\nApparently, the command for non-cask installs is rm -rf $(brew --cache), but what is the equivalent for casks?\n\nA: As far as I can tell, it used to be possible to change HOMEBREW_CLEANUP_MAX_AGE_DAYS to, say, 0, and *.pkg and similar would be remove with cleanup -s.\nFor some reason, that was considered a bug in https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7320\nand changed in https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7400/files.\nI say \"for some reason\" because it's really mysterious to me, and various people have asked about it and never gotten an answer in the Github issues.\nAs per that story of the fence and it's removable, you might not want to do something the maintainers consider so unthinkable that they literally can't understand what's being asked.\nFor everyone else,\n ls -la /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/**.{dmg,pkg}\n\nfollowed by the same lime, only rm -rf instead of ls -la seems to work.\n", "Q: Keynote, hiding objects during printing My Keynote templates have a master slide that helps me lay out the pages. I add a number of lines, dotted and light, that help me when I lay out a complicated page. They are regular lines which I place and use visually as a guide..I would like to make it so that those don't print. Is there a way?\n\nA: Guides are the only non-printing elements in Keynote.\nYou can either use a duplicated set of masters (e.g. one master which includes your guide elements and one which doesn't). Then either manually switch masters before printing or delete the guide-elements master and replace with the non-guide-elements master.\nOr you can insert \"regular\" guides (drag out from the rulers) on your master slides, then enable \"View Master Guides\" (Keynote View menu > Guides > View Master Guides) to show the guides from the Master slides on the \"regular\" slides.\n", "Q: Open/Reopen dialog regarding Finder keeps popping up?

I've successfully been able to add the rest of my family to the home with the exception of one person.\nWith this person, I am able to send the invite in the usual way, and they receive it. However, the problem comes when they try to accept it; after clicking Accept, my device shows that they are now added to the home. The problem is, though, that this member of my family never gets past the accept stage - they cannot access the HomeKit setup like we can. Instead, they get stuck on this screen with the spinning wheel for a seemingly infinite amount of time:\n\nAfter trying the obvious things like removing them, re-inviting them and logging out/into their iCloud account, I became frustrated and did some googling. It seems that this is (or used to be) a common issue as you can see here. The strange thing is that all the instances I could find of this problem occurred mid-2018 when I understand there were problems with that version of iOS regarding HomeKit. As a result, I made sure to check that all of this family member's devices were on the most current version of iOS (12.2) - which they were, and thus I am now stuck and unaware what else to do.\nDoes anyone have any idea what is causing this issue and what can be done to resolve it?\n\nA: I recently had the same issue and was able to resolve it with the steps I described in this answer https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/371383/10494\n\nA: I have been having that problem for a while now, but I followed the first solution in this Reddit post and it worked.\nSummary:\n\n*\n\n*revoke all the invitations you were sending to that person\n\n*sign off iCloud on their phone\n\n*then sign in on that phone using your own iCloud account\n\n*whilst signed in as you, open Home app and see your accessories and scenario show up\n\n*when you sign out of your iCloud account and re-sign in as your family member's, they should be able to accept the invitation with no problem.\n\n", "Q: How can I lock files with specific passwords on mac, ideally through terminal? I want to lock my /etc/hosts file so that you need a password in order to write. I know you can encrypt files with Disk Utility, but in this case the file needs to be read by the computer and the path/extension cannot change. I don't just want to lock the contents, I want to lock this file very specifically.\nIf I run sudo vim /etc/hosts I need to type my login password but can then do whatever I want.\nI want a solution where if I run sudo vim /etc/hosts, I must type a customized/specific password to write to the file.\n\nA: The /etc/hosts needs to be readable by other program in order to fulfill its purpose. If you encrypt the file in any way, those other programs will not be able to read the file - and it will stop working.\nSo in short, you cannot do this (i.e. encryption) in a meaningful manner.\nHowever what you can do is ensure that others do not have passwords for administrative accounts on your Mac. If they do need more privileges for something, make it so that you assign access to that specific resource (for example via a sudo access limited to a specific program) - and ensure that you do not give out full administrative access.\nAn example of using sudo for giving access to edit a file is to use the \"sudoedit\" option in sudo. This allows you to give another person access to edit a file without letting their editor run as the privileged user (which is bound to let them \"escape\" and allow them to other things as the privileged user). It is achieved by copying the privileged file into a separate location, letting the user run their usual editor under their own user id to edit that file, and then copying its contents over the privileged file afterwards.\nIn sudoers you would specificy something like:\nusername  sudoedit /etc/hosts\n\nBy default this will allow \"username\" to edit that file, and requires him to enter his own login password before doing so.\nIf you want to the user to input a different password, that is not his login password, you have basically two ways of going about it.\nOne way is not to use \"sudoedit\": Instead create a custom program (can be a shell script) that simply inputs a string and checks that it matches the password you want, and then just mimics what sudoedit does. It can also be quite simple and just a \"cp\" command to copy over a specific path from the user's own home folder to /etc/hosts.\nThe alternative is to modify which passwords sudo will accept as valid. This is done by editing /etc/pam.d/sudo and uncommenting the standard lines beginning with \"auth\". Instead provide the authentication module and options you want to approve. \nIf you want to do something completely custom, you can compile your own PAM module that simply asks for a password and checks that it is a specific string. You can start with the source code for the default pam_opendirectory PAM module and simply rip out the OpenDirectory parts and replace it with a simple strcmp(). The source code for such a custom module is very few lines of code. \nYou can find the pam_opendirectory PAM module source code here:\nhttps://opensource.apple.com/source/pam_modules/pam_modules-76/pam_opendirectory/pam_opendirectory.c.auto.html\n\nA: Ok, so here's a completely fresh answer that's not a \"half-solution\".\nWhether this is what you actually are looking for, you can tell me.\nBut to reinforce the answers above:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change your default account to a non-administrator account.\n\n*Create a new administrator account, with a unique password; this account will only every be used to edit /etc/hosts.\n\n*Write a wrapper script/shell function to wrap/supersede sudo, also checking the arguments in $@ here to ensure /etc/hosts is the file in question.\n\n*read the password for the unique admin user into a shell variable.\n\n*Use the rest of the script to su to the admin user using that password, then then again to /usr/bin/sudo vi /etc/hosts.\n\n\nYou will then have a solution where when you \"run sudo vim /etc/hosts, [you] must type a customized/specific password to write to the file.\"\n\nA: Assuming your account is an administrator account, I think your best bet would be to Enable  the Root User (with its own password, and remove the admin group from the sudoers file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Directory Utility. There might be a way to do this from the Terminal, but open Directory  Utility.app you can get to it via\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Login Options > Network Account Server > Join...\n\n*open -a \"Directory Utility\"\n\n*etc... (it lives in /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications)\n\n\n*Click the lock, then under the Edit Menu, select \"Enable Root User\".  \n\n*Set a unique password.\n\n*Make sure this works. In your terminal, type su root, and enter your new root password. You should be able to edit your hosts file. \n\n*In your terminal (as default user), type sudo visudo, (enter your password).\n\n*Comment out the line:\n%admin     ALL = (ALL) ALL\nto \n## %admin      ALL = (ALL) ALL\n\n\n*Save the file.\n\n\nTry this again. You should now get an error to the effect of:\n\n\n*[User] is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.\n\nThis is not exactly file-specific, but it seems like what you were going for?\n(To restore, use su root, not a sudo-related function).\n", "Q: Does Touch ID work differently between Apple Pay and iPhone unlock? I'm only asking this out of curiosity. I've noticed that when I use my Touch ID to pay with iPhone, or to unlock an app, it's much quicker and it always works. However, while unlocking the iPhone, sometimes I need to put my thumb 2 or 3 times till  it unlocks. I noticed this happening with different iPhone models too.\nIs there any explanation for this? May I just be wrong?\n\nA: No. You may experience slower response times due to presence of moisture or dust on or under Touch ID sensor or finger/thumb respectively.\nCleaning/Drying the Touch ID sensor/finger usually resolves the lag issue.\niPhone 6s and later (excluding iPhone SE and all Touch ID equipped models of iPad) have a second generation Touch ID sensor which is much faster at recognizing finger/thumb geometry.\n", "Q: What's this little white circle on my Mac's screen? Can anyone help me identify this little circle on the screen of my Mac?\n\n\nA: The best way to catch the culprit is to quit running apps (both in Dock and Menu bar) one by one until the circle goes away.\nAs identified by OP by following the above mentioned approach, the circle is created by an app called MacID which along with along with it's companion iOS app Unlox lets one unlock their Mac using their iOS device.\n", "Q: Apple Airport Time Capsule with Airport express I've a apple airport express plugged and setup already and hooked onto it's WIFI.\nRecently I bought Apple Time Capsule that comes with the router.

Preposterously, this $100 software costs $50 to \"redownload\", so I need to be absolutely sure it will work on this computer before trying it out.\nI went to the App Store, checked \"Updates\", confirmed that macOS High Sierra was in the roster, and clicked the button to commence the update.  My computer shut down, I saw the expected loading bar, my computer restarted, everything looks fine.  \nI check \"About This Mac\" and it still says OS X Yosemite 10.10.5.  www.whatsmyos.com says I still have OS X 10.10.5. \nTyping \"sw_vers\" into the terminal prints out \"ProductVersion:  10.10.5\".\nI check the App Store, and under \"Updates Installed in the Last 30 Days\" there is a row that clearly reads \"macOS High Sierra\" and \"Installed May 6, 2019\".  The top of the page reads \"No Updates are Available\" so I can't attempt to update the OS again.\nWhat's going on here? \n\nA: \"What's going on here?,\" Indeed.\nI can't guess, it could be a damaged disk or disk structure, permissions issue, yadda yadda yadda...\nBut there are a few things you can try. Note these suggestions are going to be kind of generic due to the nature of the problem and because you didn't include your Mac model in the question. It would be best if you added that to your original question.\nBoot into Recovery Mode ⌘ CommandR when restarting your Mac. When you have a menu bar available start disk utility, select your drive and click on First Aid. If the drive shows clean when First Aid has completed you can quit and reboot normally. If it shows problems (fixed) then re-run First Aid until you get no errors. If it is unable to fix, add the error messages to your original question.\nNow, look in your Applications folder for an app called \"Install Mac OS High Sierra\" or something like that. Once you have verified you have the app I would use the freeware installer creator DiskMaker X a blank 8GB USB key and make a bootable High Sierra install key.\nOnce you have that, insert it in any USB port and reboot your Mac holding the ⌥ Option key. Select the installer USB key when the boot disk selector appears and let the Mac boot from that. It will take a little longer than usual.\nFollow the prompts to install High Sierra. Important to note you should NOT use Disk Utility to reformat/repartition your drive, just install right over top of what is already there. An upgrade install.\nReport back on those results.\nNote if that fails you may need to back up your Mac and use the installer to reformat the boot drive and then install High Sierra and restore from your backup.\n\nA: I went to the app store, found Mojave, and tried updating to that instead.  It worked!  Not sure why the Update Center was intent on only giving me High Sierra, or why that didn't work out so great.\n", "Q: Calling Screencapture of a Web Page in AppleScript As a newcomer to AppleScript, it is quite possible that I am missing something obvious, but I would appreciate feedback!

How is it\ndone outside iMessage?\n\n\nA: I know how it's done in a recent version of iMessage/Messages, but can't comment on other applications since there are many ways to do this.\nThe iMessage protocol allows an out-of-band \"last message ID\" to be tracked by Apple's servers for each conversation ID. This is separate from the end-to-end communication between parties. The \"...\" appears when the client application notices that the ID of the last message it has received is NOT the same as the conversation's last message ID according to Apple's servers.\nAPNS is not used for this unless it's a very recent development.\nIf, at some later point, the other party/parties stop preparing a new message, the ID held by Apple's servers will revert to the last message sent. Once the client app sees that the ID's match again, the \"...\" will disappear.\nAnother point: This will ONLY happen with \"blue bubbles\", since SMS does not provide a side channel for communication with the central authority (i.e. Apple's servers)\n", "Q: How to remove Adobe Creative Cloud icon from macOS menu bar?

I need to confirm this, but I don't think that your Adobe apps will be updated automatically. You will need to periodically launch the Creative Cloud app and check for updates manually.\n\n\nA: You can use Bartender.app to manage your menu bar items.

I'm at the initial stages of researching the development of my own call blocking mechanism for iOS. The goal is to develop a spam blocking app and infrastructure that delivers on some features that are sorely needed. The whole thing, from a development perspective is quite new to me.\nDoes anybody know how an app like RoboKiller works to route and block incoming calls? My observation is that the RoboKiller service forwards my calls to a managed service which then filters the calls and sends them back to my phone.\nI notice that the app adds itself to the \"Call Blocking and Identification\" extension in iOS. And, the app has the user dial out and turn on conditional call forwarding to what I presume is a RoboKiller phone number. By conditional call forwarding, I mean the app has me dial a phone number using *71,xxx-xxx-xxxx on Verizon service.\nIf it is only \"conditional\" forwarding, meaning the call has to go unanswered or the line has to be busy before it forwards, then how is the RoboKiller service forcing calls through their system before redirecting them back to me? Is the app able to block a call from any number using some feature in CallKit that I am overlooking?\nMy question is specific about how the call is getting routed through a 3rd party service for filtering and then sent back to me, especially when only \"conditional\" forwarding is used?\n\nA: RoboKiller uses a combination of carrier network (PSTN) and Voice over IP (VoIP) to deliver calls to your phone.  The technology and how calls are received on your phone are determined by the iOS version the device is running when RoboKiller is set up.  If you upgrade your iOS version, it is recommended that you disable/deprogram your phone, uninstall, and reinstall RoboKiller to ensure you have the best experience. You can find instructions on how to disable/deprogram RoboKiller in the Settings menu of the RoboKiller app.\n", "Q: Screwed up administrative name on sudo when trying to change usernames Disclaimer: I am NOT at all fluent in coding or its jargon, so bear with me.\nI recently downloaded a software and wanted to remove it.

So I tried to delete the partition and this is where problems began. \nDisk utility wont let me erase this partition, so I found this Youtube tutorial to erase this partition with terminal https://youtube.com/watch?v=3EXogZWQTyU&app=desktop.  I followed this tutorial and I typed in terminal the following commands:\nls mnt   \n\nmkdir mnt  \n\nsudo mount –t msdos /dev/disk0s1 mnt  \n\n*then I typed my password”  \n\nls mnt/  \n\nls mnt/EFI/  \n\n*Then it appeared APPLE and KALI which was the name of my linux partition*  \n\ncd mnt/EFI/  \n\nls  \n\nsudo rm  -rf KALI  \n\nsudo reboot  \n\nThis is where everything went wrong, my Mac rebooted and the missing folder icon appeared, I clicked on Internet recovery and found out in disk utility that my main mac partition was called disk0s2 it was not mounted and the partition type was FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFF. \nSo this is how I get to this forums and solutions, I followed Klanomath solution with terminal commands in this thread: OS volume shows as type 'FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF'.\n\n\n\n\nFirst I used this commands \ngpt -r show disk0  \n\ndd if=/dev/disk0s2 count=3 | vis –c  \n\nand I found out that I had an APFS partition,\n\nThen I continued with this tutorial and entered the following commands to unmount disk0, remove and re add second partition but with the proper size:\ndiskutil umountDisk disk0  \n\ngpt remove -i 2 disk0  \n\ngpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 431203056 -t 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC  disk0  \n\ndiskutil verifyDisk disk0\n\ndiskutil verifyVolume disk0s2  \n\nWhen I entered the last command to verify volume disk0s2 I would get an error telling me that it is in a wrong format and cannot be read.\nI did manage to change the partition type to 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC. But still it won’t mount the disk or boot.\n\nI thought maybe the problem was because I was following a guide with APFS format for High Sierra, so I founded this other thread for Mojave: https://superuser.com/questions/1368272/dual-boot-mac-linux-macbook-broken-after-creating-a-new-partition\nI followed this solution and again I unmounted disk0 and remove and read disk0s2 with the following commands,\ndiskutil umountDisk disk0  \n\ngpt remove -i 2 disk0  \n\ndiskutil umountDisk disk0  \n\ngpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 911218016 -t 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk0\n\nthis time I got an error that it said that I don’t have available space\ngpt add: disk0: error: no space available on device  \n\nthe tutorial said that if you had this problem, just type the following commands and so I did:\ngpt -r show /dev/disk0  \n\ndiskutil umountDisk disk0  \n\ngpt destroy disk0  \n\ngpt add -i 1 -b 40 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B disk0  \n\ngpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 911218016 -t 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk0  \n\ndiskutil umountDisk disk0  \n\ngpt add -i 4 -b 927225856 -s 7616512 -t 0657FD6D-A4AB-43C4-84E5-0933C84B4F4F disk0  \n\ndiskutil umountDisk disk0  \n\ngpt add -i 5 -b 934842368 -s 42262528 -t 0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4 disk0  \n\nafter the command “gpt destroy disk0” I started getting this error\ngpt add: disk0: error: no primary GPT header; run create or recover\nand both my disk0s2 and disk0s3 disappeared. \n\nI started to panic out and I finally did this last solution to fix this problem, I entered in terminal:\n\ngpr create –fp /dev/disk0  \n\ngpt recover /dev/disk0  \n\ngdisk /dev/disk0  \n\n\n\nAnd this last command it gave me an error telling me the command is unknown.\nSo this is where I stand now, im in internet recovery and disk utility just shows my ssd without my partitions disk0s2 and disk0s3.\nIf anyone can help me I would really appreciate it, and hopefully it will help someone else in the future.\n\nA: You put in your answer that you entered the command gpt -r show disk0, but the screen shots you posted do not reflect this. The funny thing is that the output from this command would have provided the information needed to fix your Mac. Unfortunately, entering this command now would be pointless, since you have destroyed the needed values when you incorrectly entered subsequent commands. Basically, you blindly entered the commands posted in the referenced questions/answers without modifying the integer parameters to match your configuration. However, there is good news. One of your images contains the string NXSB\\0\\^P\\0\\0LJI\\^C\\0\\0\\0\\0. From this string, I can determine the size of the disk0s2 partition is 441078368 sectors. The rest of the integers shown in the commands below are guesses based on my experience.\nTry:\ndiskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk0  \ngpt destroy /dev/disk0\ngpt create /dev/disk0\ngpt add -i 1 -b 40 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B /dev/disk0\ngpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 441078368 -t 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0\n\nIf this works, then consider yourself very lucky.\nIf you do boot back to macOS Mojave, then you can enter the command given below to reclaim the space formally occupied by Linux.\ndiskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0\n\nAppendix\nIf you are curious, the command below converts the string back to hexadecimal and printable ASCII character values.\n\nNote: It is important that the string be enclosed by single quotes ('). Do not use double quotes (\").\n\necho -n 'NXSB\\0\\^P\\0\\0LJI\\^C\\0\\0\\0\\0' | unvis | hexdump -Cv\n\nThe output is shown below.\n00000000  4e 58 53 42 00 10 00 00  4c 4a 49 03 00 00 00 00  |NXSB....LJI.....|\n00000010\n\nThese values can be interpreted the same way as shown in the accepted answer to the question Tried to fix filesystem type: FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF and probably made it worse.\n", "Q: Restore Spotlight Indexing I deleted existing Spotlight Indexing on my MacBook Pro running macOS Mojave by executing:\nsudo rm -rfv /.Spotlight-V100\nNow I don’t see anything - no apps, downloads, trash, nada. How do I undo this? I tried adding folders to Privacy tab in System Preferences > Spotlight, and then removing them, but it didn’t help.\n\n\nA: It looks like you disabled Spotlight indexing via Terminal commands, then tried to restore the default behaviour via graphical user tools (System Preferences).\nThat may fail as some guides for the Terminal are really 'thorough'.\nIn the screenshot above you have the commands:\nPrevent indexing:\nsudo touch /Volumes/YourVolumeHere/.metadata_never_index\n\nDisable indexing and searching:\nsudo mdutil -i off -d  /Volumes/YourVolumeHere/\n\nDelete existing index:\nsudo rm -rfv /.Spotlight-V100\n\n\nTo reverse these steps\nsudo rm -i /.metadata_never_index\nsudo mdutil -i on /Volumes/YourVolumeHere/\n\nTo remove the file that tells Spotlight to 'never index here' and turn on again the indexing and search on the drive.\nThe Spotlight folder should be recreated as needed. It may take a while and a reboot won't hurt.\n", "Q: Can't update apps from Apple Configurator 2 (apps are already up to date) I attach an iPhone running iOS 12.2 to a mac running macOS 10.14.4 (Mojave) with 33 apps pending updates (as seen from App Store in the update tab in the iPhone). I choose the device, then \"update\" in Apple Configurator 2 (v. 2.9). Then I get the message \"No updates are available. The installed iOS and apps are already up to date.\" and no apps get updated.\nIs there a way to make Apple Configurator 2 recognize the pending updates?\n\nA: I had this problem recently in macOS 10.15 (Catalina) with an iPhone 11 Pro Max.\nThe App Store app on the iPhone showed 19 updates available via a red badge on the app icon as well as inside of the app. Meanwhile, the Apple Configurator app on the Mac claimed no updates were available.\n\n\nRestarting the iPhone didn't change anything as far as I could tell.\nBut after restarting the Mac and launching Apple Configurator again, it now showed 34 updates available, which still doesn't match what is shown on the iPhone, but I guess it's better than zero!\n\nClicking the Update button in Configurator resulted in the apps being downloaded and updated. By the time the update process finished, 32 updates were downloaded, and I received an \"unknown error\" on the last two.\nApple Configurator's handling of app updates seems to be quite buggy.\n", "Q: iOS: How to change text size in app or otherwise read covered part? A certain app displays a number in a large font, and it happens that if the digits are too wide (eg. there are no narrow digits like \"1\" in the number, but only wide ones), the number is cut off at end and ellipsis are showed instead of the last two digits. So instead of displaying 02345678 it shows 023456….\nThe app support recommends to reduce the font size, but that does not help. I changed the size under Settings app → Display & Brightness → Text Size to all possible values, but it seems the app ignores that settings (I also rebooted in-between, as suggested by the support).\nIs there any other way to see the entire displayed number? Some kind of zoom? Hack? Anything?\nI am using an iPhone SE running iOS 12.2.\n\nA: \nIs there any other way to see the entire displayed number? Some kind of zoom? Hack? Anything?\n\nIf the text is selectable, you can try by long pressing to see if there's a view that reveals the entire number. Depending on the app implementation, you may also end up getting the Cut, Copy options using which you can copy the number, paste it elsewhere and read the value.\n \n\nIt's most likely a bug in the app which is preventing it from either honouring system wide dynamic font size or simply not handling the display correctly.\nYou should consider reporting it as a bug to the developer of the software, quoting your experience so far with the support team.\nPossibly the QA team has either skipped or not exhaustively tested it on a 4\" screen sized iPhone, as most current users generally use larger screen sized iPhones.\nIf it's feasible for you (i.e. if you have a spare iPhone handy), consider running (and logging in if required) the app on an iPhone with larger screen. You'll likely be able to read the value.\nIf you do not have a second iPhone, but happen to have an iPad, it could work too. You can run the app on any iPad in iPhone compatibility mode (simply install the app normally). iPhone compatibility mode runs the app on an iPad simulating 4.7\" iPhone screen size (iPhone 6/6s/7/8).\n", "Q: Change file creation date to modification date using terminal So I have a bunch of pictures that have incorrect creation dates but their real creation dates are the same as the current modification dates. Is it possible to correct this using some batch command in terminal? I've been messing around with the setFile + stat commands but it's not really working out since I'm terrible with terminal. Does anyone here now the correct way to do this?\nAlso is it possible to incorporate this into a find command? So that all pics with \"IMG\" in them get this treatment but no others?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: To use @user3439894's answer with find, use the -exec command {} + clause, and put the for loop into a sh script:\nfind some/path -iname \\*.img -exec sh -c 'for f in \"$@\"; do m=\"$(GetFileInfo -m \"$f\")\"; SetFile -m \"$m\" -d \"$m\" \"$f\"; done' sh {} +\n\nThe 2nd \"sh\" will become the $0 inside the spawned shell, and the .img filenames will be the positional parameters $1, $2, ...\n\nA: If you have both SetFile and GetFileInfo, you can set the creation date to that of the modified date on .IMG files by doing the following:\nIn Terminal, first change directory cd to the location of the target .IMG files.\ncd /path/to/target/files\n\nThen execute the following compound command:\nfor f in *.[iI][mM][gG]; do m=\"$(GetFileInfo -m \"$f\")\"; SetFile -m \"$m\" -d \"$m\" \"$f\"; done\n\n\nNote: It is always a good idea to first test on a small sample of the target files copied to another folder and check the results first, then proceed on the original files. One should also always have normal regular backups as well before proceeding, e.g using Time Machine or other backup software.\n\nIf you do not have GetFileInfo and want to use stat, then directly after do replace:\nm=\"$(GetFileInfo -m \"$f\")\";\n\nWith:\nm=\"$(stat -f'%Sm' -t \"%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S\" \"$f\")\";\n\nGiving you the full compound command:\nfor f in *.[iI][mM][gG]; do m=\"$(stat -f'%Sm' -t \"%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S\" \"$f\")\"; SetFile -m \"$m\" -d \"$m\" \"$f\"; done\n\nNote: This assumes you do have at least one .IMG file in the directory, otherwise it causes a non-fatal error, meaning nothing has changed:\nstat: *.[iI][mM][gG]: stat: No such file or directory\nERROR: invalid date/time\n\nTo use find, see glenn jackman's answer.\n", "Q: codesign still tries to access other keychains when adding --keychain parameter we have a automated codesigning setup on our CI/CD infrastructure which is using the codesing command to resign a iOS application with a certificate located in a specific keychain. The codesign script works in general but I detected an unexpected behavior. Even though I tell the codesign command with '--keychain' the keychain it should use, it still tries to access the keychains from the keychain search list. If I add all keychains to the searchlist it will lock the execution on a certain call because it tries to access a password protected keychain which is in the search list. If I remove all keychains from the search list (except the login and the system keychain), codesign won't find the proper signing identity even when pointing to the proper keychain with the --keychain argument. \nthe codesign command is called as follows:\ncodesign --sign <signidentity> ---keychain <path/to/my.keychain> --force\n\nThis one happens on macOS 10.14.4 and 10.13.6. I also tried different xcode versions like 9.2.1, 9.4.x and 10.1.\nI'm a little bit at the end of my ideas of how to solve this issue. It feels that the --keychain argument is bugged or doesn't do what I think it should do.\n\nA: We have the same problem. For now, we have to add the keychain we want to the search list as the only keychain. Then restore all keychains after codesign.\n", "Q: Method to switch between group of groups of Mission Control Spaces? I often find myself switching between multiple distinct tasks over the course of a day. For each of these distinct tasks, I have multiple Mission Control Spaces that I switch between. \nFor example, while I'm working on X, I might have an Excel window, then a PyCharm window, then a Finder window, then another Excel window. Then, when I'm working on Y, I might have an RStudio window, then a Chrome window, then a PyCharm window, then a Finder window. \nEach of these is open to a very particular thing, and the order helps me cognitively by letting me maintain a model of \"where things are physically\".\nMy best solution so far is just to have lots and lots of Spaces, with task X being Spaces 1-4, and task Y being Spaces 5-8. The problem is that looking at Mission Control can then be incredibly confusing - so many windows, such small thumbnails. It's even worse when there's multiple monitors.\nI would love to have a \"meta-spaces\" capability where I can switch between the Spaces for X and the Spaces for Y (and maybe also for Z, etc.). Ideally, this would be with a keyboard shortcut.\n\nA: As far as I understand, no such capability exist natively in macOS. Neither am I aware of any such general purpose, third-party tool which works on top of Mission Control.\nWhile the following solution doesn't completely fulfil all your requirements, it may help to a certain extent in achieving the desired.\nIn such a scenario, I'd separate groups of such task-focused Spaces (1 or more desktops) by a blank Space/Desktop as shown (by blank I mean a desktop with a blank image set as the background wallpaper):\n\nSince each desktop can be assigned a different wallpaper, you can create a custom wallpaper with largish text for the blank Desktop, indicating the group of Spaces with the custom task.\n\nThis could help you in quickly locating the desired ground after invoking Mission Control.\n", "Q: How to create an IPA file (non-payload folder method) I'm trying to create an iOS IPA file using Xcode.

This changed when I enable two-factor authentication on my Apple ID. (I cannot disable two-factor because I am registered with Apple Developers.)\nHow can I make autofill actually autofill my password like it used to, without asking for my password?\nPlease do not recommend TouchID as a workaround for this issue.\n\n\nA: I just ran into this problem as well, I found that it was only happening on my MacBook with the Touch ID fingerprint scanner.\nIf this is true for you as well then you can turn the password prompt off by going to System Preferences > Touch ID and unchecking the box next to Password Autofill.\n\nA: Well, you could wear an Apple Watch, but I'm guessing you won't like that answer. ;-)\nBTW, I've been seeing the same behavior and consider it strange, possibly a bug introduced in macOS 10.14.4\nSafari should only be asking for your password once, if you haven't used the autofill feature or authenticated against your Apple ID in 15 minutes.\nIf it's asking for your macOS login password, that's because your key chain has been locked. Try changing your login password then rebooting. Hopefully your keychain will remain unlocked after you log in again.\n", "Q: Is Internet Explorer 11 mode available in the new Microsoft Edge for Mac browser?

And while I've been able to make a lot of things work, I've had trouble with this one.\nThe really frustrating thing is, I can, technically, get it to work. I have made the script as follows:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal anchor \"output\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.sound\"\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\"\n    tell table 1 of scroll area 1 of tab group 1 of window 1\n        select (row 1 where value of text field 1 is \"Andrea Comm USB-SA Headset\")\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nquit application \"System Preferences\"\n\nI can run this, and it will change my sound output to my headset. The problem is that once that's done, I can't change it to anything else until I do it manually. I literally duplicated the script and replace the name of the headset with \"headphones\", but when I run it, it says it can't get tab one of group 1. I even made a completely identical copy, one that also switches the output to the headset, and had the same exact problem.\nBut, if I go and manually reset the output, I can run this same script to change to the headphones, and it will work. Then it's the other script that won't work until I've manually changed the output again.\nI've looked all over, and I cannot find a solution to this problem. No one else seems to have this issue, but I've had it across multiple scripts. And while I'm normally all about being my own special little snowflake, in this case it's not helping me any.\nAny help you can provide would be great. Thanks so much!\n\nA: While the other answer does in fact work for me on my system running macOS High Sierra nonetheless, I have to post a KISS principle answer.\nSimply add the following code to your existing code:\nrepeat until exists tab group 1 of window \"Sound\"\n    delay 0.1\nend repeat\n\nSo your code will now look like:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal anchor \"output\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.sound\"\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\"\n    repeat until exists tab group 1 of window \"Sound\"\n        delay 0.1\n    end repeat\n    tell table 1 of scroll area 1 of tab group 1 of window 1\n        select (row 1 where value of text field 1 is \"Andrea Comm USB-SA Headset\")\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nquit application \"System Preferences\"\n\nThere most definitely is a level of sophistication to the other answer; however, I'd imagine it may be a bit difficult to understand for those who are new to AppleScript and why a KISS principle answer is being provided.\n\nA: I tested your script on my systen (System info: AppleScript version: 2.7  System version: 10.13.6), and it worked perfectly.  My only thought is an echo of @tetsujin's suggestion about building in sufficient checks to ensure UI elements exists before trying to do things with them.\nIt could be that your system is taking longer to load the System Preferences window and its contents and therefore the script proceeds to execute the subsequent lines of code prematurely, thus resulting in a \"can't get tab group 1\" error.\nHowever, this doesn't satisfactorily explain why this happens on alternate runs of your script, which is very odd sounding.\nI redrafted your script and used my personal, standardised format that I use with all of these System Preference UI AppleScripts.  It has built in checks to prevent the script from proceeding unless the UI element in question is confirmed to exist (it gives up waiting after a short period, and terminates the script returning false, whereas any successful run of the script returns true).\nuse Prefs : application \"System Preferences\"\nuse sys : application \"System Events\"\n\nproperty pane : a reference to pane id \"com.apple.preference.sound\"\nproperty anchor : a reference to anchor \"output\" of my pane\n\nproperty process : a reference to application process \"System Preferences\"\nproperty window : a reference to window \"Sound\" of my process\nproperty tab group : a reference to tab group 1 of my window\nproperty scroll area : a reference to scroll area 1 of my tab group\nproperty table : a reference to table 1 of my scroll area\nproperty row : a reference to row 1 in my table\n\nproperty Headphones : a reference to (my row where the value of ¬\n    text field 1 = \"Headphones\")\nproperty Headset : a reference to (my row where the value of ¬\n    text field 1 contains \"Andrea Comm\")\n\non zzz(x, |ξ| as boolean)\n    local x, |ξ|\n\n    repeat 20 times -- 20 x 0.2s = 4s max. wait\n        if |ξ| = (x exists) then return true\n        delay 0.2\n    end repeat\n\n    false\nend zzz\n\non quit e as boolean\n    continue quit Prefs\n    return e\nend quit\n\n--① quit 1\n--② if zzz(my process, no) = false then return quit 0\n\nreveal my anchor\nif zzz(my row, yes) = false then return quit 0\n\nselect Headset --OR: Headphones\n--③ quit 1\n\nThere are three lines commented out, which I've numbered.  These can remain commented out during testing of the script, which will ensure the System Preferences window stays visible (once you've brought it into the foreground manually), so you can physically see whether the output device is being selected or not.  If the script appears to run properly, you can remove the comment marks and bring those three lines back into play, which will allow System Preferences to remain hidden, out-of-sight during a normal run of the script, quitting System Preferences at the end.\nThe penultimate line is the one where you will edit the name of the device to be selected—either Headphones or Headset (no quotation marks), both of which are declared as properties at the start of the script and already house the appropriate references to their respective device's UI element.\n\nA: You can change sound output device on macOS without GUI automation at all. Several projects on github make this available from the command line. This one is popular and installable via homebrew. But this one is my favorite:\nAfter installing 'audiodevice' on your shell you'd just run:\n$ audiodevice output \"Andrea Comm USB-SA Headset\"\n\nOr run audiodevice output list to show the available devices.\nYou can also call out to the shell from Applescript like this:\ndo shell script \"audiodevice output  \\\"Andrea Comm USB-SA Headset\\\"\"\n\n", "Q: Tons of mail windows opened because of no preferred outgoing server I don't use mail normally.

There are whole industries founded on the use of Intel Intrinsics for CPU parallelisation (with SIMD). For example, the community of Lattice QCD physicists depend on that for boost in the efficiency of lattice simulations.\nIntel-based macs can be and are routinely used by such professionals to do their job. However, there are rumours about Apple replacing Intel CPU with ARM cpus in future Macs. Will these professionals have to replace Macs with other Intel-based computers, or are there alternatives to Intel Intrinsics for C that are supported on ARM-based CPUs?\n\nA: The Apple M1 supports Neon SIMD instructions but not SVE. You can use sse2neon which clones the x86-64 SIMD intrinsics (MMX, SSE, AES) with their Neon counterparts.\nHere are some benchmarks using this simple program. The only change made to the C code to allow compilation on the M1 was this conditional:\n#ifdef __x86_64__\n #include <immintrin.h>\n#else   \n #include \"sse2neon.h\"\n#endif\n\nThis allows you to use the same intrinsics for both architectures. Intel provides a great guide for using the x86-64 intrinsics.\n\nA: Intel Intrinsics are really just a library that provides easier access to a number of Intel instructions sets - such as SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions), AVX, etc. - for C programmers. The goal is to be able to utilise these instruction sets for parallelisation, etc. without having to do low-level assembly programming by hand.\nThe ARM platform has similar instruction sets that serve many of the same purposes. For example NEON is the ARM alternative to SSE on Intel. NEON gives you SIMD instructions that you can leverage to increase parallelisation.\nAnd similar to the Intel Intrinsics, you have the ARM Compiler Intrinsics, that serves the same purpose. You can include \"arm_neon.h\" in your C program to be able to use NEON instructions with a C interface without having to resort to low-level assembly programming.\nIt is worth noting however, that the instructions available on Intel and ARM are not identical. So similar to \"ordinary programs\", you cannot use SIMD instructions for Intel on ARM (or vice versa) directly. In practice, software programmers often use software libraries with ready-made higher level operations that are able to take advantage of both Intel instructions as well as ARM instructions. A good example is the \"Simd\" image processing library (https://github.com/ermig1979/Simd) which offers high level operations that have seperate, optimized implementations for SSE, AVX, VMX, VSX and NEON (i.e. Intel, PowerPC and ARM).\nAs far as I can see, the growth in new parallisation features is very high on both Intel and ARM platforms - it is essential to providing next generation performance for some users. On newer ARM chips you have access to for example the SVE instruction set (Scalable Vector Extensions, which is essentially an even better SIMD instruction set for 64-bit ARM processors). There's no inherent advantage to either the Intel or ARM platforms in terms of providing new and enhanced SIMD instruction sets for programmers in the future.\nApple's own processors (in for example iPhones and iPads) have had the NEON instruction set for many years. The A5 CPUs and later also have the Advanced NEON set. The newer A11 CPUs have the SVE instructions, and the very latest A12 CPUs add SIMD support for complex numbers on top of that.\n", "Q: Quickest way to launch Wallet when phone is unlocked?

Press ⌘R when starting your Mac. \n\n*Open Terminal from the Utilities menu.\n\n*Run the following compound command adjusting Macintosh HD as necessary if you've modified the default name of the primary startup volume:\ncd \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Applications\"; ../usr/bin/unzip FaceTime.zip; reboot\n\n", "Q: Does switching the keyboard language (literally) works? I’ve used US format keyboard along all my life, a couple days ago I bought a Macbook Pro 13’ mid 2012 in in Mexico it was way more cheaper and with no issues at all with the computer, but I’m not used to that keyboard keys, I wanted to know if it’s possible to swap the keyboard language not just on software but in hardware as well.\n\nA: If you want to replace your existing hardware keyboard, you need to contact an Apple store or other service operation directly yourself and ask whether that is possible and what the cost would be.  Whether the right parts are available somewhere for a 7-year old machine is hard to know.\nAn easier solution would be to try using a \"skin\" over the existing keys or otherwise mark them to meet your needs. \n\nA: There are stickers to change the language. Here one example I could quickly find: https://keyshorts.com/products/us-english-bilingual-keyboard-sticker - the site also has stickers to completely change the whole keys.\nBe aware that you need to have the correct enter key.\n", "Q: Transfer time machine backups from unmountable HDD I am attempting to access time machine backups on an external hard drive that I have, and transfer them over to a new HDD. Both drives are 2TB. The drive with the time machine backups will not mount, but I can use Disk Drill to access the files on the HDD, thus I am trying to transfer the backups to the hard drive that will mount so I can restore to my latest backup.\nWhen I try and manually drag+drop the files from one drive to the other things take way too long - 4 days. At the end of the 4 days I hit an error that says the drive is full. I've read that this is due to expanding hard links in the time machine backups.\nI have also tried running disk utility and doing a restore from the one drive to the other, but of course this copied all the files and also made this new drive unmountable. So I have to reformat drive #2 and figure out an alternative method for copying over the files from the one drive to the other.\nAny ideas? I really need to get this machine back up and running.\n\nA: If disk drill won’t show you the directory structure, you’ll need to try a tool like Data Rescue it Disk Warrior so you can find the folder with one specific date to navigate and then restore those specific files. That would copy off at full speed. \n\n\n*\n\n*use the folder named Latest  unless you’re sure you want to go back to a specific point in time \n\n\nHowever, if the drive is failing hardware wise, no tool might be able to speed it up, so consider data rescue if you’re not sure it’s software corruption. \n", "Q: Can you change an iPhone startup screen background from white to black?

MacBook Air got a firmware password with keyboard shortcut Something I never saw happened to my MacBook Air 2014.  I was pressing some keys when it restarted itself to the Firmware password screen.  I never set up a firmware password and two minutes before I could start to start-up manager without problem.  Now it seems I'll have to get it to a repair center to have the password removed by Apple.\nCan a keyboard shortcut set up a firmware password by itself?\n\nA: What you are describing is not possible unless at some time in the past you, or someone else deliberately booted into Recovery mode, ran the Firmware Password Utility from the Utilities menu and then set a Firmware password. No key combination creates and sets the Firmware password automatically.\nHave you powered down the Mac by holding the power button until it shuts off?\nDo you now get the Firmware password on boot up?\nIs it possible you might have a friend or colleague with enough (evil) knowledge to boot your machine into Recovery mode and set the Firmware password as a prank or as deliberate sabotage? If this is genuinely your computer, (and I have no evidence that it is or isn't your computer from my side of the LCD screen,) this is another possible reason your Mac suddenly has a Firmware password set.\nNote: If you go to a repair center to have them remove the Firmware password, you may have to prove ownership of the MBA for them to unlock it.\n\nA: No, there is no keyboard combination that will enable a firmware password. Either you or someone else accidentally or intentionally enabled it.\nLucky for you, there might be a way to disable it, without bringing it to Apple. To do this you will have to be  booted into any partition/drive with macOS installed on it, and have SIP disabled (so if it isn't disabled already, you can't do this).\n\nEdit:\nI couldn't find all of the files needed for this easily, so I made a GitHub repo with instructions on how to recover the firmware password, and the files necessary to do so.\n", "Q: Why is the MS To-Do App adding things to my reminders, and how do I stop it?

If Safari quits, shouldn't the if statement prevent the script from even going to that line of the code? But that is where it throws the error.\nAny ideas? Thanks!\n--\nEdit: Found the solution here.\n\nA: The key was to put the problematic code inside a try block.

The symbols are not random but exactly what is supposed to happen when those keys are depressed.  Normally this would indicate a damaged keyboard, especially if you try another one and it works ok.\n\nA: This issue has happened to me a couple of times, and I found this question while googling, and the answer that worked for me was on the Mac forums.

I use Illustrator to create large, detailed pattern designs. The .AI file size of one of these designs typically exceeds 500MB. When I’m working on a large file like this, Illustrator performance is so slow, taking about 5 seconds for even the simplest operations, like zooming in and out. I’ve tried avoiding Overprint view, and switching to Outline view, and those help only a tiny bit.\nHere’s a screen recording showing how moving a group of objects takes about 10 seconds:\nhttps://youtu.be/lrAD9yBE1Pk\nThe file shown is an 800+ MB .AI file.\nEdited just to add stats on Illustrator according to Activity Monitor during the screen recording:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU 93.3%\n\n*Memory 4.43 GB\n\n*Disk 1.6 MB\n\n\nI’m wondering whether upgrading to the latest Macbook Pro will significantly speed up this process. Or if I just can’t expect to efficiently work on large files on a laptop, and should just switch to an iMac. Or if it’s just that Illustrator performance is really slow compared to Photoshop and InDesign, and it’s an Adobe issue, according to this:\nWhy is Illustrator throttled to 2% speed when it's in the background?\nMy current Macbook Pro specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Macbook Pro 15-inch 2017\n\n*3.1 GHz Intel Core i7\n\n*16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR memory\n\n*Radeon Pro 560 4096 MB memory\n\n*Intel HD Graphics 630 1536 MB memory\n\n*1TB SSD storage\n\n\nThe specs of the Macbook Pro I’m eyeing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Macbook Pro 15-inch (2018 or 2019?)\n\n*2.9GHz 6-core 8th-generation Intel Core i9 processor, Turbo Boost up to 4.8GHz\n\n*32 GB 2400MHz DDR4 memory\n\n*Radeon Pro Vega 20 with 4GB of HBM2 memory\n\n*1TB SSD storage\n\n\n(I’ve also thought about moving to other vector software which have been specifically designed for Mac OS, like Affinity Designer and Sketch, but they seem to be lacking some of the Illustrator features I rely on.)\n\nA: Judging from the stats you provide, it seems like it may be a CPU-related issue. Try to investigate this further to understand better if the issue is RAM or CPU related. \nTo determine CPU use, go to Activity Monitor and press cmd+2 to get the CPU usage graph. See if one CPU is peaking during these operations or if it is multiple CPUs. \nAccording to Geekbench, your MacBook Pro actually has pretty decent performance, however the newer model that you have in mind, would be 15% faster for single-core operations and 46% for multi-core operations, respectively. Moving to an iMac could offer a performance boost of up to 34% and more than 100% for multi-core, respectively.\nSince you are considering to move to a stationary iMac, you may also want to consider the Mac mini. It currently offers the most \"bang for the buck\" as it is cheaper than most iMacs. You can even save more money by installing additional RAM yourself (which requires some tinkering) and use external drives via USB-C.\nTo diagnose RAM usage, have a look at Memory Pressure, which is indicated at the bottom of the Activity Monitor app, when Memory is selected. If it is yellow or red, adding more RAM may actually help. \n\nIn addition to that you may want to have a look at Adobe's guidelines on Illustrator performance. Finally, there seems to be / have been (?) an issue with performance on your model and users reported that disabling the dictation feature in System Preferences > Keyboard > Dictation helped.\n", "Q: Internet speed getting slower over time on MBP Recently I've noticed that internet speeds on my MBP 2018 (Mojave 10.14.4) are decreasing with time. For example, after a day it will go from 100 MB to 60 MB and it will continue to decrease. The plot below shows download speeds sampled every 15 minutes over the course of ~3 days.\n\nA few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*This is not my ISP, since it works perfectly on other devices. \n\n*After restarting the computer, it goes back to the maximum speed and countdown starts again.\n\n*It is both for wi-fi and ethernet.\n\n*Logging out and back in doesn't fix the issue.\n\n*There is no software that runs in the background and utilizes that bandwidth.\n\n*Network diagnostics don't show anything.\n\n*Trying iperf between Mac and PC over Ethernet and WiFi, gives same low numbers as on Mac. Speedtest on PC is OK.\n\n*Running Speedtest from Parallels Ubuntu VM also yields low download speeds.\n\n*For Ethernet, I am using Belkin HD dock.\nWould appreciate any help or guidelines on how to debug this issue.\n\nA: As you've found, troubleshooting is a process of elimination and often requires patience. You've already done an excellent job of trying to get to the bottom of this, but there's a few things you haven't mentioned trying as part of your troubleshooting process.\n1. Bootup into Safe Mode\nI'd boot up into Safe Mode for a day. Not only can you test to see if the problem is replicated in Safe Mode, but the very act of booting into Safe Mode will run some checks, delete system cache files, verify your startup disk, and attempt to repair directory issues (if any are identified).\nFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. use your Mac for a day and see if your internet speeds drop over time)\n\n*Exit Safe Mode to restart your Mac\n\n*Test your Mac again to see if the behaviour has changed\n\n\nIf the Mac maintains speeds during Safe Mode, but not again afterwards, let me know.\n2. Reset your NVRAM\nIt may be worth resetting your NVRAM. For your model MBP you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP \n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again (i.e. wait until you've seen the Apple logo appear and disappear twice before letting go of the keys)\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your MBP reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nTest to see whether this has made any difference to your problem.\n3. Create a new user account\nIf 1 and 2 above do not resolve the issue, create a new user account. \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new user account\n\n*Reboot your Mac as normal\n\n*Log into the new account and use it for a day \n\n*Determine if there's been a gradual drop over time in your internet speed\n\n\nAfter doing the above, report back on what happens.\n\nA: In my case this was caused by the Juniper/Pulse Secure VPN client's kernel extension, which was active even when not connected to the VPN. Unloading the kernel extension restored speed without a reboot.\nShort term fix is to unload the extension, command copied from linked kb article:\nsudo kextunload /Library/Extensions/PulseSecureFirewall.kext\n\nLong term solution is to upgrade pulse secure client. I was experiencing this problem with pulse secure 9.0.3(1599). I upgraded to 9.0.3(1667) and the kext is no longer loaded by default. I can connect to the vpn without the kext loaded, and speed is no longer tailing off. Solved!\nWith pulsesecurefirewall.kext loaded:\n\nWithout pulsesecurefirewall.kext loaded:\n\nIf your VPN security policy requires \"Lock Down Mode\" or \"Traffic Enforcement\", you may need to downgrade instead of upgrade the client. \nFor future reference, you can view loaded non-apple kexts with:\nkextstat |grep -vi com.apple\n\nEdit: What is a kernel extension?\nA kernel extension is a program that runs within the macOS kernel. Running within the kernel can give performance improvements for certain applications, and also access to APIs that aren't available to normal (user space) programs. \nIn this case, the pulse client included a kernel extension which provides firewall functionality by inspecting packets as they pass through the kernel. The provided extension is buggy and performance drops over time (maybe it keeps a list of something, and as that list grows, the length of time taken to scan the list increases, so the time to process a packet increases, leading to a drop in throughput??)\nUnloading the kext removes the buggy code from the kernel, so that it doesn't affect performance.\n\nA: In case it helps anyone: I was running into a similar problem with a 2017 MacBook Pro but found a different solution... download speeds on other devices (iPhones, newer MBP) were steady around 500-750 Mbps down, but on my 2017 MBP the speeds would gradually slow down until they were anywhere from like 5-10 Mbps, sometimes even <1 Mbps, all tested using fast.com and Vodafone's speed testing service. After restarting either the router or the 2017 MBP, download speeds were back to normal on the 2017 MBP. However, the speed would gradually decrease again until it was (relatively) super slow.\nI put quite a bit of time into troubleshooting: tried looking in the \"Network\" tab of Activity Monitor to see if anything was hogging bandwidth, uninstalling VPNs, closing all applications one at a time, using a different browser, etc. Nothing seemed to work. Restarting the computer worked well but is time-consuming and pretty disruptive to workflow, so ultimately I decided to try restarting just the networking using the following terminal commands:\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 on\n\nFor me at least, this works to bring normal speeds back. It takes like 15-20 seconds total (opening terminal, copying/pasting the code, waiting for wifi to reconnect), and I know it's not technically fixing the problem... but it's better than nothing and most importantly won't waste any more time troubleshooting. Hope it can help someone else too.\n\nA: Similar to Hugh Saunders's answer, I was using VPN that worked differently which does not use kext extension.\nIn my case, I figured out the VPN was the cause because killing the VPN's background process restored the network speed.\nQuitting the VPN app did not stop the background root privilege process, so in order to shut it down completely I had to figure out its pid(process id) by ps -ef | grep (VPN Provider name) and then kill it by sudo kill -9 (pid).\nAfter that, my network speed from speedtest increased from 80Mbps to 330~400Mbps.\nSo I decided to uninstall that, and fortunately the provider had uninstall instruction that completely removed related files.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to open Terminal at the current folder location in Finder Say I am in a Finder window (eg: ~/Documents/code ) and I want to be able to  use a keyboard shortcut to open a terminal window with the prompt\nuser@computer: ~/Documents/code$\n\nMost of the questions are answered using mouse.\n\nA: In System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services under Files and Folders there is a New Terminal at Folder shortcut which you can assign a keyboard shortcut to; however, it only appears on the Finder > Services menu, or the right-click context menu, when a Folder is selected. So if you have a Finder window open but no additional folder selected, it is not available. This may be fine for one's particular usage, but if not, then here is an alternative.\nFor example, say you have a Finder window open to your Downloads folder, which is selected in the Sidebar, and you want to open a Terminal window there. Well the built in service isn't available because an individual Folder isn't selected and what's selected in the Sidebar doesn't count...\nOne way to open a Terminal window at the location of the current Finder window, using a keyboard shortcut, is to use AppleScript in an Automator Service (Quick Action in macOS Mojave), then assign it a keyboard shortcut in: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > ...\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an Automator Service adding a Run AppleScript action, then replace the default code with the example AppleScript code shown below.\n\n*Save the service as e.g. Open Terminal Here with the settings as shown in the image below. Then assign it a keyboard shortcut. It should show under the General section of the aforementioned path.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: After assigning it a keyboard shortcut, you may have to trigger the new service one time with the mouse from the Finder > Services menu for it to work subsequently using the assigned keyboard shortcut.\n\n*Additionally, the assigned keyboard shortcut cannot be one that is already in use by Finder. I wanted to use ^⌘T but it would not work, so I settled for: ^⌘\\ \n\n*Accessibility privileges for Automator may need to be granted for this service to work properly.\n\n\n\nExample AppleScript code:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    if exists Finder window 1 then\n        set currentFolder to target of Finder window 1 as alias\n    else\n        return\n    end if\nend tell\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    do script \"cd \" & quoted form of POSIX path of currentFolder & \"; clear\"\n    activate\nend tell\n\n\n\n\nAs an added bonus, you can also use the example AppleScript code saved as an AppleScript application in Script Editor and place it in the Toolbar of Finder, thus allowing one to click the icon to open a Terminal window at the current location when one wants versus using the keyboard short assigned to the Automator service. No third-party app required!\n\n\n*\n\n*In Script Editor, save the example AppleScript code as an AppleScript application, as e.g.: Open Terminal Here\n\n*In Finder, give it the same icon as Terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*From Finder, open the Get Info sheet for both the e.g.: Open Terminal Here app and Terminal, by selecting each and pressing: ⌘I\n\n*With both Get Info sheets showing, select the icon in the upper left corner of the one for Terminal and press: ⌘C\n\n*Now select the icon in the upper left corner of the one for e.g.: Open Terminal Here and press: ⌘V\n\n*Close the Get Info sheets.\n\n*Drag an drop, while holding the ⌘ key1, the app bundle for the e.g.: Open Terminal Here app onto the Toolbar in Finder.\n        1 Required in later versions of OS X/macOS.\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors.\n\nA: There is a 3rd party app named gotoshell available at the Macapp Store for free. This app enables you to put a small icon on your finder window tool bar. When you click the icon, a terminal or iterm2 window opens at the same directory as the finder window. The icon appears on all finder windows.

Is there a way to connect such a drive to my MacBook Pro so I can back up files using it from my laptop?  If not, is there a LTO tape solution that works with MacBooks?\n\nA: The only way that I know of connecting a MacBook (any modern laptop) to a fiber channel drive/drive subsystem is with a a device like the ATTO Thunderlink FC3162, however, they are prohibitively expensive.\nWhat might be a much cheaper and more effective alternative is to build another machine (a cheap PC will work well) and install a Fibre Channel HBA to connect to your LTO tape system.

Using Mojave on a Macbook while using Pages I found today the option \"import from iPhone\" which I used a picture I took with my iPhone to a Pages document in my Mac. I liked the photo and later I looked for it on my iPhone but could not find it. I googled a bit but found no information about this. Anybody knows where can I find these photos on my iPhone?\n\nA: The Joe Friday Answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*The picture was never recorded on your iPhone. That's the way the \"Import\" and Insert features work in Pages. \n\n*You can get your picture from the Pages document easily:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the document in the Preview app \n\n*control-click on the picture, then select Share, Add to Photos. From there, you can export if you wish. \n\n\n\nThe Long Answer:\nAs I understand your question: \n\n\n*\n\n*You imported a picture you took on your iPhone to your Mac. \n\n*You inserted that picture into a document you created on your Mac using the Pages app. \n\n\nYour question is ambiguous with respect to whether you \"imported\" the picture directly into the Pages app, or if you imported the picture from your phone to your Mac using some other (e.g. Photos) app. \nYou may ask, \"Why do I say your question is ambiguous?\" Part of the reason is your wording (though certainly this subject is arcane), but the main reason is that the Importfrom iPhone item in the Pages menu is only available when you have selected an image that already exists in your Pages document. If your insertion point (i-beam, whatever) is at a blank spot in the document, then the menu item is Insertfrom iPhone. At least, this is the behavior that I see - your experience may differ. And so, if one uses Pages only occasionally (as I do), one might wonder if you got this mixed up with the Import feature in Photos (which always uses the word Import. But in any case...\n\n\n*\n\n*If you \"Imported\" or \"Inserted\" directly from iPhone to the Pages document: The picture was never recorded on your iPhone. Sorry, but this is just the way the \"Import\" and Insert features work in Pages; apparently that's by design.  \n\n*If you imported from your iPhone to your Mac using the Photos app, then there is most certainly an option to delete from the iPhone, or to retain the image on your iPhone. If this is what you did, then you have selected the option to delete it after the import! And AFAIK, you don't get a \"do-over\" for that; the picture is no longer on your iPhone. \nAnd so, as to the location of your \"missing\" picture, it is in one of two places: \n\n\n*\n\n*If you imported the picture from your iPhone to your Mac using Photos, you can find it in your Photos app on your Mac, or in \"iCloud\" if you use that option. You can also export it from there if you like, again using the Photos app. \n\n*It exists only in your Pages document. Again, not a big Pages user, but I'd guess there is some way to save or export the picture from the document. If you can't locate a better method, a couple of fall-back approaches are: \n\n\n*\n\n*Do a screen capture of the photo in your Pages document (commandshift5). \n\n*Open the Pages document in the Preview app. From Preview, you can control-click on the picture, and then select Share, Add to Photos to add it back to the Photos app database - where you may have expected to find it in the first place!  :) \n\nA: When using \"Import from iPhone\" (same for \"Import from iPad\"), the captured photo is never saved on the iDevice nor is it saved somewhere on the Mac, say, in the Photos.app.It only exists in the document you captured into.\nTo get the image, select the image in Pages, go to the Image tab in the Format sidebar, then drag the image icon or image title above the Replace button and drop to the Finder Desktop.\nPlease be aware that this photo is not captured with the full resolution of the iDevice camera (apparently downscaled to 1920px for the longer dimension).\n\nA: When you click Import from iPhone it does not save the photo on your iPhone, only wherever you import it to on your Mac.\n", "Q: Does APFS reduce the needed free space on SSD's? I've seen recommendations for the minimum amount of free space one should have on an SSD that range from 20%—33%.  For instance, this answer (Can MacBook Pro get slower after SSD is almost full?) cites a 2012 Anandtech study (https://www.anandtech.com/show/6489/playing-with-op) that concluded:\n\"Whatever drive you end up buying, plan on using only about 75% of its capacity if you want a good balance between performance consistency and capacity.\" \nThe Anantech study was, however, pre-APFS.  I understand that APFS is optimized to work with SSDs, so my question is whether that optimization changes (reduces) the minimum free space needed to obtain, using Anandtech's words, \"a good balance between performance consistency and capacity.\" \nFurther, it's also possible that APFS's different design might mean that the minimum free space needed to obtain a \"good balance\" should be expressed in absolute, rather than relative (percentage) terms.\nI currently have a late-2014 MBP with a 1 TB 4-lane PCIe SSD, with 200 GB free out of 940 GB available on my main partition (I have a 2nd partition with 60 GB available).\nI understand APFS can reduce the total storage space needed to store a given set of files (see https://appleinsider.com/articles/17/06/08/inside-macos-1013-high-sierra-apfs-benefits-end-users-with-space-speed), but that's a different attribute from the one I'm asking about. Please also note that I know I can move little-used files to other disks (obviously), but that's not my question. I'm purely interested in learning if APFS affects the minimum free space needed for \"a good balance between performance consistency and capacity\" and, if so, why it does this.\n\nA: If we assume that the Anandtech study's conclusions are correct, then no, there's no change in the needed free space when using APFS instead of HFS+. You would need no more and no less free space.\nIt is important to note that the \"free space\" that Anandtech talks about is not the free space inside the file file system (i.e. part of the filesystem structure that is not currently used for storing user data), but rather free space outside the file system (i.e. part of the disk that has never been written to).\nAs both HFS+ and APFS support the TRIM command, the essential here happens outside the file system, and thus the change from HFS+ to APFS does not affect the result.\nHowever, you might still observe a performance difference when using APFS compared to HFS+. This is not caused by the free space issue itself, but rather that APFS and HFS+ simply have different performance characterics. Some things APFS does faster than HFS+, and vice versa.\n", "Q: How to create /etc/certificates/*.{cert,chain,concat,key}.pem files without reboot?

Can anyone explain Apple's recycling program to me, and how that plays out when ordering online? I am going to buy a new MacBook Pro and want to trade-in or recycle my old one.\nI have a Early 2015 MacBook Pro (Core i5). It got a swollen battery and a line of dead pixel on the display. It has gone through some rough times. I think it can't be traded in but can be recycled from Apple.\n\nA: Although related, Apple recycling program and Trade-in program are slightly different.\nApple recycling program primarily concerns with providing an avenue to recycle used hardware in an environmentally responsible way. It also gives Apple the opportunity to reuse certain components again.\nYou are generally not paid when you recycle old/used products. It's more about an ethically appropriate way to give away unusable hardware.\nApple trade-in program on the other hand lets you receive store-credit in eligible countries in exchange for a working hardware.\nAs you have a working Mac, you should go ahead with trade-in by visiting the trade-in homepage here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Trade In\nYou'll be presented with a questionnaire that lets Apple verity the eligibility for trade-in. You start by providing your Mac's serial number which will help Apple determine the system type and configuration.\n\n\n\n\nBased on your responses, Apple will either show you an estimate of the store credit that can be availed, or suggest you to recycle the device.\n\n\nYou can locate the Apple trade-in or recycling webpage for your specific country by visiting the Apple Recycling Programs homepage.\n\nA: The Apple Recycling Program is where you can turn in your electronic device and either:\n\n\n*\n\n*get a credit on your next purchase\n\n*an Apple gift card you can use any time\n\n*if not eligible for credit, they will recycle the components for free\n\n\nYou current order isn’t affected by the trade in credit.  The program varies by country so be certain to review the one specific to your location: \nhttps://www.apple.com/recycling/nationalservices/\n", "Q: Will Apple replace the battery on an iPhone 5s?

I'm trying to expand my HFS+ volume (selected in picture) to use adjacent space, but there is no option to do it in disk utility (!)\n\nI just resized my APFS partition in order to create the free space, so I know that this doesn't apply anymore:\n\nDisk Utility won't touch things once you have a BOOTCAMP partition.\n\nDisk utility in recovery mode as well as Gparted (Ubuntu 19.04) also seem unable to do it. What's going on?\n\nDetails\n\n*\n\n*Macbook Air 2012, i.e. no UEFI boot for Windows\n\n*Bootcamp partition, i.e. hybrid MBR, i.e. creating another partition is out of the question\n\n*MacOS 10.14.4\n\n\nA: If you successfully shrunk the APFS container partition to create free space, then macOS and Windows can not be used to add this free space to any other partition without destroying the contents of the other partition. Other solutions involve moving or copying other partitions.\nYou can only expand a partition downwards. You can not expand upwards. You shrunk the APFS container partition, therefore the free space resides directly below this partition. The only partition that can be expanded to claim this free space is the APFS partition itself.\nYou need to destroy the HFS+ partition and recreate it. First, you will need to backup any files you want to save. There is third party software which claims to be able move a HFS+ partition, but this usually take a long time to compete. Also, you should backup your important files before attempting. I should point out once you have made a backup, then could just destroy and recreate the HFS+ partition and avoid using third party software in any attempt to move the partition. \nJust so you know, I download as bootable iso for Gparted and created a flash drive with an APFS, free space and JHFS+ partitions. I was able to boot from the iso in VirtualBox and move the JHFS+ partition on the flash drive. So, yes there is free third party tools that can move a JHFS+ partition. However, after moving the partition, I used the command diskutil verifyvolume on the JHFS+ volume. The verify failed with the messages given below.\n$ diskutil verifyvolume disk1s3\nStarted file system verification on disk1s3 myhfs\nVerifying file system\nVolume was successfully unmounted\nPerforming fsck_hfs -fn -x /dev/rdisk1s3\nChecking Journaled HFS Plus volume\nChecking extents overflow file\nChecking catalog file\nChecking multi-linked files\nChecking catalog hierarchy\nChecking extended attributes file\nChecking volume bitmap\nChecking volume information\nVolume header needs minor repair\nThe volume myhfs was found corrupt and needs to be repaired\nFile system check exit code is 8\nRestoring the original state found as mounted\nError: -69845: File system verify or repair failed\nUnderlying error: 8: Exec format error\n\nI run diskutil repairvolume with the following results.\n$ diskutil repairvolume disk1s3\nStarted file system repair on disk1s3 myhfs\nRepairing file system\nVolume was successfully unmounted\nPerforming fsck_hfs -fy -x /dev/rdisk1s3\nChecking Journaled HFS Plus volume\nChecking extents overflow file\nChecking catalog file\nChecking multi-linked files\nChecking catalog hierarchy\nChecking extended attributes file\nChecking volume bitmap\nChecking volume information\nVolume header needs minor repair\nRepairing volume\nRechecking volume\nChecking Journaled HFS Plus volume\nChecking extents overflow file\nChecking catalog file\nChecking multi-linked files\nChecking catalog hierarchy\nChecking extended attributes file\nChecking volume bitmap\nChecking volume information\nThe volume myhfs was repaired successfully\nFile system check exit code is 0\nRestoring the original state found as mounted\nFinished file system repair on disk1s3 myhfs\n\nAfter the repair, I was able to resize the JHFS+ formatted partition to reclaim the free space immediately after the partition.\n\nNote: If your Mac is using hybrid partitioning, then you probably want to temporarily remove this hybrid partitioning before using third party tools such as Gparted. Once you have finished you could restore the hybrid partitioning. A good third party tool to enable and disable hybrid partitioning is gdisk.\n\n", "Q: iPhone having problems connecting to services I have an iPhone 7+ (NN4P2ZD/A) that has been having weird issues with connections which I’m attributing to DNS resolution problems. They only occur on home WiFi network and they only occur on this one device. \nOften trying to browse with Safari I get “cannot fine server” issues. Applications load some images but not others (assuming they have several servers for them so some resolve, some not). Discord, for example, can’t send photos but messages go through.\nIf I drop out of WiFi to 4G all works. If I start a VPN connection everything works. If I connect to another WiFi network somewhere everything works. And after that the cached information makes all work on home WiFi until it later on breaks again (assuming removed from cache). If I change DNS manually to something else than my router it sometimes helps a bit, but doesn’t entirely fix the problem. \nNote that this isn’t all addresses, and as I said, all other devices in the same network work. iPad 2, iPad Pro, laptops, Android devices, iPhone 5S... No issues. This device has had it always and with different iOS versions (currently on latest). There’s no clear connection between the addresses that won’t work, but Discord is one that often breaks. Twitter also often won’t load properly. \nSo far I haven’t tried to dump all network data to see what’s happening but I really can’t figure out what could be the issue. \n\nA: There might be some weird network configuration on your iPhone. Try forgetting your network and reconnecting.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Wi-Fi.\n\n*Tap the  next to your home WiFi settings.\n\n*Tap Forget This Network, then tap Forget to confirm.\n\n*Quit the  settings app from the app switcher, then reopen it to add your Wi-Fi network again.\n\n", "Q: What's the best way to update Homebrew when upgrading macOS? I'm just about to finally update my MacBook Pro to macOS Mojave, hoping that the issues have all been resolved. But when I got this new machine I changed from using MacPorts to using Homebrew.\nWhen I used MacPorts, I had a (semi-successful) recipe for handling an OS upgrade: save a list of the ports, remove the MacPorts installation, install the new OS, install the new developer tools, install MacPorts, and then slog through the saved port list and update (since inevitably the set of ports would have changed).\nWhat's the corresponding recipe for Homebrew? I have searched for \"brew update Mojave\" and found nothing.\n\nA: Homebrew manages all updating/upgrading by itself. Run brew update && brew upgrade every once in a while (and you can do it after upgrading macOS). brew update will update the list of available formulae, and brew upgrade will upgrade any outdated packages.\nIf you like, everything can be scripted as well:\n\n*\n\n*Run the macOS installer: startosinstall\n\n*Run all macOS updates for Xcode, etc..: softwareupdate -ai\n\n*Update homebrew itself and the package lists: brew update\n\n*Upgrade all software installed with homebrew: brew upgrade\n\n*Remove old versions of installed software: brew cleanup\nYou don't need to remove/uninstall anything before upgrading macOS. Just download the macOS installer from the App Store (or from System Preferences), and follow the instructions to install the new OS like normal.\n", "Q: Move file with specific extension from a directory hierarchy to a destination I have a directory hierarchy containing many images with .jpg file-extension, and there are multiple folders containing these images. There are many .json files as well in these folders.\nIs there a way to scan all these subfolders and move the .jpg files to a specific destination/folder?\n\nA: Create and open your destination folder.\nGo to the base directory you want to scan in Finder. In the search field, enter kind:jpg. Select JPEG image when it shows up.\nAfter it generates a list of all the JPEG images, you can select them all with Command-A and drag them to a folder. If you hold down ALT when you drop them on the folder, you'll get a copy instead of a move.\n\nA: If you are looking for a command-line solution, use the following:\nfind /source_root_directory_path -name '*.jpg' -exec mv {} /target_directory_path \\;\n\n\nA: In Terminal, the following bash compound command will move all found .jpg files in the \"/path/to/source\" directory to the \"/path/to/destination/\" directory, but will not overwrite existing files at the \"/path/to/destination/\" directory.\nfind \"/path/to/source\" -iname '*.jpg' -exec sh -c 'for f in \"$@\"; do mv -n \"$f\" \"/path/to/destination/\"; done' sh {} +\n\nAfter running the above bash compound command, run the following bash compound command to see what is left at the \"/path/to/source\"` directory.\nfind \"/path/to/source\" -iname '*.jpg'\n\n", "Q: How can I mount a thumbdrive to my iPhone?

Does anyone have any suggestions how to do this?\nI'll likely be able to mount it in a terminal GUI (NewTerm2 in this case) using fdisk and then mount, but if needed I can install other commands.\nLightning<-->USB (a)\n\nA: SanDisk already make the iXpand thumbdrive series from small to damned big, which have USB 2-3 and lightning connectors on them from the manufacturer.\nI use one routinely without issue. \n", "Q: Enabling password free software installation with parental controls on to block adult content I'm trying to have my son's computer setup so he can still install software with certain parental controls still active.\nIt seems there's no way to bypass the password window coming up when installing software, which is a pain.\n\nA: The password window shows up when an app needs administrator access to access certain files or folders not in the user's home directory.\nYou may be able to bypass this, depending on how the application is distributed.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the application is distributed by itself or in an archive(such as a .dmg or .zip) that just contains the app with no installer, you can drag-and-drop the application to the user's Applications folder(/Users/[your username]/Applications/) instead of the system Applications folder(/Applications/). If the user's Applications folder doesn't exist, you can create it yourself.\n\n*If the application is distributed as .pkg installer, it may provide the option for you during installation to \"Install for me only\" which will not require an administrator password.\n\n", "Q: Connecting iPhone to Windows 10 Computer for USB hotspot I have an iPhone 8+ with iOS 12.2 installed. I'm trying to connect it to a Windows 10 computer with a USB cable so I can access the Internet using the iPhone as a hotspot.\nI've had success with Android in the past, but I can't seem to get it with my iPhone.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: I suggest connecting to your iPhone hotspot over Wi-Fi. The USB connection works like a charm on Macs, but the interaction with non-Apple products can be flaky.\nThe support document from Apple explains this in detail, see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204023.\nKeep your iPhone displaying the Personal Hotspot page while you try to connect your Windows device over Wi-Fi.\nOnce you have that working, if you try USB again, be sure you have iTunes running and that you click \"Trust\" when prompted by your phone and your PC regarding the connection.\nNormally there's no performance advantage from using USB vs. Wi-Fi.\nAlso, be sure your plan allows you to use your phone as a Hot Spot. I have friends with T-Mobile and AT&T plans for whom this silently fails unless they pay an extra $30/month to their wireless provider.\n", "Q: Retrieve folder's name for Automator's shell script action For the sake of concatenating video files, I've assembled bits of code found online into a ffmpeg bash script on Automator.

The other option it offers is it to install macOS High Sierra, which, as I said fails for me. So I am not interested in these options).\n\nA: If you already have the Install macOS High Sierra.app application bundle, then the easiest way to install macOS is to create a macOS USB Installer and boot the Mac with it and install from there.  Have a look at: How to create a bootable installer for macOS\nThe startosinstall command that is within the e.g. Install macOS High Sierra.app application bundle is what you need to use:\n$ /path/to/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/startosinstall --usage\nUsage: startosinstall\n\nArguments\n--applicationpath, a path to copy of the OS installer application to start the install with.\n--license, prints the user license agreement only.\n--agreetolicense, agree to license the license you printed with --license.\n--rebootdelay, how long to delay the reboot at the end of preparing.

I'd like to share passwords between macOS and iOS. I've enabled iCloud keychain, moved all relevant passwords in Keychain App to iCloud but for some reason they don't appear in my iPhone. I check my passwords and there's nothing there. How can I debug this?\n\nA: Only passwords stored via Safari are synced between devices. Passwords manually added to Keychain App are not sent to iOS.\n\nA: Keychain must be turned on in both iOS and macOS. While data is moved back-and-forth through iCloud, data is not accessible from iCloud and need not (and should not) be moved manually from a computer or device into the user's iCloud storage. You can see Apple's directions for iOS here, and for macOS here. A good long-form discussion of Keychain synching is here. Apple's iOS page notes that Keychain synching is not available in all countries.\nBriefly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on Keychain synching on your iPhone in Settings > iCloud > Keychain. The Keychain slider must be \"On.\" (This is iOS 12.2; your iOS may vary.)\n\n*Turn on Keychain synching on your Mac in System Preferences > iCloud > Keychain.

In my workspace I have these frequently used folders that I keep in my dock, but I find it annoying that I have to right click and click \"open\" every time i want to open them.

When you open a DMG, nothing happens–it's like opening a folder (effectively, there are some differences but none that affect the answer to this question).\nTypically, you're asked to drag the application to the Applications folder. This is exactly as it appears–the file you're dragging (the application) is being copied to the Applications folder.\nSometimes, you're asked to open an installer. The specifics of how the installer works varies based on how the developer wrote it. The DMG portion of the process doesn't really effect that.\nThe standard is a PKG file, which opens the standard installer program.

One or more of those had that person cheek-to-cheek with another person in my album (let's call them Joe and Jane). I was horrified -- since I have thousands of photos of both Joe and Jane -- to find that as soon as I approved that ill-fated photo, the facial recognition system decided the two people were the same person and merged their entire set of photos.\nI tried deleting both Joe and Jane on macOS 10.14.4 and recreating them by manually tagging them in photos where they were by themselves and not together, but no matter what I do, as soon as photoanalysisd kicks into gear when Photos is closed, it merges the two people back together into one entry. I can manually label photos with Joe's name and I'll still come back to find them relabeled as \"Jane.\" I can select all of Joe's photos in Jane's people entry, right click the photos and click \"Jane is not in this photo,\" have Jane's album only contain photos of Jane and within minutes those very same photos will again be labeled as Jane (not just other photos, the ones I've manually corrected Photos on!).\nI'm guessing Photos' machine learning database is corrupted, but I'm not really sure how to completely delete data on Joe and Jane (beyond what I did in deleting their entries by selecting all the photos in them and using the \"Name is not in this photo\" option), but somehow I need to convince Photos to either start from scratch or believe me when I tell it that it is wrong on its labels so it doesn't keep overriding me. \n\nA: Talking to Apple Support, they said the only thing they could come up with was to delete my Faces database. That hurts -- it involved deleting 116 people covering 170,000 photos. All of my devices are still \"processing\" after several days, but I've been adding many faces back in the time being. \nOne helpful comment from Apple Support was to make sure to ignore the automatically generated circles around faces if they covered multiple faces and simply to draw new circles (on Photos for macOS) that only cover the face in question. Previously, if it drew an automatic circle, I would label that with whichever person was most prominent and draw a manual circle for the secondary person in the circle. (This isn't as helpful on iOS where it lacks those circles and the ability to add manual faces.)\n", "Q: Installing Windows on MBP 2015 (Mojave) Using Boot Camp, Error: Not enough space! I have a MacBook Pro 2015 with macOS Mojave.\nI've downloaded Windows 10 x64 October (and April) Update ISO and I tried to install both of them using Boot Camp Assistant.  \nI have a 500GB disk with 300GB free space. So I set the size of Windows partition to 150GB.  \nThere are no tasks step in the boot camp in this version of macOS. And Boot camp says \"Please remove any external storage device attached to this system before continuing.\".\nThe problem is that after these steps it show's an error with this message:  \nThe Windows support software could not be saved to the selected drive.\nAn error occurred while saving the Windows support software.\n\nOr:\nThere is not enough space available on the disk.\n\nI tried so many solutions that I found in forums but I couldn't install Windows yet!\nThank you for your help! :)\n\nA: This question has been asked before here a Ask Different. One possible answer is the disk (drive) where the software is being saved is actually too small. On your model Mac, the Boot Camp Assistant creates a temporary ExFAT formatted partition where both the Windows 10 ISO files are copied and the downloaded Windows support software files are saved. The Windows ISO file can vary in size. The determining factors is the version, edition and language. Also, the size of the Windows support software depends on the model/year of the Mac. Evidently, certain combinations of size factors can lead to space errors. So, while most users probably are not having problems using the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows, there are a few with space issues.\nOlder Macs use a FAT32 formatted flash drive to install Windows. Certain Windows 10 ISO files contain files which to larger to be stored on FAT32 formatted flash drives. When this occurs, the Boot Camp Assistant will produce a space related error message.\nUsers also have reported that Time Machine has limited the space available to install Windows. See the question Bootcamp: The startup disk does not have enough space to be partitioned. \nFinally, users have reported cases where they are able to use either the Disk Utility application or the diskutil command to shrink the macOS partition by the desired size and create space for Windows to be installed, but can not get the Boot Camp Assistant to do the same. For example see: Mojave bootcamp assistant limits partition size.\nIf you are having space problems, then you should first make sure you have installed the latest version of macOS that is compatible your Mac. This includes installing all available applicable updates. If you are still having space problems, then consider using the following steps to install Windows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Windows support software. In this case, you are prompted where to store the files to be downloaded.\n\n*Use the Disk Utility application or the diskutil command to create space for Windows.\n\n*ExFat format and 16 GB or larger flash drive and copy the files from the Windows ISO and Windows support software download.\n\n*Boot from the flash drive and install Windows.

This encrypted file contained all \"auto-fill\" form values in Safari. I don't know if this file still exists on current version, but during some analysis of an old mac of mine, I found this encrypted file and wanted to dig into it.\nThis file seems to be encrypted with a key contained in the user's login.keychain. I have the key (256 bits long) but I was not able to find the correct way to decrypt data.\nAccording to this answer https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/198290/332020 the file is encrypted with AES-128 bits. But none of my implementation did work (AES-128 with first 128 bits as salt, 128 after as key, ECB, CBC, ...). Since Mac OS 10.7 was released in 2011, I also tried 3DES, without luck also.\nDoes someone know more about the encryption process?\n\nA: So... After hours research, I finally found the encryption process.\nThe password contained in the keychain is NOT the encryption key!\nThe password has to be derived to obtain the key. The process is as follow: PBKDF2_SHA1(password: passwordFromKeychain, salt: someSalt, iterations: 1000, outputLen: 128)\nThen the cipher can be easily decrypted. It is simply AES-CBC-128 with PKCS5Padding and no IV (or IV = [0, ...])\nThe output will be a binary PLIST which can be read by any program having such capability. Thus, you can know if the decryption process is successful by verifying the first 6 byte are equals to: \"bplist\".\nI wrote a code (JAVA) to do the decryption: https://github.com/Flo354/SafariFormValuesDecryptor\n", "Q: Change Safari microphone input device to be blackhole or soundflower I want to change Safari input device from built-in microphone to Blackhole 2ch.\nI tried to do this by choosing Blackhole as the Input device system-wide in System Preferences.\nThe input device is working, in every other app I can use it as the input device and hear that it records properly, in System Preferences the volume monitor flickers correctly.\nHowever, Safari always just records silence.

For example, in Audacity you can select other than the one set for the OS.\nHowever, I am not aware of a built-in preference in Safari that lets one choose a sound input device.

I had duet display installed on both HS and Win10, and I installed Parallels Desktop 14 on the MacOS side and had it run the bootcamp partition instead of installing a new instance of win10. I think duet display caused some problems because the MacOS version was trying to mirror with the ipad at the same as the Win10 duet display running duet display (that was dumb, I know. it was a careless accident). It crashed/stalled and I couldn't shut down or suspend win10 in Parallels. I ended up force quitting Parallels using activity monitor. Now I can't boot into windows by holding option on bootup. However, I do have the Paragon NTFS for Mac that allows me to view NTFS partitions and all my data is on there and now backed up. I'd rather not have to reinstall everything if all it takes is fiddling with the EFI partition. Any ideas?\n\nA: OK, since I can read the bootcamp partition, I guess I'll just back it up and reinstall Windows.

The pre-installed sftp binary on macOS sucks. When I use my ubuntu machine, sftp has glorious things like a history and tab completion. I've looked around, and cannot tell a clear cut path to upgrading the binary. Has anyone done this? How?\n\nA: Install homebrew a macOS package manager.  https://brew.sh/\nHomeBrew is most often mentioned these days. sftp appears to be one of the programs you can download. \nother package managers are:\nMacPort -- BSD licenses\nFink -- GNU General Public License\nI'd figure out what sftp client Ubuntu uses and look around for the macOS version. \n\nA: tl;dr: openssh homebrew package\n\nRight now, if you which sftp, you'll see /usr/bin/sftp, which is Apple's crippled version of the program. You can install the latest vanilla OpenSSH (includes ssh, sftp, scp, ssh-agent, etc) to solve the problem.\nAssuming you have Homebrew installed:\nbrew install openssh\nNow it's installed. However, if you run which sftp, you might still see the old /usr/bin/sftp and not the Homebrew one installed at /usr/local/bin/sftp. We don't want to overwrite Apple's files (generally not a good idea) so we'll just set the Homebrew binaries as a higher priority in your terminal.\nAdjust your PATH in your .zshrc:\nexport PATH=$(brew --prefix)/bin:$PATH\nOpen a new terminal and you'll probably see which sftp return /usr/local/bin/sftp.

The machine booted fine, but once it was running I was unable to open the hard drive in Finder, which was likely related to TechTools Pro claiming there was an issue with the volume structure. Attempting to open it would freeze the machine. I didn't hear any disk activity, and let it sitting for at least an hour just to see if it would follow through, no results.\nI kinda got ahead of myself and disassembled the machine to continue with my project, and now have the intact hard drive separated. Is there any way I can connect this to a modern computer, and if so, would I even be able to recover files? I can't find anything but the startup sound after a bit of digging around online, and I'd love to have the original files anyway for authenticity's sake.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: From what I can tell the drive from an iMac G3 is an IDE type. HDDs running Mac OS System 8.6 ought to be running on the HFS+ disk format.\nIf you get a USB HDD enclosure with internal IDE connectors you should be able to plug the drive into it, connect the enclosure to a modern Mac and see the disk contents.\nIf you don't have access to a modern Macintosh you should be able to read HFS+ formatted drives under windows with the software hfsexplorer.\n\nA: If your G3 has a Firewire port you can connect that directly to a more modern Mac (FW400->800 or FW400->400) and run dd in Terminal to make a full 1:1 disk image of the drive's contents. Boot into Target Disk Mode on the G3 when doing this (Boot and hold down T).\nAlternatively, I believe Finder can natively view the contents of the disk. Then you can just click and drag your stuff out.\nIf the drive is already completely taken out, you can toss it onto an IDE to USB adapter and plug that in. It would function the same way any external storage device would.\n", "Q: Is there a way to move window off top edge of display?

I’m afraid if I push eject I’ll delete the program and lose my work. \nWhy do the newly-installed programs appear there? \n\nA: When you download an application, it often comes inside a \"Disk image\" (a .dmg file). This is a virtual volume, which appears just like other disks on your Desktop, once you've launched it.\nYou have to copy the application from there into your /Applications folder. (Disk images often contain an alias to your Applications folder, so you can easily drop the app onto the folder.\nOr, if the image contains an installer app or package, you have to run the installer app.\nOnce you have done this, you can eject the disk image and trash the .dmg file. If you haven't copied the app or installed it, then you need to make sure this is done first.\n\nA: Just to further clarify, understand what is happening conceptually when you download and install a program in modern day macOS:\n\n*\n\n*In the \"old days\", you would buy a program from a physical store which would consist of a box containing a DVD, CD, or floppy disk/diskette (in order from newest to oldest).  We call these memory devices \"physical storage media\".\n\n*The storage media contained the \"installation files\" which were essentially a copy of the application, and scripts to copy the application files to your internal hard drive, and make any configuration changes as necessary.  We'd specifically call these physical media containing the installation files, \"[an] install disk[s]\".\n\n*You would then physically insert the external, physical storage media - the install disk - into the computer.\n\n*You would then \"install the application\" from the install disk to your internal hard drive.\n\n*You would then, usually, eject the install disk, as, with the application now installed directly to your faster internal hard drive, you no longer had use for it.*\n\nNowadays, we are emulating several of those steps virtually:\n\n*\n\n*Instead of buying a physical box containing a physical install disk from a physical store, you're downloading a virtual disk from a \"virtual\" \"store\" (the Internet).\n\n*On macOS, these virtual disks usually have the extension *.dmg.*  \"Inside\" of the *.dmg file, similar to how a *.zip file can contain several other files, are all of the application files and installation scripts (if necessary), just like the physical install disks of old.\n\n*When you double-click a downloaded *.dmg file, macOS automatically recognizes it (you can read more about \"file associations\") as a virtual disk and automatically \"mounts\" it as an \"external\" drive.  This is the same process that occurs when you insert a CD/DVD (if you still have a CD/DVD drive), or when connect an external USB drive (USB thumb drive, USB card reader, USB hard drive, etc.).  The only difference here is that it is happening \"virtually\".  You aren't actually inserting anything physically into the computer, but the computer is going through the same motions with the *.dmg - the virtual disk - as if you were.  That's why when you double-click the downloaded *.dmg file, it appears in your Finder window sidebar with a little eject icon option, just like any other physical external drive you might connect.  Even though the *.dmg file is already on your internal hard drive, macOS treats the mounted *.dmg file as if it were a separate disk/drive.\n\n*From here, the rest of the process is the same: your virtual disk is mounted, just as if you inserted a physical install disk.  Now you have to install the application to your internal disk drive.  On macOS, this is usually as simple as copying the application to your root /Applications folder.  Some applications, though, have an install program (or install script) that do this for you automatically, and potentially handle some more advanced configuration.\n\n*Once the program is installed from the virtual disk, you can then \"eject\" (\"unmount\") the disk, just as you would eject a physical install disk in the old days.  The downloaded *.dmg file will still exist in your /Downloads folder, it's just no longer \"unzipped\" and \"mounted\".  Once your application is installed, you no longer need the *.dmg file either, except for archival purposes, or if you someday need to reinstall that same program (and same version of that program) again in the future.  But, except for very rare circumstances involving paid or hard-to-find software, in this Internet era, you can almost always just downloaded the *.dmg again (or the latest version of the program).\n\n* In the \"old days\" of limited and expensive internal storage, it was sometimes necessary to keep the original, physical, external application media in the computer to run the application or game or video.  \"Installation\" would only involve copying the core application files to the hard drive, but larger application resources would still be read from the external media.  This was done because, while external media is/was much slower, it was better than the alternative of using up all of the precious and expensive internal storage.  Nowadays, internal storage is so cheap and plentiful, that you almost never see this done anymore, although it is still somewhat common for video game consoles (which are just specialized, branded computers).  Also, then, and now, some applications and games can be run without installation, directly from external media.  We call these \"portable\" or \"standalone\" applications or versions of applications.  Many handheld, cartridge-based video game systems still work like this.  These exceptions are all tangential to the idea of understanding how most modern-day macOS applications are installed, but it might be useful to know that there are almost always exceptions to everything.\n* There are other common virtual disk extensions and formats.  *.dmg is the most common and standard Mac format.  *.iso is probably more common, but is generally seen more in Windows or Linux.  *.udf is rarer these days, and other specialized formats like *.vmdk are beyond the scope of this answer.\n", "Q: Auto Typer onto Unfocused Application How do I execute commands such as typing out text, onto an unfocused application in the background?\nFor example, I want to have it type out text in a messaging application while I'm on my browser.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    activate\n    delay 4\n    repeat y times\n        keystroke x\n        delay z\n        keystroke return\n\n    end repeat\n\nThis is a section of the code I'm using, with x, y and z being message typed, times repeated and delay in between respectively. It works well when the window I want it to type in is in front, but how would I change it to allow me to designate the typing to a certain application?\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\nA: System Events can only send a keystroke to the front most application or its window.\nHowever, if you want to send a text message to a Buddy using Messages, while it's in the background, the following example AppleScript code works for me:\nset targetBuddy to \"+nnnnnnnnnnn\"\nset textMessage to \"Hello World!\"\n\ntell application \"Messages\"\n    set targetService to id of 1st service whose service type = iMessage\n    set theBuddy to buddy targetBuddy of service id targetService\n    send textMessage to theBuddy\nend tell\n\n\nThe \"+nnnnnnnnnnn\" in set targetBuddy to represents the Buddy's phone number. Also, as coded, Messages is already opened and in the background. Otherwise additional code is required.\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide.

I want to disable Two-factor authentication for my Apple ID.\nWhen I log in to Apple ID website, and click edit, it lists Two-factor authentication as On, but does not allow me to turn it off.\nHow can I disable it?\n\nA: Two-factor authentication can be turned off up to two weeks after enabling it. If it has remained enabled for over this period of time, you are locked into using it (for your account's safety, as per Apple.)\nIt is a useful feature which adds an extra layer of security for your account.

Certain features in the latest versions of iOS and macOS require this extra level of security, which is designed to protect your information. If you recently updated your account, you can unenroll for two weeks. Just open your enrollment confirmation email and click the link to return to your previous security settings.

I want to hide app icon from the Dock that are running but doesn't have an active window. I googled it, but the answers I found were all app specific.\nI am looking for a generalized solution.\n\nA: In general, majority of macOS apps are programmed to display it's icon in the Dock when it's running (exceptions are apps which display an icon only in the Menu bar when running).\nIf an app icon is not added permanently to the Dock, it's icon remains visible as long as it's running. The icon is removed from the Dock upon quitting the app by selecting App Name → Quit App Name from the app menu, or by invoking the keyboard shortcut Command + Q with the app in focus.\nSo, the only way to remove an app icon from the Dock is by quitting it.\nSome apps are programmed to automatically quit when it's last visible window is closed either by clicking on the close button\n\nat the top right, or when the close window keyboard shortcut Command + W is invoked.\nThus, it's up to the developer of the app to choose which of the two behavior to implement, and can not be changed by user.\n", "Q: Could not log in; restarted MacBook Air; icons exchanged position; Got a login warning at my iPhone I took my MacBook Air offline and put it to sleep.

The alert on your iPhone was probably related to iMessage communicating with Apple's servers after the restart in an odd way and not something to worry about if it happened right at that time.\n\nA box appears asking if I want to open the applications that were open before the computer restarted because of a problem\n\nThis happens whenever an unexpected or forced shutdown occurs, and is to prevent the cause of the shutdown from reappearing if it's an application, etc.\nYou can reorder the icons in the menu bar by holding the command key and dragging them to the appropriate location.\nSpotlight indexing also sometimes occurs after a restart. Unless it is completely losing your indexed state (which would take a long while to reindex!), then this is also expected behavior.\n\nIf you're worried about the computer, then restart it and see that it restarts smoothly.

These go beyond keyUsage = digitalSignature.\nConforming Certificate\nYou need to create a certificate that conforms to macOS's codesigning requirements. You can find the requirements in Certification Authority Certification Practice Statement Developer ID:\n\n4.12.2. Code Signing Certificates\nA Code Signing Certificate issued by the Developer ID Sub-CA shall conform to the X.509 Certificate format and shall contain, at a minimum, the following data elements:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Serial Number\n  \n*Subject Distinguished Name\n  \n*Issuer Distinguished Name\n  \n*Algorithm used (RSA)\n  \n*Modulus (Size in bits)\n  \n*Validity period\n  \n*Certificate Policies extension listing the CP\n  \n*Certificate qualifiers listing this CPS (URL)\n  \n*User notice qualifier\n  \n*Extended Key Usage extension, critical, with a purpose containing Code Signing (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3)\n  \n*Developer ID Code Signing (1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.13)\n  \n*Certificate Authority Information Access extension, non-critical, with a method of obtaining certificate authority information via Online Certificate Status Protocol method.\n  \n\nFor more details, see the Security StackExchange question How to create an Apple Installer Package Signing Certificate.\nTrusted Certificate Authority\nWith a conforming certificate, you will be able to codesign your binary. For the code signature to recognised, you will need to install and trust the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate on your Mac. This needs to be done in a way that Gatekeeper trusts.\nYou can learn more about this step by searching for install root certificate mac.\n\nA: You cannot sign a program using only the public certificate. You'll need the private key in order to do so. As per your description, you have the private key in the file mykey.key, but codesign wouldn't know to look there. You'll need to have the private key imported in your Keychain.\nOn a more general level: You'll not be able to distribute programs that you have self-signed in this manner to others. You will need a valid codesigning certificate from Apple in order to do so.\n", "Q: Flash screen for Slack alerts I have enable the option to \"Flash screen when an alert sound occurs\" under Accessibility setting in System Preferences.\n\nIt works successfully with many apps such as Microsoft Outlook but not with Slack.

How do I convince macOS that Chrome is, indeed, closed?\nI have just installed macOS Mojave.\n\nA: From searching online, I think I may have run into an edge case. My best guess is that, having just installed Mojave, one of the many new permissions dialogs was generated but hidden behind another window.

Eventually, it gets changed but it takes 5-6 Caps Lock key press. \nThis happens in both cases, US → RU and RU → US.\nI have Siri disabled.\n\nA: I had the same problem. As I understand it, this is intentional behavior by Apple (they've been known to have additional delay on Caps Lock key to prevent accidental presses). Not many people notice this because it happens only when you type really fast (to reproduce just try spamming one key and press Caps Lock to switch the language at the same time – sometimes it would just be ignored).\nThere's a way to solve this – use Karabiner Elements.

Today I updated my 2014 MacBook Air to macOS Mojave 10.14.5 as it just released. After the update finished, I checked console logs and noticed in 'System Reports' there's a log named \"signpost_reporter[date & details].cpu_resource\".\nIn the console log the path is /usr/libexec/signpost_reporter, a path i've never seen before until today.\nI also updated my family's iMac to 10.14.5 but no signpost_reporter log was created after the instillation finished.\nWhat exactly is \"signpost_reporter\"? What is it's function?  Why did I get a log for it?\n\nA: The manual page for signpost_reporter states:\n\nNAME\nsignpost_reporter -- Report telemetry on intervals instrumented with\n       os_signpost to Apple\nSYNOPSIS\nsignpost_reporter should not be invoked directly\nDESCRIPTION\nsignpost_reporter is responsible for periodically gathering and reporting  telemetry about operations instrumented with os_signpost.\n\nos_signpost is a function in macOS for instrumenting specific portions of code:\n\nMarks a point of interest in your code as a time interval or as an event for debugging performance in Instruments.\n\nYou can learn more about the logging service of macOS in Apple's developer documentation, Logging.\n\nA: Signposts is a developer feature created by Apple to help developers diagnose performance problems in applications. \nEssentially developer can create a “signpost” marking the beginning and end of performance critical operations. The signpost system then automatically times these intervals and makes them available to profiling tools on the local machine.\nThe signpost_reporter program is used to report these timings back to Apple. I.e. it allows Apple to monitor performance on non-developer machines by sending the telemetry data from the signpost feature to Apple. For example Apple might be interested in knowing how often customers experience problems with a specific feature being too slow.\nWithout seeing the actual log entry, it’s not possible to say why you got a log entry for it. However rest assured that your system works just as well with and without the signpost_reporter.\n\nA: Short answer to the implied question \"can you disable this reporting?\": there appears to be no way to disable this usage of signpost\nSignpost is part of the Apple sdk and allows developers to use this telemetry without any approval by the user. It is likely used by core Apple services and apps as well as third parties. It is not opted in performance and bug reporting as others have suggested here.\nAnd despite that others seem to be trying to convince otherwise, you would right to be concerned about any telemetry that has not be opted into.\nWithout assurances with the requisite proof, privacy is definitely at-stake.

It works fine if I rename it to \"local2\". What could be causing this?\nI got this alias from my coworker who uses it regularly, and the only difference I know of is that he is not on Mojave.\nEdit: something interesting I noticed is that if I change it to alias local='echo ' then I see \nNVM_AUTO_MODE\nNVM_CURRENT\nNVM_MODE\nVERSION\n-bash: fork: Resource temporarily unavailable\n\nWhich adds evidence that it is running my local command when something is trying to  use the local variable.\n\nA: I could not recreate what you have said is happening to you. \nSaying that I would say that: It is really very dangerous to invoke local as your alias\nBecause the word local is a shell builtin, a reserved word for the default Bash shell to define a local variable in Bash script inside a Bash function. If you do type local from a new terminal window after removing it from your alias or by unalias local and then you would see it says:\nlocal is a shell builtin\n\nThat is why, when you changed your alias to local2 from local it worked fine since local2 is not a shell builtin.\nHowever, if you are using Korn Shell (version 93u+), local is not a shell builtin there. But, in most other shells local is a reserved word or shell builtin. So, in short: local should not be stored as an alias\nFor more information about shell builtin, look at man page: man builtin\nAlso, as mentioned by Gordon Davidson, there is definitely something calling the local variable and since you have overridden it as an alias for npm, it is running each time you are opening a new session.\n", "Q: efficient duplication of Time Machine backups to remote location I have been using both Arq and Time Machine for backup for years, but a year or so ago I got unlimited Google Drive space and decided to try making a remote backup (with Arq) of my Time Machine drive.\nThis may seem ridiculous, but it helps ameliorate a major problem with Arq: you can't move your remote backup from one service to another.  For example if you signed up for Amazon's drive when it was $5 a year for unlimited space, and used it for your Arq backups, and then decided not to pay $120 a year for sufficient space for your backups when Amazon said \"oh, just kidding!\" and changed their prices, you're unable to move your backup history to another location. (Since history is the whole purpose of a backup system, this is the one reason I no longer recommend Arq to anyone.  I used to enthusiastically recommend it to friends and family.)  Backing up your Time Machine disk allows you to have a remote backup that you can move from one service to another without losing any history.  (The only obvious downside is that you must first restore the whole Time Machine backup if your Time Machine disk has died and you want to change cloud provider at the same time.)\nThere is a non-obvious downside, however: Arq really sucks for this use case, for reasons I don't understand.  It gets through about 3400 GB (out of around 3600 GB) around the first day, then runs for days and days making virtually no progress, and then might at some point start to make some progress.  I don't know if I have ever seen it complete the backup. Many times I need to shut down my laptop before it completes.\nI'd like to have an efficient way to backup my Time Machine drive to a remote service.  It can't depend on (e.g.) running rsync or Resilio Sync on the remote service.  \nIn case it's relevant for any reason, I have fiber, so the bandwidth is limited by the devices on both ends and any throttling the service does, rather than by the quantity of data pushed.)\nOne thing that Arq got right is the end-to-end encryption, so any replacement should include end-to-end encryption.  I'm not about to trust anyone with everything.\n\nA: It is probably wiser to not backup the time machine backup, but instead make another backup of the computer directly.\nThe time machine format is a little finicky, as it uses a lot of tricks to save space while allowing to recover to many different dates, like reducing the amounts of dates one can go back to regularly. Even a minor corruption is likely to make it impossible to restore the backup of the backup to a functioning state. And that's exactly the situation you want the other backup for.\nIf instead you keep the backups separate, you have two completely different options to restore data if anything goes wrong, which should be useful in more situations.\nAlso, you can then use any encrypted backup solution you want.\nApart from that, here the official way to copy the time machine backup: https://support.apple.com/en-ie/HT202380\nIt suggests turning off time machine, then copying the backups.backupdb file to where you want it.\nNote that this does not help with incremental changes, which is why I think it's not the best idea.\nAnd here the closest to what you are looking for: https://www.berserkcomputers.co.uk/how-to-save-apple-time-machine-backups-to-cloud-services-like-onedrive/\nIn short, it suggests creating an encrypted image on your cloud drive with disk utility and then choose that as a backup destination.\nInstead of copying the backup disk, just select two different disks, and time machine will use them alternatingly. This way, if one gets corrupted, the other should still work.\nYou can first copy the backup db to the image so that you keep the old backups, if you like. If your backup is already damaged, that will cause issues, though. If you have no likely need to restore an older version of your OS in the future, it's better to start a new backup, as the difference is mostly deleted files.\n\nA: You haven't specified what exactly the remote service should be - except that it cannot be running rsync or Resilio Sync. Therefore you could use a backup service such as Tarsnap to backup your Time Machine drive to the cloud. Multiple such services exists with various pros/cons, but Tarsnap is a highly regarded one.\nIf you instead meant that you wanted to use an S3-compatible remote service, such as the ones Arq support, I would suggest using Rclone to clone your Time Machine backup to an S3-compatible service (i.e. Amazon S3, Backblaze B2, Digital Ocean Spaces or whatever).\nRegarding Arq: I don't think it is fair to say the it is impossible to move the backup history from one provider to another - as far as I know it is possible, but cumbersome. It requires you to manually copy over each S3 object from one provider to another, which cannot be done with Arq itself.\n", "Q: WiFi accessory connectivity issue with iOS 12 I have a WiFi to Serial accessory that I'm using with an iOS app.\nI was able to use it properly until iOS 12.\nThe app requires both Wifi (to collect data from the accessory) and Cellular (to send data to the cloud) to work. I can get either WiFi or Cellular to work separately but not at the same time except that I can access the accessory settings page over http with Safari (but not with the app over TCP). The app is using GCDAsyncSocket library for requests to the accessory.\nI've been able to get things work randomly by disconnecting the WiFi network, reconnecting it and set set WiFi assist on/off but I think that there should be a way to get things working properly.\nWhat exactly changed on iOS 12 to get things broken? \nThanks\n\nA: It is hard to say what was changed in iOS 12 as the list of changes is very long, and you haven't specified which equipment, you're using, nor which app you're running.\nHowever, I can say that behaving apps have no problems with WiFi and cellular on iOS 12. As long as the app is written to standard, you can access both at the same time without any issues - on iOS 12 as well as earlier.\nThe issues you're seeing are most often caused by incorrect network settings on the WiFi accessory. Specifically if the WiFi accessory sends out DHCP replies with a default gateway set, it is doing so incorrectly, and that can and will give problems with using cellular at the same time.\n", "Q: Option + Command + Spacebar opens Searching this mac window instead of Finder A normal Finder window used to open when I pressed Option + Command + Spacebar but not its a Search window.

It seems that the only things that can be locked are the individual elements of the slide, but not a group on the slide, nor the slide itself.\nIf you can, I'd suggest going through and ungrouping the groups in your slide, re-run your script to lock all of the individual elements on each slide, then go back and group them again (If you can group locked items, which I do not know). Depending on how or why the elements are grouped, this might have a negative visual impact on the group itself (They might not look right).\nI would have posted this as just a comment, but Stack Exchange won't let me comment yet. So here is your \"Answer\", not that it solves your problem.\n", "Q: APFS - how do I enable transparent compression How do i enable transparent filesystem compression on any APFS volume?\nOr check if it is already enabled?\nI am expecting something similiar to NTFS compressed attribute.\nAccording to Wiki it should be supported.\nIs it per file or volume ?\nI am using Mojave 10.14.0, volumes without encryption.\n\nA: The standard Mojave setup does have APFS compression implemented, but there's no user visible tools that allows you yourself to select files/folders for compression.\nIt seems that the \"ditto\" command supplied with macOS is supposed to be able to employ compression on APFS, but it only actually works with HFS+ file systems.\nHowever, even though no user visible tools comes with Mojave - the developer level APIs are actually there. A third party utility exists that uses these APIs to provide a user tool for compressing files/folders:\nhttps://github.com/RJVB/afsctool\nYou refer to the wikipedia page for your statement that APFS compression is supported. The wikipedia page actually refers to the above mentioned tool for that support.\nYou can install afsctool from Homebrew by this command:\nbrew install afsctool\n\nAnd you can install afsctool from MacPorts by this command:\nsudo port install afscompress\n\nYou can compress a file or folder like this:\nafsctool -c filename\n\nwhere filename can be the name of a file or a folder.\nYou can check if a file is compressed, and how much, by this command:\nafsctool -v filename\n\nThe built-in compression feature of APFS is implemented in the same way as it was on HFS+. That support was introduced with OS X 10.6. Even though it has thus been a part of the macOS system for almost 10 years, it is not really widely used.\nIn my own experience it just works (HFS+ or APFS - doesn't matter). However, you might run into an edge case where some program reports the file size incorrectly or something like that. I haven't seen any such misbehavior yet. The whole idea with transparent compression is that user programs do not need to know that compression is used at all.\n\nA: \nQ How do I enable transparent compression?\n\nYou don't. You can't. But keep reading.\nConceptual limitations\nThis is not \"enabled\" – for the whole filesystem – and then constantly applied, for example for newly created files. A user can only retroactively apply this filesystem compression by issuing certain direct commands, to individual files and folders. If those files get rewritten, recreated, the compression has to be re-applied 'manually'.\nUsing filesystem compression features\nWhat you can do is compress transparently individual files and folders.\n(One option for this would be using ditto or like in jksoegaard's answer,  afsctool, alternative fork)\nThis distinction is important as it sets limits on what you can compress, effectively.\nWhat to compress, and what not\nYou can compress your entire home-folder with this.\nBut that makes not much sense.\nIn part because many file types are already compressed. JPG, PNG, PDF, zip etc are all formats that usually do have some compression. Compressing them again doesn't save much space (if at all) but would add a redundant de-compression penalty on accessing them.\nIn part because how Apple implements its filesystems. Files do not get created and then added to if you amend the content. They get newly created and the old version destroyed. Newly created files don't get, and constantly changing files lose all benefit of transparent filesystem compression the next time they are written to/committed to the filesystem. This includes all temp-files, cache files, log-files, the document files you usually work on, many preferences etc.\nThus, you should only apply this to files that do not or rarely change.\nThose that are read but not written. Application files are the prime candidate for this. And often a great candidate for space saving, as some developers have really atrocious packaging and deployment habits of waste and bloat included.\nTools to use\nOn older systems: Apart from afsctool and ditto, GUI tools to achieve this would be MoreSpace Folder Compression (seems to b ediscontinued) or Clusters (v1.7.2, 13$, last updated 2014, also with problems on newer systems).\nThat means only the commandline options are currently working:\nThe built-in ditto --hfsCompression will compress files, despite the option's name, on APFS.\nafsctool will do that as well, but only an updated version/fork https://github.com/RJVB/afsctool does so without much problems.\n(As referenced in @jksoegaard's answer, only that the original works on 10.14, but too often not with files on APFS).\nNote that the version homebrew offered was for a long time only the outdated version 1.6.4. That version has had problems with APFS and is not recommended. As of April 2022, homebrew also uses the forked version 1.7.2.\nTo get the newer/forked version that works well with APFS you need to install from source or resort to Macports for easier installation (and now homebrew as well).\nOn Macports however the binary installed for this fork is called afscompress!\n(If you port install afsctool you'll get the outdated 1.6.4 version!)\nThat used to be the same with brew install afsctool. But since April 2022 the brewed afsctool works on APFS/Mojave+ — and with the name of the executable binary still as the regular afsctool !\nIn other words: Macports has a 'working fine on APFS' version called afscompress, and the outdated afsctool, homebrew has now also a good version with a name unchanged.\nPrecautions for unexpected consequences\nFurther, you have to be a bit careful in using this.\nUnexpected results are very rare, but exist.\nFor example, a binary of grep seizes to function and compressing git results in your git-repos becoming unreadable unless you revert that compression (the repositories are still fine).\nSome GUI applications do perform some 'homebrewed tamper detection' that might fail if they are compressed in this way. You might never run into one of those, but it's still best to have a backup ready and proceed in smaller steps, not by compressing all at once.\n\nAll subquestions answered:\n\nQ How do I enable transparent filesystem compression on any APFS volume?\n\nTool of choice is now afscompress commandline tool.\nTo compress your Documents folder:\nafscompress -c ~/Documents\n   \n\n\nQ Or check if it is already enabled?\n\nafscompress FILE would do this.\nOutput to expect:\n\n File is HFS+/APFS compressed.\n\n\n\nQ I am expecting something similar to NTFS compressed attribute. According to Wiki it should be supported.\n\nIt is, kind of, with some caveats.\nSince OS 10.6.\nBut Apple has no GUI tools for a user to use it.\nIf a compressed file is re-saved again, exported etc, the new file will be uncompressed again.\nSo the compression used has to be re-applied.\nSlightly outdated info here:\nUnix commands for managing HFS+ compression in OS X\n\nQ Is it per file or volume?\n\nPer file.\n\nQ I am using Mojave 10.14.0, volumes without encryption.\n\nAs long as you don't use the outdated afsctool, 10.14 is fine. APFS is fine. Encryption doesn't matter for this.\n", "Q: What's the PCI Compatibility for Mac Pro, Early 2008? I have a Mac Pro, Early 2008, (MacPro3,1) running Mojave. I'd like to add a PCI card for USB 3. Lots of USB cards advertise Mac Pro compatibility, but don't get specific as to models. What do I look for to verify that a card will work with my machine?\n\nA: The everymac.com website reports the following (which basically is the same as Apple reports:\n\nThis model has two PCIe x4 expansion slots and two PCIe 2.0 x16 expansion slots (in the default confugration one PCIe 2.0 x16 slot is occupied by the graphics card). Apple also reports that \"all slots provide mechanical support for 16-lane cards [and supports] 300W combined maximum for all PCI Express slots.\"\n\nNote: The two PCIe x4 expansion slots are actually PCIe 1.1 x4 expansion slots. PCIe 1.1 has the same data rate as PCIe 1.0.\nWikipedia offers a nice table which is repeated below.\n\nBelow is a quote from Wikipedia regarding USB 3.0.\n\nUSB 3.0 adds the new transfer rate referred to as SuperSpeed USB (SS) that can transfer data at up to 5 Gbit/s (625 MB/s), which is about 10 times faster than the USB 2.0 standard. \n\nWikipedia also has the table shown below.\n\nAlmost everything made for PCIe and USB is as backward compatible as reasonably as possible. Which means some cards may work in your Mac, but not necessary at at a high enough speed to get the performance advantages of USB 3.\nThis OWC website offers a Allegro USB 3.0 4-Port card for $59 (USD) and explicitly states the card is for your model Mac. However, how the card preforms depends on the slot you use. Under \"Bus Interface\", the specifications state \"PCI Express 2.0 x1\", where \"PCI Express means \"PCIe\" and \"x1\" means the card only has a single lane for data. According to the \"PCI Express link performance\" table, if you put the card in the PCIe 2.0 slot, then the transfer between the card and the Mac will occurs at 500 MB/s. According to the \"USB 3.2 transfer modes\" table USB 3.1 Gen 1 (or USB 3.0) transfers data a 625 MB/s. So the actual transfer rate to the Mac will be the lower of the two which is the PCIe speed of 500 MB/s. If you use one of the PCIe slots in your Mac, then the transfer rate will be only 250 MB/s.\nThis OWC website offers a Allegro USB-C 4-Port card for $149 (USD), which is also for your model Mac. Again, how the card preforms depends on the slot you use. Under \"Bus Interface\", this time the specifications state \"PCI Express 2.0 x4\", which means this card has a four lanes for data. According to the \"PCI Express link performance\" table, if you put the card in the PCIe 2.0 slot, then the transfer between the card and the Mac will occurs at 2 GB/s. According to the \"USB 3.2 transfer modes\" table USB 3.1 Gen 2 transfers data a 1.25 MB/s. So the actual transfer rate to the Mac will be the lower of the two which is USB speed of 1.25 MB/s. If you use one of the PCIe slots in your Mac, then the transfer rate will be only 1 GB/s. While this would not slow down a USB 3.1 Gen 1 (or USB 3.0) device, it would limit a USB 3.1 Gen 2 device from 1.25 GB/s to 1 GB/s. \n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut (almost) never works for Automator service I have bash script that creates a screenshot in a given directory saved as an Automator service.

I then receive an email from Google: \"Your new Device doesn't have the latest Google apps\".\nWhile I understand and expect that the data on Google Docs and Sheets is far from private, it is also well within reason for Google to record what I download from them and what I do not. If the Google app realizes I have a new device, it makes me wonder what else it is accessing.\nHow do I assess and measure how much privacy has been ceded to Google?  For example, I have not installed Google Maps, because I find it creepy in an Orwellian sense, that it records where you have been.\n\nA: After you install any of the apps published by Google on your iPhone, it can determine whether you have the other Google apps installed on your iPhone by using the following API call available in iOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*canOpenURL: - UIApplication\nBased on this, it could be determined what apps you do not have installed on your iPhone, and Google can suggest you to install them.\nAn iOS app can be assigned a custom URL scheme by it's developer. It's using URL scheme that your iPhone is able to directly launch say for e.g. YouTube or Google Maps app if link for the same is tapped in any of the other apps.\nThis specific instance isn't necessarily a privacy violation as Google is simply using one of the APIs made available by Apple. When it comes to apps, Google is just another 3rd-party app publisher on iOS and has to adhere to same privacy restrictions like every other developer.\nP.S.: While it could be argued that Google's privacy stance is not as strong as Apple, they are bound to adhere to restrictions imposed by Apple as they are no different from other 3rd-party app developers for iOS and generally do not get any elevated privileges.\n\nA: The best way to assess how much privacy you've ceded to Google is to review their privacy policy.  No other site or company will provide you a more accurate look at what Google does with your info than Google itself. \nGoogle can know what other Google apps you have installed on your device based on assigning your device a unique key and then having every other Google app look for that key and report back.  If the only app that's reported back is their spreadsheet app then that's how they know.  This doesn't necessarily mean that Google knows every app on your device, though.\nRemember that any other app that uses Google's services, such as login ability or analytics, means that those apps are also reporting back to Google.  \nAs far as how to measure the privacy you've ceded, I don't think that's possible.  Regardless of what the measurement shows, when you visit a new web page or add/remove an app, that measurement could change.\n", "Q: mac mini multi-display reconfiguring repeatedly I have a new mac-mini with HDMI + 2 thunderbolt-hdmi adapters.\nWaking up the mini results in screen blanking repeatedly as it adds and removes displays.\nRepeatedly.\nLike 20 times.\nFor 2+ minutes.\nI blame displaypolicyd but cannot find any documentation related to it.\nThe output in /var/log/displaypolicy/displaypolicyd.IGPU.log updates during the blanking, having entries like:\nu>234091110954 LinkUpdate: 2.0 event: Insert [0]\nu>234091111015 NOTICE: Addr: 2.0 event: Insert [0] source: 0\nu>234091271092 NOTICE: Do online device addr 2.0 processCount 1\nu>234091279665 NOTICE: Sync LinkTrain Port: 2: SST, 2 lanes @ HBR2\nu>234091363536 NOTICE: FB AGDC state FB[0] - ON\nu>234091363604 NOTICE: inject FB[0] change\nu>234091400720 NOTICE: Do online device addr 2.0 - completed\nu>234091685347 NOTICE: kIOFBNotifyOnlineChange 0x6 fb[ 0 ] -> online, Wed May 15 12:37:36 2019\nu>234091685426 NOTICE: Update display map to fb[ 0 ] - online\nu>234094043845 LinkUpdate: 2.0 event: Remove [1]\nu>234094055235 NOTICE: Addr: 2.0 event: Remove [1] source: 0\nu>234094055258 NOTICE: Do offline device addr 2.0 flags 0x0\nu>234094055276 NOTICE: FB AGDC state FB[0] - OFF\nu>234094055316 NOTICE: inject FB[0] change\nu>234094237162 NOTICE: kIOFBNotifyOnlineChange 0x7 fb[ 0 ] -> offline, Wed May 15 12:37:38 2019\nu>234094237198 NOTICE: Update display map to fb[ 0 ] - offline\nu>234094237208 NOTICE: Release fb[ 0 ] resources\nu>234094237244 NOTICE: Do LT off on port 2\nu>234094237264 NOTICE: Port[2] - DP link down\nu>234095319140 LinkUpdate: 2.0 event: Insert [0]\nu>234095321284 NOTICE: Addr: 2.0 event: Insert [0] source: 0\nu>234095492773 NOTICE: Do online device addr 2.0 processCount 1\nu>234095501124 NOTICE: Sync LinkTrain Port: 2: SST, 2 lanes @ HBR2\nu>234095583915 NOTICE: FB AGDC state FB[0] - ON\nu>234095583964 NOTICE: inject FB[0] change\nu>234095618927 NOTICE: Do online device addr 2.0 - completed\nu>234095916433 NOTICE: kIOFBNotifyOnlineChange 0x6 fb[ 0 ] -> online, Wed May 15 12:37:40 2019\nu>234095916542 NOTICE: Update display map to fb[ 0 ] - online\n\nWhy cant it just wake up and keep the last display configuration it had?\nI'm tempted to play with the config, but fear rendering the mini display-less.\nupdate:\nThe Thunderbolt-HDMI adapters are Apple D200s seen here:\nhttps://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ1K2AM/A/usb-c-digital-av-multiport-adapter\nThe displays are Dell U3415W and two Dell U2413s.\nNo DisplayLink adapters are involved (though I have several of those laying about).\n\nA: Had similar issues for awhile, resolved via...\n\n\n*\n\n*Changing combination of adapters / cables / ports as underlying ASICs (Application-specific Integrated Circuits) seemed to have different preferences / properties / thresholds.\n\n*Disabling 'Energy Saving' / 'Eco' / Etc. mode on connected displays.\n\n*Connecting displays to non-'eco controlled' (master / slave) outlets on surge protector / UPS (if using one).\nMy assumptions are (and flag if you wish to, anyone ; ) a combination of utilized ASICs in active / passive adapters & cables ± the state of software / hardware development and compatibility across vendors.\nSome references which outline the spec as well as some of the same / similar issues below but, essentially, getting Apple, VESA / DisplayPort, DisplayLink, third-party vendors, etc. all on the same page and playing perfectly nice with each other can be… 'tough'.\n(Apparently I can't actually share all the links to the references so… workaround = shared Evernote here.)\nP.S.

The lack of boot screens means no startup menu support when holding the option key.\nI've done a lot of digging and I understand that newer Macs using bootcamp alongside APFS correctly show the OS X disk as a startup disk in the bootcamp control panel under windows. That is how I ended up with the question above- wondering if anyone has taken the time to figure out what drivers or what specific components in the bootcamp ESD for those macs changed and allowed APFS to work correctly with regards  to the \"Restart in OS X\" bootcamp option under windows.\n\nA: Trying to get a \"more recent Mac's bootcamp installer\" is the wrong approach to take in a effort to solve your problem. Especially, since there are other ways to solve your problem which involve using the rEFInd Boot Manager. This free software is capable of instructing the firmware to boot Mojave.  \nOne solution involves creating a small 300 MB \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" volume where rEFInd is installed. Here, rEFInd is configured to appear as a legacy OS X operating system. The Boot Camp software installed in your Windows operation system will detected this volume as OS X. When booting from this volume, rEFInd will automatically instruct the firmware to reboot to Mojave. This is setup to happen silently. \n\nNote: The rEFInd Startup Manager executes silently and therefore does not require user input. \n\nAn example of how to setup rEFInd as described is given as the accepted answer to the question: macOS partition disappered after installing windows 10 using bootcamp.\n", "Q: Prevent Mac terminal from changing tabs when reopened Whenever I open the terminal app after it was minimized, it often changes tab and go back to a particular tab (which tab in particular is not very important). Can someone suggest a workaround for this problem?\nCurrently on Mojave OSX (10.14.4) and had this problem with High Sierra too previously. \n\nA: How about instead of minimising by pressing minimise button, using ⌘  H (COMMAND H) instead? Then it will not shift to the oldest tab. \nThen, use ⌘ ⇥ (COMMAND TAB) to navigate the terminal.\n", "Q: Restore Downloads icon to Finder Sidebar So I symlinked my Downloads folder from my boot drive to an external HDD I always keep connected to my mac.

I would like to not have to erase my account to do that.\nI have set up another User Account for them without Administrator Privileges.\nThey need to use my laptop for development and will probably require sudo access at some point. \n\nIs there a way for me to allow them sudo access but not allow them access to any data stored for my own user.\nAnecdotally, this does not sound possible, because sudo access would mean the highest access on the machine so everything will be accessible.\nIs there any other way to achieve this without having to erase my data?\nI found this question that is looking for ways to encrypt each user folder separately but without answers.\n\nA: The Answer:\nYes, it's definitely possible. sudo is designed to implement fine-grained security policies. As an example of fine-grained, sudo can be configured to allow a user to run a particular command, but exclude certain options for the command. Don't get sudo confused with su.\nAnd so, when you say, \"sudo access would mean the highest access on the machine so everything will be accessible\", that's simply not true. IMHO, sudo was made to order for the exact problem you are faced with: \"How do I give a user access to resources he needs to do his job, without giving him the run of the castle?\" You may also appreciate the fact that sudo performs extensive logging of all sudo usage. This provides accountability for all sudo users because, unlike su, users execute sudo from their account, not the root account. \nHere are two examples to illustrate this point. These are two entries that would go in the sudoers file - the file that defines a user's privileges under sudo. In the first example, the user friend will be given \"access to everything\"; i.e. unlimited root privileges: \nExample: sudo for Full root Privileges\nfriend   ALL = (ALL) ALL  \n\nIn the next example, the user friend will only be given privileges to run the software update option (-U) on the utility youtube-dl. This specification will confer root privileges to run only this one command with this one option (although in this case most of the other options do not require root privileges.): \nExample: sudo for Limited root Privileges\nfriend   ALL = (ALL) /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl -U\n\nA Brief Overview of sudo:\nI can't explain sudo in the space of this answer. As you'll see that simply is not possible. Instead, I'll try to provide provide a \"walking tour\" with some references that will give you a better understanding of what sudo can (and can't) do, and how to configure sudo to implement the security policy you want. \n\n\n*\n\n*Todd Miller currently maintains sudo as he has since 1994. That probably makes him the godfather of sudo.  \n\n*There is a prodigious amount of documentation on sudo, including many older versions - including ver. 1.8.17p1 used in the current version of macos (Mojave, 10.14.5). \n\n*Perhaps a good place to begin learning about sudo is in a nutshell \n\n*Having read this nutshell overview, you now know that sudo is typically configured using the sudoers file. This is where you will create the specifications that implement your security policy; the specifications that define what resources your friend can access while using your machine. \n\n*Again, there's a lot of documentation. You'll want to read man sudo (ver 1.8.17 online), and man sudoers (ver 1.8.17 online). OK, skim through it at least, and study the EXAMPLES :) And BTW, your friend will need to read man sudo also, as he'll be using it! \n\n*Once you've decided what resources your friend needs, you can prepare to tackle actually editing/creating your own sudoers file. But there are some things you should know first:  \n\n\n*\n\n*The sudoers file should only be edited with visudo. To access it, you'll need to be logged in as (or su to) the \"admin\" user on your Mac. Upon entering the command shown below, the Sample sudoers file will be opened in your admin user's default editor (I've set mine to nano). \n\n*Know that editing the sudoers file carries risks. Minimze those risks by NEVER editing sudoers except through the visudo app. visudo is designed to validate the syntax of the sudoers file when it is saved. That won't save you from errors that have the correct syntax of course, but it's far less likely that you'll leave your machine in an unusable state! \nMaking changes to the sudoers file:\nAnd so: To edit the sudoers file, login as (or su to) the admin user, open a terminal window, and enter: \nbash-3.2$ sudo visudo\nPassword:                # you'll need to enter your admin user's password here\n\nThe editor specified in your environment will open, and the sudoers file will be listed. The User specifications section is near the end of the file; you can insert one of the example lines from above, taking care not to edit either of the existing lines: \n\nroot            ALL = (ALL) ALL\n  %admin          ALL = (ALL) ALL\n  # insert your additions below here; e.g.:\n  friend   ALL = (ALL) /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl -U  \n\nWhen you finish your edits, write the modified file, then exit the editor. visudo will automatically check the syntax of your sudoers file, and alert you if it finds a problem. You should never override these alerts; find and fix the issue, or simply comment out your changes until you do. \nUsing sudoedit to limit access to files\nOne final example: You wanted to grant sudo access, but not allow access to any data stored for your user. For purposes of this example I'll assume that you want to give your friend the ability to edit the file /etc/fstab.hd (a do-nothing file), and all files in the directory /etc/ssh.\nYou can use the sudoedit specification in the sudoers file to grant your friend access to files or entire directories that you specify. Here's how to accomplish that: \n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo visudo to open the sudoers file for editing. \n\n*As previously, enter the following sudoedit lines just below those you added previously; i.e. \n\nroot            ALL = (ALL) ALL\n  %admin          ALL = (ALL) ALL\n  # insert your additions below here; e.g.:\n  friend   ALL = (ALL) /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl -U\n  # insert sudoedit specs below here:\n  friend          ALL = (root) sudoedit /etc/ssh/*\n  friend          ALL = (root) sudoedit /etc/fstab.hd   \n\nTo edit these files, your friend will enter the following command(s) in a terminal window: \nMyMacBook:~ friend$ sudo -e /etc/fstab.hd  \n\n# or...\n\nMyMacBook:~ friend$ sudo -e /etc/ssh/ssh_config\n\n# which will open the specified file in `friend's` specified editor\n\nLimits of sudo\nYou should also keep in mind that sudo has its limits. \nFirst and foremost, sudo is used to get  root privileges for a user from the command line (Terminal). It has no role in determining privileges anywhere else in the system; e.g. to add a new user in System Preferences. Outside the shell then, the authorization database controls access privileges, and sudo has no relevance. You may need a tool like this to manipulate the authorization database. {02/29/20 Edit: authbuddy is no longer maintained; its author suggests Apple's security tool instead. See man security from the CLI, or this html version }\nSecondly, sudo should NOT be considered as a tool to harden the system against malicious users. Rather, it's simply a tool for reducing risk and increasing accountability for authorized users. That's not to say it \"rolls over\", it's only to say that its purpose is not system hardening. \nThis seems like a good point to stop, and catch our breath :) Your question did not include any specific security goals or policies, so it doesn't seem to make sense to prattle on with more examples (and there are plenty of those available for the cost of a Google search). However, if you do want help with specific configurations, you can either edit your question here, or post a new question. And don't forget that as sudo is available on virtually all *nix platforms, there are other SE sites that may prove useful: SuperUser SE and Unix&Linux SE are two examples. \n\nOther potentially useful resources related to sudo: \n\n\n*\n\n*AppleGazette on editing the sudoers file   \n\n*AP Lawrence on Using sudo  \n\n*Using sudoedit to limit file editing to a specific directory/ies  \n\n*More on sudoedit (aka sudo -e, aka sudo --edit)  \n\n*What's So Great About sudoedit?  \n\n*Good general (not Mac-specific) help from from Digital Ocean  \n\n*The sudo command, Part 2 of a 4-part series on \"Demystifying root\"\n\nA: Once somebody has sudo rights they can access basically any non-encrypted files of other users easily. They can even copy encrypted files and use whatever tool they can get their hands on to crack the encryption. Also, with a lot of important stuff stored within ~/Library it might not be enough to just move Documents to an encrypted DMG.\nSo from the top of my head I see two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in as administrator and create an encrypted volume with the content of /Users/your-main-user, then remove the unencrypted folder content. Beside the caveat above it might be easier to just backup everything and delete the user\n\n*Set up remote access, ensure that you can run sudo if accessing through ssh and then have your friend ping you whenever they need to run sudo\nPS: There might also be some (not totally safe) ways to restrict sudo to certain commands, but for this you need to know these commands upfront.\n", "Q: How to recover Mac Startup Security Utility? \nTo boot up with external disk, I launched into a startup security utility. \nThe standard startup security utility shows the menus like above. \nBut my startup security utility only shows the Firmware password protection menu without any options about Secure boot and External Boot. \nHow to recover startup security utility? \nOS version: 10.14.5 Mojave\nDevice version: 2017 MacBook Pro\nThe way to startup security utility: Press cmd + R on boot\n\nA: The reason you can't access the Startup Security Utility is because it doesn't exist for your model of MacBook Pro.\nMore specifically, Startup Security Utility is only available on Mac computers that have the Apple T2 Security Chip.

I'm not sure if this issue is specific to macs, but I'm guessing it is because mac has its own special scrolling features.\nAlmost every website and app on a mac has a specific feel to its scrolling.

Apart from those, Coherence always displays a dock icon for the VM itself. My use-case is that I'm running the VM for only one program, which I display in Coherence 1 so not to have it rendered with a title bar on top 2. I'd now like to remove the VM icon, as I can do without its functions (shutdown guest OS, open cmd, etc).\nHere are the things I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've tried the info.plist method best described here, as applied to the info.plist of the VM icon (⌘+click its icon to reach its location). Didn't work.\n\n*I've used Dock Dodger. Didn't work. Presumably because it seems to do exactly the same as the above's method.\n\n*I've used Ghost Tile. Worked. And here's the problem - the reliance on it. The app is essentially free, but needing it in the first place goes against maintaining a minimal setup, and most importantly it's a fragile solution as the app is prone to disappearance down the years (as it happened with Dock Dodger, which is now distributed via an assortment of non-official hosts).\n\n\nI've also asked in the Parallels forum. Their response is understandable in that the feature would seemingly break functionality for common users. However, it actually shouldn't affect much at all in the right hands, as you can still control the hidden VM from the terminal, or the main Parallels icon.\nI'd like to see a solution that is more future-proof and universal (the info.plist method seems not to work for a lot of apps). After all, Ghost Tile is doing something right, and as far as i can tell, it hasn't been documented openly in the many threads active about hiding dock icons.\n\nA: It's pretty ridiculous that this slipped both me and Parallels's support to the point that I went through all the effort above, but there it is - if you go to Parallels's preferences, this setting is under General > Virtual Machine icon.

(I have used Arrangement to make sure they are connected correctly left to right, so mouse movement works correctly.) The leftmost is the primary with the dock. However, the middle display is call \"Display 3\" and the rigtmost is \"Display 2\". Even if I swap the cables, it still stays the same, so OSX must remember the displayid. This is a problem because Desktop numbering (in Spaces) are out of sequence rigt to left across the displays. It is also confusing that when you assign an app to a display, you have to remember that 3 is the middle display. I know I could just physically swap display 2 and 3, but can this be solved through macOS Display settings? :-)\nAny suggestion on how one can reassign the numbering of the displays?\n\nA: This is a very annoying problem and I have not found any official documentation on how to control the numbering of the Desktop on each monitor. However, through a lot of trial and error, I've discovered these rules that will help you order the Desktop numbers.\nFirst, a few key points on how the numbering behaves\n\n*\n\n*Your 'Home Screen' (the display with the Dock) will always have the lowest number (e.g. Desktop 1, Desktop 2 if it has 2 desktops)\n\n*When you drag the Dock (in Displays >> Arrangement) from one display to another, it will swap the numbering between the two monitors that you dragged it to and from. For example if you have 3 monitors that is setup as follow\n\n\n*\n\n*Monitor A (Desktop 1, Desktop 2) ==DOCK LOCATION==\n\n*Monitor B (Desktop 3, Desktop 4)\n\n*Monitor C (Desktop 5, Desktop 6)\n\nIf you drag the DOCK from Monitor A to B, you'll end up with the following:\n\n*\n\n*Monitor A (Desktop 3, Desktop 4)\n\n*Monitor B (Desktop 1, Desktop 2) ==DOCK LOCATION==\n\n*Monitor C (Desktop 5, Desktop 6)\n\nTherefore, by planning the sequence of DOCK position swaps, you can reach the final ordering that you desire.\nThe ordering may get messed up again if you disconnect the monitors or return from sleep or restart. I have no idea how to 'save' the settings. But at least this will help you reconfigure quickly.\n\nA: I had the same problem and the answer on a similar post fixed it.\nIt turns out all you have to do is go to System Preferences > Displays and then drag the top white bar to the display that you want to be first.\n", "Q: Connect and run commands over SSH using script I'm using a series of commands for deploying my files to production.

Changes to your script are bolded.\n\n#!/usr/bin/expect -f\nspawn ssh root@server\nexpect \"*: \"\nsend \"xxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nexpect \"$ \"\nsend \"… commands\n\nspawn starts the command as normal, which in this case is SSH\nexpect waits until the matching text is shown on screen\nsend enters the text given, which can be a password or command to be run\nexpect waits for the shell to be shown (this should be changed to match against your shell $PS1)\nSave this file, add the executable bit (chmod +x /path/to/file) and open to run the commands.\n\nHowever, instead of this, you should be using SSH keys to connect to the server without entering a password, and the commands you wish to execute over SSH should be in a script on the server which can be run. Set up SSH keys, then you can run a remote script with ssh -t root@server \"/path/to/script\".\n\nA: I would suggest you use ssh-copy-id to grant your computer automated ssh access to the remote server of your choice. The utility is found under /usr/bin/ on most systems (including recent versions of macOS). On older macOS versions you can run\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub |\n    ssh johnfoo@0.0.0.0 \"[ -d ~/.ssh ] || mkdir ~/.ssh; cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\"\n\nThen it is trivial to execute a script already on the remote server: \nssh -t johnfoo@0.0.0.0 /Users/johnfoo/myscript.sh\n\nIf necessary you can create such script locally and use scp to transfer it to the remote server at the location of your choice: \nscp myscriptscript.sh johnfoo@0.0.0.0:/Users/johnfoo/myscript.sh \n\nBut if your script is relatively short - I would simply run it from the terminal session invoking a here document after your ssh command:\nssh -t johnfoo@0.0.0.0 <<< END_OF_COMMAND\nssh-agent bash\nssh-add bi-master\ncd /home/trans/bimaster\ngit status\ngit pull git@bitbucket.org:xxxxxxxxx/bimaster.git master\nEND_OF_COMMAND\n\n", "Q: Macbook Pro macOS upgrade without losing applications (not owned under my Apple ID) I bought a pre-owned Macbook Pro that is currently running Sierra. It came with the Adobe Suite and a number of other expensive applications. I was told that I would lose these apps if I were to update the operating system. Is there a way to circumvent this?\n\nA: The update process deletes no application, so the update doesn’t make you lose anything. Upgrade processes can migrate known broken software to a new location, but there’s almost always a log file explaining what and why that happened.\nHowever, you can’t roll back an update if an application breaks, so you might lose the ability of the program to use a license key, be supported, or even launch/run when your system changes.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a good Time Machine backup or other clone / backup so if your system breaks (whether you break it unintentionally with an update you apply, whether it breaks due to an update that self-applies or whether it breaks due to breakage, eventually all programs will stop running).\n\n*Think if you can reinstall the app if you erase your Mac, reinstall the older version / unpatched version in terms of time and hassle and knowledge.\n\n*Check with the vendor so you know your support options, both DIY / Free / Paid - this is key since the vendor can even kill your apps without an upgrade. In fact, Adobe just did this: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/05/13/adobe-warning-of-legal-problems-if-users-keep-using-old-versions-of-creative-cloud-apps\nIn general, it’s safe to upgrade since Apple designs the system to not touch apps and settings, but even with that design, sometimes a bug ships and you get breakage for something that should have been easy and non-intrusive.\n", "Q: How to use lock screen events as a trigger for a script? My Magic Mouse 2 died today and I thought it would be cool if I could use the locking of the screen as a trigger to send a push notification to my iPhone to remind me to plug my mouse in to charge.\nI looked into it a little bit.  There is an app called EventScripts that has a screen saver trigger.  I tried out the demo, but it's too slow.\nI also learned that I can send push notifications via script from my Mac to my iPhone using Prowl/Growl.\nAnd I found that one of the system logs (/var/log/DiagnosticMessages/*) contains activeScreenSaver events that show up immediately when I watch the console.  It would be great if I could just send a prowl push notification whenever activeScreenSaver appears in that log.,  I know how to send the push, however all the files in /var/log/DiagnosticMessages are binary.  I can grep them for activeScreenSaver and see that there are matches, but I don't have one file in ASCII that I can apply tail -f to and pipe it to a script that watches for activeScreenSaver occurrences and sends the push...  Does anyone know how I could watch those files for activeScreenSaver occurrences?  I've written similar log parsers for other plain text logs before, but I don't know where to start when I'm dealing with binary files that change every so often.\nBTW, I have tried using an iBeacon for reminders, but by the time I get the notification, I'm too lazy to go back to my desk to plug the mouse in.  So I'd love to get the push notification right after I lock the screen... at least until it becomes habit.\nUPDATE:\nThrough more googling, I discovered I could do this:\ncat 2019.05.17.asl | strings - -o | grep activeScreenSaver\n 290676 (com.apple.ScreenSaver.activeScreenSaver\n 452746 (com.apple.ScreenSaver.activeScreenSaver\n 481785 (com.apple.ScreenSaver.activeScreenSaver\n\nNote, I used -o to show the matching line number so I could tell which events were which.\nHowever, that did not include all of my lock screen test events today.  I searched through the raw strings output and discovered that if I did this instead, I got all the events from today (when I compared it to what I see in the Console app when searching for activeScreenSaver):\ncat 2019.05.17.asl | strings - -o | grep \"QuartzCore,ScreenSaver\"\n 290278 nAppKit,GLEngine,Flurry,QuartzCore,ScreenSaver,libdispatch.dylib,CoreFoundation,HIToolbox,Direct,libdyld.dylib\n 443512 nAppKit,GLEngine,Flurry,QuartzCore,ScreenSaver,libdispatch.dylib,CoreFoundation,HIToolbox,Direct,libdyld.dylib\n 481387 nAppKit,GLEngine,Flurry,QuartzCore,ScreenSaver,libdispatch.dylib,CoreFoundation,HIToolbox,Direct,libdyld.dylib\n 482889 nAppKit,GLEngine,Flurry,QuartzCore,ScreenSaver,libdispatch.dylib,CoreFoundation,HIToolbox,Direct,libdyld.dylib\n 486926 nAppKit,GLEngine,Flurry,QuartzCore,ScreenSaver,libdispatch.dylib,CoreFoundation,HIToolbox,Direct,libdyld.dylib\n 488824 nAppKit,GLEngine,Flurry,QuartzCore,ScreenSaver,libdispatch.dylib,CoreFoundation,HIToolbox,Direct,libdyld.dylib\n 501148 nAppKit,GLEngine,Flurry,QuartzCore,ScreenSaver,libdispatch.dylib,CoreFoundation,HIToolbox,Direct,libdyld.dylib\n 504036 nAppKit,GLEngine,Flurry,QuartzCore,ScreenSaver,libdispatch.dylib,CoreFoundation,HIToolbox,Direct,libdyld.dylib\n\nI thought I was good to go, but when I tried tail -f instead of cat, the output was truncated:\ntail -c +1 -f 2019.05.17.asl | strings - -o | grep \"QuartzCore,ScreenSaver\"\n 290278 nAppKit,GLEngine,Flurry,QuartzCore,ScreenSaver,libdispatch.dylib,CoreFoundation,HIToolbox,Direct,libdyld.dylib\n 443512 nAppKit,GLEngine,Flurry,QuartzCore,ScreenSaver,libdispatch.dylib,CoreFoundation,HIToolbox,Direct,libdyld.dylib\n\nI'm not sure why tail -f stops in the middle of the file...  Plus, I would still have to figure out how to update the tail when the file changes...\ntail -F gets me farther - to the current end of the file, but new entries added to the file do not spit out.\nAlso, I tried a few homebrew versions of tail which I had hoped would allow the monitoring of multiple files, but none of them were able to handle the binary files...\nInterestingly, if I don't pipe the output of strings to anything, I see live messages continually come out.  But if I pipe to grep of a perl on-liner, the stream just dies half way through.\n\nA: Well, this was easy.  I just needed to come at the issue fresh.  Apparently, tailing a system log file has to be done as the super user:\nsudo tail -c +1 -F 2019.05.17.asl | strings - -o | grep \"QuartzCore,ScreenSaver\"\n\nPutting sudo in front allows output to continue to be spit out when the screen is locked.\n", "Q: Photos.app is not syncing when using hotspot. How to treat hotspot as a regular Wi-Fi on macOS? Recently I started use hotspot as my home internet. I have unlimited data and high speeds 160/40 Mbps. Everything works well except Photos.app. It just doesn't sync even a single photo.\nI contacted Apple support, but it's just a big facepalm.\nThey asked me to test this problem with other iPhones and MacBooks.\nI tested with over 5 devices, as I expected the result was the same.\nI wrote them and provided steps to reproduce the problem, but their answer was:\n\nThank you for the Response. Since the issue is happening on more than 1 iPhone, as I discussed when we spoke on the phone the first time, Its due to the computer needing a stronger connection other than hotspot. There is no need move forward with troubleshooting at this point due to the same thing happening on all the Apple products you have tried.  As discussed, we would have continued troubleshooting only if the issue didn’t persist on another Apple product, because then it would have shown that its device specific and this it is not because its all the Apple products you have tried. Thank you for understanding.\n\nSo that's why I am looking for the answer on how to treat hotspot as a regular Wi-Fi on macOS.\nmacOS 10.14.5; iOS 12.3\n\nA: So, finally I got the workaround to solve this issue.\nYou need to setup a VPN connection for that.\nProbably you can use any VPN connection, but I used OpenVPN and used Viscosity as a client.\nYou can install OpenVPN either locally or using remote server using this bash script.\nAfter connecting to the VPN it assumes that it connected to the real internet not a Wi-Fi hotspot. I assume that it's because it cannot access iPhone router IP address. So theoretically blocking iPhone's local network could work as well.\n\nA: This issue continues to trouble me in the year 2022. While Nick's answer is excellent, I am offering a possibly-simpler alternative solution. That is to use a wifi range extender. Many routers in the current market offer this function as well. Despite using iPhone's hotspot as the internet source, the WIFI from the extender/router will be recognised as a regular home WIFI. For me, iCloud and photo syncing on MAC have been working like a charm ever since!\n\nA: In the meantime I found an other solution for this problem so it can be an option to disconnect the iCloud account from the phone. This way the iPhone is not associated with the Mac used by the same iCloud login and also the personal hotspot could work separately.\nAnyway this option is really circumstantial and inconvenient so the detailed vpn solution would be much better for me.\nUnfortunately I haven't enough reputation to add a comment to your previous respond but every plus instruction is welcomed from my side and I also ask the admins to not delete this answer or make from this block a comment manually because I don't have any other option to contact with Nick Walker in connection with this issue.\n", "Q: Running an app build with very old iOS SDK on a device running current iOS I have 2 iOS devices, an iPhone 6s, and an iPhone 4.

My Xcode version is 5.1.0.\nWill I be able to deploy an app using Xcode 5 on my iPhone 6s?\n\nA: Xcode 5.1.0 include iOS 7.1 SDK. You cannot debug an app build with this Xcode/iOS SDK combination on your iPhone 6s running iOS 12.2 (iOS 12 was non-existent when Xcode 5.1 was released and Xcode is not aware of it).\nYou can however, in-theory generate the app IPA and deploy it on iOS 12. iOS 11 and later require your app to have executable support for 64-bit mode. So you need to make sure to build your iOS app with 64-bit mode.\nHowever, you may end up hitting roadblocks as iOS 7 is ancient in terms of how iOS has evolved.

I am trying to make some Smart Folders to compensate for the woefully useless Recents folder but I am having some problems trying to filter out things I don't want to appear.\nOne of them is excluding anything that is anywhere within the $HOME/Library directory or some approximation of that. I looked into the additional file attributes that are usable as search criteria that can be used in making a Smart Folder (in other words, the list that comes up when you click \"other\" in the search criteria menu) for things like \"path\", \"has parent directory\", or anything similar which would indicate the file/folder is buried in $HOME/Library somewhere. \"Name\" only pertains to actual file name and \"Document Container\" only pertains to the immediate parent directory.

Thus you can't search for files by path. You also can't ask it to find or exclude files by their parent folder.\nYou thus need to resort to a two-step process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run a search against the Spotlight index.

It flashes from ?Folder, to an also flashing net recovery globe, and every so often an Apple logo for a few seconds, but never actually boots into the OS.\nAfter an extensive internet search, the only results were to use the Mac OS X (command-R) recovery process.\nI’ve tried everything I could find online regarding MacBook recovery, but they all refer to a globe to network restore, but I have yet to see a flashing globe like what I'm experiencing.\nThis MacBook is the only one I have, so if possible I need this fixed.\nHow can I go about fixing this, or should I just give up?\n\nA: Considering the age of your MacBook (it's 12 or so years old), it's highly likely your hard drive has died. \nThere is also the possibility that something else could be wrong with your MacBook, so there is the risk that you'll end up spending money on a new hard drive only to find that you still run into problems.\nHowever, if this is a MacBook that you've been using without problems until now and it's your only option in terms of having a computer you can use, then replacing the hard drive on these is not hard to do. See this iFixit guide on the process involved to determine if you feel comfortable doing this.\nAs for the type of hard drive you'll need, your MacBook uses a Serial ATA (SATA) hard drive interface, so buying a hard drive that suits will be easy to do. Just make sure you remember to get an internal drive that is 2.5\" (not a 3.5\" drive designed for desktop computers).\nOnce you've replaced the drive you'll need to reinstall Snow Leopard (i.e. Mac OS X 10.6) from scratch (or reinstall from whatever discs came with your MacBook). Of course this requires that your optical drive is still working fine, so if it's not you'll need to look at other options such as using macOS Recovery.\n", "Q: Are email Attachments technically always inline, or does macOS Mail not allow conventional, non-inline attachments? In macOS mail, you are forced to attach files inline in the message. I am aware you can enable \"Always Insert Attachments at End of Message\" in the menubar's Edit menu, but I understand this still leaves the attachment inline. Even when an image or PDF is shown as an icon at the end of the message in macOS Mail, the recipient ends up seeing the attachment as a huge inline image.\nIs there an actual difference in \"inline\" vs. \"non-inline\" attachments in email protocol? Or do other apps technically attach things inline at the end, just visually showing it differently?\n\nA: There is a definition in the MIME specification for both inline and attachment files within email messages, but (from the Wiki page linked above):\n\nAs of 2010, a good majority of mail user agents do not follow this\n  prescription fully. Most users are unaware of how to set the\n  content-disposition to attachment. Many mail user agents also send\n  messages with the file name in the name parameter of the content-type\n  header instead of the filename parameter of the content-disposition\n  header.  This practice is discouraged.\n\nIn short, whether the sender and recipient follow the spec, or do things differently, is uncertain.\n", "Q: iPhone: Show clean Camera feed without any on-screen controls Is there a way to show a clean feed of the Camera on iPhone screen? For example, if I go to the Camera app, I can see the record button, as well as the other controls and options.\nI want to see nothing but what the Camera is seeing on the screen of my iPhone. Is this possible?\n\nA: After testing and searching paid and free apps for hours. I found a free app that does this, True Visage. Tested with iPhone 8, connected to my MacBook with USB-C cable and recording into Quicktime. It has a minimal interface that disappears after a few secs. Leaving beautiful, HQ, controls-free, watermark-free views of front or rear camera. Also has a handy flip function. Winner!\nThis allows me to use my iphone like an external web camera, connected via USB-C, which looks much better than the icam native to my MacBook Pro.\nNote: Notifications from other apps may still come on screen and show in the view. Disable notifications before going live.\n\nA: I was having this same issue and didn't find any free, easy solutions so I just created my own:\nhttps://github.com/alexfromapex/camera-viewer \n\nA: This is not possible with the built-in Camera app, or with any other built-in app.\nThe built-in Camera app doesn't provide options to completely hide the top toolbar and the controls shown at the bottom.\nSince this is technically feasible, you may search the App Store for any 3rd-party app(s) which offers the said functionality. For e.g., try searching for minimalistic Camera app on Web/App Store to look for relevant matches.\n\nA: There's a newer app called Camra that works better than the other options listed here. The HTML camera-viewer does not allow camera zoom. True Visage still has some controls, and they take time to disappear.\nCamra by contrast only shows controls when taking a photo, and they don't stay up for long. It's perfect if one wants to share an iPhone's video feed using Zoom's built-in feature to broadcast the phone's screen over a cable.\n\nA: Yes, here is my paid iOS app that does exactly that, it's called Clean Camera Feed.  I'm the creator of this app.\nI stream with OBS and found that using other apps available caused a bunch of latency issues and trying to use multiple devices would slow down OBS etc. So decided to write and publish my own app as a solution. \nIt displays a fullscreen camera view and you can use touch gestures to control the screen (tap to focus, double tap to switch cameras, pinch to zoom, etc.).\n\nA: Found an App that does exactly that. It's called Touch Camera. \n", "Q: Apple EarPods buzzing except when I'm touching the area around the MacBook Trackpad I've been using the Apple EarPods with my MacBook Air for a while now. Since recently, they have been producing a very faint buzzing in the left earbud when I'm not touching the computer.\nHowever, when I touch the areas around the keyboard, Trackpad, and screen bezel, the buzzing stops. But as soon as I take my hand off the aluminium unibody or the bezel, it starts buzzing again. Even if I touch the body very lightly, such as the very tip of my finger, it stops.\nThat being said, what's happening and how do I stop the buzzing in that ear altogether?\n\nA: It's likely that your MacBook isn't properly grounded. This probably explains the buzzing sound that you are hearing.\nWhen you are touching the aluminium surface of your MacBook, you are technically creating a way for the charge to move, technically providing the grounding, which explains why the buzzing stops.\nIt is recommended to use the adapter with a three pin extension cord. When using it, your MacBook gets grounded, preventing any change from staying and generating the buzzing sound.\n", "Q: How to do IP masquerading on MacOS (10.14+)? I am looking for the equivalent Macos command to the linux:\nsudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o en0 -j MASQUERADE\n\nI notice there are some very very old solutions using the ancient ipfw firewall, but pfctl has taken over and it has a completely different command system!\n\nA: I believe under pf you are required to edit the pf.conf file for NAT. The OpenBSD PF page has some more information on the syntax.\nMurus is a frontend for pf configuration if you're happy using a GUI rather than CLI.\nThe linux/unix or networking stack exchange sites might be helpful places to ask about pf if the OpenBSD page doesn't cover your question.\n", "Q: After Security Update 2019-003, OpenLDAP is corrupted.

What are my options? I am sure there are ways they can still access the data. Are there any data protection laws for replaced disks from Apple's Side?

I.e., are they bit-by-bit the same files that were initially added to the iTunes folder?\n\nA: When you subscribe to iTunes Match the individual files that you added to your iTunes library on your Mac are not uploaded to iCloud. Instead they are matched with the existing high quality music files made available by Apple.\nThese are then downloaded on any new device that you access your library from.\n", "Q: How to use Screen Sharing if I don't know the remote Mac's IP address I have the credentials for the Mac, but there is nobody in the room with the machine to check the public IP address.\n\nIf I know the public IP, I can connect to the mac. Unfortunately the ISP provides only dynamic IPs, so I guess it changed recently.\nIs there any other way to gain access? \n\nA: Ah! Yeah... your options at this point are limited. The ISP might help you as it's their DHCP that assigned the address; they'd be the only ones that would know that. \nThis has happened to me, and as my ISP is comcast, there is no help. \nIn the future :), what you need is \"Dynamic DNS\"; available free from several sources. I use FreeDNS. It's kind of funky, but seems to work reliably. \nThe other alternative (to dynamic DNS) is a \"roll your own\" approach that would require some script-writing on your part. If you're up for that, let me know & we'll go from there. \n\nA: On the remote computer, save this following AppleScript code in a new Script Editor.App document (Script Editor.App  is located here... /Applications/Utilities/Script Editor.app) as a \"Stay Open\" application.  Before saving this document as an application, make sure you enter your current external IP address and the email address in the first two lines of the code.\nTo summarize what the AppleScript code does is simply... Every 15 minutes it checks your current external IP address against the IP address you set in the first line of the code.  If those two IP addresses are not the same, the script will go ahead and send a new email (to the email address you set in the second line of the code) with the new updated external IP address.  \nThen just like opening any other application in Finder, double-clicking your newly created app will run the new app.  \nproperty ipAddress : \"123.456.7.89\" -- Insert Current External IP Address (Set Only Once)\n\nproperty toRecipient : \"whoever@gmail.com\" --Email To Get IP Has Changed Messages\n\non idle\n    set theIP to do shell script \"curl ifconfig.co\"\n\n    if theIP is not equal to ipAddress then\n        tell application \"Mail\"\n            set newEmail to (make new outgoing message)\n            set content of newEmail to theIP\n            set subject of newEmail to \"IP Address Has Changed\"\n            tell newEmail\n                make new to recipient with properties {address:toRecipient}\n                send\n            end tell\n        end tell\n        set ipAddress to theIP\n    end if\n\n    return (15 * minutes) -- Waits 15 min. to check IP again\nend idle\n\n\nDon't forget to add this new AppleScript application, in System Preferences, to the list of apps allowed to control your computer.\n\nUPDATE\nAlthough the above script seems to work, after several runs and minor changes to the code for testing purposes, I decided to create an alternate solution. Because of the new security settings in macOS Mojave and AppleScript's inability to reliably update and maintain its Global and Persistent property values across runs, I feel this alternate solution is much more reliable.\nStep 1:  On the remote computer, in Script Editor.app, save this AppleScript code as a .scpt file and name it \"Get Current External IP.scpt\"\nBe sure you change the value of property toRecipient to your email address\nproperty ipAddress : \"1.1.1.1\" -- Not Necessary To Set\nproperty toRecipient : \"YourEmail@gmail.com\" --Email To Get IP Has Changed Messages\n\nset emailIsRunning to application \"Mail\" is running -- Checks If Mail Is Running\n\ntry\n    set lastLoggedIP to readFile()\n    set theIP to do shell script \"curl ifconfig.co\"\n    if theIP is not equal to lastLoggedIP then\n        sendNewEmail()\n        writeToTheFile()\n    end if\non error errMsg number errNum\n    if errNum is -43 then -- The Error If File For readFile() Doesn't Exist Yet\n        set theIP to do shell script \"curl ifconfig.co\"\n        if theIP is not equal to ipAddress then\n            sendNewEmail()\n            writeToTheFile() -- Creates The \"/private/tmp/IP Logger.txt\" File\n        end if\n    else\n        activate\n        display dialog \"An error has occurred:\" & return & errMsg & \" \" & errNum giving up after 10\n    end if\nend try\n\ndelay 20 -- Allows For Completion Of Any Incoming Or Outgoing Mail Messages\nif not emailIsRunning then quit application \"Mail\" -- Quits Mail If Wasn't Already Running\n\nto sendNewEmail() -- Sends New Email Whenever IP Changes\n    set theIP to do shell script \"curl ifconfig.co\"\n    tell application \"Mail\"\n        set newEmail to (make new outgoing message)\n        set content of newEmail to theIP\n        set subject of newEmail to \"IP Address Has Changed\"\n        tell newEmail\n            make new to recipient with properties {address:toRecipient}\n            send\n        end tell\n    end tell\n    set ipAddress to theIP\nend sendNewEmail\n\non readFile() -- Reads IP Logger.txt To Check For IP Changes \n    set theFile1 to alias \"private:tmp:IP Logger.txt\"\n    set lastLoggedIP to last item of (read theFile1 as text using delimiter linefeed)\nend readFile\n\non writeToTheFile() -- Logs Every IP Change To File\n    set theIP to do shell script \"curl ifconfig.co\"\n    set theFile to \"/private/tmp/IP Logger.txt\"\n    set theText to theIP\n    try\n        set writeToFile to open for access theFile with write permission\n        write theText & linefeed to writeToFile as text starting at eof\n        close access theFile\n    on error errMsg number errNum\n        close access theFile\n        set writeToFile to open for access theFile with write permission\n        write theText & linefeed to writeToFile as text starting at eof\n        close access theFile\n    end try\nend writeToTheFile\n\nStep 2: On the remote computer, in Script Editor.app, save this following AppleScript code as a \"stay open\" application file.  I named it \"IP Changed Email Notify.app\".\nIf you did not save \"Get Current External IP.scpt\" to your Documents folder in Step 1 from above, then you must set its location in property currentExternalIP in the following code.\nproperty currentExternalIP : alias ((path to documents folder as text) & \"Get Current External IP.scpt\")\n\nrun script currentExternalIP\n\non idle\n    run script currentExternalIP\n    return (15 * minutes)\nend idle\n\nThe first time you run the new stay open AppleScript app (IP Changed Email Notify.app) from outside of Script Editor.app, you will be presented with this following dialog...\n\nJust click \"OK\" and since all of the work is actually being done by \"Get Current External IP.scpt\" there should be no more future dialogs or alerts to deal with.\nStep 3: (OPTIONAL) On the remote computer, add this newly created AppleScript application (IP Changed Email Notify.app) to your \"Login Items\" in the Users And Groups System Preferences panel. Now every time the computer restarts, IP Changed Email Notify.app will run automatically and any time the external IP address of that computer changes, you will get an email notification.\n\nA: The screen sharing service uses TCP port 5900. If indeed you have arranged so that you can connect to it if you only know the IP, that port should appear as open from outside.\nNow, if you know what dynamic IP address it had before it changed, you can check WHOIS database to see the whole IP range that address belongs in. Chances are good that the new IP would belong to the same range, though that will depend totally on how your ISP allocates the addresses.\nNow, after that, you could scan that whole subnet using e.g. nmap, looking for open port 5900. But before you do that, check on the legality of port scanning in whatever country you are currently in. In some countries it is legal if done without criminal intent, in other countries port scanning may be always illegal.\n\nA: If the person on the other Mac is signed in with their Apple ID, you can simply start a iMessage session, click on the Details button and click on the Screen Sharing icon to start a screen sharing session.\n\nYou can both ask them to share their screen or invite to share your screen. This approach works seemlessly without needing an explicit IP address.\nYou'll need someone to be present physically near the machine to approve the screen sharing request though.\n\nA: Probably not, especially if the Mac is behind a router, most of which block incoming connections.\nIn the future, I'd recommend using something like Screens or Jump Desktop which both have companion apps which will work around the various connection issues and allow you to connect remotely without needing to know the IP address.\n", "Q: How to restore MacBook Pro to factory settings?

It's loud and high pitched - it's about the same pitch as white noise.\nIt doesn't seem to be related with volume. It doesn't crackle when the volume gets louder, and the crackling isn't at all synced with any peaks of the sound (in which there are barely any, the sound quality otherwise is good). In fact, most of the crackling happens when the volume is quiet, and even when nothing is playing.\nI haven't dropped or damaged the MacBook in any way. What can I do to fix this, and if Apple Repair is necessary, how much would it cost?

What can I do to change the default player of screen captures on iPad?\n\nA: Currently there is no way to change the default app that opens a particular file type, hyperlink, etc. \nHowever, many 3rd party apps allow you to import and/or open photos, videos etc directly from their default locations without first having to transfer the files via iTunes or an online cloud service.\nWith regard to VLC, if you don't want to connect your iPad to iTunes, then your best bet is to go into the Photos app and save the videos to Files, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc. One saved, go into VLC and access the sidebar, tap on Cloud Services, and then select the appropriate option to access the video.\nFor example, to access a video capture on VLC, you could:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Photos\n\n*Tap the video\n\n*Tap on the Share icon and select Save to Files\n\n*Navigate to where within Files you want to save the video and proceed to save it\n\n*Open VLC\n\n*Access the sidebar\n\n*Tap on Cloud Services\n\n*In the next screen tap on Cloud Services again\n\n*Open the video capture\n\n\nA: That's more about how non-apple apps can access your private data (which by default are only accessible to built-in apps) - Check if there are any privacy/accessibility settings that needs extra user consent - either 'access to' and/or 'access from' - should be in the privacy tab - if you still can't share it directly you probably must use the [share/copy to/open with] button and dump it into vlc directly (which sucks, i know, i do the same each time shuffling ebooks formats from one app to another - apps data are kept seperatly and you cant diretly access them like on your local drive, icloud drive mitigates that partially so check if you can acccess those videos through icloud. \n", "Q: Vertical lines on the left side of iPhone 4s after it fell down.

If you're predominantly using shell commands, you may want to consider writing a shell script instead.\nI've employed a little of both because they each have their usefulness in this situation: the shell commands are necessary to retrieve the disk information via diskutil, since AppleScript has no inbuilt means of getting that information by itself; but then rather than mess around with grep, awk, or sed to pattern match text from the raw output, we can invoke the -plist option to return the output as XML-formatted property list data, which AppleScript can be very good at handling.\n1. Retrieving a list of local disks and volumes\nLocally attached disks and volumes have a blockdevice inode in the folder /dev, so getting a list of disks is pretty easy with AppleScript:\nuse application \"System Events\"\n\nproperty devices : a reference to files in folder \"/dev\"\nproperty disknodes : a reference to (devices whose name begins with \"disk\")\n\nset diskinfo to name of disknodes\n\nWith my USB drive attached, I get this list of inodes:\n    --> {\"disk0\", \"disk0s1\", \"disk0s2\", \"disk1\", \"disk1s1\", \n         \"disk1s2\", \"disk1s3\", \"disk1s4\", \"disk2\", \"disk2s1\"}\n\n2. Isolating the desired volumes\nTo filter the list so that we only run the appropriate utilities on the appropriate disks or volumes, diskutil now does its part.  We can create a shell process from inside AppleScript rather than doing it via Terminal.  The relevant shell command is this:\ndiskutil info -plist <disk|volume>\n\nTo execute this from AppleScript, use the do shell script command:\ndo shell script \"diskutil info -plist\" & id\n\nwhere id is the name of a disk retrieved from earlier and stored in diskinfo.  You can't pass in the entire list all at once, so we have to iterate through the list and run the command once for each item:\nuse scripting additions\n\ndelete every property list item\nrepeat with id in diskinfo\n    set shellcmd to \"diskutil info -plist \" & id\n    set plist to do shell script shellcmd\n\nWith the property list data returned by diskutil, AppleScript can turn it into a property list object.  The property list data returned by invoking diskutil info is all contained within a single level, so there's no hierarchy to traverse.  The great thing with property list objects is that AppleScript can transform them into a record, which then becomes really easy to retrieve values:\n    make property list item with properties {name:id, text:plist}\n    tell the value of property list item id as record to if ¬\n        (its |Ejectable|) and (not its WholeDisk) and ¬\n        (its MountPoint = \"\") then set the contents of id ¬\n        to its {disk:ParentWholeDisk, volume:DeviceIdentifier}\nend repeat\n\nIn a single line, AppleScript has read the property list data, and discarded any disk that is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not ejectable;\n\n*Is a \"whole\" disk (i.e. not a mountable volume);\n\n*Has an identifiable mount point on the system.\n\n\nIt also bins all the useless data we don't need, and returns only the name of the partition and its parent disk.  These will only be ejectable disks (so not the recovery and boot disks, and not your computer's hard disk), and will be mountable volumes that are not currently mounted.  For me, and my single USB drive, which I unmounted first, I got this record list back:\nset unmounted to records of diskinfo\n    --> {{disk:\"disk2\", volume:\"disk2s1\"}}\n\n3. Mounting and ejecting each volume\nThe parsing of the data is now done, so now you can run diskutil operations on the appropriate disks.  You have the choice of either mounting individual volumes, or mounting an entire disk (which will mount all of its volumes).  The method is the same for each: iterate through our record list stored in the variable unmounted and use either the disk or the volume from each item as an argument for the appropriate shell command:\ndiskutil mount <volume>\ndiskutil mountDisk <disk>\ndiskutil eject <disk>\n\nThe AppleScript loop looks like this:\nrepeat with diskitem in unmounted\n    set shellcmd to \"diskutil mount \" & diskitem's volume\n    try\n        do shell script shellcmd\n    on error\n        set shellcmd to \"diskutil eject \" & diskitem's disk\n        try\n            do shell script shellcmd\n        end try\n    end try\nend repeat\n\ndo shell script returns on success the output to stdout.  After successfully mounting my disk, the messages pane in Script Editor contained:\n\"Volume USB on disk2s1 mounted\"\n\nI haven't instigated a situation that forces my drive not to mount, but typically, upon failure of any shell command (that is, whenever a shell command returns a non-zero status), do shell script throws an error.  This will be caught by the try block, which will redirect the script to execute another shell command responsible for ejecting the drive.  This is also in its own try block in case it, too, returns a non-zero status, in which case the script will continue onto the next volume.\nBelow is the final script with some additional modifications.  The script will return the original unmounted record list with extra information appended to each disk item reporting the outcome of the attempt to mount and/or eject the volume.  A complete failure will simply be reported with false.  So my final script result looked like this:\n--> {{disk:\"disk2\", volume:\"disk2s1\", result:\"Volume USB on disk2s1 mounted\"}}\n\n\nThe final script\nuse application \"System Events\"\n\nproperty devices : a reference to files in folder \"/dev\"\nproperty disknodes : a reference to (devices whose name begins with \"disk\")\n\nset diskinfo to name of disknodes\n\nuse scripting additions\n\ndelete every property list item\nrepeat with id in diskinfo\n    set shellcmd to \"diskutil info -plist \" & id\n    set plist to do shell script shellcmd\n    make property list item with properties {name:id, text:plist}\n    tell the value of property list item id as record ¬\n        to if (its |Ejectable|) ¬\n        and (not its WholeDisk) ¬\n        and (its MountPoint = \"\") then set ¬\n        id's contents to {disk:its ParentWholeDisk ¬\n        , volume:its DeviceIdentifier ¬\n        , result:missing value}\nend repeat\n\nset unmounted to records of diskinfo\n\nrepeat with diskitem in unmounted\n    set shellcmd to \"diskutil mount \" & diskitem's volume\n    try\n        do shell script shellcmd\n        set diskitem's result to the result\n    on error\n        set shellcmd to \"diskutil eject \" & diskitem's disk\n        try\n            do shell script shellcmd\n            set diskitem's result to the result\n        on error E\n            set disk item's result to E\n        end try\n    end try\nend repeat\n\nreturn unmounted\n\n", "Q: AppleScript : separating number from text in variable I have a script which calculate the timeframe between date and return the result in days or month or years.\nFor exemple, given myResult = \"6 Days\"\nHow can I separate the number from the text ?\nI managed to get the number only using this :\nset myResultNumberOnly to number of myResult\n\nbut I can't manage to do the same from the text :\nset myResultTextOnly to text of myResult\n\nI also tried \nset myResultTextOnly to word of myResult\n\nMaybe I can go with text delimiting?\nI can't tell the length of the number using this :\nset theLength to (get length of (myResultTextNumberOnly as text))\n\nOr should I go with if statement?\nHow would be the best way to do it?\nUPDATE \nI just realised that set myResultNumberOnly to number of MyResult  give a wrong number, I don't really understand why ?\nset MyResult to \"Account Value:$478.01\"\nset myResultNumberOnly to number of MyResult\n\n\nResult: 21\n\n\nA: number of MyResult obtains the length of a string.  \"6 days\" just happens to be 6 characters long, whereas \"Account Value:$478.01\" is 21 characters long.\nThe most straightforward method to extract numbers from a string would be to split the string into words, then test each item of the list individually to see whether it can be coerced into a number:\nset MyResult to \"Account Value:$478.01\"\nset MyResultWords to words of MyResult\n\nrepeat with w in MyResultWords\n    set w's contents to coerceToNumber(w's contents)\nend repeat\n\nset MyResultNumbers to every number in MyResultWords\n\n\nto coerceToNumber(x)\n    local x\n\n    try\n        x as number\n    on error\n        x\n    end try\nend coerceToNumber\n\nThis won't handle string representations of numbers in scientific notation, e.g. 1.234E+09, as the method AppleScript uses to delimit its words results in {\"1.234E\", \"+\", \"09\"}.  In this case, you can set text item delimiters to space, and perform the same operation on the text items of My Result.\n\nI have a script which calculate the timeframe between date and return the result in days or month or years.\n\nI do question, however, why your script is producing a result that is a string value of \"6 days\".  It makes me believe the script you are using to calculate time intervals between dates is not doing it in as an amenable way as it could.  Partly, this depends on the input your script receives, but in many cases, you should consider converting the input into AppleScript date objects, which then allows you to calculate differences easily and returns to you an actual number that you can manipulate to acquire a measure in days, minutes, hours, etc.\nThe example script below assumes an ISO 8601-formatted date string as input, i.e. \"yyyy-mm-dd\", although you could adapt the script to cater for other input formats:\n# The units parameter is optional, and defaults to measurements in seconds.\n# To choose a different unit, pass one of the constants 'hours', 'days',\n# 'minutes', or 'weeks' (without quotes).\non timeInterval from startDate to endDate by units : 1\n    tell (current date) to set [startDate, ¬\n        day, [year, its month, day]] to ¬\n        [it, 1, words of startDate]\n\n    tell (current date) to set [endDate, ¬\n        day, [year, its month, day]] to ¬\n        [it, 1, words of endDate]\n\n    (endDate - startDate) / units\nend timeInterval\n\ntimeInterval from \"2012-06-03\" to \"2019-04-01\" by days    --> 2493.0\ntimeInterval from \"2012-06-03\" to \"2019-04-01\" by weeks   --> 356.142857142857\ntimeInterval from \"2019-03-31\" to \"2019-04-01\" by hours   --> 24.0\ntimeInterval from \"2019-03-31\" to \"2019-04-01\" by minutes --> 1440.0\ntimeInterval from \"2019-03-31\" to \"2019-04-01\"            --> 8.6E+4 [ = 86400 ]\n\n", "Q: Google Chrome for macOS: How to bypass \"This type of file may harm your computer\" and save file automatically Every time I download a .DMG file using Google Chrome, I have to open the Downloads tab and manually keep it which is super annoying.

I've got a Python project which uses a virtual environment. In my project folder, there is a bin/ folder which contains all the executables needed by the project. To use these, you run source bin/activate to insert the path to that bin/ directory to your PATH variable.\nNow, most of the time this works as I'd expect.

(For example, oftentimes some of my keyboard shortcuts for switching spaces stop working and the only way to fix it is to restart the Dock.)\nHowever, sometimes when I kill the Dock it will fail to automatically relaunch, leaving my system in an unusable state. Aside from something like rebooting or logging out of my user account and logging back in again, is there anyway I can force the Dock process to launch again?\n\nA: I have finally found the answer to this question. If the Dock fails to relaunch, execute the following shell commands:\nlaunchctl stop com.apple.Dock.agent\nlaunchctl start com.apple.Dock.agent\n\nThe second command may not be necessary but should probably be included anyway just to be safe. This is probably a much safer way to restart the Dock than simply killing it.\n\nA: If the following doesn't work after clicking menu \"Go->Utilities->Terminal\" (which you must have done to access \"kill\"), and it does not automatically restart following, \nkillall Dock\n\nI would then download Onyx, a highly regarded app not on the AppStore, which a lot Mac users know about, and use the \"Parameters menu\" and therefore click \"Dock\" menu and hit the button \"restore the Dock\" at the bottom of the page. I took a picture if you want it uploading. Just to note, this an attempt at a more permanent fix and will trigger a restart. There are other approaches in Onyx that may help, notably clicking the \"rebuilding LaunchServices\", in the Maintenance menu. \nEither Onyx approach might help remove the underlying bug. \nIf you are running Sierra, this appears to be a known bug and the following article may be of help, here\n\nA: The Dock.app can be found at /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app so you can re-launch it by using the Finder's \"GO\" menu to \"Go To Folder…\" and put in /System/Library/CoreServices. Then double-click the Dock.app like any other app.\nOr go to Terminal.app and enter:\nopen -a Dock\nEither of those should re-start the Dock. However, if it didn't restart on its own, it might not work to re-start it manually, and you have reboot/logout&login, but at least you'll know what to try.\n", "Q: Mac OS Sierra Feedback app came out of nowhere So I was just using my mac normally until I looked at the dock and saw a feedback app (which I didn't open). I thought it was from google due to the material icon design but I cannot find a source that says it is.\nI looked at the launchpad and saw the same feedback app.\nI wanna know wether this is some sort of malicious app or it's nothing to worry about at all. One thing for sure is that it came out of nowhere.\nEdit : Forgot to tell you that the file does not show up in the applications folder (even with showing hidden files on) neither does anything happen when I launch it.\n\n\nA: Yes, this is a malicious app.  Try downloading Malwarebytes from online to remove it.  Or search for \"feedback\" in finder to try and locate the app.  \n\nA: It's located in ~/Applications/Chrome Apps.localized/Feedback.app, Delete it if you want.\n", "Q: Download app bundles from App Store to run on iOS Emulator on Mac I want to run an iOS app (eWeLink) using the Appetize service, which I believe is an emulator. My goal is to be able to control my light switches from my Mac using the eWeLink app. In order to do that, I have to get the app as a a .zip or .tar.gz file containing the compressed .app bundle. How do I get that .app bundle?\nWhen I go to App Store, it just wants to download directly to my iPhone. The app is available, but I want the bundle.\n\nA: There's multiple points to address here:\n1) The Appetize service is not an emulator. It allows you to run native mobile apps in the browser in order to provide apps demos, training, testing, etc. However it does so not by emulating the ARM CPU of an iOS device, but instead works by running the Intel version of said apps natively on an Intel CPU - while providing a \"simulated\" operating system that maps onto the browser.\n2) The app bundle you need for the Appetize service is usually obtained by building the app for the Xcode Simulator. This requires you to have the source code for the app. If the app you want to run on the Appetize service is not open source, and you have not developed it yourself (or otherwise obtained the rights for the source code) - you cannot use this method.\n3) The apps you download from the App Store are meant for execution on ARM CPUs. They cannot be directly used with the Appetize service, as that requires Intel executables. However, if you do want to obtain the files, it is possible (contrary to the other answers to your question). The easiest way of doing this is to use iTunes to access the App Store and download the apps, which are then accesssible on your local disk drive. This requires you to use either iTunes 12.6.3 (or older) or one of the other solutions described here:\nHow do I download an iOS App (IPA) file to my Mac after iTunes 12.7 update?\n4) Very recent development has shown that it is indeed in some cases possible to translate an app built for the ARM CPU for the App Store into an app built for the Intel CPU meant for the Xcode Simulator (or the Appetize service). This is done by exploiting the fact that Apple these days requires app submissions to include bitcode. You can read more about that here:\nhttps://www.highcaffeinecontent.com/blog/20190518-Translating-an-ARM-iOS-App-to-Intel-macOS-Using-Bitcode\n5) The most practical way of achieving your goal of running the eWeLink app on your Mac in order to control light switches is to run the Android version of the app through an Android environment for the Mac, such as for example BlueStacks.\n\nA: I am software developer and develop apps for iOS.\n\nI want to run an iOS app on an emulator on my Mac\n\nThere is no iOS emulator in existence. There's an iOS simulator, available only for macOS.\n\nIn order to do that, I have to get the app as a a .zip or .tar.gz file containing the compressed .app bundle. How do I get that .app bundle?\n\nThere is no way to get an iOS .app bundle. iOS apps can (generally) be installed only on your iPhone, available only from the App Store app pre-installed on your iPhone.\n\nWhen I go to App Store, it just wants to download directly to my iPhone. The app is available, but I want the bundle.\n\nThe only way you can run an app available on the App Store is on an iOS device.\nThe iOS Simulator is available along-with Xcode (developer tool to develop apps for various Apple hardware devices). You can build and run an app in iOS simulator only if you have access to the source code for the app (generally personal or open-source projects).\nIt is not possible to obtain code/app bundle for an arbitrary app available on the App Store and run it on iOS simulator.\n\nA: Note, I'm not a developer. That said I believe that the only way you are going to run anything in the Xcode Simulator is if it belongs to you.\nThe way I understand it the Simulator is not a VM (like Virtualbox, Parallels or VMWare) to run any iOS app on your Mac. Rather it is a troubleshooting/development tool to allow you to work on software that you wrote yourself before you install it on your iOS device of choice.\n\nA: Not possible.\nAppetize.io is not an emulator. It is a service which provides an interactive video stream of iOS Simulator running on a macOS system. iOS Simulator is a part of the Xcode development tools, and can be downloaded for free to run on any macOS system.\nThe iOS Simulator is also not an emulator. It is an application which runs on macOS and runs iOS application bundles which have been compiled by a developer to run under the Simulator environment. These application bundles contain x86 code, instead of the ARM code that is typical for an iOS application. iOS applications downloaded from the App Store do not contain x86 code, so they cannot be run under the Simulator.\n", "Q: Does the H1 chip (in Airpods 2 and PBP) support streaming from one device to two sets of earphones?

I have a Mac Pro \"Eight Core\" 2.26 (2009/Nehalem) that I was running with dual X5690 (3.46GHz/6-core/12MB/130W) processors for the last couple years (yes, I've got the 2010 firmware hack on it).  Been running fantastic, but I needed to do swap some hardware around and so ended up needing to take these processors out and put some older processors (that were from another actual 2010 Mac Pro; 2.66 GHz 6 Core Xeon X5650 x2).\nAfter the transplant was completed I fired it up and immediately got a light on the right side of CPUA:\n\nI held the power button in and immediately turned it off.  This light then lit (\"OVTMP CPUA\"):\n\nI figured something must be up with the heatsink as it seemed as though the screws for the 2009 heatsinks ratcheted down tightly and immediately instead of having some give that would indicate that it was in contact with the CPU (lidded CPU btw).  Made me figure that perhaps the heatsink was not pressing down the CPUA processor enough.  I also recalled that the previous processor that was in here may have been SLIGHTLY taller.\nI then took the heatsink back off and put about .5 to .75 mm of copper cut to size for the Xeon lid and used thermal paste again to make up for this possible spacing issue. I repeated this for CPUB. The heatsink seemed to ratchet down better this time as I could feel some pressure being applied and the torque didn't stop immediately as before and thus i could torque it down a bit.\nAfter doing this, I unfortunately found that the same error lights were emitted - no change.\nI also went ahead got some additional feedback from the DIAG LED button:\n\nI'm not really sure what to do at this point.  Should I add thicker copper to make the heatsinks apply greater pressure to these Xeon processors?  \nI believe Intel has pretty good heat protection for these processors, so I don't believe the processor would be \"burned out\" at this point, right?\nFurther, would resetting the motherboard by removing the battery and / or pressing the reset button beside the battery (above the 1st PCIe slot / behind the GPU) help at all?\nAny other ideas aside from buying a new processor?\n", "Q: Can't resize partition My Disk Utility is showing me some Weird Stuff.\nMy current startup partition is showing as 155 GB, with (I was shocked to discover) 344 GB of unpartitioned free space:\n\nI can try to resize the first partition by removing the \"Free space\" section, then hit \"Apply\", but then I get this error:\n\nActually, if I try this a few times, I get variously different errors.

Do those emails all live on corporate servers, so that no message is being saved locally?\n\nA: With Microsoft Exchange server all information is stored on the server itself, the only thing that is stored on your iOS device are the message headers and a few of the most recent messages that you have recently read.\nOnce you delete an email account (of any kind) from the iPhone the message headers and messages stored there are deleted.

But of course if you don't mind a huge dump to your terminal, simply remove that option from the command line. Based on a previous answer here at \"AskDifferent\" the period of time that your logs will cover is apparently a function of some settings in the /etc/asl.conf file. That answer has a method to check & adjust those settings. However, in looking at my own asl.conf file, it differs some from the settings in the referenced answer (e.g. there is no ttl limit in my asl.conf). And so, you may not know how far back you can go until you actually try. If the entire period of interest isn't in the logs, I don't have any ideas, except to increase the log limits in asl.conf to avoid that issue in the future, or perhaps set up log rotation.  \nA couple of other points: \n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't use sudo, you may get the following odd error message: \n\n\n\nlog: Could not open local log store: The log archive format is corrupt and cannot be read  \n\nThat message is likely false and misleading; use sudo, and it should disappear (unless your logs truly are corrupted!). \n\n\n*If you want to save the log output to a file, that's easy enough: \n\n\n$ sudo log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains \"Clamshell change detected\"' --last 24h >> ~/MyClamshellClosures.txt \n\n\n\n*And finally, if you want to see log entries for a range of dates, e.g. YTD: \n\n\n$ sudo log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains \"Clamshell change detected\"' --start \"2019-01-01\" --end \"2019-05-19\" >> ~/MyClamshellClosures.txt \n\nALTERNATIVELY:\nIf you don't wish to use the command line, the Console app in Launchpad, Other may also be used.

I keep getting a warning message that terminal would like to administer my computer whenever I run standard commands, such as editing crontab in Vim. This never used to happen on my old Macbook. How do I turn off this feature?\n\nA: You need to give Terminal 'Full Disk Access\" in System Preferences > Security & Privacy.\nChoose Full Disk Access in the sidebar, and then unlock the padlock and enter an admin password. Then click the + button and add the Terminal application.\n\nA: Please also see Reset All Mojave App Permissions\nThese are new(ish) security features that have been gradually introduced in recent macOS versions.  Apple noticeable ramped up these security controls with the release of mojave.\nThe system noticed that Terminal was being used to access files that aren't normally edited by end users.  (Were you attempting to edit the crontab for the root user? ... i.e. sudo crontab -e?  \nThe command line utility that can control this is tccutil.\nTo reset warnings associated with the Terminal app, you can use tccutil reset All com.apple.Terminal.

It would be nice to do it from Terminal as well.\n\nA: This can be done using a macOS default built-in, from either the command line or its GUI app the action belongs to.\nTo do as you requested from the command line, in Terminal, use the following command example:\n\"/System/Library/Automator/Combine PDF Pages.action/Contents/Resources/join.py\" --shuffle -o /path/to/collated.pdf /path/to/file1.pdf /path/to/file2.pdf /path/to/file3.pdf /path/to/file4.pdf\n\nTo make the macOS built-in join.py script easier to use from the command line, I'd suggest you make a symbolic link for it. As an example, if you have /usr/local/bin in your PATH:\nsudo ln -s \"/System/Library/Automator/Combine PDF Pages.action/Contents/Resources/join.py\" \"/usr/local/bin/pdfjoin\"\n\nAfterwards, you can start the command with just pdfjoin instead of using its fully qualified pathname.\n\nBelow is a image of an Automator workflow to show an example of how it can be achieved using a macOS default built-in GUI app. Note that it can be modified many different ways to suit one's needs/wants.\n\nNote: The Combine PDF Pages action, when used in Automator creates a temp file and why additional actions are needed to refine the workflow. You could just use the Open Finder Items action directly after and forgo the other actions, but of course you'll need to then manually save the opened new pdf file elsewhere.\n\nA: I do this in preview:\nOpen the first one,\nSelect the others,\nWith the sidebar « thumbnails » visible, just drag and drop into the sidebar.\nCheck order but usually they go in by name order...\nHow I create my exams...\nEach one is one page, created in excel with headers and page numbers exported as pdf...\n", "Q: Why have symbolic links between files in folders at same depth? I noticed that in macOS, the /usr/local/Cellar folder contains binaries installed using Homebrew, and that /usr/local/opt has symbolic links to a bunch of those binaries. I haven't used symbolic links much, but as I understand it, the purpose of them is to create a link in a convenient location to a file/folder that acts as a copy of that file/folder, without having to move that file/folder from its original location.\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Am I correct in my understanding of symbolic links there?\n\n*If so, why would you create symbolic links in one folder (/usr/local/opt) to binaries in another folder (/usr/local/Cellar) that is at a similar location/depth in the file structure? Under what circumstances would you use these symbolic links where you couldn't just use the binaries?\n\nA: \nAm I correct in my understanding of symbolic links there?\n\nYes. Symbolic link, as the name implies acts as a link to a file/folder located elsewhere. Accessing the link is generally equivalent to accessing the file/folder.\n\nIf so, why would you create symbolic links in one folder (/usr/local/opt) to binaries in another folder (/usr/local/Cellar) that is at a similar location/depth in the file structure?\n\nIf you'll carefully observer in this particular case, the binaries corresponding to all the various installed formulae are in different folders. There's a separate folder corresponding to each installed formula under /usr/local/Cellar. Within the folder for formula is a folder containing version number, followed by installed files for the formula.\nVia symlink under /usr/local/opt, the installation location for all the formula are brought in one place.\nFor knowing the exact purpose of why /usr/local/opt folder is created by Homebrew, you can refer to this post on Stack Overflow:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35337601/why-is-there-a-usr-local-opt-directory-created-by-homebrew-and-should-i-use-it\n\nA: I’m not that familiar with Homebrew, but the pattern you are describing is one I’ve seen other software installers use: it makes various binaries available under one directory, while making it easy to tell what software package they come from. The screenshot below is from an article about Homebrew, and shows a listing of the directory “/usr/local/opt”, with the various symbolic links pointing to subdirectories of “/usr/local/Cellar”. While most of the binaries point to a package with the same name, this is for example not the case for “npm”, where the symbolic link makes it easy to tell that it is part of the same package as “node” and “nodejs”. Symbolic links are used here for filesystem organization purposes: all of the files of a package are kept together in one place, while making them available from other directories as needed.\n\nYou may also be interested in an example of how symbolic links are sometimes used without even pointing to a different directory at all. Take a look at the output of ls -l /usr/bin | grep vim, which should show various links pointing to “vim” in the same directory, for example “ex” and “view”. As the man page for “vim” explains:\n       Vim behaves differently, depending on the name of the command (the exe-\n       cutable may still be the same file).\n\n       vim       The \"normal\" way, everything is default.\n\n       ex        Start in Ex mode.  Go to Normal mode with the \":vi\"  command.\n                 Can also be done with the \"-e\" argument.\n\n       view      Start  in read-only mode.  You will be protected from writing\n                 the files.  Can also be done with the \"-R\" argument.\n\n\nA: The most common reason is \"canonical-ize\" the original file/binary. This could mean placing binaries in a canonical location — in this case, symlinks are placed in /usr/local/opt because your computer expects to find binaries there but not necessarily in /usr/local/Cellar (likely based on your shell $PATH variable). It could also be used to designate a single binary in a group of related binaries as \"official\" while keeping the other related binaries around but not immediately available — for instance, you might have installed many packages, each relying on a different version of Python, while you have specifically installed the latest version of Python for yourself. In this case, you might have binaries python34, python35, python36 etc in your Cellar folder, and a python binary in /usr/local/opt that links to the Python binary you requested be installed, python36.\n", "Q: How to determine which keyboard shortcut combo is free to assign? I've already spent much more time in finding a combination that works in every app (universal) than in creating the actual service. The shortcut triggers a service for increasing or decreasing the brightness of my external monitor.\nI tried a ridiculous Control + Alt + Command + F1 / F2, but it doesn't work in apps like Finder, Preview etc. It only gives an error beep. (But is it already assigned? Or its portion is assigned and gets triggered?) I haven't found anything else since.\nHow do I find a free keyboard shortcut combo? Otherwise there's no point in creating them.\n\nA: As @Tetsujin pointed out, \n\nThe beep doesn't mean 'oops, I've got a key conflict' it means 'the key command you just used has nothing assigned to it in this scope'.\n\nAfter a restart, the (above) shortcuts worked in every app I tried. \nSo after tuning your keyboard shortcuts, try to close and reopen the app in which it does not get triggered (beeps) or ultimately, reboot.\nAlso - there's no notification if you have an existing short cut and install an app that collides with that, so you may have to just remediate when an app or shortcut collide - defining another shortcut in that app to free your preferred use.\n", "Q: Any chance to survive after \"Apple Developer Program membership will be terminated\" message?

This is correct.\nHow could the keychain possibly be referencing this ancient device?\nI had recently checked the KeyChain item in the list visible in the screenshot -- as I noticed it was unchecked. I figured it would be a good idea to have the keychain shared between the iPhone and MacBook so passwords could transfer easily between them.\nSo it might be possible that the last time I use iCloud keychain was for this old iMac.\n\nA: This request comes because you have enabled Keychain for the first time with that account on this device. In order to get a copy of the current Keychain stored in the cloud, you need to authenticate yourself as the \"owner\" of that Keychain.\nSo in order to unlock the contents of your old Keychain, you need to verify that you're the same person that once uploaded that Keychain, by entering the unlock password you used on that old computer.\nThere's really nothing bizarre about it, nor it is any sign of a problem.

The questions might sound silly at first sight, but let me share my observations so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm in the U.S. right now where I use the charger I got from IT and I see that my MPB charges slowly. It says the battery is 51% full and will take another ~16 hours to fully charge\n\n*In my workplace I experience that too the charging stops around 80% and does not matter which plug I use\n\n*In the hotel with the same charger the same MBP charges two-three times faster and does not stop at 80%\n\n*home, which is Hungary with 240V electricity grid, reaching the fully charged state takes 2-3 hours (does not matter if I recompile my app in every other minute) and never stops at 80%)\n\n*I brought the charger came with MBP and the phenomenon is the same\n\n\nSince I'm not an electricity engineer I don't know whether voltage matters in charging or not. In the U.S. there is 120v, but in EU we use 240V. Differences in Amper, I'm not aware of. In the EU, we use 20A or more fuses.\nIs it possible the difference I experience is due to something default Apple magic in MBP?\n\nA: There's no \"magic\" involved in charging.\nThe standard Apple charger delivers the same voltage and amps to the laptop when used on a 120V grid as when used on a 230V grid. So the type of grid should not matter. \n20A fuses are definitely not common in all of the EU, it is much more common to have 10A fuses for lights and other outlets in normal homes, and 16A or more for kitchen appliances, etc. However, this doesn't really make any difference for charging a laptop. Even 10 amps at 120 volts is 1200 watts - which is way more than what is needed to charge any Apple laptop, as Apple's largest laptop charger is a 87 watt charger.\nThere's also no geographical components to charging. It is not so that the Apple charger knows that it is in Hungary and charges quickly, and knows that it is in the US and charges slowly. There's no such provision in any of Apple's chargers.\nThe most likely cause of your problem is that you're simply not using Apple chargers or not using the correct Apple charger. When you're in the US, you might be using a less-than-recommmended watts charger - or a knock-off charger. This would explain why it charges slowly.\n", "Q: In Finder, first tag vanishes while adding a second tag \n*\n\n*MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2011)\n\n*macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 (17G7024)\n\n\nThis is a problem I've been having since Mavericks first came out, and it has persisted through at least two complete OS reinstalls (though always on the same hardware).\nSuppose I open a PDF in Preview.

You'll then enter the public IP address when running scp on your Mac.\nHowever a perhaps more \"user friendly\" option is to use a service such as for example Dropbox. If you install that on both your Linux computer and Mac, you can send files back and forth that way without worrying about NAT.\nAnother option is to use VPN-software to connect both your Linux and Mac to the same virtual network. Then you can use scp as you're already using on the local network to copy files.\n", "Q: Invite to share screen (iMessage) - Automation - How? How can i automate an \"Invite to share screen\" from iMessages. \nI share screens a lot with my colleagues and it would just make sense to have an option to quick ask someone to view my screen. Yet now, i have to look the user up in the imessage window and \"target practice\" the small icon, then Invite ..\nWould be easier if i could automate it, or somehow create a desktop shortcut. \n\nA: You asked for an automative method to do this from within the Messages app, which this AppleScript can achieve.  You can place it in a Run AppleScript action.\nuse application \"System Events\"\n\nproperty process : a reference to process \"Messages\"\nproperty menu bar : a reference to menu bar 1 of my process\nproperty menu bar item : a reference to menu bar item \"Buddies\" of my menu bar\nproperty menu : a reference to menu 1 of my menu bar item\n\nactivate application \"Messages\"\n\nset _M to a reference to (menu item \"Invite to Share My Screen\" in my menu)\ntell _M to if not ((exists) and its enabled) then return false\n\nclick _M\n\nHowever, it seems to me that, however this script is triggered, whether via an Automator service, Keyboard Maestro, the Scripts menu, or whatever; it will either require at least a couple of mouse clicks (e.g. to active a service from the context menu), or a keypress.\nTherefore, in my mind, the easiest way to achieve the same outcome would be to set a keyboard shortcut for the appropriate menu item in Messages:\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts in macOS High Sierra: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shorcuts\nThis screenshot is from High Sierra, so if you're running Mojave, it may be a little different.  The important things are to check the name of the relevant menu item in Messages in case it varies from High Sierra or you use a different language on your system; and to ensure that the entry you type for your App Shortcut is identical, including capitals and non-capitals used: so \"Invite to Share My Screen\" is not the same as \"Invite To Share My Screen\" and only the first one would work.\n\n\nADDENDUM: (added 12 hours after original answer)\n@user3439894 kindly reminded me that my style of scripting can sometimes appear a little obtuse and more difficult to follow and understand to novice scripters.  Therefore, I am posting a version of the above code that this user recommended.  Functionally, it does exactly the same as the original (apart from activating Messages, which doesn't need to be done if the application is already active and being used).

Somewhere on SO in a older post the suggestion was done if there are any 'strange' characters that might cause the error. Verified it and the only strange one is '@'. However that is Brew's out of the box installation.\n\nA: You're trying to use the PHP module from HomeBrew with the Apple-provided Apache web server. That is an unsupported configuration on Mojave.\nIt doesn't work because macOS tries to validate that your software is correctly signed (i.e. not tampered with) - and it fails this check after you have changed which binaries are going to be loaded in. You can fix this by disabling SIP (System Integrity Protection) - but that is a really bad idea, as this would disable the protection on your other programs as well.\nThe correct way to proceed is to stop using the built-in Apache web server, and instead use a different web server. The easiest transition is to simple use Apache provided by HomeBrew instead.\nYou can do that by first installing Apache from HomeBrew:\nbrew install httpd\n\nThen stop macOS from starting up the Apple-provided Apache on boot:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist\n\nMake sure that the new php module line you have inserted is now not commented, and the old is - i.e. make it look like this:\n#LoadModule php7_module libexec/apache2/libphp7.so\nLoadModule php7_module /usr/local/opt/php@7.2/lib/httpd/modules/libphp7.so\n\nThen start up the new Apache web server installation:\nbrew services restart httpd\n\nDepending on your settings you will then be able to connect with your browser to localhost:80 or localhost:8080 to view your site.\n", "Q: Cannot Open .Sparsebundle My computer crashed few days ago, I took it to computer store and they told me that the logic board is damaged but the hard drive is fine.

Do you have any other Apple devices in the vicinity? There's not a lot of documentation on how it works exactly, but others have experienced similar.\nhttps://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/random-wake-up-after-mojave-heres-the-fix.262507/\nSo maybe try:\npmset -a proximitywake 0\nIf that doesn't work, maybe do what I do, which is set a very low autopoweroffdelay. That is, I just have my machine power off cleanly if its closed for more than an hour. Saves energy, and a regular reboot shouldn't hurt, either.\n\nA: I'm sorry I can't give any answers directly related to your log.\nHowever, I had similar problems like Macbook not waking up when I open it (Had to force reboot via power button), not successfully getting into sleep mode when I press sleep touchbar shortcut (Screen is blank but touchbar is still lit - also had to force reboot).\nIn my case I did these two basic first aid steps and it worked out for my cases.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset PRAM. (Guide from Apple)\n\n*Repair Boot partition. (Guide from Apple)\nWell, I hope these two steps that require not too much time solve your problem, but if not, I think you should reinstall OSX. Pretty bad news, but at least good part is unlike Windows ~7 reinstall, OSX Reinstall does not purge userdata(for example, documents, desktop folder, etc) unless you manually reformat your starting disk.\n\nA: I am having the same issue with the exact same log on Mac OS Catalina. The culprit here is handoff which keeps the Mac from sleeping. \nAs of now, the only solution I found was to turn off handoff under\n‘System Preferences - General - uncheck Allow handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices.’\nIt is not a permanent solution but will conserve battery until we get a more permanent solution. \n\nA: Well, it seems like you don’t fully shut down your MacBook ever. I would guess that some applications can wake up your MacBook; based on the log, it looks like something called dark wake is enabled. And on top of that, something that pops up in later lines (usually the third and fourth) is something with com.apple.. Try killing all the apps you’re not using with Command + Q (such as notes, anything using private-key, or anything else that’s in your log) and then putting it to sleep (without Caffeine, of course).\n\nA: Couple of things to try:\nOpen up activity monitor, set to view all processes, in the list of processes right click on the header and turn on preventing sleep. This may highlight something new.\nHave you tried shutting down the sharingd and useractivityd daemons?\n\nA: If you have this:\n\nPreventUserIdleSystemSleep named: \"Handoff\"\n\nTurning Bluetooth off when you don't use it (if you don't actively use it) is a solution\nYou'd expect excellence from a 2 trillion dollar company, but their products/os's are quite lacking when you just scratch the surface :(\n", "Q: Retrieve network password (network share) from keychain in terminal How can I retrieve my NAS password from Keychain using the terminal?

Both external monitors (same brand and same resolution) are connected via HDMI cables that attach to Thunderbolt/USB-C plugs that go into an Elgato dock which then connects to the laptop via a Thunderbolt/USB-C cable.\nI frequently will disconnect the laptop to go to a meeting and occasionally when I reconnect, my leftmost and rightmost screens become reversed, what I used to see on the laptop screen is now on the right external monitor. This goes for not only floating windows but also full screen apps. I then need to go into Mission Control to move the windows and full screen apps back to their preferred positions.\nSo firstly I want to know why this is happening and secondly how I can prevent that from occurring or a tool I can use to restore the windows as expected. I have seen some mention online that it could be related to which monitors are recognized by the computer first, and for sure for about 20 seconds after I plug in the cable I see a crazy dance of windows being resized and sometimes they all restore correctly. Could this be an issue with the dock or is it related to the OS and how it recognizes external monitors?\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: So one \"solution\" is to unplug the USB-C cable from the computer and replug it in.  I have at times had to do this several times before it picks up the correct configuration. Its totally anecdotal but I have found better results by unplugging and plugging it back in immediately before the computer has a chance to reorganize the windows on the laptop. So its not like the information is somehow corrupt or lost, it must be triggered by the order in which it recognizes the monitors. \n", "Q: 10-core iMac Pro's Turbo Boost When I run single-core computations on my 10-core iMac Pro, the CPU does not reach the advertised Turbo Boost of 4.5GHz but rather 3.8-3.9GHz. See plot:\n\nI am running a Mathematica code using only one kernel (note that there are 20 kernels as the CPU supports Hyper-threading). The room temperature is 24ºC and the fans are going at the minimum speed.\nAnyone knows why? Note that I am not asking what Turbo Boost is but rather why it is not performing as advertised by Apple.\nHere it is said that the Turbo Ratios can be found using Console.app.\nIs this still possible in Mojave? I could not find AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement.\n\nA: A general explanation on how the Turbo Boost feature is supposed to work may provide you some insights.\nEssentially, central processing units (CPUs) are designed to operate up to a certain thermal design power (TDP). The factors within a processor's TDP include power, temperature, etc. So, at the risk of oversimplifying things, the TDP is the maximum amount of power the processor is supposed to use.\nIntel's Turbo Boost function is dynamic. That is, it can scale up the processor speeds depending on how much thermal headroom is available. This process works independently of operating system, so it's purely a function of the Intel CPU and works the same way regardless of operating system.\nIn theory then, if you're running a 3D rendering program it'll probably only operate at its base clock speed because all ten cores will be used. However, if you're going to run software that only needs/uses two cores, then the other eight cores go into a low power state and the ones actually being used can utilise the turbo boost function to run at faster clock speeds.\nThe other factor that can come into play is the type of computations being performed. These days our computers can allocate certain tasks to the GPU instead of the CPU because the GPUs are better placed to perform those types of computations.\nGoing back to your situation, without knowing what else the iMac Pro is doing, how close it is to its thermal design power, the specifics of your single-core computations, or the working environment (ambient temperatures, etc), no-one here can provide a 100% definitive answer as to why the Turbo Boost feature isn't kicking in, or reaching its maximum potential. There are just too many variables that could be at play.\n", "Q: Can't see HD in disk utility in recovery mode, but can in OS I'm pretty new to Macs.  I got an iMac Pro in 2017 (grey one) and about 6 months ago it started giving me occasional folder flashing icon on startup.\nIt also started occasionally forgetting my password and so I'd have to reset it.\nI figured maybe the HD got corrupted, so I ran first aid on it in disk utility while logged in.  Whenever (after a restart) I run this, it says it's ok.

Call it OCD or perfectionism, that's how I roll. Thankfully, iTunes is rather convenient for basic operations like batch-changing tags or artworks, but it only goes so far. The problem is that for much music I get, the tags have to be edited for each track individually, taking into account details like numbers and such. Here's an example of what I mean:\n\nNotice that files have no embedded track numbers, and are numbered within the track name instead. This picture is more to my liking:\n\nTo achieve this within bare iTunes, one would have to input track numbers by hand and then remove the ХХ - from each name. Now, I can of course do this by repeatedly mashing the favoured combo (holding ⌥: ← → → ← ⌫ Left Mouse Button), but when I need it for 300 tracks across numerous albums, this turns into a problem.\nSo I want to have a quick way for my Mac to do this for me. I imagine something like a script that extracts track numbers from file names or name tags through use of wildcard characters and applies them to respective ID3 tags while removing numbers from names. Finder has a handy built-in dialog for batch-renaming, but as far as I know it doesn't have this specific formatting functionality. I tried Automator and MusicBrainz Picard, but they don't have that either.\nIs there anything that can be of help? Script libraries for Automator or Terminal commands? Maybe some handy AppleScript functions I don't know of?\n\nA: A Combination of AppleScript (or Shell Scripting if you are so inclined), along with a command line tool like id3v2 should do the trick.\nYou can build id3v2 from source:\nhttp://id3v2.sourceforge.net\nOr use MacPorts or HomeBrew to do the building and installation for you.\nOnce you have it installed you can view the help page by typing in \"id3v2 ah\" from the terminal. The help page is more helpful than the man page is. \nThen it is just a matter of writing the AppleScript to pass the filenames into variables and use those variables on the command line script like such:\nset shellScript to (\"id3v2 -T \" & trackNumber & space & numberofTracks & space & \"/path/to/file\") as string\ndo shell script shellScript\n\nYou may also want to think about changing the name of the file itself so that it no longer has the track number in the name! \nI hope this can get you started!\n", "Q: How to configure Xcode external build system to build and clean using standard short-cuts? [Xcode 10.1, MacOS 10.14.1]\nI have a project that uses bmake (could be any make though) and the Makefile provides a number of targets.  I would like to use Xcode to build host and clean the build folder, but I'm having trouble working out how configure Xcode to allow me to this.\nFrom the command line, I would build using bmake host and clean using bmake clean.  The reason I'm using Xcode for this is because I like to use an IDE for debugging.\nIn Project -> Info (External Build Tool Configuration), I have:\nBuild Tool  :  /usr/local/bin/bmake\nArguments   :  host\nDirectory   :  None     <- I'm using the current path\n\nWith these settings, Product -> Build builds my target, but Product -> Clean Build Folder does nothing even though Xcode reports that the clean succeeded.\nIn order to actually do a clean, I either need to define another target with the Arguments field set to clean and then switch between targets when building/cleaning, or, use a single target and change the argument field depending on whether I'm building or cleaning.  (A really clumsy way of going about it.)\nIf I leave Arguments with it's default value $(ACTION) all targets get built (except clean), and cleaning does nothing useful.\nI've read https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15652316/setup-xcode-for-using-external-compiler but that question does not address this problem.\nIs there a better way of doing this?\n\nA: The approach we are using:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run external build system (i.e. Make or CMake) via custom script from \"External Build System\" target or just as a \"Run script\" build phase.\n\n*At some point of custom script execution save a text file (say CMakeStatus.txt) to BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR, which will be used as a flag indicating that Xcode did clean.\n\n*In your custom script check that CMakeStatus.txt is present or not.

If I press Cancel the screen and keyboard will be turned off and it comes back when I touch the trackpad or press any key.\n\n\nA: I suspect this can happen if you use network authentication (like Active Directory), and your network password was changed.  Your fingerprint never changes, of course, but all your fingerprint does is unlock the password saved on your Mac.\nIf you change your password somewhere else (like on a Windows PC, or if an Active Directory admin changes it for you), your Mac won't know about the password change.\nThe fix is to only change your Mac's password using the Users & Groups preference pane in System Preferences.\n", "Q: If you give your iPhone + Passcode to someone, what harmful things could they do to your data/privacy/security? Assume you give your iPhone (iOS 12.2) + passcode to someone (e.g. teacher, law enforcement, airport security, etc.) for several hours, and then they give you your iPhone back.\nAssume the person is technically skilled and motivated to harm your data or compromise your security/privacy after the device is handed back.\nWhat harmful things can they do to your data/privacy/security? What traces would be around to identify those actions?\nIn particular, I'm interested in harmful discrete things (e.g. setting up a proxy so all web traffic is monitored). The non-harmful and easily detectable things (e.g. changing your iPhone's background) could be good to document as well, though.\n\nA: I hope the information in the answer is used keeping ethical intent in mind, and there's no intention to misuse the information.\n\nWhat harmful things can they do?\n\nPlaying devil here, I would do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change fingerprint/face data for use with Touch ID/Face ID. I'd remove existing fingerprints/faces and add mine. (This action could go somewhat undetected in case wherein you have multiple fingers registered. I could remove just one finger and register one of mine. This would however be caught when accessing 1st party app such as App Store, where you are asked for your Apple ID password, as discussed in point #3 below).\n\n*Change the passcode itself. (This could go undetected initially, until you chance upon entering the passcode, say for example after a restart).\n\n*If I change the Touch ID/Face ID data, I'll obviously be able to lock and unlock the iPhone freely without restrictions using either Touch ID/Face ID or Passcode.\nHaving entered my own Touch ID/Face ID data will give me access to host of settings. I'd also be granted access to the whole host of 3rd party apps that were protected by Touch ID/Face ID, such as WhatsApp, Dropbox etc. (Although 1st party apps such as App Store will require you to enter your Apple ID password before enabling new fingerprint/face data). Some 3rd-party apps such as 1Password are well guarded as they will ask to authenticate via the account password before enabling newly registered fingerprint/face data.\n\n\n*I'd be able to send unintended messages using commonly used chat apps such as Messages/WhatsApp to contacts. I'd also delete the conversation to remove the traces.\n\n*Wipe data off iCloud. This will lead to irreversibly losing critical data synced to and stored on iCloud such as contacts, emails, photos, notes, documents etc.\n\n*Remove data stored and synced on iCloud by 3rd-party apps.\n\n*Uninstall apps freely which will likely cause you to lose locally stored/non-backed up data.\n\n*Remove other devices linked to your Apple ID via iCloud settings.\n\n*Change privacy settings by enabling/disabling specific apps access to location/contact data etc.\n\n*Simply access/copy-off private data such as contacts, notes, photos without changing anything as discussed above and thus, you never noticing it.\n\n*Copy data off your iPhone from apps that support File Sharing. Once simply needs to unlock iPhone, connect to a computer with iTunes installed and trust both on computer and the iPhone.\n\n*I'd be able to link a brand new device to your Apple ID using iOS Quick Start. If your email client app if set up on the iPhone with your Apple ID email, I'd delete the email alert that you receive when a new device is linked to your Apple ID.\n\n*Delete the call log from Phone app.\n\n*Leave app reviews and ratings on the App Store. This may be hard to notice easily.\n\n*Enable/tweak Family Sharing and invite myself your family. I can then access paid apps and music on my device. After doing the deed, I can also remove myself from Family Sharing or disable it, and remove the traces.\nI would obviously not be able to access/change settings which require Apple ID password. This includes turning off Find My iPhone and logging out/resetting the iPhone.\n\n\nWhat trace would be around to identify those actions?\n\nFrom the user standpoint, there could be minimum to no traces to identify the actions. There's no on device mechanism to access device access logs.\nAssume that the user never attempt to unlock the iPhone or apps using Touch ID/Face ID and always use the Passcode. They could still access and copy off data such as photos, contacts via unidentifiable medium such as AirDrop.\n\nIt appears that Face ID is slightly better at protecting you here compared to Touch ID, as it currently allows only one face to be registered at a time.\n\nA: They could change your password on any website that has a password reset mechanism based on either:\n\n\n*\n\n*sending a password reset email to an email account set up on your device, or\n\n*two-factor authentication using your device.\n\n\nThey could order goods or services or make payments if you have apps that allow this.\nWith access to your email and any other sources of information on the device such as online banking apps, there is a chance they could use a 'privilege escalation' approach to gain more access to accounts or services, by collecting enough information to be able to answer the security questions needed to give instructions or make changes over the phone. For example your home address is probably in your Contacts, some apps store your date of birth, an online banking app might show details of recent transactions, and that might be enough to allow them to change your registered postal address which they could then use to request new credit cards or card PINs, reset online banking passwords if the bank only allows this by post, and so on.\nThey could delete any email records of these actions, but probably not the online records of orders or bank transactions.\n", "Q: How to hide the reply section of conversation in mail.app? On some emails it has the quoted portion hidden with a Show More From Person. On one of my conversations with many different people just shows everything. There are many replies daily and weekly and it's getting out of hand. None of the regularly quoted portions is even quoted. They're just inline and added to each reply. This makes it impossible to move from one message to the next without using the sidebar. You can't scroll down in the messages view because it just keeps going and going.\nIs there a way to change this behavior? Where it only shows the replied portion like Show More From Person?\n\nA: I'm going to offer a suggestion and a possible workaround (or two)...\nFirst, if I understand your concern properly, what is likely happening is that one of the people involved with the thread has a mail client that isn't properly quoting the content and so the mail app (like gmail before it and numerous other desktop mail clients) doesn't know what is part of the current email reply and what belongs in the past as part of the previous thread of replies. If this is the case, I'm afraid that there's nothing to be done with this current thread to fix it. Perhaps scroll back through the thread and seek the first time this occurred to determine who the offender was (whether they were aware they caused it matters not). Really, all this will do is let you know from whom to expect this in the future. It won't really fix the problem as I believe there isn't a solid solution apart from editing the email on your own prior to your next reply, which I would not recommend because if it happened once it's likely to happen again.\nPossible Workaround 1: Send a reply to the thread stating that it's the \"Archival Log\" and include everything prior to it. Next, Send another reply where you include perhaps only the last 3-5+ replies, whatever holds up the thread to scrutiny re: current discussion. At the bottom of that email, place a text string suggesting to all involved that anything previous can be found in the archival reply making note of the date/time of the archival reply so they can easily search their inbox or saved folders for that thread for reference.\nPossible Workaround 2: This might ruffle some feathers, but simply follow the second half of the previous suggestion noting that it's been truncated for simplicity.\nPossible Future Workaround 3: This option is only available to those who have autonomy over their systems or when everyone involved has accommodating IT folks and a team willing to move away from email as the primary means of comm for whatever is being discussed... \nConsider moving these types of conversations into a messaging app such as Slack. I started using slack for work about 5 years ago and have since created environments for my family. The reason I prefer it to email is that the whole \"reply thread\" isn't a thing anymore. Comments flow as they're made. No chance for replies to get crossed \"in the mail\" when multiple people are drafting their replies at the same time. Slack does have a \"threads\" feature which does work well for quick branches from the original discussion, but more than a year after it was released, it's still cumbersome to use. If you have multiple tasks or responsibilities being discussed, also consider a free project management task manager such as Asana. The beauty of asana is the ability to maintain threads specific to tasks much better than a plain messaging app. I'm not a fan of their mobile app, so I only use asana within their desktop browser web app. In a pinch, I'll look at the mobile app when away from my desk to see if I need to hurry back to the comment or if it can wait.\n", "Q: How do you fix an Apple Hardware Test (AHT) configuration?

Normally (for me anyway) after a restart of Mac OS these separate histories are lost and you are left with just one.\nAt one time (years ago) the separate histories survived a reboot (much to my delight) but after yet another OS upgrade it went back to the old behavior.  \nOver the intervening period I have done sporadic searches trying to find out if I imagined this and what the expected behaviour is but turned up nothing useful.\nSo, was I imagining this and if not how do I get terminal to preserve individual histories between reboots/logouts?\nThere is this post which I think addresses the same issue but the answer is bit cryptic for me and it isn't clear where you should add the trap command.  Although it may explain why the behaviour comes and goes if that trap is at the in /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal and then another OS release comes along without it!\n\nA: The answer is simple and obvious — i just never thought of it until I did it by accident.\nYou need to shut down the shell in each tab before you exit terminal.  Then when you restart the histories get restored as expected.  Shutting down bash causes it to execute the hooks that save the history properly \n", "Q: APFS Container Disk & APFS Container Scheme Mismatch - Cannot Resize I have an issue where I screwed up my partitions by removing a PC formatted partition, and it did not recombine itself with my overall partition.

I figured maybe I have to use bootcamp assistant to create the partition instead of doing it manually, and then overwrite it with WincClone?\nThanks in advance!!\ngpt show\n       start        size  index  contents\n       0           1         PMBR\n       1           1         Pri GPT header\n       2          32         Pri GPT table\n      34           6         \n      40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n  409640  4000387680      2  GPT part - 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  4000797320           7         \n  4000797327          32         Sec GPT table\n  4000797359           1         Sec GPT header\n\ndiskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         2.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         2.0 TB     disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +1.7 TB     disk1\n                             Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh               133.6 GB   disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 41.4 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                512.3 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      2.1 GB     disk1s4\n\ndiskutil apfs list\nAPFS Container (1 found)\n|\n+-- Container disk1 C7855526-CCEF-4FBC-9397-B560C8AA2D33\n    ====================================================\n    APFS Container Reference:     disk1\n    Size (Capacity Ceiling):      1748316786688 B (1.7 TB)\n    Capacity In Use By Volumes:   136617209856 B (136.6 GB) (7.8% used)\n    Capacity Not Allocated:       1611699576832 B (1.6 TB) (92.2% free)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Store disk0s2 681FC29B-F4C1-481D-9112-10194930CA55\n    |   -----------------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Physical Store Disk:   disk0s2\n    |   Size:                       2048198492160 B (2.0 TB)\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk1s1 A91EA382-7624-4E09-8D48-2FFF6AB12700\n    |   ---------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s1 (No specific role)\n    |   Name:                      Macintosh (Case-insensitive)\n    |   Mount Point:               /\n    |   Capacity Consumed:         133638852608 B (133.6 GB)\n    |   FileVault:                 No\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk1s2 2CF27193-404B-44CC-B33B-FFF867164EF9\n    |   ---------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s2 (Preboot)\n    |   Name:                      Preboot (Case-insensitive)\n    |   Mount Point:               Not Mounted\n    |   Capacity Consumed:         41385984 B (41.4 MB)\n    |   FileVault:                 No\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk1s3 52F3B2B8-A140-4EB6-9F9D-04D18AE8A045\n    |   ---------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s3 (Recovery)\n    |   Name:                      Recovery (Case-insensitive)\n    |   Mount Point:               Not Mounted\n    |   Capacity Consumed:         512319488 B (512.3 MB)\n    |   FileVault:                 No\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk1s4 8C075D10-42E3-4BE5-9FFC-AB2709A73909\n        ---------------------------------------------------\n        APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s4 (VM)\n        Name:                      VM (Case-insensitive)\n        Mount Point:               /private/var/vm\n        Capacity Consumed:         2147504128 B (2.1 GB)\n        FileVault:                 No\n\nResize Attempts:        \nMacBook-Air:~ XXXX$ diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk1 0\nStarted APFS operation\nError: -69743: The new size must be different than the existing size\nMacBook-Air:~ XXXX$ diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk1 2.0t\nStarted APFS operation\nAligning grow delta to 251,683,213,312 bytes and targeting a new physical store size of 2,299,881,705,472 bytes\nDetermined the maximum size for the targeted physical store of this APFS Container to be 2,048,198,492,160 bytes\nError: -69519: The target disk is too small for this operation, or a gap is required in your partition map which is missing or too small, which is often caused by an attempt to grow a partition beyond the beginning of another partition or beyond the end of partition map usable space\n\n.\n\nA: If you make the container smaller, then the mismatch will go away.

My iPhone XS is water resistant. I just got some burrito juice on it so I went ahead and washed it with soap and water.\nIt's never felt cleaner, and it feels brand new. \nIs this safe?\n\nA: No, water isn’t safe for any electronics. Neither are cleaning products, including soap. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207123\nAvoid moisture and clean as lightly and dryly as possible is best for the hardware - especially hardware that’s been used and bumped and dropped. Small cracks will grab water and soap, a surfactant, causes capillary action to be amplified. \nEven a new phone or waterproof one shouldn’t just be washed with excess water for no good reason. It really depends on the contaminant and ability to clean without a lot of water in the end. It also doesn’t mean a drop in a pool or sink will cause a phone to fail, especially the newer ones. \nNow, when choosing between your health and the phone health, most people will occasionally use something other than water, but only knowing it damages the device in excess or in concentration based on the cleaning product you choose. \n", "Q: Apple support requesting an id to activate the Apple Developer Enrolment I accidentally wrote the name that’s on my Apple ID on the billing info which is different from the one on my credit card. \n\n\n*\n\n*I don’t know how to proceed since if they reject my payment it’s not clear i could re-purchase again. \n\n*I don’t get why these organisations keep asking for identifications as if we should trust them and give our private information away.\n\n\nWhy did Apple support request my identification after purchasing an Apple Developer Program enrolment and was it legitimate?\n\nA: This is 100% normal and expected since enrolling in an Apple Developer is a legally binding - super high stakes event. You are about to be approved to sign code and push code to the App Store that will be ready to run on 1 billion devices world wide. You also will have banking and legal documents signed that could run into 10,000 dollars a month or even higher.\nI would call Apple Developer Support if you don’t understand why that organization is asking for legally binding information. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/support/\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/contact/phone/\nAlso, if you haven’t completed the sign up or payment, dev support can’t help you (yet). In that case you need to call Apple online sales support to determine if they can cancel the purchase - let you purchase again since you have money on the line or about to have $100 on the line to pay for a year of service, privilege and access to software and Apple’s marketing and development pre-release documentation. Much of that is covered by non-disclosure agreements that will get you sued if you steal and banned if you abuse the access.\nApple needs to know who you are and the details have to match to get to be a developer as the stakes are quite high for both parties. This could be your job or the careers of 10 people that can’t get paid if you publish apps as part of a company. Same for you, you could get sued if you publish apps with content you don’t own or license.\nI’ve moved twice in 2 years and had to send them my driver’s license each time and other documentation just to get my address changed. Being asked for photo ID / banking information / and being called back and checked is par for the course for a developer.\nI would recommend you get legal advice if you aren’t comfortable with signing these documents that are about to come your way once your purchase is set. Also, you don’t need to be a paid developer to run Xcode and install code on your personal devices. As a student - you can do almost all the learning you need without even paying to be a developer. Good luck whether or not you join as a paid developer this month.\n", "Q: How should I react to an email saying my Apple password has changed? Few weeks back I had a email from Apple telling me that my account was being tried to logon to from location they don’t recognise “China”. And they have locked down my account. Today I got email “Your password has successfully Reset” where as I never did changed. It had a link for me to go to “Resolution Centre” if it wasn’t me. I am bit confused on if it’s a phishing email or really from Apple? \nAnd what does it mean “Password Successfully Reset”\n\nA: We can't tell if it's a phishing email or not because you didn't supply any info about it. It's probably phishing because it often is. \nTo be safe, just go to Apple's ID Reset page on a device you trust and reset your password. This is especially urgent if you used your AppleID password at another service that was compromised, or it’s easy to guess - one of the 1,000 most common passwords like 123456.\nIf you're allowed to complete the reset then you know the emails, both of them, were fake. \nIf you can't do the reset, you'll have to contact Apple Support ASAP. In no circumstances should you click the links directly in the emails since if they're fake, the web sites you click on will harvest your actual password and you will have given up access to your account. If they are real, you will have the best chance to undo the change that was made by following Apple’s recovery from navigating to Apple pages directly:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://appleid.apple.com/\nHere’s an explanation how to trace a mail and find out if it’s legitimate with images in case that helps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this a legitimate email address from Apple support?\n", "Q: Change color of loading page in Safari When a webpage is loading in Safari, a white screen appears, be it Facebook, Gmail or any other website. If it's contents haven't appeared, then the tab appears completely white (maybe my Internet is way too slow but it takes a few seconds with almost every page, that's why it is annoying). \nIs there a way to override this color so that it appears gray/black until the page is loaded (regardless if the webpage has a white background)?\nI am running macOS Mojave 10.14.4.\n\nA: It is not possible to customize the color of loading page in Safari. However you can enable dark mode by going to System Preferences app → General → Appearance to change from white to dark gray color for the loading view.\nThe dark mode however will get applied system wide and not just to Safari.\n", "Q: iPhone: Why does the keyboard language switch randomly? Currently on my iPhone (current iOS, but this has been an issue since long ago), the keyboard language switches randomly between English and Chinese, every time I go to a new app or an input field.\nThere doesn't seem to be a pattern, like what was the input language when I last used the app. Sometimes it appears to switch to a different language even for the same app (e.g. Safari) when I switch somewhere else and switch back. I have 3 input languages installed: English, Simplified Chinese and Emoji. Though the input never defaults to Emoji.\nAny idea what is going on? Are there any fixes?\n\nA: What you are observing is not really random. It is programmatically possible to remember the last used keyboard language, from among the set of languages chosen by user under Settings app → General → Keyboard → Keyboards, on a per text input field basis. This is employed by apps which present multiple text entry fields (such as messaging apps) to automatically choose the last used or the most relevant language.\nLet me explain it with the help of an example. Suppose in a messaging app, you prefer conversing with some users in Simplified Chinese and with some in English. It's possible to program the app so that a text input field remembers the last used keyboard language. This way, the last chosen language is automatically selected for you. However, this doesn't work with the Emoji keyboard. This approach can be taken to aid user convenience.\nIf you are interested in learning about the programming aspect of how this can be achieved, refer to this answer on Stack Overflow:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/a/23403247/6995250\n\nA: I don't know what the answer is but I think it is a bug by any other name. Ever since having one brief WhatsApp conversation with someone in Germany, in which I used only English words, my iPhone switches to a German keyboard virtually every time I use it, and insists on switching back to it within the same entirely English conversation no matter how many times I re-select English.\n", "Q: View detailed data usage/consumpotion on an iPad (running iOS 11 or later) I want to keep an eye on consumption of the 4 GB data available on a mobile data plan.\nAll I found thus far is consumption in GB, counting from a certain point in time (which one can easily reset) under Settings app.\nWhat I'd like to see is:\n\n\n*\n\n*A smaller unit then GB (MB's would be good).\n\n*Data consumption on a per day basis.\nIs there any way to achieve this?\n\nA: I'm not sure about iOS 11, but iOS 12 uses MB as the unit if the data consumption is under a GB.\nWith the cellular data counter in the built-in Settings app, you are limited to the statistics shown and the option to reset counter. There's no way to further breakdown on a day/week/month basis.\nYou can try searching on the App Store for 3rd-party data monitoring apps. Some service provider provide their own app which tracks data usage over a period of time. If available, it would be best to use it.\n", "Q: Mouse-Pointer behaves abnormally Sometimes, the pointer(cursor) behaves weirdly, getting clicked here or there, undesired clicks & drags. This has happened around 5-6 times in my MacBook Pro (mid 2012).\nWhat could be the probable cause and how can I work around to remove this behaviour.\n\nA: I don't have an answer that is, \"this is your problem and I know what is going on.\" It's more of an \"it sounds like...\" answer.\nHonestly it sounds like there is an external mouse or other USB device which is (for lack of a better word) misbehaving. Which brings up the prime directive of troubleshooting, Isolate And Identify.\nUnplug everything (drives, power, monitors, everything!). Do you still have the problem? If not blame something you just unplugged, if the problem still exists then finding the issue becomes more problematic.\nStart in Safe Mode. Boot the Mac while holding the Shift Key. You can release the key when you see the Apple logo. Booting will take a longer time. Once you are logged in, does the issue still happen?\n\n\n*\n\n*If not then there is software installed on your Mac that is causing the issue.\n\n*If so then it is likely/possible it is a hardware issue.\n\n\nIf it is number 2 (from above) Then you will need to take it into an Apple Store or other Apple hardware tech and see if they can find the issue. In a situation like this it is logical to suspect the trackpad and/or the keyboard. But it is impossible to tell from this side of your screen.\nFeel free to edit your original question to the answers to these questions and we can help as best we can with more troubleshooting.\n", "Q: How to pair a Boxanne Bluetooth speaker I was given a Boxanne bluetooth speaker as a present and have been trying to pair it with my Mac but have so far been unable to.\nI just get a message saying:\n\nCouldn't connect to the device\n\nIs there another way to do this? I'm running 10.12.6 Sierra.\n\n\nA: No - there isn’t another way to pair.\nI would keep notes on what steps you see when you click Pair.\nDoes it ask for a passcode? If so, do you enter 0000 or something else?\nCan you unpair other devices and re-pair them. Sometimes if there’s a lot of bluetooth devices or a microwave oven or lots of WiFi right where you are, you could get interference.\nYou can control for that by shutting off all other transmitters - all bluetooth, all WiFi including the router and access points and trying to pair just that mac and just that device. Then you restart both devices - full power down, wait 15 to 30 seconds and power up and repeat.\nAt that point, if the Mac can’t pair with anything - seek Apple service. If that device can’t pair and others can, seek vendor support.\n", "Q: Firefox on MacOS: Default filename when downloading When downloading from Firefox on MacOS, I would like the filename to be prefixed by the ISO-date (YYYY-MM-DD-original-filename.extension). This can be achieved with a folder action in the downloads folder, but I want it to be in all folders, so a folder action is not an ideal solution.\nIf possible I'd like all new files to have the prefix, regardless of the creating app.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: My solution was to make an Automator workflow to run a shell script, and map it to a universal keyboard shortcut. This has been very useful to me, so here it is:\n# echo `date +\"%Y-%m-%d \"` + \" \"\nA=`date +%F`\necho \"$A \"\n\n\nOpen Automator and create new workflow.\n\nSet workflow to receive text from any application, choose to replace the selected text and add Run Shell Script.

I'll even go further by saying that the \"packages\" value is the number of processors, and number of processors the number of cores.\n", "Q: How can I remove an empty folder that I created manually inside the Photos library? I accidentally created an empty folder inside my Photos library. \n\nMy import process is a bit unusual. \nI first import photos from my iPhone as usual.

The panes are shown below.\n\nAnd for the keyboard.\n\nUse these to setup your bluetooth devices.\n", "Q: if \"Speak\" was used, following Select All, in iOS notes, is that audio stored anywhere on iPhone or in iCloud? iOS 12 Notes App\nwhen using iOS Notes app, i will frequently Select All, then use the Speak contextual menu tab to hear it read back.  Twice, i have had a subsequent action (like tapping spacebar in onscreen keyboard) delete the text.\n  If connected to iCloud, is the \"history\" of the document available on Mac linked to same account, or do revisions reside only on the device where Note was created?  Lacking both Save, and Undo history, makes data in a Notes file ridiculously fragile! \n\nA: I don’t think there’s a global undo buffer for iOS notes like there is for macOS notes with versions of documents being stored like TextEdit.\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a “deleted notes” section you can reference from the notes web app, but it’s not like Time Machine for going to an earlier version. \n\n\nI think you might need to change how you listen. Is it possible to speak from an insert point and not speak from a selection? That might lessen the chance of losing data you can’t restore.\n", "Q: Move a paragraph up or down in pages In MS-Word I could move a whole paragraph up/down within the text using Shift-Alt-Up or -Down keys. No need to highlight anything, Ms-word already knows which paragraph the cursor is in. Just have the cursor somewhere in the paragraph you want to bump down the text, and one Shift-Alt-Down click does it. It auto-repeats too, so it's fast and worked like a dream in text or outlines, ideal for re-ordering my thoughts.\nIn Pages I have to carefully highlight the paragraph, then drag it (or cut and paste), is there another way? There is no macro facility, sadly.   \n\nA: You can select a paragraph and right-click on it and drag it to another location. Sometimes a right-click will open a pop-up menu but just let go of right click and try again. I don't know how to turn off popup.\n", "Q: How to bring application to foreground using Spotlight/keystrokes (named windows/named applications)? I can open Spotlight with Command + Spacebar. That's nice, and I can search for the program I want in the foreground, but sometimes the application doesn't come to the foreground. Is there some series of keystrokes I can use to bring an application to foreground?  \nSometimes visually searching for it in Mission Control is too hard when you have 10+ applications running. I'd rather just type.\nSpotlight generally works, but if you have more than one open application window it doesn't quite work. Is there a way to put names on windows and then open them by name?\n\nA: \nIs there a way to put names on windows and then open them by name?\n\nNo, there is no built-in mechanism in macOS to assign names to different windows of an app and access it by names.\n\nSpotlight generally works, but if you have more than one open application window it doesn't quite work.\n\nWhen using Spotlight to search and launch an already running app, the window will be shown in the foreground in the following cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's only a single open app window.\n\n*The app window(s) are not minimized, but hidden using the keyboard shortcut Command + H.\nIf the app is hidden while none of the window is minimized, invoking app name will show all of them.\n\n*If the app window(s) are minimized, only one of them is shown in the foreground.\nThe other open and minimized windows can be brought to foreground using either one of the following methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the Dock icon for the app and select the window. The minimized windows are shown with a leading ◆ icon in the context menu.\n\n*Bring the app to foreground normally using Spotlight. Now use the Application Windows Hot Corner action to see just the app windows, maximized or minimized in a Mission Control like view.\n\n\nA: Here are two keyboard shortcuts to keep mind for navigating apps and their windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use CommandTab to bring up the App Switcher and continue pressing Tab to move left to right in the list, or press the Shift key too in conjunction  with CommandTab to move from right to left.\n\n*Once the target app is selected and comes forward, use Command` to go through the app's windows. Use the Shift key too in conjunction  with Command` to move backwards through the app's windows.\n\nNote that the ` (Grave Accent) key on a US English keyboard is usually paired with the ~ (tilde) key.\n", "Q: Rename application so I can search for it with spotlight Is there a way to rename an application so I can search for it with Spotlight?\n\n\n\nI don't see a rename option there.\n\nA: *\n\n*Select Show in Finder\n\n*Select the name of the app\n\n*Press enter\n\n*Type the new name\n\n\nBob’s your uncle.

As of now, I have to manually uncheck Keep in Dock every time I move an app icon and it's really annoying. I don't want to do that anymore. How do I disable that feature?\nThis has nothing to with \"Most recent apps\" as that's already turned off.\nAlso, this question has been asked before, but everything I've found is 3+ years old and no one has an actual solution. I'm really, really hoping that in the few years since then Apple added some basic customization.\n\nA: This is the expected behaviour and has remained the same since the days of Mac OS X 10.10. There is no way to prevent it from happening.\nIt still stands true, as of this writing, with the current latest version being macOS Mojave 10.14.5.\n\nA: Intrepid users could run a background script that watches com.apple.dock.plist for changes, then removes apps that have been added to the persistent-apps key when it finds them.\nYou could, for example, use entr and the built-in macOS tools to accomplish this:\necho ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist |\\\n  entr -s 'defaults delete com.apple.dock persistent-apps && killall Dock'\n\nOr even more simply, add defaults delete com.apple.dock persistent-apps && killall Dock to your user's crontab.\n\nA: \nJust disable this parameter in system settings/desktop&dock\n", "Q: Custom 24-hour single-hand watch face for Apple Watch Is there a way to make the Apple Watch display a 24-hour single-hand watch face? Preferably with midnight on the bottom, and noon at the top?\nSomething like this:\n\n\nA: When it comes to Apple Watch faces, one is limited to customizations as per what Apple allows.\nApp Store Review Guidelines restrict app developers from creating custom watch faces.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#minimum-functionality\n\n4.2.4 Apple Watch apps that appear to be a watch face are confusing, because people will expect them to work with device features such as swipes, notifications, and third party complications. Creative ways of expressing time as an app interface is great (say, a tide clock for surfers), but if your app comes too close to resembling a watch face, we will reject it.\n\n\nA: Apple has a Solar Dial face that is practically the same as a single arm 24 hr. face.\n\n\nLink to faces (watchOS 9)\n", "Q: Turn on Bluetooth on an iMac without a keyboard or mouse? I have a 2015 iMac, that I use with a Magic Keyboard and a Magic Trackpad. Today I was changing some settings and accidentally turned off Bluetooth, disconnecting my peripherals.\nIs there any way to get Bluetooth re-enabled without a USB keyboard/mouse? I don't have either a wired mouse or keyboard. Could I remote in from my iPhone somehow?\nIf I have to get them, will a wired keyboard be sufficient to enable Bluetooth without a mouse?\n\nA: You can use the Magic Keyboard/Trackpad as wired devices by using a Lightning-to-USB cable (like the one from your iPhone).\n\nA: \nIs there any way to get Bluetooth re-enabled without a USB keyboard/mouse?\n\nIf you have accidentally turned off Bluetooth thereby disconnecting Apple Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse/Magic Trackpad, simply hard reboot your Mac by pressing and holding the power button.\nThen restart your Mac, and it will trigger the wizard for connecting keyboard and mouse which will in turn, enable Bluetooth.\nDo note that hard rebooting may not be the desirable approach as it may cause you to lose data.\n\nCould I remote in from my iPhone somehow?\n\nIf you already have screen sharing configured, it's possible to use any of the various VNC apps available on the App Store to remote control your iMac and thereby easily turn on Bluetooth.\n\nIf I have to get them, will a wired keyboard be sufficient to enable Bluetooth without a mouse?\n\nYes. Open System Preferences, and use the keyboard shortcut Command + F to highlight the search field. Now enter keyboard shortcuts and press Enter. You'll be presented with keyboard shortcuts preference pane. Now use the keyboard shortcut Control + F7 (You may need to use the fn key), to select All controls setting.\n\nNow switch to search field again using the keyboard shortcut Command + F and type Bluetooth. Use the Tab key to move focus to Turn Bluetooth On button and press Enter or Spacebar to toggle.\n\n\nA: To add something here for anyone that happens to google their way in here and, like me, uses the Adobe Creative Cloud and has also turned off the cmd-space shortcut for spotlight... My keyboard connects via USB but I have a bluetooth mouse.\nUse cmd-tab to select Finder.\nThen cmd-U to open Utilities.\nUse arrows to navigate to Bluetooth File Exchange.\nCmd-O (that's oh, not zero) to open this while selected -- I was furiously hitting enter to no avail\nIt should detect that your bluetooth is off and prompt you to hit enter to enable\n\nA: I'm not a friend of hard reboot, which can cause trouble in macOS. I think using a Lightning-to-USB cable is a good solution.\n\"Could I remote in from my iPhone?\"\nYes you can!\nFor other problems, when macOS stalled I'm using Terminus on iPad where I configured the settings for my iMac.\nhttps://apps.apple.com/de/app/termius-ssh-client/id1176074088?l=en&mt=12\nI'm using Terminus for free.\nSimply using:\nsudo shutdown -h now\nor\nsudo reboot\ndoes the job..\n\n\nGreetings\n\nA: After rebooting , nothing happened.

So i gave it a few minutes to see if its going to unfreeze but it didnt. So naturally i restarted the machine only for it to show the circle with line across instead of the apple logo.\nI restarted it and held ALT. A “Mac” came up but not the “Windows” clickable thingy. I selected the Mac and again the same story with the line across the circle. \nRestarted the Mac again now holding Command-R for internet recovery. Opened Disk Utility and i could see this \n\nThen i verified the \"525.11 GB Crucial...\" and i got this:\n\nThen i clicked repair volume and it said it was fixed so i restarted the Macbook but i still got the same cross thing and when i got back to Disk Utility and verified the volume again, it again gave me the same error. (forgot to add, tried to reinstall OSX but only the Windows partition showed up)\nFast forward to today I tried to do what i saw in this Stack Exchange.\nI removed the Windows partition and then removed the Mac one, then i tried to remount the OSX partition but i got no space available error\n\nNow instead of showing disk0s2 and BOOTCAMP under the Crucial volume, it only shows the BOOTCAMP one.\n\n\nHeres the list before i tried to unmount:\n\nAnd after:\n\nHeres a few more pictures i took:\nHeres me retrying to repair disk volume after the Macbook was turned off for a day (but before i unmounted it!!!).

You said no, by canceling the sync. \niCloud is a syncing service.  \nWhen you turn it back on after it was off it needs to re-sync all your data again. That could take 24 hours if your computer and network aren't doing anything else.  If you're using the computer, it will put your iCloud download on a lower priority than the other work you're doing.\nMake sure your computer remains awake, plugged in, and maintains a network connection.

It outputs 2.1A 5V, and I learned that the MBP can be charged with that, but I don't know if that's actually true (is it?). It would take about 12 hours to fully charge it I think, which is okay\nNow next problem is finding a USB to MagSafe 2 Adapter. Any ideas?\nWhat if I use USB to USB-C, and USB-C to Magsafe 2 adapters? :) Those are readily available on the market.\nEdit. I've found this which simplifies things.\nDo you think this is safe? (charging mbp with 11W)\n\nA: Apple's MBP power cable supplies a maximum of 60W of power in order to both use the machine and recharge the battery at the same time.\nIf you're not using the MBP, then it's possible that 11W is enough to charge the battery, albeit very slowly, as you indicate. \nIt's unlikely that you would be able to use the machine with 0% battery on 11W, and even if you could, then the battery would barely recharge at all.\nSo, this might well work for the sort of emergency that required you to leave your MBP closed and plugged in for several hours until you could use it a bit.\nAlso: you will only draw the full power over USB C connector. USB 3.0 A connectors can only draw 0.9 A.\n", "Q: How to tie \"Primary\" and \"Secondary\" monitor spaces? I want to have 9 set of spaces, each one spanning 2 monitors.

Additionally disabling 'auto rearrange based on recent' will make the numbering stick.\nSo - this is 2 monitors, 7 spaces. Each 'Space' covers the pair of screens & their contents. Changing Space changes both monitors simultaneously.\nThe 'reappearing window' top right is Activity Monitor, which is set to be on all Spaces.

Maybe. First I tried:\n tell application \"QuickTime Player\"    \n    set current camera to video recording device named \"My Name's iPhone\"\n    end tell\n\nand I got an error that the current camera could not be set to that. I also tried to set it back to \"FaceTime HD Camera\" and QuickTime Player did not like that either. \nNext I tried:\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\"\n    set theRecording to new movie recording\n    set theDocument to its document \"Movie Recording\"\n    tell theDocument\n        set current camera to video recording device named \"FaceTime HD Camera\"\n        start\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nBut still got an error when trying to set the current camera property. \nSo the closest I could come was to set the camera and audio manually, and QuickTime Player should remember those settings. So then you can just use this script to start the recording. Although to be honest, it doesn't really do what couldn't be done with the same amount of button clicks in QuickTime Player itself!\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\" \n    set theRecording to new movie recording\n    set theDocument to its document \"Movie Recording\"\n    tell theDocument\n        start\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThat does not completely answer your question, since I could not set the video and audio sources for the new movie. The AppleScript dictionary for QuickTime Player that the \"current camera\" property of the document \"new recording\" should be able to be set by AppleScript. So possibly someone smarter than me can figure out how to set it.\n", "Q: Is there ANY disadvantages of charging MBP 13\" with a powerbank that outputs 10W? Device is Macbook Pro 2015 13\". It has 74.9 Wh battery. Its original adapter is 60W. While charging the device will stay turned off.\nIf its allowed, I'll link an example powerbank. Its 25000mAh / 92.5Wh. Output (Max): USB 5V/2.1 A. \nI suppose from 0% to 100% would take 8-12 hours. \nIs there ANY disadvantages of charging MBP 13\" with a powerbank that outputs 10W?  (Besides slow charging time :)\nPS. I don't even know if this is possible.\nFor adapter, I'll use this and maybe this\n\nA: No. Slower charging is always healthier for the battery and the chemistry since it reduces heat. \nLithium chemistry service life is severely degraded at high charging temperatures (hotter than any device would charge, but the higher the temp the fewer cycles you will get on average). \nAs long as you can abide by slower charging, there is no other downside to your scenario. \n\nA: Your question comes across (to me at least) somewhat similar to an XY problem. Having looked at the links in your post, it seems you've got a reason to use an outdoor charging device (hence the Solar Charger) and are looking at how you could get this to work. \nThere are actually products designed specifically to charge MacBooks and other laptops when people are on the go (e.g. backpacks with built-in solar chargers, etc) and a dedicated product is going to be a much more convenient and reliable charging source than the approach you're looking at here. \nThat said, to answer your question, some concerns around this approach are:\n\n\n*\n\n*this charger is not designed to charge laptops\n\n*for this particular charger to work in your scenario you need multiple 3rd party items (i.e. an adapter cable and a USB-C to USB A connector)\n\n*The long time it will take for this to charge your MacBook (which you've already noted)\n\n\nIn a nutshell:\n\n\n*\n\n*there is no disadvantage to the MacBook Pro itself\n\n*there is likely to be a disadvantage for the solar charger - I suspect it will work, but its lifespan will be reduced. That said I see it has an 18 month warranty (although using it in this way may void that).\n\n*there are disadvantages to you in that it will need to be switched off during charging and the fact charging will take long durations of time.\n\n\nIf it was me and I needed to charge a MacBook Pro on the go on a regular basis (not sure this is your situation), I would look at options such as those offered by Voltaic Systems.\nIf this is only something you need to do occasionally, (e.g. a couple of camping trips a year), then your approach will probably be fine, although not the best option.\n", "Q: How to invert colors of a picture on Mac?

I'm currently using a mac with 3 bootable partitions (multiboot).

Now, I'm unable to update Arch because I don't have enough space left.\nAs far as I know, Mac stores the boot menu on the disk itself and has been afraid of messing with the disk too much because I don't want to end up bricking the macbook like I've done 2 times in the past. Changing the disk did not work, and I got a new one warranty.\nHere is a screenshot from that (Question was removed)\n\n\n*\n\n*https://i.imgur.com/ZSVnoL7.png\n\n*https://i.imgur.com/HzXrcPO.png\n\nThis is my plan\n\n\n*\n\n*Clone the partition to a 32GB USB Flash drive using Clonezilla\n\n*Delete all partitions except MacOS\n\n*Create a new partition with 128 GB\n\n*Boot to Clonezilla again, and clone from USB to partition (This is the part I'm worried about)\n\n*I would imagine I would need to extend the partition aswell after the cloning.\n\n\nAre there any risk of overwriting the boot or bricking the Macbook?\n\nA: Certainly it is not safe (in my opinion) to resize without deleting the partition, which is the core part of your plan. \n\nClone the partition to a 32GB USB Flash drive using Clonezilla\n\nI personally would clone from OSX to a Sata external drive.\nSo your plan appears okay, alebit I would do it differently: if you are happy consigning an operating system to USB. I think you have omitted one important point: to make sure you have a full Timemachine backup before deleting all other partitions except your Mac OSX. If your accidentally trash you Mac compartment, it is easily restored.\n\nTimemachine is essential for this operation. If you don't have a TM backup, simply click Apple icon->System Preferences->Timemachine, then assign your backup disk. The backup will take hours for the first time, but is quick thereafter. It will only backup your OSX.\n\nResizing without deleting a disk\niPartition could perform resizing without deleting a disk, but its unsafe (definitely not recommended). If anything goes wrong my experience was you lose your entire harddrive. So yes you can do a resize without \"bricking\" (deleting) your Linux, personally I wouldn't risk it. You definitely need all drives backedup to do this. Note the company that does iPartition is no longer trading but the app is available free from July. However it does not work with Mojave (10.13 and below).\nI don't know Clonezilla, but have used CCC (Carbon Copy cloner) which is good, but I think you pay for it now. I presume Clonzilla is free. \nI would do point 4. differently. \n\n\n*\n\n*Once you have cloned the disk you can use Go->Utilities->DiskUtilities and  \"Restore\" option to clone the Linux versions back onto their respective disks.\n\n*DiskUtilities use to have a cloning option (as well as a Restore option), I assume its still there somewhere, perhaps when you login via Recovery mode it 'appears'.\n\n", "Q: Add access to the macbook camera for the terminal application I am trying to run a OpenCV tutorial that uses the cv.VideoCapture(0).

This time, the installer complained of some missing files.\nI booted back into my Mac and deleted the .app file, but the boot menu (by pressing Option during boot) are still showing 3 partitions: mac OS Installer, OSX, and Recovery HD—in that order.\nThe weird thing is, both mac OS Installer and Recovery HD seem to open the same thing—a menu(?) where you can reinstall Lion(!!!).\nMy question: How do I remove mac OS Installer from the boot menu? Or, at least, reorder the menu so that OSX comes first.\nI read on the internet to rerun the installer and cancel it there—well, I've deleted the file so I have to download it again, but now App Store prevents me from downloading it (\"This version of macOS 10.14.5 cannot be installed on this computer.\"—I know! Why didn't you say so last time!)\n\nA: You would have to get another Mac with an ethernet port, boot your Mac in Target Disk mode (Command T) and connect it via ethernet to the other Mac. You can also use the Thunderbolt 2 ports to network the two Macs. \nOnce it's up, you can access your Mac's HD as if it was an external HD, and you can remove the file from there.\nAdditionally, you could try booting into recovery Mode (Command R) and fix your HD's permissions with Disk Utility.\nThe thing is, the App store would have prevented you from even downloading Mojave, since it checks your hardware for compatibility. Mojave also lists its system requirements as well a the compatible systems on the website, as well as the App store.\nSo, I suppose you must have downloaded Mojave from somewhere else. The reason why we can't install Mojave in older systems is because of compatibility. Mojave also needs a lot of resources that only newer systems can handle. The oldest systems that can still handle Mojave are those released in 2012, whereas those from 2011 and below can only handle up to High Sierra.\n", "Q: Glitch or bad design during booting on Mojave?

Is this a design issue or missing cache?\nmacOS 10.14.5 (18F203)\n\nA: The firmware controls that phase of screen rendering, not the OS.\nMy understanding is that by design, the full graphics library mode isn’t enabled intentionally. Whether people label it a glitch or feature (or good / bad design) might be wading into opinion territory. I don’t know the back story on this, but it’s plausible an engineer figured the risk (or manager figured the priority/cost) to embedding more code into firmware when weighed against a “let’s be pretty about everything” design goal. We can all agree on what shipped though by inspecting the screen during updates.\nWe are not seeing any problem with the update at work so haven’t reported this as a problem to Apple.\n", "Q: Can't locate App Store in iTunes for macOS Every time I launch iTunes on my Mac, there is no App Store item in it and I can't access the apps that I have launched on the App Store. .\n\nA: Please check that the iTunes Store is not disabled in the Restrictions pane in iTunes preferences (see screenshot below).\n\nApp Store functionality has been removed in iTunes 12.7 and later.\nApple provides a version of iTunes which still contains the App section and App Store.\nPlease see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208079 for more info and download link.\nThis version (12.6.5) can be installed even if a newer version of iTunes exists on your machine (it replaces the newer version). It also stops iTunes from updating (e.g. after installing, iTunes stays at v12.6.5).\nIt does not work in macOS 10.14 Mojave, though.\n", "Q: Is there a way to archive Live Photos to the filesystem on macOS? I like the ability to take Live Photos on my iPhone.\nI bought a Mac and I can see them in the Photos App, but when I transfer them to my personal folders in my account, the live effect is lost.\nIs there any way to transfer them to folders without losing that Live feature? \n\nA: What I have found is the ability to export the .JPG and .MOV versions of the same photo to a folder in Mac.\nGo to File-> Export-> Export unmodified original. Then chose the folder. This created a .JPG and a .MOV file with the same first name. I imported both of them together using cmd+shift+I and they appeared as one. \nI checked (but not thoroughly) through Pictures-> Photos Library.photoslibrary right click-> show package contents.

I know that there is a keyboard shortcut that lets you open the emoji palette while you are typing, but I could not find any shortcut that lets you close the palette.\nSo right now, whenever I finish adding my emoji I manually close it by tapping on the top-left red X button. This is quite troublesome, so is it possible to close it via the keyboard shortcut?\nI use Mojave on 2017 MacBook 12'.\n\nA: If your emoji window looks as on the screenshot below - it means that you might have accidentally switched it from the default popup mode into that half-broken \"window\" mode. I did it once as well, no idea how. You need to press the highlighted button and it's going to get back to the popup mode.\nIn the popup mode it disappears once you press the esc or select an emoji with the arrow keys and press enter.\n\n\nA: The behaviour is somewhat awkward.\nEven the Menu option doesn't toggle it on/off, only on.\nIf you simply double-click your emoji without doing anything else, it doesn't even bring the window to the front... \n..so, the only real option is after you open it, click its header bar [while you're over there anyway to grab your emoji]\nIt will then respond to  Cmd ⌘   W  the same as any other window.  \n Of course, if you forget, it will close the window you were working in  :\\  \n", "Q: Does running both (XCode & Android Studio) at the same time overload my MacBook Air with only 8 GB of Ram This IDE is for the Automation Testing Purpose.\nAlong with Appium Server, I need to run the Emulator of Xcode's iOS Emulator and the Android Studio's Emulator. \nDoes this Run smoothly in the 8GB RAM of Macbook Air.\n\nA: Yes you can and should load up your machine and see how it behaves. I don't think you'll get an overload at all.\nThe activity monitor will tell you when you run into memory pressure and you can see if swap helps or if you have a workload that would save you time on different hardware.\nI’ve still not replaced my 2015 MacBook with 256 NVMe SSD (blazingly fast storage when it was introduced and still in the ballpark on 2019 models for what I need)\n\nI run mongodb, make single page web apps, design and test API and deployment scripts, package Mac software for enterprise distribution, sign apps, notarize apps and generally work / debug / program and develop on this machine. Yes, some newer hardware is faster on benchmarks but in real life, I'm the thing the computer is waiting on always in terms of getting meaningful work done and I know how to measure when I'm waiting for the computer and can then buy a different kit when (and only when) I know I'll save money or time with more horsepower or more RAM.\nIn fact, developing on this means my solutions run even faster since I know when I make a bad decision and memory isn't free and to make a better database query, better data structure, more elegant code rather than assuming everyone that runs my apps spent $4000 on their portable.\n\nA: You can install them both because installing only takes up disk space, not RAM. If you try to run them both simultaneously there may be a problem depending on how much RAM each application takes. They both may run simultaneously but they may be slow.\n", "Q: Applescript to filter the clipboard Let say I have this in my clipboard :\n************TH4F    fsdfssdggg0878  Ex.US   Unknown 0   $100.00 05/24/17 04:40  No Bonus    \n************TH4F    fsdfssdggg0878  Un.UK   Unknown 0   $50.00  05/20/17 04:44  No Bonus    \n\nwho can I only keep the total and add it in a list and same for the date ?\nI'm a bit stuck on the script for now :\nrepeat with i in (get (the clipboard)'s text items)\n    return i\nend repeat\n\n\nA: You can't really (or shouldn't) use text items without first defining your text item delimiters.\nIf each field in the formatted text is separated by a tab character, then the task is trivial:\nset my text item delimiters to tab\n\nset cbTotals to {}\nset cbDates to {}\n\nrepeat with row in the paragraphs of (the clipboard as text)\n    set the end of cbTotals to text item 6 of the row\n    set the end of cbDates to text item 7 of the row\nend repeat\n\nIf the fields are, as they appear here, actually separated by a variable number of spaces, then one might be tempted to count each space between each field, and enumerate the text items in the same way we just did above.  However, this is impractical, and more importantly, it is not a very robust way to approach this in a general context, because the content of your data might change slightly at some point.  For example, you may, on one occasion, select the text flush with the start of the line, whilst on another occasion, over-select and include some leading whitespace.\nOne way to ensure consistency is to deal with the spaces first:\nset my text item delimiters to space\n\nset |cb₀| to the text items of (the clipboard as text)\n\nrepeat with cbField in |cb₀|\n    if cbField's contents = \"\" then set cbField's contents to missing value\nend repeat\n\nset cb to the strings in |cb₀| as text\n\nNow cb contains an homogeneously-delimited version of your clipboard data, where each field is separated by a single space character.  Now we can employ the same technique from earlier, and obtain the relevant text items.  Without changing your text item delimiters, which will currently be set to space:\nset cbTotals to {}\nset cbDates to {}\n\nrepeat with row in the paragraphs of cb\n    set the end of cbTotals to text item 6 of the row\n    set the end of cbDates to text item 7 of the row\nend repeat\n\n", "Q: disk drive about full. Library folder has over 100 GB I have an old iMac running High Sierra. I have an internak 250 GB drive and a 4 TB eternal hdd. My internal drive is about full. I was going to clear up some room but I noticed my library folder has over 100 GB. Is there anyway to delete some of the files and folders in the library folder. Can the library folder be moved to the HDD instead. \nI asked a similar question a couple of months ago and was told to turn on disk opimization. I've done that. Now i'm asking if there is anything I can do about the library folder?\n\nA: Is this the root-level /Library, or the user ~/Library ?\nThe former contains things installed by applications: this could include large data like audio sample instruments for Garageband/Logic. \nThe user Library contains settings and preferences, but it can also contain iPhone and iPad backups, which can take up a lot of space. You can manage these in iTunes' preferences.\nYou can use an app like OmniDiskSweeper which will show you the contents of your disk, sorted by size. You can drill down through each folder and see what's taking up space, and delete files if you wish. However, remember that it is very easy to delete files that may be critical and necessary to your Mac.\n\nA: I recommend using a program like Grand Perspective to first figure out why your library folder is so big and what files are the biggest. I also have a large spinning disk for bulk data and try to use my internal SSD for core data. \nWith many programs, you can specify the storage location for large amounts of data. If a program allows it, you usually need to close the program, move the folder and then tell it where the folder was moved to. (and maybe restart the program again after that)\nIn some cases, like Spotify offline downloads, specifying the download location doesn't actually help with storage as Spotify won't save the large downloads in the specified location.\nIf you really want to dig deep, you might be able to move the folder to the other disk and put a symbolic link to the new location of the data in the original location although some programs might not follow the symlink.\n", "Q: Regain control of an Apple Account I have an older Apple account i haven't used for a few years, I know the email (And have access to the email address) its linked to and i know the password. \nHowever when i go to the apple account management page (https://appleid.apple.com/#!&page=signin) and tried to sign in, it asks for answers to my security questions which I know longer know the answers to. I tried to go to https://iforgot.apple.com/password/verify/appleid but... it asks me for the answer to my security questions... when i select i need to change my security questions.\nHow can I go about regain control over this app?\n\nA: First thing - think twice before trying to brute force guess passwords. If this is due to a developer program requirement, and especially if you continue to pay for that - start with developer support.\nIt's OK that you forgot the passwords and ask what method you can take to validate it's really you regaining control of the account.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/support/\nIf you're locked out, you might need to make careful notes of what you click at:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://iforgot.apple.com/password/verify/appleid\nBe very clear what step you can't get past and be patient with the people helping. They are there to prevent someone wishing to take over your developer account so you might need to write a certified letter, get something notarized, take several weeks to get them to help.\nWhen you're ready to admit you can't get in - phone support might be your last avenue to get someone to point you to any alternate unlock methods or deliver the news that Apple will not help you break into the account.

When using the interactive Macports shell (running port), is there a way to delete characters to the right of the cursor? \nNormally, you can simply use key the combination Fn + Delete to forward-delete. However, when this is used, the result is the production of a ~ (tilde) character.\nMy bash version is: GNU bash, version 3.2.53(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin11).  My Macports version is: Version: 2.5.4. My OS X version is: 10.7.5 Lion.\n \nUPDATE: As mentioned by daniel Azuelos, control+d will delete forwards one character at a time. However, this is dangerous - if there is no text to be deleted, it will exit the interactive shell as well as the terminal (at least using bash).\n\nA: I didn't test it with Lion, but there is a high probability that control+d would delete the character to the right of the  cursor, and control+k would\ndelete everything to the end of line.\n", "Q: How to view individual images in photos app I changed iPhone's and with the new one the photos get imported successfully - as shown below.

I have seen trouble before with HGST drives and that model MBP.\nAssuming you successfully tested the drive another way and found it working, I would try a new internal hard drive cable. Check the cable model number on its undeside, it's either 821-1480 or 821-2049.

But how can I tell for sure whether it is safe to delete? Why does it exist to begin with?\n\nA: This happens because of a change that happened within the High Sierra versions. It is unknown whether this is a bug, or simply a change of hearts at Apple, but with High Sierra the location of the swapfile was changed from /private/var/vm to /vm, and then in a later update to High Sierra moved back to /privat/var/vm.\nThe best way to proceed is to ensure that you have upgraded to the latest High Sierra version. If the extraneous swapfile in /vm/swapfile0 still exists and takes up disk space, then boot up in Recovery Mode, use Disk Utility to mount the main volume, and start a Terminal and run: (replace TheVolumeName with the name of the main volume)\nrm /Volumes/TheVolumeName/vm/swapfile0\n\nThen you can reboot afterwards.\n", "Q: SysAdmin account shows at login, but doesn't work and is not listed in Users & Groups When I start my MacBook Air (Mojave), I see the correct list of accounts from which to choose.\nIf I choose my SysAdmin account, it accepts the password correctly, the horizontal progress bar advances to the end and then it redisplays the login screen with the list of available accounts - but MINUS the SysAdmin account.\nIf I logon with another account which has admin privileges and look in Users & Groups, I see all the accounts listed, minus the non-functioning SysAdmin account.

This is basically the same setting that you got with the Mac Book Pros 2012 - 2015 as default. \n\nI am a developer and use code editors so it's very important to me that my function keys are the first class citizens on my keyboard. I also want access to the control strip for screen and volume control using the fn keys (How else can I easily get to these?).\nGreat!\nSo now how do I access the \"App Controls\" as well? Surly I should be able to configure say fn+option to give me these?\nFinding this very frustrating, makes the touch bar seem even more pointless if I can only have the settings I was used to with a \"Real\" keyboard. Seems I have to give something up to use the touch bar's app specific controls.\n\nA: Try Better Touch Tool.\n\nI don't see a way to have the Touch Bar display function keys (initially) AND allow for the use of both App Controls and Control Strip.\nAren't you accustomed to holding fn when using the function keys anyway? I think this is the behavior Apple had in mind (show App Controls and use fn for function keys).\nInstead of an additional keyboard shortcut, I'd suggest Apple add a \"Show Control Strip\" box on the the Fn setting when you choose App Controls (like the first drop down behaves).\n\nWorst case: use an external keyboard when developing.\n\nA: Not an answer, but here's what I've done as a compromise:\nIn System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Function Keys, I add all applications where I want to have Fn keys as default. These are basically code editors, terminals, browsers etc. That way, when I'm developing, I will always see the function keys.\nIn almost all other apps (messaging, video calls, calendar etc.) I find the App controls + Control Strip default more useful, so I leave that as the default for all other apps. I've noticed that I rarely if ever use the Fn keys in these apps.\nTo me this is the only half-decent solution without buying Better Touch Tools.\n", "Q: transfer video file to iphone from macbook over shared internet connection My iPhone is USB-connected to my macbook and my macbook has internet sharing turned on.\nHow can i send a video file from my macbook to the iphone using the command line?\n\nA: [Not a full answer; not re CLI] \nI don’t know if the transfer is possible in a useful manner, but look at iExplorer from Macroplant & especially its feature to use device as USB drive.

So, I have an external HDD which is being used for Time Machine.\nAfter getting to home, I usually connect my MacBook to a HDD via Hub and put it into sleep mode. Because I sometimes get back home late during the night, the Time Machine backup may happen during midnight. However, in the morning I have to wake up my mac, only to safely eject the HDD and put the MacBook into sleep mode again for bringing my MacBook out.\nSo I searched in order to create a scheduled disk eject job that can be run during sleep. I looked for solutions like crond, launchd, but even launchd cannot run a script during sleep mode if I properly understood the documentation - even if I set up a job with StartCalendarInterval it will not be invoked until the MacBook is woken up.\nIs there any commercial app or another approaches that can be used for my situation?\nMy OSX is latest version of Mojave.\n\nA: I think the Energy Saver suggestion is a good place to start:\n » System Preferences » Energy Saver » Schedule and set it for, say, 30 minutes before you want to leave for work.\nHowever, I would not schedule it to go back to sleep unless you know that it has actually succeeded in ejecting the disk. Otherwise you might have the disk not eject for some reason, and then if you remove the drive, you'll get that terrible message about ejecting a drive improperly.\nSo, let's say that you want to leave for work at 8:00 a.m.\nSet Energy Saver to wake the computer at 7:30 a.m.\nThen I would use Keyboard Maestro to run a script at 7:35 a.m. to unmount the drive. (You can schedule specific times for macros in Keyboard Maestro.)\nThe first step of the macro would be a shell script to unmount the drive.\nI have a shell script to do this already, so I'm sharing it here.

Using Sublime Text 2 or Atom (maybe other editors too), when running a simple plotting script in Python, the Python Launcher icon (the rocket) pops up every time I run the code. The icons add up in the Dock , and I have to close them individually. Is there any configuration to avoid this behavior?\n\nWith Sublime Text, for instance, Command + B is the default shortcut I use to run a script. I have not found this issue addressed in Atom's or Sublime Text's documentation (neither in Stack Exchange).\nThe script that I use is a basic fit to some data:\nimport csv\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.interpolate import *\n\nwith open('data.csv', 'rU') as mycsv:\n    data = csv.reader(mycsv)\n    x = []\n    y = []\n    for row in data:\n        x.append(float(row[0]))\n        y.append(float(row[1]))\n\np = polyfit(x, y, 2)\nxp = linspace(-5, 1, 1000)\n\nplt.scatter(x, y)\nplt.plot(xp,polyval(p,xp),'r-', label='p1')\nplt.show()\n\n\nA: I'm not familiar with pyplot, but from the documentation, it looks like the show() method 'holds onto' (\"blocks\") the script until it is closed by some user interaction.\n\nIn non-interactive mode, display all figures and block until the\n  figures have been closed;\n  A single experimental keyword argument,\n  block, may be set to True or False to override the blocking behavior\n  described above.\n\nOther methods like ginput() and waitforbuttonpress() describe the blocking process.\nYou could test this by commenting out the last line and see if the icons persist.\n\nA: In your setup Sublime Text is running the python script by running python script.py as if from the command line. \nThis starts a new python interpreter process for each run. This is documented (and is the actual example used) in the Build Systems part Sublime Text Manual\nNormally this is OK but in your case you are running a script that will stay open until it is manually closes. All these processes are independant and have no idea of the others and so you just keep getting more.\nTo have only one python process and thus one icon on the desktop you need a different set up. In general this is using a REPL (read-eval-print-loop) which passes all your python commands to one process. I am not a sublime text user so I don't know if a REPL from it can  show graphics.\nIn your case of lots of graphs I would look at Juypter Notebooks. In Juypter python is started as an external process the kernal and your editor sends python command to it, thus there is one Python process that knows about all the graphs. A quick google suggests that there is a package Hermes for Sublime Text. \n", "Q: How can one fix a Mac OS App Store that stops updating? I've been occasionally (but annoyingly) noticing a situation with Mojave (I've never seen it in OS versions before Mojave) where I know that an app purchased through the AppStore has an update available, but the AppStore will not show that the app needs to be updated. In order to get the update, I have to delete the app and then redownload it.\nI first noticed this for Agenda. Then the problem went away for a while, and apps that I purchased through the AppStore updated automatically.\nNow it is happening for Ulysses. Specifically, Ulysses had updated automatically to version 16 on my iPhone and iPad, and since it is always updated at the same time on all platforms, I launched the AppStore to check to see whether it had been updated on my MacBook Pro. The app is still at version 15.2. When I launch the AppStore, I see this:\n\nSo it was updated on the AppStore 16 hours ago. Notice how it shows \"Open\" in the top right of the screenshot? Well, if I click that, it does launch Ulysses -- version 15.2.\n\nA: In addition to the auto update issue, I noticed by chance that the App Store showed download arrows for iWork apps -- when they were clearly installed on my MBP’s internal flash drive. I had the insight that something might be wrong with Spotlight. After I rebuilt the Spotlight index, not only did the App Store properly recognize that I had the iWork apps installed, but automatic updating appears to have been restored.\nSo it’s obvious that the AppStore relies on Spotlight for its update mechanism.\n", "Q: New MacBook Air - update installation failed I have a new MacBook Air.

I'm having the same problem as the person who asked this question: I cleared a bunch of files out of my Trash and instead of getting free space on the volume, I got 30 gigs of \"purgeable space\".  According to the accepted answer to that question, I can engage in an entirely reprehensible workaround to liberate this space from its ghostly, meaningless existence in purgatory—a strategy to which I may well be forced to resort.\nNone of the answers to that question, however, deal with the more fundamental issue of why this is happening in the first place.  Ideally I'd like to avoid having to do this ever again.  Is there some way to tell the filesystem not to mark files as \"purgeable\" rather than just removing them?  I'm running High Sierra, and the system drive (the drive in question) is using APFS.\n\nA: Based on this Apple support article, I gathered that the purgeable space might be taken up by local snapshots.  I had already backed up since emptying the Trash, but I have more than one backup drive.  I removed the backup disks that aren't accessible at the moment and some time later my system drive's purgeable space was shown to have been alchemically transmuted into free space.\nSince Apple hasn't bothered to include information on how local snapshotting works when you have multiple backup drives, and since I never managed to discover a way to identify what is currently contained in purgeable space, I can't be entirely certain that this was what fixed the issue.  It would be quite helpful if there were to be a post listing the various ways that purgeable space can come about and how to prevent this from happening.  I haven't managed to find such a resource; in fact, the support article doesn't even include the word \"purgeable\"; perhaps comprehending such an arcane detail is considered to be beyond the mental capacity of Apple's target demographic, even for its support pages.\n", "Q: How to use ABC Extended with standard British PC keyboard layout The ABC Extended input is fantastic for inputing several diacritics, but it only seems to assume apple's own layouts, i.e. it doesn't recognise the standard British PC layout. Is there a way to make it work with the standard British PC layout, particularly re: the symbol mismatches between the two?\nStandard British PC has shift+2=\" and shift+'=@.\nThe Apple British layout has shift+2=@ and shift+'=\".\nIn British PC, the key left of 1 is ` ¬, but in Apple British it is  § ±.\nIn British PC, the key left of z is \\ |, but in Apple British it is ` ~.\nIn British PC, the rightmost key of the asdf row is # ~, but in Apple British it is \\ |.\nSuppose I definitely do not plan to use the Apple British layout at all, but may need to work with the standard British PC layout. Is there a way to reconfigure certain things for the ABC Extended input to be compatible with the standard British PC layout?\n\nA: Update -- Problem solved with Ukelele. I copied the layout of the current input source and then manually adjusted the key mappings (including the shift modifications etc.). It took me just a few minutes.\n", "Q: 161gb not appearing on diskutil after deleting second OSX partition I deleted my second OSX partition and I'm missing 161gb of space.

the parts of disk0 are mutually exclusive and the disk0s3 is locking away 167.6 GB of space from the main container.\nIn my case, you can see that both volumes see the same amount of free space and you'll not have that flexibility since you have two high level \"Containers\" that can't share free space.\n\nAssuming you just want to get rid of the second container are you more comfortable deleting from Disk Utility or the command line?\n", "Q: Work MDM and family sharing Using personal apple id on work mac. Thinking of enabling family sharing. Will doing so give the MDM used by the employer to gain access to the family apple accounts? \n\nA: Except error the MDM is only used to push config or app installations (this is how I use it). He can't have access to your password and personnal information. But it can report information from the accounts you are connected to, the apps you have installed and other information. Personally, we don't do this because there's no interest to be spying on our employees. With the MDM we simply update the Apps and configure the macs at a distance for new users, integration of the mac in the LDAP domain, addition/update of NAS url and anything else like that.\nFamily sharing is only a particular \"option\" to share content purchased with your account for me. Now if you want to share Apps installed on the mac, it won't work. The best thing is to explain in more detail what you want to do.\n", "Q: Identifying an iPad/iPhone by Model Number The model number of an iPad/iPhone can be determined by going to:    \nSettings app → General → About → Model Number\nHow to use this value (the one in ML2I2KN/A format) to determine the device type? It is an official model identifier from Apple, but how can one use it to identify their device? I didn't find any service of the kind at Apple's website.\nIf you tap on Model Number it will show another value - in format like A1652, and this value can help to find a general model at Identify your iPad model page (or similar for iPhone), but unlike ML2I2KN/A it cannot be used to determine color and storage capacity of the device.\nThere is 3-rd party service Everyi, but quite often it doesn't find anything. For example, searching for ML2I2KN/A gives nothing (I know it's iPad Pro 12.9 from 2015, but that's not the point).\nSimply googling this value will highly likely result in some store's website with the correct item specification, and there is also this wiki page with quite an impressive table of models.\nBut is there any  Apple official resource for this purpose?\n\nA: You can check this site, some products can be found here. Hover mouse over the model, capacity and color will be displayed like this. It seems that Apple only wants to distribute this information within the company, there is no more public information.\nhttp://salesdownload.apple.com/public/sites/asw/common/compliance/Other_iPad.htm\n\nA: Apple documents model numbers in their “how to identify” knowledge base / support web pages.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201296\nVendors and partners have more detailed / concise / complete documentation as well, but any recent phone should be readily searchable.\nI’m not aware of any crowd sourcing resource that documents this better than your example but a Wikipedia list or developer or just an enthusiast might surely have done work to catalog these if you need a more complete / concise listing than what Apple provides publicly.

I currently have 283.0.0.0.0 Boot ROM SW installed on my crippled Late 2012 iMac - which I upgraded HDD->SDD, tried to unsuccessfully install Mojave, then broke fusion setup, erased drives and am now stuck (see other questions on that...)\nSpecifically one thing I would like to try is to use the last standalone EFI update dmg from Apple support website Apple EFI and SMC Updates for my model  (iMac13,2)\nI can only access Single User Mode - I don't make it as far as Recovery with Utilities and Terminal options.\nIs it possible to do this from Single User Mode? I can put files onto a Mojave or High Sierra external image which I could then access but I don't know enough about what commands and scripts to use to update firmware.\nThanks\n\nA: The panic report you posted in your previous question indicates an unrecoverable error in the IOAcceleratorFamily kext while trying to communicate with the NVDAResman kext.  This indicates a problem with the GPU, probably related to the weird firmware update you applied.  I think you're out of luck at this point.  Only Nvidia has software to downgrade a GPU ROM version, as far as I know.\n\nA: Update from today - I went to Apple Authorized Repair center. They DID manage to run Apple Diagnostics Tests (unlike how others and myself have reported this is not working from Cmd-D) - it showed no errors from top level view. They then tried various boots and installs which all stalled as have mine at home.\nThey also tried to use a ROM update tool (non-public) to update from my 283.0.0.0.0 ROM to latest compatible - I thought this was going to be 285.0.0.0.0 - but when I got home I found that it hadn’t updated from 283.0.0.0.0 :( What I really wanted was to go to back to last known good version before my upgrade - but they said the tool can only upgrade - not downgrade.\nSo no fixes to my startup issues related to Kernel Panics in Windows Server - so a strong suspect is the faulty GPU (even though High Sierra booted with GPU with an older ROM before I upgraded to Mojave)\nI hate the idea of junking the whole iMac because of a SW/HW incompatibility introduced when I upgraded old ROM during failed install of Mojave\nOne of the weirdest things is that the shop also managed to get my internal drives up and running and recognizable by Target Disc Mode - they then erased and set them up as HFS+ drives (128GB and 1TB SSD). \nHowever - when I got home I plugged into my 2018 Airbook with Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 /USB-C Apple adapter - and I still see nothing. I will try with neighbor’s old macbook Air with TB2 and see if that can see them… Why would a new macbook Air with Mojave 10.14.5 not be able to see these drives?\nSo I have a couple of options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the 1TB SSD (and new 2x8GB Kingston HyperX RAM I just\nbought). Could also try to resell the refurbished PSU I just bought\nas well\n\n*Buy a refurbished logic board for $500 and fit myself.\n\n*Hang onto setup and keep hoping there is a SW/Firmware solution that\nsomeone finds in the future.  Meanwhile I could buy a new iMac… I\nreally miss having a ‘family’ computer for photo editing in the\nkitchen which isn’t a noisy slow ancient windows machine (which is\nwhat I replaced the iMac with for the moment)\n\n\n\n\nA: I finally put my iMac together again with new/refurbished logic board. \nI'm an idiot so I managed to bend the CPU and lots of socket pins...(because it's kinda tricky getting heatsink on and connecting plate underneath without thermal paste attaching CPU to heatsink and shifting it out of proper alignment..\nSo this meant no boot - but then tried again unbending stuff - which has been a nightmare... anyway - imagine my surprise when it actually booted early this morning!

I'd now like to install High Sierra on the internal NVME 128GB SSD [no fusion] - leaving the 1TB internal SSD for Applications & Media\nBUT do I need to watch out for either a Security Update or just Boot Rom update as part of installing High Sierra - or just later (or now) with Software Updates?

If you're not sure, you can limit it to 5 photos so you can validate it's getting the ones you want to delete.\nJust be sure you know if your iCloud photo library is tied to the iPhone since deleting a photo will then cascade and delete in the cloud as well.\n\n*\n\n*Delete photos on iPad without affecting photos on iPhone\n\n*Deleting photos off of my iPhone but leave photos in the cloud\n\nA: After spending a few painful hours researching this, I have found the best way is to use the \"Transfer\" app.  In iTunes \"Simple Transfer - Photo+Video\" by Rambax.  It's a paid app, so stop reading if not interested, but I think it's well worth it. I'm not in any way affiliated with them, and did not get anything for this post, and would rather have a free way of doing it, but just could not find a way.\nTransfer app has two main features:\n\n*\n\n*Helps transfer your images between devices or your laptop\n\n*Has a \"Cleaner\" to delete (\"Organize\") photos by date range\n\nSo Just open the app, select Cleaner from the bottom toolbar, Organize Photos, press Select... on the top right and select \"Date Range\".

I’m aware that BSD sed behaves differently from GNU sed with regards to the -i option. However, the usual way of using sed -i '' on macOS ceases to work when using a q command, and I’m wondering whether this is a bug or whether I’m overlooking something in the documentation. In either case, I’d like to know how to restore the expected behaviour for the following simple command:\nprintf foo\\\\nbar > test\nsed -i '' /foo/q test\n\nExpected output:\n$ ls -a\n.    ..   test\n$ cat test\nfoo\n\nActual output:\n$ ls -a\n.            .!79633!test ..           test\n$ cat test\nfoo\nbar\n$ cat .\\!79633\\!test\nfoo\n\nIn other words: the original file is untouched. The result is instead written to a new, hidden file. The numeric value in the filename changes with every execution and looks like a process ID (it’s in the right range, too). Using q without an address gives equivalent behaviour.\n\nA: I’ve found confirmation in the commit history: it’s a bug, which was fixed in r338375 in August 2018.\n", "Q: Slow read performance in Mac OS X terminal, with external encryption enabled hard drive Anyone experienced really slow performance with Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) file systems? I have git LFS project on my hard drive and for some reason even as simple as cd project-folder takes minutes to run (or ls -l command). Any other folder is performing well. It seems there is some kind of issue with combining ecryption, git LFS and external HDD?\nTried searching web, but only finding slowness to download the git LFS files. I don't have issues with that, but only when using basic commands in project folder.\n\nA: No, it is not usual to experience \"really slow performance\" on MacOS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) file systems (also known as HFS+ encrypted). That configuration is extremely widely used, so any intrinsic problems here would have been reported in huge numbers.\nI have been using Git-LFS on such a file system for a very long time, and never experience any such slowness. I know that many of my fellow developers do not have the problem either.\nI.e. this is not a general problem for everyone, but instead seems to be a local problem with your computer.\nI would use regular file system diagnostics to check your file system. Use Disk Utility or fsck on the command line. Also checks your system logs to see if the OS reports any I/O errors or timeouts during these slow performing commands.\nAs you mentioned it is external harddrive, you might also have an interface problem with your cabling or similar. I would try creating new large files (unrelated files) and see if they are also slow.\nAlso check the number of files inside the directory you're cd'ing into to see if it is a very large number - that could also potentially be a cause.\n", "Q: How to check which currency conversions that spotlight supports?

Then 50% charge and power it off.\nThere is no reason to not fully charge and keep attached the latest iPhone and iPad devices that run iOS 11.3 since there are now charge management enhancements to avoid voltage pressure and lack of discharge that can cause issue on older devices and operating systems.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208710\n\niOS includes a charge management feature to maintain battery health when iPad or iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, or iPhone XR is connected to power for prolonged periods of time, such as when used in a kiosk or a point of sales system, or stored in a charge cart.\n\nYour XS is better off to leave plugged in since that reduces charge cycles. Unless you aren't going to use if for a couple months, then discharge or charge to 50% and shut it off:\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/\n\nOlder devices and older operating systems do require you to balance the need to have it charged with the need to delay eventual failure. Every single lithium battery will eventually swell and/or disconnect itself electrically if it doesn't fail some other manner prematurely.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387 - information on chemical aging of batteries\n\n\n*iPad being using in wall mount battery swollen\n\nA: \nI know, sometimes it can explode\n\nTo ensure this to a very high degree (no pun intended) that this doesn't happen, always make sure to use official or certified cables and accessories to charge your iOS device.\nWhile it is true that Lithium-ion batteries age with the number of charge cycles depleted (which as I understand you are trying to cut down on), there are other factors as well that affect battery health, such as extreme temperatures and storage considerations. From the Apple Support document, iPhone Battery and Performance:\n\nA normal battery is designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles when operating under normal conditions.\n\nAdditionally, there are other relevant documents from Apple that includes tips on how you can maximize the lifespan of your iPhone's battery.\n\n\n*\n\n*Charge and monitor the iPhone battery\n\n*Maximizing Battery Life and Lifespan\nIn general, you can leave your iPhone plugged into power and use it, unless the device doesn't heat up, exceeding the recommended temperature range. This could happen due to use of an unofficial/uncertified accessory, presence of a case or using an app which taxes the hardware thereby causing device heat-up.\nAvoid charging or leaving the iPhone in hot environments, including direct sun exposure, for extended periods of time.\nApple also recommends to keep your iPhone updated to the latest available public version of iOS for your iPhone as Apple software updates often include advanced energy-saving technologies.\n\nA: It's actually bad for a battery to retain 100% of its capacity at all times. It will shorten its lifespan. \nI have charged my iPhone 200 times now and still have 100% of my capacity. I charge it from 40 to 80 procent. Which means I've fully charged it like 75 times, but it's still at 100%.

It seems likely that you have copied a command line intended for use on Linux, and tried to use it unmodified on macOS.\nThe specific problem here is that Linux uses \"-w\" to specify timeouts, whereas macOS uses \"-t\". This means that your command line should instead be this:\nping -q -t1 -c1 google.com &>/dev/null && echo online || echo offline\n\n\nA: Your command ping -c 3 www.google.com should have produced 3 internet response packets of the type ICMP ECHO REPLY. The ping command sends ECHO packets using the ICMP protocol, and the responses (if any) are ECHO REPLY packets. The curl command on the other hand, sends HTTP packets using the TCP protocol. Since the latter works and the former doesn't, there is probably something between your machine and www.google.com that blocks the ICMP protocol. A lot of misconfigured firewalls do this, so that is where I would start looking for the cause.\nBlocking ICMP is bad practice since it stops things like Path MTU Discovery from working (MTU = Maximum Transmission Unit size). This stops most traffic from working if the remote MTU is smaller than the local MTU. So it's an extremely bad idea to block ICMP in the firewall.\n", "Q: “System Information” profiles tab I was interested in what the “profiles” tab found in “system information” displays.

As many of us know, one way this port is used is for an iOS device to sync to iTunes over WiFi however, I have never turned this on.  In addition, when I check this setting with the iPhone connected via USB, that feature is unchecked.  \nOtherwise, lockdown may be getting accessed somehow but I have yet to figure out how.\nExploit perhaps???\nOriginal Post\nAs many probably know, it is possible to access\\download iPhone logs to a Mac desktop by using XCode and connecting the device to the desktop via USB.  However, my iPhone is now sending this same data via Wifi and I am unable to (A) figure out why and (B) control it or get it to stop.\nI have sniffed the connection at least a dozen times, scoured the Net, checked the plethora of Apple Discussion pages, etc...all to no avail. In addition, I have triple-verified that the \"Connect via Network\" checkbox in XCode is unchecked.\nHas anyone (1) seen this and then (2) figured out how to control this and\\or get it to stop?\nThanks in advance for any feedback or assistance you may provide.\n\nA: I believe I have found the culprit...iMazing...or rather, iMazing's communicate-to-iOS-device-via-Wifi feature.\nAt some point over the last year or so, I had installed iMazing which, for those who are unaware, is an iOS device management and backup utility.  And as mentioned above, one of their features is communication with iOS devices via WiFi.  When this is enabled, it uses the same lockdown\\usbmuxd application that XCode and others use. \nSIDEBAR: \"usbmuxd\" is a daemon that allows communication to\\from iOS devices via USB\\WiFi and is the underlying transport control-plane for the \"lockdown\" service.\nAnyway, after installing iMazing, I then at some point enabled the WiFi connection feature but later forgot I had done so.  However, when the feature is enabled in iMazing, it doesn't show as such in XCode nor does it always show as enabled in iMazing.  Therefore, it will not always be readily apparent that iMazing is the reason why the usbmuxd channel is open.\nIn any event, I was able to get the iMazing instance of usbmuxd closed and then everything began working as expected.\n\nLast, a little insight as to why this wasn't readily apparent when digging into the OS.  The primary reason is because when looking at all of the elements that relate to usbmuxd & lockdown, there was literally no clue that a 3rd party application had opened up the usbmux channel to the device.  When looking at the IP connections to the device, everything looked exactly as it does when the connection is spawned by XCode's \"Connect via network\" feature.  But again, when checking that feature, it showed as disabled.\nIn the case of iMazing, the only OS level clue that it had opened the usbmuxd channel was an entry in the app's Devices.plist.  The entry in question is labeled \"WiFiConnectionOn\" and has a binary value of \"YES \\ NO\".  \n", "Q: Is running two monitors off a 2017 MacBook Pro 13” too much for the computer to handle? So recently, after about a year of steady use, the onboard graphics on my 2017 MBP 13” failed. The setup I use every day for work is running two 1080p monitors off of the computer. One of the guys at the Apple store said that running two monitors is pretty intensive, and while I understand that, it doesn’t seem probable that it would cause the onboard graphics to outright fail. \nI have the computer sitting flat on my desk, so I’m thinking once it’s repaired to get a stand to help elevate it off the surface and help with ventilation. The computer can and has run pretty hot (fans get real loud), so this is the only thing I can think of to try to stop this from happening again. \nWhen I get the computer back, should i try only running one monitor off of it? Should i sell it/trade it in and get a 15” model that has a dedicated video card? I really want to do anything I can to not have this happen again. \n\nA: No, it’s not too much for the 13 but it does get hot. The 15 churns out even more power in my experience, so I would stick with 13 inch models or the 2018 Air if you want less heat with the current generations of MacBook Pro. \nI would get a stand and not run in closed clamshell mode and also consider a Mac mini and an Air or iPad if you can let your desktop run cooler and not need a MacBook Pro. \n\nWe buy Macs at work to run Adobe products as well. I have about 250 people globally that push their MBP hard all day in closed clamshell mode and we've had a handful of failures like you describe - KP / GPU halts / then need a repair. People that do not have one or someone new to running them without fail say \"these are running too hot\" - all 250 just run hot - especially driving pixels or doing video chat in MS teams for instance. Some even KP / GPU halt occasionally and never need repair (or haven't yet). The repair rate is less than 1% for us even when we push these hard / all day / CPU hot / closed / driving two displays.\n", "Q: Is 65 celsius temperature on a MacBook Pro 2017 okay? My 2017 MacBook Pro 15\" gets really hot when it's connected to an external monitor. The temperature reaches 65 Celcius, and I am wondering if this is considered an okay temperature? If it is not what is the solution for such a problem?\n\n\nA: If you're talking about the CPU temperature, then yes 65°C is okay.\nThe 2017 MacBook Pro 15\" model was available with three different CPU's with processor speeds of 2.8, 2.9, or 3.1 GHz.  \nAll three are rated to 100°C for the maximum temperature allowed at the processor die.\nSee TJUNCTION in the Package Specifications section of the documentation for the Intel Core i7 7700HQ, 7820HQ, and 7920HQ Processors.\n", "Q: Hinge on 2016 MacBook Pro I have a 2016 15\" MacBook Pro and I want to know if it is normal that when I lift the lid, it moves more freely than I expect. \n\n\n*\n\n*In other words, if I gently push the lid without changing the opening angle, the lid moves and returns to its place.\n\n\nPreviously I had a MacBook Air, and this did not happen, that's causing me to worry.\nHere is video showing movement and hinge action for my MacBook Pro\nIs this normal?\n\nA: No that is not normal and either the clutch mechanism has too much play or a mounting screw is loose or something fractured.  \nAlthough Apple changed the way the signal cables connect from the lid to the motherboard radically in the 2016 model, as compared to earlier models, the mechanical hinge mechanism is much the same as previously, and there should be no give in any lateral direction between the lid and the frame. \nAll clutches slip a little, but yours seems overly loose.

The iFixit tear-down for your model shows a caddy that holds both a hard drive and SSD: you'll need to read through it to see whether you're comfortable with taking it all apart -- and more importantly, getting it back together.\nIf you're not comfortable with the task, then you may want to run an external SSD via USB3 or a Thunderbolt dock of some kind. That should still be faster than the internal hard drive.\nI concur with the comment that really, SSDs are cheap enough to buy sufficiently large volumes, making Fusion drives an unnecessary complication. \n\nA: Are you replacing the HDD side of an existing fusion setup? I.e. you already have an apple SSD/NVMe card in the machine already? (E.g. in my Late 2012 iMac 13,2 I had 128GB NVme + 1 TB HDD). If not simple to replace the HDD with SSD for all the speed benefits people have said.\nHowever, if it's already in a fusion setup then you need to decide whether to keep it that way or split / unfuse the drives.\nI replaced my HDD with 1TB SSD, did a High Sierra install to fusion config then upgraded to Mojave and then it all went to hell. Maybe if I unfused first it may have gone better... Good luck!\n", "Q: Apple Remote Desktop Shutdown I am relatively new to Macs and their osascript syntax. I have a mac mini set up as a server and I am trying to use Apple Remote Desktop to send a command to one of the iMac workstations. When I send the command osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to shut down' I get the message execution error: File permission error (-54). I am unsure how to resolve this. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: If you want to run sudo command with ARD select run command as User and written root.\nEdit : It doesn't have to go through the osascript to turn it off.

One question where this is documented is Mojave bootcamp assistant limits partition size. The answer to this question was to use the Disk Utility to create a partition for Windows, then install Windows the same way as any ordinary PC owner. The Boot Camp Assistant was only used to download the Windows Support Software. \nIn your case, I would first make sure all space being consumed by Time Machine is recovered. This can be done by executing the command given below in a Terminal Application Window. Basically, the command tries to reclaim any space taken by Time Machine by asking for a lot of space back.

The options I found are:\n\n*\n\n*You can choose not to download attachments as new emails arrive\nlocally\n\n*You can choose to only retrieve the last 15 months of\nattachments, described as 'recent' in options\n\n*You can permanently\nremove the attachments from all devices, including the server with a\nprominent 'remove attachments' option.\n\nWhat other options do have to accomplish my goal (ideally without having to use 3rd party applications or Terminal)?\n\nA: On Mail.app Version 13.4 (3608.120.23.2.4), MacOS Catalina 10.15.7 (19H524)\nGo to Mail > Preferences > Accounts, and select the account you'd like to avoid downloading attachments from. Under the Account Information tab there is a \"Download Attachments\" dropdown selector. Select \"none\". This may or may not delete already downloaded attachments. If this is a problem, on IMAP accounts you can just delete the account and add back again, with the \"none\" option already selected.\n\nA: Jaime Santa Cruz's answer is good, but there's a step missing..\nAs he said:\nGo to Mail > Preferences > Accounts\nSelect the account from which you'd like to avoid downloading attachments.\nUnder the Account Information, change the \"Download Attachments\" dropdown selector:\n\n*\n\n*\"None\" will not download any attachments\n\n*\"Recent\" will only download attachments in the last 15 months\n\nNeither of these options above will delete any attachments already downloaded!\nTo do so, you need to Rebuild the mailboxes:\nDepending on the macOS version, the Rebuild command will only rebuild the currently selected mailbox (Mojave and older), or all of them (Monterey)\nNote: Rebuilding the mailboxes will re-download some or all of your existing mail, so make sure you have a good connection, and a decent amount of time..During the process, your messages will look like they disappeared, this is normal, don't interrupt the process..\n\nA: Disclaimer: Only to be used if you do not intend to use the email client delivered with OSX.

When you installed Windows the BOOTX64.EFI file was overwritten. The shimx64.efi file usually is a duplicate of the overwritten file.\nSince the boot files for both Windows and Ubuntu are sharing the same EFI partition, the simplest solution would be to install the rEFInd boot manager. There are many ways to install rEFInd. Below are two different ways. Once you have installed rEFInd, you will probably want to edit the refind.conf file to remove duplicate entries.\nInstall rEFInd to the EFI partition.\nThis is the default. You will have to temporarily disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) to install this way. The instructions are given here. To edit the refind.conf file from macOS, you will have to mount the EFI partition. The mount command is given below.\nsudo diskutil mount disk0s1\n\nTo unmount, enter the command given below.\ndiskutil unmount disk0s1\n\nInstall rEFInd to a HFS+ partition.\nYou have to use the Disk Utility application or the diskutil command to create a small \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" formatted partition to hold the rEFInd files. This way does not require you to disable SIP to install. Also, you can select rEFInd as the default directly from the Startup Manager (by holding down the option key on startup). The installation instructions are given here.\nCreate Another EFI partition for Grub.\nAn alternative solution, which does not require rEFInd, involves using the\nDisk Utility application or the diskutil command to create another EFI partition. You can then copy the /EFI/BOOT and /EFI/ubuntu folders to the new partition. Afterwards, you will need to overwrite the /EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI file with the EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi file in this new EFI partition. This solution would allow both Windows and Ubuntu to appear in the Startup Manager. If you use this solution, you should consider changing the label to something other than EFI Boot and using an Ubuntu icon. Basically, you have to adapt steps 5 and 6 of this answer.\n", "Q: Native IKEv2 macOS implementation routes ALL traffic over the VPN tunnel We wanted to upgrade our existing L2TP connections to IKEv2 for connecting to our corporate servers. The problem is as follows:\nWith L2TP, only the assigned IP range is routed through the tunnel, because the option to \"Send all traffic over VP connection\" is disabled and the service order is pretty low.

I use the current Notes app on my iOS devices.  It syncs nicely to my desktop.  However there I prefer to work on text files usually in the command line.\nParticularly I am looking for a way to export notes to a text format and to create or append a note from a text file from the command line.\nIs there any information how to interact with these notes?\nI found two possible ways to interact, but both turned out useless for my case:\n\n*\n\n*In iOS it is possible to create an action that converts notes to markdown.  Unfortunately attachments get converted to links that lead nowhere. My notes contain lots of links from Safari, therefore it is not useful for me. Also wasn't able to find a way to define this action on desktop.\n\n\n*I recalled Notes could also store in email accounts. Tried that. Turns out I can't select this destination from the sharing button. Also despite being HTML in the mail folder formatting text is no longer supported.\nDescription of my workflow\nOn desktop\nI do most coding in vim. This is my preferred way to edit text.\nEach project is managed by git. Usually in each project I have a markdown files in a folder containing ideas and notes to the code. These files I would like to make in some way available in the Notes app.\nI  don't need to have all features of markdown, but some highlighting and inclusion of links would be nice.\nOn Mobile I do most research. I prefer to use the notes app as I can add text snippets and URLs quickly to any notes.  So any app exporting the notes would need to reasonable export them.\nCurrently, I copy and paste between the two formats. This is not very satisfying.  I imagine if I could get some way to import/export to the Notes app I could write scripts that would allow me to sync my local markdown notes.\n\nA: It appears that Notes are stored in a SQLite DB in the folder:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.notes/Data/Library/Notes\nThe sqlite3 command is included with MacOS.\nWho knows what format the notes are in -- I doubt it's markdown -- so you'll probably have to convert between this internal format and markdown. Also, there are other files in the directory that SQLite might or might not maintain and any files in the directory may be accessed at any time by the system daemons that sync things with iCloud. Not sure if SQLite supports file locking directly.\nEDIT:\nYou seem to have found nothing in those folders.

So that would answer the question: it evidently stores notes internally in HTML format.\nEDIT2:\nOK, I only see notes in those tables that correspond to On My Mac notes, not iCloud notes.\n\nA: There's also the mac_apt MacOS Artifact Parsing Tool - It  provdides for extraction of Notes, amoungst many other data types. The authour has also written a blog post on extracting Notes from the Notes DB.\n\nA: There is an application called Note2txt which will convert your notes from the Notes app to text files. One file for each note. It creates a file for all your notes and writes them into a directory of your choice.  It runs pretty quickly taking about 30 seconds for my 700+ Notes.\n\nA: I tried doing this via sqlite and some other ways. Eventually settled on AppleScript. The script below lets you pick one or all Notes folders, and a place to save their notes. Then it puts them there in one big HTML file, with each one a <div> with a bunch of attributes for mod time, id, etc. Attachments become links within lists items of a list placed at the end of the

been able to log in wirelessly from Win7/Airport to a time capsule (TC) that is cabled into my netgear router.  I think the problem is that I had previously, years ago, configured the TC to have an fixed IP, and now (after giving the netgear a new IP during reconfig) that IP is out of range.\nOn launch, Airport find the TC and shows it to have the old IP.  When I click manual setup, the error message -6753 \"An error occurred while trying to access the Apple wireless device. Make sure your network connection is valid and try again.\" \nHow can I login to the TC short of resetting the TC to factory? (and lose its config). \nLong:\nI have a time capsule (TC) plugged into my main router (netgear). I use it as a wifi router and administrate the TC wirelessly under Win7 using the AirPort Utility.  I have the TC configured to only accept connections from a list of MACs.  \nI can no longer login into the time capsule from Win7.\nThis started after I changed the IP address of the netgear router. That caused me to lose all my router settings.  It's reconfigured now. \nThere are a couple odd things. The TC is handling its wifi connected devices (printers etc) properly.  The netgear router is showing them as connected devices, and I can print from a Win7 machine through the TC to a wifi printer.\nYet the netgear router does not show the TC as being connected. And I cannot log in to the TC wirelessly using AirPort.\nI think the problem is that I configured the TC to have an fixed IP, and now (after the netgear reconfig) that IP is out of range.\n\nA: FWIW, this is how I ended up logging in to administrate the time-capsule.  \nI cabled the TC to a laptop using one of the three LAN ports on the TC.  At that point Win7 indicated there was something connected at something like 192.168.1.1, which I suspect is the TC's default IP address.\nUsing that IP and the existing password, I was able to log in to administrate the TC via AirPort > File > Configure Other.\nI suspect that on power-up, TC uses that default IP address until it successfully connects through it's WAN port using DHCP, or in my case, the user-configured fixed IP.\nAnyway, with a successful login via AirPort, I was able to update the fixed IP to one that was in the range of the reconfigured netgear router to which it is WAN cabled.\n", "Q: BootCamp The startup disk does not have enough space to be partitioned I am currently trying to install bootcamp, however i am experiencing the following error: \n\"The startup disk does not have enough space to be partitioned.\" \n\"You must have at least 42GB of free space available.\"\nI have checked my storage and i have 62GB available storage. \nI have checked and my Time machine is switched off and I have also tried sudo tmutil thinlocalsnapshots / 999999999999 in terminal and still not working.\nI would really appreciate if someone can help.\nI am using macOS Mojave. \nThanks\n\nA: The free space required by the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows is larger than what is actually required. One question where this is documented is Mojave bootcamp assistant limits partition size. The answer to this question was to use the Disk Utility to create a partition for Windows, then install Windows the same way as any ordinary PC owner.

I have a pretty old MacBook Air (bought it in 2011), so I'm thinking it's probably to do with the keyboard wearing out. But I'll be watching a video or something and the volume control will run up to the max, as if holding down F11, or run all the way down as if holding down F10. (Since I installed High Sierra, these keys have shifted one over to the right, so F12 and F11 really.)\nI've tried several things: restarting system, cleaning keyboard, etc., setting it up to hold down the Fn key as well as the function key (doesn't change anything), installing updates. Nothing seems to help.\nSo, unless anyone has any other ideas, I'm presuming that the problem is hardware-related. I don't really use the system volume control anyway; prefer to control it from within the video itself. Is there a way to disable it, without disabling the ability to control it from within, say, youtube videos?\n(Edit: I tried resetting the PRAM by holding Option-Command-P-R on reboot after a complete shutdown. The problems haven't reoccurred after some hours of use. I'll post it as an answer if the problem doesn't resurface after I give it a day.)\n\nA: Doesn't appear to be a hardware problem after all. Resetting the NVRAM/PRAM seems to have done the trick. Before doing this, the problem was occurring about every two minutes. I've now run the system for 24 hours without an incident.\nEdit: the problem is back after three days. I would appreciate any ideas.\nEdit: the problem turns out to be traceable to a particular set of earphones. Didn't happen unless they were plugged in. Changed earphones, no recurrence of problem. So, it was indeed a hardware problem, just not with the computer itself.\n", "Q: External HDD with encrypted mac partitions is no longer recognized I have an external disk which I use for data and a TimeMachine backup. For some reason the partition table appears to be broken and I may already have worsened the problem by trying to fix it with testdisk, where I went through EFI/GTP -> analyze -> quick search and tried to restore all partitions, which tells me the structure is bad, so I restored the first two. I'm not sure what EFI System is good for, if activated it is mounted, but that wasn't the case before the problems started.\n\nThe 4TB disk is split into two parts around 2TB each, both standard encrypted macOS partitions.\n\n\n\n\nI already tried to follow HFS+ Partition of Mac OSX is not recognized in Windows 10 Bootcamp but when I try to add the second partition, it says GPT partition #2 does not exist or is too big; skipping.\nThe same happened on another external disk. Both worked fine earlier today/a few days ago. The only change I see is that I used a different cable for one of the disks but not for the other.\nSo now that I have restarted my macbook, the second disk works again, whereas the first does not (presumably because I messed it up).\nI would appreciate if someone can point me to a solution for this. Also I would be interested how this can happen at all.\n\nA: Ok, let us step back for a second here. What OS are you running these commands from, and when was the volume originally partitioned? Although you've not mentioned it, its clear from the screenshots you've posted that (at least, as some point, depending on what you mean by \"restoring\" the first two), your volume was formatted into a Core Storage \"Logical Volume Group\", with at least one Core Storage \"Logical Volume\".\nCoreStorage is a pretty well deprecated technology at this point. It was only really actively used for a brief window by Apple.\nThis more or less necessarily means that \"the 4TB disk is split into two parts around 2TB each, both standard encrypted macOS partitions\" isn't quite true, as there's not really such a thing as a \"standard\" \"encrypted\" macOS partition. There are [J]HFS[+] logical volumes which are encrypted via CoreStorage, although today they're quite rare (10.12+, APFS is preferred, and Time Machine on JHFS+ uses a whole different mechanism using disk images/sparse bundles). None of these, are, unfortunately, close to \"standard\".\nMy first recommendation (and its difficult to say what to do after this, without more information) at this point would to be would be to try to revert the Core Storage LVG into standard JHFS+ partitions, so they're individually recognized on in the GPT partition table. You may have to decrypt the Logical Volumes first. That would be diskutil cs revert [disk5s2 or the LVG UUID], possibly after one or more diskutil cs decryptVolume [diskXsX or LV UUID]  commands.\nAs for restoring disks and volumes, if you wish to retain their structure, your best bet is to use asr — although of course occasionally with dd in combination with /dev/r[diskX] there can still be some milage to be had, I really don't recommend it.\n", "Q: In my ~/Library folder there is Caches folder.

But, if all of the tables are on one sheet, and all of the tables need to get the same new column and the same column title, this will work.\nScreenshot of Numbers document with three tables on the sheet, before running the script.\nScreenshot of Numbers document with three tables on the sheet, with column added and titled\nHere is the AppleScript that adds the column and names it.\ntell application \"Numbers\"\n    set theTables to every table of active sheet of document 1\n    repeat with aTable in theTables\n        set myColumn to add column before column \"B\" of aTable\n        set value of first cell of myColumn to \"Birthplace\"\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nA few notes-- you can add a column \"before\" or \"after.\" Also, you can refer to a column by the letter atop the column, as I did here, but you can also refer to a column by the label in the Header row.

I was able to recover many of the files, but not the names of those files.\nAll of the recovered files have generic names like \"file01010101.doc\", which is not helpful.  In order to know which files are duplicates, I need to compare the recovered files the originals I have on my machine, and have them renamed accordingly.  Then, any files that still have a generic name must be unique and not a duplicate.  \nQuestion:  How do I do this automatically?  Is there a program, bash script, or Automator action that can do duplicate file finding and renaming?  There's almost 500,000 files, so doing this manually is not practical.\n\nA: In this situation, renaming files is not the way to go!\nAs you stated in the OP, \"There's almost 500,000 files, so doing this manually is not practical.\", and as mention in my comment to the OP \"I'd recommend checking out Gemini 2 which you can download a copy for free and run it to see what it finds. If you like the results you can consider purchasing it.\"... But I really didn't clarify why I mentioned an app that detects and deletes duplicates.\n1. Make a new and current Time Machine backup of the e.g. Macintosh HD.\n2. Use e.g., Gemini 2 to delete all duplicates from the recovered files.\nWhat, delete all the duplicates!? ... Yes, with a current Time Machine backup of the e.g., Macintosh HD, why do you need to keep any duplicates!? You don't, as you'd already have properly named duplicates, and modified copies as applicable, of the files on the Macintosh HD on the Time Machine backup. Therefore, does it really make sense to waste time to rename any duplicates of the recovered files? I say No!\nNow the files that remain in the recovered files are unique and you can decide from there how you want to proceed. You'll certainly have a much smaller number of files to decide whether or not you want to keep them, but it will not be an easy task to rename them to a meaningful name, as they are after all unique and do not have a meaningful name.\nThe files that do remain from the recovered files could be broken down into two groups, OS/Apps and User Data, the latter of which has more importance than the former. It should be relatively easy to create the two groups and get rid of the OS/Apps group as most of those files will be older than the current OS and of no real value. The User Data files, some may be files you've deleted from the Macintosh HD over time and the others may be modified copies of the deleted files and  modified copies of the current files prior to the mishap. These are the ones you'll want to retain to search through as needed.\nThe most important thing in this situation is to have a current Time Machine backup of the e.g. Macintosh HD, and isolating unique User Data files within the recovered files, and is really the only point of sifting through the recovered files! Not messing around wasting time renaming files you already have on both the e.g. Macintosh HD and the Time Machine backup.\n\nNote that I am a licensed user of the Gemini 2 app, but have no other affiliation with the developer MacPaw.\n\nA: Here is a solution that I have tested several times and it seems to work.  I'm sure someone with more experience can offer a solution which is much quicker than mine, but so far this is the best I can come up with. \nI strongly suggest making a copy of your \"recovered\" files with generic file naming.  Then I would run the following code on your copied files. \nThis AppleScript code works for me using the latest version of macOS Mojave.\nJust paste this AppleScript code into Script Editor.app and you can run the code from there.\nset genericFolder to (choose folder with prompt \"Choose The Parent Folder Containing The Files To Be Renamed\")\nset sourceFolder to (choose folder with prompt \"Choose The Parent Folder Containing The Files With Proper Names\")\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set genericFiles to files of entire contents of genericFolder as alias list\n    set sourceFiles to files of entire contents of sourceFolder as alias list\nend tell\n\nrepeat with genericFile in genericFiles\n    repeat with sourceFile in sourceFiles\n        try\n            set isIdentical to (last word of (do shell script \"diff -s \" & quoted form of POSIX path of genericFile & \" \" & quoted form of POSIX path of sourceFile) is \"identical\") as boolean\n            if isIdentical is true then\n                tell application \"System Events\" to set name of genericFile to name of sourceFile\n            end if\n        end try\n    end repeat\nend repeat\n\nThis image is the folder and file structure before running the code.  The source files are on the left image and the files to be renamed are on the right image. Take notice that the folder and file structures are different in both images.\n\nThis next image is the result after running the code\n\nThis solution was tested with only 38 files with generic names. On my system it took 1 minute and 33 seconds to process and rename the files accordingly. Without doing any actual math, if you are trying to process 500,000 files with this code, you could be looking at the better part of a full day for the process to complete. You may want to consider breaking the process down to processing a few folders at time, rather than the full mother load all at once.\nHowever, if you are only looking to rename files with the name extension \".doc\" , you can replace this code from above...\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set genericFiles to files of entire contents of genericFolder as alias list\n    set sourceFiles to files of entire contents of sourceFolder as alias list\nend tell\n\nWith this code instead, which will make the process much much quicker.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set genericFiles to ((files of entire contents of genericFolder) whose name extension is \"doc\") as alias list\n    set sourceFiles to ((files of entire contents of sourceFolder) whose name extension is \"doc\") as alias list\nend tell\n\nYou can also have the code process only files with name extensions that you define, as in this following example.\nset nameExtensions to {\"doc\", \"pdf\"}\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set genericFiles to ((files of entire contents of genericFolder) whose name extension is in nameExtensions) as alias list\n    set sourceFiles to ((files of entire contents of sourceFolder) whose name extension is in nameExtensions) as alias list\nend tell\n\n\nA: I would strongly recommend a total backup of all your data before proceeding.  After that, create a new account and play-around from the new account. \n\"Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide\" covers everything with numerous examples. http://www.tldp.org/guides.html It the fist manual listed. Bash is powerful but exacting. \nShould be able to find what you need in the existing code. The code eliminates all duplicate files by moving only one copy of each unique file to a new directory. ( It's been 9 years since I worked on this code.  It deletes things too. ) The existing code creates hashes of all the files in a folder.  It compares the hashes to find duplicates.  You should be able to substitute a rename at this point.  It has code to create a unique name for some reason. The code contains extensive debugging code to create a log of it's doing. Turn on the log and follow what it is doing.  \n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Purpose of this script:\n#\n# Accurately eliminate duplicate files within a given folder.

Instead, we hone in from the left to find the index where the important stuff begins; then hone in from the right to find the index where the important stuff ends.\nThen you can simply retrieve the items between those two indices.\nMethod 2: Text Manipulation\nLess generally, if you know your list contains only simple text items, then you can use text item delimiters to coerce the list into a string and manipulate the string:\nset my text item delimiters to linefeed\n\nset L to {\"1\", \"\", \"\", \"apple\", \"acda\", \"\", \"3454\", \"ImportantStuff\", \"important1\", ¬\n   \"important2\", \"important3\", \"NotImportantStuff\", \"2\", \"\", \"efrg\"}\n\nset textList to L as text\n\nset my text item delimiters to {\"ImportantStuff\", \"NotImportantStuff\"}\n\nset importantStuffText to text item 2 of textList\n\nThe first set of text item delimiters transform the list into a string where each item in the list occupies a single line in the string.  The second set of text item delimiters splits the string at the two places where the keywords are found.  This allows us to retrieve the bits in between, which, as it stands, will return:\n\"\nimportant1\nimportant2\nimportant3\n\"\n\nIf there are multiple occurrences of the keywords, the important stuff will be all the even numbered text items.\nTo change the string back into a list again, you can do this:\nset importantStuffList to paragraphs 2 thru -2 of importantStuffText\n    --> {\"important1\", \"important2\", \"important3\"}\n\n\nA: Manual Filter\nOne approach is to manually filter the list with a repeat loop:\nset theList to {\"1\", \"\", \"\", \"apple\", \"acda\", \"\", \"3454\", \"ImportantStuff\", \"important1\", \"important2\", \"important3\", \"NotImportantStuff\", \"2\", \"\", \"efrg\"}\n\n-- put the filtered items into subList\nset subList to {}\n\n-- note when iterating through important items\nset withinImportant to false\n\n-- examine every item in the list\nrepeat with i from 1 to length of theList\n    set anItem to item i of theList\n\n    -- are we within an important section?\n    if withinImportant then\n\n        -- have we reached the end of the important section?\n        if anItem is \"NotImportantStuff\" then\n            set withinImportant to false\n        else\n            -- append to subList\n            set subList to subList & anItem\n        end if\n\n    else\n\n        -- is this item the start of the important items\n        if anItem is \"ImportantStuff\" then\n            set withinImportant to true\n        end if\n    end if\nend repeat\n\nSee Manipulating Lists of Items and AppleScript “list” examples for more examples of working with lists in AppleScript.\n", "Q: How can I monitor an employee's activity on a remote Mac? I have a remote worker for my project and I am letting him use the Mac with the source code on it. I want to monitor his every activity, if that is possible.\n\nA: If you do not trust the remote worker, do not hire them.\nLegal, not technical\nThis is a legal problem, rather than a technical one. You should agree to a contract with the remote worker stating the limits you desire and how they will be enforced.\nSee Stopping certain data from ever leaving your Mac? for a related question.\n\nA: What you are asking is not a built-in feature of macOS.  Data Loss Prevention (DLP) software and enterprise security monitoring & analytics tools (typically used by a Security Operations Center (SOC) staff.)\nThere are so very many ways to move data on or off a computer that there is no log that watches all of them.  Data can be moved to a remote drive (e.g. USB thumb-drive), across a network via file-sharing (AFS, NFS, SAMBA, etc.) via file transfer protocols (ftp, sftp, scp, rsync), via email, messaging protocols, the web (http), and the list goes on and on.  \nAdditionally, just because an application is run doesn't mean it was used for a nefarious purpose.  Take email for example... while it would be possible to send source code as an attachment to an email message, most of the time that's not why people use email.\nAnd then of course there are limitations of DLP and ways to get around it and what additional measures can be leveraged to protect against those work-arounds and... can you really think of every possible work-around?  You could create an unprivileged account that can't change OS settings and limit the OS so that protocols are either removed/disabled or communications can only work through a corporate gateway, etc.  But in the end... a person can generally circumvent and compromise the security of any machine they are allowed to hold in their hands.\nSensitive data needs to reside in an encrypted repository such that a utility is required to access that data ... and some type of gatekeeper keeps tabs on what data is accessed and by whom.  \nAppropriate security monitoring analytics software has the ability to guess that something suspicious is happening by monitoring normal access patterns and looking for irregularities.  E.g. if a project consists of 50,000 files and there are a 100 developers and the average developer needs to work with 25 files per week (I'm making these values up) ... but suddenly just one of the developers starts accessing thousands of files ... then this deviates strongly against the normal access patterns and generates an alert.  This is just one example to give you an idea of the sort of tools used.\n\nA: Actually, assuming the employee is aware of the monitoring, and it is legal where you live, simple screen sharing will allow this and is built into macOS. It is designed for controlling a remote Mac but would allow you to view the screen(s) without going whole hog into a whole DLP infrastructure.\nApple Remote Desktop will also give you the same viewing ability with added remote control abilities.\nBut do note that viewing another person's computer without their permission or knowledge may be unlawful, depending on the laws where you live. It is important that you consult legal counsel for advice in this matter if you have not done so already.\n", "Q: Temporarily turn off all notifications on iPhone I don't want my iPhone to vibrate, show me banners, etc., when I toggle the desired setting.\nI tried Do Not Disturb but I don't find it solving the intended purpose.\nHow can I turn off all notifications temporarily? Is there some feature that's easy-accessible from Control Centre?\nI want to watch videos online (in Safari) and not get interrupted by notifications during this.\n\nA: There is no single settings/toggle that will let you turn off/on all notifications on your iPhone. The way notification are implemented in iOS, you are limited to configure them on a per app basis only.\nA couple potential solutions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on Do Not Disturb. This will have a side effect of suppressing any regular phone calls.\nMake sure to set Allow Calls From to Everyone under Do Not Disturb settings. This will suppress all the notification banners while you are watching videos/playing games in full screen, while keeping the phone function active.\n\nOnce you have configured Do Not Disturb as above, you can easily toggle the setting via the Control Center icon.\n\n*Turn off Internet connectivity by toggling Wi-Fi/Mobile data from Settings app or Control Centre.\nThe second approach will have a drawback that you won't be able to access the Internet. Also, turning off Internet connectivity won't suppress local notifications.\nHowever, disconnecting from Internet is possibly the best way to temporarily cut-off from the barrage of notification that one receives, while keeping the basic phone functionality (calling + SMS) active.\n\nA: I enabled Settings » Do Not Disturb » Silence » Always and now my phone has completely silenced notifications.\n", "Q: Count pages in a folder full of .doc files I recently found this very helpful link to count the pages in a large folder full of PDF files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Count pages in PDF (for non-technical, mac using person).\n\n\nIt worked like a dream.

(Specifically, the kMDItemNumberOfPages value.)\nIt's up to applications to provide metadata to Spotlight, and MS Word doesn't provide page numbers to Spotlight. \nSo you can't change the script easily, and will need another method.\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut for the System Preferences lock? Is there a keyboard shortcut, or a way to create one, which does the equivalent of clicking the locked lock icon in the bottom left corner of locked System Preferences panes (which brings up the authentication dialogue)?\n\n\nA: While there is no explicit keypress that will take you directly to the Lock icon that I know of, you can hit the Tab key repeatedly to select the tabs and checkboxes in a System Preferences window (I tested with the Security & Privacy window) and end up at the Lock icon, which is then selected.\nNot selected:\n\nSelected:\n\nHit the Space bar, and the lock opens to the credentials login.\n\nYou will need to have System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Full Keyboard Access > All controls radio button selected:\n\nThanks, Nimesh, for pointing out this radio button. I had it enabled, but did not realize it.\n\nA: You could do it using Keyboard Maestro. Sometimes these solutions are a bit janky, but this is simple enough that there shouldn't be issues, like having to add delays and such. Sometimes you have to add delays if you're using it to navigate a GUI and your computer is a bit slow. Like if you are going from one page to another you might have to wait for a bit before clicking, but since the assumption is that you're already looking at the correct window, all you have to do is simulate a click in the right location. A big hurdle with this solution is that if you don't already own it, keyboard maestro is pretty expensive... It has a trial though, so try before you buy.\nYou could do it with a simple automated mouse click. I made a gif to show that it works.\nImportant options:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to restore the mouse location after the click, you can find restore mouse location in the corner menu of the action.\n\n*Make sure the click is relative to the front window's bottom left corner\n\n*You can use the get button to get the right location. When you click it, you have 5 seconds to activate the target window and hover over the target location.\n\n\nSo as long as the current window has the lock in the same bottom left corner, it'll get clicked.\n\n", "Q: Why is iBooks.app taking 650 MB memory on macOS 10.14.5? I am using macOS Mojave 10.14.5. Books.app shows 650 MB memory being used in Activity monitor even when it is not opened. I have books of around 110 MB but I haven't used the app very much recently. \n\n\n*\n\n*I tried opening and quitting the app. And quit the process from activity monitor too. It didn't stop. Then, I had force quit the process from Activity Monitor. It fixed it for some days and now it is back in the same state. \n\n*In the \"Open Files and Ports\" of Activity Monitor, ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iBooksX/Data/Documents/BKLibrary/BKLibrary-1-091020131601.sqlite is an entry along with .sqlite-wal and .sqlite-shm with the same file name.\n\n*I booted into Safe mode and worked for about 30 minutes during which the app didn't appear in Activity Monitor. It came back in normal mode after around 2 days. \n\n*New find is that, when I open iBooks, another PID of the same app is created with around 50 MB. All the further actions like, opening a book, closing it, networking processes etc affect only the newly created PID. Quitting the app kills the newer PID, not the older one.\nWhat is triggering books.app to start and use that much memory? \n\nA: I note that Books is using a similarly small amount of memory on my Mac, too, despite not being launched. So, I'd categorise this as 'normal'. \nMy general approach to memory issues is \"Is this an actual problem?\" \nIf memory pressure is low; and you're not seeing high levels of swap and associated  performance issues: then I'd be tempted to let MacOS do the system management. \nYou could try launching the app, and letting it 'work' for a bit, then quit it, and see if that improves things. There do seem to be a couple of other reports on ASC about Books running wild with memory - the DiskSpaceEfficiency plugin seems to be the culprit. But no solutions given. FWIW, I don't see the behaviour in Catalina. It's likely to be a bug.\n\nA: It seems similar to the questions where processes like accountsd eat up a lot of memory and people change their account settings. \nI had my iCloud for books turned off at the time of the issue. I turned it on in System Preferences → iCloud → iCloud Drive Options. \nNow whether it stays off, or on, there is no stray iBooks process eating up the memory. \n", "Q: How to change the default VNC client? I have a VNC Viewer installed. Is it possible to make it the default VNC client?\nI would like to get rid of the built-in Screen Sharing app and automatically open VNC Viewer whenever I type\nopen vnc://server:port\n\nin Terminal.\n\nA: Try the RCDefaultApp preference pane at http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/. It lets you choose the application to be launched for all sorts of situations.\nInstall it, open it (it becomes the \"Default Apps\" preference pane), and then choose the \"URLs\" tab:\n\nScroll down to the \"vnc\" prefix, and then choose what you like from the \"Default Application\" popup.\n\nA: You could unload the screensharing service (and thus remove the need to install software):\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist\nand start it again by:\nsudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist\nAlternatively, you could create an alias (a custom command) by adding a line into your .bashrc file (an explanation of the difference between .bashrc and .bash_profile on OSX is here: What is the difference between .bash_profile and .bashrc?)\nThe alias line may look like:\nalias myvnc='vncviewer server:port' (whatever the executable and paramter required to start the program)\nSave .bashrc and exit. Then type source ~/.bashrc in the terminal to reload the file to test your new alias. In this case, typing myvnc will trigger the command you have entered between the two quotes.\nThis can be used for anything to start things quickly via terminal with your own preferences.\n", "Q: Importing CDA song files into iTunes I have a mac without a disc drive on it, I also have some CDA files on my computer that need to be interpreted into an audio format that is more compatible with modern music programs so that I'm actually able to use them \n\niTunes is an amazing program to do this with, but it's not letting me import the files into it.\nI've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Double-clicking on the files\n\n*Right-clicking on the files and choosing iTunes to open them with\n\n*Dragging and dropping the files into iTunes (Even though I was pretty sure that wouldn't work because of the way drag and drop works)\n\n*Importing the CDA files into Audacity\n\n\nAlso, I'm having some trouble finding another converter online, and since I love the simple design of iTunes, I would much rather prefer to convert the files on there.\n\nA: CDA files are not song files, it's just a shortcut.\nIt doesn't contain any song information, so you can't convert it to other formats.\nYou need to import cd into a usable format using iTunes on the computer that owns the disc drive.\n=======\nNote that macOS sees them as \"exec\" files just because it does not recognize the file type and does not know what else to do with it.\n", "Q: Blocked websites on Safari I was using a public WiFi spot at the airport and noticed that certain websites on Safari were being blocked. I was able to go to these websites when I used my own data, but I have limited data so is there a way to bypass this?\n\nA: Public WiFi hotspots, especially free ones, tend to block certain sites just to limit bandwidth usage or potential liability issues. Workaround number one you have already found: use your own cellular data, which is not always an ideal situation.\n\n\n*VPN software is sometimes a good solution to this depending on if the public WiFi allows VPN connections. If it does you can get one that supports iOS (I use TorGuard but there are hundreds of others) and use that to bypass the limitations of some public WiFi hotspots.\n\n\nNote: depending on what you are trying to do online that WiFi hotspot might see you sending and receiving large amounts of data (Netflix, YouTube, etc.) and block your MAC address and you are, again locked out of that particular WiFi hotspot.\n\nA: The best way is to use a vpn. Because, this is due to the rules of the wifi firewall.\n", "Q: Mac mini 2018 hdmi white noise I have 2018 mac mini, just bought it a few days ago, running OS X Mojave. And I have 2 monitors connected to it, 1 through usb-c and 1 through HDMI.\nWhenever I wake my computer up from sleep, the monitor connected through usb-c wakes up instantly, but the other one takes a while to wake up. Like I could already be using the left screen and the right one is still black.\nI tried plugging a different display to this HDMI port and it's the same story, the monitor takes like 1 minute to start displaying the picture, after I wake my computer from sleep, but, this other monitor instead of just being a black screen displays white noise and then wakes up.\nWhat could be the problem?\n\nA: There are lots of reports of monitor problems with the 2018 Mini: so many that it seems unlikely to be anything other than a problem with the hardware itself (or specific firmware/software to that model).\nI myself see the same problem: white noise on the HDMI-connected monitor after Sleep.\nUsing 2 TB/USB-c ports rather than one TB/USB-C and one HDMI may be a factor, rather than the cable itself.\nIt's unknown at this stage whether Apple may be able to fix it (with enough bug reports) in a software update, or whether it's a permanent hardware issue.\n", "Q: External Monitor not detected after upgrade to Mojave 10.14.5 I have a MacBook Air 13-inch, 2018. I updated the software to Mojave 10.14.5 and the laptop has stopped recognizing the external monitor after the update. Is there a way out of this mess?\n\nA: I've hit the same wall with both my old and new Mac Minis when I upgraded to 10.14.5 this week. They're both ok with the HDMI cable to the monitor (so at least one is useable), but don't play nice with the HDMI/VGA adaptor/cable that I've also used to enable a second feed to the screen. \nScreen sharing between them is the only workaround, and I note this an issue with Mojave that pre-dates 10.14.5 (such as here https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8625812 and here https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/no-signal-on-external-displays-after-mojave-update-2018.2128056/).\n\nA: If you are using a non-apple adapter, the solution is to use an official apple adapter/dongle.\nI have always used a monoprice mini display to VGA and always worked, when I did a clean install of Mojave, the monitor did not get any signal from my MBP\nI confirmed that both the adapter and monitor are working by plugging in another computer.\nSo, I borrowed an official apple dongle from a friend to test and it worked.\nThis is clearly something that was done via software maybe to push us to buy dongles from apple.\n", "Q: Safari: kCFErrorDomainCFNetwork error 1 on local (HTML) files I keep a lot of local HTML files on my machine, including my home page.  Whenever I first open Safari, and often when going to any local file, I will receive an error.  Hitting refresh (or, for the home page, the home button again) fixes the problem... until the next time you try to go anywhere.\nUsually opening a link in a new tab prevents this from occurring; opening a link in the same tab almost always sees the error.\nI realize \"wait for Apple to get around to fixing it\" is a valid answer; I also realize \"use a different browser\" is a valid answer.  I'm hoping, instead, for a setting change I can make, or HTML tag I can add to my metric badger-load of files, to prevent this error without swapping browsers or waiting for an update (since it's already been happening for quite some time).\nThe error:\n\nSafari Can't Open the Page\nSafari can't open the page.  The error is \"The operation couldn't be completed.\n(kCFErrorDomainCFNetwork error 1.)\" (kCFErrorDomainCFNetwork:1)\n\nSome potentially useful information:\nmacOS Mojave Version 10.14.4  (On a desktop, if that matters.)\nSafari Version 12.1 (14607.1.40.1.4)\n\nA: I was having the same issue. However, I also use Microsoft Edge and at some point, Edge asked me for permission and it worked again, though in Safari it didn't.\nSo I compared permissions and found out Edge got some permissions Safari never asked for. Giving Safari the permission \"Full disk access\" within System Preferences > Security and Privacy > Privacy tab> Full Disk Access , click the '+' to Add Software, then locate Safari to add to the list. This solved the issue for me.\n\nA: I was having the same issue with my homepage which is stored locally on my mac. Putting the HTML files in the Applications folder seemed to solve the problem.\nI know it's not the best solution but at least I don't get an error anymore when opening a new tab.\n", "Q: Chrome in full screen weird behavior when pressing option + command + M If I have a Chrome window in full screen and press \"option + command + M\", my screen goes blank, opening a new blank chrome window. Is this some kind of chrome bug?\nDemo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWi-1GF-4OU\n\nA: Yeah it's a visual bug. Option + Command + M is a shortcut to minimise all the windows of the frontmost app to the Dock.\nHowever, you should not be able to minimise windows which have been put in full screen mode. Most apps will simply not respond to the minimise shortcut if they are in full screen, but Chrome will go black.\nYou can restore the windows by clicking on the Chrome tab in the Dock.\n", "Q: unable to create partition on free space using disk utility Running 10.13.4 on a MBP with 750GB SSD.\nThe problem\ni started with a single APFS container that spanned the whole 750GB of the internal SSD disk. Only half of it was in use so i decided to free the unused half and use it to create an additional APFS container (for reasons, please see below). I ran the diskutil resizecontainer command to free the space and that succeeded. I then ran disk utility guy and selected the whole disk and then partition. This shows the free space and the existing APFS container. I was hoping that when i click on the free space i would be able to partition it and go from there but the add functionality (+ sign) is greyed out as are the partition information details. Why is that? Is there a way to regain access to this free space and assign it to a new partition without zapping the whole disk and starting again? Pictures below.\nWhy I want to create extra APFS partitions. \nI see lots of admonitions to only create one APFS container as APFS is designed to share space and volumes will grow and shrink and you don't have to worry, etc. But i also see that 'your startup disk is filling up' is quite a common occurrence after a while. Seems to me that the solution to that is to ring fence the space that your startup disk is sitting on so that the rest of the disk can fill up without any risk to the system. I have no control over the creation of the 'Macintosh HD' volume (or the other 3 volumes that are created at install) and it seems that once an APFS volume has been created there is no way to resize it.The best I can hope for is to resize the container of the startup disk and use the free space to create an additional APFS container which will then house the user data.\nThanks in advance.\ndiskutil apfs list before i started\n\ndiskutil list before i started\n\ndiskutil list after resizecontainer shrinkage\n\nDisk Utility GUI showing free space and + button as well as Name, Format and Size fields greyed out\n\n\nA: Both the Disk Utility application and diskutil command do not allow free space to be converted to a new partition. Instead, you are suppose to create new partitions by splitting an existing partition.\nSo first of all, enter the command given below to reclaim the free space to the existing APFS partition.\ndiskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 0\n\nOpen the Disk Utility application and highlight the container disk1, then click on the Partition button. You should get an image similar to what is shown below. \n\nNext, click on the Partition button in the popup window. You should get an image similar to what is shown below.\n\nClick on the +button, then enter a name. I chose Macintosh HD 2. Make sure the format is APFS and the size is 350 GB. The result should be an image similar to what is shown below.\n\nNext, click on the Apply button.

The iPhone Drive app was failing to display bar.txt which IS on cloud (I added it yesterday), but instead was still displaying a foo.pdf file that longer exists on the cloud (which was showing up even before I asked the question), and bizarrely clicking on foo.pdf actually shows the contents of bar.txt.\nReinstalling the Drive App resolves this.\nEDIT: I can recreate the problem as follows:\n - On my MacBook I copy X.txt to ~/google-drive\n - Observe that the cloud icon in the tray does sync animation\n - Observe that X.txt does not appear on Drive app\n - Drive App -> Search drive for X.txt\n - Now it is visible  \n", "Q: How to merge 2 partitions on macOS I have an MBP running macOS High Sierra.

Because of well document bug where mouse starts jumping in uncontrollable fashion with the only solution being to disable the trackpad and use mouse, I've had that option checked for a while. But after an upgrade to Mojave, even when the option is checked the trackpad still reacts and the mouse is jumpy, which makes the computer mostly unusable (most apps don't have a very fluid shortcut keys support). \nBottom line: any suggestion to disable the trackpad, permanently and forever, on Mojave, not only when a mouse is detected would be amazing! :)\n", "Q: StraightTalk Wifi Calling with ATT iPhone 6 If you have experience with using an ATT iPhone on the StraightTalk, please state which iPhone + IOS version you have tested with StraightTalk.  If there were any changes required to the ATT iPhone configuration: the steps required to reproduce wifi calling would be of interest. \nCan I expect wifi calling on the StraighTalk network to work with a SIM unlocked ATT iPhone 6?  \n\nA: Here is their compatibility page:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.straighttalkbyop.com/\nThey say any unlocked GSM phone works, so the only problem with an iPhone from AT&T service would be a carrier lock.

If I draft an email message in emacs and then cut-and-paste it to the gmail web app, the text looks fine. Only plain text gets copied.\nBut if I use iOS Notes to draft the message on an iPhone (what else do you use to draft?) and then cut-and-paste the message to the gmail iOS app (you agree it's more convenient then using the gmail web app on an iPhone, no?), then some kind of rich-text gets copied, with the result of sending text in a much larger font.\nHow do I cut-and-paste plain text from Notes to another iOS app?\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*The problem apparently occurs for those using Notes to draft on macOS.\n\n*Someone sought the opposite (pasting rich-text). I'm not sure why that was not the default for them.\n\n\nA: To get rid of the formatting, copy the data to a coding app like iEditor from iEditor copy the data and paste to where you need it. \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ieditor-text-code-editor/id562162723?mt=8\nTo avoid the double copy, work in iEditor. I do this all the time on macOS. \nCopy and paste involves how the \"copy\" app and the \"paste\" app handling the text. The copy app may make several formats of the data available. One format must be a styled version. Another will likely be a text only version.  The \"paste\" app is free to select any of the formats. \nWhat I do on macos, when the \"copy\" app is passing formatted data that I do not want, is to copy the data to a coding editor.  The coding edit will pick the data form without any styling information.  You end up with plan text.  I then copy and paste into the destination app. \n", "Q: Mac OS Mojave Terminal Resetting to Default Theme I've recently worked out how to change my terminal theme and set the new theme as default through the GUI menu: Terminal > Preferences > Profiles > Default.

Others have asked about setting a default or it not working on multiple windows/tabs, but that isn't the issue here. \nIs there a config file where I can change the theme manually?\nAny suggestions will be very much welcomed!\nWorking on a 2017 MacBook Pro 15\" (MacOS Mojave)\n\nA: Setting the default profile does not mean that it will launch with the new window on startup. You need to set that in the General preference on startup, open: New window with profile: [YourProfile]\n\nis there a config file where I can change the theme manually?\n\nYes, you can edit the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist in XCode (it's a binary plist file so while you can view the file in a text editor you don't want to save it as ASCII text).\nYou may actually want to delete this file though. After deleting it, when you launch Terminal it should be recreated with all the system defaults. That way they are there. You may have gone overboard with deleting everything.\n", "Q: How do I download the free Swift Programming Language book (Swift 5 Edition) from the Apple Books Store?

I am thinking about getting an Apple Watch. One of the most interesting features is Auto Unlocking of Mac. Does Apple Watch auto unlock need network and two-factor authentication?\nThe AirDrop function says it needs open Wi-Fi. I used to think that it needs a network. Later I found that two devices need not be connected to a common access point for AirDrop to work. So I think network isn't necessary.\nAnother problem is the Two-factor authentication. Is it necessary? My password is very secure and I don't want to enable this feature. Apple's help page says Make sure that your Apple ID is using two-factor authentication instead of two-step verification. I don't understand what this sentence means. Should Two-factor authentication be turned on or must not use two-step verification?\n\nA: \nDoes Apple Watch auto unlock need network and two-factor authentication?\n\nTo use Apple Watch Auto Unlock feature, you need to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on both your Apple Watch and Mac. It is similar to AirDrop, the radios must be turned on for the feature to work.\nAlso, your account must have Two-factor authentication turned on. Having Two-factor authentication enabled provides an extra layer of protection and doesn't compromise your Apple ID in any way.\n\nMy password is very secure and I don't want to enable this feature.\n\nIt doesn't matter howsoever strong password you use, once someone else gets hold of it (which could happen accidentally), they have complete access to your Apple ID account. Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by having the user to obtain and enter an additional, randomly generated code.\nTwo-factor authentication is more advanced than two-setp verification. Apple highly recommends protecting your account with Two-factor authentication, so much so that if you use it at-least for a couple weeks, you couldn't turn it off.\nFor more details refer to the linked Apple Support articles:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to unlock your Mac with your Apple Watch\n\n*System requirements for Continuity on Mac, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Apple Watch\n\n*Availability of two-factor authentication for Apple ID\n\n*Switch from two-step verification to two-factor authentication\n", "Q: Applescript to get MS Word current word count?

Is there any way in Mac that I can discover when and how I delete this file, like this file was deleted by an app or something? Does the Console app keep a log of it?\nThanks\n\nA: No. The filesystem doesn’t directly or indirectly to the console have a journal or log of changes in files or folders or permissions. \nThere are some tools to do that, but none ship enabled or configured with the os. \nTime Machine is the way to find when the file was last present and it’s searchable from spotlight. \nI would set that up now or connect and get a current backup before you do any troubleshooting so if you need to erase the drive or repair it, your other files are covered at least now and going forward. \n", "Q: Security issue on blocked screen in High Sierra? I can see my powerpoint presentation (opened in fullscreen) on locked screen on my iMac! (mac os 10.13.6)\nworse than that I can see it when I'm playing video, see photos in Photo app or open launchpad...\nHow I can fix it?\n\n\nA: Your picture shows \"burn in\" or \"image persistence\" where the physics of the liquid crystal elements that are held at one voltage level for a period of time tend to not relax entirely when that voltage changes.\nThis affects the polarization of the backlight and you will see ghost images.\nShort term, you can reduce the backlight level so that it's not letting as much light through, but long term you can use a screen saver or just select a higher cost display that shows less of this inherent characteristic.\nOther display technologies have similar effects, but they can be more permanent with CRT tubes or OLED displays. LCD generally recover over time, but can be permanently marked and need to be recycled or used in less discerning uses once they are used past the design life.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_persistence\n\nImage persistence can be reversed by allowing the liquid crystals to return to their relaxed state. In other words, turning off the monitor for a sufficiently long period of time (a few hours or maybe days) will relax the crystals and eliminate image retention. For most minor cases, simply continuing to use the computer as usual (and thus allowing other colours to \"cover\" the affected regions) or turning off the monitor for the night is more than enough.\n\n", "Q: Why are my Touch Bar volume controls grayed out (disabled)?

This is supported by both monitors.\nWhen you pick 1920x1080 Lightning, in actual fact a 3840 x 2160 resolution signal is generated and sent to the monitor. This consists of the ordinary image, you're used to see - but magnified with a factor of 4 so it looks like 1920x1080 in physical size when rendered. \nOne of the notable exceptions is though that the text is actually rendered in the higher resolution with a higer font size, so it has the same physical size, but is \"prettier\" (i.e. less blurry/jagged).\nYou only get the Lightning choice with the Samsung monitor as it is the only of the two that supports a 4k (3840 x 2160) resolution.\n", "Q: A WD hard drive can be detected by one Macbook but not another A WD My Passport hard drive (bought in 2016-7) can be detected by one Macbook (a 2018 15\" MacBook Pro) but not another (not even in diskutil) (a 2013 11\" Macbook Air). What is the explanation for this? Has it got to do with something along the lines of differences in design in the motherboard (eg. different voltage ranges for logic levels)\n\nA: The common cause of a bus powered drive not operating is the computer isn’t getting enough power through the cable you are using to power the unit. \n\n\n*\n\n*USB external hard drive is mounted on one MacBook Pro but not another\n\n*External hard drive not recognised by MacBook Pro.\n\n*USB Hard drive has very small chance of being recognized by Macbook Pro each time it is connected, but works with other machines\nSwapping cables or using a powered hub or getting a new enclosure can help triage and isolate why this happens in many cases.

That often delays a device from mounting, but you should see it in diskutil immediately which doesn’t match your case here. \n", "Q: Apple Script Time interval I used a great script from CJK with no issue , but not sure what happen, recently I noticed some invalid result :\nstartDate = \"2019-05-31\" (US Format)\nThen converted to \"31-05-2019\"\nMyDate (now) = 01-06-2019\nResult 31 days \n    set creationDate to \"2019-05-31\"\n    set [YearValCreation, MonthValCreation, dayValCreation] to the words of creationDate\n    tell (current date) to set startDate to dayValCreation & \"-\" & MonthValCreation & \"-\" & YearValCreation --->>> \"31-05-2019\"\n\n    set MyDate to short date string of (current date) --->>> \"01/06/2019\"\n    set [dayVal, MonthVal, YearVal] to the words of MyDate\n    tell (current date) to set MyDate to dayVal & \"-\" & MonthVal & \"-\" & YearVal ---->>>> \"01-06-2019\"\n    set DateText to \"\"\n    on timeInterval from startDate to endDate by units : 1\n        tell (current date) to set [startDate, ¬\n            day, [day, its month, year]] to ¬\n            [it, 1, words of startDate]\n\n        tell (current date) to set [endDate, ¬\n            day, [day, its month, year]] to ¬\n            [it, 1, words of endDate]\n\n        (endDate - startDate) / units\n    end timeInterval\n\n    set dayResult to timeInterval from startDate to MyDate by days\n    set dayResult to (round (dayResult * 1)) / 1 as integer\n--->>> 31\n\nJust release  if  the date is 30-05-2019 instead of 31-05-2019 I have a correct result\n\nA: It's because you are supplying dates in the format dd-mm-yyyy, where you need to be supplying them in the format yyyy-mm-dd.

Continue holding until you see the Apple logo. Startup is complete when you see an utilities window similar to what is shown below.\n\nOnce boot to macOS Recovery, you can select to open a Terminal window from the menu bar.\nIf you can not boot to macOS Recovery and can boot Windows, then you can download and use GPT fdisk to print the contents of the GPT and MBR partition tables. After downloading and extracting, you will need to enter the command gdisk64 \\\\.\\PhysicalDrive0 from an \"Administrator: Command Prompt\" window. To print the tables, enter the following when prompted by gdisk64.\nr\np\no\nq\n\nAfter posting the content of these tables to your question, I would hopefully be able to advise on the next step.\nUpdate:\nHere are instructions for using gdisk under Windows to fix the MBR partition table.\nStart by entering the command gdisk64 \\\\.\\PhysicalDrive0 in an \"Administrator: Command Prompt\" window. Here, I assume the current directory in the window contains the gdisk64.exe file downloaded from gptfdisk at SourceForge.\nBelow are the commands to enter in to gdisk.\nR\nH\n2 7\nY\nAF\nN\n07\nY\nN\nW\nY\n\nBelow is sample output. Note: Your output might vary slightly from what is shown below.\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.4\n\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: hybrid\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: present\n\nFound valid GPT with hybrid MBR; using GPT.\n\nCommand (? for help): R\n\nRecovery/transformation command (? for help): H\n\nWARNING!

The computer should now use the new\npartition table.\nThe operation has completed successfully.\n\n\nNote: If you get macOS to boot, but Windows fails to boot, then you will need to rebuild your Windows BCD file.\n\n", "Q: Mac selects files instead of dragging them When you click on unselected file and start moving it up to start dragging, mac os selects sibling files instead of dragging.\n\nA: If you start dragging in white space near to files, mac os will select the files. If you start dragging with cursor above the files it actually drags them.\n\n", "Q: Is there a command line interface to Keychain's / the system Password Assistant utility? \nWhen creating keychain records, changing your user password, and various other security-minded aspects of the system, there is a little key icon you can click on that opens the above Password Assistant utility. It is a very simple utility that has a small handful of Password types;\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Memorable\" (pictured)\n\n*Letters & Numbers\n\n*Numbers Only\n\n*Random\n\n*FIPS-181 compliant\n\n\nThen you choose a password length, and it gives you a random password, whose dropdown can be expanded for other suggestions matching your requirements.\nThis utility is straight-forward, and incredibly helpful, ESPECIALLY the 'Memorable' generator type. Is there a means of directly invoking the Password Assistant alone, either via the command line alone, or a command line command that launches the assistant, then returns the selected password on the command line?\nThe \"cleanest\" way I've found so far is to open Keychain Access.app, ⌘n, then click the Key icon to open the Assistant dialog. However, the mouse-centric nature of this is a nuisance to me when I just want to generate a password.\nThis does not appear to exist under the security Keychain command line utility as far as I can discern from its man page, any place where you would create an entry using security it prompts you for a password.\nI've never seen any other generator that creates a pleasant 'Memorable' mix as this utility does, and I'd like to delegate to it's capabilities directly from any integrable aspect of MacOS systems.\n\nA: The \"Memorable\" password generation option appears to be gone in MacOS Catalina, there is now only;\n\n\n*\n\n*Manual\n\n*Letters & Numbers\n\n*Numbers Only\n\n*Random\n\n*FIPS-181 compliant\n\n\nThe security command line tool doesn't seem to generate passwords, it will only accept one you define. If there's another command line tool for password generation built into the OS that re-uses the above options, I don't know about it.\nGiven the combination of both of those factors, I'm documenting and accepting this answer as closure.\n", "Q: Toggle caps lock programmatically using applescript I'm looking to toogle capslock programmatically using applescript. Here is something I tried to make it work. It seems to work for all other keys except capslock.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    key code 57\nend tell\n\n57 is the key code for caps lock\n\nA: Submitting a separate answer, as it is entirely distinct from my first in that it solves the issue at hand.  Credit goes to @user3439894 who pointed the OP and I to a link (Toggle caps lock programmatically) that features some source code written in C that can programmatically toggle/set the state of the caps lock.  Thus credit goes also to the original author of that code, for which I offer a translation into JavaScript for Automation (JXA), which is the JavaScript flavour of AppleScript.\nThis script toggles the state of caps lock upon each run:\nObjC.import(\"IOKit\");\nObjC.import(\"CoreServices\");\n\n\n(() => {\n    var ioConnect = Ref();\n    var state = Ref();\n\n    $.IOServiceOpen(\n        $.IOServiceGetMatchingService(\n            $.kIOMasterPortDefault,\n            $.IOServiceMatching(\n                $.kIOHIDSystemClass\n            )\n        ),\n        $.mach_task_self_,\n        $.kIOHIDParamConnectType,\n        ioConnect\n    );\n    $.IOHIDGetModifierLockState(ioConnect, $.kIOHIDCapsLockState, state);\n    $.IOHIDSetModifierLockState(ioConnect, $.kIOHIDCapsLockState, !state[0]);\n    $.IOServiceClose(ioConnect);\n})();\n\nThis, like any AppleScript, can be run from within Script Editor (choose the language option in the navigation bar at the top of the window).  Sadly, Script Debugger doesn't cater for JXA.  But, in practice, the script will be most usefully executed by way of some other automation software, such as Automator, Keyboard Maestro, Alfred, etc., all of which can execute JXA scripts directly; and any software that doesn't provide this option can execute it by way of the shell command osascript:\nosascript -l JavaScript /path/to/script.jxa.applescript\n\nYou can use an .applescript or .scpt file extension to save the script.\n\nA: Though not exactly the same thing, a similar action might be to simulate the shift key being held down.  You can command System Events to keep the shift key down until you command it to be reset:\ntell application \"System Events\" to key down shift\n\nTo reset:\ntell application \"System Events\" to key up shift\n\nIt has obvious differences to activating caps lock, which are worth a footnote.\n\n\nWARNING: It can be humorous then quickly annoying to execute the first command and lose the ability to, for example, input any digit (which can only be done if the shift key is up).  The action of the shift key will affect mouse clicks, shortcuts, and so on.  To illustrate, if you typically run a script by pressing ⌘R, this will not be possible while the shift key is active, as the system will register ⇧⌘R (thankfully, ⇧+⟨click⟩ on menu items appears to perform the same action as a simple click).\n", "Q: Best way to transfer files between iPhone and Windows PC Is there a software in Windows that will make file transfer between an iPhone and PC easier? I have tried iMazing. It's kinda great, but the problem is that when I am transferring files from my Windows PC  to iPhone, (videos to be precise), it doesn't transfer all the files that I need. I suspect it's the format.\n\nA: The software you should be looking for is iTunes, specifically iTunes for Windows. You can download iTunes for Windows via:\n\n\n*\n\n*direct download from Apple's website using this link.\n\n*Microsoft Store using this link.\nIf you wish to transfer and playback unsupported videos files on your iPhone, install VLC for Mobile on your iPhone and use iTunes File Sharing feature to easily transfer video files to your iPhone.\nFor detailed instructions regarding file sharing, refer to the Apple Support Article:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use iTunes to share files between your computer and your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.\n\n", "Q: Replacing Touch ID/Home button on an iPhone 7 My iPhone 7 Touch ID broke after submerging it underwater because of swimming with friends, but I just want to ask if possible, can the Touch ID (or Home button) be returned to life if I bring it to the Apple Service Center?\nI tried searching iFixit, but it says that the Touch ID on an iPhone 7 cannot be fixed once and for all because theres some kind of one-to-one binding between the device and the Touch ID. I'm not sure, but if the Touch ID cannot be retrieved anymore, I'm thinking that if the clickable Touch ID in iPhone 6s can be used as a replacement for the Home button in iPhone 7. Will it work?\n\nA: \ncan the Touch ID (or Home button) be returned to life if I bring it to the Apple Service Center?\n\nYes, you can take your iPhone to any Apple authorised service centre to get the Touch ID/Home button replaced.\n\nTouch ID on an iPhone 7 cannot be fixed once and for all because theres some kind of one-to-one binding between the device and the Touch ID.\n\nTouch ID is bound to the secure enclave built into iPhone (a security chip). Thus, if the Home button with integrated Touch ID (iPhone 5s and later) in an iPhone is replaced by an un-authorized/3rd party service provider, the Touch ID doesn't function. This is by design and is meant for keeping the security of data on your iPhone intact.\n\nI'm thinking that if the clickable Touch ID in iPhone 6s can be used as a replacement for the Home button in iPhone 7. Will it work?\n\nNo, you cannot use an iPhone 6s Touch ID/Home button with an iPhone 7. They are vastly different both in technology and working mechanism. (Home button in an iPhone 7 doesn't mechanically press, but instead give feedback via heptics.)\n", "Q: Mail app opens randomly in MacOS 10.14.5 I have mail app open in background i.e. no window open. A new window randomly pops up without any conscious trigger by me. No new mail would have come. \nOnce it happened while I was in full screen mode of another app and the mail app split the window in half and got opened. This happens even when I am working in non Full-screen mode.\nI presume that it has connection with notifications but other reasons are also welcome. \nOnce, it popped up above other apps, and some accounts were transitioning from offline to online state. I cannot confirm  about Google account as one answer mentions. \nWhy might this happen but more importantly, how to stop this other than quitting it properly? I want to stop it from opening it altogether, not only in split view.\n\nThe answer to Mail opens a window randomly in split screen with my fullscreen window recommends to untick a Mail preference. Unfortunately I get the behaviour even thought the preference is unticked, so I look for other solutions.\n\nA: This was happening to me for a while, and it became very annoying. I found that if I force closed it and turned the laptop off and on, it worked. If that continues to happen, turn off the WIFI connection and do the same steps. \nAs to stop the behaviour in split mode, unchecking the checkbox in mail preferences for \"Prefer split view while opening messages in full screen view\" helps.\n\nA: I have been suffering from this problem for months. I tried so many solutions (for example https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/7d81ak/solution_for_those_who_have_the_mail_app_randomly/ ) and so on.\nThis really irritates when I am watching a movie in fullscreen and the Mail app pops up randomly and splits the screen.\nPossible workarounds:\n- Turn off desktop notifications as suggested by @Casimir\n- Turn off the split window of Mail when full screen (Prevent Mail.app from opening in split view)\nIn the end, nothing worked for me.\nTemporary workarounds:\n- Keep Mail app opening and make the window very small all the time.\n- Open multiple windows and keep Mail window open in one of the windows.\n- Also, If you can hide Mail.App by Cmd H or click on Mail at top left of you desktop, click Hide menu.\nI suspect this bug is due to mail.app checking new emails periodically and each time wanting to be fullscreen. I have also added my vote on apple service and still waiting for a permanent solution.\nUpdate\nAs suggested in comments by OP hiding the Mail.app (cmd h) is also an alternative, but still, we have to open the app all the time whenever we are running the computer so as not to be offended by intermittent apperance of Mail.app.\n\nA: I've been experiencing this issue for a week now. The mail app pops up by itself in split view next to my full-screen browser several times a day. It hasn't happened in over a day now after following the steps in this reddit post according to which the culprit may be Google calendar. If you're using it, try changing the notification settings as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login to Google Calendar at https://calendar.google.com.\n\n*Click the settings gear icon (upper right-hand corner) and select “Settings” from the drop-down menu.\n\n*Under the \"General\" tab (open by default), scroll down to \"Event settings\".\n\n*Open the \"Notifications\" drop-down and switch from \"Desktop notifications\" to \"Off\" (\"Alerts\" might work as well).\n\n\nA: If you have any services or other apps that send or receive e-mail on your Mac through the Mail.app, the latter may be opened every time the service tries to send an e-mail, even if you quit Mail.app (CMD + Q).\nSeeing that no other solution fixed your problem, I guess depending on what you are doing, this might bring unexpected windows into the foreground or make you lose keyboard focus and could explain the issue. If that is the case, disabling such apps/services or changing the mailing type to direct (using smtp url, username and password rather than Mail.app) could fix the issue.\nOne example of such app is the DriveDX HDD monitoring tool, which offers the option to send you an e-mail with status updates (for example, imminent drive failure). If you choose to send it through your Mail account, the Mail app will be opened whenever the app tries to send you e-mail.\n\nA: Its not a setting in notification. Its in app preference.\nOpen mail->Preference or open mail and press short cut key (Command+,).\nUncheck below option. Hope it works.\n\n", "Q: Prevent Mac from sleeping when lid closed on Mojave / Catalina So I saw a lots of old discussion on this topic, but I'm trying to find out an actual solution that still works on Mojave / Catalina, without the use of external monitor/keyboard/mouse/with power adapter.\nWhen looking up Amphetamine, they claimed that you can only do it when the 4 criteria are met, and cannot overridden it.\n \nBut on the other hands, Anti Sleep provide the feature in their pro version...\n \nSo, which one gets the real deal ?

Press Ctrl+C to quit it and restore normal sleep behavior. (Cmd+Q to quit the Terminal works as well.)\nThe -i option stops your system from going to sleep after a period of idleness, and -s is to stop it from sleeping when the lid is closed. (See also this answer.)\nNote that keeping the system awake with the lid closed only works while you're connected to AC power. If you disconnect your charger, the Mac will sleep immediately. By my testing (on a 2021 M1 MacBook Air), if you reconnect the charger later, it will automatically wake up the Mac again, even without opening the lid.\nSee man caffeinate for more options.\n\nA: Adding on to CJ's answer, you can create a shell script to automatically manage pmset enabling and disabling sleep.\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/270835/408131\n#!/bin/bash\n#***************************************************************************\n#*** noz - prevent laptop from sleeping when lid is closed\n#***************************************************************************\n\n#***** set some defaults *****\nBATTERY_SLEEP=5 # in minutes\nDEF_WAKE_LEN=300 # in seconds\n\n#***** determine timeout value *****\ntimeout_len=${1:-$DEF_WAKE_LEN}\n\nfunction prevent_sleep() {\n    echo\n    echo -n \"Preventing sleep for $timeout_len seconds; press <enter> to continue...\"\n\n    sudo pmset -b disablesleep 1\n    sudo pmset -b sleep 0\n}\n\nfunction enable_sleep() {\n    # $1: <enter> = 0, timeout = 1, Ctrl-C = undef\n\n    #----- insert a newline for timeout or Ctrl-C -----\n    if [[ ${1:-1} -eq 1 ]]; then    echo; fi\n    echo \"Restoring previous battery sleep setting: $BATTERY_SLEEP\"\n\n    sudo pmset -b disablesleep 0\n    sudo pmset -b sleep $BATTERY_SLEEP\n\n    #----- sleep on timeout only -----\n    if [[ ${1:--1} -eq 1 ]]; then   sudo pmset sleepnow; fi\n    exit\n}\n\n#***** prevent it from sleeping *****\nprevent_sleep\n\n#***** trap Ctrl-C *****\ntrap enable_sleep INT\n\n#***** wait for an enter *****\nread -t $timeout_len\nrc=$?\n\n#***** re-enable normal sleep *****\nenable_sleep $rc\n\nThe shell script will disable sleeping until you hit the Enter key, at which point it will re-enable the sleep settings (alternately, you can hit Ctrl-C and achieve the same thing). It will also set a timeout (defaults to 300 seconds/5 minutes) after which the sleep settings will automatically be re-enabled, and the laptop will be forced to go to sleep. While this would be a pain if you're using your laptop in a meeting, it will be a lifesaver if you forgot and put your laptop in your bag to go home.\nAstute readers will note that these commands require sudo; sadly, that's unavoidable AFAIK. What I've done on my system is to make it so that I don't have to enter my password to run pmset as root. To do that, edit the sudoers file (sudo visudo) and add this line:\nYOURUSERNAME ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pmset\n\nreplacing \"YOURUSERNAME\" with your username. You could probably achieve the same result (i.e. running the script without having to enter your password) by running the shell script SETUID, but I don't like doing that; opening up this one command via sudoers seems less risky to me.\nTo run the script, stick it in a directory on your PATH and invoke it as such:\nnoz [<timeout in seconds>]\n\nWhen you get to where you're going, simply hit Enter or Ctrl-C and you're good to go. And if you forget about it, it will automatically reset and sleep.\nYou can also set up an Automator Quick Action, tell it to execute noz, and bind it to a hotkey.\n", "Q: MacBook applications say \"no photos\" but they are on the iPhone I recently took photos and videos and am now unable to import photos over USB. Image Capture shows the iPhone without any photos, Photos says \"No Photos\". Image Capture was working fine until I went on a filming spree (48 photos and two 2-minute videos). I am also unable to move a video to the trash: the thumbnail disappears from the list, then the \"Cancel\" button freezes and has no effect, the video does not appear in the trash, and when I go back to \"All photos\" another video is selected. I can take new photos on the device but they are not saved to memory.\nUnlike this thread, both devices are up to date: iOS 9.3.5 and macOS Mojave 10.14.5.\nThe same thing happened to a friend who had so many photos that the device complained of lack of space. My storage says 5 GB used and 7 GB available.\nHow can I transfer the photos and videos from the device?\n\nA: Turning it off and on again\nThe first and easiest solution was to restart the iOS device (I found this while trying the second solution). Then both Image Capture and Photos were able to see and download the photos and videos, although Image Capture gave an error 50:\n\nI needed to restart the device to import a few remaining photos. Image Capture is still unable to delete photos from the device after multiple attempts: a gray box says \"Deleting...\" and it hangs. I am now backing up the data, restoring the firmware, and restoring the data.\nUsing the cloud\nI set up iCloud on the iOS device and on the computer to share photos: Settings > iCloud > Sign in, then when asked for an iCloud passcode I entered the lock screen code (hint from discussions.apple.com, and I also had to enter the login password of the computer.\nThe media did not sync immediately, so I went into the iOS Photos application and realized it had hung, so I restarted the device and then Image Capture started working again. Nevertheless, iCloud photos did not sync the photos from the device.\nOther alternatives are the Dropbox and Google Drive apps on iOS. Because I got the photos from the first solution above, I did not try these.\nUpdate (September 2020): After one year of syncing photos with Image Capture and deleting them manually, I have toggled the delete behavior back to normal with some unknown reason. Now when I sync photos, they are deleted from the device. It may be due to the same problem, which caused the behavior again and toggled the problem back to normal. What I did this time was to unplug the cable during transfer of videos, then no photo would transfer and I was unable to delete photos on the device and a new photo would have the button \"All photos\" greyed out (even though I still had those videos), I restarted the device and now it is working again.\n\nA: In the past when I have had that problem, I would disconnect the USB, restart both the phone and the client system, then reconnect the phone.  Make sure you are logged on to your phone and it is open before you make the connection.  When it asks if you want to share the content of your phone with the system you just connected to, be sure to answer yes.\n", "Q: Why is my iOS Development Certificate Team ID different from my real Team ID? When I create an iOS Development Certificate using Xcode or the manual CSR process, the Team ID is something like (for e.g.) EK1H65HGFB, whereas my Team ID according to the Apple website is actually ECTE57HE5G. Creating a Distribution Certificate in Xcode works just fine and produces a certificate with a correct Team ID.\nThis discrepancy causes provisioning profiles to break because they expect a Development Certificate with my real Team ID.\nWhy does this happen and how can I fix this? Is this a problem with my Xcode configuration? (I have removed all it's settings and reinstalled it though.)\n\nA: I've since had communication with the Apple Developer Program Support and they've sent me an email clarifying the team IDs.\nThis is what they wrote:\n\nPlease note that I can confirm that the ID assigned to the IOS Development Certificate is a random one and is not the Team ID, therefore it is expected behavior. The ID assigned to the IOS Distribution Certificate would match the TID.\n\nIt seems the TeamID of the Development Certificate is in fact random.

It claims my Documents folder is 170GB in size as you can see here:\n\nBut checking via Finder, the folder is only 8GB in size:\n\nNot sure what's going on here.  In case it's relevant, my Documents folder is also synced to my Google Drive via Google Backup & Sync.  Does Google maybe store \"versions\" hidden somewhere or something on my drive?  I've enabled invisible items and nothing significant showed up in the Documents folder, so I'm stumped.  Not sure if the 170GB number is even real or not.\n\nA: Documents in the System Information pane doesn't mean files in the Documents directory.\nIt means files that are not other, already defined media types - ie. not photos, books, movies, etc. This would normally encompass the sort of files you'd put in your Documents folder, but they don't have to be kept in there to be part of that total.\nIf you actually click into Documents on that System Info screen, and then hit the File Browser button up top you'll be able to see what directories are using up the space.\nPersonally, I do see it's finding a large (40Gb) amount of space used in Library, which is often where things like Google cache data.

Then reinstall MacOS from there.  \nIf you still get a 'server can not be contacted', others have reported that this can be due to a time mismatch, and to try to update the local time on the laptop by typing this into Terminal:\n\nntpdate -u time.apple.com\n\nThen try the reinstall command again.\nOthers report that resetting the Hosts file helps, however, if you followed the above there is no hosts file, aside from what is in hidden boot partition, which is not likely to have been edited.\n", "Q: Using an iMac as a display for PC laptop in dual mointor configuration My goal is to have two large monitors for my PC laptop without having to purchase new monitors. My current setup is a late 2013 27” iMac with a 27” Thunderbolt Display. For work I was given a Lenovo T480 which has a Thunderbolt 3 port on it.\nI want to know if I’ll be able to use my iMac in Target Display Mode as one Monitor, plus my Thunderbolt Display as the second monitor? I can use the Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter from the laptop to the iMac, but will it recognize the Thunderbolt Display as the second one? It’s about $100 of cables and adapters to try this so I wanted to ask first.\nAnyone tried this?\n\nA: The iMac will connect to a Thunderbolt port. (But no other.) Also, you can't 'daisy-chain' the iMac in Target Display mode to another monitor. \nAnd the TB Display also can't be daisy-chained, but it can connect to other video ports. So you'll need to use another video out port on the Lenovo, with all the necessary adaptors to get it to the TB's connector.\n", "Q: Where to find the service manual for Early 2008 Mac Pro 2008 (A1186)?

I installed VirtualBox on my new Mac mini, running macOS Mojave, and it randomly crashes the computer (sometimes it does, other times it doesn't).\nThe last time it crashed such that both my monitors (that are plugged into the Mac mini through USB-C to HDMI adapters) were not working. I spent close to 2 hours trying to figure out what happened. I was sure it was something internal, and not the USB-C ports, because I was able to open recovery (by pressing and holding Command + R during boot) and see what's being displayed, but I wouldn't see anything when I'd normally turn on my computer.\nAfter 2 hours of trying different things, I plugged one of my screens into HDMI (instead of USB-C) and saw the password screen, logged in, and the USB-C ports started working again.\nCan someone explain what is going on here? I started to think that this was the computer trolling me. I never had these problems on either Windows or Linux.\n\nA: This is commonly due to bugs in VirtualBox.\nVirtualBox installs itself as a kernel extension directly into the lowest level of kernel software running on your Mac affecting stability of the system as a whole. This is why you need to enter an administrative user’s password in order to install VirtualBox.\nTo fix this, ensure that you have the latest software versions of VirtualBox, add-on packs and macOS installed. Double-check your virtual machine configuration for configuration errors (especially if you’re using PCIe pass-through or similar).\nIf this doesn’t solve your problem, I will advise using a different virtualization system such as VMware Fusion or Parallels Desktop.\n\nA: Random crashes have happened to me several times after upgrading from VirtualBox 5.2 to 6.0.

I will let you research those terms if you need to, as it's beyond the remit of this answer.  I almost never use a property for either of those features I just mentioned.  Rather, I use them most often to separate storage of values that I generally intend to remain constant throughout the script (as opposed to variables that can be expected to change at any stage).  AppleScript doesn't have a way to declare constants like other languages, so this is just a bastardisation of another construct.\nHandlers\nHandlers in AppleScript can be thought of to be what other languages refer to as a function, and the actual differences are nuanced and mostly academic, with one practical implication being that handlers aren't self-aware so can't report any information about themselves back to you.  But, like functions, they receive arguments (or parameters), do something with them, and spit out a result at the end in most cases.\n\n\n*\n\n*filterCharacters: this is the core of the script in terms of where the heavy lifting is done.  It receives a single piece of text you wish to be filtered, and a list of allowed characters, and removes everything else, i.e. it extracts occurrences of allowed characters in the order they occur.  It does this by utilising AppleScript's text item delimiters, which you should read about more thoroughly, but essentially deletes all instances of delimiters in the list you supply it, splitting the string into fragments at the points of deletion.  So, it's almost performing the opposite function that we want, and can be thought of being a text filter that you supply a list of illegals rather than a list of allowables.  Therefore, I use them twice: first to strip out the allowables, leaving only the illegals; then giving that list of illegals back to text item delimiters, which then get stripped from the original piece of text, thus leaving us only with allowables.  Very efficient; avoids iterating through characters in the piece of text.\n\n*processedNumericalString(): This handler is just a cheap and lazy way to strip off the leading zeroes once the first handler has given us a string containing only digits.  It would be arguably more correct to iterate through each digit character until reaching the first non-zero character, deleting the ones that are, with a special case to prevent \"0\" being obliterated.  But, instead, I just decided to coerce the string to a number, then back to a string.  A hack that works effectively and one assumes more speedily too (though that's not definitive).\nThe main body of the script\nWith the two handlers defined at the bottom of the script, all that remains is to iterate through the list of strings, sending each string in turn to each handler.  What comes back is the piece of text you desire, which set the contents of... is what lets me replace the original item in the list with the new version.  I was mindful not to retain empty strings (\"\"), and the processedNumericalString() handler swaps those out for an AppleScript object called missing value that represents exactly what it says (it's the closest pre-defined AppleScript object to what other languages often call null or nil).  Anyway, the important this is it isn't a string, because the final line of the script's run is:\nreturn the strings in L\n\nand this does exactly that: any item in the list that is not a string (or text) class of object is discarded.  You can, of course, swap this line for:\nset myVar to the strings in L\n\nif you need it assigned to a variable in order to keep using it.\n\nADDENDUM\nThe OP added:\n\nThe list I described as myVar in the original post is always changing over time, I want the process of taking the items in myVar and isolating all the numbers to repeat indefinitely\n\nOK.  Let's bung the main part of the script into another handler:\nto formNumericalStringsWithItems from L as list\n    local L\n\n    repeat with textItem in L\n        set stringOfDigits to filterCharacters from textItem thru digits\n        set numericalString to the processedNumericalString(stringOfDigits)\n\n        set the contents of the textItem to the numericalString\n    end repeat\n\n    return the strings in L\nend formNumericalStringsWithItems\n\nPlace this with the other handlers to keep it separate and out of the way now.  The main body of the script is reduced to these two lines, where I've used the identifier myVar instead of L just for clarity:\nset myVar to {\"abc\", \"qwerty.24\", \"01 abc23xyz\", \"123abc456\", \"2.1abc\", \"20\"}\nset myNewAndImprovedVar to formNumericalStringsWithItems from myVar\n\nNow, wherever myVar in your script gets updated/changed, you follow it with a call to this new handler, as I've illustrated here.\nJust be clear about how I've delineated the different \"parts\" of the script: keep the property declarations at the top—don't put them inside your repeat loop; also don't put the handler declarations inside the repeat loop—I put all of mine at the bottom of the script, where I've marked a line and headed a section only for handlers.  The \"main body\" of the script (despite now only being two lines here) is what your code will occupy, so keep things neat and grouped (it's why I separate the property declarations from the main body by two paragraph breaks instead of just one).\n", "Q: spotlight search for folder within finder I hit cmd-shift-g for go to folder, but I have to type the full path\nIs there some way for me to search a folder name and go straight there?\nLike how automjump/z etc. work in the terminal\n\nA: Yep, just search for what you want in the top right of the finder window. As long as you are not in gallery view mode, have your mac updated to the latest version, and have made sure the application is searching the whole mac, it should show a section called folders. There, it will show all of the folders that match your search.\n\n", "Q: Password settings do not appear! At random times Apple Mail rejects the current stored passwords for my gmail accounts.  When I go into Preferences>Accounts>Server Settings, the windows that are supposed to appear to change or update the passwords for incoming and outgoing mail simply are not there!!!\nHow do I update or change the passwords, then, in Apple Mail so that I can have my emails appear properly, as they do when there is no password issue being created by the site itself?\nI found this unanswered question at discussions.apple.com: The link for the apple.com post\nThe link for the tigertech post that gives detailed instructions in fixing password issues\n\nA screen shot of the tigertech post that shows what the Preferences>Accounts>Server Settings window is supposed to display\n\n\nA: Welcome to Apple.SE JONAllow. What you're seeing in the mail app is the expected behaviour of the mail app. Both of the screenshot are of two different conditions i.e. Gmail and Company account. \nGmail doesn't allow server settings to be changed via Mail.app Preferences pane. While, accounts such as of an institute of study or work have to be configured in server settings via said pane.\nSo to change passwords, I suggest going to Mac Preferences -> Internet Accounts,   select the said account, click \"-\" in the bottom. And add it back. \nIMAP mailbox will not pose any problem restoring all mails. It might take time though. \nOne unverified alternative is that you see the sidebar in the mail and find a \n\nerror sign. Tap on it and see if it gives other options like \"Try again\" and hope for a password reset prompt. You might see \"System Preferences want to use google.com\". Allow it.\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: What can I, as a user, do about offensive reviews in App Store? While browsing iOS App Store, I happened upon an app review filled with an antisemitic rant (the reviewer was complaining about the impact of micro transactions on the game by calling developers “greedy Jews”). The review is older than a year, so, if the developer ever reads reviews, they already saw it, so I doubt me writing another review notifying the developer would have any effect. Anyway I don’t know whether developers can remove reviews they don’t like.\nMy main question is, can I, being a user and not a developer, somehow notify Apple to take down that review?\n\nA: There is a direct way of reporting these concerns, although Apple does not make it obvious how to do it, unfortunately.\nGo to the review in question and press & hold (long press) on it, and you will see this pop-up:\n\nTap on \"Report a Concern\" and it will bring up this window:\n\n\"It contains offensive material\" seems like an appropriate choice.\nYou will be given a text box to explain why you think it is offensive.\nCan't say that anything will actually happen with it, but I'd wager it's the best chance you have of getting someone's attention.\n\nA: Since Apple runs the store, contacting the developer is an indirect way to get it looked at. The main thing as a user you can do is not look at reviews or sites you feel don't match your sensibilities.\nUse the contact us link if you’ve purchased the app as there is no direct web link to report a violation of terms. Apple has a pretty strict version of what it allows in official metadata, but user posts need to have a little more lattitude IMO - just like we do here moderating.\nThings you express your individuality in your profile or when you clearly state in an answer your opinion or experience is harder to \"police\" than the content of a question. The official app and the official post can be held to a higher standard of civility while balancing the need to tolerate different views and language expressions - what's normal, what's a valid criticism and what's a mean spirited dig or worse, trolling or inflammatory post just to provoke a reaction as opposed to convey how software is experienced.\nIf you are not a customer of Apple selling you that app, you would need to use the general feedback mechanism. \nUnless the slander or offensive conduct is worth legal action, you probably won’t get a good response from Apple legal, but if there is a violation of law in your jurisdiction, then Apple legal has an email address for legal processes. \nOnce you’ve sent feedback including screen shots and a short summary of why you feel aggrieved by Apple hosting a review on their store front, maybe contact Apple Support to be sure a human knows you had this issue and confirm you reported it to the correct group / advocate. \nhttps://support.apple.com/apps\n", "Q: NVRAM Showing Questionable Payload Variables...

The two that are active and the one that is inactive have the same email address gchung@me.com. Also, I cannot get rid of the Game Center account, which is also under gchung@me.com. I'm not sure what's going on here...\n(edit: I've updated the images)\n\n\n\nI'm inclined to leave things alone since everything seems to be working fine, but it is a little bit disconcerting.\n\nA: That's very unusual, perhaps you have two separate Apple ID accounts (and thus iCloud accounts). You can check this by clicking on each one and see what email address is listed on the right. Perhaps macOS allows you to login to the same iCloud account twice.. \nSee if the checkmarks for what services are checked. If Mail is checked, see if you have multiple email accounts set up in the sidebar of your Mail application. If you don't but the mail checkmark is ticked on both accounts, it is pretty likely you can delete the duplicate account. \nIn theory, if they are the same account there would be no harm in deleting one of them by selecting one and clicking the delete \"-\" button at the bottom of that window. Although, I'm pretty sure some wise guy once said that if something works - don't touch it. Let me know how you go. \n\nA: I don't have two iCloud accounts on my computer. You must be signed into iCloud with two different Apple IDs or have signed in with the same Apple ID twice.

If not, which carriers will support cellular Apple Watch.\nAs I understand it, the eSIM inside the watch is not removable and copies the SIM info from the iPhone.\n\nA: \ncan I purchase a SIM unlocked watch and expect it to work with any of the carriers?\n\nNo, you cannot expect it to work with just any carrier. \nApple Watch comes in different regional models that supports different frequency bands (this goes for both the Apple Watch 3 and Apple Watch 4). These models are for the Americas, China and Europa/Asia/Pacific.\nTherefore you cannot expect the model used in North America to work in Europe.\nIn addition to that, you cannot expect it to work with any carrier even within the region. The carrier has to specifically support eSIM for Apple Watch. In the Netherlands none of the providers support eSIM, so you cannot buy a subscription for an Apple Watch there.\nCombined with the fact that the Watch subscriptions generally do not support roaming in other countries - you cannot get an Apple Watch working with cell support in the Netherlands today.\n\nAs I understand it, the eSIM inside the watch is not removable and copies the SIM info from the iPhone.\n\nIt is not removable in the sense that it is not a physical thing. It is just information stored in digital format.\nIt does not copy the SIM card inside the iPhone if that is what you mean, no. The eSIM is a separate SIM from the one in the iPhone. The process of setting it up however means that the information for the eSIM is retrieved from your provider on your iPhone and sent to the Apple Watch. It is not stored on the iPhone.\n", "Q: Apple Watch eSIM configuration When the Apple Watch eSIM is configured:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can the eSIM be reconfigured if I replace the SIM card (same carrier)?\n\n*Is the eSIM locked to a carrier?\nThe cited article is unclear and I hope that someone with experience configuring watches could comment.\n\nA: \nCan the eSIM be reconfigured if I switch carriers?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the eSIM locked to a carrier?\n\nNo.\n", "Q: Time Machine Backup: separate configurations for different drives?

But before completing a 6 GB download, is this going to give me the option to install 10.15 beta on a separate partition or is this going to blindly update my existing 10.14 installation?\n\nA: Yes, you can have a dual boot of your current macOS and macOS Catalina on a single Mac (without need for external SSD). \nPre-requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Access to macOS Catalina\n\n*Compatible Mac computer\n\n*APFS-formatted disk\n\n*At least 20GB of free space (if you want to play with Xcode 11 beta, be prepared to have about 50GB to spare)\n\n\nHow-to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"Disk Utility\" app\n\n*Make sure your main volume is selected on the side panel\n\n*Choose \"Edit ➔ Add APFS Volume...\" from app's menu\n\n*\"Add APFS Volume to container\" popup should appear\n\n*Name the new volume as you like (eg. \"Catalina\") and choose \"APFS\" format\n\n*You can reserve the size for the new volume if you want (\"Size options...\" button), but you don't have to. By default, the new volume will share available space with your current volume.\n\n*Download macOS Catalina installer (it should start automatically after downloaded)\n\n*Choose newly created volume as an installation target\n\n*Proceed with installation\n\n\nYour Mac will restart several times and boot into fresh, new macOS Catalina installation. You will be able to choose the system on boot, just press and hold Option (⌥) key immediately after switching your Mac on. You can also change which system will boot automatically in \"System Preferences ➔ Startup Disk\".\nAdditionally, If you are using FileVault to encrypt your disk, macOS Catalina won't have access to your current macOS installation and all files you are storing with it until you provide the passphrase for FileVault. If you don't do this, you will keep your current files in isolation from the beta OS, which I recommend.\nI am using the above setup to dual-boot macOS Mojave and Catalina without any issues on MacBook Pro 15\", late 2016. \nPlease, remember to make a full backup of your system in advance - just in case.\n\nA: Your existing installation won't be blindly updated. The macOS 10.15 Catalina beta installer will launch as soon as it is downloaded.\nYou can create a bootable USB installer by plugging in a USB flash drive and running the following in Terminal:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ 10.15\\ Beta.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/DRIVE\n\nwhere DRIVE in the name of your external USB drive\nYou can choose to install macOS Catalina on an external drive, if you don't wish to interfere with your current installation.\n\nA: Good news. After the 10.15 beta download completes, the installer starts and after accepting the license, you are shown a screen where you can select where to install the OS. It defaults to the current disk containing 10.14 but there is a \"Show Disks\" button. Clicking it brings up a list of all other partitions attached to the computer. Many will be grayed out. The drive/partition you wish to choose must be formatted using APFS in order to be selectable as an option.\nIn my case I was able to install 10.15 beta to an external USB hard drive once I formatted it with APFS.\nNaturally I made a full Time Machine backup and another full cloned backup to yet another external backup drive before running the beta OS. Be safe with beta OSes.\n", "Q: Send message button missing from Mail app's compose window I have an older iMac running macOS High Sierra. I use the Apple's Mail app version 11.5 for handling my emails. Something has changed in my system recently such that the Send message button has gone missing from the compose window toolbar. The compose window used to have a Send message icon for me to send my messages.

After I close it, the icon remains in the Dock and I have to right click and remove it. I don't move the icon in the Dock and I don't touch the Dock at all in this process.\nNote that I am very aware that applications may be on the dock unless they are fully closed. In this case, not only is the app closed but the Activity Monitor does not list the process running.\nStaying in the Dock also happens with other applications after I start them, but not all applications. Skype opened itself on reboot and after closing that application, it remained in the Dock. I also verified it is not listed in Activity Monitor. I removed the option to launch Skype on start and that one won't spin up each time, thankfully. But if I launch Skype manually it has the same behavior, it will place itself persistently into the Dock after it is closed.\nHow does an application put itself in the Dock? Is there a way to turn that off? Is it a setting?\n\nA: macOS Mojave introduced a feature to show recently launched app's icons in the Dock, even after quitting the app. To a new user of macOS, even if they have been using earlier releases of macOS for a while, this may give an impression that either the app is still running, or the icon got persistently added to the Dock. To disable Dock from displaying recently launched app icons in the Dock, go to System Preferences app → Dock and uncheck Show recent applications in Dock. This setting is enabled by default in macOS Mojave.\n\n\nWhile this was not the reason in this particular case, some other reasons this may happen are discussed below:\nA macOS app is generally (well in majority of cases) programmed to show it's icon in the Dock when it's launched. (There's an exception to this general rule, an app can be programmed to run and show their icon only in the Menu bar).\nUnlike other desktop operating systems, a macOS app generally doesn't quit when you click on the close button (shown in red below):\n \nClicking the close button generally close the app window and doesn't necessarily quit the app. The app keeps running. (I said generally, because some app are programmed to quit when the close button is clicked).\nThe way to quit an app completely is either to use Menu bar command App Name → Quit App Name, or to use the universal keyboard shortcut Command + Q. This will always quit the app and remove it's icon from the Dock (if the icon wasn't present in the Dock before app was launched, and you haven't enabled Keep in Dock from the app's Dock icon's context menu).\nIf an app icon is not present in the Dock before it is launched, it doesn't automatically gets added to the Dock when the app is run.\nAnother possible scenario where the app icon remains in the Dock happens when you have manually rearrange it in the Dock. Once an app icon is moved to a new location in Dock, the Keep in Dock option in the Dock icon's context menu gets checked. This is by design.\nAs far as automatic launch of iTunes is concerned when an iPhone (or any other iOS device) is connected to your Mac, you can turn this off. Launch iTunes and open iTunes preferences by using Menu bar command iTunes → Preferences... or using keyboard shortcut Command + ,, go to Devices tab and check Prevent iPods, iPhones and iPads from syncing automatically.\n\n\nA: Normally, icons do not remain in the Dock when they have been quit, unless you have Control- or Right-clicked and chosen that option. Note that on the Mac, an application can still be running even if all its windows are closed. Select Quit from the applications menu or press Command-Q to quit.\nHowever, if you rearrange the app into a spot that is different from the default position, MacOS will assume that you want the app to remain in the Dock even when Quit. \n", "Q: Hard drive ignores available free space I have a 500 GB SSD. At one point, it had 2 partitions--one for my regular macOS boot (430 GB), and one for developer previews (~70 GB).

At only 350 cycles and 2 years.\n\nA: The battery status of Poor indicates that something isn’t lining up in how the measurement circuit sees the voltage profile change.\nThe mAh are all estimates / derived / statistical numbers and the only thing the system can really measure directly are voltage - current in - current out and estimated wattage of the CPU. When those 4 values are not aligned or our of what the “model” predicts - you get a Poor / Check Battery / Replace Battery status.\nIf I didn’t see the “poor” I would say you probably are fine. Also, if you get no charge when there should be charge - examine the pins and cords and cables that are external and then seek service. Make sure you have a great backup in case you can’t turn on the Mac again. Also, once you’re backed up, you might reset the SMC one time (or once every 3 months) if you haven’t recently. The SMC measures and integrates the voltage / time measurements to derive the mAh so it can get stuck and need a restart on occasion or when you see something amiss like you see now.\nIf none of these work, there's a hardware failure that could be a cable disconnected or a part or two that need to be swapped.\n\nA: There is probably a dead cell / pack that disables the battery. Since it’s a balanced setup you are going to have to replace it. Be sure to check the case for swelling\n", "Q: Is there a way to prevent SIGKILL after SIGTERM for a daemon\\agent during shutdown\\restart? i have a daemon that must be finished gracefully. It should have CUSTOM amount of time before system sends SIGKILL and kills it. \nIs there a possibility to do such thing on MAC? \n\nA: No - this isn't the decision idiom on macOS so your development requirements are conflicting with the system design intention.\nYour daemon should be dealing with this and timing and technical ways to do this are built in to MacOS as well as documented fairly well by Apple.\nmacOS does not shutdown daemons by just sending a SIGKILL it first sends a SIGTERM and then only if the process is still there a SIGKILL. You have some control to delay this by using the disableSuddenTermination method on NSProcessInfo see  https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsprocessinfo/1412841-disablesuddentermination?language=objc\nThus your daemon should be shutting down on receipt of a SIGTERM and so the SIGKILL will have no effect.\nThis was documented in Apple's The Life Cycle of a Daemon\nIt is also the normal BSD and Linux way of shutdown except that launchd is not involved.\n\nA: Yes, this is definitely possible.\nIf you start your service properly via launchd, you can define the amount of time you need for stopping the service with the \"ExitTimeOut\" key in the launchd plist for your service. If you set \"ExitTimeOut\" to for example 300, this means your service have 300 seconds (5 minutes) to do something in between receiving SIGTERM and actually being killed by receiving the SIGKILL signal.\nAnother possibility is to redefine the shutdown sequence as such. This is a more \"hacky\" solution, but if this is intended only for your own Mac, it could be the easiest.\nA way to do this is simply to replace /sbin/shutdown with a program of your own liking. An idea is to move the original /sbin/shutdown program to for example /sbin/shutdown.apple and then add a simple shell-script in its place.\nThe shell script should look something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nnotify_my_program\nsleep 300\nexec /sbin/shutdown.apple \"$@\"\n\nThe \"notify_my_program\" should be replaced with something that tells your service to shutdown. It could be as simple as sending it the SIGTERM signal.\nPlease ensure that you have the proper permissions on the shell script (i.e. the same as the original shutdown program).\nAfter the above mentioned modification, your system should at shutdown first notify your service to shutdown, wait 5 minutes and then do whatever it usually does at shutdown.\nThe modified shutdown process should be used when you shutdown from the command line as well as when doing it from the GUI (i.e. from the Apple menu).\nFinally, a more involved solution would be to actually replace launchd with your own custom init system. The simplest way to do that would be to download the source code for launchd, change the shutdown sequence, recompile and replace launchd on your system. The /sbin/shutdown program works just by sending a signal to launchd (various signals for reboot, halt, poweroff, etc.) - so the actual shutdown sequence for the user-space part of the system is actually handled by launchd, so in this manner, you can customize it to do anything you want. \nNote that changing the shutdown sequence in either of the two mentioned ways require you to disable SIP (System Integrity Protection) before proceeding.\n", "Q: Does a third party fixing my Mac have access to my files? My old Macbook kept flashing between a prohibitory symbol and a folder with a question mark. Internet recovery stopped working when I tried to use reinstall Sierra OS, so I initially gave up on fixing it. Now, someone I don't really know is going to try fixing it for me.\nIf possible, I'd like to know if they'd have to access/search my files to fix the issue? I'm a bit of a private person, so I'd like to know what's going to happen. Would it be better to take it to an Apple store instead?\n\nA: In order to repair a Mac you will (generally) need an administrative password as doing things like reinstalling software and the like requires an admin password.\nEven if you create a separate admin account for this person to use in effecting repairs an unscrupulous person would have no trouble getting into your stuff.\nUnless you have put your personal information inside an encrypted .DMG file. Then even if you do create an admin account just for the repair guy the chances of him getting to any of your personal stuff is practically nil.\nSo no they don't have to access your personal files to effect a fix and an honest tech would never do that. Hey if I have to give my Mac over to Apple for repairs I back up my profile and then delete it and create a temporary profile for them to use, just in case.\nBut if you can't back it up then your next best thing is to put your stuff in an encrypted DMG for the duration and pray there is no data loss. Also pray that your tech is a scrupulous, ethical, person. Regardless, at that point, there is little or nothing to see anyway.\nI learned a long time ago in the IT biz, the stuff on most people's computers is uninteresting to everyone but the owner. And that combined with ethics keeps me out of other people's stuff. be sure you trust whoever looks at your Mac.\n", "Q: What could be the cause? I/O completely died. Constant spinning, even logging in takes forever iMac 5K, late 2014 model. The weirdest thing happened yesterday. This machine is usually very performant — 8GB ram, 3TB Fusion drive. I dual-boot Windows on it using Boot Camp.\nAs of now, I still have 980GB free — this issue therefore cannot be due to low storage.\nBackground\nThe Mac ran perfectly fine until I used Photos.app to browse some photos (the app did a \"library permissions repair\"). Shortly after, I began experiencing frequent macOS user interface freezes (all apps, spinning beachball) for sometimes minutes on end.\nActivity Monitor showed very low RAM pressure and barely any CPU stress at the time. Because I couldn't isolate the issue, I rebooted the Mac.\nNow, even clicking the login picture hangs the computer for around 4-5 minutes. Yes, it takes that long to show the password field. After entering the password, the wallpaper appears 2 minutes in, the Dock appears in another 3 minutes, and menu bar widgets take around 2 minutes to appear each. Opening Launchpad hangs on \"Loading applications...\" for minutes on end, and each individual app icon loads in its own time.\nMore symptoms\n\n*\n\n*Opening anything - System Preferences, About this Mac, Spotlight, Finder takes ages, and freezes the whole interface while it's waiting. In this frozen state, only the cursor moves and nothing else responds whatsoever.\n\n*If not clicking on anything, the whole interface freezes periodically for 2-3 minutes anyway.\n\n*For whatever reason, opened apps work completely fine — you can drag them around, and select list items in them. It appears that doing anything that requires any I/O, like switching Finder folders or System Preference panes, however, takes forever.\n\n*When I am able to open Activity Monitor, there are 0 culprits. No apps using the disk, RAM pressure is super low—although, perhaps normally, swap usage it at 0 bytes—and the CPU is virtually idle. Strange.\n\n*SSHing into the Mac from another box exhibits these same symptoms, suggesting it's not loginwindow. SSH takes about a minute to log in and every command takes forever to execute.\n\nWhat I tried\n\n*\n\n*I ran Apple Hardware Diagnostics (Cmd+D on startup). No hardware issues found.\n\n*I ran First Aid on the APFS volume in Recovery OS (Cmd+R on startup). No major issues found, and it seemed OK.\n\n*I removed /var/db/.applesetupdone in Single User Mode to force macOS to create a new admin account. The admin account suffers from the same symptoms.\n\nSystem info\nI'm running macOS Mojave 10.14.6 Beta. Yes, I'm aware it's beta software, but it worked fine for ages until yesterday. I'm not keen on reinstalling macOS, and doing a backup is impossible as I do not own an external hard drive of the Mac's capacity. In fact, the Mac sort of was my back-up hard drive in a sense.\nWhat can I do? Do these symptoms ring a bell? It seems like I/O to me, but  I'm honestly quite lost.\n\nA: Since this Mac is a backup, I would buy or find an external drive and install a clean OS there - leaving the internal drive and data untouched.\nThis lets you test the hardware with a clean OS with minimal risk to losing your data.\nThen, since you don't have a drive big enough to back up all the data, you can wait to see if you want to throw out less important things until your data that needs to be backed up fits on the drive you have or you can fund a drive large enough to keep the data you choose to keep.\nI wouldn't mess with things - slow IO and freezes out of the blue are usually two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*fundamental errors / corruption to the data structures that a fsck can't or won't fix\n\n*hardware issues with spinning drives (SSD generally don't slow - they just fail when they can't accommodate any more bad blocks or the controller itself fails)\n\n\nBoth of the above, you need a backup to recover from in my experience and delaying making that backup, reduces what data you can save.\n", "Q: What displays work with the Mac Pro (2019)? What displays besides the Pro Display XDR will work with the 2019 Mac Pro? Is there a list somewhere of (both Apple and non-Apple) displays that are compatible?\n\n\nA: The new Mac Pro can be configured with a range of graphics card options. \nRegardless of the option chosen by the user, it can be connected either via HDMI 2 or Thunderbolt 3 to compatible displays, and also provides the option for DisplayPort connections*.\nThe various graphic card options also provide different combinations of these ports. For example, the base level AMD Radeon Pro 580X comes with two HDMI 2 ports and four DisplayPort connections that can support the following combinations of external displays:\n\n\n*\n\n*six 4K displays\n\n*two 5K displays\n\n*two Pro Display XDRs\n\n\nThe AMD Radeon Pro Vega II, on the other hand, comes with one HDMI 2 port, four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and two DisplayPort connections that can support the following combinations of external displays:\n\n\n*\n\n*six 4K displays\n\n*three 5K displays\n\n*two Pro Display XDRs\n\n\nAnd finally, the AMD Radeon Pro Vega II Duo comes with one HDMI 2 port, four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and four DisplayPort connections that can support the following combinations of external displays:\n\n\n*\n\n*eight 4K displays\n\n*four 5K displays\n\n*four Pro Display XDRs\n\n\nOf course, with the expandability of the Mac Pro you also have the ability to use different graphics cards and therefore the types of displays compatible with it will depend on the card you're using. \nFinally, with the use of adaptors you may be able to support other displays as well.\n* DisplayPort connections are routed to the system to support internal Thunderbolt 3 ports\n", "Q: Apple Watch no longer displays heart rate after watchOS update Yesterday I updated my Apple Watch to watchOS 5.2.1 and ever since my Heart Rate complication has stopped displaying my heart rate on the watch face. I can still tap it and measure my heart rate, but it’s not displayed on the watch face.\nIs this a new 'feature' of watchOS? If not, how do I fix it?\n\nA: 1.

I successfully installed and booted to this new volume, but when I returned to the first volume (which has macOS Mojave installed) I was surprised to see a third volume.\n\nThe \"Beta - Data\" seems to have been created during the installation process. This third volume is also not visible when I return to the \"Beta\" boot volume, only having the \"Beta\" and \"Panther\" volumes. The \"Beta\" volume when booted into it also seems to have the combined size of the \"Beta\" and \"Beta - Data\" volumes. \nI originally created the \"Beta\" volume with a quota of 256GB as well, but that quota is gone from that volume and the \"Beta - Data\" volume seems to have inherited it.\nThe \"Beta\" volume seems to contain the system install; containing the home, Library, System and Users directories (though the Users directory only contains the Shared directory, and not the home folder for the user I created). While the \"Beta - Data\" volume has the user-specific data; having the Device, private and Users directories (with the home folder for the user I created within, as well as another Shared directory).\nI have never tried dual booting on a Mac before, so this could be more common than I am aware of, but I couldn't seem to find any information on why this would happen or where this volume came from. Could this be a new \"feature\" (or bug) from macOS Catalina? Or did I just do something wrong when I created the new volume?\n\nA: macOS Catalina has a new feature to further isolate the OS from data. In the APFS container it is installed within, an APFS volume for the OS is created alongside one for your data. The former is mounted read-only within Catalina, and the latter has the Data postfix containing your apps and data.\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/103/\nWithin Catalina, Disk Utility shows these volumes with a Finder icon and home icon to distinguish them. This does not appear in Mojave, showing as normal volumes. Keep in mind the release notes for the beta of Catalina, specifically dual booting and Spotlight indexing, which will heavily confuse Mojave with the cross-volume linking of various folders.\n\nA: Here is the layout for Catalina storage from \n\nReading the entire article for a very excellent explanation and mapping of firm links, and much more details is well worth it for anyone interested in storage on macOS\n\n\n*\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/2019/10/08/macos-catalina-boot-volume-layout/\nThe system volume is read only. Your data and areas that are write capable are on the Data volume.

How can I prevent this in the future?\n\nA: Welcome @user65526! So, generally speaking, more information is  needed for something like this. The closest I can guess is: some kernel extension, possible related to a graphics card or external video display (?) is getting hung up with Apple's \"Power Nap\" feature, also known as darkwake[s]. I'd recommended disabling the feature entirely, by entering in your terminal:  \nsudo pmset -a darkwakes 0\nThis will disable \"Power Nap\" in all cases. IMO its not a particularly useful feature anyway.\n\nA: My guess, in my case it happened because I simultaneously closed laptop and plugged off external HDMI display. I think I should first detach laptop from external devices, let handle it and then close laptop. \nReport from my case:\nStackshot Reason: Sleep transition timed out after 180 seconds while entering darkwake on way to sleep.

With headphones, 8 hear sound just for a second but that fades out very quickly. I am running OS X mojave and don’t know how to fix this.\n\nA: The amplifier to make sound is the likely cause of failure. Since that’s on the logic board, a free warranty swap or a flat rate repair for $300 or so are the likely costs to fix this properly. \nHave you tested installing a new OS on an external drive or wiping and reinstalling in case it’s software?

In macOS Mojave, when in the Displays control panel, on the Arrangement tab, holding down option and dragging a display turns the cursor white.  What does this mean?  Does it do something special?\n\nA: Holding down the Option key allows the currently dragged display to be dropped on top of another display to enable mirroring.\nThe dragged display still snaps to the edges of the other displays at first, but if you drag further towards the center, the displays can be made to overlap and this turns on the \"Mirror Displays\" checkbox.\n", "Q: Cusor won't react to hyperlinks when using Safari Problem Descriptions:\nNormally when hovering the mouse cursor on a hyperlink, the cursor turns into a little hand, and the link will show the CSS hover effect.

Finally I found the potential cause:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter Safari full-screen mode.\n\n*Click any website from Bookmarks (including Favorites).\n\n*In the opened website, turn on and off the Bookmark Sidebar once.\n\n*From now on, any website that opened from Bookmarks won't trigger hover effect.\nHere's the same in action:\n\n\nWhat I've tried to solve this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Empty cache, clear history, remove all plugins, delete relevant plist file, quit all the other apps, but to no avail.\n\n*Installed latest Safari Technology Preview, repeat step 1, but to no avail.\n\n*Created another admin account, problem persists.\n\n*Repaired disk permission in Recovery Mode, didn't fix the issue.\n\nI am using a MacBook Pro 15, 2018, running macOS Mojave 10.14.5 (18F203). Safari version 12.1.1.\n\nA: Believe it or not, Photoshop is the culprit here.\nTurn Photoshop off and the hand will appear....it has something to do with assigning shortcuts to different apps...\nAnyway thats what happens to me...once I reboot PS, the cursor turns to a hand for a while...then goes back to not appearing...\nHope this helps...\n\nA: There's nothing in the release notes that would indicate this has been fixed, so it's likely a new bug. I don't do Mac OS development, but for this to work, Safari has to tell the OS 'hey, change the mouse pointer when you're over this area.'\nSome things you might try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset NVRAM and/or PRAM\n\n*If you have multiple monitors, unplug all but the primary one, and restart the system.\n\n*Change the size of the mouse pointer; that might force the pointer system to reset.\n\n*Reinstall the OS (Bonus: this reinstalls Safari.)\n\n*Consider updating the firmware on the monitors you have. (Instructions and links will be manufacturer-specific.)\n\n\nUpdate: Looks like it's settable via CSS, so you've probably got a mix of buggy javascript, CSS, and maybe a bug in Safari. Here's a JSFiddle that illustrates how it works.\n\nA: Been testing for a day, Safari Safari Technology Preview Release 86 seems fixed this issue.\nThe problem might be related to this:\n\nPointer Events\n\n*\n\n*Added support for chorded button interactions\n\n*Updated to fire pointerout and pointerleave events after firing pointercancel\n\nNot sure when the public version of Safari will be fixed.\n\nA: Finally found the culprit, as said from Simon, it is the Photoshop, just quit your photoshop and the cursor will be fine\n", "Q: Garageband pan won't stay put I am trying to record and play back tracks on GarageBand and the pan feature on the tracks keep turning fully right or left without prompting.

I tried downloading directly from App Store and it stoped after every 500-800 MB, although it resumed from where it was stopped. but, after 100% download nothing happened, it didn't ask me to restart neither any error. So, is there any problem or is it not compatible with my machine.?\n\nA: Based on your post, your MacBook should be compatible with the Mojave update.\n\n\n*\n\n*Once the App Store app finishes downloading and installing you should see a installer in the Launchpad (it should automatically open, otherwise try double clicking on it to manually start the installer).\n \n\n*If this doesn't work out you might want to look at making a bootable USB installer, and proceed with the installation after booting from the USB stick. See here (Apple Support Documentation)\n", "Q: How to stop \"NTFS new version\", or any notification for that matter? I used paragon NTFS for a while and then deleted it from applications folder. I also removed the dmg file(I know it would not stop notifications). \nBut I keep getting notifications like this everyday.\n.\nClicking on it is useless. Safari would open(if not already) but no new window, no webpage, nothing.\nI searched the Library folder for NTFS and paragon and deleted files and folders for e.g. from application support, from caches. One folder in its name had \"notification\". I deleted that too. Unhid hidden files by CMD + Shift + . For a temporary fix, I turned off notification from System Preferences. But I need a permanent fix.\n\nA: Any App you need to actually run an installer & give admin perms, rather than just drag to Applications, installs elements somewhere inside the 'system' itself.\nIt is not wise to just throw these out if you no longer want them, as they will leave all the system bits behind.\nAs you threw away the component which contains the uninstaller, the app itself, then by far the simplest way to uninstall it will be to get the installer again, install it, then use its own uninstaller to uninstall it.\nAt the moment it is still entirely functional, you only threw out the control surface.\n\n\nA: Open System Preferences app → Notifications, find the application (I'm guessing it would be Paragon NTFS or something similar in this case), set the alert style to none and disable all the checkboxes below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Notifications on your Mac\nFor the Paragon NTFS specific notifications, it sounds like you may have some component still installed.\nCheck that there's nothing under System Preferences app → Users & Groups → Logged in user →  Login Items for Paragon NTFS, that there isn't anything installed via the macOS App Store, and that there aren't any processes running for it when you look in the Activity Monitor application.\n", "Q: Command or Shift key modifiers always activated Regularly, when I am using Photoshop CC 2018 (mostly), suddenly I got a modifier key which always stays activated. Sometime it is the Command key, and sometimes Shift key, which make it impossible to work with these kind of applications using modifiers keys intensely the  for almost anything.\nThe only way is reboot, but even so, I suspect that when I have rebooted and relaunched Adobe Photoshop, the mean bad appends very quickly, so very hard/almost impossible to work.\nHere's my configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacPro 4,1 (Nehalem) running OS X El Capitan 10.11.6\n\n*Adobe CC 2018 Suite\nAlso, I have a Wacom Intuos4 Tablet, (actually with driver 6.3.32-4), but I got the bug since several previous version of the Wacom Tablet driver, and (surprise) a mouse and a keyboard.\nWorth mentioning: the keyboard is actually a Window keyboard, but it didn't need any driver to install.

I have spent hours on debugging this issue. As I found it this issue exists for a long time. I don't sure about 6.3.32-4. Wacom support keeps recommending to reinstall the driver. I am also in contact for a RMA. I guess it is a driver issue. The shift click issue is reproducible using Wacom driver 6.3.35-2 and 6.3.36-2 on macOS 10.12 and MacOS 10.14.\nSolution:\nIn my case I went back to Wacom driver 6.3.34-2, which resolves the issue.\n", "Q: Music on iPhone not showing up in iTunes on macOS If I connect my iPhone to my Mac via USB cable, iTunes launches and shows the iPhone icon in the toolbar. But if I click that, no content whatsoever is displayed under the \"On My Device\" header (except one iBook I bought).\nDoes anyone know how to solve this? I would like to manage the music downloaded to my iPhone via macOS iTunes, as removing downloaded music on the iPhone itself is a disaster in user friendliness.\nI have iTunes Match, Apple Music and running macOS Mojave 10.14.5 with iOS 12.3.1.\n\nA: Follow the steps below to fix the problem of Apple Music not showing up in iTunes on Mac\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes on your Mac by clicking on the iTunes icon in the Dock of your Mac.\n\n\niTunes Icon in the Dock of Mac\n\n\n*Next, click on iTunes tab in the top Menu Bar of your Mac and then click on Preferences… option in the drop-down menu (See image below)\n\n\niTunes Preferences Option on Mac\n\n\n*On the Preferences screen, click on the General tab (in case it is not already selected) and then check the little box next to Show Apple Music Features and click on the OK button to save your preferences for iTunes.\n\n\nShow Apple Music Features on Mac\n\n\n*In case “Show Apple Music Features” is already selected and Apple Music is not showing in iTunes, Uncheck the box and then click OK.\n\n\nDo Not Show Apple Music Features on Mac\n\n\n*Next, click on iTunes tab in the top Menu Bar of your Mac and then click on Preferences… option in the drop-down menu.\n\n\niTunes Preferences Option on Mac\n\n\n*On the Preferences screen, click on the General tab, check the box for Show Apple Music Features. and click on OK.\n\n\nShow Apple Music Features on Mac\nSteps 4, 5 and 6 are applicable in case a software glitch or iTunes bug was preventing Apple Music from appearing in iTunes on your Mac.\n\nA: The music available on the iPhone is not shown in the iTunes when you click on the iPhone icon in the iTunes toolbar.\nThe music should be present in your iTunes library (if you originally synced it from iTunes to your iPhone). This is by design and how syncing music from iTunes to iPhone works.\nYou need to connect your iPhone to the computer with iTunes where from you originally synced your iPhone. Once connected, go to music sync section within iPhone section under iTunes and check/uncheck to add/remove songs.\n", "Q: I can't get messages from my iPhone to my car's audio system - does iPhone support MAP? I recently purchased a new car (a Toyota if that matters), and on the weekend I discovered that I should be able to receive SMS and MMS messages via the car’s audio/navigation unit. \nI spent about two hours trying to get this to work with my iPhone 6s, but nothing I tried worked. All other functions seem to work fine. I can play Apple Music, podcasts etc through the unit. I can use voice control through the unit. I can make and receive phone calls through the unit. I can import my address book just fine. What I can’t do is import/receive text messages.\nI’ve tried rebooting my iPhone. I’ve tried repairing my iPhone to the car’s audio system multiple times. I’ve tried changing the settings on the car’s system from being the one to initiate the bluetooth connection to letting the phone initiate the connection and vice versa.\nLooking over the owners manual again I see that for a smartphone to support the messaging function it has to support the MAP bluetooth profile. \nDoes the iPhone 6s support the MAP bluetooth profile? If it does, how can I get this to work?\n\nA: Firstly, all iPhones since the iPhone 5s support the Message Access Profile (MAP). For more information see Bluetooth profiles that iOS supports.\nAs for how you can get this to work, it seems to me you’ve done a great job of trying to troubleshoot this. However, one thing you probably missed (because it isn’t at all obvious!) is the fact you may need to enable Show Notifications.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iPhone go into Settings\n\n*Tap on Bluetooth\n\n*Find the listing for your car’s device and tap on the info icon (it’s the blue circle with an i in it)\n\n*Now make sure that Show Notifications is enabled\n\n\nOnce you’ve done that, try again to use the messages function. Please note, however, that many car units won’t import messages already on the phone, so the best way to test this is to have someone send you a text while the phone is connected. \n", "Q: Why do some files on iCloud suddenly force me to download again? I found that sometimes my files which I put on my iCloud are going to disappear from my local hard drive and thus force me to download them again. These files have the \"download from the cloud\" icon on Finder, and I'm not sure when and why these icons are added to which files.\nI don't like to download them again, but this happens quite often. The files are put under ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/my_directory. How can I avoid them and keep the files available at local?\n\nA: This is the correct situation if your Mac has Optimize Mac Storage enabled in the iCloud preference pane.\n\nIf your storage is under light pressure, I don't find recently used documents being released from local storage much if at all, but if you are running with a very close to full drive, the system may be removing the local copy before you like.\n\nAbove is an SSD under light pressure - lots of space for local backups, iCloud data to remain cached and space to add new files. Below is iCloud showing nearly 200 GB of data so if all of that were on my MacBook - my pressure would be constrained / close to full.\n\nThere's nothing sudden about this, though in my experience. Most people I assist with this are more bothered by the large amount of data that could be \"purged\" and isn't but I get your not wanting to re-download and wait for files.\n", "Q: Safari extension for Google results navigation (↑/k, ↓/j) Title says it all. I found some posts linking to some private locations (mostly dead). I wonder if there ain't something like that for Safari. Google Chrome has several of them. E.g. Web Search Navigator. Are these extensions just well hidden or aren't there any at all?\n\nA: I am also very annoyed by this. I found an old extension that isn't supported anymore called Mafuyu (http://wakabamac.blog95.fc2.com/blog-entry-1013.html). I've tried to run it but it's obsolete. \nAnother option seemed to be knogs which I found on GitHub (https://github.com/nqzero/knogs), originally for Chrome and Firefox but apparently someone adapted it for Safari.

Unfortunately I cannot type c. I have tried both wired and wireless keyboard, and both bluetooth and USB-dongle wireless. Even over VNC from my (somewhat more current) iMac, I cannot type the c key.\nEach time I press the c key it plays the \"Funk\" error noise (sometimes after a delay of a few seconds).\nI am able to copy and paste the letter \"c\" from a file which already contained the letter \"c\".\n\nA: This article from Mac World (for macOS 10.12.5, not Mac OS X 10.5.8) suggests that the key could have been set up to speak the selected text.\nThis would consistent with the \"Funk\" error noise each time I pressed the c key, because there was no text selected for it to read out!

The Google accounts have two-factor authentication. I'm able to log in the accounts via a Safari window, and then use them with Mail and Calendar without problems.\nUntil my Mac sleeps.  On wake, it demands that I log the accounts in again, requiring several rounds of password and two-factor authentication.\nI have tried using Google's app-specific passwords, but they aren't accepted at the login prompt that pops up from System Preferences > Internet Accounts.\nIs there a method to keep macOS logged in indefinitely?\nNote: This does not appear to have the same cause as Can't login with Google using Internet Accounts — the answers there did not solve the problem for me.\n\nA: If, like me, you have that problem, you might want to check that googleapis.com and other google domains aren't blocked by a firewall (if you are using little snitch, double check that accountsd can access google apis.\nOnce I allowed accountsd outgoing internet access to googleapis.com, as shown in the attached screenshot, the mac no longer complained when woken up from sleep that I needed to enter my password for my GSuite account.\nIf that doesn't work, you can maybe look for a DNS server or a host file that would block the googleapis aswell.\n\nA: I solved this problem by deleting my Google accounts in System Prefrences and replacing them with generic IMAP mail and CalDAV calendar accounts using Google's generated app passwords.  These do not expire except when I ask them to on Google's site.\n", "Q: High Sierra Airplay Problems I've been using a Mac running Sierra with an Airplay 2 capable Denon home cinemas amp for several months without any major problems.  \nAfter upgrading to High Sierra I've run into two VERY annoying issues: \n\n\n*\n\n*Whenever I switch audio output from internal speaker to the Airplay amp and then hit play in a Youtube video or other video player iTunes starts instead of the video playing!  I have to quit iTunes and hit play again before it actually starts playing\n\n*Whenever playback starts all open network connections drop.  \n\n\nDoes anybody know how to stop iTunes autostarting when I switch to Airplay as the output device, and how to stop the connections from dropping?  Neither of these things happened in Sierra.  \nEDIT: I tried getting a list of audio devices and AirPlay doesn't show up at all.  \n\nsystem_profiler SPAudioDataType Audio:\nDevices:\n\n    Built-in Output:\n\n      Default Output Device: Yes\n      Default System Output Device: Yes\n      Manufacturer: Apple Inc.\n      Output Channels: 2\n      Current SampleRate: 44100\n      Transport: Built-in\n      Output Source: Internal Speakers\n\n    iShowU Audio Capture:\n\n      Default Input Device: Yes\n      Input Channels: 2\n      Manufacturer: shinywhitebox ltd.\n      Output Channels: 2\n      Current SampleRate: 44100\n      Transport: Unknown\n      Input Source: Default\n      Output Source: Default\n\n    Stream/Record:\n\n      Manufacturer: Apple Inc.\n      Output Channels: 2\n      Current SampleRate: 44100\n      Transport: Unknown\n      Output Source: Default\n\n\nHowever \"Denon AVR-6400H\" shows up as an available output device in the audio prefs pane and in the icon menu options.  \n\nA: That's probably because High Sierra introduced AirPlay2 (before, you were running AirPlay). With AirPlay2, it's no more a system wide output that's being redirected to your remote player, but instead a per-application output. Technically speaking, it's now a userspace library that application must implement.\nSince only iTunes supports AirPlay2 for now, I guess this is the reason why it's being launched.\nAs to how to disable this, please check if your player can disable its AirPlay2 announce or use iTunes...\n", "Q: How to set Inspector in Numbers for macOS hidden by default? Whenever I open a spreadsheet in Numbers for macOS, the Inspector's Format tab opens up. I'd prefer to have it hidden by default.\nIs there any way to change this behaviour?\n\nA: Numbers for macOS remembers the Inspector visibility setting for every spreadsheet when you close it. So, once you have hidden the Inspector for a spreadsheet and closed it, opening it subsequently will keep it hidden.\n", "Q: How to delete Music Creation?

Is there some sort of software or feature that grants us a more granular ACLs for files?  We are going to start deploying Macbooks to our users for the first time.  Each MacBook will have Parallels Desktop on it with our company image on it.  This creates a .pvm file.  \nWe want to be able to prevent the .pvm from being copied to an external drive.  Problem is, our user's will be admin users so our options are limited.  Encryption of the file is a no go because we don't want our users to have the ability to move the file somewhere and still be able to open it.  Is there a way to prevent another admin user from being able to copy the file?  I've tried uchg flag but it causes issues with launching the VM where it doesn't even allow you to.  \nIs there some software that does this, or can anyone make any recommendations on how we can handle this?\nThanks\n\nA: No, that's not possible on macOS - and it's not possible on other operating systems either.\nEssentially if the user has administrative access, can install their own programs, and they're able to read the file (which is necessary in order to use it with Parallels Desktop) - they'll also be able to copy the file.\nHowever you can do other things to get nearer to the goals that end-users will be able to (a) run your virtual desktop and (b) not copy your image file.\nA common way of doing this is to run the virtual machine image on a server, and only allow access over a remote desktop protocol to use the programs on the image. This is often accomplished using Citrix or various solutions from other vendors such as VMware or Microsoft.\nAnother option you have is to limit the computers physically. For example some companies \"glue\" USB ports and similar to ensure that users cannot easily plugin external drives. You can do that with USB-C and Thunderbolt ports as well, but you'll also have to think in copying over the network. If you have to disable WiFi and other networking options as well, you'll probably end up with unusable computers.\n", "Q: How do I install beta command line tools using softwareupdate -l on 10.14.5?

The folder names correspond with the APFS boot volume UUIDs you get with diskutil ap list.\nYou have to rename the one which is identical with the UUID of macOS 10.15 beta's boot volume.\nNot tested - absolutely not recommended!\n\nBTW: I tried to find some kernel flag to add to /Volumes/Preboot/[UUID]/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist to prevent FV unlocking but failed.\n", "Q: If I delete my WhatsApp data, will my data disappears from my iCloud backup, too?

I did exclude some non-essential folders because my internet is garbage. Losing these are an inconvenience at most.\nI have not opened my MacBook yet, still looking at what my options are before I start something I will regret. I simply want to connect the old SSD to a new MacBook once to copy some files. I have no interest in keeping the SSD after that. \nI'm a bit lost because browsing google is mainly providing me with recovery services (a bit overkill? SSD should be intact) and products intended for converting the SSD into some kind of permanent external drive, but I'm only interested in a single copy. Fancy casings are not needed. \nIt has also come to my attention that regular SSD adapters might not work because apple used a proprietary design. Is this true?\nI don't have the old MacBook with me so I'm not 100% sure what model it is. I think it's a 2015 MacBook Pro (no touch bar). What type of connector do I need?\nI'm sorry if this is a bit vague. Thank you in advance. \n\nA: The easy operation is to Use target disk mode to present your Mac as a pure storage device and connect it to another computer. Many broken Macs still work to this extent and since you didn't mention how it was broken, it's quick and easy if power and the storage controller work minimally.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201462\nFrom there, you can copy / image / perform repairs using Disk Utility or other third party data recovery / disk repair / disk imaging.\nThe article above shows what connectors are supported and you'll be using some flavor of ThunderBolt on a MacBook Pro. For target access - you can use any of the TB3 to TB2 adapters as they work bidirectionally. Same with USB-C to USB-A - the adapters generally work as long as you can make a physical connection.\nLiquid damage is tricky and can break all sorts of things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Need advice: should I open the back of a 2013 Retina MacBook Pro as a means to recover data?\nIf you are intent on opening the case, the best I can offer is go to iFixit.com or a shop that sells mounting adapters / SSD upgrades for Macs. Without your exact model, we're shooting in the dark to know what tools and adapters would be needed and what bus you want to expose the storage to.\n\nA: If it is a 2013-2015 MacBook Pro, you can open it and take the SSD stick out quite easily, and put in any 2013-2015 MacBook Pro or Air (yes the internal SSD connector is the same for all of those models) and access it there, either by booting from it (assuming the MBP/A you put it in has new enough firmware to support booting from the version of macOS on the SSD), or accessing it by putting the MBP/A you have put the SSD in, into target mode by holding down T on boot until the target mode icon(s) appear on the screen and then connecting it to another Mac with a Thunderbolt cable.\nThis avoids trying to fire up the water damaged MacBook Pro at all.\n", "Q: How to tell if my old Mac supports Sidecar feature in macOS Catalina? This is a useful feature added to macOS Catalina. But how to tell if older hardware will support this new feature?\n\nA: I found a quick way to distinguish it. macOS Catalina seems to use Intel's HEVC hardware encoding. So as long as your old Mac has the 6th generation (Skylake 6xxx Series) or newer Intel processor, it definitely supports this feature.\nHEVC hardware encode on macOS 29:30\n \n\nBlacklist found by Steve Troughton-Smith\n\nSidecar supports iMac 27\" (Late 2015) or newer, MacBook Pro (2016) or newer, mac Mini (2018), Mac Pro (2019), MacBook Air (2018) , MacBook (Early 2016 or newer), and blacklists all the devices in the screenshot.\n\n  ‏\n\n\nA: Apple stated that Sidecar is part of Catalina so if the hardware supports Catalina then it will support Sidecar.\n\n", "Q: Does anyone know why app \"Recovery Partition Creator\" is now an un-maintained project?

Here's the setup I'm setting up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac HD (500GB SSD)\n\n*Media HD (2TB SSD)\n\n*Daily Backup HD (3TB HDD, partitioned into a 2TB Daily Backup Mac HD, a 500GB Daily Backup Media HD, and an irrelevant 500GB Spare HD)\n\n*Time Machine HD, (4TB, but this drive isn't relevant for my question).\n\n\nUsing SuperDuper, what's the proper way to back up two separate drives to partitions on a single external drive?  Can I back up my Mac HD and my Media HD at the same time?  It'll be running automatically in the middle of the night, so speed isn't a concern.  I've been backing up one drive M/W/F and the other T/T/S, but I'd like to switch to backing both drives up daily.  With SuperDuper, can I schedule both to run at the same time?\nAlso: Since my Mac and Media drives are SSD but my backup drive is a partitioned HDD, is there anything I should be careful of when I format the backup drive?\nEDIT: I'm specifically asking about backing up multiple hard drives to separate partitions on a single drive.  I already have an external 3TB drive partitioned for backups.  If my Mac hard drive dies, I like having a bootable backup ready to go in an instant without needing to restore it first.  If my Media drive dies, I like having a backup ready to go without needing to restore it first.  I also have another external drive for Time Machine.  I'm religious about backing everything up (safety first, as they say).  I just want to make sure it's fine to back up two hard drives to two partitions on a single drive at the same time.\n\nA: Actually this is quite possible to store the backups, all different drives on one volume with little effort. The magic words here are \"back up to a disk image.\"\nWhen you select the destination in SuperDuper one of the options is Disk Image. Just give the disk image a name and point it at your backup drive and all files will go into the disk image, completely accessible and completely separate from everything else on that drive.\nIf you like you can also encrypt the disk image for added security but you would have to create an encrypted sparseimage DMG from within Disk Utility first. I think that would work, never tried it but it makes sense it would.\n\nA: drive is a partitioned HDD, is there anything I should be careful of when I format the backup drive\nI think it is best to schedule at different times.The night should be long enough . With rotating media saving to a dmg file, the arm will be moving all over the platter either at write time or at read time or even both. If you are using separate partitions, the arm is sure to be bouncing between partitions at write time. Thus, stressing out the arm. \n\nA: I found my answer:\n\nIf more than one backup is scheduled for the same time, SuperDuper will automatically start them one after another until all have completed.\n\nI assume that means SuperDuper will automatically start the next backup when the one that's running is completed, which is exactly what I want.\nEDIT:  Yep, that's what it means, and it works perfectly.\n", "Q: Return status of SleepDisabled in Applescript I'm trying to do an Applescript to enable or not SleepDisabled (using pmset) depending on the state of SleepDisabled.\nSomething like :\nset SuperSleep to do shell script \"return status of SleepDisabled\"\nif SuperSleep is equal to \"0\" then\ndo shell script \"sudo pmset -a disablesleep 1\" user name \"Myname\" password \"Mypassword\" with administrator privileges\nelse\ndo shell script \"sudo pmset -a disablesleep 0\" user name \"Myname\" password \"Mypassword\" with administrator privileges\n\nI tried looking into man psmet or using defaults read but no success.\nThe only thing I'm thinking of is using pmset -g to shows up this :\nSystem-wide power settings:\n SleepDisabled      0\nCurrently in use:\n lidwake              1\n autopoweroff         1\n standbydelayhigh     86400\n autopoweroffdelay    28800\n standbydelaylow      10800\n standby              1\n proximitywake        0\n ttyskeepawake        1\n hibernatemode        3\n powernap             0\n gpuswitch            2\n hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\n highstandbythreshold 50\n displaysleep         2\n sleep                2 (sleep prevented by coreaudiod, coreaudiod)\n tcpkeepalive         1\n halfdim              1\n acwake               0\n disksleep            10\n\nAnd then look up the status of SleepDisabled on the list, but I don't know how to return the \"0\" or \"1\" of SleepDisabled...\n\nA: The following works for me:\nset SuperSleep to (do shell script \"pmset -g | awk '/SleepDisabled/{print $2}'\")\n\nif SuperSleep is equal to \"0\" then\n    do shell script \"pmset -a disablesleep 1\" with administrator privileges\nelse\n    do shell script \"pmset -a disablesleep 0\" with administrator privileges\nend if\n\nNOTE: Do not use sudo in a do shell script command, Just use with administrator privileges as it's all that's needed when you'd normally do sudo in Terminal or a bash script. Additionally I would not include the user name \"Myname\" and password \"Mypassword\" as it is not encrypted in the file. Just type it into the dialog box brought up by the administrator privileges option.\nAlso note that SleepDisabled was not present in the output of pmset -g when I first tried in Terminal, and was not present until I used the sudp pmset -a disablesleep 0 command from Terminal. If this is the case on your system you'd need to adjust the code to handle that situation. You could use an if (compound) control statement.\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide.

I am already successfully sharing this connection with an iPhone via the Sharing panel in System Preferences, per the instructions here.\nWhat I'd like to do is also share this connection with a Nintendo Switch that is connected to the MacBook via USB. Is this possible?\n\nI've tried enabling the \"To computers using: USB 10/100/1000 LAN\" selection, but that doesn't seem to work. I wonder if there is something else I need to do or troubleshoot to get this working.\n\nA: Is the Nintendo Switch already connected to the MacBook?  How?\nDo you have more than one USB to Ethernet adapter?  If you don't then you will likely need more.\nThe Nintendo Switch is not a general purpose computer and so has very limited support for devices plugged in by USB.  It will support many USB to Ethernet adapters, so the easiest way to get a network between the two is to use USB to Ethernet adapters on both the MacBook and Nintendo Switch and connect them by an Ethernet cable.  An Ethernet crossover cable might be necessary but most Ethernet adapters can use the more common straight through cables in cases like this too.\nThis means your MacBook will have two USB to Ethernet adapters, one to where you get your internet, and the other connected to the Nintendo.  You will have to set internet sharing to share from one to the other.\nIt might be cheaper and easier to use some kind of Ethernet switch, hub, or access point instead.  Without knowing the situation you are in this might not be possible.\n\nA: You have selected USB 10/100/1000 LAN for sharing the internet from as well as to other computers. This will not work. You need to select the proper device in the to section.

I figured the new battery was dead so i went to plug it in and to my surprise the computer chimed at me simply from plugging it in... i had thought i had shut down completely before disassembly to install the new battery, but i guess not.\nSo now that the computer was on, it is asking for a password as if i was waking it up from sleep.. but none of the keys on my internal keyboard work. holding the power button doesnt do anything. The trackpad is working though.\nI plugged in a USB keyboard from my PC and most of the keys on it wont work on the macbook (corsair k95 platinum). Some keys do work though, \"Z\",\"X\", and \"V\" work but \"C\" doesnt. I should note here that i dont actually know what the working keys are mapped to because i am entering these keys in the password field to unlock the macbook.\nSince the trackpad was working, i figured a system reboot might do the trick so i went to hit the shut down button only to have the system go into sleep mode. the restart button makes the computer enter sleep mode and exit it immediately.. or maybe i am just confused on what the system is actually doing.\nHas anyone experienced this? How do i restart my computer without a power button or functional internal/external keyboard?\nLasts resort is to take it to the apple store but who knows what they will say since i replaced the battery without paying apple.\nAlso, while the magsafe plug does change color from green to amber, the mac os doesnt recognize that it is charging.. the icon never changes to a lightning bolt in the corner, but the battery percentage is increasing.\n\nA: So i unplugged everything and replugged everything back in and now it is working fine. i guess it is either a cable that is going bad or i didnt secure everything tightly.\n", "Q: MacOS 10.13.6 Can't delete or remove applications I can't locate the following files.

Now I can't update my MacOs because I am running out of space.\nIf I click on Go Application or right click on Delete files. It doesn't work. Please help\n\n\nA: What application are you trying to remove? Have you tried with an uninstaller tool?\nFor exemple, you can follow this to fully uninstall Office 2011: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-office-2011-for-mac-issues-by-completely-uninstalling-before-you-reinstall-ba8d8d13-0015-4eea-b60b-7719c2cedd17\nMany application has the same type of uninstaller.\n\nA: About this Mac is a slow application in terms of file listing and deleting, especially in case of such big files. The reason I can guess is that it is build atop Finder and requires a huge amount of sorting and storage computations. Also apps like Xcode which were installed from Mac App Store will require passwords while emptying trash if not now.\nI suggest that you find the uninstaller of all the apps in their DMGs, if any.\nFor the remaining ones, I suggest that you check their official pages for uninstallation.\nAs a last and deprecated option for the remaining ones, go to Finder's Go menu-> Applications -> delete specific apps or folders. Adding to this, there might be files in ~/Library folder like caches or application support. To remove them, go to Go menu in Finder, hold option key and press Library-> go to Caches -> find the relevant files and delete the ones of your games.\nDon't delete your Xcode developer files as they might be helpful for some later builds and contain Logs.\n", "Q: Can i use A1278 screen to replace with my A1502 screen I've a A1502 macbook pro late 2013 with damaged 13\" retina display. There is another A1278 macbook pro with 13\" display. I am getting this laptop way cheaper than the screen replacement. I was wondering if i could use an A1278 screen to replace with my A1502 screen. Is it possible? Are there any hardware differences? Maybe difference in the wire connector on board? Or any compatibility issues?\n\nA: This has been answered for 'the other way round': putting a Retina screen in an older MBP, and I'd suggest many of the answers there apply here.\nThe screens are different dimensions, and use different connectors. The firmware expects the original screen resolution. \n", "Q: Airpods connect but no music I have an issue...My AirPods don’t have any connection Issue when Bluetooth is turned on. But when Bluetooth is turnt off...my iPhone has more difficulty in recognizing the AirPods when I open the case and it seems to sync but actually it doesn’t since Bluetooth is still turnt off,thus the music still plays from the iPhone’s speakers. \nHowever when I reset the AirPods...during the « first » connection my iPhone recognizes the AirPods and they connect automatically ( with Bluetooth turnt off) and the music plays from the AirPods with no problem.\nCan Anyone help me please ??\n\nA: Disconnect from Bluetooth accessories (Apple):\n\nOpen Control Center and tap [the Bluetooth icon]￼. The icon dims and your device disconnects from any accessory it's connected to, except for Apple Watch, Instant Hotspot, Apple Pencil, and Continuity features, like Handoff. If Bluetooth is turned off, you won’t be able to connect your iOS device to your Bluetooth accessories until:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*You turn on Bluetooth in Control Center.\n  \n*You connect to a Bluetooth accessory in Settings > Bluetooth.\n  \n*It's 5 AM local time.\n  \n*You restart your device.\n  \n\nIt’s expected behavior that Bluetooth devices won’t connect (when Bluetooth is dimmed in control center) without one of the above exceptions.\nIt seems like resetting AirPods is a special case that mimics connecting to a Bluetooth accessory directly in settings, and is therefore an exception.\n", "Q: Apple ID recovery mail going to wrong email address I tried the forgot Apple ID / password option available on the Apple's site and selected the Reset via Email option. But the recovery e-mail they are sending to has got domain part wrong. As in m*****@m*****.com instead of m*****@gmail.com.\n\nWhat can be wrong here? Is this some kind of a bug?\n\nA: If you are talking about iforgot, you must have entered the email address wrong in the page before the one in the screenshot. Please recheck. \n\nA: Apple ID ask for a recovery email, so if you entered that other email as part of security and setup, this is expected information to progress through the automated reset procedure.\nAdditionally, if someone else guessed or got your password, they may have changed things. If you're really stuck after thinking this through and reading carefully the steps and being sure you are doing all the steps - in the order asked from:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://iforgot.apple.com\nThen your next step would be to contact support to make sure you don't have any other avenues to reset the password. Hopefully there is another item you set up like security questions or a second authorization factor or telephone number.\nUsually you don't lose all access to an Apple ID unless you lose or forget two different pieces of the information you entered. Most cases you get three different avenues for resetting a password.\n", "Q: Remove all paired Bluetooth devices from iPhone in one go I'd like to remove a long list of old devices I paired to an iPhone without having to remove them one by one (I've got like 30 devices saved). I tried resetting Network settings followed by Reset All Settings but to no avail, they're still there!. Any way to do it without having to erase the iPhone?\nI just need to know if there's an Apple official way to do it, so to speak, not any third party app or method.\n\nA: The way to do this is:\nShift-Option-Click your bluetooth icon. This brings up the Debug. You will see three options in the attached image. \nRemove all devices is your one stop removal. \nReset the Bluetooth module is the factory reset option. \n\n\nA: I guess the only soluction is to erase all contents and settings\n", "Q: Force an app for macOS 10.12 Sierra and later to run on OS X Yosemite 10.10 I have an application that wouldn't start on OS X Yosemite and throws the following message\n\nThis application required OS X 10.12 or later.\n\nThe application itself is fully functional. I can easily run it via Terminal\n/Applications/My\\ App.app/Content/MacOS/My\\ App\n\nIt does start perfectly fine.\nThe old method was to edit app's Info.plist file and set LSMinimumSystemVersion to the version of OS X you are running. However, my app bundle's Info.plist doesn't have any LSMinimumSystemVersion specified at all.\nI tried to spoof the OS X version by editing: /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist and it works for My App.app but breaks a few other apps.\nSomehow, just by reading app bundle the Finder knows, it's incompatible and draws the white crossed sign over the app icon.\nHow does it know that Info.plist file does not have this information?\n\nA: One possibly explanation is that the other apps are built using the newer macOS SDK, and have their minimum deployment target set which is higher than OS X Yosemite. In such cases editing/adding LSMinimumSystemVersion key won't work.\nAlso, manually editing the Info.plist file may break the integrity of the app and may curtail it from running.\nYou need to check with the developers of the apps and see if they still support the older version of OS X or if they have builds targeting the older OS X releases.\n", "Q: When updating to macOS Catalina will the default Python installation get removed from my system? Apple will stop shipping scripting languages like Python with macOS starting with Catalina. When I eventually update to macOS Catalina, will the Python (2.7.X), which currently ships with macOS get removed from my system? Or is it only if I do a fresh install to Catalina that I won't get the Python installation anymore?\n\nA: From Xcode 11 Beta Release Notes:\n\nScripting language runtimes such as Python, Ruby, and Perl are included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software. In future versions of macOS, scripting language runtimes won’t be available by default, and may require you to install an additional package. If your software depends on scripting languages, it’s recommended that you bundle the runtime within the app. (49764202)\n\nSo in Catalina these runtimes will still be available. \nAlso, from the same document\n\nUse of Python 2.7 isn’t recommended. This version is included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software. Future versions of macOS won’t include Python 2.7. Instead, it’s recommended that you run python3 in Terminal. (51097165)\n\n\nA: I installed MacOS Catalina Beta and it was packaged with scripting languages like python (2.7) and ruby. Python3 was not available.\nSo probably they might remove it in the next major release (10.16) or they might remove it in the stable version of 10.15. In the former case, everything would function as expected, I believe.\n", "Q: What do I need to update a late 2012, 27\" iMac to SSD? I know I need this thermal sensor from OWC.\nI want a 2TB SSD disk. My question is: will any SSD disk fit inside a late 2012 iMac?\nDo I need any special frame to make it fit? \nI will be replacing the internal HD.\n\nA: Not \"any\" SSD: SSDs come in a wide range of shapes and connectors. But any SATA 2.5\" drive (in the same old form factor as Hard Drives) should work.\nThe tear-down instructions are found in iFixit. It is marked as \"difficult\". If it looks risky, you may want to just use an external SSD, connected by Thunderbolt, which should be sufficiently fast.\n", "Q: Where is macOS's incompatible apps blacklist stored? TinkerTool 5's System Maintenance pane has an app blacklist tab:\nhttps://www.bresink.com/osx/300644207-2/Docs-en/pgs/0110-Info.html\nIn this menu is a list of apps Finder will refuse to launch, because Apple thinks they're incompatible with the newest version of macOS. Apple is sometimes wrong—some of these apps will (mostly) work if launched via the Terminal. (One prominent example was iMovie HD in macOS Yosemite)\nWhere in the file system is this blacklist actually stored? Could a SIP-disabled machine make changes to it?\n\nA: On Catalina, the incompatible apps are likely determined programmatically when they reference any 32 bit libraries, so that’s an easy check. During installation and migration, the package that contains the blacklist is downloaded:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I upgrade from 10.12 to 10.13 High Sierra - where do incompatible items go?\nI’m not finding any remnants of that file left around - com.apple.pkg.CompatibilityUpdate but you can see things that are moved to the Incompatible Software folder at the root.\nAlso, for Catalina, there are efforts to package just enough libraries to run old favorite apps even though Apple isn’t shipping the libraries needed.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://tidbits.com/2019/09/18/moving-to-catalina-keep-your-32-bit-mac-apps-running-with-parallels/\n\n*https://www.parallels.com/blogs/catalina-32-bit-apps/\n\n*https://www.dpreview.com/news/1439854984/this-app-can-modify-aperture-and-iphoto-so-they-will-continue-to-work-with-macos-catalina\n\n*https://github.com/cormiertyshawn895/Retroactive\nSince Retrocative is open source, there’s hope interested people can log apps they want, contribute or fund people that are able to generate the code needed for preserving vintage bits on more modern OS.\n\nA: At least on High Sierra, the blacklist is stored in /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/Exceptions.plist\nAnd, yes, it can be edited, provided that System Integrity Protection is disabled. On Catalina, you will probably need to also remount the root filesystem as read write.\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of Exceptions.plist. Always backup system files before making changes!\n\n\n*Convert the file from a binary to an xml plist, so it can be edited. Easiest method is to run in Terminal: sudo plutil -convert xml1 /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/Exceptions.plist\n\n\n*Open Exceptions.plist in a text editor and find the bundle identifier of the app you want to run. Underneath the identifier should be a hardDisabled key which is set to true. Change the value to false, and save the file.\nYour change will not take effect immediately, and I do not understand what causes it to eventually work. Deleting the app and re-copying it from an installation—if applicable—appears to be the most effective method.\nThis process was tested in High Sierra with an old version of Final Cut (specifically version 10.1.4).\n", "Q: How are iOS apps protected from theft by other developers? An app can contain proprietary resources like a Core ML model that a developer spent a lot of time developing.\nAccording to this answer, \nthe app itself is not encrypted when it is downloaded to a device. What stops the developer of a competing app from taking the Core ML model and using it in his/her own app?\n\nA: Technically - not much. Legally and practically - a lot!\nYou can easily copy resources such as an ML model that someone spent a lot of resources on creating.\nHowever it is illegal to do so almost everywhere in the world, and you will be facing fines or other types of punishments if you cross that line and get caught.\nAnother factor is practically. Usually it is not of lasting value to have a copy of the end product. If you cannot refine it, improve on it, add to it or understand it, because you do not have all the other files, documents, and know-how that were used to create it in the first place - it’s really of limited value!\n", "Q: Bypassing Gatekeeper in macOS Mojave 10.14.5 At least until macOS Mojave 10.14.4, a user could run any application on a Mac, signed or not, by right clicking it in Finder and manually selecting Open.\nDoes this still work for all applications when running macOS Mojave 10.14.5, which has more strict code signing requirements (i.e. Notarisation)?\n\nA: Applications that have not gone thru Apple's Notarization process can't be run on Catalina and above.  According to Apple's information to developers:\n\nGatekeeper on macOS helps protect users from downloading and installing malicious software by checking for a Developer ID certificate from apps distributed outside the Mac App Store. Make sure to sign any apps, plug-ins, or installer packages that you distribute to let Gatekeeper know they’re safe to install. And now, you can give users even more confidence in your apps running on macOS Mojave by submitting them to Apple to be notarized.\n\nAs of this writing, there hasn't been any published way to go around the Notarization process to run applications.\nUpdate: To address concern about older software not running, Apple has also stated this in their Support doc:\n\nBeginning in macOS 10.14.5, all new or updated kernel extensions and all software from developers new to distributing with Developer ID must be notarized in order to run.\nApple recommends that you notarize all of the software that you’ve distributed, including older releases, and even software that doesn’t meet all of these requirements or that is unsigned. Apple’s notary service uses a variety of methods, including telemetry, to determine which of the above rules to relax for preexisting software.\n\nI'm reading that last quote to mean only new software and not existing code.  I think we need more clarification from Apple on what happens to existing applications.\n", "Q: Are USB ports on a Thunderbolt dock inherently more reliable than USB ports on a USB dock? This question refers specifically to the use of external 2.5\" drives, spinning or SSD.\nExternal drives on USB hubs we all know are very flaky, even for powered hubs.\nIt was surprising that I couldn't find an existing answer to this question. Quoting experience is one thing, but a technical reason why USB hubs are unreliable and why Thunderbolt is better (if it indeed is for this use case) would be excellent.\nIt's a Thunderbolt 2 dock I'd be looking to get, for a 2015 MBP, if that helps.\n\nA: I have a similar question, in trying to pick between different backup options. I saw the following on this OWC blog post - down in the comment section, where the author, an engineer/software developer at OWC, says:\n\nAPFS only protects the file system information from data corruption\n(e.g. the file name, size, modification date, etc.). It offers no\nprotection to the actual file data itself.\nThis only means that an APFS volume is less likely to become\nunmountable. It does not mean that your file is less likely to be\ncorrupted.\nIf your disk is in a USB enclosure (USB 3 or USB-C, formally known as\nUSB 3.1 Gen 2), then the I would switch to a Thunderbolt enclosure. We\nroutinely see more problems with USB enclosures.\n\nThe author further explained by saying:\n\nI would switch from USB to Thunderbolt if it were me (and both of my\npersonal enclosures are ThunderBay 4s). I know they are more expense\nbut they are definitely worth the money. There is a certain type of\nvolume corruption which we occasionally see, but we only ever see it\non USB enclosures. I don’t believe this data corruption is limited to\nSoftRAID volumes.\nI have never felt like USB storage software is a priority at Apple. We\nhave reported numerous bugs to them and most of the time we get back a\nresponse which indicates that they are not willing to address the\nproblem.\n\nAnd lastly:\n\nOnly you know how important your data is to you. If it were me, I\nwould Thunderbolt storage for at least one of your backups. In our\noffice, we have 4 copies of all important files. The onsite backups\nare all on Thunderbolt storage (RAID 1+0) and the offsite ones are on\nUSB-C. I don’t use USB 3.0 for single drives or RAID volumes and don’t\nuse USB-C for RAID volumes. USB-C seems to be okay when only a single\ndisk is involved.\nThis is just based on my experience. Your experience might be\ndifferent.\n\nAlthough his discussion relates to the choice of hard drive enclosures rather than external hubs, the reasons behind such flakiness might be pertinent to hubs as well.\n\nA: \nExternal drives on USB hubs we all know are very flaky, even for powered hubs.\n\nThis is not exactly accurate.  The reliability of USB Hubs/drives (any product for that matter) is directly related to the quality of the product.  Speaking from personal experience, I have found when I purchase from reputable brands, I rarely have issues.  Anecdotally, I still have an old USB 1.1, 3.5” HDD (must be about 20 years old now) with external power supply that still works.  It serves as an archival drive for an old Dell desktop running FreeBSD. The drive has been replaced twice.  The USB to IDE controller board works with zero issues.\nPowered Hubs\nPersonally, I rarely use bus powered hubs (they get their power from the USB port). I prefer to use powered hubs because they have the ability to provide a steady consistent stream of current.  Typically, the USB bus can handle up to 5 devices at 100mA or 500mA total (USB 2.0).\n500mA is typically enough for a 3.5” drive, but if it isn’t efficient (cheap components) it can easily overwhelm that, especially if you have other USB peripherals attached. I prefer to ensure there is adequate power with a powered hub and an externally powered drive.\nUSB vs Thunderbolt\n\n…a technical reason why USB hubs are unreliable and why Thunderbolt is better (if it indeed is for this use case) would be excellent.\n\nNot to belabor the point, but you’ll see unreliability in any product where the product strategy is based on being the cost leader.  A discount hub for $15 costs the distributor $7.50 and the manufacturer $1.50 for parts and labor.  Their goal is to maximize profitability and that means the cheapest (Chineseium) components they can source.\nA reputable brand that takes a more pragmatic approach to gaining market share will user better components, better manufacturing and labor thus leading to higher prices.\nSo, is USB unreliable whereas Thunderbolt is inherently so?  No.\nThunderbolt licensing was prohibitively expensive. The technology is more complex than USB and is thusly, more expensive. The Thunderbolt controller chips are only made by a handful of fabs so, that too contributes to the cost (supply and demand).\nUSB is ubiquitous and doesn't require certification to work or sell the product thus, is quite easy to flood the market with products. Almost any fab can churn out USB controllers for next to nothing.\nWhat unfortunately happens is the comparison of bargain basement USB up against mid to top-tier Thunderbolt products.  It’s not an apples-to-apples comparison by any stretch.  If you compare products of the same quality level, you’ll find that USB holds it own.\nTL;DR\n\nIt's a Thunderbolt 2 dock I'd be looking to get, for a 2015 MBP, if that helps.\n\nGet the Thunderbolt dock because it offers a greater range of expandability.  Remember it’s DisplayPort, PCIe, and USB on a single cable that is capable of daisy chaining peripherals.\nIf you don’t need that level of performance, USB is fine.  Just be sure to put quality as a priority when selecting a unit.\n", "Q: VoLTE Indication Wifi calling provides an indicator so that the user knows that wifi calling is engaged: very useful when roaming abroad.  \nIs there a similar indicator to enable the user to understand if VoLTE is engaged and not cellular: this would be helpful to understand if a call is using accruing roaming fees, when out of network. \n\nA: For me, it’s painfully obvious that the call quality is much better on VoLTE and FaceTime audio calls. \nThere is no indicator, so you’d need your carrier to break that out if you can’t record or tell from the higher quality and larger frequency range / response. \nIt’s of course possible a carrier could direct you to VoLTE and the codec degrade, so this isn’t a guarantee, but it is striking enough that I generally can hear the difference. \n", "Q: Limit iPad data when tethered to iPhone (iOS equivalent of \"Trip Mode\" or \"Little Snitch\") I am using an old iPhone to create a Wi-Fi hotspot when I need to work at my cabin.\nI found \"Trip Mode\" for limiting data usage from my MacBook; however, my iPad seems to be a little data-hog.\nIs there any way to limit the apps (directly on my iPad) that can use data while tethered to the iPhone? \ni.e. Is there an iOS equivalent of Trip Mode that I could install on the iPad?\nThis seems like something that many folks would need, but I can only find really old threads discussing it when I Google it.\n\nA: A simple Web search revealed this app which claims to monitor data usage on your iOS device.\n\n\n*\n\n*My Data Manager VPN Security\nSome of the features as listed in the app description are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Monitor your data usage on mobile, WiFi, and roaming\n\n*Find out which apps are eating up your mobile data\n\n*Get alerts before you reach your data limit to avoid overage fees\nThe app is available free of cost from the App Store.\nNote: No affiliation whatsoever with the developer of the app. Based on the app description and ratings, it appears like a useful app.\n", "Q: Is it necessary to \"Restore\" files from a Time Machine backup if I can already access them directly from the backup disk using Finder? I have an external hard drive that I've separated into two partitions: one that I use for additional file storage, and one that I use as a dedicated Time Machine backup disk. Something has gone wrong with the Time Machine partition, such that it will no longer mount, cannot be repaired, and cannot be erased on its own, neither by using Disk Utility nor through the command line directly, so I've decided to just erase and reformat the entire drive. \nI used Time Machine to backup the file storage partition onto a second external hard drive (by selecting the second external hard drive as my backup disk and excluding all volumes other than the file storage partition of the first external hard drive from the backup), with the plan of then restoring this backup onto the first external hard drive after it's been erased and reformatted.\nHaving never restored anything using Time Machine before (at least aside from after upgrading to a new version of macOS), I was expecting that the backup would be stored on the second hard drive in some sort of archive file-esque format, with the individual files being inaccessible until the backup has been properly \"Restored\" somewhere else using Time Machine. However, when I opened Finder after the backup had completed, I saw that the result was a lot more like I had just copied and pasted everything from the file storage partition onto the second external hard drive. \nAside from the fact that everything is stored within a folder called \"Backups.backupdb\", it really seems like I've effectively just transferred everything from the file storage partition of the first external hard drive onto this second external hard drive; the backup folder on the second drive is approximately the same size (just a few MBs larger) as what was stored on the file storage partition of the first drive, and every file I've tried to open from the second drive (pictures, pdfs, mp3s, etc.) has worked fine so far. \nSo, my question is, is there any reason I should bother \"Restoring\" this backup to the first hard drive, or can I just start using the second hard drive the same way I was using the file storage partition of the first hard drive before, and then just use the first hard drive for something else after I erase and reformat it? \nThe only potential issue I can currently see with doing the latter is that the backup folder on the second drive does seem to be in a sort of \"read-only\" mode, as I'm prompted to \"Authenticate\" with my password when I try to transfer a file into one of its subfolders, and maybe this is reason enough on its own to bother going through with \"Restoring\" the backup to the first drive. However, I don't really know much about the specifics of how Time Machine works, so I'm also interested to know if there are any other issues associated with using a Time Machine backup folder like a regular storage folder that I'm not aware of.\n\nA: No - you don't need to have two copies of the files you backed up.\nI think it's a good idea to restore all the files you want to have a backup copy of, however. Spotlight search will let you read / search all the files, but you have no safeguard for when the backup disk dies or fails, so your retention policy for everything you don't copy back is until that disk has a problem.\nFiles within Backups.Backupdb are intended to be read only, so you shouldn't expect to ever make changes there (or even be able to delete them) so if you can modify them - you have a backup that's disabled or malfunctioning and making a restore so you can set up a new backup is highly advisable.\n", "Q: Hidden Admin Account Appearing After Reboot I am new to Mac OS (using Mojave on a MacBook Air 2017) and am running into an issue.

I then changed login options  to \"display name and password\". When I logged out it seemed everything was fine. But after a reboot, both accounts showed up with their name. Is there anyway to prevent the admin account from showing up after a reboot?\nThanks all ~ \n\nA: Yes. You can disable file vault access for any accounts you don’t want to be capable to u lock FileVault or disable FileVault entirely. \nThe log in screen controls don’t govern FileVault since that renders from EFI before the os even starts. \n", "Q: How do I remove a disk image that I created myself? I went to disk utility and created a new image with 1.5 GB of my hard disk. \nNow I want to remove it and have all the space back for my Macintosh HD. Nothing seems to work. If I eject it, it's not completely gone because I can still go to File -> Open Disk Image and I can still see that image. \nHow should I completely remove it and restore everything to what it was before?\n\nA: The disk image itself is basically treated as a file by Finder. So, after ejecting the disk image (assuming you had it mounted), all you need to do is delete the disk image like like you would any other file. \nFor example, right-click on the disk image and select the Move to Trash option and then empty the trash. Likewise, you can just select it in Finder and use the commanddelete keyboard shortcut to move it to trash and then empty it.\n", "Q: What functionality is lost without LTE? According to Apple, A1660 and A1661 cannot do LTE in most of the world.  My experience suggests that many functions are unpleasantly slow or even impossible without LTE.  But I haven't been able to find an A1784 or A1778 in Oregon or on the Apple website.\nContacted Apple and got an \"expert\" who insisted the A1661 works anywhere in the world and seemed to think that web page was inaccurate.\nOnline descriptions of LTE suggest that there is no hard-and-fast number to describe its bit-rate.\nA related question suggests that I would not be happy with the CDMA choice, and the Apple page seems to say that for it  to work in Japan, I have to buy a model that is crippled anywhere else.  \nIf I get a CDMA iPhone 7, is there a reliable description of what kinds of apps will not work in Mexico City or Toronto or Madrid or Seoul or similar places?\n\nA: Yes. \nEvery iPhone has enough GSM frequencies to work with any carrier that wants to provide service and/or bill you international roaming. \nOf course, in bad coverage areas, higher frequency signals are much shorter range so the traditional CDMA frequencies work better in rural areas. \nWith 250 plus carriers in 150 countries, you’ll always have some pain in some places, but an iPhone that’s still in Apple support is basically a universal communicator for social, monetary and technical reasons. \nAnd in fact, after looking closer at the Apple page cited, we can see that the four models OP mentioned have exactly the same 41 bands.\n\nA: The Apple page you link to is a list of countries where each model is available to buy on contract, not where the LTE will work. All models support the same LTE bands, except for the Japan-only ones that support a couple of extra bands for the widest coverage in Japan, and will connect to LTE networks anywhere in the world — even Japan.

I hadn't used it for a while, but I'm trying to use it now. I was required to start from scratch with no apps or anything but many of the apps I had on there before are no longer compatible with such an old iOS. Most of them require 10 or higher which isn't an option for me. I am okay with downloading an older compatible version of the app, but that doesn't seem to be an option. I have seen a few others asking about this a few years back, but the solutions they got are no longer possible. How could I go about doing this?\nEDIT:\nI tried the response given here, but the option to download from the app store on iTunes store seems to have been removed. I don't see an option to get around it. \n\nA: If the app developer removed them from the App Store then you can't download them again.  \nIt's up to the app developer to continue to offer older versions of their app, not Apple.\nDuring the shift from 32-bit to 64-bit apps, developers had to change their old apps to comply with the architecture change in iOS.  Most did; some did not.  \n", "Q: macOS app review process: Touch Bar functionality in metadata I have a macOS app that get bug fixed. But the latest Apple review process drives me a bit insane. They always tell me that my app's metadata indicates Touch Bar functionality which my app do not have.\nSo my App have no Touch Bar functions, also it do not use any NSTouchBar methods. I actually never build any Touch bar app – so is there a capability or something that I could have possibly activated and what Apple now indicates there \"should\" be Touch Bar integration but there is none?\nI asked them where my metadata is indicating Touch Bar functionality but they only redirects me to the App Store Connect Developer Help. Which do not help me. Even when I search for Touch Bar there is no match.\nSo I have no idea what Apple want from me. I wrote them now that they maybe misread the description. I am using a Status Bar Menu in my App – maybe they had read \"Touch Bar\" instead of \"Status Bar\"...\nOr am I missing something that I have possibly accidentally activated?\nThis is the response from Apple:\n\nYour app does not achieve the core functionality described in your\n  app’s metadata.\nSpecifically, your app’s metadata is still indicating that your app is\n  using touchBar functionality.\nThe user is provided the option to select this functionality within\n  the app. Only after attempting to use this functionality is the user\n  told that it is not available without an additional install.

This is for me the $1 million question I’ve never had a certain answer about.\nI learnt long ago that in newer 32bit-64bit PCs the initial phase of the startup process is controlled by firmware and is later taken over by software (loaded from the Hard Drive or SSD into memory during boot) which controls the system from them on. The reason being that the software drivers will usually be more up-to-date and will run the system better than the initial firmware drivers necessary to boot the computer.\nAccording to this, the POST and initial image on the screen is controlled by firmware (software in a motherboard chip rather than loaded into Memory from the hard drive).\nMy doubt is whether this is also the case in Macs.\nThis is important in troubleshooting because it helps to narrow down whether software or firmware may be causing an issue (such as the display glitching at the beginning of the startup but not at the end of the boot or afterwards, after the software has taken over, which would hint the firmware is at fault rather than the software) or \"the screen glitching after boot can't be attributed to firmware as firmware is not running after boot\".\nMy doubt is if something different may be happening: such as “the initial image on the screen is controlled by software, because the software has already taken over”, which I think is probably not the case.\nI’d very much appreciate some wisdom on this.  \n\nA: The answer to this depends on what exactly you mean by \"controlled by\". \nIn particular it doesn't make sense to say that it is either controlled by \"firmware\" or \"software\" - as firmware is also software.\nYou can define \"controlled by\" in two interesting ways in this context: Either (a) when is the first software to be run loaded in from disk (i.e. non-firmware), or (b) when does control of the computer (i.e. primarily interrupts) transfer from the firmware to the operating system.\nIn either case it works the same way on a Mac as it does on a EFI PC (all modern PCs).\nIf you take definition (a) the change of control happens when the boot.efi file is loaded in from disk. That file is stored on disk in various places depending on your configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*HFS+ disk: /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi\n\n*HFS+ and FileVault 2: On a seperate non-encrypted partition\n\n*APFS (encrypted or not): //System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi or /usr/standalone/i386/boot.efi. on a seperate preboot volume \nIf you have a Mac with a T2-chip, additional validation can take place of the boot.efi before it is run, but essentially it is the same process.\nIn terms of what you see on the monitor during the boot process, the change of control has taken place (a) shortly before you see the FileVault login screen for encrypted HFS+ disks or (b) slightly after you see the white Apple logo on a black background on other systems.\nIf you instead take definition (b) the change of control happens when the operating system kernel is loaded in and executed. The operating system kernel is located in /System/Library/Kernels/kernel on the actual root volume. At this point the kernel installs a new interrupt table, and control of the CPUs and peripherals is now in the hands of the kernel.\nThis is in contrast to how it worked on older PCs (i.e. not Macs) with BIOS. In that case the BIOS was kept in place after the operating system was booted, and systems such as DOS used the BIOS to interface with the hardware.\nIn terms of what you see on the monitor during the boot process, the change of control has taken place shortly before you see the white progress bar or spinner indicating that the system is loading up.\n", "Q: Stuck during clean install on a new SSD on a late 2009 iMac I hope you might be able to help me out since I am completely stuck in my attempt to perform a clean install of High Sierra on a late 2009 iMac (model number A1311 – does not have Internet recovery) in which I have just inserted a brand new SSD right out of the box using the thermal HDD sensor from OWC. The old HDD got corrupted (or at least, that’s what I think happened), so I swapped it with a 500 GB SSD.\nFor obvious reasons, I did not clone the old drive. Instead I have prepared a 16 GB USB 2.0 with what should be a bootable version of High Sierra 10.13.6. I made this on a Windows 7 PC using TransMac and a High Sierra .dmg file. I haven’t been able to test if this has worked as intended as I do not have another Mac around.\nAnyway, when I switch on the iMac, I hear the familiar chime (so far so good – pre-testing passed) and then I get the expected blinking folder with a question mark on it. Now, I thought that I would be able to boot from the USB by holding the option key on startup to get to the Startup Manager, but the only thing that happens is that I get a mouse pointer (arrow), then nothing.  I haven’t had any success on any other startup key combinations – can’t activate verbose mode, either. I don’t know if verbose mode depends on a bootable drive, but with the old drive – after it failed – I could still get into verbose mode and was able to see part of the startup process until it got stuck.\nI have also tried installing from DVD by holding down C on startup, but it spits out the DVD after what appears to be a few attempts to read it (it does not have any scratches). I have tried the original install DVD (Snow Leopard) and a home-burned version of Yosemity. No success.\nThe keyboard I am using is an original USB-wired Mac keyboard and I have tested on another computer that the keys are working.\nAny ideas?  I’d be very helpful if someone with expertise in the quirks of late 2009 iMacs could suggest some other things to try. Thanks.\nEDIT:\nI forgot to mention that I have also tried resetting the NVRAM using the keys: Option-Command-P-R, but it didn't make any difference either.\n\nA: I would say you need to take your machine in for repair. You have detached all external devices that you can: with possible exception of mouse&keyboard?\nReset machine\nSometimes if volumes don't appear in Startup Manager (what you get when you hold down the Option key at startup), you need to reset the Mac's PRAM, NVRAM. Shut down the Mac, then power it up, and before the screen lights up, quickly hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys,( I hold down the keys before pressing the power on button, but requires some contortion. )  until the Mac has chimed twice more after the powerup chime. \nAndy Betts  lists machine specific variants for this procedure in this article:\nhttps://www.makeuseof.com/tag/reset-macs-smc-pram/ \n", "Q: Android message merge with iCloud Message history I had an iPhone, and used iMessages with iCloud enabled. Then I switched to an Android for a while, which contains new messages. I've now switched back to an iPhone, and am trying to migrate these new text messages into the iMessages app on my new iPhone.\nMy first try was to restore my new iPhone from my last iCloud backup, and use the dr.fone tool to import these messages, but they did not appear.\nSecond try was to reset the iPhone (so not logged into my iCloud), and copy the messages to it with the same tool. This worked fine until I logged into iCloud to upload these messages and they vanished.\nDoes anyone have a solution to this, that will end up with my existing Messages history intact, with any new messages being migrated across and synced properly into Messages in iCloud?\n\nA: For the record, Apple's Move to iOS app does work. In the end, I had to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Borrow an old Android phone (i.e. pre Android 9).\n\n*Transfer the messages to that from my Android phone using SMS Backup and Restore.\n\n*Reset the iPhone so the Move Data from Android option was available – only possible when first setting up the phone.\n\n*Use Move to iOS app on the old Android phone to copy messages to iPhone.\n\n*Sign into iCloud on the iPhone to enable Messages in iCloud, which then merged the newly transferred messages with the ones already present in iCloud – I've confirmed that this has worked as the imported messages have synchronized to other devices.\n\n\nThe Move to iOS actually still wouldn't restore to my iPhone XR, so I had to restore to a borrowed older iPhone, then backup that and restore it on the new iPhone… Apple last updated this app in March 2016, predating the iPhone 7, 8/X, XS/XR generations, so hopefully it will get some attention soon to fix these issues, as not everyone will be able to borrow other devices to go through this process!\n", "Q: Transfer custom ringtones to iPhone using a computer running Linux I received an iPhone 7 from my employer. I am traditionally an Android user and have never used iPhone before. I have Linux running on my PCs at home. \nHow can transfer ringtones from PC to iPhone easily? I have read scattered posts about this, but most people seem to be doing this via Windows or macOS. I am using Linux Mint. I have Audacity installed on my Linux computer, and I am quite comfortable working with audio files.\n\nA: Getting ringtones onto an iPhone is one of those things that's never been as easy as you'd expect.\nMight be because Apple never thought it was important. Might be because Apple also sells ringtones in the iTunes store. Whatever the reason, fact is, there aren't a lot of ways to do it.\nI don't know of any Linux way of getting them on the iPhone directly.\nI believe that the iOS app GarageBand is the only app on the iPhone capable of adding a custom ringtone. Therefore, if you can get your ringtone from your Linux machine onto your iPhone (perhaps by emailing it to yourself and then using the \"Share\" feature on the iPhone to send it to GarageBand, that might work.\nGarageBand is a very large app, but it's free, so worth checking out, I'd say.\n\nA: Unfortunately, transferring audio files to an iPhone isn't an easy process and requires jumping through a few hoops. I'm going to assume that the audio you currently have is stored on your PC as an MP3, as this is the de-facto standard for audio, though the steps should be similar for other audio formats like FLAC.\nThe first step is to take your media file and convert is to the AAC format; this can be done with FFmpeg, which you should be able to install from your package repository, though there are also GUI tools available if you're unfamiliar with the command-line. Once this is done, the conversion can be performed by:\nffmpeg -i [file-to-convert].mp3 ringtone.aac\n\nThis will spew out some text about the file, but afterwards, you will be left with a converted audio file. However, before it can be put on your phone, you need to rename the file so that its extension is .m4r and shorten it to under 40 seconds, otherwise iTunes will not recognise it as a ringtone.\nTransferring the ringtone to your phone is the more difficult part - iTunes is not officially supported on Linux and doesn't appear to work too well with Wine (though there's no harm in trying this out). Therefore, instead you may have to get access to iTunes through:\n\n\n*\n\n*An old laptop or Apple desktop you might be able to run iTunes on\n\n*Access to Apple or Windows devices at your local library\n\n*A friend or colleague who would be willing to yet you borrow their device for half an hour\n\n*An old copy of Windows you could load up in a virtual machine\nOnce you do have iTunes up and running, you should be able to connect your iPhone to that device and simply drag and drop the ringtone.m4r file you created earlier onto the Tones tab under your phone on iTunes. After the file transfers, it should appear in the list of ringtones on your phone.\n\nA: You'll need a computer running iTunes desktop app to transfer custom ringtones to your iPhone. Currently, iTunes desktop app is only available for Windows and macOS.\nIt is not possible via any means to transfer an iPhone compatible ringtone file to your iPhone via a computer running Linux.\nIf you do not wish to use any of the stock ringtones built into iPhone, you can purchase one using the iTunes app installed on your iPhone.\n\nA: You don't need iTunes. \nI can't stand iTunes on OSX or Windows. I've been successful running a Windows program called CopyTrans Manager (copytrans.net) that lets you add and delete music, audio books, and ringtones on your iPhone, or iPod for free. Their paid versions allow you to copy music FROM your iOS device to a computer, and other things. Upon installation, CopyTrans does ask for the location of the iTunes installer (or it will download it for you). CopyTrans doesn't install iTunes, but it extracts several necessary files and drivers from the installer to work.\nNot sure if CopyTrans Manager will install via wine since it also dependent on iTunes installer, but it's worth a shot. If successful, then it's the usual drill of converting the source ringtone file. Use a program like Audacity or just command line to convert .mp3 to .m4a and then rename the .m4a file .m4r. Run CopyTrans Manager and drop the .m4r file on it and it will automatically recognize it as a ringtone. Then just sync, which only take a few seconds for a small ringtone file, and then eject the phone. Done. Select the new ringtone in iOS settings. \n", "Q: iPhone: Game app able to access Photos without permission I have downloaded a game from the App Store onto my iPhone. My understanding is that apps need to ask for, and be granted or denied,  permission to access iCloud, Photo gallery etc.\nBut in this game, there is an option to change the profile picture, and when I tap on it, it accesses my Photo gallery and I can change the profile picture from images in my gallery.\nIn Settings, I don’t see that there is any Photo gallery access permission for this app.\nWhat exactly is happening in the background? Does iPhone treat game apps different from normal apps?\nThe app in question is a game called Word Domination.\n\nA: The app in question is presenting a system provided UIImagePickerController to choose image for setting as user's profile picture.\nFrom the PhotoKit Apple Developer documentation, Requesting Authorization to Access Photos:\n\nWhen using the UIImagePickerController to bring up the user's photo library, your app doesn't need to request permission explicitly.\n\nThis behavior is by design since iOS 11. UIImagePickerController runs in a separate process from the app, and doesn't directly get to read the Photo gallery data. Thus, for read only access to photos, no special permission is required.\nThis explains why you don't get the see an alert seeking permission to Photos, and the same isn't displayed under app preferences in Settings app. The user is explicitly setting the picture and the app couldn't read the Photo gallery directly.\n", "Q: what can an adult do with Family Sharing? I'm told that some children have iPhones, that are part of 'the same iCloud' as a parent.

Is this Family Sharing?  Can the adult account view all communication (e.g. WhatsApp, Skype, Discord) on the linked children accounts, or just that on Apple apps?  Can the adult delete photos on the linked accounts?\n\nA: The scenario you describe is what Family Sharing is designed to avoid. \nEach person should have their own iCloud account, then each person's data is exclusive to them, but apps/books/music/calendars can, at the parents' discretion, be allowed to be used on the children's devices.\nThat's just the apps, not the data on those apps.\n\nA: Messages will be synced across all devices logged in with the same AppleID ('the same iCloud'). To prevent that, have each kid set up their own AppleID and use that.

Embedded is explained by Apple here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2435/_index.html\nUsually on development machines, you install internal dependencies such as libraries through the use of build scripts or build steps addded in Xcode.

I have a Linux Distro duel booting on my Mac which I deleted trying to resize the partitions. I pressed the option key (alt in my case) so I could get the boot options because it will automatically boot Linux if I don't.\nWhen the hard drives come up after pressing the option key, I could not find my Mac OS partition. I also erased my Linux files (not the partition because I couldn't as mentioned above) so I clicked on the Linux hard drive named EFI boot hoping to have the Mac OS somehow moved to the Linux partition, but as expected it comes up with a bash shell and doesn't load anything. \nLuckily I can live boot Linux on my Mac and I still have the partition so I might try to install Linux on the partition, but I wanted my macOS back so I did the recovery mode alt + R which didn't work, just completely bypassed my keys and went to the hard drive with nothing on it.

You know, in SE markup language in the editor, a row of hyphens is useful.  You can either make a headline by putting a row of hyphens under a short line, or you can create a horizontal rule with a line of hyphens separated by white space.  \nWhen I try that in iOS 12, I get this\n———\nOr this \nHeadline\n———\nNote that I have hit \"hyphen\" six times and gotten 3 dashes.   And it does not work.  No horizontal rule (all the way across). No headline.\nThe problem is, they're not real hyphen-minuses from 7-bit ASCII.  They are some sort of typographical oddity - em space dash, en space dash, whatever.  I see I can also hold the hyphen key and it will give me the options for em space dash  and en space dash.  None are a hyphen!\nHow do I tape a plain ASCII hyphen-minus in iOS 12? \nI realize this is a bit of an XY, but I need plain hyphens for lots of other things too.  \nEdit: Forgot to mention, I need to do this on other people's iPads, so it is not my purview to arbitrarily and permanently reconfigure their iPad to my tastes.  Besides I am not opposed to typographical features, I just need to use StackExchange from time to time. \n\nA: If you have the SE app, you can do it easily there, as it’s one of the shortcuts on the editing row. \nAnother option (that also works in-browser), possibly faster than deleting spaces, is: \n\n\n*\n\n*Type a hyphen\n\n*Copy it\n\n*Paste repeatedly\n\n\nThis will also sidestep the smart punctuation. \n(As pointed out in comments...)\nFor further efficiency, you can copy-paste increasingly longer blocks of hyphens until you get the length you need. Then, once you have a full set, you can copy it once and carry it with you in the clipboard, allowing you to reuse it easily throughout the answer. \n\nA: In addition to what's been mentioned already, you can tap the microphone and say \"hyphen hyphen hyphen hyphen hyphen hyphen\". \n\nA: Turning off Smart Punctuation (in Settings → General → Keyboard) allows me to type multiple hyphens without them being converted to em-dashes.\n(Side note: here's a post by the creator of Markdown about this feature.)\n\nAs far as I can tell, this setting has two effects:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change repeated hyphens to dashes\n\n*Change quotes and apostrophes to smart, locale-aware quotes (e.g., \"\" will become «» when the language is set to French).\n\n\nThese can't be toggled independently. The Apple help article for Numbers on iPad explicitly says:\n\nNumbers automatically converts double hyphens (--) to dashes (—) and\n  converts straight quotation marks to curly quotation marks as you\n  type. You can turn this setting off or on at any time.\nNote: The setting affects both hyphens and quotation marks—they’re\n  both either off or on.\n[...]\nTip: To use different formatting for specific text, change the\n  setting, type the text, then change the setting back.\n\n(Even though it says \"Numbers automatically converts [...],\" the setting is the same: Settings → General → Keyboard → Smart Punctuation. It's not specific to Numbers.)\nThis blog post suggests developers can turn this off selectively:\n\nA first step, if using a UITextInputTraits conforming control, would\n  be to set smartQuotesType to UITextSmartQuotesTypeNo, and set\n  smartDashesType to UITextSmartDashesTypeNo.\n\n\nIf it's only about Markdown, you don't need to change any settings. Alternate syntax is available for both headers and horizontal rules:\n# Header 1\n## Header 2\n\n- - -\n***\n____\n\nGives:\n\nHeader 1\nHeader 2\n\n\n\n\nThat last uses underscores (_).\n\nA: If you don't want to turn off Smart Punctuation as suggested in muru's answer, you can type a space between each hyphen then go back and delete the spaces. The hyphens will not be changed into typographic dashes.\nThe obvious suggestion would be to set up a text replacement in Settings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement, so that (for example) typing 4dash gave you a sequence of four hyphens, but that doesn't seem to work either, at least on iOS 12.3.1. I tried a couple of different international keyboards and also dictating 'dash'es or 'hyphen's by voice, and none of those got the desired result. \nThe only other thing I can think of to suggest is to install a third-party keyboard, but I don't use any so I don't know how they interact with Smart Punctuation.\n", "Q: How to import photos from new iPad 5 Mini to old 2015 MacBook Air, OSX 10.9.5 I'm trying to import photos from a new iPad that uses the newer Photos app to an old 2015 MacBook Air (OSX 10.9.5) that only has the old iPhotos app, but it's not working.\nI keep getting an error on the Macbook saying I need a passcode on the iPad, but there's no request for a passcode on the iPad, and I've already selected 'Trust'. \n\nA: Apple say that this iPad requires OS X 10.11.6 or later and iTunes 12.8 or later to sync with a Mac, so I'm going to guess that you're out of luck trying to use it with iPhoto.\nYou could try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Seeing if you can download the photos using the Image Capture app on the Mac (Launchpad > Other, or find it in the Applications folder)\n\n*Transferring the photos via a service such as Dropbox\n\n*Upgrading the Mac to a more recent version of macOS - it should be easily capable of running the latest version and give you a better experience all round. 10.9.5 is pretty old now and is no longer supported with security updates etc, so it's a good idea to upgrade.

Will Apple use the same examination criteria or is it more shallow?\nBeta submission ready via AppCenter..\n\n\nA: Yes, submitting your app via TestFlight for public beta testing serves that purpose. The app will undergo a review, albeit a smaller review than the ordinary App Store review. You do not need to actually release your app for beta testing to any third party (except Apple) - you can choose to get it approved and then do nothing.\nSimilarly you can submit your app for the App Store to get the full review done. There's no need for you to actually make the app public on the App Store right away - you can keep it out of the App Store for as long as you like - and publish only when you're ready. It is also possible to update the app before publishing - although the update will then have to undergo review as well.\nYou do not have to worry about your official submission being \"tarnished\". If Apple rejects the app, you have plenty of options for changing the app and resubmitting for a new review.\nIn the interest of saving time, it is however a good idea to make sure that the app follows the new guidelines before submitting them it to review.\n", "Q: Cannot get 60 Hz on MBPr 13\" 2018 I connect my Macbook Pro 13\" 2018 with Mojave 10.14.5 to the external display Fujitsu P27-8 TS UHD via adapter Dell DA301. All the components of this chain are capabale of 4k@60Hz. However, I can only get 30 Hz, both on HDMI and DisplayPort cables.\nI can only get 60 Hz, if I low the resolution down to 1280x720!\nI tried to use cscreen, which did not give me anything, and SwitchResX, which is not easy to use at all.\nBoth of these solutions did not work for me.\nDoes anybody have success forcing 60 Hz on Macbook Pro 13\" 2018 with Mojave?\nThanks!\n\nA: The problem is your Dell DA300 adapter (I assume you mean this one, as the DA301 does not exist). This adapter requires DisplayPort 1.3/1.4 in order to drive 4k at 60 Hz, otherwise it drops down to 30 Hz. This is detailed in the manual for the DA300.\nThe MacBook Pro 13\" 2018 does not have hardware support for DisplayPort 1.4, but only provided DisplayPort 1.2. Only the 15\" model has hardware support for that. Similarly you monitor only supports DisplayPort 1.2.\nThe monitor however does have support for HDMI 2.0, which is the minimum version necessary to support 4k at 60 Hz. Sadly, HDMI 2.0 is not supported on USB-C. As this adapter is USB-C, it won't be able to input a HDMI 2.0 signal. Had it been a Thunderbolt 3 adapter, that would have been a possibility - but it is not.\nYou might notice that the adapter is advertised as HDMI 2.0. The way this works is that the adapter takes in the DisplayPort signal over USB-C and converts that to HDMI 2.0 itself. Obviously as we've just established that the DisplayPort signal in this case does not support 4k @ 60 Hz, then neither will it support that when converted into HDMI.\nIn order to achieve 4k at 60 Hz, you can just use an ordinary cable (i.e. not an adapter) from the Thunderbolt 3 port on the MacBook Pro to the DisplayPort port on the monitor.\n", "Q: Why does rm in zsh abort?

On mac it doesn't even start the rm-command, after it can't complete the cdn-wildward. How do I get zsh to ignore the missing files?\n\nA: With the zsh, the (very sane) default is to error on globs that can't be expanded to existing files. In other shells, the usual default is to leave the glob untouched (which may or may not be the right thing to do depending on the command - and it may very well be a very wrong thing to do). I suspect your Linux configuration has this overridden somewhere to follow the behaviour of other shells.\nIf you're using zsh on both shells, IMHO the best option would be to qualify globs that are allowed to expand to nothing using the (N) qualifier:\n% echo .zshc*\nzsh: no matches found: .zshc*\n% echo .zshc*(N)\n\n%\n\nOf course, you can change this behaviour globally. Pick whichever of the following most suits your needs:\nsetopt nullglob # all globs can expand to nothing\nsetopt +o nomatch # leave globs as-is instead of reporting error\n\n\nA: By default, in zsh, if a wildcard pattern doesn't match anything, zsh signals an error and doesn't run the command. Note that the error comes from zsh, not from rm.\nThis is usually a useful feature, since in many cases, if you use a wildcard pattern, you intend for it to match something. However, in scripts (and more generally in automated processes such as your alias), it's common to process all the files that match a certain pattern, and if no files match, then you just do nothing. You can use the N glob qualifier for that. For example:\nfor x in *.dat(N); do\n  rm -- $x\ndone\n\nIf you are writing a function or script where all the wildcard patterns fit this usage, you can turn on the null_glob option. This is essentially equivalent to putting (N) at the end of every wildcard pattern.\nThe best way to make your alias work in zsh is to turn it into a function and set the null_glob option locally. The reason it has to be a function is that you need to do something more complex than run a command with some predefined arguments: you also need to temporarily set an option. You should also pass the -f option to rm and not ignore errors from it. This way you'll see if something fails, for example because you don't have permission to delete the files. You'll see no output in normal cases, whether some files happen to get deleted or not.\nclean_some_files () {\n  setopt local_options null_glob\n  rm -f broyd  broyd.7 cdn* *.dat *.npy stars wkf2  fleurinputschema.xsd judft_times juDFT_times.json  inf out  out.xml  usage.json struct.xsf juDFT_times FleurInputSchema.xsd mixing_history*\n}\n\nWhen you have multiple patterns, there's also the csh_null_glob option. The difference with null_glob is that if you have a series of patterns, zsh still signals an error if none of the patterns match. For example cat *.txt *.md works as long as there is at least either a .md file or .txt file, and signals an error if there is none (as opposed to the null_glob behavior which would run cat with no arguments). I recommend turning this option on in your .zshrc:\nsetopt csh_null_glob\n\nThere's also a nomatch option which is on by default (except when zsh is emulating sh or ksh). If you turn it off, zsh will leave non-matching patterns alone instead of raising an error. This is convenient when you're using wildcard characters in something that isn't meant to be a wildcard pattern, for example a URL containing ?. But it's also error-prone, so I recommend keeping nomatch on.\n", "Q: How to remove default open application I have downloaded file darwin_amd64 and occasionally chosen Text Edit as its default application.

I'm always redirected to the main site configured on the host My NEW server IP address is 123.456.789.123.\nPointing my browser to 123.456.789.123 (http://123.456.789.123) the server serves me site alpha.\nNow, on the same NEW server I've configured a second site: beta.\nSite beta is still online served from my OLD server with IP 321.987.654.321.\nSo, to reinstall and reconfigure it on the NEW server, I edited my hosts file this way, so it calls the NEW server when I go to domain beta.com:\n##\n# Host Database\n#\n# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface\n# when the system is booting. Do not change this entry.\n##\n127.0.0.1 localhost\n255.255.255.255 broadcasthost\n::1 localhost\n123.456.789.123 beta.com www.beta.com\n\nThe problem is that when I point my browser to http://www.beta.com, I see alpha.com on the New server, the same site I see if I go to http://123.456.789.123 (this is the NEW server).\nSo, practically, the hosts file correctly points me to the NEW server, but instead of showing me the site beta.com, shows me always the site alpha.com.\nOn 123.456.789.123, I have two different vhosts file: one for alpha and one for beta.\nThis is the vhost for alpha:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    ServerName alpha.com\n    ServerAlias www.alpha.com\n\n    ServerAdmin my.email@gmail.com\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/alpha.com/public_html\n\n    ErrorLog /var/www/alpha.com/log/error.log\n    CustomLog /var/www/alpha.com/log/access.log combined\n\n    <Directory /var/www/alpha.com>\n        AllowOverride All\n    </Directory>\n</VirtualHost>\n\nThis is the vhost for beta:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    ServerName beta.com\n    ServerAlias www.beta.com\n\n    ServerAdmin my.email@gmail.com\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/beta.com/public_html\n\n    ErrorLog /var/www/beta.com/log/error.log\n    CustomLog /var/www/beta.com/log/access.log combined\n\n    <Directory /var/www/beta.com>\n        AllowOverride All\n    </Directory>\n</VirtualHost>\n\nAny ideas about how can I see the site beta when pointing my browser (and my hosts file) to the NEW server?\nIt seems that the hosts file simply calls 123.456.789.123, but without passing the domain I'm asking for and so the server responds with the default one and not with the site I'm asking for: beta.com.\n\nA: Your reasoning about the hosts file is actually not how it works. The hosts file is only responsible for providing a mapping from the hostname (alpha.com) to an IP - it doesn't have any influence on which hostname the browser sends to the webserver for virtual hosting.\nIf you do actually end up on the new server, you have an error in your web server configuration so that virtual hosting is either not enabled or misconfigured. Depending on the version of Apache you're running, you might for example need to add a \"NameVirtualHost *:80\" line to the configuration. It could also be that you have a typo in the ServerName and/or ServerAlias lines. It is impossible to tell from your question, as you haven't provided the actual configuration.\nIf you instead end up on the old server, the problem is that your browser is not using the hosts file (i.e. it is not using the system default name resolver). An easy way to get around that is simply to use a different browser. You might also be running into caching if you have made a lot of changes and tests with the hosts file. A very easy manner of testing that is simply to reboot the Mac. You can also flush the cache, which you can find instructions on how to here on AskDifferent depending on your macOS version.\n", "Q: keyboard cover for iPad Mini 2019 (gen 5) I recently bought an iPad Mini 5. I'm now trying to find a keyboard cover/stand that I can use to more easily watch videos and play games without having to constantly support the screen. I know Logitech makes them but they haven't yet come out with a model that supports gen 5 (reference?), and I was told by a store clerk at a local retailer that the Gen 4 models aren't compatible since hardware buttons have moved (which buttons - the key caps?).

When a Time Machine backup is running and the computer goes to sleep, it triggers a few different annoying issues.\nFirst, I can no longer seem to eject the partitions properly. I get an error saying that the drive is in use. The application What’s Keeping Me? tells me that mds and its related processes are keeping the drive from unmounting, but no matter how many times I kill the processes they return and makes it impossible to unmount.\nSecond, it seems that the drive will continually mount and unmount during sleep, which is terrifying. When I open the computer again, I see a whole bunch of notifications that I manually have to dismiss (Norwegian OS in the image).\n\nThird, Time Machine gives me an error saying it couldn’t complete the backup, and I have to force an unmount and replug the drive for it to work properly again.\nI’ve excluded Spotlight from indexing the external drive, excluded Time Machine from backing up the other external partitions, there is no sleep timer on the WD drive itself, but Power Nap is enabled. What should I do?\nEdit: ‘Put hard drives to sleep when possible’ is unchecked in System Preferences.\n\nA: To answer my own question:\nMost likely the issue was caused by the WD Driver Utility app, as reported by many in the WD forums.\nIf not that, it was caused by an unpowered 7x USB-A to USB-C hub that the HDD was connected to earlier.\nEither way the problem is now gone.\n", "Q: How to run the \"Build Phase\" in Xcode as root ALL,\nThis post is spawned by this question\nIn my Xcode I added the new Build Phase to copy .dylib files to /usr/local/lib. And then I tried to rebuiold the application by doing \"Command + B\".\nHowever, since the destination should be accessed thru the root account I received an error couldn't create directory /usr/local/lib: Permission denied.\nThis is correct as the Xcode is started by the regular user and not root. So now I am looking for a way to execute just this build phase as root.\nIn the question mentioned above I got a direction that OSX is a *nix and the process is the same. While I agree that OSX is a *nix, the process of building/installing are different. On *nix you issue make as a regular user, just as you do Command + B in Xcode. But then when it finishes building in *nix you issue a separate command sudo make install, which installs all the libraries and binaries in /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/bin. All IDE on *nix (such as Anjuta and KDevelop) has extra menu to it which when selected ask about the root password and perform the install as root\nAnd so what I am looking for is for Xcode to ask me about the root password in order to execute this Build Phase I added to copy my dylib's, because I am not familiar with this IDE.\nTIA!\n[EDIT]\nIgors-MacBook-Air:~ igorkorot$ ls -la /Users/igorkorot/dbhandler/dbhandler/Build/Products/Debug/\ntotal 17344\ndrwxr-xr-x  13 igorkorot  staff      416 Jun  9 18:35 .\ndrwxr-xr-x@  4 igorkorot  staff      128 Nov 16  2018 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 igorkorot  staff       96 Jun 10 20:05 dbhandler.app\n-rwxr-xr-x   1 igorkorot  staff   129856 Jun  9 18:34 liblibdbloader.dylib\n-rwxr-xr-x   1 igorkorot  staff  1002940 Jun  9 18:35 liblibdbwindow.dylib\n-rwxr-xr-x   1 igorkorot  staff  1671068 Jun  9 18:35 liblibdialogs.dylib\n-rwxr-xr-x   1 igorkorot  staff   148244 Jun  9 18:34 liblibfieldswindow.dylib\n-rwxr-xr-x   1 igorkorot  staff   587976 Jun  9 18:33 liblibmysql.dylib\n-rwxr-xr-x   1 igorkorot  staff   799272 Jun  9 18:33 liblibodbc.dylib\n-rwxr-xr-x   1 igorkorot  staff   611680 Jun  9 18:33 liblibpostgres.dylib\n-rwxr-xr-x   1 igorkorot  staff   482852 Jun  9 18:33 liblibpropertypages.dylib\n-rwxr-xr-x   1 igorkorot  staff  1619172 Jun  9 18:34 liblibshapeframework.dylib\n-rwxr-xr-x   1 igorkorot  staff  1810304 Jun  9 18:33 liblibsqlite.dylib\n\nAnd so I tried to add LD_LIBRARY_PATH as /Users/igorkorot/dbhandler/dbhandler/Build/Products/Debug/, but trying to run it (dbhandler.app) from inside Xcode, the program still crashes.

Apparently I was wrong.\n[/EDIT]\n[EDIT2]\nPlease refer to the screenshot below.\n[/EDIT2]\n[EDIT3]\nAnd this is how it looks like in Xcode:\n[/EDIT3]\n\n\n\nA: Like I mentioned in your previous question, you need to use “sudo” in front of your copy command to get it to run. Just like you run “sudo make install” on Linux.\nTo get this working easily, I will suggest setting up sudo so that no password is necessary to run that specific command.\nAnother possibility is to use an AppleScript instead of a shell script - that will allow you to pop up the graphical dialog asking for the sudo password.\nA different option is setting your buildscript as suid root, so you do not need to use sudo at all.\nIf you can make do with an alternative that is not centered about installing in /use/local/lib, I would strongly recommend not installing your library there - instead install it in the application bundle. \nFor Xcode you can set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH / DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables to include your build directory, so you do not have to copy the library anywhere. You set environment variables by choosing the menu item Product => Scheme => Edit scheme... And then under \"Run\" and \"Arguments\" you'll find \"Environment Variables\".\nFor distribution I would recommend using run-path libraries that work by telling the dynamic linker that it should look for the library within the application bundle (or where you choose). The docs on that are available here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/DynamicLibraries/100-Articles/RunpathDependentLibraries.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008306-SW1\n", "Q: U.S. Layout § Symbol I bought my MBP with Turkish layout and I am using in U.S. layout.

I have many events that recur on two-week time spanned schedules.  For example, I have several things that happen based on a two-week period where these things repeat on: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday, Thursday, Friday... and then starts over.\nHere's a visual example, of what some repeating events could be in a two-week schedule (I left off AM/PM as this is just to give some visual help and doesn't reflect the precision of a real schedule):\n\nIt seems that there are a lot of calendars that have the weekly repeating option for days, including the iOS Clock.app, but I really need to set these times out within a two-week pattern as you can see that keeps repeating forever.\nIs there a calendaring mechanism on macOS and iOS that facilitates creating indefinitely recurring alarms and reminders on such two-week rotations?\n\nA: The app you are looking for is Due which can set up repeating reminders as you have described, AND (most importantly) it can repeat its reminder alarm every X minutes until it is marked \"done\" (at which point it will reset for the next occurrence). I use this for reminding me to take out the trash, which needs to be done every other Wednesday, for example.\n\nA: Both macOS and iOS support \"custom\" repeat intervals that are somewhat flexible. \nBased on reading your clarification, it doesn't sound like you need anything beyond a simple 2-week repeat interval per event but you may need more than one event if the days for the event occurrences in even-numbered weeks are not the same as the days for the event occurrences in odd-numbered weeks.\nWhen creating a new event (see image below), select the repeat option.  On the repeat menu, select the Custom... option.  Set the frequency to weekly, but set the repeat interval to 2 weeks and then select the day(s) of the week for that particular event.\nIn the image below I repeat the event on just one day per week, but it is possible to select multiple days.  \nIf an event occurs on one set of days in odd number weeks (week 1, 3, 5, etc.) but it occurs on different days in event number weeks (week 2, 4, 6, etc.) then you would likely need to clone your event from week one to create a new event for week two ... and then set the repeats for those at 2-week frequencies.\n\n", "Q: Why is my ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist \"damaged\"?

I'd like to either force App Store to save my password, or have it automatically entered (just for the Mac App Store password prompt) when it asks for my password.

How can I force App Store to extend the duration of saving to indefinite, despite that it's designed to save the password for 15 minutes?\nNote that I know this isn't the case for free apps. I want to purchase apps without having to enter my password. Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: This is by design. It is meant to ensure that you indeed are verifying the purchase, especially since it involves money.\nIf you find entering password painful, consider setting up Touch ID (only applicable on MacBooks equipped with Touch ID) to authorize App Store purchases. \nTo configure, go to System Preferences → Touch ID and enable for iTunes & App Store. Also, go through this Apple Support document:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Touch ID on your Mac\nIn case your Mac doesn't have Touch ID hardware, consider using a password manager. A password manager lets you create, save and manage strong passwords for app and websites, and enter it for you automatically. This way you get both convenience without compromising on security.\nThere are many good third party password manager apps for Mac to securely store your password, so you can copy and paste it if for some reason you don't trust the keychain from Apple.\nSearch the Web for password manager for Mac.\n", "Q: Change shortcut for switching to the next most recently used app among your open apps in MacOS From the Mac keyboard shortcuts page\nI found shortcut for switching to the next most recently used app among your open apps : Command-Tab.\nI want to change it to Option-Tab.\nDoes anyone know name of this shortcut so I can add a new shortcut key as Option-Tab in App Shortcuts\n\nA: Not sure if this is what you wanted, but here's a possible solution without using any third party apps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard\n\n*Click on Modifier Keys...

Prior to updating to Mojave, everything was working correctly.

I know how to set up the cellular connection with my iPhone. What I want is to combine the bandwidth of that cellular connection and my ISP, and keep access to the other devices on my local network. Is that possible?\n\nA: In theory, it is possible. Practically, it's not worth the bother for most, if not all, home users.\nIn order to fully combine the bandwidth (i.e. without having restrictions on single connections), you would need to have a \"partner\" server on the Internet that you can communicate with trough your local ISP and through your cell connection. That partner proxies all traffic to/from your network - essentially combining the data from both internet connections and sending it on as one.\nFor that to work you also need a specialized network device on your home network that is placed in between your local network and your router and the cellular connection. It splits up traffic and sends it on to the proxy server (and vice versa for incoming traffic from the proxy server). \nAll in all, it requires specialized knowledge about networks to set this up, it requires additional equipment on your home network, and it requires a server on the internet. This is usually relatively costly to come by, so it's not really worth it to add a smaller amount of extra bandwidth to a home user connection.\nLarger companies (as well as smaller companies specializing in something that requires specialized network access) implement something somewhat similar by the way of BGP routing. This allows having multiple paths to the Internet, and to be reachable through multiple paths at the same time. However, it also requires you to have your own autonomous system number (AS-number). It is free, but takes time to apply for. As well as requiring your to have your own set of routable IP-addresses (usually PI for smaller setups, and PA for larger). These IPs are getting harder to come by. Usually you would need to have at least a /24 (i.e. 256 IP-addresses) in order for this to work at all - probably even more today. If you have a use case where IPv6 only is enough, the requirements are a lot easier to fulfill. However you still need to have corporation from both ISPs in order to make it work.\n", "Q: I have two bootcamp partitions but not my original 500GB I have a mid 2014 MacBook Pro running Mojave.

Then reinstall MacOS to that, restore your time machine backup, and then start a fresh time machine backup so you have that functional.  Then use boot camp again to reinstall a supported version of Windows next to MacOS.\nWord of warning:  I tried using the native Windows tools to restore a Windows installation on my Mac a good while back.  It did not respect the partition layout but scratched the whole disk including my MacOS partition.  I only did that once.\n", "Q: AppleScript for Excel to select/copy all cells? Applescript can tell Excel to select a specific range of cells, e.g.\nselect (range \"A1:B20\")\nand you can copy cells:\ncopy (range \"A1:B20\")\nHowever, how can you tell Excel to select all the cells in a worksheet, or to copy all the cells in a worksheet?

However when I use the same for riding my bicycle (Outdoor Cycle activity) neither distance or speed are showing.  When the bike ride has ended, the activity is able to show the GPS map.\nWhy does the Outdoor Cycle Activity not show speed or distance?\n\nA: Completely independent of my Apple Watch usage, I had reviewed my privacy settings on my iPhone and had disabled some location services that did not seem necessary to me.  One of these related to motion calibration.  Apparently this privacy setting was also applied on my Apple Watch.\n\nTo enable this setting, on your iPhone (iOS 12):\n  Settings -> Privacy -> Location Services -> System Services -> Motion Calibration & Distance \n\nI also assume that this will affect the accuracy of my running distance/speed logging as previously my Apple Watch ignored the GPS data and only used the accelerometers.\nI couldn't find this answer on Stack Exchange.

As I recall, macOS Server used to be available to download for free via a redeem code to Apple Developers enrolled in paid Apple Developer Program. However, after the latest redesign of the Apple Developer portal during mid 2019, I'm not able to find the redeem code anymore.\nIt used to be possible to get the download code after logging in to the iOS Developer Center and opening the downloads page. There used to be a Get Download Code button which is not there anymore. Here is a picture showing how it looked like.\n\nNow It's only possible to download the macOS server beta, but not the latest released version.\nDoes anyone know how can I get the redeem code nowadays?\n\nA: You can download OS X Server from the Mac App Store.  Per this Apple Support page:\n\nOS X Server brings even more power to your business, home office, or school. Designed for OS X and iOS, OS X Server makes it easy to collaborate, develop software, host websites and wikis, configure Mac and iOS devices, and remotely access a network. It’s also remarkably simple to install, set up, and manage. Add OS X Server to your Mac from the Mac App Store.\n\nI think the name has been changed to macOS Server but I'm not sure.  If someone knows for sure they can edit this answer.\nUpdate: per discussion in comments, it appears Apple has discontinued offering a code to developers for a free copy.  All downloads, except for betas or discontinued versions, are in the MAS now and must be purchased (if applicable).\n", "Q: Mount a previously internal and encrypted HDD as an external drive I upgraded the hard drive on my late 2015 iMac from the fusion drive that came with it to a 1TB Samsung SSD. My SSD has a fresh install of macOS and I planned on using my fusion drive as an external drive with a SATA to USB case, so I didn’t copy any of my files from the fusion drive expecting to be able to just plug it into the iMac later.\nBut it doesn’t get recognized at all, not even in disk utility. I’m assuming it’s due to the fusion drive being encrypted with the macOS that was installed on the fusion drive itself. Is there any way I can mount that drive to access my data? Or would I have to open up the iMac again and reinstall the fusion drive, copy my files properly, then reinstall the SSD?\n\nA: You seem to be under the impression that the hard drive is the Fusion Drive - that is not the case. The Fusion Drive is a \"virtual drive\" consisting of both the hard drive as well as the internal SSD that was factory installed in your iMac.\nYou cannot remove just the hard drive from the iMac and expect to be able to mount it externally on other computers and copy files off it. You will need the data from the internal SSD to be able to do that. The easiest way to do this is to mount it in the same iMac that it came from.\nIf you during reinstallation of macOS cleared the internal SSD of the iMac, you have effectively wiped your data - and you won't be able to mount the external hard drive. You will need to do data recovery on the drive to be able to get anything out.\nIf you haven't cleared the internal SSD, it should be possible to mount the Fusion Drive again. It is however usually very cumbersome to do so if you have altered the disk configuration by adding another internal SSD. If you use any of the standard tools for fusing the Fusion Drive (like \"diskutil resetFusion\" on Mojave), you'll not only loose your data - but it will probably just error out stating that you have a non-standard disk configuration.\nI would advise simply removing the new SSD from the iMac, putting back the hard drive. Cross your fingers and hope everything boots up - and then copy off any data you want to save. Then you install the new SSD again.\n", "Q: Detect if Apple Certificate File is Development versus Distribution When building an iOS App, Apple requires that you obtain a Development or Distribution certificate through their Apple Development Program.\nUsing only the file itself, how can the type of certificate (Development versus Distribution) be determined?\nThe intention here is not to rely on filenames or human verification.. I need to write a program that can programmatically determine the type of a given certificate by reading its contents.\nThanks.\n\nA: You can test the certificate for specific OID entries, or more easily but less robustly, view the contents and pattern match.\nTo extract the contents of a .cer/DER encoded certificate:\nopenssl x509 -in [PATH TO CERTIFICATE.cer] -noout -inform der -text\n\n", "Q: Script that checks for apps with open window asks 'Where is Electron\" in Electron apps I have a script that prints the bundle ids for all apps with open windows.

Your usage isn’t generating a syntax error, but it is probably causing more confusion than usual and is winding up targeting the wrong item (welcome to AppleScript).\nYou can use pipes around variable names like this where there may be a conflict (e.g. |name|), but CJK’s solution also avoids the repeat statement altogether.\n\nA: tell application \"System Events\" to return the ¬\n    bundle identifier of every process ¬\n    whose visible = true\n\n", "Q: Keyboard Issues: Can’t sign in or access system preferences I have an issue where my keyboard is typing random characters when I type, my left and right arrows type a ‘=‘ sign and the numbers don’t work.\nI am not signed in and at the login screen.

It isn't going to very many people, less than 100. I don't want to use it as a B2B app as then I'd need to setup a server and setup device management. It seems I'm able to distribute promo codes and users can install the app through the app store that way, even though the app is a  'custom app for business'. \nIs this a reliable method of distribution?\nWill users be able to update?\n\nA: \nIs this a reliable method of distribution?\n\nNo. It won't work at all -- an application that is not useful for the general public will not be approved for distribution through the App Store.\nYou will need to distribute this app through the Enterprise program.\n\nA: Yes this will work, as long as you have a DUNS number for your business, and your users have the same Apple ID country as your business is registered in (Users can change this, if they have no credit on their account and no apple subscriptions)\nI believe @duskwuff is unfamiliar with the B2B program (different from the public app store and enterprise programs).\nHowever, you will need to keep track of which codes you have given out, and you will need to register as an Apple Business (business.apple.com) with your DUNS number, to buy codes from your apple developer account. AFAIK these have to be different Apple IDs, so you're not purchasing from yourself.\nAdditionally, if your users download the app using a redemption code, they will not be able to see the app details page (App Store will give a generic error). However, auto-updates should work like normal, manual updates should work from the \"Purchased\" section of the app store, and new VPP codes/links can be redeemed as well, as a hack to update the app.\n", "Q: Netatalk disk not shown in TimeMachine, manual connect via afp works I set up netatalk on Ubuntu to backup via TimeMachine to one partition there over my network. I can connect to the partition through the Finder Go... menue. But I cannot see an option to create a new folder. In TimeMachine this backup disk does not show up. \nI tried using this Ubuntuusers' wiki page for netatalk v2 and using these instructions for netatalk v3. None works. I suspect a problem with my MacOS but don't know where to search. How can I make the backup disk visible to TimeMachine?\n\nA: I've recently had the same experience.  Netatalk exported a volume with time machine set to yes, I could mount the volume, but it would not show up in the Time Machine preferences panel.\nFrom the Finder I tried to create a new file/folder and realized that I didn't have write permissions.  Granting read/write permissions on the underlying volume on the file server then allowed Time Machine to find it.\nThe specifics of how to change permissions will vary but I changed ownership (chown) and permissions (chmod) on the mount point on the file server.\n", "Q: How to find out which application(s) created core dumps? I have a friend who has a Mac (Mojave) that recently ran out of space. I found that the space was being used by files in the /cores folder. I deleted them and used to the command sudo launchctl limit core 0 0 to turn off the creation of the files. But somehow the crash dump got turned back on and the HDD was full again. Now I'm curious as to what created the core dump. \nHow do a go about reading a core.xxx file when I don't know which program is crashing? \nCan I identify the crashing application from the core dump?\n\nA: The handling of coredumps has changed on Mojave, so you cannot use \"otool -c\" as you did on older macOS versions. Instead you open the Terminal and run the following command:\nlldb -c /cores/core.12345\n\nwhere 12345 needs to be replaced by the actual filename of your coredump file.\nWhen lldb has started up, you'll get an (lldb) prompt, where you enter the following command:\ntarget list\n\nThen you should be shown which program crashed.

The Mojave Macs keep locking out every file they access on the SMB file share. So, the Mac user who opened the file can't save to the file (with a warning about the file being open and in use), nor can anyone else access the file (until the connection is force closed on the server side).\nOn High Sierra Macs, file handling over SMB appears to be normal with no lockout issues.\nBecause this is become such a chronic issue, I'm considering restoring the Mojave macs back to High Sierra. But before I do that, are there any other options that might address this issue?\nNote that SMBv1 is disabled for security reasons, and is not a fallback option.\n\nA: I have this same issue. It seems to only be with Microsoft Office files. PDFs don't seem to have \"permanent lock\" issue. I don't know if it's a problem with the MacOS \"dual fork\" file structure fighting with the Microsoft temporary lock file.\nI've re-pushed NTFS permissions down from the parent folder to see if that would resolve the creation/destruction of the temporary files. It works for a bit then the problem comes right back.\nWe have even had one file where all permissions were removed and even the SYSTEM user was unable to recover the permissions. I couldn't seize ownership with the GUI or any cmd commands. I had to restore the file from a backup.\nHave you had any luck with this issue?\nI've tested the glitch with a laptop that is running the same versions of MacOS and Office but have been unable to trigger the lock file issue.\n\nA: We've faced this at my work as well, we noticed that Mojave machines would complain about \"Write Access\" not being granted, we went through using Full Control/Modify on our user's folder and it didn't resolve it.\nWe tried turning off thumbnails in Finder which also didn't do much in the way of it working, then finally we ran Handle which showed us when we were having the issue that there were 3 open handles to the file in question, when we closed Photoshop or whatever program all but 1 would be released, further digging just showed us that it was SYSTEM that had the file open so that didn't give us much to go off.\nI've been watching the Apple Change Logs to see if they make any mention of SMB problems being fixed, but it seems like it's not moving forward. I'm sorry for not bringing a helpful answer but it hasn't fully fallen off our radar as we're wanting to go to Mojave as soon as we find something to fix this annoying issue.\n\nA: We don’t see this at all on thousands of Macs sharing via SMB of many vintages, most 2008 R2 and newer, but all manner of non windows servers exist in our environment in addition to windows server. \nI wonder if the people having problems are binding their Macs to AD or just have permissions issues? Sorry to not have an answer, but we’re not changing anything out of the box and not seeing any issues like described. We do not bind and about 30% of our Macs use Apple a Enterprise Connect to generate Kerberos tickets, but that’s not needed to get things to work. \nIf every file gets locked, you can get a packet trace and work with IT / Microsoft / Apple to diagnose the issue in my experience if you can’t see the error debugging the packet traces. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/recording_a_packet_trace\nWireshark has very good tools to read in the files and filter to SMB traffic if needed.

So I'm running the latest Mac OS Mojave version on my ~4 yo MacBook Pro. I have, and I had for a while now this \"Recovery HD\" that takes aout 70,3GB.\nSo 3 questions here :\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm getting kind of narrow with the limited disk on my laptop and was thinking : could/should I remove this partition, that I never used and that I'll probably never use ?\n\n*If so, would it be doable to just merge those 70GB with my main hard drive ?\n\n*If I somehow someday need a \"Rescue Mode\" on my macbook, could I just flash a USB stick ?\n\n\nThanks.\n\nA: First of all, this recovery partition usually takes less than a gigabyte of storage, as researched online and in my early 2014 MacBook Air. You may want to look more into why your Recovery HD partition is that large.\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all, this partition is incredibly useful if you accidentally destroy your MacBook somehow, for example deleting your MacOS. It allows you to recover and restore your MacBook without having to either bring it to the Apple Store or download the MacOS installation of some sort and install it yourself. Although, if you are concerned about your security, you can delete this partition, because others can boot your MacBook into the Recovery partition and erase your data. So it's just your choice to delete it or not.\n\n*Now, I don't think merging is a great idea since you won't be able to boot from the Recovery HD partition after you merge. The extra 70 gigabytes that are now in your main hard drive are basically a waste of space now, so no don't merge.\n\n*Here I'm not sure about this, so you may want to check with others before taking my advice. You can create a separate flash drive installer for MacOS, but I don't know if it requires the Recovery partition. According to Apple Support, it does, but I think there are other ways to install MacOS without the partition.\nI hope this helps. :)\n", "Q: Copy file from Terminal and paste in Mail I would like to \n\n\n*\n\n*copy a file to the clipboard in terminal (as a reference like Finder does it) and then \n\n*when writing an email, paste it into Mail as an attachment (CMD + V).\n\n\nI posted an example solution below but I'd prefer a script that does not need to open Finder.\n\nA: The following script works but it needs to open (and close) a Finder window.\nSave this to maccopy:\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\non run args\n  set theFile to (POSIX file (first item of args)) as alias\n  tell application \"Finder\"\n      reopen\n      activate\n      set selection to {}\n      reveal theFile\n  end tell\n  delay 1\n  tell app \"System Events\"\n      keystroke \"c\" using command down\n  end tell\n  tell application \"Finder\"\n      close window 1\n  end tell\n  tell application \"iTerm2\"\n      activate\n  end tell\nend\n\nand chmod +x maccopy.\nUse with maccopy PATH-TO-FILE.\n", "Q: What is the difference between Memory, Real Mem, and Compressed Mem? I've already seen this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*What's the difference between Real, Virtual, Shared, and Private Memory?\nbut I think it might be outdated. Specifically, there is a Memory column, as well as Real Mem and Compressed Mem column. What is the difference, and why would the Real Mem ever be smaller than Compressed Mem?\n(I'm using macOS Sierra 10.12, but I think I've seen this in slightly older versions as well.)\n\n\n\nA: The relation between them is this:\nMemory = The amount of memory the process has reserved for its use.\nCompressed mem = The amount of memory (a subset of \"Memory\") that the operating system has used its compression algorithm on\nReal mem = The amount of real memory that is actually used by the process (i.e. a sum of the memory that hasn't been compressed, and the size of the result of the compression algorithm)\nSo in this case the process thinks it has reserved 976,2 MB for its use. The system took 649,7 MB of that memory and compressed it. That leaves 326,5 MB that wasn't compressed plus the size of the compressed memory after it was compressed - which in this case is approx. 77,2 MB. The total of actual memory used by the process is then 403,7 MB.\n", "Q: How to enable search when using Emoji keyboard on iPhone? I would like to search for Emojis using text when using an Emoji keyboard on iPhone. I have seen some people using this (also, I guess WhatsApp keyboard supports it?), and was wondering how to enable this, does anyone have a clue?\n\n\nA: You can't use search when looking for emoji in the stock iOS keyboard.\niOS uses predictive text to determine what emoji to offer you based on the words you're typing.  While this isn't what you're asking for, you can see this iPhoneLife article for more info.\nTo search by emoji, you need to install and use a 3rd-party keyboard.  Many developers offer keyboards that incorporate emoji search.  I use SwiftKey (not associated with the software or developer) for typing on all my iOS devices.\n\nApple has indicated that the upcoming iOS 13 will offer:\n\nWord and emoji suggestions\nIf you need to correct a word, simply ask and you’ll be presented with a list of suggested replacements.\n\n\nA: Another alternative is Searchmoji.\nIt's a free keyboard that allow to search emojis with keyword. \nThe best part is that Searchmoji doesn't require full-access to work (like all the other third party keyboard out there), therefore there's no way you data will leave your iPhone.\nI am a developer of this app.\nMore info here: Emoji keyboard app\n\nA: According to this article on iPhoneTricks.org, iOS 14 brings the emoji search bar as a default option:\n\nI assume the same goes for iPadOS.\n", "Q: How to completely reset or remove and restore Safari in Mojave Safari is bugged in my macbook. It's a macbook air 2019 with mojave 10.14.5\nThe problem is I can't delete bookmarks nor save new ones on it because it ask to keep or remove firefox bookmarks, which according to Safari, where imported on january 1st 4001.\n\nI've pressed every button, but nothing happens\nI've tried deleting the cache and even restoring to another mac my timemachine backup to see if it's solved, but no, so before I tried to reinstall from zero, I would like to know if I can do something else.\n\nA: The first thing I would do is Clear History from the Safari menu. After that quit and re-launch Safari while holding down the Shift key. That will launch Safari in Safe Mode and disable any third party extensions.\nIf Safari behaves itself after that, disable your extensions and re-enable them one at a time.\nFailing that, more extreme measures are in order. I would start with a preferences clean. Quit Safari and then in Finder hold down the Option and select the Go menu and then \"Library\" from that menu.\nOnce the Library folder is open look for a folder or folders with Safari in the name and move the contents of each to folders on your Desktop. Then look for a Preferences folder in the Library folder and open it up. Look for any file/folder with Safari in the name and move them to the desktop. Once the library folder is clear of Safari-related files Try safari then and see how things are working.\nIf things are still not working properly I would download and install the Combo update for the current version of your macOS. Search on \"combo update mac os 10.14.5\" (or whatever your current version is). It will lead you to a large file on apple.com. Download and run it. It will update your OS and will usually fix problems such as this.\nIf that still does not fix the problems let us know.\n", "Q: How can I save a file to a specific \"keyed\" location?

HomeBrew installed rSync into /usr/local/bin/rsync.  \nThe problem is when I connect to the Mac computer using rSync, the Mac uses version 2.6.9 instead of the new one I installed.  How can I make it so that it uses the new one instead of the old one?\nI know about changing the PATH for the local user to put /usr/local/bin/rsync before /usr/bin/rsync.  It works when I am logged in using the terminal or SSH.  However, when I connect using Synology, it always invokes 2.6.9 which renders it not workable.  \nIs there anything in there that can cause the system to use 3.1.3 in the /usr/local/bin/rsync instead of the original one that came with the computer?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The answer depends on how you have setup ActiveBackup, as you can run it in three different ways:\n1) Rsync shell mode via SSH\n2) Rsync module mode (directly)\n3) Rsync module mode via SSH\nWhen using mode 1, ActiveBackup will login to the Mac and start up rsync itself. This does not go through launchd at all. I can see that you have been advised to use \"--rsync-path\", but that is not an option for you, simply because ActiveBackup does not let you set this parameter.\nInstead what you need to do is to ensure that when ActiveBackup starts rsync on the remote server, it will start up the correct version - WITHOUT the possibility of changing which command ActiveBackup sends over. There's two ways of doing this depending on whether your ActiveBackup version is the one that issues the \"rsync\" command or the one issuing the \"/usr/bin/rsync\" command.\nIf it is the first one (try this first), then edit the /private/etc/paths file and make sure the \"/usr/local/bin\" line comes before the \"/usr/bin\" line.\nIf it is the second one, then use these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot the Mac in Recovery Mode\n\n*Open Terminal and disable SIP: \"csrutil disable\"\n\n*Reboot and open Terminal\n\n*Move away old rsync: \"mv /usr/bin/rsync /usr/bin/rsync.orig\"\n\n*Link in new rsync: \"ln -s /usr/local/bin/rsync /usr/bin/rsync\"\nYou'll want to test this with ActiveBackup, and then reboot into Recovery Mode to enable SIP again with \"csrutil enable\".\nNote that a subsequent macOS update might replace rsync. If that happens, just repeat the process. Note that as Apple hasn't updated rsync for years, it is not that likely to happen.\nIf you're using mode 2, ActiveBackup communicates directly with the rsync daemon, and does not start the rsync command itself on the Mac. In this case you cannot use the advise of using \"--rsync-path\", as it doesn't apply here at all. How to fix it depends on how you have actually started the rsync daemon. As you haven't detailed anything about starting it, I assume this means that you haven't actually started it.\nHowever if you did follow a guide to enable rsyncd - you have probably done it through adding a launchd \"LaunchDaemon\". In that case you'll need to change your launch daemon file and find the key \"Program\" and change the corresponding string element to:\n/usr/local/bin/rsync\nIf you're using mode 3, you'll want to follow the guide for mode 1 as it is the same steps necessary.\n", "Q: Can a 2018 Mac mini support dual 4k monitors at 60 Hz?

The specications say that a Mac mini can support dual 4k monitors, but are there any caveats to this?\nI am planning to get 2 x 4k monitors and run them both at 60hz, connected through DisplayPort (I will get Thunderbolt 3 to DisplayPort adapters).\n\nA: Yes, the 2018 Mac Mini can support dual 4k monitors at 60 Hz connected the way you indicate. I have this setup myself. There are no caveats.\nNote: You do not need an \"adapter\" as such. You just need ordinary, passive cables from Thunderbolt 3 to DisplayPort.\n", "Q: Prevent Terminal from overwriting preferences on exit When a user loads my C++ program, I want Terminal to look a certain way. I solved this by wrapping my program in an AppleScript .app which overwrites ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist (making a backup first) before opening the program. With a subsequent killall cfprefsd, this works (if Terminal wasn't open to begin with!), but I don't want to mess up the user's own Terminal preferences. So, after calling my program I overwrite  ...Terminal.plist again with the backup of the original settings.\nThe problem is that when my program is done and Terminal closes, its preferences are automatically overwritten with that of the current window, meaning the user is stuck with the look I set for my program. I tried to counter this by having the AppleScript wait until Terminal was closed and then overwriting the plist with the backup once more, which works, but if my app were to be closed before Terminal then this fails of course. And the whole process seems pretty hacky to begin with.\nCan I prevent Terminal from overwriting its preferences when it closes? Or even better, can I have my code run in a terminal that looks the way I want without messing with the user's settings? Preferably I wouldn't use Terminal at all to run my code (so it also doesn't fail when Terminal was already open), but I think the only alternative is writing my own...\n\nA: I'd look into what can be done with applescript using the scripting dictionary. \nscript editor > file > open scripting dictionary\nI do not know the details of what you are doing but here are some coloring options.\n\n", "Q: How to take a screenshot on Mac while keeping the aspect ratio of the capture area I know I can open the Screenshot tool by pressing cmd + shift + 4.\nI can drag the mouse around to specify the area I want to take a screenshot of, but I am wondering how I can keep the width and height ratio 1:1 when moving the mouse cursor.\nIn image editing software, the combination is usually to hold shift while dragging. On mac using the screenshot tool, this means to lock one of the axis depending on where you start your drag motion. It locks the width if you start dragging up or down, and locks the height if you start dragging left or right.\nPressing alt on the other hand makes the capture area grow in both direction.\nholding either cmd or ctrl seems to do nothing.\nI really hope there is a key combination to make the width and height scale the same, but I cannot figure out which key combination to use.\nEDIT\nMy version of macOS is Mojave 10.14.5.\nAnd just to clarify, I want to keep the selection area to grow and remain at 1:1 ratio while actually moving the cursor around, similar to this:\n\nAlternatively resizing the area in equal proportion to each other, meaning the width and the height changes so that the original aspect ratio is intact. The resulting image itself does not have to be 1:1\n\n\nA: As far as I know the exact thing you are trying to do is not natively possible in the current version of macOS Mojave. The current modifiers that do exist for the screenshot tool are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Holding shift  moves only one of the sides of the capture area.\n\n*Holding option scales up all sides of the capture area from the center.\n\n*Holding space  allows you to move the capture area around.\n\n\nAlternatively you can use shiftcommand5    which will give you the onscreen capture controls with a few more options for resizing the capture area, however this doesn't include any options for locking the aspect ratio. \n\nA: While it doesn't appear to be possible to do this while taking a screenshot, here's a simple process to achieve the same result quickly using the built-in Preview app:\n\n*\n\n* Screenshot the whole screen to the clipboard with ControlCommandShift3\n\n* Launch the Preview app (CommandSpace to bring up Spotlight, type prev, press Enter.)\n\n*➕ Paste the screenshot into a new Preview window with CommandN\n\n*⬚ Select the square area of the screen you want by holding Shift while dragging the mouse pointer to make a selection. (You can also hold Option to expand the selection from a centre point.)\n\n* Copy the contents of the selection with CommandC.\n\n Alternatively, if you want the image in a file, at the last step crop the image to the selection using CommandK, then save it.\n\nIf you're going to be doing this a lot, you can change your screenshot defaults to always open the image in Preview! Here's how:\n\n*\n\n*Press CommandShift5 to open the settings for screenshots.\n\n*In the Options menu, under Save to, click on Preview.\n\n*Press Esc\nAfter doing that, screenshotting the whole screen with CommandShift3 (don't need the Control) will do steps 1, 2, and 3 from the above, so you just need to make a selection and copy. \n", "Q: Activity Monitor, my system always runs in the red for CPU load - how to fix?

It’s always in the red in the CPU load graph and nothing I do corrects this.\nI’ve tried resetting NVRAM, SMC and rebooting, so is this a problem with some sort of extension?\nHow do I fix this?!?!\n\nA: Your confusion is the result of a bad UX design decision on behalf of Apple. \nBasically, the red colour in the CPU Load graph within Activity Monitor signifies the level of CPU usage by the System. The blue colour signifies the level of usage by User processes.\nIn other words, red isn’t being used to signify danger, or to try to alert users to a problem, it’s simply the colour chosen to signify system usage.

But will the keystrokes you enter into Apple's main keyboard be accessible to a 3rd party keyboard with full access? I would think the answer to be \"no, of course not,\" but I'd like if there was some kind of official documentation to that effect.  \nThis user answer on Apple's website says the answer is no, but they don't provide a source. Is there some way to be relatively certain that this is in fact the case?\n\nA: 3rd party keyboards can't access data entered into the stock iOS keyboard, that's just the way Apple developed the API's.  Without understanding the Text API's it will be difficult to explain why this is.  \nIf you're concerned about keyboard security, however, you should be more concerned with what info 3rd-party keyboards send to their servers.  These keyboards can send keystrokes, words, and phrases to their developers via the internet.  Granted, not all keyboards do this but every popular keyboard I've seen includes in their ToS that they can send this info if they want.\nThe \"full access\" warning message you see when installing 3rd-party keyboards is about doing just that: sending your info to their servers.\nThis reason is why Apple prevents these keyboards from entering sensitive text.

Thanks!\n\nA: The easy way to find the plist key for a given preference is to open a Finder window of ~/Library/Preferences, set it to List View, sorted by Date Modified.\nThen, set the preference and see what file gets modified.\nFrom that, I get two almost identical files modified (on 10.14.5):\ncom.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist\ncom.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad.plist\n\nThey contain the following relevant keys:\n<key>DragLock</key>\n<false/>\n<key>Dragging</key>\n<false/>\n<key>TrackpadThreeFingerDrag</key>\n<false/>\n\nso you can set these keys directly with defaults:\ndefaults write com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad Dragging -bool true\ndefaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad Dragging -bool true\n\nYou can include three-finger dragging or Drag Lock, if that's what you want with similar commands.\nFinally, run the following for the writes to take effect:\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/SystemAdministration.framework/Resources/activateSettings -u\n\n\nA: I recommend using -int type instead of -bool, so, the commands should be:\ndefaults write com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad Dragging -int 1\ndefaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad Dragging -int 1\n\n\n\nUnfortunately the defaults command does not necessarily tell one the correct type the key is and one can easily mistake a 0 or 1 as a boolean instead of an integer, or visa versa, when using the, e.g., defaults read ... command.\nUsing PlistBuddy, as in the output below, one can see the target keys are integer, not boolean.\n% /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -x -c 'print :Dragging' ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad.plist\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<integer>0</integer>\n</plist>\n% \n% \n% /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -x -c 'print :Dragging' ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<integer>0</integer>\n</plist>\n%\n\n\nNote that in reading these two files with PlistBuddy, they are original and untouched having never been manually edited previously and therefore what's reported in the output is the proper type for the keys.\n", "Q: Hard drive replacement iMac late 2013 I know almost nothing about computer repair. I'm an elderly woman who is partially blind. I did find a step by step guide on iFixit and have a friend with tools and nimbler fingers than mine. He's not familiar with Mac's. \nThis is model iMac14,1 late 2013.\nMy problem is: How to get a functioning OS on the new drive so I can clone my old drive onto it.\nI CANNOT install the latest Mac OS. If I do (I think) I won't be able to clone my current OS (High Sierra) backwards over it. Most of my important apps and games aren't compatible after High Sierra. \nThere's a 20$$ Mountain Lion OS in the Apple mac store, but I don't for sure know how to install it on the iMac - the Mountain Lion OS is a download. Do I have to borrow a dvd player and burn a disk, and use the dvd player for an install - or is it good enough to have the dmg on my current peripheral drive?\nWill this even work?  1) Have a OS ready on the new internal drive, 2) clone (Carbon Copy Cloner) my current working OS - I'm booting into it on a peripheral drive - over the new OS on the new drive. \nI know - so many questions. If you have advice, I'm grateful. \n\nA: clone (Carbon Copy Cloner) my current working OS - I'm booting into it on a peripheral drive\nI understand you are running off of an external drive now.  \nThe iMacs are rather tedious to disassemble and re-assemble. They're like laptops.  Your friend should have experience working with pc laptops. Have him look over the instructions and see if it is within his skill set. \nYou may want to continue this way.  I'd recommend a second drive as a backup.  I would get an external ssd drive and use the current drive as backup. Give OWC a call 1.800.275.4576.  They will be able to advise you on which external drive for you machine will give you the best performance. I'm running an SSD off of an external drive. Performance is much improved over my rotating internal drive.  At first, I tried my usb 2.0 external drive.  It was too slow.  So I switch to a USB 3.0 external drive which gives me great performance. \nOne thing you missed is that you do not need an operating system on you new drive before using ccc to clone to a new drive. \nI'm an elderly woman who is partially blind. I did find a step by step guide on iFixit and have a friend with tools and nimbler fingers than mine. He's not familiar with Mac's.\nYour question is well written.

That brought an awful lot of \"Operation not permitted\" in the terminal.\nAfter that I wanted to install again with sudo. Then an error message showed sth like \"sudoers uid is 501 should be 0\" (cant exactly remember it)\nThen I tried to restart the mac, but it never did... Just black screen. I heard the starting sound once or twice, but it never booted again or showed anything on the screen. Anyone any idea what happend and how to fix it?\n\nA: It sounds like you mistyped the command or had problems with your brew command, making the chown apply to not only /usr/local but rather / - i.e. the whole system. The command you have written is actually relatively dangerous, as you're relying on \"brew --prefix\" to output the right thing.\nIn this case your command changed the owner of system files, such as the /etc/sudoers file. This is why the system won't boot anymore.\nThe good news is that you should be able to boot the Mac in Recovery Mode by holding down Cmd and R while booting. From there you should be able to select that you want to reinstall macOS on your computer. This should allow you to overwrite those system files and ensure that the system is good to boot, while keeping your own files intact. If you have done any changes to the system files, you'll loose those ofcourse.\n", "Q: Seagate (Samsung) external drive USB 3.0 not mounting on High Sierra Please redirect if i've missed a similar thread: Seagate 500GB USB 3.0 working fine last week, now won't mount.

Failing that, any recommendations on data recovery options (assuming that's even an option)\n\nA: Looks like hardware failure to me. It might not be the drive itself. Could be a bad connection, or bad power supply. You haven't given any specific details on how you have this drive hooked up to your computer. Nor whether it's a 2.5, or 3.5\" drive. So a definitive answer isn't possible. It it's read/write, tracks/sectors failing, smartmon will indicate to your BIOS/OS that the drive is failing, and needs to be replaced. You should perform a fresh boot and immediately look at your logs to see whether smartmon is reporting failures.

However, all of the tutorials are using either an iMac or older MacBook Pro.  I haven't seen one with new MacBook Pro yet.\nfor example this guide.\nWhy do all of these tutorials not work on my new MacBook? These ways are expired?\nsee this question from the Apple Support Communities.\n\nA: This is based on my own experience of installing Windows 10 on an external drive:\nStep 1: Download a virtual machine to run Windows on. I used VMWare Fusion and used a 30-day trial. You do not need to do this if you already have a computer with Windows 10\nStep 2: Search \"windows 10 iso image\" and click the first link from Microsoft. Download it.\nStep 3: Open the VMWare application and upload the Windows 10 iso image onto it, and run Windows. You do not need to do this if you already have a computer with Windows 10\nStep 4: Go on your virtual Windows and download WinToUSB from this: https://www.easyuefi.com/wintousb/.\nStep 5: Open the WinToUSB tool and upload the same Windows 10 .iso image onto it, and choose which version to install. Connect your external drive to your Mac, make sure it connects to VMWare, and select it once it shows up on WinToUSB.\nStep 6: Wait until the tool installs Windows 10 onto the external drive. While this is running, go to the Bootcamp app and ONLY download the Windows Support Software.\nStep 7: Once the WinToUSB tool finishes installing, you can close out of VMWare by shutting down from the virtual Windows. The connected external drive should show up on your mac again, and drag the Windows Support Software folder into the drive.\nYou should now have an external drive with Windows 10 on it, and the Windows Support Software on it as well. You can boot from it by restarting and holding option and choosing the external drive. Use the Windows Support Software to install the correct Apple Drivers in the external drive when inside the Windows 10 boot.\nThis was the method that worked for me on an Early 2014 MacBook Air on High Sierra and should work on yours unless something in Bootcamp Assistant changed.\n\nA: WintoUSB is great and a lot of folks recommend this app because it has a free version. However, it seems something wrong when running it on a Windows 7 machine. After selecting the USB drive, it comes to an error \"Failed to run system API (0x0005001501B200000)\".\n\nTried multiple times and still the same result.\nThen I did a test on another two Windows To Go creator software and managed to install Windows 10 to external SSD via UUByte WintoUSB Pro tool.\nThe first step is to get a working PC or create a new virtual machine on Mac.\nThen download UUByte WintoUSB Pro  (https://www.uubyte.com/win-to-usb-pro.html) and open the software. Follow the screen prompt to import Windows 10 ISO and choose the booting mode. For Mac, it is GPT+ UEFI. Wait for about 10 minutes, and a portable Windows to Go drive is ready.\nNow, connect the drive to Mac and press Power + Option key to boot Mac from external USB. You will see Windows 10 setup screen when everything is fine. Follow the steps to install Windows 10 on that external drive.\nFinally, activate Windows 10 and download missing drivers to make it working properly on Mac.\n", "Q: When I try to use Animoji, I see \"Tap to resume\" When I try to use Animoji, I get the following message/error:\n\nTap to resume\n\nAdditionally, when I tap on my Memoji, I get\n\nFace tracking failed.

I've also tried a hard reboot/force restart, resetting all settings, and erasing the phone and resetting all settings—and none of those fixed the problem.\nFace ID seems completely unaffected.\nWhat can I do to fix this?\n\nA: Today, I went back to the Apple Store.\nAfter running some tests, they were able to determine a problem with the telephoto lens and Face ID. (Curiously, they saw someone with the same problem earlier that day.)\nBecause my phone was still within its warranty period, they replaced it free of charge.\nYour mileage may vary, but it's worth a shot!\n\nA: What I did was delete some Memojis that I didn’t need to free up some space.

Is Photos just scanning my memories when I have extra processing power and analyzing them?\n\nA: 10 year old photos must have been scanned for faces and scenes by now.

I have a work computer, and every time I turn it on and log in, hot corners are enabled where when I move my mouse to a corner inadvertently, it locks my screen. This happens all the time in the middle of my work.\nEvery time, this annoys me, and I go into System Preferences and set all the hot corners options to none. But, the next day or whenever I restart my computer, they come back! I am wondering if anyone knows how to permanently disable them so I don't need to manually disable them every time I restart my work MacBook.\nIs there a terminal command or something I can set to stop Hot Corners settings from resetting back on constantly?

Which (to me) indicates that a previous Mac OS X version needs to already be installed.\nSo if I were you, I'd probably get my hands on a copy of Mountain Lion, and install that first. Then attempt to install Mojave from there.\nWhile you indicate yours is 2013, if it does turn out to be matter of your hardware being too old. Do note, that the OS Installer has a white, or blacklist that it consults to determine whether the hardware is an actual candidate for install/upgrade.

Nothing was picked up; it appears there are no issues according to it. \n\nA: I suggest booting into diagnostic mode (search here or Google for instructions based on your particular Mac). Either it’s a fluke or your GPU is soon to die. \n\nA: It may be just a freak occurrence. If it happens again, you should bring it to an Apple store. Is it under warranty? If it is, be sure to get it checked out and have the issue on file before the warranty expires.\n\nA: Yeah, that pattern looks like uninitialized video memory. That kind of thing happens when the machine comes out of sleep incorrectly or if there is a GPU memory pin that is coming loose. I say that because it’s a regular pattern.\nRegardless, if it’s under warranty, be sure that Apple has noted that you reported a problem.\nBetter safe than sorry.\n", "Q: Stop sharing Macintosh HD and home folder with File Sharing?

In the current version of Power Gadget, frequency is read from a package scope register, so it's not reading a specific core's frequency. A future version of Power Gadget will measure frequency on all cores.\nAt present Power Gadget measures temperature at the package scope, although there are core scoped temperature readings provided by the hardware.

I have no ideas why it's looking for 10.14 sdk and not sure if this is the root cause or not.\n\nA: The root cause of the error message is from the warning message:\n\nclang: warning: no such sysroot directory: '/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk'\n\nBy checking SDKs directory:\n$ cd /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/\n$ ls\nMacOSX.sdk/      MacOSX10.13.sdk\n\nSo, to workaround the problem, it's either re-install xcode suggested by @Mark or create a symbolic link like the following:\n$ sudo ln -s MacOSX.sdk/ MacOSX10.14.sdk\n\n", "Q: Visited and unvisited Google search results have identical styles in Safari 12.1 In Safari 12.1.1 for macOS (or perhaps since version 12.0), I've lost the ability to see which of Google's results I've already clicked on.

That is, the system boots quickly, and then I'm able to login, and the desktop begins to load. Initially, I have control and can open one or two applications, but after about thirty seconds, the desktop freezes. Typically, this lasts around five to ten minutes.\nI checked login items under the Users & Groups menu, and there were only two applications listed. I disabled them, but the problem persists.\nI was able to view the system.log before the slowdown began, and the last entry with which the log was populated was\n(com.apple.imfoundation.IMRemoteURLConnectionAgent): Unknown key for integer: _DirtyJetsamMemoryLimit\n\nLater, once I regained control, I could see that this entry appears in the log a large number of times, about ten to fifty1 more times during the next ten seconds, and then not again until about five minutes later, when I regain control. My understanding is that this is just recording the fact that the system is running out of RAM, and has to being paging, which would be consistent with the slowdown / loss of control.\nThe questions are two. First:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is causing the system to hang and how do I fix it?\n\n\nHowever, I appreciate that that's a difficult question to answer, and, in any case, I would really prefer to know:\n\n\n*How do I figure out what's going wrong?\n\n\nThat is, what other steps do I need to take to understand what's causing the slowdown? It would be nice if I could use htop or something similar to log memory usage during that period, but I'm not sure how to start it running in time.

(This is similar to a question I asked in 2014 but I'm hoping there are better options available now, plus we have to take the lack of 32-bit apps into consideration now.)\nQuickTime 7 will no longer work in macOS 15 \"Catalina\" so the time has come to find an alternative.\nPlayback is no problem, as there are many apps that can playback videos in more formats than QuickTime 7 could.\nHowever, one of the best features of QuickTime 7 \"Pro\" was that it was able to make simple edits to video files (not just trimming from the start or end, which is all QuickTime X can do). \nIt also did so without re-encoding the videos, at least for .mov files.\nI'm hoping to find GUI app options, rather than, say, some kind of magical ffmpeg invocation. Bonus points for being easy to use and not having an atrocious UI, but at this point I'm open to just about anything.\n\nA: QuickTime X seems to be able to open a .mp4 file, trim it, and re-save as .mp4 with no re-encoding.\nThis was surprising to me, as the only way to Export the file is via a filetype change to .mov.\nIf you take other actions such as Add Clip to End..., the menu item for Save will become greyed out and you will be forced to export as .mov if you wish to save. If you Split Clip more than one time without deleting a segment it similarly prevents the save.\nBut this does enable easy trimming and re-saving without .mov conversion using Quicktime X.\nTrim .mp4 video file:\n\n*\n\n*Open a .mp4 with QuickTime Player X\n\n*Scrub to a location in the file. Use the keyboard arrow controls for frame-perfect accuracy.\n\n*Press Split Clip CMDY to cut the video into two segments.\n\n*Select the unwanted segment. Press delete to delete.\n\nNote: You can also use the Trim CMDT command. But I find it is almost impossible to accurately set the In/Out markers without keyboard arrow controls, which do not function in the Trim UI. Instead, use Split Clip to delete each end of the trim.\nSave without re-encoding\n\n*\n\n*Press Save CMDS\n\n*A \"Save As...\" dialog will pop up.\n\n*Note that it is exporting as .mp4. Default value: Export As: Untitled.mp4\n\n*Rename your file and save.\n\n*Resulting format will be same file type and dimensions as your source file. Its file size should also be smaller, depending on how much was trimmed.\n\n\nExport As...\nNote that the Export As... menu does NOT contain \"pass through\" or \"original\" or any good option.\nWhen you select 480p you are only able to export as a .mov file.\nUse Save rather than Export, which will allow you to re-save as a .mp4.\n\n\nA: I am not sure if it is allowed and wanted to mention our product, nessViewer, which have the feature you requested.\nPlease note that we are the distributer of this application - it is commercial and costs 19.90 Euro.\nThe video editing is very near to the old style - which means that you select the start point, via shift pressed the end point, and then remove the selected video frames. This works on any part of the video and multiple times.\nBeside this simple editing, the application allows it to join multiple videos (copy & paste does not work), rotate and flip, and to change the size of the video (e.g. to fade out black beams on top and below).\nThe application is signed, and certified by Apple (notarization). We have tested it on macOS 10.15 (Catalina) and have not found any problem so far.\nOne last info: this application is a collection of many features - not just video playback and editing. So at the beginning, it might need some time to learn how to handle all these features. If you need any help, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nA: When I try to Rotate a .mp4 via QuickTime Player 10.5, it marks the video as Untitled and forces me to \"Export As:\" a .mov HEVC or H.264 file.\nBut lossless / no-re-encoding Rotation edits can still be done via the Rotate Left and Rotate Right Finder Quick Actions, available in either the Right Click menu or Finder sidebar. The rotated video will save in-place.\n\n", "Q: Fresh install of macOS takes up too much space I recently downloaded the macOS Catalina beta.

When I restarted my changes are still there.\nQuestion: How does the mounting application know where to write to? I mean, disk are only available in /dev, and once that is unmounted, no process is supposed to get access to disks. I'm quite confused.\n\nA: That is (as is probably clear to you) not how mounting works. \nThe contents of the /dev folder is mainly device files (as the name implies). Device files are \"special files\" in that they're really nodes in the file system, but the contents of these \"files\" are not stored inside the file system.\nDevice files are divided into two main types: block devices and character devices. A block device is something you can read/write blocks of data from/to (a block is a number of bytes). In contrast, a character device is something you can read/write single characters (bytes) from/to.\nIn this case, the file systems mounted on a normal Mac are usually block devices. For example hard drives, SSD's, etc. are normally available as block devices. \nAs we've now know that device files does not store their content inside the file system, but merely are indicators of a block or character device - how does it then work?\nIt works by storing a kind of \"pointer\" to a kernel representation of the device inside the file system. This is done by having each device file contain 3 pieces of information that is stored inside the file system, and that you can see by running \"ls\" in the Terminal for example:\n$ ls -l /dev/disk0\nbrw-r-----  1 root  operator    1,   0 Jun  5 10:48 /dev/disk0\n\nIn this example the first \"b\" on the line indicates that this is a block device. Had it been a character device, the letter would have been a \"c\"\nThen after \"operator\" (the group), the numbers \"1, 0\" appear. This means that this block device (/dev/disk0) \"points\" to the internal kernel device that has major number 1 and minor number 0.\nThe major number indicates what type of device we're talking about. The disk drives in your Mac all have major number 1. The minor number then indicates which disk and partition or volume that it is.\nNow when you actually mount a file system, you do give the device file as an argument to the mount command. However what is really stored inside the kernel when representing the mount is not the path you've given, but merely the device information (i.e. the major and minor numbers).\nSo when you unmount /dev/, you're essentially removing the device files themselves from the / root. I.e. you can no longer browse those device files. However the actual devices still exist within the kernel, and the already mounted file systems just refer to those by their major/minors numbers, and thus keep working.\n", "Q: Catalina import iTunes Library.xml from Music app I formatted my Mac Catalina beta, because I expected the redesigned Music app to successfully import iTunes Library.itl file from Time Machine Backup.\nHowever, when I import > select the file, nothing happens and even if I manually add ~/Library/Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Media/Music file into Music app, some of the music files are missing.\nIs there any way to completely reset Music app's preferences, thereby re-initiating iTunes Library import sequence from OS update?

Then make sure something is bound to port 8080\nnetstat -an | grep 8080\n\nIf nothing is returned here, your webserver is not bound to an interface @ port 8080, and there is likely a webserver misconfiguration or process race condition binding to that interface at that port number.  The latter can happen when another process already has a particular interface / port bound.  Do an lsof -i  | grep 8080 to see what occupies that port, if anything.  \nFire up a listener on arbitrary port 54321 with nc -v -b [network interface] -l 54321\n\n*On a remote Mac, BSD, Linux, or even UNIX host which is connected to the same NAT/intranet network, fire up a command prompt to access a system shell — via opening the Terminal app in Utilities on a Mac...

Without messing with its config, let's temporarily disable it, and then retest the nc tests I describe above...:\nsudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setglobalstate off\n\nThen rerun the tests above.  Change the 'off' above to 'on' to re-enable the app firewall after that.  I am fairly confident that this will resolve the issue.  If it does, then we just need to configure the app firewall -- a walk in the park, and I will advise after knowing the results...\nF.\n\nA: My first thought is that you don't have a clear network path from your iOS device to the Mac to begin with. Download a utility like https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ping-network-utility/id576773404, and ping your Mac. Report back whether the ping works. \nIf you can’t even ping the Mac, it’s highly unlikely that you’ll be able to connect to it. Before you dive into firewalls, check that your router is set to let devices communicate with each other. Some will not allow connections between devices by default, only to devices on the Internet. \n", "Q: How to call a phone number on a picture?

I wouldn't mind, except text selection has now become invisible:\n\nIn the screenshot above, the word mechanisms is selected, and I can copy the text and paste it elsewhere, but it doesn't look selected. This is really annoying when I'm trying to select a large amount of text to copy and paste elsewhere.\nChanging the text selection colour from Graphite (my current setting) to something else fixes the issue. Changing the accent colour in the Mojave dark mode to something other than grey automatically changes the text selection colour to the corresponding one, which again fixes the issue, but going back to Graphite (without changing the accent colour back to grey) reinstates the issue. If possible, I'd like to keep Graphite, as I like the way it looks.\n\nEdit: Switching to light mode doesn't make a difference (Graphite is still invisible on Preview):\n\nIs there a fix for this short of reinstalling the OS or switching to a different PDF-viewing app (I know Preview is abysmal, but it's convenient for several reasons)? Also, does anyone know why it happens?\nEdit: I just tested it in Catalina (10.15.6, only tested dark mode), and Graphite works. The selection is rather light, but that's okay; at least it's visible. Seems to be a Mojave-only issue.\n\nA: I had a similar issue on macOS Catalina 10.15.1.\nUpgrading to 10.15.2 resolved the issue.

Two Catalina (10.15.6 / 19G2021) and two Mojave (10.14.6 / 18G6020 ).\nTo generate the PDF - I used the free Pages app and created a new document, the modern novel template, and exported it as PDF. You can see the text selection areas overlap - they are subtle / additive.\n\nI tried dark mode, light mode, grey and blue text selection and I couldn't get Preview to glitch. You might want to repeat this test or investigate what PDF are causing this - I don't doubt what you report, but don't think it's a general bug or one that's affecting most PDF. Hopefully this helps you and others to know what the expected results are and trigger some extra attention on reproducing this or narrowing which PDF could have this bug.\n", "Q: Siri doesn't work in macOS Mojave I have a MacBook Pro 15 with TB.

This works for whatever #!/bin/whatever shell or script you start the text file. \nAppleScript can open documents just like when Finder clicks on them to open, this should be a fairly universal way to accomplish your task.\n\nA: Probably too late to the party, but I just met the same problem today.

I know there has been several posts from recent years about this, but none of the answers really addressed my question here. \nGoal:\nTo understand how Live Photos are stored so I can effectively back up (currently using Time Machine and SpiderOak with \"download and store originals\" turned on in iCloud Photo Library settings).\nQuestion: It seems like all images (NOT including the \"Live\" .mov file) and videos are stored in Photos Library.photoslibrary/masters, which is great, but when I want to find the \"Live\" part of each .heic file, I wasn't able to find them, and the .heic file doesn't seem to contain the video portion. So far, the closest I've come is by finding .mov files with completely unrelated names under Photos Library.photoslibrary/resources/media/masters/ and it contains a very confusing folder structure and unrelated file names. This folder not only seems to contain the .mov files of the \"live\" photos, but also other jpeg files with unclear purposes. \nAgain, I'm simply trying to understand this to have peace of mind that when I back up Photos Library.photoslibrary, all my Live Photos and edits, etc. are backed up. Furthermore, I'd like to be able to use these files (photos + \"live\" videos) across devices that may not run MacOS. \nAny insights?\nMacOS Mojave version 10.14.5\niCloud Photos Library: ON (downloading and storing all originals)\n\nA: For the simply have piece of mind I would recommend Time Machine to more than one destination and rotating one of the drives off site. \nYou can have multiple destinations, so get three drives. A, B and C. \nSet up A and when the first backup completes remove it and add B and C as dual destinations. Ship A off for a week or a month. If you’re paranoid, ship B away and when it’s safe, bring back A and add it and remove B from the destinations. \nContinue the cycle - you’ll have equal data usage and could even leave one drive offline so that for one week, all the backups go to that drive, then swap next week to the other on site and do the offsite rotation once a month. \nEvery 14 days, you’ll get a reminder to reconnect missing drives if you don’t remove them as a destination. \nIf three drives or offsite backup is too much cost or hassle, simplify as your needs dictate. \n", "Q: Thunderbird Could not connect to server My wife's MacBook Pro running macOS 10.14.3 suddenly developed a problem with Thunderbird 60.7.0.\nIt cannot connect to any email server and produces an error \"Could not connect to server\" \"The connection was ref...\"\nI have checked the email accounts, and can logon from Google Chrome on my iMac and on her computer.\nWhat steps can we take to resolve this without losing existing emails?\n\nTime Machine backup (about a week ago) and a fresh backup just now.\nTime & Date OK.\nI deleted Thunderbird app, and re-installed from a fresh download.

I'm using a slow motion video recorded using an iPhone 7+ to track something but would like to avoid using a chronometer to know the time the process is taking. I need to measure about 10 seconds with an uncertainty of at most 0.1 s. Is this possible by just counting 2400 frames of my homemade video?\n\nA: An easy, but not 100% accurate way of ensuring this, is simply to right-click the video in Photos on your Mac and select \"Get Info\". This will show the average number of frames per second over the whole video. This is usually not exactly 240, but extremely close.\nObviously as it is an average it can vary very slightly from one range to another within the file, but for most usages this is just fine.\nIf you want to be absolutely precise, you'll need to look inside the HEVC file itself, to see exactly how many frames are in each second in the file (i.e. look at every second by itself - not doing an average over the whole file). This requires you to be proficient with video file formats at a programmer level. \n\nA: if you can start a stopwatch and include that in the frame of the slomo video you can get a pretty decent approximation of the time.\n", "Q: \"To watch this video, change your restrictions in Settings.\", but my restrictions are off I'm trying to launch a video from the TV app on my Apple TV, but when I click on it I get the error message \"To watch this video, change your restrictions in Settings.\".

Why the difference?\n\nA: I haven't tested this, but it looks like you have too many levels of quotes there. You manually put double-quotes around the command to be run over ssh (in the set fn to \"\\\"/usr/bin/open ... & \"\\\"\" line), and then use quoted form of fn, which adds another level of quotes. It looks fine when you echo it, but that's because the shell parses & removes one level of quotes before passing to the echo command.\nAlso, if the file path contains spaces or other funny characters, those need to be quoted (but only that path part, not the entire command). Try this instead:\non run {input, parameters}\n    repeat with fn in input\n        set fn to POSIX path of fn\n        set fn to \"/Volumes/MachineA\" & fn\n        set fn to \"/usr/bin/open -a /Applications/Preview.app \" & quoted form of fn\n        set cmd to \"ssh -x MachineB.local \" & quoted form of fn\n        do shell script \"echo \" & quoted form of cmd & \" >> ~/cmd.log\"\n        do shell script cmd\n    end repeat\nend run\n\n", "Q: Mac completely freezes when waking up from sleep When I wake my MacBook Pro 15 inch up from a long period of time (2-5 hours) of sleep, my Mac shows a black screen (there is clearly some backlighting, so its on, just showing only black), and my Touchbar is on.

You probably just need to reset your System Management Controller (SMC), which controls things like how your computer sleeps/wakes and responds to opening the lid from sleep, etc.\nIf this does not work, you could go a step further and reset your Nonvolatile Random- Access Memory (NVRAM) and/or your Parameter Ram (PRAM). These two things store small pieces of memory related to your system settings. The SMC, NVRAM, and PRAM all sometimes contain errors, or simply bug out, which just requires a quick resetting of their stored information. Sometimes the steps for resetting each differs depending on your model Mac, so I suggest reading through Apple's Official docs on their steps here:\nHow to reset your Mac's SMC\nand\nHow to reset your Mac's NVRAM or PRAM\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: Messages app on iPhone do not play alert/vibrate for SMS received from some numbers I get no sound (or vibration) in my iPhone when a I receive a message from certain numbers.

The code should appear in Safari as an AutoFill option in the relevant field as soon as the SMS is delivered to Messages on your Mac. \n\niOS and macOS use local data detector heuristics to work out whether an incoming message carries a security code, and Apple says the Security Code AutoFill feature does not alter the security of this two-factor authentication method.\n\nIf you have such a setup, your iPhone doesn't play any sound or vibrate for the received message, and the SMS is automatically marked as read on your iPhone.\n\nA: It did. Now it doesn't. I was trying to change the message TONE/SOUND and when I did, and did a test auto fill, all I get is a vibrate now on the iPhone, nothing on the Mac. Used to have a pop up that I could choose to autofill a security code. Now. Crickets. Awesome. All I did was change the sound on the message. I'm been in notifications, allow, don't allow, focus, sounds, etc etc trying to figure out why it no longer works. Monterey. Was working fine. All I did was \"just simply\" change the tone.\n", "Q: Disable Bluetooth \"roaming\" on Macbook Pro So, my Macbook Pro (15-inch, 2018) are often bluetooth \"roaming\" and connecting to devices (like my headphones) despite being on battery power with closed lid. I would very much like to disable this feature – seems like a bit of a security/privacy concern as well.\nAny ideas on how to disable bluetooth when lid is closed?\n\nA: Actually, your MBP do not disconnect bluetooth when closing the lid. So if you turn on devices known (like your headphones) they will connect together. I also found this annoying when I wanted to connect my headphones to my phone but they always connected to my MBP...\nYou could install blueutil and SleepWatcher via homebrew and set a .sleep code to do \"/usr/local/bin/blueutil -p 0\" when going to sleep mode.\nTo use SleepWatcher, make a shell script in your home directory named .sleep and give it permission with the chmod command.\nYou also can do a .wake code to turn bluetooth back on with blueutil -p 1\nYou can find out how to use sleepwatcher here \n", "Q: C++11 on Snow Leopard 10.6.8 I'm trying to install C++11 on 10.6.8, following this macports guide\nUnfortunatley the guide fails when I get to step 7: Rebuild cctools and ld64 to use the newer version of llvm:\nsudo port -v -n upgrade --force --enforce-variants cctools -llvm34 +llvm40\nfails with the error messsage:\nIn file included from /usr/include/limits.h:64:\n\n/usr/include/machine/limits.h:10:2: error: architecture not supported\n\n#error architecture not supported\n\n/usr/include/machine/limits.h is:\n/* This is the `system' limits.h, independent of any particular\n   compiler.

However, I just can find the rectangular or square crop options in \"markup\".\nDoes anybody know how to crop photos in circle in iPad without using an app? If an app is necessary what would be the best free app?\n\nA: A quick Web search reveals an app that offers exactly this feature:\n\n\n*\n\n*Krop Circle\nThe app is a free download with In-App purchase. This is an iPhone only app, but can run on iPad in compatibility (letterbox) mode.\nNo affiliation whatsoever with the developer.\n\nA: There isn’t a native circle crop on iOS or iPad OS so you’ll need a third party too to assist with this.\nMy favorites are Pixelmator and Pixelmator Photo. The photo version doesn’t have this crop, but Pixelmator for iOS can crop easily as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the elliptical select feature to draw a circle (the pixel guides let you make it a perfect circle when you match the height / width)\n\n*Tap invert to invert the selection - selecting everything outside the circle.\n\n*Tap done to end the selection.\n\n*Tap the area you wish to delete - then tap delete\n\n\nSave the image back to your files / share it as needed.\nYou can do an overlay for free with Keynote as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*pick the black or white template as you wish)\n\n*Import the image as the entire slide\n\n*Overlay the gear shape (circle with gear teeth outside) ⚙️\n\n\n*\n\n*Same as the ellipse in Pixelmator, you need to grow the shape to be an ellipse or circle.  \n\n*Then make the gear shape black/white and save out or make a screen snap.\n\n\n\n\nSince keynote is free and you can save out your presentation, swap in new images quite easily, I can’t imagine you’ll spend so much time learning keynote that a free app that may or may not sell out your privacy is better than learning to edit photos. I also really like Pixelmator so try that if you think it will be a great tool for things other than this one circle crop function.\n", "Q: Is it possible to share iCloud Notes with non-Apple device users?

However, it could reasonably have been made by someone in the middle of a mkdir command thinking that they should just list the directory first - and then erraneously running mkdir ls.\nBy the way - the directory /Users/xxxx is not called the root directory, but rather the user's home directory. \n", "Q: How to edit .imovielibrary extension as project? On iMovie 10.1.6 for Macbook Pro High Sierra 10.13.6— I'm trying to edit a project/clip which has been autosaved by iMovie with a .imovielibrary extension. \nWhen I try to open it to edit in iMovie, it shows me the saved movie clip in My Media and allows me to drag to panel below. Doing so seems to have saved none of the transitions, overlaid music, etc necessary to make additional edits. Checking My Movie above in Project Media is the same story.\nQuestion: How can I recover / open the video clip with the transitions, overlays, etc so I can begin where I left off?\n\nThen I thought I should click on All Events then drag them onto the library clip but it won't let me drag or otherwise add the events:\n\nOriginally I thought I may have lost them, so I checked in the cached folder and it's the same deal here (no editable \"project\" files):\n~/Users/me/Library/Containers/com.apple.iMovieApp/Data/Library/Caches/iMovie Backups.localized\n\nA: Found the answer. You cannot open an .imovielibrary and open it as project from the first interface. It will default to opening the library of finished movie clips and allow you to drag into the timeline (which won't include any of your transitions, etc available for edit).\nInstead, you need to click the Return to Projects button on the top left (which it will then ask you to save your current project. Save it then delete it). \n\nYou will see your project file there. It won't default (at least it didn't for me) to opening it as a project, instead it will default it opening it as a playable movie. You need to click the ellipsis button under the project thumbnail and explicitly tell it to open as project:\n\n", "Q: How can I toggle Automatic Graphics Switching using terminal?

Yes, the answers are the same, but the questions are not.\n\nA: The system default $PATH variable is set in the file /etc/paths. That file has a one directory per line structure.  \nThere are also multiple others files that can set or modify the path variable - user specific configuration files, and shell specific ones, that only apply if you use that specific shell.\nI suggest not editing the system default file (/etc/paths) as it would affect all users. To add directories to the path used in a Terminal session (and assuming that you use the default bash shell), generate a file named .bash_profile. With a text editor, create a line that adds the directories you want to the default path, e.g:  \nPATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$HOME/projects  \n\nThat will add the directories \"bin\" and \"projects\" in your home directory to the system path. You will need to either execute source .bash_profile or restart your terminal session for that change to become effective.\n", "Q: Add Spacebar as a modifier key I want to configure my shortcuts to switch between multiple desktops.

If I use Command (which is a bit easier for me to reach), then it collides with my copy and paste shortcuts.\nI would prefer a native solution but I am ready to use an app as well.\n\nA: There are native shortcuts which let you go to specific Desktop by Control + 1 etc.\nBut according to your needs to remove your conflicts with Copy/Paste shortcut, edit the keys by going to System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts. Then you can add/edit Shortcuts to use CMD + C etc for going to specific applications. \n", "Q: Installing USB drivers Is there a way to force macOS to reinstall a set of USB drivers for a device? \nI have a pair of headphones from Sennheiser that are no longer recognised, i.e. not shown as an output device in the Sound Preferences.\n\nA: Drivers and firmware get updated as part of OS installation and all OS installations now are archive and install which means the OS builds up a clean OS with all the drivers needed, patches firmware and then runs the migration script to move in any custom drivers you have.\nThat's a great first step if you ever feel your firmware or drivers are not up to snuff.\nIf you don't have a caching server locally - then download the OS installer from the Mac App Store then run the installer over lunch or when you're done for the evening. You can also boot to recovery or internet recovery on newer Macs and reinstall.\nCaching server will cache the installer, so you might be done with the download at LAN speeds (6 minutes or less) and the install takes maybe 10 minutes for the part everyone has to run.

Also what is the difference between single and dual graphics?\n\nA: \nMobile app development using Xcode. Single Graphics vs Dual Graphics?\n\nA Mac with dual graphics (integrated + dedicated) is preferred when working on graphic intensive projects.\nGenerally speaking, a more recently introduced model is equipped with better internals (such as newer generation of processor and faster RAM/internal storage).\nYou should pay attention to the machine specifications and your use-case to choose an appropriate one as it can differ from person to person and task to task. You need to base your decision on criterion such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Processor generation, frequency and performance gain (year-over-year)\n\n*Amount and frequency of RAM\n\n*Amount of speed of internal storage\n\n*Screen size/real estate and supported resolutions\n\n*Ports, their speed and support for external display and accessories.\n\nCan any one please tell me which one is better for Xcode based on the year?\n\nDepends on your specific use case (and budget) as discussed above. You can compare the detailed specs for the two mentioned models and base your decision on that. Check the following link:\n\n\n*\n\n*Table of third generation MacBook Pro models.\n\n\n\nAlso what is the difference between single and dual graphics?\n\nA MacBook with dual graphics quite literally means that it is equipped with dual graphics card. The one with single graphics card comes equipped with Intel Integrated graphics (which is generally speaking fine for day to day usage). Dual graphics MacBook Pro includes a dedicated graphics card in addition to the Intel Integrated card, and the operating system includes the support for automatic switching between the two.\nA dual graphics machine is preferred when you need good performance in graphics intensive tasks/projects, gaming, or have a project that needs to utilize GPU compute.\n", "Q: Office for macOS: Word document opens in a tiny window I'm using Office for Mac version 16.25 (2019) on a Mac macOS High Sierra.

On my iPhone 6s Plus running iOS 10, the Clash Royale game app takes up 800 MB of space, but on my iPad mini 2 running iOS 12, it takes up only 190 MB.\nThe Clash Royale account on my iPhone is the same as on the iPad, so it has the same data in both, and I usually play it more on the iPad than on the iPhone. How come it takes more storage on my iPhone? Is it because my phone is running iOS 10?\n\nA: Okay, so there might be a couple of reasons for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your iPhone is below iOS 10.3, this difference may stem from the different file system format (Apple moved to APFS starting in iOS 10.3). This optimizes your app code size since APFS optimizes storage out of the box. See Here, Apple's Filesystem Documentation\n\n*Otherwise, it might simply because of the difference in handing the iPad and iPhone cases by the developer. There might be a multitude of reasons ranging from internal app data caching, internal testing to A/B testing of features. \n", "Q: Does macOS still use Yarrow as it's cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator?

So I mailed Craig Federighi recently about this, concerned that macOS wasn’t capable of generating >128bit quality keys. \nHe responded!\n\n‘The source you were referencing is out of date.  You can find more current informations here:   FIPS certification document, section 7: \"The NDRNG feeds entropy from the pool into the DRBG on demand.  The NDRNG provides 256-bits of entropy.”’\n\nWhat a legend. \n\nSo yup, macOS and iOS are both capable of generating 256 bit entropy and creating quality CS keys for both ECC and Symmetric Key crypto. \nEDIT: Apple confirmed the kernel CPRNG is a Fortuna-derived design targeting a 256-bit security level.\n\nA: It seems as of 10.14 Apple are still using Yarrow.  \nThe source of xnu-4903.221.2/osfmk/prng/random.h says \"...we retain Yarrow.\" and the subsequent code is conditioned on Yarrow being hard coded true:\nvoid early_random_cpu_init(int cpu);\n\n/*\n * Wrapper for requesting a CCKPRNG operation.\n * This macro makes the DRBG call with pre-emption disabled to ensure that\n * any attempt to block will cause a panic.

and back into iCloud\n\n*Reinstall macOS via internet recovery\n\n*killall bird\n\n*killall bird followed by reboot\n\n*Delete ~/Library/Application Support/CloudDocs/ and wait for it to rebuild\n\n*Delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist and ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist.\nWhat could cause this behavior? What is the fix?\nMy machine synced fine with iCloud (including Desktop and Documents in their expected locations) before restoring my old machine's ~/Library, so I'm fairly certain there is some file or preferences in there that are causing this. Any others I should try deleting to give iCloud Drive a \"factory reset\", without losing all my other restored application settings?\n\nA: Looks like the culprit was a circular link at ~/Documents. If this is the case for you, oddly Documents won’t appear at all in your home directory in Finder. However you’ll notice some weird things:\n\n\n*\n\n*That odd empty slot in your Finder Preferences > Sidebar tab (see above)\n\n*If you try to create a folder called Documents in your home directory, you get a Finder error dialog saying it already exists.\n\n*If you try to open Documents using Finder > Go > Documents (⇧+⌘+O), you get a Finder error dialog saying it doesn't exist.\nHere's the giveaway: run ls -l in your home directory, and look for Documents. Here's what I saw:\nlrwxr-xr-x@   1 jacob  staff    22 Jun 11 15:39 Documents -> /Users/jacob/Documents\n\nA quick rm Documents and that was taken care of.\nWait 2 minutes, (apparently some background process has to notice the deletion) then suddenly the Desktop and Documents Folders checkbox under the iCloud PrefPane begins sticking again.\nAbout two hours later (it can take a while) and I saw all my iCloud Drive files being populating my Desktop and Documents in droves.\n\nThe above, of course, is a bit of a simplification. Because this has been so perplexing I'll say exactly what I did—who knows which of these steps mattered.\n\n\n*\n\n*I actually ran rm -rf ~/Documents (note the -rf flags)\n\n* > About This Mac > Storage > Manage…\n\n*Under Recommendations tab, click Store in iCloud…\n\n*Check Desktop and Documents\n\n*Store in iCloud (I believe I recall this also not \"sticking\" when I pulled up that panel again, but I did it nonetheless)\n\n\n\n\n\n*Wait 2 minutes. Actually make it 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n*System Preferences > iCloud > iCloud Drive > Options… > Documents (tab) > check Desktop & Documents Folders\n\n*This time, it stuck. A few moments later Documents and Desktop showed up under the iCloud section in my Finder sidebar.\n\n*Wait a long time for it all to sync. Possibly overnight. Files tend to show up in batches, per folder. If you have Optimize Storage on it appears that files under 1MB are downloaded in full while files over 1MB only have metadata downloaded.\n\n\nA: I have been experiencing the same issues as above, minus the blank named checkbox also. I am running Catalina Beta too. I followed the instructions in Kevin's suggestion - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203538 and did a reboot, seemed to fix the issue for me. Many thanks!\n\nA: For everyone stumbling upon this with iCloud sync issues, this might be useful:\n\n*\n\n*Testing iCloud using Cirrus\n\n\n*Cirrus app – takes control of iCloud, investigates and diagnoses its problems\n\n\n*Mints might also be useful, to investigate logs.\n", "Q: How can I find iPhone apps uploading a lot of data? Why do the iPhones in my home periodically use up all the upload bandwidth? Happens at least once a week, likely once a day or something.\nI only notice when I get annoyed by slow internet.\nHow do I analyse which app is causing this this?\n\nA: It is unclear whether Bandwidth is from Cellular data or Wi-Fi setup separately. So I will do both.\nIn Settings → Cellular/ Mobile Data, after waiting for sometime, all the apps that consume data appear in descending order of used data. If Low-Power mode is off and sufficient battery power is available, then Photos and videos and iCloud Drive files will upload to iCloud if the feature Use Data for iCloud is turned on. To avoid extra usage this should be turned off.\nFor Wi-Fi, such usage chart is not available in iPhone natively. Two indirect approaches are:\n\n\n*\n\n*See the biggest files or app-usage of iCloud. Go to Settings → Apple ID → iCloud → Manage Storage. \n\n*It is less accurate but go to Settings → Battery → Usage pattern. This can be a mix of a lot of activities but most apps that are at the top use a lot of bandwidth in my iPhone. \n", "Q: Determine which device AirPods have connected to using Siri When I put on my AirPods, they automatically connect to the device that they were most recently connected to. However, without checking each device, I'm not sure which device they've connected to.\nI'm looking for a command I can say to Siri that will differentiate the device so that I know which device they have connected to. Ideally, it would be something like\n\n\n*\n\n*Which device are my AirPods connected to?\nbut if that's not possible then another phrase that identifies the connected device. It has to be something that only needs voice/hearing, not looking at any device's screen.\n\nA: For iOS devices you can use this shortcut.  I am not able to test it on macos, but it works on my iPad Pro and my iPhone X. When I try it on my Series 3 Apple Watch it just hangs. Just assign it whatever custom text you want Siri to recognize. \n", "Q: Tell iPhone that this wifi is a hotspot so it doesn't download 1MB/s for no reason when idle I've just connected my iPhone to my mobile 10GB wifi hotspot. Went to the hotspot's setup page and it turns out the iPhone is consuming about 1MB of data per second. \niCloud Drive and Backup is turned off, automatic App Store updates are turned off, iPhone is in low-power mode and I've tried force-closing all apps with no success. \nI'm really frustrated with this, what else is there to deactivate?\n\nA: No - on iOS 12 and lower, the device will not conserve data when you connect to WiFi.\nApple has previewed and announced that there will be a low data mode as part of iOS 13. This announcement was made at WWDC in June 2019 and also listed toward the bottom of this feature announcement page:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-13-preview/features/\n\nLow Data Mode\nApps on your iPhone reduce their network data usage.\n\nYou would need some more elaborate networking filter to reduce data usage via WiFi when tethered or just connected to WiFi today on shipping iOS. For now, the practical way is to closely monitor and manage your updates and settings so you don’t automatically update when connected to WiFi or ensure those downloads and syncs complete before you rejoin your hotspot.\nYou can use services to proxy or log data connections. Two I think are very useful are CharlesProxy and guardian firewall:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/ios/\n\n*https://guardianapp.com/blog/2019/06/introducing-guardian-firewall-for-ios/\nThey both do more than simply meter bandwidth, but are trusted and clear how they generate revenue and are unlikely to abuse your data or privacy if you cannot wait for Apple solutions. \n", "Q: Can I delete the \"remove the drive\" menu in menu-bar in Catalina?

Tapping it only reveals \"no drive\" menu and I has not been able to find anything relevant on System Preferences.\n\nA: Removing icons from the menu bar for several versions of macOS has the same process. Knowing that, I’ll guess you are referring to this eject icon:\n\nThis is the Disk Eject Icon. \nIf you hold the ⌘ Command key down while clicking on the icon you should be able to drag it out of the menu bar and it will be gone.\nIf that ain't it add your image to the question and we'll go from there.\n", "Q: Unable to change author name in an ebook on iPad I have a Mac computer where I downloaded an ePub and then changed the author on the Mac in the list view of iBooks.\n\n\n*\n\n*MacOS 10.12.6 Sierra\n\n*iOS 12.3.1 for the iPad\n\n\nThen I dragged and dropped the ePub from iBooks to desktop.

I need to organize my files and this issue is really frustrating. \nCan anyone help point out how I might make a change to the author data of an eBook I didn't author initially?\n\nA: After hours of frustration, I finally found a solution to my problem by doing the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder.\n\n*Click Go in the Finders menu and select Go to Folder.\n\n*Type ~/Library/Caches in the window currently displayed and click Go.\n\n*Locate the iBooks file and move it to trash. \n\n*Airdrop the same ePub file to iPad.\n\n\nFollowing these steps I was able to see the accurate and updated author name on my iPad. \n", "Q: Disk has multiple partitions but Disk Utility can only mount first one View from Disk Utility:\n\nOutput of diskutil (for this disk only):\n/dev/disk6 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *80.0 GB    disk6\n   1:               Windows_NTFS                         34.9 GB    disk6s1\n   2:                      Linux                         10.7 GB    disk6s5\n   3:                 Linux_Swap                         2.1 GB     disk6s6\n   4:                      Linux                         32.2 GB    disk6s7\n\nThe first NTFS partition, \"--\", mounts just fine as read-only.

I need to download an application that requires Windows.\nCan I install Windows 7 on my iPad Pro?\n\nA: No, it is not possible to install Windows 7 on an iPad Pro. You'll need a desktop/laptop computer to run Windows.\nUnlike generally available consumer computers, where you can choose to install supported operating system of your choice, it is not possible to change the operating system on your iPad (or iOS devices in general).\nTo install Windows, you'll need access to a PC computer. If you do not have access to a PC, Apple's desktop/laptop computers branded as Mac are capable of running Windows both natively or in a virtual machine.\n", "Q: WhatsApp iCloud backup stuck at 0% and just won't move Last successful backup of WhatsApp to iCloud was on 10th April 2019, since then the process keeps hanging.\nMy iCloud is as good as unused, it has 4.5 GB/5 GB available, so I doubt space is the issue.\nStatus is \"Backing up...\" and its hung at \"Uploading: 0%\"\nWhat did I try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Updated iOS to 12.3.1.\n\n*Updated WhatsApp to version 2.19.61.\n\n*Deleted WhatsApp data from iCloud Drive and tried to backup again. Instead of getting stuck at 0% it then got stuck at 3%.\n\n*In iCloud Drive, turned WhatsApp \"Off\" and \"On\"\n\n*Hard reset on iPhone\nNothing works! Anyone tips or the same problem?\n\nA: I had this issue on iOS 13 and Whatsapp support magically got back to me.\nWhatsapp needs 2.05x the backup size available on your iPhone, and in its infinite wisdom also in iCloud.  So if your backup is past 2.4ish GB, you are essentially forced to start paying Apple for additional iCloud storage.\nI can personally verify this worked.  I tried everything (other troubleshooting steps include turning off iCloud Drive and deleting anything Whatsapp already put in iCloud).  After getting stuck randomly between 0%, 4% and 10% I moved to 50GB, flipped back to Whatsapp and it immediately continued progressing.\nMaybe one day Whatsapp will let us manually backup to Google Drive or otherwise just spit out a file we can restore from...\n", "Q: Converting macos dictionaries to portable format The best thing about macos is the dictionaries accessible from dictionary.app.  Is there a way to convert them to a format that is usable on other platforms as well (such as the dict format or the stardict format)?\nAlternatively, is there a way to extract them into a plain text format?  (How are they stored anyway and where?)\nPS\nThere is this\nhttps://gist.github.com/josephg/5e134adf70760ee7e49d\nfor extracting word lists.  Perhaps it could be changed to extract the whole dictionaries as well?\n\nA: Dictionaries used to be in /System/Library/Dictionaries, but they were moved (c. Sierra?) to various subfolders in /System/Library/Assets/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX.\nThe format is a package, and the data files inside seem to be some non-human-readable binary data format, though they start off life as XML files.\nAssuming you've searched for projects that can import Apple's dictionaries, rather than just exporting them, and found nothing; then the task may be 'non-trivial', and you may be better off using the very good open source DICT format files.\n", "Q: Is that possible to check an iPad's total power-on lifetime since its manufacture? I just bought a brand new 2019 iPad Air. But I am afraid it's not a brand new one. I know I could check the model or serial number, but I don't really trust that approach.\nI think it's best to check the power-on lifetime if there is a hidden feature in Settings somewhere (or enter some magic numbers in the dial-up panel like what Android devices do).\nThus is it possible to check iPad's total power-on lifetime since its manufacture?\n\nA: It is not generally possible to determine the total power-on lifetime of an iOS device.\nTo determine how much the device is used, a better indicator is to determine the battery charge cycle count. A single charge cycle count is equivalent to one complete discharge or the device's battery. For a new device, the cycle count value is a low value between 0-2.\nTo determine the battery charge cycle count, you can use an app such as coconutBattery.\n\nAdditionally, if you are running the current latest version of iOS 12, you can determine is still covered under limited warranty. On your iPad, go to Settings app → About and look for an item named Limited Warranty. It will show the warranty expiry data. The devices whose warranty has expired, this item is not shown altogether.\n\nThe last mentioned approach uses the device serial number and fetches the warranty expiry date from Apple's servers. Since the limited warranty for iOS devices bought from Apple is for 1 year from the date of purchase, I think it's a good measure that can be used to determine the genuinity of the device. \nThese two approaches should help you with confidently getting answer for your concerns.\n", "Q: Block unwanted Gmail Texts Yesterday a person texted my phone through a Gmail account and I thought it was just an accident or a bot or something. I reported it as junk and it deleted their initial “Hi.” But since then they’ve messaged me 2 more times, so now I’m assuming is just a creep.\nHow would I go about blocking this Gmail, so I can no longer receive messages from them?\nI tried looking up how to block numbers, but when I click the Information button and scroll down, “Block this caller” doesn’t even appear to be a button..? \nI then looked up how to block Gmails, but nothing came up that would help.\n\nA: I faced a similar issue where some stranger sending me creepy texts using Gmail chat. I simply sent a SMS with the keyword \"Stop\", and after that I didn't get a single text from that email address on my phone number. I'm not entirely sure if it would work in 2019, but you can give it a try. Same thing is suggested in this old article: https://techwithlove.com/how-to-send-sms-from-gmail. So it might worth a try!\nIf supported by your carrier, then you can login to your account and block that email from sending you text messages.

There I used to have a fixed number of desktops running full-screen apps. I've managed to configure it on Mac, but yet can not find the way to assign shortcuts to switch between them. For ex. to use Command + 1 to go to the first full-screen desktop.\nSeveral years ago I've been using some app to do so, but I can not find it now. Any ideas on how to do it?\n\nA: I would suggest to simply activate the predefined shortcuts within:\nSystem Preferences… > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Mission Control\n\n\nThese shortcut could be replaced by ⌘1, ⌘2…\nby clicking on the shortcut part of the shortcut definition line (I love this kind of hidden function to make an OS looks like an exploration game to keep our brain on fighting position).\nI didn't because I use these default shortcuts within X11 to switch between windows.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences app → Keyboard → Shortcuts and you can assign keyboard shortcuts to move across Spaces (desktops).\n\nYou can also use the F3 (Mission Control) key on your Mac's keyboard to get a birds eye view of all the Spaces (desktops in Mac parlance) and quickly and directly switch to the desired one. However, this will also involve using the mouse/trackpad.\nIf you are looking for a 3rd-party tool which lets you customize keyboard shortcuts with much fine grain control, a popular app among users of macOS is Karabiner.\n\nA: I've found the solution. An application called Keyboard Maestro (KM). It allows for creating very complex scenarios.\nFor my case, it is very simple. Just create Activate a Specific Application inside the Switching Group and assign a hotkey combination.\nEDIT:\nThanks to @codepringle, https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai is definitely a better solution. Also, I've found this project, they are doing the same but differently ¯_(ツ)_/¯ https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst \nBut any of those are laggy as hell. Eventually, I had to go back to linux + https://i3wm.org/ to have stable window navigation.  \n", "Q: Is it possible to block access to Safari's extensions? I'd like my son to have access to Safari but not to the extensions, as these provide content blockers to innapropriate material.

Is there currently (iOS 12) any way to let a friend or child try a game on an iOS device, starting from the tutorial, without losing my own progress?\n\nA: In general, no. The game developer can store progress on the device locally, on an iCloud / Game Center log in basis (or both) or save data off on a private server / public cloud.\nIt really depends very specifically on how the game was programmed to behave and you’d need to contact each vendor / read their documentation or experiment to understand how or if game progress and data persist on iOS.\nEven deleting an app won't remove some game data and some people love that and others, not so much.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I delete an iOS game and retain my progress?\n\nA: Settings → Game Centre has options to Sign out, set up different Apple ID for Game Centre or use a different profile. \n", "Q: I can't delete photos on my iPhone 4s even though the delete button is there, why? I've selected the photos I want to delete but, the delete button isn't turning blue. They were all taken on the iPhone but, the sim card has been removed. Do I need the sim card or not to delete the images?\n\nA: SIM presence changes nothing. Even if you have iCloud photos you can delete photos without service or network and then those changes will only sync up once you connect.\nSomething else is amiss.

Also, after installing the Window Support Software, the Apple Software Update application provided a download of a \"Boot Camp Update Version 6.1.9\".\n\nI did an upgrade on my iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) from a previous version of Windows 10 to the current version. The Windows 10 May 2019 Update (1903) Edition ISO file was downloaded from the official Microsoft website. Afterwards, the Mac would get the following \"Blue Screen of Death\" error message.\n\nThe Windows Support Software was downloaded by using the BootCamp Assistant. I confirmed the files are the same as the files that can be downloaded from the Apple website Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621. I installed Windows 10 to legacy BIOS boot.\n\nNote: The Windows Support Software download by using the Boot Camp Assistant can vary depending on the Mac model.\n\nBelow is some information about my configuration.\niMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011)\niMac12,1\nHigh Sierra Version 10.13.6\nBootCamp Version 5.1 (Build 5621)\nWindows 10 May 2019 Update (1903) English Edition.\nWin10_1903_V1_English_x64.iso  \nI also tried a clean install of Windows 10 and this made no difference. The error still occurred. How can I avoid getting this error message?\nAfter some investigation, I found the error occurs after installing the Windows Support Software. After some trial and error experiments, I determined the offending file in Windows Support Software is named BootCamp/Drivers/Apple/BootCamp.msi.\n\nA: \nNote: I have tested the Windows 10 November 2019 Update (1909) Edition and so far this problem has not occurred. Also, after installing the Window Support Software, the Apple Software Update application provided a download of a \"Boot Camp Update Version 6.1.9\".\n\nI found a solution which involves using a newer version of the BootCamp.msi file. I did this by downloading the Windows Support Software on a iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013). Since not everyone reading this will have a newer model Mac, I have provided a alternate method for retrieving this file. This method was derived from Chris F Carroll's answer to the question: How to download Bootcamp drivers without Bootcamp assistant? The nice thing about this answer is the Window Support Software is downloaded directly from Apple without the use of any third part tools.\nThe Windows Support Software for the iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013) can be downloaded by following the steps given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on this link to download the BootCampESD.pkg file directly from Apple.\n\nNote: If this link is broken, then post a comment and I will try to update the link.\n\n\n*Double click on the  BootCampESD.pkg file in the Finder application to start the \"BootCampESD Installer\".\n\n*Follow the instructions. This will save the WindowsSupport.dmg file to the /Library/Application Support/BootCamp folder.\n\n*Double click on the WindowsSupport.dmg file in the Finder application to mount the disk image. The volume label will be Boot Camp. \n\n*Use to Finder application to locate the BootCamp.msi file in the BootCamp/Drivers/Apple folder of the device labeled Boot Camp. This is the Windows installer for Boot Camp Version 6.0 (Build 6136).\n\n\nBelow are two methods for solving the problem. I tried both and decided I preferred Method 2. Here a assume you have already used the Boot Camp Assistant on the iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) to download the Windows Support Software to a flash drive. \nMethod 1: Replace the existing BootCamp.msi file.\nReplace BootCamp.msi file in the BootCamp/Drivers/Apple folder on the flash drive with the new file. After the Windows installation completes, install the Boot Support Software by executing the setup application in the BootCamp folder on the flash drive. In some cases, this application may start automatically.\nI do not think this method resulted in all the drivers being installed. However the missing drivers where downloaded and installed after running \"Windows Update\" and \"Apple Software Update\".\nMethod 2: Upgrade Boot Camp immediately after installing the Windows Support Software.\nCopy the new BootCamp.msi file to the root folder on the flash drive. After the Windows installation completes, install the Boot Support Software by executing the setup application in the BootCamp folder on the flash drive. In some cases, this application may start automatically. You should first first encounter the window shown below. Follow the instructions to install the software.\n\nAfter the Windows Support Software finishing installing, you will get the window shown below. Click on the \"Finish\" button.\n\nIf you get the popup window shown below, click on the \"No\" button.\n\nNext, open a \"Administrator: Command Prompt\" window and enter the command given below.  Here, the assumption is made that the flash drive has been assign the drive letter D. If your flash drive has been assigned a different drive letter, then make the appropriate substitution.\nD:\\BootCamp.msi\n\nYou should encounter the window shown below. Follow the instructions to install the software.\n\nWhen the popup window below appears, click on the \"OK\" button.\n\nAfter the Windows Boot Camp Installer finishes, you will get the window shown below. Click on the \"Finish\" button.\n\nIf you get the popup window shown below, click on the \"Yes\" button. Otherwise, manual restart the Mac.\n\nNote: If you are in audit mode, do not use the \"System Preparation Tool\" to restart.\n\n\nFinal Notes\n\n\n*\n\n*When first executing \"Apple Software Update\" you may be asked to update \"Apple Software Update\" itself. If you happens, you should uncheck all other updates and just update \"Apple Software Update\". Otherwise, you may get an error message saying another update can not be installed. I my case, there were two updates of the \"Apple Software Update\" to download and install.\n\n*You may wonder why not use a more current Boot Camp Installer. I did\ntry the BootCamp.msi that comes with the Windows Support Software\nfor the iMac (21.5-inch, 2019). This is the Windows Boot Camp\ninstaller for Version 6.1 (Build 7438). I found this version to be\nmissing the ability to adjust the screen brightness. If you want to\ntry this version, then click on this link to download the\nBootCampESD.pkg file directly from Apple.\n\nNote: You can upgrade from Version 5.1 to either 6.0 or 6.1. However, you can not upgrade from 6.0 to 6.1.\n\n\nA: I had exactly the same issue on my 2010 iMac, it is a problem caused by one of the Boot Camp keyboard drivers being incompatible with 1903. I have temporarily fixed it by reverting to 1809 which works fine. I booted from a DVD and chose the \"repair my PC\" option and then chose \"Revert to a previous version of Windows\". Hopefully the Windows developers will fix this or otherwise it is possible to remove the one driver that causes the problem but it leads to problems controlling volume, brightness etc from the keyboard.\n", "Q: Set keyboard shortcuts to move to the next space to wrap around?

Just leave\n  it there, because if you close it, it will reappear after a while. \nWhen the Terminal window command ends with the message “No space left\n  on device,” the disk is full, and mission accomplished. Mac OS should\n  now have removed all the Purgeable space from the drive. Don’t forget\n  to empty the trashcan to regain the space.\n\nSource: https://www.jackenhack.com/mac-os-remove-purgeable-high-sierra/\nIf it doesn't help, OmniDiskSweeper http://www.omnigroup.com/more may also help you identify where the space is going. Good luck!\n\nA: On the assumption that you have APFS file system, macOS 10.14 Mojave, and local snapshots -  the system might take some time to purge the space. Just like a backup where the point is to go get a copy of a file you deleted after the delete, snapshots show the contents of a disk in the past and allow you to grab a copy of a past file while that snapshot exists.\nYou should also not be deleting the stub files in iCloud. If you run low on disk space, they take no space locally and exist in the cloud only, downloading on demand.\n\nHere are some details on snapshots from 2019. One easy way to check space is to open the system information app (or look in storage portion of about this Mac) and give it several minutes to catalog all the space into buckets. Your 40 GB of space that could have been 40 GB of documents will show up as grey colored System once the process completes. On more recent OS (2021 and later), open Disk Utility and select view APFS snapshots (command - shift - S) to see the space used by snapshots.\nSecond - check for local snapshots\ntmutil listlocalsnapshots /\n\nThere are command line options to force a purge of APFS snapshots:\ntmutil thinlocalsnapshots / $(echo \"10 * 1000000000\" | bc) 2\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I know if a time machine backup is running?\n\n*How to delete all local TimeMachine snapshots\nIf you don't have these, I would suggest making sure you have a good backup and restart to recovery mode and run a disk check to be sure the accounting / filesystem are in good shape.\nThe next thing to do would be to turn off iCloud and let all those files exist only in the cloud. This will prevent a local storage taking space.\nOnce you install the upgrade, you can turn on iCloud again and only download the files you need locally.\n\nA: TLDR: My workaround to access post-Catalina /Users/Shared/Relocated Items involved continuing to use this folder.  But deleting/moving to trash files from this location DID NOT recover disk space.\nI keep a Data directory outside of my user home folder, because I handle backups of these big/transient files differently.  With my installation of Catalina (10.15) and its separation of my SSD into separate diskName and diskName - Data APFS volumes I found the BIG Data dir had been moved into /Users/Shared/Relocated Items/.  Hmmm.  My hack was to create a simple alias/symbolic link ~userName/Data —> /Users/Shared/Relocated Items/Data  and have proceeded like that since, merrily adding and deleting new data under this path.\nBut for reasons I don’t understand, file space DELETED under /Users/Shared/Relocated Items/ does not seem to be recovered.  Even after Emptying Trash.  Even after using System/Storage Management to confirm Purged files are gone. Disk Utility says the file system is in fine shape.  Rebooting changes nothing.\nMy fix has been to copy the contents of /Users/Shared/Relocated Items/Data to an external drive, DELETE the entire directory, create a new directory /System/Volumes/Data/myData, and then copy all the data back from the external drive into this new directory.\nHere's hoping my pain is your gain!\n\nA: One possible cause of not seeing spaced get freed up even after deleting gigabytes of files is that MacOS is keeping files around as \"purgeable\" until it can be backed up by TimeMachine. The storage view in About This Mac might say you have free space, but Disk Utility says you don't. The problem I had was I had TimeMachine setup, but there was no external drive connected for a while. I ended up having ~460GB of purgeable disk space sitting around as TimeMachine snapshots. If you aren't going to reconnect the TimeMachine drive, then to remove these snapshots, run this command in Terminal: (you may have to disable TimeMachine first)\ntmutil thinlocalsnapshots / 999999999999999 4\n\nAnd after a little while you should see output like the following.\nThinned local snapshots:\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2022-12-21-110658.local\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2022-12-21-121438.local\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2022-12-21-131317.local\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2022-12-21-141449.local\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2022-12-21-152339.local\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2022-12-21-163251.local\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2022-12-21-172842.local\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2022-12-21-182910.local\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2022-12-21-192839.local\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2022-12-21-212540.local\n\nAnd your DiskUtility will report correctly the amount of free space.\n", "Q: How to delete a locked app, Karabiner?

I ran Disk Utility’s First Aid on a portable hard disk I use for Time Machine, which took around 13 hours (with no repairs being needed). I was wondering whether there’s a way to speed that up. Disk Utility’s output shows that it ran fsck_hfs -fy -x /dev/rdisk3, and so it doesn’t use the -c option, which according to the command’s man page “can result in better performance”:\n-c size Specify the size of the cache used by fsck_hfs internally.\n       Bigger size can result in better performance but can result\n       in deadlock when used with -l option.  Size can be speci-\n       fied as a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal number.  If the\n       number ends with a ``k'', ``m'', or ``g'', the number is\n       multiplied by 1024 (1K), 1048576 (1M), or 1073741824 (1G),\n       respectively.\n\nI was wondering whether anyone has experience using the -c option. Does fsck_hfs not use a cache at all when the option is not used, or does it use a default size? How large would I need to set the cache size to see significant, or even just any, performance improvement? I assume this depends on the size of the disk; mine is 1TB with Disk Utility showing it contains around 15.500.000 files.\n\nA: There are some sources saying you should set the cache size to maybe 1/2 of your installed memory.\nThis source says, that fsck_hfs is running a lot faster if you assign it 2200m cache (in this example for a 1TB drive):\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110829063745320\nI'm now going to experiment with that setting because my external 6TB time machine backup disk has fsck_hfs running since about 18 hours.\n", "Q: How to make Mojave's quick actions for movies show up in finder?

You cannot ask the system to stop that.\nYour options are either to a) let the decryption process finish, and then apply encryption again -- or b) backup the files off the drive, wipe the drive, create a new encrypted file system and copy back your files.\nOption (b) usually takes just as long as option (a), but requires a lot more manuals steps.

Another example is in the longer screenshot. 5f comes before 06a as 5 is smaller than 06.\nNumbers are smaller than alphabets in both cases.\nIn the code block, we have character-wise sorting where single digits are being compared. So a larger number like 062 sometimes comes before 06a as 2 is smaller than a.\n\nFor example, in alphabetical sorting \"z11\" would be sorted before \"z2\"\n  because \"1\" is sorted as smaller than \"2\", while in natural sorting\n  \"z2\" is sorted before \"z11\" because \"2\" is sorted as smaller than\n  \"11\".\nAlphabetical sorting:\nz11\nz2 \nNatural sorting:\nz2\nz11\nFunctionality to sort by natural sort order is built into many\n  programming languages and libraries\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order\n\nMac OS X sorting is based on the Unicode Collation Algorithm (Technical Standard UTS #10) defined by the Unicode Consortium. This standard provides a complete and unambiguous sort ordering for all Unicode characters and is available on the Unicode Consortium website (http://www.unicode.org).\n\nThere are no hints that this behaviour can be changed in Finder.

How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nA: You might not have understood it fully since your lid was closed.  So I will take you to an adventure to demonstrate what you would have seen if you left the lid open at the time.\nBattery Low (~15%)\nAround at 15% when running on battery power, the battery icon in the menu bar will turn red in order to notify you that your battery is starting to get low.\n\n\n\nBattery Critically Low (~5%)\nIf you ignore the initial low battery warning and keep on using DC power, the MacBook will warn you about the \"reserve battery power\" when the battery drops to about 5%.  At this point, you should as soon as possible plug in your laptop into AC power.  Or else, the computer will take its own action soon.\n\n\n\nBattery Empty (~0%)\nWhen your battery reaches \"empty\" (around 0%), the computer is forced into sleep mode in order to prevent its memory contents from being destroyed or lost.\n\n\n\n\nYour MacBook hit the \"empty\" battery level and had gone to sleep to prevent your data from being damaged.

When you plugged in and powered back on, it restored the previous session.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nMy son plugged it in and it restarted. It asked for his password to login on his account but when he validated the credentials, instead of opening his a new session for him it reconnected him to the last active session; my session on my account.\nThanks but that doesn't explain why when logged in as user 1 and it goes on sleep, when you go back and plug it, then at the user login prompt you log with user 2 but it opens user 1 session. Huge security issue to me.\nYes multiple times but not with the latest updates. My question was asked in June.\n\nReally?  That's extremely strange.  I've never seen a Macbook doing this before, and different user sessions shouldn't overlap each other.  If this is still happening, then I would like to suggest you to report this to the Apple company.  It seems like you are experiencing a huge security-related issue, so please call the Apple company about this immediately. It appears like your Mac could not tell the difference between his account and yours.  This is a massive problem, so please report this to Apple ASAP!\n\nAs more of a Windows user, I will also point out that in Microsoft Windows it functions in a similar method but what displays on the screen is slightly different. On Windows XP, for example, this is how it works:\nBattery Low (~20%): At first, the battery indicator in the taskbar becomes less filled - barely filled with its blue juice.\n\n\n\nBattery Critically Low (10%): When the battery reaches 10%, the indicator gets a red X mark and a notification is triggered, and the system urges the user to either replace the battery or connect to AC power immediately.\n\n\n\nBattery Empty (3%): On XP, when the battery reaches 3% the computer will hibernate.\n\n\n\nBut as far as I know, neither Windows nor Mac should perform the action you are describing.\n", "Q: Can't edit .plist in /System I would like to edit the following plist file using XCode, so that I can change some screensaver effects.\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Slideshows.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Content/EffectDescriptions.plist\nHowever I get a message from XCode that I don't have permission to change this file.\nSo I try to change the permissions\nsudo chmod 664 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Slideshows.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Content/EffectDescriptions.plist\nand I get this error\nchmod: Unable to change file mode on /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Slideshows.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Content/EffectDescriptions.plist: Operation not permitted\nI have given my Terminal \"Full Disk Access\" in system prefs. Now what should I try?\n\nA: /System is protected by SIP (System Integrity Protection), which prevents writes made there.\nIt can be disabled, but you might be better off seeing if you can make modifications some other way, e.g. creating a duplicate screensaver effect that is saved to /Library.\nCatalina is already doubling-down on system alterations by placing the system on a read-only volume, so any changes you make will be short-lived.\n", "Q: Output of \"${OSTYPE:6}\" on old releases of Mac OS X I'm writing a shell script that I want to be theoretically compatible with very old versions of Mac OS X (I say \"theoretically\", because I lack any super-old machines to actually test with). The script uses the output of ${OSTYPE:6} to determine which release of Mac OS X it's running on.\nOn a machine running 10.13 High Sierra, echo ${OSTYPE:6} returns 17. On a machine running 10.10 Yosemite, it returns 14. Logic thus suggests that the command would output \"15\" on 10.11 and \"16\" on 10.12.\n(This is useful, because it allows me to include lines like if [[ ${OSTYPE:6} -ge 14 ]]; then DoThing; fi to run DoThing on any system running Yosemite and newer.)\nDoes this pattern hold for old releases as well? For example, would the command return \"4\" on the original 10.0?\nI ask because, well, it would be odd to start at 4, so I'm worried that somewhere in history, the number was incremented by a point update.\n\nA: That sounds very much like it's returning the Darwin version.\nYour theory works well from 10.15 Mojave [18] back to 10.2 Jaguar [6] but fails before that, as Darwin was 1.x.x at that point.\nThere's a full list at Wikipedia - macOS\n\nA: \nOn a machine running 10.13 High Sierra, echo ${OSTYPE:6} returns 17...\n\nHere's an old PowerMac G5 running OS X 10.5 circa 2009:\n$ bash --version\nGNU bash, version 3.2.17(1)-release (powerpc-apple-darwin9.0)\n\n$ sh --version\nGNU bash, version 3.2.17(1)-release (powerpc-apple-darwin9.0)\n\n$ echo ${OSTYPE:6}\n9.0\n\n$ sw_vers\nProductName:    Mac OS X\nProductVersion: 10.5.8\nBuildVersion:   9L31a\n\n$ system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType\nSoftware:\n\n    System Software Overview:\n\n      System Version: Mac OS X 10.5.8 (9L31a)\n      Kernel Version: Darwin 9.8.0\n      Boot Volume: Macintosh HD\n      Boot Mode: Normal\n      Computer Name: PowerMac\n      User Name: Jeffrey (jwalton)\n      Time since boot: 66 days 3:46\n\n\nI've never used if [[ ${OSTYPE:6} -ge 14 ]]; then DoThing; fi.

I use it for testing open source libraries, like Crypto++ and OpenSSL.

Download Fedora 1 from /pub/archive/fedora/linux/core.\n\nA: I don't have a 10.0 machine to test on, but on 10.3 and 10.5 machines, echo ${OSTYPE:6} returns a blank line ($OSTYPE on both is darwin); on 10.6, it returns 10.0.\n(Incidentally, your shell script would need to explicitly invoke bash.  The default shell on very old versions of OSX is tcsh, which doesn't understand the ${OSTYPE:6} syntax.)\n\nA: Apple stores version information in Core Foundation and here is the source code showing how they build to each version.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://opensource.apple.com/source/DarwinTools/DarwinTools-1/sw_vers.c.auto.html\nI’d use sw_vers to get your version information if you’re scripting rather than use uname or other variables.\n", "Q: Why does iOS require passcode after reboot? Why does iOS require a passcode (not Touch ID or Face ID) after reboot? Is passcode more secure?\n\nA: Short Answer\nIt has to do with how the security subsystem in iOS works.\n\nLong Answer\nUser's biometric data is securely stored in a mathematical form in special hardware called Secure Enclave on iOS device. This data is not readable and never leaves the device. The Touch ID/Face ID subsystem do not have access to it.\nWhen the device is locked, the Data Protection keys which are held in Secure Enclave are wrapped with a key that's given to the Touch ID or Face ID subsystem inside the Secure Enclave. When an unlock is attempted, if the device detects a successful match, it provides the key for unwrapping the Data Protection keys, and the device is unlocked.\nBut, when the device restarts, the keys required for Touch ID or Face ID to unlock the device are lost; they're discarded by the Secure Enclave.\nHence the device passcode is required to authentication the user.\n\nTo get a better sense of the iOS security design, you can refer to the iOS Security Guide, which is updated by Apple after major updates to iOS. The contents in the answer are derived from iOS Security Guide for iOS 12.3 released in May 2019.\n", "Q: Command-Tab-1, what is this?

Is it an issue with Catalina or is there something else I can do to try to resolve this?\n\nA: I managed to fix it after I enabled the \"Allow guest users to connect to shared folders\" for the \"Guest User\" under the \"Users & Groups\" panel.\n\nA: First, I used the activation of NetBios, which seemed to arrange the trouble. But, in fact, that was not good. \nSo, I tried to unify Working groups of NAS (D-Link and Synology), iMac and MacBook Pro and then I put IP of my Box as WINS Server.

Apple's own CoreGraphics engine works differently from Adobe's. Of course, both contain a number of bugs! \nIt's also possible that the PDF was not created 'to spec', and different engines are more or less forgiving in how they deal with syntax errors.\nYou could try Exporting it from Preview as a PDF, which will 'rinse' the PDF data through CoreGraphics, and which might fix the problem.
