["Q: Google Chrome activating Mac webcam When I open Google Chrome app, my webcam seemingly starts recording, i.e. green light next to iSight lightens. What is happening?\nEdit: I went to System Preferences -> Sharing and saw that everything is turned off. Then I went to Activity Monitor and searched for \"camera\" saw some process which I killed then and the light turned off.\nAfter restarting Google Chrome app, camera again turns on.\n\nA: There are two most likely reasons for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*One of the installed Chrome extensions is accessing the camera. \n\n*You have tabs to websites opening automatically which access the camera\n\n\nIn both cases, a bit trial and error is required to identify the cause.\n", "Q: Can’t increase partition size of cloned volume in Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) I have a MacBook with a 120 GB SSD. I bought a new one with 240 GB. I cloned the content from the old one over with an ICY BOX cloning device. I inserted new SSD in the MacBook and everything is fine and works. But I then noticed in the disk utility that the size of the partition is still the old one (120 GB).\nSo here is what I have tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*I dragged the partition in the pie chart to use all unlocated available space. But then I get the error from MediaKit: \"Error: -5341: MediaKit reports partition (map) too small\".\n\n*I ran GParted on a USB flash drive, mounted it and gparted noticed some errors with the partition. it immediatly repaired it. Then I tried to increase the partition within GParted. But this was not possible. GParted can't increase HFS+ format. But after repairing it with GParted, disk utility does not show free space any longer.\n\n\n*I ran Terminal and diskutil resizeVolume. But it breaks up with an error message: \"Error obtaining partition map size information\"\n\nAnd now I am completely lost. What’s wrong and what can I do to reclaim the additional space?\n\nA: In general, when you use those hardware-only cloning devices—like that ICY BOX you mention—you end up in situations like this. Perhaps there is a cleaner way to recover from a situation like this, but in my experience what you are attempting to do just won’t work; hardware cloning like that is strictly one-to-one as far as volume size goes. And if the target volume size is larger than the source size, the situation that you are in happens; the volume is cloned but the maximum destination volume size becomes exactly the same as the source volume size.\nWhat I always do for cases like this—cloning smaller drive to larger drive—is to hook up the new drive to the machine in some way (such as an external USB enclosure) and then clone it via rsync or Carbon Copy Cloner. This strictly copies OS level data from one device to another; not partition data/info so this always works right off the bat.\n\nA: If you clone a disk with APFS containers to a larger disk, you'll need to repair the partition before trying to resize the container.  I found the answer posted by user @Ilya-K in this thread\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/390791/394570\nbasically, diskutil list to get a list of disks.  Find the disk you want to edit, usually disk0 in a single disk system. Then diskutil repairdisk disk0 and you'll get a warning about potential data loss, but since this is a clone, you should be safe.  If this is not a clone, backup first.  This will repair the partition map so it see the entire new disk.  Then resize the APFS container with diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk1 0 where disk1 is the APFS container shown from the diskutil list command, and 0 means use all remaining available space.\n\nA: So I recently did the exact same thing.  Copied my 250gb hdd to a new 500gb ssd and found 250gb of unallocated space.  I tried using disk utility to resize and it would resize it, but would give an error and actually end up resizing the recovery partiton instead. I finally figured out that if you reformat the unallocated space to hfs+ through a bootable usb stick of gparted and then go back to disk utility ( I did it on another mac with the new drive externally plugged in) it will then let you resize the main partition to use the full size of the disk.  Hope this helps\n\nA: I just had to say the last comment by Wes helped me. Spent ages trying to fix unallocated space. Same deal as Wes. Copied my 250GB HDD to a new 500GB SSD and found 250gb of unallocated space. Tried using disk utility as well. I tried for ages to create a gparted boot USB but failed. What worked for me is that I created a Parted Magic boot USB on Windows using Rufus. Then as Wes said formatted the unallocated space to HFS+. Booted normally and voila disk util extended fine. Thanks Wes!\n\nA: I ran into a similar problem after deleting my Linux partition on an old MacBook Pro running 10.6. I couldn’t expand the OS X partition to fill the newly empty space no matter what I tried. Disk Utility always gave the “MediaKit reports partition (map) too small” error, and GParted isn’t capable of expanding HFS+ partitions. Wes and Moff’s answers helped me too. Here is what I did:\nI booted to a GParted live USB and created a new HFS+ partition in the unallocated space (Disk Utility wouldn’t let me do it). Then I booted back into OS X and ran these commands (disk0s2 is my OS X partition, disk0s3 is the new empty partition named “Empty Partition”):\ndiskutil eject \"/Volumes/Empty Partition\"\ndiskutil mergePartitions HFS+ \"Macintosh HD\" disk0s2 disk0s3\n\nWorked fine even with me booted into the volume I was expanding.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 13 inch late 2011 flickering screen I have some problems with the screen of my laptop MacBook Pro 13inch from late 2011.

I have an early 2015 13\" MacBook Pro running OS X 10.11.2 and I'm considering enabling FileVault 2. I realize that the disk is always encrypted, even when the machine is in use and only parts of it are decrypted, but the decryption keys are stored in RAM (I believe) when the machine is on. When I close the lid and the machine goes to some sort of sleep state, is it possible for an attacker with physical access to the device to obtain the decryption key granted that they don't know my user login password? User login password is set to be required immediately after waking from sleep. I got the idea that in newer versions of OS X FileVault keys are encrypted with user login keys, but I couldn't get any confirmation on this. I want to avoid enabling destroyfvkeyonstandby if possible as fast and reliable wake-from-sleep is important to me. \n\nA: I don't believe any extra encryption is specified for the keys and also want to disagree with the statement \"only parts of it are decrypted\" as the entire volume is either unlocked or locked. For the filesystem to be mounted - all of it is unlocked.\nSo, you could enable destroyfvkeyonstandby being sure to also disable power nap since that causes restarts if the machine wakes up too many times to find that the filesystem is encrypted while it tries to run.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2014/02/12/power-nap-power-management-settings-and-filevault-2\nFor me, the risk that somehow the RAM will be captured from a sleeping Mac isn't worth the delay every wake of having to unlock the volume. My suspicions are that Apple has implemented the unlock in a way to make it highly secure whether the Mac is sleeping or not so that even if the contents of the drive are captured, you still need the proper password to unlock the volume the next time it is locked.\n\nA: The only way to keep your Mac safe while you are away is to power it down. Period. Even then, leaving your Mac unattended may not be a good idea, but at least your data is safe, just in case the Mac got stolen.\nFV2 does a great job protecting your data, but unless your Mac is powered down, there are potential ways for an attacker to compromise it and get hold of your data. Since you never know how sophisticated an attacker may be, the only way to get peace of mind is to turn it off.\nI travel a lot with a MacBook Air and always power it down when I'm not using it.\n", "Q: How can I get the audio from iOS \"Classic>Alert\" onto my computer?

Is there any way to get all of the metadata associated with a file in Terminal? By \"metadata\" I mean things metadata and properties that are not stored in nor derived from the file's contents (i.e., checksum, UTD, image resolution, etc.), but rather reside in the filesystem's data about the file (i.e., last time changed, inode, permissions, extended attributes, etc.).\n\nA: This response might be late, but hopefully it will help someone.\nThere are numerous ways to view metadata in the terminal on an Apple computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*mdls path/file.extension\n\n\n*\n\n*mdls stands for Metadata List and you can look at the man pages (man mdls) to learn how to use it.\n\n\n*xattr path/file.extension\n\n\n*\n\n*xattr stands for Extended Attributes.

My company took the Exchange ActiveSync server offline; they want me to use their email client instead of iOS mail (or the Outlook app), in the mistaken belief that this is \"more secure.\"\nI thought that when they took this offline, I would also lose connection through OS X Mac Mail (set up in system preferences), because I thought they would use the same protocols. But my phone apps went down this evening and Mac mail is still working.\nSo this makes me think there could be a backdoor? I already checked and there is no IMAP server. How does Mac Mail connect? Is there a way that I could railroad this vector to get my email back on my phone?\n\nA: You can get excruciating detail from Mac mail client as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*open mail\n\n*select the window menu -> connection doctor\n\n*tick the log connection detail\n\n*note the wall clock time and select check again\n\n*open the log folder and look over the text logs that document exactly what mail servers are being queried, what messages are exchanged between the mac and the iOS device.\n\n\nIf the Mac can still connect, either your exchange setup has a director set up to point to the correct mail server (I believe Microsoft markets that as auto discovery) or it send a reconfiguration message to the mail client to update settings. Safari will also watch for you signing into web mail and offer to set up the mail client.\nBest of luck taking those settings to iOS - you might be able to still connect after looking over the Mac connection details.\n\nA: Both IOS and OSX can connect to an Exchange server using the Exchange protocols as well as POP and IMAP though the latter two are trivial to turn off on an Exchange server. This may be what your company's email admins have done.\nIt could be that you were connecting to your exchange server via POP or IMAP. I would try deleting the account on your IOS device and re-adding it. When you are setting it up again you will notice that there is an option for setting it up as \"Exchange.\" Once you tap on that you have the option to tap on POP, IMAP or Exchange. Choose the latter. All you will need to know is your username, password, email address, Active Directory domain and mail server URL (the URL you go to for webmail, often mail.company.com or the like). If you have all of that the IOS mail.app will connect to the Exchange server using native Exchange security and email protocols.\nAs an aside I use the free MS Outlook IOS app (partly to keep mail, contacts and calendar separate from my personal stuff) and find it to be an excellent email application, well worth a try.\n", "Q: Time Machine can't find Time Capsule - but can mount it I have a 5th Gen (A1470) Time Capsule on our network.

You can use kextunload to unload a Kernel extension.

Or do I have to delete the topmost account and add it again to move it lower in the list?\nHere's more info about why I want to do this:\nI'm a new user of Outlook Mac 2016. I added two mail accounts (work and personal) and I want to keep them visually separate in Outlook. So I unchecked the \"Group similar folders, such as Inboxes, from different accounts\". But now my personal email account (that I added first to Outlook) is on top and my work account is on the bottom. \nI'd like to reverse this order because I spend more time on work email and want to keep it on top. \nIn the PC version of Outlook I can just drag one account above another. But that doesn't work on the Mac version. Is there another way to reorder the accounts in the Mac version?\nI know I can just delete and re-add my personal account, but I was hoping to avoid having to wait hours for it to sync years of email. \n\nA: Also, you can identify the account inbox (and/or other folders) as favorite, which will move them to the top. Toggle (on/off) the star to the right of the folder in the main window. Version 15.36 (170702) moves non-Exchange accounts to the bottom regardless of default account.\n\nA: I just upgraded to Outlook for Mac 2016 and have 4 accounts - and of course my new client is at the bottom.  Something really easy - go into your accounts and just add A) account name   B) Account name  C) account name.  Its a little clunky but you see a nice list with the accounts in the order you want.  Good luck!\n\nA: After the default account, all of them are arranged in alphabetical order. So instead of numbering them, add an alpha bullet (e.g.: a. First Account, b. Second Account, c. Third Account, and so on)\n\nA: I wanted to know the same thing.  I searched and couldn't find an answer.  I finally figured it out myself.  You can change the \"default\" account and it will go to the top.  Go to Tools, Account and then select the account you want to be the default.  Click the gear at the bottom and select \"Set as default.\"\nThen, the remaining accounts will be put in alphabetical order.  You may need to exit Outlook and reopen it to see the new order.\nThis works better than deleting the top account - letting the items shuffle and then adding the other accounts below since the sort order doesn't always follow the order of addition to the app. Especially if you have delegate accounts you're adding.\n\nA: I added a number to front of each account description in the Accounts dialog box (e.g., \"1. Main Email\") so they fell into the order I need.\n\nA: Hmm, none of these solutions worked for me. The only way to get the account i want on top is to make it the default. But I don't want that account to be the default.\nI have tons of folders in my main exchange account and having my .mac account at the bottom in the Sidebar won't work for me.

As a result about 58 GB in the CoreStorage LVG are not allocated to Logical Volumes.\nTo expand Macintosh HD boot to your Recovery HD (hold cmdR while booting). Open Disk Utility and verify the integrity of the superior CoreStorage LVG and the inferior LV (Macintosh HD). Then open Terminal in the menubar Utilities -> Terminal\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter diskutil cs list.\n\n*Enter diskutil cs resizeVolume lvUUID size. lvUUID is the UUID of the Logical Volume; usually it's the last listed in the output of diskutil cs list. Use 250g as size. If you get an error (not enough space...) use a slightly smaller size like 249500m.\n\n*Enter exit, quit Terminal and reboot to your main volume.\n\n", "Q: Apple mail unable to reply or close windows Whenever I try to reply (or reply all) to any email through the mail app, an empty new message window opens that I can type in but all the buttons (send, attach etc.) are greyed out and I cannot close the window without restarting the mail app. Has made the app complete unusable except for reading emails. Any ideas how to fix this? \n\nA: In my case the following approach has fixed this issue, for the time being at least:\n(Using Mail.app version 9.2)\nGo to Mail > Preferences and select the 'Composing' tab. In the section of preferences relating to 'Responding' and change the settings so that they are the opposite of what you normally use. Save the changes.\nI then quit Mail. (In my case I then restarted the machine as well - for a wholly separate and unrelated reason, but I don't know if that's a critical step or not, certainly won't do any harm.) Re-launch mail, and I found that replying to a message now conforms to the new preferences that I've set.\nI then re-edited the preferences to set them back to what I wanted. Tried a new reply, and it works - the target addresses are in place, the text of the original is there and quoted.\nI guess the issue may have been due to the original preference settings getting corrupted in some way. I'll keep it under review, and if it stops working again anytime soon, I'll aim to add a comment here.\n\nA: Sounds like that you're outgoing mail server has been changed. \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Mail Preferences\n\n*Select the account you're having problems with from the list.

Are you an iOS development? Please tell me which mac hardware is good enough for that. I am gonna use it in about 3 years or more. I am intended to buy a macbook pro 2015 with 13.3\", core i5, RAM 8GB, SSD 128GB. It's not so expensive but of course not cheap for me. I am just a student in an university right now, i haven't earned money so i want to save money as much as possible, but it should work well. That hardware is okay or can be less? I know that is an old question but i want to make sure before buying one. Thank you so so much for helping me.\n\nA: I am using a Late 2011 MacBook Pro 15\" with 4GB of memory and a 750GB hard drive (non-SSD). Xcode 7 is slower than previous versions (especially the emulator) but usable.\nBut using an SSD on a laptop with 8GB memory is more than up to the task of developing for Mac OS X or iOS.\nSome points to consider:\n1) 128GB storage is not large so you will probably need more external storage depending on what you download and store on your laptop.\n2) While 8GB memory should be fine for 3 years (at least), if the memory cannot be upgraded after purchase then consider 16GB memory if you can afford it.\nOne annoyance I find, when developing, is that you can always use more screen space. You will find yourself opening and closing a lot of panes / windows in Xcode on a 13.3\" display.\n", "Q: Mac Terminal - Rename Keeping Last 6 Characters I'm using the built in Terminal, and I am totally new to this coding so I will need to know exactly what to type when I open the Terminal. Also, please don't direct me to any other software. So lets say...\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a folder named \"Power\" on my Desktop (without the quotation marks around it of course).\n\n*In that folder there are multiple .tif files named like the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Washington,George-150987.tif\n\n*Lincoln,Abraham-755103.tif\n\n*Smith,Jack & Jill-102347.tif\n\n*Jones-Newman,Martha & John Newman-137881.tif\n\n\n*These names have one thing in common. They all have a 6 digit number before the extension, and always will.\n\n*I want a way to batch rename a large group of these files keeping just the last 6 digits.

If the output looks ok, run\n\\ls | while IFS= read f; do mv -vn \"$f\" \"${f/*-/}\"; done\n\nPS: This assumes that the only - in the file names is the one right before the number.\n\nSome explanations about what's going on here:\n\n\n*\n\n*\\ls lists all files, the \\ ensures that no alias expansion takes place. The output is fed into a pipe but we do not need to worry about multi-column output because ls in these cases automatically assumes -1\n\n*while ... do; ...; done loops over all lines/files\n\n*IFS= read f reads a file name from standard input into $f. The IFS= ensures that none of the characters on standard input confuses read into expecting two values instead of one (technically this is probably not required here, but it's good practice anyway)\n\n*${f/*-/} does string substitution on the value of $f, in this case replacing everything up to and including the - with the empty string.

While I personally never disable my login password (I never recommend doing it for several reasons) I do change some of my security settings for my local home network vs. when I’m away from home.\nFirst, you will  want to get and install ControlPlane (which I have NOT tested with El Capitan). This add-on will let you change a bunch of settings on your Mac based on the location information that it can glean from \"evidence sources”.  It also has a bunch of built in functions, is AppleScriptable, and open source.\nOnce you have ControlPlane installed you will need to create an AppleScript that will let you disable or enable password login based on the location information.\nThe AppleScript you create may be different depend on which Mac OS you are running (in your case El Capitan). But it will be similar to the script I created on OS X 10.9.5 to do what you want.\nNOTE 1: This scrip only toggles the settings found on the Security & Privacy Page, it does NOT have any understanding of the location information. You will probably want to create a version of this AppleScript for each location that ControlPlane identifies, and have it change the settings accordingly.\nNOTE 2: This script require the user to enter their administrative password twice when disabling the password login and screensaver settings. I don’t know of a way around this unless you want to drop down and do shell scripting from ControlPlane, or add your password into the AppleScript and have it type it in for you.\nI DO NOT GUARANTEE OR WARRANTY THIS SCRIPT!

For clarity, I am not interested in copyrighted / encrypted / DRM'd BD-ROM HD video material / films, just plain data accessible through Finder.\nObviously, I would have to provide myself with a Mac compatible Blu-ray writer / burner first.\nThat being said, does OS X support reading and writing data files from / to BD-Rs natively without 3rd party software? If not, is there any open-source software that would allow that?\nI'm on a MBP with Yosemite and have never used an optical drive on OS X, so I'm not familiar with that process. Online documentation on Blu-ray for Mac / OS X is pretty sparse and I can't find an authoritative source on the matter. I'd be hard-pressed to believe I'm the only one who is trying to achieve that.\nThanks!\n\nA: Reading the original post carefully, I can confirm that nothing special is needed to mount a blank Blu Ray Disk in the Finder, and then burn data to it with Mac OS X's built-in disk burning tool. I just did this yesterday with a 25GB BD-R. This worked perfectly with an external LG Bluray burner I just bought from OWC. Hope that helps.\n\nA: No need for additional software, just plug in a USB Blu-Ray writer and burn files to it just as if it is any other storage medium.\nHere's an article from MacWorld that confirms the above.\n\nA: OP, Mac OSX does indeed support BD-R as others have already said, assuming you have a compatible DVD player. Yet, while  one of my macs  mounts the volumes automatically in Finder, another one won't.  Instead, I must run Disk Utility and manually mount the volume. After that, everything works as normal.

I was able to save the hard drive and am wondering if it is possible to retrieve the photos that were on it. I don't care about anything else that is on it.\n\nA: Unless the hard drive was damaged, you should still be able to get your things off. You'll need:\n\n\n*\n\n*A set of adapter cables (similar to the USB enclosure @crasic recommends), which will run you ~$10 on Amazon or hopefully similar at CompUSA or Fryes or whatever. The advantage of the cables over the enclosure is that the cables are cheaper, and you don't need the permanence the enclosure provides.\n\n*Another Mac, preferably, or a Windows PC running something like Paragon.\n\n\nOnce you have these, plug the SATA-to-USB cable into the appropriate slots, then do the power. Try not to move the disk while it's in use, as this could damage the moving parts. Get what you need, and MAKE SURE TO EJECT THE DISK before unplugging it.\n(Despite the ominous warning, it is reasonably hard to mess up a good drive unless you're super careless. Don't worry too hard, just don't do anything stupid.)\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2008 stuck in OS X Mavericks installation I want to make a clean OS X Mavericks install on a MacBook Pro 2008 (A1278).

Therefore I got an bootable install image from the web (whick seems to be clean and official). When preparing the intallation it stucks for hours with \"one second left\" (until reboot) and the throws an error message \"during preparation of the installation an error occured\" (roughly translated). The same problem occured with 3 other bootable install images (all looking clean, from different internet sources). Here is the last installation log.\nCan someone help me?\n\nA: The installer fails to bless the system folder (EG make the drive bootable). This could be an issue with boot sectors or other parts of the disk having a problem of some sort.\nThorbjørn's idea for formatting the HD might indeed work as that will rewrite parts of the disk structure and (hopefully) the part that is failing. Zapping PRAM (COMMANDOPTIONPR at startup) might also help.\nFailing that you may have a disk error that is beyond the capability of Apple's Disk Utility to fix. Diskwarrior or other disk repair tool might be something to try next.\n\nA: If your laptop is from 2008 it might be an idea to give it a new HDD altogether. It's been reading/writing since 2008 so it may be time to lay it to rest. Which MacBook Pro do you have specifically? A Late 2008 is the 4,1 model.\nAn SSD would give it a massive breath of life, and should get several more years of good use out of it, even if the rest of the hardware is getting on a bit.\n", "Q: How do you remove a hyperlink from a cell in Numbers '08 version 1.0.3?

I would like to know if an app made for iPad only will work on the iPad Pro?\nAlso, will the app be properly scaled?\nIs it possible for an app made for iPad pro to work on an regular iPad?\nIf yes will it be properly scaled? \n\nA: That depends on how the app was made.\nApps are meant to define the position of interface components in terms of their distance from the edges of the screen by using a technology called AutoLayout (included in Xcode, the development environment for Apple devices).\nIf the app was made with AutoLayout then yes, it will scale.\nAs for whether or not they will work, iPhone and iPod apps can already be used on iPad so there should be no reason for which iPad apps shouldn't work on the Pro.\nHowever, when the interface contains a lot of stuff and the interface was designed for a bigger screen, the components could get squashed together. If particular technologies are required (e.g. Apple Pencil) they won't work on the regular iPads.\n", "Q: File not visible in Finder I've saved a file with the name filename\\.svg and it didn't appear in finder. When I check terminal, there was a file named .svg in the folder I saved my file. I changed its name to test.svg but it still doesn't appear in Finder. Here is a screenshot from terminal: \n\nHow can I make this file visible in Finder?\n\nA: From this tutorial on MacWorld, here is a way to show hidden files in the Finder:\nOpen a terminal, and enter this command at the Bash prompt:\n$ defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES\n\nThen restart the Finder with the following command (also from terminal):\n$ killall Finder\n\nThe next time you open a Finder window, your hidden files should be visible.\nTo echo what Oliver said, you can also use chflags to alter the \"hidden\" property on a specific file. (chflags man page)\nchflags nohidden hiddenfile.ext\n\n\nA: In order to make only this specific file visible in Finder, try the following command using Terminal.app from Applications > Utilities:\n$ cd /path-to-folder/where/invisible-file/is-located/\n$ chflags nohidden ./test.svg\n\nHope this helps\n\nA: I think it is a bug in Finder.

For me this is ~/MultiTimer here. But for the Alias, the Terminal use of cd does not work!\n\nQuestion\nHow do you use cd from the Terminal for an Alias? Can this be setup?\n\nA: Aliases are special files for OS X and currently only supported by GUI apps.\nThey contain information about the target object wich allows the finder to find the original location even if the target has been moved across filesystems. \nThere is some C source to build a tool that gets the target name out of an alias file (Link to source code), but I think to use it in the way you would like (cd) this is not that practical. Ex:\ncd `./getTrueName Multitimer`\n\nAs mentioned in the first answer, ln is the right tool to use if you don't need the advanced Alias features:\nln -s <sourcepath> <targetpath> does not allow for target movement.\nln <sourcepath> <targetpath> allows for target movement, but only on the same file system.\n\nA: the answer is simple - use 'ln -s' and not an Alias!\n\nA: To use file type \"alias\" in CLI directly, you should modify the function \"cd\" in shell. \nFor example (bash), This tip can be helpful. \n", "Q: Cannot get emails I have an iPhone 6.

Not rich enough to buy a macbook with 16GB RAM.\n\nA: Swap is issued only when needed. There is no limit so if you have a memory leak, that will crash a program or allocate swap to grow as needed.\nUsually the kernel detects and protects you, but worst case, reboot and swap is cleaned each restart.\nHow are you measuring things to conclude “swap memory is fullest”? It starts empty and grows as you use the system and then cleans each reboot.

I was wondering if there is literally any way around this. Maybe my own program that keeps the proxy disabled, counterproductive to the proxy enabler.\nIf I am being confusing, let me explain what I go through:\n\n\n*\n\n*I go to do something (play a game, download an app, etc.)\n\n*It is not working.\n\n*I click on the apple logo, then choose: \"System Preferences...\" -> \"Network\" -> \"Advanced\" -> \"Proxies\"\n\n*I notice \"Automatic Proxy Configuration\" is enabled, with an address (to a .pac proxy I guess) put in.\n\n*I simply uncheck \"Automatic Proxy Configuration\".\n\n*I click OK, and \"Apply\".\n\n*I am able to access the software now.

It was going fine and suddenly stopped, and I hadn't updated recently. I ran the WirelessDiagnostic tool after doing a bit of searching, and that made the internet shareable again. It's an app--not a setting; I mention this because I wasted a lot of time trying to find it in System Preferences. \n\nA: Turn Off firewall, so far it's the only way that you can share the connection. I don't like this idea of turning off the firewall but sharing just doesn't work when firewall is set to On. Apple should give a fix on this without turning Off the firewall and still able to share the connection. \n\nA: I am having the same problem and have fought with it. A device will connect to the wireless network created by El Capitan, BUT never get an Ip Address.\nBeen googling and think it has something to do with bootpd  (The daemon that acts as a DHCP server) not working properly.  BUT with the changes in El Capitan, I am not even sure if this is how it works anymore, and presently cannot find documentation on the technical specifics of how internet connection sharing works on el capitan. \nEx: Does it use bootpd and do we need to manually configure it with a proper Ip range? Does it use something else? ETC.  \nOnly just discovered the bootpd thing, so do not have more info for you here as I continue to troubleshoot. But hopefully this will get you somewhere.  See who is the first one to the finish line.\n\nA: bootpd.plist IS the problem.  I just upgraded my mini from Snow Leopard to El Capitan (skipping all versions in-between) and found that internet sharing was no longer working.  After reading about the problem on this thread I looked at my /etc/bootpd.plist file and compared it with one on a functioning El Cap machine (my laptop).  They were different.  First thing I noticed was that the working one says that it was _created by com.apple.NetworkSharing.  The one on my mini says it was _created by com.apple.nat.  So, I copied the booted.plist file from my laptop to my desktop mini and it started working.  Sort of.  I could now connect and surf via that shared connection, but Home Sharing isn't working.  Also, as soon as I turn off Internet Sharing and then turn it back on I end up with the non-functional booted.plist file again.  I don't know where to look for the config file that generates that booted.plist file, but I suspect it is chaff left over from the Snow Leopard install.

After I export my GarageBand song and convert it to an mp3 and play it in iTunes, the background static noise is much louder than in Garageband. \nOS X El Captain 10.11.2 . Garageband 10.1.0\nI want it to sound the same as it does in GarageBand. \nHow can I convert tracks into an mp3 while reducing static noise in the file when played on iTunes? \n\nA: I suspect this is not a file compression issue but rather an audio compression issue. By default, GarageBand has \"Auto Normalize\" turned on (Preferences > Advanced). This reduces the volume difference between the softest and loudest sounds in the mix on export, so that the playback of the finished audio is louder. The problem is, when you've got quiet background noise in your source files, normalizing will make it louder. Try turning off \"Auto Normalize\" and exporting again. The file format shouldn't matter.\nOf course, the Jedi master-level fix for this problem would be to get a better recording (or better recording equipment) and to EQ/filter out the noise while mixing!\n\nA: I chatted with Apple and they suggested downloading Audacity and using Effects to reduce the static noise. I have done this and it is much better now. If anyone else has the same problem use the 'Notch Filter' first, then 'Noise Reduction' - Noise Reduction: 6, Sensitivity: 1, Frequency Smoothing: 0. You can try different settings but these worked for me.\n\nA: In GarageBand change the master volume of the whole song not just the individual instrument volume, I have had the same problem as you before and it works.\n", "Q: revoke ipad access to my wireless network My elderly neighbor needed help with iPad.

Is there anyway that I can remove her ipad access, by removing it from my Mac?  Where do I find the list of those devices that have access to my wireless network?\nThanks!\n\nA: The simplest solution would be to change the network password.  This can be done from the Airport Utility application found in your Applications > Utilities folder.\nThis will disconnect all devices, so it would require entering the new password in your devices including your connected printer.\nAirport Utility also will show you devices connected to your network.

I performed a 'fsck_hfs /dev/diskXsX' and it went through fixing the drive a couple times and everything started being listed again.  Hopefully someone else can use this info.  It had nothing to do with the drobo and just the fact that filesystem was messed up.  \n", "Q: Are there any current Macs capable of running NVIDIA based CUDA SDK?

Because I do not have an Apple device, the calendar app is unavailable to me on icloud.com; only pages, numbers and keynote are available. Would downloading iCloud for Windows via Wine give me iCal, or is there another solution?\nMany thanks in advance!\n\nA: Unfortunately you can't add iCloud Calendar support to an Apple ID without turning it on via an iOS or Mac device.\nYou can borrow someone's Apple device and turn it on for the Apple ID in Settings > iCloud, on an iOS device or System Preferences > iCloud, on a Mac.\nOnce you have turned on \"Calendars\" for the device, you can immediately disable it and sign out of your boss' Apple ID, and your boss should be able to access iCloud Calendar from www.icloud.com.\n", "Q: Disable notification center on lock screen (or prevent it from clearing notifications) One of the must utterly infuriating problems I have on recent iOS versions is the fact that swiping down from the top of the screen while the phone is locked will bring down the notification center and clear all of my lock screen notifications.\nThis happens all. the. time. I usually keep my phone in my pocket, and if I get a message or feel it vibrate, I will reach into my pocket and with my thumb and forefinger pull it out. Perhaps 50% of the time when I do this, my thumb ends up pulling the notification center down when I pull my phone out.\nThis alone isn't a big deal, I can just swipe it up again. The problem is that when the notification center comes down, for some god-knows-why reason, it clears the notifications that were just on the screen, meaning I'm now prevented from doing precisely what I pulled the phone out of my pocket for in the first place.\nThere has got to be a way to fix this horrible UX.\n\nA: Naturally, I ended up solving this shortly after I posted the question.

As the TV only has HDMI 2.0 ports, I am considering to buy a thunderbolt to HDMI 2.0 adapter. but I want to know that whether this combination will give me the 60Hz refresh rate at 4k resolution.\n\nA: No, while the LG 40UB800T TV claims that it can run at up to 100Hz as a TV. It does so through internal interpolation which adds latency and is unsuitable as a computer display.\nWhen you run this LG TV as a computer monitor you will only be able to get 30Hz out of it at full UHD (3840x2160) resolution across an HDMI cable. To drive the LG display at UHD@60Hz you need HDMI2.0 with HDCP2.2 support.\nApple does NOT support the HDMI2.0 or HDCP2.2 standard at this time. As of late 2015 the HDMI connector from ANY Mac will only drive a UHD display at 30Hz max according to Apple.

How can I fix this?\n\nA: I would recommend looking at using a utility like CleanMyMac 3 to go through and perform some system maintenance and free up extra disk space. The first time I ran it on my system I freed up about 20GB of hard drive space by getting rid of language packs that weren’t needed by my system.

I've got an iPhone 6 running the latest iOS 9.2.1 public beta, although the following behavior has been happening to me for a few iOS updates now. I'm wondering if it's a beta bug that should be reported or if it's the intended iOS behavior.\n\nWhen I'm using headphones, everything works the way it should, regardless of the ringer switch setting.\nWhen I'm not using headphones and the ringer switch is set to on (i.e. the orange isn't visible), everything works the way it should.\nWhen I'm not using headphones and the ringer switch is set to off, audio from video-playing apps (YouTube, the native Videos app, etc.) works fine, but the audio from games is totally silent.\n\nSo, is this a bug or a feature? Let's define \"feature\" as \"it can be reproduced on a device that has never touched beta software.\"\n\nA: This is intended behaviour as per Apple Guidelines.\nFrom the Apple iOS Human Interface Guidelines:\n\nUsers switch their devices to silent when they want to:\n\n*\n\n*Avoid being interrupted by unexpected sounds, such as phone ringtones and incoming message sounds\n\n*Avoid hearing sounds that are the byproducts of user actions, such as keyboard or other feedback sounds, incidental sounds, or app startup sounds\n\n*Avoid hearing game sounds that are not essential to using the game, such as sound effects and soundtracks\n\nSpecifically for games:\n\nScenario 3: A game that allows users to guide a character through different tasks. You provide:\n\n*\n\n*Various gameplay sound effects\n\n*A musical soundtrack\n\nIn this app, sound greatly enhances the user experience, but isn’t essential to the main task. Also, users are likely to appreciate being able to play the game silently or while listening to songs in their music library instead of to the game soundtrack.\n\nDeeper in the Audio Guidelines per App Type, Apple recommends use of the AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient or AVAudioSessionCategorySoloAmbient categories, which are defined as:\n\n\n*\n\n*AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient/AVAudioSessionCategorySoloAmbient\n[...]\nYour audio is silenced by screen locking and by the Silent switch (called the Ring/Silent switch on iPhone).\n\n\nAccordingly, for playback type apps, the recommended category is AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback, defined as such:\n\n\n*\n\n*AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback\n[...]\nThe category for playing recorded music or other sounds that are central to the successful use of your app.\nWhen using this category, your app audio continues with the Silent switch set to silent or when the screen locks.\n\n\nAs long as the developers follow the guidelines, this is the expected behaviour unless Apple decides to change how the categories function in the operating system.\n", "Q: Name of Home directory of previous owner of MacBook Pro I purchased this MacBook Pro with Snow Leopard which I upgrade to El Capitan.

I'm using Office 2011 on a MacbookPro.\nHow do I change the font color for each slide in my powerpoint presentation?  I inherited a presentation that has been edited by multiple people, each using different fonts, colors, backgrounds, etc.\nWhat I'm trying to do is unify the presentation so that it looks nice by using one background, one font, etc.  However, I'm having a lot of trouble getting the title color to be uniform and I don't know if it's because I'm incompetent or the previous users did something advanced that is preventing me from doing so.\nThis is what I've done thus far:\nI read on the internet about using something called a Slide Master in Powerpoint.  I tried using it to change the background for all slides (worked for me), changing all fonts to be Arial (works), and changing all fonts to be black (didn't work.  Header is still whatever the original color was).\nIn the Slide Master View, I highlighted the header of the slide.  I changed the font size to be 8 and to have strikethough in the title.  When I look at the ppt file, all titles are font size 8 and have strikethrough.  When I go back to Master View, I change the font size to 44 and remove strikethrough and all titles reflect this change.  However, when I change the color to be blue, the titles do not reflect this change.\nI can go to each slide to manually change the title color, which does work, but that's very, very cumbersome, especially when Slide Master seems to be able to change other things for all slides in the presentation.\nDoes anyone know why this is or what I must do to fix this?  Is this a bug with Office 2011 on Mac and the workaround is to find a Windows machine to change this?  Am I incompetent and will be shamed for asking an obvious question?\n\nA: It sounds like the other people who worked on the presentation did not use a template to begin with, or deleted the slide title text, and used a standard text field instead.\nHere’s a slide that looks like it has a Title box, a text field, and bullet text field. But that’s not the case.\n\nTo see if the slide theme and type are correctly applied for the slide.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Layout menu from the Home tab.\n\n*Verify the slide type and theme being used\n\n*Reset the layout to default settings.\n\nIf the slide changes after doing this (as my example below has) but the text that you thought was the title text box doesn’t change, then the person who created the slide didn’t use the proper format to begin with. You will have to manually change the text of the title field, and delete their fake title box. The Master Slide can only change the fields that are part of the original template. Text fields added outside the master slide template or after the initial slide type was selected will only receive base text formatting for the presentation.\n\n", "Q: El Capitan Safari can't open http://localhost/ after starting Apache In the Terminal window, I started the web server with sudo apachect1 start, supplied the password and then got:\n\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist: service already loaded\n\nThen, in the Safari Smart Search field I entered:\n\nhttp://localhost/\n\nThen I got:\n\nIn Terminal https -v is reported:\n\nServer version: Apache/2.4.16 (Unix)\n  Server built:   Jul 31 2015 15:53:26\n\nHow can we fix this please?

I just switched from Linux to OS X and I am still getting used to it.\nI know I'll need to use Homebrew, as I rely on many CLI tools. Also, I just read about Cask, what make me wonder about one thing. How does software (not from the App Store) get updates? Windows-like, i.e. a message notifying about a new version so I can download it, or somehow integrated with the system, so that I don't need to download a new .dmg every time I want to update an app?\nIf it's \"Windows-like\", is it better to use Cask for things like Firefox, VirtualBox, VLC, LibreOffice...?\n\nA: *\n\n*With cask, upgrading all of your installed applications (that installed with cask) is done with a single command:\nbrew cask update\n\nThis is an unofficial (community based) way to upgrade applications and only has free softwares on its repository (there is no way to purchase). Advantages of this mechanism are:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's scriptable\n\n*It separates system applications from user applications (your installed applications are placed in ~/Applications/ instead of /Applications/) so it's per user.\n\n*Installation of packaged installers is in the background so it doesn't need user interactions.\n\n*Uninstallation of applications is programmed by its community so there is no worry about remaining files after uninstallation.\n\n*It's possible to have multiple versions of applications systematically because the mechanism uses symbolic links for the latest or selected version of applications.\n\n*The source of applications is kept in the cache so you can install and uninstall them without additional downloads.\n\n\nDisadvantages of this mechanism are:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no differential upgrade. It downloads the whole application image (.dmg) or package (.pkg) and stores in the cache.\n\n*Installation of applications is relied on symbolic links that may be not ideal (There are two copies of an application and may be repeated in \"Open with\" list)\n\n\n*There is also official App Store mechanism (the default) for upgrading applications that are installed with itself and it supports differential upgrade and can upgrade all of it's installed application with a single click; but unlike Cask it's not scriptable to run upgrade, installation, etc and does not keep the sources.\n\n*Another mechanism is in-app upgrade check that occurs when application starts. It is different from App Store upgrade and also supports differential upgrade.\n\n\nI think it's up to you to choose which mechanism to use for which kind of applications, this comparison may help you.\nI use the Cask for applications that is not provided in the App Store (like VLC, OS X FUSE, OwnCloud, Weka, etc.) and App Store for non-free applications i purchased. In-app upgrades are not suitable for me because it does not keep the source of downloaded data.\n\nA: There isn't a general accepted \"best\" way for non Apple delivered, non Mac App store apps to update. There are many ways, some use linux tools, others reinvent certain wheels, others are scripting rsync/curl in a similar vein to how homebrew is built on a core script and ruby package recipes.\nAs far as apps self-updating (or at least notifying end users when an update might be available), some use a framework like sparkle to check for updates or program their own update check mechanism. Microsoft Office, Chrome, Firefox and many other apps don't need any other update mechanism other than opting in to the self-update mechanism.\nHomebrew casks probably update as well as the core homebrew experience does for command line tools so I would start with that and then ask a follow on question if/when you have a specific app in mind that's not updating to your desires.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://caskroom.io\n\n*http://brew.sh\nIf you manage Macs professionally, there are many frameworks to image, update, and even run your own \"app store\" to package specific versions of apps and side-step Apple's process.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.johnkitzmiller.com/blog/better-software-updates/\n\n*http://www.lindegroup.com/autopkgr and https://github.com/lindegroup/autopkgr\n\n*https://www.munki.org and https://www.munki.org/munki-pkg/\n\n*https://github.com/unixorn/luggage\n", "Q: How do I rename an Apple Music station When I create a new radio station in Apple Music by selecting an existing song and then choosing \"Create Station\" from the right-click menu, it creates the station and gives it the name of the song I selected with the word \"Radio\" appended.

I even miss the dock sometimes.\nCan I have swiping and the menu bar at the same time?\nNote that I have OS X 10.10.1.\n\nA: Try placing applications in \"maximized mode\" in their own seperate desktop. Do this by OPT+Clicking the green button to make the window maximized (or resize the window), then drag the window, pushing it against the top of the screen. This will trigger Mission Control. Still holding the window, drag it to the \"new desktop\" icon in the upper-right corner to place the window in it's own desktop.\nScreen recording of this: https://youtu.be/8QI-UkKmMPw\nIt may be slow to set up, but you'll still be able to use the two-finger swipe to move between applications, while still having the menu bar and dock.\nTo close desktops (which moves windows from that desktop into the next available desktop), enter Mission Control (F3), move the cursor to the top of the window, and hover your cursor over the desktop. A close icon should appear in the upper-left corner of the icon.\nHopefully this will be helpful.\n", "Q: How much does Apple charge the developer to include in-app purchases? I'm developing an App Store app which will be free to download, but there will be certain in-app purchases. \nHow much does Apple charge a developer for in-app purchases, if applicable?\n\nA: 30% for the in-app purchases, $99/year developer license.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/\nhttps://developer.apple.com/programs/\n\nA: Sadly, it depends. Did you look over the terms and conditions of tunes-connect and the marketing agreements? The fees depend on whether you are selling content through the app or the sales happen outside the app and the user signs in with an account already paid.\nTake \"Netflix\" or \"Major League Baseball season pass\" for example. If you buy a subscription in the app (whether it's on iOS or Apple TV) - Apple takes their standard cut if they handle the billing and fulfillment. If a user has purchased a subscription, Apple takes no cut when the user logs in with an account and uses the app.\n", "Q: Googleapis outgoing connection I have little snitch installed on my mac. Recently I am getting an alert about an outgoing connection to gcs-eu-00001.content-storage-upload.googleapis.com. The IP address seems to belong to google. Is it safe for me to let it connect or should I deny it? By the way, I am using Firefox browser?\n\nA: Some iCloud services, including iCloud Photos, appear to use these Google Cloud Storage hosts (and apparently some AWS ones as well) to augment Apple’s own server inventory:\n\n*\n\n*gcs-*.content-storage-upload.googleapis.com\n\n*gcs-*.content-storage-download.googleapis.com\n\n*This would likely be in an attempt to rapidly scale capacity and/or to decrease latency.\n\nIf those domains are blocked, iCloud photos should (eventually) realize that fact and fall back to AWS, Akamai, or Apple hostnames.\nIf your device is not signed into iCloud (or Google, of course), further investigation would be warranted.\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7341139?answerId=29330065022#29330065022\n\n*https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/icloud-using-googleapis-for-download-upload.2277244/\n\n*https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/644sp5/iphone_hitting_upload_bandwidth_when_plugged_in/\n\n*(also, see comments on the question above)\n", "Q: Macbook choses 169.254.x.x when the range is really 192.168.2.x We have a router/modem 2wire (with DHCP disabled) which we are just using as a modem now, wired to our Airport (with DHCP enabled). We have 5 other devices connected. One of the Macbooks is choosing an address in the 169.254.x.x range. The Airport is set to connect using DHCP and router mode: Off (bridge mode).\nThe Network utility says: Wi-Fi has the self-assigned IP address 169.254.104.148 and will not be able to connect to the Internet.\nIn the AirPort utility it says the IP address and LAN IP address of the airport is 169.254.213.128.\nThe wifi attempts to connect but never stops trying. The wifi bars just keep lighting up. In the network utility, it says \"Self-Assigned IP\"\n\nA: The problem was I didn't have DCHP enabled on the Airport, but when I did, the internet wouldn't work at all on all devices, when with it disabled, it worked on some.\nSo I contacted both my ISP (Bell/2Wire) and Apple. I had to setup the Airport to use PPPoE and I received that information over a call with my ISP.\nThe quickest route was to just reset both, call my ISP for PPPoE and reconfigure both.\n", "Q: How to seek to very old text messages I have a conversation that likely has tens of thousands of messages sent over the past year. I want to find texts 6 months ago in August. How can I go about getting back to August and scrolling through those messages? I have the conversation on both on my iPhone and my Messages on my Macbook.\n\nA: For me, the easiest way I've found to search my messages, some of which go back years, is to use and continue to use iExplorer to export my Messages to various formats.  I usually do PDF and TXT exports, either of which are then easily searched.\nI make use of others features too and for me it was worth the cost, as it's not freeware.\n\nA: I ended up getting the SQLite Browser and opening the ~/Library/Messages/chat.db file then searching and navigating through the texts there.\n\nA: I needed to print an entire message history for legal purposes. After a long search I've found iMazing and it's working very well for me. \nLink to iMazing here. \nI am not affiliated with the company.\n\nA: I found 2 ways of doing that. Depending on your needs and preferences, you choose what you want.\n1. The flexible way\nOpen the Terminal.app\nAnd enter the following command:\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Messages/chat.db\n\nNow you are in the database of the Messages app of your mac.\nEnter the following commands (but don't include the sqlite> as this one was added to this answer just to show you what you will expect at this point):\nsqlite> .mode column\nsqlite> .headers on\nsqlite> SELECT text, datetime(date, 'unixepoch', '+31 year') AS cDate FROM message WHERE cDate >= \"2016-01-12\";\n\nReplace this \"2016-01-12\" with the date you want to filter your messages, but keep the \"\"!\nIf you know the exact date of the message you can replace the >= with = like this:\nsqlite> SELECT text, datetime(date, 'unixepoch', '+31 year') AS cDate FROM message WHERE cDate = \"2016-01-12\";\n\nOr if you know a range of dates then you can also do this:\nsqlite> SELECT text, datetime(date, 'unixepoch', '+31 year') AS cDate FROM message WHERE cDate >= \"2015-12-10\" and cDate <= \"2016-01-12\";\n\nYou should get your messages now filtered!\nThis way you can actually filter your messages in more flexible way. If you play around with the database schema, you may find a good way to filter your messages.\n2. The easy way\nIf you want something more user-friendly then I found out that if you type this command in the Terminal.app:\nopen ~/Library/Messages/Archive/\n\nWill open a folder in finder that has your messages grouped by date, which will make your life much easier, looking for your message. This has been mentioned by another user as well.\nThe advantage of this method, is that the messages are opened in a nice User Interface (i.e Messages) which is more readable and user-friendly.\n\nA: You may try going to .../Library/Messages/Archive and look for the specific date/phone number. It should allow you to pull up the conversation. \nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to change Mac Mini from a mirrored RAID set to one drive? Just recently the Mac Mini I use for development/as a server had crashed. The most information I could get from it was that one of the drives in the mirrored RAID pair had crashed. Is there any way that I can solve this problem by removing a drive from one side of the pair?\n\nA: Since it's a mirrored RAID, you should be able to still power it on with only one functional hard disk. To fix this problem, replace the crashed hard drive with a new one and rebuild the RAID mirror in the Disk Utility application. \n", "Q: How do I automatically save messages on my Mac, even after deleting the conversation I tend to delete my conversations from Messages to keep it neat, but some messages I don't actually want to be gone forever. How can I have my messages save somewhere in a folder automatically even after I delete them from the Messages app?\n\nA: It's 'all or nothing' you can't be selective about which to save [unless you juggle this parameter before each time you close a conversation, which might work] but in Messages prefs, check \"Save history when conversations are closed\"\n\n\nA: All messages are saved in ~/Library/Messages so you can create a backup by simply using a cronjob to cp them over to your archive folder.\n", "Q: Charge iPad 1 without wall charger I have only the USB cable so can I charge it with my laptop or computer or any other way?\n\nA: You might get a small trickle-charge by connecting to a Windows laptop, better if you don't run the iPad whilst doing so, but only a Mac is capable of recognising & supplying the higher power requirement of an iPad.\nConnected to any standard USB port on a PC, the device will claim it is not charging - though in practise it will eventually manage to charge it, it will be very slow.\nYour best bet, if you don't own a Mac, is to buy a dedicated iPad charger.\n\nA: Yes, plug it in your laptop/desktop and it will automatically charge your ipad. \n\nA: No, Most laptop usb ports will not have sufficient power to charge a full sized ipad. You will need a high-power usb port. However you should be able to charge from a desktop computer but it will take longer.\n", "Q: Can a 2015 Macbook Air MagSafe 2 connector be filed down to work with a 2009 Macbook Pro? The title pretty much says it all. I ordered a MagSafe 2 power adapter before realizing my MacBook Pro uses the Original MagSafe. After looking at both connectors, it appears the MagSafe 2 connector would fit the MagSafe power port if it were filed down on the edges a bit. However, I'm concerned the power delivery would not match what the computer can handle, and I don't really want to go through returning and buying a new power adapter. Likewise, I wouldn't want to destroy both the adapter and the computer at one go. Does anyone know the specs – whether these two are \"electrically compatible?\"\n\nA: I'm pretty much sure there is some difference between MagSafe and MagSafe2 plugs.  Another page for overview is right power adapter and cord\nfrom Apple. \nOn other hand Apple has made it clear that an adapter with the same or higher wattage than originally provided may be used without problems. So should you have a chance to apply your MagSafe2 plug for your MagSafe notebook - imho that would work\n\nA: There are differences between the 2 (apart from size). The Magsafe 2 supplies a different voltage. The centre pin on the Magsafe 2 is a different size. It is possible the Mac may work with a different voltage (Apple does sell adapters), but using an older Mac with the new supply seems risky.\n\nA: I just filed down my new Apple MagSafe power cord on each end and it totally works with my 2012 15\" MacBook Pro.. Just found out the edges and I did a few passes over the top were the pins are and pow! It totally works \n", "Q: iCloud Drive Bird Service always running I am having a problem with iCloud Drive.

Thanks for any suggestions.\n\nA: I got rid of the problem by removing the folder that contained the file over the terminal. Seems like there was something mixed up.\nThis is how I did it:\n\n*\n\n*Identify the source of the problem using this command:\nbrctl log -w --shorten\n\n\n*I looked into it and saw there was one error always repeating and it always tried to upload it.\n\n\n*Because I couldn't find the file via the terminal (because it was never on my disk) I deleted the folder that should have contained the file. It did that using the command\nsudo rm -rf name_of_the_folder\nI hope that helps someone.\n\nA: If you are not using iCloud at all, you can disable the service.\nlaunchctl remove com.apple.bird\n\n\nA: I just spent a lot of time with different guys and girls from the APple Care about that subject, and it turns out that I wanted to upload an ubuntu-16.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso file, and as soon as I threw it away and didn't upload it on iCloud, bird went alright. The guy I had told me that I shouldn't try to upload any OS on iCloud, and it's written on the User's conditions... He told me that only simple and typical files (pictures, videos, .number or .xlsx, .pages, .psd, .zip) should be updated.\n\nA: If youve tried everything and doesnt work do it:\njust navigate to \n\n~/Library/Application Support/\n\nand execute \n\nrm -rf CloudDocs <<<<<<<<< USE AT YOUR OWN RISK\n\n\nA: I lowered bird from about 90% to 0.0% doing this:\n\n*\n\n*Look in iCloud Drive in Finder in column view.\n\n*Command-shift-period to toggle on hidden files\n\n*Look for cloud icons (with or without an arrow) to the right of file names. These seem to indicate items being cloud synced.\n\n*Drill down within the folder(s) with the cloud icon until you get to specific files being synced. (I found two PDFs)\n\n*Copy the files somewhere outside iCloud (I did this on an iOS device but you could probably just use Finder. Removing from iCloud by dragging and saying OK to the \"Remove from iCloud?\" dialog might work instead of deleting, I can't say).\n\n*Use Finder to delete the offending files that are in iCloud Drive (unless you removed from iCloud per my note in step 5).\n\n*Empty the Trash (note this is emptying your local Mac trash as well as in iCloud).\n\nIf you run brctl log -w --shorten before and after doing this, you should see a difference in logging. You should see lower %CPU for bird in Activity Monitor afterward.\nAfter emptying trash, a hidden \".Trash\" folder (see step 2) at the top level of iCloud Drive continued to show the cloud icon. After about 5 minutes, the cloud icon disappeared and bird went from about 9% to 0%.\nCaveats: Try not to delete files you want to keep!\n", "Q: Grey folder in iCloud Drive I have a grey folder on my Mac in the iCloud Drive Directory which I can't access. \nIf I go to the iCloud Drive Website I see the folder and can easily navigate in it.\nDoes anyone know a solution on how to enable this folder on my machine as well?\n\nA: So I fixed it by using the terminal. I moved all the content of the grayed out folder and to a new one.\n//edit: a more detailed description on how I solved this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*with the help of the terminal I moved all the files in the strange behaving folder to a new location. Using the mv command. E.g. cp ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/YOUR_BROKEN_FOLDER/* ~/Documents (the * is for all the files).\n\n*Once this folder it empty you can safely remove it with the rm -f command. E.g. rm -rf ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/YOUR_BROKEN_FOLDER\n\n*If you want you can now recreate the folder normal in the finder and it should appear normal again.\n\n\nA: Another easier way that I found is to just copy the shaded folder and paste it somewhere else and then move it back where it was original and it overwrites the shaded folder making it accessible again.\n", "Q: What iTunes menu bar? When I open iTunes I don't see anything that says \"file\" so I can't select \"transfer\" in order to transfer files from my devices (iPhone or iPad) to my iTunes library, which should be done before I can update the devices.  When I open iTunes the play, rewind, and fast forward arrows are on top.  under that I see the music, movies, and tv icons, followed by my device icon and a battery life indicator.

You can turn on and keep it temporarily or permanently.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202662\n", "Q: How to fix iPhone; where user is unable to hear from front speaker. New phone with plastic still on So I recently had this issue and had the hardest time figuring it out when, in fact, it was quite an easy solution. I got a brand new iPhone due to the last one breaking. It is an iPhone 6s. I kept the plastic on it because I was waiting for my screen protector to come. Throughout the next few week's usage I had noticed that I can't hear people when on a phone call. I tried a ton to fix it and finally decided to book a genius bar reservation and had them explain that while the plastic seems thin, and while the plastic seemingly does not block sound, it in fact does block sound.\n\nA: Take the plastic off when you get a new iPhone. That plastic will ruin the phone calling experience\n", "Q: Safari can't verify the identity of the website errors Well, I did a bit of searching before I decided to post here. I've been getting this message for the past month whenever I visit one of two sites. Both sites are professional companies that sell products in the audio community, but only two website are flagging these errors. \n\nThe issue spans across all browsers (Safari, Chrome, and Firefox), each of these three throw the error that's similar.  I've already rechecked the automatic date/time update in date and time preferences and I've already used the keychain repair. Both of those were some of the top rated fixes, but neither fixed it for me. I've read that sometimes deleting certain certificates in keychain can fix the issue, but I'm not too savvy with the inner workings of the web and wasn't entirely sure what I was supposed to be doing. \nCan anyone suggest any other ways to fix the issue?

You may either install it or extract the files. If you have reasons not to update to 10.8.5, additionally download and install Pacifist. Open the image OSXUpdCombo10.8.5.dmg. In the mounted image open the file OSXUpdCombo10.8.5.pkg with Pacifist. Then install them by choosing the three files in the keychain folder and hitting Install (red circle).\n\nYou need admin privileges to do so.\n\nThis might not solve your problems immediately but you got all the Thawte certificates back and start over resolving your issue.\nAdditionally I advice to update to OS X 10.8.5 and install any supplemental updates for 10.8.5 and the newest security updates: Security Update 2015-006 Mountain Lion.\n", "Q: iTunes is not showing device backups - can't restore backup In iTunes (12.3 on Windows), clicking\nEdit > Preferences... > Device tab\nshows an empty list of backups even though there should be a bunch of them.\nI needed to get my phone replaced, so I backed up my phone last night, took it to Apple today and got a replacement. In trying to restore the new phone from the backup, iTunes never offered the option - it would just say \"Welcome to your new iPhone\" with a Continue button.\nNo matter what I did, it would never offer the option to restore from a previous backup. So I selected Continue and it set it up as a new phone. The options to restore from a previous Backup were greyed out. I tried various suggestions from the internet with no luck - for example, doing a backup and then holding down shift when clicking the Restore button without any luck.\n\nA: One of the backup folders was causing a problem.\nHere is where the backups are stored:\nOn Windows at %AppData%\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\\nOn Mac it's at ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup\nHere's what to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move all the folders in the Backup folder to a different location\n\n*Move a single folder back (I did it in reverse chronological order)\n\n*Click on Edit > Preferences > Device tab to see if the backups show in the list\n\n*Repeat 2 and 3 until you get an empty list - you've found the bad backup folder (or at least a backup that the newer iTunes can't understand)\n\n*Delete or move that bad backup\n\n\nIn my case, it was an old iPad 1 iOS5 backup that was causing the problem.\nThis can also be caused if you have your iTunes storage on a different drive. I just had this issue and when it backed up it stored to the C: drive instead of the F: drive where I have all my iTunes files. I just needed to move the folder from the path above on the C: drive to the same path on the F: drive.\n", "Q: iMessage keeps popping up How can I disable the iMessage pop up when I turn on my Mac? It keeps asking me to sign in with my Apple ID. I don't want to set it up because I don't want to use iMessage. But the box keeps opening every time I turn on my Mac and it is getting frustrating as I have to go through 3 pages before I can turn it off.\n\nA: I had to contact apple support for this solution. The fact that it is not intuitive implies a usability bug. The reason for the prompt is a keychain entry under either login or local items. Basically after removing all entries with the text 'apple' in them I was able to restart and login with no facetime or imessage prompts to login. I hope this helps.\n\nA: iMessenger is the iOS version for iPhone/iPad etc. On your Mac, it's called \"Messages\". Open Messages, go to your Preferences tab in Messages. Select your Message account from the list on the left, then click on the checkbox next to Enable this account to remove the checkmark and disable your Message account on your Mac.\n\nA: This is not the answer you deserve… but the answer you need an answer that works…\nThis did it for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Messages and log into it. (Every Mac user does have an Apple account, since it's required to activate the OS on install, no?)\n\n*In the Messages preferences, log out.\n\n\nResult: no more annoying popup asking me to log in on reboot.\nThis is about as intuitive as Windows 95 gets, but please don't blame the… messenger.\n(FYI, I have no iCloud info set inside of System Preferences, and Settings > General > Handoff & Suggested Apps is ticked off.

The pop-up mentioned my e-mail address so it must have stored some personal data at one point. However I never signed in to iMessage, iCloud, iTunes or other Apple cloud services on this device or on other Apple devices.\nFinally I searched for files that contain the e-mail address and ended up deleting ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.identityservicesd.plist. YMMV and proceed at your own risk, but it worked for me!\n[dirk] For me it worked as well. Since I favour renaming files over deleting them, I did\nmv ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.identityservicesd.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.identityservicesd.pl-dis-ist\n\nThen I signed off and on again. The prompt did not appear anymore.\nNow I renamed the file back\nmv ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.identityservicesd.pl-dis-ist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.identityservicesd.plist\n\nplus signed off and on again. And, - surprise surprise - the prompt still did not show up.\nSince the file content now is again like it was before, that may minimise some fear of getting into general trouble loosing your stored identities.\n\nA: You can disable it through the Preferences in iMessenger app in your Mac. Follow this link\n\nA: Open messages app then click on the Messages tab located at the top left of your screen. Then click quit messages. This should fix your problem.

When scrolling a page up or down using fn ↑ and fn ↓ in a text editor, the editor jumps immediately to the next page. This is confusing when reading structured documents such as source code (programming). Is there a way to get OS X to smoothly scroll down one page, as if I would have used the trackpad?\n\nA: Smooth scrolling is dependent on the application. TextEdit does offer smooth scrolling when paging through a long document. BBEdit 11 does not.\nApple's developer WWDC 2013 talk below is aimed at helping developers to achieve this:\n\nOptimizing Drawing and Scrolling on OS X\nCreating a responsive app requires fast drawing and smooth scrolling. Discover techniques to optimize drawing, find out best practices for handling layers, and learn how to combine those techniques with new features to achieve smooth scrolling.\n\nIf possible, provide feedback to the editor's developer that you value this behaviour.\n", "Q: Mac book pro manufacturing year How to identify mac book pro product manufacturing year? And not the product release date.\nexample is mac book pro series launched in 2012 but what is its product manufactured date?\n\nA: If you're running Yosemite or later, click Apple symbol (top left) -> About This Mac & it's there.\n\nA: There's a freeware app from Micromat, the makers of TechTool Pro, called MachineProfile which will give detailed information…\n\nIt can even give away anomalies - for instance, my machine shows as a 2010 (which should make it a 4,1) & yet it registers as a 5,1. That's because it's had a hardware upgrade to 2012 spec.\n", "Q: Can I play ARK: Survival Evolved on my MacBook Air? I bought my 13″ MacBook Air a couple months ago. I usually check the compatibility with Can You Run It before purchasing the game on Steam. In this case, I'm buying Ark: Survival Evolved. Unfortunately, that site doesn't support Mac.\nIs there any other website where I can check game compatibility for Mac computers?\nMy system's specification:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Software: Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 (11G63)  \n\n*Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 3000 384 MB  \n\n*Memory: 4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3  \n\n*Processor: 1.7 GHz Intel Core i5\n\n\nWith these can I play any of these games on my system?\n\nA: No, according to http://www.survival-evolved.com/ark-guides/survival-evolved-system-requirements.html\n\nMac OS X\n  MINIMUM:\n• OS: OSX 10.9 or Higher\n  • Processor: 2 GHz Equivalent CPU\n  • Memory: 4000 MB RAM\n  • Graphics: OpenGL 3 Compatible GPU with 1GB Video RAM\n  • Hard Drive: 20000 MB available space  \n\nYour machine is under-spec on CPU & GPU & OS requirement.\n\nA: I don't think so and I wouldn't suggest you do. \nGames recently demand very high specs and MBA is not a device for gaming. Even if the game runs, you'll experience frame drops and other annoying things that will make gaming a torture. There is also a chance that it would kill the device.\nIf you're going to play on a laptop at least choose one with a dedicated GPU, not an integrated one.\nAnyway, You can check how your device will perform on Can You RUN It?\n\nA: Probably not. There appear to be major bugs on the Mac version of ARK that are separate from performance anyways - even if you had a newer, beefier Mac. I'm running a 2017 MBP with highest specs, and the graphics are acceptable, but it crashes periodically for unknown reasons.\n", "Q: How do I backup and external hard drive (iPhoto Library) to another external hard drive? My iPhoto Library is on an external hard drive.  I want to copy it to another hard drive as a back up.  It looks like Time Machine only backups the internal hard drive and selected externals.  I don't want to back up my internal.  I only want to backup my external.  What do i do?  What programs will do this?  If Time Machine does do this, please explain how.  I don't see that option.  \n\nA: Well first I would ask you: why in the world would you not want to back up your internal drive?\nSecond, you could easily set up Time Machine, but simply add the internal drive to the exclusions.\n\nA: Copying files/folders/bundles etc. from one location to another is basic Finder 101.  Have a look at Mac Basics: The Finder organizes all of your files to gain a more complete understanding of the Finder app.  While the KB doesn't explicitly mention \"Copy\" nonetheless you'll see it on the picture of the Toolbar Action menu.  \nDrag and Drop works too as well as standard Keyboard shortcuts like ⌘C for Copy and ⌘V for Paste, which are on the Edit menu.\nSo in Finder, select your target files/folders/bundles etc. and preform the requisite actions in one form or combination thereof.\nUsing the iPhoto Library bundle as an example, you'd select it in Finder and then press ⌘C and then navigate to the location you want the copy and then press ⌘V.  This action will then copy the iPhoto Library bundle from its source location to is destination location.\nIf you do not what to do this manually all the time you could script it in many different ways or simple use Time Machine to keep it backed up.\nSince you do not want the internal drive (Macintosh HD) backed up, go to System Preferences > Time Machine > Options and add the Macintosh HD to the Exclude these items from backup list while making sure the source external drive containing the iPhoto Library bundle is not in the list.  Note that the drive must be mounted to see it in the list.\nSave the changes and now back at the main Time Machine panel click the Select Disk... button and select the other external drive you want to use for the Time Machine backups.  Note that both the source and destinations disks must be formatted with the native OS X filesystem for this to work.\nThen if the Time Machine OFF/ON switch is the to OFF set it to ON.\n", "Q: The \"Esc\" key in my bluetooth keyboard doesn't work, how to fix it? I'm using Mac mini, and bought this new bluetooth keyboard. It's not Apple production, but has Apple layout. The other keys all work except \"Esc\" in the left up corner. Obviously it won't be handy if this important key didn't work. How to fix it, please?\n\nA: I have (likely) the same keyboard and solved the problem this way: I mapped caps lock to esc.\nYou can do this via System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys. There, at Caps Lock select Escape.\n", "Q: How to terminate cleanly another session left running? I am the admin on a shared MacOS X: Big_server running Yosemite.\nThe version of MacOS isn't a key information: I had the same kind of problem on all versions of MacOS.\nBut today I have a practical big case and time to analyze and test solutions.\nBig_server is hosting professionnal services (firewall and mail server)\nand can't be rebooted to play.\nI have another user bob who left his session open.\nHe forgot to close it and is on vacation for many weeks.\nHence the console is locked waiting for his password.\nI know how to kill bob's session like a pig.\nHowever, I noticed that this colleague has more than 50 processes running,\nsome of them terminating with:\n...Support/photolibraryd\n.../com.apple.CloudPhotosConfiguration\n...\n\nand I would like to avoid corrupting any of his libraries or files\nwhich might have been left opened.\nHow may I terminate cleanly bob's session without corrupting his data?\n\nA: Bob’s user can send a Kill signal to all their processes. \nsudo su - bob\nkill -9 -1\n\nThis leaves all non Bob processes running and sends the non maskable SIGKILL to all processes by that UID. On newer os, some processes will respawn as uses Bob, but you’ll have cleaned them up momentarily and the old session will be gone. \n", "Q: How to record if and when my Macbook is opened I like to know when my family goes on my Macbook for numerous reasons.

I would like to take a picture of this Apple Pay popup, while TouchID is active. However this seems impossible to do, since the TouchID sensor is also the home button, which prevents a screenshot from being taken. \nIs there any alternative to taking a screen shot?\n\nA: On iOS 10 and below, you need an external assist. Connect the iPhone to a Mac over USB and there are multiple free apps to grab a screen shot at your convenience without pressing any keys.\nXcode is the Mac OS X app I'd start with to grab screen shots.\nOn iOS 11, screen recording is build in, so you can record the action and extract a still frame if desired using various apps. \n\nA: Open QuickTime and create a new movie recording.   Record the screen on your iPhone using Apple Pay.  Move the playhead to the desired location for the screenshot and copy the frame using Command-C. \nNow open the Preview app and select \"New from Clipboard\" under \"File\" from the main menu to get your screenshot. \n\nA: You could enable AssistiveTouch in Settings > General > Accessibility and then clicking on it's icon, and tapping Device > Take Screenshot.\n\nA: Use your fingernail - don't let your fingerprint touch the sensor and it will not dismiss...\n\nA: I suggest using one of your fingers TouchID isn't associated with, like your pinky. If you have set up TouchID with all your fingers, you can use your elbow. Or your nose. Or your chin.\n\nA: Aside from hitting the home button and using Assistive Touch to do the screenshot. You can also use Apple's AirPlay feature to mirror your iOS screen to Windows or Mac via Wi-Fi, and then take screenshot. It also works.\nSource Link: http://showmore.com/screenshot-iphone-6s.html\n", "Q: \"VPN is not configured\" error on El Capitan I discovered this new annoying bug in El Capitan 10.11.2 running on a MacBook Pro Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013. \nSometimes when I click on the VPN icon in the menu bar, I get \"VPN is not configured\" despite the fact that I configured three.  It is all resolved by going into System Preferences → Network, then unchecking and rechecking the \"Show VPN Status in menu bar\" checkbox.\nEven though I can manually sort the issue each time, I would like a more robust and permanent solution.\n\nA: One workaround that I found useful was to use Tunnelblick rather than macOS built-in VPN networking. Tunnelblick is open source and generally respected, and if you are able to install this software on your machine, it is a more robust and permanent solution than macOS' Networking prefpane.\n\nA: This was a bug on El Capitan and it is now back with Catalina. Connecting to the VPN via network preferences also repopulates the list like toggling show/hide does, but there is no fix yet.\n\nA: Try switching Wifi networks, and then switching back to the one you were on. Worked for me!\n", "Q: Will iMovie erase my work if I quit it? I have been making an iMovie on OS X El Capitan for the past few days. Unfortunately, I have not saved even once, I just left it open and it would always be there when I clicked on the icon. Now, I deleted many pictures from the movie, and I saw the spinning wheel of death. I thought it would go away soon as it always does, but twenty minutes later it was still spinning. I can't click on anything in the app. \nI don't want to force quit, because I will lose all of my work, right? What can I do to save my work?\n\nA: Sadly, you've passed the point where you get to save your work.\nLuckily, iMovie periodically saves the application database / library so you are unlikely to lose everything if you decide to shut down the Mac or force quit the application. Once you regain control of the application (you already know you can't do anything with it stuck in a state where it's no longer responding to messages, input - a.k.a spinning wheel of death) you can see if the changes you made are missing.\nIf they are, a call to apple support might be needed to restore the backup copies of the library it has made internally since Apple doesn't document how to restore a previous iMovie library publicly.\nGoing forward, you can set a timer and periodically save/quit iMovie and then back up the files. Time Machine allows you to make local snapshots if you don't have your backup volume connected.\nsudo tmutil enablelocal\n\nThen to make a point in time snapshot of all the files, quit iMovie and then run in terminal:\ntmutil snap\n\nThat saves a neat point in time version of all your files that you can then recover later using the Time Machine interface.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Retina Early 2015 bootcamp My bootcamp doesn't have the 'selected tasks' \nPlease help! I really need windows on my mac. \nThank you :)\n\n\nA: In your window, click the \"Go Back\" button until you get to the selection screen.\nNote: Also, don't get illegal copies of OSes. If you want a free copy of Windows 10, sign up for the Windows Insider Program. You can get a free ISO file from there.\n", "Q: Preventing 13-year-old from downloading apps previously downloaded My 13-year-old had an Apple ID before family sharing was available. In the span of a few days he had downloaded a bunch of messaging apps on his iPhone that we, the parents, do not approve of. We deleted them and instituted family sharing (to require approval of app downloads), but it still allows him to download these deleted apps because he had downloaded them before.  \nHow can I clear out the previously downloaded apps so if he tries to download them again it will require him to \"ask to buy?\"  Also, there are some downloads that are on his phone that I believe he found a way around family sharing.  Is this possible? How can you prevent it? \n\nA: You have to go into restrictions and take away their ability to install all apps and blocking the App Store. It’s a pain, but it is the only thing I’ve found that works. My son got ahold of his phone when the restrictions were off and got an app I didn’t like. Even when it was back on to where he had to have me “approve” new apps, it didn’t stop him from reloading the offensive one. Only restricting access to the App Store and all installations worked. Now if he finds out about an app, he has to hand me his phone. \n\nA: If you control the Apple ID with which the apps have been downloaded, you can hide bought things from the list of 'previously purchased' apps, however I don't think that it also disables the download button if you go these apps' product pages directly.\n\nA: Delete his old Apple ID and get a new one for him. There will be no application history on a new account.  \n", "Q: Are all installations of OS X (10.8+) Case Insensitive (by default)? I'm going to be getting a refurbished machine and rather than keep my current OS (10.6.8), I need to upgrade to at least 10.8, in order to be able to communicate with devices that use iOS 9 (since you need a newer version of iTunes).\nMy current install is Case-Sensitive and Journalled, and it works well for me.  The issue is, I will also need a newer version of Adobe Acrobat (9 or higher), and everything I've read says it requires a Case-Insensitive file system.\nSo here's my question: if Acrobat is so popular and often used, does this mean that installations of OS X are by default Case-Insensitive, or does everyone have to reformat and reinstall OX S after the purchase Acrobat?\n\nA: By default, HFS+ in OS X is case-insensitive. You have to specifically erase a partition and select case-sensitive for a partition to be case-sensitive.\nIt's not that common, but there is software which requires case-insensitive HFS+. It's more common for legacy software to require case-sensitive HFS+. Of course, software should work on both, and most newer software does. The Acrobat restriction feels like a way to avoid unreproducible bug reports from users using (awkward) case-sensitive volumes.\n", "Q: Upgrade 2011, 64 GB, iPad 2 (GSM model) running 5.1.1 to iOS 6 or 7 only - not jailbroken I know this is similar to another question, but I think it's a different situation.  I hope it's okay to start a new thread.\nI want to upgrade, but to nothing higher than iOS 6 or 7. The performance on our other iPad2 on iOS 8 is horrible.  I don't dare try iOS 9.\nI've downloaded an IPSW file from osxdaily.com (iPad2,2_6.0.1_10A523_Restore.ipsw) but neither iTunes nor redsn0w will let me install it.  ITunes comes back with \"This device isn‘t eligible for the requested build\" and redsn0w says \"That IPSW isn't supported by this version of redsn0w.\"\nI do not have the SHSH blobs from iOS 4.\nCan you tell me what I'm doing wrong?  Will iTunes not install the IPSW because Apple isn't signing it anymore?  If so, is there another route I can take?\nThanks.\n\nA: Apple no longer signs any software older than iOS 9, so installing iOS 6 or 7 on your iPad 2 is impossible, whether it's jailbroken or not.\nThe iPad 2 is getting pretty old anyway, if you need to run newer software then you may as well upgrade to a newer iPad. I suggest looking for a used one on eBay.\n", "Q: Firefox: double-click on titlebar maximize window instead on open new tab Recently, I noted that Firefox started to behave differently when I double-click on its title-bar / tab-bar.\nIt maximizes the windows as if I clicked on the semaphore + button, instead of opening a new tab like it used to do before.\nAnyone knows how to get the old behavior back?\n\nA: Double-click to maximise is a System pref\n menu > System Preferences > Dock\nUncheck \"Double-click a window's title bar to…zoom\"\n\n", "Q: How to move image to particular time in iMovie? So I have been trying to add image to my iMovie. The problem is I want to add the image at for example 2:00 min. But whenever I drag the image to the project, it always goes in the beginning of the movie. Is there a way I can just drag and drop it to whatever time I want to add it to. This seems to be pretty intuitive but not able to do this. \n\nA: Click on 1 of your highlighted images and drag it into the clip editing/viewing timeline screen to the left diagonal of the photo display screen. You can drag these images anywhere in the timeline. Hope it helps.\n\nA: If you're talking about iMovie on the Mac,you can simply drag an image anywhere in the timeline. On iOS, simply position the timeline scrubber at a gap in a space in the timeline where you want your image, and then tap the image from the image chooser.\n", "Q: Updated iMac to Yosemite 10.10.5 and USB keyboard stopped working I updated my iMac's OS to Yosemite 10.10.5 and found that the Apple USB keyboard is no longer working.\nI tried different USB ports to no result.\nI tried using the keyboard on another computer and it works fine.\nI tried an Apple Bluetooth keyboard and it works fine.\nWould anyone know what I could do to get it working again?\n\nA: Try this, while it is very basic: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19094?locale=en_US\nAlso check what other USB are working (mouse, etc.)\nDo a PRAM Reset\nRestart >\nCommand + Option + P + R\nholding the keys when the Apple sign doesnt appear yet on the screen,\nit restarts and USB ports start working.\nYou can also try a SMC: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\nI am using a new iMac with El capitan and preferred using my old USB keyboard instead of the elegant wirelerss one.

I have also rebooted the machine, but the connection still succeeds.\nIt seems that this should work.   I have searched extensively, and this approach is the most recommended.  What am I missing?\n\nA: Please use the following hosts file entries:\n##\n# Host Database\n#\n# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface\n# when the system is booting.

Long story short, I know that there is no way that I can use it as a monitor for my gaming PC, but I was wondering if it would be possible for my iMac to control my gaming PC via the Remote Desktop Application or would there be too much lag? (both machines are on the same network so this would be done locally)\nI cannot try this yet because I am still in the process of getting my PC back, but I am seeing this as the only viable solution at the moment other than just purchasing a monitor for it. \n\nA: While this is theoretically possible, if you care about frame rates at all you would not do Remote Desktop for gaming. You would have a hard time getting frame rates above 15fps.\nRemote Desktop is meant for logging into work computers from home, or controlling headless servers, not gaming.\n", "Q: How to log in to a Mac OSX desktop with no user account password?

I have created a .sparseimage file of my Home folder on my 2009 iMac running OS 10.11.2 and have chosen a 17 character password which https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm notes that against an Offline Fast Attack Scenario (Assuming one hundred billion guesses per second) it would take 11.52 million trillion centuries to break.\nMy intention was to move it to my iCloud account but I find I cannot do so because it exceeds the limitation on file sizes that one is allowed to upload to one's iCloud account.\nMy question is, am I risking the possible compromise of this file by storing in on my Dropbox account?  It has financial and other legal info that I would never want compromised.\n\nA: Your password will not be compromised by a brute-force attack. More likely it will fall to some other attack such as a password grabber or malware. Your computer will be able to open the sparseimage and therefore the obvious target to attack is your computer. The sparseimage and its password is safe enough, but you should ask yourself a few questions about why you want to approach securing your data this way. \n\n\n*\n\n*Consider securing your high-value data in a small encrypted sparsebundle image within your Home folder, rather than unsecured within your Home folder and then trying to password protect it when you copy the whole Home folder into Dropbox\n\n*Storing your home folder in Dropbox sounds to me like a poor design (I am not a security expert). If you are looking for backup plans then Time Machine disks can be password protected too (this results in a sparsebundle protected by a strong password. Your Time Machine disk image, and the multiple machine snapshots which it contains, can then be stored in an off-site store of your choice. The Time Machine disk image can only be accessed with your strong password\n\n*Take care when trusting to estimates of password strength. A 17 character password can appear to be strong to an algorithm designed only to look for length and variety, but may well appear in the many non-dictionary password tables. For example \"passwordpassword!\" Contains 17 characters, but you can be sure that someone somewhere has already used it and it probably appears in a huge password table somewhere.\n\n", "Q: Where is the icon used in this dialogue box?

The system has to run 2 OS'es and definitely on a 4GB Macbook Air this might require some serious disk swapping (granted, swapped to a quite fast SSD indeed).\nHowever if you're talking about Bootcamp, I'd expect quite the opposite: it'll run better on your MacBook than on a similar spec'ed PC laptop.\nApple has done a great job on supplying the correct hardware drivers and your system will probably run like a charm - even with the 4GB version.\nAs you know 'Ask Different' is a Apple oriented stack, and it will be difficult to find people - including me -  endorsing it.\nYou might be one of these 2 types of users:\nType 1.\nYou've worked on Windows for your whole life and, while you love the outer design of the Macbook, you don't feel ready to move to OSX.\nToday, most of the software available on Windows has similar solutions available on OSX.\nI've been there. and strongly suggest you do the same as I did.  Go for OSX, cold turkey.  It will feel awkward first, but I promise you won't regret it.  Risk is high you're going to hate Windows later.\nType 2.\nYou're working on OSX but you need software not available on OSX.  In our organisation we do have Macs equiped with Windows via VMWare Fusion just because there are no alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*ArcGIS: while we use QGIS on OSX internally, we still need ArcGIS because our partners use it.\n\n*Specific analyzing/flashing/config & maintenance toolsets for certain hardware\n\n*Specific webbased tools only available for Internet Explorer (certain java tools and ActiveX components)\nChances are low any of these will ever be available under OSX but the day they are available, VMWare will go, that's for sure.\n\n", "Q: Music App: order by album release date in iOS 9? When I tap in the artist in the Music app, I see the list of their albums.\nIs there a way to make this list sorted by year (release date)?\nI'm on iOS 9\n\nA: Sadly there seems to be no way to do this natively, but Picky handles it nicely. \n", "Q: iMac - Can't install a Supplemental Update (10.8.5) Just the other day, I had an iMac issue resolved by a AskDifferent member, but part of the solution pushed me to go from 10.8.4 to 10.8.5.  I am locked to 10.8, due to applications I use that are dependent on it, but I felt it was a good idea to finally take it to the last update of 10.8, which is 10.8.5.  I did it through the 10.8.5 combo installer versus the app store updater.  I also installed the latest security updates.  Now, I'm trying to install the Supplemental update for 10.8.5 and I'm getting an error message.  Here it is:\n\nAny idea what's going on here?  Much appreciated.\n\nA: As the dates on the pages for both the Combo & Supplemental updates are identical, the chances are the Supplemental may have been later rolled into the Combo.

The App Store offers me to upgrade to El Capitan, so I guess the MacBook Air is still supported. But I wonder if you can really enjoy El Capitan with only 2 GB ram? \nThe reason why I think about upgrading at all (beside security issues) is a new iPhone that won't sync with an old iTunes.\n\nA: The official system requirements from Apple state 2GB of RAM minimum. And as you have flash-based storage the paging to disk that many people see running RAM hungry apps will not be too bad. With any luck.\nHowever I would be hesitant to recommend it as the newer the OS the more RAM hungry it seems to be. I would make a disk image of your current drive somewhere safe (external USB drive) so you can restore it easily if you don't like the results.\n\nA: I upgraded to Yosemite with 2gb of memory on my 2010 Airbook with no issues. I'm also wondering about this new OS however. \n", "Q: Prolific PL2303 ceased working On my MacBook Air (running 10.11.2), all my Prolific PL2303 USB-RS232 Adapters (USB VID_067B&PID_2303) ceased working out of the blue, literally over night.

If I go to System Preferences > Network > Advanced it is shown that I have 2 different IPv6 addresses (both with a 64-bit prefix). Why is so? \nIf I type ifconfig | grep inet on the terminal, it also shows me those 2 IPv6 addresses (among the other addresses). At the end of one of those 2 IPv6 addresses there's the word dynamic and at the end of the other there's autoconf temporary. Why wonder why should we need two IPv6 addresses and what is the different between dynamic and autoconf temporary.\n\nA: There appear to be four different types of IPv6 addresses:\n\n\n*\n\n*Main address, using your ISP prefix + derivation of your network-interface MAC-address.\n\n*Temporary addresses, based on your main address but with randomization to prevent tracking. (a new one is generated every so often)\n\n*Link-local address, identified by starting with fe80:. (not usable globally, tied to routing)\n\n*Unique local address, identified by starting with fd00:. (not usable globally, not tied to routing)\n\n\nIn my case, I just enabled IPv6 on my home network, and found I have one of each of these these four types of addresses for my Windows computer. (showing up when I run ipconfig)\nI wasn't confused by the Temporary address and the Link-Local address since they were marked as such, but I was confused at first by the second address that was labeled the same way as my main. I noticed it was shorter though and started with fd00, and after Googling that, found that it's the Unique Local Address for my device.\n\nA: IPv6 used to be derived of the MAC address of your device. This is the Modified EUI-64 format. Such addresses are recognisable by looking at the middle of the last 64 bits. If they contain ..ff:fe.. then it is probably a EUI-64 based address.\nBecause the algorithm produces the same 64 bits every time some people were afraid that it would become easy to track mobile devices such as laptops and smart phones. Every network would have a different prefix, but the last 64 bits would always be the same.\nThat is why Privacy Extensions were invented. A device generates new 64 bits every once in a while and uses that in the IPv6 address. Because new addresses are generated regularly the addresses are marked as temporary. A device can have multiple privacy extension addresses if the system is still using an old address when a new address is being generated. The system will keep the old address for as long as necessary. For new outgoing connections a system will usually use the most recently generated temporary address to maintain a maximum level of privacy.\n", "Q: Problem with 3 TB Fusion Drive, it can't be deleted, formatted or partitioned I want to clarify that I already followed the instruction with I think I messed up the Fusion Drive on my 1TB iMac (with BootCamp) but I think I have mayor problems. \nI followed the instructions to 'Rebuild Fusion Drive' (recommended if you have a Time Machine backup) but when I tried to delete the LVG with diskutil cs delete LVGUUID, it showed an error that the disk couldn't be unmounted.

It used to be stored in a resource fork, but I've tried listing the resource forks for files on my computer, and they don't seem to have resource forks.\nWhere is the metadata stored now?  Like where is it in the filesystem?\nHow can I access it so I can perform a backup and restore of just the metadata or part of the metadata?\n\nA: Extended file attributes\nFile metadata is stored in extended file attributes (EA) in macOS.\nYou can see them when listing files in Terminal using command:\nls -la@\n\nFor example if your file has a custom Finder icon, you could see listing similar to this one:\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 user  staff  168142 Oct  1 23:02 file.ext\n    com.apple.FinderInfo        32 \n    com.apple.ResourceFork  548373 \n    com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags     42 \n\nThis means that file has 3 attributes (metadata), including resource fork holding the icon data.\nResource fork\nTo print resource fork contents of a file, you can use xattr command that allows you to access extended file attributes:\nxattr -p com.apple.ResourceFork\n\nhowever that might not be as useful because resource forks have only binary representation.\nYou can access that data in different way, through a dedicated filepath filename/..namedfork/rsrc. Using the example above to copy resource fork into a resource file (data fork):\ncp file.ext/..namedfork/rsrc file.rsrc\n\nMany commands have support for handling extended file attributes, for example cp -p will copy files including access control lists and extended attributes. If you want to copy resource forks separately, then you need to access them individually through ../namedfork/rsrc path.\n", "Q: MacBook bought as new could potentially be a refurbished older model In mid-2014, Wife bought a new MacBook directly from apple.com . Said laptop has been acting in some weird ways, like freezing and rebooting itself for no reason, or taking in the order of a full minute or two to start reacting when she opened it in the morning. She attributed it the OS the laptop came with (Maverick) being an inferior version. Now the laptop stopped working altogether ---as in, it won't boot, and it won't allow a fresh reinstall of the OS (either Maverick or other). We are putting our money on a hard drive failure. When she called Apple Support to have it taken care of, the conversation went like this:\nApple: can we have your laptop's serial number?\nWife: yes, it is [serial number]\nApple: oh, so our system says that your laptop is a 2012 refurbished model.\nWife: beg your pardon?\nApple: excuse me, I was digressing, have you thought of upgrading to El Capitán?\n\nWife is mildly disturbed by this, and so am I. For one, she paid the amount of money that a new machine costs! The questions at this point are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can we independently check the origin of the laptop via the serial number?\n\n*Has Apple sold refurbished stuff as new before, either by mistake or on purpose?\n\n*If we confirm Apple sold Wife a refurbished machine, are we entitled to any type of compensation?\n\n\nA: Click on Apple Menu -> About this Mac...\nIt should tell you exactly which hardware version you're using -- e.g. mine says \"MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\"\nIf you want even more detail, there's a free app called MacTracker https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mactracker/id430255202?mt=12 on the App Store that will provide even more info.\nAs to the second and third questions...shrug\n", "Q: Start Terminal in AppleScript At work I'm overseeing several users who use MacBooks to connect to our enterprise environment.\nOne of our vendors has an old server which users access via ssh. I've created an Automator workflow to launch terminal, set it up the way they like (legacy color scheme and font) and get them to the ssh prompt from the server. I get some unexpected behavior in that when the Automator workflow runs, it opens two Terminal windows, then window I want (ssh client) and then another regular Terminal login. \nIf the ssh window is closed, Terminal remains open, and the next time the workflow is run, the window isn't visible until the user manually switches to Terminal. \nThe other peculiarities I'm observing seem to be tied to the fact that the AppleScript spawns two Terminal windows, and then the users simply closing the window rather than quitting Terminal when exiting. Is there a better way to do this? Could I have Terminal quit by default when the \"Close Window\" button is hit?\nCaveats:\nThis is a controlled environment. I'm pushing my luck with vendor support using Terminal already, they didn't want to support anything other than Linux ssh. 3rd party applications are not acceptable solutions.\n\nA: You can force Terminal to become frontmost by adding the line:\nactivate application \"Terminal\"\n\ninto your applescript. \nif you launch Terminal with:\ntell application \"Terminal\" to open location \"ssh://user@example.com\"\n\nthen Terminal won't open an extra window.\n", "Q: I've tried to export from Photos to hard drive but it says my Mac Hard Drive is in \"read\" only mode How change so I can export?

Instead, as an end user, I want to run a mail filter as a background process on my Mac, scanning my IMAP inbox regularly and moving likely spam to another folder. And when I mark something as spam manually, this process should share this information with a common server (which I'd pay to use) or a decentralized distribution system, and thereby identifying likely spam as a \"hive intelligence\".\n\nA: The short answer to this is NO.\nI think you are confusing Gmail's SPAM filtering methodology with single user methodology.  What you have to remember is that Gmail is a cloud based service and it IS providing mail service to billions of users.  So, even though you have a single email address with SPAM filtering, it's filtering for all users.\nAdditionally, SPAM filtering is a \"learning\" process - meaning the system learns what SPAM is as it goes.  The moment you take it from the cloud (or server) to your local machine, it can't learn from other email accounts.  (Which is why you want to share the database)\nOnce you have to create an infrastructure to start sharing the database to be able share what it has learned, you would have found it's easier and cheaper to set up a mail server and use a SPAM filter module. \nMy suggestion is to use a cloud based email provider.  I personally use hosted Exchange directly from Microsoft and I pay on $48 per year for this service.  In addition, I have a \"private\" email address I only give to colleagues and \"disposable\" email address I use when registering for websites, trade shows, and product downloads.  Using this technique I can easily identify SPAM; the result is that I have an extremely clean mailbox.\n\nA: you may want to try SpamSieve, here my review after usage of almost 1 year : http://geer.fr/tired-of-spam-try-spamsieve/\n", "Q: Boot Camp 6 update won't install on Windows 10 Using Apple Software Update gets an installer error when trying to update Boot Camp from 5.1 to 6.0 on a MacBook Pro retina laptop running Windows 10.

I paired the trackpad with a tablet to test, and it paired, so I logged back to windows 10, then it paired with the '0000' code.\nStrange, but it worked.\n\nA: On Windows 10, when asked to enter pin, use \"0000\" then press enter on the keyboard and click the trackpad immediately. \nIt worked for me.\n", "Q: How to map buttons on my mouse with AppleScript? Since BetterTouchTool is becoming paid, I was looking for an alternative solutions to map my navigation buttons (prev. page, next page) on my mouse (Logitech MX518) that I enjoy using for browsing websites. Right now these two button perform the same action like pressing the scroll wheel. \nI already tried Logitech's own software but that seems to be a rather overkill solution and apart from using too much resources, it is also too obtrusive while booting up.\nSo I was wondering if there is an easy solution with AppleScript that I could write to just do this trick of mapping a button on my mouse to possibly a swipe gesture (like on trackpads)?\n\nA: Karabiner, which Joonas suggested, natively has back/forward options for buttons 4 and 5. You do not have to create a xtml file.\nThe option is under 'pointing device' > 'button to key' > 'use button 4 and 5 as back/forward'.\nI have only used it for 30 minutes so far, but it worked straight away by just activating those checkmarks (mouse: ttesports black v2)\n", "Q: How to disable the No SIM Card Installed warning in iPad when using it without SIM?

So many times, I'll call someone (iPhone to iPhone) and the iPhone will ring once, but goes to voice mail immediately about halfway through the ring.\nWhat are the possibilities? I'm assuming the phone is dead could be one, but I know that's not the case. Maybe they could also be on the phone?\nThen I'll call 10 minutes later after they text me back saying \"whats up,\" and it rings normally. I figure they must have been on the phone? But I thought it normally gives them a choice whether to drop the current call or not, so maybe that'd take more time than half a ring?\nI called 3 times, and all 3 times it rang half a ring, and went to voicemail.\n\nA: Half a ring means that the phone received the call, but instantly declined it. I've only seen this behaviour with the caller blacklist, or the do not disturb mode ☽...  In your case, as the person you called seen your call,  it means that it's the do not disturb mode that caused this \n\nA: *\n\n*phone dead (although I think that's 0 rings)\n\n*phone off\n\n*they're on the phone right now\n\n*rejected the call (although it would ring different frequencies)\n\n*weak or no signal\n\n*iPhone is on do not disturb\n\n\nA: If calls to your device are not ringing, it means that your cellular carrier had difficulty getting the call to your handset before the central office diverted the call to voicemail.\nThe voicemail happens server side, so you would contact your carrier to get into why calls are being placed but not arriving at your device in time to answer them.\nIf the calls you place are having issues, it's either the user has a do not disturb set server side or has really quick reflexes to send the call to voicemail. No proper network sends a call to voicemail in less than 3 rings in my experience. I could be wrong on that, but those are the things to rule out first.\n\nA: If its going straight to voice mail its normal off OR he's on the other line. If it rings a couple times he's forwarding ur call. If it rings ur 4 times he's probably buzzy and if it rings like 7 or 8 times that's ify, it could mean his cells off, of possibly he's on the other line or the carrier on his side maybe could have a problem\n", "Q: List All Files in USB device from /Volumes Shell Script To clear things up I have setup folder actions on my mac for whenever a USB device is plugged into my mac it will run a shell script.\nWhen I list all files in the Directory /Volumes i get\n$ ls -a\n.       ..      .DS_Store   MobileBackups   Storage     WED\n\nWhat I want to do is list all folders and files located in WED or any USB that pops up, so therefore excluding the directories\n.       ..      .DS_Store   MobileBackups   Storage\n\nLeaving me with\nWED\n\nWhat i have for the script so far is:\nGLOBIGNORE='/Volumes/MobileBackups*':'/Volumes/Storage*'\nfind '/Volumes' >> /Users/Brett/dev/USBLOGS/LogUSB.txt\n\nI have tried multiple different ways but it still ends up listing every single file in the /Volumes directory.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Brett\nAdditionally, it is MAC OS X El Capitan\n\nA: Since you only want find to act on USB block devices the following is an example of using information reported by System Profiler to get the Mount Point of any attached and mounted USB block device.  By doing it this way it doesn't matter what other mount points exist under /Volumes nor does it matter what the USB block device name is as it's ascertained from System Profiler not the ls command.\nI've modified the code, once again, removing the compound command line as it not likely it would be run that way anyway and is easier to maintain in script form while adding the ability to handle spaces in the label name of the USB block device.\nBy temporarily changing the Internal Field Separator $IFS, adding IFS=$'\\n' to the script will ignore the space(s) as a separator in the output of grep when passed to find.  So as not to mess with any code in the rest of your script I fist get the state of $IFS and then rest it afterwards.\nIn a bash script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n_ifs=\"$IFS\"\nIFS=$'\\n'\nfor p in $(system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep -oE '/Volumes/.*$'); do\n    if [ -n \"$p\" ]; then\n        find \"$p\"/*\n    fi\ndone >> filename.txt \nIFS=\"$_ifs\"\n\nThe system_profiler SPUSBDataType outputs info on the USB Bus and pipes it through grep to get /Volumes/$whatever e.g. /Volumes/USB Drive using -oE for the '/Volumes/.*$' which outputs /Volumes/ and everything after it to the end of the line, thus '/Volumes/.*$' will translate the fully qualified pathname of the mount point of any mounted USB block devices.  So whatever the USB block device is mounted as, it's assigned to $p (I picked \"p\" for path) and when used with find I added the /* after it so it would not output the dotfiles.  The if block is there to avoid any output if no USB block devices are mounted.\n\nA: Here's a variation of user3439894 solution without setting IFS or looping.\nsystem_profiler SPUSBDataType | awk -F\": \" '/Mount Point/ {printf(\"%s%c\", $2, 0)}' | xargs -0 -IX find X >outfile\n\nData is parsed from system_profiler with awk. awk prints the mount points terminated with the null character which is then piped to xargs and the results are written to outfile.\nTo exclude dot files from the output add the option ! -name (not name) and ! -path (not path) to the find command.\nsystem_profiler SPUSBDataType                       |\nawk -F\": \" '/Mount Point/ {printf(\"%s%c\", $2, 0)}'  |\nxargs -0 -IX find X ! -name '.*'  ! -path 'X/.*/*' 2>/dev/null >outfile\n\n\nA: My /Volumes dir:\n ➜  /Volumes  ls\nBOOTCAMP      Cool Stuff    Macintosh HD  Recovery HD\n\nThis command lists only files on the Recovery HD:\n➜  /Volumes  find . -type d \\( -name BOOTCAMP -o -name Cool\\ Stuff \\) -prune -o -print\n.\n./Macintosh HD\n./Recovery HD\n./Recovery HD/.fseventsd\n./Recovery HD/.fseventsd/no_log\n./Recovery HD/.metadata_never_index\n./Recovery HD/.Trashes\nfind: ./Recovery HD/.Trashes: Permission denied\n./Recovery HD/com.apple.boot.R\n./Recovery HD/com.apple.boot.R/Library\n...snip...\n\nYou can tack more drives onto that list:\n\\( -name BOOTCAMP -o -name Cool\\ Stuff -o -name Foo -o -name Bar -o -name Baz \\)\n\nFound here:\nhttp://www.theunixschool.com/2012/07/find-command-15-examples-to-exclude.html\n", "Q: Upgrade from Leopard (10.5.8) to El Capitan (10.11) without passing through Snow Leopard (10.6.8) I have an iMac(Early 2009) running Leopard (10.5.8).

Stopping at a friends house is no different than going to the store. \nKeep in mind, moving beyond Leopard, software compatibility may be an issue. I'd research that before making the jump . \n\nA: I would also simply go to the Apple store (Genius Bar) where normally they install whatever you want. But I am surprised you could run El Capitan. I have a MacBook Pro (June 2010) running 10.7.5 and the Genius bar said I can only go to Josemite. Also, keep in mind that basically all previous versions to Office 2016 might bring you trouble.

I can copy and paste it in terminal and it works.\nDoes automator run bash scripts differently then they would run in terminal?\n\nA: bash does expansion of $@ different than all other environment variables to preserve white space etc in arguments. From bash(1):\n@ Expands  to  the  positional  parameters,  starting from one.  When the expansion occurs\n  within double quotes, each parameter expands to a  separate  word.   That  is,  \"$@\"  is\n  equivalent  to  \"$1\"  \"$2\" ...  If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the\n  expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the original word,\n  and  the  expansion  of  the last parameter is joined with the last part of the original\n  word.

Does Apple have a policy regarding how long they will continue to release and support security fixes for each iOS release?\nI observe that many people complain about performance issues with iOS upgrades on their relatively \"old\" Apple devices. Therefore, before buying, I would like to foresee how long my device will be provided with security updates by Apple for its default iOS version.\nI specifically wonder the date of end of security support for iOS 6 (its latest sub-version, probably 6.1.3).\nEdit in 2019: I have came across a graphic showing Apple's support for older devices. This is not specifically about security updates, but still I think it is relevant and interesting.\n\n\nA: Apple released security fixes for iOS 9 & 10 on July 22, 2019.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201222\n\n  \n*\n  \n*iOS 10.3.4 for iPhone 5, iPad (4th generation) Wi-Fi + Cellular\n  \n*iOS 9.3.6 for iPhone 4s, iPad mini (1st generation) Wi-Fi + Cellular, iPad 2 Wi-Fi + Cellular, iPad (3rd generation) Wi-Fi + Cellular\n\nApple hasn't announced a security update policy, but owners of older iPhones should have some peace-of-mind on this.\n\nA: Update October 2021\nApple is currently maintaining iOS 14 with security fixes.\niOS 15: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212788\niOS 14: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211808\n–––\nOriginal Answer\nUnlike for Mac OS X, Apple does not release \"Security Updates\" for previous versions of iOS after the next major version has been released, unless it is an extremely major vulnerability. Simply put, you are required to upgrade to the newest version if you want all security fixes.\nAs an example, once iOS 10 is presumably released later in 2016, there should be no expectation of security fixes for iOS 9 (whatever the last version will be).\nFor iOS 6 specifically, the last general release was iOS 6.1.3. iOS 6.1.4 and 6.1.5 were specific bug fixes for certain devices. iOS 6.1.6 was released in February 2014, to provide a security fix (goto fail) for iPhone 3GS and iPod touch (4th generation) devices. That was well into the support period of iOS 7, and was only released due to the severity of the issue.\nOther than iOS 6.1.6, there have been no security updates issued for old versions of iOS after a newer major version has been released.\nReferences: Apple Security Updates, iOS Version History\n", "Q: Command+TAB (⌘⇥) to switch to most recent window (even on different space) The default behaviour of ⌘⇥ is roughly the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to the most recently used app.\n\n*Bring all windows of that application (in the current space) to the foreground.\n\n*Give the most recent window focus.\n\n*Is there no window of that app on the current space? Switch to most recent used space with that app.\n\n\nSay I have two windows of the same application open. One is running full screen in a separate Space, while the other is on the Desktop Space with other application windows. Take for example the following spaces:\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop: Safari + Mail Window  1\n\n*Full Screen: Mail Window 2\n\n\nSo now I'm working in Mail Window 2 (Space 2), ⌘⇥ brings me to Safari (Space 1). However ⌘⇥ again and I'm taken to Mail Window 1 (Space 1), whereas I would've wanted to go back to Mail Window 2 (Space 2). In order to go back to Mail Window 2 by keyboard, I have to go through all spaces using ⌃→ or ⌃1..⌃9, which is cumbersome when working with more than 2 spaces.\nIs there a keyboard shortcut I'm missing, or a way to change how ⌘⇥ could work for my use case?\n\nA: There is the default shortcut ⌘` (that's a backtick [or ⌘` for QWERTZ keyboard layouts] to toggle focus between application windows.\nI don't think it's possible to adjust the behaviour of ⌘⇥ so it meets your criteria. \n", "Q: Check iPhone factory information This is my first question here. I am going to buy a new iPhone 6s and got confused. In my country we do not have any Apple authorised seller. So I have to buy from any mobile shop. I searched Google but not found exactly what I look for. Here is my simple question:\nHow can I see factory information of my iPhone?\nAs some criminals may buy a locked iPhone from Apple cheaply and illegally unlock it, then tell me that it is an original unlocked iPhone. I heard of some techniques of unlocking that we can do everything after illegally unlocking. This is why I want to see original data by serial/IMEI so that I can be sure that the iPhone was sold unlocked from Apple.\n\nA: Apple doesn't provide any carrier unlock status. You need to be vigilant and protect yourself from a buyer by using an escrow agent or other payment arrangement / pre-sale inspection. Furthermore, the original Serial Number and IMEI can be unreliable if there was a service event, error in several databases, etc... It's better to have in writing what you are purchasing and the ability to return the goods if you can't inspect them before you pay.\nAs for iCloud activation lock, Apple has a nice page to check that before you commit to a potential purchase:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201365\nScroll down to the section titled \"How do I check for Activation Lock before purchasing a used device?\" and the link for that is:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://icloud.com/activationlock\nYou need to contact a cellular carrier to clear the IMEI so I would expect that the carrier you will be paying for service would help you out unless they make their money selling hardware and you are cutting them out of their compensation by buying a used device.\n", "Q: How to accept incoming network connections in OS X 10.11 El Capitan?

I then deleted the\noriginal Protected counterpart. This was partially successful but…\n\n*I have 230 tracks that, unfortunately, do not have an iCloud match.\nAs a workaround, I set up a playlist called \"DRM\" and then sorted my \nmusic library according to \"kind\" as a means to group the Protected    files. I added all the Protected audio files to the DRM playlist. I\nthen burned those to a DVD and imported the songs back to iTunes\n11.4. A \"Get Info\" on the files indicates that they are still protected. Did I do something wrong?\n\n*Apparently there is an iTunes Plus membership option. If I click\n\"match\" from within iTunes I only see a prompt to sign up for $24.99\nper year but I have been unable to determine what, if anything, will\nactually be matched. Should I be able to tell in advance of signing\nup how many of my DRM-protected songs will be replaced with Purchased\ncopies if I join iTunes Plus?\nWhen clicking a Protected audio track in my music library to reveal it in the iTunes store I note that I don't always see a \"Play\" button to indicate that Apple still has the track associated with my purchase history. My best guess is that most of the tracks that were purchased back when DRM restrictions were the norm are the old lower cost versions, whereas primarily $1.29 versions are available as a download at present. If my guess is correct, Apple doesn't link back prior forms of tracks they have since upgraded. Can Apple remedy this in any way? (I tried contacting Apple/iTunes customer support via email but their web contact form kept producing an error so I don't know if Apple can fix the issue, either. I also tried participating in the community forum to ask this question but by topic failed to post there, too. :-(\nI am not a high volume iTunes buyer. However, that also means that 230 songs out of my purchase history with Apple represents a significant chunk of my digital download library. Are there any workarounds?\nThanks!\n\nA: Burning files with DRM on them to CD effectively removes the DRM, but you must make sure you are indeed burning an audio CD and not a CD filled with audio files.\nI think you may have missed a step in re-importing your burned music back into iTunes: delete the songs you just burned to CD.\nMake sure the song or any version of it is no loner in your purchased list or anywhere on your computer. Now when you import the song iTunes will not use the purchased version with DRM on it as the authoritative version.\n", "Q: Apple Watch notifications over WiFi First days after I've bought my Apple Watch, keeping my iPhone with Bluetooth turned off and WiFi on (so with Apple Watch connected \"to the cloud\") my Watch was able to receive iPhone's notifications as it was connected with bluetooth.\nNow this \"feature\" died, so if I have my iPhone with Bluetooth turned off and WiFi on and my Apple Watch connected to the cloud, Watch don't receive any notifications; is there a way to restore this \"feature\"?\nEDIT: This morning works!! Here's an example:\n\niPhone connected only to WiFi and W connected to the Cloud.\n\n........ W Receives iPhone's notification!\n\nA: I've found a solution which (more or less) works!\nEvery night, before going to sleep I turn off my W (I've never understood what's the correct mode to keep it during the night!) and in plane mode my iPhone. When I wake up I turn on my Watch and plug the phone to WiFi until I go out. To receive iPhone's notifications in this condition I have to turn on bluetooth until phone and watch plug, then turning off bluetooth, Watch will keep receiving notifications (sometimes it doesn't work at first time!). So, probably, everytime Watch turns on needs to \"recognise\" his phone, then it can keep finding them even over WiFi.\nEDIT: With Watch OS3, bluetooth pairing seems not necessary: just turning the Watch on, on the same WiFi of the iPhone, it receive phone's notifications!\n\nA: Apple Watch connects to Wi-Fi networks it has connected whilst being linked via Bluetooth with your iPhone. See: About Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on Apple Watch \nSo, let's say you forget your phone at home but you're wearing your watch at work. Your watch will recognize the wifi network and still give you your notifications over Wi-Fi. \nYou might also need to mirror notifications. See: About notifications on your Apple Watch\n\nA: Watch only produces notifications with a Bluetooth connection to your iPhone. \n", "Q: Mac: change Finder shortcuts I want to reassign  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   F  to a custom command, but Finder reserves it to open 'All My Files'.\nI have looked around Preferences-Keyboard-Shortcuts, but the Finder shortcuts do not seem to be listed, so I cannot remove them.\nIs there any way to remove the Finder shortcuts so I can assign them to what I want?\nMany thanks,\nWill.\n\nA: You first have to assign 'All My Files' to something else [choose some complicated junk you'll never need]\nYou cannot remove a default, only reassign it.\nThen you can add your chosen alternative with  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   F  .\nI used Documents to demonstrate, as it was just below\n\nSystem Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts.\nFinder [in fact no app] will not exist as a listed app until after you make the first shortcut for it.\nTo set up the first one, click + then select Finder from the drop menu; add your menu title, \"All My Files\" then your 'junk' key command.\nAfter that, selecting the 'Finder' header from the list will auto-populate the app drop menu, making subsequent entries quicker.\n", "Q: Does my company's DUNS number need to be active to renew my Developer Program Membership? I need to renew my Apple's Developer Program Membership. But my D-U-N-S number (which was required to enrol in the program the first time) has expired.\nBut it is too expensive, and it is useful for absolutely nothing. So, will Apple check it again in my renew? Do I really need to keep it active?\n\nA: While Apple does check your DUNS number at registration, it does not need to be active to continue the membership.\nI know a company who had their DUNS number expire several years ago but they have still successfully renewed their membership.\n\nA: You don't need to pay Dunn & Broadstreet anything - your legal entity just has to be listed when/if Apple checks to verify.\nI doubt you'll have issues if you are renewing, so I would dump the paid plan and work out any concerns with Apple developer relations if and when they have any problem with your account.\n", "Q: Fresh install after CPU upgrade When installing a program on a Mac does the installer consider processor speed and number of cores in order to tailor the programs performance, and if so will upgrading processor architecture from single to dual CPUs require reinstalling the program for improved performance. \nI'm having trouble with the alignment or synchronization of sound and the visual feedback from the GUI in Apple's Logic Pro 10.2, when running more than 8 processing threads, which, now that I've installed two six core 3.46 GHz Intel Xeon 5690, is a meager count considering the 24 possible threads possible with hyperthreading. \n\nA: To fix that you will probably have to reinstall Mac OS X. To do that, hold the command key when you press the power button and when the system starts up, click the option to re install Mac OS X. Hope this helps.\n\nA: In general, the installer won't care about the count of CPU. Even run-time, most programs won't check on the number of CPU and instead just make threads and throw it at the kernel for execution.\nSoftware can certainly query the system on timing and Logic and other audio processing apps certainly do - but you might have made things worse if that program is hard coded to detect specific CPU types and doesn't see yours listed, so it assumes it's running on a less capable Mac.\nI would start with documenting the basics from the command line to make sure the OS is seeing the correct lineup of CPU.\nsysctl -a|grep ^hw|grep cpu\nsystem_profiler SPHardwareDataType\n\nIf that matches, then you have a vendor support issue in Logic (or perhaps someone has patched the program to take better advantage of CPU upgrades). The OS itself doesn't make many decisions at install time, instead it polls the hardware at boot time, so you could power off the hardware, reset the NVRAM and then give the OS a clean look at what's installed and make sure the above output matches your expectations.\n", "Q: Automatically convert a file whenever it is saved? Is it possible to automatically convert a file to another format every time it is saved?\nSome context:  I have a Numbers file which needs to be converted to csv for processing by various shell scripts.  At the moment I have to manually \"Export to CSV\" each time I edit the file, which I don't always remember.\nThe ideal solution would be to automatically trigger the \"Export..\" action every time the file is saved.  Is there any way to do this?  I would prefer a folder action, because I have a few different Numbers files with same problem.\nJust to be clear:  the problem is how to trigger the conversion.\nI'm using Numbers 3.2.2 on Mac OS X 10.9.5\n\nA: Yes, OS X has built in automation with Applescript and folder actions.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.macworld.com/article/1167157/automate_tasks_with_folder_actions.html\n\n*http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2012/06/folder-actions-tutorial-automation-meet-the-filesystem/\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptLangGuide/reference/ASLR_folder_actions.html\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/InterapplicationCommunication/RN-JavaScriptForAutomation/index.html\n\n*http://macosxautomation.com\nSo, following the first link from MacWorld you can make a folder on your desktop that pops up an alert when you save your file. From there, you would make a different folder with a different script to attempt to convert the file. Lastly, make a script to clean up the file that's converted and move the processed file to the proper place.\nI would instead make a service to just convert the file in place, but you can't trigger a service as easily as you can trigger a folder based workflow where actions initiate the processing.\n", "Q: How to install uBlock Origin for Safari? Is there any way to install uBlock Origin on Safari?\nI'm currently using macOS 10.11.2 with Safari 9.0.2 on a 2012 MacBook Pro.\n\nA: Now there is, thanks to a new fork of uBlock Origin for Safari by el1t. As of writing, as it's still in alpha, you will need to download the extension from GitHub and then install it by clicking on the downloaded file.\n\nA: It's past 2021, and uBlock Origin is crippled and no longer available for Safari. However, a new browser built on the same technologies as Safari (Webkit), called the Orion browser, is now under development for both macOS and ios. And it has built-in support for uBlock Origin (and many other popular extensions). A beta version of the browser is now available and can be downloaded from here - Orion Browser. (It, unfortunately, is the only option currently for those who want all the features of Safari with uBlock Origin too).\n\nA: Nope, but you can install uBlock. Unfortunately, it seems like its development has stalled recently, but it still works for the most part.\n\nA: As of Safari 12.0, with the switch from the Extension Gallery to the Safari Extensions, uBlock Origin is no longer officially supported. You can read a more detailed discussion of the situation here: Safari 12 compatible versions of ad blockers fail to block many ads\nThere is, at least for now, an officially supported workaround on the uBlock-Safari Github page:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clone uBlock-Safari and uAssets into the same parent directory\n\n*Build by running ./tools/make-safari.sh in uBlock-Safari's directory\n3.Install the unpacked extension through Safari's Extension Builder\n\n\n*\n\n*Show the Develop menu in Safari by going to Preferences > Advanced and checking Show Develop menu in menu bar\n\n*In Safari, load the Extension Builder (Develop > Show Extension Builder)\n\n*Click the + button in the bottom left corner and \"Add Extension\"\n\n*Select dist/build/uBlock0.safariextension\n\n*Click install and enter your password\n\n\n\nYou will have to repeat step 3 each time you restart Safari, but your settings will be saved, so it's only a few extra clicks.\nIt's impossible to know how long Apple will allow this to work, but for for now it seems to be the least bad option (and much better than using uBlock which is  shady and unrelated to uBlock Origin)\n\nA: 2019 Update: uBlock Origin is no longer available as of Safari 13.\nMore detail can be found in this GitHub Issue:\n\nuBO will no longer [work] with Safari, use Firefox or a new \"content blocker\" app.\n\n\n2018 Update\nuBlock-Safari Installation:\n\nThe preferred method of installation is to install from the extension\n  gallery.

The process of making the bootable USB-stick is pretty self explanatory once you start the program.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Permission denied to create tree directory - El Capitan Following this tutorial , under the subtitle \n\nDownload angular-phonecat\n\nSince there is a local server comes packages with El Capitan, and I have an ios emulator installed to run some web app while developing, my best \"guess\" is that I need to place my WebApp projects where the server limits me to\nWhile running as a user, I need to git clone a dir tree in a folder which belongs to the admin.\nAs requested by a commenter to show the full path of the destination folder:  \nThe destination folder where the tree will be copied to is:\nMacintosh HD/Library/WebServer/Documents/\n\nIn the terminal, If the destination folder gives rwx to the admin then why \"permission denied\" is returned?\nI don't want to add the user to the sodoers file and do not want to logout and login as an admin as the command I copied form a web page unto the clipboard will be lost.

Imaginary IPs for the purpose of explanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*My web server is on my LAN at 192.168.10.100\n\n*My WAN static IP is 200.100.50.25\nExternally, DNS is not set up so that some name resolves to 200.100.50.25. Nor will it be. So you can't get there the usual way.\nSo, I provide URLs to my beta testers in this form:\nhttp://200.100.50.25/mybetadocs/webpage.html\n\nThis works fine. My testers out in the world can get to my server and all is good. For them.\nHere's the problem: on my machine, if I try to get to that URL, for instance, when I click on a  link on a web page that contains it,  my machine tells the router to NAT to 200.100.50.25, and that's the end of that - it goes nowhere.\nThe router does not appear to have any loopback capability to let it know that indeed, 200.100.50.25 is, in fact, on my LAN (although frankly, I think it should know that already, since that's its external IP and that's where I'm trying to get to. It used to work fine on my old router. But anyway.)\nSo what I'm looking for is a way to tell OS X here on my local machine that when I reach out to 200.100.50.25, I'm actually trying to reach 192.168.10.100 so that my web server will respond to me here on my machine, directly via the LAN.\n\nSimply put, on my machine only, I need the following,...\nhttp://200.100.50.25/mybetadocs/webpage.html\n\n...to reach here:\nhttp://192.168.10.100/mybetadocs/webpage.html\n\n\nPreviously, I had my users set up a hosts file entry for an imaginary servername of the form someweirdname.com, like this...\n200.100.50.25 someweirdname.com\n\n...and then put all my links up in the form...\nhttp://someweirdname.com/mybetadocs/webpage.html\n\n...which actually works fine, but ran into a fairly severe user problem where setting up a hosts file was completely beyond them, hence no access to the docs.\nUsing the IP requires nothing of the user but clicking the link, and as I said, it works fine for them. But it locks me out, which is highly inconvenient for me - I can't follow URLs out on other web servers back  to various places in my beta docs without dragging out my cellphone, turning off its access to  wifi, and going after those links via 4G so my router sees the request coming in from outside the LAN.\nWhen I'm just reading my docs here, I just use someweirdname.com to get to them, and it's all relative from there, and that works fine too.\nI just can't to them from other server's web pages out on the net. And for... reasons... I need to test those URLs to make sure they go where they are supposed to go.\nIs there a solution for this conundrum that doesn't involve buying yet another servername, costing me yet more money to expose my local beta docs, and dealing with the resulting DNS maintainance churn?\nI can live with it as it is, and have been, but I hate it.\n\nA: Arpanet: At Work Since 1969 - editing your own hosts file is the method of choice.\n##\n# Host Database\n#\n# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface\n# when the system is booting.

At that point, you should be able to hit your public IP from outside and port forwarding will work the way you want it to.\n", "Q: Macbook Retina 15\" camera - hardware, firmware or software issue? When I try to use camera on my macbook in photo booth / skype there's no image coming from it. Camera's LED blinks (with approx 1 second interval). \nHow do I fix that or confirm that's a hardware related problem?\nAnything else I should try aside PMU and SMC reset? \n\nA: The green LED is hardwired to the camera. If the green light is on, the camera is on. If the green light is off, the camera is off. So, I believe your camera is turning on and off, on and off, on and off…\nThere are a couple other things you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try a different user account: if you have another user account on your MacBook, log in to it and try to use the camera. If not, first create a new user account via the System Preferences. If the camera works in the alternate user account, then you can safely say that something with your account's settings aren't quite right.\n\n*Determine whether your MacBook properly recognizes the camera: Check System Profiler (in the Utilities folder, inside the Applications folder). Under the USB header, check to see if the iSight camera is detected.\n\n\n(I found these troubleshooting steps on Apple's Support Website:\nHow to Troubleshoot iSight.)\nIf these don't help, then it's probably a hardware issue: you'll need to take your MacBook to a local Apple Store Genius Bar (or other authorized Apple Service Provider) for further help.\n\nA: The simplest way to confirm a hardware problem is to boot your machine using a different startup disk and testing the issue in question.\nTo do so you would require an external HD or USB drive, with an OS installed on it, preferably Mac OS.  Simply connect such external media to your machine via USB or Firewire and boot up the computer while holding down the 'Option' key.  \nCreating bootable USB:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372\nChanging your Startup Disk:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204417\n", "Q: Is it safe to use my Indian MacBook Pro charger in America using a simple adapter? \nI am using a local adapter to use my Indian MacBook charger in the US.

I'll try to tell you the story as short as possible. \nMy MacBook was encrypted and I decided to dual boot Arch Linux on it. It was a bad idea because while partitioning the drive I made my OS X boot unreadable. \nI spent hours and hours trying to fix it and it seemed like I had found a solution.

Background:  We have a lab of Macintosh computers, all running 10.10.3 currently, that are for classroom instruction.  Students typically use their own login/password via Active Directory to log in to these machines, however guest(anonymous) access is also available.  Traditionally we have never previously allowed students to open/use Terminal.app as the room was used primarily for art, but recently the machines are being used for science and instructors have requested CLI access.  Students are not admins and would not be able to use sudo.\nIs it safe to remove the restriction preventing students from opening Terminal.app and allow students full access to the bash shell?  Are we being over cautious? If not, what types of risks would we be exposed to/need to address prior to allowing such access?\n\nA: It's important to realize that students already have other avenues of access to the bash (and other) shells. Students can download alternate terminal programs—such as iTerm—to their home directories to gain shell/CLI access. Additionally, shell scripts can be run via Automator.app.\nSo, especially for enterprising students, blocking the default Terminal.app hasn't bought you much from a security standpoint.\nReally, whether CLI access is appropriate comes down to the intact permissions across the filesystem combined with appropriate user account settings. If the students are running as standard or managed (non-admin) accounts and filesystem permissions are intact, then that's what limits student access. Non-admin accounts shouldn't be able to run root-level tools and modify root-level configuration files.\n", "Q: How do you delete applications which are stored in your system preferences?

Is there a way to get notifications at both places?\n\nA: Nope. AFAIK, at least as an Apple Watch owner, if you have an Apple Watch paired then you will receive all notifications on it. I don't believe that there is a way to change so that you receive notifications on the Watch and in Notification Center on your iPhone at the same time.\n", "Q: Can having a MBP constantly charging damage the battery? I constantly have my MBP connected to its charger. I was curious though, can this affect the battery? If the battery is always at 100% and power is constantly being fed into it, does this damage the battery? Because right now my trackpad is bulging same with the lower body of the MBP and it's because of the battery expanding. So I was curious if the constant charge may have deformed the battery.\nThank you\n\nA: Constant charging should not damage the battery in an extreme manner. Yes, you would get more life from it if you would let it always cycle between 40 and 80%, but the Mac is already cycling power in the high 90s even though it is not showing it to you. I have not been cautious at all with by 2009 Macbook Pro and I can still get around 2 hours of autonomy from it.\nHowever, a bulging battery is a very different scenario.

I get the spinning beach ball and i can't click on anything (although the mouse moves just fine). \nI know this question has been asked a few different ways in the past. Let's assume that I've run a system diagnostic and everything is fine, and that I prefer not to blow away my OS and I that I would like to avoid re-installing the OS. \nSince I'm not sure which program is causing the lock, where would I begin troubleshooting? The console logs are somewhat meaningless unless I know what to look for. Are there any specific things that occur during a lock -- or rather following a hard restart? The only thing I could come up with is \"BOOT TIME\". \nMy initial thought was that this was being caused by Chrome -- or something within Chrome since it was most active. I quickly checked the logs for BOOT TIME and I found a ton of these: \n 1/13/16 2:42:06.000 AM kernel[0]: Google Chrome He[529] triggered unnest of      range 0x7fff8a200000->0x7fff8a400000 of DYLD shared region in VM map 0xc0151441ee6bac9d.

It might take 5 minutes, but that lets you take actionable data to Apple or Google if you can show a repeated hang.

I have also seen it using the -w flag. In any case, in recent updates, I think around El Capitan or Yosemite, you instead get a message \n\nOperation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged\n\nSystem Integrity Protection is also known by the acronym SIP. To disable it you need to boot into the Recovery OS and run csrutil disable.\nI have done this sequence in previous releases and it did lead to being able to disable gamed via the launchctl command.\nI suppose that after gamed is disabled, one could re-enable SIP. Maybe that would be the best of both worlds, although it is a tedious process all in all.\n\nA: One solution is to create a bash script to stop the gamed service after you login. Use Automator in OS X to create a bash script then add it as a Login Item to your OS X account. The next time you login you should receive a prompt to execute the script. Normally I wait until I see an alert from Little Snitch that gamed is phoning home then I click 'Continue' to run the script. This has not been perfected and you may encounter issues if you run it immediately after you login to OS X. \nI prefer to stay away from the solutions that disable the service as those require disabling/overriding SIP which I advise against.\nHere is the bash script I use. Any suggestions on improving it are welcome.\n    #!/bin/bash\n        chkService=gamed\n        chkCount=10\n        chkStatus=$(ps ax | grep \"$chkService\" | grep -v grep | grep \" T \" | wc -l)\n        while [ $chkStatus -ne 1 ]; do\n            chkProcess=$(ps ax | grep -v grep | grep \"$chkService\" | wc -l)\n            if [ $chkProcess -ne 0 ];\n            then\n                KILLALL -STOP \"$chkService\"\n                chkCount=0\n                chkStatus=$(ps ax | grep gamed | grep -v grep | grep \" T \" | wc -l)\n            else\n                SLEEP=1\n                chkCount=$((chkCount-1))\n            fi\n        done\n\n\nA: Disable the LaunchAgent (not LaunchDaemons) and reboot your machine (without sudo):\n$ launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.gamed.plist\n\nIn case you want to enable it again at one point:\n$ launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.gamed.plist\n\n\nA: According to this thread you can do:\ndefaults write com.apple.gamed Disabled -bool true\n\nAnd to check the current state of the daemon use:\ndefaults read com.apple.gamed Disabled\n\n\nA: what about sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/Launch\\ Daemons/com.apple.gamed.plist ?\n\nA: on OS Sierra go to System Settings, Internet Accounts and delete (with the minus) the Game Center on the list (left side).\n\nA: This makes little to no difference from a security standpoint as it simply reverts a system back to exactly ho wit worked prior to SIP, and exactly how almost all Unix systems still work. The value of SIP is at best debateable.\nIt addresses the question because only way to use the Launchctl command to unload the gamed plist file is to first disable SIP, boot, unload the plist file, and then, if desired, reenable SIP.\n\nA: Another option that works on 10.11.6 is a variation on the method suggested by @Le-Sci. Create a shell script that disables the gamed process:\n#!/bin/bash\nsleep 30 && kill -9 \"$(pgrep gamed)\"\n\nThe sleep command here tells the script to wait 30 seconds before starting the process of quitting gamed, to give the system enough time to have loaded gamed before trying to terminate it; you can adjust the amount of time to wait as necessary. The \"kill -9\" command force-quits the process you request, but it only accepts a process id number, not a process name, so \"pgrep\" is used to look up the process id. Make a note of where you save the script (for this example, I will save it as \"forceQuitGamed\" in /Users/myaccountname/ ).\nGive the script execution permission:\nsudo chmod +x ~/forceQuitGamed\n\nCreate a launch agent plist file that will run each time you login to your account. If you have not created a plist file before, one way you can do this is with TextEdit. The script file must be saved in plain text, so if your default preferences for TextEdit call for Rich Text formatting, do a Format>Make Plain Text command to convert to plain text before trying to use the new launch agent plist file.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.myaccountname.loginscript</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Users/myaccountname/forceQuitGamed</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThe string in the array under \"ProgramArguments\" is the path/to/your/shell script.\nSave the file to ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ . In this example, I named the plist file com.myaccountname.forceQuitGamed.plist, so it is found at\n/Users/myaccountname/Library/LaunchAgents/com.myaccountname.forceQuitGamed.plist\n\nNow each time that you login to your account, gamed should be force-quit just a few seconds after it has loaded. (If you need it to be terminated as soon as possible after it is loaded, look at @Le-Sci's method.) This approach works without needing to disable System Integrity Protection.\n\nA: You have to first enter csrutil disable in Terminal when in Recovery Mode, then restart make changes, restart again in Recovery Mode and do csrutil enable, restart.\nBut I do not know which processes when modified will compromise boot in El Capitan\n", "Q: Prohibited sign - Can't boot after trying to open Raspian SD Card So I was following this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo4HphBdR10 and opened the folder of the SD Card. The Screen went black and I rebooted.\nNow I get a Prohibited Sign on boot up.\nIn the Recovery mode (cmd + options + r) I see that my Macintosh HD is unmounted and repairing sais that something is wrong with the Disk.\nI can't reinstall because the installer isn't finding any Disks.\nWhat should I do ?\n\nA: Oh, drat! Sorry to say you most likely lost it all.\nThis is the exact reason NO one should just follow any random video on the Web. To explain what I am saying, there is a high probability you used diskutil improperly with the wrong disk identifier (your Startup Disk rather than the intended target) and as root, which most likely overwrote Mac OS X with Raspbian without mercy. What is odd about that, however, is that Recovery does work.\nFor future reference, let me give you a better way to write Apple supported images. Open Disk Utility and click your flash drive. Go to the Restore tab and drag the image in the source box. In Yosemite and later, go to Edit > Restore and browse for the image you intend to restore instead. Restore. But, our problem is this won't work for Raspbian, as it's a Gnu/Linux flavor, not the standard Apple dmg. So we will need Terminal. \nBut first, a few notes: Whatever you decide to do things using Terminal, be very careful (especially as root, and that goes for all UNIX (and *nix-like systems!) The sad part is that the guy in the video was close, but didn't do a god job of clarifying the inherent danger in blindly writing an image with all powers. ALWAYS back up first before running a dangerous command.\nNow, as for the method. If you're new to all this, I would avoid playing in diskutil. Instead, use mount with no arguments to find your disk identifier. You'll note your hard disk also has an identifier, which for example could be /dev/disk0. If you know the name of your flash drive, that's even better as we can filter that right out and ensure we have the right one. So, if your flash drive or card's name is example, we can run mount | grep example to filter what we want. So, now, if it's disk3, you'll see /dev/disk3s1 and example all nicely listed and filtered out, being automounted for us under Volumes.\nOnce you are absolutely certain what the identifier (or ending number) is for your flash drive, go ahead and type if= and drag the image, so it pastes the path into the Terminal from the Finder. Now apply our previous finding and add of= (output file). Again, if mount or Disk Utility gave you /dev/disk3s1 for example as the flash drive, /dev/disk3 is what we need (we want the root of the drive, not the ending s# which stand for partitions in this scenario). But, this could be different on your system (check first!). In our example here, the completed command might look something like this: dd if=/Users/me/Downloads/2015-11-21-raspbian-jessie-lite.img of=/dev/disk3. Or, let's give an alternate example where it was disk5 and we went to the right directory (like, say, Downloads), we could then autocomplete with tab, add the if, and do this: dd if=2015-11-21-raspbian-jessie-lite.img of=/dev/disk5\nBut in either case, back up first. Be careful. Do great.\nNow, the pressing and more challenging question is how to get your data back. You already discovered your startup disk is gone. First, try restoring from a Time Machine backup (assuming you wisely had this set up). If not, try writing a Linux Mint image (I would say Fedora, but dracut sometimes hangs on live USB in my experience since R19) using a Mac with the example above, or another UNIX (or like) system (though there will be some differences; you will probably see /dev/sd# or mmcblk# for some cards on modern Gnu/Linux flavors, for instance). Or, download win32imagewriter for Windows XP SP2 or later and use that with Administrator rights (again, watch for the drive identifier first; in this case, the letter!) Assuming you have Mint booted, run parted (if it is not available, connect to a network, sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install parted -y. What we are hoping for is that the table is still somewhat intact. Do sudo -s to elevate then run parted -s -l. You should see /dev/sda or whatever your hard drive is.\nIf you have a valid GPT table and you don't get any warnings about that, continue. If not, skip this paragraph. In the case of sda, I'd do parted /dev/sda. Now, from what you observed earlier, look for the end of any preceding partitions (most likely where EFI sat). Now, assuming a default El Capitan setup, or anything past Lion, this should be 209.7 MB. The start should therefore round close to that point (if the GPT isn't too awful corrupted, parted should warn you if your query does not match and try to readjust). For the end point, where does Recovery start (usually volume 3?) For instance, on my 160 GB disk, it is after 42.6 Gb. This is our end point. With an insane amount of luck, try putting a start and end for rescue, such as rescue 210M 42.6GB and see what happens. If this failed, even with an adjustment, you could try fdisk. The problem, though, is that this is generally for undoing changes before a reboot that are still fresh; this is only a long shot.\nIf you didn't back up anything, you're not entirely out of luck just yet. From a NetBoot, FireWire, USB 3, or Lightning external startup disk (I.e. that has OS X on it), you can still use recovery tools such as Recuva for Mac, Prosoft DataRescue, or DiskWarrior to try to salvage whatever you can. Raspbian most likely overwrote some of those files good, but if you have the extra time and cash, it'll be worth it.\nIf all else fails, or if the table is corrupt, your best bet would be to forget about Recovery (since its on the same disk) and reinstall entirely. Ideally, you'll need to either own or borrow another Mac for this next step. Download 10.11, close the Install OS X pop up window that appears, and use createinstallmedia from inside the OS X installer application bundle/package per the instructions from Apple (there is a guide for this). Power down your Mac, hold Option, and boot from the disk. You'll then need to go to Disk Utility and create a new Intel or GUID partition table (GPT). Create a new partition for your data and the OS; OS X should do the rest when it installs. Close Disk Utility and install as usual. Restore whatever you had backed up.\nIn any case, I'm hoping all this is unnecessary and that you had Time Machine, iCloud, or another backup system working for you. Good luck with it all. Careful with root commands in the future. Hope this helps!\n\nA: Instead of /dev/diskX use /dev/rdiskX (for instance /dev/rdisk2) and add bs=1m (blocksize = 1MB) to the end of the command for much better write performance.\ndd if=./your-raspian-image-file of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=1m\n", "Q: Can't recover account because forgot email I lost my Game Center account password...

This is quite surprising to me, am I missing something?\nApparently there's a brew tap that can be used instead (staticfloat/julia). Before going for that solution I wanted to know if that's supposed to be the most straightforward way to do so.\n\nA: You can install Julia using cask:\n$ brew cask install julia\n\n\n$ brew cask info julia\njulia: 0.4.2\nJulia\nhttp://julialang.org/\nNot installed\nhttps://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/julia.rb\n==> Contents\n  Julia-0.4.2.app (app)\n  Julia-0.4.2.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia (binary)\n\n\nA: To clarify,\nThe Julia installation that you get if you go to https://julialang.org/downloads/ and download Julia 1.6.3 dmg for Mac is exactly the same as the installation that Homebrew's Cask currently gets, which is evidenced here: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/julia.rb\nHowever,\nJulia behaves differently once you've actually installed the Homebrew Julia 1.6.3 Cask versus the Julia 1.6.3 from https://julialang.org/downloads/. I first experienced this when trying to use PackageCompiler.jl to make a shippable application using Homebrew's Julia 1.6.3 Cask install. With this install, the app continued to fail despite all my efforts. When I switched to the Julia 1.6.3 dmg install from https://julialang.org/downloads/, the PackageCompiler app worked and was relocatable.\nSo just a heads up, these two methods install Julia differently on the system, resulting in Julia behaving differently in some cases.\n", "Q: Search text annotations in Mac Preview I've added text annotations to a pdf with Tools > Annotate > Text. I'd like to search the text for a specific word, like 'Todo'.

I tested making an annotation with a slightly nonsensical word that spotlight had zero matches for on my Mac. (at least until this text gets indexed as a safari history item)\nI tested a PDF and a PNG file with text annotations and none of the importers put that text into spotlight. I have filed a bug with Apple on that, but I would do so as well yourself. If the person screening the bug thinks it's a bug, usually one well document report gets things on the list to be fixed. If Apple considers this a feature, normally many reports asking for the same thing will be needed to change the minds that think not indexing annotations is actually beneficial to the system design.\nOn the outside, we don't know and can only file reports to change the things we want changed.\nHere are the terminal commands I used to verify the bug in case someone has a workaround or knows of a better spotlight importer for PDF/PNG that would index the annotations.\nmac:Desktop me$ mdfind ZZqwijibo\nmac:Desktop me$ strings annontation.pdf |grep qwijibo\n(ZZqwijibo) /AAPL:AKExtras 95 0 R /DA (/Helvetica 59 Tf 0.987 0.129 0.146 rg)\n(ZZqwijibo) /DA (/Helvetica 59 Tf 0.987 0.129 0.146 rg) /F 4 /Q 1 /Subtype\n\nThe text is plainly stored on the filesystem, but the PDF importer is skipping the annotation text altogether like you report.\n\nA: You can search your annotations, but you won't be able to edit them anymore. To do this, you have to export your pdf file as a pdf (file > export as pdf).\nIt's probably not the solution you were hoping for, but it's the only solution I know.\n\nA: If the export as pdf option above doesn't work, you can also hit print --> click the drop down menu at the bottom of the popup --> save as PDF --> this new document will allow all markup text boxes to be searchable.\n\nA: May be this helps: you can view all the text annotations in the inspector window.

I thought it might be possible to use the \"Start up automatically after a power failure\" in the energy system settings for this, along with the -u parameter to the shutdown command, in order to safely bring the machine in a state where I don't have to fear data loss. According to the shutdown man page, the -u parameter seems to be what I need:\n\n-u: The system is halted up until the point of removing system power, but waits before removing power for 5 minutes so that an external UPS (uninterruptible power supply) can forcibly remove power. This simulates a dirty shutdown to permit a later automatic power on. OS X uses this mode automatically with supported UPSs in emergency shutdowns.\n\nBut shutdown -hu now does not work. On both Macs I tested it with (Mac Mini with 10.10 and a Mac Pro on 10.11), the machines still power off immediately, they do not wait for five minutes in the halt state, so that I don't have the time to power off the mains. Therefore, the autostart on power failure setting doesn't trigger, and I have to manually push the power button to make them boot again.\n\nA: The NVRAM setting to power on when power returns has nothing to do with the shutdown command, so I wouldn't worry about the shutdown options and instead focus on the NVRAM settings for what to do when the machine senses a return of power.\nIf you don't have an actual UPS - I would get an internet enabled power switch like WeMo or other or just train staff to power cycle the hardware.\nThe setting to power on automatically is quite reliable in my experience, so you should only need that to recover from 95% or more of the power failure events you have. Also, kiosk machines generally just run apps and open files, so you don't have work that needs to be saved to disk. I would just let the power cut from the Mac and make sure the filesystem is journaled so that the restart is quick.\n\nIf you have an actual UPS - use the energy saver control panel to tell the OS to shut down N minutes before the power runs out and you will be well protected from data loss.\n\nHere I have a server with storage attached so I'm having the shut down scheduled 10 minutes before the battery expires.  For a kiosk, I would disable all three sliders/check boxes for UPS or get a simple UPS like APS BGE70 that lacks USB port entirely and just gives you some time when people accidentally trip the power or a substation feeder shifts and your outage is a minute or so in length.\n\nA: So in 2020 this exact scenario does work for me\n\n\n*\n\n*a 5,1 Mac Pro running 10.11, \n\n*set to \"restart after a power failure\" \n\n*ran the command sudo shutdown -hu now\n\n*machine shuts down quickly - and the power light does go off, but ..\n\n*shutting the power off and on results in the machine starting up again\n\n\nSo, either some other part of the power system stays on after the power light goes off, or the system just doesn't record this as a \"clean\" shutdown (I haven't done a full 5 minute wait test to see, but it seems to work as documented for me)\n\nA: Found a workaround for \"auto boot after power loss\" on any OS, after few H/w tests, found that \"BIOS\"(or whatever they named it in APPLE) controlled by OSX OS - basically changing this setting under Power Saving - \"Start up automatically after a power failure\" to enabled and then wipe the local HDD and install anything you want that won't affect this setting(meaning it will remain and will power the box back on after power failure), and vise versa - removing this setting via OSX will cause Mac stop \"Auto start after power failure\" running no matter what OS.\n", "Q: Create a custom terminal window is it possible to create (and put in the dock) a custom terminal window? \nWhat I mean with \"custom\":\n\n\n*\n\n*it should have a different name (eg. \"myTerminal\");\n\n*it should automatically start running a certain command (I'll ask if this is possible in another question);\n\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: Yes, create a .terminal or .command file with the settings you like. The contents can then be a normal shell script that sets up the terminal the way you like it. Classic .sh files work as well, but the icon is not as nice. Place you file in a directory of your choice and add it to the dock.\nOnce you have that part working, you can probably paste a custom icon of your choice over the file using Finder and these posts.\n\nA: Yes, at least to an extent.  You can of course change the name of 'Terminal.app' to 'myTerminal.app' and this would change the label of the shortcut on the dock.\nAlternatively you could modify the 'file-label' tag inside of ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist though I suspect this to be a temporary change since the plist values will overwrite once the app is launched.\nYour second request is much more simple to accomplish, simply enter any command you want executed when opening Terminal.app into a text file called .bash_profile inside your home directory, this file is executed every time Terminal is opened.\nI'd like to also suggest an alternative solution, it sounds like your trying to create a shell script that can be launched from the dock, create a text file with any shell scripts you wanted to execute, then remove .txt and replace with .command and you have a shell script that can execute from the Finder.\n", "Q: Saving photos from Facebook on iPad When saving photos on an iPad from Facebook, where do the photos get saved?\n\nA: Photos you have saved to your iPad, from the Facebook app or mobile web site, save into your \"Camera Roll\" album if you have not enabled iCloud Photo Library, or into the \"Photos\" tab on iCloud Photo Library (accessible on all of your devices).\n", "Q: How Do I Reset the Sharing & Permission Setting on a MacBook? \nWhen you select the \"Get Info\" option, the mac will bring up a pop-up with the various attributes of the object selected.

The file is a text file, and can be edited with a text editor (after closing the mail program).\nFor folders appearing in the wrong place, the problematic entries are as follows:\n                    <key>MailboxDisplayIndex</key>\n                    <integer>0</integer>\n\nThe value \"0\" puts the folder at the beginning, higher values go later in the list.\nIf you simply remove the two above lines for any folder appearing in the wrong place, and restart Mail, those folders will go back to being sorted alphabetically.\nSometimes the following two lines also appear in combination with the above:\n                    <key>MailboxIsManuallySorted</key>\n                    <true/>\n\nIn those cases, I changed \"true\" to \"false\".\nNow my folders are back where I want them, yay!\n\nA: Practical Solution\nKeep one Mac around with a copy of Snow Leopard. When you want to add mail folders, do it inside Mail 4.6. The folder will go into alphabetic order automatically. It will show up in the right place on all your other computers as well. I've just tested this on a large Apple Mail 4.6 archive. The 2005 Test folder is brand new and showed up in the right order.\n\nI'll try and test this functionality in the powerful and utilitarian MailMate as you may be able to add your folders there (staying in Yosemite) but doing your actual writing and reading inside Apple Mail. MailMate looks and acts a lot like a cross between Apple Mail 4.6 and Eudora (my two favorite email programs) but is still a bit different in how it manages HTML emails and even reply quotes which keeps me away from using it voluntarily on a full time basis: we are creatures of habit. On the upside, MailMate does offer Markdown.\nFrankly I'd be a lot keener to upgrade more of my five Macs past Snow Leopard if I could keep the amazing and robust Apple Mail (along with Letterbox for my very large monitors: the new two line viewing system is not nearly as good as clean columns).\nOptimistic Suggestion\nThere may be a hidden preference default write which would enable automated alphabetic sorting. I can't find one but perhaps an Apple engineer could leak one to us.\nAs examples here's some other useful default write commands for Apple Mail:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail DisableReplyAnimations -bool true\ndefaults write com.apple.mail DisableSendAnimations -bool true\n\nChange default font size and/or reset it:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail MinimumHTMLFontSize 12\ndefaults read com.apple.mail MinimumHTMLFontSize\ndefaults delete com.apple.mail MinimumHTMLFontSize\n\nTurn on and off inline image viewing:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool true\ndefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool false\n\nTurn off Mail sent sound and turn it back on:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail MailSentSoundPath dummy\ndefaults delete com.apple.mail MailSentSoundPath\n\nCopy and paste only the email address without name (this is a good one which I run by default on all my Macs:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail AddressesIncludeNameOnPasteboard -bool false\ndefaults write com.apple.mail AddressesIncludeNameOnPasteboard -bool true\n\n\nA: Have you tried just dragging the folders to rearrange them in the order you want? This works for me under Yosemite & Mail 8.2. Give it a try!\n", "Q: Huge Apple Mail Logs (Connection Logging Enabled) I was doing some routine cleanup of my HDD, when I noticed some huge log files in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Logs/Mail.\nWhere do I toggle those log files off and on?\n\nA: In the Window menu, there is the Connection Doctor, which has a checkbox, showing the toggle to enable / disable logging.\n\nYou can also see at a glance in the menubar of the main Mail window, if it is enabled:\n\n", "Q: How to remotely change iCloud settings on iPhone 5?

I am having an issue where my firewall continually turns back on, or won't turn off (I can't be sure which).\nI go into System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Firewall, unlock settings, and click 'Turn off Firewall'. It appears to work. I click the lock in the bottom left to save my settings, and then exit System Preferences. But a port scan shows none of my ports are accessible to inbound connections, still. Then I go back into firewall settings, and it shows my firewall as being on again, even though I just turned it off.\n\nWhat I have tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have searched for others having this problem, but I cannot find anything.\n\n*I also restarted my machine, but the issue persists.\n\n*Per some google results, I executed sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.alf globalstate -int 0 in terminal, but defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.alf globalstate still returns 1 (on).\n\n\n\nHow can I turn my firewall off? \nEDIT: I think this may be related to the fact that these firewall settings were set on my previous Macbook Pro, and I have since upgraded to a newer macbook using Time Machine.\n\nA: I'm going to put a short answer on how I'd troubleshoot this since this isn't the intended behavior.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of your Mac - just in case.\n\n*Try a simple python web server in terminal.app\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer\nYou should see text like: Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ... and get a pop up like:\n\nIf you don't, perhaps delete the entire firewall preference and restart the Mac once the backup is complete.\nsudo -H mv /Library/Preferences/com.apple.alf.plist ~/Desktop\n\nThat way you can inspect/move the preference file back if desired. If you still cannot get the firewall pop up after the restart, recheck the firewall system preferences and optionally see if you might have a configuration profile that might be enforcing some firewall settings that you do not control.\n\nIf you have no profiles icon, you can probably rule that out.\n", "Q: How I can save the Skype chat history from my iPad? How I can save the Skype chat history from my ipad?\nIt does not matter in what format, for example as a text file.\nIn my ipad, I have a chat history, which is very important for me. This chat history includes several years of communication (so to copy it manually is extremely difficult, because it is impossible to select and copy a large amount of text in Skipe on an iPad, but only one message at a time). I still don't update from iOS 6.1.3, in order to avoid losing this chat history. I can not find the answer anywhere.\n\nA: It would be nice if Skype (Microsoft) synched the message history from your iDevices to your Mac where it is easily accessible, but I suspect they don't.\nIn the meanwhile you can try a trial version of something like iExplorer (https://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/) which can access most/all files created on iDevices and try to locate your Skype message history.\n", "Q: Fusion drive is not working although the system can find the SSD I own an iMac late 2013 with a fusion drive.

If you'd like to see where these icons come from (or their names which give clues on what they are associated with), you can find them in /System/Library/Extensions/IOStorageFamily.kext/Contents/Resources, or for your sidebar icons they can be found under /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources along with many other system icons.\n", "Q: How do I create an automator to forward mail?

In the first line enter the email from the certain sender that you would like to forward, then click on \"Create filter with this search\", which will bring you to the next page. Here check the \"Forward it to: choose an address\" box, and choose the address.\nThat should do it. Gmail has great filters for mails \nHope this is helpful, might not be Automator or applescript, but it's right inside gmail, fast and easy... cheers\n\nA: You could also do this with Mail rules.\nThe gmail method is better in that the forwarding happens when Mail isn't running, but you can set up a rule as follows:\n\nThe rules section is just in Mail preferences. You might try redirect instead of forward and see which \"mom\" prefers. I also added a bonus action of marking the message read - you can explore other options like filing or deleting or leaving it unread if \"dad\" wants to read these too.\n", "Q: Using Spotlight index on a file share on Server.app I have a Mac mini server (Server.app 5.0.15 on El Capitan 10.11.2), and that connects to a file share on another Mac mini, also with El Capitan 10.11.2.\nSpotlight indexes for the file shares are not available on the client, so I can't do efficient searches on the file shares.\nWhat should be done to enable file share indexes, and where:\n\n\n*\n\n*on the server El Capitan?\n\n*on Server.app?\n\n*on the client?\n\n\nI have seen lots of discussions about successful mdutil trickery, but all are with OS X before 10.11 and Server.app before 5.0.15. My research of Apple Server Help seems to be absolutely quiet about spotlight or indexing.\nWhat can I do have the Mac mini client index the share on another Mac that runs Server.app?\n\nA: It looks like mdutil can see that server search is enabled:\n$ sudo mdutil -s /Volumes/YourNetworkDrive\n  /Volumes/YourNetworkDrive:\n           Server search enabled.\n\nAlso the mdutil manpage has this information for the -p option:\n-p  Spotlight caches indexes of some network devices locally. \nThis option requests that a local caches be flushed to the\nappropriate network device.\n\nHowever, for me this does not seem to work, and it doesn't show remote search results anywhere when using SMB network mounts (This is in macOS Sierra).\nThere is one officially supported way to query remote Spotlight indexes, by using the Apple Remote Desktop application. Apple Remote Desktop is not free, but can be purchased through the Mac App Store ($79.99).\nHowever, this a separate app and it does not integrate the remote index with local Spotlight searches. It works well though.\nFrom the features page:\n\nRemote Spotlight search\nLeveraging the revolutionary Spotlight technology in OS X, the Remote\nSpotlight capability in Apple Remote Desktop can perform\nlightning-fast searches on remote client systems. Summary results for\neach client are updated instantly as results are returned. View\ndetails on results, or refine searches even further using additional\nqualifiers. Results can be viewed on remote client systems, copied\nback to your administrator system, or deleted.\n\nA screenshot from the product page:\n\n\nA: What I have just figured out about searching network volumes is that Spotlight search and the Finder search field are not the same, and the Finder search is better — for this use case, anyway. The main ⌘SPACE Spotlight search only shows files from your computer (and dictionary entries, contacts, websites, etc), and even then it doesn't seem to search the contents of all files.\nHowever, opening a Finder window and using that search bar gets you the full power of both Spotlight's index and the indexes on network volumes. I have Synology's Universal Search indexing enabled on a bunch of my NAS folders, and a Finder search with \"Shared\" (instead of \"This Mac\") selected shows me every file in my multi-terabyte archive that contains my search string in the contents, and it shows them reasonably fast; it loads a few hundred to start, then loads 50 more results every few seconds until finished. No hangs and no beachballs (though no spinner to indicate more results coming, either).\nI know my experience isn't with macOS Server (which I gather isn't much of a thing anymore), but for anyone using with this problem with SMB volumes, I suspect that Finder search will be way more fruitful than the main Spotlight window.\n", "Q: What is Causing the Kernel Panic I've been having an issue where my computer will randomly shut down and give me the panic report saying that your computer restarted because of a problem. I took it to the apple store they ran a diagnostic, and all they did was wipe my OS. It is still having the same problem so I recently just erased my whole system in reinstalled my OS X 2 more times, and I still seem to be having the issue. I have reset the smc and nvram multiple times. I've ran the disk utility first aid multiple times. Can some interpret this for me who knows how to read panic reports to see what is causing this issue.\nCrash Log 1\nAnonymous UUID:       F09B71C3-8AB1-702D-2793-2ED9EB989AE9\n\nThu Jan 14 09:52:20

a quick check before pasting in the third :-)\nThe hardware is a retina 2012 MacBook Pro and has all software updates and EFI updates applied.\n\nA: Please keep in mind this is a guess, based on the 3 logs you provided and your description that you've wiped the OS several times without a change in issue behavior.  \nI noticed that all 3 logs show a crash when loading the same kext:\nlast loaded kext at 7766792260: com.apple.driver.AudioAUUC  1.70 (addr 0xffffff7fb02f4000, size 32768)\n\nThis may indicate an issue with audio from your motherboard, assuming your not using any external audio interface. Another potential cause is an issue with RAM.\nThe machine certainly seems to have a hardware issue of some sort.  A practial solution for most HW techs at this point, would be to install test RAM in the machine and run the machine through its paces to see if the issue can be reproduced.  Depending on the frequency of crashes this can take a few hours, or days.  Since your RAM is soldered on the logic board, that would be swapped in case of a RAM issue.\n\nA: The good news is things are crashing really quickly. It's far easier to collect the 10 to 20 logs you'll need to make an armchair guess at what's happening.\nIn the mean time, consider disconnecting all peripherals and keeping a log of what you're changing in case you can stumble upon the cause (or at least correlation.) \nI don't have much to add here that hasn't been said on another thread:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/199744/5472\nWe'll probably need to see a dozen log files (or post them somewhere like github gist) to have any chance of making progress. Apple will eventually have a better solution than \"reinstall\" the OS as that's simply one of the first things they can change before escalating the actual crash reports with data to engineering. I would contact Apple and ask them how many reports they want collected before you bring it back to them for more detailed analysis.\n\nA: I was getting the same error on my MacBookPro (same model as your's - 10,1).  Is it running hot?  Check the aluminum part of the case just above the function keys on your keyboard.  Mine was almost too hot to touch.  The crashes happened more frequently/faster when I was using dual monitors (one external via Lightening port).  The MBP screen would just go blank, the keyboard was still lit - the lights were on but nobody home.  I'd let it cool for about a half-hour and start again.  There is a known issue with the video.  Mine started crashing in mid-2014 and it sat for almost a year.  Fortunately I had a spare MacBook from my job.  Then I had a little spare time and searched for solutions to my problem.  I stumbled upon this:\nhttps://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/\nI made an appointment at local Apple store, took it in (on a Sunday afternoon).  They verified that the issues with my MacBookPro were those covered by the program, sent it to Texas for repair, and I had it back on Friday (5-day turn-around!).  After so much time not having my MacBook working, I was seriously thinking about changing course - trade iPhone for Android and get a Windows notebook - due to the poor support.  I'm still not happy about the time it took Apple to admit to the problem, but I still think Apple is the best platform for what I need.\nI backed up everything and removed confidential/proprietary docs during the small periods between crashes.  When I got it back, the hard drive had not been touched - all was just as I left it.  I think what they did was just replace the motherboard.  Even the aluminum case had not been replaced.  One note: I still have some heat issues.  I'm pretty sure the replacement motherboard was the same model I previously had (not re-engineered to fix the problem).\n", "Q: TextMate: open file windows is weird In TextMate, I have recently my open file that is become weird:\n\nNo way to come back to a normal window.\nDoes anyone know how to do?\n\nA: Try deleting the ~/Library/Preferences/com.macromates.TextMate.preview.plist file while TextMate is closed and then reopen it.\nNote: You might want to backup the file first before deleting it.\n", "Q: Bring back the OS X 10.9, Maverick, theme on 10.10, Yosemite, (UI Elements and Icons) I really hate the new OS X 10.10, Yosemite, icons and I just can't like the user interface. Is there a way to bring back the Maverick ones by patching some files.\nP.S. I already did the reduce the transparency thing but still it sucks I just want the same old one.\n\nA: Install a program called XRevert. This will change the buttons, icons, etc. Install cDock to change the dock. Use Lucida Grande as system font.\n", "Q: Automator: extract PDF text and save in current directory I've made an Automator service for extracting PDF text and saving it in the current directory, and it works reasonably well.\nIt takes one or several PDF files, extracts the text, and saves it as separate .rtfs placed in the same directory as where the original PDFs was found.\nFine, excellent, except for one small rub: what is invariably also saved alongside the other .rtfs is an empty one (zero bytes), with the name of the current directory.\nLooking at the workflow below, it seems like both variables (\"PDF\" and \"Bane\") are passed to the action \"Hent ut PDF-tekst\". Is my assumption reasonable, and in any case, how do I fix it?\n\nThe script in plain text:\non run {input, parameters}\n tell application \"System Events\"\n set thePath to POSIX path of (container of (item 1 of input))\n end tell\n return thePath\nend run\n\n\nAs an aside, Automator automatically creates a PNG representation of your workflow when you save it, and it can be easily got at by revealing the package contents.\nGenius me realized this only after a bit of faffing about with screen capture and GIMP.\n\nA: Here is the issue I ran into with the translation of \"Hent ut PDF-tekst\" in Google Translate while translating from Norwegian to English, it translated as \"Get the PDF text\" so when I typed \"Get\" in the Actions Search Box it didn't show any PDF Actions with the \"Get\" Actions that did show.  Upon further examination I found Extract PDF Text and used it.\nI was able to replicate the issue of a zero sized RTF file being created along with the one for the actual PDF file however I was not able to debug it as to why and I did try many different things. Through the Workflow it showed Bane as a Folder being the path to the selected PDF File but then converted it to the zero sized RTF along with the proper RTF file and to me it looks like a bug in Automator.\nThat said, I present a workaround that you can choose to use if no one else has an answer that resolves the issue without resorting to this workaround.\nAdd a Run Shell Script Action to the end of the list of Actions, setting Shell: /bin/bash and Pass input: as argument with the following code:\nfor f in \"$@\"; do\n    if [ ! -s \"$f\" ]; then\n        rm \"$f\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nWhich translates to: If this file does not have a size greater than zero, then delete it.\nBTW If you want to test the code first, you can temporarily replace rm \"$f\" with something like say deleting \"$f\" so you can hear what file it's going to delete. When satisfied it's going to delete the zero sized file, then put it back to rm \"$f\".\nHere is an image of my Automator Service.\n\n", "Q: Don't sync certain password with iCloud Is there any way to specify that a certain password should not be synced to iCloud?\nUse case:\n\nI am allowed to have internet only on one mac address. So I use it on my laptop, but the password is synced to iCloud and so iPad also joins the network (which it cannot use as there is mac protection). Can I restrict that password to be available only on the Mac?\n\n\nA: So if you look in the Keychain Access, there is a \"Keychain\" column, and initially your password ends up in both System and iCloud keychains. You should delete the iCloud entry, this will remove the password form the other devices, but the one with System will stay and will be used by your machine\n\n", "Q: Sync Google Keep to Apple Notes I have an Android phone with a lot of notes in Google Keep. Is there an easy way to sync all my notes to my Mac so I can add, delete, and modify notes on both devices? (I've seen some paid apps, but I'd prefer to try something free if there's a way.) Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Google provides a simple way to get Google Keep on desktop—keep.google.com. It has all of the functionality of the Android and iOS mobile versions of Google Keep, just on Mac.\nHere's a simple guide to Google Keep on all of your devices:\niPhone/iPad: Download the iOS app.\nAndroid phones and tablets: Download the Android app.\nMac/Windows: Use keep.google.com or the Google Keep Chrome Web Store app for easy offline access.\nHope this helps, let me know if you have any more questions.\n\nA: Google doesn't provide a way to have Google Keep to sync on the Mac without having to be tethered online with keep.google.com which works with any web browser supported by Mac OS. It also comes as an extension for Google Chrome ONLY. However there are 3rd Party apps that claim to sync with Google's Keep. This would mean sharing your information on someones server. Check them out in Apple's app store, just search Google Keep.\n", "Q: OS X Server & Time Machine for Active Directory Users In my setup, we have an OS X server, where the machine is bound to our Active Directory domain.  I am able to log onto the machine using AD users/credentials locally, with no problems.  However, when I configure and enable the 'Time Machine' service, I cannot seem to authenticate to the machine from my Mac.  I was wondering if there was something extra needed for the server to query AD, without having to configure local users.  Thanks!\n\nA: Ok - I feel foolish.  I found the answer within minutes of posting the question.  Here is the answer:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/24844922#24844922\nI had to enable 'File Sharing' on OS X Server as well, add an explicit folder (or drive) where the backups would go and add explicit permissions to that folder. You can allow 'everyone' to access it, but in my case, I have an AD Security group that contains all Mac users in the org.\n", "Q: Custom solar 5v iPhone charger I have a solar panel that emits 5 volts, and I would like to try to charge my iPhone with it. Should I connect the I/O wires directly behind the lightning plug, or is the big transformer block important? \nI guess the block is used to change the voltage to 5 volts so that the iPhone can handle it, but I'd like to be sure.\n\nA: Note: this will require soldering, and I'm not 100% sure this will work.\nFirst, take a lightning cable, and cut roughly 2 inches off of the cable on the usb male end. Strip the main wire down a bit, and you should probably be left with 4 mini wires. Take the red and black wires, and connect them to the I/O of the solar panel, via soldering.\nAgain, I'm not completely sure how a lightning cable works, but I believe this should work.\nHere is an example how to get this done: How to make a Solar USB charger!\n", "Q: Other IOS devices ring when my iPhone is called and I cannot turn that off How do I change other iOS devices that ring and receive messages when near my iPhone receiving calls? \n\nA: On the iPhone - go to Settings and turn off each device you wish to opt out of cals on other devices.\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings.app\n\n*Phone\n\n*Calls on Other Devices\n\n*Turn it all off or just toggle the devices you want and don't want individually.\n\n\nMessages and FaceTime work the same, and are located in settings under Phone.\n", "Q: Enable calculation history on OS X Calculator app? Is there a way to display the calculation history, like what is done in real calculators with a register tape?\n\nA: Can't believe that I didn't see this:\nWindow | Show Paper Tape (⌘T)\n", "Q: How to uninstall Corel Painter Internal Audio Driver in OS X Yosemite I had installed Corel Painter 2016 on OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 with its .pkg installer. I removed installed files from /Applications/ by dragging them to the Trash.\nToday I noticed that there is an additional item in the Output/Input Devices list at the menubar named Internal Audio Driver (Corel Painter).\nHow can i uninstall it?\n\n\n\nA: I found a post about uninstallation of this audio driver. There is a kernel extension named PainterAudioDriver.kext in /System/Library/Extensions/ that adds the audio driver to the kernel space. To ensure that the kernel extension is loaded I used kextstat:\nkextstat | grep corel\n\nThe result was:\n  131    0 0xffffff7f80fde000 0x4000     0x4000     com.corel.painter.PainterAudioDriver (1) <96 5 4 3>\n\nThen to unload the kernel extension I used kextunload that is explained here:\nsudo kextunload -b com.corel.painter.PainterAudioDriver\n\nAfter that the Internal Audio Driver (Corel Painter) is removed from both Sound menu bar and Audio MIDI Setup. To prevent the driver from loading again while rebooting the system, the kernel extension file must be removed from /System/Library/Extensions/ with this command:\nsudo rm -r /System/Library/Extensions/PainterAudioDriver.kext\n\nThe Corel Painter Internal Audio Driver is uninstalled now.\n\nA: It's probably in one of the subfolders of /Library/Audio/ but then I do not have any custom audio drivers installed... so I can not confirm that!\nIf you still have the Corel Painter .pkg file you can open it as if you were going to reinstall it and look for a menu option \"Show Files\" that will shows you a complete list of every single file it would install. You can then scan through and look for /Library references to get an exact answer.\n\nA: I suspect Corel has for some reason set itself up as either an Aggregate or Multi-output  device in AudioMIDI\nApplications > Utilities > Audio MIDI Setup\n Cmd ⌘   1  to show Audio devices if it doesn't show automatically.\nIf my suspicion is correct, you will see one of the 2 circled icons, named after Corel.\nSelect, then click the - sign underneath to remove.\n\nThis won't 'break' anything. These device types are user-created & deleted. It will not allow you to delete any real device.  \nBoom2 may also have set itself up in a similar way, so make sure to get the correct one, if you wish Boom2 to continue working correctly.\nBTW, it is highly unlikely to have an actual associated driver installed, it is merely a way of 'patching' outputs for convenience, all done using Apple's own routing capabilities.\n\nA: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/223799/383276 the link here is the same answer given by Hamid...Its perfectly working so just use the commands given in the answer.\n", "Q: How to connect an iPad Air to a Panasonic TV? Is there a way to stream TV from my iPad to my Panasonic TV?\nI am a relatively new iPad user with little expertise.\n\nA: Although the OP's question is a bit light on detail, (what model of Panasonic TV?) this is general information on how to stream video from an iOS device, including the iPad Air, to a television equipped with an HDMI input.\nRequired is a Wireless Network that one has access to.  Also, the TV must have an Airplay capable device attached via HDMI that is capable of receiving streaming video from the iOS device.  For example a second generation Apple TV or newer.\nConnect to the Apple TV using AirPlay.\nAccording to Apple:\n\nAirPlay is compatible with the second-generation Apple TV or later. AirPlay Mirroring is available with iPhone 4s or later, iPad Pro, iPad Air or later, iPad 2 or later, iPad mini or later, and iPod touch (5th generation or later).\n\n\nUse AirPlay to wirelessly stream content from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch\nWith AirPlay, you can stream music, photos, and videos to your Apple TV, or stream music to your AirPort Express or AirPlay-enabled speakers. And with AirPlay Mirroring, you can display your iOS screen on your Apple TV.\nGet started\nTo use AirPlay, you need one of these devices:\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 4 or later. iPhone 4s or later for AirPlay Mirroring.\n\n*iPad, iPad mini. iPad 2 or later for AirPlay Mirroring.\n\n*iPod touch (4th generation or later). iPod touch (5th generation or later) for AirPlay Mirroring.\n\nYou can stream content to these devices:\n\n*\n\n*For photos and videos: Apple TV (2nd generation or later).\n\n*For music: Apple TV, AirPort Express, or AirPlay-enabled speakers.\n\nIf you want to stream iTunes Store content, you also need an Internet connection.\nUse AirPlay\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iOS device and your AirPlay device to the same Wi-Fi network.\n\n*On your iOS device, swipe up from the bottom of your screen to open Control Center.\n\n*Tap AirPlay.\n\n*Tap the name of the device you want to stream content to. You'll see a picture of a TV screen or speaker next to each device, so you know what type of content you can stream. On iPad, you might need to scroll to see all of the available devices.\n\nWhen you choose an AirPlay device, audio or video from your iOS device will play on your AirPlay-enabled speakers or on the TV that's connected to your Apple TV.\nIf you turn on Mirroring, you'll see your entire iOS screen on the TV that's connected to your Apple TV. Your TV will use the orientation and aspect ratio of your device. If you want the image from your device to fill your TV screen, you might need to to adjust your TV's aspect ratio or zoom settings.\n\nA: You can use Apple's Airplay technology to stream from your iPad (or iPhone) to your tv, but you need to use an AppleTV connected to your Panasonic through an HDMI port to do so. The AppleTV device takes care of connecting the TV to the Wifi and also your device. On top of that the AppleTV has its own media viewing apps so you may not need the iPad.\n\nA: There is a way to display your videos and images on your Panasonic TV without Apple TV or HDMI cable. Download Sunshine app in your ipad and if both devices are connected with the same WIFI network it will work. It's very straightforward to use... you play the video from the app and in the top right corner there is a bottom and there you can select your TV\nLink to apple store\n", "Q: Using Finder, how can I view /System/Library? Using Finder, how can I view /System/Library?\nIn fact, I'd really like to do the equivalence of a recursive grep for file names from the root directory using Finder. How can I move around the entire file system with Finder?\n\nA: Press ⇧⌘G (Shift-Command-G) to bring up Go to Folder and type in the path, then click Go as shown in the image below.  Or if using the mouse or trackpad, click: Finder > Go > Go to Folder\n\nYou can also change Finder Preferences to show Hard disks on the Desktop under General and or in Devices under Sidebar, thus being able to open the Macintosh HD from the root of the partition without having to use Go to Folder.\n", "Q: Macbook will say it's charging, but it's not I have a Macbook Pro 13\" i7 Early 2011 (MacbookPro8,1).  It's on its second battery (DP bq20z451 manufactured Dec 2012) from March 2015.  It was working fine for a while, but in the last month it's developed a problem and it's getting increasingly worse.\nSometimes even if the AC charger indicates it's charging (orange light), but the OS will say it is discharging. coconutBattery agrees.\nSometimes the battery will indicate it's charging, but when I remove the AC power it turns out it was not; the battery charge level will drop.  If this goes on long enough the laptop will power off because the battery has gone dead but the OS thought it was at 100%.  In this case, the lights on the battery agree it is out of power.\ncoconutBattery says the battery is in good condition, has 93% of its capacity, has only gone through 317 cycles, and is not overheating (30ºC).\nMy question is, is replacing the battery likely to fix this problem? Or is this indicative of a more serious problem?\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown.\n\n*Resetting the SMC.\n\n*Different power adapters.\n\n\nA: I finally fixed it today. It turns out the Magsafe DC-in board can be replaced. It's a little $25 part ($15 refurbished). I followed the instructions on iFixit.com; you have to take apart practically the whole laptop which includes a lot of tiny, tiny connectors, but it's doable with just a few screwdrivers and a spudger I made from a chopstick.\n\nThe battery now charges fine, and the laptop doesn't get nearly as hot (that could also be because I cleaned the heat sink).\n", "Q: Search for folders that contain filetypes For example, how do you search for all folders that contain \".mp3\" files (on OS X)?\n\nA: I don't think it's possible using Finder, but you can easily find these folders via Terminal\nfind . -name '*.mp3' | sed 's|/[^/]*$||' | sort -u\n\nSome explanations:\n\n\n*\n\n*find lists all files (and their paths) ending in mp3 in the current folder and everything \"beneath\" it\n\n*sed strips away the last part of each line produced by find which does not contain a / (which practically results in the file name getting removed)\n\n*The result so far is a list of folders containing mp3 files. If a folder contains more than one such file, it will be listed several times so we use sort -u (unique) to remove duplicates while sorting.\n\n", "Q: Splice a 45W MagSafe 2 connector onto an 85W PSU? I have an unused 45W MacBook Air MagSafe 2 PSU, and an 85W MagSafe 1 PSU that my dog chewed the connector off.\nI'm wondering if splicing the MagSafe 2 connector onto the 85W PSU would allow a MacBook Pro to draw the full capacity from the 85W PSU, or would it limit itself to the nominal capacity identified by the MagSafe connector's ID chip (i.e. that of the 45W PSU)?\nAlso, assuming it worked, would it be likely to cause any heat issues etc. - I'm assuming all MagSafe connectors would be electrically capable of handling the higher current, but is that a safe assumption?\n\nA: The price difference between Apple's 85W and 45W power adapters has always been very small, which one could assume means that they probably use the same high quality components (wiring and connector) for both, with the only difference being the size and output of the adapter. This also makes sense from a manufacturing perspective, but naturally we will never know for sure unless we get a statement from Apple about it (which, of course, we can assume we won't).\nConsidering the above, I certainly think what you're asking might be possible with the right amount of skill, but the question you need to ask yourself is if it's worth saving a few bucks for a very likely fire hazard in your home (or wherever you would use the adapter).\n", "Q: How to get Apple News App in iPhone 5 (India) I have iPhone 5 and iOS 9.2 installed right now in my phone but still i am not getting Apple News app in my phone.\nCan any one let me know how can I get that application on my iPhone 5 (India).\n\nA: See: iOS 9 Feature Availability § News\n\nNews is only available in Australia, USA, and the UK.\n\nThis is also more \"explicitly\" stated in the fine print at the end of the iOS 9.3 Preview page.\n\nFeatures are subject to change.\n\n*\n\n*News is available only in the U.S., UK, and Australia.\n\n*May not be available in all regions.\n\n\n", "Q: Macbook air or Macbook pro?

I have an Arris DG1760 Cable Modem/Wi-Fi Router from Time Warner Cable. I connect to the router via Wi-Fi (5G). No issues until after my MBP goes to sleep and then I wake it up, I am still connected to Wi-Fi but have no connectivity whatsoever. I diff'd the result of ifconfig with a good connection versus after sleep/wake, and there is only one line different. \nWorking:\n\ninet 192.168.0.8 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.0.255\n\nNot Working:\n\ninet 169.254.150.25 netmask 0xffff0000 broadcast 169.254.255.255\n\nApparently (from whois), the non-working IP is a link-local address. Not sure exactly what that means to my situation, but any ideas on how to resolve this? I'd prefer to not have to turn Wi-Fi on/off each time I come back to my MacBook. \n\nA: Had very similar problem.  After wake up Wi-Fi icon shows \"connected\" status, but network does not work, i.e. even ping to my router does not work.  The connectivity usually resumes on its own after some time (dozens of seconds to couple of minutes), or after I do manual DHCP renew or turn Wi-Fi off and then back on.\nThe problem gone after I disabled DoS attack protection on my router.  It seems that my router treated Apple's rapid DHCP (https://cafbit.com/entry/rapid_dhcp_or_how_do) as DoS attack attempt.\n\nA: I'm sorry I can't be of more help with the network diagnostics aspect of the issue, but you might try deleting out your wi-fi network and rejoining your network and/or renewing the DHCP lease (in your System preference pane for \"Network\" under the \"Advanced\" option).\n", "Q: Downgrade Safari Browser I have a MacBook Pro with OS X 10.8.5 and I have downloaded the wrong Safari browser, for OS X 10.10.\nIt says \"You can't use this version of the application \"Safari\" with this version of OS X\".\nHow to downgrade the incorrect version for OS X 10.10 and replace with the newest Safari for OS X 10.8.5?\n\nA: From: Get the latest version of Safari for your Mac\n\nYou can keep Safari up to date by keeping macOS up to date.\nSafari is included with your Mac. To get the latest version of Safari, install the latest macOS.\nTo keep Safari up to date for an earlier macOS, install the latest\n  updates for that macOS.\n\nNote: Updated to reflect changes in Apple Support HT204416 as of: Jun 15, 2017\n", "Q: MacBook Pro USB ports not working properly At work, I usually use my left USB port to charge my iPhone, while the right port connects to a hub on my monitor, providing Ethernet, external keyboard and sometimes another iOS device. I also have the monitor itself connected via one of the Thunderbolt ports. The computer is connected to the mains.\nAll of this works fine, but recently I've had some what I believe to be power-related issues with the ports. If I try to plug my iPad mini 2 into either port, it doesn't charge correctly (it keeps chiming to say it's charging, randomly, every second or so).\nAnother symptom appears to be that if I try to run Duet (the iOS/OS X app combo that allows you to run your iOS device as an external screen), it keeps trying to connect, the screens flash black, then come back, then keep coming and going but never connects properly to the iOS device. This is even the case if I'm using my iPhone, which doesn't usually have any problems charging.\nI've tried removing all external devices and just plugging in the iPhone, and Duet still doesn't work properly. Same with the iPad and charging, if no other devices are connected, it still beeps all the time and doesn't charge properly.\n\nA: Usually (depending on MBP model) - there is only one fully powered / full speed bus. \nYou could try resetting the PRAM / NVRAM which also causes a restart to be sure it’s not a temporary situation.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063\nHere is a good support article on USB ports and their corresponding power. \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204377\nFrom my experience iPads can request a lot of power from a standard USB port. Since power management could be involved, the SMC - System Management Controller decides when to apply or deny charging current. You might want to try one time resetting that for your Mac.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\nIf you still have USB issues once that’s done - see about hardware service either in or out of the standard warranty process.\n", "Q: Can there be two separate Time Machine Backups on the same external drive? I'm interested in buying an external hard drive. I'd like to know whether if it's possible (and simple if so) to have two separate Time Machine Backups from two different MacBooks at the same time?\n\nA: You can use an external hard disk formatted with HFS+ as a Time Machine target for several Macs without problems. Time Machine itself will make sure that the data is not getting mixed up by using the name of each Mac as part of the path.\n\nA: If you make two different partitions in the external HD, you can easily have the two different Time Machine backup in the each partition. \nYou only need to specify the partition to use for the MacBook during the initial Time Machine setup. Then the Mac would know which partition to use for its backup the next time you connect the external HD. The same goes for the second MacBook. \nBy doing so you could limit the amount of space taken up by he Time Machines of both Macs.  \n\nA: For what it's worth, I have this setup running in a few locations with a single NAS, and multiple machines backing up to it.  As long as you specify a separate folder, there is no need to create separate partitions.   The backups will be completely separated out, and allow you to connect again, authenticate to the folder, and restore from the backups as needed.  \nI do have separate user accounts on the NAS, so the network folder is logged into by each machine separately with it's respective authorized user.  \n", "Q: How can I manage apps with File Sharing within iOS (without using computer)?

Until yesterday, where I had three crashes in quick succession. Now when the display (miniDP-to-VGA) is connected, the computer won't boot. I unlock my boot volume, but the black bar only fills to about one third before stopping. When I disconnect the adapter, it boots but once I connect the display, the laptop screen goes black and audio also dies after a few moments. The computer is still running and can only be shut down by long-pressing the power button.\nI am baffled, but also unsure on how to diagnose the problem. Console shows no unusual messages.\n\n\n*\n\n*I booted into my second OS (elementaryOS) and it reacts to connecting the adapter, but nothing shows on the other screen except occasionally a static image.\nThis may point to a hardware issue.

Also used to work at the Genius Bar, and would see this a lot with certain models of MBP. \nTry running a hardware test https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257 , or if you can take it in to the Genius Bar. They have diagnostics which will help isolate it to either hardware or software. \nHave you tried a different external display / display cable?\n\nA: As it turns out, the adapter was faulty, as it appears. I had not tested it because shortly after the problem occurred, the battery refused to charge so I had to have it serviced.\nIt may also have been related to a short-circuit on the magsafe board on which all the ports lie.\n", "Q: disable Time Machine scripts My 2013 iMac was recalled by the factory for some issue with the drive. The drive was changed and I started afresh - I thought. It turns out that I was running some schedule on Time Machine which updated every time there was a change in file parameters. Which means always. One adviser suggests that this old script has been transported onto the new drive, but now I can't get to it to stop it. I do not run Time Machine and make all my back-ups by another program.\nDoes anyone have any idea if anything can be done to fix it?\n\nA: All you need to do is just toggle off time machine. The scripts are for people that want to inherit an old backup folder when they continue to use time machine. \nSee tmutil inheritbackup command line tool for details and the manual page. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/tmutil.8.html\n\n*Can I inherit a Time Machine backup if I clone my HD?\n\nInheriting is typically only one step in the process of configuring a backup for use by a machine. You may also need to use setdestination, associatedisk, or both, depending on the situation.\n\n", "Q: Only display on Thunderbolt works. Camera, audio and USB ports do not Very similar problem as this question, only the display itself is working on the thunderbolt monitor (I only have one, unlike the linked question which had two) with a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013). No camera, no audio, no power to USB ports on the display. If I disconnect the thunderbolt display from the MBP, then power does go to the USB ports. \nOS X 10.10.5 (14F1509)\n(more details below which probably don't amount to much)\nThis is actually the 2nd Thunderbolt monitor I've had recently. My company exchanged out my previous one, which had similar issues. The prior Thunderbolt was fine, then one day the display would not turn on, attached devices no longer received an active charge. Power would return to USB ports if display was unplugged from the MBP. Then a day or two later, everything went back to working, but the new monitor had already shipped out.\nReplacement monitor worked fine the first day, then (of course) the day I shipped back the prior one, started acting consistently as described above - display only, no camera, audio or usb power. \nI tried the SMC reset steps (about three times, in case it was sensitive to pressing all 4 keys \"at the same time\" in just the right way). That hasn't worked. \n\nA: There is a known similar issue with certain 27' Thunderbolt displays going black, and having connection issues. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204450 \nCan you check the firmware version of the Thunderbolt display? \nApple Menu > About this Mac > System Report > Thunderbolt (from left sidebar) > Thunderbolt Display. \nThe latest firmware version should be 26.2 and the latest Port Micro Firmware Version should be 2.0.7. \n\n\nA: I have the opposite problem. My Thunderbolt display used to work fine but now displays only intermittently. However, its sound works fine and the laptop recognizes the monitor. Suspect fluctuating power screws up display; have tried various power cords and they sort-of work, then fail. I have a UPS/surge protection unit on order; have read others' posts and some have reported success with this. \n", "Q: OS X prefers case insensitivity but TimeMachine seems to require case sensitivity? As per What are the downsides to using Time Machine? the first item reads Time machine requires an Apple specific HFS+ filesystem to store backups.

Just like most everyone else I get:  \nThis volume has the wrong case sensitivity for a backup. \nAfter hours of googling, I've not read that there is absolutely no workaround.\n\nA: The linked answer doesn't say that Time Machine requires ...Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled)....

I can boot into Internet Recovery (Apple Key + Options + R) just fine. I can open Disk Utility while logged in with my user, so I ran the First Aid on the disk with no problems found.\nThe only thing I can see an issue with is there is an old bootcamp partition on the drive.

I just did this on my other (exact model) Macbook yesterday without a problem.\n\nA: This is exactly the type of convoluted situation that calls for having a 3rd party software cloning utility in your toolset. If you need to transfer Apps, system settings & one or more user profiles to the replacement SSD then using a cloning tool would be ideal. It would enable you to clone just the boot partition to the SSD after which you would need to reinstall the OS from an internet restore session so as to get a functional local restore partition on the SSD as well. This can be done without harming the data that already exists on the drive.\nIf you want to reuse the original drive for backups as an example, then once you can successfully boot from the SSD you can reconnect the old drive & use Disk Utility to repartition it so you have access to its entire storage volume. \n", "Q: How do I disable/enable an external monitor from terminal I run two external monitors + my MBP display in OSX Yosemite.

It has to be left click + some one-hand keyboard stroke.\nI forgot to mention, I am left handed therefore I need key strokes on the left hand side of the keyboard.\n\nA: To make this work you have to use a third party tool: Karabiner.\nIn the example below hitting the left alt key once generates one back command in Safari (only).

I'm trying to move folders and files around, but I cannot see one of the folders or it's files in finder. \nDescription\nI'm migrating posts from WordPress to Jekyll. My exporter created markdown files in a hidden folder, unexpectedly. I am trying to move the markdown files from the hidden folder to a Jekyll site I've previously setup. In Terminal, I have created a copy of the markdown files in the correct directory. However, because the exporter generated folder was hidden, all of the contents have remained hidden. I cannot see the files in Finder and Jekyll cannot render the files correctly when I try to start the server. \nUpdate 1: I have created an issue on the github page for the exporter, but I haven't gotten a response yet. I have tried some of the solutions below, including using Finder> Go to folder... and chflags -R nohidden ~/jekyll-site. Due to the Go to folder..., I am now able to see the folders created by the exporter. However, the folders still appear empty in Finder. chflags hasn't helped.\nUpdate 2: I ran  ls ~/jekyll-sites/subdir | wc -l, as suggested below. I got \"11\". Meanwhile, I thought that if I just started the server that would help. It kind of did: my posts are showing up correctly on the blog, which is an improvement, but I still don't actually see them in Finder. I've tried opening the posts in Sublime and trying a Save As. When I do, I can see them all listed in the dialog but they are all greyed out. What's more, I get an alert \"A file with this name already exists\". \nUpdate 3\nTried a solution to create copy of the files, without the \"._\" prefix in case that could copy the files without copying the problem. That didn't work, but I wanted to include that here in case it's helpful to others. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal. (Assuming it's opening to your Home Directory in which the jekyll-sites directory is in.) \n\n*Copy and paste the following command into the Terminal then press Enter: zip -r jekyll-sites.zip jekyll-sites -x \"._*\"; open jekyll-sites.zip \n\n*Open Finder and there should now be a jekyll-sites 2 folder in your Home Folder. \n\n\nSolution: No idea why this worked, but I ended up restarting Finder, which seemed to fix the problem. \n\nA: You can use chflags in a Terminal to hide/unhide a file where file is an individual file or folder or when using the -R option, all files/folders within a folder.  See: man chflags\nBasic syntax to hide a file is:\nchflags hidden file\n\nOr folder and everything in it: \nchflags -R hidden file\n\nBasic syntax to unhide a file is:\nchflags nohidden file\n\nOr folder and everything in it: \nchflags -R nohidden file\n\nNote: If the folder is a system folder you'll need to preface the chflags command with sudo, e.g.: sudo chflags nohidden file\nAlso with OS X 10.11 SIP may have to be disabled, although not sure on that as I'm not running OS X 10.11 and cannot test.\n\nA: For just moving files and folders within the hidden folder, it might actually not even be necessary to unhide the folder as long as you know its name—or know how to get it.\nFor example: I know that a Library folder exists within my user folder but I cannot see it in the Finder:\n\nHowever, I can use CMD+Shift+G to open a prompt where I can type in a folder I want to go to.\nIf that shortcut doesn’t work for you, in Finder’s toolbar select Go > Go to Folder. The input field there actually has tab completion like the terminal does with bash, so you can, e.g., type in ~/Lib, press tab and it will automatically be turned into ~/Library/.\n\nThis, as I mentioned earlier, only works if you know where to find the hidden folder.\nIf you don’t, you can open the Terminal (CMD+Space, type Terminal, press Enter/Return) and get to the closest folder where you think the hidden folder might be and then type ls -al. This lists all files—including hidden ones—as a detailled list. Hidden files usually start with ..\nOnce you got the exact path, you can try what I wrote above with the Finder’s Go to folder action.\n", "Q: Ultra HD monitor with Macbook pro 13 mid 2014 I have an Macbook pro 13 mid 2014.

This is not Internet Recovery.\nHowever, on this screen, if you press Cmd + Option + R, this will boot into Internet Recovery.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro, iCloud Drive, Time Machine and Time Capsule 2 Can I use Time Machine and Time Capsule 2 to backup not only my MacBook Pro files, apps, etc. but also the files stored on my iCloud Drive for sharing with my other MacBook Pro and others?  \n\nA: Yes - Time Machine saves a snapshot of the locally synced files from iCloud so you should be able to recover them even if they are gone from iCloud.\nSince one Time Machine destination can be connected to many Macs, you could cross share that was as well.\n", "Q: Back to My Mac: BTMM kMMServiceFailureNotification About a week ago iCloud's Back to My Mac service silently stopped working and will no longer start.\nI discovered an error icon in System Preference's iCloud panel reporting the error: Back to My Mac isn't working because it couldn't start properly.\nFollowing the trouble shooting steps provided by Apple has not fixed the problem.

It appeared to have occurred at the same time as the last in a 3-4 week series of occasional spurious iCloud ID errors, requiring me to enter my iCloud password on each occasion. Back to my Mac is not accessible on any of the 3 macs using my personal account.\nI spent 90 minutes on the phone with Apple Support. The problem could not be resolved immediately and was escalated to the level of the engineering staff for offline investigation.\nUpdate: 3 days later BTMM was working correctly on all my machines, having been fixed at the Apple end. No explanation as yet as to the cause or how resolved. I recommend you contact Apple Support directly\n", "Q: Associate Apple ID with two different SIM cards (phone numbers) I live in Canada but travel to the States and when I do I put in my American SIM card which of course has a different phone number. Sometimes when in the States I get locked out of my account and it sends a verification code to my Canadian number, but I don't really want to put the SIM card back in the phone just to get the code.  Is there any way I can have the verification code go to both numbers simultaneously. \n\nA: If you have another phone, you can forward both phone calls and messages from one number to another. If you have another iPhone, you can forward messages for free - just go to Settings > Messages > Text Message Forwarding. This will make the message appear on both devices within a minute or so of each other. If you don't have an iPhone, I expect other phones would have an SMS forwarding capability, but there would be a per message cost. \nI use this so I don't have to carry a work and personal phone, and it works well. The only complication you have is that it is in 2 different countries, so there will be roaming charges (I expect).\n", "Q: Restrict sftp user to a single directory in El Capitan Searched the web for quite some time and still can't find a solution.\nIs it even possible at all to restrict ssh user to a single directory in 10.11?

I have a standard 256GB SSD right now. I would like to upgrade that to a 512GB or higher. When I was looking around I found this SAMSUNG 950 PRO 512 GB SSD that has a huge performance in write and read speed.\nThis SAMSUNG 950 PRO 512 GB has a M.2 2280 connection.\nIs it possible to fit this inside my Macbook?\n\nA: The Samsung 950pro has the same connector and the same chipset.  In fact, both the 950pro and the Samsung manufactured Apple SSD of this type share the same exact PCB and chips.  Initially the 950pro was manufactured as an OEM drive especially for Apple.\nHowever the 950pro retail version has minor hardware differences and a complete different firmware.\nWhile they indeed fit physically, they are NOT compatible.  There are currently no aftermarket drives for this range.  If someone would release a compatible drive in the future, the OWC Envoy range would be my best bet.\n\nA: I am not sure about that particular ssd model, but if there's anything NOT soldered on the macbook pro, then that's definitely the SSD! So of course you can replace it. The crap you find on the internet from people pretending to answer IT question is unbearable.\nBy the way, don't be taken in completely by the specs. Not all brands perform as well as the published specs say. Intel seems to be most truthful, but it's often too expensive. If you've been able to make the change, please let me know. I'm interested in it myself.\n\nA: You can upgrade using the SSD models available from OWC.\nThey have the 480 GB Aura SSD and 1 TB Aura SSD which will allow you to upgrade to a larger size disk. \nThe actual upgrade process is quite easy. You'll have to remove the screws from the back of the laptop taking off the back. Then remote the single screw that keeps the SSD seated and mounted to the logic board, and it is easy to replace.\nYou can find the SSDs here:\n480 GB Aura SSD\n1 TB Aura SSD\n", "Q: How to download Firefox via command line FTP I am attempting to install Firefox on my Mac, which currently does not have a browser. From a bash terminal I have ftp installed and am currently connected to the internet. However, I have been unsuccessful in connecting to their FTP server.  How do I go about installing Firefox for my Mac via the command line?\n\nA: ftp access to ftp.mozilla.org was turned off (see this, thanks Davïd). However, you can use curl from the command line:\ncurl 'https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/43.0.4/mac/en-US/Firefox%2043.0.4.dmg' >~/Desktop/'Firefox 43.0.4.dmg'\n\nThat gets the latest (as of this writing) US English release for Mac OS X of Firefox.\nYou can get a directory listing thusly:\ncurl 'https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/43.0.4/mac/'\n\nThat outputs HTML, but it's pretty simple HTML, so it shouldn't be a problem reading it to get a different language. You can also chop additional elements off the path, for example if you want a different version:\ncurl 'https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/'\n\n\nA: You can skip the download step, and mount it directly over the internet like so:\nhdiutil attach https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/43.0.4/mac/en-US/Firefox\\ 43.0.4.dmg\n\nSaves a step, time, and storage space!\n", "Q: How to restore my iPod How can i restore my jailbroken iPod 4th gen iOS 6.1.6.\nWhen i restore from iTunes it shows an error\" iPod could not be restore an unknown error(3096) occurred\".\nWhat can i do for restoring my iPod .\n\nA: You need to put it into DFU mode.

I upgraded to El Capitan in my new Macbook Air. El Capitan does not allow to use /usr/texbin/ for storage so LaTeX community had to move their files to /Library/TeX. \nMacTeX 2015 is not fully compatible with El Capitan. \nThere is at least some path reconfigurations which has to be done in individual programs described in the guide. \nHowever, I have not succeeded in getting MacTeX fully working in El Capitan. \nFixing LaTeX in El Capitan\nAll stages went right but not the following with TeX Live Utility. \nI am doing the step in the guide MacTEX-2015 and El Capitan (page 3)\n\nFor previous versions of TEX Live Utility open TEX Live\n  Utility→Preferences and click on the Choose. . . button as in Figure\n  (4).

I don't see anything in the exercise ring. How is the exercise time counted?\n\nA: Have you tried calibrating your Apple Watch? According to the support article, Calibrating your Apple Watch for improved Workout and Activity accuracy, calibration helps improve accuracy of things like distance and pace when GPS is not available. An example of this would be when you are walking or running on a treadmill.\n\nA: If you hold onto the handle bars, your WATCH has no way to tell that you’re exercising. Your arms need to be swinging during Walking activities for WATCH to credit you exercise minutes.\nAs @RedEagle2000 mentioned, your activity also needs to cross a certain intensity threshold. That intensity is specific to each individual, with WATCH learning your exercise capacity through your measured heart rate throughout the day, your other activities, etc. Calibrating your WATCH as per Apple’s instructions can help in that department.\n\nA: This is a bug people have been complaining about since January 2017.  The outdoor walk workout app, and others, do not reliably report data to the exercise ring.  The walk data does get recorded by the watch- check under the \"Workouts\" tab in the Activity App, and you will find the distance and heart rate data.  It just doesn't flow into the exercise ring. An activity that raises your heart rate to 100% over baseline resting should be considered equivalent to a brisk walk but even pushing your heart rate to 200% of resting baseline won't reliably budge the exercise ring if you are using the Outdoor Walk or several other workout apps to record your workouts. This is a software bug that Apple needs to fix.\nPlease use the Apple Product Feedback website to specifically complain directly to Apple.  If they get enough complaints, they may eventually assign engineers to fix the bug.  Otherwise, the Apple Watch fails as a fitness tracker if you intend to use the exercise workout apps to record and track your work outs and close your exercise rings.  \n\nA: According to Apple, anything requiring the effort of a brisk walk or greater will be counted in the Exercise ring.\nI imagine that your heart rate has a lot to do with how much effort your Apple Watch detects in the activity that you're preforming, but I don't know what BPM it calls exercise.\n", "Q: How can I remove Photo Library from iCloud How can I remove Photo Library from iCloud without deleting the photos stored on the iPhone, so that photos will be included in an iCloud backup of the phone?\n\nA: Yes you can!\nGo to Settings > iCloud > Photos.\nMake sure you have selected \"Download and keep originals\" turned on rather than \"Optimize [device] storage\". This way you'll have full resolution copies of your pictures on your device. You will have to wait for all pictures to download if \"Optimize...\" was on.\nIf there is more data to download than space available, you'll have to find a different route to keep your full resolution photos.  \nOr you may just turn it off and it will ask you to save the data if you had \"Optimize...\" on.\n\nThen check Settings > General > Storage & iCloud Usage > Manage Storage and check that your pictures are being backed up.\n", "Q: iPod Nano without iTunes (Chromebook) My father has an iPod Nano (4th generation I think, though it may be 5th) and runs iTunes on his aging Windows laptop.  He would like to switch to a Chromebook, which would obviously prevent him from running iTunes locally.\nAre there alternative (cloud-based) ways of syncing music to an older Nano device, or is a PC with iTunes required to store music and sync this device?\n\nA: Simple answer: No.\niTunes and a USB cable are needed to synch any iPad Nano. The 7th generation Nano has Bluetooth, but that is for playback only. This Wikipedia page on all the generations of Nanos will be elucidating.\n\nA: yes turn your chromebook into developer mode and it should take about 20 min. once that is done open up a new tab and type ctrl+t it will open a terminal type shell and it should open local host after that type ipod/music/download/67  then be sure to copy the url or file to that and then paste it in the terminal have your ipod hooked up to your chromebook and there you have it\n\nA: No, because the iPod Nano 7th generation, is only for iMac, As Known As, MacBook Pro & MacBook Air, only. If you plug that iPod Shuffle or any iPod Nano, into a Google ChromeBook, the data will be erased immediately. \n\nA: No, because if you plug in your iPod Nano 6th generation into a Google ChromeBook Acer 7, it will erase the music data library automatically immediately.

I know from earlier that this is not easy. \nTried this without success.\nHave you come across anything that works?\n\nA: Not a great solution, but have you tried turning off the firewall?\nIf that works, then try the following, which may prompt you to allow nginx to bypass the OS X firewall: nginx -g \"daemon off;\"; this will make nginx run in the foreground instead of with the daemon, which seemed to help OS X recognize that it needs firewall permissions.\nIf you're not getting that popup, try turning off the Automatically allow signed applications option in System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Firewall -> Firewall options..., then toggle the firewall off and back on, and toggle the \"lock\" off and back on (lower left hand corner if you have it set to require admin password to modify security preferences).\nOnce I got it to give me the popup and I clicked Allow, I found it would let me access nginx for that session.\n\nA: sudo cp /usr/local/opt/nginx/*.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons\nsudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist\n\n", "Q: IPhones sharing neither Apple ID nor iCloud somehow still sharing data My girlfriend has recently acquired her sisters old iPhone 5s running latest iOS version as of writing.\nHer mother has an IPhone 5s as well, under similar conditions.\nBoth devices are linked to distinct iCloud and Apple IDs.\nMy girlfriend's phone contains a number of contacts belonging to her mother. When she deletes one, it is removed from her mother's phone as well.\nHow do we prevent this?\n\nA: This happened to me I gave my husband my old apple 5s but didn't wipe it clean first. He deleted 3-400 of my contacts in a 1 hour period since they were still using the same iCloud account. From experience I now know to rest the old phone to factory default and set it up that users own Apple ID.

I used my old Mac which showed me English when I browsed through Mac App Store. However, after I purchased my new Mac and ported all the data using Time Machine, the Mac App Store suddenly shows me Japanese for some reasons.\nI use English in OS Settings and everything works fine except the Mac App Store. I live in Japan, which is likely the possible reason it shows me Japanese.\nWhy do Apple use the different language only on the Mac App Store? And how can I resolve the issue?\n\nA: After I fought with the issue for a few hours, I found the solution.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Mac App Store and log out of the account.\n\n*Restart your Mac.\n\n*Log in to the account again. \nYou might have to log out of the account first before restarting, for your information.\n\nUPDATE\nHowever, while the solution here worked in my OS X, it's not the case in iOS. In my iPhone, which is set to Italian, the iOS App Store displays English, while my iPad that uses Spanish displays Japanese. This is so frustrating bug in Apple; I don't get to how this can be resolved...\n\nA: On the Mac App Store, scroll all the way down, you will find an icon with the current region flag on the bottom right. Click that and change to the app store region you'd like to access.\n\n\nA: There was an answer here: https://superuser.com/questions/412854/appstore-how-to-use-english-only-interface\nHere is what was said there:\n\nAs far as I know, the language of the AppStore App is always\n  determined by the country in which your account was registered. The\n  AppStore app is basically just a webview which means that the\n  localization is done by the server and not your mac, in order to\n  change the language to english you'll have to create an english\n  account. You could also change the region of your account in the\n  account settings, but that would make it impossible to use a foreign\n  credit card. There's also a thread on Apple's Support Communities\n  Board about this:\n  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3797598?start=0&tstart=0\n\n", "Q: iOS: Your passcode is required to enable Touch ID Occasionally, when unlocking my iPhone or iPad, I get the following message:\n\nYour passcode is required to enable Touch ID\n\nNow this is not after a number of failed attempts or turning the device off. The device was used within the last 12 hours. Two of the devices are less than 2 months old, and one is a year old. Everything is up to date. It appears to be happening more-or-less at random.\nDoes anybody know why this message might appear?\n\nA: There are certain rules that iOS uses that govern when your iPhone will prompt you for your passcode, and one of these relates to an 8hr period during which Touch ID has not been used. That alone would explain the scenario in your question (i.e. some nights you’re getting 8+ hrs of sleep, and other nights you’re not).\nAll of the Touch ID rules can be found in Apple’s iOS Security Guide. In summary though, the rules governing when a passcode is required instead of your fingerprint, are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*The passcode has not been used to unlock the device in the last six days\n\n*Your fingerprint has not been used to unlock the device in the last eight hours 1\n\n*You have just powered up (or rebooted) your device\n\n*Your device has not been unlocked for more than 48 hours\n\n*You’ve unsuccessfully tried to use your fingerprint on five consecutive attempts\n\n*Whenever you add a fingerprint to your Touch ID settings\n\n*Your device has received a remote lock command\n\n\nRegarding that last point, this refers to iCloud’s Lost Mode function. For more info you can read iCloud: Use Lost Mode.\nSee more details: http://www.macworld.com/article/3072181/ios/new-touch-id-rules-why-you-have-to-enter-your-passcode-when-you-wake-up.html\n1 This is most likely the cause in your situation most of the time.\n\nA: FWIW, I experienced the same thing on an iPad mini 4 on 9.2.1 today. Was using the iPad < 12 hrs before. The wording was identical to above. When I restart the device different wording is used: iPad requires your passcode after restarting.\nThis implies something happening with Touch ID itself, rather than a date/time bug or the device restarting. Perhaps Touch ID or a related service is crashing unseen. \n\nA: Maybe you have been accidentally touching the Touch ID sensor without realizing it and it locked up. This has happened to me before without a restart and apparently it had been trying to get my fingerprint in my pocket...\nAlso, perhaps another culprit (maybe a child or loved one) has been messing with Touch ID.\n\nA: This is a software bug in iOS 9. It happens to me at least twice a week on my iPad. You could submit a bug report to Apple, but I would imagine it will be fixed with either iOS 9.3 next month or iOS 10 in September. \n\nA: Are we talking of phones that are in your (jeans) pocket? It happens to me if I accidentally hit the touch ID sensor when reaching into my pocket. The other culprit in my case is my daughter playing with my phone when I don't watch.\n", "Q: Are all apps compatible with the Apple TV? I can't find a list of Apple TV products anywhere. I want to use Dish Anywhere specifically on the Apple TV. I'd also like to know if I can just mirror my screen from my iPhone 6 Plus to the Apple TV.\n\nA: No, not every iPhone app will be on the new Apple TV. Developers have to release apps specifically for the Apple TV, not just porting the iPhone app.\nYes, you can mirror the screen of any iPhone 4s or later to one of the newer Apple TVs.\n", "Q: User permissions problem after restoring from Time Machine to a new user Mac OS X El Capitan My old MacBook Pro died so I did a restore from a Time Machine backup to an iMac. I did the restore to a new user so the info already in the iMac would not be lost.\nEverything went smoothly and I have a clone from my MB Pro in the iMac.\nBut now when I try to save a PDF from Safari, the dialog box will not let me create a \"new folder\" (the button is \"greyed out\"?) and when I click return a dialog box appear with \"Safari cannot export XXXX PDF because you don't have the permissions to do it\".\nI also later found out that it is asking for my password every time I want to move a file from one place to another, or if I want to change a file name.\nHow do I give full permissions to the new user?\n\nA: In versions of OS X from Lion (10.7) and newer with a recovery partition, there is an additional Repair Permissions application utility. This tool is located inside Boot Repair Utilities. Here’s how to access it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart OS X and hold down the Command and R keys.\n\n*You will boot into the Repair Utilities screen. On top, in the Menu Bar click the Utilities item then select Terminal.\n\n*In the Terminal window, type “resetpassword” (without the quotes) and hit Return.\n\n*The Password reset utility launches, but you’re not going to reset the password. Instead, click on the icon for your Mac’s hard drive at the top. From the drop-down below it, select the user account where you are having issues.\n\n*At the bottom of the window, you’ll see an area labeled ‘Reset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs’. Click the Reset button there.\n\n\nInfo gleaned and appropriated from this page.\n", "Q: What is the max number of hard links in OS X (10.11)? I have a file that I keep linking to.  It's up to 45 links now. Does anyone know how I can find out what the maximum number of hard links is in OS X 10.11 (El Capitan)?\n\nA: It seems the theoretical limit is about 1 billion hard links on an HFS+ volume.\n\nIndirect node files have a special identifying number called a link reference. The link reference is unique among indirect node files on a given volume. The link reference is not related to catalog node IDs. When a new indirect node file is created, it is assigned a new link reference randomly chosen from the range 100 to 1073741923.\n\nThe limit for links to a single file is 4294967295, the maximum number of a UInt32, which is about four times larger than the volume limit, which you'll exhaust first.\n\nlinkCount\n    For indirect node files, this field contains the number of hard links that point at this indirect node file.\n\nAs a practical matter, this design is quite strange, and suffers from performance issues. The more hard links you have on a volume, the slower it will be to create a new one, as the system must first find an unused link reference number, then insert it into the metadata directory. Then that metadata directory must be searched to dereference a hard link.\nYou may begin seeing performance problems with only a few thousand links; your great-grandchildren won't live long enough to create a billion if you start today. In practice you'll notice this most often when managing Time Machine backups, which use hard links extensively.\n", "Q: On new Mac, upgrade old Snow Leopard install or start with clean install? I've got an old 2008 Macbook which is not eligible for upgrade to anything supported at the moment. So, I am looking to buy a new MacBook Pro.\nMy question is,\nIs it better to copy/move my HDD to the new machine and then do an upgrade or start with the clean install of OSX already on the machine and slowly reinstall all the apps I need, as needed?\nThanks.\n\nA: You're five major system updates back from  El Capitan, and Apple has made a lot of changes to code, file arrangements, database structures, network connectivity etc. in the meantime.\nApple usually does a pretty good job of clearing away the old to make way for the new, but things do slip through. I recently killed a few prefs files from 2007 that Migration Assistant kindly transferred to my 2014 mini. Invisible files and such often gets copied too. iTunes data structures have changed significantly, with loss of artwork or metadata upon upgrade being fairly common.\nApple is pretty good, but they're not infallible. With a jump of that many years, I'd go for the clean install, followed by thoughtful installation of needed Apps, and manual transfer of docs, pics, music etc. That way you'll end up with a thoroughly modern System rather than a System that also contains a hodgepodge of used or unused pieces dating from an earlier decade.\n\nA: \nIs it better to copy/move my HDD to the new machine and then do an upgrade\n\nNot possible for two reasons. \n- The current Macbook Pros use PCIe flash storage, the drive from your 2008 model will not fit.\n- The operating system in your 2008 will not run on a new Macbook. So you are going to get stuck at a kernel panic page.\nWhat you should do:\nStart the old computer and connect to the local network. Do the same with the new one.\nWhen the new computer asks if you want to run migration assistant, say yes. Follow the prompts to access your old computer and then leave it alone for a while - it can take many hours to process things.\nMigration Assistant will copy your user info, documents, data, and work out which applications are compatible with the new system. End result, a new computer as much like the old one as possible. You will need to update most of your old applications, 8 years is several major versions of nearly anything.\nIt's much faster if you put the old drive in an external case and connect it directly to the new computer. If you know how (and have the parts) do that. \n", "Q: charging my Macbook Pro (85w) with my Macbook Air (45w) charger seeing if anyone as done this. Has any used a 45w charger (like the one that comes with the Air) to charge their Macbook Pro? I left my Pro charger at a friends house and will not be able to get it before I leave town for a work trip, where I'll need the Pro. I'm  thinking that I can shut down the laptop and use the Air charger to charge it over night.\nHas anyone done this? I'm worried about damaging the battery on the Pro.\n\nA: It will be fine. The MacBook Pro will charge with the Air's charger well; it will just be slower than if it was on its original charger. One can even charge a MacBook Air with the charger for the MacBook Pro, if one wanted to.\nI have attempted this myself and have had no problems.\n\nA: From Apple Support: Find the right power adapter and cord for your Mac notebook\n\nPower adapters for Apple notebooks are available in 29W, 45W, 60W, and\n  85W varieties. You should use the appropriate wattage power adapter\n  for your Apple notebook. You can use a compatible higher wattage\n  adapter without issue, but it won't make your computer charge faster\n  or operate differently.

The code presented below is not polished or complete in that it simply preforms the insertion of the number of images in the selected folder into the document without regard for placement location in the document.  You'll have to modify the code to meet your wants/needs. However, if it's not acceptable to you, I do not expect a down dote as I did go to the trouble of trying to offer a reasonable solution, so simply let me know in a comment that it's not the direction you want to go and I'll delete the Answer.\nIn Automator, I created a Workflow using Ask for Finder Items, setting the Type: to Folders while not checking Allow Multiple Selections, > Get Folder Contents > Run Apple Script and a Folder in Finder containing two .png images named as shown in the Results of your Get Folder Contents Action (although I used PNG files it will work with JPG or any type graphic images supported in Pages).\nI then modified your AppleScript code to include the item mentioned in my comment and a repeat statement along with a counter.\nI was then able to insert the two images into a Pages document, which happened lexicographically as that's apparently the default in a scenario such as this.  So this seems to negate the need for the Dispense Items Incrementally Action, although not having that Action I'm not able to test the difference between the two Workflows.\nAppleScript code:\non run {input, parameters}\n    set repeatCount to input count\n    set n to 1\n    tell application \"Pages\"\n        set thisDocument to make new document\n        tell thisDocument\n            repeat repeatCount times\n                set img to item n of input\n                make new image with properties {image data:img}\n                set n to n + 1\n            end repeat\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend run\n\nAs previously mentioned, this just inserts the number of images in the selected folder into the document without regard for placement location in the document and you'll need to determine what code is necessary to achieve proper location placement in the document and because this is looping you'll probably need to increment the location position for each image you insert in the document as well.\nEven though it's installed I personally do not use Pages, I use LibreOffice, however having searched the Internet a bit I saw example code that dealt with placement location in the document and I would also open the Script Editor app and then open the Pages Dictionary to see what it exposes so you can determine what you have to work with.\n", "Q: Shortcut for dragging and dropping a tab on terminal Not sure if this is possible.

According to apple's compatibility table, here Windows XP is supported in Boot camp , provided you use your original OSX DVDs to locate the drivers.\nHowever, it would appear that the only option offered in boot camp assistant is to install Windows 7. My assumption is that Windows XP can only be installed via boot camp if I have a much older OSX version installed, 10.6. Or, if by chance the boot camp assistant from 10.6 (3.x) can be installed in El Capitan. \nThe documentation is misleading as it does not specify the starting point I need to be at to install Windows XP via bootcamp, only that I need the original OSX DVD to get started...\n\nA: I will try to answer your question as best that I can. It is a question of timing. By 2009, Apple was shipping Macs with firmware or offered firmware upgrades that allowed Windows to be installed in BIOS/MBR mode. This firmware is stored in your Mac. The firmware does not change when you upgrade to a new version of OS X. Therefore, the version of OS X currently installed has nothing to do with whether you can run Windows on your Mac. In fact, it is possible to run Windows on your Mac without any version of OS X installed.\nTo install a particular version of Windows on a Mac, a few timing aspects need to be considered. The Windows installation DVD needs recognize your Macs hardware in order to install the drivers needed to install and boot to Windows. Since Windows XP was released in 2001, one should not expect the DVD (or maybe CD) to contain the drivers for the 2009 Mac models. Granted, to a certain extent, hardware can be designed to operate in a legacy mode in order to install an older operating system. When the difference is 8 years, this is difficult to do. Also, Microsoft installations allow for newer drivers to be introduced during the installation process, but this was never employed for Windows installations on Macs in 2009. Instead, Microsoft released Windows XP DVDs with Service Packs already installed. These newer DVDs contained the drivers need to allow Windows to install and boot on Macs. Once, Windows was up and running, better drivers could be installed to upgrade existing drivers and support other hardware such as the camera and sound. These drivers were part of a package referred to as \"The Boot Camp Support Software\". This software also provided a way to boot back to OSX and a utility to update Apple software such as iTunes. When \"The Boot Camp Support Software\" installs, the Windows partition is renamed BOOTCAMP. For this reason, it has become customary to refer to the Windows installation on a Mac as Boot Camp. In fact, you can rename the partition to anything after installing \"The Boot Camp Support Software\".\nApple's web site says you can install Windows XP on your Mac. Whether you need SP2 or SP3 included on the DVD is just a matter of timing. I do not have an answer. SP2 was released in 2004 and SP3 can out in 2008. Since SP3 was the last offered for XP, such a DVD should work for you.\nAlthough your question did not ask about installing a newer version of Windows, I will include my thoughts anyway. Generally, Microsoft does not require new drivers for each release of Windows. For example, when upgrading Windows, the newer version just adopts the drivers from the previous version. Also, Microsoft may offer new drivers though Windows Update. Windows 10 appears to have he ability to connect to the internet and download drivers during the installation process. \nApple's web site reports your Mac can only run 32 bit XP, Vista and Windows 7. This probably is not true. You have a 2.0 GHZ Core 2 Duo 2.0 processor. I am writing this answer on a 2007 iMac with a 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo processor. The operating systems is Windows 10 Pro 64 bit. Apple is not entirely wrong. The Boot Camp Assistant will not let you install the newer Windows operating systems, but you don't have to use the Boot Camp Assistant. I guess your complaint is the Boot Camp Assistant version that comes with El Captain OS X 10.11 will not let you install the older XP operating system. Again, the Boot Camp Assistant is just an assistant used to make windows easier to install. It does not have to be used.\n\nA: You can install Windows XP along with OS X El Capitan using a swap disk trick. You will need to have both a Windows XP cd-rom and Windows 7/8/10 DVD, and a USB drive. You will also need the original Mac OS X DVD that came with your Mac Mini to install the Windows XP drivers. If you don't have the Mac OS X disc that came with your Mac Mini, you can download the drivers from the Apple site.\n\n\n*\n\n*First insert the Windows 7 DVD, and a blank USB Thumb Drive into\nyour Mac Mini.\n\n*Then launch the Boot Camp Assistant.\n\n*Continue to proceed with Boot Camp and allow it to download the software and also selecting the size for your partition.\n\n*When the Boot Camp Assistant is finished with partitioning the hard drive, it will reboot; when it does, immediately hold down the 'OPTION' key. When the Mac Mini reboots, you will be taken to a screen where you can decide what to boot to. At this point, eject the Windows 7/8/10 DVD,\nand insert the Windows XP cd-rom. Wait a few seconds and the cd-rom\nwill appear on the screen. Select it and press 'Enter' to boot to\nit.\n\n*From here, you will install Windows XP as normal, ensure that\nwhen you go to select the drive to install, select the drive labeled\nas BOOTCAMP. Once you have selected the BOOTCAMP partition, you can\ndo a quick format to NTFS. Do not try to re-partition or delete the\npartition.\n\n*Just go through the rest of the installation process\nas normal.\n\n*Once Windows XP is installed, you will need to insert the Mac Mini's Mac OS X Install DVD that came with your Mac Mini to install the Windows XP Drivers.\n\n*Once that is complete, you will need to update the 'Boot Camp Control Panel' utility on Windows XP by launching the 'Apple Software Update' program found on the Start menu. Continue to run the update, until it no longer finds updates for the 'Boot Camp Control Panel' utility and the 'Apple Software Update'.\n\n*To boot back to your OS X, you can either reboot the Mac\nMini and hold the 'Option' key to select your OS X partition, or you\ncan launch the 'Boot Camp Control Panel' from the task bar, and on\nthe 'Startup Disk' tab, select 'Mac OS X on disk 1' and click\n'Restart'. If you do not see 'Mac OS X' listed as a startup system,\nensure that you have updated the Boot Camp Control Panel as\ndescribed in the previous step.\n\n\nA: I needed to run Windows XP because of one particular program which doesn't run on more modern versions of Windows. I have just discovered that the easiest and cheapest way of installing XP on a Mac is to download \"VirtualBox\" which is free and open-source, and use my XP installation disk which also has a valid product key. The procedure was extremely easy and I don't know of any advantage in buying products such as VMware or Parallels.\n", "Q: Getting high ping when MacBook Air is connected to Wi-Fi I have a 13\" MacBook Air with Yosemite 10.10.2 installed:\n\nAs soon as I connect it to my WiFi, I get a very high ping (1600 ms) on both my machines: Windows 7 PC and my MacBook. As a result browsing becomes very difficult. I ping 8.8.8.8!\nBut if I disconnect my MacBook ping becomes normal (70-80 ms) on Windows PC. I've checked ping by disconnecting my PC, restarted my modem-router, switched off Bluetooth on my Mac. \nI've a modem + router D-Link 2750u on the ground floor wired to TP Link 740N on the first floor. I've tried connecting only to 2750u also by switching off 740N. I've been using this setup for last 4-5 months, but the issue has started since couple of weeks back. \nWhat else I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Setting DNS to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4\n\n*Deleting cache.db file from com.apple.safari \n\n*Booted in safe mode and restarted back. In safe boot mode I get the usual ping of 70-80 ms but after restarting and booting in normal mode the ping returns back to 1600 ms.\n\n\nHow do I solve this issue?\n\nA: I was frustrated with a symptom which was : \n\n\n*\n\n*High and spiking ping between 1ms to 9000ms \n\n*full bar signal but 50%++ loss ping packet\n\n*RSSI < -70db with 5-7 m distance from wifi router\n\n*Conflicting country code\n\n*Safari loading time takes forever, slow loading website (maybe due to loss packet)\n\n\nWhat I have done was : \n\n\n*\n\n*Restarting, reconfigure network setting, reconfigure router, diagnose network, deleting lot of plist ---> the symptom still there. \n\n*resolving COUNTRY CODE CONFLICT --- I was thinking that those symptom occur because CC conflict, thus I was editing the country code to be X2 by changing airportbrcm4331 (my case MacBook Air 2011) --> success but the ping still high. lot of article discuss how to do it. \n\n*So I think that there was a something wrong with antenna not the modem because there are no indication of wifi failure. so I did a DIY open MBA, check the modem, and find out that the antenna connector loose and not plugged  properly. plug it... put back things...\nand voila everything works like charm. low ping, fast Safari response and works like it suppose to be :D\n\nA: Assuming you don’t drop packets then checking if your ping is fast and stable to the WiFi access point is the key test. \nIf so, you have a routing and downastream network issue. If not, it’s interference or a radio / baseband issue. Pinging google shows that somewhere you have a buffering or throttling if the packet loss is low, not that WiFi is implicated. \n", "Q: How to upgrade brew ssh after recent client exploit?

Running El Capitan with British keyboard layout.  I have enabled Chines Simplified Pinyin input.  I am trying to type the tone marks.  For example, pressing opt+a followed by u is supposed to produce ū.  This doesn't work however.  Any advice?\nI have seen mentions of US Extended Keyboard or ABC extended keyboard layout as being the culprit.  While this makes 0 sense to me, I have replaced the British layout with this ABC Extended one.  While now I can type the accented characters in it, they still don't work in Pinyin.  This is extremely annoying.\n\nA: If your purpose is to type Latin script pinyin, then ABC Extended is the right keyboard.  Chinese Pinyin input is only for Chinese script and does not use tone marks.\n", "Q: Is there a USB brick / portable battery that will work with the MacBook (2015+, USB-C) and regular USB? ?I have the early 2015 MacBook with USB-C charger. I want to have one brick for that AND my iPhone. I also bought a USB-A to USB-C cable, but I can't find a USB-A brick with enough power to charge my laptop. Is there a brick (or preferably portable battery) that will allow this\n\nA: If your goal is to have one charging brick, then buy Apple’s USB-C to lightning cable. The you can use your MacBook’s charging adapter to charge either the MacBook or the iPhone. \n\nA: Have you chance to check this folks: https://www.powertraveller.com ?\nFor instance, this product may be helpful: https://www.powertraveller.com/en/shop/portable-chargers/professional/powergorilla/\nHope this helps.\n\nA: This Zendure 5-port USB-C Hub Portable Charger (45 watts) should pretty much meet every requirement you can think of, including concurrently charging other devices while charging a MacBook.  Charges both legacy USB devices as well as the newer USB-C ones such as MacBook Pros- Oh, and you can even use it as a hub apparently (I haven't tried this yet however)\nPlease note the USB cable used with the USB brick/batter makes a HUGE difference in charging performance.  I spent ages researching cables and the Anker USB-C to USB-C Thunderbolt 3.0 Fast Charging and Data Transfer Cable (19.7 in) gives me a full 19.8 volts- the same voltage when using the 87 watt Apple Power Adapter- vs about 5v for the cheap USB cables.  Cable is barely 1.5 feet long, so can't be placed too far from your MacBook.\nWhy not use an Apple USB-C/Thunderbolt cable? Because it received 1-star reviews in the Apple Store, so I started looking on Amazon and found this Anker USB-C cable which had 4.5 starts for 31 reviews on Amazon.co.uk.\nIn below pictures is included one of the Xendure X6 charging my 2018 MacBook with the Anker USB-C cable:\n\n\n\n", "Q: iOS 9.2 double touch fingerprint sensor I was messing around this morning and found that if I quickly double touch (NOT double-click) the fingerprint sensor on my iPhone 6S+ (iOS 9.2), the current app (or the home screen) slides down to the bottom half-screen, showing a blurred home screen background on the top half.  It doesn't matter if I use a finger that the sensor recognizes.  It goes back to normal after about 8 seconds or if you double-touch again, but I can't figure out what this mode is for??  Is this a bug or some hidden feature I haven't heard about yet?\n\nA: It's a feature!  It's so you can reach the upper part of the screen with you thumb.

It can be saved (remembered) or unknown, preferably in Apple Script or via Automator.\nI have done this on a Windows PC through the following command:\nnetsh wlan add profile wifi.xml user=current\n\n(creating it, as the only available wifi network, would attempt to connect to it)\nThe real problem I am having is: I have a Mac Book, OSX 10.10, shared by two users. One user should be able to access (and preferably connect by default) to SSID \"Wifi1\" and the second user should be able to access SSID \"Wifi2\", but neither user should connect to the other user's wifi. The Windows netsh wlan with option user=current accomplishes this but I don't see this being supported on a Mac.\nDisabling SSID remembering, and having the users type the password in each time, would of course accomplish this goal but I'm searching for a more automated solution.\nI have not found a way to accomplish this via preferences, wifi priorities, remembering networks, or anything else. \nAlso to note, Fast User Switching is enabled (this appears to make scripting difficult in my research because there is no reliable trigger or event to listen to for the script to run).\n\nA: This should do it, although it may need some modification. Every time a user switches, a system log entry is created. Knowing this, you can monitor for user switches quite effortlessly:\nglobal wifi_device\non run\n    set wifi_device to do shell script \"networksetup -listallhardwareports|grep -A1 'Wi-Fi'|grep Device|sed 's;Device: ;;'\"\nend run\non idle\n    set user_name to do shell script \"tail -n0 -f /var/log/system.log|grep -om1 'context values set for .*'|sed -e 's;context values set for ;;'\"\n    if user_name is equal to \"presaccount\" then\n        do shell script \"networksetup -setairportnetwork \" & wifi_device & \" presaccount_network password\"\n    else if user_name is equal to \"other_account\" then\n        do shell script \"networksetup -setairportnetwork \" & wifi_device & \" other_account_network password\"\n    end if\n    return 1\nend idle\n\nJust change the network names, passwords, and account names to whatever you need them to be.\nBasically, we're checking for the log entry containing \"context values set for\", which occurs on every switch, and contains the username switched to. We use this username to determine which network to join, and that's it! I'd recommend only allowing admins to change the wifi network in system preferences. This actually uses nearly no resources, because the script cannot continue past the first line, until a user switches. Keep in mind that this was done on 10.11. I can't verify if the log entry is present on 10.10, so YMMV. You'll have to save this as a stay-open app in Script Editor.\n\nA: My idea (based on this) is a bit different than William's.\nIt doesn't work with Fast User Switching but maybe one could use parts of William's stuff to mix it in.\nThis shell script should be placed in /usr/local/bin executable and owner root. The different locations (in Network Preferences) must have the names of the users and must be configured/populated. Also proper names of user1/2 and the SSID1/2 have to be set. It may also need some other improvements/modification.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# automatically change location and ssid based on user\n\n# redirect all IO to /dev/null (comment this out if you want to debug)\n# exec 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null\n\n# get a little breather before we get data for things to settle down\nsleep 2\n\n# get/set various system information\nDEVICEEN=\"networksetup -listallhardwareports|grep -A1 'Wi-Fi'|grep Device|sed 's;Device: ;;'\"\nCURRENT_USER=$USER\nSSID1=wifi1\nSSID2=wifi2\n\n# basic pattern matching to get all location names separated by newlines\nLOCATION_NAMES=`scselect | tail -n +2 | cut -d \"(\" -f 2 | cut -d \")\" -f 1`\nCURRENT_LOCATION=`scselect | grep \" \\* \" | cut -d \"(\" -f 2 | cut -d \")\" -f 1`\n\n# no brackets as the grep will return a status code depending on whether the SSID has an own Location\nif echo \"$LOCATION_NAMES\" | egrep -q \"^$CURRENT_USER$\"; then\n  NEW_LOCATION=\"$CURRENT_USER\"\nelse\n  # auto does not seem to be working on Mac OS X Lion, but Automatic does\n  if echo Automatic | grep -q \"$LOCATION_NAMES\"; then\n    NEW_LOCATION=Automatic\n  elif echo auto | grep -q \"$LOCATION_NAMES\"; then\n    NEW_LOCATION=auto\n  else\n    echo \"Automatic location was not found!\"\n    echo \"The following locations are known:\"\n    echo \"$LOCATION_NAMES\"\n  fi\nfi\n\nif [ \"x$NEW_LOCATION\" != \"x\" -a \"x$NEW_LOCATION\" != \"x$CURRENT_LOCATION\" ]; then\n    echo \"Changing to $NEW_LOCATION\"\n    scselect \"$NEW_LOCATION\"\nfi\n\nif [ \"$NEW_LOCATION\" = \"user1\" ]; then\n    echo \"Changing to $SSID1\"\n    networksetup -setairportnetwork \"$DEVICEEN\" \"$SSID1\"\nelif [ \"$NEW_LOCATION\" = \"user2\" ]; then\n    echo \"Changing to $SSID2\"\n    networksetup -setairportnetwork \"$DEVICEEN\" \"$SSID2\"\nelse\n    echo \"SSID was not found!\"\nfi\n\nThe shell script has to be started by a launch agent plist in /Users/$User/Library/LaunchAgents.\nSetting networksetup -setairportnetwork en1 \"$SSID1/2\"doesn't work properly for me. This might be solved by disabling SSID remembering and adding the Wi-Fi password in the networksetup... commands.\n", "Q: How to turn-off the heuristic guessing of (kanji + okurigana) while doing Japanese input?

What I want to do is to list all files which are either rar or r* extension type and copy them from those respective folder to a new folder. \n\nA: It's very easy to do, \nThe * acts as a wildcard so that we are copying every files that has .r in it ie 133.rar or 123.r99.\nThe cp function more properly looks like this\ncp /path/from/*.r* /path/to\n\nEdit: upon re reading the question you will want to add the recursive tag -R\ncp -R /path/from/*.r* path/to\n\nMore specifically for you\ncp -R /Users/UserName/Downloads/Downloaded_Path/*.r* new/path/location\n\nAdditionally what you can do to list all these files as well is\nls  /Users/UserName/Downloads/Downloaded_Path/*.r*\n\nls allows for some tags to give you more information about the files being listed. -a -l -t\nOr -alt all together. -a shows all files including the files starting with .

I just installed Intellij idea on Mac OS El Capitan and it is acting weird. This issue is only in Intellij so i am assuming that perhaps i have messed up with some key mapping ?? \nFor example, Whenever I double click on a text, it selects (as expected) but then moving a cursor acts as if i am holding shift while moving the text and hence it selects everything. To undo this behaviors, I have to do a single click somewhere before i can move cursor. \nAlso, pressing Shift + Arrow keys (left/right) doesn't select the text, rather it jumps from one word to another. I can only select text from keyboard in intellij with Options + Shift + Left/Right Arrow or CTRL + Shift + Left/Right Arrow. \nWhat i have done ?

I have an iPad 3 and use Infuse and VLC to play videos on my iPad. Now I am having a weird issue. I am trying to play a TV series that a friend gave to me. The files are mkv. The resolution is 1280x718, which is surprising, as file size is only 90 MB for a 25 min video. Now when I play these videos on my iPad, the video sort of freezes every second. They play fine on my PC. I tried using both infuse and vlc but same issue. I think the files must be compressed in some way, as I have seen that 25 min of a 1280x720 video can be upto 400 MB in size, I have played such videos on my iPad, and they play fine.\n\nA: Your suspicions on a 90mb file not being HD are correct. A 25 minute show that is HD would not be 90mb. Hell, that's even small for standard definition quality. Resolution and file size are very different. You can have a video file that is super compressed, but still runs in a higher resolution. The end-result will be a wide & tall, but blurry, picture quality. \nAs for why they are freezing on your iPad, it's possible that the conversion settings were a little off when someone created this file. I think this based on the small file size, mixed with high resolutions. It sounds like someone was trying very had to make a small file size and probably tweaked a bunch of settings on the export file to do so. It's possible the software you are trying to render it with (VLC, Infuse) are struggling to interpret the file.

I have photos syncing on my iPhone(16gb), my MacBook Pro(240gb), and in the cloud of course. \nMy issue is that I have 12 photos on my phone that are not syncing to the cloud. I am on WiFi, the phone is fully charged, and they are just stuck on my phone. I've looked on my MBP and they aren't there. I've looked on the iCloud via the web app and they aren't there.\nWhen I go on my phone to iCloud / Photos, the message says \"Low Disk Space - Uploading 12 Photos\" I have 163mb of free space on my phone, and 125gb of free space in iCloud.\nMy Question is, is there a way that I can manually clear the cache of photos that have downloaded to my phone. I have 750mb used in the \"Photos & Camera\" application, and I am sure a good chunk of that is from me browsing old photos which are temporarily downloaded to the phone for viewing. When I typically look at my library on my phone, the photos start off as empty white squares and that's okay. I've looked at a bunch, and it downloads thumbnails and lower res images of the files. Can I clear these caches to free up some space? \nAlso, I've read that the system requires at least 300mb of free space on your phone to upload photos to the cloud. Is this true? I can't see why this would be a requirement. \n\nA: Apple doesn't list a required/minimum free space, so you'd need to work with Apple support to get that sorted. As for the cache, you've already done all you can.\niOS has several low storage warnings it sends to each and every app to clean up cached files and with < 500 MB of free space, I'd wager you've exercised those limits continuously and it's surprising to me if this is the only thing that is broken on your device right now.\nI would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete one or two large apps that you know the data is safe/unimportant. Try to get 2 GB of free space if you can but 1 GB of free storage should be sufficient.\n\n*Power off the device and power it on to let system cache files re-generate\n\n*Open photos on the device and on iCloud and see if normal operations resume. I've had good luck with photo libraries coming back from all sorts of intentional abuse like you've unintentionally performed. It can take 24 hours or more (if you hit any upload limits) for the cleanup script(s) to trigger so you might wait 48 hours to see if the added space lets iOS complete the upload work that is queued.\n\n\nAlso, Apple does offer debugging profiles for iOS cloud sync if you call in for support and if their \"cookbook\" method doesn't yield results. If your case get escalated to engineering specific error messages contained in the debug logs can often assist you in further diagnosing why all the photos are not syncing.\nYou could also just push the photos to a computer or other iOS device using AirDrop or USB and upload them to the cloud from another device and then remove iCloud Photos temporarily from your iPhone to allow enough space to resume normal operations and then re-enable the library with the option to reduce file size.\nBasically, the system is designed to stop working when there isn't enough space for temporary files to work. This is the same design as OS X and other unix in general.\nThese operating systems use free storage space to cache things and make your experience better by accelerating slow resources like network and CPU by saving work when it's done to reuse it later. When you deprive the system of that buffer, things slow and eventually stop.\n\nA: The \"one weird trick\" that works regularly for me is to attempt to rent a large movie in iTunes. Go find a movie that you know won't fit on your phone. Before actually charging you for the movie iTunes will attempt to free up enough disk space to download it.\nYou can actually try this several times. Some times it doesn't work at all, but often times it will free up a few hundred MB and then you can immediately try again and free up a few hundred more. Each time iTunes will fail to rent the movie due to low disk space, but it will still have cleared a lot of cache in the process.\n\nA: Go to youtube, search \"One Weird Trick to Free Up Storage Space on iPhone\", site under iTwe4kz.  I searched for a while and finally found the solution in this guy's youtube channel, published Mar 28, 2016.\n", "Q: Dragging and dropping a file onto a Terminal window doesn’t escape the path under zsh 5.2 Under OS X you can drag and drop a file from the Finder (or anywhere else) onto a Terminal window and the file’s path will be inserted as if you had typed it in. Recently, filenames with spaces have stopped being handled correctly: if the file path contained spaces before, the Terminal would get a version enclosed in double quotes or else with each space preceded by a backslash. Now the entire file path is just dumped in, and if it contains any spaces then I have to go back and escape them myself.\nI have played around with the “shells open with” setting and it seems that the correct escaping happens when the shell is /bin/bash (GNU bash 3.2.57(1)-release) or /bin/zsh (zsh 5.0.8) but not when the shell is my manually-installed /usr/local/bin/zsh (zsh 5.2). I’m on OS X 10.11.2.\nWas there a change in zsh that could have messed up dragging and dropping in Terminal? Or is Terminal itself using some kind of whitelist of shells that doesn’t include my zsh?\nEdit: I installed zsh 5.0.8 at /usr/local/bin/zsh and filenames are escaped properly for that shell. It seems that some change to zsh between versions 5.0.8 and 5.2 made this stop working.\n\nA: This behavior seems to be caused by zsh’s bracketed paste feature, which is on by default as of version 5.1. I found that if I added\nunset zle_bracketed_paste\n\nto my zshrc then dropping files onto Terminal works correctly with zsh 5.2.\n(This blog post mentions bracketed-paste-magic, which seems like it could be used to support dropping files without turning off the entire bracketed paste feature. I think you would need to write code to make that happen, though; simply turning on bracketed-paste-magic didn’t fix my problem.)\n\nA: As mentioned in @bdesham’s answer, Zsh 5.1 introduced the use of the terminal's “Bracketed Paste Mode,” which allows terminal-based programs to differentiate pasted/dragged text from the user typing individual characters.\nTerminal (at least as of OS X El Capitan 10.11.x) doesn't perform shell-quoting of pasted/dragged file pathnames when Bracketed Paste Mode is on, because prior to Zsh 5.1 BPM was only used by full-screen editors like Emacs and Vim, which don't normally need shell-quoting.\nYou can force shell-quoting to be applied when pasting/dragging by pressing the Control modifier key.\n", "Q: Migrate 1 TB of iMovie '11 to iMovie 10.x if migration requires twice the disk space? I have about 1 TB of movies in iMovie '11 (version 9.x) format, and I need to migrate this library to iMovie 10.x now.\nThis process is described here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/HT202853\nHowever, the page above says that \"copies of the original iMovie Projects and iMovie Events folders are left in place\". My library is stored on an external drive which is pretty much full.\nWhen I press Update in the iMovie dialog box (Do you want to update your projects and events?), it looks like iMovie is going to copy my old libraries, and therefore require double the space I have on the disk. My little MacBook Air's disk doesn't help.\nWhat do I need to do to migrate this library?\n\nA: Convert to the internal drive, and as movies are converted, delete from external, and move there. \nIf your drives are getting this full, it's time to consider an update. 3TB externals are sub $100. \n", "Q: Selective message notifications Can you turn off all notifications (text, email, phone, etc) but a selective few senders at night?

Sometimes when I unlock my iPhone 6s 64Gb with iOS 9.2 the time display at the top of the screen flashes or the whole display at the top of the screen (signal strength time and battery) takes a second to appear. This seems to happen only after not using the phone for more than 30 seconds. Ex. I put the phone on standby, unlock it one minute later. It also seems to happen more often when I use the fingerprint scanner to unlock it, not as much when I enter my passcode, and when I unlock the phone quickly like unlocking from standby with a fingerprint rather than waking the phone up first and then unlocking it.

How to print onto virtual letter paper which exists as PDF?\nNew to the Mac OS X world and with MACs. From the windows world I have a virtual letter paper with my e.g. logo, headers, footers existing as a PDF file.\nI would need to be able to universally print onto this existing PDF, as if it were e.g. physically from a printing shop and inserted into my real physical printers paper tray.\nHaving now looked around in the Apple and MAC world, I kind of lack a way to use that \"save pdf\" or generate PDF file that is built-in to the OS X operating system itself, but pre-merge and mix it with my vector/pixels of my own supplied PDF virtual letter paper resulting in a nice official document e.g. for business cases and such stuff.\nI read about OS X automator and even pdftk and all, and on Windows it is really simple by means for example of a virtual printer.\nBut on the Apple platform, it seems that there is just no way to put a background (my virtual letter paper coming from my own PDF) properly beneath anything I would like to print, as Apple or any application seems to put white pixels (instead of transparency) when they generate via their own OS X built-in means to generate that PDF.\nWhat am I missing here? What if I wanted to for example print to a blue paper or a green paper as the most simple examples of this use-case? The Apple system or any app(lication) on it, seems to always generate a non-transparent and white-pixeled virtual paper, where my own virtual letter paper cannot compete with and cannot shine through.\nAlso via the automator I only found ways to stamp onto the saved PDF (thats fine for stamps saying such stuff as specimen, or example, or draft and such things) and printing below (underneath) of the actual document would be kind of near impossible because of that opaque white generated pixels/paper of the OS X system itself.\nAlso the automator only allows for images/pixel files to be used as stamp ontop/below, and my letter paper comes as PDF / vectorised already.\nIs there really no concept on current MAC OS X to mix during the built-in way to generate PDFs with my own pre-defined document / PDF? Or is there no virtual printer driver software which would do this in its own way on the mac platform?\nAny existing product for the MAC OS X platform I could buy?

I have problem with iCloud backup on my iPhone. After several calls to the Russian department of Apple support they suggest me to change my AppleID password temporarily to an test password proposed by the support specialist to see what's going on with my account. Also they say that they get access to all my data stored on phone: messages, photo, apps data etc, and I should agree with this terms. \nOf course they say usually engineers don't read/watch users data, but  I think it's weird to grant access to all my data. \nShould I trust them and share my pretty photos, banking apps and personal chats? I'm pretty sure I have talked with the official Apple support, not scammers. \n\nA: In a word, NO.  No-one reputable will EVER ask for your password, EVER.  Proper support have the tools and such in place to allow them the access they need to do what they need.  If they have to actually login as you (Which clearly they can only do from a different device anyway, limiting any usefulness it may even have) then surely there is nothing they need to do that for which they can't simply ask you to replicate for them without handing over credentials.  I smell a rat.\n\nA: I used to work for Apple support, both iPhone and Mac, both first and second level (\"Senior Advisor\" to the outside world).\nWithout knowing all the details, here's my reaction:\n\n\n*\n\n*Support operations that Apple runs in other countries than the United States can rarely have some different support procedures, but this one sounds too far out of bounds. Keep in mind that some Apple support centers are actually third party call centers on contract, I have worked at one of those as well, they are not as trustworthy as Apple employees. Not to over generalize but they have less to lose and poor working conditions.\n\n*As a first-level support person, we never knew customer passwords and I was frustrated when people told me their passwords, I would stop them mid-way through and tell them I don't want to know.\n\n*There is a process if you get deep into a problem with a senior advisor, where they setup a test account for you. Keyword, they set it up for you, they should never ask you to create a second account yourself or ask for your password to your account.\nNow if you are dealing with a true Senior Advisor at Apple they are supposed to give you their contact info and the shift they work, so in theory you should be able to verify this.\nHaving said that, if they asked you to change your password on your account, it was a verifiable hack attempt. \nAnd as a newb, I can't comment on other answers, but in response to the one comment, everyone can generate a support PIN when they log into appleid.apple.com and I hate the new interface there.\n\nA: I've dealt with deep-rooted issues on my iCloud account, and I have been asked by Senior Advisors (in the US) for permission to put my account into Troubleshooting mode, which requires that they provide you with a temporary password so they can access your account and see what's going on with it.\nTalking with various Senior Advisors over the course of a few weeks that my account was in Troubleshooting mode, everyone knew what I was referring to, including the Corporate Executive Relations Office. This is definitely not a scam, although you are were right to be suspicious. This is a step you should only accept if you are comfortable with granting Apple Support full access to your iCloud account. This is normally a last resort for Apple Support.\nIf you have two-step or two-factor authentication on your account, an Apple Diagnostics device should appear in the list of Trusted Devices shortly thereafter.\nPoint of interest: the second or third time I've had to have my account put into Troubleshooting mode, I asked if I could simply hand them my password (it was already a temporary password, but due to a screwup on their part, my account was out of Troubleshooting mode). The Senior Advisor declined, citing policy that they must provide a randomly-generated password and could not accept a password from a customer. This is a very important point, because I get the impression from the reactions/answers that people think the support technician is asking @Oleg for his password. That is NOT the case.\nI feel I should also add that yes, I am 100% certain I was talking to Apple employees the entire time. I contacted them through the Apple Support site, they called me back from the same Apple number every time, which I have saved in my Contacts, and every technician I was in touch with emailed me from an @apple.com address, to which I was able to send emails and get responses from (so that takes care of spoofed headers). They're able to Screen Share just by knowing your Apple ID but not your IP address, then ask you to upload diagnostics data to green header address ending in apple.com. It would take a very high degree of sophistication to pull off a scam of this magnitude (not to mention, if all they cared about was accessing your iCloud account, they could just stop once they got your password instead of spending hours upon hours going through troubleshooting steps that don't get them any additional data about you).\nAnd obviously, when you get a response from the Corporate Executive Relations Office after emailing Tim Cook directly, you're pretty confident it's an Apple employee talking to you (the response includes your original email). If that person acknowledges that your account is in Troubleshooting mode and understands that you would like to get it out of it, then you're also pretty confident that Troubleshooting mode is a real thing.\nI am in no way defending Apple's tech support procedures, just saying that yes, when all else fails, the company does ask to set a temporary password on your account. This allows the engineers to go in and troubleshoot themselves. This is definitely a legitimate scenario.\n\nA: Absolutely do not trust them. There are a number of things that the real Apple Support would never do over the phone:\n\n*\n\n*Ask for your Apple ID password\n\n*Ask for your iCloud password or credentials\n\n*Ask for verification codes to provide you support\n\n*Ask you to enter your information on a non-Apple website\n\nThere's a bunch of other things to look out for - good summary over here - theres a video in the article showing a real call too - might sound familiar if you've been on the phone to them!\n", "Q: Set time restrictions for certain websites even on admin Is there a way to set time restrictions per day on certain websites like YouTube on my own admin account?

WasteNoTime is/was inspired by LeechBlock.\nThe extension (I only tested it in Chrome) is adequately adjustable by using blacklists and whitelists.\nBy adding chrome://extensions to the block list you can even hinder yourself disabling or uninstalling the extension. \nThese extensions are not infallible though: you can still just remove it using the Finder.\n\nA: Try Freedom service.

I would be very grateful if you could help me clarify - I used to use a software program for recording vinyl mixes on my old Macbook called - Audacity. Recently I've replaced this old Mac with a new Macbook Pro which does not have a phono jack, \"line in” port, only a USB port and the same software does not pick up the sound any more, from my vinyl mixes. \nDo you know a way to get my new Mac to accept the sound from the original phono outputs of the same mixer to the new USB port? I've already bought the generic cable and can't get it to recognise the new USB port as an official input. \nYour guidance is greatly appreciated, as there is no current USB input availabilty option within the generic Mac settings - under \"sound\" settings. This basically means I can not work out how to accept input, via USB & I can not record, until I solve this problem?\n\nA: You just need a quality digital audio interface for your Mac.\nThe one I personally use and have had great success with has been the Behringer UCA202 Audio Interface. This installs with no drivers required El Capitan recognizes it as a USB audio input/output device.\nI have used it with just the System audio as well as with Audacity and it works flawlessly.\n\nSince you said that you use a phono plug, you will likely need a phono to RCA adapter like the one below. Fortunately, these are relatively inexpensive (around $5 USD)\n\n\nA: To record audio from analogue audio equipment, you're going to need to buy a little audio interface that plugs into the USB port of you Macbook.\nHere is a sampling of interfaces that should do the trick. Not all of them are cheap, but if you use it a lot, it's a good investment.\nIf you get one, you can plug your mixer into it using standard audio cables.\n", "Q: Disk utility will not allow me to resize a partition on an unencrypted external hard drive I want to back up a copy of Windows onto a new partition of external hard drive currently formatted in exFAT. I don't know how to use Windows, so I want to use my Mac (mid-2009 MacBook Pro, running Mavericks, which it shouldn't be—it was built for Snow Leopard) to repartition the disk. \nBut it doesn't seem to let me. The name, format, volume size, and \"+\" are all grayed out, and the little handle that is supposed to let me resize the partition so as to add a new one in the remaining space is not showing up. (Actually, I have two such hard drives. In one of them, the \"minus\" option isn't available either.) Neither shows up as encrypted; other answers to similar problems tend to depend on the drives being internal or encrypted, so it seems this is a different problem. Here are pictures of my interface for both.\n\n\nActually, my question looks similar to this one: osx split external hard drive partition\nIs it the case that one can only repartition hard drives using the Mac OS format?\n\nA: There's no such thing as \"Built for Snow Leopard\". That labeling just an old habit PC manufacturers have for Windows, but it doesn't apply to Macs at all. If Apple lets you run the OS, that means they tested it, and should work just fine. The reason you can't resize those disks is because they are formatted as \"ExFAT\", and OS X doesn't support resizing ExFAT formatted disks.\n", "Q: Sort folders first, then files [El Capitan] I am aware there are many posts about this problem, but many are just workarounds for Finder. However I use console more often then Finder because of programming. \nI am also aware of something like this (after getting coreutils):\nalias ll='gls -la -h --group-directories-first'\nBut thats just another 'plugin' or external utility, which does the job well but doesn't answer my question. \nI also found out that Dropbox web also sorts your files according to the User Agent. If it is changed from the Develop menu in Safari to IE or Firefox/Chrome (Widows) then it sorts folders first.\nI get that OS X and Windows must be rebels so they use different sorting but frankly it's a mess when you got plenty files and they all get mixed up. \nDoes OS X have a system wide setting for this so when I type ls -la output is sorted folders first then files and both are alphabetically ascending (a to z)? Or is the sorting mechanism related to the implementation of program/application which is displaying files?\n\nA: I think the simple answer is no, if the question is whether the native ls command can be configured to list directories before it lists non-directories. One of the comments suggests a shell pipeline, but rather than going to that trouble it might be easier to write a script.\nThe following python code is by no means intended to be a complete substitute for the ls command, but complicating it to handle more of what ls provides feels doable (python's argparse module would help with that).\n#!/usr/bin/python                                                                                                                                                                    \n\nimport os\nimport sys\n\nfor top in sys.argv[1:]:\n    for (name, dirs, files) in os.walk(top):\n        print(\"{}:\".format(name))\n        for dir in dirs:\n            print(\"{}/\".format(dir))\n        for file in files:\n            print(file)\n\nWhat makes the separation of directories from non-directories easy in this example is that python's os.walk does that for me, in its return value. The use of os.walk implicitly imposes the equivalent of ls -R, but that should be easy to fix by adapting code from os.walk, which is native python code built on top of os.listdir and os.path.isdir, rather than invoking os.walk directly.\nWith respect to the question of native capabilities versus external utilities, python is native to recent releases of MacOS. Where scripting like this ranks compared to pulling in external functionality is a matter of taste.\nThere might be an invocation of find which fits your criteria, similar to the ls pipeline in a comment, using the -type option in multiple invocations of find, but to me that feels clumsy compared to python code.\n", "Q: Can a 3.7 Watt LiPo battery trigger the charging symbol on an iPhone? I am trying to use a 3.7 Volt 1 Amp (so it's 3.7 Watts) Lithium Polymer battery to charge or at least trigger the charging symbol on an iPhone 5. I have charged the battery fully using the Lithium Polymer Battery charger. I plan on connecting the black and red wires on the battery with the black and red wires inside a lightning cable. Then, I will plug this lightning cable into the phone. I do not care how fast or how long it takes to charge the phone. I would just like to know if it will at least trigger the charging battery symbol on the iPhone. From what I heard, 2.5 Watts to 5 Watts with 1 Amp is enough to charge an iPhone 5, but I cannot find anywhere whether the iPhone detects this charging. I know my USB port in my older 2006 PC which only gives off 2.5 Volts can trigger it, so I believe a newer battery can easily do it.\nAll help is appreciated.\n\nA: It will not work. iPhones use USB and require 5 volts. They do have a margin of error and I have measured as low as 4.6 Volts being recognized, but 3.7 is too low. \n", "Q: Making Terminal bash auto-complete stop at ambiguous character and display all possible options The behavior I see happening is that when I type something partially and hit TAB, if there are multiple files/commands that match what I had typed in, only the first one is displayed.

I've totally crashed my system yesterday after installing bootcamp/windows 8.1 (bad partition format). Fortunately, I have a full backup Time Machine on a Drobo 5D (firewired). Since Drobo 5D need specific drivers to read data, I could not reinstalling the OS from Time Machine Backup.\nSo I have reinstalled a fresh OSX El Capitan from scratch. After created the user and installing drobo drivers, I have bound the Drobo 5d Time Machine backup Disk to the Time Machine OSX service. I've done this because I though it was the way to do it...

I have a Dell E207WFP connected to an Early 2015 11\" MacBook Air on Yosemite (10.10.5) (then upgraded to El Capitan 10.11.2) via a VGA cable. The monitor is documented to support 1680x1050@60Hz, but the Mac's Displays preference pane only offers 1280x1024 and 800x600. If I option-click on Scaled, it expands to offer 1920x1080, 1400x1050, 1344x1008, 1280x1024, 1280x960, 1280x768, 1280x720, 1024x768, and 800x600, but these still don't include the monitor's actual native resolution. A 15\" Retina Early 2013 MacBook Pro running El Capitan (10.11.2) detects the monitor and its native resolution correctly over the same VGA cable.\nI tried forcing the monitor to RGB mode using the instructions at https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/106937/43392, which folks on that post said helped Dell U2713H, U2713HM, and U2711 monitors, but it didn't improve the situation for my monitor.\nThe System Information | Displays pane claims the monitor is a \"13.9-inch (800 x 600)\", which is, of course, incorrect.\nHow can I convince the MacBook Air to use the monitor's native resolution?\n\nA: Attaching the monitor with a DVI cable instead of the VGA cable caused Mac OS to recognize the monitor and use the full resolution.\n", "Q: Do I need to get a license to use OS X system font in my app?

My external hard disk was partitioned to 3 partitions and one of which (300 GB) was set up with Time Machine. The initial back up started and was 3 hours through (around 65% of 211 GB complete). I lost track of time and my MacBook turned off on zero battery power.\nWhen I turned it back on, it says that the disk was not ejected properly. When the external hard disk was re-connected, I don't see the Time Machine icon on my TM partition any more. Time Machine status states that the backup was delayed. When I gave the \"back up now\" option, the Time Machine started normally with status 10 MB out of 85 GB. After a while, the back up was complete.\nMy question is simple: would my backup be corrupt due to this incident? Is there anything I should do to ensure it? Or is everything just fine and that there is nothing to worry about?\n\nA: It would be hard to tell with out looking at the backup. If I was in you situation and I was not sure if the first backup was successful I would wipe that partition and start again (assuming when you say initial backup you mean the first ever!)\nFrom my personal experience however when similar things have happened to me during a backup I've had no corruption issues.

A network I connect to requires configuring proxy settings to reach the Internet. \nWhen I configure those settings within the Automatic location, it applies to every network I connect to. \nIs there a way to apply those settings only to this specific network so when I connect to it those proxy settings work and when I connect to another network they do not?\n\nA: You need to make specific network configuration:\nSystem Preferences > Network > Location: > Edit Locations...\n\nleft down + button,\nenter a new netowrk configuration name, for example Office / Wi-Fi + proxy,\nchoose it and configure it with the proxy setting you need.\nYou will have to make 2 network configurations one to go through your proxy, and one without. Example: Office / Ethernet + proxy, Home / Wi-fi - proxy.\nYou will notice that you have a new menu entry:\n > Location\n\nand you will be able to choose the correct network configuration which fits your actual network use.\nTo avoid most of the problems caused by the Automatic predefined network configuration, I advise you to inactivate completly network interfaces you don't use. For example Bluetooth doesn't have to be configured and open to network access if you don't use it yourself, and you don't control who uses it. \n\nA: I know this answer is probably too late for the OP, but I'm posting this for the benefit of all people who still have this issue (like I did).\nThe original question was how to automatically change proxy settings depending on the network that you're connected to. Surprisingly, there is no native solution for this.\nAfter trying basically everything, I stumbled across this github page from Anton Eprev, who has a relatively easy solution to this.\n\n*\n\n*First, follow the instructions in @dan's answer and create a separate network location with your proxy settings. You must name this location the same exact name as the SSID of the network that you plan to use with these settings. You can make as many separate locations for as many proxy setups as you require.\n\n\n*Second, paste and run the following into terminal to install the script from github. (You'll have to enter your admin password.)\ncurl -L https://github.com/eprev/locationchanger/raw/master/locationchanger.sh | bash\n\nAnd that's it! The program will automatically set the network location to match the SSID of the Wi-Fi you're connected to, and default to 'Automatic' if you're on anything else. Enjoy!\n", "Q: Where does iPhone store information about current battery percentage? I wonder how is it exactly with the calculation of the battery percentage: from 100% down the software calculates which resources were used and for how long and thus it approximates the current battery state. But where is it stored - as logs, or as app data? I mean what happens with this information after hard reset or DFU mode - in DFU mode iOS is not loaded, but this software still runs? How does it know what is the percentage after switching it on again? Is charging in DFU mode still causing the software to calculate the approximate percentage?\n\nA: All of the battery and power usage information (including approximately how much power applications and certain system processes use over time) is stored in /var/mobile/Library/BatteryLife/CurrentPowerlog.PLSQL and /var/mobile/Library/BatteryLife/Archives/powerlog_*.PLSQL. This data is both used to aid in the calculation of battery percentage and to unmask power-hungry applications.\nApple's algorithm for battery percentage is based on a number of factors: the maximum capacity of the battery (known based on the battery that the iOS device was manufactured with), the remaining capacity of the battery (calculated based on Voltage), power usage over time (stored in CurrentPowerlog), and current power usage (calculated based on draw). This data is all put together to extrapolate an estimated remaining capacity which iOS displays as the battery percentage.\nWhen the iOS device is in a different mode other than iOS (such as DFU Mode or Recovery Mode), it does not store or read any information from the CurrentPowerlog database; it uses the direct method of determining the capacity of its Lithium-Ion battery: simply the Voltage that the battery is currently outputting. Take a look at a Voltage over time chart for Li-Ion batteries, and you may wish to read more information about determining capacities for Li-Ion batteries.\n", "Q: hditutil tool will not convert .iso to .img?

Both monitors work when plugged into the HDMI port, but I can't get the second monitor to work via the display port, and need clarity.\nI want to connect two 4k monitors to the laptop. I would like to connect one with the HDMI cable and the other with either mini display port or Thunderbolt.\nI was under the impression that Thunderbolt could double as mini display port, so I have tried a few different Thunderbolt cables. At least one of these cables is known-good (it works for transferring data when the machine is in target disk mode).\nSo am I wrong in thinking I should be able to use a Thunderbolt cable as a mini display port cable? (A coworker suggested there might even be a firmware update needed, but I can't corroborate that via Google.) What am I missing?\n\nA: Thunderbolt and DisplayPort are not compatible. They only share one port. Thunderbolt uses active transmission (there's a chip in the cable), DisplayPort uses a simple copper cable. You should be fine with using a DisplayPort cable.\n", "Q: How to implement SSO on Mac and IPAD We have a web application that uses SSO to authenticate users. On Windows everything works well. Now the question is how to make it work on OSX and IPAD? Is this possible in principle. I don't have much experience with OSX. Any help would be useful.\n\nA: There's a tutorial on how to setup Kerberos for OS X here: http://computing.help.inf.ed.ac.uk/kerberos-mac-os-x. After that Safari should automatically work with the SSO, Firefox & Chrome may need further settings configured.\nFor iOS devices I'm unsure, it appears that to do it it requires either the device is in an Enterprise group, or that you build it with the iOS Configurator application but it's not entirely clear on how it should be done.\n", "Q: Safe to clean iPad screen with alcohol wipe? I ordered a glass screen protector for my iPad and have just received it. In instructions, it says I have to clean the screen with the given alcohol wipe. Is it safe to use an alcohol wipe on iPad screen? I read somewhere it damages the screen...\n\nA: Alcohol can probably damage the coating on the display. I wouldn't use an alcohol-based cleaner. \nI accidentally used an alcohol-based liquid to clean my 2011 MBA's screen and the coating is visibly damaged by it.\nSee this Apple Support page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204172.\n\nA: If you need to clean your Apple hardware use a clean dry microfiber cloth.  It's what I see Apple employes using on all the equipment in the Apple stores.  I've been using microfiber for years on all my Apple devices and has worked great without any damage.\nNote:  If necessary you can slightly dampen it with distilled water and wring it out well so it is really just ever so slightly dampened and the follow up with a clean dry microfiber cloth.\n\nA: Use baby wipes.

I need to move large files (5-5Gb) from a Mac to a Linux machine.\nNetwork transfers are too slow, so I wanted to use USB drives.\nHowever filesystems seem to be a bit of a nightmare: HFS+ is hard to read on Linux, NTFS and Ext4 are hard to write on Mac.\nAny advice on what's the best way to do that?\n\nA: You can use exFAT but you may have to install the packages on Linux.  Probably along the lines of: \nsudo apt-get install exfat-fuse exfat-utils\n\nThis has the benefit of read/write in Windows as well.\n\nA: If you're only using files not bigger than 4GB and a drive smaller than 2TB, you can go with FAT32 (which also works on Windows). Otherwise I'd go with exFAT as well, but sometimes Windows gets problems writing to that as I experienced.\n", "Q: Compose key with æ, ø, å I need quick access to the Danish letters æ, ø, å while using the US keyboard-layout in OS X (I it slow to change keyboard layout all the time, my MBA has a Danish keyboard).\nI want to use right-alt (option) as the compose key, so I can get \"ø\" by typing r-alt-/-o and similar.\nI have consulted an earlier question but it is not clear if this gives me access to the Danish letters and I don't have a Linux installation to get configuration files from.\nIs there a another/newer/easier way to do it with Karabiner/Seil etc.?\n\nA: To make this work you have to use a third party tool: Karabiner.\nIn the example below holding the right option key enables the Danish keyboard layout.

I had it plugged in when downloading an iOS update and it downloaded the update over cellular data instead of home Wi-Fi. \nI understand I can turn it off manually each time by going into settings, but how can I have it not turn on automatically so that I can only turn it on manually as desired to prevent accidental usage?\n\nA: The problem isn't on your iPhone, it's on your Windows computer using the USB tether rather than Wi-Fi. You need to set the network interface priority on your Wi-Fi to be higher than the USB device, or the USB device to be lower, so that it will only use the tether if it isn't connected to Wi-Fi.\nMake sure to connect the iPhone first. Directions for Windows 7 are here (these will likely work on newer versions as well):\n\n\n*\n\n*How to change the network connection priority in Windows 7\nAlternately, you could disable the connection on your Windows computer but you'll still have to manually turn it on each time so I think the above fix will provide the result you want.\n\nA: For a Mac it's quite simple:\nWhile your iPhone is connected to your computer go into Network Preferences and remove the iPhone from the list of network interfaces.\nI’m not sure how to change the order of connections however. That would seem more useful. But this is a quick fix until you use your phone again as hotspot through USB.\n\nA: Here are instructions how to use the command line to change the priority of the network interface to get Windows to route the traffic through WIFI adapter instead of iPhone. This is tested on Windows 10. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open up PowerShell with admin rights\n\n*Use the route print to find the correct interface\n\n\n\n\n\n*Check the index (the first column) for the \"Apple mobile device ethernet\". In my case this is 25. Use then Get-NetIPInterface command to see associated metrics values for each interface\n\n\n\n\n\n*Check the InterfaceMetric value. The interfaces will be ordered using this value, so you want to change the Apple device to to use a value higher than for example your WIFI connection. In my case both Apple and WIFI share the value 35, so to guarantee the order I want to put the Apple device value to 45. \n\n*Use Set-NetIPInterface command to specify the value:\nSet-NetIPInterface -InterfaceIndex 25 -InterfaceMetric 45\n\n*Running again the route print command shows that in my case the Apple Mobile device ethernet and my WLAN adapter has now changed the positions, meaning Windows will route the traffic through the WIFI instead of via iPhone\n\n\nA: The iOS device will use use data over Personal Hotspot if it is turned on and the device is connect to a computer via USB cable. Here is the documentation from Apple: \n\nWhen your connect your iPhone or iPad to your computer with a USB\n  cable, Personal Hotspot automatically shares an Internet connection\n  with your computer. For example, when you connect your iPhone to your\n  computer to charge, your computer will use Internet from Personal\n  Hotspot on your iPhone. To avoid unnecessary data charges, turn off\n  Personal Hotspot when it isn't in use.\n\nThe only way to prevent unwanted data usage when using USB is to turn off Personal Hotspot via Settings > Personal Hotspot. \n\nA: I think the above answers are incorrect. My iphone 5S under OS 11.2.5 automatically turned on the personal hot spot feature when I connected it to my Windows 7 laptop. My daughter had a similar experience with an iphone SE and a Mac powerbook. This suggests that it has nothing to do with windows per se. It is a misfeature of recent iOS versions\n", "Q: SNB Framebuffer did not show up,unload - MBP won't boot I recently got a new MBP. My older MBP (early 2011, 13\") has some stuff on it I would like to transfer. \nI tried using migration assistant, but it appears that they need the same OS versions. I tried upgrading the old MBP to El Capitan... it seemed to go trough the process, but now the old machine will not boot. \nI can get into single user mode; I ran fsck -fy and it said everything was OK. \nWhen trying to log in, the progress bar chugs along slowly for 30 minutes or so then it reboots. \nBooting with verbose set, it seems to hang at SNB Framebuffer did not show up,unload.

Sometimes when I take it out of my bag and then its pouch, it's so cold I can barely hold it in my hands. \nI don't boot it up instantly when getting inside but it's usually sleeping nonetheless so technically turned on. I've read it's a bad idea to start using it since it could heat up too fast and condensate, but is it also harmful for the battery or for the laptop itself to expose it to low temperatures while in a bag? If so, what could be the damage and how can I avoid it?\n2) I'm always trying not to use the MacBook while it's charging. Does this matter at all? Should I charge it only when it's sleeping or turned off? How about charging time? Should it be charged only until it gets 100% or I can leave it over night?\nModel: 12″ Retina MacBook\nFabrication date: August 2015\n\nA: If you are carrying the Macbook from outside (cold) to inside (warm & humid), you may want to consider bagging the Macbook in a sealed plastic bag (Ziplock or similar), so the condensate will form on outside of the bag, not the Macbook.\nIf the Macbook is in a case, a bag, or sleeve, the case should supply some insulation to shield the Macbook from the cold for a short time.\nPhotographers in cold regions use the plastic bag trick frequently to protect their equipment.\nThe condensate problem is NOT caused by heating up too fast, it is caused by metal parts exposed to cold, dry air transferred to a warm (relatively) humid environment.  The cold surfaces, like laptop cases or lenses, act as a collection surface for the inside air water vapor.\nThe Macbook probably has a minimum operating temperature recommendation of minus 5C or so.  \nTry to avoid leaving the macbook in a place (car) where the machine will go into a cold soak as to damage the Li-polymer battery.  The battery construction is essentially a layer of foils & gels, and does not take well to deep freezing.  I had a co-worker forget a Windows laptop overnight in a pickup truck, during a -10C night, and the laptop never had useable off-mains battery life again.\nAssuming the Macbook has a SSD, the major components susceptible to cold damage are the battery, display & keyboard.\nAFAIK, you can leave the laptop charging all the times it is convenient to do so.  The harshest treatment is a daily use of deep discharge cycles, taking the battery to a low state (under 30%), then recharging to 100%, the back to 30% again. \nI'm using a 13\" MBP that I travel with, and it shows about 400 battery cycles; by comparison, an at-home 15\" MBP, plugged-in almost all the time, shows only 55 battery cycles after more than 3 yaers of use.\nIt should be perfectly OK to use the machine whilst charging.\n", "Q: AppleScript : Download to a AFP drive I try to download files to a AFP drive but always have \"Warning: Failed to create the file /Volumes/home/Downloads: Is a directory\n\"\nBut the last command work fine \n    tell application \"Finder\" to open (\"/Volumes/home/Downloads\" as POSIX file) \nset theFileURL to the clipboard\nset {TID, AppleScript's text item delimiters} to {AppleScript's text item delimiters, \"/\"}\nset theFile to text item -1 of theFileURL\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to TID\n\nset theFilePath to \"/Volumes/home/Downloads\"\ntry\n    do shell script \"curl \" & quoted form of theFileURL & \" -o \" & quoted form of POSIX path of theFilePath\n    display dialog \"The download is finished!\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with icon note giving up after 5\non error theError\n    display dialog \"Error downloading the file:\" & return & theFile & return & return & theError buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with icon 0 giving up after 5\nend try\n\n\ntell application \"Finder\" to open (\"/Volumes/home/Downloads\" as POSIX file)\n\nin the same kind of script, I'm also to download torrent to my Synology Download Station if anyone have a clue.\n\nA: The curl command in the do shell script command is malformed.  The -o option expects a filename or a fully qualified pathname filename not just a path like what the variable theFilePath contains.  See the man page for curl, in a Terminal type man curl and press enter and then scroll down to -o, --output <file> where it states: Write output to <file> instead of stdout.\nSo your do shell script command should look like:\ndo shell script \"curl \" & quoted form of theFileURL & \" -o \" & quoted form of POSIX path of (theFilePath & \"/\" & theFile)\n\nIf you include the / (slash) at the end of the value you set for the theFilePath variable e.g. set theFilePath to \"/Volumes/home/Downloads/\" you can eliminate & \"/\" from the do shell script command, which would then look like:\ndo shell script \"curl \" & quoted form of theFileURL & \" -o \" & quoted form of POSIX path of (theFilePath & theFile)\n\nAdditionally, since you have already set theFilePath you can use that in your tell application \"Finder\" statement, e.g:\ntell application \"Finder\" to open theFilePath as POSIX file\n\nIf you want Finder to trigger the opening of the file, and depending on how you set theFilePath (with or without a /) use one of the following appropriately:\ntell application \"Finder\" to open (theFilePath & \"/\" & theFile) as POSIX file\ntell application \"Finder\" to open (theFilePath & theFile) as POSIX file\n\nThe AppleScript code shown below contains both forms of the theFilePath variable and the do shell script command along with two version of the tell application \"Finder\" statement with one set commented out with the leading -- (double-dash).\nset theFileURL to the clipboard\nset {TID, AppleScript's text item delimiters} to {AppleScript's text item delimiters, \"/\"}\nset theFile to text item -1 of theFileURL\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to TID\n\n-- set theFilePath to \"/Volumes/home/Downloads\"\nset theFilePath to \"/Volumes/home/Downloads/\"\n\ntry\n    -- do shell script \"curl \" & quoted form of theFileURL & \" -o \" & quoted form of POSIX path of (theFilePath & \"/\" & theFile)\n\n    do shell script \"curl \" & quoted form of theFileURL & \" -o \" & quoted form of POSIX path of (theFilePath & theFile)\n\n    display dialog \"The download is finished!\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with icon note giving up after 5\non error theError\n    display dialog \"Error downloading the file:\" & return & theFile & return & return & theError buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with icon 0 giving up after 5\nend try\n\ntell application \"Finder\" to open theFilePath as POSIX file\n-- tell application \"Finder\" to open (theFilePath & \"/\" & theFile) as POSIX file\n-- tell application \"Finder\" to open (theFilePath & theFile) as POSIX file\n\n", "Q: Python-based app requires bypassing 'unknown developer' warning Using a Python utility called py2app, I've built a distributable .app. from a Python-based project.\nIt launches fine (when double-clicked) on my own machine, yet when tried elsewhere (other users on other Macs), the user gets warned that the application is from an unknown developer, and he/she has to jump through the hoop of holding Ctrl then right-clicking, or the less secure 'allow from anywhere' option on System Preferences.\nExcuse my ignorance, but what step(s) need to be taken such that this is not required?\n\nA: Sign up with Apple as a paid developer and you can use your Mac App signing certificate to sign that app before distributing it. Your Apple ID will then allow Apple to trace things back to you should you sign something malicious and it comes to their attention.\nYou're looking for the Mac Provisioning Certificate that Apple will sign and deliver you you from https://itunesconnect.apple.com\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/osx/distribution/\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/developer-id/\nThe alternative would be to disable gatekeeper, but I'm presuming you want to know how to have your app be accepted by many Macs without needing each one to bypass the settings globally or grant a one-time exception to your app each time you update it.\n", "Q: Is there any way to access the Photo Stream outside of Photos.app in El Capitan This is basically a duplicate of this question, which was answered for prior versions, but whose answer is no longer applicable in El Capitan.\nMy question includes programmatically: if there's a programmatic / Cocoa way to access the Photo Stream contents stored (somewhere?) on your computer, then perhaps we can build a filesystem-in-userspace or similar to access them?\n\nA: So, I've answered this for myself: iCloud Photo Library photos are buried in subfolders of \"~/Pictures/*.photoslibrary/Masters\" on El Capitan!\nUsing a savedSearch, the same approach as was popular under Yosemite and earlier, we can create a Finder folder that lists, chronologically, your Photo Stream. The XML version is here (you may have to modify some paths), or you can download my pre-compiled version instead:\n\nTa-da! \n\n", "Q: Why is my iPhone not enabled for iTunes Attempting to purchase iTunes for iPhone 6 from Apple Store.

When I receive an SMS message, I can create a new contact from the number. Works great, very useful. Lots of business folks must do the same. \nWhat I want to do is create the contact in my business CardDAV server account, not my personal contacts. There is no option to select Group. So I thought i would get clever, went into Contacts, selected \"Hide All Groups\" and made only the CardDAV account I want active. The newly minted contact from Messages is still saved in the default-by-virtue-of-being-first-in-the-list\" iCloud account. \nThere is also no good way to do this from the desktop in Messages. Creating a new contact similarly always goes into whatever happens to be first in the list of accounts (order which can't be changed after the account is installed). I can then drag the contact into the appropriate group, finally go back and delete the original. That's too many steps and opportunities for mistakes. \nDoes anyone have a reasonable workflow to get around this oversight? Or a 3rd party app recommendation? Thanks!\n\nA: Under the mail options in settings; there is a section for contacts, you will see \"default account\" change that option to the account you wish to have all your contacts created in. \n", "Q: How to import photos to keynote IPAD I have been looking all over the place for a simple answer, I want to make keynote presentations using photos from my company facebook page, I feel like it is impossible there is not a simple import from web option somewhere but I cannot find it and looking on google they want me to download my facebook albums which is not an option with thousands of pictures, someone please help.\n\nA: You can't import photos directly from Facebook in Keynote for iOS, but you can add photos from your Camera Roll. And the Facebook app for iOS lets you save photos to your Camera Roll -- open the photo in Facebook, then select 'Save Photo' from the top right menu. \nYou have to repeat this process for each photo you want to include in the presentation, but it's the only way I can think of.\n", "Q: 'mdls' and 'mdimport' interaction: good practice question Am I correct to assume that, in order to ensure a query in the terminal such as:\nmdls -name kMDItemContentCreationDate /var/log/system.log\n\nalways returns the actual creation date of said file (provided it exists), I should always force Spotlight to import this information first via:\nmdimport -r /var/log/system.log\n\n?\nI am interested strictly in obtaining, from the Terminal, that specific piece of data. \nThis seems to be the conclusion based on another SOV post, especially since the Spotlight indexing may ignore some folders. \n\nA: I would use stat instead of mdls on a system running the 64bit kernel.\nstat -f \"%B\" file\n\nwill return the creation date or birthtime in seconds since epoch (Unix/Epoch time). A human readable output can be produced with\nstat -f \"%SB\" file\n\nYou can also format the output of this command by adding the -t option (see man 3 strftime).\nOn a system running the 32bit kernel, you need to use GetFileInfo.\nGetFileInfo -d file\n\nThe output from GetFileInfo can be converted to Epoch time by running the output though the date command.\ncdate=$(GetFileInfo -d file)\ndate -j -f \"%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S\" \"$cdate\" +%s\n\n", "Q: Unlocking Sprint Network I got a phone from a guy, his business bought him a new phone and no longer needed the phone, which i now have. \nHis old plan was with sprint, and i use verizon. I would think his account has been deleted or something. The phone is not on his plan anymore.\nI tried just to put in the verizon SIM in but the phone was locked. I called Sprint asking for a unlock, but they needed an account to unlock.... but there isn't one any more. So using sprint to unlock is out of the deal.\nIs there anything else i can try so i can use my iPhone on my network?\n\nA: You could try lots of things. Your carrier (the one you pay) might know how to help. You could get service with Sprint, associate the phone with that service and then get it unlocked. You could return the phone to the person and ask them to unlock it. \nI would keep good notes on what you try and then reach out to your local consumer watchdog resources. Local news like to run \"stick up for the local person\" stories and there are government agencies that regulate carriers that you could share your efforts with.\nIt's a human policy issue though in the end, someone with access to a shared database needs to make an entry to unlock your device since they all cooperate and track which devices are locked and Apple doesn't really get involved in this according to any report I've seen.\nWorst case, you could recycle that phone for cash or resell it if your time is worth more than the effort it would take to get it unlocked.\n", "Q: iPhone Security When Showing Pics Is there a way to keep my iPhone 5 secure when passing it around to show photos?\nYes, even in 2016 some people still behave like they did in High School:  you pass over your phone so they can see a couple of pics and they sift thru your other pics or worse, they start snooping thru other apps.\nPerhaps there is a photo app into which I could place selected pics - AND that doesn't allow access outside of the one app.\nAny suggestions appreciated!\n\nA: Use Guided Access\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings.app -> General -> Accessibility -> Guided Access (On)\n\n*Open your Photos app and choose the album you want to show your friends.\n\n*Triple-click the side lock button (or home button, if applicable).\n\n*Select Guided Access if menu appears\n\n*Choose to deactivate certain areas of the touch screen to prevent them from accessing navigation.\n\n*Set a password when prompted\n\n*Start guided access and hand your phone around.\n\nTo End:\n\n*\n\n*Triple-click side button\n\n*Tap Guided Access on menu if prompted\n\n*Enter Password\n\n*Select \"End\"\n\nTips: Restarting your phone will circumvent Guided Access so you will want to have a password on your phone. On iOS 9 you can swipe down on a photo to go back to the album view. To take care of this, make sure that you have only the photos that you want to be visible in a folder. Then disable the top, left, and bottom sections of the touch screen. Disable the left to prevent a swipe from moving them back to the main album photo listing.\nAfter you setup Guided Access, it will remember your settings. If you just want to show one picture, just disable touch altogether.\n", "Q: How to type floating point numbers in Apple Numbers in Persian? When I want to insert a floating number in Apple Numbers 3.6.1 in OS X 10.10.5 while my primary preferred language in Language & Region is Persian(فارسی), the number is interpreted as a string value.\n\nIn these screenshots the right cell has the formula of B2 ÷ 2 while B2 is the left cell. I typed ۱.۲۳ (that is 1.23 in Persian) in B2 with Persian keyboard layout and an error is occurred.\n\nThe result is the same when i type the number with English keyboard layout.\n\nHow can i enter a floating point number?\n\nA: Note that in Persian language the floating point sign is represented with ,. So the problem can be solved by entering the number as ۱,۲۳ or 1,23.\nIn the first form when you want to enter the floating point sign, switch the keyboard layout to English then insert ‍, and then switch it back to Persian and insert the remaining fraction part.\n\n\n", "Q: Can one exchange SSD's in a single MBP for doing a back-up (delayed) on one of them? My logic board decided to leave without saying good-bye, MBP Mid 2012. This only serves as a delayed backup. I did however run Time Machine to backup my stuff, unfortunately it was 180 days ago... sure learnt my lesson now.\nMore specific, my MBP, when switching on, no sound, no display, only hear the fan running. Tried Target Disc Mode, no success. Going in for the replacement of the logic board soon and need to get the info off of the SSD as I read on several threads that if they replace the logic board with another make/version/model (which is the case cause Apple has a replacement program going on for the logic boards now), they will wipe the SSD and all the information on it will be gone. \nCan one SSD be swapped for another one in a MBP to backup data, and once the data has been backed up to a flash drive or external HDD, replace the first SSD and continue as normal afterwards?\n\nA: Apple recommends backing up your HD as they \"can't guarantee the integrity of the data on hard drive.\" Or words to that effect.\nTheoretically you can do what you have proposed. You may have boot issues, EG the Mac the SSD is swapped into may not boot but that is unlikely to damage either the Mac or the drive, so if you have the Mac and the time, go for it.\nPersonally I'd put the SSD in an external case, plug it and your backup drive into the same Mac and make a bootable image file of your SSD onto the backup drive. It's a little easier and you are less likely to damage more than one Mac accidentally by digging around in it... IMHO...\n", "Q: Share Keyboard Shortcuts I have about over 100 keyboard shortcuts for my mac, and I want to transfer all those shortcuts to my second computer. Is there a way to do this easily?\n\nA: The best bet is to change some shortcuts while observing the content of your Preferences folder sorted by modification date.\nIn my system (10.7.5 Lion) the relevant files are com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist, com.apple.universalaccess.plist and pbs.plist as well as probably somehow related plists like com.apple.systempreferences.plist/com.apple.ServicesMenu.Services.plist.\nIf both of your Macs have the same system/apps installed simply copy the files you found.\n\nA: Unless this is included in a Time Machine backup (in which case you could restore it with Migration Assistant), then not easily.\nSee this answer and this answer.\n\nThe shortcuts that can be set in System Preferences > Keyboard >\n  Keyboard Shortcuts > Application Shortcuts are stored in\n  ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist and the property lists\n  of applications (like ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist or\n  ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.chess/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.chess.plist).\nThe shortcuts for services are stored in\n  ~/Library/Preferences/pbs.plist.\n\n", "Q: Is phone call history available on OS X?

This works great, except I'm not able to turn off the onscreen keyboard.  I understand that there is an eject button on the Apple Bluetooth keyboard that allows turning on and off the onscreen keyboard.  Is there a key combination that I can use to do the same on the Microsoft Designer Bluetooth Desktop Keyboard?  \n\nA: Microsoft doesn't officially support iOS with the Designer Keyboard. They actually list it on their website as non-functional with iOS. This strikes me as a very inconvenient step seeing as I am using it right now on the iPad Pro and it is hands down better than any other iPad keyboard I have used... other that that idiotic refusal to dismiss the virtual keyboard when in use!\n", "Q: After an OS update, should you remain logged in?

Is there a way to restore postfix or the mail terminal programs to their default settings so I can get a fresh start?\n\nA: There must be two files main.cf.default and master.cf.default which you can use to overwrite the messed up ones, thus resetting them to the distribution default values.\ncp /etc/postfix/main.cf.default /etc/postfix/main.cf\ncp /etc/postfix/master.cf.default /etc/postfix/master.cf\n\nIf you can't find the default ones, you may try to copy them from another computer.\nAlso, you may type postconf -d which will print main.cf default parameter settings instead of actual settings.

Not just FaceTime, but anything similar as well (texting/email).\nAll the results I've found only solve the calling (phone) problem while the device is locked (asleep or set to lock screen). I just got this device and this scary thing happened: \n1. I pressed the hold button down too long by accident\n2. Search came up with sound recording on\n3. A friend, trying to help, said \"turn off applications\", thinking this would bring us to a help result about how to turn off an app running in the background (I didn't know how because I was used to an older iOS).\n4. The ipod IMMEDIATELY begain FaceTime calling my boss's boss! Late at night! \nI would never want my iPod to attempt to do send ANYTHING or connect to something, (especially FaceTime!), without my direct approval. (And horrible voice interpretation is NOT direct approval in my book. Her name sounds NOTHING like \"turn off applications\".) Opening an app is okay, but doing something that can't be undone is not. How can I ensure that nothing like this will happen again? \n-Turn off the help's \"auto-do it\" ability? (I'd be okay with turning off help altogether if that was needed, but that seems like overkill.) Can it decide to write and send texts/messages/emails for me? Make Facebook posts? Without even an \"approve\" button required? This is all very creepy.  \n-Turn off the voice activation feature completely? I thought it could be good for searching and faster typing. But I imagined speaking a sentence, fixing the errors and pressing a send button myself. Not having to fear that the device will \"send\" data for me. If I turn off voice, could typing something into the search do the same \"auto send\"? Because that is not good either.\n-Turn off something in FaceTime?  It should only call someone if I open the app and tell it to do that. I wouldn't ever want it to call someone without a definite YES pressed. I haven't found such a setting. \nEverything I've found talks about telling a phone to not auto-call when the screen is locked. My device is not a phone and some of the settings I've read about simply aren't on my device (iPod Touch), or at least not in the place they say. Also, I need a solution that works all the time, not just when the device is locked. I'm not fully aware of which apps could be involved and what the device can and can't do by itself in this matter, so I might not be searching for the right things. I've read that the problem was not Siri, but I've also read something implying that even when you turn Siri off, she can still be used when you're using search/help.\n\nA: The obvious things you can change are several:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off Siri - that is a sledge hammer to make sure you never do things by voice.\n\n*Turn off FaceTime - that also is a sledge hammer in that you can't use FaceTime normally.\n\n*Turn off the device or move it a) out of voice range if you allow \"Hey Siri\" b) out of arm range if you keep both 1 and 2 on from above.\n\n", "Q: iMac crashes after adding extra memory, any idea why?

however, as I suspected, that is one of the few iMacs from that period that cannot take more than 16GB RAM.\nI'm struggling to find data on whether it can specifically use 2x 8GB RAM sticks, though your own experiments would seem to say it cannot & that its maximum configuration would be 4x 4GB sticks.\nInfo source : Everymac - Aluminum iMac Q&A\nExtract\n\n† Specifically note that the 21.5\" models from the Mid-2010 line (iMac11,2) and the entry-level 27-Inch model -- the iMac \"Core i3\" 3.2 27-Inch (Mid-2010) -- only support 16 GB of RAM whereas all models from the Mid-2011 line -- 21.5\" and 27\" -- actually support 32 GB of RAM. If you have a 21.5\" model (or the entry-level 27-Inch \"Core i3\" powered Mid-2010 iMac), please be very certain to identify it precisely to avoid potential disappointment when upgrading the RAM. The 21.5\" Mid-2010 models use the 2389 EMC number whereas the 21.5\" Mid-2011 models use 2428.\n\nAs you are still running Snow Leopard - there is a possibility that the 8GB stick might work if you install the 64-bit firmware update [which so far I'm not able to track down, but you should check Apple Menu > Software Update, just in case]\n\nA: I'd like to post an update: I have purchased two Corsair 4GB ram sticks. They work perfectly and passed the memory test. It is indeed a memory compatibility issue - My 27\" Imac doesn't take 8GB ram sticks!\nThank you all for your help! \n\nA: Quick follow up if anyone else runs into this.\nThe mid-2010 iMac i3 processor can’t handle 8GB sticks.\nIt can only do up to 4GB/slot.\nOnly the i5 & i7 versions of the mid-2010 iMac can handle 8GB sticks.\nUpgrading the processor and ram on my 2010, and tried 2 x 8GB (16GB) with the i3 and had the same issues as OP.\nWith the i7, I can max out at 4 x 8GB (32GB) okay.\n", "Q: Can't Remove Downloaded Music From Ipod Touch Ever since the apple music update I've been unable to add or remove music from my ipod touch 5 via itunes on my computer. Everywhere I've looked says you go to the ipod icon, go into summary and click \"manually manage music and videos\" but mine only shows the option to \"manually manage videos\". I would like to be able to delete all of the music off of my ipod and start fresh because it somehow duplicated my entire playlist and is taking up double the amount of space it should. \nCurrently the only way I've found to do that is to individually go through and delete each of the 2000 songs twice, and that's a huge waste of time, so any help would be appreciated!\n\nA: You could delete the duplicate playlist from the iPod, but the actually music files shouldn't be duplicated anyway. Nevertheless, if you would like to delete all stored music (not including what's in the cloud), you can (on your iPod) navigate to Settings > General > Usage > Manage Storage (For Device Storage, not iCloud) > Music > Edit and tap delete next to \"All Songs\".\n", "Q: OS X give focus to a window after showing I have noticed something that really annoys me.\nSay I have some applications running and then I select a particular one using Dock. This application appears on the screen but does not receive focus (windows is displayed as inactive). So, when I type something input is not going to the foremost window.\nFor more clarification I can say that I always encounter this when focusing Terminal app that is not maximized - window is shown, but no focus on it. Moreover, when I click on an app icon in the Dock and this app was maximized, I have to click twice to see this app.\nHave anyone encountered the same?\nUPD: the problem relates to switching from full-screen app to non full-screen and vice versa. Switching from one full screen app to another full screen app or from one non-full screen to another non-full screen does not reproduce the problem\n\nA: Found solution myself. In system settings on the Mission Control tab the second option of the top group must be checked. I don't know exactly how it is in English, it shall be something like 'Switch to space with application windows when switching to an application' or something like that.\nI used this as a tip, it says about the third checkbox, but in my case the second one has solved my trouble.\n\nA: I would also take a look at bettertouchtool although january 2016 is the last month it will be freeware. I believe it has an option for it\n", "Q: FTP file to specific path on server I try to FTP a file with a one liner in a shell from a mac to a folder on my server.\nDoing the same in the FTP-Shell is not a problem for me, but doing this in one line is not possible to me.\nI even do not succeed with the following simple connecttest, which I guess is standard on every other system:\nftp name:password@mysite\n\nHow to transfer a file in one commandline with following info?\nfilename: <file>\nserver:<server>\nusername:<username>\npassword:<password>\npathonserver:<path>\n\nftp <username>:<password>@<server> \"cd <path>;put <file>\" ?\n\nA: To upload a file to the specific path using ftp command you have to:\nftp -u ftp://<user>:<pass>@<server>/<path> /path/to/file\n\nFrom man ftp:\n\n -u URL file [...]\n             Upload files on the command line to URL where URL is one of\n             the ftp URL types as supported by auto-fetch (with an\n             optional target filename for single file uploads), and file\n             is one or more local files to be uploaded.\n\n\nFor auto-fetch URLs also look into man ftp under AUTO-FETCHING FILES section.\n", "Q: How to mass remove known Wi-Fi Preferred Networks in OS X? In my list of Wi-Fi Preferred Networks I'm able to remove them 1 by 1, but that takes forever.

I have an Acer 4k-monitor which I'm looking to connect to the MacBook but I can't figure out how. The Apple website and FAQ's weren't helpful.\nI want the monitor to run 60hz, so I figured out I must use the Thunderbolt/Mini-DP connection. Since only HDMI 2.0 supports 60hz-4k (and I couldn't find out which one the MBP has).\nCan I buy a Mini-DP to Mini-DP cable or is it going to work with Apple's Thunderbolt-Thunderbolt cables?\n\nA: An Apple store employee told me they no longer sell Mini-DP to Mini-DP cables because Thunderbolt cables can serve the same purpose, but this answer suggests she might have been lying.\nI've seen a firmware revision reported for a Thunderbolt cable, which fits with the claim that a Thunderbolt cable includes a chip.\nI've had good luck with DisplayPort to Mini-DP cables. If your monitor has a full size DisplayPort connector, connecting a cable to that might be your best bet. Cables for that purpose are easy to find on Amazon.\nThis answer confirms my experience, that a Mac HDMI port can't do UHD at 60 Hz.\n", "Q: How do to hibernate OS X in order to reboot to Windows 10 I have Yosemite and Windows 10 installed on my Macbook Pro 2015.\nOn Windows 10 I can hibernate. Then press the power button and hold down ALT key to boot from OS X.\nHowever, I can't do the same thing the other way around.\nI have to shut down Yosemite or restart, in order for the ALT key to work for booting options.\nI tried the pmset hibernationmode 25 thingy with 1 second of standbydelay - when I press the sleep button and after that the power button, holding down ALT key doesn't give OS boot option menu.\nIs there a way to achieve with OS X what Windows does?\nI am trying to find a working way to do that for a few days now, browsing a bunch of topics here on stackexchange and different articles over the internet - nothing seems to work.\nI haven't tried third party paid applications though.\nTried DeepSleep application - it's hibernation feature also doesn't bring up the boot menu when holding down ALT either. I am not even sure if it even hibernates.\n\nA: Nope. OS X only has sleep, no hibernate mode. If you want to save your work while dual-booting, try a virtual machine, like Parallels or VMWare Fusion.\n", "Q: Mac Software to Search / Replace within a Project 0\ndown vote\nI haven't been able to find what I need.\nFor me. A project is a client. Their entire html / css / js website.\nI need to maintain various search / replace values at a project level.\nSelect a Project.\nAnd a list of project specific search / replace (that I created) entries appear.\nIf I open a different project… it may have similar search / replace values… but they are not related to any other project. It's literally a different website / property.\nI’ve tried numerous applications that allow me to perform search / replaces but most don’t allow me to save the patterns (to eliminate re-typing 100’s of patterns every month)\nand I’ve only found 1 (MassReplaceIt) that allows to save the changes at a project level…\nManaging the patterns with MassReplaceIt is extremely cumbersome when you have 50 projects you are working on every month. Performing the same changes to each project - every month / over and over.\nI want to be able to open a project… Add / Edit / Remove / Enable / Disable / Execute a list of Search / Replace patterns.\nThen I want to open a different project and do the exact same thing (with it's own project values) - without affect any other project.\nThis would save me days and days of work every month.\nAnd it needs to be Mac based.\nAnyway / any software to do this ?\n\nA: Did you have a chance to try free 'Find and Replace' utility?\nWeb site: http://findandreplace.sourceforge.net\n", "Q: What is the difference between \"Learn\" and \"Ignore\" in spell checkers When right-clicking a word in Pages and Sublime Text, the user is offered to either \"Learn\" or \"Ignore\" the word.\nWhat is the difference between learning and ignoring? To me it would seem the same, that the word is simply \"accepted\" by the spell-checker and not highlighted as incorrect (red) anymore.\nBut since it's two different choices, there's obviously a difference. Couldn't find information about this anywhere.\n\nA: \"Learn\" means you are teaching this word to the machine so it knows the word for the future and even suggests you the word if you type it slightly wrong in the future.\n\"Ignore\" means that the machine still does not know the word, but does only not highlight it as wrong anymore in this specific case when you selected \"ignore\".\n\nA: By clicking learn it will add it to the dictionary.\nIf you click ignore it will accept (ignore) it for the current text but not for any other (e.g. new) document.\n\nA: The reason this matters, I learned the hard way, is you can fill up your dictionary with 'learn', which takes up space on the computer and seems quite hard for the computer shop to figure out when you are plumb out of memory.\n", "Q: Is there a way to prevent apps from staying in Dock after quitting? Certain OSX apps seem to have a tendency to stick around in the Dock, even though there's no user-facing setting to prevent this behavior. Is there a defaults command that prevents apps from enabling \"Keep in Dock?\" \nI know about defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array (intentionally empty), but this has to be run manually, and repeatedly. Any ideas?\n\nA: Even after the below configuration, some applications might still run in background (. symbol in dock) &  appears in dock\n\nOpen System Preferences, Click on dock, uncheck \"Show recent applications in dock\"\n\nFor instance, terminal/iterm2 they do not disappear from dock when closing from window.\nFor disappearing the application from dock, Command key, ⌘ + Q\nso basically, some applications like in launchpad close immediately from dock as soon as they are closed from window but, if they don't disappear from dock then ⌘ + Q will be the solution\n\nA: It seems like in Mojave (10.14) the following will do the trick:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock show-recents -bool no\ndefaults write com.apple.dock recent-apps -array # intentionally empty\n\n\nA: I think I understand your problem..

Hooray!\n\nA: From my personal experience, there isn't really any way to change Mac's startup sound. For some reason, that's embedded right inside the computer itself—even if I started a Mac in Windows 10, the same startup sound can be heard but before Windows boots up. \nHowever, you can mute it and just add another sound, but unlike Windows 10, you have to get logged in before you hear the sound. Well, that was just what Addison said. However, his solution and my suggestion will only apply only to your user account!\nIn addition to Addison's work, I'd like to add this…\n\n\n*\n\n*When the system turns off, there should be some sort of terminal code (usually the logouthookcode (search online for that). In my case, the logouthook code did not work, but I hope it works in yours. \n\n*In addition to the startup sound, the code should be able to restore the volume of the computer back to the same level before it was muted—or else you will forget that you have muted it. \n\n\nAn Example\nI have two examples, but I will only send one since the other one relies on AppleScript and my AppleScript renderer is broken!\nThese are the codes you would have to place in Automator. You have to run this as an app. This includes only very simple codes. \n\n\n*\n*Set Computer Volume\n*\n*You can set the volume as any volume you want.

For instance I downloaded Java and it's listed as a device.  After i ran the installation, i clicked on the little eject-like looking button beside its name under Devices and the downloaded installation file disappeared from the Desktop.  Where did it go?\n\nA: Many applications you download for your Mac come in a file which is similar to a virtual CD/DVD. Those are .dmg files or Disk Images. Whenever you double-click those you can imagine they are kept in the memory of your computer. Even if you delete the .dmg the content is still there as long as the image is not ejected (it is currently \"mounted\"). \nWhen you eject (\"unmount\") them, the content in memory is no longer there. However, the .dmg is at the same location where you opened/double-clicked it. Most likely for newly downloaded things, this is in ~/Downloads which is the Downloads folder in your user's home directory.\n", "Q: How to disable Safari Frequently Visited?

For example, I do window snapping with cmdoptJ|L, but cmdoptI would conflict with Chrome's dev tools shortcut. \nI'd like a set of modifiers I can use for virtually any global shortcut I want without conflict.\n\nA: For personal macros, I usually simply use the control key—practically nothing uses just the control key as a modifier; it's always paired with command. (e.g. ⌃J/L)\nIf you're asking so you can include it in software you're developing to widely distribute, though, I wouldn't recommend this for exactly the reason that it's a good idea for personal use: it's pretty non-standard.\n", "Q: How to ensure Slack runs safely in sandbox? For work I use my personal laptop and I am required to run Slack to keep in contact with coworkers however it occurs to me that this could potentially be used as an invasive surveillance tool unless it is forced to run in a sandbox.\nFor instance what if it  were allowed to scan my file system, including any attached USB thumb drives, and what if it  were allowed to take screenshots? What if there is a built-in keylogger? I need to make sure that this software is not being used for improper purposes. We all know how power can be abused, and how even a little bit of power over people can  tempt a weak person to do  bad things.\nIIRC I downloaded it using the Mac App Store.\nQuestions:\nDoes anyone know how I  can  determine  what the default  sandbox setting  of this app is?\nIf the app is bypassing the sandboxing mechanism how do I nevertheless enforce sandboxing?\nHas anyone here managed to  detect open files (using lsof on the command line) that Slack was accessing, that might indicate suspicious activity?\n\nA: Slack is a well-known chatting tool and I am yet to hear it does any surveillance. Also, every single Mac app which is submitted into App Store after June 1 of 2012 must have sandboxing implemented or it won't be approved.\nAdditionally, no app is able to access your computer outside of its limits unless you give it your root password (Slack does not ask for it).\nIf you still don't feel safe, open Monitor application in Utilities, select Slack app in the list, press (i) button on the toolbar and select \"open files and ports\" tab. No file will go away.\nAll the above means that Slack already runs in the Sandbox. In theory (and I stress on \"theory\") sandbox can be bypassed, but I highly doubt such a serious company would do it first, and second - such app is very unlikely to be on the AppStore.\n", "Q: How can I check the version of a package online before installing?

Is there any way to get it without installing?\n\nA: You can get information on each of the hits:\nbrew info octave\nbrew info --cask evernote\n\nIn both cases, these may require you to \"tap\" the containing levels, but it gives you the command to run for each as needed.\nFrom the first package information, you should get an info URL of https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/blob/master/octave.rb and then could inspect the source of that octave installation. Repeat for the cask and then you can decide or not to install one or the other.\n\nA: You have two versions because one is command-line and the other is a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

I have a bunch of iMovie projects on my iPhone and they take up quite a bit of space.  I'd like to move them to my Windows PC. \nIn iTunes I tried going to Device/Apps/Sharing/iMovie, but it seems you can only add things to iMovie - you can't retrieve them from iOS. \nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: Unlike music and photos there (seems to be, IMHO) is no built-in sync option for iMovie. You may need to use a program like iExplorer to get the actual project files off the IOS device but once you have them there is no guarantee that they will be usable in any application (Mac or Windows).\nIf you tap the share button in iMovie you can then save the final project as a movie file right to the camera roll which will then sync to your PC the next time you sync your device. But from your question it seems that you want a backup of all of the individual files contained in each iMovie project.\nI would bet that a backup of your iPhone contains all of those files but never having actually used iMovie on an IOS device I can't say so authoritatively. But again an application like iExplorer will let you (ahem...) explore the backups on your PC to verify and extract those files.\n", "Q: I can't enable iCloud backup on my phone My iCloud backup is currently off.

If I then close the Macbook and leave, it seems to go to sleep (and show 100% battery remaining when arriving at home).\nHow can I put the computer to sleep without opening and closing the lid?\n\nA: Your MacBook Pro is waking up when you disconnect the Display Port and Thunderbolt connections. This happens because OS X needs to re-evaluate its hardware situation.\nConsider using a context-sensitive automation tool like ControlPlane. When you disconnect your display or thunderbolt network, have ControlPlane trigger sleep mode.\nAlternatively, try reducing the required period of inactivity before sleeping: System Preferences > Energy Saver\n\nA: Since I'm using a wireless Magic keyboard, a solution to the problem is to put the MacBook to sleep after all peripherials have been disconnected using Option+Command+Eject.

When two monitors are connected to my Mac, the following snippet returns a two item list:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set myDesktops to desktops\nend tell\n\nExpanding on this, the following snippet provides more display information to work with:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set myDesktop to properties of the first desktop\nend tell\n\n\nA: I'm not going to pretty this up like Graham Miln nicely did however it you want to create an AppleScript app that you can run before disconnecting your external display then this will wait 30 seconds, check to see if it's in clamshell mode and if yes put the system to sleep.\nAppleScript code:\ndelay 30\nset AppleClamshellState to do shell script \"ioreg -r -k AppleClamshellState -d 1 | awk -F' = ' '/AppleClamshellState/ {print $2}'\"\nif AppleClamshellState = \"Yes\" then tell application \"Finder\" to sleep\n\nNote: In the if statement, System Events can be use in place of Finder as either will accept the sleep command.\n", "Q: Key combination not propagating to Fusion VM I have a clean installation of El Capitan with VMware Fusion Pro 8 and Windows 10 Pro. \nI use Fusion in full screen, and the windows keyboard command Control + Command+ D is used to create a new desktop, however when pressing this command, the mouse curser changes to the Mac OS cursor, and nothing happens. It seems Mac OS is digesting the command and not allowing the virtual machine to receive it.\nInterestingly:\n\n\n*\n\n*The VM receives other commands, like Control + Command+ Left\n\n*All commands 'disableable' through preferences in both keyboard and accessibility are disabled, with the exception of Command + Option + Left, and Command + Option + Right to change full screen applications.\n\n*The only reference I have found to it, is a Document Shortcut, which I would expect to be consumed via the application in focus.\n\n\nHow can this renegade command be rectified? \n\nA: The key combination ctrlcmdD is a system wide shortcut to show or hide the definition of a selected word/words. This even works in VMware. As a last resort the definition of the name of your virtual machine will be shown.\nTo disable the shortcut, open Terminal and enter:\ndefaults write com.apple.symbolichotkeys AppleSymbolicHotKeys -dict-add 70 '<dict><key>enabled</key><false/></dict>'\n\nThis will add the key 70 to the file com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist and disable the shortcut. After a reboot you will be able to use the above shortcut in fullscreen mode in Windows 10.\nYou may get a similar result by installing Karabiner and adding a special keycode.\n", "Q: How do you copy a single word from an SMS? I have received an SMS with an unlock PIN for an app. I now want to copy & paste that code into the app.\nWhen I press on the message, I only get the option to copy the whole message. How can I only copy the PIN?\n\nA: Sadly, you can't select a single word from a received SMS.\nYou're going to have to copy the whole SMS to a note (Or to the \"reply\" input), then select the part you want from that note.\nThat said, if the sent code is numeric, a user can directly copy it.\niOS will interpret it as a possible phone number, and allow several options when the number is touched & held down.\n", "Q: How to hide Terminal Window when a script is running I've built a script that sits in the users login items that runs each time a user logs in but I want to prevent the terminal window or terminal application from popping up. I don't mind the app icon showing up in the dock but I have some users who tend to want to close the terminal window which cancels what the script is doing.\nI've been googling this and there doesn't seem to be a simple solution. Checking \"Hidden\" in the login items does not hide the window.\nThank you\n\nA: You could run your script using the screen utility. This will detach the program from the terminal so even if it is closed the program execution will continue.\nScreen will exit once the program running in it has finished but not before.\n\nA: Instead of having Terminal.app launch a .command file (I assume), you should set up a LaunchAgent. It will run a command or a script with no user visibility.\n", "Q: My iMac Doesn't boot it.

Possible use cases. Someone emails you a music demo. You find a song you want to download online. You want to download an MP3 from Soundcloud. \nIt is easy to add songs to iTunes and sync it over with a computer, but is it possible to add songs to your Music Library on your actual phone? i\n\nA: This is currently impossible. You can share downloaded audio with many apps - Dropbox, Google Drive, or the one I use most often for learning music and the like, forScore. But you can't share it with iTunes. Although, songs purchased on your phone can easily (or automatically) added to the libraries of your other Apple devices via Settings - iTunes & App Store and selecting Music under Automatic Downloads. \n\nA: You can try to download the file from your email to Mac(book).

I teach a class that uses R as part of the lab and one of my students uses an iPad for her primary computer.  Is there anyway to install R on an iPad?\nI found some old blog posts that say it isn't possible but I have not been able to find any information less than about 5 years old.\n\nA: It's actually pretty simple, in that, if it is not in the app store it can't be installed, unless you want to go the jailbreak route because you found an \"R\" app for jailbroken IOS devices.\n\nA: There is an app called Analyser by You Hui Yan available on the App Store ($14.95) which includes a R interpreter as well as a Python interpreter. The install.packages() is disabled (per Apple's requirements), but a fairly broad number of libraries are included. The last update was in 2017, so it is still active.\n\nA: Let her try this site: TutorialsPoint, where she can use R or R-Studio.\nAlso, this RollApp may be the answer.\n\nA: Also you can download an ios app from the appstore to connect via ssh to another machine in your network with R already installed\n\nA: I setup Rstudio on Win10 with Amazon's workspaces. The cost is reasonable at 7.95/mo and 22 cents/hr of use for the basic tier. There is an Amazon Workspaces iOS app that actually seems to be usable.\nI am not that interested in programming on my iPad. I am more interested in running programs and seeing the output. This definitely is feasible with Amazon Workspaces. But programming might actually be feasible. YMMV.\n\nA: You can install R (but not run it perfectly) without jailbreak. First you'll need to get ISH app which is a Linux (Alpine) emulator. To do that you need to download the Testflight app from the App Store which is an app for beta testing other apps. Then you'll need to click the invite at the ISH app's website from yout Ipad. You'll be prompted to download the ISH app. Once on the App you'll open a terminal emulator. Type\n\napk add R\n\nto install R (I also suggest):\n\napk add R-dev R-doc\n\nThen you'll get R in your ipad.\nCaveats: packages that need compiling won't work well here as this is an emulator.\n\nA: As a followup to @Rodrigo, iSH is now available on the App Store, without apk (the Alpine package manager). The instructions to install apk are on the iSH wiki.\nAfter that, it is a simple to install R, as @Rodrigo noted, and details on adding  compiled packages are here.\nemacs is also available from apk, and thus, possibly, ess (not tested).\nIf you wish to use an iPad editor (e.g. Textastic or Buffer), you can use mount -t iOS foo /mountpoint to mount a directory that the editor can also access. Files can also be transferred locally via the files app. (tested.)\nIt is unclear if RStudio can be built for iSH.\n", "Q: Quickest way to change \"Output Device\" while html5 video is playing?

Setting \"text is TRUE\" and \"text is FALSE\" worked for me.\n\nA: It looks like Apple has implemented this functionality natively now (at least on Numbers 11.2) so that no language-dependent workaround is needed.\nWhen setting up a Highlighting Rule, choose  Cell as type, and there you will find the \"Is true\"\"Is false\" rules\n\nA: The OP does not specify how TRUE or FALSE are represented in the cell, but as was stated in another answer, using text is rule will work.  This also works for checkboxes, they resolve to TRUE and FALSE as well.\n\n\n*\n\n*Text is TRUE add formatting\n\n*Text is FALSE add other formatting\n\n\nThis works for the result of a formula returning the text TRUE or FALSE.

My iPhone 6s plus got stolen from me last Monday evening and I have only started to track it down using Find My iPhone the following night. From then onwards, it only showed that my phone is offline and that Lost Mode is pending. Does it mean that the thief has already deactivated my Find My iPhone by resetting the handset? (I believe Find My iPhone is a default application in the newer version like iPhone 6s does it mean the application together with my iCloud account will be retained even after resetting? Is there any chances of getting my phone back?\n\nA: Find my iPhone is a feature that cannot be disabled unless a user has the password to the iCloud account, and when the phone is in lost mode Activation Lock would kick in should someone restore the software on the device (rendering it unusable). The application being on the phone, however, does not necessarily mean that it was enabled for use. Consider the following scenarios for your phone:\n\n\n*\n\n*The phone had Find my iPhone enabled and is powered off/no longer working\n\n*Find my iPhone was not enabled on the phone, and the thief was able to restore/wipe the device\n\n*Find my iPhone is enabled, but carrier service has already been suspended to the device, meaning it cannot get online to post its status and to check the lock/lost status\n\n\nIn any case, it is impossible for us to determine what chance you will have of retrieving your device. It is always recommended that you submit a police report with a high level of detail, including the phone serial number, so that it may be traced back to you should it be found. Also, should a user try to sell it to someone else or take it to a carrier for service, it's possible that they might see it is in Activation Lock and let Apple know about the device. Beyond that, it is generally considered a lost cause.\n", "Q: Burning CDs from iTunes Why are my music tracks when burned to CD from iTunes thru the Playlist feature shorter than the originals?  I have tried on multiple albums all with the same result.  A song might be 4:58 in iTunes and when I burn a CD, the song is now 2:58.  There does not appear to be any logic on the difference, just that the entire song does not copy.  This does not happen with all songs, just random ones.  Typical 5-8 minutes of music is deleted from several tracks.  It is not an issue of capacity on the CD.  I am well under the limit there.\n\nA: That is odd. The only thing I can think of is that perhaps the start/stop times of some individual songs have been changed. Try this\n\n\n*\n\n*Find a song that this happened to\n\n*Get Info on it (right click on the song in iTunes and select Get Info)\n\n*Click the \"options\" tab near the top of the Get Info window\n\n*Check and see if the start and stop times have been changed. Start should be \"0:00\" and end should be the full length of the song in minutes and seconds.\n\n\nIf those times are set incorrectly the songs will be clipped/truncated when playing, creating an AAC version of the song or burning to CD.\nIf that is not it... well sorry I don't know\n", "Q: Apple TV YouTube \"Error occured loading this content\" So my YouTube application for my Apple TV is not working.

I need to disable all notifications: iCal, Skype, and especially application updates. Everything.\nI can find info on how to do this in Yosemite, but not Lion.\nWould anyone know how to go about this?\n\nA: First of all, let's make sure that we are talking about Mac OS X \"Lion\" which is version 10.7 and not \"Mountain Lion\" which is version 10.8. Is this correct? This is important since Notification Center debuted in 10.8.\nIf you are on 10.7 then I may suggest two workarounds.\n1. You may want to install Growl app and set all notifications off. Please, read Help and Blog sections before purchasing the app.\n2. You may want to upgrade to \"Mountain Lion\" and then turn off all notifications by entering this commands in terminal:\nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist\nkillall NotificationCenter\n\nIf you'll ever change your mind, you can then return it back by:\nlaunchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to get exact NTP drift in OS X I'm trying to get actual NTP drift on Macs connected to a local NTP server.\n\n\n*\n\n*When reading /var/db/ntp.drift file I get -37.521 which according to PPM to milliseconds conversion gives -3241ms of drift.\n\n*When using ntpq -c lpeer I get something like this:\n\n     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter\n==============================================================================\n*172-1-1-5.light 164.67.62.212    2 u   57   64  377  199.438   38.322  29.012\n\nwhich gives me offset of 38.322ms\n\n\n*\n\n*Finally, sntp 172.1.1.5 outpus this:\n\n\n\n2016 Jan 21 18:41:45.248591 +0.019244 +/- 0.022507 secs\n\nwhich says having about 19ms of drift.\nI'm confused which one the approaches gives accurate NTP drift?\n\nA: sntp gives the current offset.

These days, malicious software seems to be infecting Windows computers, encrypting their data against their will, and asking for a Bitcoin ransom in exchange for the encryption key.\n\n\n*\n\n*In order for such a software to run \"successfully\" on an OS X machine, would the user first have to run it and give the sudo password? Is such a threat conceivable on OS X without the user doing this? \n\n*Would FileVault protect against this? Could a ransomware program, if unwittingly installed by a user (who also confirmed with the sudo password), take your FileVault data hostage? Could it take hostage also your TimeMachine backups even if they are encrypted?\n\n*In general, how (in)vulnerable is OS X to encryption ransomware, and how careless/unsavvy do the actions of a user have to be in order to actually have his or hers data taken hostage?\n\nA: At the moment, it's relatively safe.  Most ransomware has targeted Windows users, and so far, the ransomware that has targeted Macs has been relatively crude.  The latest (very crude) Mac ransomware threat  did not destroy Time Machine backups, but was not stopped by FileVault.  \nIn general, the steps you describe in part 2 of your question are unlikely to help protect you; encrypted data is not harder to re-encrypt than unencrypted data.\nVulnerabilities that don't require what you describe in part 1 of your question are rare, but are found from time to time.  Mac Ransomware that uses one has yet to be seen.  It's likely that Mac Ransomware will slowly get more sophisticated, and careful, savvy users are unlikely to lose their data to ransomware anytime soon.  But I can't predict the future.  This answer may live on for years and such ransomware is likely to turn up eventually.  But the meaning of \"careful, savvy user\" will likely change over time as well.\nAt present:\nRansomware will have a relatively hard time deleting or encrypting online Time Machine backups.  Even as root/superuser, it's hard to delete Time Machine backups:\nsudo rm /Volumes/BK1/Backups.backupdb/Orion/2017-03-18-184155/BOOT/var/du--sortedALLk.13224.bak\nPassword:\noverride rw-r--r--  root/wheel for /Volumes/BK1/Backups.backupdb/Orion/2017-03-18-184155/BOOT/var/du--sortedALLk.13224.bak? y\nrm: /Volumes/BK1/Backups.backupdb/Orion/2017-03-18-184155/BOOT/var/du--sortedALLk.13224.bak: Operation not permitted\n\nBut it's far from an insurmountable problem.  I think folks should assume that the additional step that the ransomware would have to go through (which I'm familiar with but choosing not to publicize - I'd rather not help script kiddies) to be able to delete or encrypt TM backups is something most Mac ransomware you're likely to become infected with will be programmed to take.\nTime Machine users are encouraged to allow backups to run often, which makes them quite vulnerable to ransomware.\nTherefore some backup drives should be connected less often and kept more secure - not fully accessible to the system - specifically to protect from ransomware.  \nTypically, victims realize they've been infected with ransomware only when the ransomware announces its presence.  So it's likely you won't be able to tell that a computer is infected with ransomware before it has a chance to encrypt the data on a frequently or continuously connected external drive. Assuming otherwise is far from a safe assumption. The ransomware threat makes better disaster preparedness, including having more numerous offline physical backups, more important. \n\nA: This is a tough one to answer. I have seen discussions on MacInTouch.com about just this subject. And if you keep up with news online about such tings you will find that opinions vary from \"Chicken Little\" to, \"nah, don't worry about it on a Mac.\"\nThe truth likely lives somewhere between the two.\nGenerally viruses of all types have a bit of a harder time on the Mac. I run without an installed virus scanner on all my Macs. But I have been working, professionally, supporting Macs since System 6. So, with care, recent backups and an alert mind (yeah right...) you are fairly safe without a virus scanner. That said I always recommend that you have a virus scanner installed and kept updated.\nRansomware usually (like many other forms of malware on the Mac) requires that you enter a username and password to give the malware installer rights to do it's dirty work. However there are vulnerabilities on Mac O/S that supposedly don't require administrative authentication to root your computer.\nThere is also malware that tries to masquerade as ransomware. A co-worker recently opened a link to a video that then infected Safari on his Mac with what looked like some malicious javascript. But starting Safari in Safe mode, resetting to defaults and then a thorough cache cleaning (we used Onyx) removed the so called ransomware from his Mac. he was annoyed with himself for falling for it saying, \"I knew better and never should have opened that video.\"\nYeah that does not fully answer your questions (parts of 1 and 3) but an online search for articles on ransomware on Macs and a search of MacInTouch, might help educate you further. Or maybe someone here has some more experience with it.\n", "Q: An app that can give me the amount of time using an app?

My Mac is never really moved and is always fully charged (I do take out the cable when it reaches 100% but I put it back in at about 10%). My cycle count is 781 which is only about 3/4 of the battery's life, and I use it hours every day.\nMy question is, how long can I go with this Service Battery. I do not want to damage my computer but as I'm always right next to the power cord, battery capacity is not a problem.\nThe help says:\n\nYou can continue to use your battery before it’s checked without harming your computer.\n\nSo when will it damage my computer if at all?\n\nA: I replaced mine (MBP 2009) as soon as possible in the knowledge that Apple only stock replacement batteries for 5 years (source: Apple Genius told me). Mine was 4 years, 11 Months...\nAside from the 'service battery' warning I was seeing wildly fluctuating capacity and a tendency to power down hard at ~20% - so aside from the physical risk you may also risk data loss & file system corruption.\n\nA: Unless there is a problem with the battery itself you can likely use your Mac (laptop, I presume) indefinately. I have seen that done at a number of places with Macs and PCs used as a \"spare\" computer.\nI will usually remove the battery from the laptop (if possible) to avoid the battery causing any damage to the computer, but depending on the Mac that may not be an easy thing to do, or even possible to do without damaging the Mac or exposing you to the contents of the battery which can be quite toxic.\nThat said if it is not possible or easy to remove the battery, I have seen laptops go for years with a dead battery in them with no problems. Only you can decide if you want to go under the assumption that your battery will not cause any damage to the computer from chemical leaks, electronic malfunction or mechanical (EG swelling) failure. Your odds are fairly good, that is, if you are the gambling type. \n", "Q: How can I create a user that can login through SSH but not on the local desktop in MacOS X El Capitan?

I do not want that user to be able to use the system through any other means, especially not on the local desktop. I would like that user not to be listed as possible options when logging into the desktop.\nObviously the user needs to be allowed to access via SSH on the Sharing preferences menu. Setting the user's shell to /usr/bin/false, a usual way to disable login for users on MacOS X without deleting them, seems to disable SSH access as well as desktop access. Currently the only way I could come up with is setting a password for the user that the user doesn't know, but I suppose users could then change the password by themselves.\nOn Debian GNU/Linux for example I would be able to disable the password and/or login altogether.

If so I can answer that as a happy user of 1Password that you can't. Migrating or syncing passwords from/with the keychain is as far as I know, not strictly possible.\nBut 1Password (at least) is designed as a replacement for the Apple Keychain. the migration is not without its pain points (manually moving passwords over wholesale, or a few at a time as they pop up is not fun) but once you have all your passwords moved over your need for Keychain is gone.\nAlso, you can get an iOS version of 1Password as well which syncs with the desktop versions (either through the cloud or locally within your WLAN) and ties in nicely with Mobile Safari and other apps on your iDevice.\n", "Q: Can't launch or uninstall Disk Drill I've got these two icons in my menu bar, which appear to be an application called Disk Drill (see red rectangle):\n\nBasically, I want to uninstall Disk Drill and have these two icons removed from my menu bar.

Additionally, even if it were currently possible to mirror the display of your iPhone onto an iPad, that's all it would do is mirror the display of your iPhone; it wouldn't be able to respond to multi-touch.\n", "Q: Disk utility won't let me use the restore option to get a .dmg image onto a USB I'm tying to make a bootable Debian USB drive. All I need to do is restore the USB drive from the Debian dmg. I get this error. The debian.org documentation is not helpful with this specific issue. Here's what I keep running into.\n\n\nA: I would suggest using dd, from the command line (Terminal).\nThe syntax is as follows:\nsudo dd if=/path/to/file/<file> of=/dev/disk<your drive number> bs=1m\nIt will prompt you for your password, and you will not be able to see it as you type.\nTo get your disk number, you can run diskutil list from Terminal, and find the disk that most closely matches your drive's stats.\n", "Q: OS X wont show desktop I have upgraded to El Capitan, but I was having this problem for a while, where the desktop background doesn’t display. The folders have white letters, and the background is white, and this makes everything difficult to read. The background image doesn't change immediately, I have to log out, and log back in. I can see it has changed, on the login screen, and after I have logged in. But at some point, the screen turns white, and thus the problem. \nI have turned off all the start up applications, and the problem remains. \nI have looked for view options in Finder, but I cannot figure out why the desktop remains white.\nI have tried the normal ways of changing desktop background, but it doesn’t work. Alternatively, I can not see it, because something is blocking it? That is a guess. \nInverting colours in the accessibility menu doesn't help, as inverted colours mean I'm looking at black on black instead of white on white. \nI created a new user. The new user doesn’t have this problem, their desktop is visible.  \n\nA: I deleted ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist which seemed to help momentarily, but the the problem began again. in that time, I noticed an app called \"DeskShade\" that was running, and said wtf is that? So I did sudo rm -rf DeskShade.app/  I rebooted, and my desktop is back. It's been good for about 30 minutes, hopefully removing this app is the solution. \n", "Q: SSH access using .pub key I don't know if I'm overthinking this too much but I can't seem to understand how to use a ssh public key to create an ssh connection trough my mac.  \nI'll list my steps bellow:  \n\n\n*\n\n*First created the SSH keys in my server in cpanel -> SSH keys and created a key pair with name id_rsatest \n\n*Then I downloaded to my mac both public and private key files, so now in my downloads folder I have the files: id_rsatest and id_rsatest.pub \n\n*Then I moved the id_rsatest.pub file to Users/myuser/.ssh/ and opened Terminal.app -> Shell -> New Remote Connection and entered the information below:\n\nand receive this error:\nssh: connect to host example.com port 22: Operation timed out\n[Process completed]\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? Is this even the way on how to create a SSH access with SSH keys?  \n\nA: You got it the wrong way round :-)\n\n\n*\n\n*create a key pair on the Mac you are using \n\n*put both id_rsa.pub and id_rsa into ~/.ssh and run chmod 600 id_rsa\n\n*append the generated public key (id_rsa.pub) to .ssh/authorized_keys on the remote machine (your server in this case). If you are allowed to login in via ssh using a password, use\nssh remoteuser@remotemachine \"mkdir ~/.ssh; cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\" < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\notherwise transfer the file by whatever means you have to upload files.\n\n*run ssh remoteuser@remotemachine in your shell to connect\n\n\nPS: The private key should never need to leave the machine it's generated on\n", "Q: How to import tasks from OmniFocus into 2Do? Is there a way to import tasks from OmniFocus into 2Do?\n\nA: 2Do currently has no import menu command, but you can use its URL schemes to create new tasks very flexibly. See 2Do URL Schemes. You can use the ofexport package to get your tasks out of OmniFocus, and then use some Applscript magic to generate the URL schemes and send them to 2Do. I haven't done this yet myself but am considering it were I to move to 2Do. An example AppleScript that might help can be found here.\n", "Q: Terminal window displays odd text after being resized If I open a terminal window, and then shrink it as far left as possible, and then enlarge it again, it displays some odd text, including some of the letters in my hostname:\n\nAny way to fix this?\nNote: I'm guessing this is a bug, since when I go fullscreen, and then go back to a window, it goes back to normal and won't happen again.\nUpdate: Some other weird stuff happens when I resize the window from using commands within the window.\n\nA: It's a bug caused by Terminal's automatic text rewrapping combined with your shell's SIGWINCH re-rendering. If you just want to clear the corrupted text, you can use Edit->Clear All (default shortcut  ⌘   +  K ) to clear the window, leaving only the prompt.\n", "Q: Is there a way to disable incremental search search on a Mac, especially in Preview? Sometimes when typing a search term in the search bar in Preview or Spotlight the text entry locks up for a few seconds. I assume this happens because it is beginning to search on the letters I've already typed to return a fast result. The problem is if I mistype my search, which happens often, I now have to wait for it to catch up on the incorrect search just so I can correct my text. \nIs there a way, even involving Terminal hacking, to turn off the automatic searching as you type functionality in Preview, and maybe across the whole OS so that when I hit enter it sends the search and not before?\n\nA: No - spotlight has live searches hard coded into the app.\nYou have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Work on tuning the system so it's less busy and that the disk IO needed to look up things from the spotlight database are faster.\n\n*Paste the entire search string into the search field to avoid incremental updates.\n\n", "Q: Swapping spaces between monitors Given that I have 'mission control/displays have separate spaces' unchecked: is there a way to swap spaces between displays (and assign a shortcut to it)?\nFor example: if I have 'Desktop 4' on the left monitor and 'Desktop 2' on the right monitor, I'd like to end up with 'Desktop 2' on left and 'Desktop 4' on the right.\n\nA: If you have 'Displays have separate Spaces' unchecked, then you cannot do what you are looking for.\nThe 'Space' will automatically be the same Space on both monitors, you can't have one Space on the left & another on the right. You would need to re-check 'Displays have separate Spaces' in order to do that.\nThen you could call up any Space on any monitor.\nBecause I don't use it that way myself (& refuse to mess up my careful setup yet again to test it ;) you'd have to test whether a given Space on the left has the same window contents as when you call that Space on the right. My guess is that they would have different contents, as it's possible to call the same Space on each, & for that to then be a mirror wouldn't make much sense.\nSo, I'm pretty certain that by either method, you cannot achieve what you need - which I am assuming is effectively to swap the contents of one screen for the contents of the other.\n", "Q: Move Purchased App from Windows Phone to iPhone My Windows Phone got stolen and I decided to get an iPhone 4s as a replacement.\nI bought the Threema-App for WP 8.1.\nIs there any possibility to get Threema for iOS 9.2.1 without having to buy it again?\n\nA: I assume you know that the application on the Windows phone can't, itself, be installed on your new iPhone. \nAs to whether or not the manufacturer will allow you to \"sidegrade\" or not is a question only they can answer\n\nA: As per the Threema FAQ\n\nCan I move the purchased app between operating systems?\nPaid apps are sold for a commission by different providers (Apple, Google, Microsoft). They neither share nor forward data about their customers and licenses. Hence it is impossible to move licenses from one platform to another. Hence, when switching between Android, iOS or Windows phone, the app has to be purchased again for the new operating system.\nPlease note that your contacts' verification levels cannot be moved when changing the operating system, whereas your Threema ID can be maintained.\n\nYou must buy it again on the Apple App Store.\n", "Q: Scripted SFTP command line file transfer Mac OS X I'm working with someone who's been doing simulations on various computers and FTPing the results to a website using a script and the basic mac ftp command basically something like (this is not exact just what i remember from when i last looked at it)\nftp -i username@host password\ncd /dir/\nput file 1\nput file 2\n...\n\nand so on...\nI need to upgrade this process to use SFTP for security purposes, but there's no way that I can tell to put the password in a single line script for the SFTP program that's built into mac OS X.  Is there some other way to do this?  I tried using something called LFTP which seemed to connect to the server but the files would always stay at 0% when they were trying to transfer.  Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: \nI guess i need to generate a key from the server itself and provide it to the user then they can connect just using the username and the key will authenticate them right? \n\nNo. Generate the key on client (ssh-keygen) and upload the public key to server. For example using ssh-copy-id, if the ssh is allowed on the server. There are many how-to's around the internet, so I believe you will be able to figure out.\nThen connecting would work like sftp username@host (without password). If you have some batch, you can provide it to sftp using -b option. For more info, consult manual pages for sftp or the other above mentioned tools.\n\nA: So in the end I never got public key authentication working and i'm sure it's some kind of permissions issue because when i ssh/sftp into the server i can't even cd into the .ssh directory without a permissions error from cygwin.  Since I couldn't figure out how to fix this, but I was at least able to get permissions working enough that I could succesfully sftp/ssh from my mac I just ended up installing LFTP which let me use a script that included the password.  It wasn't pretty but I made it work.  Thanks for everyone's help on this.  In the end it looks like most of my problem was cygwin related.\n", "Q: How to make brew installed software take effect over the manually installed one? I have an older version of software that I once manually installed through installation package (version 0.6.6 -- I write it down here for later discussion purpose, but the version number is not relevant to this question).\nNow I found brew is better why to manage the update/upgrade etc. So, I use brew to install the software by doing brew install terraform (version 0.6.9 -- again, I write it down here for later discussion purpose, but the version number is not relevant to this question), which is all good so far.\nHowever, when I do terraform version to query the current effective version, I found it's still the old version.\nMy question is how I can make the brew installed software take over.\nA side question is that which I try to find out terraform's location, by run which terra (hit tab now), which I normally do for other software, the tab won't do the auto complete action for me. Why is that?\n\nA: The easiest solution would be to simply delete the old version of the software.\nIf you want to keep both, you'll need to change your $PATH environment variable so that the location of the new version appears before the location of the old version. Do this by editing ~/.bash_profile.\n", "Q: Using my Dads music on my iPhone? When my Dad died last year we put his iphone away in a drawer for safe keeping, because his music was very important to him and obviously we didn't want to lose it.\nThe phone is getting hard to hold a charge now and I'm wondering if there is a way to put his music into my iPhone? I bought a 64gig iPhone to have enough room to fit it all on but now I've realised it isn't as easy as I first thought.\nIs there a way to do this or do I just have to hope the battery never completely fails on his phone?\n\nA: There is no 'official' way to pull music from any iDevice back to a computer, but there are many unofficial apps that can do it.\nThe basic idea is that you get the music off the iDevice & into iTunes, from where you can then keep it or re-sync it to your own device.\nI know of no way to do this directly from phone to phone, you must have a computer as an intermediary.\nGoogling \"copy music from iPhone to computer\" will give you more variants on applications than you would know what to do with - & also I don't know what computer platform you have, so I'm linking to a LifeHacker article explaining how to do it on Windows, Mac & Linux.\nHow to Copy Music from Your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to Your Computer for Free\n", "Q: What does hitting the tab button do in terminal? In Terminal, if I hit  tab  twice, Terminal asks if I want to list all 1580 possibilities. What is this, and what is this used for?\n\nA: Pressing 'Tab' in terminal autocompletes commands and/or paths. Pressing it twice while there are no any part of any command/path is entered proposes to you to show all possible commands.\n", "Q: how to delay the login items to start I use a program to deal with the contents in sd card on startup. But the problem is that the program always starts before I can see the sd card in the finder.  As a result, the program can't find the contents and can't run correctly. I think whether I can delay the startup time of a specified program in login items preference.\n\nA: Make a simple bash script, that starts on startup instead:\n#!/bin/bash\n#Wait for however long you want:\nsleep <num of seconds>\n#Use the following if the program is a .app:\nopen -a /path/to/app/myApp.app\n#Use the following if the program is an executable (not a .app):\n/path/to/exec/theExec\n\nNow, save the file to your documents folder as startupScript.bash. \nNote: If you use textedit to create the file, hold down  shift  +  command  +  T  before saving it.\nOpen up \"Terminal\".

I am unable to do either of these options.\nIs there any way for me to play my old files without spending about $50 to get iLife '11?\n\nA: This assumes you already have the initial pack loaded & need what used to be the 3 additional \"Jam Packs\"…\nWould you consider 5 bucks worth it, to stay on Garageband 10?\nGarageBand menu > Download More Sounds\nIf you previously purchased this content, select Restore Purchase to install the content\n[I'm not certain if 'previously purchased' includes the iLife purchase, but it would be worth testing]\nSource : Apple KB - Expanding GarageBand for Mac (v10.0) content with an in-app purchase\nAlternatively, if you don't already have the first Jam pack fully loaded, this might be a solution…\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open GarageBand and either create a new project or open an existing one (don’t worry, we won’t be making any edits to the project).\n  \n*Navigate to the Loops section by clicking on the Loops button in the lower right corner of the application.\n  \n*Next, you have to find a Loop that GarageBand knows exists, but has yet to be downloaded. It appears Apple let GarageBand know that there are other Loops in existence that were not opted to be included in the base install of the application.\nThe easiest way I’ve found to do this is to first Click on the “Rock/Blues” category to narrow the number of Loops displayed, and then find the “70s Ballad Drums 01”; which will appear slightly greyed out and its icon will be an empty box with a dashed border.\n  \n*Double-click on the missing Loop, and a rather large (and semi-confusing) dialogue box appears. In short, you want to select the “Download Now” option and click OK.\n  \n*Next, you need to open the App Store application and navigate to the Updates tab. Once there, you will find the ‘Update’ to GarageBand nestled under Software Updates for OS X. It is entitled “GarageBand Instruments and Apple Loops 1.0”.\nEven though the large dialogue box in GarageBand said the update would be downloaded “now”; when I went through this process it did not automatically start the download. This may be due to how I have automatic updates turned off on my machine (for development reasons); so it may have already started downloading for you at this point, but just make sure the 'Update’ is downloading and you’ll be good to go!\nOne quick thing to note: you will have to quit and reopen GarageBand before you can start using the new software instruments and Loops that were downloaded.\n\nSource : How To Update GarageBand with Nearly 1,000 Instruments and Loops for Free!\n", "Q: Can I access an OS X Yosemite Time Machine backup if I revert to OS X Mavericks? I've had problems with Yosemite since I've installed it but I'm also wondering if it is even worth it to revert since I've done everything on Yosemite?\n\nA: Generally speaking, no, you can't simply 'restore' from a newer version of TM to an older OS.\nThat said, you can access the data.  And, if you understand how TimeMachine works at the UNIX level, you can use the hardlinks created to manually restore what you'd like.\n", "Q: How do I change a device name from the iCloud web site? My family has several iPhones listed under the \"Find my iPhone\" section of the iCloud web site. Unfortunately, they all have the same name \"'s iPhone\".\nTwo of the phones are older models and have been given to other family members. One of them I have been able to change the name directly on the device. The other I cannot change the name directly on the device because the device currently won't power up.\nOne day I hope to fix this, so I don't want to remove the device from the account.  But at the same time, it's annoying having two devices with the same name. The other device is correctly named, so I don't want to change its name, I want to change the name of the (currently) inoperative device.\nHow can I do this directly from the iCloud web site?\n\nA: You change the name on each device in: Settings > General > About > Name.\nThe web site only reports what the device calls itself and does not offer a push rename feature or relabel feature.\n", "Q: Increase VRAM on Mac mini Late 2012 I would like to increase the VRAM in my Mac mini Late 2012. I read on a couple of websites that upgrading the RAM will increase the VRAM. However, I upgraded from 4 GB of RAM to 16 GB which did not affect the VRAM, which is still at 1536 MB.\nIs there a way to increase the VRAM?  \n\nA: You can indeed increase the amount of VRAM in certain Apple models.  In fact, you have already done that for 1 or 2 times.\n\n\n*\n\n*2012 Mac Mini 4GB allocated 768MB to VRAM in it's original release state.\nUpgrading the RAM back in 2012 to 8GB would have given you 1024MB.\nKeeping the RAM at 4GB but upgrading to OSX 10.9 would also resulted in 1024MB.\nFollowing your claim that you have 1536MB available this might be the result of either OSX 10.9.3 or because of the 2nd 8GB.  I don't know.\nI probably still have a 2012 Mac Mini somewhere in the cupboard and will test this soon.\n\n*2013/2014 MBA and MBPr models came with 1024MB out of the box.\nThis was also increased to 1536MB after installing OSX 10.9.3\nThere might be more models that have received a free VRAM upgrade in the past but I have no direct records of these.\n\nA: VRAM is only included on dedicated graphics cards. On other computers (such as the Mac mini), the OS reserves a portion of RAM for use with an integrated graphics processor. There's no way to adjust this. Some Macs will adjust the amount of VRAM they use dynamically, but there's still a maximum amount it will use, and you can't change that.\n", "Q: How can I see if an OS X install disc is compatible with the computer I'm installing on? I have an old Mac Mini G4. I'm trying to do a fresh OS install on it.

These disks are labeled with the OS version, but offer no indication of which Macs I can use them on. \nIs there a way to check which Macs can be installed from a given installation CD/DVD? \n\nA: Here is a complete list of all OS X versions and builds included with Mac computers. To get the build number of a DVD check the /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist file that is on the Install Media.\nThe string value for the Key ProductBuildVersion is the information you are looking for.\nNow you can either check all of the bundled DVDs for the proper build number of your Mac Mini G4 or you can hack any of the DVDs (which potentially could be installed on your Mac) and include your machine in the \"allowed\" targets.\nAs an alternative you may \"search\" for a proper retail version.\n\nA: If you check the listings for everymac.com, the site lists the software version each machine ships with.\nThe early G4 mac minis (1.25GHz & 1.42Gz) shipped with 10.3.7, later version shipped with 10.4.2.\nIf you have multiple macs with firewire & dvd drives, you can force the secondary mac to target drive mode, and use the TDM mac as an external DVD drive for the mac mini; from what I have heard, you can use gray install disks in an external optical drive, bypassing the gray DVD install lock.\n", "Q: 10.11.2: QuickLook and thumbnails crashing finder I have a strange problem: Finder crashes (\"not responding\") after performing one of these:\n\n\n*\n\n*pressing space on a file that can be previewed with QuickLook, e.g. a sound file or an image\n\n*simply selecting a file that can be previewed with QuickLook when the finder displays the instant QuickLook pane\n\n\nAlso, all my thumbnails are not displayed.

There is a program called gfxCardStatus (https://gfx.io) which gives the user some control over whether the integrated or discrete graphics are being used. It does not work perfectly - sometimes the discrete GPU will be activated even when I don't want it to, and I have to turn it back off quickly - but you may find it useful.\nFor some applications which would otherwise use the discrete GPU, you can allow them to stay with integrated graphics by adding a boolean variable NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching with value true to their Info.plist, using the following Terminal command: (link)\ndefaults write <path to app>/Contents/Info.plist NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching -bool YES\n\nor you can add this setting to the plist by hand.\nFinally, you might want to try taking your machine to an Apple Store. Even though the free repair program has officially ended, they may still do the repair (logic board replacement) without charge if you ask.\nUpdate:\nAny official repair from Apple is not possible anymore: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203554 The machine is now of vintage status.\n\nA: This is a known problem from Apple. I made a program to fix this issue. You can check it out here, it's free and open-source : https://github.com/julian-poidevin/MBPMid2010_GPUFix/\n", "Q: Which adapter to get in order to use Dell U2515H with Thunderbolt port? I have MacBook Pro (late 2013) and I'm considering getting Dell U2515H QHD monitor. The MBP has two Thunderbolt ports.\nThe monitor supports DisplayPort and DisplayPort 1.2.\nWhich adapter I need to get in order to use the Dell U2515H with my MBP?\n\nA: The MacBook Pro Thunderbolt ports are fully compatible with DisplayPort so as long as you have a DisplayPort cable, there is no need for an adapter.\nI own 2x Dell U2715H myself. Dell is so nice to deliver their display with the needed cable. Working like a charm and I love the displays. \n", "Q: Can I boot my recovered SSD as a Mac OS X installation I recovered an SSD from an old, upgraded 2008 Macbook Pro with a broken keyboard in order to recover the data from it.\nInitially I was planning to put it in my other Mac Pro and simply copy the data as if it was another drive, but then another idea came to my mind. What if I could boot that SSD from my Mac Pro? \nI don't know if it's possible to set the SSD as a boot drive and start a MBP installation on another machine. \nOtherwise I though it could be possible to save the drive as an ISO image and boot is using a virtualization software on my other Mac. Is this even possible? (AFAIK virtualization from another Mac is permitted and legal).\n\nA: It depends on the system installed on the SSD. If the Mac Pro is capable of booting with it and it fits physically, then I see no problem why it shouldn't work.\n\n\n*\n\n*MacPro1,1 - 2,1: max system version: 10.7.5\n\n*MacPro3,1 - 6,1: max system version: latest\n\n*all MacBookPros 2008 (4,1 and 5,1) can run the latest system\n\n\nUsually all necessary drivers for any Mac (which can run the system) are included in a standard system install.\nThere is only one exception: systems for new Macs with absolutely new hardware usually contain new drivers though the minor system version number is equal to the general current one. The build number is different though. The newly released Mac can't start from the general system release valid for all other Macs.\n", "Q: Desktop backgrounds keep switching position I've had a problem with my Mac Pro since I first bought it. I have a setup with six 1920x1080 screens (3 screens wide, 2 screens high). I've processed some nice (large) photos, so I could set them on these screens and still make it look like one big photo. I've calculated and cut out the bezels from the photos and it looked very nice. The problem though: my Mac can't seem to remember which one goes where. An example:\n\n\n\nLooks nice, doesn't it? Yet, I regularly boot my Mac and see this:\n\n\n\nThe photos that are actually part of my background have been moved to a different screen and then there are two parts from older desktop background that have been reintroduced (bottom left and right).\nI've tried removing every single folder from the background selection dialog window, and just adding the one I want (if that helped, I could live with it), but it doesn't seem to help. Every single OSX update (I've just updated tot 10.11.3) gives me a little hope that it's fixed, but it never is.\nDo you guys have any idea how I can keep the backgrounds in place, or, stretch a single image between multiple monitors (preferably without third party software).\nIn case you wonder, the Mac does remember where the displays are relative to each other. I can move my cursor between screens without a problem.\nI look forward to your response(s).\nMac Pro, OS X El Capitan (10.11.3)\n\nA: Try to do these things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check that you have this option unchecked. I am sure you have it unchecked, but just in case :) It may be set to 'Change picture: When logging in'. So let's make sure that this is not the reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Then you may try to enter following command in terminal:\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Desktop.­plist\nAfter this, set your desktop pictures again, reboot and see if it helped.\n\n*This may be strange, but try to uncheck this option:\n\nIt's not actually resetting your backgrounds but creating a new desktop   space on every boot. Check your spaces by pressing the mission control button (F3 on mac keyboard), it should show a bunch of desktops.\nAnyway, let me know the result (via comment). Question is interesting.\n", "Q: Group dictionaries in Dictionary.app I've installed extra dictionaries in Dictionary.app. It's over 9Gb. I'd like to group them by language as is shown in the image below. I've tried to rename their labels in the app, tried editing the Bundle name in Info.plist, but it's not working (dictionaries have same name but not group).

Today the phone seems to be completely functional other than a very dark screen (changing brightness won't help). \nWas wondering what the best course of action would be and if this is fixable.\n\nA: If you had been able to turn it off right away, and put it in a bag of rice, I have seen that work for some people, at least for a limited time. There are claims out there of various methods.\nBut if the screen is bad, at minimum you have to replace that, that's virtually certain. You don't say what model it is, so not sure whether that's possible or how much it might cost.\nTry the rice thing for a few days, you have nothing to lose at this point. When I used to take calls for Applecare I had several customers tell me this worked, the idea being the rice would suck the water out. I don't believe it's really a great idea but it can't hurt at this point.\nHaving said that, your phone is pretty much toast, per the other answer. When I was lent out to the Apple store, we saw Macbooks and phones come in where the customer said they had \"dried it out\" but \"it wasn't working\" a few weeks later.\nInvariably we'd open the thing up and see some residual water in there.\nSorry to say, you are probably on the road to a new phone. :( Now if you try a third-party place to repair it, at least the last time I worked for Apple about a year ago, if you put third-party parts in there Apple will never touch it to do a repair. Unlike Macs where you don't \"void the warranty,\" any third party parts in an iOS device precludes Apple from doing any repairs in the future.\nSo balance out free (rice) vs. third-party screen (cheaper) vs. shiny new iPhone 6S!!\n\nTo clarify a statement above, with Mac products, if you add a third-party hard drive, for example, or memory, PROPERLY, without damaging anything in the process, you can still take your Mac to an Apple store for service and warranty. \nAgain this was a year ago, the last time I dealt with it, but if an Apple Specialist or Genius opens up an iOS product and sees a third-party screen or battery, etc, they immediately stop working on it, in most all cases. You'd be amazed how fine an eye these Geniuses have for sniffing out third-party screens -- so I'd only go third-party (non-Apple) parts on something that's out of warranty.\n\nA: I've revived quite a few water-damaged iPhones myself. In fact, I just fixed a water-damaged iPhone 4 a couple weeks ago. I'd take it into a repair shop and at least see what they can do.\n\nA: Liquid is the kiss of death for most electronics, it is not worth your time trying to fix. It will manifest itself in other areas later and go from bad to worse. If I were you, I'd look into replacement options. \n\nA: Fill tupperware, or other container halfway with uncooked white rice. \nPower-off phone, and place it in the container. \nCover phone with rice, leave for 1 - 2 hours, then flip over and leave for a few more.  \nRemove from container.\nPower on the phone.  \nIf this does not work you either have water trapped inside (in which case you can try looking into carefully disassembling the phone, and placing uncovered parts in a new container of fresh rice...) \nOr you have a damaged part, that can be replaced at a shop.  \n\nA: All these posts about iPhones not being worth being fixed once wet is false. You can use 100% rubbing alcohol and submerse the main board into it for 10 minutes take the board out and dry it thoroughly then put it all back together. Most of the time the screen is not salvageable and needs to be replaced. If you replace the screen be very careful with the home button and the ribbon connecting it to the screen if\nYou damage it the Touch ID will not work. \nHope this helps, check out YouTube I've seen a few good videos on there aswell which show you how to do what I have mentioned step by step.\n\nA: So much misinformation here. First, Apple is not legally allowed to refuse warranty repairs just because you have used third party replacement parts, unless it is that part that is damaged. This is a violation of the Magnusson-Moss Act, and Apple knows this.\nSecond, rice most certainly CAN work, as long as physical damage has not already occurred to the chips.\nIf it has, the problem is almost always with the backlights circuit on the logic board, usually a blown filter.\nWhile replacing these requires some level of micro soldering skills, it certainly is not the case that any such device is \"pretty much toast\".\nIf you do not have soldering skills, any number of shops can do the job for you, for far less than replacing the phone.\nAlso, since the filter is on the main board, replacing the screen won't help you at all.\n\nA: Go to ifixit.com and check their tutorials on how to replace iPhone screens.\nOne good thing to do when electronic gets wet is to dry it straight away with a hairdryer, turning it off immediately prior to the drying is a good advice too.\n", "Q: Preventing quit of Firefox I'm planning to show a presentation of my websites to friends on Firefox, but I do not want them to exit full screen and terminate the Firefox application, but only to click the elements on the screen, similar to the browsing of computers in a store?\nHow is this possible?\n\nA: There are several Add Ons which provide Kiosk modes for Firefox. You should search Here.\nFor several card catalog search stations in my school's Library, I've been used the Kiosk Mode in the iCab browser for many years.\nKiosk mode - While in Kiosk mode, iCab will cover the whole screen and all other applications are blocked. The Kiosk mode is the ideal environment when the computer is accessing a public place (like fairs, exhibitions, hotels etc.) where users should be able to obtain information, yet prevent any external access to your system. Additionally, the access can be restricted to certain pages (even refusing referrals, if you choose).\n", "Q: How can I turn on opening a link in another app again? I'm using iOS 9.2 and I once accidentally tapped “don't allow” or something similar when WhatsApp was opening a link for Citymapper. It used to launch the Citymapper app, but now it goes to the less useful web interface.\nI've looked through all the settings but I can't find any record of this preference to reset the permission.\nMetadata on page:\n<meta property=\"al:ios:url\" content=\"citymapper://directions?endcoord=51.56819%2C-0.086512&region_id=uk-london\" />\n<meta property=\"al:ios:app_store_id\" content=\"469463298\" />\n<meta property=\"al:ios:app_name\" content=\"Citymapper\" />\n<meta property=\"al:android:package\" content=\"com.citymapper.app.release\" />\n<meta property=\"al:android:app_name\" content=\"Citymapper\" />\n<meta property=\"al:android:url\" content=\"citymapper://directions?endcoord=51.56819%2C-0.086512&region_id=uk-london\" />\n\n\nA: If I'm reading the documentation correctly, when the web interface pops up in Safari, there should be a banner across the top of the page that essentially says, \"Hey, you could view this info in the app instead!\" If you tap OPEN on that banner, it's supposed to re-establish the universal linking to the app instead of the website. Here it is in Apple's words:\n\nWhen a user taps a universal link that [an app] handle[s], iOS also examines the user’s recent choices to determine whether to open [the] app or [the] website. For example, a user who has tapped a universal link to open [the] app can later choose to open [the] website in Safari by tapping a breadcrumb button in the status bar. After the user makes this choice, iOS continues to open [the] website in Safari until the user chooses to open [the] app by tapping OPEN in the Smart App Banner on the webpage.\n\nSource: Universal Links in Apple's App Search Programming Guide\n\nA: Try long pressing the link in what's app. you should then get a choice to open in the app or in safari.\n", "Q: How do I bring my Quicktime DV from 2013 to life? Back in 2012/2013 I've imported a stack of home video tapes from my DV camera into iMovie. I also converted a lot of files created by earlier versions of iMovie, some of them dating back as far as 2003 or thereabouts.\nFor as much as 2 years I haven't touched iMovie or those files. What I did do was update my OSX and all my apps along with it, including iMovie. I'm now on El Capitan (wish I Kept Yosemite) and my iMovie cannot read the iMovie files dating from 2012/13. \nAny thoughts? Tools?\n\nA: Apple fully rewrote iMovie in version 10.x. For iMovie 2014 to open projects of iMovie versions 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x (iMovie '08, '09, '11) you have to use iMovie's 'update' feature which changes previous project files into the new format. To do that, you place the old folders named 'iMovie Projects' and 'iMovie Events' into your current 'Movies' folder. More details here:  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202853\nFor even older iMovie project formats ('iMovie HD') one would have to use  import them in iMovie '11 first (File > Import > iMovie HD Project) to bring them into that format, then 'update' the imported projects in iMovie 2014. However, when importing these very old formats into iMovie '11, they get stripped of added audio files, transition effects and titles.\n", "Q: I can't access my music.

This is not as good as listening to the music I've purchased. \nHow can I get back to the good ol days of listening to my music rather than looking at this bird?\n\nA: Click \"GO TO MY MUSIC\". If the button isn't available, maybe the app froze. Press the Home-Button twice (quickly) and slide the app to the top to force-quit it. Then reopen it.\n", "Q: How can I retrieve photos from an iPhone 4 without using wifi(probably) or cell data? So I am blinded by anger at this point. I cannot believe this isn't possible in some way.\nIn short:\nIphone 4 has a bad battery, photos filling storage, out of date Ios so no wifi, 3g data available is much less than the amount needed to move. This ideally would be solved without leaving the house because it shouldn't be this hard in the first place and also blizzard.\nHere are the specifics, along with some rough ideas:\nMy mother has an iphone 4 that is completely full of photos. She will not delete any significant amount of them.\nWifi is greyed out because IOS is out of date and my mom does not apply any software update ever at all. Can I FORCE wifi on somehow? I am familiar with linux and windows and android, I know I could force that flag somehow on those devices...\nI cannot update IOS because it requires 1.6 GB of free space, in the storage manager thing if I add up every single app besides photos it does not add up to 1.6gbs. It's all photos. Do I actually need 1.6 gigs in the first place?\nI can pair it with her macbook over bluetooth, but apparently only tethering is supported because Apple, I can't pair it with my android devices because Apple.\n Is there any way to break that restriction to access the iphones storage? the devices can see each other well enough for apple to tell me to f*** myself... \nI may have a bluetooth capable windows laptop, if I do I could use a linux live cd or stick and this adds a bluetooth linux laptop as well, but not bt windows/linux at the same time.\nThe phone has 3g data, but her data cap is half used and the total amount of photos is triple the entire plan anyhow, having her move 1.6 gigs of pictures one by one over email or text is out because of that and general sanity. Also Icloud can't be made to update over 3g because apple.\nThe battery is bad, so it will only boot from a wall charger, I can't plug it into another computer and have it run.\nSo can I make a USB port on another computer pump out more juice?\n-I have an old desk that has a power supply embedded into the back, It has two usb ports, a regular plug jack and of course the power cord to the wall. Can I reconfigure that to function as a hub maybe?\nWhat I really don't want to hear though I may have to is:take it to a store, replace battery or go to a store and get a battery to replace yourself.\nParticularly I don't want to go to an apple store because some hapless kid will get a feature rich/function poor brick punched right through their face.\n-sorry I am so angry about this. I thought it would take ten minutes when she asked me to get the photos, but if someone asked me a question like this about stuff I normally use(I don't deal much with apple) I would find it a fascinating challenge, so I figured I'd ask, and every google search I've ever made for deep tech stuff has led me to stackexchange eventually.\n\nA: As a sidenote, the phones WiFi chip seems to be defective, WiFi will work no matter how old the iOS-version is. Maybe try resetting network settings in Settings - General.\nAnyhow - I believe your only option will be to use a cable to get the pictures off the phone. Have you tried all the computers you have at home? Some devices give out more juice than others. Another way would of course be some cloud service, then again, not the best option without WiFi..\n", "Q: Music on my iPhone 5s is gone! Went to play tunes while working out the other day. I tapped on the Music app to open my playlists and all that appears is an image of a girl with headphones on. No playlists...no songs...no way to proceed to any of my music. Anybody else missing their music via Bluetooth?\n\nA: Yes it happened to me also. After you launch the app, wait a few seconds and it will give you the option to join Apple Music, or go to your music. Click \"Go To My Music\" and you will be all set.

The TV is not an Apple TV. Although the Display dialogue under System Preferences show the option to \"Show mirroring options\" there are no devices detected alongside \"AirPlay Display\". \nI have tried the function \"Detect Displays\", but this makes no difference - the Mac is not able to detect devices.\nCould this be because the Wireless Display Adaptor is a Microsoft device?

I'm trying to figure out the best way to export a large amount of images on my iOS app. There are too many to bundle up and email, and so I am looking at having them exported to iCloud. But if I do that, can the user easily access them for importing into desktop software or similar? Or are they secure and only able to be restored to my app on recovery?\n\nA: If you upload anything to iCloud it will be available to all devices logged into that iCloud account provided there is a way to access the account directly. If I upload a picture to iCloud using my iPhone I can later drag it to my desktop on my Mac. In OS X (I believe in Yosemite and later) there is the \"iCloud Drive\" folder in the sidebar, (which may or may not be on) which you can use to access this directly. To turn this on\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Finder -> Preferences. (Or press ⌘+,)\n\n*Go to the Sidebar tab.\n\n*Check iCloud Drive.\n\n\nOf course you'll also need to be signed into iCloud Drive and have it turned on which is possible in System Preferences -> iCloud.\niOS 9 also includes an \"iCloud Drive\" app which gives pretty much the same view. The only difference is non-Mac devices may not be able to open files that you put up there, but since you're uploading images that's fine as long as they're in a supported format.\nOn a non-Apple device there's always iCloud.com.\nThings in iCloud will stay in iCloud until the user deletes them. Or unless iCloud servers get blown up. Whichever comes first.\nHowever if these images are to be published in some way other than for personal use you should probably use FTP and allow the user to upload them elsewhere. Though this would be for something along the lines of a web design app.\n", "Q: Recovery: OS X Yosemite can not mount NTFS partition but windows can mount it in 10 minutes I have a Seagate GoFlex 2TB external HDD that stopped working one month ago. The head of this external disk seeks continuously and produces sounds even when it is not connected to the USB port.\nOn OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 it takes about 5 minutes to detect its hardware and show its icon in Disk Utility or in diskutil list. When my mac detects the hardware it shows Initialize/Ignore/Eject message and no more thing happens.\nOn Windows 7 it takes about 10 minuets (while the progress bar fills) to mount it. But it is very very slow on every operation. For example it takes 2 minutes to open a folder and so on.\nIf its partition is lost, why OS X cannot mount it? Is it a time out problem for OS X in mounting operation? How can i backup its contents with preserving folder structure faster?\n\nA: If you can't back it up on OS X, then back it up on Windows. Then format it something else other than NTFS, as OS X doesn't officially support it. If you re-format it using Windows, you can choose the default FAT/exFAT option.\n", "Q: Making Command, Option and Control work with microsoft sculpt keyboard?

The external hard drive only contains “basic data” (folders, images, videos, documents, etc.), nothing fancy/weird.\nBut with all the amazing free tools that exist out there I couldn't find a decent one to backup (suggestions accepted).\nI want to automize this. After a few searches, it seems I can use rsync. I want then to automize this by using rsync to avoid copying files that are already on the destination hard drive (of course, if a change has been made, I want to update the file/folder; the same with deleted files/folders or new files/folders; the idea is to mimic what I usually do manually with Finder).\nI got to this point\nrsync -av --progress --delete /Volumes/A/ /Volumes/B\n\nNow the log is full of files which name starts with . or ._ or even ._.. Are they necessary?\nQuestion\nHow can I copy only the files that matter, leaving all those that don't matter behind. For example, if I have photo.png I would expect to copy photo.png, not ._photo.png or many files.\nWhat --exclude or --exclude-from can be used safely on a Mac? May be a good rule is “just copy anything that Finder shows” which is what I would copy if I passed manually through all folders.\n Extra question\nIs -av --progress --delete enough? Am I committing a crime or risking some data? What options would you use.\nPlease, back your answer with some arguments, I would appreciate it.\nI'm looking for a way to automate rsync which seems quite powerful and free to use.\n\nA: I'm not completely pleased with the current answers, but I will try to cover here a bit of the possibilities that I've seen on the web trying to find a nice setup for rsync.\nAnd, by the way, if one is interested in Time Machine like copies, there's rsnapshot. And there's also Unison for two way syncronizations. Plus, there's actually a few GUIs, like Backup Utility and arRsync; not exactly what I was looking for but they might do the job for somebody.\nFirst, my only intention was to duplicate photos and videos, so exact copy wasn't needed, hence no need to care too much. In fact most of my doubts were if I could exclude everything (the same that would happen if, say, I downloaded a photo from the internet, I just download a .png, everything else is not downloaded but autogenerated).\nHere's an unstructured list of thoughts that you may want to take in account\n\n\n*\n\n*I you want to ensure that your laptop doesn't go to sleep, you may want to caffeinate the process caffeinate -s rsync -av .... Taken from here.\n\n*If you are doing local copies, like in my case, or even if internet connection is not too slow, you should not use -z option (compression), and use -W (transfer whole file, rather than delta transfers; this is a default when local) and probably use --inplace to make transfers fast. Taken from here.\n\n*You can use --delete-after so any file will be first transferred, and then moved on destination (and deleted the original one) and is safer than deleting before the transfer or during the transfer.\n\n*You can stop the transfer by pressing ctrl + C, and it will stop cleanly. Taken from here. This was one of my fears with SuperDuper!, if you need to stop a transfer you get the message “You will leave the hard drive in an unknown state…”.\n\n*In recent versions there's --info=progress2 which adds even more details to -v.\n\n*There's -P (which equals --partial and --progress) that will leave mid-transferred files there so you can keep going when you restart the process (if for some reason you can't end the syncronization at once).\n\n*One might be interested in stopping Spotlight or TimeMachine before doing the copy, and reenable them after the transfer. And even disable Spotlight for the external disk.\n\n*Other options used in all those references include -x (or --one-file-system), -E (--executability), -H (--hard-links), -X (--xattrs), -A (--acls), and --sparse, --hfs-compression, --protect-decmpfs. You may want to look at them.\nFor me, a basic command looks like (I might use more options, but this is enough for an example):\ncaffeinate -s rsync -av --delete-after --progress --stats --exclude-from 'excludefile.txt' \\\n  \"/Volumes/SrcHDD/\" \"/Volumes/DstHDD\" # note the trailing slash / after the source\n\nNow in my case I could just include {*.jpg,*.png,*.mp4,*.txt,*.pdf,…} and no one would say “you need also system files” but since I don't want to search to get all the possible filetype I have files of, I prefer to exclude. And there are things that not only can be but seem convenient to exclude.\nI found a few links, take what you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bombich.com/kb/ccc4/some-files-and-folders-are-automatically-excluded-from-backup-task\n\n*https://gist.github.com/tvwerkhoven/4541989\n\n*https://github.com/necolas/dotfiles\n\n*https://gist.github.com/shkm/5531679\n\n*http://www.hackurmac.com/2014/08/backing-up-and-restoring-your-hackintosh.html\n\n*https://github.com/jedda/Counterpart\n\n*http://alanwsmith.com/rsync-exclude-list-for-mac-osx\nAnd from there you could probably get what's safe or sane to ignore.

On my Catalina system /usr/bin/rsync --version reports itself as ver 2.6.9; released in Nov, 2006. The rsync release history since ver 2.6.9 seems to make it clear that Apple's decision to halt upgrades for rsync on their OS was based entirely upon the rsync team's decision to switch to the GPLv3 license. This is unfortunate because rsync ver 3.0 (the release following 2.6.9) included significant upgrades specifically supporting macOS users:\n\n*\n\n*--xattrs : preserves OS X extended attributes\n\n*--acls : preserves OS X Access Control Lists\n\n*--fake-super : allows non-admin users to preserve all attributes\n\nThe point of the above paragraph is simply this: If you want to use rsync to back up files on your macOS, you must have a later version than the one Apple provides.  Otherwise, you will lose all xattrs and ACLs - metadata that plays a significant role in several features of macOS. This is easily verified with a simple experiment.\nFortunately, current versions of rsync are available from 3rd party macOS package managers (MacPorts for example), or for the DIY-inclined, you can clone the rsync GitHub repo and build it from source.\nIt's also worth noting that a current version of rsync can repair/restore a backup made previously using Apple's native rsync ver 2.6.9. It can also repair/restore xattrs, ACLs and date-timestamps that have been  mangled or lost by Apple's \"Migration Assistant\".\nrsync is a mature & comprehensive package with numerous options. Many of these options are not obvious choices, and one can spend a fair amount of time developing an option set to meet specific objectives. While there are no real shortcuts to careful consideration of your own use-case, I'll suggest the following option sets as a reasonable generic rsync command for general use on macOS - a \"point of departure\" in other words. You may further tailor these to meet your own needs.\nI'll present two cases for using rsync to backup and restore; one using the --delete option, and one without. Both cases assume the local Macintosh HD is the source for the backup operation, and the destination for the restore operation. In my own case, there are some folders (e.g. Documents) for which I prefer to use the --delete option, and other folders (e.g. Music, Pictures & Movies) in which I do not use --delete. This is a personal choice that reflects how I manage/organize my data.\nIn the context of rsync, the --delete option simply means that deletions you make on your source folders are propagated to your destination folders.\nWithout the --delete option:\n1. In a BACKUP operation:\ni.   Source: /MacHD_Folder/\nii.  Destination: /mountpoint/for/remote/storage\nrsync -rlAXtgoDiv --fake-super /MacHD_Folder/ /mountpoint/for/remote/storage\n\n2. In a RESTORE operation:\ni.   Source: /mountpoint/for/remote/storage\nii.  Destination: /MacHD_Folder/\nrsync -rlAXtgoDiv --fake-super /mountpoint/for/remote/storage/ /MacHD_Folder \n\nWith the --delete option:\n1. In a BACKUP operation:\ni.   Source: /MacHD_Folder/\nii.  Destination: /mountpoint/for/remote/storage\nrsync -rlAXtgoDiv --fake-super --delete --backup-dir=/mountpoint/for/remote/storage/deletes /MacHD_Folder/ /mountpoint/for/remote/storage\n\n2. In a RESTORE operation::\ni.   Source: /mountpoint/for/remote/storage\nii.  Destination: /MacHD_Folder/\nrsync -rlAXtgoDiv --fake-super /mountpoint/for/remote/storage/ /MacHD_Folder \n\nNote the asymmetry between backup & restore operations when using the --delete option. This due to the fact that nothing need be deleted for the restore operation. Note also use of the --backup-dir option when using the --delete option: This causes rsync to move all deleted files & folders to the designated folder on the destination drive. You may think of this as a form of \"insurance\" for deleted files - it functions as the Trash folder does on your local MacHD.\nFurther Reading:\nThis GitHub recipe offers further explanations and useful options.\n\nA: I have used rsync for backups at several jobs, and I use it at home.\nI highly recommend it, but with some modifications. As a backup tool, it's great, but as an archiving tool it falls a little flat. Yes, it copies everything, but you don't get versions of everything, you always get the latest versions only.\nI used this guide http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/ as a jumping-off point. Read the whole page. It does a great job of explaining the options, and outlines how you can implement incremental backups. And amazingly, the article is over 10 years old but is still applicable today. Gotta love unix.\n\nA: For Maximum Safety, Copy Everything\nThe safest option is to copy everything, including invisible meta-data files.\nFiles tend to exist for a reason and as software changes, so will the existence, purpose, and contents of these meta-data files. Copying everything will reduce the maintenance burden and offer ease of mind that nothing is being lost.\nThe log file created by rsync will be technically involved by the very nature of rsync being a command line tool. Consider presenting a tidied up, meta-data filtered, and maybe even coloured coded output for the user to check. You could do this with a wide range of scripting tools and languages. Please ask more questions here on Ask Different and on StackOverflow if you need help with this approach.\nDelete Last & Copy OS X Resources\nRegarding the rsync flags, take a look at the question Fastest and safest way to copy massive data from one external drive to another. In this question, a few additional flags are used and explained:\nsudo rsync -vaE --progress --delete-after /Volumes/SourceName /Volumes/DestinationName\n\nIn this situation, the E will ensure resource forks and other Mac specific properties are copied.\nYou may want to consider --delete-after to avoid deleting until the copy has completed; please note that this approach will potentially require a destination drive twice the size of the source.\nPossible Exclusions\nAn answer to a related question, How can I omit FCPX Render Files from a Time Machine backup?, provided a useful link of OS X files and folders that can be excluded from most back-ups. This link provides a practical list of file patterns, folders, and paths that you could exclude.\nInclude dot Files\nThere are good reasons to back up files beginning with dots, .* matching files.\nSome software keeps preferences, settings, and other information of value in folders at the top of the user's folder in invisible dot prefixed folders. Running ls -la ~/ will reveal these folders and files.\nIf any user uses or has software that in turn uses version control software, be sure to back-up dot files. Software like subversion and git both store critical information within their dot folders. These hidden folders can be scattered across your file system, where ever a project is checked out.\nSpotlight and Disk Access\nSpotlight is OS X's search service. Spotlight uses the mdworker process to index and update the search catalogue. If you are concerned about possible disk corruption or slow copies, disabling mdworker while running rsync may help. Personally, I leave Spotlight running while running large rsync transfers.\n", "Q: Use Automator for saving file on NAS, what happen if NAS is not accessible? I'm still new with OS X and have learned how to use Automator for zipping a folder in one file, named with date, on my Hard Disk. I saved the set of actions as an app. I'm planning to use Calendar to run it daily at 1pm. This should work fine.\nI'm using the French language for Automator (trying to translate the called Actions) :\n1. Get elements/items in Finder (I fill in the folder I want to backup)\n2. Create an archive (I fill in the target and the name I want for the archive) – screenshot\nIf I want to save the zip archive on my NAS, (ReadyNAS 312) rather than on my Hard Disk, what will happen at 1PM when the NAS is not working (powered off, no network connectivity, etc.)?\nIn my tiny Automator script, do I have to \"test\" if the NAS is connected before running the archiving action? If so, what is the right (and easy) way with Automator?\n\nA: It's normally a good idea to check for the existence of an external disk before using it. In this case, however, automator won't display an error if the disk is not found, it just won't do anything. I'd say it's safe in this instance.\n", "Q: Preview seems to have corrupted PDF and lost all text and arrow annotations I have used Preview to create a number of annotations for a PDF file. The annotations are a mix of boxes, ovals, text, arrows, etc…\nUpon exiting and reopening Preview, it seems to have lost the majority of the annotations. Many of them still seem to appear in the Inspector's panel for annotations, however, the text is missing from most and many other edits are missing.\nI've also tried recovering an earlier version of the file using Time Machine, and restarting the computer, but all versions past or present display the same corrupted / lost annotations.\nOS X El Capitan 10.11.2\n\nA: I have found a way to get back apparently lost annotations.\nFollowing the most popular answer to this post, \nif you are able to install the utility qpdf,\nwhich I did simply with brew install qpdf, via homebrew,\nthen invocation qpdf  --qdf  original.pdf  unpacked.pdf has produced a file\n\"unpacked.pdf\" which contains my lost notes. \nThese are a little visually corrupted, however this method may be a huge relief if you have lost all of your annotations! - in my case it got back enough so I can trasfer them to a better application. I'm going to try skim.\nMore info: I got a lot back (when opening unpacked.pdf in preview). However I later found a few annotations were not recovered (notes with empty bodies - perhaps any errors which qpdf gives may be suggestive of whether it did a fully recovery or not). \nHowever, I've just managed to get back more which the first unpack missed, by restoring an earlier version from time machine and just doing the same unpack process on that earlier file, which I called unpacked-2 - resorting to that when some yellow notes have empty bodies in my case is giving me a high rate of recovery so far...\n\nA: This seems to be a known problem, you cannot really trust MacOS Preview to display nor preserve annotations. My current technique is to open PDF files with annotations inside of Google Docs.\n\nA: A workaround for me is as follows:\nFile > Export... > Select Format \"PDF\" > Select \"Create PDF/A\" > Save.\nThe created file has all the annotations and they are editable (by my limited experience).\nMy Preview version is 11.0 (1033.3).\n\nA: I have the same problem, on OSX 12.1.\nThere are some related reports:\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63148342/restoring-annotations-from-a-pdf-corrupted-by-macs-preview-application-from-raw\n\n*https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/s25tbj/preview_in_macos_121_partially_lost_my_annotated/\nI found that this tool is able to recover (some? all?) the annotations:\nhttps://julihoh.github.io/pdf_annotation_fix/web-app/dist/index.html\n", "Q: Couldn't open device I can not partition nor use a removable USB disk without file system.\nI obtained the following informations:\nsh-3.2# diskutil info disk2\n   Device Identifier:        disk2\n   Device Node:              /dev/disk2\n   Whole:                    Yes\n   Part of Whole:            disk2\n   Device / Media Name:      IC1100        CF\n\n   Volume Name:              Not applicable (no file system)\n\n   Mounted:                  Not applicable (no file system)\n\n   File System:              None\n\n   Content (IOContent):      None\n   OS Can Be Installed:      No\n   Media Type:               Generic\n   Protocol:                 USB\n   SMART Status:             Not Supported\n\n   Total Size:               8.0 GB (7994327040 Bytes) (exactly 15613920 512-Byte-Units)\n   Volume Free Space:        Not applicable (no file system)\n   Device Block Size:        512 Bytes\n\n   Read-Only Media:          No\n   Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (no file system)\n\n   Device Location:          External\n   Removable Media:          Yes\n   Media Removal:            Software-Activated\n\n   Virtual:                  No\n   OS 9 Drivers:             No\n   Low Level Format:         Not supported\n\nAfter following this guide, I am now able to see the disk in Disk Utility, but it is uninitialized, and when I try to format it, I get the error\nCouldn't open device\nEDIT: I tried the following:\n\n*\n\n*Disk Utility > Erase\n\n*Terminal > diskutil eraseDisk MS-DOS NAME disk2\n\n*Terminal > diskutil eraseVolume MS-DOS NAME disk2\n\n*Terminal > diskutil partitionDisk disk2 1 MBR MS-DOS NAME 7.8GB\nThey ALL lead to the same error: Error: -69877: Couldn't open device\nEDIT 2: This is the partition table:\n    sh-3.2# fdisk -e /dev/disk2\n    fdisk: could not open MBR file /usr/standalone/i386/boot0: No such file or directory\n    The signature for this MBR is invalid.\n    Would you like to initialize the partition table?

Thanks\n(I'm using Mac OS X 10.11.3)\n\nA: Restore a DMG (maybe an OSX InstallESD.dmg or any other application) to the disk/drive via Disk Util. This will overwrite it (deleting all data). Then you can partition again how you like.\nI have encountered this several times myself with USB pen drives as well as SSDs inside a MacBook Air. Formatting and Erasing brought up the exact same errors you describe. DD didn't work out, Resizing the partition gave me an error about corruption on the disk. First Aid/Scanning & Repairing the volume didn't yield any results, the tool completed with the message that there wasn't anything to repair.\nOnly the Restoring of a random DMG to the drives made it manageable again.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Similar problem, so I tried erasing as FAT… (can't remember the exact format) which worked. Then was able to erase again as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). \nI suspect my problem was that I had made the disk a boot drive at some point.\n\nA: I have iMac mid-2011 running on High Sierra. My Time Machine (My Book Studio) failed after it experienced power outage while backing up the files. This external disk became useless; tried every means mentioned in this site to recover the file but to no avail. Typical errors were \"device cannot be opened\", \"no permission\" and disk cannot be opened. Finally I connected the drive to Windows 10 laptop, ran My Book Studio Utility (this app came with My Book Studio), and was able to format the entire disk to NTFS. I reconnected this drive to a laptop running High Sierra, and using Disk Utility was able to reformat  it to Mac OS Extended (Journaled). At least I was able to revive the external drive. Hope this helps.\n\nA: For me the solution was to choose Show All Devices in the View menu:\n\nThen I could select the device and successfully erase it:\n\n\nA: Worked for me too. I had a volume inside a container inside a disk. I was able to erase the volume but not the other two. They all passed First Aid with only the Overallocation remark. The DMG failed at first because I was trying to restore the disk. I then changed to the Container and that solved the problem. Thank you!\n", "Q: Where are iTunes music files located, if they are not in Music/iTunes/iTunes Media? I recently rented a MacBook Pro because I needed to take mine in for a hardware recall. Before giving mine up, I transferred the folder ~/Music/iTunes and the file ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist to the loaner laptop in order to have my music available. (I also made two separate Time Machine backups right before taking it in, and had an online backup service for extra peace of mind.)\nAs it turned out, only a fraction of my library was available in iTunes, some of the oldest files in my collection plus my purchases. (Also, when I made my first iPhone backup on this laptop, that large portion of the library disappeared from Music as well.)\nMy best guess is that, as an inexperienced user sometime in the past, I had turned off \"Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library\" in iTunes Preferences. (I can't know for sure because I don't have my original Mac, but only those older files are in Music/iTunes/iTunes Media.) So as I added new tracks collected over time, they were added to iTunes but somehow not into that media folder.\nI had deleted those source files over time, however, and they remained viable in the iTunes library. So now I am looking for where exactly they were located, so I can try to restore them from backup.\n\nA: The iTunes Library .xml file located at ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Library.xml contains location information for your media files. I just checked and I can pull up locations (or last known locations) of all my tunes from there, even if the files themselves have been moved.\n", "Q: Why does Safari display the letter combination 'fi' as 'if'?

It has something to do with ligature I suppose. You can check typecast.com and see that when You insert fi it automatically is changed to if as You type.\n\nA: It's an official bug, yes. It seems to be solely happening with Merriweather Sans. \nMaybe someone at Apple or on the east coast decided to protest the name of the font? ;)\nSeriously, an update is in the works, and someone here suggests a work-around.\nhttps://github.com/google/fonts/issues/184\n", "Q: sudo and some other system commands not working with platypus I am making a shell script that works great on its own, but does not work correctly when packaged with Platypus. It does not want to execute sudo, and a few other system commands. Are there any work arounds to this?\nNote: This is when you select the \"Run with Administrator privileges\" option. Also, this is an answer-it-yourself question, since I would imagine someone else out there would have this issue as well.\n\nA: You can also use the osascript to launch the application. This ensures sudo access.\nosascript -e \"do shell script \\\"/path2/shellscript.sh $*\\\" with administrator privileges\"\n\nYou can put this in another shell script to call your script. Or directly run your required command within the quotes.\nThis is better since you don't have to rely on /usr/bin/sudo being run recently or not\n\nA: I figured out the issue, it appears Platypus does not recognize some system commands, even though they are in its $PATH. In order to use these system commands, you have to list their absolute path.\nSo, in sudo's case:\n/usr/bin/sudo <commmand>\nOr, in cp's case:\n/bin/cp <arguments>\n", "Q: How to show progressbar in App store during installation?

Is it possible to display progressbar, how much time (estimately) is remaining to finish installation? Or at least a progress bar, that shows, how much percent of size was downloaded / installed? \n\n\nA: There should be a progress bar underneath the Launchpad dock icon.\nIf you removed Launchpad from your dock, open it through Spotlight, then search for the icon of the app you are installing (which in your case would be Xcode). There should be a progress bar and further status information on it.\n\nA: Go to the « Purchased » tab of the Mac App Store.

Executing a Finder search for folders seems limited to searching for folder names beginning with the search term. I can't search for folder names only using a characters in the middle or end. I'm having to resort to using the find command from Terminal. Any way around this? Below is a sample folder and multiple search attempts:\n\n\nThis is my first post here so I can only post two images, apparently. I have an additional screen shot showing a search for \"jo\" which indeed reveals every subfolder beginning with \"jo\". I have a fourth screen shot showing that a search for \"bert\" fails to return \"robertson\" \"colbertson\" etc. Those searches were both name-based searches with the same \"kind\" restriction to folders only.\nWhat's up with this?\n\nA: I haven't found a way to get variables in spotlight, but I must be misinformed since that seems so useful to not implement.\nThat being said, I use terminal and mdfind to parse spotlight like you have all the time.\nmdfind \"kMDItemFSName == '*son' && kMDItemKind == 'Folder'\"\n\nThat will show you all folders ending in son and you might want to grep for the \"sample names\" folder name to replicate the search you have illustrated or use the -onlyin command:\nmdfind -onlyin dir \"kMDItemFSName == '*son' && kMDItemKind == 'Folder'\"\n\nYou can drag the folder into terminal to get a properly escaped name with spaces encoded and then paste that in place of dir\n\nA: In Finder try using this:\nKind is Folder\nName ends with son\n\nThis should display all folders ending with \"son\".\nTry also, begins with and contains for similar searches.\n\n", "Q: Display of downloaded files with the Dock icon Using a Mac, with the downloads folder placed on the Dock, the downloaded files were displayed in a linear curved stack (when clicked) with the last downloaded files on the bottom and earlier downloads atop of it. This was convenient for managing recent downloads. Now, for some mysterious reason, clicking the downloads icon on my Dock yields a n by m display of icons within which I can't identify the latest downloads. \nHow to get it back to the way it was before?\n\nA: The view mode of your downloads folder on the dock probably changed. Secondary-click (right-click / ctrl-click) the icon, then under the \"Display contents as\" section, click \"Fan\". Also, on top of the list, be sure that \"Date added\" is checked under \"Sort by\".\n", "Q: Internet sharing option \"to computers using iPhone USB\" Under System Preferences > Sharing, there is an option to share your connection from wherever \"to computers using: iPhone USB\":\n\nAt first glance, this looks to me like:\n               [Mac]               [iDevice]\n-->--(LAN)-->--˄   ˅-->--(USB)-->--˄\n\ni.e. reverse tethering over USB.\nHowever, according to these two answers, reverse tethering is not possible over USB with a vanilla iOS.\nThree other sources describe a way to do it on a jailbroken iOS, but although stated otherwise, this seems to work only with a Windows PC.\nAlso, I'm pretty sure that the above option is neither \"normal\" tethering, like\n                  [iDevice]               [Mac]\n-->--(Mobile)-->--˄       ˅-->--(USB)-->--˄\n\nwhich would be under \"Network\":\n\nnor sharing a connection from an iDevice to something else, like\n                  [iDevice]               [Mac]               [Whatever]\n-->--(Mobile)-->--˄       ˅-->--(USB)-->--˄   ˅-->--(USB)-->--˄\n\nwhich would be in the \"from\" field on internet sharing:\n\nSo, about the option shown in the first picture:\nEvidently it cannot be used to tether to vanilla iDevices, and there's no way Apple would put it there for jailbroken devices, on which it also doesn't seem to work.\nSo what does it actually do, and what can it be used for?\n\nA: I believe in Internet Sharing settings, OS X is just listing all of the network interfaces. iPhone USB is listed there for that reason, even though it's not a meaningful option. \n", "Q: How to open an opened file in Finder Is there a way to open an opened file in Finder? \nE.g. I have an open txt file, working with it and want to quickly open it in Finder. \nMaybe shortcut or any automator script.\n\nA: I say that depends on the program you open the file with, but in most programs you can right-click the file name in the top bar, click the containing folder, and a new Finder window will open with the file already selected:\n\n\nA: It's also worth noting that the little icon in the window title (as shown in @Siguza's picture) can be used for lots of things. Let's say you have a file open in TextEdit, and you want to open it in Word. You can use that little icon. Go to Word and choose File -> Open. Then go to the little icon at the top of the TextEdit window, grab it, and drag it to Word's File->Open dialog box. The File->Open dialog box will jump to that file. Then you just choose OK, and Word will open the file.\n", "Q: Fusion drive benefits for Boot Camp? I've got a late-2015 Retina iMac with Fusion drive. From what I understand, but want to confirm, is that there is no real benefit for Boot Camp as the partition is completely on the HDD side, so the speed in Boot Camp is considerably slower than if it had SSD access.\nHow can I confirm this or even see the two 'sides' of my Fusion Drive?\n\nA: Boot Camp Assistant partitions the HDD so that Windows can be installed. Windows does not support Core Storage, hence the partition is solely on the HDD.\n\nDo Macs that have a Fusion Drive support Boot Camp?\n  Yes. Boot Camp Assistant creates the Windows partition on the disk drive instead of the flash drive (SSD).\n\nSource: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201456\nSpeaking of Core Storage, this is what is used to make your two disks appear as one logical volume.

Background\nI'm on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) running 10.11.3 (15D21). I haven't changed any sound preferences. I bought the notebook brand new about 4 months ago. I only have a few apps installed (namely, Firefox, Affinity Designer, Sublime Text 3, and Transmit from Panic), so nothing specifically sound related, and all very common apps. I haven't changed any sound settings to cause this issue (at least not intentionally).\nBefore the issue\nThis is how the notebook has sounded up until today (watch @3:27): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQOcCISgMI&t=207\nAfter the issue\nToday, the volume indicator was suddenly muted (not just SHIFT +  one-time muted, but permanently muted). I went to sound preferences and checked the Play feedback when volume is changed box to re-enable it, but now my volume indicator sounds like this (same video @0:15): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQOcCISgMI&t=15.\nQuestion\nI'm not as concerned with switching back to the old sound (which is easy, via this and many other videos). My main question is why / how did this happen (the indicator change + muting)?\nExtra\nI did update to 10.11.3 on the 20th, and it's quite possible that I haven't changed my volume since then and simply did not notice that the 10.11.3 update included these changes (hopefully, this is the case), rather than it having just muted / changed today.

Is it possible to install third party hard disk to it?\nhttp://www.apple.com/in/macbook-pro/specs-retina/\n\nA: The 'why' part is easy to answer: Apple uses SSD (Solid State Drives) in their computers because they are many times faster than a hard disk drive, they are smaller and lighter, they use less power, and they do not have the same reliability issues associated with having a spinning drive in a computer than may get knocked or dropped.\nOne of the reasons why they want the drive to be physically smaller is because the rest of the laptop is pretty much full of battery.\nApple still sell one laptop that has an internal hard drive: the non-retina 13\" MacBook Pro. The base model of that machine has a spinning hard disk drive, although it can be upgraded to an SSD (and it would be strongly recommended, for performance reasons).\nYou can not fit a hard drive internally to any other MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, because there is not the space or a connector for it. If you need to use a hard drive with these laptops, you would need it to be an external drive, connected over USB, Thunderbolt or across a LAN.\n", "Q: Free app for tracking data usage per app I have a user that I want to monitor as he has a specific app which downloads a lot of updates. However the user will not pay for apps and its difficult to procure it over official channels.\nErgo i'm looking for a free app that can do this. I was surprised by how difficult it was to find one in the App Store, especially when this level of granularity is native on Android and can be tracked over custom time periods.\nI dont believe the Cellular Data setting\nDoes anyone have any recommendations?\n\nA: iOS sandboxing prevents apps from getting access to data usage of other apps. That's why iOS has the Data Usage section in Settings to show exactly that. \nThere might be solutions for jailbroken phones, but given your constraints a jailbreak doesn't seem to be an option.\nPS: If you don't trust the numbers in Data Usage, why would you trust those in a 3rd party app?\n", "Q: Will Apple Store employees activate my new iPhone? I bought a SIM FREE( Unlocked) iPhone 6s from the Apple Store in Glendale the other day. \nThe reason I used more money to get the SIM free one is because I'm here in L.A for a little vacation, but I live in another country. What I wanted was to use my new phone to take photos, use wifi, but it turns out I can't if I don't insert a valid SIM card. \nI tried everything: cutting the SIM card I had in my old phone (from another country), connecting the phone to iTunes, searching if other people ever had the same problem, but nothing!\nIf I go to the Apple Store and ask them to activate it any way they can, will they?

We have been locked out of our iMac running on El Capitan. Basically all known user accounts have disappeared. Only \"other\" remains which seems to the \"system administrator\" or \"root\" and when trying to login with this one, it hangs (endless turning white circle). Have been on forums and tried many of the First Aid (and second aid) tips and tricks, including fsck (where I found out initially \"MacHD had been modified\", and eventually got to \"MacHD seems to be working fine\").\nSomeone suggested the problem may be in Launch Services area and to access the Mac through FireWire and Target Disk Mode, but I don't have the possibility for such connection, plus without step-by-step I am not tech savvy enough to dare the programming challenge it seemed to require.\nAny help would be wonderful. I would bring it in, but as always when things fail, several important docs on the hard drive hadn't been backed up yet, so there we are.\n\nA: According to several sources: Apple discussions or Mac notebooks: Apple Hardware Test may report \"HDD\" alert the error: error 4HDD/11/40000000:SATA(0,0) may be erroneous or at least unclear/dubious.\nIt may be related to the vanishing of your users in the Login Screen or not.\n\nDepending on your findings in Single User Mode you have several options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing .AppleSetupDone to re-run Setup Assistant\nTo remove this file, you have to boot to single user mode by pressing ⌘S while booting.

Choose a user name not used previously. Search for any \"old\" (in /Users) or moved (elsewhere) previous user folders. In a second step you can change the permissions of the individual user folders and recover all data.\nThis might fail if your system is corrupted (bogus LaunchServices etc.)\n\n*If your system seems to be corrupted, reinstall it:\nReboot to Recovery Mode by pressing ⌘R while booting.\nOpen Disk Utility in the main panel and verify/repair your main volume and permissions. Quit Disk Utility.\nReinstall the system with Reinstall OS X. This shouldn't affect any user data or already installed apps.\n\n*If the previous step also fails I recommend to slightly resize the main volume, create a new 50 GB volume and install a fresh version of OS X to it. Since you have a Fusion Drive (CoreStorage LVG) you may either use the command line or Disk Utility to resize the main volume. Using Disk Utility choose the Fusion Drive and \"Partition\" and use the handler to slightly resize the main drive. Then choose the new item \"Untitled\" and the erase button and rename it to something else but stay with the default format (OS X Extended (Journaled)).\nAfter successfully installing OS X to the new small volume attach an external drive and save all precious data to it.

So I didn't lose any files, but lost a lot of work time. I was on the phone with an Apple tech who said I needed to update my apps (which was GarageBand, iMovie, and a small OS security update).\n\nA: The simplest fix is to either connect the Mac to another Mac with yours in Target Disk Mode to save the files you need or to make a new admin account.\nHow to set single / target disk:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stuck at Apple logo during boot.

I have a software company and my developers each have their own preferences for an OS (Mac, Linux based or Windows).\nFor windows I know you can use remote desktop and stuff. I know it is possible in Mac as well. But is it viable to let the employees that prefer Mac work from 1 thin server on a powerfull Mac Pro? If yes: How many should I expect to be able to work simultaneously? Does TightVNC as client give good results or is it tedious (slow / bad graphics)?\nI like to dream that everyone can use all the computers available on every workplace, because they work remote and don't have to use a specific computer each time to access their programs and files.\nYes I can create network shares, but sometime someone who doesn't prefere to work on Mac still has to develop on one because of XCode for example and we could buy Macs for these situations it's not ideal just for that instance. \n\nA: Can you use VNC (or ARD or some other remote desktop software) to remote into a server to do development work?\nShort answer is \"yes.\"\nHowever, it is a royal PITA. I use VNC to administer my OS X machines on my gigabit LAN and I can tell you that the lag is infuriating.  Trying to do development work, I can only imagine it being a nightmare.\nWhat worked for my developers was that we had several MBPs that would float around the department depending on the project.  For \"quick\" tasks VNC worked, but when they needed to be heads down on a project, they would check out a MBP and use it for the duration of their task.\nThe main thing to keep in mind is that people like what they like - Mac/Linux/Win.  The \"hotelling\" concept is a nice goal, but not feasible for devs who spend their lives in front of a monitor.  Ensuring work is accessible anywhere is the reason we have a cloud and GitHub.  These are areas you should investigate thoroughly before you spend time trying to re-architect your infrastructure.\n\nA: I am not a lawyer, and this should not be construed as professional legal advice. \nIs it legal? As long as you have a legitimate license to use OS X and you create separate accounts for each user who needs to access the system, then I believe the answer is yes.\nIs it workable? Based upon my own experience with remote desktop protocols and the anecdotal evidence of the other commenters here, no. Because of network load, network latency, and CPU load the experience will not be optimal for your users. It will, in all probability, reduce the ability of your developers to do their work, and harm your company's profits.\n\nA: If you want a scalable cross-platform solution for remote desktop, packages based on VNC are your only choice.\nMore consumer-oriented packages like Teamviewer or Chrome Remote Desktop are also available on multiple platforms, are easier to setup and have better security out of the box, but are most probably not a good choice in the longer run.\nIt doesn't have to end there though.  If the cross-platform/remote-compiling is the main thing you're after, perhaps you could have a look at Jenkins.  You can opt for a setup either at your company premises or - as many prefer - on a colocated machine in a datacenter.\nSome of the top guns at the Apple store (on iOS and OSX) are using this to automate and manage their projects across multiple developers in-house and abroad.\nYou can have multiple build machines on multiple platforms, it's quite expandable.  And it's FOSS.\nEven though technically it would work, having your developer, working on a windows machine, VNC'ing to an OSX machine to write his code on, is pure torture.  Even if the VNC server machine is placed right next to his', there will always be -a very small- delay.  This might not be noticeable when doing small hacks, but when typing loads and loads of text for longer periods, it does.\nIt will never be the same than writing on his native machine.  \n", "Q: Can't install Homebrew on OSX I am trying to install Homebrew on OSX El Capitan.

Maybe you tried to compile it yourself (the standard .configure && make && make install procedure installs programs into /usr/local for example.\nYou can force the command to use system curl by replacing curl by /usr/bin/curl in it, thus use:\nruby -e \"$(/usr/bin/curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\nWhen you have Homebrew successfully installed you can re-install the curl in your local folder by using:\nbrew install curl\n\nThere might be some additional steps as you have to overwrite files that are already there.

From what I've read, Time Machine seems to work amazingly well so I was hoping for a similar solution for Photos.\nI want to be able to delete the Photos library on my internal drive but keep the files \"alive\" on an external one. I use the \"new\" photos app introduced like half a year ago and migrated my library back then accordingly.\nIt would be perfect if I could do that with 2 separate external drives.\nIs there any software that gets this job done? Maybe even something from Apple? Most stuff I find wants you to backup to iCloud or doesn't really go with the user deleting the files off his internal drive.\nThanks in advance.\nEDIT: El Capitan, MacBook Air 2013, the external drives both are NTFS but I would also accept reformatting them if that was necessary. I use 3rd party drivers for NTFS access which work fine for me.\n\nA: You will need an external drive formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled) to use as a Time Machine backup. TM cannot use a NTFS formatted disk as the backup destination.\nUnfortunately, Time Machine cannot use an NTFS drive as a backup source, either. Time Machine relies on the Mac OS Extended (Journaled) file system on all drives acted on to do its work. (This isn't strictly true as you can create and backup to sparsebundle files on a network drive mounted with NTFS, but this is not in the scope of your question.)\nThus you need two Mac OS Extended (Journaled) external drives - one for the TM backup; one for the Photos Library. If you know how to use Time Machine, you can stop reading. If not, keep going.\nIn System Preferences > Time Machine, Click the Select Disk... button and choose this external disk for Time Machine backups. One the disk is selected, click the Options... button at the lower right, which brings up the window where you can exclude items from backups. Normally, all connected disks (internal & external) are backed up, except for the Time Machine disk. You can drag (or click the + sign) and add Macintosh HD (or whatever else you may have named the boot HD) to the list of excluded items. This will enable you to backup only the external HD with the Photos library.\n", "Q: How to check VT-x status on MacBook Pro I need to enable VT-x on my MacBook Pro, but I don't know whether it's enabled or not. Are there commands for checking the status of, enabling, or disabling VT-x?\nThose are my device specifications:\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\nOS: OS X El Capitan 10.11.2\nCPU: 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5 \nRAM: 8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3\n\nA: According to Intel® Core™ i5-5257U Processor, it supports Intel Virtualization Technology (VT-x).\nYou can also from Terminal use the following command:\nsysctl -a | grep machdep.cpu.features\n\nIf you see VMX in the output, then the CPU supports the Intel VT-x feature.\nIf you don't want to have to read through the output of CPU features and just see if VMX is there, then use: sysctl -a | grep -o VMX\nFrom Intel-based Macs: Using VT-x virtualization technology:\n\nIntel VT-x technology is enabled on Intel-based Macs. Make sure your Intel-based Mac has all available EFI updates installed; also update any third-party virtualization software.\n\nTherefore there is no reason to check the status.\nAs to enabling/disabling, there is no direct user interface for that.  Since it is enabled by default, the only way I can think of to disable it would be to hack the EFI Firmware. Which is not something I'd recommend doing!\n\nA: While the answer by @user3439894 indicates that the mac firmware should set VMX on during boot it doesn't in either my 2013 or 2014 MBP.  This means that Hyper-V (in bootcamp) does not work without a fix.  \nTo tell if vmx is actually enabled you need to check the 0x3a CPU register - see Activating the Intel VT Virtualization Feature.  This can only be done using RDMSR which requires kernel level permissions.  \nIf the EFI is not setting this correctly then the easiest way is to fix this is using rEFInd and set enable_and_lock_vmx in refind.conf to 1\n\nWhen set to true or a synonym, enable the CPU's VMX bit and lock the MSR. This configuration is necessary for some hypervisors (notably Microsoft's Hyper-V) to function properly. Activating it on other CPUs will, at best, have no effect, and could conceivably crash the computer, so enable it at your own risk! \nIf your firmware supports activating these features, you should use it instead; this option is provided for users whose firmware does not provide this functionality. (Many Macs lack this configurability, for instance.) The default is false.\n\nThis works like this (taken from rEFInd source but can be compiled separately).\n#include \"../include/tiano_includes.h\"\n\nstatic VOID DoEnableAndLockVMX(VOID)\n{\n    UINT32 msr = 0x3a;\n    UINT32 low_bits = 0, high_bits = 0;\n\n    // is VMX active ?\n    __asm__ volatile (\"rdmsr\" : \"=a\" (low_bits), \"=d\" (high_bits) : \"c\" (msr));\n\n    // enable and lock vmx if not locked\n    if ((low_bits & 1) == 0) {\n        high_bits = 0;\n        low_bits = 0x05;\n        msr = 0x3a;\n        __asm__ volatile (\"wrmsr\" : : \"c\" (msr), \"a\" (low_bits), \"d\" (high_bits));\n    }\n} // VOID DoEnableAndLockVMX()\n\nEFI_STATUS\nEFIAPI\nefi_main (\n  IN EFI_HANDLE        ImageHandle,\n  IN EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE  *SystemTable\n  )\n{\n  DoEnableAndLockVMX();\n\n  return EFI_SUCCESS;\n}\n\n", "Q: Back up different folders to different drives In Time Machine one can back up to several drives at the same time. It is also possible to control which folders are backed up and which are not. However, it seems to me that the same folders have to be backed up to all drives.\nIs it possible to exclude a folder from being backed up to one drive, while including it in the backup to another drive?\nI use OS X 10.10.1.\n\nA: I also believe Time Machine's GUI is not able to do that.\nBut if you feel like fiddling in CLI from terminal, and do some basic scripting, it can be done quite easily using the tmutil command:\n\n\n*\n\n*tmutil addexclusion and tmutil removeexclusion would allow to change your exclusion list by script whenever you want.\n\n*tmutil startbackup -destination would allow to trigger a backup by script to the desired destination, at the appropriate time (what about just after you changed your exclusion list? ;)  )\n\n*script scheduling could be done using launchctl (or with a basic crontab job)\n\n\nOf course, you should disable Time Machine in the Preference Pane, in order to prevent it from starting automatically while your scripted backup may be already running.\nBottom line, have a look at man tmutil. Backups would still be plain standard TimeMachine backups, just triggered differently. Restore could be done in GUI as usual.\nOf course, if you have no previous experience in terminal mode or scripting, this gonna be a little harder. But if you feel like learning something geeky, this is the time to try (and then ask for help if needed!).  ;-)\n\nA: I believe this is beyond the intent and capability of Time Machine which is to provide simple backup for most users.

I'm fine with jailbreak tweaks as my iPhone 5 is jailbroken. I very highly doubt it's actually anything to do with the cable because I've been using it for a year now and no problems whatsoever, it's obviously just Apple's way of tricking users to buy their completely overpriced accessories by throwing in this annoyance.\n\nA: So iPhone 5s use a Lightning cable rather than the old school dock connector. \nLightning cables actually have an authentication chip in them, hence the message.\nThere's a jailbreak tweak out there that may be worth checking out, but it's quite old and may not have been updated.\nYour best bet would be to just get a new cable.

They are on an external USB3 and, of course, spotlight-indexed.  When I look by text search (not name search) for files with a particular content it takes quiet a lot of time, first accelerating the disk, then running it with a lot of noise and obviously spinning the disk like crazy. I wonder if another disk might make a difference and want to ask you about Thunderbolt or even Thunderbolt-on-SSD. \nHow can I benchmark my Mac so I can make an informed purchase decision on buying a faster drive?\n\nA: Part of it might be a setting in your energy saver settings that allows hard drives to sleep if not in use, you could check on that setting and see if adjusting it makes the job easier and searches quicker.\nA USB 3 drive (assuming it is on a USB 3 port) should be plenty fast enough to handle the necessary bandwidth. What might be slowing you down is the speed of the drive. If you have a 5400RPM drive that would slow things down and moving to a 7200 might make it fast enough for you. But fast enough is hard to quantify.\nThunderbolt on SSD would be as fast as an internal SSD, but these drives are pricey and when I was looking for one recently found none that were suitable. Many being multiple drive RAID chassis. Instead I went with a Firewire 800 drive case (from OWC) and a Samsung 1TB SSD.\nAs my Mac did not have USB 3, Firewire 800 was fast enough for my needs.

I use Option-Enter A LOT. My main uses are to put a new line into a message in Messages, and to open a url in a new tab in Google Chrome, I know I can hit Command-T, but I often want to modify the url slightly and open in a new tab in one fell swoop.\nThis used to work fine all the time, now it will work for a while and then stop until the next reboot. I have looked at System Preferences->Keyboard->Shortcuts and there's nothing defined for Option-Enter.\nIf there is a likely culprit, please let me know. Otherwise, if you could explain how to determine which App or process is affecting this.\nRunning El Capitan 10.11.3\n\nA: The problem was an extra keyboard that I had enabled: Unicode Hex Input. I had definitely forgotten about it. I would do something (not sure what, don't really care) to switch to this keyboard and when this keyboard is active the Option-Enter does not work.\nI removed this keyboard from my list of Input Sources: System Preferences -> Keyboard, Input Sources Tab. Problem solved, no longer able to switch to this.\nBelow is a screenshot of my Keyboard Preference Pane on the Input Sources Tab.\n\nNote: The oval is where the Unicode source was. When there are multiple sources the minus button (bottom left arrow) is active to remove the currently selected source. Also I have Show Input menu in menu bar checked - there will be no menu bar item if you have only one source.\n", "Q: Create a pdf with just certain pages from a pdf I have a pdf, and I would like to select some pages from that pdf and build another pdf. Is it possible? If yes, how? I am on a El Captain.\n\nA: What you might want to try is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Duplicate the PDF you want to remove the pages from in the Finder\n\n*Open the duplicate file, show the sidebar\n\n*Select the page(s) you no longer want and press the backspace key\n\n*Once you have deleted the pages you no longer want, save the duplicated file.\n\n*If you like you can then open another PDF and drag the thumbnails from one sidebar to the sidebar of the other document, thereby adding pages from one PDF to another.\n\n\nHope that helps.\n\nA: There's a command-line option as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install MacPorts (hosted by Apple) from https://www.macports.org/install.php . The link for your version of OS X, at the time of this writing, is https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.3.4-10.11-ElCapitan.pkg\n\n*Once it's installed, run the following command:\nsudo port selfupdate && sudo port install qpdf\n\nEnter your password (it will not be displayed as you type) and push return.\n\n*Now, you'll be able to use the command qpdf. To do what you're trying to do, try this:\nqpdf --empty --pages ch01.pdf 1,5,9-15 ch02.pdf 1,5,7-20 -- output.pdf\n\nYou can specify as many input PDFs as you want (in this case I'm using ch01.pdf, and ch02.pdf), the way I did here. Separate individual pages using commas, and page ranges using a dash, as I'm doing here. You can change \"output.pdf\" to whatever output file name you want.\n", "Q: Itunes no longer in my order I admit I am anal about organization, and have developed a nomenclature for all my play lists. Now they apparently sort based on the recent usage, not how I want to show.  \nIs there any way to go back to the way I like - in other words, in my case, alphabetical and then by the play list number. For example - Aqua 1, Aqua 2, etc.  My play lists are currently all over the place.\n\nA: The question isn't about track order.  It is specifically referring to playlist order in the left column of playlist view.\nYes, this is a bug with the current iTunes (12.3.2).  When clicking on a playlist it tends to jump to the bottom of the folder list rather than staying alphabetically organized.  Hopefully this will get fixed with the next update.  But I am running El Capitan Beta 10.11.4 and it has not been fixed yet.  I've submitted multiple bug reports.\nQuitting and restarting iTunes temporarily fixes the issue.\n\nA: Open the iTunes list of items, then click on the name column. This will sort tracks by alphabetical/ reverse alphabetical order.\n", "Q: Script opens two terminal windows I coded this little AppleScript using Automator:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\ndo script \"myscript\"\nend tell\n\nThis perfectly works but has a side effect: when I close the window, there's always the Terminal window to close, so there are two windows, the one that executes the script and the Terminal.\nIs there any way to have just one window running?\n\nA: Try:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    if not (exists window 1) then reopen\n    activate\n    do script \"echo hi\" in window 1\nend tell\n\n\nA: Looks like when Terminal is not open, then tell application Terminal opens the Terminal with first window and do script opens another window (because do script is supposed to open new window).\nPartial solution is to do script ... in window 1, which forces to run the script in recently opened window, but when Terminal was in use before, this would hijack existing window (and possibly unsuitable context).\nFollowing script did the trick for me:\nif application \"Terminal\" is running then \n    tell application \"Terminal\"   \n        # do script without \"in window\" will open a new window        \n        do script \"echo HELLO\"             \n        activate                          \n    end tell                              \nelse                                      \n    tell application \"Terminal\"   \n        # window 1 is guaranteed to be recently opened window        \n        do script \"echo HELLO\" in window 1 \n        activate\n    end tell\nend if \n\n(I got inspiration from adayzdone's proposal, but it didn't work for me (in El Capitan). Looks like after tell application \"Terminal\" the condition not (exists window 1) never holds.)\n\nA: I know this is 5 years late but I found the answer.\nHere is my simplified answer for you. Change \"\" to my script variable. We must first launch the terminal to prevent a duplicate window bug cause by activate creating a new window after do script already created a new window. We cannot assume we can run in window 1 after activate as that window could be closing or running from another process. The best solution is the one I wrote and has 0 bugs:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    if not application \"Terminal\" is running then launch\n    do script \"\"\n    activate\nend tell\n\nHere is the full script I used for my Java library open terminal\non run argv\n    set scpt to first item in argv\n    set p to second item in argv\n    tell application \"Terminal\"\n        if not application \"Terminal\" is running then launch\n        set newTab to do script scpt\n        try\n            if p is not equal to \"\" then set current settings of newTab to settings set p\n        end try\n        activate\n    end tell\nend run\n\n", "Q: Why xterm would run only once on XQuartz? I have XQuartz running and I can open xterm if I have started XQuartz just for the first time after rebooting the machine.  However, as time passes, I cannot create new xterms.  So much so that if I quit current XQuartz and restart just XQuartz, I cannot get any xterm.  It is annoying that I have to reboot the machine just to be able to use xterm.\nI am running OS X 10.11 El Capitan.  I'll appreciate any insight.\nHere is the information from pkgutil.\n$ pkgutil --file-info /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app\nvolume: /\npath: /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app\n\npkgid: org.macosforge.xquartz.pkg\npkg-version: 2.7.86\ninstall-time: 1445273913\nuid: 0\ngid: 0\nmode: 755\n\n\nA: I've had a similar experience when the computer switched or joined networks. Apparently the hostname is used as part of the authentication process to determine if a client is allowed new windows, and locks that in at start time. If you get a new hostname via DHCP, these credentials become invalid. There were some settings I could do to fix it, but I don't remember them (it was not to disable X11 security completely ;-). Try to manually start an xterm from the shell prompt in the existing xterm and throw the error message into Google - that's what helped me to solve it.\n\nA: Using Keyboard\nAfter selecting/clicking on Xquartz, you can press command + n to create how many new xterm windows you need.\nUsing Terminal App\nopen a terminal app and enter the below command\n/usr/X11/bin/xterm\nhopes this helps.\n", "Q: Checking if a driver is loaded for a device I'm trying to get a Hauppauge Nova-T USB dongle working under OS X El Capitan. I found an unofficial driver installer and a program to watch television using this dongle, but the program is not detecting it.\nIn Windows, I know I can go to Device Manager to check if a driver has been loaded for a certain device. How can I verify if a driver was loaded? I've already verified that the dongle was detected using ioreg -p IOUSB:\n+-o Nova-T Stick@14100000  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x10001c71e, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (12 ms), retain 11>\n\n\nA: List all loaded drivers:\nsudo kextstat\n\nYou may also use it with grep like sudo kextstat |grep defyne \n", "Q: My battery icon has x in it My MacBook Pro 15\" battery has a black X in the battery icon and the indicator lights on the side do not light up when button is pressed. What could be the problem? It runs fine when plugged in\n\nA: Most likely the battery has died or is no longer being recognized by the system. To verify it is not the latter Apple has a KB article that will help with resetting the SMC. \nIf it is the former it's time to replace the battery. If you are under warranty take it to a nearby Apple store. If not they can still do the repair but it will cost you. Depending on the model you have replacing the battery can be trivially easy (open the latches on the bottom and pop out the battery) to \"just give up and cry yourself to sleep.\"\nMore info on your make and model would help us determine where your hardware falls in that spectrum and how many cycles you might expect on your battery before it disconnects itself like you have noticed.\n\nA: This means your MacBook does not recognise the battery. Maybe it's not installed properly?\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/PH18598?locale=en_US\n", "Q: Boot Camp issue My Windows system is a folder in the Startup Disk PrefPane, but shows an hard drive icon on my desktop. How do I turn it into a hard drive icon in the start up disk? I've tried everything but haven't been able to change it.\n\nA: There is an application that comes with your Mac (in /Applications/Utilities) called Boot Camp Assistant. Launch that and follow the instructions provided on screen.\nI am guessing that you have a disk image file of the Windows installer on your computer. If you double-click on it it will open up into a virtual hard drive. If that is the case Boot Camp Assistant will use the Windows installer file you have and ask you for a USB thumb drive (8GB minimum size) that it can format (erase completely) and set up to act as your Windows installer.\nIt will then reboot your Mac and prompt you to rearrange your hard drive's formatting to make room for Windows. Assuming you have enough room on your hard drive this is completely non-destructive and leaves your Mac HD a little smaller but otherwise untouched. Then it will install Windows on your Mac. Assuming you have the right version of Windows for the version of Mac and Mac O/S that you have. More info on all of that would get your questions answered better.\n", "Q: connecting a LAN printer while using the 3G network I have set up a point of sale station using a 3G iPad. I have a LAN printer that connects to a WiFI router that doesn't have an Internet connection. I want to use the 3G to connect to the Internet while being connected to the router's WiFi network for printing. It seems on the iPad the WiFi connection prioritises  over the 3G dropping my Internet connection. Is there a way I can make this work for me?\n\nA: No, this cannot be done. \nThe WiFi and the 3G connections can't be brought up at the same time on an iPad. \nYou could turn on WiFi when you need to print and get back to 3G after that, or use a service such as Google Cloud Print to print documents from the Internet. \nThe Google Cloud Print solution requires a computer connected to the Internet and to the printer.\n", "Q: Safari still caching even with \"Disable Caches\" enabled I'm debugging JavaScript on my iPhone and I can't get Safari to stop caching the JavaScript files.  I have \"Disable Caches\" enabled under the develop menu, and have cleared the cache numerous times but as you can see in this screenshot some script files are still cached:\n\nThe only way I've found to fully clear the cache is to wipe all content from Safari though my phones settings.\nAs well, all requests returned by the server prohibit caching through response headers:\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate\nPragma: no-cache\nExpires: 0\n\n\nA: Disable Caches is for Safari on OS X, not for Safari on your connected iOS device.\nYou can't disable caches on Safari on iOS.\n", "Q: Storing data on a external drive used for backup Is it safe to store data on HDD which I selected to use as a backup device in time machine? Or should I add another partition for that?\nI do not know how does time machine behave when there is not enough space. Is it going to delete whatever it sees or just content from Backups.backupd folder.\n\nA: Time Machine will only have access to its own backups.  So, anything besides Backups.backupdb will not be touched.\nKeep in mind though that Time Machine is set to use up the entire drive eventually.  Having it shared with outside data may have adverse effects for either storing more of your data outside Backups.backupdb or for Time Machine (depending on which part fills up the remaining space first).\nWhile it is safe to use a Time Machine-marked drive with other data, it is recommended to leave Time Machine alone on a separate partition and use a different partition for your \"outsourced\" data.\n", "Q: \"Temporary\" folder I often download images, take screenhots, and save files that I am only going to use for a little until it can be discarded. \nI want to create a folder which deletes the contents inside it every few days ad midnight to conserve space on my mac. \nMy original idea was to create a cron job to empty the folder at a specific time, but a problem exists.\nMy computer is a MacBook, and will not be powered on during the times that I want the files to disappear, this means I  need these files to delete when I power the device back on (or wake from sleep) given the time has expired. \nAny solution?\n\nA: The solution is simple. Instead of creating a cron job, create a launchd plist (property list). Go to http://launched.zerowidth.com for help configuring common options and installing the plist. More options not included in the website can be found in the man page \"launchd.plist\" (by typing man launchd.plist), but you should be good to go with what's provided. The advantage is that launchd will run the plist when the computer turns on, if the computer was turned off at the time it was supposed to run. It'll even coalesce multiple events into a single event, if the script would have normally ran a few times while the computer was off.\n\nA: Yes, if you want to create a cron job to empty the folder, it is a little intricate. I would also recommend creating a launched plist. It's efficient.\n", "Q: Recurring kernel panic when waking from sleep — can anyone tell me what this report means?

Why? \nYou can see in the attached screenshot that I have used the SUM function to add the values in column E. There are several \"1\" values (you can see one in cell E126) but the SUM always comes out at \"0\". Why is this? \nTo create this spreadsheet, I duplicated a Numbers spreadsheet in which I used \"x\" to denote a positive value (presence of different types of bees), then I used Find and Replace to change each \"x\" to \"1\" in this spreadsheet so I could use Numbers to compute a sum for each column. Would this find-and-replace maneuver make the values unable to be counted by the SUM function? How can I get Numbers to return a correct SUM for each column?\n\nA: If the cells are in text format, they won't be counted. Check they are a number format cell first.\nEDIT\nI have tried it myself, when you find and replace, the cell is not automatically updated to a number cell. If you manually type in the number 1, it automatically gets changed to a number format.\n\nA: Another way of doing this without having to convert the text to number:\nUse the COUNTIF() function.\nThis way, you don’t even have to convert your \"x\" to a 1 either:\n=COUNTIF(E3:E130, \"x\")\nThis counts all the \"x\"'s in the column. Same as summing up a bunch of 1's.\nThe SUM() function is not preferred for your situation. Suppose one of the numbers becomes 2 or 11 by mistake. As you really are looking for a COUNT of how many are '1' the count functions COUNT, COUNTIF, COUNTIFS are much better tools for this particular job.\n\n", "Q: Cannot access Boot Camp partition after OS X reinstall I've already used Boot Camp to install Windows on my computer. A while back I had to erase my hard drive and reinstall Mavericks. Once I did that my Windows portion still exist as a volume, but when I got to my Start Up Disk settings it's a folder and not a disk. \nI have a lot of my music I created with sound effects and sound kits in FL Studios on that side I don't want to lose. \nDo I have to erase and reinstall Windows using Boot Camp or can I fix that issue by creating another bootable disk for my Windows? \n\nA: Neither of the suggested proposals is advisable. If you erase and reinstall Windows all the music will be lost. Creating a second bootable disk is a complex and error-prone task.\nIf the Windows volume really still exists you can access it in read-only mode and save your music to the OS X volume by default. If you also need write access install an appropriate tool like NTFS for Mac 14 or a free tool like NTFS-3G for Mac OS X.\nYou may also salvage the bootability of the Windows partition by adding appropriate MBR entries.

I just bought the 2560 x 1440 px @ 25 inch (117.5 dpi) Dell U2515H monitor and must say that I'm pretty pleased with the design and quality of the display. Excellent bang for the buck, very thin, frameless bezel, clean backside.\nUsing the included MiniDisplayPort-to-DisplayPort cable, it allows me to run at native 2560 x 1440 px @ 60 Hz from my MacBook Pro Retina 13\" (Late 2013) and an even older MBPR 13\" (2011). Both Macs are running the latest version of El Capitan.\nI can enable the HiDPI modes using SwitchResX or the Terminal command, but in 1280 x 720 px (HiDPI), the UI becomes too big and one loses too much desktop property.\nQuestion: Is there any way to enable the scaling options („Larger Text“ / „More Space“ and the sizes inbetween) under System Preferences > Displays, as found on the Retina MacBook displays and 4K/5K monitors?\n\n\nA: I had a same use case, with my old Mac Book Pro 2012.\nYou need to instruct MacOS to allow using HiDPI resolution on non-HiDPI displays. More here\nBasically you need to execute this command and reboot:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool true\n\n\nA: Option+click Scaled\nYou can toggle between Apple’s easy-to-understand “Larger Text”–“More Space” icons mode and the other mode listing specific resolutions.

That app has other benefits, but certainly is not necessary to get Retina/HiDPI as you get that be default from Apple.\nNote the checkbox Show low resolution modes in the second screen shot above. Checking that box and choosing a resolution listed with the notation (low resolution) means you are disabling the Retina feature and scaling up the image crudely (wasting pixels). \n", "Q: How can I iterate through a folder and move/copy every Nth item I want to make a time lapse from a folder of images, but there are too many and the time lapse progresses to slowly.  How do I select, for example, every 10th item, and either copy or move the items into a separate folder?\n\nA: The quickest way is to use bash and awk syntax in your Terminal.app\nfor file in `find /SOURCE/DIR -type f | awk 'NR %10 == 0'`; do echo mv $file /DEST/DIR ; done\n\n\nfor statement introduces the bash loop, to iterate through a set of data where file is the variable. \nfind parses the /SOURCE/DIR for that which is specified.\n| acts as a pipe, passing stout from find back to stdin\nawk interprets stdin and prints only lines meeting the conditions specified by 'NR %10 == 0’\n\n\n*\n\n*NR is an awk built-in variable that specifies the record/line number to be evaluated. \n\n*% is a numerical operator telling awk that the following character(s) must be treated as such.\n\n*== is relational operator for must be equal to..\n\n*0 is the binary expression for TRUE \nSo, that’s all fancy for  \"find every 10th file that exists in this directory and output it; \n\n\n*\n\n*do introduces the action to perform on the output.\n\n*echo is used to double check the command, the results of which will be printed to stout. If all looks well, remove it and perform the action (mv, cp)\n\n*mv is a built in bash command to take one file and move(or rename it).\n\n*cp is another built in bash command to mv one file from one dir. to another while preserving the original. You can directly substitute cp for mv if you wish to preserve the contents of the original directory.\n\n*$file references the file variable that has now been defined. \n\n\nSo, that’s all fancy for tell me what happens when I…(echo) “move (or, copy) all the files specified by the previous parameters to this other directory;”\n\n\n*\n\n*done\nThat’s all fancy for telling bash to terminate the loop since you’re done :)\n", "Q: Upload iCloud photos with OS X 10.7 My only Mac is so old that it only runs a maximum of OS X 10.7 which does not support iCloud Photo Library. \nI want to upload a few thousand photos from my hard drive to iCloud Photo Library one time and that's all. \nIs there a way to do this with my old Mac?\n\nA: You should be able to do this at icloud.com. After you sign in, click photos, then upload at the top. You should then be able to select the photos you want to upload and click choose. Note all the photos must be individually selected: you may not select a folder.\nYou may alternatively drag them to the photos interface on icloud.com.\nObviously, it will take awhile for a few thousand to upload.\n", "Q: Can't seem to redirect input in Terminal I'm having issues getting redirection to work in Terminal.

Any idea on how to interrupt it?\n\nA: The actual display of a process between (…) means this process was detached from its controlling terminal (here ttys002). This means that ^C, ^\\, ^S, ^Z don't have anymore effect on it. It's behaving in daemon mode. This also means you can't send it a hangup either.\nThe correct way to deal with this case if unwanted, is to get\nthe number of its parent process with:\nps lw | egrep '[ ](2006|PID)'\n\nand kill it with a hangup signal:\nkill -HUP xxxx\n\nwhere xxxx is the process ID of the parent process.\n\nA: This is a zombie process. Here's how to get rid of it from this answer on superuser:\n\n\nSadly, it appears that killing of zombies is all about killing the parent, and if the parent is /sbin/launchd, you can kill it only with rebooting.\n\nIt would be a Very Bad Idea to kill launchd, but you can tell it to HUP.\nTry sudo kill -s HUP 1\nThat will cause launchd to reinitialize without restarting.

I have to manually switch it over every time.\nIs there a way to reorder the profiles so Wired is the default? Or remove the wireless profile from the wired list? There seems to be no way to do this via the GUI interface.\nOS: 10.10.5 Yosemite\n\n\nA: Found a solution by removing the WiFi profile from the Wired config file. \nLocation: /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/\nFor me the file was: com.apple.network.eapolclient.configuration\nBasically it's an XML file that has, for me, the two profiles for the wired connection (this would also work if you're trying to edit the wifi, as that's in the com.apple.airport.preferences.plist). The name of the profile is at the bottom of the data set, so Wifi was the 2nd one for me. I used <!-- Put your code inside these --> to comment the lower part out and the list now only contains the Wired profile. \nThe section looks like this when you're done:\n<!-- <key>NUMBERS-LETTERS-ETC-ETC</key> \n    <dict>\n        <key>AuthenticationProperties</key>\n        <dict> ... lots of stuff ...\n              <string>Wi-Fi (eduroam)</string>\n               ... more stuff ...\n              <key>SecurityType</key>\n              <string>WPA</string>\n        </dict>\n    </dict> -->\n\nSave the file and close any System Preferences windows you have open.\nNow this is what is in your new System Preferences > Network, no choices but the one that you want.

Does the openssl version in Server.app cause it? I installed the openssl/1.1.0-pre2, but I don't know how to make it work with Server.app (openssl/1.1.0 is already working on my Mac).\n\nA: This looks like a mismatch between the version of Server, where the apache config resides, and the version of apache which is delivered by the OS. \nLook at the .conf files in /Library/Server/Web/Config/Proxy/ and replace any instances of TLSv1.2 with TLSv1.\nYou may also need to do that with some of the other config files included by those files.\nThat said, since both pieces look to be prerelease, you should review your seeding agreement, it may have info on a better place to ask this sort of question.\n", "Q: Reset icon cache on MacBook I've been trying to find out how to reset the icon cache on my MacBook, and two methods seem to always be suggested.

I tried method 2 on my Macbook Air (El Capitan 10.11.6), causing it unable to boot. Had to recover from Timemachine backup.\n\nA: They both remove the icon cache and it's content with the first and second command. The difference in the third command is that in Method 1 the com.apple.iconservices.store is just renamed (so it can be recovered if things go wrong), in Method 2 it is directly removed.

Other spaces did not cause the same thing to happen.\nBy closing the offending Space, the problem went away.\n\nA: As EDP pointed out Command+Option+D does this. The Spectacle app has shortcuts near this (+F for example) and I'll tap 'D' accidentally from time to time. Even if you're not tapping the shortcut inadvertently, Command+Option+D is a great way to switch the setting back when it's goes wrong.\nIf you want to prevent it, you can go to [Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts], and disable the shortcut under Launchpad > Turn Dock Hiding On/Off.\nCool trick: open [Settings > Dock], and tap [Command+Option+D] a couple times.\n", "Q: If \"STOP\" Is typed do this Would it be possible For example would it be possible for me to code a very simple repeat code but say If I just typed STOP that it would end the program here is my beginning code for the repeat.\nset x to 1\n\nrepeat while x is 1\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n       activate\n       make new Finder window\n    end tell\nend repeat\n\nand so for example if STOP is entered set x to 2 or something?\nThank you\n\nA: No - Applescript is not multi-threaded in the sense that you can set up two things to happen at one time.\nTo do what you want, you'd need another language that could open a window so the user could type characters to be interpreted and change the signal variable to exit the loop. That language would handle multiple threads and communication between the two processes so that the setting of the new X value would be visible to the other thread running the loop.\nIf you'd rather stick to AppleScript, you could probably do what you want by using the existence of a file to keep the loop running:\nif file \"semaphore\" of application \"Finder\" exists then\n   -- continue processing...\nend if\n\nThis is documented at https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptLangGuide/conceptual/ASLR_fundamentals.html\nSearch for the section titled Direct Parameter or use the semaphore string to locate the snippet I copied above. Then you could have the user delete the \"chosen\" file - maybe putting it on their desktop and call it \"keepRunning\" or something so they trash it when the script should stop running.\n", "Q: Archive utility hangs at 5 seconds remaining I'm using OSX El Capitan (v10.11.2).\nThe compression task was begun about 24 hours ago and had reached the About 5 seconds estimation after a couple hours. But it does not complete for whatever reason. What are the possible reasons for this issue?\n\n\nA: Anything interesting in the console app (system.log or other activity)? Any chance you accessed any of these files from another app? Mail.app is notorious for never \"closing\" attachment files, so you might need to close the apps that might have the files open. It's hard to know what's causing it without attaching a debugger to the process and seeing where in the code is working or waiting.\nIf there isn't a lot of other activity - (i.e. quit every app you can - maybe all of them if possible) and then use fs_usage to see what file activity is ongoing from the command line/terminal.app:\nsudo fs_usage -w\n\nThe other avenue is a split half search. Kill the hung process and compress half the folder at a time, narrowing down to a specific file that's causing compression issues. It might just be bad luck and the next time you try to compress all will be well.\n", "Q: Is there an option to inspect live variable data like in Visual studio?

I'm really far from terminology of this subject, I have no idea what is flash memory and don't know if all MacBook SSDs must have a flash memory supported SSD drive. I see that there are some suitable SSD upgrades for my MBA on OWC. But I want to buy an SSD from a local technology market. So exactly which specs should I look for to understand which SSDs suitable with my MacBook Air.\nHow can I be sure, if I buy SSD it will work with my MBA?\n\nA: Your MacBook Air (13\" I presume) does not use a standard SSD drive in the 2.5\" form factor that many others do. Instead it uses an SSD with a bare SATA connector on the end. It looks a bit like a standard memory DIMM.\nI generally buy upgrade parts for my Macs via Other World Computing. there are others that are just as good, if you prefer, but this SSD upgrade would work for your system.\nI would review the installation instructions to make sure it is something you feel comfortable doing.\n\nA: You can upgrade the storage in your MacBook Air–but it's more difficult than your average notebook.\nYour MacBook Air's SSD uses SATA with a proprietary 7+17 connector. While in theory it would be possible to adapt a standard M.2 SATA SSD to work with the MacBook Air, because of the tight space constraints, you'll need to buy special compatible storage from a company like OWC. Following this guide from iFixit you can then replace it. You'll need to store you data in some way you can reload it onto the new flash drive once your done–I personally would create a bootable volume then use Migration Assistant if you have that option.\nAlternatively, if you don't want to bother with that, you can buy SD cards that fit into the form of the SD slot–it'll be slower and probably cost a little more, but it means you don't have to bother with the hassle of the above and get to keep whatever included storage comes with your machine.\n", "Q: How to change [option + key] international shortcut in OS X If in OSX text input field pressing Option+[  will render “, Option+' will render æ andOption+; will render …. \nCan I remap these to render å, ä and ö instead?\n\nA: Stumbled upon this post when trying to achieve the same mapping with Karabiner-Elements. \nThe old \"Karabiner\" does not work with Sierra and above and have been replaced with Karabiner-Elements. \nI managed to achieve the behaviour desired by original poster in Karabinier-Elements by adding the configuration below to karabinier.conf so I posted this as reference for others that stumble in here for same reason. \nIt is based on the \"standard\" way to enter umlaut characters with a US keyboard, e.g.\noption+u, a => ä\noption+u, o => ö\nand\noption+a => å\n(in section \"complex_modification\" -> \"rules\")\n\"rules\": [\n       {\"description\": \"left_option ['; to åäö\",\n        \"manipulators\": [\n            {\"type\": \"basic\",\n            \"from\": {\n                \"key_code\": \"open_bracket\",\n                \"modifiers\": { \"mandatory\": [ \"left_option\" ] }\n            },\n            \"to\": [\n                {\"key_code\": \"a\",\n                 \"modifiers\" : [ \"left_option\" ]\n                }]\n            },\n            {\n            \"type\": \"basic\",\n            \"from\": {\n                \"key_code\": \"open_bracket\",\n                \"modifiers\": {\n                \"mandatory\": [\n                    \"left_option\",\n                    \"left_shift\"\n                ]\n                }\n            },\n            \"to\": [\n                {\"key_code\": \"a\",\n                 \"modifiers\" : [\n                 \"left_option\",\n                 \"left_shift\"\n                 ]\n\n                }\n            ]\n            },\n\n            {\n            \"type\": \"basic\",\n            \"from\": {\n                \"key_code\": \"quote\",\n                \"modifiers\": {\n                \"mandatory\": [\n                    \"left_option\"\n                ]\n                }\n            },\n            \"to\": [\n                {\"key_code\": \"u\",\n                 \"modifiers\" : [\n                 \"left_option\"\n                 ]\n                },\n                {\"key_code\": \"a\"}\n            ]\n            },\n            {\n            \"type\": \"basic\",\n            \"from\": {\n                \"key_code\": \"quote\",\n                \"modifiers\": {\n                \"mandatory\": [\n                    \"left_option\",\n                    \"left_shift\"\n                ]\n                }\n            },\n            \"to\": [\n                {\"key_code\": \"u\",\n                 \"modifiers\" : [\n                 \"left_option\"\n                 ]\n                },\n                {\"key_code\": \"a\",\n                 \"modifiers\" : [ \"left_shift\" ]}\n            ]\n            },\n\n            {\n            \"type\": \"basic\",\n            \"from\": {\n                \"key_code\": \"semicolon\",\n                \"modifiers\": {\n                \"mandatory\": [\n                    \"left_option\"\n                ]\n                }\n            },\n            \"to\": [\n                {\"key_code\": \"u\",\n                 \"modifiers\" : [\n                 \"left_option\"\n                 ]\n                },\n                {\"key_code\": \"o\"}\n            ]\n            },\n\n            {\n            \"type\": \"basic\",\n            \"from\": {\n                \"key_code\": \"semicolon\",\n                \"modifiers\": {\n                \"mandatory\": [\n                    \"left_option\",\n                    \"left_shift\"\n                ]\n                }\n            },\n            \"to\": [\n                {\"key_code\": \"u\",\n                 \"modifiers\" : [\n                 \"left_option\"\n                 ]\n                },\n                {\"key_code\": \"o\",\n                 \"modifiers\" : [ \"left_shift\" ]}\n            ]\n            }\n        ]\n        }] // end \"rules\"\n\n\nA: To make this work you have to use a third party tool: Karabiner.\nI have a slightly different proposal for the å though:\nIn the example below holding the right option key enables the German keyboard layout.

After this was done, I tried to install Windows, but I ran into the problem of Windows not accepting the pre-made partition, so I deleted it and rebooted once again into the Windows installer to install it. \nEverything went fine, but in the last bit of the installation process, it aborted - telling me that it couldn't change my boot configuration.\nAfter this, it froze, so I held the power button down until it restarted. I couldn't boot from the newly created (hard drive) \"EFI boot\" section, so I booted the Recovery and tried to delete the two new partitions (the windows and the \"Microsoft reserved\" one). But it wouldn't let me delete the ~130MB partition named disk0s4. Even from Internet recovery, I couldn't get rid of it. \nNext thing I did was try to run the Windows installer again, but from this point on, the installer would crash in a BSOD, almost instantly restarting my PC shortly after. I thought it had to be the disk0s4-partition that is causing all of this, so I made another effort deleting it - and I made it using the disk utility on my OS X. Having only one partition left, I tried rebooting, only to see that the \"EFI boot\" was still there.

What is left are files in your EFI partition. The ghost is being caused by the file efi/boot/bootx64.efi stored in the EFI partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal window and enter the following command.\nsudo diskutil mount /dev/disk0s1\n\n\n*From a Finder window, open the EFI disk. Next open the EFI folder.\nRemove the Boot and Microsoft folders.\n\n*When finished, enter the command below.\ndiskutil unmount /dev/disk0s1\n\nChoosing an Installation Method\nGenerally the \"modified Info.plist-trick\" is just that. It is a trick. As far as I know, you can put the Windows installation files on the USB flash drive, but can not boot from this drive to install Windows. Generally, only the 2012 and newer models can boot the Windows installer from a USB port. If you succeeded, then your model must be the exception.\nIf you have an internal working optical drive, then this the preferred method to install Windows. If you need to buy a DVD, you are better off with a RW DVD. It will take longer to burn, but it is reusable. It is not sufficient to just burn the iso file to a DVD. You must burn the image stored in the iso file to the DVD.\nThere are two methods for installing operation systems on Macs. The first is the legacy BIOS/MBR method and the second is the EFI/GPT method. It is my understanding that the 2011 models are suppose to install Windows using the legacy BIOS/MBR method. From your post, I assume you were trying the EFI/GPT method.\nYou can choose which partition or media to boot from by holding down the alt/option key at startup. If a Windows installation DVD is in the Macs optical drive, you will get a DVD icon labeled \"Windows\". You can select this to install Windows using the BIOS/MBR method. There also may be a DVD icon labeled something like \"EFI\". You probably do not want to select this icon, since this will install using the EFI/GPT method.\nA word of caution. If you using the BIOS/MBR method for Windows, you can not use any Windows software to change the disk partitioning. This must only be done from OS X. However, you can use Windows to format a partition.\n", "Q: Screen sharing in OSX El Capitan I have a 2012 Macbook Pro and a 2013 Mac Mini, both running El Capitan with all latest updates.  The Mac Mini is \"headless\" as I use it as a media server.  I connect to the Mini from the MBP using the screen share facility from within Finder in Mac OSX.\nHowever I find the screen sharing option to be very unreliable.  I would say there is a 50/50 chance that the \"Screen Share\" button will be missing in Finder when I go to use it.  Sometimes it reappears after a minute or two.  Sometimes not at all - in these cases I have to plug in a monitor, mouse and keyboard to reboot the Mini.\nDoes anyone know how to make it work reliably or can suggest a better and more stable alternative.\n\nA: I use a standard VNC client. Once you have Screen Sharing enabled on the System Preferences you can access your remote Mac with any VNC viewer/client application.\nMore precisely, on my Mac I use the outdated Chicken (still working fine on El Capitan, though) and for the iPhone/iPad there are also plenty of choices on the App Store.\nNOTE: Make sure that you set a password on the Screen Sharing preferences.\n\nA: You can use TeamViewer. It is a  computer software package for remote control, desktop sharing, online meetings, web conferencing and file transfer between computers.\nYou are just required to insert ID and password (that are automatically generated) in order to connect and share the PC.\n\nA: Use the Screen Sharing utility, which is located in  /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/. I suggest you put the Screen Sharing utility in your dock.  \nOpen the Screen Sharing utility and then enter the IP address of the machine whose screen you want to see.\n", "Q: Import passwords from Safari to Chrome I am just switching from Safari to Chrome in my MacBookPro and first thing I did was to import bookmarks from Safari.\nNow I would also like to import passwords from websites, logins etc.\nIn Chrome > Settings > Sign In > Advanced Sync Settings, I have already checked every available sync option, however just google account passwords have been imported, not Safari's.\n\nI also tried Chrome>Import Bookmarks and Settings>From Safari>Import, but still no results.\nDoes anyone know how to import Safari/Keychain passwords to Chrome?\n\nA: I Think these depend on you Gmail account or which account you used for Sync your passwords... so in chrome you just add you same Gmail or other account and you get your Sync password automatically.\n", "Q: Unknown network file on my IMac I have an unknown network file on my iMac, it appears in the sidebar of Finder, under 'Shared'.  It is called hp3464a93ca02a.  What is this and can I delete it if it is unnecessary?  It has been present for over a year, maybe two and I can attribute no ill effects to it; seems benign, perhaps even helpful.  Just wondering...\n\nA: I've got a very similar name in my Finder sidebar as well.\nIt's an HP product (mine's a printer) that is on your local network that has been setup to be accessible over the network.

Instructions for them can be found at this link:\nCreate a bootable installer for OS X\nYou may be able to call the Applecare Support # (1-800-APL-CARE) as they may have installation media available for free or for a small fee - though I cannot guarantee that they will offer any at all. \nAnother option would be to contact either the closest Apple Retail Store to see if they will mail you one, or an Apple Authorized Service Provider who may also be able to mail one. A list of those can be found here. Be sure to use \"Service\" to locate an AASP. They are licensed repair and service shops for Apple and there may be one closer to your location.\nFinally, you may also find USB flashdrives with the OSX 10.10 or 10.11 installers on them via Amazon for sale, although YMMV - note that any drive purchased on a site such as Amazon may have been tampered with.\n", "Q: iCloud Active. for iPhone 5s I want to buy a iPhone from Mercari. It's in great condition but it says \"no iCloud Active\". Does anyone know what this refers to?\n\nA: This is a good thing, it means that you are free to add your own iCloud account. To add more information, having it linked to someone elses iCloud account is a really really bad thing. When I used to work for Apple, we would get calls from people who thought they got a great deal but when they tried to upgrade to iOS 7, or use the phone for the first time they found out that the phone was stolen. \nOften these were bought at pawn shops.\nI don't mean to say that pawn shops traffic in stolen devices, I do mean to say that they lack the sophistication to understand that the previous customer needs to unlock / sign out of their iCloud account. In addition Apple has a policy of never referring to a device as stolen, so even if I was fairly convinced that I was talking to someone who had actually stolen the phone, we left it up to law enforcement to sort this matter  out.\nThis led to some rather interesting situations that I can't discuss here. I will say that I had customers call who had purchased their device for a major retailer who had taken a return and resold the phone locked to the previous owners account.\nFor a better understanding of this feature of Apple since iOS 7, look at these links from Apple support.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201365\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201441\n\nA: \"No iCloud Active\" means, it is not linked to any iCloud account. It may have been linked to iCloud account previously, but now it's not linked. You can use it with your own iCloud account.\n", "Q: What is special about Preview added text or shape elements? Can I move other elements besides these? I found that if I use Preview to open a PDF file, and use its tools to add text, or shape elements such as arrows, ellipse, rectangle, then I can use Preview to edit them.\nBut if the items are not Preview's, then I can't edit them.  In this case, I have also tried using Adobe's Acrobat Standard or Pro trial version to edit a file, and when I see a person wearing a tie, with a shadow, I can move the tie to the left and move the shadow to the right (not always, for example, if the person with the tie is a pure image, then I can't).\nSo, can Preview have this capability?  Why can I move element that Preview added to the PDF but not move other elements in the PDF?\n\nA: The items you add using Preview.app (text, shape elements, etc.) are annotations (technically correct term), also called \"comments\". \nThe example you mention to move around using Acrobat are part of the contents of the document. \nAnnotations and contents are two completely different things in a PDF. \nAcrobat (Standard, Pro) has the tools to access both. Preview.app (and Acrobat Reader) have the tools to access annotations, but not to access contents. (a bit of a rant: …and that's good so, considering how badly Preview.app can mess up PDFs…).\n", "Q: Disable Reminders \"due\" date Generally, there is no option to set a \"due\" date and time for a reminder, just a \"remind me\" date and time.  However, often when I have a reminder and I change the \"remind me\" time a \"due\" time appears as so:\n\nThe \"due\" date and time does not have a check box like \"remind me\".  How do I get rid of the due date?  The due date seems to be related to a bug where the reminder keeps notifying me and appearing on my screen before it's supposed to remind me (as per the \"remind me\" date).  How can I fix this and in general prevent it from happening?\n\nA: Quick Answer\nTo remove the Due field, simply update it to match your Alarm (both day and time).\nHow To Reproduce\nAdd a new scheduled reminder by tapping the empty line at the bottom of today’s Scheduled list (on iOS). Then instead of tapping Done, tap the ⓘ and change the Alarm. With a poor connection the Due popped up field every time.\nHow To Keep This From Happening\nTap Done (in the upper right corner, under the alarm clock graphic) after creating a new reminder. Then wait for the network activity indicator (next to your network symbol) to stop spinning before setting a new Alarm. The reminder should have shifted into its correct, sorted position by then.\nI have to wonder what the purpose of this Due field is, since there isn’t a way for the user to set it directly. It seems like something that’s used internally by iOS and macOS that’s never supposed to be exposed to the user.\nIt is worth noting that the web app at iCloud.com used to have a checkbox to add the Due field. It has since been retired, though it is still accessible via AppleScript.\n\nA: May be this problem is only Mac related, due a hidden or forgotten CHECK BOX after the text Due date and before the Date.\nTo add Due Date on Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can create a Due Date with Automator. Make a workflow with Create a reminder, run it and set a Due date different to the 'Alert date'.\n\n*The 'Remind Me' app (free on Mac App Store) can do so too.\n\n*Other non-Apple apps that create non Apple-Standard info in the reminders, in this case, a 'Due date' different from the 'Remind me on a day' date. For example, testing it with GoodTask if I set a 'Due date', GoodTask activate the Alert checkbox too. In Apple Reminders is shown as usual: 'Remind me on a date: ...' If I uncheck the 'Due date' in Goodtask, the 'Alert' field goes off too. But if I uncheck only the 'Alert' checkbox, letting the 'Due date' activated, the same reminder in Apple Reminders changed to 'Due date' without the 'Remind me on a day' checked.\n\n\niOS Reminders:\nYou can add both Remind me on a date and Due Date on iOS Reminders- This is a Mac missing feature (Mac OS 11.12.6, I don’t know if this was fixed on High Sierra).\nTo delete the Due Date on Mac:\nA missing checkbox could disable de Due date, but it’s not possible without that checkbox.\n\n\n*\n\n*Making match both date and time (as @user11633 said) you can get rid of the Due date.\n\n*You may look if you created that reminder in other app (BusyCal, GoodTask, Fantastical...)  If you do so, you can delete the 'Due date' on that app.\n\n*Mac app Reminders have a bug because if you have Remind me on a date and Due date, check the Remind me on a location, select any option (When I Arrive, or When I Leave), then, click to uncheck Remind me on a day it deletes the Due Date, keeping the alert on. It's crazy.\n\n\nBy the way, I've discovered that you can change, in Mac, both the 'Due date' and the 'Remind me' date dragging the reminder to the calendar on the bottom left, or drop it into the 'Scheduled' field (at top of the Lists sidebar) to set the date to Today.\nIf you select the due date clicking on the numbers, or with Tab key, then you can change the date and time with cursor up/down. The changes can (some times not) affect to both Due Date and Remind Me (keeping the time difference).\nIn menu Edit it shows: Undo changes in 'Due Date', but there's no visible way to 'unckeck' the Due Date field. This is a proof that the feature exists, but a the checkbox is missing.\n", "Q: Should I upgrade Mac OS 10.6.8 to El Capitan on Macbook Air 2010? I have the Macbook Air 11' late 2010 with Core 2 Duo and 2 GB RAM. I decided to install XCode 7, but it requires Mac OS 10.11 El Capitan. So, should I upgrade OSX on my 5-yearold macbook air? I worry about work speed.\n\nA: I'm posting this answer from a late 2010 11\" MacBook Air running El Capitan, and I have no performance issues. It runs very well. But this machine has 4GB of RAM, not 2GB, and that might make a difference.\nRemember that 10.6.8 has not received security updates for years now, and will be full of unpatched vulnerabilities. It is a risk to keep running it.\n\nA: Here is a link to Mac's system requirements for El Capitan.\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2015/06/09/os-x-el-capitan-system-requirements-compatible-mac/\nMacbook Air is listed as needing \"MacBook Air (Late 2008 or newer)\".\nIn addition, you mentioned your processor.\n\n... the Mac must have a 64-bit CPU, which is typically\n  an Intel Core 2 Duo or newer processor. Beyond that, the requirements\n  are pretty soft and forgiving\n\nBased on the system requirements released by Mac, you sound clear.\n\nA: As mentioned by Mike Scott in its answer, I can confirm that doubling the RAM from 2GB to 4GB will make a very significant difference.\nOn a quite similar model as yours in term of performance, a MacBook white 7,1 mid-2010 with 2,4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo (and NVIDIA GeForce 320M 250Mb GPU) that was running Snow Leopard 10.6.8, going to 4GB RAM changed the computer from very slow (almost \"frozen\") to very fast, even with its original old 5.4 krpm hard drive.\nAfter upgrading to an entry-level SSD and running El Capitan on the same computer, still with 4GB RAM, I cannot observe performance issues.\nI cannot tell if I had kept the original hard drive, but I assume the performance would still be fair. (I assume the original HDD has a good controller.)\n\nA: No - make sure you have a good backup so you can test the upgrade without losing your apps and data that matter to you most.\nYes - once you are confident in your backup, you have only time to lose and can see if things are better or worse with the later software features and security and options for newer third party apps.\n\nAnd, I would probably do an erase install staying at your same version to see if that speeds things up before any upgrade, but that’s just me.

Or is there some other way to accomplish this?\nAnd does the app have to be specially coded to handle this?\nMy company has an app but we don't have the budget right now to update it to handle any special URL schemes, but I'd really like a way to open it directly from a button on the web site.\n\nA: The app have to be coded for it, and the server needs some configuration too.\nCheck this for more information: Support Universal Links. \n", "Q: Exiting/Starting the Terminal (El Capitan) In the latest Mac OS X Terminal version I noticed that if I type exit and the press Enter, I get the following:\nLast login: Wed Jan 27 09:18:48 on ttys000\nIan-iMac:~ Ian$ exit\nlogout\nSaving session...\n...copying shared history...\n...saving history...truncating history files...\n...completed.\n\n[Process completed]\n\nAs far as I can remember, previous versions of the terminal, simply closed the window when you entered exit.\nIs there anyway to restart the same terminal after [Process completed] displays? Or should I completely close the window and restart the terminal? It looks like I can't type anything after entering [Process completed] displays.\n\nA: When the Shell exits, it means that you are done. So one option is to close the window and manually start another one (or you can simply press cmd+N to automatically open another shell).\nAnother option that can save you some time is to make Terminal automatically close the tab after the exit process has been performed properly.\nOpen Terminal Preferences > Profiles > Select your profile > Shell tab > When the shell exits --> Close the window. In such a way, if you want to start again your shell (after having exit) you should just open another one.\n\nA: Once it says \"Process Completed\", the Terminal's session has been terminated, and there is no way to restart that specific session.

You may still get an IPv4 address in some cases, but that space is about exhausted in many regions and you’ll want to reach out to team viewer support or your IT professional if you have one for assistance configuring a proper IPv4 to IPv6 gateway or look for a screen sharing solution that’s compatible with this new technology that was proposed in 1992 and became a draft standard in 1998 and defualt standard in 2017. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6\nIn short, IPv6 is designed for mobile in that thousands of devices per person can now have a unique address and this has significant security and performance benefits over IPv4. Turning off IPv6 in 2018 will break many people’s mobile data, but check with your carrier to be sure.  By removing the NAT layer, each device can have the proper firewall and access rules and not all be lumped behind a shared address. It also enables better VPN capabilities if you indeed want to hide the source address and can now have your r served addresses at home and away. \n", "Q: How can I preserve indentation in Notes.app on OS X? Suppose I've got a text formatted like this:\nTo do:  \n    To buy:  \n        milk\n\nI would like the Notes app to keep the indentation level as I enter a new line:\nTo do:  \n    To buy:  \n        milk\n        sugar\n\nHow ever it jumps to the beginning of the next line:\nTo do:  \n    To buy:  \n        milk\nsugar\n\nCan I do anything about it? (Except using lists/bullet points?)\n\nA: One solution is to write all your list items, one under the other, neglecting any indentation level. Then, you can select all the items you want to be on the same level, and press cmd+]. This will allow you to increase the indentation level.\nAs far as I know, auto-indentation applies just for bulled/dashed lists.\n", "Q: Get Number of PDF Pages in Terminal How can I output the number of pages in a PDF in the Terminal?

I have many small files (about 500). They are in right order. I would like to merge them. \nLinux commands are also welcome because I can compile them in my OS X. \nThe command cat *.ts > masi.ts does not work well. The result stops at some points. I am investigating why this occurs. \nSome parts of the videos are not in order. \nNames of parts of videos where each file has a prefix HRmasi453-27012016.mp4.ts\n1.ts\n2.ts\n...\n100.ts\n101.ts\n...\n200.ts\n...\n300.ts\n\nso the filename is HRmasi453-27012016.mp4-01.ts ... HRmasi453-27012016.mp4-300.ts.\nThe command cat *.ts > masi.ts does not organise the video in the sequential order. \nI think I should make a list before of all items in order. \nThen, merge. \nPseudocode\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a list of videos in order \n\n*Merge cat items in list\n\n\n*\n\n*Do something like filename = prefix + itemInList without creating a new list in the while loop.  \n\n*cat filename >> result.ts\n\nHow can you join the many video files, .ts, files?\n\nA: I need to preface this by saying having not worked with .ts files I do not know whether or not they can be simply concatenated using cat and as you saw because the are numerically named they get mixed up when using cat *.ts > masi.ts because it sorts lexicographically, so using a ordered list is in order.  With that in mind, here is what I did to create a list of 500 numerically named .ts files and then concatenate them using the list.\nI first created 500 numerically named .ts files containing the number of the .ts filename as a control.  I used for i in {1..500}; do echo $i > $i.ts; done  These weren't actually valid .ts files however it allowed me to have 500 files to work with and then see that they were concatenated in proper order when opening the combined.ts file to see an ordered numerical list within the file.\nSince you already have the 500 .ts files, in Terminal do the following:\ncd ts_files_directory\necho {1..500}.ts | tr \" \" \"\\n\" > tslist\nwhile read line; do cat $line >> combined.ts; done < tslist\n\n\nUpdated to include actual filename per your comment to my answer and your updated question.\nThe following assumes that the only numbers in itemInList with a leading 0 (zero)  are e.g., 01...09 and that you change 500 in the {100..500} portion  of the command to the actual count.\nChange directory to that of which contains the .ts files.\ncd ts_files_directory\n\nThe following two commands create the tslist file which is a numerically ordered list of the target filenames to be used with cat in order to avoid the lexicographical sorting issue.\necho 'HRmasi453-27012016.mp4-'{01..99}.ts | tr \" \" \"\\n\" > tslist\necho 'HRmasi453-27012016.mp4-'{100..500}.ts | tr \" \" \"\\n\" >> tslist\n\nWith the numerically ordered list created, use the following command line to concatenate based on the contents of the tslist file.\nwhile read line; do cat $line >> combined.ts; done < tslist\n\n\nA: Very easy way based in ffmpeg docs; the accepted answer is more complicated.\n\n\n*\n\n*first print all the list of files in a file: mylist.txt , give the extension for your file, here is .ts\nprintf \"file '%s'\\n\" ./*.ts > mylist.txt\n\n\n*finally join the file using the txt list, last parameter name file joined, use same extension that the sources files.\nffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i mylist.txt -c copy output.ts\n\nmore info about concatenate:\nhttps://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Concatenate\n\nA: Though I have not done this myself I have seen discussions where people have combined multiple video files using the command line version of FFMPEG.\nI believe there is a Mac version so you don't have to compile it from source on ffmpeg.org but beyond that someone else will have to verify that and help you with the proper command syntax.\n\nA: cat ?.ts ??.ts ???.ts > all.ts\n\nA: I understand you are looking for a elegant command line solution.  However, if you use MKVToolnix, you can load the first TS file and append (merge) an unlimited number of ts files to be muxed subsequently in order into an mkv (for example 10, 5 second ts videos will mux into a 50 second mkv).  You can then mux the mkv back to a ts in tsmuxergui.  \n", "Q: Safari Browser Bar - no longer functioning as expected Please help! \nThe search / address bar in Safari normally autocompletes my typing.

See this discussion about it.\n\nA: You can remove (non-running) application icons from the Dock by clicking \"Remove from Dock\" in the menu shown in your screenshot (or by dragging them from the Dock to the desktop with the Shift key pressed).\n\nA: If you are satisfied with a \"brute force\" technique that does not involve disabling System Integrity Protection, and don't mind having three \"dividers\" in your dock (in place of the Apple SPAM apps), you can replace their \"Contents\" with the \"Contents\" of a bare-bones app that does nothing (so much so, in fact, that it is called \"Nothing.app\" and it does nothing except to launch, quit, and serve as a divider in the dock).\nI created \"Nothing.app\" by starting a new project in Xcode, giving it an icon reminiscent of an earlier generation of the Mac OS X Dock Divider (one that looks a bit like crosswalk stripes), then stripping out everything except the menus \"About Nothing\" and \"Quit.\"\nYou can download a zip file containing \"Nothing.app\" here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/6lb8m35nufnd1mz/Nothing.app.zip?dl=0\nIf you're uncomfortable downloading an app from a stranger, you can stop here.

I don't know what resources are used by adding desktops, but I am certain it is a bigger deal than adding new browser tabs. I've used 8 desktops (across 2 monitors) for awhile. Adding a few more might really improve workflow.\nType of apps I'd like to always have open: Chrome / Finder / Terminal / Xcode / NetBeans / Excel / Word / Skype / MySql / iTunes\nSomething like having 2 word docs, 3 spreadsheets, and 3 browser instances (each using all the monitor space in their own desktops) would be very useful. Just a quick 3 finger swipe, and I'm ready to start thinking in a new context. I love it.\nMaybe, OSX is robust enough, and 16-GB is so much, that I can keep opening desktops until the cows come home?\n\nA: That is heavily dependent on the apps on each desktop and how you have them all configured (desktop picture, icons, etc.)\nI would open up Activity monitor and start adding desktops and see where it takes you.\n\nA: The precious resource consumed by additional spaces is VRAM on your GPU. The higher the pixel count for the desktops, the quicker you’ll run out, but realistically you’ll get stopped by how many space thumbnails fit across the top of your monitors first.\nShort answer: You won’t be causing a problem by opening more spaces, but you will eventually find a hard limit based on frame buffer memory (aka VRAM)\n", "Q: Duplicate calendar events in Outlook 2011 Does someone have a script to merge or delete Outlook 2011 duplicate calendar entries?\n\nA: If your Outlook client is not crashing when you select calendars, there is a method in the UI to remove blocks of duplicate or outdated events. I can't find the link to give credit, but here is the process:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a new calendar categorization, call it 'delete' or something.\n\n*go to calendars view, in list view not grid.\n\n*Cmd-Shift-F 'Advanced Find'\n\n*Select 'All Events' button\n\n*Select search option 'Date Created' = 'Any Date', or use the criteria to identify your targeted events.

I am in the process of setting up a MacPro whose sole purpose is to run VMs on each of the six possible screens each with it's own keyboard and mouse.\nSo what I have is six DVI monitors with six dual-link display-port to DVI/USB adapters and an Anker 10 port USB hub/charger to power them all.  The VMs are to be each assigned their own keyboard through virtualbox USB filters.\nOriginally the monitors were having some trouble coming up all at once (and in order) with a Macally 7 port hub so I'd thought the issue was the amount of power the hub was outputting.  Additionally none of the keyboards except for the one attached directly to the MacPro itself were being recognized so more power was figured necessary.\nHowever even with the more powerful Anker USB Hub the system will not work with the extra keyboard and mouse attached through the hub with a single monitor running.  The \"USB Needs more power.\" message still comes up. These all happened to be old extra Apple keyboards.  I've also tried with a couple of non-Apple specific keyboards and it appears that they only work when hooked up directly to the MacPro even though the USB power message does not come up. Next I'll be trying separate hubs for the display port hookups and the keyboards and mice to see if it is some sort of weird dual-link display-port to dvi issue.\nWill MacPros only recognize a single Apple Keyboard? Only keyboards hooked up directly? Is this by chance a software issue I can disable or work around with extra software?\n\nA: This kind of applies to all hardware, not just apple computers. I did a search for Anker USB Hub. None of the results showed a powered USB Hub. They all relied on the USB Bus for power. \nThe average USB port has about 500 mA available. (900 mA in USB3.0) USB Keyboard uses between 50 mA and 100 mA. The USB hub itself also needs power, more if it's got all those pretty LED's on it. This puts the load between 400 mA (idle?) and 800 mA (all in use?)\nSo, it seems like your using more power than a single USB port can provide. You may just need to upgrade to a hub that supplies it's own power to devices. Which would require a hub with an AC adaptor. \n\nA: For whatever reason, the display port to DVI adapters draw power as well but don't transmit enough power to hook up a Mac keyboard (which is also a hub) but will allow a single low power USB device.\n\nWhat I ended up doing was hook up the MacAlly AC powered hub to the displayport to DVI adapters. Without the keyboards plugged into the dp->DVI adapters the screens come up easier.  The keyboards are all separately attached to the Anker powered hub which is hooked up to the MacPro. With six extra keyboards and mice attached to that they are all now appearing so I can filter them and lock them to specific Virtualbox VMs. \n", "Q: Podcasts showing twice in the \"My Podcasts tab\" on iTunes In the \"My Podcasts\" tab, almost every podcast of mine is appearing twice at the left column like this:\n\nHowever, in the Episode List display mode, everything is just fine:\n\nIs there any way I can get it fixed for the Podcasts display mode so that every podcast only shows up once? \nFor the record I'm using 12.3.2 (the latest version).\n\nA: A day later it managed to fix itself.

AppleScript is a core part of the operating system.\nIf you are running the latest version of OS X, then you have the latest AppleScript.\n\nA: The linked script to get the AppleScript version is bogus.

My goal is to access this Mac from outside the network. Port forwarding is set up on the router. From my client computer I'm able to ssh user@ip for the public IP and I am able to get into the Mac, so port forwarding is working.\nNow I want to set up SSH keys. I've generated SSH keys on my client computer but I wanted to get the SSH Daemon on the Mac setup first. I edited /etc/ssh_config and set PasswordAuthentication no. I restarted SSH with these commands: sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist, then sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist. When I try to SSH in from the client again, it still asks for my password.\nI took a look at this post and from the answer I added UsePAM no to the config file and restarted the service with launchctl again. I'm still being prompted for a password.\nI also tried the solution here. I'm still being prompted for a password.\nHow do I set up my ssh_config to so that it doesn't ask for the password and only accepts SSH keys? Am I not restarting the daemon properly? Is there another step I am missing?\n\nA: I was editing the wrong configuration file! Instead of /etc/ssh_config, I edited private/etc/sshd_config. I think this probably would have also worked if I edited /etc/sshd_config as per the updated answer from @GhostLyrics, but I didn't test that yet so I can't say for sure. After that, I restarted the service with sudo launchctl stop com.openssh.sshd and then sudo launchctl start com.openssh.sshd and I was able to get my desired behavior. Here is the resource where I found the pertinent information: https://superuser.com/questions/364304/how-do-i-configure-ssh-on-os-x\nHere are the config options I changed:\nPermitRootLogin no\nPasswordAuthentication no\nPermitEmptyPasswords no\nChallengeResponseAuthentication no\n\nAfter that I was successfully able to generate SSH keys on my client computer, moved the public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the Mac and set permissions for that file to 644.\nIt is important to note that those permissions are for my public key. My private key permissions are set to 600 on my client computer. This is really important if you have both your public and private key in your ~/.ssh folder and there are multiple users on the system. If your private key permissions are set to 644 then any user could read your private key and impersonate you. Also, the permissions for the ~/.ssh folder should be 700.\n\nA: /etc/ssh/ssh_config is the configuration file for the client which is used if you don't have a more specific one in your home directory. What you want to edit is /etc/ssh/sshd_config which is the one for the server.\nYou will probably want to set PermitRootLogin without-password (or no) and PasswordAuthentication no there. \n\nUpdate:\nSince you are running Yosemite, the file is /etc/sshd_config according to this answer: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/167405/11135\nTo further elaborate why it still prompts when setting PasswordAuthentication no in /etc/ssh/ssh_config it is important to understand what you configured. \"When making an outgoing connection via SSH, don't offer password authentication.\" \n\nA: I'm using Apple-M1 (11.3) now and I found that only setting PasswordAuthentication no does not work, but these two options are enough:\nPasswordAuthentication no\nChallengeResponseAuthentication no\n\n\n\n", "Q: Batch compress multiple folders into individual zip files I have dozens of folders that I need to compress into individual zip files.\nIf I select all of these folders in the Finder and do \"Compress [X] Items,\" I get one zip file containing all of the folders, whereas what I want is one zip file per folder.\nI tried creating a workflow with Automator using the \"Create Archive\" action, but it behaves the same way: inputting multiple files/folders outputs a single zip file. There's no way to specify that the action run on each item individually.\nBasically, I'm looking for a way to avoid having to tediously run \"Compress\" in the Finder on every single folder one at a time. Is there any way to automate this?\n\nA: There's an alternative solution that's built-in if you don't want to use Automator and are fine with changing Archive Utility's settings.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Archive Utility.app located in /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/\n\n*Go to File > Preferences\n\n*Change the \"Use Archive Format\" preference to \"Zip archive\"\n\n*Drag and drop the folders into its icon in the dock.\n\n\nA: Here is an Automator Service1 that becomes available in Finder when Folders are selected and emulates the context-menus Compress [n] Items command except it creates an individual zip archive file for each selected Folder in the name of the selected Folder.  If the Folder Name.zip file already exists then a \" 2\" (space 2) is appended to the filename, e.g. Folder Name 2.zip. This ensures an existing zip archive file is not touched and the zip archive filename will be automatically incremented as necessary.\n1 In macOS Mojave, and later, an Automator Service is called a Quick Action. There are also other minor nomenclature differences but they should be more obvious when comparing them to pre-macOS Mojave Automator workflows. \nTo Create the Service:1\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and select Service1 or File > New > Service If Automator is already open.\n\n*Set Service receives selected to folders and in to Finder.\n\n*Add a Run Shell Script Action, setting Shell: to /bin/bash and Pass input: to as arguments and add the following code:\nfor f in \"$@\"; do\n\n    dn=\"$(dirname \"$f\")\"\n    bn=\"$(basename \"$f\")\"\n\n    cd \"$dn\" || exit\n\n    if [[ ! -e \"$bn.zip\" ]]; then\n        ditto -c -k --sequesterRsrc --keepParent \"$f\" \"$bn.zip\"\n    else\n        n=2\n        for i in $bn *.zip; do\n            if [[ \"$bn $n.zip\" == \"$i\" ]]; then\n                n=\"$(( n + 1 ))\"\n            fi\n        done\n        ditto -c -k --sequesterRsrc --keepParent \"$f\" \"$bn $n.zip\"\n    fi\n\ndone\n\nafplay /System/Library/Sounds/Purr.aiff\n\n\n*Save the Service as: Compress Folders Separately\nTo Use the Service:\nIn Finder or on the Desktop select multiple Folders, then right-click and select Compress Folders Separately from under Services.\nOr after selecting the target Folders, you can also click Finder > Services > Compress Folders Separately from the menu bar.\nThere you have it, a way to compress multiple folder separately and simultaneously at one time in individual zip archives while emulating how Finder creates a zip archive file.

The first time they may appear in the Dock for a second or two; then disappear.\nIt may or may not be a coincidence - but both have 'storage management' in common: SeafileClient and PydioSync. Perhaps more likely to be relevant - both are also using Qt. (It is a coincidence).\nIf I run in terminal from /Applications/[name].app/Contents/MacOS/[script name] then in some cases I see the process exit with an uncaught exception: NSException.\nI can find no similar complaint for either, and have tried a couple of versions. In other words, I'm fairly sure it's something weird with my system.\nI've recently reinstalled OS X, and am on 10.11.3. The issue persists after reboot.\nAfter a bit more digging, I've found - bizarrely - that if I launch with sudo, they work fine. Completely fine. But after closing either via the app or the attached terminal, they still won't open normally.\nI didn't do anything odd to install these - two were downloaded .dmgs, and one was an Homebrew Cask. Other apps function fine.\nAny idea what may have caused this, or how to fix it?\nPermissions set to 755 (anyone can execute) in all cases.\n\nA: Did you perchance move your user directory? If so, I suspect what's happened is that the owner/group of those applications is not the same as \"you\", and that's why they work under sudo and not normally.\nI had this happen to me when I got my new computer. For some reason the machine refused to use the user/group ID from the old machine, and thus I wasn't part of the user/group who had access to things. I was able to fix most of this by selecting my user folder, Get(ting) Info, and then using the gizmo at the bottom to take ownership of everything inside the folder.\nI also recall that there were lingering effects elsewhere, but I don't specifically recall apps being a problem. Nevertheless, I think you want to check to see if you have write access to the various /library folders, both in your own user folder and the system folders. Just try saving a text file into the one in your user folder and see what happens.\n\nA: App bundles have very specific permissions requirements in order to function correctly, it's not just a matter of setting execute bits. (in fact, I believe certain files must not have the execute bit set). \nIf they are in /Applications, I believe using Disk Utility's permission Verify/Repair will fix this for you. \n", "Q: Export frame to Pictures...where?

Is there some external hardware that I could hook up my computer to the Apple TV (Gen 3) through Airplay (the same way that I could use an external wifi usb)? \n\nA: There is no external hardware to use airplay, if your aim is specifically to connect your MBP to AppleTV through AirPlay I think you are out of luck. There may be very tricky ways of doing this, although much of the encoding used in AirPlay is done by hardware(I believe Intel chip) that your laptop doesn't have (as far as I know). \nThere are other options though for wirelessly connecting your laptop to a screen, but thats out of scope I guess.\n", "Q: How to check if memory usage goes above a certain number?

What would be the reason apart from different port number?\n\nA: I'm not sure about what you are consider as multiple login. \nAnyway, the difference between the two protocol is that: HTTPS is the standard HTTP with additional S a secure layer. This additional layer is used to perform an encrypted connection and so the link is more secure. The main motivation for HTTPS is authentication of the visited website and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data.\nThe difference in your intranet company is that with HTTPS you don't need to verified the login multiple time because you are already secure (the server already know you), while from the HTTP you have no encryption and so every time you must autenticate yourself.   \n", "Q: Change the Option+R/L shortcuts to Control+R/L I would like to remap the Option+L/R shortcut on my Mac keyboard to Control+R/L.

But seemingly I was wrong... it might be more like heart bypass surgery.\nMy initial plan was to import the latest Time Machine backup of the old server to the new Mac mini with Migration Assistant.app. While both machines are connected to the same local network, I could not let Migration Assistant.app find the backup file. I chose \"From a Mac, Time Machine backup, or startup disk\" on the screen, but on the next screen the old server is not automatically shown, and I could not connect to the server manually through the \"Other Server...\" button either.\nThen I tried to manually copy the Time Machine backup (Backups.backupdb) to a partition of the new Mac mini.

On the internet sharing panel, there is an option to share the connection from Thunderbolt Ethernet to iPhone USB.\n\nIt would be really cool to provide internet access to the iPhone via the USB cable, but unfortunately it doesn't seem that it works.\nDoes anyone know what's the purpose of that option though?\nThanks!\n\nA: This panel that you are viewing just shows all available network interfaces, whether they work or not. Theoretically it should work. However, I don't think it works Mac to iPhone but I have tested it reversed with Personal Hotspot and it seems to work. Albeit very slowly.\nHope this answers your question.\nCheers! :)\nUPDATE:\nThe iPhone USB network interface is only for showing whether iPhone USB is connected or not. As a side-effect it shows up in the Network Sharing pane.\nThe Network Sharing pane just shows ALL interfaces whether they work or not (even if the interface is not meant to work with Network Sharing it will still show.)\n\nA: Yes, you can share the internet connection on your Mac with your iPhone using a USB cable.

Prevent & disable iPhone iOS 9.2 from auto downloading updates? \niPhone 5 iOS 9.2 - \nToday morning found it had auto downloaded 9.2.1 update - Around 200-400 MB. \nI have a data cap with ISP so I dont want this happening on Apple's control. \nHow can I prevent & disable this? \nI found these older articles but does not seem to have worked/ stopped the download. \nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7256669?tstart=0\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7250272?tstart=0\n\nA: The closest I came was preventing all my iOS devices from reaching the update server. This envolves configuring your internet router in order to do so.\nConfigure your router to block the following domain: mesu.apple.com\nDoing so will still allow your iDevice to talk to the Apple Store, allowing you to download/update iOS Apps.\nSome routers (like mine) only allow me to block 'web sites' not domains. Luckily, that is all we need to do. Blocking https://mesu.apple.com also does the trick.\nI would say blocking the whole domain is a cleaner solution if possible however.\n\nA: Really, if your iPhone is on Wi-Fi and an update is available, it will download the update when you're probably asleep (2:00-4:00AM). There is no way to disable this.\nA workaround would be to turn Wi-Fi on your iPhone off when you go to bed.\n", "Q: Is 4K monitor a good replacement for Retina display? I'm in the middle of reviewing different monitor options to finally buy one for myself. Please do not consider this post as a product placement. I'm not going to promote any particular brand(s), nonetheless I will paste a link to a particular one I found.\nBasically as a MBP user, I fell in love in Retina display but I won't buy Apple Thunderbolt Display (27-inch) because I find this one as overpriced. I'm looking for something that will be as close as possible to Retina. Are 4K monitors good replacements?\nI found one from Kogan (Kogan 28\" 4K LED Monitor (Ultra HD)). Is it worth considering? Kogan was suggested by my workmate (we both develop software) who ordered one for his daily work. Not exactly this model but quite similar.\nCan you share your thoughts or some recommendations?\n\nA: A 13\" Retina MacBook Pro has a screen resolution of 2,560 × 1,600, while the 15\" has a 2,880 × 1,800 resolution. 4K is defined as a 4096 x 2160 resolution.\nSo depending on how big the monitor is, a 4K monitor should actually look better from the same viewing distance.\nAs for my personal recommendation, anything but a Samsung.\n", "Q: prevent inbuilt apache running using server app Using OS X 10.11.3 (15D21), with macports, apache 2.4/php 7.0.2 with OS X Server installed (for TimeCapsule sharing)\nI can't seem to prevent the inbuild apache from starting on reboot.\nif i use:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist\n\nthen reboot and use the command\nimac:scripts pete$ ps -Al | grep httpd\n    0   245     1        4   0  31  0  2623184  21960 -      Ss                 0 ??         0:00.36 /opt/local/apache2/bin/httpd -k start\n   70   280   245      104   0  31  0  2623184   1020 -      S                   0 ??         0:00.00 /opt/local/apache2/bin/httpd -k start\n   70   281   245      104   0  31  0  2623184   1052 -      S                   0 ??         0:00.00 /opt/local/apache2/bin/httpd -k start\n   70   282   245      104   0  31  0  2623184   1044 -      S                   0 ??         0:00.00 /opt/local/apache2/bin/httpd -k start\n   70   283   245      104   0  31  0  2623184   1100 -      S                   0 ??         0:00.00 /opt/local/apache2/bin/httpd -k start\n   70   284   245      104   0  31  0  2623184   1088 -      S                   0 ??         0:00.00 /opt/local/apache2/bin/httpd -k start\n    0   510     1     4004   0  31  0  2496992   9540 -      Ss                  0 ??         0:00.12 /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND -f /Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/services/ACSServer.conf -E /var/log/apache2/services/ACSServer_error_log\n   70   522   510      104   0  31  0  2494944   1184 -      S                   0 ??         0:00.00 /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND -f /Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/services/ACSServer.conf -E /var/log/apache2/services/ACSServer_error_log\n\nthe server app websites is turned off, and if I uninstall the server app, the problem resolves - it is just I want the server app to use TimeCapsule backups.  \n\nA: I had the same problem!\nYou have to edit:\n/Library/Server/Web/Config/Proxy/apache_serviceproxy.conf\n\nand \n/Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/services/ACSServer.conf\n\nChange \"Listen ...\" to \"# Listen ...\" (Change to comment).\nThis prevents the httpd from starting.\nYou have to restart after this! \n", "Q: Magsafe to USB-C converter for charging Macbook Pro 2016 I have a few standard MagSafe 2 chargers left and want to use it with my new MacBook 12.\nAre there any adapters I can use to convert these Magsafe chargers into USB-C chargers that work with the MacBook 12\" or 2016 Macbook Pro?\n\nA: Many marketers will ship and are shipping MagSafe to USB-C Adapter on the market:\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-about-a-magsafe-to-usb-c-converter.1877907/\nI bought two Magsafe to USB-C Adapter on Aliexpress but neither works. \nThe powering light on Magsafe-Connector is on and in the apple menu the battery loading symbol is active for a few seconds but the battery is actually not loading. The merchant gave me a refund after i showed him a video of the attempt.\nBe sure you understand the return policy if you aren't willing to eat the cost for testing aftermarket chargers. \n\nA: Not to be contrarian, but you would come out better if you sold your existing MagSafe adapters and bought USB-C PD adapters. There are some really great ones like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Anker 60W - $40 on Amazon\n\n*Apple's 29/61/87W models\nI expect battery units within a few months that also provide appropriate current connectors so you can avoid needing wall power in the first place. Since this is a standard, more and more displays, power strips and third party chargers will be hitting the market since you initially bought your MacBook \"One\".\nBetter being:\n\n\n*\n\n*better in cost\n\n*more efficient and higher charging voltage with less current\n\n*less need to remember a connector\n\n*lighter and/or more compact\n\n*better reuse of your older adapters (people will pay good money for working MagSafe and also working MacSafe parts for their needs since Apple doesn't sell them directly)\n\n*newer power adapters for your MacBook\n\n\nSee http://www.anandtech.com/show/8539/usb-power-delivery-v20-and-billboard-device-class-v10-specifications-finalized for a nice consumer overview of why USB PD 2.0 is a good standard for charging going forward. \n\nA: Such a product can not exist: Apple has patented MagSafe technology and thus such a product would be illegal. Even if it were made, your MacBook would likely detect it as a fake charger and stop itself from charging like iOS devices do.\nHowever, you can easily plug an inexpensive USB to USB-C cable into a standard USB port on the back of your Thunderbolt Display and charge your USB-C MacBook from there. Here's one such cable on Amazon for $11.\nThis is a safer, simpler, more reliable, and less warranty-voiding way to charge your 2016 MacBook Pro directly from a monitor (like the Apple Cinema or Thunderbolt displays) without using up another outlet for your laptop power supply (or spending nearly $100 on a new power adapter and cable from Apple).\nI have personally used the linked cable; it works just fine charging my usb-c devices. \n\nNote: Just about any USB to USB-C cable will work here, just look for one with a Benson seal of approval like the one I linked.\nNote 2: User bmike adds that you should be sure to get a USB-C cable that supports power delivery; the one I linked to does.\n\nA: The Apple MagSafe connector is proprietary to Apple. This is why you are having difficulty finding any: There are no 3rd party solutions here.\nThat Apple would not consider this to be a scenario work resolving is to me a bit of a mystery: nearly every Thunderbolt Display customer would require such an adapter for their new macbook. I presume they figure customers would rather buy a new monitor?\n2 suggested solutions:\n1) Fortunately for you, the Magsafe power cable from the Thunderbolt display is Single Purpose: it only supplies power. Replacing it loses no other function. Therefore, you can simply add a USB-C power adapter (plugged into the wall/mains) and run the cable alongside your Thunderbolt cable from the monitor. Simply hideaway the Magsafe cable. \nYes this might be a bit more unsightly than your current two cables, but should be simple to accomplish, and can be as easily well hidden as your current setup.\n2) I have found great success in using a Thunderbolt (now UBS-C) docking port, hidden away under my desk. My monitor, external hard drive, network, etc all connect to the dock, and I have a single Thunderbolt (USB-C) cable from the Dock. I have a small USB hub attached behind my monitor to replace the convenient USB ports I would get from an Apple Display. \n\nA: UPDATE: Allegedly Snapinator is a scam\nI'm not deleting this answer so that people *don't keep buying it*.\nIt is not clear if the connector from Snapnator will be able to accept an actual MagSafe cable, but even if it does not it might still be an interesting option.\nSnapnator on Kickstarter: a Magnetic Power Connector for all USB-C laptops\n", "Q: Run command line tools as separate app Is there a way to run command line tools as a separate app, so I can easily switch between them with apple+tab etc? I want this for things like a mail and irc client where I don't want to hunt down the terminal window to access them. Something like http://www.fluidapp.com but for the terminal.\n\nA: You can open separate instance of Terminal.app with\n/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal &\n\nYou'll have separate icon on the Dock also.

I would like to download an extensive list of macports packages through an accelerator and install them offline.\nUsing the following command, the list of packages required was obtained,\n port echo rpedof:<pkg_name> and not installed\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed beyond that. I could painstakingly find the port for each one, but there far too many.\nAll I require is to have an output in the form of lists of urls for each dependant package. I'll be able to do the rest with download scripts.\nIs there any way to do this?\n\nA: You can use port fetch rdepof:$pkgname and not installed to trigger only downloading source code. Given that you want to use download accelerators, that probably doesn't do what you want.\nIf you just want to get the URLs for downloading, see port distfiles rdepof:$pkgname and not installed and parse its output. Note that you may have to deal with ports fetching source code from Git/Subversion/etc.\nYou can use a script I wrote a while ago as a starting point; it already parses the output correctly and initiates the download (using curl), however it downloads every URL in the mirror list, not only one of them. The script is at https://trac.macports.org/browser/contrib/port-checkmirrors/port-checkmirrors.\n", "Q: iTunes tracks are not playing or downloading from Purchased After purchasing a new iMac computer, I naturally opened up iTunes and began to download my purchased music onto the machine.

The song would download, then iTunes would say \"There was an error downloading the song\", then I would have to redownload it from Purchased, which worked. But some of the songs, even though they downloaded fine after the second try, just simply won't play when I click on them. What I mean is that they show up in my Music Library, but they won't play when I double-click them, instead, the song will briefly show up in the Now Playing bar, then disappear as iTunes skips to the next song.

What I tried is TeamViewer and VNC, but at both I'm not able to change the resolution for the remote connection. Only the resolution of the integrated screen seems to be supported (1280 x 800).\nMicrosoft RDP is able to do this on Windows machines. How is this done with a Mac?\n\nA: There's a subtle difference in the 2 technologies-- and kind of a misnomer.\nApple's remote screen sharing technology is based on VNC -- Virtual Network Computing. You'd think this would be a virtualized technology that would provide you with whatever screen resolution you wanted, right?\nAnd Windows RDP -- Remote Desktop Protocol -- it would only give you what appeared on a remote desktop, right?\nWrong and wrong.\nApple's VNC-based Screen Sharing will show you what the user's preferences are set to. This is great for supporting a remote user -- you see exactly what they see, even if they have multiple monitors, you can pick and choose which one (or both) that you want to see.\nAnd if there's someone already logged on to the system and you're connecting from another Mac? You're given the choice of whether you want to connect to their account's display, or use your own account's preferences. Multiple users simultaneously on one Mac, even with different screen resolutions.\nSo the trick is, set your account's preferences to what you want to see remotely; by default, that's going to be the native screen resolution your MacBook Pro supports. I think that once you've set those on your desktop, you're only given the option of scaling it on the Screen Sharing session if you're logged in with a user account not associated with a physical display (the Display preferences shows your remote session as an Unknown Display.) \nBut changing the resolution to something that's not reflected on the remote display? That's virtualized technology only supported by Remote Desktop.\nYes, confusion, caused by poor choices in names. Apple's use of Screen Sharing is probably the most appropriate name of them all.\n", "Q: OSX 10.11 incorrectly sees application as powerPC I have built and successfully run an application on OSX 10.11.

Roadblocks make successful viruses of yesteryear hit a brick wall.  This is one of those walls.\n\n*Money: The developers over at Apple want you to use their applications, not the applications you found over the internet because every app you use is a potential attack vector from unscrupulous developers worldwide.\n\n*Protecting users from themselves: Apple developers only want power users to created docked items, you don't want novices figuring out \"Hey!

However, when it restarts, it says something along the lines of 'no bootable device'  If I hold down 'alt', the only options are to boot back into OS X & the recovery disk.\nI realise this question has been asked countless times - I have read a lot of them but few seem applicable to my situation and those that are have not helped yet. I have not tried another USB yet since I am bandwidth limited (both in download speed and data limit) and BCA wants to redownload Windows support files every time and at this point it feels like a shot in the dark.\nAny help with this will be greatly appreciated.  Some further questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to determine whether the usb drives are at fault?\n\n*Does BCA create the bootable drive in any special way? I.e. is it possible to create it by another method that will still play well with the bootcamp process?\n\n\nA: Installing Windows 7 or 10 Pro 64 bit without DVD or Flash Drive\nIf you are trying to install Windows 7 on a 2012 through 2014 Mac, then you should read my answer to this question.\n\nSpecial thanks to user Rafa, who was able to correct this procedure so it now works with Windows 10.\n\nHere I assume your computer is configured as required by the Boot Camp Assistant. (In other words, you will be installing Windows to the 4th partition on disk 0.) Also, your firmware is up to date and you have downloaded the correct \"Boot Camp Support Software\" for your model Mac computer. Before starting, remove all DVD's and external devices from your Mac. \n\nNote: Some of the steps, that do not involve VirtualBox, have images captured from a VirtualBox window. This was done when this was the easiest way to create an illustration. I suppose I could have cropped the images, but I chose not to.\n\n(Hint: For a better view, click on an image or open an image in a new window.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a MS-DOS (FAT) formatted partition on your Macs internal\ndrive. This is where Windows 7 will be installed. You can use the\nBootcamp Assistant, the Disk Utility, or commands (distutil, gpt\nand/or fdisk) entered in a Terminal window. Other third party\ntools, such as gdisk, can also be used. Give the label for\nthis partition the name \"BOOTCAMP\". When finished, quit all\napplications.\n\nThis procedure requires the \"BOOTCAMP\" partition be the 4th partition on your Macs internal drive (disk0). If you are using the\n  Disk Utility from OS X 10.7 or newer and your Mac has the default\n  drive configuration, then the new \"BOOTCAMP\" partition should be\n  created as the 4th partition automatically. However, if you are using APFS and the default drive configuration, then the new \"BOOTCAMP\" partition should be\n  created as the 3th partition automatically. \n\n\n*Make sure the drive is using the GPT/MBR hybrid partitioning scheme. See my answer to the question \"How to convert a drive from the GPT format to the hybrid GPT/MBR format when using High Sierra (macOS 10.13.2)\" for a procedure that accomplishes this task.\n\nUser Semi has noted that the Boot Camp Assistant (BCA) will correctly GPT/MBR hybrid partition the drive. So, you may be able to the the BCA to partition the drive, then use the flash drive to install Windows.\n\n\n*Download and install a free copy of VirtualBox. I used\nVirtualBox 5.0.14 r105127, Copyright © 2016.\n\n*Do the following to transfer the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" to a\npartition compatible with VirtualBox. Create folder named\n\"VirtualBox\" in your Documents folder. Open the Disk Utility and\nfrom the menu bar select File->New->Blank Disk Image. Create\nthis image in the \"VirtualBox\" folder using the following\nparameters.\n\nUsing the Finder application, copy the \"Boot Camp Support Software\"\nto this new partition. When finish, this new partition should appear\nin the Finder as shown below. (For readers with older Macs, you may\nonly have the \"BootCamp\" folder.)\n\n\n*This step will create the file needed by VirtualBox to access the\npartition containing the \"Boot Camp Support Software\". In a Terminal\napplication window, enter the following commands.\n\nNote: I assume you are using the default Bourne-Again Shell (bash). \n\ncd  ~/documents/virtualbox\nopen  bcss.dmg\nDISK1=$(mount|awk  -F  s1  '/BCSS/{print$1}')\ndiskutil  unmountDisk  $DISK1\nvboxmanage  internalcommands  createrawvmdk  -filename  \"$PWD/bcss.vmdk\"  -rawdisk  $DISK1\n\nThe result should be the creation of the file bcss.vmdk in your\n\"VirtualBox\" folder. Later, you will select this file to give a\nvirtual machine access to this partition.\n\nNote: At this point, one should realize it would be easier to copy the commands from this document and paste them into the Terminal\n  application window.\n\n\n*This step will create the files needed by VirtualBox to access the\nphysical partition where you will install Windows. In a Terminal\napplication window, enter the following commands.\ncd  ~/documents/virtualbox\nDISK0=/dev/disk0\nPARTITION=4\nPARTID=\"$DISK0\"s\"$PARTITION\"\ndiskutil  unmount  $PARTID \nsudo  chmod  go+rw  $PARTID\nsudo  vboxmanage  internalcommands  createrawvmdk  -filename  \"$PWD/bootcamp.vmdk\"  -rawdisk  $DISK0  -partitions  $PARTITION\nsudo  chown  $USER  bootcamp*.vmdk\n\n\nNote: This access granted by the chmod command will only last\n  until OS X is rebooted.\n\nThe result should be the creation of the files bootcamp.vmdk and\nbootcamp-pt.vmdk in your \"VirtualBox\" folder. Later, you will\nselect the file bootcamp.vmdk to give a virtual machine access to\nthe physical partition.\n\nNote: OS X prefers to automount file systems. This can be disabled for a particular partition by creating or modifying the /etc/fstab\n  file. Instead of employing the /etc/fstab file, the user is asked\n  to repeatedly enter the following commands.\ndiskutil  unmount  $PARTID;diskutil  unmountDisk  $DISK1\n\nThese commands unmount the physical \"BOOTCAMP\" partition and the disk image file bcss.dmg containing the \"BCSS\" partition.\n\n\n*Configure the virtual machine. Open the VirtualBox application and\nclick on icon above the New label. Enter or select the values shown\nbelow, then click the \"Continue\" button. \n\nUse the default settings except for the hard drive. Choose the \"Use\nan existing virtual hard drive file\" button. Navigate to your\n\"VirtualBox\" folder. Highlight the bootcamp.vmdk file. Before\nclicking the \"Open\" button, enter the following commands in the same\nTerminal application window.\ndiskutil  unmount  $PARTID;diskutil  unmountDisk  $DISK1\n\nOpen the bootcamp.vmdk file. Your window should appear similar to\nwhat is shown below.\n\nClick the \"Create\" button.\nAfter returning to the VirtualBox application's \"Oracle VM\nVirtualBox Manager\" window, click on the icon above the\n\"Settings\" label. Next, click on the icon above the \"Storage\" label.\nIn the \"Storage Tree\", \"Controller: SATA\" should be highlighted.\nRight click on this highlighted area and select \"Add Hard Disk\".\nChoose the \"Use an existing virtual hard drive file\" button.\nNavigate to your \"VirtualBox\" folder. Highlight the bcss.vmdk\nfile. Before clicking the \"Open\" button, enter the following\ncommands in the same Terminal application window.\ndiskutil  unmount  $PARTID;diskutil  unmountDisk  $DISK1\n\nOpen the bcss.vmdk file. Next, select the \"Use Host I/O Cache\"\noption. Your window should appear similar to what is shown below.\n\nHighlight the Empty CD/DVD and select \"Choose Virtual Optical Disk\nFile...\" to attach your Windows 7 iso file. (Hint: Look for the\nCD/DVD icons)\n\nClick OK to close the window. Your \"Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager\"\nwindow should appear similar to what is shown below.\n\n\n*In this step, you will copy the necessary files to the physical\npartition, so later you can restart your Mac and install Windows.\nEnter the following commands in the same Terminal application\nwindow.\ndiskutil  unmount  $PARTID;diskutil  unmountDisk  $DISK1\n\nNext, click on the icon above the \"Start\" label to boot from the\nWindows 7 iso file. Press the space bar, if prompted to \"Press any\nkey to boot from CD or DVD.\"\n\nNote: The mouse pointer must be over the virtual machine screen window before you press the space bar.\n\nWhen the display below appears, click the \"Next\" button.\n\nWhen the display below appears, select \"Repair your computer\".\n\nWith the button \"Use recovery tools that can help fix problems\nstarting Windows.\" selected, click the Next button.\n\nSelect the \"Command Prompt\" option.\n\nInsure the drive letters C through F are not assigned by default\nto a volume by entering the following commands. \nmountvol  c:  /d  >nul\nmountvol  d:  /d  >nul\nmountvol  e:  /d  >nul\nmountvol  f:  /d  >nul\n\nEnter the following to determine a list of the current volumes.\ndiskpart\nlist  volume\n\nThe image below displays the volumes found on my Mac. You may get\ndifferent results.\n\nEnter the following commands, to assign the drive letters D, C\nand E to the CD-ROM volume and the volumes labeled \"BOOTCAMP\" and\n\"BCSS\", respectively. In the image shown above, these are volumes 0,\n3 and 4. If your volume indices are different, make the appropriate\nsubstitutions. Also, NTFS format the \"BOOTCAMP\" volume.\nselect  volume  3\nassign  letter=c\nformat  quick  fs=ntfs  label=BOOTCAMP\nselect  volume  0\nassign  letter=d\nselect  volume  4\nassign  letter=e\nlist  volume\nexit\n\nWhen finished, the volume letters should appear similar to what is\nshown below.\n\nNext, enter the commands givens below. The bootsect command writes\nboot code to a Volume Boot Record (VBR) of a partition and Master\nBoot Record (MBR) of the corresponding drive.\nbootsect  /nt60  c:  /mbr\nbootsect  /nt60  e:  /mbr\n\nThe next sequence of commands creates a Virtual Hard Disk (VHD)\nfile. The VHD represents a virtual flash drive from which Windows\nwill be installed on to the physical \"BOOTCAMP\" partition.\n\nNote: If you are installing Windows 10, then the parameter fs=fat32, in the format command shown below, should be replaced\n  with fs=ntfs.\n\ndiskpart\ncreate  vdisk  file=c:\\flashdrive.vhd  maximum=8000  type=fixed \nattach  vdisk\ncreate  partition  primary\nformat  quick  fs=fat32  label=FLASHDRIVE\nassign  letter=f\nexit\n\nFinally, copy the Windows installer iso and \"Boot Camp Support\nSoftware\" files first to VHD, then directly to the physical\npartition where Windows is to be installed. Exit the Command Prompt\nwindow when finished.\nxcopy  d:*  f:  /s  /h\nxcopy  e:*  f:  /s  /y\nxcopy  f:*  c:  /s  /h\nexit\n\n\nNote: The files \\sources\\boot.wim and \\sources\\install.wim take a long time to copy. The file sizes are 168 MB and 2.95 GB,\n  respectively.\n\nSelect the \"Shut Down\" button to shutdown the virtual machine. Quit\nthe VirtualBox application.\n\n*This step will involve configuring Master Boot Record (MBR) of your\nphysical internal drive. The MBR is stored on the first 512 bytes of\nthis drive. This space is shared by boot code and the MBR partition\ntable. \n\nThis step can not be preformed under OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) with System Integrity Protection (SIP) turn on. (This is the default\n  setting.) If you are using OS X 10.11, you must disable SIP,\n  complete this step, then restore SIP. See the link: How do I\n  disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) AKA “rootless” on OS X\n  10.11, El Capitan?.\n\nIn a Terminal application window, enter the following commands. The\nfirst fdisk command flags the \"BOOTCAMP\" partition as the active\npartition. The second fdisk command changes the \"BOOTCAMP\"\npartition id to 7. The final fdisk command copies the boot code\nfrom the MBR of the disk containing the \"Boot Camp Support Software\"\npartition to the MBR of the physical disk containing the \"BOOTCAMP\"\npartition.\ncd  ~/documents/virtualbox\nDISK0=/dev/disk0\nPARTITION=4\nPARTID=\"$DISK0\"s\"$PARTITION\"\nopen  bcss.dmg\nDISK1=$(mount|awk  -F  s1  '/BCSS/{print$1}')\nINPUT=$(printf  \"f  $PARTITION\\nq\\ny\")\nsudo  fdisk  -e  $DISK0  <<<\"$INPUT\"  &>/dev/null\nINPUT=$(printf  \"s  $PARTITION\\n7\\nq\\ny\")\nsudo  fdisk  -e  $DISK0  <<<\"$INPUT\"  &>/dev/null\nsudo  fdisk  -u  -y  -f  $DISK1  $DISK0\ndiskutil  mount  $PARTID\n\n\nNote: To display the value for the variable INPUT, use the command echo \"$INPUT\".\n\n\n*This is the step where you install Windows to your \"BOOTCAMP\"\npartition. Restart your Mac and hold down the option/alt\nkey. Select the Windows icon to boot from the \"BOOTCAMP\" partition.\nOpen a Command Prompt window, by navigating through the displays as\nyou did in step 7. Enter the commands below to attach the\n\"FLASHDRIVE\" partition stored in the Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) file. \ndiskpart\nselect  vdisk  file=c:\\flashdrive.vhd\nattach  vdisk  readonly\nlist  volume\nexit\n\nOn my Mac, the output from the list volume command shows E to\nbe the drive letter assigned to the \"FLASHDRIVE\" partition. If your\ndrive letter is different, make the correct substitution when\nentering the e:\\setup command given at the end of this step. Next,\nremove all the files, but one, from the \"BOOTCAMP\" partition.\nrmdir  /s  /q  c:\\\n\n\nIf the above command executes correctly, you should get the error message: \"c:\\flashdrive.vhd - The process cannot access the file\n  because it is being used by another process.\"\n\nStart installing Windows 7 by entering the command given below.\nSelect \"BOOTCAMP\" as your installation partition.\ne:\\setup\n\nThe installation files are stored in the \"FLASHDRIVE\" partition.\nSince this partition is stored as a VHD file in the \"BOOTCAMP\"\npartition, do not try to reformat the \"BOOTCAMP\" partition. You will\nremove these installation files in a later step. When your Mac\nrestarts, it will boot to OS X. This is to be expected. From the\n\"System Preferences\" select Windows as your startup disk and restart\nthe Mac. Your Windows installation will continue.\n\n*Once Windows finishes installing, the \"Boot Camp Support Software\"\n can be applied. To access this software, the c:\\flashdrive.vhd\n file, containing the \"FLASHDRIVE\" partition, needs to be attached.\n Click on the \"Start\" button, type in diskmgmt.msc and hit the\n return key. Once in Disk Management, click on Action\n in the menu bar and select Attach VHD. Select the file location\n and check \"Read-only\" to prevent writes to the VHD  file. After you\n hit \"OK\", the drive will show up in Disk  Management with a blue\n icon. Close Disk Management.\nIn the AutoPlay popup window, select \"Open folder to view files.\"\n (If no popup appears, use the Windows Explorer to open the drive\n labeled \"FLASHDRIVE\".) The setup.exe file can be found in the\n folder labeled  \"BootCamp\". Execute this application to install the\n \"Boot Camp Support Software\". The VHD file will detach when the\n computer restarts.\n\n*Finally, remove DVD and \"Boot Camp Support Software\" folders and \n files.  This can be accomplished by dragging the \n c:\\flashdrive.vhd file to the Recycle Bin. If you get an error \n message about the file being open, restart the computer and try \n again.\n\n\nClean Up\nThe \"Virtual Box\" folder can be deleted. You will probably need to eject the \"BCSS\" partition first.\nYou can delete the \"BootCamp\" virtual machine. This can be done from the VirtualBox application. If VirtualBox does not remove all the files, you can remove them manually. Look in the ~/\"VirtualBox VMs\" folder.\nYou can delete the Windows 7 iso file.\nYou can remove the VirtualBox application, but since it takes such little space, I would not bother.\n\nA: I do not have a new enough Mac to install using a USB flash drive and I have not created one recently enough to remember what is stored on it. You can mount the iso file and I believe you should be able to compare with the content on the flash drive. But again I am not sure.\nYour external USB ports are both USB 3 and that might just be the problem. The Windows 7 installer may not work with USB 3 ports. Do you suppose Apple expects you to use an external optical (DVD) drive?\nIt is possible to install Windows 7 without the use of a USB flash drive or a optical DVD drive. The process is tedious and I will not go into the steps unless you are interested. You will need to download free third party software to do so.\nDid you download the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" and follow the steps outlined at the site given below?\nInstall Windows 7 and earlier on your Mac using Boot Camp\n\nA: It so happened that I did a win10 install on my MacBook Air just yesterday, and I ran into exactly the same problem of seeing \"no bootable partition\", followed by having only two choices at the boot selection screen after power cycle. However, I didn't do anything special to get it working. I just restarted it again, while holding down the Option key from the beginning, and the USB (windows) showed up as one of the boot choices. I'll just list everything I can think of so that you might spot something:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Air (mid 2012). Latest El Capitan 10.11.3. USB 2 flash drive (not USB 3).\n\n\n*\n\n*Download win10 64 bit installation ISO file from MS.\n\n*Use BCA to create bootable installation drive on the flash drive, and download the boot camp files to the same drive. Create bootcamp partition (70GB)\n\n*Remove a JetDrive that I had in the SD card slot. No other external drive except the USB flash drive\n\n*Restart. Shows the \"no bootable partition\" message.\n\n*Power down. Power back up, with Option key pressed. Only see \"Macintosh HD\" and \"Recovery 10.11.3\". Select \"Macintosh HD\".\n\n*On desktop, check to make sure the USB drive has the right stuff (e.g. autorun.inf, setup.exe, boot directory, BootCamp directory, etc.)\n\n*Restart. Hold the Option key when it starts to power up.\n\n*Now it shows 4 choices on the boot screen: Macintosh HD, Recovery, USB (Windows), USB (EFI boot).\n\n*Choose USB (Windows). Installation starts.\n\n\n", "Q: iPhone Network lock - Fact or Fiction? Following a recent conversation with my provider's help-line, the Customer Service Rep stated:  \n\nCSR: All phones are network-locked.\n  Me: Not ones bought directly from Apple.\n  CSR: Even ones from Apple will network lock after the SIM's been in it for a while.\n\nI'm skeptical that Apple would lock all phones in the UK. Are iPhones specifically sold within the UK network locked?\n\nA: Bullshit, we had an iPhone 6, only seeing an O2 (UK) card for a year. After that it just accepted a Hungarian card (Telenor HU) without any issues.\nBut beware with one thing: \"unlocked\" from Carphone Warehouse in UK means \"unlocked for any UK networks\", not internationally (that's why it is cheaper). Buy from apple.co.uk if you really want it to be surely unlimitedly unlocked, nowhere else. They are saying it on their own website when you try to order a \"sim-free\" one: \n\"iPhone will lock itself to the network of the first SIM card that is used in the phone. Subsequently attempting to use it on any other network, for example by replacing the SIM card, may mean it becomes permanently unusable.

It also didn't show speed, but it's showing that the position on map jumped occasionally.\nI don't think it's GPS signal issue, I brought a Garmin bike computer one time and it recorded the flight just fine. I still have the records of a couple of flights, it's interesting to see that planes don't just take the shortest path. The only thing that didn't look right was the altitude, since it's using barometer and the cabin is pressurised.\n\nA: For most practical situations, GPS will work well enough for you to track your progress but not have great coverage (less than 2m accuracy) or accurate speed over ground readings from iOS.\nFrom an antenna / physics perspective, you may have horrendous GPS reception since you are riding inside a mostly complete faraday cage. Even if you have your phone in a window, all the visible satellites might be in a configuration where GPS is very poor or unable to generate a usable fix.\nClearly, cruising altitude is generally one of the best places for GPS reception as long as the antenna is placed on a tip / extremity of the plane. You don't have multi path interference to speak of, no foliage, and no hills or buildings to interfere with a clear view horizon to horizon - not to mention that your altitude will let you see more than the normal \"half the sky\" visibility you get on the ground at best.\nThe phone hardware and iOS will certainly try to get you the best fix it can once you have the device out of Airplane mode. I know many pilots that report the iOS GPS in the cockpit is quite good / on par with the other consumer and even commercial navigation products.\n\nA: Domestic Satellite Navigation systems usually include limitations as a  security measure.  The general rule is that nothing off the shelf should be able to assist in the creation of a guided missile.\nTo that end most, if not all, civilian GPS units will fail or work poorly if any of the following conditions are met:\n\n*\n\n*High Altitude - Once you are higher than a mountain you are no longer a normal civilian user.  This limit is usually very high though (50,000ft), more commonly edge of space rather than domestic airline altitudes.\n\n*High Speed - If you are doing more than one or two hundred miles an hour you are probably a high speed vehicle or missile.  That being said the limit could be set well above the speed of sound so that civilian aircraft are unlikely to hit it.\n\n*High Dynamics - If you are performing high speed turns you might be a missile or air-craft evading attack.  It is usually not possible for commercial passenger aircraft to perform manoeuvres that trigger these limits though.\n\nYou may find that this causes an issue when using your phone on-board an aircraft.  I use to build test equipment for GNSS systems and would often find GPS units behaving strangely if I started to simulate any of the above conditions.\nPoor reception due to the fuselage is also a possibility.  To test if this is the limiting factor, rather than the security measures, simply try using your phone's GPS within the plane while it is on the ground before take-off.  If you can get a position fix before take-off but struggle once in flight it will be the security measures limiting you.  I would expect most phones to not be limited by this though.  If you can use it inside a bus or train without being by a window I would expect the shielding and signal levels to be similar to inside a aeroplane.\n\nA: It will work, but you must hold the phone at the window. And sometimes it takes plenty of time to fix the signal. \n\nA: I can't speak to an iPhone specifically, but an iPad Air 2 works just fine as long as I'm in a window seat. I use ForeFlight, software used for navigating while flying, all the time during commercial flights when a passenger. During the climb/descent a turn might throw it off and it'll take a few seconds to reacquire the signal, and it might require holding it right to the window to reacquire position. But in cruise, once it's got a position, I can leave it on the tray table and it'll happily show position, ground speed, and GPS-computed altitude for a half hour or more without issues. The altitude is of course slightly off because when you're in cruise the plane is flying not at a fixed \"feet\" altitude but rather at a given flight level.\n\nA: GPS itself works very well even in space. As the other answers have already mentioned the problem with low signal inside the plane is probably the biggest problem you will face.\nHowever, all GPS receivers are limited to speeds and altitudes.\nSee http://gizmodo.com/5824905/your-gps-doesnt-work-at-mach-2-because-its-afraid-youre-a-soviet-spy\n\nA: Here is a picture that I have taken in the plane using my iPhone 6. It is the IGO application on the screen. I do not know the exact altitude but it was really high. You can see our ground speed.\n\n\nA: GPS was designed for use in space and at high altitudes. Get close to a window and it will work (iPhone 5s, SE, iPad 2, iOS 9, 10). \nYou should turn off WiFi and cellular data, because the iPhone will also use cell-phone and WiFi signals to triangulate the position. These may be stronger than GPS but may be far off and stationary on the ground. If you try recording the GPS track, it will be jumpy because of this effect. The effect may be worse, if you have in-flight WiFi which is tied to some location on the ground.\n\nA: You iPhone GPS works fine in flight mode, the main limiting factor is the Faraday cage effect which will limit your view of the sky if not in a window seat. even in a window seat you may not always have a clear view of the 4 satelites required. Next time you are on a plane in a window seat try PocketGPS for iPhone which is free and has no adds. There should be no hight restrictions below 50,000 feet and the speed of a commercial aircraft will also be well within that allowed by GPS.\n\nA: I've been happily using my iPhone GPS while flying in Europe without a problem, mainly to ID my photos. But here's a curious sudden change. I often fly from Switzerland to southern Spain and have been able to get clear IDs for the entire flight. This week it worked fine over Switzerland and France but all GPS ID's stopped as soon as we entered Spanish airspace and my photos show them once again only when we were on the ground. I changed no settings during the flight. So I'm assuming Spain has suddenly put new security measures into place. I wonder if other countries are doing the same. It's the only explanation I can think of.\n", "Q: External drive is damaged and freezes my Mac. Any way to recover?

However, with a damaged disk, the first step should be to attempt to diagnose/repair it. Since that didn't work, tell us what went wrong. It'll give us a lot of insight into what may have happened and how we can fix it.\nSince You Can't Repair The Disk\nIt's possible (although unusual) that using the command line fsck will help. Follow this guide and let us know what happens.\nCommand Line?\nThis doesn't seem like it should work, but if the disk is accessible from the command line, you could just use command-line copy paste.

However, I work a lot in Google Docs and Gmail... and Google Chrome (or any web browser) does not let me use all of the commands that Apple's dictation provides. It's missing essential selection, navigation and editing commands that are available when using an Apple app like TextEdit. Those commands are essential for moving the cursor around and making fixes without the keyboard. The only solution that's been working for me has been to type in TextEdit, and then to copy and paste into the browser. But this is not a real solution.\n\nIt would be nice to stick with the native (and free) Apple dictation software on the mac, so does anyone have an idea to get these dictation commands to work in a web browser for use with gmail and google docs? \nEdit: I found that Safari lets you use Apple's dictation with gmail, but still not with Google Docs.\n\nA: Google docs uses a custom javascript application that disables the services component of the Mac (that lets the built in Mac voice dictation work.). If you want to use voice dictation in Google Docs, you have to use there build in functionally, and you MUST use Google Chrome.\nFrom Google:\n\nFor an easy way to put words on a page, you can type with your voice in a document.

When you are ready to speak your text, click the microphone or press Cmd + Shift + S on your keyboard.\n\n\n*If this is the first time you've let Chrome use your microphone you will get a little pop-up from the top of the screen asking to OK Chrome using your microphone. Hit Allow to enable the microphone in Chrome.\n\n\n*Once you click in the Click to Speak box, the mic icon will turn orange and appear in a circle.\n\n\n*You can now dictate into your Google Docs. As you do the mic icon will show when it detects sound with an outer ring.\n\n\n*When you're finished, click the microphone again.\n\n\nFrom Google:\n\nWhile voice typing in Google Docs is only available on computers, many Android and iOS phones and tablets have built-in microphones that\n  you can use with a document. Look for the microphone icon on your\n  mobile keyboard.\n\nFor more information you can check out the Google Help Documentation here:\nTyping With Your Voice.\n\nA: You can make custom commands for any key bindings you would use in Gmail and Google Docs. For example, here is a command for moving the cursor to the end of the line in Gmail.\n\nYou can find this menu under Accessibility>Dictation>Dictation commands>+\nSo, so long as you have key bindings for the stuff that you want, you will be able to manually create voice commands.

My own system is I think fully \"up to date\" as far as Apple security updates through the App Store, but the version of OpenSSL installed on my system is 0.9.8zg, a version that was current during the past year, but lost all security support as of Dec 31, 2015.\nhttps://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160128.txt\nI read elsewhere that, when one uses a VPN, and that VPN client comes bundled with a different, later version of OpenSSL (say, version 1.0.1r), that VPN client's version will supersede--that is, the more up-to-date version will mediate the negotiation with a network connection in a browser.\nMy two, related questions are: \n(1) is this accurate? If so, it would seem that running a VPN with a current version of OpenSSL would nominally 'protect' the user better than a deprecated version installed on the OS, correct? \n(2) If a user has no VPN, is the user then relying on the vulnerable version of OpenSSL in the OS alone for that layer of security? Or are later versions of OpenSSL somehow 'bundled' within specific applications--the browser, Skype, iTunes, etc.--just as it is 'bundled' with a VPN client?\n\nA: Having done further research, I see the following appears to answer my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenSSL is just one of many SSL/TLS implementations\n\n*OS X does not rely solely on OpenSSL (though the deprecated version of same is still installed with the OS), but rather its own implementation called \"Secure Transport\"\n\n*Depending on the application in use (Firefox, iTunes, Mail, etc.), either OpenSSL (firefox), Secure Transport (iTunes, Mail), or yet some other SSL/TLS implementation may be utilised for the secure handshake\n\n*Because the VPN adds just one 'layer' of security, independent of the security implemented by the application, the TLS implementation at the VPN layer in no way affects that used at the application layer (a useful analogy is the layered 'tubes' analogy provided here: \nhttps://security.stackexchange.com/questions/27891/how-do-a-vpns-route-ssl-traffic-and-do-they-compromise-security\n", "Q: How do i remove this Guest User / greyed out remove button One day i got some malware on my mac.

This is enough to stop anyone logging in as guest on your Mac.\n\nA: The guest user account is required by or at least in some way connected with both FileVault and Find My Mac.  I’ve repeatedly encountered hearsay insisting that disabling it impairs Find My Mac, but so far as I’ve been able to find, Apple has said nothing.\nIn the past, I’ve suppressed it on the logon screen for users who found it confusing of irritating by setting a hidden preference.

Now I want to be able to install a Linux distribution (most likely my own custom one, but lets use Ubuntu as an example).\nFrom all the examples I found on the web, they were either, \"Dual-boot with rEFIt\" or, \"Pure EFI-boot, with an uninstallation of OS X and re-installation afterwards\".\nWhat I want, is something that looks like *this:\n*picture grabbed from second link\n\nWith my Linux and Mac OS X partitions neatly tucked in there.\nThe second link does what I want, except OS X is uninstalled, which I don't have the time or external hard-drive reliable enough to not corrupt everything on copy over due to the age and damage.\n\nThis process will wipe OS X and any other data you have on the machine. All of it. That’s the whole point. Make backups.\n\nI don't want this. So is there a way (god forbid, there MUST be) that I can get Linux on my Mac, and be able to hold Option/Alt on boot, to select one of the 4? (OS X, Windows, Linux, Recovery)\nI don't want GRUB, rEFIt, a command line, nothing. Just ye' olde OS X boot-loader.\n\nA: 1) Resize your OSX Partition, leave the space created as freespace (i.e don't create any partition)\n2) Write the iso to USB and boot it (take the most recent image from http://cdimage.ubuntu.com)\n3) Create ext4 for / where the freespace was created, use sda1 (osx: disk1s1) or use another EFI if you have more then 1 drive and you want to use the second for linux only - in short: use the EFI partition as the \"bootloader\" partition\n4) Install Ubuntu (or any other distro) - but watch for the bootloader, if you don't want to use grub (care to elaborate, why?) you need to rebless the volume in os'x to boot through the normal bootscreen where you can hold ALT to fire linux.\nI don't know what you want to achieve with that, since having grub is basically the same, and you will be loading grub from that screen anyways since you need to load the kernel somehow - guess there are other options but I never used them, just went with grub.\nWhat I mean is that after you select the other partition with the normal bootscreen by holding ALT, you will load grub - since you must load the kernel, and there is now way to load it directly from that screen other then using MBR which even makes less sense since it's a UEFI system ;-)\nnote: I strongly advise you to use refit - it's a very good solution and has some extra functionality that will make multi-os setup's boot better. \nIf you don't like it, just rebless the volume in os x and you get rid of it. \nbless is a system command- however in the new os x there is: \nsudo systemsetup -liststartupdisks\nand to setup back any Volume as the sys volume use:\nsudo systemsetup -setstartupdisk /Volumes/YOUR_SYS_VOLUME_NAME\nto check if it worked:\nsudo systemsetup -getstartupdisk\nSo even if something goes FUBAR with the bootloader, it won't be any problem.\nWhy would you reinstall os x or anything else to boot linux on a Mac?!?

My husband will take the earpiece out of his ear but leave it active. When a call comes in it rings in the earpiece and not through the phone. He hates the lag time it takes for the earpiece to connect if turned off but it also hurts to leave it in his ear. If the phone would just always ring, it wouldn't matter where the earpiece was.\n\nA: I don't think that this is possible. If one has a Bluetooth headset connected with his iPhone, all audio will be played through the headset, not the iPhone. You can keep the devices paired and disconnected and that will save a lot of time when you switch to and from bluetooth headsets.\nSince the software won't do what you hoped, an option would be to look into using a more comfortable or faster Bluetooth accessory or even choosing portable speakers as they often work well. Also, you might see if your phone supports Bluetooth LE (4.0) as the latency to connect drops from 100ms to 6 ms (which is how long the hardware takes to recognize a reconnect to a known device - as opposed to re-pairing two devices for the first time) to reduce the time it takes to transfer to the newer headsets.\nAnother option would be to get something like the Apple Watch so that you get notified of calls and alerts without needing to hear any sound and/or having the sound very close to your ears no matter what the iPhone has connected to it.\n", "Q: I have to reboot mac to restart bluetooth every morning I'd like some help understanding why I have to restart my Mac every morning when I get to work in order for the bluetooth to start working again.  It is a work provided machine, running Yosemite and it has a couple things which I cannot remove as well, like Symantec this and that.  Once I reboot though, I am good all day long and never have a problem with bluetooth.  It is only when I come in to work in the morning, and it is EVERY morning, without fail.\nIn contrast, my home MacBook, never has this problem.  The difference in machines are that my home machine is several years older (2011 ish), is running El Capitán, and does not run any Symantec anything.  Does anyone have any ideas why I might be having this problem?\n\nA: If you could narrow down when the bluetooth fails - that might help us help you. Apple will give you instructions on how to enable bluetooth diagnostics if you reach out to their support organization. \nYou might start with generating a diagnostic report each morning when the failure is present. Option click on bluetooth in the menu bar bluetooth icon - and the report will be generated on your desktop.\nYou might also schedule a shut down and restart each morning if you just with to sidestep the unpleasantness of waiting for the restart. That option is in energy saver in system preferences.\n\nA: If left on overnight, perhaps the work machine runs a script of some sort every night and applies changes that affect the functionallity of bluetooth.\nSymantec shouldn't be related to the symptoms your machine is experiencing.\nIt is also possible that the bluetooth chip is faulty (but that's rather unlikely).\nAre others experiencing the same or is it just your mac?\n", "Q: Syncing OSX settings and preferences to iCloud Is there a way to sync/save OSX's own settings, preferences, etc to iCloud?\nI use OSX El Capitan.\n\nA: In short: No, not easily.\nThere is no officially sanctioned or supported way to sync your preferences to any cloud service.\nA longer version: Maybe, but it will be unsafe and prone to breakage.\nWhile you might have some limited success symlinking either folders or individual files into a cloud storage provider's folder, I would advise against it.\n\n*\n\n*You cannot be sure what operating system upgrades would do to them\n\n*You cannot be sure what happens if you accidentally remove the cloud folder and the settings are either no longer there or point to locations which are no longer valid.\n\n*You risk leaking credentials or tokens (think non-browser cookies used for authentication) to said cloud service if things are not properly secured.\n\n*You might - for some reason - come across the idea of syncing these files with another Mac at the same time, e.g. to keep settings synced amongst all your machines. I don't want to think about what happens when you start having multiple settings files with \"conflicted copy of X-2015-04-02\" or similar.\n\n*You don't know exactly when these files get written to. If there are changes on shutdown, you'll not be able to sync those files until next start. By then, if using two Macs, you'll already have introduced conflicts.\n\nDisclosure: I have synced some user folders myself this way, but only very specific items (e.g. my customized Sublime Text things). However, even with such limited setups I've had problems. (For example the license I own didn't get properly synced without tweaks.)\n\nA: I use Mackup – it works great, and supports iCloud (as well as DropBox, Google Drive, etc.)\nBut I highly recommend you configure it to ONLY backup the apps/settings you want. Otherwise it can make a big mess of your system. \nRead the README!

But Texstudio only allows you to open a single pdf viewer window. I would want to open several to be able to look at the pdf output in different places at the same time (it would significantly improve my productivity). \n(OS X El Capitan)\n\nA: The answer was in a comment by Jonathan Schuster to the question Reopen PDF in Preview on the same page when modified externally that Graham Miln pointed at.\nIn his comment, Jonathan wrote\n\nFor what it's worth, I've found Skim to be a good viewer that doesn't\n  have this issue. Just make sure to check \"Check for file changes\" in\n  the Sync section of Preferences.\n\nwhich neatly answers my question.\n", "Q: What happens when the kernel_task is killed? What happens when you kill kernel_task on OS X? Is that even possible? I know that the system reboots because of kernel panic when you kill launchd, but I can't find any resources online and am afraid of trying to kill kernel_task.\n\nA: You can't properly kill kernel_task. Activity Monitor doesn't allow you to kill kernel_task at all - neither as admin nor as root.\nIf you try to outwit kernel_task by using kill -9 0 or /bin/kill -9 0 as root you just kill yourself i.e. the first command kills bash (kill is an integrated command of bash) and the second command kills /bin/kill because in both cases the 0 is interpreted as me/yourself and not as kernel_task.\nThe man page for the system call kill (which is called by both kill and /bin/kill) explains that\nIf pid is zero:\n    Sig is sent to all processes whose group ID is equal to the process group ID of\n    the sender, and for which the process has permission; this is a variant of\n    killpg(2).\n\nThis makes it basically impossible to even attempt to kill the process with PID 0.\n\nA: You cannot kill kernel_task because it represents the MacOS kernel. The kernel is the core of the MacOS operating system, and the kernel starts all other processes on the computer-even launchd. Killing kernel_task would be the same as trying to remove something from itself-in this case, trying to remove the operating system from the operating system.\nThe only way kernel_task would be killed is if it experiences an internal error. But then, it's not being killed... it's crashing\n", "Q: Are mini DVI port and DVI port the same thing? I have an old MacBook and im trying to connect it to a new TV, I have a mini DVI port but can't find adapters for it. Is mini DVI and DVI the same thing? I'm looking for some kind of adapter to HDMI port.\nThanks!\n\nA: Monoprice sells a Mini-DVI to HDMI adapter (as well as other Mini-DVI adapters). \nhttp://www.monoprice.com/Product?p_id=4852\nMini-DVI and DVI are the same electronically, but the mini connector is much smaller and a regular cable will not fit.\n\nA: Mini DVI and DVI are electrically the same but different physical connectors. Mini-DVI was never a standard, and only was found on Apple hardware until it was replaced with MiniDP. Apple made an adapter that lets you plug in a full-size DVI cable but they haven't produced a computer with this plug in many years so the adapter is no longer available from them, and I don't believe anyone other than Apple ever used the mini-DVI connector so it's not a common cable others would manufacture. You should be able to find an old one online somewhere. \nI don't know if there was ever a mini-DVI to HDMI adapter because HDMI wasn't yet common when these laptops were produced, but being electrically identical to standard DVI it should be possible to use a mini-DVI->DVI adapter + DVI->HDMI adapter. \n", "Q: Batch Job Scheduler This might be weird to ask, since in all these years I've never used a Mac as a \"remote scheduler\", but this is what I need now.\nCan you recommend a batch job scheduler?\nWhat I need is to login via ssh, launch commands and be able to exit from the shell. When the system will be able, the scheduler will run my job (usually a shell script). It would be cool to have the system send an email when it finishes.\nI have seen screen or at, but it's not what I'd really need (at requires a time, and screen is just a shell that can be detached). With these tools I need to manually schedule jobs. I've used some clustering facilities under linux, using qsub to submit jobs, and it was neat. \nHowever, installing torque might be really cumbersome, and I am stuck with it. It needs openssl-devel and I don't know how to install that, I thought using homebrew and installing openssl (with the correct $PATH) would be sufficient, but it's not.\nDo you have any \"easy\" to setup batch scheduler recommendation?\nThanks!\n\nA: Looking at the List of job scheduler software at WikipediA which support event driven job scheduling and lists OS X as a Platform was only one package, JobServer by Grand Logic.\nBeing that this info is from WikipediA, this of course by no means is necessarily a complete and or authoritative list, however it's a place to start. \n", "Q: What is the MacOSX.sdk file? Where do I find it? I am trying to do a build of Cyanogenmod, that outputs the error:\nCan not find SDK  at /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk\n\nHowever, the /Developer/SDKs directory does not even exist. I know that most of the libraries have been moved to Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/, but I don't know where to look. What is this MacOSX.sdk file? Where can I find it?\nAlso note that the wiki of Cyanogenmod says that I should Install the Mac OS X Developer Tools from my DVD, but I upgraded to Mavericks with the App Store. What do they mean by Developer Tools? I do have things like make and gcc (Command line tools in Xcode).\nThis is the wiki page I found the instruction to install dev tools from DVD:\nhttp://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Template:Build_on_Mac_OS_X#Install_Developer_Tools\n\nA: As mentioned by Mark in the comments the instructions are made for older versions of Xcode. \nIn my opinion you can simply link a MacOSX sdk to /Developer/SDKs:\nsudo mkdir -p /Developer/SDKs\nsudo ln -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.8.sdk /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk\n\nadditionally you can add a link named MacOSX10.6.sdk\nsudo ln -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.8.sdk /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk\n\nAnother tip is to edit build/core/combo/mac_version.mk and changing:\nmac_sdk_versions_supported := 10.6 10.7 10.8\nto\nmac_sdk_versions_supported := 10.6 10.7 10.8 10.9 10.10\n\nI strongly recommend to use a virtual machine (Mountain Lion) and an older Xcode version (4.6.3). This version as well as all other versions are freely available with an Apple ID at Downloads for Apple Developers\n\nA: Older versions of Xcode used to install themselves and files into the /Developer folder.\nThis is no longer the case, so you would need to find / download the same version of Xcode that your package expects or update the package.\nIf you are a paid developer, you might be able to find that old package amongst the downloads and re-install it. Worst case, you could ask developer support for a download if you can't find it once you're logged in. This will likely be far easier than trying to change the code to work with the new Xcode setup/layout.\n", "Q: iCloud login loading I changed my Apple ID password and want to login to iCloud with my Mac. \nEntered password, and now it shows me loading and I can't do anything: neither restart the computer nor cancel the request.\n\nPlease help, it has been over 10 minutes . . .\n\nA: Force restart it either by holding down the power button or using command+control+power button.\n", "Q: Do you know if there is anyway to turn off the iPod Touch pinging NTP server? We have a bunch of iPod Touch devices deployed in an Enterprise environment, they are pinging NTP server and it looks like it is for accurate time keeping. Is there anyway I can turn off the devices pinging the NTP server? We are hearing from the network guys that pinging is slowing the network down. The real problem we are trying to solve is the WIFI Drop, for some reason these devices are dropping 5 to 8 times a day and the network guys are saying that this is due to the iPod Touch devices pinging the NTP server. Is that traffic so high to cause WIFI drops?\n\nA: Easy. Go to Settings > General > Time & Date > Turn off Set Automatically. \nThis will allow you to set the time on the iPod manually AND stop it from pinging Apple's NTP server (time.apple.com).\nMore on that here.\n", "Q: Is it possible to encrypt the boot disk in El Capitan? On my iMac running OS X 10.11.3 I'd like to encrypt as much as possible of the built-in disk -- like that I don't need to worry about replacing/sending in a broken disk. \nFrom a casual few web searches it appears not to be possible to encrypt absolutely everything, so right now my strategy is to partition in the disk to have a large, encrypted data partition.\n\nA: It's possible to encrypt the entire system volume with FileVault 2 -- open System Preferences -> Security & Privacy pane -> FileVault tab, and click Turn On FileVault. I'll walk you through some setup questions (most important: set up an emergency recovery option, either by linking to your iCloud account or by generating a random key you should write down and store someplace safe), then restart the system and begin encrypting the volume in the background.\nThis isn't quite full disk encryption, because it leaves the (hidden) Recovery HD partition unencrypted. Recovery HD contains emergency repair/reinstall tools, as well as the booter that's used to unlock and start up from the main (encrypted) volume. But no user data gets stored in Recovery HD, so this isn't a significant weakness.\n", "Q: Running mod_perl on El capitan I'm trying to run mod_perl on El capitan.\nProcess\n\n\n*\n\n*Following http://blog.n42designs.com/blog/2014/10/23/compiling-mod-perl-for-apache-2-dot-4-on-os-x-10-dot-10-yosemite/ an https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34240610/how-to-install-mod-perl-2-0-10-in-apache-2-4-on-os-x-el-capitan\n\n*The correct repository is different for El capitan, so use svn co  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/perl/modperl/tags/2_0_9/\n2.perl Makefile.PL MP_CCOPTS=-std=gnu89 ; make ; sudo make install I could get /usr/libexec/apache2/mod_perl.so\n\n*In /etc/apache2/other directory, I added cgi.conf with the following content. \n\nLoadModule perl_module libexec/apache2/mod_perl.so\n#PerlModule ModPerl::Registry\n\n<Location \"/Library/WebServer/Documents/cgi/\">\n    SetHandler perl-script\n    PerlResponseHandler ModPerl::Registry\n    Options ExecCGI\n    PerlSendHeader On\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n</Location>\n\nI copied simple perl cgi script in the /Library/WebServer/Documents/cgi/ directory, but instead of execution the perl script, the perl code is shown. \nWhat might be wrong? \nADDED\nAfter adding these lines in the conf file:\n<Files ~ \"\\.(pl|cgi)$\">\n    SetHandler perl-script\n    PerlResponseHandler ModPerl::PerlRun\n    Options +ExecCGI\n    PerlSendHeader On\n</Files>\n\nI have errors instead:\n[perl:error] [pid 26307] [client ::1:60248] failed to resolve handler `ModPerl::PerlRun': Can't locate ModPerl/PerlRun.pm in @INC (you may need to install the ModPerl::PerlRun module) (@INC contains: /Library/Perl/5.18/darwin-thread-multi-2level /Library/Perl/5.18 /Network/Library/Perl/5.18/darwin-thread-multi-2level /Network/Library/Perl/5.18 ...\n\n\nA: For Mac OS X, /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables has already setup, so there should be no configuration.

I have been reading that it is now possible to access Find My Friends from iCloud.com,  and I have a friend who is able to do so from their iCloud.com account: It shows up in the iCloud menu under the URL \"icloud.com/#fmf\".  But when I log in this URL silently chops off the \"fmf\" part, the \"Find My Friends\" app doesn't show up from the menu, and when I try to use an invite from my friend, it tells me to install the app on my iPad.\nI don't have an iPad. In fact I don't have any mobile devices which are made by Apple, which is the whole point of wanting to use iCloud.com.\nHow do I get Find My Friends to show up on my iCloud.com account?\nUpdate: I found that I can enable iCloud on my Mac by going to System Preferences -> iCloud and signing into with Apple Id.  After I do this, icloud.com/#fmf works to the extent that it brings up a map, but I still can't see any friends.  Then, when I try to click on the link in the invitation from my friend, I get the following message:\nFind my Friends\n\nTo view <friend's name> (<friend's e-mail>) location, open your\ninvitation in the Mail app on your iOS device and tap View Request. If the \nFind My Friends app is not installed on your device you can download it\nfree from the App Store.\n\nWell.... once again I don't have an iOS device, and if I did I don't know how I would open the invitation in the Mail app, because my Apple Id is linked to a GMail account, not an iCloud account!\n\nA: You can't to my knowledge. Find My Friends (sadly) requires an iOS or OS X device be configured for use with Find My Friends at least once. If you have no Mac or iOS device, you can't. If that article wasn't clear enough (it's rather vague) here's a more explicit one.\n\nNote: If you don’t see Find My Friends on iCloud.com, your account just has access to iCloud web-only features. To gain access to other iCloud features, set up iCloud on your iOS device or Mac.\n\nAfter you do that, then you can access it from the web.\n", "Q: Can Facebook read my calendar on iOS?

I am looking for an application which can simply allow me to change some words in the PDF (Preview cannot do it).\nPlease, pay attention that PDF editing and adding to PDF file some notes and shapes are not the same things. Preview cannot actually edit the content of the PDF. \nI've purchased FineReader for a full price, but in contrast with Win version it does not allow to edit the text at all, thus my scanned and OCRed documents have some \"typos\" of FineReader which I want to correct. \nI look for a PDF editor with only 1 ability - simply to edit text, nothing else.\n\nPlease do not buy w0ndershare software - they corrupt real pdf files if you use trials. \n\nA: The industry standard for this purpose is called …\nAdobe Acrobat DC Professional\nYes, it can a lot more, but so far, I have not found any other tool which is as reliable.\n\nA: After a day long searching I think I found the best solution I could - \nMaster PDF Editor\nIts trial version does add watermarks, but in contrast with w0ndershare and iskys0ft (I think these companies are the same - very aggressive and unhonest), the watermarks are at the top and bottom of the page and not obscuring the main page.\nI bought the full version and I think it is very good for direct and actual TEXT editing. \nhttps://code-industry.net/\n\nA: I use PDFpenPro from Smile Software, which I got at a discount as part of a bundle, because I couldn't find quality free software to do the job. \n(Having built apps that interact with PDF files before, it's not easy and I wouldn't expect anybody to build software to do it for free.)\n", "Q: Can I get a 'modern' browser for Mac OS X (10.7.5) without upgrading to OS X El Capitan? I am using Safari (6.1.6) for all my web use but certain sites I use often are telling me my browser is out of date. I gather Safari cannot be upgraded to a more modern status.  \nHaving read the often less than complimentary reviews of 'El Capitan' which I assume would be the next logical step, I wonder if I can keep my OS X version but use another more up to date browser.\n\nA: You can currently use Chrome, the world's most popular browser, but not for long. Google are dropping support for OS X versions before 10.9 from April of this year. A Chrome version you download now will keep working, of course, but it won't get updates.\nHowever, it's unsafe to use the Internet from OS X 10.7.5, regardless of which browser you use. It's not received any security updates for years, so it's full of unpatched known vulnerabilities.\n\nA: I find the website Cross Browser Testing really useful.  It give a matrix of operating systems and browsers and you can see which ones are supported.  \nFor example you can click on 10.7 under the Mac OS X heading and then choose Safari in the browsers section and see that Safari 6 is the only version supported.\nHowever, if you select just 10.7 you can see that there is a lot more versions available for Google Chrome, Firefox and Opera.  \nAs the other answers suggest, I would be very careful running outdated software as they do have known security vulnerabilities. Have a look at the CVE Database for current known vulnerabilities for your software.\n\nA: The Opera web browser is still up-to-date. It's what I'm using as my MacBook can't run anything newer than OS 10.7.5.\n\nA: Lion browser support\nAs of this writing, no major browsers support Lion. Chrome supported Lion until April of 2016 while Firefox supported it until August 2016. The default Safari browser hasn't been updated since 2014. Opera is built on Chrome's Chromium webkit engine so Opera support was also cut around the same time as Chrome.\nThough there are \"security risks\" with using Lion to browse the net, I haven't had any problems. The main concern is when websites no longer support these older browsers. However, there are a few years before that will happen. Generally, software support for Lion is becoming scarce and an alternative solution will soon be necessary.\nAlternative solutions\nAside from trying to install a newer version of OS X on an unsupported Mac (don't try it; it doesn't work very well on machines dropped with Lion), the best solution is to install an alternative operating system. Linux operating systems support the latest versions of Firefox and Chrome. Another alternative is installing Windows. Officially, the maximum Windows OS supported on MacBooks is Windows 7 x86 but I've been able to run Windows 10 x64 with a couple glitches. Two finger scrolling doesn't work and the function keys don't have the normal functions in OS X. The display brightness also can't be changed. If you don't want to pirate Windows, a digital license key can be purchased on eBay for under $10. I also highly recommend spending $10 and upgrading to 4GB of RAM to avoid using SWAP memory.\nWhy were many of the A1181 MacBooks dropped at Lion?\nMany of the A1181 MacBooks were stuck with Lion. It's a shame Apple didn't bother rewriting x64 drivers for the graphic processors in those models as the graphic card is the only factor keeping these models from the newer operating systems. I'm a third-hand owner of MacBook 4,1 (early 2008).\nA note to Apple\nPlease stop releasing operating systems every year and indirectly forcing users to upgrade to a new computer every few years. The new features I'll never use don't compensate for the premature loss of software support.\n\nA: You have to accept that 10.7 is an extremely outdated operating system, and very few browsers will support it. El Capitan had some bugs when it launched, but those have mostly been ironed out.\nHaving said that, according to the Firefox page they still support 10.7.5 (and 10.6 even).\n", "Q: Disable Screen Sleep AppleScript Is there a way to turn screen sleeping on and off temporarily through AppleScript? I'm making a script at the moment that will run for a few minutes when I'm away, so I don't want it to sleep, but don't want to manually do it every time.\n\nA: Certainly the easiest way to accomplish this is by using do shell script. pmset is definitely a viable option, though I am personally partial to the caffeinate command, which doesn't modify any preferences and doesn't require administrator privileges. You could use the following AppleScript to keep your screen awake indefinitely:\ndo shell script \"caffeinate -di\"\n\nAlternatively, you can run caffeinate for a specified amount of time, after which your display will be free to go to sleep:\ndo shell script \"caffeinate -dit [time in seconds]\"\n\n\nA: You can use the AppleScript do shell script command with the pmset command to alter the energy saving settings.\nThe following example disables display sleep:\ndo shell script \"pmset -a displaysleep 0\" with administrator privileges\n\n\nA: You can do caffeinate -i <SHELL_SCRIPT>.\nFrom the caffeinate manpage:\n     caffeinate -i make\n        caffeinate forks a process, execs \"make\" in it, and holds an assertion that prevents idle sleep as long as that\n     process is running.\n\n", "Q: Middle row of keyboard (a-;) duplicating top row (q-p) I have a 2010 white Macbook and the middle row of the keyboard has gone funny.

Select your model from the list and then select keyboard replacement. I've repaired a slightly older MacBook than a 2010 for one of customers before, and it wasn't all that difficult, but just take a look at the guide from beginning to end to make sure you're comfortable with the repair before you attempt it.\n", "Q: Custom label is now missing The 'Custom Label' in Contacts is now gone missing on my iPhone 5c, how do I restore this label to my contacts?\n\nA: I think the Custom Label field is only visible for contacts on GMail, as opposed to on iCloud. Go to Settings → Mail Contacts, Calendars → Contacts / Default Account and set it to your gmail account. For the contacts you create now, they'll be saved on GMail and the Custom Label field will be available.\n", "Q: Is there a difference between iPhone LTE band support and carrier compatibility? I have an unlocked iPhone 5s model 1533 GSM which supports LTE bands 3, 7, and 19 (800, 1800, 2600 MHz) as per this page: http://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE. These are the bands used in Spain (http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Spain). However, the Apple page suggests that even though the 1533 model is compatible with these bands, it is not compatible with Spanish carriers and instead you need model 1457. Note also that model 1457 is not listed as compatible with Canadian carriers even though it is compatible with the LTE bands used here (700 and 1700 MHz).\nDoes this mean that although the Spanish LTE frequencies are supported, the phone will not work on LTE in Spain because the carriers aren't supported on model 1533?\nOr does it mean that although not officially supported, the 1533 model will work with Spanish carriers if I purchase the appropriate sim in Spain?\n\nA: If Apple says you need a specific iPhone 5s for Spanish carriers, then you probably do. Even if a US iPhone supports all the LTE bands in Spain, you're just better off buying the phone made specifically for your country.\n\nA: It means that although not officially supported, the 1533 model will work with Spanish carriers if you purchase a sim in Spain. I just got back from Spain where I bought a SIM and the phone worked.\n", "Q: How do iPhones acquire date and time?

I previously asked this question about what I might lose if I were to switch from iTunes Match to Apple Music.  The basic consensus was that for my needs, I really wouldn't lose anything.

Unfortunately now that I've lived with Apple Music for a while, I've come to a rather unpleasant conclusion.  I believe I have now completely lost the ability to add new items to my iTunes library and play them from my phone.\nMy library is maintained on my home desktop computer, and also now partially on the cloud via Apple Music.  I don't store songs locally on my phone due to limited storage space.  Previously with iTunes Match, I was able to play anything in my home library from my iPhone 4s which is running iOS 8.1.2 (and I'm not willing to upgrade to iOS9 and suffer possible performance hits as well as application compatibility issues, nor am I willing to upgrade to a newer phone because they are too stupidly big).  Now however, it looks like anything that was added to my library prior to my Apple Music subscription, is still playable remotely.  But anything I add to my library now, is not.\nSo am I right that since I now subscribe to Apple Music and not iTunes Match (and paying a whole lot more now, I might add), that my iOS8 phone can no longer stream any newly-added songs even though I've made them \"available for download\"?  They do appear on my phone but are greyed out and cannot be played.\n\nA: OMG I figured out what's happening, and I'm horrified.\nIf the song in question is available in Apple Music, then that song will be automatically treated AS an Apple Music item and therefore will NOT be able to stream even after being added to the iCloud Music Library, on any device running an OS older than 8.4.\nSo to be clear... music that I created myself that is 100% original (say something out of Ableton Live, Logic Audio, etc.) will be able to be streamed to my phone running iOS 8.1.2.  BUT (and I just did this myself so I am 100% positive it is correct), say I rip a song myself from a CD (or download the song from any other website, etc.).  If I add that song to my library, it will appear as an MPEG Audio File (or aac or m4a etc.) and be able to be added to the iCloud Music Library, but if that song  is also available in Apple Music, then it will NOT stream to my phone!\nAdditionally, (and this is the really horrible part)... if I remove the download from iTunes, and download it again from the cloud, it downloads an Apple Music DRM-encoded file instead!\nThe old MP3 (or whatever) version is still on my hard drive, but the iTunes reference now points to their DRM-encoded Apple Music version, and it will not be playable in anything but iTunes.\nI'd like to believe this is a bug, but I have a feeling it's intentional.  iTunes never used to do this, and in my opinion this is pretty nasty... if I hadn't caught what was going on, I could have ended up with a substantial portion of my library all being converted into Apple Music files instead of the MP3s, AACs, etc. that I already have.\nUPDATE:  I'm on the phone with Apple now and it's confirmed.  Apple Music without iTunes Match will not allow streaming of any newly-added and matched content, to any iOS device using iOS prior to 8.4.  Also Apple Music will always replace any matched songs (even if you ripped them yourself from a CD) with DRM-encrypted versions, should you ever download them from iTunes Cloud (paying for iTunes Match would prevent this).  So basically it's $25/year to remove DRM for good from non-Apple Music files.\nI'm amazed I didn't run into this when I investigated using Apple Music in the first place.  I understood that music I actually download through Apple Music (as an Apple Music AAC file) would be DRM, but to lock down my own CD rips if I ever need to download them again!?!?  Brass balls Apple.  Brass balls.\n", "Q: What non-Apple external monitors are currently recognized as 2 pixels per point? I was thinking about getting a Dell 4k or perhaps a 2560x1440 display, but then I realized that not all non-Apple displays are recognized as 2 pixels per point even though the ppi is high enough.\nIs there a list of non-Apple displays currently accepted by OS/X as 2 pixels per point?\n\nA: Since Retina is an Apple trademark, the \"official\" answer is no third-party display gets that recognition.\nAccording to wikipedia, all Mac that are marketed with Retina displays have a pixel density of 220 PPI or thereabouts, so you could make an argument that any external display that's IPS and at least 220 pixels per inch would be in the \"Retina class\".\nThe iMacs are slightly less than 220 PPI:\n\n\n*\n\n*Retina 4K iMac - 21.5-inch diagonal - 4096 × 2304 pixels\n\n*Retina 5K iMac - 27.0-inch diagonal - 5120 × 2880 pixels\n\n\nApple markets color depth, lack of distortion, wide viewing angle in addition to pixel density sufficient for a normal viewing distance to make things non-pixelated to the average sighted person. You may or may not care about those other metrics when shopping, but pixels are easiest to count so I'd start there.\nYou can also read Apple's documentation on what is required to drive these high pixel count displays:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202856\n", "Q: Any way to log off or close apps when time limits run out My kids use Steam to play games on the Mac. Each kid gets half an hour through parental controls time limit feature.  However, it just locks their account and leaves the apps running.  Steam can only have one instance running at a time on a single computer, so the second kid can't play on Steam after the first kid has got logged out, without me giving the first kids account some extra time, and then closing steam.\nIs there a smarter way to do this?  If the account was logged out at the end of the alloted time, the apps would close and no longer impact on other user accounts.\n\nA: You can log out an account after so many minutes via the Security and Privacy preference:\nApple Icon > System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Advanced button and then set the Log out after minutes of inactivity to a low number. This closes all the Apps on my Mac and logs me off completely for more security.\n\n", "Q: How do I delete my notes on one device without deleting them from iCloud?

I have a Mid-2011 MacBook Air. Everything seems to be working fine, except Safari keeps freezing and stops responding. Sometimes, when Safari freezes, it causes the whole computer to crash and I have to restart it.\nI thought browsers were supposed to have security measures that prevent this from happening (like Sandboxing). How can a webpage crash the whole OS?\n\nA: My assumption solution:\nSafari is continuously attempting to reload the last session.\nTo resolve this issue go to ~/Library/Saved Application State/\nRemove the com.safari... folder and place in the Trash.\nA second issue could be adware, which created the issue in the first place. \nOpen Safari, which should operate properly after removing the above folder, and go to AdwareMedic .\nDownload and run the free program and that will remove any adware.\n", "Q: Stop Preview from opening every file in its own page Every single time I open a picture to view in preview or preview itself it opens every document in a individual page. Which must be forced quit to close?\nI have already tried going to System Preferences → General to make sure \"Close windows when quitting an app\" is unchecked. Using command-option-Q and command-option-w do not work either.\nThis happens with every single photo folder or individual picture I attempt to look at. For example, clicking on a photo in a folder opens opens 247 documents with 247 different pages?\nHow do I stop this? Can I remove Preview and use any other picture viewing option?\n\nA: You didn't say what version of OS X you're using and I don't know it Preview in different versions of OS X have different preferences however, in OS X 10.8 anyway, I went into Previews's Preferences (Preview > Preferences... > General) and changed what I assume is the default of Open groups of files in the same window, since I've never changed Previews's Preferences before now, to Open all files in one window, as shown in the image below.\nWith Open groups of files in the same window selected and when only opening one file at a time the default behavior is to open each file in its own window until it's changed to Open all files in one window.\n\n", "Q: Force Preview to use freehand mode by default How to I make Preview use freehand mode by default while I'm drawing? It seems to want to smooth everything everytime.\n\nA: By default the drawing engine in Preview can't be changed (in El Capitan or earlier) as it's a vector base drawing system. So it will always have some level of smoothing applied to it based on the algorithm Apple is using.\nYou can however turn off some of the smoothing for documents that store the drawing in vector format like PDF, but this will have a minimal effect at best for most drawings.\nIf you want to try turning off the vector smoothing under Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan.\nGo into the Preview -> Preferences... and choose the third tab PDF.\nUn-checkmark Smooth text and line art.\n\nBeyond that there isn't a way to turn off the math that drives the drawing tool in Preview.\n\nA: I recommend acrobat reader, with it I can draw free hand while annotating documents.  It is pretty standard software, that's why I prefer it over preview which only runs on mac os.\n", "Q: How do I find all files categorized movies on my disk? In the dialog of \"About this Mac\", started from below the Apple menu item, the Storage 'tab' says there are 42.43 GB of Movies.\nOk, how do I find all those files that the system categorizes as movies?\nIn other words - how did OSX find them? \nI can't find them anywhere.\nIs there a Terminal ls -al | grep [something] that I can fire off from the root folder to help me find them?\n\nA: In a Terminal, use the following command:\nmdfind \"kMDItemKind == '*movie'\"\n\nThis will output the fully qualified pathnames of files in which the metadata stores used by Spotlight classify it as some type of movie.\nExample output from a movie taken on my iPhone and transferred to iPhotos on my Mac, one of the lines outputted by mdls is:\nkMDItemKind                    = \"QuickTime movie\"\n\"QuickTime movie\", which have a .mov extension was just one of extension types that showed as \"$some_type_of movie\". So you will probably see other file extensions as well.\n\nA: An alternative to the command line is Spotlight UI itself:\na Spotlight search in Finder (cmd+F) should come up with the same results, as \"About This Mac > Storage\" did.\nIn the search criteria set \"Kind is Movie\", click the plus sign towards the right of this line and add another two criteria (found under \"Other\" in the criteria options): \"System Files are included\" and for good measure \"File Visibility Visible or Invisible\".\n\nHere these search results show the same amount of space used as given under \"Storage\" in \"About this Mac\".\n", "Q: Developing an app with an automatically renewable consumable in-app purchase I'm developing a new tvOS app that has in-app purchases. I can't get the in-app purchases to show up in the simulator. What is the proper procedure when introducing in-app purchases to apps that are not yet in the App Store? Should I go ahead and upload a build but NOT release it? Will this get the in-app purchases showing in dev so I can continue building the in-app purchase workflow? Or is there another way to get the in-app purchases approved? They are currently in the \"Ready to submit\" state.\n\nA: SKProductRequest only returns the right data when running on a device.

She had my camera, and took a lot of photos and videos. Unfortunately, the camera ran out of memory, and she was forced to get creative.\nShe used our aunt's Windows 7 PC, and, through iTunes, stored some videos and pictures on her iPad, creating a new folder for it.\nUpon getting back home, she tried to extract the pictures and videos from the iPad, but couldn't. She tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Importing it using Windows without iTunes - it's not in any of the folders.\n\n*Importing it using Windows with iTunes - it's also not in any of the folders.\n\n*She also tried it using a Mac with iTunes. She backed it up, and all the photos from the iPad did get copies on the Mac, except the folder she created.\n\n\nThe pictures cannot be edited or deleted in the iPad. She duplicated the album, and found out that the duplicated items can be edited and deleted, but still could not be found from the PC / Mac, backup or otherwise.\nAmy suggestions?\n\nA: For some reason iTunes photo sync (iOS Device -> Photos) is quite restricted regarding what you do with those photos after they are on the iOS device. Even Apple specifically says that you can't sync those photos from your iOS device to your computer.\nAs a result, I suggest trying iExplorer to copy the photos from the iPad to your computer.\nIf you had AirDrop on both devices, you could use that to transfer the pictures, but it would be a little painstaking as you would have to tap every picture to transfer.\n", "Q: Does Apple have to provide authorisation for the iPhone NFC to be used as a transport Smart Card? My understanding is that it is possible to use the iPhone for payments on 'the underground' in London as a replacement for the Oyster card. Also that the NFC chip is used in this. \nThe potential exists to use this system in other Smart Card transport systems in Singapore and Sydney. \nMy question is: Does Apple have to provide authorization for the iPhone NFC to be used as a transport Smart Card?\n\nA: Apple does not allow developers to interact with the internal NFC chip at this moment.\nCurrently the only extendable Apple SDK for this type of system is Wallet (formerly PassBook). If your local transport station has an option to scan barcodes you can use third party tools to add your transportation pass barcode to Wallet.\n", "Q: Can not resize disk image file .dmg I've found that OS X supports .img files which might be resized after it was created.

I also tried to use Automator, but this also exits before the program can get input.\n\nA: When you double-click a .command file, Terminal.app will open, and execute /path/to/file.command ; exit; which means it will execute the content of the file.command script, and THEN exit.\nIf your Terminal is exiting before your executable can receive input, that seems to indicate that either your .command is not calling your executable correctly, or your executable somehow doesn't wait to receive input before exiting.\nTo be able to help you further, you'd need to provide an example .c/.cpp file to compile, and the content of your .command file.\nI myself tried with a .command file that contains only:\n$HOME/Downloads/go.sh\n\nAnd I was able to ask for input in go.sh (using read -p) before the Terminal exited.\n\nA: Add a \"sleep\" command to pause the script's execution. \nSleep 5\n\nWill pause for 5 seconds.\n", "Q: Lock down a device address in AirPort Utility?

Is it fundamentally impossible to have a passive (NOT the expensive USB-powered active ones) thunderbolt/mini-displayport to dual-link-DVI or HDMI adapter that can support 2560x1440 external monitor?\n\nA: Not only is this not impossible, but products that do this exist. DisplayPort (and therefore mini-displayport and thunderbolt) supports DVI and HDMI output over passive adapters using Dual-mode DisplayPort.  Dual-mode DisplayPort only supports single-link DVI or HDMI. Single-link DVI is limited to 1900x1200, but single-link HDMI can go up to 2560x1600@60Hz with HDMI 1.3+, and bigger on new HDMI versions.

Im currently evaluating using Apple Remote Desktop for multi laptop and desktop management. Can it also be used for iOS device management ?\nWe've got a range of devices - iPhone, iPads which are company owned. As well as staff who have their own iPhones which we install email, and specific business apps for them to use.\nIts very tedious having to manually type all of the usernames and passwords into each device and app to get them setup is there a way i can do this from my desktop via Apple Remote Desktop or something similar ?\n\nUPDATE Dec 18\nNow that iOS 12 allows 3rd party remote management software like Bomgar and Teamviewer (see article here) of iOS devices. (All be it view only, with no control)\nDose Apple Remote Desktop now offer the similar functionality including control ? \n\nA: Unfortunately Apple Remote Desktop does not support managing iOS devices at this time. The closest parallel would be Apple Configurator 2 which targets iOS automation in a similar manner to Remote Desktop.\nI suggest investigating MDM solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Profile Manager in Apple's OS X Server app\n\n*Casper Suite or Bushel by JAMF Software\n\n\nThese three options run either on any Mac you have or can be hosted in the cloud.\n\nA: We use Apple Configurator to supervise iOS devices and then Meraki MDM to remotely manage them.  We push out a webclip and a global HTTP proxy setting to all devices this way.  Meraki MDM is free for up to 100 clients, after that you have to pay per client up to and including the first 100.  We were using the Apple OS X server app for awhile and while it does have some great features it is severely lacking in some key areas.  You get what you pay for.\n\nA: Right now it is still not supported. The App hasn’t been updated in a year so I doubt support will be added as is it going a bit out of date.\nApple has some software for remote control mainly designed for education though:\nhttps://www.apple.com/education/it/\nWhile not the best solution it does offer Apple ID and iCloud control:\n\nManaged Apple IDs are created automatically when you connect Apple School Manager to your school’s roster data, and they give students access to iCloud Drive, iCloud Photo Library, Backup, Schoolwork, and Shared iPad. If you’re not using these services you can deploy iPad and Mac computers without an Apple ID. Students simply turn on the device and get to work, no sign-in required. If your school’s needs change, you can create Managed Apple IDs and distribute them to students later.\n\nAn alternative would be to use TeamViewer. \nIt can be downloaded here:\nhttps://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/mac-os/\nThis allows remote desktop control which can help enter passwords.\nI don’t think you will get anywhere with Apple Remote Desktop Management though.\n\nA: No, Apple Configurator is Apple's solution for iOS management whereas Apple Remote Desktop is focused only on macOS clients. Server.app as well has profile manager for basic MDM functionality using the Apple Push Notification service. Even if your business / school has a few devices, reach out to Apple sales for help selecting an MDM whether you purchase the MDM Apple sells (JAMF Now / JAMF Now Plus or School / JAMF Pro) or MDM Apple purchased outright (https://www.fleetsmith.com) they will help you select and evaluate an over the air solution to manage iOS if you don't want tethered management like Ground Control and Apple Configurator 2 offer.\n", "Q: Is Apple Remote Desktop safe / secure? I manage 6 devices: (2x MBPs, 2x Mac Minis, 2x MB), devices are a mix of 10.8 and 10.10. Adding or updating software on each computer has become tedious and I've been recommended to use Apple Remote Desktop.\nIdeally I'd like to be able to use Apple Remote Desktop to manage the devices at our office which are on the same network, but also be able to connect to laptops when they are out of the office in case I need to share the screen etc.\nMy only concern is, is Apple Remote Desktop safe / secure? - Is there a danger of someone else being able to access the machines via Apple Remote Desktop?\n\nA: In general, for remote connections, I would recommend setting up a VPN server on your office network, which would allow access to insecure services (such as VNC, known by Apple as Remote Desktop), without fear of those services getting hacked remotely. Regardless of how secure VNC is (which it isn't), in general it's a good idea to have as few points of entry as possible. A VPN provides this.\n\nA: You are only as secure as your ability to secure your credentials and network for any well designed remote log in solution.\n\n*\n\n*ARD is not insecure like telnet or ftp are.\n\n*ARD is secured similar to ssh or TLS.\n\nDisabling access is always more secure, but we don’t power off our devices generally to make them more secure in most threat models.\n", "Q: How can I add CC and BCC fields in Gmail app?

As disks have failed over the years, some of them have had to be renamed, and they show up with their new names on the MacMini if I screenshare to it. But my MacBook Air still shows them when I connect to the MacMini for filesharing with their old names. Restarting, cleaning system cache, trashing logs, and trashing Finder plist have not corrected this. If I bring in a new computer that has never before connected to the MacMini it will show the old names too, so I assume this means the problem is on the MacMini, not on the machine accessing it. Recently, I added an iMac to the network to keep connected to my film scanners. I'm having the same problem with it's hard drive name. I changed it from its original name to iMac HD, but the original name still shows up for sharing the disk on other machines. It's confusing to have a network where all drives are called Macintosh HD, so I want the name change to show up across the network.\nIs there a fix for this?\n\nA: I have found a fix, but I'm not sure what it did to correct the naming issue. While I was researching it I came across the method of connecting to a server by making a bookmark in a browser address bar. In the address bar I typed:\nafp://user:password@IPaddressonLAN/iMac%20HD\nwith the proper username and password for my account on the iMac, the IP address for theIMac, and a %20 in place of the space in the disk's name, iMac HD. Then I selected it and dragged it to the desktop and double-clicking it mounts the desired disk with its new name. And best of all, now if I click on the iMac in the sidebar of a Finder window, it shows the disk as being called iMac HD instead of the old name.\nI don't know what this has updated or where, but I'm not complaining if it works! It must have changed something on the iMac, not on my MBA. I say this because I checked with the computer that has never been connected to the iMac - when I posted my question I noted it also showed the old disk name (having never been connected to it at all under that name), and now it shows the new name for the disk. Something has been updated on the iMac itself has to be the explanation.\n", "Q: Where does OS X keep the FileVault password during reboots in an upgrade? For security concerns, I wonder how it would be possible for an OS X upgrade (e.g. from Mavericks to El Capitan), to reboot my Mac multiple times without asking me for my FileVault 2 password? \nI mean, the whole drive is encrypted and even an OS X installer would not know the password after a reboot. In spite of that, it reboots one or more times without asking me for my password.\nTherefore I suspect that Apple stores my password somewhere, either on disk, in NVRAM, or online, at least during the upgrade process. If so, wouldn't this be a serious security concern? \nCan anyone shed a bit of light on this? How does it work?\n\nA: There's an OS X feature called authenticated restart that stores the FileVault key in the SMC for the duration of the reboot. Apple acknowledges in the manpage that it does reduce FileVault security for the duration of the restart:\n\nOn supported hardware, fdesetup allows restart of a FileVault-enabled system without requiring unlock during the subsequent boot using the authrestart command.\nWARNING: FileVault protections are reduced during authenticated restarts.\nIn particular, fdesetup deliberately stores at least one additional copy of a permanent FDE (full disk encryption) unlock key in both system memory and (on supported systems) the System Management Controller (SMC).  fdesetup must be run as root and itself prompts for a password to unlock the FileVault root volume.  Use pmset destroyfvkeyonstandby to prevent saving the key across standby modes. Once authrestart is authenticated, it launches reboot(8) and, upon successful unlock, the unlock key will be removed.\n\n", "Q: Switching from shared Apple ID to Family Sharing - will we lose app data? I've been sharing my Apple ID (I'll call it A) details with my wife for many years, in order to share app purchases.\nWe'd now like to switch to Family Sharing.  My Apple ID A would be the \"family organizer\".\nAfter setting up Family Sharing, my wife would set up her iPhone (in Settings > iTunes & App Store > Apple ID) to use her own Apple ID (\"B\").  This ID currently has no purchases.\nWhat will happen to her existing apps, some of which have saved local data?\nReading around a bit, perhaps we'll run into this sequence of problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*The existing apps might still be marked as \"purchased by\" A.  If my wife wants to update them, she'd need to enter the A credentials (source)... I guess this is OK, but not ideal.\n\n*To fix that, perhaps we could delete the offending app and then re-purchase it using her account B (which is now linked to A via Family Sharing).  Updating it then requires her B credentials, which is fine.\n\n*But then presumably we'll find that the app's saved local data has been deleted by the reinstall.  Perhaps we could then use iMazing to restore the app data from an earlier backup (source).\nHave I understood this correctly?\n\nA: I also shared my Apple ID with my wife for app purchases, and found the transition to Family Sharing painless. This Apple support page goes into details, and I'll answer some of your specific questions below. \nWhat will happen to her existing apps, some of which have saved local data?\nMost likely your wife's iPhone is set up so that iCloud (Settings > iCloud) is using B's Apple ID, and iTunes & App Store (Settings > iTunes & App Store) is set up with A's Apple ID. This makes the transition easy, but just in case please make a full encrypted backup with iTunes. \nOn your wife's iPhone, go to Settings > iTunes & App Store > Apple ID and click \"Sign Out\", reboot the iPhone, and then sign in with your B's Apple ID. A should then create the family group and invite B to the group. \nThe existing apps might still be marked as \"purchased by\" A. If my wife wants to update them, she'd need to enter the A credentials\nThe linked answer describes how app authentication works when there are apps purchased under multiple Apple IDs on the same device. The authentication process for Family Sharing works differently. \nUnder Family Sharing, account B's credentials will be valid for purchases shared by other family members if she has been flagged as a Parent/Guardian by the Family Organizer. This includes apps, music, movies, and iBooks. To download apps made by other members, open the store app that you want to download content from, and go to the purchased page. On iOS devices this is located at: \nApp Store: Tap Updates > Purchased.\niTunes Store: Tap More > Purchased.\niBooks: Tap Purchased.  \nThe only time that a purchase needs to be authenticated is when a child that has be set as \"Ask to Buy\" tries to make a purchase. \n", "Q: Exception to smart quote substitution for one word I have System Preferences|Keyboard enabled for smart quotes. Unfortunately, this tends to turn Hawai‘i into Hawai’i even when I use Option–]. Any suggestion how to get one word the way I want? (Not interested in global disable of smart quotes.)\n\nA: The most correct character for the Hawaiian ʻokina is U+02BB, Modifier Letter Turned Comma.

When I clicked on \"empty trash\", it gave me the message that the file was being used. I didn't know what was using it, and didn't want to cause problems, so I used lsof | grep /Users/myusername/.Trash and found that the QuickLook process had it open 12 times! Should I delete the file? Why on earth does Quick Look have it open at all?\nPS: I quick-looked the file again and ran lsof | grep -c /Users/myusername/.Trash, which told me that it was then open 18 times, in case that helps.\n\nA: Try running qlmanage -r. This should reload QuickLook and make it so it's no longer focused on those files. You can also try using something like Trash It! if after restarting and relaunching/killing Finder and QuickLook does nothing.\n", "Q: Recovering iPhone camera roll from iMac Today I upgraded from an iPhone 5s to an iPhone 6s via the Verizon store.

The Camera Roll folder and all album folders are there.  They contain blank photos.  When I click on a photo it displays a blank frame, but the correct photo date.\nAll the iPhone photos are on my iMac.  So then I wonder if there's any easy way I can transfer the photos from the iMac to the iPhone. The Camera Roll contains 1,667 photos so I am really hoping i don't have to do this on a photo-by-photo basis.  Also, a photo may be in more than one album based on who was in the photo.  Also, the iPhone photos were not stored in iCloud.  Help!\n\nA: The clerk at the Verizon store was an idiot.\nGetting your stuff from the old iPhone to the new is simple but not automatic.\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your old iPhone to your computer (encrypt the backup so it saves passwords)\n\n*Plug your new unused iPhone into your computer and when prompted by iTunes restore from backup. Use the backup you just made from your old iPhone.\n\n\nThat will do it. It is important to NOT set up the new iPhone before you plug it into your computer. iTunes will recognize a \"virgin\" iPhone and ask you what you want to do.\nYou should be able to set up Photos and iTunes to sync what you want from your Mac to your new phone.

I went onto Google on my computer and iPhone \"wifi connected but no internet acess iPad\" because I can't find the answer I need and most of the answers I don't understand. I'm only 13 years old in 8th grade jr high so I don't understand anything about stuff like DHCP or BootP or Static and how they work and I don't know what is DNS and such. I don't know exacty what resetting my network settings does and what I've read about network settings reset gets rid of stuff like VPN or MMS or APN. I'm trying to find something easy for me to understand and something helpful but not complicated that you need to be a professional coder or something to understand. \nMy regular iPad my family and I use, my computer (which isn't Apple) and my iPhone work perfectly fine with wifi. (Well, my iphone is new and I literally just got it yesterday and it's my first phone ever so of course no problems yet.)

Just because your iPad has a good connection to the wifi router in your house doesn't ensure you connectivity of internet. If that works then quit all tabs in safari and physically close the safari app. Restart and try again. Sometimes the link in safari expires or has some error. Try any popular website.\nIf on the other hand at that very moment your alternate device, be it your pc or phone is connected on same wifi network and the page is loading then it's evidently a problem with your iPad wifi card. Quit all apps manually, reboot your iPad, delete saved networks and restart your iPad. Try again if that too fails contact apple care for a hardware fix.\n", "Q: How to put Wifi card in monitor mode?

If it is truly not working, you can delete the partition, download the latest OS X installer from the App Store and then reinstall OS X (this will not delete your files, think of it just like an OS X update). As part of the OS X reinstall, it will add a fresh new recovery partition.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Solved (for my particular situation anyway): I was suspicious that my machine (2009 Mac Pro) wouldn't recognize the keyboard through an external monitor. So I pulled the USB from my monitor, plugged it directly into the desktop, and lo-and-behold, Command+r allowed the machine to boot into recovery mode.\n\nA: I ran into this same issue.

Since a few days I have an Apple Watch and I really like it. I just wanted to know if I could use my watch in airplane mode all day, and at the end of the day I connect it to my iPhone to let all my health data sync. Is this possible?\nHow long does my watch collect data when it isn't connected to my iPhone? Today I woke up very early in the morning and I put on my watch (in airplane mode). A few hours later, I disabled airplane mode and all my health data from the last few hours (e.g. heart rate) was synced immediately to my iPhone. Does that even work when my watch is in airplane mode the whole day? \n\nA: I imagine the WATCH will keep as much data as its onboard storage will allow, which is several gigabytes. So, caching Health data really shouldn’t be an issue for most intents and purposes.\nSince the title of the question is about the disadvantages of Airplane mode, know that placing your WATCH in airplane mode will preclude you from connecting to the Internet. Therefore, any feature that requires an active Internet connection will not work. Siri comes to mind.\nFinally, since the Bluetooth antenna is also disabled, you will be unable to connect a set of Bluetooth headphones, or an external heart rate monitor. Any app that requires an iPhone connection will not work either, meaning all watchOS 1 apps, as well as many, if not most, watchOS 2 apps. GPS via your iPhone will also cease to function.\nEnabling Airplane mode thus disables most of the features of your WATCH. On the other hand, there aren’t too many advantages to enabling it. You might see some gains in battery life, though most of that will come from not being able to use your WATCH for a whole lot of things. But if you weren’t using your WATCH a lot to begin with (outside of activity tracking), then battery life is more than adequate to last you an entire day.\nEven if you are on a marathon hiking trip, you will defeat much of the purpose of tracking that workout anyway, since the lack of GPS will result in less accurate distance measurements. In that situation, it would be preferable to turn on Power Saving Mode under Apple Watch → Workout.\n", "Q: How to perform FileVault authenticated restart when updating OSX from AppStore? I am aware of the authenticated restart when using FileVault 2 on OS X. Running the fdesetup authrestart command does however restart the system immediately.\nNow, when running the OS X Update from the App Store (which often requires restarting the system) the update process reboots the system automatically at \"its own convenience\". It prompts about the restart requirement before starting the whole update process and there is no \"you should reboot now\"-point in time.\nIs there any way to \"combine\" OS X Update from the App Store with authenticated restart so that a remote system with system drive would not require manual drive unlocking from the console?\n\nA: It sounds like you want the next restart, whenever it might occur, to skip FileVault authorization. You can use the -delayminutes option with a value of -1 for this.\nFrom the fdesetup man page:\n\nauthrestart [-inputplist] [-delayminutes number_of_minutes_to_delay] [-verbose]\n\nIf FileVault is enabled on the current volume, it restarts the system, bypassing the initial unlock.   The optional -delayminutes option can be used to delay the restart command for a set number of minutes.  A value of 0 represents 'immediately', and a value of -1 represents 'never'.  The command may not work on all systems.\n\nTry running the following command before the system update:\nsudo fdesetup authrestart -delayminutes -1\n\n", "Q: Some native keyboard accent shortcuts not working since OS X 10.11.3 Update I have a Qwerty keyboard on my MacBook Pro late-2015, set to the standard US layout, that I sometime use to write French accentuated characters. \nHowever, since the last OS X update, some accent shortcuts are not working anymore. More specifically, Option6 (+ some vowel), which used to produce circumflex accents now writes §, and Optionc, used for c cedilla, is now used for capitalising the last written word. I can still write these characters using the press and hold method, but it's pretty inefficient.\nHow can I re-enable these accent shortcuts?\n\nA: Go to system preferences/keyboard/input sources and make sure that only the item called \"US International PC\" is on the list, or the item called \"ABC Extended\" (known as \"US Extended\" prior to OS X 10.11).\n(The standard US layout does not use Option 6 for circumflex, it uses Option i. The US International PC layout uses Shift 6, while ABC Extended uses Option 6. I suspect you were using one of these layouts rather than \"US\".)\n\nA: The standard US keyboard layout always yields a § if alt6 is pressed.\nTo get your desired results enable the US extended (or ABC Extended in OS X 10.11) keyboard layout:\n\n\n*\n\n*alt6 -> ˆ\n\n*alt6+e -> ê\n\n*altc+c -> ç\n\nA: I realise that you probablyuse the command shortcuts for increased speed, but it may be helpful to you (and others) to consider the slightly longer method of holding down a character until the \"pop up\" choice list appears.  For example, holding down c or e on my (British English) system yields:\n\n\nThis has the added benefit that the list can be customised to a certain extent (if you are happy messing with the plist files)\n", "Q: App is greyed out What does it mean when an app is greyed out like this?

So there is not really any problem. I am just kind of curious as to why it is greyed out.\nI'm running OS X 10.10.1.\n\n\nA: Generally, if something is greyed out, it's unavailable, and a common reason is often that the file is being copied/part downloaded etc.  Scroll over to the right and check the file size of the item, and if the progress bar is present indicating a copy is happening.\n\n", "Q: Apps \"cannot be opened because of a problem\" Whenever I am trying to open an app, most of them won't open with the error as below.\n\n\n\nI am really helpless here.

In each case it seems to be isolated to one area of the screen, though I'm not sure of that.\nWhat could be causing this, and/or what are the right keywords to research it online?  Searching for video and split was not helpful at all. :)\n\nA: You already installed the official drivers\nnVidia to see if this problem is solved?\nis a two graphical cards Nvidia GT120?\nlook here: http://www.geforce.com/drivers\n", "Q: iPhone 6s question in reference to my iPad If I sync my messages to my iPad will I get an alert on my iPhone? \nAnd if I delete messeges on my iPad will it delete the same messages on my iPhone?\n\nA: If you sync both iPad and iPhone you will receive alerts in both the devices. While, deleting messages and conversations has to be done on each individual device separately so deleting is not synchronised.\n", "Q: Can not access samba file share I have activated file sharing for my public folder. I have network connectivity within my private local LAN and Internet Access. My router does not support IPv6.\nWhen someone tries to connect from another mac with my shared folder, the login procedure is incredibly slow. I have tried to use the domain name and the ip-address without success.\nToday I have learned about the mac tool smbutil and tried it for my own PC using smbutil view -g //hostname but I took very long and then the procedure failed.\nI cannot \n\n\n*\n\n*find any logs (what does apple do with logs???)\n\n*turn on smbd debug level\n\n*find any clue to solve the problem in the Internet.\n\n\nCan someone help me?\ng\n\nA: I like using WireShark to do a packet capture. Wireshark can highlight the SMB traffic and allow you to see if the packets are flowing well. You can also analyze the SMB transactions. This is helpful because you can compare a Windows client and a macOS client to the same appliance with the same tool on the same network and see what the difference is.\nYou probably are negotiating the connection differently or may need the server logs to analyze what's happening not the client logs.\n", "Q: Apple Mail: Only TLS v1.0 supported on macOS 10.11 I'm on OS X 10.11.3, aka El Capitan.\nI can't connect to mail servers running only TLS version 1.2 or 1.1 with Apple Mail.\nIMAP as well as SMTP connections are always established using TLS 1.0.\nCould that be correct?\nIf so, why doesn't Apple Mail support TLS 1.2 yet?\n\nA: This seems to be an issue with MacOS El Capitan and lower versions.  Upgrades to Sierra and High Sierra resolve the issue.  \nHowever, there needs to be a solution for users on computers which cannot upgrade to Sierra and higher.\n\nA: As much as I don't really want to move all of my mail to Thunderbird.  I have found that it does work on El Capitan.\n", "Q: How do I open an iOS app that I transferred to my Mac? I downloaded an app on my phone and transferred it to my MacBook Pro and I got a file of the app. Whenever I click on it, it says the app already exists in my iTunes library and do I want to replace it. How do I open the app so I can use it?\n\nA: The iPhone (and other mobile devices) run iOS, which is a different operating system to OSX which is the desktop operating system for your Macbook.  Any purchases you make and download on your phone are only able to run on your phone (or other iOS device, potentially).  While you can transfer them to your Mac (Transfer Purchases in iTunes) this is intended for backup purposes, not to allow you to run it on the Mac.\nSlightly confusingly, the App Store on your phone, has a similar equivalent for desktop Macs call the Mac App Store, but the contents are different - even for an app that is available in both, they will be 2 different apps for each operating system and require 2 separate purchases.\nThe fact that it already exists, is probably because you have got the setting set to automatically download purchased items from the iOS App Store onto your Mac for backup - this is often a pointless step, as you can always re-download for free directly from the (either) App Store anyway, but for large downloads like games I suppose it can decrease the time needed to re-install depending on your circumstances.\n\nA: I think there is a misunderstanding here. An iOS app (from your iPhone) cannot run on your MacBook Pro.\nIf you want to use a similar app on your Mac, I suggest you check if there is a Mac version of the application you want to use. You can search on the Mac App Store or on the app website.\n\nA: You can open, and so use, the app from your iPhone. While from your MacBook Pro you can only keep store the app in the iTunes library and update it when a new version is available. \n\nA: Apple doesn't (yet) support running iOS apps on a Mac.\nThis feature may be coming in the future however -- their bitcode technology would allow it.\nIt could be a very useful feature...\n", "Q: How can I send saved library videos through Snapchat? For pictures I can see the share option to send it through snapchat, but I can't seem to find it for videos.\nI want to be able to record a video using the phones default camera app and then send it to a friend on Snapchat. Since the video is likely to be longer than 10 seconds if it would send multiple videos of 10 seconds each that would be ideal.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: Snapchat now has the desired capability of sending videos from the camera roll in 10 second chunks.\nHead to Memories by clicking the circle (now “cards” in 2018) on the bottom center of the screen (or swiping up) on the camera screen and then go to camera roll section on top and long press the video you want and press the blue arrow to share it.\n\nA: Sorry, you can't send videos through Snapchat. In the photos app, if you select a photo a share button will pop up(box with arrow). It will give you a myriad of options to send your photo/video. If you've selected a photo, it gives you a Snapchat option. If you select a video, there is no Snapchat. Seems like Snapchat forces you to use their camera for videos.\n", "Q: Finding Music folder after updating with OS X EI Capitan We are having trouble locating iTunes music folder. Prior to updating with OS X EI Capitan, we could easily find the music folder in the Finder sidebar, but now we don't know how to get it back with all our music, media, etc.\n\nA: All the iTunes content is inside the directory: ~/Music/iTunes more precisely: /Users/<your_user_name>/Music/iTunes. \nYou can use special application tool like DaisyDisk to locate some particular content inside your Mac computer.\n\nA: The Sidebar is just a handy place to find stuff. If an item has been removed from the Sidebar, it is easily put back by dragging its icon from its source location on the drive. In your case, open the /Users/your_user_name folder from the HD and drag the Music icon into the Sidebar.\nThis Support Document at Apple may help in greater detail.\n\nA: Music is a default folder under FAVORITES on the Sidebar of Finder and you should be able to select it and then see your iTunes Folder.  If the Sidebar isn't shown, click Finder > View > Show Sidebar. If Music isn't in Finder's Sidebar then go to the menu bar Finder > Preferences... > Sidebar and click the checkbox by Music to have it appear in the Sidebar.\nIf the iTunes folder isn't in the Music folder, then in Spotlight type iTunes and see if it shows as a folder under FOLDERS.\nOr in a Terminal use the following command to locate folders named \"iTunes\":\nmdfind 'kMDItemFSName == \"iTunes\"'\n\nIt will probably output more then one \"iTunes\" folder as there are also, e.g., /Library/Documentation/Applications/iTunes, /Users/$USER/Music/iTunes, /Library/iTunes etc., however one of the pathnames generated should contain your music.\n\nA: It sounds like the sidebar preferences got reset when you upgraded to El Capitan. If that is all that is going on, it should be simple to fix. The sidebar is just a list of shortcuts to where the folders actually are, so we just need to put the shortcut back. First, make sure that Finder is the application that you are working in, either by clicking the Finder face in the dock or clicking anywhere on your desktop. \n\nThen, click on the word Finder at the top of your computer next to the  symbol, then click Preferences. In Preferences there is a button that says Sidebar. Click that, then make sure the box next to Music is checked. \nAlternatively, you can click on the word Go in the menu bar, and then select Home in the menu that comes up.\n\nThis will show you your Home folder, which contains your Music folder. From there you can simply drag the folder to the sidebar under Favorites and it will be back where your used to seeing it, or you can just open it to go inside the folder as usual.\n", "Q: Antivirus for OS X 10.6.8 I have a laptop with OS X 10.6.8, and it needs anti-virus. I went to the App Store, but everything wants 10.7 and later. I need a software recommendation. \n\nA: I don't think you NEED an antivirus (In 25 years I have never used one and never had a virus). I do have the free ClamXav which I use to scan external disks before mounting on my Mac.\n\nA: One known Antivirus app still running on Mac OS X 10.6.8 is Avast Antivirus 2015 for Mac. Download link (almost direct link Avast).\n", "Q: Can't copy text from iBooks? Using The Swift Programming Language 2.2 from iBooks, i can't seem to copy the text (many lines of code from inside the book) to then test. \nDoes anybody know why this is happening? In the past I have been able to copy the text from the book however now it is not letting me (it's greyed out).\nFor example\n\nHere is another example of what I mean. \n\n\nA: Below are steps for copying text from iBooks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Highlight the passages you wish to copy.\n\n*A popup will be opened automatically or you must open a popup using a right click on selected passages.\n\n*Select the 'Add Note' option from the popup.\n\n*The selected/highlighted text will be shown on the left pane.\n\n*Right click on the passages in the left panel and select the 'Copy' option.\n\n\nI have created a video to show how it works: https://youtu.be/ZQLl_Gl9TMw\nHappy coding!\n\nA: I was unable to copy code from a sample eBook that I'd downloaded from the iBook store.\nAfter purchasing the book, the copy feature worked.\nPerhaps this is the source of the reproducibility error.\n\nA: Highlight the passages you wish to copy. \nThen go into the show notes area by clicking the show notes icon in the toolbar. \nSelect the passages you want to copy. Go to edit > copy.\n\nA: As of January 2018 this is the easiest workaround I've found on iPhone:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the text you wish to copy,\n\n*Choose Search from popover\n\n\n*\n\n*The text you want is in the search field at the top of the search results screen\n\n\n*Long tap in the search field to open the text selection popover\n\n*Choose Select All\n\n*Choose Copy\n\nA: A workaround is to get content from the website.\nhttps://docs.swift.org/swift-book/\n\nA: The only way I found is to use more -> search web and to copy that text from Google search bar.\n\nA: I believe this may be a copyright issue.\nIt might have been kindle – I can't remember – but I recall trying to listen to a book using text to speech a while back. At this time, text to speech copied the text to the clipboard. I eventually hit a wall where I couldn't copy text anymore. I believe there may be a limit to how much you're allowed to copy.\nHere's an older article talking about this. Granted, this article is old and may be outdated. \nSolutions? You need to be careful to research the legality of this, but you might be able to use OCR software to copy stuff – this isn't legal advice, so you need to figure this out yourself.\n\nA: To copy on iOS or iPadOS, you need to follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Tap and hold the first word, until the selection shows up.\nWaiting less than that causes the text to be highlighted instead, which is not what we want.\n\n\n*Drag the finger until you select the entire text that you want to copy.\nAs of writing this answer (2022-02-18), there is a limit of 100 characters when searching, so you need to do this multiple times for longer texts.\n\n\n*Tap the selection.\n\n\n*Tap the Search button.\n\n\n*Tap the search field.\n\n\n*Triple-tap the text.\n\n\n*Tap the Cut or Copy button.\n", "Q: How to kill Apple magic trackpad/keyboard connection messages Whenever I take my laptop away from my desk (to type on the couch), OSX goes crazy letting me know that my Apple keyboard is connected, now disconnected, now connected, now disconnected...  The message appears in an obtrusive grey box right in the middle of the screen.  I never want to see that box again.  Simply disabling bluetooth is not an option.\n\nA: If you use the bluetooth menu item, disconnect from any devices that you don't want to show the message.\nYou could also automate that UI control with Automator. Open that and then make an automation action that uses the \"Watch Me Do\" tool to record the things you select.\nThat way you could assign a keyboard shortcut to have both devices disconnect and another to reconnect them when you wish.\nMaybe someone else knows how to kneecap the messages, but this would work with what I know.\n", "Q: Dell monitor does not run on native resolution of 1600x900 pixel when connected to early macbook pro retina 2015 via thunderbolt just a few hours ago I got 2 dell E2015HV monitors, they are VGA monitors with a native resolution of 1600x900 pixel and since the macbook pro retina does not have any VGA ports I'm using two VGA to thunderbolt converters to connect the two displays to the computer to make them an extended display, but for some reason none of the displays want to run on their native resolution, and when I option + click on the scaled display setting from display preferences I see a list of custom resolutions but not one of them are the monitor's native resolution of 1600x900 pixel, as a matter of fact none of the resolutions listed in the list box even begin with the number 1600. So, the question now is that is there anything I can do to make them run on their native resolution? Thanks!\n\nA: There is nothing wrong with your monitors, neither your Mac. That's a compatibility issue with your adapter. There are many comments on Amazon complaining about the same issue on similar converters. That seems, unfortunately, a hardware fault.\nExample: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/cr/B00NH13I08/ref=mw_dp_cr\n", "Q: Home wifi wastage for nothing My internet broadband package at home is limited to a volume of 40GB.

Just curious if every time I press that X, it means I'll never hear a song. Some songs just aren't right for a station, but it doesn't mean I hate the song. Curious if it bans that song forever from all my stations or just one.\n\nA: I believe the \"Never Play This Song\" applies to just the one station. \nApple clarifies this in their page for Apple Music Radio - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204944\n\"While listening to your custom station in Apple Music Radio, tap or click the star icon star icon to fine-tune your station.

I connected to computer to upload some but it didn't ask me if I wanted to remove any from my phone.\n\nA: It's not entirely clear, but I'll take a guess.\nIf you connect the phone to a computer and no photos are removed when you sync, the most likely setup is the iPhone is using iCloud Photo Library.\nYou would turn that off in the settings app - iCloud.\nThen once the library is off - choose whether you want the phone to participate in Photo Stream / Photo Sharing or not.\nAt that point, once iCloud Photo Library is off - you can delete photos from the phone manually on the iOS itself or by connecting to iTunes / Image Capture app / Photos app on Mac / iPhoto on Mac and transferring / deleting photos en masse.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to delete all photos in the camera roll in iOS 8.x?\n\n*Understanding Photo Stream\n", "Q: OS X 10.11 Not able to change the folder permission I have root permission but still I am not able to change the folder permission \nsudo chmod  -R 777 /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/\nchmod: Unable to change file mode on /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/: Operation not permitted\n\nBut at the same time I am able to do \nsudo chmod -R 777  /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/\n\nSystem details:\nProductName:    Mac OS X\nProductVersion: 10.11.2\nBuildVersion:   15C50\nCould anybody help in identifying the issue?\n\nA: Some of the root folders (e.g. /sbin /bin) as well as some application bundles (i.e. Apple apps) are protected by System Integrity Protection even if logged in as root or using sudo.\nIf you want to make changes to protected items disable SIP, apply the changes and reenable it.\n", "Q: IPhone 6s Plus why an external camera like FLiR no longer charges the phone after interaction dialog? I got an external camera attachment for iPhone and it has an external power input.

Get a wooden or plastic toothpick (do not use anything metallic) and clean the port out, swiping from one edge to the other, then pulling out any bunched up lint or dust. Even a small amount of buildup will prevent the accessory from fully seating properly, sometimes generating a \"This accessory is not supported\" error, or simply preventing the device from charging, even when it has worked properly before.\n", "Q: Sync apple messages between devices I'm a novice user FYI. My messages used to be synced so that the conversation kept going on iMac iPhone and iPad mini. Then perhaps after a trip to Alaska it stopped doing that. I'm not 100% sure if that's when it stopped. I've noticed that my iBooks content syncs between phone and iPad but not iMessages. This is very inconvenient. All three, actually I have 2 iMacs so 4 devices are with same Apple ID. THANKS!\n\nA: Check if you have the devices under settings/messages/text messages forwarding, and enable all the devices you want to recieve/send messages from. Even if you already enabled it previously, you might of renamed the device, just check if the device with exact name is enabled. \n\nA: All syncing of messages is done with your iCloud account. First check the iCloud settings on the working devices and then compare them to the settings on the non-working device. If they are the same you could try removing and re-adding the account.\nNote that Messages on iPad is only going to show you conversations with other IOS devices. So if you are texting with someone on a non-IOS device (say Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, etc.) and the text bubble is green then it won't show up on the iPad (I believe).\n", "Q: iTunes: subscribe to a podcast without downloading it?

If so, I believe the Creative Cloud installs an \"extension\" to the Finder that has something to do with their Core Sync feature (not entirely sure what that is). Notice that I put the word \"extension\" in quotation marks, as the way Adobe achieves this is pure evil: by injecting the code into the Finder process, which can and will alter the way the Finder behaves. Like you, I found that it can bog down the Finder after a while.\nI haven't found a permanent solution but this is the procedure I follow upon startup (it should last until the next restart).\n\n\n*\n\n*When the Adobe Creative Cloud menu extra appears at the top right of the screen (next to volume, date, etc.), choose to quit out of Creative Cloud.\n\n*Open Activity Monitor, and locate the following background processes:\nCreative Cloud.app (if present), Adobe Desktop Service.app, Core Sync.app, and AdobeIPCBroker.app*.\n\n*Use Activity Monitor to quit the processes in the following order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Creative Cloud.app (if it's running)\n\n*Adobe Desktop Service.app\n\n*Core Sync.app\n\n*AdobeIPCBroker.app\nIf you don't follow that order, some of them may be relaunched automatically.\n\n*Then quit and relaunch the Finder.\n*The full paths to these apps are /Applications/Utilities/Adobe Creative Cloud/ACC/Creative Cloud.app, /Library/Application Support/Adobe/Adobe Desktop Common/ADS/Adobe Desktop Service.app, /Applications/Utilities/Adobe Creative Cloud/CoreSync/Core Sync.app, and /Applications/Utilities/Adobe Application Manager/IPC/AdobeIPCBroker.app\n", "Q: Lost PDFs from iBooks on ipad I have just replaced my iPad as the old one was irreparably damaged, I had a lot of PDFs on iBooks is there any way to get them back, I think they were saved under my email address.

From a systems perspective - the network is so slow compared to storage, CPU, memory - that any attempt to hobble that subsystem is really a poor use of the computer.\nYou would need to have traffic shaping tools on the router or connect the Mac to the router using a slower interface if that would help.\nThe easy solution is to pause the download until you can allow the download to take what bandwidth it negotiates with your router and the Apple servers providing the download.\n", "Q: Unable to install with admin I am trying to update MAMP MySQL from this link, but when i double click the file as mentioned in the blog.

It seems like the only option I have at the moment. \nAny input would be much appreciated as to whether this is the software I need. \n\nA: Accordingly with the link here you have to download and install this software: Mac OS X 10.1 (PPD File).\nAfter the installation of the file: PPDInst.dmg, I suggest you to install the printer from the System Preferences > Printers & Scanners > (add a new printer by pressing + button) and you should not have problem for the printer's driver.\n", "Q: Xcode 7.2 support 3D Touch in Simulator? I've been out of the country for a while and trying to get caught up with everything. I didn't see it anywhere thought I'd ask here before I went to the dev forums. When I left the simulator didn't support hot keys or any way to test a 3D Touch short press and long press. Is this now supported or do you still need a capable device? \n\nA: Right now Apple haven't done the 3D touch for the iPhone Simulator yet, but on the Apple Watch Simulator it is fine. If you want to test for the 3D touch feature of your app, you need a capable iPhone to do it. Right now if you go to the Hardware menu, then there are a force touch pressure menu. It is disabled. That is the 3D touch feature that Apple might implement.\n", "Q: I brought a second hand I phone 5s tha is registered for beta updates Is it possible to go to normal updates or do I need to keep using the updates also how do I update when it wasn't done on my Apple ID \n\nA: You can use iTunes to restore the device to the last shipping OS.\nYou could also delete the beta profile and keep the same OS. There's not much preventing you from keeping the beta updates as well.\nReally - there's no downside to inheriting a device with beta other than you want to decide now before you put your data on it. You generally can't restore a new backup to an older OS.\n\nA: If you already put your data on it, and don't want to loose it. Update to the latest beta. Then when the public release comes out, update to that. Then be done with betas.\n", "Q: Can I change the button \"m\" with space bar? My space bar won't work so I want to use the m button as space bar. Is there a way to do that? Maybe with the Automator using an apples riptide or something? \n\nA: To make this work you have to use a third party tool: Karabiner.\nI propose to use one of the option keys though: usually one of both is rarely used and you can use M as normal key.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download, install and open Karabiner\n\n*Open in the menulet Karabiner -> Preferences\n\n*Enter \"Space\"\n\n\n*Enable the chosen keycode and close the window.\n\n\nA: I have used KeyRemap4MacBook with success before. (It has been renamed to Karabiner since)\nhttp://lifehacker.com/5882684/the-best-keyboard-remapper-for-mac-os-x\nThis article gives a bit of an overview on it.

The command for it is\nmongod --dbpath=\"/Users/prateek/Desktop/Mongo Database\"\n\nHow do I configure this in Mac OSX El Capitan?\nNote - I have installed MongoDB using Homebrew\n\nA: Create a file named org.mongod.user.plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents with the content:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>org.mongod.user</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>mongod</string>\n        <string>--dbpath=/Users/prateek/Desktop/Mongo Database</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThis requires that mongod is in your path.\nIf mongod is not in your path, use the whole path in the first string of the ProgramArguments array (e.g. /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.1/bin/mongod)\nIf you need stdout or stderr (which can be helpful if something fails) add the following in the dict section of the plist:\n    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n    <string>/tmp/org.mongod.user.stderr</string>\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n    <string>/tmp/org.mongod.user.stdout</string>\n\nLoad and start mongod with:\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.mongod.user.plist\nlaunchctl start org.mongod.user\n\n\nTo connect to your MongoDB database enter:\nmongo localhost\n\nAgain this requires that mongo is in your path. Otherwise use the complete path (e.g. /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.1/bin/mongo).\n", "Q: How do delete menulets added via \"Onyx\" I added some menus via Onyx and now I don't know how to get rid of them again.

In short, I basically want to run a few pieces of Windows specific software (ironically emulators) on a Mac. Instead of natively running Windows (e.g. via. Bootcamp) I was intending to go the CrossOver route as I know that all the pieces of software run via. it cleanly.\nhttps://www.codeweavers.com/products\nIn short I had a thought though, am I opening myself up to risks by emulating a Windows environment effectively (without doing the Bootcamp thing) on my clean Mac?\nI'm figuring others have done this (either via. CrossOver or Bootcamp) What are the risks?\nThanks in advance for any advice.\n\nA: Using Crossover Office to run a couple of Windows programs on your Mac usually works quite well, IF the program is specifically supported by Crossover. If it is not specifically supported it may work but some features may not, it might crash, etc.\nNot sure what you mean by \"risks.\" Though I don't use Crossover Office (or the open source that it is based on: Wine) it emulates part of the Win32 API allowing Windows programs to run outside of Windows.\nThis may be safer than running Windows in a virtual machine (Parallels or the free Virtualbox) as you don't have the whole Windows environment that may need continuous updating/patching or even it's own virus checker.\nBut generally speaking I have heard that Crossover Office is a reasonably well working app that does what it advertises with minimal issues.\n", "Q: Playing Music while recording?

You choose a song and record a video which is automatically saved to your phone. This app is great for taking dance videos, or if you just want to continue playing your music while taking a video. Price is 0.99$.\n\nA: You can also try Relish - Record, Listen, Shine\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofdy-CEDsmA\n", "Q: How to remove partition on SD card using a Mac? I got Raspbian on a SD card, and then accidentally wiped it. Now I have 2 visible partition. How do I get rid of the partition on a Mac.\n\nA: Using Terminal:\ndiskutil list\ndiskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX (X is number of disk from step 1)\nsudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/diskX bs=1000000 (X is number of disk from step 1)\nThen wait! You can press ctrl + t to see dd status.\n\nA: I'll try a short step by step method:\nOpen Terminal.\nEnter:\ndiskutil list\n\nfind the device identifier of the memory card, it will be smthg like /dev/diskX\nThe format command is:\ndiskutil eraseDisk FILESYSTEM CARDNAME DEVICEIDENTIFIER\n\nThis will reformat the disk DEVICIDENTIFIER with one partition with file system FILESYSTEM and give it the name CARDNAME. Careful, all other partitions will be removed!\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace DEVICEIDENTIFIER with the device identifier from above, e.g. /dev/disk3 or whatever your disknumber is.\n\n*Replace CARDNAME with the name you want to give your memory card\n\n*Replace FILESYSTEM with your desired filesystem identifier. You can get a list of available filesystems with:\ndiskutil listFilesystems\nso as an example: diskutil eraseDisk FAT32 MYCARD /dev/disk3 -> formats the memory card /dev/disk3 as a single partition FAT32 card named \"MYCARD\"\n\nA: The diskutil command on macOS is incredibly powerful and can do all that you need. (You can run the following in the Terminal app.)\nFind your SD card:\n$ diskutil list\n...or:\n$ diskutil list external physical\nOn the right, under IDENTIFIER, you'll see your disk labeled like disk2 or disk3, etc. You can use that label to reference your SD card from now on. I'm going to use disk2 for my example commands, but make sure you use your actual identifier.\nFor a board like the Raspberry Pi, you'll want FAT32 with MBR (Master Boot Record). Run:\n$ diskutil eraseDisk FAT32 RASPBIAN MBRFormat disk2\n...making sure disk2 is your SD card identifier from earlier. RASPBIAN can be anything. It'll name the Volume, which is what you'll see once it's mounted. The eraseDisk command will handle unmounting and remounting of the disk, so you don't need to worry about that.\nThat should be all that you need. You will end up with one FAT32 partition. It will look something like the following if you run diskutil list external:\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical)\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *15.8 GB    disk2\n   1:                 DOS_FAT_32 RASPBIAN                15.8 GB    disk2s1\n\nYou can then copy over the Raspbian NOOBS files to the SD card.\n\nIf you want to fully zero out or randomize your SD card, you can run:\n$ diskutil unmountDisk disk2\n...and then:\n$ diskutil zeroDisk disk2\n...or:\n$ diskutil randomDisk disk2\n(The zeroDisk/randomDisk command seems to prefer an unmountDisk command beforehand.)\nAfterwords, you'll need to run that eraseDisk command from earlier to format it in order to be able to use the SD card.\nMany other commands are available. Run man diskutil to see them all (q to quit the manual page).\n\nA: Assuming Disk Utility doesn't work, try formatting the card using the SD Association's official formatting utility. It may seem a bit silly to download a program just for formatting SD cards, but I've had it fix all sorts of strange errors when nothing else worked, including disk utility / diskutil.\n\nA: Use Disk Utility to repartition the drive. It should be able to accomplish everything you need, including reformatting as well if you need it.\n\nA: MacOS seems top be unable to erase a \"RECOVERY\" partition.  Raspbian creates that partition on the card.  When trying to erase the partition with either the Disk Utility app or diskutil, the operation fails with a \"Couldn't Unmount Volume\" error.\n\nA: Use the Apple disk Utility. \nFirst select the boot partition, click the erase button, give it the name you want it to have, and click erase. Now your SD card will have only one partition with the name you have given it.\n", "Q: Can’t install scikit-learn for python on Mac - wrong directory I’m tearing my hair out! (Not much left!)

(side advice: never download Flash from anywhere that's not Adobe's website, but I'm sure you already know that if you're 'sailing the high seas'.)\nUnfortunately, there's no way to avoid closing everything. The only way out of this is to force-quit Safari through Force Quit - the keystroke 'Option-Command-Escape (⌥⌘⎋)'. This would bring the Force Quit menu into focus, allowing you to close Safari and ultimately the problematic tab. The good thing about Force Quit is that it always stays on top and in focus, so the tab shouldn't be able to steal focus from the menu.\n\nThe Force Quit menu. As you can see, the current open application is highlighted automatically.\nIf Safari tries to reopen the closed tabs, ⌥⌘⎋ it again. The next time it starts, it shouldn't try to reopen the closed tabs.\nIt's probably a good idea to track down which site/tab caused this dialog to show up and either inform the webmaster or avoid visiting the site for a few weeks for your safety.

Right now your Activity Monitor is showing some compressed, but no swap used; which means everything is still happy.\nHaving only 4GB of RAM these days means you've just always got to keep an eye on it, but so long as memory pressure stays out of the red, everything is nominally OK.\nThe modern paradigm is that empty memory is wasted memory, so the machine will fill the memory as it needs, to enable a faster response if any of that used memory is needed again. It is far faster to re-use memory than it is to empty it & refill it with the same data over & over, so it hangs onto used memory it thinks it is likely to need again.\n", "Q: Can I use my 2011 iMac as a Thunderbolt display for my PC?

Now, he won't shutdown the system clearly, open the case and remove the HDD.\nAre the data already encrypted, even it is not shut down correctly? \n\nA: Yes. FileVault 2 uses 128 bit AES encryption on all the data on your disk. This is why when you turn on FileVault, you will experience a background task grinding through your entire volume, encrypting the data as it goes. Once complete, only someone with your passphrase will be able to decrypt the data, even if they remove the drive from your Mac.\n\nA: Yes, once removed, the data can only feasibly be accessed by someone with your password. \nHowever, if the attacker gets your computer while it is still running, then uses a USB attack to either force a login as you or creating a new admin (root) account, without the system turning off or rebooting, then your data is at risk.  It's possible, but currently difficult. \nAnother mechanism is to use one of the new, \"Cold Boot Tamper\" techniques which require that the attacker physically compromise your system without your knowledge, tricking you into giving the attacker your password. Obviously, the problem for the bad guy is that they'd need to have ongoing, surreptitious access to your system. Here is a link to a recent paper on this technique, Attacking the BitLocker Boot Process, which is similar to one made for the Mac for a recent security conference.\nWhat all this boils down to is the need for users to make use of multiple layers of security, including physical security, to make the attacker's job so difficult that it discourages 99.9999% of attacks from being pursued to completion.\n", "Q: Increase amount of text copied in iterm2 When I select text in iTerm2, the text it copies cuts off at after a certain (seemingly arbitrary) point.

It's always a good idea to use \"quoted form of\" in a path, in case names have spaces in them.\nThe System Events version would actually throw up an error as it's written, if the file filename doesn't exist. to avoid the error, you'd need to write it like this :\ntell application \"System Events\" to set targetfolder to quoted form of (get POSIX path of temporary items folder & filename)\n\nA: Other answers are good, but do not address security issues.

Working from home today and I just pulled my macbook pro out to realize that I left the \"duckhead\" part of my magsafe 2 power supply (85W) sitting on my desk when I left the office last night. I happen to have an old power supply from (I think) a PowerBook G4 (65W adapter) that has a similar design with a detachable \"duckhead\" piece. But I can see that the two power supplies are definitely not identical.\nIs it safe to swap the \"duckhead\" from the old power supply onto the new magsafe 2, or do I need to head in to the office? The \"duckhead\" from the old supply seems to fit on the magsafe 2 adapter just fine, I just don't know if it is safe.\n\nA: The duckhead is very simple and it's safe to swap.\nWhen you buy Apple World Travel Adapter Kit, you get various connectors that work with their whole range of AC Adapters.  There are not different models.\nhttp://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD837AM/A/apple-world-travel-adapter-kit\n", "Q: Temporary Folder Difference for Apple Script This seems to work as a temporary folder in Apple Script\npath to temporary items\n\nbut \npath to temporary items from user domain\n\nis also recommended to use.\nWhich one is correct and safe to use?

If you require the files to be available to all users, then you should use the plain \"path to temporary items\".\n", "Q: Why do downloads (storedownloadd) from the Mac App Store consume so much CPU? I have noticed this often with large downloads such as Xcode updates and OS X updates and that sort of thing. \nBasically we see this for however much time it takes for the download to proceed: \n\nToday (currently) I am downloading Xcode 7.2.1. \nYou can see storedownloadd appears to be pegging an entire core, and about 30% of this work is handled by the kernel.\nWhat I'm puzzled about is what is this \"work\"? Why does it need to do this work? What amount of processing could it possibly be doing, because decrypting a stream at a few megabytes per second does not require this much resources. I could be downloading a large file like this using hundreds of connections over the internet and running integrity checks on it (with a protocol like bittorrent) and it wouldn't approach anywhere close to what's happening here with resource use.\n\nA: just killed it in terminal ;-) ...taking 1.5MB/s from my slow broadband\nkillall storedownloadd\n\n\nA: Ran into the same issue today when updating XCode: storedownloadd pegs a CPU core for 20 minutes. \nI tried breaking into  storedownloadd with a debugger and saw some really long stack traces and a lot of time spent inside Security::CodeSigning.\nI suspect that it is recursively verifying the digital signatures of a lot of tiny files one-by-one. I have no idea why it would do that instead of verifying the whole package as it is being downloaded. I also see a lot of string manipulation inside Security_CodeSigning::RequirementLexer::RequirementLexer. \nWhatever storedownloadd does, it is too damn slow! \n\nA: The CPU usage is caused by both sloppy coding and encryption/decompressing. Engineers have become very careless with our CPU in the age of quad core notebooks with eight virtual cores.\nSomeone should chase Apple around about optimising the storedownloadd routine. Considering that we had to put up with broken networking for over a year until Apple replaced the broken by design discoveryd with mDNSresponder. \nDarker thoughts might suggest that the store is also compressing data for upload and sending it. Microsoft was caught out doing this many times but I haven't seen a documented case in Apple's case.\n", "Q: How do Mac file imports from SD cards work when the option is set to delete after import? My uncle recently imported files from his SD card and there were serious errors. I have no idea WHY that's occurred, but the videos I took are once in a lifetime. I shot on .MOV format, but the card also contained some other Nikon camera format. \nImages taken on both the Nikon and the Canon were imported. But he says that there was some problem with the videos. He mentioned \"convert\" and \"mpeg4\". I asked him what the net size after import was, and he said 20 MB. That's impossible even if conversion occurred because the videos are, in their basic format, at least a few gigabytes. \nSo did my Mac import, then delete those SPECIFIC files or did it format the whole thing?\n\nA: There are many programs that will import photos from a memory card, so you might want to get more information so that people don't have to guess.\nImage Capture imports images and then once they are verified - deletes only the files. This deletion is easily reversed with run of the mill \"camera card software\" that recovers deleted files. See https://www.prosofteng.com/picture-rescue-2/ for one example of that.\nThe other Apple software generally works the same (iMovie, iPhoto) - but if these photos are really irreplaceable - you could get a professional quote to recover the files and interview your uncle to understand what he did or look over the Mac to see what software is installed and rule out something that would reformat the drive.\n", "Q: Where to insert a custom item in /etc/hosts file?

As long as you don't have a huge amount of lines in your /etc/hosts file that shouldn't really make a difference though.\nI personally would add my own entries after the last line because I like to clearly separate my own stuff from the system's default stuff.\n", "Q: Check if G5 is a SMP one?

I'll edit this later if I can find any. It looks like it's possible in Single User Mode, but I'm not sure about via OpenFirmware.\n\nA: Considering these two pieces of information\nprocessor   : 0\ncpu         : PPC970FX\n\nIt looks like there is only one physical CPU installed and it is a single-core.\nI tried finding out if the motherboard supports two physical CPUs but came up empty:\nmotherboard : PowerMac9,1 MacRISC4 Power Macintosh \n\nHopefully some Mac hardware gurus are floating around here that are familiar with that board :)\n\nThe reason I say the CPU is single-core is because Wikipedia states:\n\nThe 970MP is a dual-core derivative of the 970FX\n\n", "Q: How to control where script run by cron saves files? I've got the following cron job that runs at 6 am every morning:\n00 6 * * * /Users/username/path/to/script/wget.pl 1;\n\nThe script, written in perl, fetches the latest files from a website.\nWithin the perl script, the path gets changed with:\n`cd '/path/to/directory'`\n\nHowever, all the files downloaded aren't getting saved to /path/to/directory they get saved in /Users/username.\nWhat can I do to get the script to save it in the directory I want?\n\nA: Doing a `cd /path` within your script only changes the directory for the shell that is spawned to execute the shell command.  It's the same thing as doing \nsystem('cd /path');\n\nIt doesn't change the cwd (current working directory) of the script itself.  The best way to do it is to have your script write the files to a specific directory.

I have been looking into UUCP (Unix-to-Unix Copy, a very old network protocol) as a way of communicating with some Linux boxes that don't always have an internet connection. While doing so on my Macbook (with El Capitan), I found entries in my /usr/share/uucp/sys file for uucpsys1.apple.com and uucpsys2.apple.com. (You can also see these by running uuchk | less.)\nWhat is Apple doing with UUCP? I found this post on the Apple forums by someone who noticed a UUCP user, but no one came forward with an explanation, so I'm hoping someone here will know.\nI'm especially curious because /usr/share/* falls under System Integrity Protection in El Capitan, which means I'll need to set up a separate UUCP implementation if I want to use it for my purposes — but it also suggests that, if Apple's shipping OS X with a UUCP that only they can use, they must be using it for something. \nETA: I've also found a launchd daemon at /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.uucp.plist. It has <key>Disabled</key><true/> in the plist, so it won't be run by default, but other daemons could enable it programmatically without altering the plist. I'm also intrigued to see that it's in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ (and thus subject to SIP) rather than /Library/LaunchDaemons/ — it adds to my hunch that it's something Apple is using (or maybe was using, as patrix comments), rather than just a miscellaneous *nix tool they happened to include.\n\nA: Those entries are examples that can be used as templates in user defined configurations. \nSee the same examples at:\nhttp://www.opensource.apple.com/source/uucp/uucp-11/configs/sys\n\nYou can see those examples in the same way as the phone prefix +555 in the movies.

Mac does some pretty fancy background stuff to try and keep enough disk space for whatever it needs. In my case, 512 gb ssd, it needs to have at least 20gb free to run smoothly, so I usually have 40. If it goes less than 1gb for whatever reason (and boy, it isn't that hard to happen), all apps get suddenly paused without a warning and even if I immediately free up space, all apps get into a weird paused state for ever. This is the second time it happened (because I keep on constant manual monitoring with CMD + F3) and first time I gave up on finding a simple and good resolution (the first time it ended up rebooting after some update after some days, and I even forgot I hadn't gave up on improving this question, among so many others)\n\nSo, one simple solution is rebooting. But then you can lose whatever you were working on. No good.\nAnother better solution is going to terminal and typing killall -CONT -c \"app name\" for each app and service. Nothing simple here and good luck finding them all with ps, activity monitor, Force Quit Applications (FQA) window list or whatever. Even if you do find 'em, this can't take less than a couple minutes for most heavy users.\nAlso, for whatever reason, some apps will continue to be listed as paused (on the FQA window) even if they seem to be running fine. Continuing the \"odd enough\" route of what status is this, there's a GUI'ed app for pausing and unpausing apps that won't even see them as being paused. Even if you go ahead and pause them to later unpause, they never get back.\nFinally, I was looking for ways to write a script which would find the paused apps and kill -CONT them back again, but couldn't get such list in any way. launchctl or ps won't bring the \"paused\" or sometimes \"not responding\"-but-still-paused status.\nI do remember unfortunately closing a window that did show up when the applications were first paused by the system which was very similar to the FQA window and did bring an extra button to unpause apps, but now I've got no clue what was its name or how to find it / trigger it again.\nThat's all I've got right now, and I'm almost giving up for good on this. Maybe the only good and simple solution is mixing up what I've got: \n\nUnpause the important apps, save stuff and reboot.\n\nAny better idea?\n\nA: To un-pause those paused/not responding applications after you free up some space, try to run this command:\npkill -CONT -u $UID\n\nor (as suggested here):\nkill -CONT -1\n\nIf this happens very often, consider adding the following alias into your shell rc file, e.g.:\nalias unpause=\"pkill -CONT -u $UID\"\n\n", "Q: What will be removed if I sync my device with another iTunes?

I'll give as much help as I can, but you're probably best following online guides until you can come back with more information. MacWorld has a good guide, as does HowToGeek and a host of others. Given what you've done so far, I'll try to help, updating this post as you complete steps. Comment and let me know what the results are.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, let's run Apple Hardware Test or Apple Diagnostics. This will help us find out if your issue is hardware or software based. If your mac was made after June 2013, use Apple Diagnostics. Otherwise, use Apple Hardware Test. If this fails, you're probably in big trouble (although it probably won't.) Best case, you simply don't have it installed for a variety of reasons. Normally, if your Mac is new enough (again, almost certainly), it'll automatically start using internet based AHT. However, if it didn't connect (or can't) connect to the internet, you might be able to create a bootable version of AHT on an external drive.

At some point in the future, I should replace this answer with a procedure similar to what you followed.\nUpdate #1\nIn my answer, I did state that I would need additional information before recommending changes to the steps given. Apple has published that you can run Windows on a second internal drive, but you can not install Windows on the second drive. Apple recommends removing the first drive, installing Windows and then reinstalling the first drive. This is not a practical solution for MBP users.\nI still have no more information about the partitioning of your internal drives than when you first posted your question. However, you may wish to try this older post regarding installing Windows: How do I install Windows 10 on MacBookPro5,1, with no optical drive (SSD+HDD)\nOrignal Answer\nApple recommends using an USB optical SuperDrive to install Windows when the internal optical drive in unavailable. \nEven though Apple documentation states a late 2009 iMac does not support Windows 10, this may not be true. I installed Windows 10 on my mid 2007 iMac. In fact, this post was entered using Windows 10 on this Mac. Generally, you should install using the latest drivers issued for your model Mac.\nInstalling directly from the iso file is possible, but the process is tedious. You also have to install free third party software. The steps would be similar to the answer given here. Of course, you do not have the standard OS X installation configuration.

Will your iPad's serial no., backups, data or any other sensitive information be stored on your friend's Apple ID?\n\nA: The answer is mixed. While the iTunes app store can be signed into with a separate Apple ID, there will be some data (naturally) stored on the second account you use. The device will not be added to their My Apple Devices, though it will become an Authorized Device in iTunes Store. As such, some level of data will be held in the Apple Servers to facilitate this transaction. AFAIK this data is not user-accessible.\nHowever, for data backups, Photos, Find my iPhone, My Apple Devices, etc. that would require the user to login via iCloud on the phone and not just the Apple Store. From there, whatever level of data you set to sync would be replicated up.

Fair enough, I'm sure it's an intensive process. However, I also saw the usage for Lightroom jump higher than 400% on several occasions (usually up to around 410%).\nI understand how my CPU is Hyper-Threaded so that it has 4 cores/400% CPU available, but how could it possibly use more than that (bearing in mind several other processes were running as well)?\nCheers,\nDan\n\nA: If you look here, you have 2 cores that can execute 2 threads each with turbo boost.  So I would assume 400% is your maximum.  Seems likely that Adobe maxed out one CPU completely, and the other CPU was running the OS and other tasks.\nThe additional usage may be because your 2.7 ghz CPU was turbo boosted to 3.1 ghz at the time.\nAlso, within Activity Monitor, you can choose Window -> CPU History, and it will break down everything.  For example on my 6 core Xeon, I have 12 graphs.\n\nA: \nThis system also supports \"Turbo Boost 2.0\" -- which \"automatically increases the speed of the active cores\" to improve performance when needed (up to 3.1 GHz for this model) -- and \"Hyper Threading\" -- which allows the system to recognize four total \"cores\" or \"threads\" (two real and two virtual).\n\n(as found on this page)\nThe turbo boost lets your processor go beyond the 100% threshold for intensive tasks\n", "Q: Will windows be open after restart?

Follow this guide or any other after getting the song from ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music.\n\nSelect and edit a song\nThe first thing we'll need to do is choose a song in iTunes to use as a ringtone. Open up iTunes on your Mac or PC and click on the My Music tab. Choose a song that's on your hard drive then right click on it, choose Get Info, then click the Options tab.\nWithin the main panel you'll see settings for Start and Stop. A ringtone can only be thirty seconds long, so use these settings to isolate the part of the song you want then click OK. You won't be deleting anything on the actual track itself, so don't worry.\nNow highlight the song, go up to File at the top of the screen and select Create New Version>Create AAC version. iTunes will duplicate the track, but if you look closely you'll see that the new version is only thirty seconds long. That's the one we'll use for our ringtone. Remember to go back to the original track now and untick the Start and Stop options, otherwise the track will only play that short section.\nChange the file type\nHighlight the short version of the song, then right click and select Show in Finder. Now you'll see the two versions of the song. The duplicate should have a 1 at the end of the name to differentiate it, and of course the file size will be smaller. To use it as a ringtone we'll need to convert the file type from .m4a to .m4r, which involves clicking on the name once to highlight it, then once again to edit the name so we can change the last three letters. Finder will then ask you if you are sure you want to use the new file type? Choose 'Use .m4r' in the pop up box to confirm. Leave the Finder window open for now, as we'll use it again in a moment.\nDelete the shorter track\nReturn to iTunes and delete the short version of the track, remembering to check the length carefully before you do so. When prompted choose Keep File, as we want to remove the track from our music library but not our computer entirely.\nImport the track to iTunes as a ringtone\nGo back to the Finder window and double click the shorter file. Rather disconcertingly it will disappear from the box, but start playing in the background. Don't worry, it isn't really gone. Return to iTunes, go to the row of icons in the top left corner and click on the three dots. This brings up more options, one of which is Tones. Click this and you'll see that the short version of the song is now a ringtone.\nSync the ringtone with your iPhone\nConnect your iPhone to iTunes and click on the little phone icon just to the right of the three dots. This will bring up the iTunes panel for your phone, from which you want to select Tones in the left hand column. Once inside click Sync Tones>Selected tones>then the track you've created. Finally go to the bottom right hand corner and click Apply.\nSet the new ringtone\nAll that remains to be done now is to go to Settings on your iPhone, then Sounds, and you'll find the new ringtone at the top of the list. Tap on it to select it as your general tone.\n\n", "Q: How to move cursor to the end of the line in a cell in Excel for Mac 2011 For example,\nIn any text editor:\nCommand+right arrow will put your cursor to the Right of the line\nCommand+left arrow will move your cursor to the Left of the line\nIs there an equivalent keybord shortcut for this in Excel for Mac?\n\nA: You didn't say what version of Excel you're using however see the Moving and scrolling in a sheet or workbook section of Keyboard shortcuts in Excel 2016 for Mac.\n \n\nA: FN + Left Arrow\nFN + Right Arrow\n", "Q: Time Machine sparsebundle mounting problems Problem\nI have a Time Machine backup which contains a lot of valuable information and I'm trying to access it.

So I tried to eject the network disk containing the sparsebundle and I got an error saying:\n\n\n\n\"The disk backups couldn't be ejected because finder it using it\"\n\nWhat???

I'll try to disable spotlight and see what I can do\n\n\nThere must surely be a better way to browse a Time Machine backup on a network disk\nIf not, how can my problem be fixed?\n\nA: It's not Time Machine, or anything\nIt's Spotlight. How?\nSpotlight\nSpotlight indexes everything. Even on an external disk. My backup .sparsebundle was > 2 TB. My computer can't handle this. Spotlight would index everything before it showed in finder.\nDebugging\nFirst, to see what was using the disk. Run:\nsudo lsof | grep /Volumes/<Volume Name>\n\nI got something like:\ndiskimage 519           vihan    4r      mds\n\nand about 4 of those. That meant Spotlight was going haywire.\nDisabling\nDisabling spotlight is simple. RUN THIS BEFORE TOUCHING THE .SPARSEBUNDLE\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\n\nThat should disable Spotlight. Now you can double click the .sparsebundle and continue as from this answer\n", "Q: How to use \"Find My Phone\" beeping feature (not location sharing) with a different Apple ID My girlfriend and I both have iDevices. We each have our own Apple ID. Every once in a while one of us misplaces a device... you know the drill, \"Honey, could you call my phone for me?\" And then it turns out it's on vibrate so we can't hear it, or it's my iPad we're looking for, and we have to go to a computer and log in with that person's account, to trigger the \"Find my phone\" sound.\nWe'd much rather be able to do that from our mobile devices. Is this possible? I know that I can use \"Find my Friends\" to see the location of a device on a different account, but what I need is the \"ring at full volume\" feature of \"Find my phone.\" Is there any way to do that from another device? Also, can it be done from an Android device? (The iCloud website doesn't allow android devices to log in.)\n\nA: You can do it from Find My iPhone on another iPhone, you just need to sign in as the person whose phone you're trying to find [or get them to do it].\nAlternatively, you can find all members' phones if you use Family Sharing. \nI doubt there's any way to do it from an Android.

I can't find Preferences in utorrent or bittorrent on my new MacBook Pro. How do I find Preferences on a Mac?\n\nA: Welcome to the world of the Mac!\nUnlike many other operating systems, most Mac OS X apps don't have a menu bar in the app itself but use the system-wide Menu Bar.\nWhen uTorrent app is in focus (click on it once if you're not sure), the Menu Bar will show the menu options for uTorrent. \nOne of the options will be \"Preferences...\" as you can see in the screenshot below:\n\n\nA: Almost universally on Mac [with very few exceptions]\n Cmd ⌘   ,  (command + comma) will open Preferences.\n", "Q: iOS Keyboard & Arrow Keys Running the iOS 9.2.1 on an iPhone 6S and an iPad 4 Mini, I notice that the iPhone keyboard in landscape mode now includes left & right arrow keys (how long, I wonder?). This does not appear to be the case in the iPad, even though you would expect that they would fit more easily there.\nIs there a way I can get these arrow keys for the landscape orientation or for the iPad?\n(I don’t mean on specialised keyboards in some apps, but on the standard keyboard).\nThanks\n\nA: With the iPads, you can hold two fingers on the keyboard and move the cursor around by moving your two fingers around.\nAdditionally, you can double tap you fingers on the keyboard and it will select current word. If you double tap but keep your fingers down on the screen on the second tap, you can use this to select text by cursor position.\nOn the iPhone 6S, you can actually hard press (3D touch) to move the cursor, rather than using arrow keys in landscape.\n\nA: You can swipe with two fingers on the keyboard to move the cursor around. It's even easier to use than arrow keys.\n\nA: This does not help when using applications that use the arrow keys to perform functions.  The only reason I am interested in these keys is to retrieve a previous command in a comman line application.  There is no way to use this frequently used function from my iPad so I have to lug around my MacBook or a PC in order to do my job remotely.\n", "Q: How has it suddenly become so much faster to wake OS X from \"safe sleep\"? Because I'm super paranoid about security, I configure my MacBook to always \"safe sleep\" and destroy its FileVault key on entering standby:\n$ sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25 DestroyFVKeyOnStandby 1\n\nAs explained under pmset(1):\n\nhibernatemode = 25 (binary 0001 1001) is only settable via pmset. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If you want \"hibernation\" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery life, you should use this setting.\n\nand:\n\ndestroyfvkeyonstandby - Destroy File Vault Key when going to standby mode. By default File vault keys are retained even when system goes to standby. If the keys are destroyed, user will be prompted to enter the password while coming out of standby mode.(value: 1 - Destroy, 0 - Retain)\n\nConsequently, when the machine wakes from sleep one must:\n\n\n*\n\n*first unlock FileVault at an EFI lock screen; and then\n\n*unlock OS X at a login window.\n\n\nHistorically, there was an understandable delay between these two steps, as OS X has to restore from disk image (copying the hibernatefile into RAM) before it's able to do anything else.  Whilst this was happening, the display would show the login window overlaid by a semi-transparent covering together with a progress bar.\nHowever, I no longer witness any delay between steps 1 and 2.  It appears that OS X is able to resume almost as soon as FileVault is unlocked, which suggests to me that power may not have been removed from RAM as promised by hibernatemode 25.\nWhat's going on?  Have, as the logs below suggest, Apple found some magical way to restore gigabytes of RAM from disk image impercetably fast (and, if so, wouldn't every laptop user prefer to \"safe sleep\", perhaps without destroying FileVault keys, rather than keeping RAM powered and wasting battery)?  Or, more likely(?), is my MacBook no longer really entering \"safe sleep\"?  If the latter, why—and how can I fix it?\n\n\n$ sw_vers\nProductName:    Mac OS X\nProductVersion: 10.11.3\nBuildVersion:   15D21\n\n$ pmset -g\nSystem-wide power settings:\n SleepDisabled      0\n DestroyFVKeyOnStandby      1\nActive Profiles:\nBattery Power       -1\nAC Power        -1*\nCurrently in use:\n standbydelay         10800\n standby              1\n womp                 0\n halfdim              1\n hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\n powernap             0\n gpuswitch            2\n networkoversleep     0\n disksleep            10\n sleep                1\n autopoweroffdelay    14400\n hibernatemode        25\n autopoweroff         0\n ttyskeepawake        1\n displaysleep         10\n acwake               0\n lidwake              1\n\n$ cat /var/log/system.log\nFeb  5 01:19:35 eggyal PowerChime[622]: 53728.262434: GOING TO SLEEP: kStateDarkWake -> kStateAsleep\nFeb  5 01:19:35 eggyal PowerChime[622]: 53728.262821: Calling goingToSleepBlock\nFeb  5 01:19:38 eggyal kernel[0]: PM response took 3072 ms (57, powerd)\nFeb  5 01:19:38 eggyal kernel[0]: AppleCamIn::systemWakeCall -

It may be because I had a developer account before ( and I still have as a member but that's not active ) \nHow could I self sign this app?\n\nA: Try changing the identifier to something unique to you, like \"net.plato.kodi-ios\" and then try having Xcode fix the issue.\nI eventually got Kodi to compile on my own after tweaking some of the provisioning settings, but I have active developer profiles and haven't ever done anything with the free account.\nThere have been limits on the number of free apps you can sign.

In the past I've used a Linksys USB3GIGv1 ethernet adapter to connect to a wired network, however for the past week or so it hasn't worked.\nWhen I plug the adapter into the USB port with System Preferences > Network open, nothing gets updated; the interface doesn't show up in the list on the left side of the window, and if I turn Wi-Fi off, I lose my connection to the internet. The light on the adapter does flash at random, though, as it used to.\nI tried disabling and re-enabling all the interfaces through ifconfig <iface name> off/on, but no luck there. I've also tried using an unbranded ethernet adapter which had previously worked, as well as switching out the cables for one with a known working connection, and even hooking the dongle up to a Thunderbolt display, but all to no avail.\nThe dongle does show up in System Information > USB and the brand and model are correctly identified on the USB 3.0 bus.\nFinally, I've tried manually installing the drivers from Linksys's website, but they only support OS X up to 10.9 (I had used this dongle post-10.11, and it stopped working almost randomly).\nHow can I get my MacBook to connect to the internet using an ethernet adapter considering all of that?\n\nA: The old driver probably doesn't work with El Capitan. As indicated on the Linksys website Belkin is working on creating a Linksys driver package for the OS X 10.11.\nMeanwhile you may try the RealTek beta driver here.\n", "Q: Create a contact in people in Outlook 2016 In Mail for Mac I can create a contact directly from an email message.

Most of you at least. I own 2 iPhones bought in a legitimate Chinese Apple store. Whenever I use it, they would make a tri-tone dying robot low battery sound at 20% and 10%. This will sound even if you're on silent. So to turn it off (you can't) you'd have to change your ringer volume. There are no apps causing this since I wiped my phone and it still happens. I would like to make a conclusion that only Chinese iPhones have this stupid tone.\nWhy did they put that on these phones and not American ones?\n\nA: The app \"Battery Alert!\" will allow you to change several battery related sounds (warning, alert, and full). It is currently $.99 USD on the app store.\n", "Q: What is the difference between -h, -r, -s, and -k, in the \"shutdown now\" command in single-user mode? So, I opened up single-user mode to show my friend how easy it was for a Mac to be directly hijacked if someone was able to steal the physical lap top (as opposed to hijacking remotely using SSH), and I couldn't exactly remember which shutdown now option to use (fortunately, I was prompted by the command line), so I defaulted to -h. Should I be worried if I use -h instead of -r? Is there any difference between these commands?\nshutdown -h now\nshutdown -s now\nshutdown -r now\nshutdown -k now\n\n\nA: As stated in the shutdown manual page (man shutdownentered in a Terminal window):\n -h      The system is halted at the specified time.\n\n -k      Kick everybody off.  The -k option does not actually halt the\n         system, but leaves the system multi-user with logins disabled\n         (for all but super-user).\n\n -r      The system is rebooted at the specified time.\n\n -s      The system is put to sleep at the specified time.\n\nSo to shutdown the Mac the -h option is the proper one. -r restarts it and -s puts it to sleep. The -k option doesn't halt your system at all.\n\nA: Not much happens in single user mode - so I just just use a simpler command:\nhalt\n\nThe shutdown command is for sequencing a lot of the scaffolding that is erected to have the system processes start in a certain order, then user processes. Even with launchd simplifying much on OS X, all of this is relevant to full blown OS X - notice to allow programs to save work, close files, check point logs so that the next start has less work to do. \nNone of that matters in single user mode as halt flushes the IO and takes down the power to the hardware.\n", "Q: Connect iPad/iPhone to WiFI, but not MBP? I have an iPhone and iPad that have permission to connect to WiFi W (Work).  I have a MiFi device (M), and I want my MacBook Pro to connect to M and not W.  How can I do this?  It seems that when Apple remembers a WiFi password (e.g., for W), it does it for all your Apple devices, including laptops.\n\nA: Click the Apple on your MBP and select System Preferences... and then choose Network.\nClick Advanced at the bottom and WiFi should be highlighted. In that is Preferred Networks. Select the work on and hit the - to remove it. Then connect to the MiFi and in that same area, click the +.\nShould be all set then!\n\nA: Short of asking them to simply blacklist your MAC address on the work network…\nYou'll have to remove one device or the other from iCloud Keychain. On the Mac or iPhone, go to System Preferences > iCloud and deselect Keychain. Then when you remove the Wi-Fi network on your Mac, it will not affect the iPhone.\n", "Q: Does Apple's World Travel Adapter Kit work in India? I'm traveling to India next week and am considering buying Apple's World Travel Adapter Kit so I can use my Macbook pro in India.\nHowever, India is not listed in its list of supported countries.  I came across a suggestion on the Internet that said the United Kingdom adapter would work just fine in India, but I'm not certain about that.\nCan anyone confirm whether the kit has an adapter that works in India?  Being able to confirm from personal experience would be a big plus.\n\nA: The adapter shown below, in Apple's World Travel Adapter Kit, will work in India.\n\n\nA: I'd save your money & pick something up when you get there, in the airport. All airports carry a supply of foreign > home country adapters, for just such occasions.\nThe Apple kit looks like it has adaptor for UK, US, EU, Australia - which is pretty wide, but not total coverage.\nThere are 15 different IEC plug standards worldwide - some are interchangeable, like the European C/E/F types, but most are not.\nIndia predominantly uses plug type D, whilst the UK uses type G - totally incompatible.\nThe D might be the same pin-width as a type C/E/F, but you won't find out until you get there. ...Like when you discover your shaver plug is a different width to everything except the socket on the hotel bathroom mirror.\nThere's a good pictorial guide at WorldStandards : Plug & pocket types or the 'official' source at the IEC - http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/\n\nA: Most of the business hotels use universal sockets, which accept most of the plugs, except the IEC Type E/F (Schuko releated types), but you loss the ground contact.\nI found the new UK type (IEC Type G) works best with these sockets, as it also has ground contacts, and as I live in Europe, the easier to get.\nI also found, there are local Apple Stores (franchise shops, not run by Apple) in the newly built malls, which sells the standard 5W and 12W adapters with offical IND plugs (IEC Type D with 2 prongs). They cost around 1700 Rupees for the 12W power adapter.\n", "Q: How to configure a proxy in a new network location using Terminal.app I'm writing a bash script, which will create new network location and configure it. The question is - how to add proxy settings to specific network location using terminal or bash script? \nP.S. I'm creating new location using networksetup -createlocation <location name>\n\nA: Found this networksetup manual. To do this, you just need to write \nnetworksetup -setwebproxy \"Service name (e.g. Wi-Fi)\" proxy.server.com port\n\n", "Q: Internet Sharing, same LAN I'd like to share internet from ethernet (10.0.100.2) to Wi-Fi.\nBut when I do so and then I connect a device via Wi-Fi I get a whole different network: 192.168.2.0. Is there a way to use the same 10.0.100.0 network? \nI need it because I have internal DNS and need to debug stuff over the LAN.\n\nA: There is no need to use the same network. Usually you can simply populate your DNS-server with the IPs and the names of the hosts in the 192.168.2.0 network.\nIf you restricted allowed DNS queries to a particular network (i.e 10.0.100.0/24), you have to extend this to the 192.168.2.0/24 net.\nIn the network settings of the devices in the 192.168.2.0/24 network you have to set up your internal DNS-server as DNS-server.\n\nA: You Mac is getting a single IP address on the LAN. To enable multiple devices to access the LAN, it creates a new private network on the Wi-Fi interface, and does NAT (Network Address Translation) between that network and the LAN. This is the same thing that happens when you connect your LAN (using private addresses) to the Internet using a router that gets a single public IP address.\nDevices on your Wi-Fi network will be able to access devices on your LAN. Their IP address will be \"translated\" to your Mac's IP address, so devices receiving requests will see them as coming from your Mac. When they reply (to your Mac), your Mac will then do the reverse translation and send the packet down to the original device on the Wi-Fi network.\nNote that this works well when devices on the Wi-Fi network need to access devices on the LAN. The other way around would be a problem.\nAn alternative is to use bridging instead of sharing. In that case, devices on both networks will think they're all on the same network (your Mac will forward frames from one network to the other). But this means that any devices on your Wi-Fi network will appear on the LAN (and use IP addresses there). Depending on your LAN's policies, this may or may not be an issue.\n", "Q: How to make Airmail to open mailto: protocol link? I have searched for this but I can't find anything in search results answering this query.\nWhen I click on mailto link given in a mail inside Airmail,it opens Mail.app window instead of opening it inside Airmail. On setting gmail account on Mail.app, starts downloading 2GB sized inbox.\n\nA: I use RCDefaultApp to tweak this type of setting and many other.  Note that while this is an older app nonetheless it still works with OS X 10.11.x too.\nIt's a Preferences Pane style app and it's freeware.

I need to add just one pdf onto it. So I installed iTunes here, but it won't sync iTunes to iPad. It wants to sync iPad to iTunes instead. Which is pointless, as the local library is empty. Both are logged on same iTunes account.\nHow do I make iTunes sync to iPad, so things can be added to the library and then synced back to iDevice?\n\nA: Your first sync will bring items from your iPad to your iTunes library. Once that is done via iBooks on your mac drop the PDF into that app. Then when you sync again that PDF will show up on your iPad. \nOr you can just email (iMessage, AirDrop) the PDF to your iPad and then open it and save it into iBooks. \nIf the iPad already has media content then you will want to this - https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4256950?start=0&tstart=0\n", "Q: Database.db file in Macintosh HD I see a Database.db file with size zero bytes on my Macintosh HD\nIs this a system file? i am not sure if this is something i can remove or the purpose of this file\nRegards\n\nA: You're probably fine, but it depends and since it's taking up no space, no good reason to delete it yet. It's simply a database file put there by something (again, probably not OS X.) You should attempt to narrow down what application is using the file (see this post) and then either keep it or delete it as appropriate.\n", "Q: Where are the root CAs stored on OS X? I need one of the root CA certificates, as a filename, to pass to a command-line program.  I could download it from DigiCert (and convert it to the required format, .crt) manually, but I figure it's easier to just use the CA that OS X must already have.  It's a common certificate, and all my Linux servers already have it, for example.\nIn the \"Keychain Access\" app, the correct certificate does exist, but I can't find anything that says where it lives.\nDo these CAs exist in the filesystem, or only in an opaque proprietary format for OS X APIs?\n\nA: The root CAs are stored in:\n/System/Library/Keychains/SystemCACertificates.keychain\n/System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain\nYes, these are OS X keychain files which are opaque, though not necessarily proprietary. You could theoretically use OS X's Keychain Services APIs to get at the certificate data inside the keychain file, but that might be overkill.\nIf you want a tangible copy of any of the root CA certificates, just select it in Keychain Access, and drag them to the Desktop to make a copy of them in .cer format.\n(You can also use Quick Look in the Finder to preview the certificate info).\n\nA: You can use the security tool on OSX to list search for specific certificates in one or more Keychains.\nFrom Big Sur the default locations used for the System Keychains are\n\n*\n\n*/System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain\n\n*/Library/Keychains/System.keychain\n\nand for your personal login keychain\n\n*\n\n*/Users//Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db\n\nThe security command line program (see man security) can be used to list, export and search for certificates stored in these keychains.\nExporting all root certificates to a PEM encoded bundle:\nsecurity export -t certs -f pemseq -k /System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain -o /tmp/all_certs.pem\n\nIf you want a specific certificate where you know the Common Name in the keychain \"KEYCHAIN\" instead try:\nsecurity find-certificate -p -c \"COMMON NAME\" \"KEYCHAIN\"\n\nIf you pipe it through openssl you can then easily verify it is the right certificate as so:\nsecurity find-certificate -p -c \"COMMON NAME\" \"KEYCHAIN\" | openssl x509 -text -noout\n\nFor example; To find all Root Certs with the string \"Apple\" in its name and display them in PEM format you would use\nsecurity find-certificate -p -c \"Apple\" /System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain\n\nThere are many, many more options for the \"security\" program to work with keychains so you need to read the man page.

I tried to rm -f the existing Dock plist first and then copying over the new one, I tried killing the Dock and not killing it afterwards, I tried rebooting the machine, I tried cp -f, all don't matter. I still get the old Dock.\nWhen I copy over the same Dock plist to the user template folder in /System and make a new account, it suddenly works as expected.\nThe account of the user who receives the new Dock plist is NOT logged in, by the way. Also the template Dock file is from another computer. However I don't think the file itself is corrupt, since it does work with new User accounts. Also the path is correct because the Modified date of the plist in /Preferences is updated. \nWhat am I missing here?

At the start my Magic Mouse 1 and my keyboard were already paired. Today my mouse wouldn't click for some reason so I unpaired the mouse, now the mouse won't pair. In the Windows 10 Control Panel I don't see any drivers that aren't installed. I already tried restarting my laptop and turning the mouse off and back on. \nWhenever I try pairing the mouse I get an pop-up from windows saying it can't find the mouse anymore and asks me to try this again. I just finished installing all my programs, I really don't want to do that again.\nAnyone knows how to solve this issue?\n\nA: So far, I learned from experimenting and the blogs: I have to REMOVE (not just DISCONNECT) the Bluetooth mouse in Mac OS X, before I can pair it in BootCamp Windows. Since this is not comfortable enough, I'm not fully done yet. \nAfter another entire day of fumbling around in blogs, Apple sites and the machine itself, it seems to work. \n1st of all, I have to correct myself - the mouse is an Apple Bluetooth MIGHTY Mouse (not a MAGIC one). Sorry for the wrong place - there is not much word about the Mighty in the blogs.\nThe machine is a late 2006 MBP15 (2,2 A1211). The Mac OS X is a Lion, the BootCamp is 4.0.4 running Windows 10. Apple doesn't support this combo. They don't provide Windows Support Software for it either (the download attempt through BootCamp Assistant fails). So I'm in fact on my own.\nHaving eventually learned that, I decided to UNPAIR (not REMOVE) the mouse in Mac OS X, before I switched to Windows 10. In Windows 10, I managed to pair it within the Bluetooth Preference window. However, the transition had switched the mouse OFF, so I had to switch it OFF/ON again. And, I had to toggle the Bluetooth switch in the Preference window; otherwise the radio wouldn't at all search for the mouse! I think that I even had to click the mouse - but I'm not sure about that. Anyway - the mouse worked than, and I could open the Device Manager to check the Bluetooth entries and the Mouse entries. (With the mouse, the Bluetooth entry has to have 2 extra sub-entries, while the Mouse entry has to have just one extra sub-entry.)\nFrom there, I could switch to Mac OS X. Of course, the mouse was dead, but I could pair it after having switched it OFF/ON and clicked to make it alive. \nFor the return to Windows 10 I could keep it paired. Arriving in Windows 10, I had just to switch the mouse OFF/ON and click to make it work.\nI'm going to test this for a while - happy that there is no need for additional drivers.\n\nA: Kinda late to the party, I know, but having just encountered this problem myself, and solving it using Mike6's convoluted answer, figured I would describe it to you in layman's terms.\nIf you are having difficulty connecting your Apple mouse to your MAC OS X with Bootcamp Windows 10 installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the device from your MAC OS X's paired devices. This does not mean just Disconnect the device, go into the Bluetooth preferences and REMOVE the device from your list of paired devices (click on the \"x\" next to the device in that screen and UNPAIR your device).\n\n*Make sure your device is turned On. \n\n*Load up Bootcamp. Navigate over to your Bluetooth Devices and \"Add Bluetooth or other device\". Select \"Bluetooth\" from the box that pops open. Select your device. The device should now connect.\n*Side note: Your mouse may have a more generic name, such as \"Mouse\", when searching for it in Bootcamp's Bluetooth Devices (after you've removed it from MAC OS X's paired devices), this is still your mouse, select it and connect. \n\nA: You would think the pairing on macOS wouldn't have anything to do with the pairing in Windows 10 since they are two different OSs on different partitions, but this is not true. I guess it has to do with how the Mac pairs with the bluetooth mouse on a hardware level.\nSolution is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to macOS's Settings and Bluetooth Options\n\n*Remove Magic Mouse by clicking the x button\n\n*Reboot into Bootcamp\n\n*You should now be able to pair it on Windows.\n\n*When you go back to MacOS it will ask you to reconnect to the Magic Mouse and you won't lose it again on the Windows\n\n\nThis works for Late 2016 Macbook Pro Retina with Touchbar, Mac OS High Sierra, Windows 10 1709 (Fall Creators Update)\n", "Q: Formatting mac and encrypted memory Currently I have a 128GB SD for data in my macbook, but is encrypted using utility.

You can't properly erase/repartition a disk the OS X booted from. Additionally it seems that you don't have a proper Recovery HD.\nI recommend either to create a bootable installer thumb drive with the Lion installer or booting to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing altcmdR while booting, formatting the internal disk and restoring OS X. Not all Macs boot to IRM though.\nTo create a bootable thumb drive you need the Lion installer app, a second Mac and a USB thumb drive (8 GB or more)\n\nA: You can't unmount the disk because you're booting from it. You'll need to boot from an external volume or the internet: I would recommend the latter since it's probably the fastest and most hassle free for trying to reinstall whatever it came with. However, not all Macs support this (yours probably does), so check and see if it's compatible.

I am looking for my photos from the Photo App and I can't seem to find them anywhere on the old hard drive to import onto our new hard drive.  Any ideas?\n\nA: Finding the Library\nPictures from photos are usually in a single big archive called Photos Library found in a user's Pictures folder. Go to the root of your hard drive (the root is what you see when you open it, before opening any folders inside it), and then open the following directories:\nUsers > (your user name) > Pictures\n\nThe library should be there.\nOpening the Library\nTo open it, open Photos. The icon usually bounces into its place the Dock while Photos is loading the pictures, and then the window shows up. You will want to hold the option key before the window shows up (I usually do this by holding the option key when I click on the Photos icon). This will tell Photos you want to open another library, so instead of showing you the usual Photos window, it will open something like this:\n\nClick on that Open Library... button and find your old library as described above. \n\nA: I know this is most likely too late to be of use to you but I thought others in your situation might benefit from the information. The Photos application stores your movies and images inside a single database file that is located in the Pictures folder.\n/User/YOUR_USERNAME/Pictures/Photos Library.photolibrary\nTo get to your data you need to right-click on Photos Library.photolibrary, choose \"Show Package Contents\", and then look in the following locations:\nImages: \n\n/User/YOUR_USERNAME/Pictures/Photos \n  Library.photolibrary/resources/media/version\n\nVideo: \n\n/User/YOUR_USERNAME/Pictures/Photos\n  Library.photolibrary/resources/media/master\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Upgrade to El Capitan? I'm on Yosemite at the moment I want to upgrade but I fear it will break my applications. I have a MacBook Pro (Late 2011) 15''. The last time I updated my Logic Pro 8 broke and I was forced to pay $200 for Logic Pro X (it is my theory that Apple did that on purpose) but either way, what is your suggestion on the Operating System nonsense?\n\nA: I haven’t heard of any apps that work in 10.10 and don’t work in 10.11. Certainly not mainstream apps. Roaringapps.com shows no applications with a “doesn’t work” for 10.11\n", "Q: Mac Pro 4,1 CPU upgrade I own a Mac Pro 4,1 (single socket) with a Nehalem Quad-Core CPU.\nI'd like to upgrade it with a six-core Westmere processor.\nNow, what I have to do prior to installation of the Westmere processor?\nIs firmware upgrade to 5,1 really mandatory? Is there other stuff to upgrade?\n\nA: This post at the macrumors forum lists which CPUs are capatible, outlines the various issues with upgrading, and has links to detailed guides on the upgrade process, including the firmware upgrade. \nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-pro-cpu-compatibility-list.1954766/\nRead everything through before starting and you should be fine. I spent a lot of time making sure I had it all clear in my head before buying the processors and starting the job. Double check everything and ask questions(I recommend the same site again) if you are unsure about something. Drop me a line if you are having problems finding a particular guide and I will see what I can dig up and upgrade the answer here if relevant. I used lidded CPUs and did the 'washer stack' method mentioned on the site to upgrade my 4,1 with few problems following the guide on how to tighten down the heat sinks. De-lidded CPUs cost quite a bit more and are not worth it IMHO, or worth the risk of de-lidding them yourself. YMMV.\nThe firmware upgrade to a 5,1 is very simple and required to use Westmere processors. It is the easiest part of the upgrade. In fact you can do it all by itself without upgrading anything else with the system and you computer will for a practicable purposes be identical to a 5,1.\nI upgraded my system last year with two Westmere four core Dual Xeon X5677 3.46Ghz CPUs from two Nehalem four core E5520 Xeon at 2.26Ghz. I decided that the additional cost of going to hex core processors was not worth it to me for the work I do. It was over twice the cost for used hex core processors at the time and they would have had a slightly slower clock speed. Your needs may differ and I'm sure that prices now are very different. Seeing that you are on a single processor system, a hex core may make more sense for you as you wont have to double the CPU cost by buying two as I had too. Watch the prices for a few weeks to see where the market is at and to get the best pice performance ratio that fits your needs.\nAlso consider upgrading your Video Card if you haven't already. There is a post at the same site with a guide on what PC cards work and which don't with work arounds and any problems or limitations. It is very long, but worth digging through. \nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/threads/frequently-asked-questions-about-nvidia-pc-non-efi-graphics-cards.1440150/\nAnother tip for upgrading is to look for used, registered server RAM. Registered RAM must must all be the same type; you can't mix it with unregistered DIMMS. Normally it is more expensive, but because the type of DIMM the 4,1 and 5,1 uses are quite old now, not being able to mix it, and the motherboard must specifically support registered RAM(which the Mac Pros do, most consumer machines don't), you can find it really cheap from people parting out PC servers on ebay. I can't remember the price, but I upgraded to 24GB(six 4GB 1333 DIMMs) for not much money at all.\nThe forums mentioned have loads of information and the people are willing to help, just be sure to read up about the process as much as you can before posting a question. Like many forums out there, they will jump on you a bit if you didn't take the time to read the available information beforehand and jumped straight to asking simple questions. Make yourself informed. Don't be put off, this is a doable upgrade and has brought a lot of life to my old system. This era of Mac pros were so well designed and I love to see their life extended. If you really get lost after spending some time gathering information, drop me a line and I'll see if I can point you in the right direction. Good luck.\n\nA: I believe you have to update it so the motherboard will recognize the newer CPU's.  I did a 6-core upgrade to my 2012 (which is a 2010) Mac Pro and it has worked beautifully.\nYou might also need to watch the heatsink tightening process.  I remember reading something about some of the replacement CPU's being taller than the stock CPU's because Apple didn't order processors with lids.  I know that was the case with some upgraded XServes, but I believe the replacement I got for my Pro matched what I took out.\n", "Q: How to install ssmtp on mac?

I'm guessing the only way is to compile it from source code but I'm not sure where to get the source code and what commands to run.\n\nA: As you said, the only option is to compile the source code.\nYou can download from the project repository on github. There is a download button there.\nTo install it, your have to uncompress the downloaded file. Once done, cd to sSMTP-master directory.\nThe generic compilation process is executing the following commands one by one:\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nThe configure command can be altered with lots of parameters.

I have a Mid-2009 MacBookPro, I would like to upgrade the AirPort Card so that I can access continuity and instant hotspot features, but other than that what will Bluetooth 4.0 allow me and will the AirPort Card also improve my Wi-Fi range/speed on my laptop?\n\nA: I upgraded the built-in WiFi cards for my 2008 and 2012 Mac Pros.  It got me Continuity and the higher 802.11ac speeds, along with AirDrop (peer-to-peer WiFi).\nTo enjoy 802.11ac speeds (up to 1300Mbps if you're sitting right next to it), you need to also upgrade your router or access point (hereafter referred to as AP).  You also have to have a fast enough Internet connection (or have high-speed internal network needs) to warrant anything faster than 802.11n, as most ISP's don't provide connections over 200Mbps.  (802.11n specs are 300Mbps on 5GHz band of RF throughput, which yields just over 150Mbps of actual data throughput on good days.)\nYou don't get improved range without improved antennas; in this case your laptop's antennas won't change, so the AP would have to have better antennas than what you have now.  \n-- And here's more nerdiness just in case anyone is curious... --\nSpeed is a combination of RF bandwidth (20MHz - 80MHz wide channels) and modulation (the way the bits are encoded into radio waves).  Higher modulation over larger swaths of RF bandwidth = awesome speed.\nBecause of WiFi regulations, the amount of power available for transmission is fixed.  Wider channels means less power (the power is spread across 80MHz channels in 802.11ac instead of 40MHz in 802.11n or 20MHz in 802.11g). The highest speeds are right next to the AP, naturally.\nAs the client radio (laptop or phone) gets further away from the AP (distance + obstacles), it will \"downshift\" from the higher bandwidths and modulations to the lower bandwidths and modulations until it eventually drops off.\n", "Q: How to eliminate Internet lapses on my MacBook Air 13? I have a MacBook Air 13 (mid 2012) running OS X El Capitan (10.11.3).  I connect to the Internet using a Virgin Mobile Netgear Mingle hotspot.  During Internet browsing sessions I will at times experience a browser session which appears to be frozen.  This is noticed when I try to go to a link exhibited on the page that I am viewing and the connection isn't successful.  The browser shows that it is trying to connect, but eventually the new connection fails.  During the time the browser is frozen like this, I can open a new tab and try to connect to www.google.com, and that connection will fail also.  If this happens while using Firefox, switching to Safari has the same experience (Safari also acts as if frozen).  Or vice versa.\nI can successfully ping external servers (e.g. youtube.com) during the period when the browsers are not connecting (the ping is done via a Terminal window).  I can use my wife's MacBook Air 11 (mid 2012, OS X Yosemite) and on it, Safari can connect to www.google.com during the time that the browser on the MacBook Air 13 cannot make connections.  Her MacBook Air 11 is using the same Virgin Mobile Netgear Mingle hotspot.  Checking wifi channel on both MacBook Airs has shown the channel # to be the same, so that seems to rule out channel interference as the problem.  During a lapse on 2/15/16 I used the Mingle Hotspot Manager to change the channel from 6 to 11.  The lapse continued, unabated.\nWhen the browsers are frozen, the \"App Store\" appears to be frozen as well.\nI run Wireless Diagnostics during the freeze and look at its \"Performance\" graphs and detect nothing out of the ordinary.  The situation is self-correcting, it seems, if I wait long enough.  Or, I can restart the computer.  Toggling wifi off and on doesn't correct the freeze. Quitting the browser and restarting it doesn't correct the freeze.\nI've researched this problem on the Internet, but I haven't found any suggested solution that corrects the freeze.\nThese freezes exhibited themselves with OS X Yosemite as well (10.10.5), prior to upgrading OS X to El Capitan.\nI have noted a correlation of these freezes with the failure of an application to Quit properly (as noted by its appearance in the Force Quit list (Command + Option + Escape) after Quit has been used).\nI attach an output from Wireless Diagnostics Info during one of these freezes. \n\n\nA: I now believe that these lapses/freezes can be blamed on the network setup that I was using.  My brother visited and with his Dell laptop running a version of Microsoft Windows the same thing happened.  I've since switched to a different Internet provider and haven't had the problem again.  The first Internet provider is in the process of discontinuing its service.\n", "Q: Apple Music splash screen won't go away! I can't get to my music on my iPad because whenever I launch the app I get a splash screen for Apple Music with no apparent buttons or links to get past it. Does anyone know how to get out of this? (Restarting the iPad doesn't seem to help.)\n\nA: This happens when the Music app cannot connect to the internet on its first startup. \nMake sure the Music app can access the internet (connect to a WiFi or enable mobile data usage for the Music app in the settings). A button to skip the message will appear. Once you skip it the message won't appear a second time (at least not until you update again).\n\nA: I believe in Settings -> Music you can disable Apple Music.  Perhaps that would be enough to hide the splash screen and move on.\nCome to think of it, the splash screen came up on my iPhone, but it asked me to log back in.  It wouldn't go anywhere after putting in my credentials.  I think I eventually went back and tapped the \"not right now\" link (or whatever the wording is) and got into the app.\n", "Q: Different Apple ID contacts appear on my device I got a new iPhone for Christmas and made my own Apple ID/iCloud so I could use it between my devices (I also have a Mac & an iPad) without sharing with my family. Today I realized that many of my parents' email & phone contacts have synced to my phone & iPad. When I try to deselect their groups on the contacts app, all of my contacts are removed. I have been using iCloud to backup pictures, etc., and it is all my own - no one else uses my Apple ID. I want get rid of the extra contacts without individually deleting them. \n\nA: At some point somebody used your Apple ID on one of their devices (either OSX or iOS), or their Apple ID on one of your devices.  Or, somebody might have connected your or their iPhone in your or their iTunes in the past.\nAnd things got mixed up.  If you don't have a local iTunes backup, there's not too much you can do to recover.  And if you have a local backup chances are that it was made after the damage was done.\nHaving had the same mishap in the past, I have a couple 1000's pictures of my wife's iPhone mixed up with my personal collection.\nIf this is not enough, chances are (albeit small) that one of those devices is still connected to your Apple ID and syncing is still going on.\nMy following suggestion might seem stupid and short sighted, but if I were you, I would\n\n\n*\n\n*change my Apple ID password\n\n*Delete all contacts on your device(s)\n\n*Add all your contacts again from the beginning\n\n\nI understand that, if there's a lot of data involved, adding your contacts piece by piece can be quite time consuming, but the effort might be worth it.\nIf you have access to a Mac, things can be facilitated quite a bit:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use the native Contacts app to export your current data\nto csv, import it in Excel and manipulate chunks of data much\nquicker.\n\n*Busy Contacts can do some of\nthis for you, and it also can sync with other online addressbook\nservices.

This would allow people to listen to music together without going through speakers and mics, and to record to logic without having to upload a song file, e.g. the main output would be one track and the mic would be another, for a little two track action.  But on the skype side, you could turn the music vs. mic volume up or down to hear more of one vs the other.  It seems like this should be possible, but execution is way out of my league.  Anybody think it's doable?\n\nA: Use either Audio Hijack, SoundFlower, or Loopback.\n", "Q: USB wireless keyboard works from one USB port, but not the other I have a wireless USB keyboard/mouse combo (Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 1000) which is working perfectly on a 2013 MacBook Air running Yosemite, the keyboard & mouse work perfectly - but only when the USB receiver is plugged into the right-hand USB port.\n\nWhen it's plugged into the left-hand USB port it doesn't respond to the mouse or keyboard at all. The left-hand USB port works for other devices such as a USB hard disk. \nSo, the left-hand USB port is working, and the keyboard/mouse is working (including on a separate MacBook), but they're not working together. This is a pain due to the configuration of my desk, otherwise I'd just live with it.\nI've tried resetting the SMC and NVRAM but this has no effect. Any ideas for how to debug this further?\n\nA: You can look at the USB device tree using the System Information application, launched either from the \"System Report\" button in the \"About this Mac\" dialog, or by looking in /Applications/Utilities.\nSelect usb from the sidebar and it will display the device tree. See if you get different information when you reconfigure your devices. \nAlso look in the system log (via Console.app also in utilities) to see if there are any messages when you change your config.\n", "Q: Apple Script to Export from application I'm new to AppleScript and wanted to export my citations using AppleScript.

I noticed something very strange which is that 1) when I am dong very basic tasks such as downloading something for the new MacBook Pro, it occupies 6 GB of memory used and 2) the CPU usage seems to be high compared to my MacBook Pro with 2.7 GHz when doing the same thing (i.e.: downloading same sized files and size). \nWhy is this the case? Most curiously, I'm wondering why the memory used for the new MacBook Pro is at 6 GB when simply downloading something.\n\nA: It is rather difficult to compare a fresh 'cold' new system with a 'warm' fully synchronized and updated one.  New Macs have a lot of catching up to do; iCloud service syncing and system patches being two of them.\nOn the other hand OSX - and every other OS really - chooses a healthy part of the available RAM (real, physical memory) above swapping to disk (virtual memory) for obvious reasons.  Having 8 more Gigs available probably decreased your swap file by a couple gigs.  Granted, swapping to those post-2013 SSD's is reasonably fast, but no (or less) swapping is always faster (and better for your battery).\nChances are high your increased RAM usage is part of those 2 reasons.\n", "Q: Applescript change folder and terminal commands I have tried the following but cannot seem to get this to work: \ndo script \"cd ~/desktop/test; for x in ls -1 | sed -e 's/^\\(.\\).*/\\1/' | sort -u; do mv -i ${x}?* $x done\"\n\nI'm wanting to perform this command in applescript.

I wanted to ask how to install websploit in the Mac's terminal. I have downloaded the file from WebSploit Framework.  \n\nA: You didn't say what the name of the file you downloaded was or its URL, (Are we just supposed to guess?).  Assuming it was the WebSploit-Framework-3.0.0.tar.gz file from WebSploit Framework, under normal circumstances* you'd simply unpack the file by double-clicking it and it should create a folder named websploit containing two files, install.sh and wsf-300.tar.gz. To install it you'd run the install.sh in a Terminal.  Note: install.sh requires being root to run the script, so you'd run:\ncd ~/Downloads/websploit #assuming you extracted the tar.gz to your Download folder\nsudo ./install.sh\n\n\n\n*\n\n**For versions previous to OS X 10.11 it should be a straight install as described above.\nFor OS X 10.11 herein lies the issue, under normal circumstances the install.sh script copies the wsf-300.tar.gz file to /usr/share and then finishes the install. However, under OS X 10.11.x with the exception of /usr/local the rest of /usr is protected by System Integrity Protection (SIP) which restricts the root account and limits the actions that the root user can perform on protected parts of filesystem under OS X. So in this use case it will probably not install unless you temporarily disable SIP, install the package and reenable SIP.  That said though, once it's installed it may not function properly once SIP is reenabled.  I say that as I don't have OS X 10.11 to test with and see if anything needs to be written to the /usr/share/websploit/ hierarchical directory structure after the install and during its use it might not be allowed.\nOther then temporarily disable SIP to install it, the only suggestion I have is to edit the install.sh script changing /usr/share to /usr/local/share and this way you shouldn't have to temporarily disable SIP.\nAlso where it says echo \"Run From Terminal : sudo websploit\" in the script, this is a message that's echoed and since /usr/local/share/websploit is not in the $PATH that command is not going to work as written.  You will need to resolve this issue as well and it can be done by adding /usr/local/share/websploit/ to the $PATH, otherwise you'd have to type sudo /usr/local/share/websploit/websploit to actually run websploit.\n", "Q: 3xHDMI out of a single Thunderbolt port - 2015 MBP I'm planning on purchasing 3 HDMI monitors to use as a workstation for my MBP.

I read through the man page but there seems to be no way to extract the file tags from the source file or am I missing something?\nI was able to extract the information via mdls but this isn't getting me anywhere. Also, I found about xattr and tried to apply extended attributes this way but the option -x seems to be removed and applying the attribute without that option doesn't work either.\n\nA: I needed this too—also after running FFmpeg!—so I wrote a shell script to do it. It’s not very quick, and it won’t work if any individual attribute contains more than about 128 KB of data. (Behind the scenes, it’s encoding each attribute value in hexadecimal to make sure that binary data is copied correctly.) It worked fine for my needs, though.\nSave this to a file called copy_xattrs:\n#!/usr/bin/env zsh\n\nif [[ $# -ne 2 ]]; then\n    print >&2 \"usage: copy_xattrs SOURCE_FILE TARGET_FILE\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nset -e\n\nIFS=$'\\n' attr_names=($(xattr \"$1\"))\nfor attr in $attr_names; do\n    value=$(xattr -p -x \"$attr\" \"$1\" | tr -d \" \\n\")\n    xattr -w -x \"$attr\" \"$value\" \"$2\"\ndone\n\nThen run chmod u+x copy_xattrs to make it executable.

The failure probability is comparable to a RAID0.\nHere is a comparison for 1, 2 or 3 disks:\nSurvival probability (for new disks and being optimistic):\nNr of disks  1st year 2nd year 3rd year 4th year 5th year\n          1       98%      90%      83%      78%      73%\n          2       97%      82%      69%      61%      54%\n          3       95%      74%      57%      47%      40%\n\nConsidering that at least one drive is already 5 years old the survival probability is even worse. So better get a reliable backup drive!\n\nA deleted question invisible for some or most users asks for a speed test. A (Super)Fusion Drive is no RAID0/5/6, so r/w speed directly depends on the physical disk written to/read from. Usually at least 4 GB of the SSD are kept free. One can expect that the first ~4 GB written to the DYI SuperFusion Drive are transferred with SSD speed (150-550 MB/s) and the rest with HDD speed (20-120 MB/s). The read speed depends on the location of the files (i.e. SSD or HDD) and is similar to the write speed. \n", "Q: Mouse moves vertically on login OS X El Capitan 10.11.3 - USB mouse (steelseries Sensei)\nWhen trying to move the cursor, the movement is limited only to vertical direction.

I've got an early 2011 MacBook Pro (8,1) and I am trying to install the newest EFI firmware upgrade, however it only supports 10.8.5 and 10.9.5. \nUnfortunately I have no clue as to what the best course of action would be to get this installed. I really need this firmware upgrade, to get access to Apple's Internet Recovery system.\nAny tips or pointers would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: First check your current Firmware and SMC version About your Mac -> More -> System Report. Check the Boot ROM and the SMC version. It should look similar to this:\n\nThe latest Boot ROM version for your MacBookPro8,1 (Early 2011) is MBP81.0047.B2A and the latest SMC version 1.69f4 (SMC 1.7).\nIf you get the same versions the latest EFI updates are already installed.\n\nThe most secure method is to swap the internal hard disk with a spare 2.5\" drive and install Mountain Lion or Mavericks.\nThen download Mac EFI Security Update 2015-001 and install it.\nAfter a reboot the firmware will be updated. Shut down your Mac after the successful update and swap the drives again.\nRecheck the Boot ROM version and the SMC version.\n\nA: WARNING: THIS COULD POTENTIALLY MAKE YOUR COMPUTER UNUSABLE IF THE FIRMWARE DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY.

Apparently Internet Recovery doesn't play well with those (another link).\nDid that new hard drive have OS X installed or not? If not, it wouldn't be able to boot for obvious reasons. Just to make sure.\nHave you tried creating a bootable version of Apple Hardware Test?\n", "Q: Hide bookmarks bar on iOS I am using iPad and the bookmarks bar takes up too much space on screen.

For every new session in OS X terminal, I have to make my proxy settings again.  I do this by entering the command\nexport http_proxy=\"username:password@ip address:port number\"\n\nIs there a way to make these proxy settings once for all?\n\nA: Your http proxy (just for some web sites not https ones and not for the rest of the internet) can be set for each terminal session by adding the line\nexport http_proxy=\"username:password@ip address:port number\"\n\nto your ~/.bash_profile file if using bash (the default from Panther to Mojave) or for later macOS the default shell is zsh and the file to use is ~/.zshrc\nNote this will only affect command line programs.\n\nA: Set system-wide HTTP proxy\nTo globally set an http proxy system-wide on MacOS (not just for a terminal session) you can use:\nnetworksetup -setwebproxy wi-fi localhost 8080\nnetworksetup -setwebproxystate wi-fi on\n\n\nThis assumes your network interface is called wi-fi (or Wi-Fi), and that your proxy is running on localhost on port 8080.\n\nTo disable the proxy:\nnetworksetup -setwebproxystate wi-fi off\n\nThis is equivalent to setting the proxy via mac system settings > Network > wi-fi > Advanced > Proxies > Web proxy.\nSet system-wide SOCKS5 proxy\nnetworksetup -setsocksfirewallproxy wi-fi localhost 1080\nnetworksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate wi-fi on\n\nTo disable the socks proxy use:\nnetworksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate wi-fi off\n\nGetting the correct network interface name\nAll the commands above assume your netowork interface is wi-fi. If you are connected via ethernet then most likely the interface will be en<SOME_NUMBER> e.g. en0 and you'll need to use that instead of wi-fi.\nTo find the active network interface see what comes as the first non-disabled interface when you type:\nnetworksetup -listnetworkserviceorder\n\nAlternatively, you can use ifconfig or networksetup -listallhardwareports. See more.\n\nIf you need a GUI wrapper for setting the HTTP/SOCKS/PAC proxies then check out this answer. The bitbar script linked in the answer also contains the commands for setting a SOCK5 or PAC proxy. Update: Bitbar has been renamed to xbar — it's an open-source GUI for text-mode scripts written in bash/applescript/node/golang/etc.\n\n\nA: I'm assuming you mean aliases, not proxys.\nAdd it to ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile.

I have a directory structure of about 12GB on a network drive that I'd like to copy to my iCloud storage. I don't want to copy the 12GB from the network drive to my local iCloud drive folder just so it can be copied from there to iCloud. \nOther cloud storage services (e.g., Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox) support a browser upload interface that makes it possible to drag folders to be copied into cloud storage onto the browser, but I can't find an equivalent kind of functionality for iCloud. Is there some way for me to directly copy my data from its current location on a network drive into iCloud?\nI'm running 64-bit Windows 7 Professional.\n\nA: It is possible to do what you want.\nToday I'm running 64-bit Windows 10 Pro but I believe the following is possible also running 64-bit Windows 7 Professional.\nTo copy a directory structure on a network drive or an external drive to your iCloud Drive storage (on Apples servers) without first copying the whole directory structure and all its files to your local iCloud Drive folder do this:\nUse the MKLINK command in a \"command prompt window\" to create a directory junction in your local iCloud drive folder pointing to your directory structure on the network drive.\nExample:\nMKLINK /J %USERPROFILE%\\iCloudDrive\\JunctionName S:\\FolderToUploadToICloud\n\nReplace \"JunctionName\" to anyting you like and \"S:\\FolderToUploadToICloud\" with the path to your directory structure on your network drive. \nThe junction will take up no space in the local iCloud folder. It's just a pointer to the target directory structure on your network drive. \n\nA: As of macOS Sierra 10.12.5 (and the equivalent iCloud for Windows), iCloud Drive does not offer a facility for selective-sync of files between your local storage and the cloud.\nTherefore, anything you upload to iCloud Drive using the web interface would then make its way back down to your local storage on any machine logged in to iCloud.\niCloud Drive doesn’t appear to be the archival storage solution you’re looking for. It’s a full-syncing service.\n\nA: iCloud does have a web interface for drive - I believe it was recently added. \nLog into iCloud.com with your ID and password, and it should be the fifth box. \n\nBTW, iCloud only gives you 5 GB for free, so if you haven't yet you'll have to buy more space if you want your drive to fit on iCloud.\nEDIT 1: iCloud does not support folder uploads in iCloud Drive. Thanks to the OP KnowItAllWannabe for pointing that out. \n\nA: I know that the question was asked almost 5 years ago, but recently I was in a situation similar to what the OP wanted - uploading a folder directly to iCloud.\nWhat worked for me was I uploaded a zip file of the folder I wanted to keep in iCloud and then on my iPhone, I unzipped it - this created a new folder on my iCloud Drive and I then deleted the zip file.\nThough I have to agree, it is a hassle to directly upload folders on the iCloud Web Interface.\nHope I answered the question!\n\nA: I am writing this post in the hope that it saves people from going down the wrong path as I did.\nI've been an \"all in\" Apple user for 2 years now and something that has bothered me from day one is that I couldn't work out how to upload folders to iCloud Drive. After searching the web and talking to Apple Support I literally thought this was not possible which lead me to question how anyone could realistically use iCloud Drive.\nAnyway, it turns out while it is not possible to upload folders to iCloud Drive via a web browser (an expected behaviour which after 3 years of users asking for, should really be implemented). You can however do this very easily by just installing the iCloud App for Windows. It works perfectly and in a simple drag and drop manor I was able to upload a handful of folders & subfolders including all their contents. \nWhat annoys me is, for 2 years I thought this was not possible. I even spoke to Apple Support on twitter and while they confirmed you could not do this via a web browser, they didn't point me in the direction of using the app.\nI'm now off to buy some cloud storage to enjoy iCloud along with the rest of my Apple products and services. Happy Days \n", "Q: Does iPad 3 supports wireless charging? I am wondering if iPad 3 or any iPad version supports wireless charging?\nCan I use samsung's w'less  charger for it?\n\nA: Not natively no.

I have set up a system-wide socks proxy in Preferences -> Network. How can I tell if some app follows or bypasses the system proxy setting. I need this because I have a program ported from Windows that seems bypassing the system proxy and I wish to check that.\n\nA: You can try to run a proxy server locally, and change your Network preferences to point to that proxy, and check in the proxy logs to see if the app sends its request through it.\nI would suggest using Charles.\nIt's quite easy to use: just change our proxy settings in Network preferences to either HTTP proxy localhost:8888 or SOCKS proxy localhost:8889, and you should start seeing outgoing requests if you use your browser.\nOnce you do, try using your custom app to see if it sends its request through the proxy or not.\nBest of luck.\n", "Q: Does one Thunderbolt port mean I can only add one additional screen? My iMac (mid 2011) looks to have one Thunderbolt connection. Does this mean I can only add one additional screen?\n\nA: Thunderbolt is a serial bus and can be chained, so only having one port does not mean you can only have additional monitor. Assuming the Thunderbolt monitor has two Thunderbolt ports you can use the second one to chain the two monitors in series Thus having 3 monitors (2 external and one from your iMac).\nHow many monitors (and which resolution)can be driven by your iMac depends on your specific model though.\n", "Q: Cannot Run GUI AppleScripts I recently upgraded my system to OS X 10.11 El Capitan and ever since, my AppleScript which enables GUI scripting cannot be run. Part of the reason is obvious, the Universal Access pane in System Preferences has changed, i.e. there is no longer a checkbox to enable it. I would like to know how do I enable it in this newer system?\nI found a shell script, which is supposed to work with Yosemite, but it does not work with my system. Anyone have an idea? I would think it would not be necessary to use the shell. Isn't there some way to click on some checkbox and, if necessary, enter your system password?\n\nA: OK, it's kind of embarrasing, in a way, when you figure out the answer to your own question, but, here it is:\nYou just go to the Security and Privacy pane, click on the Privacy tab, and then add the apps where you want to allow GUI scripting. Just that simple....\n\nA: There is not.  Individual applications are now given access to the Accessibility features, there is no global control.\nAs you can see there is a + icon to allow you to add an application.  You can also have your script add itself.\nAnother method: http://www.macosautomation.com/mavericks/guiscripting/index.html\n", "Q: Bootcamp: Bluescreen after installing drivers For a week now I have been trying to install Windows on my late 2011 MacBook Pro 15\". After struggling through the whole installation part (see here), I finally managed to boot into Windows 8.1. \nFirst thing I saw was the Bootcamp drivers installer. The first few times I actually tried running it, but It would always result in a BSOD when trying to install the Intel HD drivers. The BSOD would always say SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED (igdkmd64.sys). My Windows installation was broken every time this BSOD occurred (Boots into blackscreen and reboots after 5-10s).\nI eventually found out that removing the IntelHDLegacyGraphics64.exe file from /BootCamp/Drivers/Intel on my installation device would (temporarily) fix that screen.\nWith the bootcamp drivers installed (actually without them too, but I couldn't use things like wifi then), I was now finally able to actually boot onto the desktop, but there would always be this little error message from AMD catalyst that there was some kind of error with my graphics drivers. At first, I tried to fix this by going to device manager and updating the drivers of my graphics card, but I would always get the same igdkmd64.sys BSOD, which rendered my Windows installation useless. Also, I did not find any \"Intel HD\" devices in the device manager, even with \"show hidden devices\" turned on.\nAfter 5 or so more installations, I noticed that the BSOD would occur 5-10 Minutes after boot regardless of what I would do, as long as I didn't do nothing. I couldn't even run Windows Update for the same reason (I unchecked the Intel HD drivers update).\nThe frustrating thing for me is, that even if I do not have a igdkmd64.sys driver installed (I checked) it still crashes with this file given as as reason. I some installations, I actually found that file and tried deleting/renaming/moving it, but it would always reappear after a reboot.\nEdit:\nI installed Windows 8.1 64 bit from a USB flash drive created with the BootCamp Assistant, which also downloaded the support software. I also tried installing Windows 8, but this resulted in it blackscreening after ~20s and restarting in the setup (where you are asked to enter your username and such).\n\nA: It is hard to answer your questions. Mostly, because you have not fully answer my questions. I am going to guess that you are trying to install Windows to boot using the EFI firmware interface instead of the legacy BIOS interface. If so, you have not been the first to try. It is really not a question of whether or not you can get Windows to boot using the EFI, but rather what method the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" expects you to use. \nI did an experiment last night. I have a mid 2011 iMac. The \"Boot Camp Support Software\" for 64 bit Windows 7 is version 5.1.5621. Your Mac would use the same software. My internet connection is 40 Mbps so downloading was not a problem. I also used the Boot Camp Assistant running under OS X 10.11 to download the software to a flash drive. I then compared every single file using windiff.exe. The files are identical. This is not proof that version 5.1.5621 do not contain any EFI drivers, but I do not think the drivers have not changed since the release of Windows 7. When Windows 7 was released, no Macs were booting Windows using the EFI. \nOS X does not boot using the EFI specification. To use the specification, OS X would have to store software in the FAT formatted EFI partition. It does not. OS X does not even require a EFI partition to boot. The firmware is capable to reading HFS formatted partitions and recognizing the OS X operating system. Many Linux operating system take advantage of this. Fedora, for example, appears to the Mac firmware to be OS X. Once loaded, it transfers control to grub to finish the booting process.\nIn the end, I think you are trying to do something that can not be done. If your MBP was a year newer, the story would probably be different.\n", "Q: How can I back up my iPhone without Wi-Fi? I assume there is something wrong with the battery in my iPhone 4, because it will not stay on unless it's plugged into the charger. \nI have about 1,000 pictures on my phone, and when my phone is plugged in, I can look at them, and still use my phone somewhat normally but my phone will not connect to Wi-Fi. \nIs there any way I can keep my phones pictures if I have to get a new phone, without doing an iCloud backup? \n\nA: You can back up to iTunes on your Mac or PC desktop or laptop directly over USB.\nConnect the device over USB to iTunes, select your device in the toolbar and click Back Up Now.\n\nA: In addition to the other answer which allows you to do a general backup of your phone which may include your photos, you can also download your photos directly to your computer with software such as Picasa (from Google) or Apple software like Image Capture (in Utilities) or iPhoto (which may also be known as Photos). These methods will also preserve the full resolutions of your photos. Obviously, you will need to have a computer on hand and have your phone plugged into it.\nYou may also want to check in iPhoto to see if there is a photo stream that already has all of your photos online.\nAnother option, if you still have cellular data, is to download Google's Photos app (or Google+ if you have an old enough version of that app) and you can choose the option to back up all of your photos, optionally over cellular, but that would use up a lot of data.\n", "Q: Apple TV play media stored on Airport Extreme hard drive? The current gen Airport Extreme (802.11ac, you know... the tall white one) is capable of having a network accessible hard drive connected directly to it. Now that the new Apple TV can run apps, can I use the Airport's connected hard drive as a media server and have the new Apple TV access its content directly? Maybe by running the Plex app (or similar)?\n\nA: VLC should do the trick. I confirmed I can access the drive inside my Time Capsule using VLC on my Apple TV.\nI imagine it will also access the files on a USB-connected drive. Not tested the latter though. \n\nA: To use plex, you must install Plex Media Server from their  website  it takes care of all transcoding of content, and just takes it from connected drives. \n\nA: I'm using Infuse to play media from the Time Capsule and it is way better than the VLC.\n", "Q: PyCharm seems to install but won't run This is my first OS X experience so I'm not sure what to do other than ask you guys.

Only then does it help to make sure that the account is enabled.\nI have the same problem now, where all contacts sync fine, but the groups do not and I have more than hundred groups and more than 3100 contacts. Going to the iCloud account via browser I can see that all is fine, on my iOS devices (iOS 10.3.3), all groups are shown fine. Only on my 2nd El Capitan Mac OS X 10.11.6 the groups do not show up, only the contacts. I have disabled/enabled the account, I have signed out and allowed that process to delete all contacts and other data on the Mac, and I have even gone to drastic measures such as deleting all AddressBook support folders in the Library, allowing the systems to rebuild them from scratch after reboots and doing this all in safe mode. All to no avail. The groups do not sync to my El Capitan Mac.\n", "Q: cpu is 100% used, yet no application shows significant usage Since a few days my IMac started showing weird behaviour.\nIn Activity Monitor it shows that my CPU is 100% used. Literally 0% idle, but there are no Applications using anywhere near this much resources.\nThe highest percentage would be from Activity Monitor itself, but this just uses 2.5% at max.\nThe amount of CPU used is shared over 'User' and 'System' they both use around 50% CPU at the same time.\nAlso, the amount of threads running is around 300 to 375, but the sum of all running applications their threads doesn't go over 100.\nMy question is:\nIs there any explanation for this behaviour?\nAnd can I do something against this? \nInfo about my Mac:\nOS : Mac OS X 10.7.5\nCPU : 3.06 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo\nMemory : 4 GB 1067 MHz RAM\n(iMac Late 2009)\nEDIT:\nAfter making sure that I was looking at 'All Processes' that are running on my iMac, I found that Norton Deepsight was causing a big part of my issue.\nBy changing a setting in my Norton-AntiVirus I managed to take atleast 50% of CPU usage away.\nYet my System is still using around 50% to 60% of CPU, which is caused by 'kernel_task' and 'SymDaemon'\nIs there a clear reason to why these to processes are using this much CPU?\n\nA: Thanks to some helpful answers I managed to find the answers to this question.\nThe main cause of this CPU usage is Norton AntiVirus.\nA Setting in the AntiVirus called 'Norton Deepsight Community Submission' makes it constantly use around 50% CPU, just to collect data and send this to Norton I guess.\nThe other 50% is also caused by Norton AntiVirus, yet I am not a 100% sure which setting or process causes this.\nHopefully this helps other people in the future.\nMany thanks to the commenters on my main post, which helped me find the cause of this problem. \n", "Q: How not to miss the elimination of Optical Audio Output from 3rd to 4th gen Apple TV I speculate that the audio signal at the Optical Audio Out of the 3rd generation Apple TV is always the same audio signal within the HDMI output.\nI further speculate that that's the reason behind eliminating the Optical Audio Out connector in the 4th generation Apple TV.\nHence one does not need to worry about losing Optical-Out when replacing an ATV3 with an ATV4 provided that either:\n\n\n*\n\n*the TV has Audio Return Channel (ARC), which would take the audio signal from HDMI and pass it onto the receiver. (Here I'm thinking of a user who never uses the audio amplifier on the TV and who always switches the receiver on, even when watching TV.) ARC is important since you wouldn't want to keep the TV on during all the time you're just listening to music.\n\n*the receiver has HDMI input (older receivers don't). If the receiver has HDMI input/output, then the ATV4's HDMI would connect to the receiver and from there to the TV. Hence, again, the TV can remain off while you're listening to music.\n\n\nIs my understanding correct? Am I missing something?\nHere is the setup I have in mind:\n\nAs you can see, there is no \"return\" involved here. So the feature that I'm looking for could more plausibly be called \"audio pass-through\". This audio pass-through works fine when a TV is on (by necessity!). The question then is what guarantees there are for it to continue working when a TV is off.\n\nA: The understanding in the question is correct.\nWith a very recent somewhat-high-end LG TV, I have been unable to find or to activate a feature that functions like Active Return Channel, nor one that is called a synonym of ARC or \"pass through\".\nThe conclusion is that when Apple omitted Optical Audio Out on the most recent Apple TV 4, they were basically assuming that those using an ATV4 to listen to music will upgrade their receiver and buy one centered on HDMI connections. Given the expected lifetime (and price) of nicer receivers, this is not necessarily a good thing, and so you may be better off with an ATV3 than an ATV4, until you're ready to upgrade your receiver.\nBut there is one caveat. If you stream your lossless audio files through AirPlay to an Apple TV (either 3 or 4) from your iphone, iPad, or Mac, you are not listening to lossless files on your sound system. This is fairly easy to confirm by a listening test. Presumably Apple designed things that way to conserve bandwidth (strangely, since a quick calculation will reveal that there is more than enough WiFi bandwidth to spare to transmit an audio stream with no further compression). It may even be the case that mp3 (or other lossy) files go through a compression-decompression cycle when they are sent from iOS/OS X to an Apple TV. I haven't been able to confirm this conclusively one way or the other.\nHence if you do listen to Apple-lossless files, you would not want to use AirPlay anyway (and there is no other way to go through the Apple TV). You then need a (dedicated?) iOS/OS X device hooked-by-wire to your receiver, and then it's a moot point whether your TV has ARC. It's even a moot point whether you chose Apple TV over the competition. There is of course a (significant) advantage in using a Mac rather than an iPhone/iPad since Macs provide an optical digital signal out. Using an iOS device (which would anyway be scarce on storage and would introduce its own problems if you hook additional storage) would indeed send a lossless file, but you'd still be losing by using whichever D/A converter Apple uses in their iOS devices. Whether this would be perceptible will vary from one setup to another. \nSequel question: how are things like on the Roku, Amazon Fire TV, and Google Chromecast? Do any of these make it possible to transmit/receive lossless files (perhaps in the non-Apple-centric FLAC) from some device (Android, Linux, Windows, or Mac) without going through a compress-decompress cycle?\n", "Q: Mac Pro 1,1 (2007) Not Updating To El Capitan I recently purchased an old Mac Pro, from eBay to use it as an advanced CPU performance computer as opposed to my 2012 MacBook Air that can't endure much. So far it is working, I have gotten a wireless dongle to connect, and I thought all was good until I went to my App Store to upgrade to El Capitan. When I click \"Get\" on it's page. I get this error:\n\nWe could not complete your purchase.\nThis version of OS X 10.11 cannot be installed on this computer.\n\nI checked the Apple Upgrade page and it is all good. A quick look at the forms, still all good. Even a Google search on other locations on the internet did not help me. So, I have decided to present your ever so luxurious minds with my preposterous issue. I was wondering if any of you knew how to get my Macintosh to update. Is there some stupid mistake I am missing, is it seemingly unfixable? If you need my computer specifications, here they are:\n\nProcessor:  2 x 2.66 GHz Dual-Core Intel Xeon\nMemory:  4 GB 667 MHz DDR2 FB-DIMM\nGraphics:  NVIDIA GeForce 7300 GT 256 MB\nSoftware:  Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 (11G63)\n\nThank you for your efforts in advance.\n\nA: Firstly: putting your serial number up for all to see may not be the best idea.\nYour Mac Pro is an original Mac Pro. This means that it is not compatible with El Cap by default (I'll explain more later.) So yes, there's an error on your part.\nYour MacBook Air is also (sadly) likely about as powerful as that Mac Pro. If you upgrade it, it's possible that you may find a different story, but regardless, that Mac is reaching end-of-life. Depending on your use case, it may be fine to upgrade it, but there's not a lot you can do. Instead, I'd recommend that you save up for either a more powerful PC or Mac.\nWith that said, you can make your Mac Pro work on El Cap if you really want to. It's a little tricky, but possible.\nYour Mac is incompatible because it has a 32-bit EFI firmware and an outdated GPU. Both of these are fixable issues. I would recommend reading this article, but I'll summarize here. By using a different bootloader, you can circumvent issues. Follow the instructions on said page. Your GPU is also unsupported. This means you'll need a new GPU. This is more complicated then you think however. Some cards will require being \"flashed\" as though they're Mac GPUs, while others can do most (but not all) things without it (and can be flashed for more compatibility.) Again, follow the guide in the article.\nI hope this was helpful. Again, this machine–unless it's a fun project–probably isn't worth your time or money. But hey, if you want, go ahead.\n\nA: I had the same issue with my Mac Pro G5 - I have four hard drives in this machine with files dating back almost ten years. \nThe way I have solved the problem is to use \"target mode.\" I use my  MacBook Pro with El Capitan as the boot drive and use the MAC Pro G5 as a storage device - the Mac Pro still boots to Lion but it is controlled by my MacBook Pro. \nThe method I used was via an Ethernet \"7\" connection.  One good thing about doing this is if I want to use a \"retro\" version of an application \nI still can on the Mac Pro. \n", "Q: Where are Passcode Settings for ios 9.2.1 on iphone 5c The location for these options is a mystery.\nRelated questions show \"General | Touch ID and Passcode\" . But my phone only has \nSounds\nPasscode\n\nThe latter only allows changing the passcode .. but has no other settings. So where are those passcode configuration settings?\n\nA: If you go to passcode, then \"change passcode\", you will have these options while entering a new passcode.\n", "Q: Why can't I add artwork to my music in iTunes? I have a few songs that don't have artwork, and would like to manually add the cover art. I'm trying to use iTunes (Get Info > Artwork > Add Artwork). However, the 'Add Artwork' button is grayed out and cannot be clicked. Is there a way to fix this?\n\n\nA: One reason the Add Artwork button can be grayed out when selecting a song in iTunes and then Get Info, is the file does not have write permissions set.\nSelect the song in iTunes and then right-click it, then select Show in Finder.\nIn Finder select the file and then right-click it, then select Get Info.\nUnder the Sharing & Permissions: does it show Read only for you?  If yes change the permissions so you have Read & Write permissions.\nThe image below shows Add Artwork grayed out when the file permissions are set to Read only.\n\nThe image below shows Add Artwork active when the file permissions are set to Read & Write.\n\nIf it shows Read only for you, then click the Lock icon on the Get Info sheet and enter your password and then click the arrow next to the permission for Your Name (Me) and select Read & Write, then click the Lock icon.\n\nAnother reason can be the file type is not one that supports manually embedding artwork, such as a .wav file. That said, artwork should be able to be added through the iTunes Store which will save it separately if it's not a file type that supports embedded art work.\n", "Q: Repair an exFAT drive on Mac OS X after it's been improperly disconnected Very often an exFAT external disk stops appearing in OS X. It doesn't appear in Disk Utility, Finder, diskutil list or About this Mac/System Report/USB.\nThe only way I have found to fix it is to boot into Windows and run the standard 'Scan disk for errors' function that pops up on connecting the drive. It never finds any errors. The disk then appears fine in OS X again.\nIs there a way I can run this repair in OS X? It seems it is just a flag, possibly to indicate the drive was unplugged without first being ejected.\n\nA: I've been having the same problem with my 128GB thumb drive. Turns out, it just takes a while (10-15m) for it to appear in Disk Utility, almost certainly on account of its size. Running First Aid after that gives me no errors (though it takes a similar amount of time to run). Try waiting longer next time, and avoid disconnecting the drive without ejecting first.\n\nA: Same problem here, took a few minutes to load the external drive, but after a long (and tense) time, it finally loaded.\nMy conclusion is that the problem are the not emptied trash files. The drive was working just fine, then I had to delete a lot of files and ejected it without emptying the trash. Next time it was not loading, so I tried in a different MacBook, tried Disk Utility First Aid, tried other solutions found on the internet but nothing worked. After reading the answer here I plugged it and wait a few minutes and it loaded. Then I emptied the trash and everything was back on tracks.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Will a live USB for a Mac run on a chromebook or windows computer? I created a live Kali USB for my Chromebook which single boots ubuntu mate. I was wondering, if I made a live kali(or other linux distribution) for booting on a Mac, so using .img instead of .iso would the .img still work on my Chromebook? \nIn simpler terms will a live USB for OSX still work on a Chromebook or windows.\n\nA: No, the disk should still be able to boot.\nThere isn't actually a difference between the operating system in the .img and .iso. They're just different ways of storing the same information. \nKali(or any other *nix) distro is an operating system, just as Windows and OS X are. Whether or not an operating system will run on a computer is solely dependent on the hardware, not the software already on the computer.\n\nA: If your USB \"drive\" is large enough you should be able to partition it into two volumes. Then install a linux distribution that will run on Mac hardware on one and your ubuntu for your Chromebook on the other. I'm not familiar enough with the boot process of the Chromebook to know if there would be any other snags. \n", "Q: set PATH in terminal OS X 10.11.3 I need to set path /usr/local/gnupg-2.1/bin to the command line.\nI tried to enter \"export PATH=/usr/local/gnupg-2.1/bin:$PATH\" in the command line, but it works until the terminal session ends.\nI tried to create .bash_profile, but I don't know how to create hidden file, where to put it, and what it should contain?\n\nA: Open your terminal an paste de following command:\necho \"export PATH=/usr/local/gnupg-2.1/bin:$PATH\" >> ~/.bash_profile\n\nThis will create the file .bash_profile if does not exists and append your command at the end if the file exists.\nTo create a hidden file you just need to prepend a dot (.) in the file name when you save it (profile -> .profile). That's all you need.\n\nA: .bash_profile resides in your user folder.

Downloaded tor.tar.gz file from torprogect.org. Tor version is 0.2.7.6. Os X 10.11.3. On torproject.org said that it has to be configure with: ./configure && make && src/or/tor. Don't know what does that mean. How do I proceed?\n\nA: Tor Browser\nHave you considered using Tor Browser instead of tor?\n\nThe Tor Browser lets you use Tor on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux without needing to install any software. It can run off a USB flash drive, comes with a pre-configured web browser to protect your anonymity, and is self-contained (portable).\n\nStill need tor? Use brew\nYou can use the homebrew project to install tor on your Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*Follow the instructions on homebrew to install the brew command:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal.app\n\n*Paste in the one line command from brew.sh: \n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\n\n\n*Run the following command to install tor and any dependencies:\nbrew install tor\n\nEasy Removal\nIf you decide later to remove tor, you can use the command:\nbrew uninstall tor\n\nAlternatively, you can probably use MacPorts.\n\nA: *.tar.gz files are gzipped archive files. To unzip/unarchive the file simply double-click it. This will invoke Archive Utility and the file will be extracted to a folder (usually with the same name as the archive).\nTo build any tool from the sources Xcode and/or Xcode Command Line Tools are required.\n\nOpen the README file and check the build instruction. The readme mentions: \n\nTo build Tor from source:\n                ./configure && make && make install\n\nThen open Terminal and navigate to the folder: cd ~/Downloads/tor-0.2.7.6\nEnter ./configure && make && make install to configure, make and install tor. You may have to prepend sudo to make install it.\nYou have to install additional packages like libevent, openssl and probably some other to build it successfully.\nTo run tor simply enter tor in the shell.\n\nAlternatively you can skip the && make install and just run ./configure && make. Other packages - like mentioned above - are still needed.\nThen tor won't be installed to /usr/local. You still can run it in the build folder using src/or/to\nI doubt that the above instructions successfully build tor after installing all required libraries/packages/tools (which will probably mess your system) because they target Linux.\n\nSo I recommend to install a packet manager like Macports or Homebrew and install tor with one of both.\n\nA: If you want to browse the web anonymously, then Tor Browser works great. Having tor installed will be just a waste of time. However, if you want the entire network traffic routed through it, than tor is necessary.\nTo install tor I also recommend homebrew (see @Graham Miln answer).\nBut that's not it, if you want to route the entire network traffic through tor, you must also edit the Network System Preferences and add a new Location for tor.\nA quick guide to do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences and the Network\n\n*from the dropdown menu Location, click on Edit Locations, then the + sign and name it Tor (or whatever)\n\n*Go to Advanced, then Proxies. Put the checkmark in SOCKS Proxy and add the following values: SOCKS proxy server > localhost and Port > 9050.\n\n*Click \"OK\" and then \"Apply\" and exit the System Preferences.\n\n\nNow to actually use Tor, you must click on the Apple Menu, Locations and then the newly Tor location. Also you must run 'tor' in the Terminal. When the Terminal says that Bootstrap is at 100%, you're good to go and you can check (e.g. Safari) is running through Tor by visiting check.torprojects.org\nDo not close the Terminal window while you're running Tor.\nTo quit Tor, do CTRL+C in the Terminal and then revert Location to Automatic.\n", "Q: Put whatever keybind for switching input language I can't set CMD + Shift as a keybind for switching between input languages of the keyboard. I had to settle down with Ctrl + Space. Why does it allow me to set only some specific key binds?\nIs there a way to go around this and set specifically L cmd + L shift ? \n\nA: The command as well as the shift key (and some other keys) are modifier keys. You have to add at least one normal key (like A-Z, 0-9, Fn*, arrows etc) to define a proper shortcut.\nIf you want to change this behavior you have to install a third-party tool like Karabiner.\n", "Q: Why is steps count different in Health and Activity App in my iPhone?  \nAs apparent, the steps count appear out of sync in Health and Activity app when viewed at the same time. Both are first party apps.\nWhat is the reason for discrepancy?\n\nA: You only have a difference of 95 steps over a total of 19000 steps; it looks like a rounding error.\nOr maybe the Apple Watch has not yet uploaded the latest steps to the iPhone (it does this every few minutes, in order to save battery). \n", "Q: What are the implications of \"Select Your Country or Region\" when setting up an iPhone? I'm opening an iPhone after it has been reset to factory settings, and I'm asked to choose a language, and then to choose a country or region.\nWhat are the implication of choosing a particular country? Will it lock me out of something? Can I change this setting later? Will it affect what apps I can download from the Apple app store?\n\nA: You can change this setting later at any time. \nIt doesn't affect the AppStore. The region setting will affect the availability of certain features which aren't available in all regions yet such as Apple Pay and Apple News. \nApple News is only available if you set your region to Australia, UK or US. \nApple Pay is additionally available in Canada.\n\nA: It will affect the time format (12 vs 24 hour), date format, currency display, temperature unit, and number formatting,.

With that said, due to the unique shape of the original MacBook Air, it won't rest flat unless you use the charger that can with it. So you actually don't want any of the chargers shown on that page, you want one like this. Notice the different angle on the charger head. With that said, since Apple doesn't sell official ones any more, be very careful to make sure that you get an authentic one: knock-offs can actually destroy your computer.\nTo my knowledge, there's no Magsafe 2 to Magsafe 1 adapter (someone else showed a Magsafe 1 to Magsafe 2 adapter which will do nothing for you.) Even if there was, there's no good reason to get one unless you already have Magsafe 1 chargers and then buy a new MacBook with Magsafe 2.\n\nA: The two original magsafe (4-pin) connectors will fit any Magsafe 1; that is, the straight white connector (left), and the L-shaped stainless steel (right). \nI'm assuming they changed the design for two reasons, one, the white ones didn't match the newer stainless steel design, and two, it sticks out more than the L-shaped version.\nMagsafe2 uses a 5-pin connector.

You're better off spending any money on a slightly better display that–if nothing else–is larger.\nHowever, if you really feel like it, you can do so.\nFirst, you'll need to identify what display you have. Run the command ioreg -lw0 | grep IODisplayEDID | sed \"/[^<]*</s///\" | xxd -p -r | strings -6. This will output two strings.

Using the same example here's a VGA controller for that panel.  This will allow you to  use it as a monitor.\nAgain, let me reiterate: this probably isn't worth it for that panel. You can get a larger, nicer panel for the same amount of money and time you'll invest. But if you feel like doing it, go ahead.\n", "Q: How do I connect my calendar on my Macbook, ipad and iphone? I have an iPhone 6s, a Macbook and a new iPad. Right now events I create on one do not show on the others.  \nHow do I connect the calendar on all three?\n\nA: Since you have Apple products listed, iCloud calendars would be the place to start.\nGo to:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.icloud.com\nThere is a link in the top right on the instructions for setting up each of your devices to use iCloud for calendar syncing:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/icloud/setup/\nStart with one device - then check in the cloud using https://www.icloud.com/#calendar once the cloud and one device sync, move on to the next device and repeat until they all have syncing enabled.\n", "Q: VLC keeps freezing on Mac OS X El Capitan I have the latest versions for both El Capitan and VLC, however, ever since I've upgraded to El Capitan, VLC keeps freezing during playback. Generally to solve this: I have to pause, exit fullscreen, play and wait for it to start playing again. Every time it plays again, there is a grey overlap that comes over the video (which eventually goes away). \nI was thinking that it may be a temporary thing but this has been happening to me quite often now. Is anyone else facing this? Are there any solutions out there?\nIt shouldn't be anything hardware related. I have a pretty decent configuration for a MacBook Pro NR.\nVLC Version: 2.2.1 64-bit\nMac OS X Version: 10.11.3\nRAM: 16GB DDR3 1600 MHz\nProcessor: Intel i5 @ 2.5 GHz\n\nA: You do not have the latest version of VLC for OS X, at the present time, the latest version of VLC for OS X is 2.2.2, so you might want to try it and see if the issue persists.\nIn clicking VLC > Check for Update..., note as shown in the image below it says:\n\nMore than 100 fixes for issues reported for 2.2.1. \n  Full support of Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan.\n\n\nNote: If Check for Update... doesn't work then click the link above to download the vlc-2.2.2.dmg file and manually install it after deleting the existing application bundle.\n\nA: Not sure if anyone is still having this issue but I just installed the latest version 2.2.4 and it had the same issue on Mac OS Sierra. The fix for me was to download VLC 2.0.10 - www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html\n\nA: Installed VLC 2.2.8 and it had the same issue on Mac OS High Sierra 10.13.1. Total freeze of video for 3 seconds while sound keeps playing.\nAnd much worse keyboard and the touchpad are also none responsive. Meaning the whole macbook is frozen for 3 seconds. Can not even adjust the volume!  \nWith x264 encoded videos. Going back to VLC 2.0.10 solves it. But then you can not play any x265 content.\n", "Q: Can I remove admin rights from an OS X account without using the command line? I gave my everyday OS X user account admin rights whilst trying to get a code project working.\nI now no longer need admin rights. However, when I log in using either my everyday account or my admin account, the “Allow user to administer this computer” checkbox for my everyday account is both selected and disabled, so that I can’t remove the admin rights from my account. (I did click on the padlock icon and unlock it using my everyday account password first.)\n\nIs there a way to enable the checkbox, or another way to remove admin rights for this account?\nI’ve seen how to do so on the command line, but it feels like there should be some way to do this in the GUI.\n\nA: Aha — the reason why this option was greyed out is, I think, because I was still logged in under the everyday account.\nWhen I logged out of the everyday account, and logged into my admin account (instead of just switching straight to the admin account, leaving my everyday account logged in), then the “Allow user to administer this computer” checkbox for my everyday account was enabled, and I could uncheck it.\n", "Q: Why does recovery mode keep failing to install OS X on a new hard drive? I had a hard drive die in my Macbook Pro (from ~2012) and I replaced it. I booted into recovery mode and tried to install an OS on the new SSD, but it keeps hanging at \"installing additional components\" and eventually (after several hours) failing.\nI used command + l to see the logs, and it keeps counting up the chunks it receives, only to eventually say \"Failed to verify InstallESD.dmg: hdiutil verify failed\", at which point it restarts the download process.\nAt one point, I did get through the process successfully, but since that got me to a desktop with Snow Leopard, I immediately tried to update to El Capitan using the App Store, which also failed, saying \"This copy of the Install OS X El Capitan application can't be verified. It may have been corrupted or tampered with during downloading.\"\nWhy are these installations failing?\n\nA: Bad drive cable\nI finally took this to an apple store, and the techs diagnosed it as a bad drive cable - a common problem for Macbooks from that year, they said. With a new cable, the Recovery Mode installation worked, the El Capitan upgrade worked, and the machine has been running smoothly for months.\n", "Q: Safari and Firefox Browers not working I cannot open Yahoo or Google or other websites with Firefox or Safari on my Mac. I cannot open Apple either. I made sure the  proxies were not checked, I emptied history and cache and cookies, I reset Safari, I restarted each time I did these things. But I cannot get my mail on Yahoo or Google. I could open CNN or NFL or Fox only! IS there anything else I can do? This is on an older Mac 10.5.8. \n\nA: Might check your system's hosts file.  See http://osxdaily.com/2012/08/07/edit-hosts-file-mac-os-x/ and be sure to create a backup copy of the file before doing any editing.\n", "Q: What font have you found to work the best with OneNote's OCR feature? I've been trying to do some OCR with Microsoft OneNote and am experimenting with what font seems to work the best. While some seem to be relatively good, I'm curious if anyone has any experience with OCR and has found a font to be nearly error proof? I found that Fixedsys causes errors at times, but not sure if something traditional like Courier or Helvetica would do better?\n\nA: Tahoma works really well with OneNote's OCR feature. \n", "Q: What is tmp.0.sDQWBe? I have a file called tmp.0.sDQWBe located on my MacBook/Macintosh HD /private/var/folders/k1/(a ton of random text)/T/tmp.0.sDQWBe. The file is 13.2GB and I have no idea what it is.\nI want to delete it so it can free up space on my computer. What is it, and can I delete it?\n\nA: A simple reboot may purge some of this. /var is generally for variable files (caches, logs, etc). You can check to see which process is using the file before deleting, if it is indeed open. There are a number of ways to do this via the terminal. \nAfter a little research I found this gem of an article, What is \"/var/folders\"?.  \n", "Q: Transfer between iPod users My son would like to pass off his iPod to his brother since he has a phone now. I switched to my other son's Apple ID from his iPad but how do I get rid of the stuff on the iPod while keeping it on the iPhone? And also keep the stuff on the iPad while putting it on the iPod?\nThank you!\n\nA: Plug it it up to the computer and if it's set to sync stop it,and set the settings to manage manually. This makes it possible for you to content on the device without loosing anything.\n", "Q: Chrome Won't Go Away I was having some issues with chrome, where it would crash all the time for no reason. Then, recently, it crashed, but in my dock it says it's still running. I deleted it from my applications but it is still in my dock, and when I try to force quit it, nothing happens. I can't drag it out of my dock or do anything to move it.\n\nA: I'm guessing you have what's known in Unix as a zombie process. Unlike the less friendly dead people, zombies in your computer won't eat your brains, and they also won't do much of anything else. They don't take up any resources. It's basically just going to sit there until you reboot, or you lop its head off. OS X doesn't seem to tend its fences when it comes to zombies. I can think of a game or two they should play which would help them out with this a bit...\nFor more info on Zombies, see:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants_vs._Zombies\nor, even more helpfully:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_process\n", "Q: Safari 8.0 - 9.0 100% Cpu usage OSX 10.11.3 might be related to bookmarks / favorites I'm experiencing very weird issue as far I remember from Yosemite up to latest El Capitan 10.11.3 (15D21) and Safari Version 9.0.3 (11601.4.4) Actually it's started to become more annoying with time. Sometimes Safari goes up to 100% cpu usage, sometimes even more, but it's directly on safari process, all child processes stay at normal cpu usage including networking thread. I have started to debugging issue as far I can with closed source. I have tried to delete all cache,cookies,bookmarks and all possible data stored in relation to Safari.app including browsing and other databases. It didn't help much. I have created new test account on my macbook pro, then tried to reproduce issue with plain-set osx with safari, but after hours of usage couldn't reproduce the issue. Then I have imported Bookmarks.plist from my current account into cleanly set account, after less then 15 minutes, safari went up to 100% cpu usage again. I have also tried to use iCloud to automatically migrate safari data incase I have made mistake with manual transfer, but it seems icloud safari backup also made problem come back. My bookmarks seems normal, nothing to share here, few pages stored in favorites, one sub-directory in favorites, and couple more in bookmarks but more importantly plist file format does not seems to be corrupted itself. I couldn't find that issue is related strictly to one website, it seems it might be related to Favorites bookmarks. Does anyone have and workaround on this issue?\nPS. I don't have any problems with other browser, such as Opera,Chrome,Firefox - but using other browser it's not the solution. If that might be helpful I have took part in developer preview beta program during Yosemite, I have went back to normal release with first public Yosemite release, but I don't really think this is source of the problem.\nSafari process sample before 100% load\nScreenshot with highlighted 100% usage of safari mother-process\n\n\nA: Actually i have found solution of this issue. It seems apple didn't handled unusual cases with new Favorites tab introduced in Yosemite as far as i remember - but this is actually easy to predict, shame on you apple.\nI have quite a lot pages in bookmarks (old styled, dropdown menu), and favorites tab, in favorites i have subdirectory with bitcoin exchanges. Some of those exchanges use cloudflare to prevent ddos attacks, and form time to time ask for captcha verification. It seems each time user click on URL Field in safari, favorites bookmarks appear, and safari try to download icons and maybe other meta data for each page, and then in case unusual response, it stucks safari and waste cpu on creating many threads for nothing, im not sure if it actually retry and try download again or it's strictly connected to processing downloaded metadata from page but it just make uncountable number of threads and block cpu with junk calculations. Im not exactly sure if it's caused by cloudflare check or by any other corrupted response. But finally i have moved all bitcoin exchanges subdirectory do old styled bookmarks, where obviously metadata or/and image is not being downloaded.\nIn case someone will need to fix it, just monitor bookmarks and safari cpu usage, and remove one by one from favorites, restart safari, and again until eliminate issue.\n", "Q: Apple Screen Sharing Only Controls One Display? UPDATE: I figured out in part what is happening, but not why or how to change this behavior.  When at the computer itself, Finder only activates the screen you are on when you click on the desktop(Finder) or a window on that screen. All other Finder screens are inactive.\nWhen connected via VNC or ARD/ScreenSharing only the first screen becomes active even if that screen was not the active one when you first connected.  If another screen was active at the time you connect it becomes inactive and the first becomes active the first click that occurs. It is like the first screen has occupied all screen spaces.\nORIGINAL POST\nAs I mentioned in a previous question, I have a MacPro with 6 DVI monitors. We'd like to remotely manage it when necessary via Screen Sharing but it appears that only the first screen/display is actually controllable even though the content from all of the displays is visible. The menu bar is greyed out on all except the first screen and none of the apps are responsive.\n\nThis occurs both with the Apple Screen Sharing as well as via VNC. Both are enabled via Remote Management as opposed to Screen Sharing.\n\nIs there a way to activate the rest of the desktops? On the rest of the laptops around the office with monitors and only two displays, this lockout does not occur.\n\nA: Alright. The issue is a stupid one which is not entirely evident. When setting up a Mac with this many screens, be careful with the arrangement.  When arranged all in a row, even a 1 pixel overlap will cause the overlapped screen to take over all of the others and cause the behavior I stated above.  It is not evident from the desktop. On a gut feeling I ended up dragging all of the screens around to make sure they were entirely aligned and as far over as possible from the previous screen.  It turned out the first screen was the slightest bit overlapping the second.\nI'll leave this question/answer up for anyone else who might encounter this bizarre issue.\n\nA: I took note of the display alignment and made sure that the 2nd screen (I only have 2 on the iMac) was accurately aligned and close up to the first. This solved my problem which was that when performing screen sharing, the second display was always black.\n", "Q: How to configure Dragon Dictate so that it does not scan files upon opening? When I open a text file with TextEdit, Dragon Dictate scan the file:\n\nIt often ends up being unresponsive if the file is large. How to configure Dragon Dictate so that it does not scan files upon opening?\nI use Dragon Dictate 5 with OS X 10.10. If I open the file SublimeText, I do not have this issue.\n\nA: I was able to replicate that behavior in an earlier major version and to stop it, this is what I did.\nGo to Dragon Dictate > Preferences... > Dictation and uncheck the TextEdit check box, as shown in the image below.\n\nNote: This is from Dragon Dictate 3.0.2 and may be somewhat different in version 5, however hopefully this will help to resolve the issue.\n", "Q: Battery not charging? (Even after SMC reset) So, I've seen a couple topics like this that already exist, but none solved my problem. I plug in my charge to my 13-Inch MacBook Air, Early 2015, and the LED light did not turn on, and the battery icon on my mac says that the battery is not charging. I am 8% right now, and am not losing power, but not getting any either.\nI tried the obvious: Unplugging and plugging the charger to my computer, unplugging and replugging it into the outlet, both at the same time, flipping the charger upside down, restarting my computer, and tried every different outlet in my house. I have a few extra charger extenders, (where you take out the two prongs and replace it with a longer cable) so I tried changing those out, and changing back to a two prong, all with no luck.\nIt was working perfectly this morning, and I haven't done anything to my computer or charger, such as spilling something on them or dropping them. I don't know whether the problem is with the computer or the charger, and can't test it because I only have one of each.\nSo I looked up this problem, and basically every source said to do an SMC reset, and I basically tried every single variation of it I could find. \nI would be happy to provide any other specs that you think are necessary to know. \nKeep in mind when explaining this, that I am very tech-savvy when it comes to software, but I know almost nothing about hardware or electronics.\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: Do you have another charger? If yes and if that works, maybe your first charger was damaged. Maybe there's a wire inside of it has broken or something, or the charger became loose (in wires or plug). But if you tried another charger and nothing happened, maybe the problem is in you laptop.\n\nA: Ok, I solved the problem. The computer socket where the charger was going in had some pencil marks in it. My friend just used a pencil eraser inside it, and then blew out the rubber, and it works like new.\n", "Q: How to change icon of an app through Terminal I want to customize my app icons, but there's a lot of them, and I don't want to be tedious and go through the whole Get Info process over and over again. \nIs there any way to write a program, preferably in Terminal using the command line, that will change the icon of an app?\n\nA: If you want to easily change the icon of the applications its best to use an application like liteicon You can just drag and drop the icon you want to use.\n", "Q: Display won't turn on after opening lid Here's some system info\n$ system_profiler | grep Processor  \n    Apple: AUDynamicsProcessor:  \n    Apple: AUVoiceProcessor:  \n      Processor Name: Intel Core i7  \n      Processor Speed: 2.9 GHz  \n      Number of Processors: 1  \n  processor=<KSActionProcessor:0x522ce0  \n$ sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string  \nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-3520M CPU @ 2.90GHz\n\nAlmost every time I open my lid after my laptop having been sleeping for at least a couple of hours, the screen is dead and nothing wakes it up.

(10.11.3)\n\nA: My MacBook (Late 2008 Unibody) does the same thing; once it's in the \"deep deep sleep\" state, it often fails to recognise that the lid has opened.\nI've found that connecting and reconnecting the power adaptor with the lid open, then shut, then open again will make it \"realise\" that the the lid is open.\nAt this point, the keyboard becomes responsive (the caps lock LED will toggle if the key is pressed) and shortly afterwards the screen will light up.\nA rather long-winded description of the sequence is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure power adaptor is connected and MagSafe LED is illuminated.\n\n*Open lid.\n\n*Disconnect power adaptor.\n\n*Reconnect power adaptor; wait for MagSafe LED to light and settle on a colour.\n\n*Close lid.\n\n*Repeat steps 3 and 4.\n\n*Repeat steps 2 through 4.\n\n\nMy theory is that the Mac's System Management Controller (SMC) gets in a state where it's unaware that the lid has opened, and toggling the power adaptor in each state (lid open, lid closed) prompts it to re-check the lid status.\nN.b This method doesn't work if the Mac is genuinely switched off, rather than sleeping - for example, if its battery completely discharged before it could hibernate.\n", "Q: How to differentiate between Terminal scripted launch and manual launch for .bash_profile settings I have some .bash_profile settings that restore my last working directory

Nothing else has changed, it just suddenly isn't working. I operate the mail server myself, so I know that nothing has changed on the server end either, and that the settings are all exactly right; I have in fact been sending messages just fine for the past few months.\nI'm not sure if it's related, but under my SMTP server list the \"Automatically detect and maintain account settings\" checkbox is enabled and greyed out, making it impossible to disable it. If I manually edit Accounts.plist to set ConfigureDynamically to false then Mail just overwrites it true again.\nI really have no idea what's happening, as Mail seems to be simply failing to send my SMTP password, instead sending an asterisk (abort).

I've already checked under Keychain Access and the correct password is definitely being saved for my SMTP server, so I have no idea what's going on.\nJust wanted to add as well, but I've tried manually connecting to the SMTP server using openssl s_client -starttls smtp -connect mail.example.org:587 and manually entering commands, including the AUTH LOGIN steps with my base64 encoded password, and authentication is successful, the fault appears to be only with Mail, so the status quo for OS X Mail in my experience ;)\n\nA: So it seems I may have just stumbled upon the cause myself; in addition to my active e-mail accounts, I also had two disabled IMAP accounts (no SMTP details) that I've been migrating from recently. It turns out that while these were listed in Mail they were not listed under Internet Accounts, contrary to what Mail would say when I tried to remove them.\nClosing Mail, opening ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Accounts.plist and manually removing the inactive accounts before saving and relaunching Mail appears to have corrected the issue.\nI'm not certain whether to mark this as the answer or to delete this question as I'm not sure how useful this is likely to be; I suppose someone else may eventually find an SMTP server failing after somehow getting inactive IMAP accounts \"stuck\" in this way; I'm going to report it to Apple anyway as I can't even begin to imagine why this should have caused Mail to stop sending an SMTP password.\nSolving this issue also allows me to now enable or disable the \"Automatically detect and maintain account settings\" option, not sure what to make of that but it's a damned menace so it's getting turned off.\n", "Q: A process called sdmd is using huge amounts of resources...!? There's a process called sdmd running which reads gigabyte after gigabyte from disk and is slowing my computer to a crawl. What is that, and how can I get rid of it?\n\nA: This may affect OS X El-Capitan or later installations running Server.app with active file sharing. sdmd is a service which produces indices and previews for iOS devices. In the process it parses everything in the share, which, depending on how large that shared folder is and where it's located, can take quite some time and resources.\nI've seen this causing an issue with a relatively slow external RAID array, which another process was trying to write to; sdmd was causing so much I/O on the drive that the process couldn't write data fast enough, causing data to pile up in its memory, which saturated RAM, caused lots of swapping, and eventually caused OS X to suspend the process outright to keep the system from keeling over. Nice chain reaction...\nTo get rid of sdmd, disable iOS Access (next to AFP, SMB etc.) in the details of each individual shared folder in Server.app (or at least in the folders where it causes a problem).\nTip of the hat to https://osxbytes.wordpress.com/2015/10/02/server-app-5-0-4-sdmd-and-ios/ for this solution.\n", "Q: Printer will not print, status: \"Hold for Authentication\" Used to be able to print like a charm.

Attempting to use the 'Guest' login would yield the same outcome - continual 'Hold for Authentication' / no successful print.\nResetting the Printer solved the issue - I re-added the printer in Mojave, and clicked 'Guest' and can print successfully. \nBizarre, I would have never thought that resetting the printer would solve a network/domain authentication problem.\nGood luck!\n\nA: No passwords involved here at all.

A colleague suggested I get the latest Microsoft Office for Mac.\nI priced it on Amazon, and I came across Microsoft Office Home and Business 2016 for Mac | Mac Key Card. However, the listing does not discuss the terms or explain the Mac Key Card.\nI visited Microsoft's site and found Office Home & Business 2016 for Mac.

I want to ensure I understand what I am getting into. I got burned in the past with Microsoft, their marketing literature that omits important limitations and details, and their expiring trials.\n\nA: My understanding is that the only difference in the MS Office 2016 apps is the licensing key.\nThey will all want to phone home to microsoft's cloud services - so no matter how you buy/install it - you'll have to deal with that on a firewall / configuration basis after installing the apps.\nThe key card just provides you a license so you don't need to log in to authenticate that you're an Office 365 subscriber. Think of it like logging into iTunes or the various app stores. Microsoft gives you an account to verify if you have subscribed to their software.\nThe key card is the license to avoid that online payment / check.\nApple's web site is actually quite nice for sussing out how the various options are priced and licensed:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/us/search/office?src=globalnav\nOffice 365 is a subscription that expires.

(My iPhone was charged at 45% and I got the dreaded beeping sound today. Absurd? Yes.) Once you charge it more fully, the beeping should cease. At least it did for me. \n\nA: For those who follow: Looks like faulty USB ports on the MBP. \nThere are two ports: one persistently has the problem. The other will work most of the time if I insert the USB cable, then push / lightly twist the base of the plug horizontally in its socket so the outer end is leaning toward the rear of the computer. Possibly there is a slight misalignment of the pins? The cable is the original cable that came in the box with the iPhone 6\nUpdate: clean the socket with a toothpick\nThe problem grew gradually worse until I found https://www.cnet.com/how-to/use-a-toothpick-to-clean-out-your-iphone/ which described fluff in the lightning port on the phone. When I looked in to the socket, there did not seem to be anything in there. But when I scratched around with a toothpick a surprising amount of compacted fluff/dust/pocket lint was dislodged and came out. Now the lightning plug sits securely in the socket (it used to wobble). There is no \"beep loop\". \n", "Q: After installing SSD I replaced my internal drive in my macbook pro 2010 with a new SSD. I started the machine, then pressed alt/option to access Recovery Mode in order to use Disk Utility. So, I opened Disk Utility and tried to erase and partition the new SSD. This is the error I am getting: \"Disk Erase failed with error: File system formatter failed\". All the video that I have watched seemed to follow the same steps that I did. What am I doing wrong?\n\n\nA: Your SSD as you said is empty, so this is why you do not have any recovery partition to reinstall the OS.\nYou need to boot to an external device (USB key or DVD depending on your Mac) in order to format and install Mac OS on your new SSD. You can use software like DiskMaker X to create a bootable OS X device.\nYou will need another Mac to create the bootable drive or you can reinstall your old disk, create the bootable drive and then reinstall your SSD.\n\nA: Apple documents the steps for you and covers the options pretty well:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\nBasically, if your hardware support Internet recovery you'll be able to reinstall an OS and get a recovery HD on the SSD. If not, you'll have to bring a bootable drive to that Mac or create a recovery HD from another Mac.\n", "Q: Can I delete images from Pictures folder? Are they redundant?

I believe all my images/photos would have been imported into the these two libraries.\nDoes that mean that I can delete all my images/photos from the Pictures folder?\n\nA: Normally the photos have to be imported to one or the other via drag and drop or the import button. To be on the safe side import some of the photos into the photo application. If they are duplicates you will receive a popup stating that the files are the same \n", "Q: Problem starting Music app on iPhone When I turn on my music app, a picture of a girl wearing a headphone is showing and I cannot go to my music library. How can I resolve it?\n\nA: The picture you're seeing is actually the page for Apple Music, it comes once you've updated the iOS to a relatively newer version supporting Apple Music. To get rid of that and proceed to your music library firstly make sure the phone is connected to the internet. Then open your music app. Once it's open at the bottom you should see a line saying either \"No,Thanks\" or \"Continue to Music Library\". \nJust click on either one. \nThat did the trick for me when i faced this problem.\n", "Q: How do I get my iPhone backups open I'm trying to extract my old iPhone's backups. I'm using the iPhone Backup Extractor, and it tells me the status of my backup is \"complete and encrypted\". I don't recall ever encrypting my backup so I'm wondering how is this even possible? \nDoes the iTunes encrypt your backup without your command?\nIs there a way to unencrypt the backup?\nIs there any other way of extracting your backup into actual files besides iPhone Backup Extractor? Any recommendations?\n\nA: Itunes will encrypt your backup by defualt however you can turn this off (its in the options when the device is connected)\nThere is a program called iExplorer which will allow you to view the contents of your backups and allow to export the data. \n", "Q: Add PDFs to iBooks, without making a copy to com.apple.BKAgentService folder TL;DR: How do I get rid of duplicate PDF files between the com.apple.BKAgentService iBooks folder and their original location?\nMy SSD is running out of space, so I'm doing some cleanup. A point that has come to my attention is a lot of duplication of PDF files added to my iBooks library (which I'm forced to use for viewing these files in my iPhone and iPad -- if Apple didn't force iBooks down my throat, I would steer as clear as possible from this abomination.)\nAs I recall, at some point in time, iBooks wouldn't copy your PDFs to the com.apple.BKAgentService folder -- I believe it was used for your purchased iBooks from Apple, or for PDFs/ePubs you downloaded in iOS Safari and then clicked on \"Open in iBooks\".\nIt looks like this is different now. When adding a PDF to iBooks, a copy is automatically made to the com.apple.BKAgentService folder, which is woefully inefficient.\nOf course I could delete the other copy (not in com.apple.BKAgentService) of my PDF, but I like to keep them organized by folders, kinda like iTunes does with //.mp3. If this is were possible inside the com.apple.BKAgentService folder, this would be an acceptable solution to me.\nI've also thought of individually symlinking each file in the com.apple.BKAgentService folder to their original location. Although this would be a lot of work, it would also be an acceptable solution to me, but I have no idea if this is going to wreak havoc with iBooks.\nAny other solutions to the problem are welcome.\n\nA: I eventually solved the problem by hard-linking the files between my folder and the com.apple.BKAgentService folder, with the aid of some shell scripts to automate the process. Everything still seems to be working fine.\n", "Q: Macbook Air crashes/restarts when something doing something heavy on it Might be a little confusing to explain but I'll try my best to give a detailed response.\nBasically it's a Macbook Air (2014 model) running Yosamite 10.10.2.  \nI noticed this issue a while back and couldn't find an answer to it on Google. \nWhenever I run anything that's a little CPU extensive like a game, a heavy website, or anything which activates the fan in the Macbook, it just crashes/restarts after freezing. \nYou can hear the fan just turning on and speeding up, but before it gets to full speed the Macbook just freezes and then crashes and reboots to the Apple logo.\nIn the past, it worked just fine. I played a few games on it even though the Macbook Air would be running its fan for an hour, it never caused issues like this before.\nI'm just confused, could this be an OSX error, like maybe upgrading to Yosamite 10.10.2 caused this(was on 10.10 when things ran fine).\nCould it be that something is damaged? (The fan seems fine because I used a fan control App to test running the fan on full mode and it ran just perfectly)\nAnything would be greatly helpful guys...\n\nA: Welcome to Ask Different!\nI don't think it's enough details to answer for sure. The best would probably be to go to an Apple Store ask them to run there diagnostic tool on your computer.\nWhat it looks like is that the computer gets too hot and enter in safe mode leading to the shut down to avoid the melting down of the processor.\nThat said maybe there is too much dust and your computer is actually too hot, or maybe one of the sensor is wrong and then it will show on the diagnostic tool. \nYou can also use a software like iStat Menu or HWSensors to read yourself the sensors and try to spot something wrong.\n", "Q: Can I Change Track Attributes Without iTunes? I accidentally changed the Media Kind of an Audiobook to Voice Memo. I've never used Voice Memos on my iPhone and can't see any way to browse voice memos in iTunes to correct the issue.\nI have found the Audiobook files in the iTunes Media folder but when I drag them back into iTunes it's still categorised as Voice Memos. I even tried manually moving it into the Audiobook folder in iTunes Media but it doesn't show up under Audiobooks in iTunes.\nIs there a way to change the Media Type of a file before importing it into iTunes? Or, is there a way to view this file in iTunes somehow so I can change the attributes in there?\n\nA: Well I found a way but it's not easy!\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate the file in the Media Type > Voice Memos folder.\n\n*Double-click one of the audiobook tracks to play it in iTunes.\n\n*Right-click the play-bar at the top of iTunes and choose Get Info and you can change that track back to an Audiobook.\n\n\n\n\n\n*You could do this for every track but in my case I found that doing this revealed all of the Audiobook tracks under My Music even though they were still tagged as Voice Memos. So I could select all tracks from there and use Cmd + i to convert them all to Audiobooks in one hit.\n\n\nQuite a long workaround but hopefully this will help someone else, I'm just glad my audiobooks are playable again :)\n", "Q: \"is a directory error\" in bash I have very limited knowledge of bash, and I haven't been able to figure out what I'm doing wrong.\nI'm trying to follow the steps in this blog post: Using Mendeley and Dropbox to sync your pdf library across computers\nHowever, when I run the terminal commands I get the following error:\n~/Library/Application\\ Support>cp -r Mendeley\\ Desktop/ ~/Dropbox/Mendeley/db/\n-bash: /Users/XXXXXXXX/Library/Application Support: is a directory\n\nEverything I've read online seems to suggest that this command is correct.\n\nA: The author of the linked article probably had a modified bash profile (like explained by the user user3439894 in the comments to your question) or had problems to copy and paste the commands.\nUse the following instead:\ncd ~/Library/Application\\ Support\ncp -r Mendeley\\ Desktop/ ~/Dropbox/Mendeley/db/\nmv Mendeley\\ Desktop/ _backup_Mendeley_Desktop/\nln -s ~/Dropbox/Mendeley/db/Mendeley\\ Desktop .\n\nPlease don't forget to include the dot . at the end of the last command.

My objective is to determine the IP address for Ethernet on a device. But assuming that there are connections like WiFi and USB Ethernet, is there a particular way just to get the Ethernet IP ?\nOn a shell I would do networksetup -listallhardwareports which would give me a mapping of Hardware Port to Device. From that I would grep the device for Hardware Port: Ethernet and then use ifaddr struct to get my IP.\nI know the ifaddr part, please suggest how to do the first part programmatically.\nAlso, is there an alternative approach ?\n\nA: There may be several different ways to accomplish what you're asking, however, I'll just throw this out there.\nI have a MacBook Pro that doesn't have a built-in Ethernet Port so in my examples I'll use Hardware Port: Wi-Fi since I tested this in both examples below and it worked, however you can change it to Hardware Port: Ethernet if that is what the output of networksetup -listallhardwareports shows for you.\nIf you just want to output the target device's IP Address to stdout, use the following example:\n$ ipconfig getifaddr $(networksetup -listallhardwareports | awk '/Hardware Port: Wi-Fi/{getline; print $2}')\n192.168.1.100\n\nIf you want to assign it to a variable in a script, use the following example:\nipAddress=\"$(ipconfig getifaddr $(networksetup -listallhardwareports | awk '/Hardware Port: Wi-Fi/{getline; print $2}'))\"\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe relevant output of networksetup -listallhardwareports for my system is:\nHardware Port: Wi-Fi\nDevice: en0\nEthernet Address: 28:cf:e3:10:a4:cd\n\n(Note: That is not my real MAC Address)\nUsing $(...) command substitution in order to have something to pass to ipconfig getifaddr <args> I determine the Hardware Port's Device Name with the output of networksetup -listallhardwareports and pipe | it through awk which is looking for Hardware Port: Wi-Fi and uses the get line function, which reads the next line after the match and is passed to print $2, which in essence prints the second part of the line following the match, which in the case is en0 and that gets passed to ipconfig getifaddr as its argument in the first example, e.g ipconfig getifaddr en0. The output of which is the IP Address.\nIn the second example a second $(...) command substitution is used around the complex command line used for the stdout example to assign it to the ipAddress variable when used in a script.\nNote:  This is really meant to be an example as I've not coded it to account for the device being down.  In other words if the device doesn't have and IP Address there will be no output to stdout and nothing assigned to the ipAddress variable in the script.  Although in the script it can be coded to test whether or not the ipAddress variable is empty and act accordingly.\n\nA: Use SCNetworkInterfaceCopyAll to get a list of interfaces, then filter out the ones that don't return Ethernet\nwith SCNetworkInterfaceGetInterfaceType.\nFrom there you can get the gateway and mask, etc - in python I use netifaces for that.\n", "Q: Bootcamp drivers for windows 10 So, I just installed windows 10, upgraded from a copy of windows 7. After the upgrade, the trackpad didn't work, the volume worked for a little bit and now it is gone. The other keys that control screen brightness, key backlights, etc. do not work also.\nIt seems the support drivers did not install when I installed windows 7. I upgraded to windows 10 without knowing this.\nI've tried to download the windows 10 drivers from bootcamp, but it only downloads the windows 7 drivers. At first I didn't know this and when I went to install them, it said that I needed to revert back to windows 7 to install the drivers.\nIs this my only option? To revert back to windows 7 and then reinstall windows 10? Is there anyone who knows or can upload the windows 10 support drivers?\nIf it helps, my bootcamp version is 6.0.1. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: David Anderson's comment is on target, some Macs do not support Windows 10. Annoying but true. So we gotta know what Mac you have.\nAs an aside you can download the bootcamp.app and then right (or control) click on it and \"Show Package Contents.\" There will be a .zip file in there somewhere (possibly an .exe, sorry it's been a while...) with all the drivers in it that you can then copy to the Windows partition and install. But that working will depend on if that package has the drivers for your specific make and model of Mac.\nAlso some people have had luck going into device manager in Windows and finding the make and model of the \"missing\" hardware and installing \"generic\" versions of those drivers directly from the manufacturers website. EG A video card from NVidia you would get off the NVidia website, not Apple's.\n", "Q: Scanner not recognised on Epson Printer after El Capitan update I've noticed that the scanner option has disappeared from the System Preferences (Printers & Scanners) control for the Epson AL CX21NF. I've tried installing the drivers from here and also using the System update from Apple (specific to Epson printers via the App Store). I have added the printer (using the IP address and LPD Line Daemon option) and can print to the device, but have no option to scan documents.\nHas something changed in El Capitan or is this printer now just too old to be supported? \n\nA: El Capitan has problems supporting scanners. After talking to Apple tecs, and Epson techs and getting the run around, my easy fix was to pay for and down load VueScan and my scanner works again.\n\nA: Try to Reset printing system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to  -> System Preferences\n\n*Select Printers & Scanners\n\n*In the left Sidebar (in the white area) do a control-click\n\n*Choose Reset printing system\nMore informations here\n\nA: Looks like the universal print driver is just that - a print driver, not a scanner driver. From what it says on the page you linked, the scanner software was last updated in 2009. (I know all-in-ones are popular but I prefer standalone single function devices, as it prevents me from ending up with a unit that is 90% usable and 10% irreparably broken...)\n", "Q: How secure are files on an unencrypted hard disc? How secure are files, that I saved on an internal Macbook hard disc using OSX 10.11? I cannot check whether the hard drive is encrypted using FileVault as the machine crashed. I am thinking whether I need to invest 40$ to get it savely formatted by some professionals or just sell it.\nIf you are not the account owner and don't know the account password, will you be able to read files from my account if you put the hard drive in a new machine?\n\nA: If the hard drive is not encrypted, then it's not at all secure!\nBasically anybody can take the hard disk, put it into an external enclosure and connect it to another Mac to read all files on the disk. \n", "Q: Seeking for some advice of Mac Mini vs Macbook Pro both maxed out specs I am looking for some advice about getting a macbook pro or mac mini. Basically, the case with me is that I currently have a mid 2014 macbook pro that is a base model. I use the macbook pro at home and on the go, so it was inevitable that the ram and hard drive space was not enough for me. I am considering upgrading to the macbook pro model 13\" with processor and ram maxed out along with 512 GB of disk space. However, I recently noticed that most of my heavy duty work (i.e.: running matlab/data analysis/VM at the same time, which are typically done at home and with my current set up at home, I have 2 27\" monitors connected to the macbook pro). So, I recently thought about the mac mini and how it might be a better decision while using my macbook pro on the go. I just turned out to be a laptop guy so I never really thought about getting desktops but I really enjoy the portability of laptops but mac mini to be honest is also not to immobile also. \nSo I'm looking for some advice. I noticed that if I were to buy either, they both have i7 processors while macbook pro has turbo boost up to ~3.3 GHz with 3MB of shared L3 cache and mac mini has 3.5 GHz 4mb shared L3 cache. Though I'm unsure about the hyper threading capabilities of the Mac mini compared to the macbook pro. Seems to be a majority of the difference would be the disk space, if I'm correct.\nOr the 3rd option is just to all out and go for a refurbished mac pro, which I noticed has 12GB of L3 cache + 10GB of memory for base, which is just insane but I do have a limited budget and can't afford to get upgrades for the mac pro.\nWhat are your recommendations ? I appreciate any advice and thanks in advance. \n\nA: The current Macbook Pro 13\" (early 2015 model with i7-5557U) is faster than the latest available Mac Mini (late 2014 model with i7-4578U).\nOn paper the Mac Mini (late 2012 model i7-3720QM) is faster and more easy to upgrade (ram + hard drive) but it's probably not available for purchase any more.  In reality the new Macbook Pro will be much faster because of its insane fast SSD (AND its bus).  Yes you can upgrade the Mini with an SSD but you're still stucked with that bus.  \nDon't be fooled with the form factor.  Mac Mini's and iMacs basically are laptops in desktop casings.\nI'd personally go for the Macbook Pro, any day of the week.  You state you are a notebook guy.  Stick with being one.  On top of that the Macbook potentially has better 2nd hand value if that's important to you.\nThe new Macbooks (Macbook Air from Mid 2013 and Macbook Pro's from Early 2014) have insane fast SSD's.  Remembering what every forum told thousands of times: if you want to get more speed out of your Mac, upgrade to an SSD before spending money on the RAM.  On a maxed out Macbook Pro you'll have both.\n", "Q: How to restore backups manually from Time Machine? I bought a new Mac a few days ago. I did a clean install, so I can start blank. Now I want to restore some files back from Time Machine to the new Mac. Is there a way to get the Time Machine interface so I can travel through my old backups using TM on my new Mac?\n\nA: To restore the latest backup, connect the drive used for Time Machine to the new Mac and run /Applications/Utilities/Migration Assistant.app. There is also a support document from Apple covering this (but it reads some reading between the lines because it covers several use cases as once).\nTo access the backup as a whole, see this answer.\n", "Q: Yosemite update deleted user files - but no old user folder in the system I am wondering, after the OS was updated, a user created the same user account with same name and same full name.

Disk space taken is only 13 GB.\nIt is related to How do i get back my old user account after upgrading to OS X Yosemite 10.10.2?\n\nA: I didn't think it was possible to create the same named account if there is already one there.

But if something were to happen to iCloud I would lose ALL my data.  \nIs there any way of backing up iCloud data (especially backups) and if so where and how?\n\nA: For complete belt & braces, you really need a minimum of 3 distinct locations for any data you consider 'permanent'.\n\n\n*\n\n*Your computer.\n\n*a local backup  \n\n*an off-site backup.\n\n\nThere can be some element of redundancy in this.  \nYou can backup your iPhone to your computer, via iTunes.  \nYour computer then ought to be backed up to either another computer in the same building, or to a hard drive, connected especially for that purpose. For Mac, Time Machine is the perfect solution. For Windows, something like Acronis. \nThis ought to be good enough right up to the point the house burns down ;)\nTo be secure even in that remote eventuality, your computer, already containing your safety backup of your iCloud/iPhone data, can then separately be backed up to another online service such as Backblaze. Acronis also have a cloud solution - I've not tried this myself, but it may be worth investigating.\n", "Q: El Capitan dock and cdock 2 problem After updating cdock 2 to the latest version on my Mac running El Capitan, all the icons moved up from center and now look like on the image below.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Reported and…\nThis has been reported to the developers as ticket 23:\n\nWith the latest release of cDock2 the icons are up too high on the Dock, making contact wit the top edge of the Dock.

including Spotify.\nhttps://community.spotify.com/t5/Help-Desktop-Mac/Kernel-Panic-for-my-Mac-when-using-Spotify/td-p/1218495/\nIn my case, I was unlucky as I had set Spotify to \"open automatically at login\" and I was getting a constant kernel panic. In order to solve that problem I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot your Mac in safe mode (hold SHIFT while booting)\n\n*While in safe mode, your mac will be extremely slow. Don't worry.\n\n*Disable \"Open at Login\" by right clicking on the Spotify icon.\n\n\nMost recent versions seem to be much more stable.\n", "Q: A new ExFAT partition prevents bootcamp from starting windows I'm trying to create a shared partition that I can use from both Windows and OS X. I made a new partition, but if I make it FAT or ExFAT Windows does not start. I get Error code: 0xc000000e. I assume this is because it tries to boot from the empty partition instead of the bootcamp partition.\nIf I make the partition use Apple's filesystem, I can boot to Windows again but then the partition becomes read-only.\nAny suggestions how to solve this? All partitions are on the same hard drive - I don't have any external drives. I created my Bootcamp installation using Yosemite and later updated.

It shows can't establish secure link.\nHowever after I add NSAppTransportSecurity/NSAllowsArbitraryLoads = True to ingress.app/info.plist. Ingress tries send package again and again. However the server only returns null package.\nIn the other hands. I tried to add the p12 to OSX and pip doesn't work fine, says cert error.\nI think some app only trust the default TrustStore.\nSo here is my problem: How to add an CA to the default TrustStore in OSX and iOS.\nFinally I found an old way to add cert to default Trust Store from [question]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/347690/iphone-truststore-ca-certificates @Max Ried's method, however it's too old, and the TrustStore.sqite has been changed into the certsTable.data and I found no way to decode it, and Russian pdf might help [pdf]: http://dsec.ru/upload/medialibrary/b2f/b2fa8c121cc7f1ca94b63f34c22735e7.pdf\nSo is there any up-to-date method to install CA?\n\nA: Both iOS and OS X can use configuration profiles to install certificates. \nApple has some nice documentation at https://help.apple.com/serverapp/mac/5.0/#/ for how to do that using Server.app. Luckily, you can use the same profile on iOS/OS X for certs although many other settings are unique to one or the other OS. \nI would recommend using Apple Configurator 2 to make your profiles since it's free and graphical based. You might use Profile Manager on Server.app if you have lots of clients to configure and another MDM solution doesn't work for you. \nNo matter which tool you choose to craft the profile, it's just a file you place on a web server or email to the clients and then tap/click to install the certificate. \n", "Q: Pandora app won't play on Apple TV (4th Generation) I can't get Pandora to play music on my Apple TV (4th Gen).

When I upgraded the processors in my '09 I made sure I had one running correctly before adding the second and discovered the issue. Fan noise is quite loud. You might be able to limit it with a third party fan control app, like 'Macs Fan Control', but I'm not positive and am unwilling to test it by removing one of my processors. :)\nAlso, you will be limited to the four RAM slots of the installed processor.\n", "Q: Separate Downloads folder on SD Card I will separate my Downloads Folder on a permanently installed SD Card in my MacBook Pro.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Please explain your question better. Are you trying to move your User \"Downloads\" folder to another location than the harddrive? Are you wanting to have a separate folder you download to moved to an SDCard?\nYou can easily create a new Downloads folder on the SDCard and when you download files just save there by default. I could do some searching (or you can) to see if there is a way to have a different folder open by default to save, but it's usually the last place you saved a file to.\nIf you are wanting to MOVE your Downloads folder, you can always create some sort of symbolic link where your current Downloads folder is and have it point to the SDCard, the problem with this is that if you SDCard EVER drops away you have a potential to have to recreate the link when card is seen again. There is no such thing as a \"permanent\" installed removable media.\nFor further reference, THIS LINK pulls up as a first search on google and walks you through the various options I mention above.\n\nA: Renaming the folder and mucking with it are quite easy and there are a surprisingly many ways to do it (aliases in finder, sym links, preference files, app settings) - but the one thing to think about is what happens when the new folder isn't mounted or changes?\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I rename the Downloads folder (in Lion)?\n", "Q: iphone 4s cloud backup issue I have my iphone 4s set up to backup on the cloud and i have paid for extra storage place on the cloud i plug my phone up at night and have it connected to the wifi to backup when i sleep but it doesnt work i  then get notification that my phone has not backed up in 12 weeks...what should i check i am paying for extra space and yet nothing is getting backed up.

I just installed the trial version of Parallels Desktop 11.1.2 for Mac Business Edition, Parallels tools, and Windows 7 x32 bit in english.\nThe resolution of my Mac is 1920*1200. I have set the resolution of Windows to be 1600*1000 to occupy the whole screen. The problem is everything in Windows (e.g., fonts, texts, images) looks a little bit blurry, at least not as clear as Mac. This does not change with other resolution of Windows.\nDoes anyone know how to fix this problem?\nPS: after 1 hour looking at the blurry Windows, I feel already dizzy...\nEdit 1: I take two screenshots (one from Mac, the other one from Windows; both of them under 1920*1200) to show the difference:\n\n\n\nA: You shouldn't be setting the resolution of Windows in Parallels.\nBoot Windows and choose Virtual Machine → Install Parallels Tools and follow the instructions. This sets the resolution automatically according to the window dimensions.\nIf Parallels Tools doesn't set the right resolution in full screen, in Configuration set Full Screen: Scale to fit screen to Auto.\n\nA: Apparently, this is caused by Windows somehow not being well \"adapted\" to the high DPI of Apple's Retina displays. The problem is described (and a solution given) in the Parallels Knowledge Base at http://kb.parallels.com/en/114700, but both the Knowledge Base article and the other answer here are slightly out of date at present, so I thought I'd provide my own answer. This is what worked for me, but some menus may be slightly different for you.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch your Windows VM in Parallels.\n\n*Click Actions in the top menu bar of your VM window (may be called Virtual Machine in some versions of Parallels)\n\n*Click Configure in the dropdown menu\n\n*Click Hardware in the top menu bar of the configuration menu\n\n*Click Graphics in the left sidebar (may be called Video in some versions of Parallels)\n\n*Select the Best for Retina display radio button (may instead be an Enable Retina resolution checkbox in some versions of Parallels)\n\n\nYou'll be prompted to restart your VM, and then the blur should be gone.\nIn case you can't find them in your UI, all the things I had to click are circled in the screenshots below:\n\n\n", "Q: How to prevent someone accessing my iMac My desktop is in the living room where anyone visiting can access it.  I'd like to make it secure from those in my home since I have a roommate.\n\nA: You can't make it truly secure; there is a saying that says given enough time, physical access is root access. That being said, there are some steps you can take to get as close as possible.\nFileVault\nEnable filevalult. This will keep people from accessing your data if they boot from an external drive.\nTo do this, go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> FileVault, and click Turn On FileVault. This will most likely require an admin password, and will probably take a very long time, depending on how much stuff is on your computer. That being said, it's worth it.\nScreen lock\nEnable auto-locking of your computer after a set amount of time. This can be done in System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General. Check the box that says require password [5 minutes] after sleep or screensaver begins and change it to your desired amount of time.\nFirmware lock\nTo prevent booting into single user mode or from an external disk without a password, enable firmware lock.\nWARNING: THIS IS VERY HARD TO RECOVER FROM IF YOU LOSE YOUR PASSWORD. DON'T LOSE IT.\nTo do this, shut down your computer and turn it on while holding the Command+R keys. This will put you in recovery mode. Click the Utilities menu, and select the Firmware Password Utility. Click Turn On Firmware Password... and set a password. You will need it to boot from anything other than your main partition, so keep it safe! If you have an older Mac (Pre-2011, I think) there is a trick to get around this, but it requires removing the RAM, so it's pretty unlikely.\n\nA: There's never a way to make it entirely secure, especially with physical access. However, you can significantly increase the difficulty.\nI would recommend following this guide by hardentheworld.org to harden OS X. It's pretty long, but I'll list the steps quickly here: bold is more important.\n\n\n*\n\n*Allow only signed apps\n\n*Check Privacy permissions\n\n*Destroy FileVault Keys\n\n*Disable Bonjour\n\n*Disable Creation of Metadata Files\n\n*Disable Diagnostics\n\n*Disable Guest user\n\n*Disable Handoff\n\n*Disable password hints\n\n*Disable recent items\n\n*Disable Spotlight localization\n\n*Disable Spotlight Suggestions\n\n*Enable FileVault\n\n*Enable Firewall\n\n*Enable screen saver\n\n*Empty trash securely\n\n*Erase free space\n\n*Power off memory during standby\n\n*Require an administration password\n\n*Require password to un-lock\n\n*Save to Disk by Default\n\n*Set a Firmware Password\n\n*Show all filename extensions\n\n*Show when localization is used\n\n*Users privilege separation\n\n\nIn addition, I'd recommend the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable secure virtual memory (it's on by default)\n\n*Separate your user account from your administrator one\n\n", "Q: Should I change my MBP 13\" early 2014 battery I recently checked my battery cycles count: 942, this is very close to the limit 1000 as indicated by Apple https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201585\nIf it becomes 1000 do I have to replace it by myself?\nI checked https://www.ifixit.com/ and I find that the process is a bit complicated. I live in france and the official Apple replacement service would cost me 229€. \nAlso can I still use the battery after the 1000 limit? Would this have any negative effects on other system components?\n\nA: I have a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2010) and the battery cycles counts more that 1100. Maybe I'm lucky, but I never change the battery and I think is working very well. (The System Information report a Condition that is Normal!)\nAfter the 1000 cycles the battery probably start and continue to decrease a bit the Full Charge Capacity but you can still use it. The decreasing of the total capacity result in a small duration time of the battery, but anyway you'll not have any negative effects in any system components. \n", "Q: Sudoers file plist Using OSX server profiles to configure our fleet of Active Directory connected Macbooks.  \nWhen our laptops are not connected to the internal network (or via VPN), their AD group membership is lost.  Sudo is locally configured to allow an AD admin group access to sudo, however when AD is unavailable, users can no longer sudo.  \nBest solution would be to allow group membership to be cached locally, but since I believe this to be impossible (read: undocumented), I'm searching for a plist that would allow me to add the local user (using %shortname) to the sudoers file.  \n\nA: You can cache AD credentials by creating a \"mobile account\" on each machine. From Directory Utility > Active Directory > open disclosure triangle > User Experience > Create mobile account at login. Although, I will warn you, I have had some permissions issues when 'creating a mobile account' after the home folder/user has already been created. \n\nA: Your solution is likely going to make two changes to your workflow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a new local group that will allow sudoer access and modify /etc/sudoers to give that group access to sudo\n\n*Modify the user creation steps to either add the local user to admin or to the sudoer group - that will allow them to be normal admins (and get sudo by default) or to get sudo on the coat-tails of the new group.\n\n\nYou could use puppet to make the file change - but you probably have another solution for making changes to your computers.\n", "Q: How to move spotlight back to the top right corner in El Captain? I guess Apple got a bit too literal with the \"Spotlight\" feature. I feel far too sceptical about upgrading to El Captain just because of my most favourite feature, the Spotlight smacks right at you in the middle of the screen. Is there any way at all to bring spotlight to where it was back in the good old 10.9 Mavericks?\n\nA: You can click and drag the Spotlight search field anywhere on the screen and it will stay there.\n", "Q: Why Retina screenshots are twice as large as chosen area? This is a known issue, but I do not understand why the screenshot taken on my retina-MBP always has doubled size as compared to area chosen for screenshot:\nIf I choose 100x100 (as OS shows - of what? pixels? - on \"get info\" they do not provide, only shows \"dimensions\") area I get 200x200 which upon scaling becomes more blurry than original picture.\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do all retina users always get these doubled screenshots?\n\n*How can I take a screenshot of the same size as the area I choose? \n\n\nI found a lot of \"resizing\" solutions, but is there a way to take a screenshot with \"original size\" without resizing the resultant screenshot?\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes - that's the way it's coded/engineered\n\n*No - you'll need to post process the images using a tool that's designed to automate this or use Automator to make a service to resample the images.\n\n\nI like Skitch and Napkin for processing retina images, but there are many others.\n", "Q: Unable to restore apps to new Iphone I tried to restore my apps to my new iPhone but 2 of the apps failed to be restored. Then I checked the app store and found out that they are no longer available, maybe Apple took them down. Does that mean I can no longer restore them back into my phone if they are no longer available in the app store? I did fully backed up my phone to the iTunes before. \n\nA: If they aren't available on the App Store anymore, your phone can't download them from Apple.\nIf you backed up your phone to iTunes before, you just have to restore the apps from there.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes.\n\n*Select your device from the menubar at the top.\n\n*Select Apps from the lefthand pane.\n\n*Check the boxes of the 2 apps you couldn't recover from the App Store and sync them to your mobile device.\n\n", "Q: Replaced iPhone 4S batteries, won't boot, won't recover (even in DFU), iTunes says \"Waiting for iPhone\" I've tried multiple machines, multiple iTunes versions, multiple cables, and ports.\nMy phone was originally rebooting randomly.

Eventually the phone would just hang at apple logo.\nRestoring it gets it stuck in \"Waiting for iPhone\" with an apple logo with an empty gray bar under it.\nLikewise, DFU mode restore gets it stuck in \"Waiting for iPhone\" with an apple logo with an empty gray bar under it.\nNot jailbroken.

I would tether over bluetooth or WiFi and disconnect the USB so that the unit doesn't have added heat load from the charging circuitry and chemistry (lithium batteries give off heat when charging) to keep the operating temperature of the iPhone to a level that's within Apple's recommendations.\nRemoving case or other external cooling might help a bit - but you can weigh the cost of an eventual battery replacement with the cost of a different tethering option and make your best choice.\n", "Q: My Xcode 7.2 Version is not installing I am trying to download the Xcode 7.2.1 Version, but it just keeps saying installing on my computer, and nothing is happening.

Disk Utility provides ''FAT'', but this is FAT32. I have no other (Windows) computer. What do I do?\n\nA: For what it's worth, this seems to work on High Sierra:\ndiskutil eraseDisk \"MS-DOS FAT16\" SOMENAME /dev/disk#\n\nIt still needs to be unmounted first.\n\nA: I spend all evening to understand how to format a USB stick to FAT16 and its so simple and just copy these commands to your terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*diskutil unmountDisk disk4\n\n*sudo newfs_msdos -F 16 /dev/disk4\n\n*diskutil mount /dev/disk4\nThis works for all sizes of drives.\nNote: For other users: the reference to disk4 in the commands above may need to be changed to  ensure it refers to the correct drive.\n\nA: You can format any drive to FAT16 with newfs_msdos Command\n1) Launch Terminal\n2) Find The Drive you Want to Format\n#mount\n/dev/disk2 on / (hfs, local, journaled)\ndevfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk4s1 on /Volumes/USB_Disk (msdos, local, nodev, nosuid, noowners)\n\nIn this case, my disk is disk4.  Your disk will most likely be different!  Be sure to reference the correct disk - you can and will lose your data if you format the wrong drive!!!\n3) Unmount the disk\n#diskutil unmountDisk disk4\nUnmount of all volumes on disk4 was successful\n\n4)  Format the drive \n#sudo newfs_msdos -F 16 /dev/disk4\n\nAfter a few moments, your drive will format.\n5)  Remount the drive (optional)\n#diskutil mount /dev/disk4\n\nIt will probably show up as \"NO NAME\" on your Desktop.  You can rename it here or to do it at the time of formatting use -v Type in a Volume Name when you format the drive.\n\nA: Why so hard to explain things, it is the main reason why many new users get away from linux.\nJust do  mkfs.vfat -F16 /dev/sdb(x) if you want to name the USb, flash, etc... put this in addiction -n (name), then it looks like this:\nmkfs.vfat -F16 /dev/sdb(x) -n (name) and hit enter.\n", "Q: Spotify on Mac: Songs constantly won't play and get skipped over An example: \nMy friend running the app right next to me is able to play the same songs without a problem from his phone, yet on my Mac app it just skips over them. I've been having this problem for lots of tracks for a long time. Has anyone else had this problem? Any solution?\n\nA: I fixed this by completely nuking the app and all support folders and re-installing.\n", "Q: Mac won't boot from USB drive: Prohibited sign I tried to clean install OS X El Capitan on my Mac, but it won’t boot from the USB drive. Here are the steps I took to create the bootable USB drive (I have a Mid-2014 MacBook Pro with Retina Display):\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloaded the latest OS X El Capitan (10.11.3) from the Mac App Store.\n\n*Created a bootable USB drive using createinstallmedia (as explained in Apple’s documentation) and it went well.\n\n*Erased Macintosh HD.\n\n*Tried booting from USB drive. It loads through the middle, but then a prohibited sign shows up and nothing happens.\n\n\nWhat are my options now?\nHow can I determine what the problem is? I know Internet Recovery is one of my options, but I can’t connect to my home Wi-Fi (apparently for no good reason) and I have to do it with my iPhone’s Hotspot, and I happen to have the setup for El Capitan. (And Internet Recovery will install OS X Mavericks on my MacBook, right? Because it was shipped with Mavericks.)\n\nA: This also seems to be the behavior if your Mac is not compatible with the OS you are trying to install, which was not obvious to me. In my case, I was trying to install High Sierra or Mojave on a Late 2007 iMac, and got the prohibited sign right after picking the USB from the boot menu. After looking at a compatibility list like this one, I tried using the latest compatible OS X version, which worked.\nNote that finding an old enough version gets gradually trickier as the version you need is older; for that I suggest looking at this canonical Q/A. In my case, I had to scavenge the internet and get the .dmg from some random website.\n\nA: It may be that boot-up from the USB flash drive is \"prohibited\" because your USB flash drive requires adjustment to the \"ownership\" settings. I learned this the hard way myself. Most of the guides, including Apple's own support doc on how to create a bootable Mac OS installer on USB — as of this date — fail to mention the ownership step.\nFirst and foremost, the USB flash drive must support ownership functionality. Complicating matters, the USB flash drive default may disable boot support. For this reason, you will need to enable it before/after completing the process described by Apple, MacWorld and others using the \"createinstallmedia\" command in the Terminal window.\nThe \"missing step\", after ensuring the USB flash drive is formatted correctly, is to ignore ownership\n\n*\n\n*Mounting the USB flash drive on the desktop, right click and select \"Get Info\"\n\n*In the info window, expand the Sharing & Permissions: section.\n\n*Click the padlock icon to unlock administrator options .\n\n*Enter your administrative password.\n\n*Deselect the check box ignore ownership\n\n*Click the padlock to save the changes.\n\n*Eject the drive if you're ready to remove the USB Drive and install\n\nOn the machine you wish to install on, you can hold down the Option (ALT) key to select the boot drive, select your installer. If you can't see it, reset the PRAM and try again. If you still can't boot from the USB flash drive, verify that you created the Mac OS installer on the USB flash drive while working in the same (or as close to) current Mac OS as you intend to write to the USB flash drive. Some users have problems creating a successful bootable USB flash drive because they attempt to follow Apple's instructions on older versions of Mac OS X that require Disk Utility, not the Terminal window \"createinstallmedia\" command, to create a bootable USB flash drive. If all else fails, try a different name-brand flash drive of at least 8 gigabytes or greater in size. (Do keep in mind that there are a lot of counterfeits sold by third parties on Ebay and Amazon so it's equally important to buy your USB flash drive new from a reputable source.)\nThe most thorough guide I have found on the topic of creating a bootable Mac OS installer on a USB flash drive is here:\nhttps://www.lifewire.com/create-emergency-os-x-boot-device-2260173\n\nA: Upon startup, press Cmd+Opt+R, this will allow you to install the latest \"available+compatible\" version of macOS for your laptop.\nFor example, on a MacBook 2012, the factory OS shipped with the Macbook is macOS Lion version, if you press Cmd+R, it will attempt to re-download the \"Lion\" version, which is not available and it will fail to download. In stead, with Cmd+Opt+R, it will download macOS High Sierra.\n\nA: I've tried creating a bootble OSX drive from a Windows, it just causes errors during installation so I recommend doing it from a Mac or a friend's Mac\n\nA: Follow the steps from the link below to create a OS X USB installer:\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/2981585/operating-systems/how-to-make-a-bootable-os-x-10-11-el-capitan-installer-drive.html\nPS: use USB 2.0 storage device to do it and it's gonna work! USB 3.0 storage devices will not work for this!\n\nA: Check if the version of macOS you are trying to install is supported by the computer. This Mac OS Compatibility Guide provides a nice overview as a table, there is also this post on discussions.apple.com. Finally, you could also check the dedicated pages on apple.com, for instance this one for El Capitan.\nIf your computer supports the version, retry with different USB sticks, SD cards (with an adapter) or even a USB hard drive. I got this sign on two different older USB sticks, while a third, newer one worked immediately, following the exact same procedure.\n", "Q: How to force Mail.app to ask for Gmail password? I recently changed my Gmail account's password. The account in Mail.app is offline as expected (\"Login Failed\"), but there seems no way to input the new password:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no password input field in Mail→Preferences→Accounts anymore. The fields Incoming Mail Server and Usernamecontain the right information, but they are greyed out (cannot be changed).\n\n*System Preferences→Internet Accounts: \"Mail\" is checked, but clicking on the \"Details…\" button only shows two editable fields: Description and Name.\n\n\nI tried to force Mail.app/Internet accounts Prefs to ask for the new password by deleting the imap.gmail.com entries in Keychain.app, but it did nothing.\nWhere do I input the new password? Alternatively, how do I force Mail.app to ask for the new password? (A webview panel should popup, where I can input the password.)\nDeleting and setting up my gmail account anew in Mail.app is not an option. I'm running OS X 10.11.3. Google 2FA is enabled. \n\nA: Go to Mail -> Preferences -> Accounts -> Accounts Information Tab and click Outgoing Mail Server drop-down menu. Select 'Edit SMTP Server List'\n\nClick Advanced tab and in the Authentication field select 'Password'. Enter your new password in the according field.\n\nHope this help.\n\nA: An alternative way to force the mail application to ask for your password is to write a new email, send it to some test address (a friend maybe, or another account you have yourself, say an icloud account or a yahoo account etc.)\nWhen you try to send it, the mail application should create a large \"Google style\" dialog box, a bit like you might see on a Google sign-in dialog on a typical Google web service such as YouTube.\nEnter the password there; it will be cached somewhere internal, so it should keep working. No idea where it gets stored.\nThis works with my Gmail account that is set up in IMAP. I assume this is the result of that accounts menu option \"Automatically detect and maintain account settings\".\n\nA: A late post. But, I thought of sharing a simple solution that worked for me. Instead of Mail --> Preferences, going to Mail --> Accounts and clicking on the failed gmail account will launch a popup with a password box and correct password input will login successfully.  \n\nA: I would say go to Mail -> Preferences -> Gmail -> Advanced. There is a box labeled \"Automatically detect and maintain account settings\". Uncheck it. You should now be able to edit the respective fields (including password.) However, this seems to be greyed out for me as well, so I'm not sure.\nI'm not sure if this will work, but try it.\nGo to Mail -> Preferences -> Gmail -> Account Information -> Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP) -> Edit SMTP Server List... Under authentication add some form (I'd try password first).\nTo check if this worked, go to Window -> Connection Doctor and make sure everyone is green and happy.\n", "Q: Buying itunes gift card for friend in NL I have a friend's birthday who lives in the Netherlands (I live in the UK). Is there any way I can buy a gift card from the netherlands that will send to them? Googling seems to throw up a lot of sites - not many of which seem trustworthy. Many thanks!\n\nA: Yes.

Referring to iMessages, not SMS. Pasting text ~20,800 characters long gives an error that the message is too long on my Mac. What's the limit?\n\nA: (This answer doesn't apply to the latest version of Messages in 10.12 which appears capable of sending VERY large messages)\nTL;DR; In 10.10.5 the limit is 18996 but you can't paste in a block that large.\nThis isn't the answer you want but it's the answer you should listen to:\niMessage isn't designed for sending huge long messages. Write an email instead.\nBut if you really want an answer the max characters is 18996 but the catch is that iMessage on OSX (10.10.5) won't let you paste in a single block of text that big. Try breaking up and pasting in smaller 1000 character chunks if you must use this platform to send large amounts of text.\n\nA: As of macOS 10.12 iMessage (Messages app) seems to be able to send arbitrarily long messages without breaking them up or returning an error. \nI have managed to send very large messages over 25k characters at this point. iOS then displays these in a larger message format that makes it easier to read the message when it is expanded.\n", "Q: Erase in Adobe Sketch?

I was thinking of moving my documents folder to iCloud then just creating a symlink to them on my computer (is this a bad idea in the first place, is there a more elegant solution?) However I would like to know if I would not have access to my documents if I have no internet connection?\n\nA: Any alias needs the real data available in order to work with it.  There are two aliases available in Mac OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*Finder alias\n\n*Symbolic link\n\n\nFINDER ALIAS\nA Finder alias stores some information, like where a file is to be found and what login information is required to access the file share that file is located on. It does not store the login information, but knows which they use (in case it is stored in your keychain). If it is opened, a Finder alias will see, if the file is already available and if not will try to establish the connection of the remote drive, if possible, then open the file.\nSYMBOLIC LINK\nA symbolic link is simply a link information on where a file is to be looked for. If that file is moved, renamed or the remote share is disconnected a symbolic link becomes broken. A broken symbolic link can be \"repaired\" by moving that file back into place, renaming it back to how it was named before or reconnecting the remote share again. Otherwise, you would need to delete and recreate the symbolic link with the new location or name.\nAt any rate, for working with a file's information offline, you would need to have that information available offline and not just a link.\n", "Q: Can iPhone show the name of number previosely texted from me?

The site appreviewtimes.com croudsources reports from iOS developers to figure out the current average iOS/Mac apps review time:\n\nDoes apple reveal any information about the current review queue size?\n\nA: Apple provides no information on the queue size, just that it may take at least 7 days for your app to be reviewed.\nAppreviewtimes.com is a very good site for estimated review times, I have found it to be very accurate.\n\nA: Apple doesn't say anything about the size of the queue, but they do give this information on review times on the developer website (emphasis mine):\n\nReview times may vary by app. On average, 50% of apps are reviewed in 24 hours and over 90% are reviewed in 48 hours. If your submission is incomplete, review times may be further delayed or your app may be rejected.\n\n", "Q: How to check which files have been copied to the main hard drive and which ones have not been copied? I formatted my MacBook main drive some months ago and, in order to not lose data, I created a .dmg image of the hard drive before the formatting procedure and saved it to an external device. \nThen, some days ago, I started a kind of data restoring, coping most of the backup files back to the main drive. \nNow, I would like to check if all these mentioned files have really been copied back to my Macbook. Due to this, I am looking for an application theoretically able to analyze the files (in particular, their name, hash, etc.) contained in my external drive and find corresponding files on my Macintosh hard drive; if a  corresponding file is not found, the file should be highlighted. If a similar application actually exists, can you suggest it to me?\nIf there is not an application with the features above explained, can you suggest me a brief Bash script or AppleScript able to do that? I'm not familiar with both these languages, but I have a little Batch scripting background and I was thinking about some statements - e.g. the for loop, md5, etc. - which generate a filename plus MD5 checksum list for both drives, and which find correspondances. What about this? Can you suggest me some examples? \n\nNote: This is not the same as How to confirm that a file has copied to a new disk without any errors?. The new data structure on the main drive is a bit different compared to the previous one, which is stored in the external drive. Due to this, a standard folder/volume comparison with a dry rsync run is not exactly what I am looking for.\n\nA: From my experience I may recommend Path Finder app (http://www.cocoatech.com/pathfinder/).\nIt has very powerful Commands -> Folder Sync command that does exactly what you are asking for: shows synced files and those you may need to copy left or right. They are highlighted with different color.\nApp has free trial period (fully functional) and then asks for some money, but it's totally worth the price.\n\nRed arrows just show some random directories. You can select your own, including those on different volumes. And you can compare file content is required.\n\nA: Using a bit of Bash and some nice utilities is possible to compare MD5 of every single file. I will assume here that the same MD5 means the same content.\nMake MD5 of everything:\nfind /one/dir -type f | xargs md5 > one.txt\nfind /other/dir -type f | xargs md5 > other.txt\n\nCompare every MD5 in order to find what is missing where:\ndiff -u <(cut -d'=' -f2 one.txt | sort) <(cut -d'=' -f2 other.txt | sort) > diff.txt\n\nOnly found in /one/dir:\ngrep -f <(sed -n 's/^- //p' diff.txt) one.txt\n\nOnly found in /other/dir:\ngrep -f <(sed -n 's/^+ //p' diff.txt) other.txt\n\nLet me know if this works.\n", "Q: Timemachine Mac Mini with 2 Hard Drives I have a mac mini server with 2 Hard Drives, one for the system and active files (Server HD) and one serving as an archive (Archive HD).

But like this, all I can do is add circles that will pop up in random places of the photo. \nNo clue how to fix this, please help. Thanks in advance! \n\nA: This answer in the Apple Discussions/Communities suggests that this behavior (inability to move the naming circle) is a bug in Photos; to remedy it requires restarting the Photos app (which may not be as easy as just quitting and then double-clicking the app icon, perhaps requiring a system reboot).\nAfter just experiencing this problem with Photos version 1.5 running on El Capitan (MacOS 10.11.6), rebooting worked to clear it for me. \n\nA: Drag anywhere in the circle to move the selection area & use the dot on the right to resize.\nX on the left to cancel.\n\n", "Q: Compatibility of Mid 2011 MacBook Air 13\" Parts I am replacing the upper case of my MBA 2011 13\", I found something on eBay but am unsure on the compatibility, my serial number is, C02GRGLVDJWT. \nLink to the part: 13\" Apple MacBook Air A1466 Palmrest Upper Top Case 069-8219-A.

I have many Notes that are formatted using bold, italics, carriage returns, etc.\nHow can I save these Notes off to my Windows laptop via iTunes or some third-party software, while preserving the formatting of my Notes? Such software would need to be able to sync those Notes back to my iPhone, while still preserving all the rich text.\nSince I put sensitive information in my notes, I want everything to remain local to my devices, so I don’t want to use iCloud.\n\nA: TLDR:\nIn Notes on your iOS device: Export (Share) the note via email to yourself. Then you can copy-paste it nicely from the email.\n\nI just figured out how to keep iOS note formatting in ipad Microsoft Word.  you can open your iOS note and send it to an email.  Once it opens the email, select all and copy to clipboard.  For some reason it keeps the formatting this way even though it won't if you had copied directly from notes.  I then pasted it into a Microsoft word document, and it kept all the formatting.  So far this was the only way I could get it to keep the formatting outside of notes.\n\nA: *\n\n*The new version of iCloud Notes, available at https://www.icloud.com/#notes2, supports viewing rich text notes with formatting.\n\n*Notes in OS X, besides viewing and editing rich text notes, supports exporting notes as PDF. Select the note you wish to export and choose File → Export as PDF….\n\n\nA: Copy and paste them into TextEdit and save in RTF. This requires synchronising notes with iCloud or IMAP.\n\nA: Newer versions of iOS don't even support syncing notes to Outlook as plain text anymore.  iOS notes only sync to iCloud now, and we Windows folks who like accessing our data directly via files are left to fend for ourselves.  \nI would look at CopyTrans Contacts which has nascent iCloud notes support.  I was able to use it to retrieve my notes from iCloud with SOME rich text formatting, albeit slightly mangled in places, and missing attached images, as HTML files on my PC.  \nAlso, it loses the creation and last edited date for the notes (syncing to Outlook Notes preserved the date).  If the CopyTrans folks can figure out how to preserve the date, pull down any images and fix the formatting problems, we'll have a decent solution.  \nFor now, it's better than nothing, and your only other option is to e-mail all your notes to yourself (it's okay if you have 100 or less notes and an evening to do it, but for those of us with a few thousand accumulated over the years, not so doable).  \nAlso, if you can program, you might try googling Apple iCloud API, and see if they have an interface where you can pull your notes down from code (who knows)...\n", "Q: How can I create a reminder on my Apple Watch? I would like to create an iCloud reminder using my Apple Watch while running.

I have two email accounts on my iPhone: Cox and Gmail.\nEach accounts have few messages in their respective Inbox.  No attachments.\nThe Draft, Sent, and Trash folders are empty.\nYet, with time, the size of this app continues to grow and take up more of the free space on my iPhone 5: and its size is limited, the 16 GB model,\nof which 12.5 GB is available to the user.  I am running iOS 8.4.1.\nIt's as if there is garbage collection that isn't taking place and the storage space doesn't get freed-up.  Think about how hard drive space may get freed-up after sectors are freed-up when you defrag a Windows hard-drive.\nBattery Doctor helps free up cache space, etc., but does not affect the Mail app.  My Mail app now takes up 3.0 GB of space!\nI have tried removing the accounts, and then setting them up fresh, but this doesn't help… the space is still taken.  I have performed factory resets on the iPhone where it is wiped clean and then have all apps reinstalled, but the problem still exists.  And, so far, I do not have a program that saves my Notes off to my laptop and maintains the formatting of the text, e.g. Bold, Italic, carriage returns, etc.  So, trying to recover the iPhone to the way it was is a real hassle, and the Mail app doesn't reduce in size… it will continue to grow.

I have a multiple monitor setup with displays not having separate Spaces. Usually, when using a shortcut key to change spaces, I see a nice animation where one space slides to the left, and the new space slides in from the right.\nHowever, once I have around six \"desktops\" and/or a certain number (unknown) of windows open, the animation displays a black screen when sliding the new space into place. Happens in both \"directions\" - the current space slides left/right, and the black screen slides in. Once the changing of the space is complete, the black goes away and the desktop reappears. This video shows the phenomena at 0:15s.\nAnyone encounter this and find out why this might be occurring? Never happened with the same hardware using OS X versions prior to 10.10.\n\nA: It is not a GPU issue.\nWith OS X 10.11, this can be corrected by turning Dashboard off or setting it as an overlay (System Preferences>Mission Control).\n\nA: Had that same issue because I had ScreenShade installed.

I'd like to upgrade the OS to the most recent version (compatibly with the hardware and other stuff...), but I don't now how this works.\nThe questions are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the Mac \"connected\" to an account? (Actually I use it with no problem, but ...)\n\n*To upgrade the OS, do I need to use an Apple account? (I think yes.) Does this account have to be associated with some purchase done in the past?\n\n*Can I downgrade if something goes wrong?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*I'm not sure what you mean. You need to be more specific. If it's that the Mac is tied to an Apple ID, no: only the current installation and user accounts are.\n\n*Yes, you'll need one to download the installer unless you get it some other way (someone else downloads it, you use internet recovery, etc.)\n\n*Sort of. To my knowledge, you can only do so if you have a Time Machine backup of relevant files from before your upgrade.

How can I migrate so that I keep everything from my old hard drive to my new SSD. I cannot loose software or files.\n\nA: There are a variety of ways you can do this. I'll cover the two cleanest ways here.\nRestoring the disk from the source or image\nThis will require that you have simultaneous access to at least two disks.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you can't access the HDD and SSD simultaneously, Image the HDD to another disk you can access via Disk Utility.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot via Internet Recovery (recommended) or an external bootable volume/installer.\n\n*Select your HDD in Disk Utility.\n\n*Click \"Image\" in the menu bar (if it's not there, add it by right clicking and dragging it in.)\n\n*Save your image to an external volume.\n\n\n*Install the SSD.\n\n*Boot via Internet Recovery (recommended) or an external bootable volume/installer.\n\n*Open Disk Utility.\n\n*Restore the SSD from the HDD or image of the HDD.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select your SSD in the sidebar of Disk Utility.\n\n*Click \"Restore\" in the menu bar (if it's not there, add it by right clicking and dragging it in).\n\n*Select the proper volume/image.\n\n*Restore\n\n\n\nUsing Migration Assistant\nThis will require you have simultaneous access to the two disks from two separate Macs or a Time Machine backup of your HDD.\nFollow the instructions from here.\n\nA: What I'm suggesting I think is an easy solution. You can use Time Machine (if you never used it you can set-up the backup of the entire HDD in an external disk) and with backup tool you automatically save the entire content of your HDD naturally assuming your external disk is large enough. \nAfter this procedure, you can install the new SSD drive(that must have the same dimension of the previous HDD and so 500 GB) in the MacBook and procede with a restore from external disk procedure using Time Machine (obtained by press cmd + R when you boot the MacBook). \nWith this procedure you'll change the disk from HDD to SSD and keep all the content of your PC.\n\nA: Okay, this is what I would do, upload ALL your files to iCloud, create a full system backup, this is a great thing to at night, while your sleeping, as it will take some time. \nAfter that has completed. \nShut your mac down. \nThen.\nOpen up your computer, the hard drive if I remember correctly can be removed easily, but!

I would use something like - tar -xvf, but with what attributes?\nAfterwards I want to pack every folder in SomeDirectory again back to RandomName.spa, (keeping the name of folder). The command would be tar -cvf, but with what attributes?\n\nA: Assuming that (1) the .spa files are actually .tar archives, (2) you are in SomeDirectory, and (3) that directories with the names of the archives you want to extract do not exist, the following piece of code should achieve what you want:\nfor a in *.spa\n  do a_dir=`expr $a : '\\(.*\\).spa'`\n  mkdir $a_dir\n  tar -xvf $a -C $a_dir;\ndone\n\nOr in case you prefer a one-liner:\nfor a in *.spa; do a_dir=`expr $a : '\\(.*\\).spa'`; mkdir $a_dir; tar -xvf $a -C $a_dir; done\n\nThe first line in the for loop strips the .spa from the archive name and assigns it to a variable, which is used in the second line to make a directory with that name, and in the third line in tar with the -C argument.\nThe -C argument in tar only changes directory during extraction and doesn't actually make one, making things a a bit more complicated than they should be.\nCredit: This answer is a slight modification of https://superuser.com/a/748567/226246\n", "Q: ITerm2 Console connection to Cisco equipment Control-A does not work I connect to Cisco Equipment via console cable and am currently trying to use ITerm2.  \nThe problem is I cannot get the Control-A (Move to beginning of line) command to work.

I lost a years worth of backups.\nSo it would really set my mind at ease if there was a way to clean up these open files and perhaps ensure the integrity of the file system on my external disk.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: These files are open because Spotlight is indexing your Time Machine backup. Sadly this is now a requirement in El Capitan, which one presumes you are running: \n\nIf you add a Time Machine backup disk to the privacy list, you will continue to see messages that Spotlight is indexing your backup disk. This indexing is necessary for Time Machine to function properly and can’t be disabled. Spotlight does exclude from searches any items you store on your backup disk that are not part of a Time Machine backup.\n\nI find that this Spotlight indexing slows down the ability to stop an in-progress backup and eject the external disk.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro never goes to sleep I got a brand new mid-2015 MacBook Pro 15\", OSX 10.11.3.\nDisplay never turns off even it is configured to turn off after 10 mins in power adapter AND in battery mode. Screen saver (aerial) stays active forever. I tried disconnecting all USB peripherals connected - it did not help.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Back when the Aerial screen saver was first released there was a bug that would prevent Macs from going to sleep. The developer fixed that bug a while ago. If this is still an issue for anyone they should try download the latest version of the screen saver from the following link.\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases\nFor those that are curious. The screen saver was originally written to use AVPlayerView which by design keeps Macs awake when its playing a video. Aerial's developer rewrote the screen saver to use AVPlayerLayer instead, which does allow Macs to sleep when they are playing video but otherwise idle.\n\nA: Look, it returns the terminal command:\npmset -g assertions\n\n", "Q: Import iBooks folder? I was running iTunes 11 under Snow Leopard and syncing to an old iPad, the very first one. \nNow, the latest iPad (pro) needs iTunes 11, which needed higher than Snow Leo, so I'm running it under Yosemite. All apps seem to have moved ok, but the iBooks were all left behind. \nIs there a simple way to import the folder of iBooks to iTunes 12 to load to the iPad? \n\nA: Since Mavericks, iBooks is the app that handles the books/PDFs, you can \"add to library\" the books right from the old iTunes folder, and then sync to your iPad. \nIt offers features to handle books that iTunes didn't, such as adding categories and organizing from the application on the Mac, instead of doing it from your iPad. \n", "Q: Upgrade Macbook Pro from 10.6.8 to 10.8 I am considering upgrading my Macbook Pro with 2GB of memory from 10.6.8 to 10.8 (Mountain Lion).\nAre there any other considerations for upgrading?\nIs this generally a good idea?\n\nA: This is a somewhat subjective question. I would personally recommend upgrading to 8 GB of memory and an SSD, but since you're still within the boundaries of the minimum specs, there's no definitive answer. Outside of making sure that all the software you'll need to have working will work, you don't really need to consider anything. I would personally recommend upgrading to Mavericks as it's better supported and optimized then Mountain Lion, and El Cap is not out of the question either.\n", "Q: How to increase Macintosh-HD main drive partition size? In my mac mini, It’s containt 500 GB HDD. It is a four partition and size described below. Please review below attached image.\n    1.  Macintosh HD - 150 GB Main Drive\n    2.  D-Drive - 125 GB\n    3.  E-Drive - 125 GB\n    4.  F-Drive - 98.6 GB.\nNow, in this case i want to increase SIZE of main Macintosh HD drive if possible without formatting the the any drive. I want make it 200 GB+/-.\nSo, I have a extra free space in D-Drive and E-Drive. Can i merge these extra space in main Macintosh HD drive without data losses or formatting?\nPlease share your suggestion, tutorial and so on. \nI have tried to do using Disk Utility but i am not succeed. Please help me.\nAttachment:\n\nThank You! \n\nA: First, boot from Recovery HD by pressing Cmd-R on startup. You will need to do this because modifications will be made to the startup drive (in this case, it's size).\nNow, from Recovery, open Disk Utility and select your Drive D/E. I'm going to assume you've moved all the data on these drives off, and they are empty now. This process will delete all the data on the Drive D/E partitions.\nSelect the partition of Drive D/E and press the minus button beneath the pie chart to delete the partition. You'll have to do this twice as you have two partitions you'd like to merge with another.\nNow, select Macintosh HD and drag the small circle over to fill up the space left behind by the now nonexistent Drive D/E partitions. Alternatively, just enter a really big value greater than all three partitions combined (900 will do) and Disk Utility will reduce it automatically to fill up whatever available space remains.\nClick Apply and the above steps should be written to disk. After it's done you should see one big Macintosh HD partition spanning roughly 400GB. You can now reboot to your normal system.\n(as all good advice goes, it's always strongly recommended to make a backup of your data in case something goes wrong. Time Machine or a disk image to an external drive will do.)\n", "Q: How do I prove I own/am the developer of an iOS app? I am currently in the process of trying to secure a visa for overseas work. I recently developed an iOS app and need to provide proof or ownership or that I developed it. Is there a way to go about this? Can Apple provide a certificate or something? Any advice on this would be really appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: Is you app available in App Store? Is your name officially mentioned there as the author. If yes, then I would consider this as a proof.\nAre you talking about being iOS developer in general or developer of particular iOS app? If first case is true then maybe your certificates of employment could solve the problem?\n\nA: You have the private key (developer signing certificate) that signed the application in the App Store. Sign (encrypt) a message containing your name with that private key, then tell the person wanting to verify your identity to decrypt that message with your public key (that is contained within the application). Your private key, and only your private key, can encrypt a message that can be successfully decrypted with your public key.\nIt's technical, I know, but this is the only guaranteed way to verify the identity of an application's developer.\n", "Q: How can I use the automator to create text-to-speech service that talks faster than the current service?

I simply dragged the \"Speak text\" action, saved it and tested it. It seems that my new service still relies on the speed option specified in the preferences. \nIs there a way for me to tell it something like \"render speech at 400wpm\"\n\nA: Do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the \"Speak text\" action.\n\n*Add the \"Run AppleScript\" action.\n\n*Clear all the default text in the action.\n\n*Copy/paste this script in the action:\n\n\n\non run {input, parameters}\n  repeat with thisText in input\n      say thisText speaking rate 400\n  end repeat\nend run\n\n\nIf you want a specific voice, append using \"SomeVoiceName\" after the say command.\nExample : say thisText speaking rate 400 using \"Bruce\" -- Bruce is a name of the voice\n", "Q: Finder's incorrect PDF Filesize A few PDF files are showing with the incorrect filesize and I was wondering if there is any way to fix this.\nE.g. opening a PDF file's properties is showing that the file is 394 KB, if I attach the file to an email or upload it by FTP somewhere else I get the file's real size which is 289 KB\nThis behaviour seems to be happening with any PDF file on my computer.\nIs there a setting that can be changed or something to fix this?\nThis is happening for me on El Capitan 10.11.3\n\nA: This is typically caused by resource forks that are local and don't get sent with the file in the email. You can view these and their sizes using ls in Terminal using:\nls -lah@ <filename>\n\nor just leave filename blank to display this for the contents of the current directory.\n", "Q: How do I delete something only on my device and still preserve it in cloud? I still have a very vague understadning of how iCloud Library and the new 'Photos' app operate. How do I distinguish between photos on my device and what is stored in cloud. How do I delete something only on my device and still preserve it in cloud? \nRight now I have 2215 photos and 6 videos in iCloud they say. Ok, so where are my all other videos that I was forced to delete due to insufficient space? \nI guess I can always use something different like Google Drive, Dropbox or Picasa to back it all up manually and have complete access to it all the time, but I just want to understand if Apple's new solution is completely useless. \n\nA: To strictly answer your question, it is not possible to delete something from your device and have it remain and accessible from iCloud Photo Library. \nHere's more details:\nThe idea behind iCloud Photos Library is to have all your photos on all your devices. Picture a parent of a small family in California who takes, on average, several photos a week and has a Mac, iPad, and iPhone. When they take a photo on their iPhone, it syncs to their other two devices automatically so that when they arrive home, they can open their computer and view the photos or videos they took. Pretty cool? Yes, for some situations it's ideal. \nBut there's a problem, if you don't have enough storage on your phone to hold all of the photos, iCloud Library is stuck until you open settings and allow it to optimize your device storage. It then saves low resolution photos to your device and will download the high resolution version when you view the photo. This too is convenient in some situations. \nThe problem comes in when you want to control what photos go where. I've taken thousands of photos and videos on my iPhone and I don't want all of those on my phone even if I could have that. But with iCloud Library enabled, all of your photos will be on your device as there is no way to control what images are in the cloud versus on your device. So, it seems that Apple's solution to your problem of having too many photos and videos on your phone would be to enable the option to optimize device storage. \nHowever, here is, by far, the biggest problem with iCloud Photo Library and the \"optimize device storage\" option. If you enable that setting, and then go to disable it at some point, it will attempt to download the full resolution version of all your images (not just the device-optimized high-resolution one). This makes sense, but causes a problem as your device likely wouldn't have near enough storage by then to handle that. Consequently, that's probably not the approach you would want to take. \nTo summarize: use iCloud Photo Library if you don't take (or keep) a lot of photos and if you have more than one Apple device. Otherwise, it's probably better to avoid it. \n", "Q: Broken Windows startup after repartitioning drive I run Windows 10 on my boot camp partition. Yesterday I created a new partition on my disk to store my shared documents between two operating systems by resizing the OS X partition.\nToday I noticed that Windows doesn't load.\n\nI have the installation media but didn't want to mess with partitions as I know nothing about how boot camp works.\nIs there a way I can repair my Windows installation or do I have to reinstall? \n\nA: One should never try to change drive partitions under Windows (Boot Camp): this makes Windows unbootable. I do afraid that now you have to re-create boot camp partition and reinstall Windows. \nAnyway there're (proved by people) ways (see links 1, 2, 3) to achieve what you want. \nPS. I personally prefer and recommend external Thunderbolt drive for the 3rd partition shared between mac/windows\n", "Q: My Mac displays some glitches Sometimes my Mac Mini, plugged to an LG IPS screen, display some Glitches. For example, times ago, in my Launchpad appears these glitches:\n  \nTo solve these glitches I had to restart the Mac.\nNow in my Safari's Top Sites there's this: \n\n(all these glitches were immortalised with screenshots).\nHowever sometimes, when I wake my Mac from sleep, all the screen appear with a green tint, in that case, taking a screenshot, it appear without issues and, to solve the issue, is enough just put the Mac in sleep than wake it up again.\nI can't understand the cause, Apple's Genius says that, for him, is the HDMI cable, my scare is that the trouble is the GPU because my AppleCare will expire soon... For you where is the problem? Are there some test to do?\n\nA: If the Genius said that the problem is in the cable, you should try swapping the cable.\nWith that said, TEST YOUR GPU NOW. If there's indeed a problem, you really want to get it fixed now.\nRun Apple Hardware Test (if you computer was released before June 2013) or Apple Diagnostics. Make sure that you run the relevant tests. Run some sort of GPU stress test like Unigine Heaven. If anything seems to be triggering errors, bring it to the Apple Store and try to get them to replace it. GPU replacement is expensive and you'd be much better off having Apple pay for it than you.\n", "Q: How can I upload videos to Flickr using Uploadr?

Is this possible?\n\nA: If you are not afraid of using Terminal.app, you can run\nsudo du -sh /Applications/* /Applications/Utilities/*\n\nto get the size of each application.\n\nA: The full answer is not easily. The short answer is for most apps, you can ignore the settings, preferences and other files stored outside of the Application binary and can open /Applications in Finder and enable calculate all folder sizes:\nOpen a finder window:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command + Shift + A - go to applications\n\n*Command + 2 - show the list view\n\n*Command + J - pull up that folder's view options\n\n*Select the Calculate all sizes control\n\n\nThe system will then add up all the storage for each app and you can click on the size column to sort it. A general purpose tool like Daisy Disk or What Size might also help you keep tabs on the files an application might store in /Library since apps like Garage band or Logic Pro can download significant amount of sound loops and instruments - but they usually tell you explicitly before those downloads start.\n", "Q: NTFS drive is not mounted after changing /etc/fstab I edited the fstab file in order to enable writing on ntfs drives and added all three of my external ntfs drives to it. Two of them work fine.\nThe third one which I added by label because it did not have a uuid, however, is not mounted after editing.\nI am on El Capitan by the way.\n\nA: Generally the mount command is not used under the OS X operating system. Apple has there own command called diskutil. This basically the command line version of the Disk Utility application. The command line version has more functionality than the UI version. If an external drive is recognized by OS X, it will show up under diskutil list as /dev/diskX were X is a positive integer. To mount a drive enter the following command.\ndiskutil mountDisk /dev/diskX\n\nTo unmount use the following.\ndiskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX\n\nPartition Y on disk X is denoted as /dev/disk/XsY as shown in diskutil list. To mount and unmount a partition use the following.\ndiskutil mount /dev/diskXsY\ndiskutil unmount /dev/diskXsY\n\nThe mount command can used to see if a partition is currently mounted. Just enter the command without any options.\nBe default NTFS partitions are mounted as read only. I guess there is a way to mount without the protection of read only status, but from what I have read this is unsafe. \nCompanies such as Paragon offer software that allows OS X to write to NTFS volumes. I have never used such software.\n\nA: I changed the name of that volume and it worked.\n\nA: I was using mounty and after head aches for couple weeks I found this forum and like The “ssd352” I changed the volume name and right now working fine on High Sierra.\nI edited the /etc/fstab and added UUID= instead LABEL=\nLike this UUID= (search it over terminal diskutil info /dev/disk or diskutil volume name) nome ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse\n\n", "Q: Internal (Apple SSD) hard drive problem I'm having terrible issues with my Mac since I tried to restore the entire system from a Time Machine backup, which ended up showing a \"an error occurred while adding a recovery system to the destination disk\" message. I restarted and held cmd+R and Internet Recovery started downloading (instead of booting to the recovery partition). After the download, the menu of OS X utilities appeared and I selected Disk Utility and then I erased the Macintosh HD.\nTried to restore from Time Machine again but the problem persists. I even tried to reinstall OS X: after downloading OS X Mavericks, I got \"an error occurred while preparing installation\".\nHere you can see the results of diskutil cs list and diskutil list commands:\n[\nAs you can see, I have no CoreStorage Logical Volume Groups and I don't see the Recovery HD partition in disk0.\n\nA: I do believe OS X Base System is the name of the mounted Recovery Partition image.\nI would suggest completely erasing every last partition on your drive (except Recovery), recreating a Macintosh HD partition, and reinstalling OS X onto the newly partitioned Macintosh HD.\nAs for restoring your data, you can use Migration Assistant (/Applications/Utilities/Migration Assistant.app) to restore data from the Time Machine backup after you get a working system, or better, use the \"Enter Time Machine\" functionality from the TM menubar dropdown.\n", "Q: Is it normal for a MacBook Pro battery to regenerate itself? Let me first give a quick background. I got the 2015 MBP 15\" with Retina display second hand like a week ago. As every normal person who just switched from Windows to Mac I was doing this and that and testing the battery life. No external software was used for the battery tests, only normal usage. I also got few battery tools which show more detailed information about the current state. \nHere it comes the question. My battery's max capacity seems to be..regenerating itself..\n2 days ago this information was taken from one of the tools:\n\nAnd here it comes the surprise. Today I took another look and had this shot taken:\n\nAs you can see the second picture shows that the Current max is higher, which I believe is strange ? Shouldn't it be going the other way - being lower with every cycle ?\nThe tools I've used show the same information, so it is not an issue there. They are Battery Health and CoconutBattery.\n\nA: There are a lot of possible explanations.  The indicator that reads battery status isn't a perfect measure.  I've seen that kind of behavior on mobile phones (uneven discharge followed by a \"full charge\" don't necessarily give a perfect indication of actual battery capacity).  Given that the difference you observed is around 150 mAh (out of 8755?), the difference is pretty low (less than 2%), I'd expect that to be within a margin of error for the tool.\nIt's also possible that the tool you're using to check capacity might be measuring total capacity by the time it took to charge the battery from a \"low\" state to the current state, and extrapolated max capacity from there.  That's an indirect measurement, and could be off by as much as a percent or two.\nYou're right, though, a LiPo battery doesn't really \"improve\" with age.\n\nA: Small variations in the reported maximum battery capacity are perfectly normal, and don't mean that your battery is actually regenerating itself.\n", "Q: How can I alternate stopping the spinning disk and the fans? I have a little bit of noise that I'd like to eliminate. It only bothers me in the dead of night, but at that time complete silence is a true blessing.\nMy Macbook Pro has a spinning disk and two fans. I'd like to stop each (both fans and the disk) independently, even for just a few seconds, to determine which is producing what tone of sound.\nWith smcFanControl I can raise the fan speed. Is it dangerous to stop the fans for even 5 seconds if I'll be running absolutely nothing (besides the base OS)? Is there a command-line hack to force this to happen?\nUnder Energy Saver in the Preferences I already have \"Put hard disks to sleep whenever possible\" checked. But it doesn't seem that that sleep-mode ever kicks in. How can I nudge the disk to stop for a few seconds?\nAn experiment is to replace the spinning disk with an SSD, and I may be heading in that direction anyway, but I'd like to confirm whether the fans are the culprit and that another solution (putting the Macbook Pro in the printer drawer? Getting a fanless MacBook?) will remain anyway my target before just spending time and money on the experiment.\n\nA: As mentioned in my comment, your best bet to reduce noise would be to migrate to a computer with an SSD drive or replace the drive in your existing computer. The noise from a standard hard drive is highly variable, while the noise from a fan set at a constant speed with fan control software would be white noise. \nIn regards to turning off the fan entirely, that would be risky as the Mac not only has tight tolerances that allow heat to build up quickly when the fan is off, but the OS on Macs has regular cron jobs that kick off in the middle of the night- jobs which can cause the CPU to spike in use and generate heat.\nA better bet is to just keep the fan on a constant, but lower speed using fan control software. Say around 1500-2000 rpm.\nThat plus an SSD should allow you to have manageable sound levels, while retaining the performance of a full MacBook Pro, as opposed to the less powerful fanless MacBook or MacBook Air.\nFor the near term verification need, I'd recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*going to a local electronics store with a minimum 14 day return policy (Amazon would also work), purchasing an SSD drive and a hard drive enclosure\n\n*Then install the SSD drive in your computer and the old hard drive in the external enclosure\n\n*Then manually install Mac OS X to the new SSD and, using the external enclosure, restore your data to the new SSD drive from the old hard drive.\n\n*monitor the sounds levels over a week or so to see if they've improved.\n\n*If not, then you can swap the hard drives and use the external enclosure as a means to allow you to wipe the new SSD. Then you can return both of them to the store. \n\n\nIf you really want to risk your system's stability and potentially cause damage, you cannot use Mac OS X, as Apple has it locked down to prevent turning off the fans. \nIf you can dual boot with Windows or Linux with boot camp you can use the app called \"speedfan\" in Windows or a terminal command in Linux, \"pwmconfig\".  Both of those might allow you to turn off the fans completely, but at a risk of system damage.\n\nA: You can use free Macs Fan Control app to set minimum RPM for each of your fans, this will make them almost noiseless. \n\nA: What I understand from your question is that you are trying to determine whether it is your TSM HDD (traditional spinning media) or your fan that is making the noise.\nThe easiest way to do this is to remove the HDD and replace it with...well nothing. \nStep 1:  Remove the HDD.\nThis is pretty easy.  Simply remove the screws on the bottom case of your MBP. There are 10.  Make note of the top 3 going from right to left as they are much longer than the rest.\n\nOnce inside, you will easily the see the fans and the hard drive.  Remove the bracket holding the hard drive in place and then disconnect the SATA cable connecting the drive to the logic board.\n\n\nStep 2:  Boot your machine\nReset your NVRAM (Comand+Option+P+R while turning on your computer).  Your fans should spin up to max for a few moments.\nYou can also boot into Diagnostic mode (Hold the D while booting).  It will test your fans and spin them up to max for a while.\nDon't worry about not having a HDD installed, nothing is going to happen.  In fact, you are going to boot it with the bottom facing up towards you.  What's on the screen doesn't matter for this.\nStep 3:  Listen for the noise.\nIf you hear it, you can flip over the unclosed MBP and listen to the fan closely.  If you hear noise, it is most likely it.  Put your finger on the fan to stop the blade.  If the noise goes away, there's your culprit.\nIf all is quiet, time to check the HDD\nStep 4:  Check the drive  (if required)\nReinstall the hard drive and its retaining bracket but don't close the bottom.  Reboot following just like you did in Step 2.  You can boot it with the bottom off and the lid open.  You are more concerned with the goings on inside rather than what is on the screen.  You won't be able to stop the drive from spinning, but you will be able to hear it much more clearly with it open.  If it is making noise, that is your culprit and you will want to change it right away.\nI just this week upgraded my MBP (late 2009) to an SSD and not only is it quieter, and cooler, it is blazing fast.  In my instance, the HDD made a really horrible noise then the MBP stopped working.  Here's the drive I used; it installed in about 10 minutes max.  I did a clean install of El Capitan then transferred my over only my data; I opted to reinstall my applications.\n", "Q: Setting anacron on Mac - Shell Scripting I set cron to run script every day using env EDITOR=nano crontab -e where I wrote something like this @daily path/to/sript.script.\nNow I want to use anacron to be sure that script is going to be run when I log in if I was logged off at the time when it was scheduled.

There used to be an app called LeftSider but I don't think this is compatible with Windows 10. \nI don't particularly care whether the buttons look like Mac buttons or not-- just want them in the same spot so I can rely on muscle memory and won't have to think where to click depending on the window.\nI run in Coherence mode on Parallels 11 in the latest El Capitan Mac OS, if that's relevant. \n\nA: I always found changing between Mac and Windows extremely annoying for that reason as well, and was totally excited to find out that you can close any Windows window that has an X, by simply double-clicking the far upper-left-hand corner.\nI cannot say about Win10 specifically, since I don't have that installed anywhere, but I know it worked from XP, all the way through Win8.\n", "Q: \"Where is FinderSyncAPIExtension?\" (Google Drive) For the last week or so I have been periodically getting this dialog popping up, shown below. It would seem from googling around that this is related to Google Drive.\nI have tried the recommendations on Apple Support Communities, specifically I have used the Browse button on the popup and selected FinderSyncAPIExtension by going to the finder and opening Google Drive > Show Package Contents > Contents and dragging FinderSyncAPIExtension.appex into the Browse window. That did not resolve the problem. I have also tried deleting Google Drive and installing it fresh from Google.\nCurrently, after I get this popup (and cancel it), GDrive stops syncing and I have to quit it and start it again to get it to start syncing again.\n\n\nA: This may be of use:\nhttps://forums.insynchq.com/t/mac-how-to-fix-issues-on-the-new-finder-sync-extension-file-icon-overlays-and-context-menu-in-os-x-10-10-above/3465\nBasically it says to go to System Preferences>Extensions and make sure that not more than one cloud file system is set on Finder. Only one can do it at a time: so that’s what causes FinderSyncAPIExtension to crash. \n\nA: I located the Google Drive app (/Applications) and clicked that. GDrive then continued to sync without errors. I'm not sure if this is the correct solution, I only tried it once (just 2 minutes ago) but so far so good.\n\nA: The google drive app seems to sync regardless of the pop up being satisfied. However, the pop up keeps popping up on my system such that I may have three or four of them splattered all over my computer screens, disabling my ability to see necessary program windows they insist on being atop of.

Found on the apple forum that it could be related to having Drive sync with multiple accounts. That's my situation, so could be indicative of where to look for solutions.\n\nGolfHotel\n  Feb 2, 2016 3:56 AM\n  This typically occurs when you have google drive installed and more than one google drive identity.

Today while staring yet again at the list of apps in the pop-up, I realized there were two Google Drive icons. One was listed under this path:\n~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default\n\nand one under:\n~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Profile 1\n\nThey were different versions. The Profile 1 turned out to be from when my daughter logged in to her account on my computer (using Chrome, she uses a Chromebook).\nWith the dialog still on the screen, I deleted Profile 1 and emptied the trash — the popup went away, as did the Google Drive menubar item. I opened Google Drive and got no popup. I logged out of the computer, then back in, and still no popup.\nSo, perhaps having logged into another account at some point in the past (using Chrome, on an account where the Drive app/plugin is active) installed a different version. That version never gets updated, because I haven't logged back into that account? So, maybe it is being found to be in conflict/out of date?\n\nA: I followed jackoverflow's advice and it turned out it was actually Adobe Creative Cloud that was trying to use an extension in Finder and was getting killed by DropBox.

Reading the developer docu about Code Signing, it says in section Digital Signatures and Signed Code:\n\nTo create a digital signature, the signing software computes a special\n  type of checksum called a hash (or digest) based on a piece of data or\n  code and encrypts that hash with the signer’s private key. This\n  encrypted hash is called a signature.\nTo verify that signature, the verifying software computes a hash of\n  the data or code. It then uses the signer’s public key to decrypt the\n  signature, thus obtaining the original hash as computed by the signer.\n  If the two hashes match, the data has not been modified since it was\n  signed by someone in possession of the signer’s private key.\nSigned code contains several digital signatures:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*If the code is universal, the object code for each slice\n  (architecture) is signed separately. This signature is stored within\n  the binary file itself.\n  \n*Various components of the application bundle\n  (such as the Info.plist file, if there is one) are also signed. These\n  signatures are stored in a file called _CodeSignature/CodeResources\n  within the bundle.\n  \n\nAfter some fiddling, I know the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Inside the binary, I got the CodeDirectory (0xfade0c02) containing all SHA-1 hashes or checksums of the Bundle, e.g. Info.plist etc.\n\n*Inside the bundle, I got the _CodeSignature directory with the CodeResources file, which - as the cited paragraph above mentions - should contain all signatures. However, the CodeResources only contains base64 encoded SHA-1 hashes of several files.\n\n*Inside the binary, I've got some certificates, which I can extract using codesign -d --extract-certificates <binary> - generating codesign0, codesign1 etc. These certificates actually are CMS Signatures (0xfade0b01) that do contain certificate signatures. Looking up CMS I get Cryptographic Message Syntax, which is used to sign data.\n\n\nNow the paragraph tells me that some hash has to be stored as a signature (encrypted hash) in the binary or in the CodeResources file.\nI suspect that codesign uses one of the certificates/CMS Signatures to extract the public key, then decrypts a signature (encrypted hash) and compares the output to the original hash of a given file, e.g. Info.plist.\nSo my question is: Where is this signature (encrypted hash)? Is it the signature inside a certificate/CMS Signature? Or is it somewhere else?\n\nA: Here is the basic test I made.\nI have OS X 10.10 installed on a external disk under volume name \"Steelhead3\". I entered the following commands.\ncd \"/Volumes/Steelhead3/Applications/Utilities\"\nsudo codesign -fs - \"Boot Camp Assistant.app\"\n\nI then made a copy of the folder \"Boot Camp Assistant.app\".

That is working. But, when I assigned a key to toggle the backlight, the backlight does not turn on. The key I have it assigned to is command+F14. I am on Yosemite.\n\nA: First, check under: System Preferences > Keyboard and see if your \"Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\" option is checked.\nIf the box is not checked, you will need to hold down Fn as well - this means that it your keyboard combination should be Fn+Cmd+F14.\nIf the box is checked (which means pressing F1/F2 doesn't affect brightness, F11/F12 doesn't affect volume etc) then you may want to check your configurations and go over the steps in the tutorial again.\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: Permanently remove icons from Dock I have Maps, Photos and iBooks icons returning to my dock after a reboot even though I removed them several times already. Is there some way to remove them? They seem to be set as defaults, can I change these defaults somehow?\n\nA: This answers it partially.\nWhen I encountered the same problem on El Capitan, these steps solved it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable System Integrity Protection.\n\n*sudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"delete:add-app\" /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/com.apple.dockfixup.plist\nsudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"delete:add-doc\" /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/com.apple.dockfixup.plist\n\n\n*Re-enable System Integrity Protection.\n\n\nI referred to another discussion for PlistBuddy\n\nA: The property list is most likely corrupted.

After attaching the ethernet cable to my Mac I need to enter username and password to access the Internet:\n \nThe problem is that I would like to perform a system recovery using cmd+R at startup. There I need Internet, but I don't get any dialog which suggests me to enter my credentials. \nIs it possible to enter the credentials using Terminal.app? Or does a better method exist to solve this?\nI have MacBook Pro 2012 with El Capitan installed.\n\nA: The short answer is \"Yes.\"  You can enter your credentials within Terminal.  You have to use the networksetup command\nThat's if you can get to terminal...  If you can, then the following will help get you connect.  But, if you can't, scroll down the bottom for an alternate...\nHowever, you have to have a create an 802.1x profile for which to connect to your network.  This is as straight forward as just entering in a username/password \nHere is the man page for the networksetup command on Apple's website: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/networksetup.8.html  You can view this in Terminal by typing man networksetup\nSince you mentioned plugging in your Ethernet, it's safe to assume you are using 802.1X Port Based Authentication.  Basically, there is a server, most likely a RADIUS server, but possibly another type of  AAA server (authentication, authorization, and accounting) that allows your computer onto the network.  \nBasically, before you are allowed to go anywhere, the network is checking to see if your device is authorized to connect, to where you can go, and (who/what) should be charged (if applicable).\nSo, how do you set this up?\nThis can get a little complex, so normally the IT department will supply you with a config file for you to import.  You would do so with the command networksetup -import8021xProfiles Ethernet <filename of profile to import>\nFrom what I have seen, you need OS X Server to create the profile, however, it is not hard to edit one once it has been created.  Here's a link to one created for the SMU network:  https://blog.iphoting.com/blog/archives/817-Lion-Wireless-Access-in-SMU.html\nDisclaimer:  Don't expect SMU's profile to work in your environment.  It is most likely configured completely different than what your environment is configured for.\nAlternate Method\nUse another computer and share the Internet Connection\nYou can use virtually any other computer (Apple, Windows, Linux) to connect to your institutions network whether it be wireless or wired.  Once you have that computer up and running, just share the Internet connection.\nSince this is an Apple thread, you can use this example as a basis for sharing Internet.  The connection is WiFi, but it is exactly the same for Ethernet.\nIf both your computers are connected to Ethernet, you will need a USB to Ethernet adapter and a crossover cable (or a switch).  The onboard Ethernet on the working computer will go to the institution network, the USB to Ethernet adapter will go to the computer you are trying to connect.\nOnce you have the working computer function, you turn on Internet sharing which effectively turns it into a router.  You can then connect to the Internet on the computer you are trying to boot into recovery mode.\n", "Q: No sound from mac, how to find the problem? Good day, I have Macbook Pro 2012 with el Capitan 10.11.3.\nThe problem - no sound from my mac.\nI have listen the music, after that I decide to insert headphones, when I'm taking out the headphones sound from Mac disappeared and there is red light from audio jack. Between that I have made an update from 10.11 to 10.11.3, maybe the problem is with that?\nThere was not any sound from my mac on startup, but when I have use disk utility repair the sound on startup appears.. \nHow can I diagnose myself where is the problem and fix it ?\n\n\nA: Your MacBook believes you've plugged in an optical audio cable when you haven't.\nTurns out, that headphone jack is actually a combo jack that has both optical audio and analog audio. There's a little lever in there that detects when you've put a cable in there that's probably stuck. Try fiddling with a toothpick or repeatedly plugging and unplugging.\n\nA: Try holding down option and clicking on the sound icon in the menu bar at the top of the screen. It'll give you a few options you can tweak.\nMy guess is that you're most likely AirPlaying your sound to muted speakers.\n\n", "Q: Am I supposed to have both a Library/Privileged Helper Tools & a Library/PrivilegedHelperTools folder? \nLibrary/Privileged Helper Tools is empty. Library/PrivilegedHelperTools has 3 items belonging to known installed applications within it. \n\nA: No, you should only have “PrivilegedHelperTools” without the spaces. Make sure the folder with spaces really is empty including hidden files, then it should be safe to delete.\n\nA: fseventer (compatible until OS X 10.9.x) shows you all files which get read/written at the moment and it also has filters. So by creating the filter [path ▼] [includes ▼] \"/Library/Privileged Helper Tools\" and running fseventer for some time, this may reveal which process considers this folder and its contents. But nevertheless with this method you won't find out if the suspicious folder is used during booting and shutdown.\n", "Q: iPhone 4s downgrade from 9.2.1 to 9.0.2 can I downgrade my iPhone 4s iOS 9.2.1 to 9.0.2? I try using ipsw but it isn't signed at this moment. Can I create custom ipsw 9.0.2?\nIts possible to downgrade my iPhone?\nThanks.\n\nA: You can only downgrade if you saved an SHSH blob from the old version while Apple was still signing it. If you don't have an SHSH blob for 9.0.2 then it's too late now, and there's no way you can downgrade.\n", "Q: Charging an iPhone 4S with a Samsung USB charger I have an iPhone 4S that I charge via a USB cable (plugged into my laptop). I also have a Samsung USB charger with the following specifications: 5.0 V and 1.0 A.\nIs it safe to plug my Apple USB cable into the Samsung charger and charge my iPhone like this? \nShould I be worried that it might blow up?\nIf I use a charger with more/less Amperes, does it matter?\n\nA: While I personally wouldn't attach a non A-branded charger to my iPhone, theoretically if the charger delivers 5V and does it on a USB connector, it really doesn't matter from where the power comes.\nThe more amps the faster your iPhone will charge.  I've been charging my iPhone with my iPad charger for years without any problems.\nCurrently Apple has 3 types of USB chargers\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone charger: 5 volts 1 amp = 5 watt\n\n*iPad 'old' type: 5 volts 2 amp = 10 watt\n\n*iPad 'new' type (from iPad 4 on): 5 volts 2.4 amp = 12 watt\n\n\nThe Samsung 1 amp charger you're talking about will give you the same results as the original iPhone charger.\n", "Q: When typing on Bluetooth keyboards, letter sometimes infinitely repeats while not holding it down For years, I've had no problem with using on a Microsoft Sculpt Mobile Keyboard as well as a Microsoft Bluetooth Mobile Keyboard 5000. I'm using a late 2011 MacBook Pro, OSX El Capitan v.10.11.3, (Bluetooth 4.0).\nproblem:\nStarting about 3 weeks ago, sometimes I'd press a letter key, I'd let go of the pressed key, but OSX seemed to sense I was still holding the key down. This problem happened with both those keyboards. This problem never occurred while using the attached keyboard.\nOnce the letter started uncontrollably repeating, I switched to the MacBook's attached keyboard. After about 1 second of frantically pressing esc while also using the trackpad to place the cursor behind the repeating text, the last character typed stopped repeating. I could continue typing on the Bluetooth keyboard as if nothing had happened. The problem would not occur again for days.\nideas:\n\n\n*\n\n*This problem has coincided with my El Capitan upgrade.\n\n*This problem definitely happens to me while doing Japanese character input. I'm not 100% sure that this has also happened to me while doing English input.\n\n*El Capitan has added new features with regard to Japanese character input.\n\n*Of course, the keymappings for the 2 MSFT Bluetooth keyboards are far apart from the unique / weird MacBook keyboard layout. They sure don't have fn, control, option, command, ... and the command key is used for Japanese input.\n\n\nSo far, it has happened when I am typing in MSFT Word, MSFT Excel, a Chrome browser, and the NetBeans IDE.  But not in any Apple apps.\nBut, it only happens infrequently. It is annoying, but not the end of the world. Maybe just buy an Apple keyboard.\n\nA: Regarding the shortcut for changing input sources, in El Capitan it is Control plus Space (unless your upgrade process carried over Command plus Space from an earlier OS version).  Normally the MSFT Windows key = Apple's Command key.  Alt = Option.\n\nA: a good solution is to use this app:\nhttps://github.com/Aahung/Unshaky\nHope this helps\n\nA: I've encountered this from time-to-time. This solution is crude, but effective. Sometimes the key isn't pushed fully into the keyboard, so the connection is faulty. Just try pushing down on the key very hard a few times, and the key will now be resting in the correct position.\n", "Q: How to tether a 2014 MacBook Pro 15\" Retina to two Dell Ultra HD 4k 27-Inch Screen LED-Lit Monitors (P2715Q)? I've attempted to connect my 2014 MacBook Pro 15\" Retina laptop to two, 27\" Dell Ultra HD 4k screens via OWC Thunderbolt 2 Dock, however, I was only able to tether one Dell screen instead of two; I've tried several combinations, which include the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook > Thunderbolt > [OWC](HDMI to Dell_1 + Thunderbolt to Dell_2)\n\n*MacBook > HDMI > [OWC](Thunderbolt to Dell_1 + Thunderbolt to Dell_2)\n\n*MacBook > Thunderbolt > [OWC](Thunderbolt to Dell_1)+(HDMI from Dell_1 to Dell_2)\n\n\nApparently, Hengedock would be a great solution for tethering two 27\" Apple Retina displays but I don't think the Hengedock is compatible with subject Dell monitors; I'm currently standing-by for my inquiry placed with customer-service.  I'd appreciate any insight or recommendations for OWC, Hengedock, or any other successful implementations-thank you!\n\nA: It doesn't appear that your MBP is capable of driving 2 4k displays with the Macbook's primary display working (see Graphics and Video support):\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/SP704?locale=en_US\nAlso the OWC Dock isn't capable of driving 2 4k displays so even if your MBP is capable of driving the displays you'll need to use the HDMI port or one of the other Thunderbolt 2 ports to drive the second display:\nhttp://www.owcdigital.com/products/thunderbolt/thunderbolt-2-dock-overview\nOne thing you may be able to try is to close the Macbook to turn off it's primary display, thus freeing up resources to try to handle both 4k displays.\n", "Q: Route USB mic input to System Audio output for Camtasia 2? I'm using Camtasia 2 for the Mac on El Capitan (10.11.3). I need to use two microphones so the audio will record to separate audio tracks. Camtasia 2 has one input audio source that does recognize the digital audio interface, a MOTU 828 MK3.(Only for one channel, but that's OK). This is normally used to record from a USB microphone.\nThe other audio source you can record from into Camtasia 2 is the System Audio. The System Audio is what plays the computer's alert sounds. I'd like to use the System Audio as a second audio input source from a plug-in USB microphone. It would be the only USB mic used in this configuration.\nSo it appears what I need to be able to do, is route the USB mic's output to be part be added or replacing the System Audio. This way, the USB mic can be recorded to the System Audio track, thus giving me a second microphone to be used.\nHow can this be accomplished? Is there some set-up using Audio Midi and Soundflower that can do this? Or is there some other sound utility which can do this?\nIt looks like I need something which will route the USB mic audio to be played out the System Audio so that Camtasia 2 will record it.\nThe goal is, so the net result is that MOTU 828 MK3's output gets recorded to the USB Mic audio, and the USB mic actually plugged into the USB on the Mac will be recorded into the System Audio.\n\nA: Rogue Amoeba's Loopback will allow you to route virtually any input/output to/from any Mac application. It is easier to use than Soundflower, and you can create multiple routings (which Soundflower does not) -- but it is a paid (and supported) app (unlike Soundflower). \n", "Q: Re-installing OS X with apartment Wi-Fi I need to re-install OS X Lion and I'm at a stage where when I turn my laptop on, it needs an internet connection to proceed.\nI have a good strong Wi-Fi signal, but I need to sign in. I usually do this by opening Safari, which prompts me with the sign-in page. I can't open Safari though because I'm in the re-install screen.\nAny ideas on how to get around this?\nAlso, what's the proper terminology used here?\n\nA: First I'd try to just connect to the Wi-Fi network and then run the recovery. But this will not work if you have a new and empty hard drive (i.e. no OS X  recovery partition on the hard drive) and need a full Internet Recovery from Apple's server.\nIf it doesn't work, I'd try and connect the Mac to another Mac or a Windows PC using a common Ethernet cable (network cable) and enable \"Internet Sharing\" on that system. On a Mac, Internet Sharing is simply enabled via System Preferences > Sharing. I don't know how this is done in Windows.\nIf that doesn't work either, I'd simply see that I connect the Mac to a different Wifi or ethernet-based network that doesn't require you to go through such a captive portal. Just remember not to enter any account credentials over public Wi-Fi (such as your Apple ID).\n\nA: As mentioned previously, you can connect via another Mac or PC using internet sharing.\nBefore you proceed, you need to answer this question: am I doing a full reinstall of the OS from the Internet, or do I have the ability to use a USB memory stick with Mac OS X on it to load the initial files?  USB sticks with Mac OS X on them can usually be obtained from the Apple store if you need one and that is sometimes the fastest way to get set up again.\n\n\n*\n\n*For install with USB stick with OS X on it.\n\n\nAfter using the USB stick to load the initial multi gigabyte install of Mac OS X, one of the easiest options, if you have a smartphone that has a good signal in your area, is to use your phone's Wi-Fi tethering option to set up a hotspot using your phone's cell network connection. Just use it for a very short period of time, just long enough to finish the initial set up with iCloud, etc.  Then once you can log in, turn off the hotspot and use the standard Wi-Fi to proceed.\n\n\n*\n\n*for install without the USB stick with OS X on it\nThis takes more time, and is trickier.\nYou can either: \n\n*use another computer to do this as mentioned before, with an Ethernet cable and internet sharing\n\n*use a smartphone with a very high data limit, or unlimited data, like T-Mobile, to perform the initial load\n\n*use a third computer to load the latest version of Mac OS X on a USB stick yourself See how to create a bootable USB installer\n\n*Take the computer to the Apple Store to have them perform the initial load.\n\n\nMy personal preference is to create a USB stick with Mac OS X on it and have that handy for when I need to do a reinstall. It's usually faster and saves needing to download things again.\n", "Q: iPhone wifi connection log file? I have an iPhone 5s with the latest version of iOS.  The wireless (and bluetooth) card has stopped working (tested at the Genius Bar) just a couple weeks out of warranty.  Apple wants $250+ to replace the phone.\nI wonder if I can determine when the phone last connected to a wifi network?  If I can determine that it has not connected to my home wifi prior to expiration of the warranty, Apple may have an obligation to replace the phone without charge.\nDoes a log file exist (and if so where can I find it) that would show the information I need?\n\nA: Logs are available via Xcode, however they are overwritten pretty quickly in order to prevent from consuming large amounts of memory on the device.  Usually you can only get a few days worth of logs at most.  That means that the logs you are seeking have certainly already been deleted from the device.  These are the same diagnostic logs that are available at the Genius bar.  They are useful for troubleshooting current issues, but they are not usefully for determining how long you have had a problem.  \n\nA: This thread contains information about Wifi logs on iOS 8, but it has not changed since the release of iOS 9. Basically, you could see a history if you could actually connect to the network in question--i.e., your home network--but this will not help your situation since you cannot actually connect to the network. So, in your case, there is no way to see the lsat time you connected to your Wifi network. \nPerhaps--and this is quite a stretch--you could make a Genius Bar appointment and have them run diagnostics. Tell them you are having Wifi issues, and tell them you don't know how long it's been going on. They may be able to show you the diagnostic logs. Then, armed with that information, if it has not connected since before the warranty ran out, you may have some luck with the same Genius.\n~Good luck, and I hope this helps.\n", "Q: WEP Security for Internet Sharing? I have a Nintendo DS to connect to the internet, but my router does not support WEP. I used to be able to create a WEP internet share on my MacBook 2010, but after the upgrade to 10.11.4, I cannot.\nIs there any solution?\n\nA: WEP was completely removed in Yosemite:\nhttp://tidbits.com/article/15158\nWEP is broken enough that you might just consider using an open Wifi connection (Security: None) but if you want to have a basic level of protection to stop someone from just walking into the equivalent of an open door the best solution would be to get a cheap secondary wifi router and set it up with it's own SSID with WEP, making sure to turn off DHCP on the router and connect it via a LAN rather than the WAN port (Apple Airports can just be put into Bridge Mode). If you're worried about security you could unplug the secondary router when you're not using it or disable it's Wifi.\n\nA: If you have the time and technical chops, one option may be to set up a virtual machine on your Mac that is running Linux. For cost reasons, you could use the free VirtualBox. Then set up the Linux distro to share with a WEP key.  Then you merely need to activate the virtual machine when you want to get your DS online.\nHere is a post describing the tool on Linux that you might use to set this up: Host APD: the Linux way to create a Wi-Fi access point\nThere's no guarantee that the virtual box network card is supported, but it might be worth a try.\n", "Q: Markup on excel on mac What is the formula on the OS X version of Excel 2016 to add a number in a column with a markup percentage in another column. \n\nA: Example:\nCell A1 contains a number,\ncell B1 contains a percentage number,\nso cell C1 calculates A1 plus B1 percent\nThe formula you type into cell C1 is =A1*(1+B1/100)\nSee also: help page for calculating percentages in Excel 2016 for Mac.\n", "Q: System logs backup with Time Machine It seems that Time Machine does not backup system.log in /private/var/log. \nMac OS X 10.9.5/Six core Intel Xeon\nCan I force that file to be backed up?\n\nA: By default the contents of the /private/var/log directory is excluded from Time Machine backups.  This can be changed to include the contents however because this is a system file it is probably more prudent to backup the excluded files you would like to have backed up by copying the files to a location that is included in Time Machine backups.  That said however, I disagree with cppl's statement \"Given that changing core files is always a bad idea\" because when done properly and with the knowledge and understanding of what one is doing it's just not an issue!\nIf you really want to include /private/var/log directory in your Time Machine backups then here is what you can do. To make this easier and more safe I'd recommend using this tested script.  It first backs up the bundle and plist and only removes /private/var/log if it in its default location within the .plist file. Note: This script must be run using sudo or as root.\nIn a Terminal:\ntouch modtm\nopen modtm\n\nIn the opened modtm document:\nCopy and paste the code shown below into the document and save it, then close it.\nBack in the the Terminal, make the script executable:\nchmod u+x modtm\n\nNow with the script ready to execute, in the Terminal:\nsudo ./modtm\n\nEnter your password, which will not show as you type it, and then press Enter.\nIf defaults were in play then /private/var/log should have been safely removed, by virtue of first backing up, from the StdExclusions.plist file.\nCode:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nset -ex\n\n    # Make sure script was run using 'sudo' or by 'root'.\n\nif [[ $(id -u) != 0 ]]; then\n   echo \"This script must be run as root.\" 1>&2\n   exit 1\n else\n        # Set variables.\n\n    b=\"/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle\"\n    f=\"/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist\"\n    e=\"/private/var/log\"\n\n        # Backup, by copy, both the bundle and plist.\n\n    [[ ! -d ${b%%.*}.ORI.${b##*.} ]] && cp -aR \"$b\" \"${b%%.*}.ORI.${b##*.}\"\n    [[ ! -f $f.ORI ]] && cp -a \"$f\" \"$f.ORI\"\n\n        # Get the value of the first element of the 'FileContentsExcluded' array.\n\n    v=\"$(/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Print :FileContentsExcluded:0\" \"$f\")\"\n\n    if [[ $v == $e ]]; then\n            # Target value matched, delete it from .plist file.\n        /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Delete :FileContentsExcluded:0\"  \"$f\"\n        echo \"$e removed from $f\"\n    else\n        echo \"$e not found where expected!\"\n        exit 1\n    fi\n    exit 0\nfi\n\nImage showing syntactical highlighting:\n\nNote: This script cannot be run in OS X 10.11 unless SIP is temporarily disabled.\n\nA: No, unfortunately while the standard Time Machine lets you exclude directories there isn't a way to include directories.\nEven the command line utility isn't any help tmutil - again all you can do is exclude directories.\nIf you really need the content of /private/var/log backed up then I would suggest using a simple script to copy the directory to a location to that is backed up.\nTo copy the files periodically you could use Automator or simple bash script with a single rsync call like:\nrsync -ar --delete /private/var/log/ /Users/yourusername/Documents/logbackups/\n\nPlease note some sub-directories may present problems due to default permissions… like this one:\ndrwx------   3 root    wheel    102 17 Sep 15:30 com.apple.revisiond\n\nFrom the comments by testing below, I tested the /private/var/log' directory withtmutil` and we get:\ntestac:~: tmutil isexcluded /private/var/log/\n[Included]    /private/var/log/\ntestac:~: tmutil removeexclusion /private/var/log/\nMDSetAttribute(): Removing extended attributes from '/private/var/log' failed errno: Permission denied\n\nSo, unless, you're going to modify the files suggested by @user3439894 via the tools and standard user interface there isn't a way to do it. Given that changing core files is always a bad idea — I would copy them to an already included location. (Apart from anything else system updates or Time Machine integrity may revert your changes).\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Mid2012 Lags I have a macbook pro mid 2012 and recently I upgraded it by changing the RAM to 16GB and HDD to 500GB SSD. It was fine for a while but now it lags a lot whenever I play any games or even when I am normally using it. I did Memory and Hard drive test and both of them were fine. I even replaced my RAM because I read it somewhere that I should replace my RAM when these things happen, but still the problem occurs.\nWhile upgrading my Hard drive I cloned my old hard drive and then transferred that to the SSD, I don't know if that's what causing the problem.\n\nA: *\n\n*If you run Yosemite or El Capitan, enable the native OS X trim support with the Terminal command : sudo trimforce enable, followed by a restart.\n\n*For older OS X versions try the TRIM enabler from Cindori Software.\n\n\nA: Try cloning the disk, try a clean install, using a external volume.\n\nA: You also can try re-instal the osx using the: cmd+r at the start, see this video: https://youtu.be/vxSbpZAIGm8 , Isn't mine, this can help you\n\nA: I have your same hardware (macbook and ssd) and the problem was the sata cable of notebook.\nFor me surprise, I dont pay nothing to fix it, even my notebook is out of guarantee, there is a recall from apple for this cable.\nGo you to Apple Authorized service and good lucky !\n", "Q: How do I find out which application is sending me this Notification Center alert? \nIt appears every 10 minutes or so, and it's driving me nuts!

Give me some solutions plz! Hello there my friends iPad is charging so slow! would you please help me?\nOk, first teh iPad charges with a third party 30 pin cable and usb power adapter. Teh iPad runs on ios 8 and teh battery is never changed.\n\nA: The problem is mostly the charger. Buy the official Apple one (the $20 one) and the iPad should charge much faster. Also, updating to iOS 9 couldn't hurt, either.\n", "Q: My friends iPhone 4s charges slow My friends iPhone is charging so slow!\nThe iPhone charges slow even when it's off. It uses a third party cable and accessories and the 30 pin connector keeps popping out.\nok. my friend was placing the iPhone and connecting it to the power outlet, the iPhone started charging, but frequently stops charging. I checked the 30 pin connector and it was popping out. Any clues to give meh plz\niPhone 4s, iOS 8.3, my friends iPhone\n\nA: Most likely it's the third-party charger.

I'm really advanced on this game and DO NOT WHANT TO DELETE AND REINSTALL and potentially loose my progress.\nSo I'd like help thank you \n\nA: This has already been answered and unfortunately you'll have to delete and reinstall, but you can backup the settings first and most likely maintain your game state:\nHow can I make in-app purchases with a different Apple ID than the app was purchased with?\n", "Q: Where is the AirPlay menu bar app? Apple hardware requirements state that AirPlay is not supported on my 2010 Macbook pro.\nHowever, I can use AirPlay to stream music/movies from iTunes to my Apple TV (4th gen), as well as YouTube videos on Safari.\nSo why can't I get a menu bar app? AirPlay clearly is supported.\n\nA: AirPlay is supported, extending or mirroring your Mac's desktop over AirPlay is not supported. As far as I know, the only way to stream from the menu bar is to stream system audio by Option-clicking the sound/volume icon. i think video streaming is still per-app if you can't do AirPlay desktop mirroring/extending. \n", "Q: This pop up shows when I use a third party cable \nThis appears when I use a cable that is mfi certified to charge my iPad. Why?\n\nA: You're using a poor quality cable (or, very unlikely, the port is obstructed. There are many cables that say they are MFi certified that are not: you can check if it is here. You should stop using this cable immediately as it could cause real damage to your iPad. While I don't know if this will apply to your cable, Apple has a take back program for third party adapters and may give you some credit towards buying a proper adapter. (correction: the cheaper price has been discontinued.)\n", "Q: Can the Apple Watch be Worn While Bathing? Can you wear the Apple Watch during bath time? What is it's resistant to both water and soap?\n\nA: The Apple Watch is splash and water resistant, not waterproof. Although it would likely survive a quick dip, long submersion isn't recommended and could kill your watch. If you want to wear it in the tub while playing with your favorite toys, you can (even though Apple says not to), but keep it above water. You're to probably better off keeping it away from water though, especially if your watch and corresponding band gets sudsy.\n\nA: I use it in the shower because it is waterproof for 30 minutes at a maximum depth of 1 metre and soap won't affect it just don't use REALLY hot water or you might overheat the watch and plastics/rubber\n", "Q: Google maps is not working on my IPhone 5S the last 2 days when on LTE For the last 2 days when on LTE, my Google Maps will load the data, but once it comes up, it's immediately deleted.  It's only Google Maps I have trouble with, as my Gmail comes up without problem\n\nA: I have not met with this problem before, but i suggest that you can uninstall Google maps and download it again\n", "Q: Time Machine says not enough space but there is plenty of space I'm not sure what happened but I used to be able to backup to a drive shared with a networked Mac Mini using OSX server. Now all of a sudden it says there is not enough space.\nSo I reformatted the drive (12TB) and restarted the whole thing. However Time Machine now tell me there is not enough space. It says:\n\nThe backup disk needs 5.35 TB for the backup but only 499.49 GB are available.\n\nI'm not sure why only 499GB is available.\n\nA: I've run into this before when using networked backup, also said something like 497GiB were free when actually 4TiB were free. Seems this is caused by TM not creating a large enough sparsebundle for the initial backup. I found a workaround that at least worked for me (El Capitan) and submitted a bug report to Apple.\nWorkaround: You should notice that the sparsebundle on the OS X server has only ~499GiB as its capacity. Manually enlarge it by running this command on the server: sudo hdiutil resize -size [number of gigabytes]g [path to sparsebundle], e.g. sudo hdiutil resize -size 10000g /Volumes/Backups/mybackup.sparsebundle. Make it as large as you need. Retry your backup.\nEdit: You may also have to resize the sparsebundle's partition in Disk Utility. I didn't have to do this, but maybe that's because my backup wasn't encrypted. For instructions, see the first (not accepted) answer here: Increase size of sparsebundle for TimeMachine\n\nA: It sounds like you may not have the correct drive selected for the Time Machine backup. Can you try temporarily turning off Time Machine in the System Preferences and then choose Select Backup Disk on the right and choose the 12TB disk. This will verify you're attempting to use the correct disk.\nAlternately you may need to check that the new disk is formatted correctly using the steps at the beginning of this doc:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202380\n\nA: I had the same problem, so maybe my experience will be helpful.\nI have a 24TB ThunderBay RAID hooked up to my iMac and although there was enough space on my separate Time Machine HD (via USB), it gave me a warning that I needed over 2.5TB of extra space for a Time Machine backup of 120GB.\nAfter reformatting the TM-HD, I finally unmounted the ThunderBay RAID, then switched it off and removed the Thunderbolt connection from the iMac. Only then did the TM backup to the Time Machine HD immediately work without a hitch.\nMaybe something in the TM prefs got severely confused by having the RAID hooked up, but for me this solved the problem.\n", "Q: My Photos.app starts on system startup Apple's new Photos.app starts on every system startup although there is no configuration settings for system startup.\nHere is my checklist:\n\n\n*\n\n*Users & Groups > Login Items (There is no config for Photos)\n\n*Right click photos in Dock > Options > Launch on system startup (There is no config for Photos)\n\n\nHere is my another what I did\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabling and re-enabling iCloud Photos\n\n*Repairing Photos library from this tutorial\n\n*If Dropbox affect Photos for starting at system launch, I disable Dropbox's photos settings.\n\n\nHow can I prevent Photos.app on system startup without deleting it? \n\nA: You probably have a SD card or a device which stores photos plugged in your Mac.\nTo prevent Photos from auto-opening, follow these instructions:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Connect the iPhone, camera, SD card, etc to the Mac and let Photos app launch itself as usual\n  \n*Under the “Import” tab of Photos app, look in the upper left corner to find the device name, this will indicate which hardware will no\n  longer automatically activate Photos app\n  \n*Click the checkbox so that “Open Photos for this device” is no longer selected (likewise, toggling this on would enable Photos app to\n  open itself again automatically when this device is connected)\n  \n*Quit out of Photos app, the change is immediate for that device – this can be switched back at any time in the same OS X Photos app\n  \n  \n  \n\nVia: http://osxdaily.com/2015/05/31/stop-photos-opening-automatically-mac-os-x/\n\nA: First, check whether you have any external devices connected to your mac. If there are no external devices, keep the Photos app in Dock and Right-click -> Options -> Open at login(Uncheck if it's checked).\n", "Q: Is Airport Express reasonably better at receiving Wi-Fi signals than a laptop? I keep my router (an Apple Time Capsule 2011) in my living room, but I frequently use my MacBook Pro Retina 15\" Mid-2014 in my kitchen, which is separated from the living room by a wall.\nIn the kitchen, I get roughly 50 % of the download speed that I get in the living room near the router.\nI'm thinking of getting an Airport Express to extend my network via Wi-Fi extension. If I were to place it in the kitchen, would it suffer as much receiving penalty as my laptop, or is its capability much stronger, thus warranting the placement to some degree?\nAlternatively, I could place the Airport Express in the hallway connecting the living room with the kitchen, effectively \"mid-way\" between the two rooms.\n\nA: You could assume the Airport Express uses practically the same chipset as pre-AC equipped Macbooks.  Knowing this, any Airport Express would perform less fast than your 2014 laptop which does have AC.\nBut... Your 2011 Time Capsule also doesn't have AC technology, so this wouldn't be an issue.\nPlacing the Airport Express in the kitchen will theoretically improve signal because the Airport Express doesn't have (doesn't need) battery power saving routines as the Macbooks have (need).  Therefore chances are higher it can establish a better connection to your Time Capsule.\nThe bad thing is that you cannot improve speed with this; degraded signal in the chain is irreversible, no matter what (weakest link remember).\nThe good thing is that your Macbook wifi radio won't need to suck as much power as it will connect to a much closer antenna.\nBut... if you can place it in the middle the signal will have less chances to degrade and you benefit in speed AND battery.\nSo, yes, your footer assumption is the way to go; place it in the hallway.\nIf speeds are really really important to you and you have a little more money to burn, upgrade your network with a new Time Capsule or a new Airport Extreme.  These baby's do run on AC technology which is day and night different in speed.  Or invest in a non-Apple AC capable router.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro black screen during logon When I boot my Macbook Pro and log in, the progress bars starts scrolling. After a few seconds the screen goes completely black and then shows the progress bar again but all the rest around the progress bar is black. \nI tried to reset the SMC settings but no luck. Anyone else experiencing this issue or knows how to fix it? I noticed this issue right after the upgrade to El Capitan, I don't know if it's related to that.\nSpecs (in case it helps troubleshooting):\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\n\n*2.5GHz Quad-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.7GHz 16GB 1600MHz   DDR3L SDRAM \n\n*512GB PCIe-based Flash Storage \n\n*Intel Iris Pro Graphics +\nAMD Radeon R9 M370X with 2GB GDDR5 memory\n\n\nA: I had exactly the same thing happen. Upgrading to El Capitan resulted in my having to erase the entire hard drive and restore using my back up! Thankfully I always back up but so far I'm not happy with ElCapitan. This upgrade has brought so many problems which are ongoing. Apple are very helpful and can offer you a number of 'fixes' so I'd recommend contacting them. Sadly for me as I mentioned erasing he hard drive was my only solution. Good luck \n\nA: My issue solved itself after a recent update to El Capitan 10.11.4 (15E65). I hope the issue stays away from future versions.\n", "Q: Dingit.tv process running in Safari, using 1GB memory and 15% cpu There's a process running in Safari (9.0.3) which is killing performance on my MBA. It's called dingit.tv and it's using between 1-2 GB RAM. As far as I know I've never been to this site. If I kill the process it just reappears immediately.\nIt seems like a virus to me. Anyone else seen this or know how to get rid of it?\n\nA: You can try running Dingit's uninstaller here:\nhttp://kb.dingit.tv/article/114-how-do-i-uninstall-the-dingit-infinitehd-plugin\nOn OSX 10.10.5 when I browsed to the site the following appeared in the Activity Monitor:\nhttp://www.dingit.tv \n\nand it's actually just a window that's open in Safari and Safari will keep reopening it each time you kill it. The easy way to bring it onto the screen is to use the Merge All Windows option in Safari's Window menu and then close it.\n", "Q: Keep Maps/Waze on screen when answering call I have my iPhone paired with my car's Bluetooth. I typically have my iPhone displaying Waze or Apple Maps in navigation mode. When I answer a call, the Phone app takes over the entire screen and I no longer see the map.\nIs there anyway to keep the navigation on screen while I'm answering a phone call?\n\nA: It's not possible to make the call screen not come up. You'll have to double-click the Home button and go back to Waze. Or, if you have an iPhone 6s/Plus, 3D touching the left side of the screen and dragging right will send you back to the previous app. \n\nA: Only if you jailbreak your iphone and install a tweak that would allow you to do so. \n\nA: After you accept the call, just double-click the home button and get back into the navigation app. You will be able to see the map and your call won't be interrupted.\n\nA: No, you can't keep it on the screen.  But you don't have to \"fiddle with the phone\" to bring Waze back.  Double-clicking the home button and touching the middle of the screen brings it back. \nSince you can do that without looking at the phone, it is no more distracting than operating your turn signals, windshield wiper, headlights, or cruise control. If you find that distracting, then, in the interest of public safety, I would urge you to take mass transit.\n\nA: You can vote for the feature here:\nhttps://waze.uservoice.com/forums/59223-waze-suggestion-box/suggestions/39069448-keep-waze-on-top\nHopefully, they'll work it out sooner or later if this gets enough votes.\n", "Q: To convert .iso file to .img file while trying to dual boot with linux \nIt says no such file or directory.where did I go wrong? \n\nA: Your path, by the looks of it, ought to be\n~/Downloads/ or ~/Desktop/ rather than\n~/Users/Yourname/…\n~/ is already the shortcut to /Users/Yourname/\nYou can also use the file command to check that the file you are converting already exists. Copy the path and paste it after file at the shell. You can also shorten the directories, by changing to the folder\ncd ~/Downloads\nmv file ~/Desktop\ncd ~/Desktop\nls ubuntu*iso\nhdiutil convert -o ubuntu.img -format UDRW ubuntu*iso\n\nThe ls command makes sure there is only one file starting with ubuntu and ending in iso on your desktop - you can put the whole file path instead of using the * that I used for brevity if you have more ISO files that match on the desktop.\n", "Q: Using Magic Keyboard with 3rd party Displays I have a Mac mini. I am using a Lenovo ThinkVision Pro2840m, connected via DP, as my monitor. I am using the Magic Keyboard. Can anyone please tell me the procedure to make the display brightness controls work with this monitor right from my keyboard? The screen brightness shortcuts, and the volume buttons are not working. I'm running OS X El Capitan.\n\nA: Third-party monitor brightness can't be changed by using the Magic Keyboard keys. You'll have to use the settings on the monitor. \n\nA: It's likely you can't, but just to double check, can you confirm you have the option of adjusting display brightness in the Display pane of System Preferences?\nMost 3rd party monitors don't support external brightness adjustment via DP or HDMI. The same is likely the case with the sound if the speakers are integrated into the monitor.\n\nA: It’s not possible without third party software. That being said, you can lock in your Macs brightness to the max brightness of your monitor, then use function flip to reassign your macs inbuilt brightness to fn+f1 and fn+f2. Then you can install QuickShade software dimming to use f1 and f2, and it’s like the built-in dimmer except both screens dim!\n\nA: Lunar supports adjusting brightness, contrast, volume and input for most modern monitors.\nThe app enables your brightness and volume keys to be used natively with external monitors, while also adding keyboard shortcuts for other useful functions like changing screen rotation.\nIf on the first try Lunar can't change the brightness of your monitor, try looking through this FAQ which lists most possible blockers of DDC and how to fix them if possible.\nThe most usual blockers are:\n\n*\n\n*The HDMI port of the Mac Mini (switch to a different port to allow DDC to work)\n\n*Some monitor setting that blocks external brightness adjustments\n\n*\n\n*Dell has Uniformity Compensation which needs to be disabled\n\n*LG has Picture Mode which needs to be set to Custom to allow DDC\n\n*Prism has On-the-Fly Mode which needs to be set to Standard\n\n*Samsung has Magic Bright and Input Signal Plus\n\n*Most monitors have some kind of Color Preset that needs to be set to Standard or Custom\nWhen DDC just doesn't work\nIf brightness doesn't change even after trying all of the above, Lunar still has a fallback where it can change the brightness by manipulating the Gamma settings in software. The monitor LED panel brightness stays the same, but the colours get darker as you lower the brightness in Lunar which mimics a brightness change.\nI've written about how that works here if anyone's curious about it: The journey to controlling external monitors on M1 Macs\nLunar should fallback to Gamma automatically if DDC is detected unresponsive, but you can also force that fallback by disabling Hardware Controls in the Lunar monitor settings\n\nDisclaimer: I'm the developer of Lunar\n", "Q: Simplest way to transfer photos from PC to iPad (not sync-all)? I'd like to transfer selected photos from my PC to an iPad Air 2 running iOS 9.2. This thread shows how to transfer from iPad to PC (Use Windows Explorer and treat iPad as a camera), and this thread suggests using Dropbox.\nCan I use Windows Explorer and have the photos show up in the camera roll on my iPad? If not, what's the easiest way of doing so without syncing?\nNote: I can see and copy JPGs from the iPad to my PC with Windows Explorer. I am not able to copy from my PC to the iPad.\n\nA: The easiest way to get photos from a PC to an iOS device would be backing up certain photos to a cloud service like Google Photos or Dropbox. There is no way to get photos from PC into the iOS Camera Roll that I am aware of. Check out Google Photos. It would be the most seamless solution. \n\nA: I haven't used it in a while, but iExplorer should do what you what.\n\nA: If I remember well you can use iCloud for Windows to transter photos from and to your iPad within the PC File Explorer.\nOnce installed there is a new iCloud Photos folder in your explorer that contains 3 sub-folders:\n\n\n*\n\n*one for upload\n\n*one for download\n\n*last one for your shared photos (this is an iCloud feature)\n\n\nHope it still exists and that it will work.\n", "Q: F11 not presenting code of Macaulay 2 to the Emacs buffer in OSX I am setting up Emac Version 24.4 (9.0) for Macaulay 2.

I have the iPhone 6s and I do not like the default Facebook Messenger and GroupMe vibrate pattern, whereas I like the default one provided by Apple. Is there a way to change the vibration for non-native iOS apps on the new iPhones / iOS 9?\n\nA: Apps specify their own vibration patterns, and unless they offer a way to customize it in-app, that's what you are stuck with. Sadly, most apps do not.\nThe same goes for notification sounds, with most apps only offering an on/off switch while the app is open (iOS controls the on/off switch for global notification sounds while the app is closed).\n", "Q: Using a MacBook air as a monitor Can I use the MacBook Air as a monitor when making a video with my Iphone. I wish to use my camera app on my Iphone 5s to record  how to videos and need to be able to see on a monitor at the same time.

Is there a way for me to export these settings ?\n\nA: I was setting up a new machine and found that klanomath's 2016 answer no longer worked for transferring preferences. Here's what worked for me.\nAs background, the latest versions of BBEdit follow the new macOS guidelines for storing preference information. If you had been updating both your OS and BBEdit on an existing setup, then the preferences continued to be stored in their original locations as described in klanomath's original answer. Now, however, macOS uses the ~/Library/Containers folder to create a sort of mirror of the main Library structure for individual programs. So if you're trying to transfer preferences, saved clippings, etc., you'll need to look in\n~/Library/Containers/BBEdit/Data/Library/\nWithin that folder, you'll find version of the Preferences, BBEdit, and Application Support/BBEdit folders. So if you're transferring from an older BBEdit setup, copy your source\n~/Library/Preferences/com.barebones.bbedit.plist\nto\n~/Library/Containers/BBEdit/Data/Library/Preferences/com.barebones.bbedit.plist,\non the new machine. Then\n~/Library/BBEdit\nto\n~/Library/Containers/BBEdit/Data/Library/BBEdit,\nand last\n~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit\nto\n~/Library/Containers/BBEdit/Data/Library/Application Support/BBEdit\nIf your source preferences are already in ~/Library/Containers/BBEdit/Data/Library/, then just do a straight copy from old to new for the folders and files listed.\nYou might also want/need to follow steveb's advice about renaming the Sleep State file.

Nothing else worked for me.\n", "Q: Installing XP on latest MacBook OS X My MacBook (purchased in 2007) with Windows XP installed through VMware software. I have some important software that works only in XP. My MacBook broke down and I purchased latest MacBook Pro (2015).\nI am not able to install Windows XP because the Mac does not allow installation through USB or CD drive. Also OS X help seems to suggest that it won't support XP in Boot camp. Can anyone help me out?\n\nA: If I understand correctly, you just need to install VMware Fusion first, which will allow you to install and run Windows XP as a virtual machine, so that you can install and work with that important software of yours.\n\nIf you still have a backup copy of your old XP virtual machine (it's a large single file, if I remember correctly), you should be able to run that. Again,  after you have installed VMware Fusion.\n\nInstalling Windows using BootCamp is a very different thing (dual booting) and is indeed not supported for XP anymore.\n\nA: You can also use Veertu from Mac Appstore to install Windows XP on your Mac. The app is free for open-source OS usage within their curated catalog and a paid upgrade to run arbitrary OS or Windows from ISO/DVD/CD installers.\n", "Q: Manually update tz (time zone) database in Mac OS X? Is there a way to manually update the time zone definitions (“tz” database formerly known as the “Olson database“)?\nFor example, the Java platform provides the TZUpdater tool to install, and even build, a fresh copy of the tz data. \nIs there some such tool or workaround for Mac OS X?\nI know Apple tends to include updates to the tz database as a part of the regular system updates. But sometimes last minute changes are made to take effect sooner than Apple may release a system update. Also, for older versions of Mac OS X no longer updated by Apple may need fresh time zone data.\n\nA: The FreeBSD location is \n/usr/share/zoneinfo\n\nand the files are there on MacOSX 10.10.5. I'm not sure if updates to those files will be respected by OSX but it's a good place to start.\n", "Q: Switch spaces with apple script My goal is to switch spaces from within an apple script.

I have a MacBook Pro early 2011 and my hard drive is failing, I was wondering once I replace the hard drive, is reinstalling the OS X as easy as turning it on and booting into Internet Recovery, formatting the drive, and just reinstalling OS X? \n\nA: I just did this yesterday (I have a slightly older MBP) and wasn't able to boot into Internet Recovery mode without mounting the old drive using a USB sled.\nAccording to Apple your Mac should support Internet Recovery with a firmware update:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202313\nIf for some reason you can't access Internet Recovery the alternative is you can mount the new drive externally and use Internet Recovery to install OSX on the new drive before swapping them but the install process will be a bit slower since the drive is external.\nHopefully you're planning on installing an SSD, I installed one and it made a huge improvement on the speed of my Late 2009 MBP.\n", "Q: Ssh app on iPad runs bash script ServerAuditor is a free iPad app that allows ssh to a server.

When I am assessing the readability of scanned documents, I would like a transparent grid overlaid on top of my screen that shows perfectly parallel lines, as opposed to crudely \"eyeballing\" it. The lines of the grid should float on top of all other applications, and the holes of the grid should be transparent.\nI do not need anything fancy, something like this (except rectangular, to fit my rMBP screen):\n\nI have found a program entitled \"GoldenMeanGrid,\" which is close to what I want, but its grid only contains two lines.

Further, how can this be fixed if the application has been removed from the App Store?\n\nA: Download the Mac OS X Snow Leopard Update.\nApple released an \"App Store\" Update for Mac OS X Snow Leopard users on January 27th, 2016. This update appears to handle new certificate changes that will render out-dated apps \"damaged.\" Downloading and installing this update should solve the problem.\nThis is the link to manually update the software from Apple's website.\n\nA: The Snow Leopard update should fix the problem. The issue involves expired security certificates in the App Store. This was a big issue a couple months ago. Ordinarily, people could just delete and re-download the app...In your case, since this is not possible, install the latest fix for Snow Leopard and that should fix your issue. \n", "Q: How to edit icon for Korean input source? I use the English and Korean input sources on my Macbook.\nFor some reason or other, the English one has a U.S. flag as its icon, but the Korean one has a completely different icon — the letter \"⬜\" instead of the Korean flag. This really bugs me.\nI've tried using the program Ukelele to make my own input source with the Korean flag as its icon, but apparently Ukelele doesn't support the Korean input method.\nSo is there a way to edit a preexisting input source? I'm looking to change the icon of the default Korean input source on the OS X.\nEDIT: Apparently StackExchange thinks all Koreans must be spammers.

I have family with iOS devices (iPhone, iPad) but I personally use Android.\nI do however have a Mac Mini for development - is there any app or web site from where I can approve App purchases (Ask to buy)? The idea is that I won't need to confiscate an iOS device and log into App Store using my \"organiser\" account just to approve.\n\nA: Yes. This is possible. The instructions for all the necessary steps can be found here, provided you have OS X 10.10 Yosemite or higher. When someone in your family requests to make a purchase, you will get a notification on your Mac. (You can find past notifications in the Notification Center).

I am a Malaysian App Developer, and my team and I are currently in midst of developing an iOS app, and have come across a few questions which I hope stackexchange will be able to answer.\n1) We have found that most POS Apps listed within the following article, Best iPad Restaurant POS Systems of 2016 | Top Ten Reviews, do not utilize the IAP for their monetary transactions. We have examined each App individually, and have found that their transaction methods range from Customized Payment Systems, Membership-Based Payment Systems, to Portal-Based Payment Systems. Considering Apple Inc's stance on Transactions, App Store Review Guidelines, Clause 11: Purchasing & Currencies, is their method of Monetary Transactions considered to be transgressing Apple Inc's standing policies and/or is illegal ?\nPlease kindly advise on the queries that I have raised and explain in detail, if their actions are completely illegal or the result of abusing a loophole within Apple Inc's policies.\n\nA: POS applications do not use IAPs for payments because:\n\n\n*\n\n*IAPs are made for purchases of parts of applications, not goods outside the App Store. For example Amazon app or Bookings do not use IAPs\n\n*Apple takes a 30% cut on each IAP. This is not bearable in a low margin business such as restoration. \n\n", "Q: OS X 10.11.3 Update, keyboard lagging I don't know how to explain this, but since I've updated my OS X to 10.11.3, keyboard seems to lag. It's extremely subtle, but I am a programmer and an author, and I can feel the difference while coding or typing, and even it's something in the milliseconds-range, it's noticeable and disturbing. I've tried restarting etc, not using many programs at once, but no avail. It's noticeable everywhere, even as I'm typing this question here. I haven't installed anything extra.\nI'm in a mid-2014 MacBook Pro with the built-in keyboard. The problem is keyboard language-independent. The problem occurs system-wise, from TextEdit to Safari to Xcode, even inside Windows apps using Parallels.\nIs anyone having the same issue?\n\nA: I would try to disable some keyboard-related applications, if you have any. Such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Karabiner\n\n*Text Expander (I had one as extension for Google Chrome =)\n\n*Punto Swither\n\n*etc.\n\n\nI have just got rid of the keyboard lags on my system by uninstalling all of these (it could be only one of them that caused the issue, but I've shot all three).\n", "Q: Contents of folder have disappeared Twice in the last week the entire contents of a folder have disappeared when I start up my computer. The folder contains over 100 GB of files, including all my work files. It's the first folder in the root directory of my hard disc. I'm running 10.9.5 on a 27\" iMac. I have been able to restore all the files using Time Machine, but it's time-consuming so it would be much better to solve the fault that's causing this in the first place\n\nA: This was a bug in a recent Adobe Creative Cloud update (version 3.5.0.206), causing the first folder, alphabetically, to be deleted from the user's boot drive.\nIt was first noticed by Backblaze, as their backup structure creates a folder that is often at the top of the list, .bzvol\nAs your folder was called Workwith a space at the head, that will have filed it to the top instead of any 'dot' folder.\nBackblaze recommends creating a new folder called .adobedontdeletemybzvol by typing the following in Terminal sudo mkdir /.adobedontdeletemybzvol, however, this wouldn't work in your case, as space will file above a . \nThe bug has been fixed & a new update released by Adobe, but in the meantime, creating a new folder starting 'space a' would be safe… maybe adobedontdeletemywork would be appropriate ;-)\nRefs:\nArsTechnica - Warning: Bug in Adobe Creative Cloud deletes Mac user data without warning\nBackblaze helpdesk - .bzvol is missing\n", "Q: Should one wait for new Mac Pro? I want to buy Mac Pro. I've found used 1 year Mac Pro with Xeon 3.5 6-core with 2xD500 which is cheaper around 1700 euro then new one. However knowing there's new Mac Pro coming (hopefully) this year I wonder if I should wait. The question is about potential new Xeon and new GPU and how much better in terms of performance it is comparing to old Xeon. Lately all the changes in CPU/GPU are to make them less power hungry rather than having more power so the changes aren't that big. What sort of power difference can one expect comparing new Xeon to the old one? \n\nA: TLDR; If you care about your money, buy that 2nd hand MP.  If you care about expandability, look for a 2nd hand heavy CPU'ed cMP (classic Mac Pro).\n--\nThat used Mac Pro doesn't sound bad at all!  Sure, one day in the future there will be new models available, and they will be faster and better.\nHowever one must not buy a Mac Pro - or any computer for that matter - for the future.\nAssuming your computer is not for academic research or playing games, professional machines like these should start making you money from the day you connect them to the power grid.  When the new model comes out you should have made so much profit with it that replacing it would be a no brainer.\nIf you don't plan to do that - and are afraid it will be quicker obsolete than the upcoming version - perhaps the Mac Pro isn't the machine for you.\nChances are low the 'new' Mac Pro will follow the latest traditions of the 'lesser' Mac range, being getting smaller, less power demanding and just a slight faster or less fast than its predecessor.  The new Mac Pro will be significantly better leaner and meaner than the Late 2013 model.\nExpect the new MP to have a E5 V4 Broadwell-EP - or even a Skylake E3 V5, Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and an updated AMD FirePro or even the Fury.  These are very cool features indeed but IMHO the steep price and limiting form factor make it not worth it.  Give me 2 grand and I'll search myself a 2nd hand 12-core, matte silver boxed classic Mac Pro.\ndisclaimer: personal opinion of course.  We swapped our 6 core cMP with a 6 core newMP about a year ago.  If I knew better then I would have tried to stop that.  That's for technical and usability reasons, not for the (companies) money.\n", "Q: Third party youtube app as default on iOS 5.1.1 (iPad1,1, jailbroken) Is there any way to set up third party youtube app as default on iOS 5.1.1 (iPad1,1) i.e. ProTube?\nI've heard about TubeSelector, but it's only available for higher iOS versions. \n(By \"Default\" I mean ability to open youtube URLs from mail or from sites.)\nN.B. The reason is: native YouTube.app by Apple is not supported by youtube servers anymore. And it recommends to upgrade (what is impossible - as far as iOS 5.1.1 is the latest OS for iPad1).\n\nA: Just install any good third party youtube app from the app store, like Jasmine or Youtube Pro etc... Or since your iPad is jailbroken install a tweak called: older version of the app (if you can't find it on cidya try google), and find a version of official youtube app by google that supports ios 5.x.x\n\nA: Blocking \"Youtube\" from Parental Controls might be a workaround to open youtube-URLs in Safari.

USB C charging, video formats, the connector type are all non-proprietary. Only time will tell if businesses invest in making these products, but Apple's two adapters work very well for the use case you describe.\nAlso keep an eye out for cables and monitors that send the required USB charging current over USB-C most higher quality displays should soon be able to charge your computer like Apple's previous generation displays now that the proprietary charge connection is gone from the MacBook (and others).\n", "Q: Connection to Shared Diskstations I have two Synology Diskstations.

I know there is a folder (/Library/StartupItems) that let you place script for running on every startup, but is there something like that for first time logon?\n\nA: I don't know of a specific place on OS X, but a pretty common way to handle this is just to have the script run every time the user logs in, and check for the presence of a specific hidden file in the user's home directory. If the hidden file is there, do nothing and exit. If it's not there, run the first-time login procedure, and create the hidden file.\nNote also the \"/System/Library/User Template/[locale]\" directory, which is the skeleton home directory used to create all new users' home directories.

Using this method I like to 'tie' certain sets of applications together so I can see each 'set' on a different Space.\nEach time you swap methods, all your carefully-prepared Spaces will mess up, as the numbering will change, so be prepared to have to reset which apps are set to open on which Space, if you wish to try it out.\n", "Q: Сheck for duplicate photos on Apple devices Here's the thing, I have iPhone, iPad and Mac.

I have a Mid 2010 Mac Pro that was once my main computer; however, when the graphics card failed and I couldn't find a replacement that the Mac would take I had to replace the computer.  I still have the Mac and am considering re-purposing it as a file server.  If I install new HDDs (I salvaged the old HDDs for the replacement computer), would the Mac run even without a video card?  Thanks!\nCLARIFICATION: Since I would be using new HDDs, OS X would not yet be installed on those HDDs.\n\nA: I have 2 mid 2010 MacPros and have been able to run both without a GPU. If you can load OSX with screensharing turned on onto a drive using another Mac in Target Disk mode you should be able to plug that drive in and boot it up.\nI have this running as a media and file server and it works great. Also cuts back on the heat as I loaded my pro up with 6 HDDs (4 in the trays and 2 using the OWC 3.5 adaptor in the CD Drive space). Set up an SSD via a PCIe adaptor for OSx. It works perfectly.\n\nA: This will work.  I have a 2010 MacPro running Mojave (I had a RX 560 in it).  I wanted to use the MacPro as a full time Plex server but reuse the card elsewhere.  I pulled the card and it booted fine the very first time and I was able to access Plex, VNC to the box, see file shares, etc.\nThe only thing I would add is that it seems to have a small timeout before booting without a card (maybe 30 or 60 seconds) as it seems like the it takes about a minute longer before the Plex services come online after a cold boot.\n\nA: Based on the comments so far, I'm going to hazard a guess that no, it isn't possible to run the Mac with no video card - at least in my scenario.  I'd love to be proved wrong, but it is looking at this point like I will have to end up buying a video card.\n\nA: I think you can do this as long as you have access to another Mac with firewire support. Once you put a new drive in the Mac Pro, plug in a usb keyboard and hold down the \"t\" key while you turn it on and it powers up. This should put the Mac Pro into target disk mode. Connect it via firewire to the secondary Mac. Press and hold the option key while you power it on. This should allow you to select the Mac Pro as your startup disk. Initiate the installation using the secondary Mac.\n", "Q: Where does skype store downloads?

In this case I am able to install a profile with the minimal Wi-Fi profile.\nAs soon as I enable WPA2 Enterprise it fails.\n\nA: Most likely you are trying to apply a setting that isn't supported on the AppleTV 2.  I'd start with the typical troubleshooting of start simple and then add more.\nSo, create the profile with only the General section configured and apply it.  If that works, move on to another section.  Repeat until it stops working.\nSome items to look into are\n\n\n*\n\n*The encryption of the certificate.  If it is the wrong size or type, it might not be supported on the ATV2.  The device probably can't support the latest encryption methods.\n\n*Perhaps the PEAP authentication protocol you have selected in the WiFi section isn't supported, so try TLS.\n\n\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Long time for resetting procedure in iPhone 6 I am resetting my iPhone 6 (Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings) and it is taking a very long time.\nI have tried holding the middle button and on & off button but it just results in going back to the white screen with the black apple and the loading bar.

I am not disabling it as I want to reply to the mails from it that are being forwarded to my iCloud email. As my Gmail is being heavily spammed I want to stop syncing it with out disabling it. Or how can I add my gmail as alias in iCloud mail?\n\nA: You can remove the account from iCloud which will not disable it you just won't get the emails anymore; you can still log into it via a web browser if you like.

My left side (around 15% towards the edge) of iPad 2 has become unresponsive to touch, after I replaced with the wifi antenna.

I can pull it out and back in again, and it is the same result, so I don't know whether I should buy a new digitizer, or perhaps something in the motherboard is broken. How can I check this, anyone?\n\nA: Sadly the best way to check would be with another whole display assembly. It sounds like it could be the actual digitizer layer (sits under the LCD display that is covered by the gorilla glass) or at least part of it that's broken.

Once you've signed in and accepted the license agreement, you can wipe the Mac following this instruction and try the \"clean migration\" with no user accounts on the Mac to delay/reduce the transfer from PC.\n\n*Copy any documents to an external USB drive before erasing things\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904 - choose the erase install and use Internet Recovery to do the erase with no drives connected.\n\n\nAlso, you get phone support with a new Mac. You can do your best on these steps and then call to get a human to make sure you're on the right track with the erase / migration. https://apple.com/support\n\nA: On first boot, before configuring anything, you should be given three options. One is to start as a new Mac, one is to restore files from a Time Machine backup, and the third is to use Migration Assistant. Even if you've already started to use your Mac fresh out of the box and downloaded some things, you can still use Migration Assistant. I don't know how to use it, as my PC fried before I could get my hands on a Mac. \nTo use Migration Assistant (provided you're running Yosemite or El Capitan) you can click the magnifying glass icon in the upper right hand corner, next to your name, and type in \"migration\". Migration Assistant should be the top hit; press enter and follow the instructions in the dialog box. Hope this helps!\n", "Q: Weird sudo behavior on MacBook Pro I have a company MacBook Pro. I am sudoer and I can do anything that requires admin privileges when I'm connected to the company network. But I can't when I'm home. How is that possible?\n\nA: This special behavior is probably related to the sudoers file.\nBy modifying this file in /private/etc/ one can restrict the sudoers to particular networks or single IP-addresses:\nThe common user privileges specs are as following:\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL) ALL\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL\n        |    |    |command\n        |    |as user\n        | hosts\n\nThis means: the users of the group admin can sudo any command as any user (\"Runas\") from all networks.\nBy specifying a restricted host/network in the host alias specification earlier in the same file this may be changed:\n# Host alias specification\n\nHost_Alias      COMPNET = 172.17.0.0/255.255.0.0\n\nModifying the user privilege specifications to:\nroot    ALL=(ALL) ALL\n%admin  COMPNET=(ALL) ALL\n\ndoesn't allow you to execute sudo in your home network if the IP-address is not in the above range (e.g. your home network provides DHCP leases in the 192.168.0.0/24 range and none of the other interfaces have an IP in the above 172.17.0.0/255.255.0.0 network). Back in the company network (e.g. with a DHCP range 172.17.5.0/24) sudoing works again.\n", "Q: Can one fully remove certain applications from OS X? I've owned and used Mac's since System 7, and, in all this time, I'm very comfortable having my Mac's configured as I want them to operate.\nCertain things I've never used, and in addition to them taking up space, I don't even want them to open.\nOne app in particular, Mail.\nDon't like it, never will.\nOn those few occasions where I've to 'email someone, this application will open, which means I gotta close it, and, send out the email the way I do.\nIs it possible to remove Mail, as well as any of the default applications which come with OS X, or, if this isn't possible, is there a way to prevent Mail from even opening as an option?\n\nA: If you use any third party email app, you can configure in settings to open that email whenever you click an email link in any other app. To do so, you need to go to general settings of that very third party app and find the option that is usually listed as \"Use (app name) as default mail client\". \nFor instance, I'm using Nylas N1 and wehen you open the app and go under \"preferences\">\"general\">Workspace and check \"Use Nylas as my default mail client\". \nIf you tell me what app you are using as your default email client, I could help you find how to enable it, but it shouldn't be too much difference with any app.\nAs for removing systems build in apps: On OS X 10.10 Yosemite and earlier, it was possible to open a terminal window and issue commands to delete these system apps, which are located in the \n/Applications folder. For example, running the following command in a terminal window would delete the built-in Chess app. Be very careful when typing the following command:\nsudo rm -rf /Applications/Chess.app\n\nAs of Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan, System Integrity Protection protects these applications and other system files from being modified. This prevents you from deleting them, and it also ensures malware can’t modify these applications and infect them. If you actually did want to remove any of these built-in apps from your Mac, you’d have to disable System Integrity Protection first. I don’t recommend that. However, you can re-enable SIP afterwards and your Mac won’t mind that you’ve deleted Chess.app and other built-in system apps.\nReally, I recommend you, don’t do this. Mac OS X may automatically reinstall these applications in the future when you update the system, anyway. They don’t take up much space, and Apple provides no way to get them back beyond reinstalling OS X on your Mac.\nThis doesn’t actually erase an application’s preferences. Erase an application and it will leave preference files left over in your Library folders. Most of the time, these files will use very little space and won’t cause a problem. The preferences will still be available on your Mac, too — this is convenient if you’re uninstalling an app only to replace it with a newer version of the same app.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: While it is currently impossible to remove built-in system apps in El Capitan, Apple is considering allowing the removal of certain first-party apps in the future. For now, you'll just have to live with it. \n", "Q: I want to clean install OS X (El Capitan) on my MacBook Pro with two internal hard drives I have a MacBook Pro Late 2008 with two hard drives in it. (I replaced the CD drive with my original drive and I added SSD 60 GB on which I installed the OS X Yosemite. This happened some years ago.) Now I wish to upgrade my SSD to a larger size and also do a CLEAN installation of El Capitan on it. I can find information on how to do clean install no problem. However, before I go ahead my concerns/questions are:\n1) If I simply install El Capitan onto the new SSD, will the new OS recognise my other drive without problems and additional steps?\n2) Back-up; should I clone both drives to an external drive and also create a Time Machine backup - would this be sufficient to then migrate all the necessary files back? \n3) On the second drive I have a bootable Windows partition - I can start my Mac with Windows OS by holding ALT during startup now. Will this option appear after this whole procedure or will it have to be recreated from scratch again?\n\nA: Answer to Question 1.\nThe only way to know for sure is for you to edit your answer and post the output from the commands below.\nsudo  fdisk  /dev/disk0\nsudo  fdisk  /dev/disk1\n\nThese commands will not change your computer. What I am looking for is a small partition on the SSD that can be used to boot Windows. Most likely you don't have this partition, which would mean you are booting Windows entirely from your HDD. Anyway, this is the only way to know the answer for sure.\nAnswer to Question 2.\nI am not sure how to plan to clone a Windows partition. Personally, I use Winclone which is not free software. The OS X partition can be cloned using the Disk Utility. You can also save your files to a .dmg file on an external disk.  My preference would be to put the old drive in a USB enclosure. You then could not only boot OSX from this drive via the USB port, but you can copy necessary files back to your new internal SSD. As for using Time Machine, it has never been my choice, but other seem to prefer using it. \nAnswer to Question 3.\nSame as question 1. Depends on how your disks are partitioned. If you do end up recreating Windows from scratch, how do you intend to do that? You no longer have a optical drive.\nI will assume before doing anything, you have created a copy of your recovery partition to a USB flash drive. That way if every goes wrong, at least you can  boot from the flash drive and download Yosemite.\n\nA: Pertaining to the clean install, the OS should recognize your other drive as long as you 1) didn't change the means of connecting the drive to the computer and 2) didn't have to install any separate drivers/software to get the drive recognized. Now if you have done #2 then all you have to do is reinstall the drivers/software after the clean install, if not don't worry about it.\nNow for the backup I would personally prefer the Time Machine backup as I don't know as much as I'd like to about cloning. That being said, one thing to note is that cloning is more for keeping partition sizing and all that jazz, Time Machine backups are more about applications settings, data, and systems settings (the important stuff). Also Time Machine backups can be restored as soon as you boot up after a clean install. No extra steps or software required, just start the setup and select Restore from Time Machine backup.\nLastly, about your Windows drive, I know that resizing partitions on your drive (containing the Windows and Mac OS X partition) does something to Windows which stops it from booting. I recommend backing up your Windows data through some means within the Windows OS and then reinstall Windows fresh (after you've done all of your plans etc.) and restore your data.\nHope this answers all your questions!\nCheers! :)\n", "Q: How can I install Mac OS on my MacBook running Linux Mint? I am new here and I hope that this is the right place to find an answer.\nMy questin is: How can I install a new copy of OS X on my Mac, using Linux?\nI recently bought a Macbook Pro from a friend. I am not sure what's the exact model. This friend installed Windows XP on the mac (I don't know how exactly) and that's it. Nothing else is on the HDD. I tried to boot into recovery mode - doesn't work. I tried to boot into internet recovery - nothing happens. I tried Safe boot by pressing Shift Key - nothing happens. \nI created a bootable USB using another Windows PC - doesn't show up when I press C or option key. \nThe only thing that show's up when I press the option key is a HDD icon named Windows with an arrow under it. If I click it, it takes me to Windows XP, which I cannot use properly. The only thing I was able to do is to install Linux Mint 14 from an old DVD, which works ok except I don't have Wi-Fi. \nI've tried different USB sticks, created with Transmac or power iso or with terminal in Linux but nothing showing up the USB so I can boot from. \nAny ideas why? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: A possible solution for your problem may be the creation of a bootable USB using another Mac computer. \nIn this way the formatting (Mac OS Extended) of the drive will be compatible with Mac systems and it show up when you press C with option key. Then, following the steps you can erase the disk (removing Linux) and install the OS X that you desired.\n\nA: The best way is to obtain a copy of Mac OS X (which ever version you want or is supported by the laptop) and making a bootable USB which would allow you to install it. However the downside being that might only been done from another Mac ( I say might since there could be alternate ways that I don't know yet) \nI'd do a little more research on the subject and see if taking it to an Apple Store is a possibility. \n", "Q: How to empty all emails data when account deleted? My situation is quite simple and I searched the Internet without any solution to my problem. So I decided to give a try here!\nI have removed all email accounts (Gmail and Outlook) from my iPhone 5S accounts.\nI supposed that it will automatically delete all local emails data. But still, when I check the Mail usage (in Settings > General > Storage usage), it indicates 1GB used, so obviously data are still there and I found no way to erase it.\nSo my question is simple, considering my situation, how can I free this email storage?\n\nA: Assuming you have deleted the Gmail and Outlook accounts, if you preform a restore using iTunes and backups, all the email data will be free and so return available. \nEDIT: If you want you can also try with some specific application (e.g., PhoneClean) that help to clean the phone. Anyway, before download third part app I think the restore procedure (that is free) can work as well.\n", "Q: Where can I find/unbind control shift space?

I have a device with a web-based control panel, and accidentally set it to redirect all http pages to https, even though some don't work over https. Although I've since corrected this, Safari seems to have memorised the redirect and is refusing to forget it, instead constantly attempting to redirect me to the invalid https address.\nI've already closed Safari, cleared ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari/ and ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist but it still seems to be remembering the redirect when I re-open it.\nWhere else could Safari be storing this information? I can access the correct page via Firefox or Chrome, so it may not be a system wide service, or if it is it's not one that the other browsers use.\nUnfortunately because the web-panel is provided by a device I don't believe I can adjust headers or setup a redirect back to the correct URL, which seem to be options offered in other similar questions, so I really need to find out where this data is being stored so I can destroy it with fire.\n\nA: If you enable Develop menu in Safari preferences, you can clear cache from there (CMD+ALT+E).\nCan you confirm that opening the device's control panel in Safari's Private window (or different web browser) works correctly?

Usually if will be the full name, lower-cased and with no spaces, so if your full name is \"John Smith\" then the short-name may be \"johnsmith\".\n\n*Open a window in Terminal, type su shortname replacing \"shortname\" with the short-name of the affected user-account. Hit enter and, when prompted, enter the password for the affected account.\n\n*Now type the next command rm ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist and hit enter, this will delete the HSTS storage file.\n\n*Finally type exit, hit enter and close Terminal.\n\n\nAt this point you can now log back into the affected user account and the offending HSTS redirect should be gone for good.\nNow, while this provides a usable workaround, I'd really like to know why deleting the HSTS.plist file from my affected account didn't work; the fact it is recreated means some background process is responsible for it, which means it should be possible to delete the file from the affected user account by simply stopping that process, deleting the file, then relaunching the process.\nAnyone have any ideas which process is responsible for the ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist file? Once we know that it should be possible to give a simpler fix to the problem.\n\nA: You will have good results if you use the command line to curl the device to make sure it's not doing the redirection. Safari doesn't really have an engine to rewrite addresses - especially if you go into private browsing to remove any history, cookies, etc...\nIf you're not sure you have cleaned your safari enough, you can also test by opening system preferences and making a clean/new user account on the Mac and test the site on a totally clean version of Safari after logging out of your normal user.\n\nA: After trying all of these solutions, what worked for me was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove all instances of the domain from Safari's history\n\n*Quit Safari\n\n*Delete ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist\n\n*Restart\n\n\nA: Here's an idea!\nYou say you can't undo the redirect by setting the server to redirect https requests back to http (as you don't have admin access to do so).\nBut what if you trick safari into connecting to a different server that offers this reverse redirect?\nYou could set this up in your local machine's /etc/hosts file.\nFor example let's say the current cached redirect is from http://example.com to https://example.com.\nNow set up or identify a url that you can request on any server in the world that redirects from https back to http.  Let's say that server has the address of https://redirecting.example.com.\nThen look up the IP address of redirecting.example.com.  In Terminal you can do like this:\nhost redirecting.example.com\n\nYou get a result something like this:\nredirecting.example.com has address 69.69.69.69\n\nNow open up your /etc/hosts file and add a new line that points requests for example.com at the ip address of redirecting.example.com, like so:\n### point host example.com at the ip address of redirecting.example.com\n69.69.69.69 example.com\n\nSave your changes and clear your DNS cache in terminal like so:\nsudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder; say DNS cache flushed\n\nThen in Safari make a request for https://example.com the response should be a redirect back to http://example.com, at which point (fingers crossed) your Safari redirect from 6 months ago will be overwritten.\nWhen done remove the line you added to your /etc/hosts file and flush your DNS cache again.\n\nA: My two cents for new macOS Mojave 10.14 Beta (18A365a) \na) You cannot stop definitively nsurlstoraged, it relaunches in 2 seconds, even if sudo  \nb) you cannot delete \"HSTS.plist \": if You type:\nsudo rm -f ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist\n\nyou get: Operation not permitted\nc) even if you try:\nls -la ~/Library/Cookies/\n\nyou get: Operation not permitted\nthe same for \nnano ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist \n\n(empty file..)\nSo you cannot definitely access it. (maybe SIP ?)\nd) strangely you can delete if from Finder:\nCMD Shift G \"~/Library/Cookies/\"\n\nand you can delete with mouse:\n\ne) more strange: You can move to Desktop using mouse, edit and place it back!\n(a real nonsense, GUI is more powerful than sudo..)\n\nA: First make sure the server is not sending the Strict-Transport-Security header\nYou can do this with curl -I (-I just gets the headers)\ncurl -I http://my-http-domain.com\n\nIf the server is sending the Strict-Transport-Security header, removing it from your browser will have no effect, as next time you access the site, it will be set again.\nRemove your site from Safari's Http Secure Transport Security database\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Safari\n\n*Edit ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist\nSearch for the entry for the site you want to access over http and remove it, and save the file.  \n\n\n*\n\n*I prefer to edit rather than remove as there is no need to remove valid entries.  \n\n*I edit plist files using Xcode, but if it's not installed you can just use a text editor.\n\n\n*Restart your computer.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Instead of restarting your computer, you can restart nsurlstoraged but that can be involved due to SIP so a computer restart may be simpler. See Grant's answer and Quanta's answer about restarting nsurlstoraged\n\nA: I made a script from Grand Heaslip's answer:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nosascript -e 'quit app \"Safari\"'\nsleep 2\nkillall nsurlstoraged\nsleep 2\nrm -f ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist\nlaunchctl start /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.nsurlstoraged.plist\n\nIt gracefully ends safari, stops nsurlstoraged, removes the HSTS.plist, and starts nsurlstoraged again.\nThis worked fine for me here on macOS 10.13.5\n\nA: I'm using Mojave (10.14). I tried the methods given so far to remove HSTS.plist. In addition, I needed to add Terminal to the System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Full Disk Access list to cure the symptom \"Operation not permitted\" when listing the contents of ~/Library/Cookies/.\nBut, removing the file and restarting the daemon didn't work. So I tried opening Safari again, went to Preferences, Privacy, Manage Website Data. Then I removed all \"cache cookies, local storage\" for the offending domain name. That solved my problem.\nI can't say now if removing HSTS was required or not.\n\nA: Very simple as of Safari 16.2\n\n*\n\n*Safari > Preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data…\n\n*Search for the domain for which you want to reset HTTP redirections.\n\n*Click \"Remove\".\n\n*\n\n*Note: This removes \"Cache, Cookies, Local Storage, and HSTS Policy\" altogether for that particular domain. There is no method to delete only the cached HTTP redirections alone.\n\n\n\nHow I determined that this really works\nOn a web server under my control I used Wordpress with the Redirection plugin.\n\n*\n\n*Wordpress > Admin Menu > Tools > Redirection > Log: Is empty.\n\n\n*I intentionally trigger a HTTP 301 redirection by entering URL-1 which gets redirected to URL-1-transformed.\n Server side log shows URL-1 → URL-1-transformed with the timestamp of my request.\n\n\n*I invoke the same URL-1 again 2 more times.\n Server side log does not show any corresponding log entries.\n This means that the web browser has used its own HTTP redirection cache.\n\n\n*Cleared HTTP redirection cache for the domain as in the 1-2-3 instruction above.\n\n\n*Again requested URL-1 3 times. Always got redirected properly.\n Server side log shows URL-1 → URL-1-transformed with the timestamp of the first request of my new request series.\n That timestamp for the 1st new request proves that Safari had no more client-side HTTP redirection cache for the given domain and hence asked the server which then answered with a HTTP 301 redirection response.\n The 2nd and 3rd request from that series then again must have happened via the client side HTTP cache as the server side log showed no corresponding redirection log entries.\nFurther background infos\nAfter step #3 or #5 searching on disk for URL-1 or URL-1-transformed in the web browsers application data folders or caching folders yields nothing.\n\n*\n\n*This cache seems to be solely in RAM.\n\n*And only get persisted rarely or possible not at all.\n\nPossible reasons why the browser vendors don't persist this:\n\n*\n\n*The redirection headers may have a short lifespan due their expiration-date being close.\n\n*Possibly also for performance reasons browsers keep this solely in RAM.\n\n*And overally due to the rather ephemer nature and potential undesired side effects the web browser developers possible do not consider it necessary/worthy to build methods to write/read this to/from persistent storage.\n\nThere are no known tools to inspect or manipulate cached HTTP redirections in:\n\n*\n\n*Safari Web Inspector\n\n*Google Chrome DevTools — A similar thread on Google Chrome says: \"It's unclear where Chrome stores the redirects.\"\n\nHow long to cache HTTP redirects also varies greatly across browsers.\nTested on Safari 16.2 (released 2022-12-13) on macOS 11.7.2 Big Sur (elder OS already).

I'm currently writing a workout logging application in for iOS. My application requires a user to create an account to start logging. All that's required is: username, password, gender, bodyweight. Username/password is used for the initial database row entry, and for unique queries from database. And then gender and bodyweight is used to calculate a Wilks Coefficient (takes into account gender and bodyweight to compare strength among individuals). And that's it. I wrote a privacy policy for this. Was about to submit for review and find out. But looking through the App Review guidelines, it was a tad unclear on the requirements.\n\nA: As long as it's explicit in the privacy policy, it should be ok. Have you considered adding HealthKit capability? \n", "Q: iPad DEP asking for credentials - Cisco Meraki MDM I have been using Cisco Meraki for my MDM and it has been working great. I just bought a bunch of new iPads and am setting up DEP for the first time.  I have done all the steps required: Added the order to my Apple DEP account, pushed them to my Cisco Meraki MDM and assigned settings.\nNow on the iPad during initial setup I get to a step that says that my organization is going to automatically setup this iPad (which is good).  The next step asks for credentials in a Username and Password.  I have tried my organization ones, my MDM ones but do not know what this password would be for.  \nWatching this YouTube video, the iPad here does not have this step. I have done everything the same in this video.\nAny suggestions?\nEDIT: Adding some photos from the iPad setup:\nAfter \"Setup iPad as New iPad\"\n\n\nThe blanked out bits are my organization name.\n\nA: After ringing Apple support (1.5 hours on hold...) they were able to help me find a configuration error in Cisco Meraki.  \nUnder Systems manager --> Configuration --> General --> User authentication settings.  I had it set to Active Directory authentication.\nThis is an extra level of security you can add to the DEP process where users must enter their credentials against an AD or OD server.  However for me the link to my AD server was not valid. \nAfter fixing it was all good.\n", "Q: Is it safe to turn off Block IPv6 on my Airport Extreme I think I am having issues trying to connect to servers that are using IPv6. Mainly related to local web development. \nOn this Github Issue relating to my specific problem and they recommend disabling IPv6 on the Mac and while this does fix the issue I would like to turn on IPv6 if possible, as long as it is secure to do so. \nhttps://github.com/composer/composer/issues/4748\nI went digging in the Airport Extreme Router to see if there might be some setting causing an issue. I found this setting that blocks incoming IPv6 connections. \n\nI wanted to see if there was a reason that this blocking of IPv6 incoming was ENABLED and found a security bug from 2007. I am assuming it is fixed?\nSo the questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this setting safe to disable on AirPort Extreme routers?\n\n*Would this setting be part of the problem causing me not to connect to IPv6 machines?\n\n\nA: It has been my experience, that with OS X, enabling IPv6 is not a good idea. I live in the USA and outside of the USA things may be different. The default should be to prefer IPv6 over IPv4. Since most, if not all, of the USA is still using IPv4, one is better of setting your computer to prefer IPv4 over IPv6. With Windows, this can be done by downloading from this site. \nThe problem is OS X prefers neither. Instead it tries to determine which is better. The result is you end up waiting. Sometimes this can be a long wait. It is my understanding that if you can configure OS X to prefer IPv4 or IPv6, the operating system will ignore the setting. The only reasonable option is to turn IPv6 off.\n", "Q: Why/how does the iOS 1970 bug work? There's been a lot of discussion lately about the 1970 iOS bug. How/why does it happen?\nIs it due to the UNIX epoch at 00:00:00 1/1/1970, so anything negative causes a crash which Apple never accounted for since that date is way before the iPhone was even considered?\n\nA: According to http://www.macrumors.com/2016/02/15/apple-to-fix-january-1-1970-date-bug-ios/:\n\nApple has not provided a reason for the bug, but YouTube video maker\n  and programmer Tom Scott speculates that setting the date close to\n  January 1, 1970, which is 00:00:00 in Unix time, may be resulting in\n  an integer underflow -- in this case, a date prior to January 1, 1970.\niOS then handles the underflow by returning the negative integrer to\n  the maximum value, which Scott says results in a date that is some 20\n  times longer than the universe is expected to last. Scott believes iOS\n  may have difficulties handling this large number, resulting in\n  affected devices crashing.\n\n", "Q: BBEdit - Have the Sidebar closed by default Currently whenever I open up BBEdit the Sidebar is open by default.\nThe Sidebar is where it shows a list of files that were already open in BBEdit.

If you are running El Capitan, this file will definitely be genuine as long als you did't disable System Integrity Protection or SIP (or rootless mode as you could find it referred to). If you never touched terminal or used any shady apps, it's most likely not disabled.\nIf you want to be sure your WirelessRadioManagerd thingy is genuine, you can upload it to VirusTotal and see for yourself :) (tip: copy it to your desktop for easy selecting it when you upload it)\n\nA: Looks like a remote control client is installed (see https://github.com/tnextday/iRaT) - yes, I'd be concerned.\n", "Q: How to partition 128 MB space on El Capitan? I'm trying to dual boot Ubuntu with El Captain MacBook Pro mid 2012 following this guide: How to Dual-Boot OS X and Ubuntu\nI want to partition a 128 MB space called Ubuntu Boot Loader along side my main partition but, when using Disk Utility, this task seems impossible. It will create another untitled partition (half the size of my drive (128 GB)) and then when I hit accept it will only create that Untitled 128 GB partition (but name it Ubuntu Boot Loader) and it will fail on creating my 128 MB partition. I have no idea how to simply make a small partition, is there an easier way to do it on Mac without dealing with all the BS introduced by Disk Utility? Can provide pics of whats happening if needed.\n\nA: This link seems to explain it pretty well. Though HFS+ is well within the bounds of creating a partition that size, Disk Utility attempts to prevent you from creating any partition under 10% of the size of your disk. You'll want to use diskutil from the command line instead. Take a look at partitionDisk, resizeVolume, and splitPartition to determine which one is right for you.\n", "Q: How to convert the cable in my photo to USB? I have an external hard-disk that doesn't have a USB port. It works with my MacBook. Now, I'd like to connect it to a PC machine, so I'd need to know how to convert the cable to USB. I'm not sure the name of my Apple cable (but it's definitely not a USB cable) and I don't have any idea whether the conversion to USB is even possible.\n\n\nA: The cable you have there is a Thunderbolt Cable (herein referred to as TB).  You can get a TB to USB adapter, but you cannot get a USB to TB adapter.\nWhy?\nFirst an understanding of Thunderbolt...\nIn short, TB is a combination of of the PCIe Bus and Display Port (herein referred to as DP).  Thunderbolt Overview\nYour PCIe Bus, simply put, is the interface that adapter cards use to connect different peripherals to your computer.  While both PC and Macs have PCIe Interfaces, it's much easier to show the ones on a PC, due to their expandability.  Rest assured, while these connectors aren't in your Mac, the bus is.  It's how your HDD, WiFi, etc all interface with the CPU and each other.\n\nUsing the PC as an example again, suppose you want to add a network adapter to your machine.  You just buy an adapter like the one below.\n\nWhat TB does is take all that tech, put it on a cable and allow you to attach the adapter OUTSIDE your machine.  So, for the example above, TB puts it all in a nice, neat package like what's below:\n\nOr a TB to USB...\n\nUSB, for all intents and purposes, is just a serial data cable, it just has two data channels, a ground, and  5v power.  It does not cary any PCIe bus traffic whatsoever - it just doesn't have the capability.\nIt's sort of like recording your favorite TV show on a DVR.  While you get the finished product, there is no way for you to recreate all of the tracks, video frames, etc to turn it back into raw footage; it's a one way street.\nNow...How do you connect that drive so that your PC can use it.   Assuming you have desktop PC with an open PCIe slot, you can use something like this HP Thunderbolt Adapter \nIf it's a PC laptop, you won't be able to connect the drive, and your best best would be to share it across the network.\nHow do you do that?\nIt's fairly easy.  OS X Daily has a very good write up already.  \nAfter you have gotten access to your files, I would look at switching out your drive for a USB model so that it would be compatible with all your computers.\n\nA: That's called Thunderbolt. Due to the nature of Thunderbolt, you can't directly convert it to USB. You may be better off accessing the disk some other way, such as sharing it with your PC over IP. \n", "Q: WiFi Not staying connected after sleep-wake Background\nI am having keychain issues since upgrading to El Capitan, Described below.

My son has an account on our 2013 Mac mini running El Capitan, guarded by Parental Controls. Every few days or so, he has a login failure that causes his login to hang on exactly the second attempt.\nMost logins work as normal. However, if we're going to have a bad day, the first login appears normal until about ten seconds after I authorize his time with my login. The screen turns black with a still visible mouse pointer, and about ten seconds after that, he's kicked back to the login screen. The second login thereafter (which doesn't require parental authorization) gives the rainbow beachball for at least ten minutes, at which point I just reboot the machine.\nNo other account on the machine is affected, so I assume he's done something or installed something that's causing this. It's also possible that Parental Controls are wonky.\nThe problem seems to be caused (or, at least fixed) by his Preferences; I delete everything in ~/Library/Preferences/*.plist and he can log in again.\nI've actually gone so far as to recreate his account several times, and, annoyingly, the problem reappears after a while.\nWhat can I do to debug this and get to the root cause? I've been through system logs and kernel logs, but there are literally hundreds of various \"error\" messages, all of which seem to be being thrown by any user logged in and aren't unique to his account.\n\nA: Known to be broken in El Capitan up through .3.  Apple is supposed to be 'on it'...we'll see.\nReferenced in https://discussions.apple.com/message/29704747#29704747\n", "Q: How to do transfer data via iTunes from iPhone 4S to 6S I'm trying to transfer data from a 4S backup via iTunes to a new iPhone 6S, but being told that I need a newer version of iTunes despite having just downloaded iTunes in my MacBook Pro 10.6.8.\n\nA: You will need iTunes 12, which can only be run on newer versions of OS X. From the Mac App Store, download the free upgrade of OS X 10.11 El Capitan. Then, update iTunes. From there, you can just plug in your 4s, back it up, and then plug in the 6s and restore from that backup. Make sure you choose Encrypt iPhone Backup so you won't have to sign in to every app again after the restore. \n\nA: You'll need iTunes 12 which isn't available on Snow Leopard, only Lion and higher.\n", "Q: Geektool coding to remove image after a set time I'm trying to edit a 3rd party script written in AppleScript (OAS...I think) to dim the volume after showing changes.

This results in a lot of unwanted clicking. Tap-to-click works fine and causes no issues.\nIs there a way to disable the trackpad hardware, but not disable tap-to-click?\nThanks!\n\nA: I do not know of any way to disable the physical clicking of a \nTrackpad. The OS X trackpad preferences can be found here, or by going to System Preferences -> Trackpad. If the Trackpad is constantly telling the OS to click, then there is little you can do to get around this.

Thus, I am supposed to be charging from the cable, but instead it is discharging as I use my ipad Air 2, as if it is not plugged in for a charge.\nIs this normal?  Or is there a setting which is incorrect?\nThanx for the assistance.\n\nA: No, this is not normal. If you plug another iOS device in using the power brick and Lightning cable, will it charge? Most likely, it is a faulty Lightning cable. A MFi replacement can be found here, much cheaper than from the Apple Store. Make sure, if you are not original Lightning cable, that you are using one that is Made for iPhone (MFi). The ones you can buy at Walgreens do not meet Apple standards. \n", "Q: Resetting a bought used iPad 2 I'm buying a used iPad 2 through Craigslist.  He has lost his iCloud account info for that iPad 2. If he does a factory reset on the iPad 2 and I bought it after reset, would it be possible during set up. \nCan I use my own iCloud info to go forward and pass through, on the set up of the iPad 2 once I bought it from that person?\n\nA: It depends on if he signed out of his iCloud account and turned off Find my iPad first. iOS has a built-in feature so that a thief cannot wipe a device and login with his own credentials. If he did log out, then you will be fine. If he didn't, he should go to iCloud.com and reset his password if he does not know his credentials.  From there, he can turn off Find my iPad remotely so you can login. If you cannot set up the iPad, and he does not perform these steps, you will not be able to use the iPad. \n", "Q: Lost iPhone not connected to Find My iPhone! Lost my iPhone and it wasn't connected to Find My iPhone, how can I find it?\n\nA: Unless you explicitly turned Find My iPhone off, it was on. Try this anyway: go to iCloud.com/find and sign into your iCloud account using your Apple ID. Click Find my iPhone. Choose Locate an iOS device. If it is turned on, and the phone is still online, it will show you on a map. If it does not, then either you did turn off Find my iPhone or it is offline. If either of those is the case, it's time to visit the Apple Store and buy a new iPhone. \n\nA: Okay small change to the post above you could contact your sim carrier who can help you locate your phone through tracking.\n", "Q: iPhone storage is full while iCloud is empty What can I send to iCloud and how do I do that? My iPhone is full and my iCloud has barely been used. Can you help me please?\n\nA: The biggest thing that takes up storage is photos. If you're running iOS 9 or later, then go to Settings -> iCloud -> Photos and enable iCloud Photo Library. Then, make sure optimize iPhone storage is checked. Also, delete any apps that you may not use. Pay close attention to games. They eat up the most space. Switching to a streaming music service like Music or Spotify will also let you free up space by deleting music on your device. \n\nA: You mean your iPhone storage is full and you you want to back up some data on iCloud so that you can have more storage on your iPhone, am I correct? \nNow, I'd like to share with you how to turn on and use iCloud. \nGo to Settings → iCloud to see all the settings and options on your iPhone or iPad. If you have not turned iCloud on already this is where you can log in to iCloud with your Apple ID and password. After you log in you will see options to turn on iCloud options which control what iCloud can do. Most users will want to leave these iCloud options turned on. When turned on, the options sync to iCloud so that they are accessible on iCloud.com and on your other Apple devices.\nYou can toggle any options you don’t want to the off position to stop syncing that data with your devices and iCloud. Any of the settings with an On > option offers more information and settings that you can control. These include iCloud Drive, Photos, Backup, Keychain and Find My iPhone.\nIf you want to know how to make more space, you can try other ways, such as clean up caches and temporary files, maybe iMyfone Umate is a good choice for you. \nHave you installed the app \"WhatsApp\"? Seems it was the app \"WhatsApp\", creating lots of cache files and stealing storage from the phone. You should try to install the update and see whether the storage came back to normal.\n\n\nA: You can go to Setting>General>Usage to check what us takes up your iPhone storage.\nMostly, there are photos, videos, songs etc. So you can thansfer these data to iCloud.\nYou can also backup all your data to iCloud and then delete backup, and photos, videos, songs from your iPhone. So as to get storage on iPhone.\nTo get more storage back, you can also try to delete the junk files, such as Safari cookies, caches, history etc. And the fast way to do this is uninstall and reinstall the app who eat up you so much storage.\n", "Q: Tracking down hard shutdown cause—software? hardware? overheat? I'm running Mac OS X 10.7.4 on a 15-inch, early 2011 MacBook Pro.\nI've had the Mac crash a few times in the last couple months, all attributable to letting it discharge (careless me!) except for the most recent time, today.  Today the Mac still had 12% battery or so, and it switched itself off—with the same \"power down\" physical switching noise that accompanies a switch off if you hold down the power button.  No warning message of any kind was displayed prior to the switchoff.\nWhen I then moved it over to my desk and plugged in the power, I noticed that the bottom of the laptop was hot enough to actually hurt my hand, which made me wonder if the shutdown was due to overheating.  (?)\nWhen plugged in (without me touching any buttons, the lid still open), the computer made a couple of physical \"reset\" noises followed by switch-off noises, then succeeded in booting itself to the grey apple logo.  On login the computer restored windows normally, except I was then prompted me to re-enter my App Store password to enable one of my apps to be run on this \"new\" computer.  This is the only Mac I've ever had, though.\nIn the \"Console\" application, I have 10 different \"help_(date)_(computer).crash\" reports from within the past month.  The last is from today.  I can't tell if any of the info in it is relevant to diagnosing the shutdown, but I can't find any other diagnostic data that seems relevant, except the laconic message:\n2/15/16 4:52:59.000 PM kernel: Previous Shutdown Cause: -128\n\nWhat I really want to know is: Why did my computer shut itself down with no warning?  Was this from overheating?  Is there a way to prevent this from happening again (or does it even matter)?\n\nA: As it turned out, my battery had reached and surpassed the end of its life.  It was rated good for 1000 full charge cycles; it had gone through nearly 1200 (in roughly a five-year time span.)\nI got the battery replaced and all was well.\n", "Q: 2012 MacBook Pro OS X El Capitan wont boot into windows 8.1 after a HD partition change I had windows 8.1 installed with bootcamp and it was running fine but I ran out of space on the partition I originally created. I had read online that I could free up space from OSX by creating a new partition on the HD and re-claiming it on the windows side. I partitioned about 60 gb from my HD with disk utility and now I can't even boot to Windows. This is what my disk utility shows. \n\nYou can see that bootcamp shows up here and says it is mounted. It also shows up when selecting the startup disk.\n\nHowever, I believe it showed as a drive previously instead of a folder. When I try to boot Windows from this menu my MacBook restarts and goes to a screen saying there is no bootable drive. After trying many things I thought I would just erase the bootcamp partition and start over but when I start the bootcamp assistant it says \"The startup disk must be formatted as a single Mac OS Extended (Journaled) volume or already partitioned by Boot Camp Assistant for installing Windows.\" \nAny ideas of how I can recover my Windows partition or even just get rid of it and do a fresh windows install would be greatly appreciated! \n\nA: Try this:\nsudo fdisk -e /dev/disk0\np\nsetpid 4\n07\nflag 4\np\nwrite\ny\n\nThis is assuming that your Boot Camp partition is still active, just not bootable. Reboot, and hold the option key as usual, and see if the bootable partition is available. This will likely fix your issue. \nJust in case it doesn't, this article outlines some steps you can try.\n\nA: No need to navigate out of current folder, just enter the fdisk command without the sudo, i.e. : fdisk -e /dev/disk0\nThis will hopefully work, don't be worried if you get a message about MBR not accessible, you should be under the fdisk command prompt, enter 'p' you should then see all your partitions.\nAmong those partitions you should see one named \"Darwin Boot\" and the next partition should be your windows partition having currently an \"id\" 0C, take note of that partition number at the beginning of the line. Use that number instead of 4 if different when you apply the rest of the commands:\nsetpid 4\n07\nflag 4\np\nwrite\ny\n\nThen close the terminal and reboot.\n\nA: I encountered the same problem as you and also couldn't change the partition when using Terminal. I managed to go around that by using Recovery Mode. \nTo access Recovery Mode, restart your Mac while holding the ⌘ Command+R keys during the boot process, before the Apple logo.\nOnce there, in the menu bar, open Utilities > Terminal and use the fdisk commands. This time, you will be able to write the changes and to make them active at the next reboot.\n"]
