Is there any way of viewing the composer of a particular song in the Ipod Touch? I know you can sort songs by composer, but what I want to do is while listening to a particular album (classical music), view the composers of the different songs.\n\nA: There's a small app you can find here\nDon't worry, it's all Japanese. But the app works really fine and reads all (!) ID3 tags of the current song playing.\nSince I am listening preferably to classical music, too, I hate iTunes non-existent ability to show all relevant tag information.\n\nA: I don't think this is possible in the default 'Music' app which is quite simple and straightforward. The only solution would be to add the composer to the track's title but I suppose you already thought about this one...\nFinding another app for paying music but with more options would be another solution. Are you open to having another application for playing music?\n", "Q: In iOS 4.2, how do you search within a web page in Safari? I already have it installed (the gold master), but I can't for the life of me figure out how to search a page.\n\nA: Searching in a page has been added on to the Google (or whatever you use) search facility. Just tap the search field and enter your search term. Instead of launching the search, scroll down to the bottom of the suggested searches and there will be a section labeled \"On This Page\". Tapping \"Find \"___________\"\" will launch the in-page search feature.\n\n\n\nA: An unofficial method is to use the \"Find In Page\" bookmarklet. Available here.\n", "Q: Why does the Finder run at such a low process priority? I'm at a bit of a loss about this.\nI'm running a big import in aperture, and it's causing my system to slow down to a complete crawl, basically rendering it unusable for anything, even browsing the web. Since this seems a bit unnatural, I spent a little time looking around.\nRunning ps -Al shows that, apparently by default, the Dock, Finder, and SystemUIServer all seem to run at a priority far lower then userland applications. While user applications typically have a priority of 33, the Dock, Finder, etc have a priority of 53.\nThe end result, is ANY processor intensive task completely clobbers the UI, and renders the system unusable until it finishes.\nAnyways, using renice -20 -p <prid> bumps them up to the same priority as the rest of the userland UI, and results in not having to wait 1-3 seconds (!) for the UI to respond to something as simple as a mouse click.\nThad said, I have two questions:\nIs there any reason I shouldn't be altering the thread priority of the finder like this?\nIs there any way to make the priority change persistent, e.g. so it stays that way after reboot.\n\nA: I'm not sure anyone short of Apple's own developers would be able to answer this question, Finder's inner secrets are their domain. If you do think there are some noticeable lag problems with the UI you might want to submit a bug report to Apple about it.\nJudging from the sound of things (processes intentionally taking up all resources) this is a bit of an edge case for memory management. I've yet to see a system perform at their best without somewhere around 10-20% resources free, as a buffering aid.\nJust curious, what are these processes you're running?\n\nA: \"I'm running a big import in aperture, and it's causing my system to slow down to a complete crawl\"\nThen Aperture is (probably) the program you want to renice, not the others. The processes you mentioned are tuned relative to average user applications, so that user applications get higher priority and remain responsive, since they are what users use most of the time.\nYour case is the less-common one, where an application is performing a long-term, intensive task and the user wants to do something else at the same time. By default, it's the user's applications that get priority so that these intensive tasks get more resources and complete sooner.\nFor every user that complains that other applications aren't being responsive enough, there is another user complaining that the active application isn't running fast enough.\nIf you are running a long, resource intensive task and you know you want it to have lower priority so you can use other processes while the task completes—and you don't mind if the intensive task takes longer—you should lower the priority of the process running the intensive task.\nAs for your second question, there are several possible solutions for making the renice more automatic. For example, you could create a script applet that runs Aperture at a lower priority and use that to start Aperture. Or you could start Aperture via a shell script stored in a *.command file (however, that will open Terminal and run the command in a terminal window, which may not be what you want). Each of these is a little involved. If you would like examples, I can see about providing them later.\n\nA: I posed a similar question - long ago, on ServerFault - though not as specifically focused on the Finder (although I DO find the Finder to be intolerably slow, as well).  How to permanently “renice” a process on Mac OS X (or iOS, etc)?  Not much info was gleaned there - as to a good way to do this… or as to why it is such..\nI still think about this often, and there are actually a few ways to muss with the \"basics\" if you so dare.  As previously mentioned, you can do various shell chicanery.. but a good place for such misdeeds are the various /etc/rc* boot routines.. which are already up in there.. setting all sorts of arbitrary (apple-defined) system parameters for you.  either edit those, or lookup how to add your own routines to the boot process.\nalso, if you really want to make your head explode..\nsudo sysctl list and it's key to pandora's box, aka /etc/sysctl.conf\n", "Q: Is this nice extension of Mac OS 9 still available on OS X? There was an extension on Mac OS 9 system that I could not live without : This extension offered the following feature : \nWhen a \"Choose a file / folder\" dialog box appeared, you were able to click on a \"visible\" opened window to make the selection box \"jump\" to that particular place in the tree structure of the disk (on the network).\nIs there something like this on OS X ?\n\nA: Not exactly the same but if you drag any file or folder to the dialog panel then it will jump to the location of the dropped item\n\nA: You are looking for Default Folder X.\n", "Q: Run Command Line Script from Finder's contextual menu I have a shell script that deletes exif data from images.\nI would like to right-click the folder with the images and execute the command from the context menu. How can I do this?\nThe Shell script is:\nexiftool -all= -overwrite_original test\n\nwhere test is the dir with the images\n\nA: If you're using Snow Leopard, you can create a Service, and it'll show up in a submenu of the contextual menu (as well as in the Services submenu of the Finder menu).  To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run /Applications/Automator.app\n\n*Choose the Service template\n\n*Set the Service Receives Selected pop-up (above the workflow column on the right) to \"Files and Folders\"\n\n*Find the Run Shell Script action in the second column (the search field at the top can help), and drag it to the workflow column\n\n*Set the action's Pass input: pop-up to \"as arguments\"\n\n*In the template script that appears, replace echo \"$f\" with exiftool -all= -overwrite_original \"$f\" -- the script should now look like this:\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n    exiftool -all= -overwrite_original \"$f\"\ndone\n\n\n*Save the Service with some descriptive name\n", "Q: Changing sort options in icon view Is there any way to sort files in any way other than NAME while in ICON view? This is typically when in a file dialog (i.e. browser upload window) there are no options for sorting by Last Modified or similar, you have to be in DETAIL view for that.\nPlease see this screen shot as an example: http://cl.ly/0w0f3L0z3z0Q2n2E042F\n\nA: No.\nI would suggest heading to http://bugreport.apple.com and filing a bug there. Apple does base, in part, what they do on the number of similar bug reports they get. If enough people want this same enhancement and file bug reports, there is a good chance Apple will get it done.\n\nA: File dialogs have had a pop-up menu for changing the arrange by mode since Lion:\n\nThere's still no way to change the sort by mode in icon view or column view. And the shortcuts for changing the sorting modes don't do anything.\n", "Q: How to back up Windows 7 on Boot Camp to a Mac-formatted external drive? I have MacBook Pro with latest Snow Leopard on it. I just bought an Iomega eGo external HDD for Time Machine backup.\nI also run Windows 7 on Boot Camp partition and I normally use Parallels 6 to run it, but I noticed that Time Machine does not backup Boot Camp partition.\nI went to Windows 7 Backup and Restore tool to see if I can backup Windows separately but it didn't recognize my Iomega HDD probably because it's Mac-formatted. \nI discovered MacDrive that allows Windows to work with Mac-formatted disks. I'm wondering if that will allow me to use Windows Backup and Restore tool to backup to Iomega HDD.\nWill it work?\nWhat is your Boot Camp Windows 7 on-site backup strategy? I'd like to avoid buying another external HDD for Windows...\n\nA: Using Snow Leopard Disk Utility, I made three partitions on an external hard drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*HFS+  for Time Machine\n\n*MSDOS, subsequently converted to NTFS, for Windows 7 backup\n\n*EXFAT for shared media e.g. iTunes Library\n\n\nI have not yet made a final decision about what backup package to use for Windows 7.  At the moment, I'm using Microsoft's Windows 7 backup solution, with manual image files, and trying to keep any data files in the Cloud.\nI do not yet have even 10 days experience with this setup.\n\nA: I keep my documents on the Mac side as I'm pretty much only using Parallels to run my BootCamp install, so that way they're backed up. I don't really mind doing a fresh reinstall of windows if something goes wrong.\n\nA: WinClone\nSaves your whole Windows installation as an image that you can restore later. Excellent for backing up and restoring Windows bootcamp installations, but the developer is gone, but the software may still work though. \nSome people say it works on Snow Leopard, while it doesn't. I'm planning on using it in a hard drive upgrading, but that's just me. Should work fine though.\n\nA: I'm using iPartition and Disk Utility for this. Makes sparse images (i.e. doesn't copy empty space from Windows side). Could be more automated, but I'm pleased.\nSee my blog from 2/2011 on this:\nhttp://openduck.blogspot.fi/2011/02/backing-up-boot-camp-partition-with.html\n", "Q: Can iOS 4 connect automatically to a closed network with a hidden SSID?  Problem: (stressing the \"automatically\" in the question title).\nI add the hidden network by selecting \"other\" and entering the SSID. There is no security right now in order to simplify troubleshooting. When the iPod 4 sleeps, goes out of range or the wifi radio is turned off and then on, the iPod will not re-connect to the hidden SSID once within range again. Strange, considering I reset the network configurations before setting up the 1 and only network the iPod 'knows' as well as having installed a configuration profile on the iPod with the wi-fi settings for this hidden SSID. Nothing i try seems to get the iPod to connect automatically. The hidden SSID does appear in the list of networks when I go into wireless settings, but thats not good enough - the iPod needs to connect to the hidden network without any user intervention.\nI should mention the router is a cisco aironet 1100 series AP. The AP has 2 SSIDs: the hidden network and a \"Guest\" network, and it is broadcasting the Guest network. The Subnets are different, in case anyone was wondering. Also, No, i cannot broadcast the hidden SSID; I'm not looking to change the network settings.\nThe iPod is running iOS 4.1(8B117) and is a 4g model.\nThanks,\nAustin\n\nA: *\n\n*Note -- I haven't tested this or worked with a similar configuration *\n\n\nIt isn't clear from your description -- does the iPod auto connect to the \"Guest\" network?\nIf it does, in the Wi-Fi settings I would (in the WiFi settings) turn \"Ask to Join Networks\" off then tell the machine to forget the \"Guest\" network, then connect to the hidden network again and then sleep the device and see if it reconnects to the hidden network.\nOr -- Go to Settings then General then Reset and then Reset Network Settings, then power off and power on the device, then reconnect to the hidden network.\nOr -- you could also try Apple's iPhone Configuration Utility, which allows you to set profiles for iOS devices. I haven't messed with this at all, but some folks have mentioned it as a fix.\n\nA: Okay, so this solved the issue for me. Could ber completely wrong because my fix isnt ipod/Iphone related, although the same proplems described above have happened to my ipod.\n*Please note: Precedure will vary for other routers. These instructions are specific to Netgear DGN2000 Wireless-N Router with Built-in DSL Modem.\nStep 1. Using your computer, log into your routers login/Manager page. my default login address is  * http://192.168.0.1 *\nStep 2. Under setup (on the left hand side) click Wireless Settings.\nStep 3. In the first section under \"Wireless Network\" there is a sub-heading \"Mode\".\nSelect the desired wireless mode. The options are:\n* g & b   - Both 802.11g and 802.11b wireless stations can be used.\n* g only   - Only 802.11g wireless stations can be used.\n* b only   - All 802.11b wireless stations can be used. 802.11g wireless stations can still be used if they can operate in 802.11b mode.\n* Up to 130 Mbps   - Wireless stations that support up to 130 Mbps can be used, such as the WN511B. In this case, your router will transmit two streams with different data in the same channel at the same time.\n* Up to 270 Mbps   - Wireless stations that support up to 270 Mbps can be used, such as the WN511B. Your router will run in channel expansion mode to achieve 270Mbps. This mode will support 40MHz or 20MHz bandwidth. The router will transmit data with expansion or no expansion frame by frame to avoid interference from other APs/clients data transmission. \n\nThe default is \"Up to 130 Mbps\", which allows all 11b and 11g wireless stations. The NETGEAR WN511B runs at 126 Mbps or 270 Mbps when accessing this router. \nMine was set on \"Up to 270 Mbps\" mode. the iPod/iPhone's do not support this mode very well.\nTHe best choice i found was the \"Up to 130 Mbps\" mode.\nMy iPod connected straight away and has worked perfectly with my hidden network.\nStep 4. Be sure to save and apply your settings.\nIf this helps anyone, please post a reply. Interested to know if this is \"one\" solution to what could be one of many problems on this topic, actually works for others.\n<3 Dallen :]\n\nA: Interesting scenario, I don’t believe there’s an existing easy solution to this problem. Part of the problem in solving this particular issue, is that the iPod (and its iOS) are fairly closed environments where you can hardly modify anything beyond what the UI offers. If the device is not reconnecting (despite having knowledge of the network), there’s no magic option to “flip” and expect it to work; especially considering that you’ve stated that nothing on the networking side should/must be changed. Even if changing certain network parameters in the router were allowed by you, I don’t recall anything that could help you there. You might want to try (for the sake of testing) disabling the “other” network, or little things like that. Not because you will necessarily reach a solution, but at least you might find the root of the problem or the cause and either find a workaround or… spiritually deal with it. ;)\n", "Q: Safari has some strange colors now Safari has suddenly started showing some strange GUI colors on the bookmarks screen. They seem to have started shortly after applying the latest iTunes update, although not IMMEDIATELY after (a few hours, and only after rebooting my machine). This is what it looks like now (I have not changed any settings):\n\nIs there a way to make it appear normal again?\nEDIT:\nI have uninstalled, rebooted, and even tried removing all apple settings from my \"AppData\" directory. Nothing is helping so far.\n\nA: I don’t have a lot of Windows Expertise, but I assume that uninstalling Safari (and iTunes) and try installing them from scratch (after a nice reboot), might fix it.\n\nA: I'm not a Windows 7 user, but I'd guess Safari is inheriting these colours from your appearance settings in your control panel, especially if you've deleted AppData/reinstalled. \nHave a try playing with your Display Control Panel (especially the window appearance settings) to see if that fixes things, maybe Safari is using non-standard windows' colours for its bookmark background. \nWindows XP's Advanced Appearance Window:\n\n\nA: Its due the the color management profiles on various screens. A fix can be found at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/939395\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Start, type Color Management in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.\n\n*In the Color Management dialog box, click to select the Use my settings for this device check box.\n\n*In the Profiles associated with this device list, click the color profile that you want to remove, and then click Remove. \n\n*Note If you receive a warning message, click Yes.\n\n*Close the Color Management dialog box and then restart the computer to apply the setting.\n\n\nI also found if you just delete the other one, then re-add sRGB IEC61966 2.1, and set it as default, you don't even have to reboot and it just works. and it solved the same issue I was seeing in other Applications, but mostly Safari\n", "Q: Is it possible to upload files to a website from Safari on iPhone? I'm trying to upload a photo from my iPhone 4 to a website. However, the browse button to display the select file dialog is disabled. Normally this works fine on my Windows PC. Should I be able to select image files to upload from Safari on iPhone?\n\nA: Specifically the browse button is disabled because there isn't a file browser (like Windows Explorer/Finder) on the iPhone. Most people don't notice that, because the iOS is designed around avoiding the need for a user interface to the iPhone's file system.\nFor simplicity's sake file management is turned into a programing problem instead of a user problem. For security's sake applications can't directly access the documents of other applications.\nAs Jawa mention, a lot of sites have iPhone applications to allow uploads.\n\nA: No, uploading from mobile Safari is not possible. That's why about every other site that utilizes user uploads (e.g. Flickr, Facebook, Picasa) have either made their own upload app for the iPhone, or there are some apps that can handle many sites, such as Pixelpipe.\n\nA: As of iOS 6, Mobile Safari now supports file (image) uploads, from the Camera Roll, albums, and photostreams. Note that iOS 6 is only available for the iPhone 3GS and newer.\n\nA: You can't upload files using mobile Safari.\nEven though, you can either use iCab Mobile browser which support file upload or can use native iOS applications which are seamless integrated with a webspage.

Unfortunately, I spend most of my time in front of my computer, programming.  I'm kind of so-so on the web client for Rhapsody, and I particularly would like to be able to download songs to my Mac.  I don't have access to a (legally obtainable) copy of any version of Windows, so VirtualBox/Parallels/etc. is out.  Wine doesn't really work with the Windows Rhapsody client.  Has anyone else encountered and/or solved this problem?  Switching from Rhapsody to some other service isn't really an option either, since so far, at least, no other \"all-you-can-eat\" music service has an iPhone app with downloading allowed.\n\nA: Spotify has all that, but I’m not sure if you can use it in your country. Have you tried it?\nUPDATE I found out that you’re in the USA, and Spotify only works in a few European Countries… unless you’re a “Premium” user; the catch is that you need to create your account from within Europe.

I've made a movie project in iMovie 7, but it's taken 3GB of space on my hard drive and I am lacking space right now, so I need to move it out onto a external hard drive. \nHow can I do this?\n\nA: I’m not sure I understand you… you created a Movie Project in iMovie 7 (which if I’m not mistaken is the iLife ’08 version) and now you want to move it to an external drive?\nYou don’t mention your Mac OS X’s version but that shouldn’t really make much of a difference.\nOk should the above be correct, you have to locate your project in your hard drive. It will be probably located in your Movies folder. Assuming you have connected your external drive and the drive is ready to use (i.e. Partitioned and Formatted) for OS X, you simply have to open two Finder Windows (use CMD + N to open a new finder window).\nAfter you have the two Finder windows, navigate one to where you see the project in your /Movies folder. and in the other Finder, go to your external drive. \nClick in the iMovie project and Drag it to the other finder window (don’t release the mouse/trackpad button). When you reach your external drive, release it. \nIt will be copied, not moved. When the copy is over, simply drag the old one to the Trash. :)\nI’m sorry if this sounds too simple (or too complicated), the thing is that the nature of your question could be as simple as “how do I copy a file in OS X” or as complicated as “I got a new hard drive and I want to use it”.

I've tried it with an iTunes rental, with Netflix, and with a movie streamed from a computer. The results were poor each time. I switched back and forth between the Apple TV and the Mac Mini to confirm, and the image is indeed much sharper on the Mini. \nThe Apple TV is connected via HDMI to a Sony KLV-S32A10 32\" LCD with 1366x768 native resolution. \nIs this normal? \n\nA: The problem was with the TV settings - it has three \"Picture modes\": vivid, standard, and pro.

I just got my first Mac (a MacBook Pro) last Sunday and I am LOVING everything about it so far! But, I am a little confused about the folders in OS X.\nPlease go through the folders I should know about, and the folders I shouldn't worry about (or should stay away from). I have a little Linux knowledge to go off of, but things are still different enough that I'm disoriented.\nI'm running the latest, at this time of writing, version of OS X 10.6.5 Snow Leopard. But if any folders have changed over the past few versions, please note them! :)\n\nA: I’m going to resume them by memory, so future edits will probably fix all the mess I might type now. :)\nThe file structure of OS X resembles a typical Unix/Linux operating system (which in fact is the root of it all), albeit with some “Apple” differences. Some of those differences have aliases to keep the “unix” heart happy, but some are simply modified to be used as such. \nIn short here are the major “folders” in your file system:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Applications : This one is self explanatory, all your Mac’s apps should go there (unless you have an app that you want to be visible for only one user…). Normal users can read, “admins” can also drop things in there. \n\n*/Developer : if you install Xcode and the developer libraries, this folder will magically bring the unicorns for developing awesome Cocoa apps, iOS apps and dashboard widgets among other things. Otherwise the folder doesn’t even exist.\n\n*/Library : Shared libraries, and files necessary for OS X to actually function. Preferences, settings, app stuff, browser plug-ins (or more specifically, how to get rid of Adobe’s Flash) ;) You usually don’t tamper around here, but it’s normal if you want to clear some Apps settings, fix something, remove or install browser plugins, extensions, etc. Sometimes you will venture into /Library. Handle with care and always backup before breaking stuff here. It would be hard to destroy an OS X install by tampering /Library, but it’s possible…\n\n*/Network : All network libraries, servers, devices, etc. You shouldn’t be here unless you know what you’re doing and want to bypass GUI utilities. In almost 7 years of OS X, I’ve never touched this directory.\n\n*/System : Everything that OS X needs to properly function is here. I’d say that you shouldn’t touch anything or problems will arise. \n\n*/Users : This is the equivalent to Unix and Linux's /home directory. And here you will have sub directories for each of your users: /Users/John, /Users/Doe, etc. Inside your home folder you will have a “similar” structure. See later for more /Users’ love. \n\n*/Volumes: Mounted stuff/devices and volumes, real or virtual (think of CDs, DMGs, samba shares, etc), get their own “directory” here. So if you mount a smb share called MyShare, you can ‘cd /Volumes/MyShare’ to access it from the Command Line. The Finder will happily hide this from you (unless you set it to show invisible files I think).\n\n*/bin : What else can be said about bin that you don’t know already from your Linux knowledge. Same thing. If you install ‘git’ for example, it will go to /usr/local/git… so you get the idea. Obviously all the essential common binaries are here too. Think the command ‘ls’… it’s there, in all its glory.\n\n*/etc : Oh the great “etcetera”… Just like any other Unix, local system configs and… etcetera. It’s “similar” to any other unix, with some Apples. But the purpose is the same and some of the files (rc.local for example) exist. Go ahead and take a look, but if you break it, you have to pay for it. (OS X uses ‘launchd’ to launch stuff, so google for that if you want to -for example- start a subversion daemon at startup, forget all you knew about runlevels). Otherwise, get insurance between tweaking too much in there, because it’s not covered by Apple Stack’s Exchange damaging policy ;)\n\n*/dev : honoring it’s “unix” background, the device files representing peripherals are here. Who touches this anyway…\n\n*/usr : I googled for a good description of this and came up with a clever one: \n\n\n\n\"Second major hierarchy, includes\n  subdirectories that contain\n  information, configuration files, and\n  other essentials used by the operating\n  system”\n\n\n\n*/sbin : Also coming from the Unix nature of OS X, the system binaries, and administration utilities. These are not the droids you’re looking for, move along, move along. \n\n*/tmp : The one and only temp directory! Batteries not included. Note that this is not the “trash”. This is the real Unix temp. Unless you like being around waste, you shouldn’t have to wander around there. Cron jobs will keep it clean (tho it doesn’t hurt to restart your OS X every now and then). \n\n*/var : Var is for variable data. Logs, and stuff that will “vary” during the operating system operation. You rarely walk through these rapidly changing places, but sometimes you have to hunt for logs or errors. Bring and umbrella there, it changes very often…\n\n\nOk and what’s with this /Users thing?\nThe Users folder contains your ‘home’. You have easy to identify folders (i.e.: if you can’t identify what Music, Documents, Movies, Downloads, Desktop and Pictures are for, then the problem might lie elsewhere), but at the same time, there are notable “duplicates”. What? Yes. You have a Library and an Applications folder here too! \nI believe you’re already guessing what is all this about. Yes, all application settings that are for the user only will go in here (to ~/Library). That means that, although OS X will first look at /Library, if you install a (for example) browser plug-in in your ~/Library (instead of /Library), it will be found, but only by you. My ~/Applications folder is barely empty, it contains some Steam (games) in there, apparently they go there and not /Applications. (I just checked, i didn’t know that, so go figure how often I use my home’s App folder). \nupdate: Apparently this Application folder in your home directory doesn’t exist by default, but you can always create it and drop applications you want to keep for yourself. If you have no permissions to install stuff in /Applications, you can always use a private copy of an app in your ~/Applications folder.  \nThings not mentioned above that you might have\n\n\n*\n\n*/opt : (tional). As its name implies, it’s sometimes used by daemons as a place to store suff (but it’s usually optional, so you can put those things elsewhere). I remember that when running Subversion daemons, I had that directory and the repos would go to /opt/svn/repositories, but that was just me… never trust me.\n\n*/private : The best way to understand why we have this strange directory here, is to simply go ahead and read it from an expert (or read it directly from the question in Apple SE.): \n\n\n…and I quote: \n\n\"AIUI it's a holdover from NextStep\n  (which OS X is based on), and NextStep\n  did it to support NetBooting. The idea\n  was that you could boot from a\n  network-hosted volume (probably\n  read-only, and certainly shared with\n  other computers), and early in the\n  boot process mount a local (writable)\n  volume on /private; as g mentioned,\n  this allowed runtime-modification of\n  /var and /tmp, as well as per-computer\n  settings in /etc.\nThis isn't needed anymore, as Apple's\n  current NetBoot system uses a shadow\n  disk image to store changes anywhere\n  on the boot volume. But some\n  programs/docs/etc now assume the files\n  live under /private, so it'd be too\n  much trouble to switch them back…”\n\nSo there it is, this is more or less the OS X’s file hierarchy.

Will they then need to be reset to work in the future with each individuals computer/iTunes?\n\n*If the video is stored locally, I was thinking I would use oPlayer or VLC so that the file doesn't have to be synced via iTunes - it can just be stored within the iPad filesystem\n\nA: For reference, the iOS SDK (in case you decide to create a small application that plays the quicktime video), can only read stuff that is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Inside the Application’s bundle\n\n*the “temp” application’s user’s document directory (not shared between apps)\n\n*Use the APIs to read the user video/audio library. \n\n\nNumber 1 and 2 would require that you create an iOS app that includes the video as a resource (which will -depending upon the video’s size-, make it a huge app)\nAlso creating an APP and deploying it, requires an Enterprise Licensing from Apple (so you can deploy to your company iP/ads/ods/hones). So I don’t think thats a good (and cheap) idea.\nUsing option number three you could go with VLC or something but they would have to pick the video from a library. \nwhat would I do?\nI’d set up a wi-fi network, with a local webserver that hosts the page. Then create a webclip on the iPads. All hardcoded. The WebClip could point to a real webpage, but a DNS “forging” inside your closed network could point it locally while they are there. This way, when they leave, if they take the iPads with them, the link will continue to work when they regain internet, as the DNS will be correct and point to the “external” website. \nIf the network is “closed” you can set it up in advance. A good 11n router should handle that.\nNo syncing, no weird app, no need to tamper each individual’s ipods…\nAny catches?\n", "Q: \"Remove personal information\" default save in Office for Mac 2011?

I have one of the new mac mini's and run multiple users on it.  At any time up to 5 users may be logged in.  I have a keyboard and monitor that I connect to alot of machines so very often the mini has no monitor plugged in.  When I connect my monitor - Dell Monitor, VGA to HDMI adapter that came with mini - I get just a plain blue screen.

As a developer, I take a lot of screen captures. I often take screen shots to share with Stack Exchange members in chat.\nThe problem is my Desktop is so cluttered with screen captures that they're now overlapping! I'd like to save all screenshots in a dedicated folder or directory.\nIn macOS, how do I change the default location where screen captures are saved?\nThese are the screen shots taken with CommandShift3 or CommandShift4 keyboard shortcuts.\nI would prefer a solution which doesn't require installing any software.\n\nA: As of macOS 10.14+, you don't need any specific software or scripts. The default screenshot location can be changed in the Screenshot app UI:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter Screenshot mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Command+Shift+5\n\n*Press the Touchbar's Screenshot button\n\n\n*Go to the floating screenshots options window.\n\n*Select Options > Save to > Other Location...\n\n*Choose a new screenshot location.\n\n\n\nSelect \"Options\" here:\n\nNow all screenshots will be stored at the chosen location.\n\nA: According to this page...\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location <path>\n\nAlso, to turn on/off shadow:\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool true\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool false\n\nAnd to change file type:\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture type <format>\n\nYou'll want to\nkillall SystemUIServer\n\nto make the commands take effect.\n\nA: If you use TinkerTool you can change the location that screen capture will saved:\n\nAnd also you can Add control to the two shortcuts above to place the screen shot on the clipboard instead of saving it to the desktop., and paste it in image Editor like Acorn.\n\nA: I realize this question was asked years ago...\nNonetheless, I arrived here yesterday trying to fix the names (base filenames) of the screencapture PNG files.  \nLater I found the answer I needed, so I offer it here for future visitors.\nIf you hate the names looking like:\nScreen shot 2011-07-05 at 5.38.53 AM\n\nThen you can fix it in three steps:\nFirst, run:\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture name \"screenshot\"\n\nOr use any word you want as a replacement for the default \"Screen shot.\"\nThen (bust out your superuser/sudo privileges and) edit this file:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemUIServer.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/Localizable.strings\n\nIf your computer is not localized to use the \"English.lproj\", then locate the appropriate lproj in that same Resources folder.\nHere is what to edit in Localizable.strings:\n/* Format screencapture file names */\n/* \"%@ %@ at %@\" = \"%1$@ %2$@ at %3$@\"; */\n\"%@ %@ at %@\" = \"%1$@_%2$@_%3$@\";\n\nKeep the left-hand-side as \"%@ %@ at %@\" and alter the right-hand-side  (after the equals sign) to your liking.  In the above snippet, underscores are used where previously whitespace was used.\nLastly, of course:\nkillall SystemUIServer\n\nI found this info on this webpage, and it works for me on 10.6.\n\nA: Apple's answer:\n\nWhere to find screenshots\nBy default, screenshots save to your desktop with the name ”Screen Shot [date] at [time].png.”\nIn macOS Mojave or later, you can change the default location of saved screenshots from the Options menu in the Screenshot app. You can also drag the thumbnail to a folder or document.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361\n\n\nA: Use the screen shots from Preview. You can save to any place you like, change the screenshot's name or file type. It is under Previews File menu.\n", "Q: Where does Command-Shift-3 or Command-Shift-4 (for taking screen captures) originate from? I know that on Mac OS X, you can take a screen capture of the entire screen with Command+Shift+3 and you can take a screen capture of just a selection (or a window) with Command+Shift+4. Is there a rationale for this keyboard combination? What is the history of that command? Where does Command+Shift number originate from?\n\nA: \nWhat’s an FKEY?\nFKEY’s (Function Keys) are resources containing executable code that are called upon by hitting the keys Command-Shift-# (any number 0-9) at the same time. In the standard System file there are two FKEY’s; with an ID#3 and #4 that are used to dump the current screen or window onto disk or printer.1\n\n\nSo far as I can remember/find, screenshot commands were first added to the OS itself in System 6.2\n\n1 Text and image from FKEY that runs other FKEYs!   by John Holder (MacTech magazine, 1988)\n2 Further reading/references: Mel's Macintosh Universe: Macintosh Plus and a forum posting from 2003, How do I take a screen shot (the latter of which features some guy named Chealion).\n\nA: Dori's answer was correct, but I figured I'd add just a little more history. Early Mac Keyboards did not contact Function Keys (F1 through F12 etc). In place of Function Keys, they allowed the user to type Command+Shift+1 through Command+Shift+9.\nPrior to Mac OS X, the system software contained a \"Suitcase\" called \"System\". This was the heart of Mac OS classic, and contained the code necessary to boot and run the machine. However this code was not located in the data fork of the file, it was located in the proprietary Mac OS Resource Fork which is set up like a database -- every resource has a type, which is a four byte value, and an ID.\nPrior to Mac OS 9, all application code was in resources of type CODE. In the system suitcase, there was a special resource of type FKEY. These were essentially just CODE resources, with the exception that FKEY resources 0 - 9 would be executed when the corresponding Command+Shift+number key was pressed.\nIf I recall correctly, the Command+Shift+1 FKEY ejected the floppy and the Command+Shift+2 FKEY ejected the floppy in the second drive (external or of a two-floppy Mac (e.g. some SE/30s)). But there were software developers out there who made FKEYs. I remember as a kid having all the open FKEY \"slots\" filled. One let me draw freehand on the screen (my love for freehand circles started early :-) and one put the Mystery Science Theater 3000 characters at the bottom of my screen.\n\nA: Apple Technical Note OS01, dated \"Mar 01 1985\", describes the mechanism of command-shift-1 through command-shift-4.  Originally, 3 took a screenshot to disk, and 4 sent a screenshot directly to the printer.\nThey didn't all use FKEY.  1 and 2 were processed by GetNextEvent, but captured by the system.  3 and 4 used the FKEY defined in the System file.  5 through 9 were available for the user, via FKEY.  0 doesn't seem to have been supported.\nAccording to Wikipedia's table of release dates, this technote was written just before System 2.0 was released.  They also claim (without reference) that System 2 introduced this shortcut for screenshots.  Perhaps Apple wrote the technote prior to the actual release.\n", "Q: How can I unmount a drive every time I reboot? As relates to an answer to a previous question, I'd like to unmount a built-in hard drive every time I boot up. (Or alternately arrange for it not to be mounted). How do I do this?\n\nA: The following Hint on Mac OS X Hints details a way to do this. Basically you'll create (or modify) the file /etc/fstab and add a line similar to:\nUUID=F0E430C1-5558-3BB3-9FA9-6904B663FEEA  none  hfs  rw,noauto\n\nThe actual UUID will vary, you can find the UUID for your disk in system.log:\n\nIn Mac OS X Panther, Disk Utility and the diskutil command doesn't display the UUID value. But if you look in the system.log file, when the disk is mounted, you can see something similar to this (line breaks added for narrower display):\n … localhost diskarbitrationd[87]: disk1s9   hfs  \n   77F3E84D-E0ED-3194-96A5-BED10893FFF4  FireWire HD    \n   /Volumes/FireWire HD\n … localhost diskarbitrationd[87]: disk1s10  hfs  \n   F0E430C1-5558-3BB3-9FA9-6904B663FEEA  Mac OS X Disc \n   /Volumes/Mac OS X Disc\n\nThe string before the volume name is the UUID for the disk.\n\n\nA: Use a LaunchAgent (see Lingon) that runs at boot to unmount. If it runs too quickly, add a wait/pause/sleep. The action that unmounts can be in whatever you preferred scripting/automation language is (bash (hdiutil), Automator, AppleScript, etc.)\n", "Q: How do I enable the Java console in Firefox?

The MacBook Air has the magsafe and a USB port on one side of the chassis and the mini display and another USB port on the other side of the chassis.  Does the 3-port cable for the Cinema Display work, seeing as how the magsafe and the mini display are on opposite sides instead of all lined up like on the MacBook Pro?

I was riding in the car today and the as I was traveling home, decided to pull up maps on the iPod.  I know that GPS isn't used by iPod and uses wifi to triangulate it's position.  However I wasn't connected to any wifi as I was traveling through town and my iPod kept up with my position?  How?\n\nA: I'm guessing, since I couldn't find any confirmation, but the iPods use the Skyhook network, which is basically a big database of wifi access points and their approximate location. Since you wouldn't have been connected to a network, (here's the guess) the geolocation service must've cached some amount of the database for your general area.\n\nA: I don't think you have to have a WiFi connection for it to triangulate off of WiFi signals.  As long as you have WiFi turned on, the iPod can see the WiFi networks within range. It doesn't have to be connected to any of them.\nnote: the following is mostly speculation\nThe iPod has a WiFi receiver in it that's on all the time (unless you purposely turn it off).  The receiver is constantly listening for WiFi signals.  If you open your Settings and look at WiFi you'll see a list of WiFi access points that are within range.  Your iPod might not be connected to any of them but it knows their name (more importantly the unique SSID) and it knows how strong the signal is.\nThe iPod also stores a database of the locations of known SSIDs.  Then it does some fancy calculations.  So, if it knows that SSID A's signal is stronger than SSID B's signal it assumes you're closer to A.  With enough signals around you, it can make a pretty good approximation of your location. \nEven moving quickly, it can sense changes in signal strength as you move and recalculate your position.  In a town/city you'll likely have a lot of known signals.  Try driving out on a remote highway.  You'll likely lose any position information.\n", "Q: iOS apps take up more space than advertised? I would like to download \"RAGE HD\" which the App Store says is \"643 MB\", but after clicking \"BUY NOW\" there is a message:\n\nThere is not enough space to download \"RAGE HD\". Please delete some photos or videos.\n\nBut my \"About\" screen says I have \"898 MB\" available. How much extra space should I need to be able to download this game?\n\nA: You have to take into account that the exact number is an approximated value and that the device needs additional space to install the application. I’m guessing that although the application says it’s 643Mb, it really uses some more when it gets installed. You’re really pushing the limits of your iOS there :)\n\nA: Due to the way items are synced to the iPod and iPhone, you need a bit more space than the size of the app. So although the app may only take up 643MB, you'll actually need more to sync it.\n\nA: I don't know the answer to your question in general, but as far as RAGE HD goes (all numbers on my Mac):\nSize shown in Finder: 779.7 MB\nSize shown in iTunes (Library > Apps): 743.6 MB\nSize needed to install on my iPad (Devices > my iPad > Apps): 1.18 GB\n                                           I think that's your answer, there   ↑\n", "Q: User defined menu shortcut doesn't work with Safari I want to add a shortcut to \"refresh\" the web page in Safari (5.0.2).\nI added a shortcut definition in the System Preferences.\n\n\n\nI disabled the usage of the Fonction keys by the System.\nI have \"F5\" shown next to \"Reload Page\" menu item. But, this does not work. \nWhat went wrong ?\n\nA: As other commenters have said, it works once the menu has been shown at least once. Safari seems to build its menus differently from other apps, and seems to do it dynamically when you open them the first time. Hence, the system has no way to know that such a Refresh menu item exists unless you've tried opening the menu once.\n", "Q: How to disable all notifications in MS Office 2008, Entourage? The subject says it all, but for further explanation, MS Office has this (what I consider annoying feature) of notifying me of pretty much anything that happens in Entourage—emails, calendar events, and the like. This is similar to the new \"My Day\" feature but the notifications pop-up in the lower-right corner of the screen.\nI use one particular installation for developing scripts and I don't need to notifications. I don't even need Entourage, for that matter, but the install is managed by my IT department, not me. I've looked through everything I can think of to turn off all of the notifications, and the only way I have managed to completely stop them is to zip up the Entourage application. But that results in every other application in the Office suite to state on start up that there is a problem with the Office database (but then they work normally otherwise) and the update application won't allow updates to happen because it can't find the correct installation.\nDoes anyone know of a way to completely turn off all the little pop-up notifications that Entourage seems to foist on me?\n\nA: If you remove the Microsoft Database daemon from login and do not open Entourage you should receive no notifications.\n", "Q: Is adding a GPS cradle to the iPod touch worthwhile? I am looking for a GPS that will guide me on hikes and travel from point A to point B without loss of signal in remote areas.  I have found this accessory for the iPod touch that enables GPS location services.  I am looking for other users EXPERIENCE (not opinions) of this accessory and their personal thoughts on using it or other solutions that I can use my iPod as a location/directional device.  \nMy iPod touch is a 3rd gen, however I feel that this is something that would be desired for all gen's (at least for the 4th as well)\n\nA: No info to report on the cradle you linked to, but several Bluetooth models work fairly well. Apple apps work the best but some third party mapping apps don't use the GPS as well as the onboard one for the iPhone. Others resist installing as the developers require iPhone or iPad with GPS to install. \nIt would be best to contact the developer of your mapping app of choice and see what they recommend. \nhttp://www.gns-gmbh.com/ - tested that for a day so it worked but I can't recommend it for the field without more time with it.\nXGPS 150 - this worked well but I ultimately sold it since I don't want a short days GPS but a whole weekend to a week so I'm back using my garmin that is all in one and takes AA batteries. \n", "Q: Does the iPhone support the camera connection kit in 4.2? I know that the camera connection kit accessory has so far only worked on the iPad. I assume that this is the case because the iPad was running a special version of iOS 3, but seeing as iOS 4.2 is now in GM for both iPhone and iPad, I'm wondering if Apple has extended support for this accessory to the iPhone as well.\n\nA: You can use the CCK to export photos off an iPhone and import them to the iPad (which isn't new), but no one has yet been able to get the CCK to hook an iPhone up to anything else.\n\nA: They are already working on the iPhone 4 (but only on the iPhone 4, not on previous models) as of iOS 4.0. I guess they are also compatible with the iPod touch 4G.\n", "Q: How to stop an iPhone 3G from using cell data, ever? My wife has inherited my iPhone 3G and it's using a few megabytes of GPRS data every month even though she doesn't deliberately use any services that cost mobile data. The problem is that she doesn't have a data plan, so these few MB's cost as much as a few gigabytes would with a data plan. \n1: How can I set up the iPhone 3G (OS 3.1.3) so that it absolutely never sends or receives any data except on wifi?\n2: Also, what is sending/receiving this GPRS data if it isn't the user? My wife never launches the web browser or other Internet-needing apps.\nPlease don't simply suggest the obvious get a data plan because my wife doesn't want one. She wants to use the thing as a cell phone and for text messaging, but certainly absolutely positively no Internet or e-mail or whatever, except when she's on our home's wifi.\nI thought I had thoroughly turned off mobile data. Here's what I've done so far (written from my memory, might be inaccurate):\nSettings > General > Network:\n- enable 3G = off\n- cellular data = off\n- data roaming = off\nSBsettings:\n- 3G = off\n- data = off\n- bluetooth = off\n- location = off\nBased on all this, the damn thing should only use wifi, but somehow it uses GPRS data anyway. Argh!\nSolution:\nWell, I didn't manage to turn off the mobile data usage despite all your very useful and helpful suggestions. Instead, I spoke with the provider and they offered me 8 months of 1GB-per-months for free, and after that I'm free to cancel it or continue at €7 per month (or whatever the rate will be at that time). They also gave me the money back for the data costs on the last bill. Very good customer service, thank you tele.ring of Austria.\n\nA: That's pretty bizarre. This should have done it:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*enable 3G = off\n  \n*cellular data = off\n  \n*data roaming = off\n  \n\nThe only thing I can think of is perhaps visual voicemail? If you have this turned on and it's working then it's using data. Try turning it off. If not, then I'm not really sure what the problem could be, but I suggest calling up your carrier and asking them to block data on their end so that you don't get charged for it.\n\nA: It is possible to have a voice-only no-data iPhone.\nBe careful about trying to set this up yourself on the phone. Phones have been known to use data (and get charged) even when all phone options have been set to not use data.\nYour best bet is to call the carrier and ask them to disable all data from their end.\n\nA: Changing the APN (if you have access to those settings, AFAIK some carriers block that specific menu) to some random set of chars (fake APN) will disable all data communications. However, everytime you try to access internet, the iPhone will pop up a message saying that you are not subscribed to a cellular data service.\nYou can also change it to a fake one even if your carrier disallowed access to that setting, by visiting http://www.unlockit.co.nz/ using your iPhone and letting it install the fake settings for you.\n\nA: I can add a few things that bothered me when I did the same.\n\n\n*\n\n*I had to go to the network settings of the carrier and remove the user/pass for the “EDGE” network. Inserting bogus information prevented the iPhone from connecting at all.\n\n*Voicemail. Here in spain we have visual voicemail (and so do other EU countries as well). I disabled the voicemail too (there is a ## command you can type, ask in your company). \nDespite having everything disabled, the phone, notably mail, tried to do things, but after #1, it started failing (giving me an annoying popup that it couldn’t connect). So I went ahead and obliterated Mail settings, and such. \nSince then it has been silent. ;)\n\nA: You can switch mobile data off in Settings.  \nGo to Settings > General > Network and set the Mobile/Cellular Data switch to the 'Off' position\nSee this Apple Support note for exactly what turning off Cellular Data affects.\n\nA: Actually there's one thing you can do, and that's mess up with carrier settings. APN is the keyword here. Under Settings / General / Network you should have a menu Cellular Data. If you don't (and you probably do not) have it, search for APN on cydia. You should find something there to enable it. Then just clear up all fields in that menu.\nAnother option would be going to www.iphone-notes.de/mobileconfig or other similar websites on your iphone and install a invalid carrier setting. I'm not sure this would do the trick, but with the proper custom .mobileconfig I'm sure you could.\nGood luck! ;)\n\nA: In my country (Australia) we are able to ask the mobile provider to disable data on our accounts to ensure we cannot use any at all, and thus cannot be charged for it unwillingly. It might be worth calling up the provider and asking if they can disable the data service.\n\nA: If your wife hast set up an email account: are the \"fetch\" settings set to \"manual\"?\n\nA: Try turning off location services and see if it helps. If I remember correctly, the iPhone 3G has assisted GPS, so it might be using a data connection to help with satellite acquisition.\n\n\"Standalone\" or \"Autonomous\" GPS operation use radio signals from satellites alone. A-GPS additionally uses network resources to locate and utilize the satellites faster as well as better in poor signal conditions. [...] An Assisted GPS system can address these problems by using data available from a network.\n\n\nA: You could call your carrier and tell them to block all data from the SIM card.\n\nA: Put it in Airplane mode! Works for me.\n", "Q: Spaces makes dialogs disappear I'll be working in a space, and then something starts bouncing in the dock (like Mail), so I switch to that space, and I see a dialog for a split second, but then it disappears.  I try moving the main window, to see if the dialog went behind it or something, but it isn't there.  While I can move the main window, I cannot interact with it because the dialog is modal.  If I switch to a different space then I see the dialog again for just a split second.\nEventually if I switch spaces enough times the dialog will stop disappearing.  I haven't found any pattern that works reliably.  Another solution is to disable spaces, close the dialog, and then enable spaces and move everything back to the correct windows again.\nIt is rather annoying.  It happens with multiple applications too.  I've tried selecting the application by clicking on it in the dock, or switching to the space, and I get the same behavior.  \nThe question is: Is there an easy way to get to the dialog box, or to keep spaces from doing this?  Thanks!\n\nA: A bit better of a workaround is to hide the app with the dialog, then showing it again. That typically puts the dialog on top of the z axis, I noticed. Still annoying. The OS-X window manager is the worst PoS I've ever worked with. And just because Steve \"believes\" in the 1983 Mac window policy...\n\nA: I've reported this bug at the Genius Bar at my local apple store, where I was told it was a known issue, to which they had no good solutions. I wish they would fix it. :(\nThe best I've come up with so far, and it's risky, is to use apple script to tell the application in question to quit. That causes another modal dialog to pop up, and when I dismiss that one, the one that first came up shows up next. The risk is that the app will just quit. (It might also just ignore it... results seem to vary by application.)\nTo tell an application to quit via Apple script do this from a terminal window on the same space as the application:\n  osascript -e \"tell Application \\\"NameHere\\\" to quit\"\n\n", "Q: How can I make VLC output its sound through USB headphones? Whenever I plug-in my earphones with a round connection into my MacBook Pro, the sound automatically switches to them. Whenever I plug my headphones with a USB connection (Logitech USB ClearChat Comfort Headset) and I am playing sound in iTunes, the sound automatically switches. Whenever I plug in my headphones and VLC is playing, the sound continues to play through the speakers. Is there any way to make VLC work with my USB headphones?\nUpdate: It seems that the headphones don't work properly with Skype either.\n\nA: VLC can't switch audio interfaces on-the-fly. You either have to stop playing media entirely, and go into the preferences and change it, then start playing your media again; or, the slightly easier way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kill VLC\n\n*Plug in headphones (and ensure they become the primary output sound device, hold option and click the sound icon in your menu bar, select usb headphones if necessary)\n\n*Start VLC\n\n\nAssuming VLCs preferences are still set to use the Default Audio Device for output, then it'll use them when you start playing content again.\n\nA: Ask and you shall receive...\nI logged this as a bug on VLC and they delivered within 2hrs!\nhttps://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ticket/9231\n\nA: Since you're getting iTunes and system sounds through the headset, it should be set as the default audio device, but check the the Sound  Preferences pane to make sure.  After this, try restarting VLC to get it to use the new default audio device.  This should also work for Skype, however Skype should have options in the preferences menu that will let you choose the audio output/input device.  Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any similar option in VLC.\n\nA: Exiting VLC player, and then changing the default Sound Output to Logitech USB Speakers worked for me.  So long as the Logitech speakers are plugged in before you open VLC player and System preferences are set correctly then VLC should play through the Speakers.\nI know a lot of people use VLC player instead of Quicktime, because some Windows files don't play sound on Quicktime, but work perfectly on VLC player.  Although this may have changed since Snow Leopard and the latest version of Quicktime.\nHope this helps.\nToria\n\nA: Hmm, I can switch audio devices in VLC on the fly without problems: \n\nIt defaults to the device defined in the system settings on startup.\n\nA: I've just solved the problem like this (without killing the app): I went into the Bluetooth settings (long click on the main icon in the main settings of my smartphone) and saw that \"Media audio - Connected to media audio\" was checked. I unchecked it, checked again, and yey, the sound is coming from the loudspeaker, finally :) I hope I won't have to do this every time though :/ \n", "Q: Decreasing Image Size with Minimal Quality Loss? I have a few scanned in images of some some pages that I need to digitise. They're each roughly around 5.1MB with 600 DPI, but I can't really afford to have scans so large because I only have around 16GB to last for another 7 months. \nI want to decrease the image size but I need to have minimal quality loss of the image. Can this be done?\n\nA: Just use Preview, and select Adjust Size from the Tools menu.\n\nA: Are you referring to the dimensions of the image (ex. 400px x 600px) or the size of the file?\nSome image formats use smaller file sizes just because it's in the nature of the format. For example, PSDs tend to be larger then PNGs, etc. I personally use the PNG format for my images, since the images still look nice without being too bulky in size.\nA good tool for resizing images or converting them to different types is Image Tool (http://mac-free.com/download/Image-Tool.html) and it's free as well.

On the iPhone I can speed up the playback of podcasts to 2x.\nIs there a way to do the same in iTunes?  \n\nA: There is a Mac menubar app, that allows you to change the playback speed in iTunes. http://wetfish.de/\n\nA: This is not natively possible in the Mac version of iTunes (nor Windows for the matter). You don’t mention if you have OS X or Windows. If you have the former, you have two choices: \n1) If the podcast is an MP3 file, you can convert the file to an AAC file in iTunes (with an extension of m4a.) and then change the extension to m4b; the file becomes an audiobook which can be played faster if I am not mistaken.\n2) Another alternative is to hear it in Quicktime, which has speed controls: Right click the file in iTunes and choose \"Show In Finder”. Option-click the file (right click) and select “Open With…”, select QuickTime. Once in Quicktime option-click the \"Accelerate\" button to change the playback speed.\n\n\nA: The way I did it was (windows 7 not sure how it would work on mac) copy and paste the podcast from itunes into my doccuments and then open the podcast in VLC (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html) i assume there is a download for Mac as well. VLC has speed controls and plays every type of file as far as im aware. Under the playback options it has a speed setting. \nNB VLC also good for vidoes with out of sync A/V as has sync settings. \n\nA: You can use Winamp or Windows Media Player and the Chronotron plugin to change tempo or pitch.\n\nA: Soundforge nits free and it will change tempo without changing pitch. It works well. \n", "Q: \"not supported on this architecture\" error (git) I'm trying to install the Gitx Git client on my friend's mac and it seems to install fine but when I run it I get the following error:  \nYou cannot open the application \"GitXStable\" because it is not supported on this architecture.\nIdeas?\n\nA: Intel application on a PowerPC Mac.

Rather than boring you with the details, let’s just say that in order for your “EFI” to find your Ubuntu partition, you have to perform some magic. \nThe instructions for doing that are everywhere, (for example: here). I believe that you need to install rEFIt in order to have an “EFI” compatible bootloader. \nTL;DR version: A Mac won’t boot directly into another operating system’s boot (GRUB/LILO/WINLOADER/ETC), you need an “EFI” compatible loader (enter rEFIt).\nI hope this points you into the right direction.\n", "Q: Why does Microsoft Messenger 8.0 crash when I open a new chat window?

This could be related to two main things:\n\n\n*\n\n*A bug in the program. The Mac programming framework (Called Cocoa) and the programming language used to develop most Mac programs (Objective-C) are very tricky with memory handling. A simple mistake could lead to unpredictable and unexpected crashes that seem to follow no “pattern”. It’s very common, it happens in the best software shops and until the vendor fixes the memory leak, there is nothing you can do (other than send them the bug report and pray).\n\n*If this behavior is exhibited by more software, there might be a problem with your hardware memory (RAM). Faulty RAM sticks are know to have caused this type of errors in a more or less unpredictable way. Programs start crashing and with time, new ‘problems’ arise, until the machine might eventually become almost unusable.\nWhat can you do?\nA simple test may be conducted by creating a new blank user in your computer, restarting your computer and using Messenger from the new user. This will rule any possible software problem with your user. If Messenger works fine under the new account, then further analysis of yours will lead us to try to find what’s interfering with MSN.\nIf it fails to work under the new account too, then the problem lies either in the MSN, Your OS X in general (weird but possible, usually a new user fixes 90% of the problems), or, worst case scenario, in your Hardware. \nI suggest you try to above and take an action course. As a last resort, don’t hesitate taking the machine to an Apple Store/Genius Bar for further analysis.

I added restrictions to my iPad and I forgot the passcode for them, now what? Is there a way to remove it without resetting the device?\n\nA: The short answer is no. \nThe long answer is wipe the device and then start over. If you have a backup, hopefully it's from before the restrictions were set.\n\nA: There's a tool that can recover the restrictions passcode from a device backup, called pinfinder.

I'll bypass a lot of stuff and cut right to the chase:\nThe party is over with regard to malware, trojans and the like.  Paging through the last security update, there were some vulns that were from the summer although the cure only came last week.  Redownload the developer tools, recompile your macports install, and you have a functioning toolchain that is not dependent on Cupertino, since the Dev Tools from your install disk will serve.  Who uses an old version of Openssh?  Now it does take some care and feeding, like running port selfupdate every day, and the big tip is to check \nport variants \n\nso if you have a python dependency, you can run \nport install python +no_tkinter \n\nand avoid the agonizingly long Tk install, which would be most unwelcome on a Quartz architecture anyway.\nWith this, you can freely run software update and not have your stuff break, since it does not depend on anything but the compiler from apple.  I've used it for a long time, and although I tried some others, namely Homebrew, I think that depending on apples versions means inheriting their security flaws.

I would like to create a PDF document with images, text and table of contents.\nI have also other PDF documents that I would like to merge in this new PDF.\nDo you know some tools/software for creating PDFs?\n\nA: You can actually merge multiple PDFs right from Preview.app. Just open two PDFs in two separate windows, turn on the sidebars, and drag pages from one sidebar to the other. This won't provide you with a table of contents, but you can always just make something in TextEdit, export it as a PDF, then add it to the beginning of the document.\n\nA: I use Adobe InDesign for this kind of thing... more flexible than AcrobatPro. Allows total control over what you import into the pdf (text,images, other pdfs, etc.) and the ability to create clickable TOCs.

On my iPhone headset (the one that came with the device, as well as the in-ear buds) there's a little piece of plastic that slides on the cable to one earbud, and can clip onto the other cable. \n\n\n*\n\n*It's not large enough to accommodate the headset cable below the split, so it can't be used to somehow hold the cable in place when it's curled up. \n\n*It's not tight enough to stay in place if I slide it nearer the earbud, so it can't be used to essentially move the point where the cable splits closer to the earbuds.\n\n*It's not tight enough to really hold on to the other earbud cable. It takes nearly no effort at all to pull the cables apart.\n\n\nWhat in the world is it good for?!? \n\nA: It's good for avoiding tangles when you're not using your earbuds, or when you are using them, from preventing you from tearing your earbuds. (When you're jogging or whatever.) That extra clip is the first thing to give when you pull them apart. If that wasn't there, the next thing to pull would be the splitter.

I wish I could get a new Finder window launched if I double-click the Finder icon in the dock. I'm not sure if this would be possible with an Automator script, or if I would have to try to program some type menubar software or something. Any ideas?\nthanks!!\n\nA: Hyperdock will let you do something similar. It doesn't seem to support double clicking, but I have my system set up so a middle-click on the finder icon opens a new window.\nIt's also an awesome dock enhancement, and brings the dock much closer to the usability of the windows taskbar (i.e. you can switch to a specific other window without having to use expose or alt-tab). \n\nA: The following AppleScript does what you want:\non run\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        make new Finder window\n        activate\n    end tell\nend run\n\nOpen Script Editor in the /Applications/AppleScript folder, and paste the above in to a new script. Save it somewhere as a \"File Format: Application\" with \"Stay Open\" not checked.\n\nThen drag that application to your Dock. When you click it, the Finder will be brought to the front and with a new finder window.\nThe disadvantage is, this takes about 1.5 - 2 seconds to run on my machine. I could probably tweak it by making the script stay open and watch for being brought to the front... You might also get better performance by saving it as a normal script in your \"Scripts\" folder and putting it in the scripts menu.\n\nA: All you're trying to do is open a new Finder window, yes?\n\nWhy not just right-click on the Finder icon in the Dock and choose \"New Finder Window\"?\n", "Q: Looking for a good iPhone photo viewer I'm looking for a photo viewer that would sync with multiple (sub)folders on my computer HD (some of which are not in my MyPhoto folder), and would have a feature to do a slideshow on the iPhone.\n\nA: Have you considered Dropbox?   \nIt allows for any folder structure you like, and has a decent photo viewing and slideshow capability.

I've found out that if I install Windows 7 and use the Snow Leopard Boot Camp drivers (Which I need for the graphics chipset drivers.), the Mac partition appears and is read-only. I'm quite concerned about this, because if my Windows partition is infected with malware, it could be a possibility that the hackers could take data from my Mac partition, even if it was read-only.\nIs there any way to turn off Mac partition support while booted in Windows?\n\nA: I'm not a windows guy, so the steps are probably different but this SuperUser question asks how to disable a partition under Windows XP. The steps may be similar under Windows 7:\n\nYou could remove the drive letter\n  assignment for the specific\n  partition(s):\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Go to Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Computer\n  Management\n  \n*Expand Computer Management (Local) > Storage > Disk Management\n  \n*Right click the specific partition you like to hide and select \"Change\n  Drive Letter and Paths\"\n  \n*Select the drive letter shown, click \"Remove\" and click \"OK\"\n  \n\n\nA: From a theoretical standpoint, even if you delete the Boot Camp drivers and/or remove the drive letter, a virus could still interface with the disk at very low level and read your data. From a practical standpoint, this is unlikely to happen as there is much more low-hanging fruit for hackers.\nStill, if you want to run Windows on your Mac without the possibility, even theoretical, of the compromised Windows system being able to access your Mac data, you have essentially two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Windows in a VM and only allow it access to its virtual disk\n\n*Turn FileVault on for your user account\n\n\nFor the latter option the theoretical virus could still access your applications and general system settings, but it would not be able to access any user data without the FileVault password.\n\nA: Remove the following keys from the Windows Registry (backup first) to disable the Apple HFS driver:\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\AppleHFS]\n\"Type\"=dword:00000002\n\"ErrorControl\"=dword:00000001\n\"Start\"=dword:00000000\n\"Group\"=\"File System\"\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\AppleMNT]\n\"Type\"=dword:00000002\n\"ErrorControl\"=dword:00000001\n\"Start\"=dword:00000000\n\"Group\"=\"File System\"\n\nYou can use the same registry fragment above to restore HFS functionality if you forgot to backup your registry before making any changes.\n\nA: I’m sure someone with more Windows experience will provide a better alternative here, because if that is possible, it’s only possible through a Windows setting/hack/etc. I’m sure you can find the HFS+ driver and uninstall it from windows… but I don’t use bootcamp. :(\n\nA: In Windows, you can go into Disk Management and choose \"Change Drive Letter and Paths...\" and then Remove the existing drive letter.

I like how in Finder, they only have 3 columns of files before the files wrap to a new row. However, when I lend out my USB to some friends, they don't have \"Snap to Grid\" enabled, which causes them to \"add\" in the 4th column, which messes up the view of the USB. Every time this happens, I have to manually drag everything back. This is quite time consuming and fine if I only have to do this once. However, I lend out my USB multiple times every week. It's quite a headache.\nIs there a way to force Finder to constrain the columns of files to only 3 columns?\n\nA: The setting your refer to, is stored in a hidden Finder file called .DS_STORE\nThis file is obviously overwritten by your friend’s Mac who obviously uses different settings. \nAs far as I know, there’s no way (other than perhaps making the file .DS_STORE read only in the USB so your friend’s Mac cannot write the “new annoying settings” to it). \nYou’ll need to jump into the Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)\nConnect your USB Drive, open Terminal.\nIn Terminal, type:\ncd /Volumes\nls \n\nYou should see your own Macintosh HD (or whatever name your internal drive(s) have) and the USB drive (with the name it might have).\nCd into the USB drive like:\ncd MyUSBDrive\n\nif the drive has spaces in its name, you must enclose it between quotes\nFor example: \ncd “My Strange USB”\n\nOnce in there, you can perform an ‘ls’ to view the contents of the USB. Do that to make sure it’s the right one. Else go back to cd  /Volumes and start over :)\nNow adjust the settings in the finder the way you want them.\nDone?\nNow to change the permissions in the USB drive: \nsudo chmod 444 .DS_Store\n\nNOTE: The above command might ask you for your password, that is ok. The password won’t be seen when you type it. Just type your password and press enter. Remember the commands in Terminal are case sensitive. \nWhat does that do?: chmod is a command that changes the permissions of files and/or directories. In this case, since the file is a hidden file from the finder, we have to do the job from the terminal (which can always see hidden things). The numbers (444) are read only for everybody. \nIf you don’t know what chmod does or how it works (or why 444) I recommend you take a look at the help (man page) for the command. In Terminal type:\nman chmod\n\nWill this work?\nTo be honest, I don’t know. I believe it will, but I’m not sure if ACLs are preserved in USB devices. If the USB is formatted with FAT32  (they usually are so Windows can read/write) the above might not work. \nOther than that, there’s no magical way to tell finder do this, and do it this way. Because if there’s a .DS_Store file, Finder will read settings from there. \n", "Q: Why 3G Consume More Battery than Wifi? From what I can recall, both 3G and Wifi should consume about the same about of battery when in operation. However, my field testing seems to indicate that 3G is more battery consuming than Wifi. \nIs this result general? If yes, why this is so?\n\nA: First of all, all wireless systems use the most power when transmitting, ie actively powering the antenna to upload data.\nNow, just think of the ranges the different systems have to bridge. WiFi works well for like 30 meters, or 100 meters outdoors. Usually, the nearest cell tower is considerably farther away than those 100 meters, therefore, 3G needs more power than WiFi.\nAdd to this that 3G is capable of opening multiple connections at once, and the fact that 3G autmatically boosts power output on weak signals, 3G needs more power.\n\nA: RotHorseKid is mostly right, however it's not quite as simple as distance — the operating frequency and bandwidth also affect the power usage.\nThe wikipedia page on dBm provides some approximate power levels for various transmitters, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Maximum output from a UMTS/3G mobile phone as anywhere from 125 mW to 2 W (for various power classes — I'm not sure where the iPhone 4 fits, nor any of the iPhones)\n\n*Typical laptop wifi transmission power of 32 mW (and I'm fairly sure the iPhones are below most laptops) with a maximum allowable power of 200 mW\n\n*Bluetooth output is 1.3 mW, 2.5 mW or 100 mW depending on range (1m, 10m 100m)\n\n\nNow it's not quite that simple, since the transmitters won't be 100% efficient, and there's associated electronics required for the communications to work (on top of the EM transmissions). Such electronics tend to use more power when they run at higher frequencies, and higher potential bandwidth will require a higher frequency (i.e. the supporting electronics of wifi probably uses more power than the supporting electronics of 3G, which in turn probably uses more power than the supporting electronics of Bluetooth).\nAt a guess, I'd say the supporting electronics would use between 10-100 mW (perhaps someone knows the actual comms chips and can provide specs?), so depending on the power class of the iPhone, it'd be comparable, but I'd still expect 3G to use significantly more power than wifi (and, anecdotally, my iPhone gets hotter when using 3G compared to wifi, which backs this up too).\n", "Q: How can I change the VoiceOver language for a song on my 6th gen iPod Nano?

I have an iPhone 4, an iPad, and an iPhone 3G repurposed as a \"touch\" for a little one. The short of it is, there are apps I have on my iPhone 4 that I don't want on my iPad, and some on the old 3G that I don't want on either. What's one to do?\nI've tried managing by hand which apps sync on which device, but this information gets lost periodically, which means a huge app dump across the iPad and iPhone 4.\nWhat would seem most effective is, while the \"purchased\" app pool would be common, each device would have a derived subset of this pool (so they wouldn't have to re-purchase), and so would/could never inadvertently sync apps from another device pool.\nI suppose the checkboxing of each app approximates this, but it's very frustrating when this information is lost.\nAny help for this? Thanks!\n\nA: You can uncheck \"Automatically sync new apps\" in iTunes. This will avoid the situation where iPhone apps that you don't want to use on your iPad wind up getting synced over. Other than that, the only current solution is to manually check off each app you want on each device.\n\nA: The real question would seem to be - how does that information get lost?  I sync between three devices, an iPhone, iPad, and Touch also - I've not had it lose track of which apps were on which system.  How does that happen?\n", "Q: Is iOS 4.2 faster than 4.1 (iPod Touch)?

I have an iPod Touch 4gen and I'm wondering if I'll see any difference.\nThere's no features of iOS 4.2 that interest me, so I wouldn't bother with the upgrade, but if it also gave me improved performance, I might.\nThanks!\n\nA: Having used 4.2 GM on my iPhone 4 for a couple of weeks now I personally find it much much better at managing and minimising memory usage (regular checks using iStat).

Does upgrading iOS change my IMEI? I was told not by AT&T not to remove my SIM card or certain restrictions that they had placed on the iPhone, at my request, would be lifted. I want to know if upgrading my iOS is like removing the SIM card. I think this was because the IMEI number changes when the SIM card is removed from the phone.\nDoes upgrading iOS change this number?\n\nA: The IMEI is kind of like a MAC address for the cellular network only. It is nearly impossible to change it, you can only spoof it on a software level. So the answer is, No, your IMEI will never change unless you really really want it to. Removing the SIM card shouldn't change the IMEI either...\n\nA: The IMEI shouldn’t change when you upgrade the phone, at least here in Europe. Mine is still the same. \nUpdate: Upon some reading around, it turns out that if you “hack” your phone, (maybe in the past), an update would change some IMEIs, and AT&T would therefore invalidate the SIM. Be careful with what you do :)\n\nA: No, upgrading the OS doesnt change the IMEI by default, there are hacks available to do it, but its illegal and hence, not recommended. \n\nA: No. Upgrading iOS won't change the IMEI of your iPhone.\n", "Q: Does iOS 4.2 improve performance on the iPhone 3G?

Performance even on older\n  devices such as the iPhone 3G is the\n  same as iOS 4.1 and thus far we\n  haven’t observed any significant\n  changes in battery life.\n\n\nA: It actually seems faster than 4.1 to me on my 3G.\n\nA: My iPhone 3G has become slower in some occasions with iOS 4.2 especially when pasting an address from Mail to Maps.\n\nA: I have an iPhone 3G that I use for testing. 4.2.1 seems insanely slow on it, but maybe that's just because I've gotten so used to the speed of the 3GS and iPhone 4 over the past two years and forget what the \"normal\" speed of a 3G should feel like.\n\nA: IOS4.2.1 is better than 4.1 for sure!!! I did not use yet the 3gs nor the iphone4, and got through every iOS \"upgrade\" available starting 3.1.3 , 4.0 , 4.0.1, 4.1 and probably yhe last one for the 3G 4.2.1 ! almost as fast as the 3.1.3 ,and with all the advantages of the 4.x ( folders, ibooks, faster maps, faster jawa, geo-tagging new caracters for notes, easier copy paste ((i think...)), etc. deffinatley a good option to upgrade! you will not be sorry!!!\n\nA: My wife's 3GS which has 3.1.3 runs much faster than my 3GS with 4.3.5(BL1). However I cannot backup her unit in newly purchased MacBook Pro with Lion, but I can backup mine. I see it as Apple's way to force us to upgrade to their latest iOS even if that means to sacrifice performance. I don't like that at all, therefore I chose to backup 3.1.3 to a WinXP machine.\n", "Q: Concisely starting Mac OS apps from the command line I do a fair amount of work in the command line, and I find myself defining a lot of aliases of the form:\nalias skim='/Applications/Skim.app/Contents/MacOS/Skim'\n\nIs there a way to add magic such that asking for executable \"foo\" automatically uses executable /Applications/Foo.app/Contents/MacOS/Foo? This is on OS X 10.6.\n(I'm aware that I could do open foo.pdf, but Skim is not the default PDF reader, and I'd like a general solution - in some cases, it's not appropriate to set the application in question as the default handler for the file.)\n\nA: You don't need anything fancy, you already have the answer.  Try:\nopen /Applications/Foo.app bar.pdf\non edit\nIn light of the comments below, I think my answer would still be relatively similar... I would make a function that overrides open, does a pushd to /Applications, calls /usr/bin/open $appName.app $args, does a popd and returns.\nI suck at shell scripting but something like below which covers special cases and keeps you using pretty much the same syntax as apple provided for open.  I like to keep my environment as clean as possible.\nI'm sure the syntax is from outer space:\nfunction open($appName, $args)\n{\n    #if we are calling open without a path like /Applications/TextEdit.app AND\n    #    $appName ends in '.app'\n    if (!hasParent($appName) && isApp($appName))\n    {\n        pushd /Applications\n        /usr/bin/open ${appName}.app $args &\n        popd\n        return\n    }\n    #otherwise, use open as normal\n    /usr/bin/open $appName $args\n    return\n}\n\non second edit\nlooking @mankoff's comment on the original question, most of the stuff in the above function would probably be a waste of time since you could just use open -a $appName.  So mankoff probably has the easiest solution and should change his comment to an answer ;)\n\nA: There are two solutions that I can think of:\nThe easier way - Using the Info.plist file in each .app Contents directory, create an index of the value for the keys CFBundleExecutable.  Then add a short alias that calls a script (perl, python, whatever) with the name of an executable and the arguments you'd like to pass.  \nYour index would be pairs of executable names and paths to those executables.  You'd have to write a recurring scheduled script to keep this updated.\nYou'd end up being able to call:\nf foo file.txt\n\nwhere f is an alias to a script that checks your index for an executable named foo.\nAll in all, not a lot of work to get the functionality you'd like.\nThe harder way - Extend your shell to supplement the handling of its command_not_found error.  Essentially you would implement a Ruby style method_missing functionality within whatever shell you're using.  When command_not_found was thrown, your method would check the executable names of your installed Applications.\n\nA: Applescript to the rescue:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"iTunes\"' -e \"activate\" -e 'end tell'\n\nReplace the name of the application with the application you want to start and you're done. You can of course make it a shell function if needed:\nfunction f() {\n    osascript <<EOF\ntell application \"$1\"\n  activate\nend tell\nEOF\n}\n\nand use it that way:\nf iTunes\n\nI hate applescript, but it is useful sometimes, and I believe the only way to address an application simply by name on the command line. Everything else will require a full path.\n\nA: Finally I got it:\nAdd this to your .bash_profile\nfunction foomagick() {\n    rm -f ~/.foomagick.tmp\n    ls /Applications/ | grep \"\\.app\" | grep -v iWork | while read APP; do\n        # clean it up                                                           \n        a=`echo $APP | sed s/\\ //g`;\n        a=`echo $a | sed s/\\'//g`;\n        echo alias ${a%.*}=\"'open -a \\\"${APP%.*}\\\"'\" >> ~/.foomagick.tmp\n    done\n    source ~/.foomagick.tmp\n    rm ~/.foomagick.tmp  \n}\nfoomagick()\n\nNow the following work:\nSkim # open Skim.app\nSkim foo.pdf\nFireFox http://google.com\nFireFox google.com # ERROR. Looks for local file.\n\nEdit by Reid:\nI implemented the above as a Python script that makes wrapper scripts instead of aliases. You will need to put ~/bin/mankoffmagic in your path.

I have just upgraded to iOS 4.2.1 and I don't have an Apple TV so there's no Airplay button, however I still have a volume slider in the multitasking bar?\nWhat volume does that change, and whats the point of it, I can just use the hardware buttons. (I'd much rather it was a brightness slider like there is on the iPad)\n\nA: The volume changes the volume of the audio on your device, just like the hardware volume buttons do.\n", "Q: iOS 4.2 - What's there for the iPhone 3GS? I have looked at iOS 4.2 wrap-ups and all I can see are features for iPad.\nBesides AirPrint (which does not work with my printer), is there anything for the iPhone 3GS there?\n\nA: Among other things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Free “Find my iPhone” (don’t need MobileMe) —> this requires an iPhone 4\n\n*Safari allows you to search inside the page\n\n*You can assign different SMS/MMS/ALERTS to different phonebook contacts\n\n*AirPlay / AirPrint?\n\n*A volume slider control in the Multitaskbar\n\n*New icon for Voice Memos\n - \n\n\nAnything else?  \nUPDATE: There’s a trick to use the Find my iPhone in a 3GS or similar.

With AirPlay will I be able to stream to iPhone, iPod Touch, and/or iTunes, or is it only to Apple TV and 3rd party speakers?\n\nA: Yes.\nAirplay is really a technology platform that allows for streaming media on a local network. It isn't concerned with the type of device that is producing the media or consuming it.\nTo start with, support may be limited and may not come from Apple. However, certainly that will change with demand. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is an iOS app called AirPlayer which allows streaming of media to an iPhone/iPod/iPad.\n\n*There is a Mac proof-of-concept app also called AirPlayer which allows streaming of media to a Mac.\n\n\nA: Looks like Banana TV is a currently shipping Mac app (not just a proof-of-concept) that will play Airplay video or images from your iPhone/iPad.\n(TUAW review)\n\nA: Airserver allows you to stream Airplay audio and video from your iOS device to your Mac. Works great.\n\nA: You can Airplay to Windows, Mac, Android, or Amazon Fire using Reflector 2. It claims to support sending rom iOS 9 devices also (but I personally haven't tested the iOS 9 support yet).\nReflector installs an app that acts as an AirPlay and Google Cast receiver. The app is available for Windows, Mac, Android, or Amazon Fire. Since Reflector supports receiving both AirPlay and Google Cast it can receive audio/video from iOS or Android.\nIt's from Squirrels, the same company that makes the excellent AirParrot app (which allows you send AirPlay audio and video from Windows and Mac to AirPlay and Google Cast).\n", "Q: What has changed in iOS 4.2? iOS 4.2 has just been released, and I am wondering what exactly has changed? Can I assume that the changes are different for the iPhone, iPod, and iPad?\n\nA: There were quite a few changes. \nThe biggest is that this is the first version of iOS 4 for the iPad, which brings multitasking, folders, unified inbox, air print, air play, and more. \nThis is also the unifying iOS so that the iPad and iPhone and iPod Touch are running the same OS now.\nYou can find an entire list at http://www.apple.com/ios/\n\nA: Rene Ritchie, from the TiPb, has been posting really nice walkthroughs for each new iOS version, exploring the new features. I recommend them.\nI bundled the walkthroughs for iOS 4.2 for iPhone/iPod and iPad here: http://j.mp/exr6un\n\nA: *\n\n*Multitasking on iPad\n\n*Folders on iPad\n\n*AirPrint\n\n*AirPlay\n\n*Find My iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. (free)\n\n\nTaken from iOS 4.2 Software Update site.\n", "Q: iPod Touch (4gen) camera: video same resolution as still camera? I want to take a photo of something (an arm injury!), and I  think it'll be hard to hold the camera in just the right place while I hit the touchscreen-shutter.  But I could put it in video mode, and then pick out a good frame later.\nDoes the video taken by the iPod Touch have the same resolution/quality as a still frame captured by its camera?\n\nA: It's a bit crazy, but on the 4th gen iPod touch the video is actually higher resolution than the still pictures:\n\nCameras, photos, and video\n\n*\n\n*Video recording, HD (720p) up to 30 frames per second with audio; still photos (960 x 720) with back camera\n\n\n720p video is 1280x720, whereas the photos taken are only 960x720.\n", "Q: How to make new certificate recognised? We have a large number of Mac Minis that are running a piece of software that we have developed and have been distributed to various clients.\nWe recently updated our code signing certificate as the old one had expired. However, when we put a new version of the application which is signed with the new certificate on one of these machines, it pops up asking to 'Allow Once', 'Allow Always' etc.\nSince we have to remotely update these machines, it is not practical to click 'Allow Always' and type in the password on all these machines. Is there a command line way to make the new certificate recognised so that if a machine is updated with a version containing the new certificate, it will run straight away?\n\nA: Copy the certificate to the client (in DER or PEM format), then run:\nsudo security add-trusted-cert -d /path/to/certificate\n\nAt least, that works for SSL certificates; I haven't tried it for code signing.  You might need to add -p codeSign or something similar.  Also, this sets a trust policy for the certificate, but doesn't actually add it to the system keychain.  If you want it to appear there as well, you also need to run:\nsudo security add-certificate -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /path/to/certificate\n\n\nA: Turned out it wasn't a problem with the certificate after all, it was that the application signature used by parental controls changed when the certificate changed. This was fixed by manually editing the parental controls file to contain the new signature.\n", "Q: Should I Do Anything Extra to Protect IPhone After Going to Beach? My friend told me that the salt in the air on the beach will reduce the lifespan of iPhone. \nIs it true? If yes, is there anything I can do to \"clean up\" the salt in my iPhone?\n\nA: I think your friend is confusing sea shanties with reality.  What old mariners call \"salt air\" is really just the smell of decaying seaweed and dead fish.\nSalt, being a solid crystal, can't evaporate, so if there's any \"salt in the air\" it would be in the form of salt rocks flying around.  I imagine that's probably a lot less likely than \"sand in the air\", since there's typically not a lot of unsequestered salt at the beach.  Also, I put salt crystals in glass all the time (e.g., measuring cups), and have yet to see the salt scratch the glass at all, so I think the chances of this hypothetical \"salt in the air\" causing damage to an iPhone are practically nonexistent.\nI would worry more about a seagull pooping on it.\n\nA: Well, you iPhone is pretty well sealed.  Unless you dropped the thing in the sand or ocean, you can probably just clean the outside with some safe cleaning product. (i.e. all purpose pledge, works for electronics, just spray onto rag first, then wipe phone).\n\nA: While its true that cars and many other metal objects will rust faster near the ocean, the salt is hardly relevant for your iPhone unless you plan on leaving it exposed on the beach for a few months straight.\nThe oils/sweat from your hands and the general movements in and out of your bag/pocket/etc will clean up the minute amount of residual salt that might be on it (:\nOn top of that, I'm pretty sure its well sealed enough that, unless you actually had water spray directly on it or dropped it in the ocean, the insides will be fine and salt free.\nFinally, the metal on the outside is stainless steel, which is very resistant to rust...\nIn short, \"she'll be right mate\".\n(The first gen iPhones did have speaker/mic holes in the case that were perfectly sized to trap sand in the holes and you'd lose volume/clarity, but that's about the only real beach worry I can think of, and not an issue from the 3G onwards with their finer mesh on the speaker/mic).\n\nA: Put the iphone in an unlubed condom.  Navy Seals do this for their electronics. Works great. \n", "Q: Why won't my iPod Touch play in Bose SoundDock speakers anymore? I have owned and enjoyed the Bose SoundDock speakers for a number of years; during this time it has worked great with my iPod Mini, Video iPod, and iPod Touch. The speakers have an iPod dock that you seat the iPod in and the audio is played through the speaker.\nThese speakers predate the iPod Touch by many years and won't recharge the iPod Touch when plugged in. That's fine, I mention it because whenever I plug in the iPod Touch into the speakers the iPod Touch shows a message that recharging isn't supported.\nRecently, when I dock my iPod Touch in the speakers the warning that it can't recharge comes up, but no sound is played through the speakers. Instead, the iPod Touch's existing speakers play the music. Plugging in my Video iPod still works as expected - the sound comes out of the Bose speakers.\nI've tried undocking and redocking, wiggling it once docked, and so on, but I am unable to get the iPod Touch to play through the Bose speakers. Any idea what's going on here? This is frustrating since I use these speakers quite often...\nEDIT: Some further clarifications. My iPod Touch is a 2nd-gen iPod Touch (if that matters). It is, and has for some time, running software version 4.1. I have not tried updating to 4.2 or restoring the iPod's original settings. Also, the speakers continue to work with my iPod Video, so I'm pretty certain the problem lies somewhere with the iPod Touch and not the speakers themselves.\n\nA: Since it’s practically impossible to diagnose a problem like this without physical access to the iPod and the SoundDock, I’m going to give you a few ideas of what I’d try to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have access to another iPod, try that of course, if that works, we’ve found a problem with your particular iPod.\n\n*If you have access to another SoundDock… well, put your iPod in those and see if the problem lies in your SoundDock.\n\n*Since the last two were two obvious (and you probably thought about them), let me tell you that you can go to an Apple Store with both devices and try the above combinations there. I’m sure that you will find another SoundDock in an Apple Store to try your iPod and that they also have iPods so you can try your Sound Dock. It doesn’t hurt to ask.\n\n*In any case, the remaining obvious alternative is to restore the iPod, either to factory settings (and later using a backup) or to restore a backup (so you don’t lose everything).\n\n*The final idea, is to try 4.2, but that should be the last step. You don’t want 4.2 to introduce new “undiscovered” problems on top of your old problem. \n\n\nSadly, there isn’t much else we can do from here. The can’t charge or incompatible device message is “ok” most of the time (I had that problem too with a car adapter), but it worked anyway. \nI’m sorry I can’t come up with a better idea.\n Just had this same problem... I fixed it by spraying a Contact Cleaner on my Ipod/ITouch.. and it works after... sometimes, Dust or Dirt will cause bad connection between the Unit and the Sound Dock Port *\n\nA: This happened after I got my IPhone 4S.  I made my IPhone 3G an IPod Touch and it played fine on the Bose Docking Speaker( I got the same pop up that said it wouldn't support recharging.  But then today it just stopped playing Pandora.  I just dicovered how to fix it, or at least it worked for me.  Unplug the Bose unit from the wall and plug it back in. \nGood Luck, mine's working again. \n\nA: It might be useful to update to software version 4.2; that worked for my iPod Touch. \nIf that doesn't work, or introduces new problems, you can always revert to the old version of software. \nMy mom also had a similar problem, we tried upgrading the software but it didn't make any difference. \nFinally, I looked in the docking point on the iPod Touch (on the bottom, where you dock it) and it was a little coated in dust, I just blew on it and then tried plugging it in again, it worked.\nIf none of these things worked, try calling the Bose tech support! It's free and I've found them quite helpful.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my iPhone until I took of the protective case, then it seated in the dock just fine and I could play though the speakers.\n\nA: There is a solution.\nI have the same problem - my old iPod video charges & plays fine through the SoundDock, but my iPod Touch 4th gen and iPhone 4 both play but do not charge.\nI have spoken to Apple and Bose separately, and they both said Bose can replace the docks' connector for an updated one that has a different pin configuration. They said this will allow the dock to play and charge all current Apple iPod/iPhone products. However, It costs £79 to do this.  Not cheap, but better than having a redundant item gathering dust.\nJust contact Bose directly (number on their website) and have the serial number of the SoundDock to hand, or take your SoundDock to an Apple store and they will sort it out for you (it will still cost £79)\nHope this helps.\nSean.\n\nA: I unplugged the speakers from the wall and tried it again, which seems to have fixed my issue.\n\nA: It's the software. My new iPhone doesn't work on the Bose dock. My old iPhone worked fine with the Bose until I updated the software.\n", "Q: AirPlay for 3rd Party apps The experience I see thus far for AirPlay with 3rd party apps, on both iPhone and iPad, is that only the audio is output to the AppleTV but not the video. This is great for Pandora but not so good for any video app. Is this a bug with AirPlay or do the developers need to update their apps to support it properly?\n\nA: According to John Gruber, this is not possible, unfortunately:\n\nAirPlay is the killer feature for Apple TV. But perhaps we’d better keep that in the future tense for now: it’s going to be the killer feature for Apple TV. After installing today’s various software updates for iOS devices, the only apps I’ve seen where AirPlay works for video are the built-in iPod app (a.k.a. “Video” on the iPad and iPod Touch) and YouTube. In other apps, AirPlay is audio-only.\n\n\nA: Word from the future: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniPhoneOS/Articles/iOS4_3.html\nYou'll note right up top that it's now totally possible for 3rd-party apps to spit video over AirPlay (as of iOS 4.3; been this way for some time now.).\n\nA: Jobs stated in an email it will be available in 2011:\n\nQ: [...] I just purchased\n  Apple TV and was wondering are you\n  ever going to make airplay video work\n  for videos in safari and 3rd party\n  apps? [...]\nA: Yep, hope to add these features to\n  Airplay in 2011.\n\n", "Q: What are my options for full system (or at least home directory) encryption? I own a MacBook Pro, which is obviously a Laptop, so I want to protect myself in case it ever gets stolen.\nOn Windows I can use TrueCrypt to do a full system encryption, but would that also be a choice on Mac OS X?\nI think that OS X contains a built-in encryption, but when it was released (10.2? 10.3?) I heard it had some really bad flaws that made it unusable.\nIs that still the case? What are my options to encrypt either the full drive or at least my home directory?\n\nA: Mac OS X comes with FileVault for encrypting your home directory. There isn't a whole lot of customization for it, but it does its job. There are a few downsides, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*FileVault does not play well with Time Machine backups. Time Machine can only back up the FileVault encrypted disk image when the user is logged out.\n\n*As FileVault runs it tends to slowly consume disk space. This space is reclaimed at logout, but it can cause problems if your drive is nearly full.\nThese downsides are the result of FileVault being implemented as an encrypted disk image that is then mounted at login. However, as long as you make sure you regularly log out of your machine they shouldn't present that much of an issue.\nIt does appear that TrueCrypt is available for Mac OS X, but I've never used it and don't know how well it works.\n\nA: PGP whole-disk encryption supports OS X (10.5 and 10.6, Intel CPUs only), including the boot disk.  \n\nA: The new Mac OS Lion supports whole disk encryption with the new Filevault2.\n\nA: According to http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/sys-encryption-supported-os you can't use TrueCrypt to encrypt the OS partition on macs. No idea whether it can encrypt the user directory.\n\nA: truecrypt 7.0a works like a champ on os x 10.6.6.  It even works with etoken pro 64k!  You can encrypt any container (basically like a disk image).  However, I don't see any way to get it to encrypt the user directory.\n", "Q: After update (to 4.2) iOS says I have 723 songs, but iPod.app says \"No Content\" I have just updated to 4.2, and the space for my music is still taken according to iTunes, and the device \"About\" screen says I have 723 songs, but I cannot see it in the iPod app. I assume that another sync is required to activate the content again or something to that effect?\niTunes can see the content on my phone and even allow me to play it. I will attach some images to illustrate the issue. My photo library was updated and seems to work. I have also tried closing all apps, which did not help.\n\n\n\n\nA: I am speculating, that this is what happened: I did the update on another computer (not the one my music is synced to), which invalidated the copy protection of my music library, so when I plugged my phone back into the machine where my music library is stored it did the deed for me. That is what seems to have happened anyway.\n\nA: While Martin's answer is correct to bring back the songs, but here the songs are not lost/ disappeared from iPhone. There is a way to fix this. \nAfter upgrading to 4.2.1, the songs are still there, but by somehow the songs are not shown in iPod.app. All I did is plug-in the headphones and click the middle button to play the songs. And it did worked.\nNo need to re-sync the songs.\n\nA: To add to your own answer, you will have to re-sync with your library or reset some contents (via the correct iTunes).\n\nA: found the answer with the second suggestion here.\n\nA: Re-start touch (Hold home and off/on buttons) and sync again with iTunes, bingo!\n", "Q: I have a 2009 MacBook Air, bought a year ago - will I notice much of a performance improvement if I buy the latest version (Late 2010)? Does the SSD make that much difference? The processor is not much beefier, what are the other factors I should consider/which have an impact? Anyone made the same upgrade and happy with a significant improvement? Or am I just wanting a new shiny thing?\n\nA: The flash storage makes a huge difference (a fresh system boots in about 15 seconds, apps will start instantly etc.), and the new MBA does not need to throttle the CPU when it gets hot. So you will probably notice a big improvement. See Macworlds benchmark results, for example.\n", "Q: How secure is it to allow Safari to remember passwords on my iPhone? What key does it use to encrypt the stored passwords? If it uses the phone's unlock code, what key does it use for phones that don't have one set up?\nIf someone had access to the hard drive contents (e.g. by connecting it to a Linux machine), how easy would it be for them to decrypt the saved passwords?\n\nA: Not a direct answer but I too had similar concerns. With IOS 4.2, they have enabled the remote wipe ability for all iphone4 users via MobileME. So at least, if you lose your phone, you can have it wiped out remotely.\n\nA: According to an article on Yahoo News, there are known exploits for Apple's keychain, which would allow an attacker to gain access to passwords stored on the iPhone. I believe that Safari uses keychain to store the username/passwords you tell it to remember.\n", "Q: PDF Searching/Http Syncing on iPad I have two requirements with handling PDFs on an iPad, but I can't seem to find one app that will solve the problem. I was hoping the iOS 4.2 update would address this, but it doesn't.\nHere are my requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*I need to be able to search for words in a PDF.\n\n*I need to have this PDF sync to a HTTP url. That is to say, I want my PDF on my iPad to be the exact same (the latest revision) of my PDF on my HTTP server.\nThe ideal solution would be able to just use Safari and open up the PDF via Safari. However, with Safari, I can't search for text within a PDF.\nAny thoughts on how I can solve my problem? Any apps out there that will do this? iBooks or Goodreader don't.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: DropBox and iAnnotate, and since iAnnotate supports DropBox you really only work with one program as requested.\n", "Q: What does it mean if I have lots of \"Inactive\" memory at the end of a work day? After a day's of work at my MacBook Pro running Mac OS X 10.6.5, Activity Monitor shows that the majority of my computer's 8 GB of memory is \"Inactive\", and only a tiny sliver of the pie chart is \"Free\". This is even when I have closed all applications, with only the Finder running.\nWhat does that mean? Is the \"Inactive\" memory taken up by something? Or is it actually still available for applications to use? Thanks.\n\nA: This is most likely not a problem, and in fact is potentially speeding up your computer.\nAll (most?) operating systems utilise a Disk Cache, which stores some recently accessed files in memory so that repeated access of those files can be sped up. The disk cache on OS X is variable in size, and will appear as \"Inactive Memory\" being used.\nIf any program needs more memory, OS X will clear some of the disk cache (the least recently used files) to allow space for the program to run/expand.\nI find that if I do a lot of compiling or photo-sorting (i.e. accessing thousands of files in succession) the disk cache will expand and use a lot of Inactive Memory. Provided its just this disk cache, its nothing to worry about.\nIf it is a background process or application that is expanding in its memory usage (but its pages are being marked inactive) then you'll be able to tell by checking for any programs with very high \"Real Memory\" usage in Activity Monitor. If there's nothing obviously large there (i.e. the total is a long way short of 8GB) then it'll be the file cache.\nYou should see that there's little if any Swap usage, and if you open a memory-intensive program the amount of inactive memory will decrease without having to swap to disk.\n(I believe there was a bug in 10.4 or 10.5 for a while where it wouldn't always free up this memory very effectively, and would cause swapping despite having a large disk cache, but in my experience this appears solved in 10.6).\n\nA: \"Inactive\" memory is available for use by other programs -- it's just caching programs or data that you recently used, in case you need them again.  If you launch different programs or need different data, the cached memory will cleared and made available to your new workload as needed.\nThat's the theory, at any rate, and I believe it to be sound.  However, I did find this reference to a \"purge\" utility someone wrote because they didn't think inactive memory was being released quickly enough.\nFor official documentation on the subject, read this (and search for \"inactive\").\n\nA: OS X, like most modern operating systems, uses a virtual memory system for managing memory. Among other purposes, this allows the operating system to treat the computer as having an unlimited pool of memory. To achieve this, the OS will page unused parts of RAM out to a disk store known as the swapfile.\nOf course, RAM is not unlimited, so OS X groups RAM into four categories: wired, active, inactive, and free. Wired memory is required by the operating system, and can never be paged out of memory. Active memory is memory used by currently-running programs. Inactive memory was used recently by programs which have now been terminated (or haven't been unused in a long time). Free memory is, as the name suggests, RAM that is not being used.\nWhen you launch a program, it gets loaded into active memory. When you quit a program, however, it doesn't get removed from RAM; rather, it gets bumped into inactive memory. This is why it is often faster to re-launch a program -- it is still in RAM (try this with a big program like Firefox).\nOnce all your memory is used (free memory is 0), the OS will write out inactive memory to the swapfile to make more room in active memory.\nIf a program gets paged out to the swapfile, and you re-launch it, it'll get pulled from the swapfile into active memory.\nSo in short, you actually shouldn't care if your free memory is low. In fact, you want it to be low -- free memory is wasted memory (as the OS isn't using it for anything).\nWhen examining how much memory your computer is using, you actually want to pay attention mostly to Swap used, which tells you the size of the virtual memory swapfile, and Page ins, which tells you how often the OS has to pull memory from the swapfile into active memory.\n\nA: Starting with OS X 10.5 there are evident memory management problems in MAC OS X. \nI finally managed to reproduce the problematic scenario, so i run the test and recorded the screen, into video.\nMAC OS X Lion performance problem - broken memory management\nI run the tar+bzip command, which is basic unix stuff, on the large amount of picture files, in my Pictures/ folder. Just before start, i run the \"purge\" command, to delete inactive/cached program data.\nYou can see on the video that free memory starts to drop very fast, and inactive is constantly rising. If you take a look at \"bsdtar\" command, it takes only a fragment of RAM, so the problem is not in this process. You cannot say that it is a program memory leak, because then the problem would not be in inactive ram, rather in active/wired.\nWhen the free memory dropped below 100mb, i started some apps, like Safari, iPhoto and MS Word, and you can see in the video, that it takes even minutes to start an app, when normally (when there is free RAM), it would take some 3-5 secs to load.\nI run the same scenario and the same commands on my Linux Centos 6 box, no problem there ! Memory usage is some 10-20mb, no problems with cache/buffer.\nThe memory management must be very broken in Mac OS X !\n\nA: This discussion makes sense only if the statement that \"your computer will run faster when free memory is low\" - were true.  Unless my Desktop Mac is wired weird, the minute my free memory (monitored) starts getting low, whatever program I am running at the time starts to bog down to the point where I can't do anything until it moves back up by itself or by my Free Memory intervention.  I have an iMac 2118 (2006 or later) that maxes out at 3 GB RAM so I try to manage it when I can but this is very frustrating. Any thoughts?\n", "Q: How do I boot into the EFI firmware shell? I'd like to experiment with the EFI shell on a MacBook Pro 2010 model.  I am unable to find the keyboard sequence to hold on boot.  Does someone know what the sequence is, do I need to boot from my Snow Leopard CD instead to access this or has the EFI shell been left out (I read that Intel makes it an optional component) ?\nThanks,\nScott\n\nA: Yup, apparently it is missing and you have to install EDK to get it.\n", "Q: What is the Steam gaming platform? \n*\n\n*What is Steam?  \n\n*Why should I buy the game on Steam instead from normal retailer? \n\n*Can a game bought via Steam played independently?\n\n\nA: What is Steam?\nAccording to them, they are  The Ultimate Online Game Platform. What this actually means is that they are a portal for you to buy, play and update games. With certain benefits. But “steam” is just that. They sell games (more on this later), they offer you a community where you can have Friends, Chat with them, unlock achievements, etc. If you’re a user of an iPhone/Pod/Pad that has GameCenter in it, think of Steam as a pseudo GameCenter.\nWhy Steam and not normal retailer?\nThe advantages of Steam are a few, and I couldn’t list them all because some things may not be better for everybody, but let’s just say that the strength of the platform and what makes it different from buying a boxed game could be summarized in a few bullets (in no particular order):\n\n\n*\n\n*Very easy to buy a game (and discover new ones)\n\n*Instant buy, start downloading, no delivery costs.\n\n*Automatic updates without having to worry\n\n*If you buy a game on your Macintosh and one day decide to play it on your Windows computer, provided that the game is supported in that Platform, you can continue your game there, as if nothing has happened. You re-download the game in your Windows machine and voilá.\n\n*Friends, Achivements, Progress… Steam as a platform sports game achievements that you unlock by playing.\n\n*Discounts, sometimes you will get “cheaper” versions of the games or promos that you can take advantage of. \n\n*More, I’m sure there are other advantages but think of an AppStore for games with a plus. \n\n\nCan games be played independently?\nYes and no. I don’t believe you can copy that game over another machine (tho you could probably install steam on that machine and copy the game… I haven’t tried this). But you can play offline if you don’t have Internet. \nBonus: Is it worth?\nIf you have a Mac and like gaming, it’s definitely a big plus, as a lot of games get ported and put into the Steam network. If you’re in Windows, I believe the ease of use and “point and click” nature of the service make it worth. And also the fact that you don’t have to pay to use it. Did I mention it’s a free service? ;)\nBut Does it have Cons?\nSome invaluable readers pointed out a few cons, which I will update (and I encourage everybody to contribute):\n\n\n*\n\n*When you start it, it automatically updates, giving you the sensation that the client is hang. Also if your network speed is not optimal, this process can demand a lot of time.\n\n*If your network connection is not good, downloading three gigabytes of game might not be the best idea, given that you usually can’t start playing until almost most (if not all) the content is downloaded. \n\n*In order to play offline, you have to log in, and tell steam “I’m going offline”, which kind of voids the possibility of an unexpected loss of connectivity or forgetting to do it before disconnecting for example. \n\n*I didn’t mention this, but it’s important to note that not all the Windows games are available on Steam and not all work on OS X. Although decent amount (and growing) catalog is available, not every title is there. \n\n\nUPDATE: There’s a dedicating gaming community in Stack Exchange for that. Don’t hesitate asking gaming questions there too, those guys may seem like gamers, but they aren’t playing at all ;) \n", "Q: Relative performance of 2006 Mac Pro and 2007 iMac I'm trying to evaluate a purchase but am having trouble finding apples-to-apples performance comparisons for these two machines.  A year and and many details separate them.  Are there any common benchmarks that consider disk and graphics performance?  Which is preferable for software development (dual-head, but otherwise light on the GPU)?\nMac Pro (2006) [Detailed specs]\n\n\n*\n\n*Two dual-core Xeon processors at 2.66GHz (1.33GHz bus)\n\n*3GB RAM\n\n*NVIDIA GeForce 7300 GT with 256 MB RAM\n\n\niMac (2007) [Detailed specs]\n\n\n*\n\n*Core 2 Duo (obviously dual-core) at 2.4GHz (800MHz bus)\n\n*3GB RAM\n\n*ATI Radeon 2600 with 256 MB RAM\n\n\nBoth machines have their original hard drives (SATA).\nThanks in advance for your input.\n\nA: Your question is somewhat difficult to answer, because not all is based upon “raw” performance.\nI’d say that it would be better if you consider the following differences:\nRAM\n\n\n*\n\n*MP(MacPro): Very easy to add and the limit is probably higher than what you can/Want to afford for the task you want to perform. Adding 8-12GB is probably “cheap”.\n\n*iM(iMac): Probably more limited, tho not harder to change as far as I can remember, but if you need 12 GB you can’t achieve that with that (or any AFAICR) iMac.\n\n\nHARD DRIVES\n\n\n*\n\n*MP: Although “external” drives are “ok”, having four internal SATA bays is godsend. Very easy to add/remove drives and to create a simple RAID1 if you wanna have a mirror “just in case”. \n\n*iM: close to impossible (unless you have the right tools, time, patience and dedication) to change the internal drive, which is a “slower” 2.5 drive if I am not mistaken. Some “hacks” exist to replace the superdrive with another drive, but I don’t know if that Model fits. \n\n\nVideo\n\n\n*\n\n*MP: Tho I don’t know if the NVIDA is better than that particular ATI (tho I believe it is), the expandability of the MP is superior to the zero expandability of the iMac. You could add more cards to your MacPro for more than two displays if that’s what you want. But you have to get your own displays…\n\n*iM: Zero. You can’t change or add another video card. You’re stuck with a very nice 24 inch display and an integrated iSight. The MacPro, will need displays (and webcams). The CONS here is that if you don’t like Glossy Displays… you’re out of luck :)\n\n\nRAM Speed, Bus Speed, etc\nAll these things don’t really change your day to day workflow, yes, some Front Side Buses are faster than others, but in the end, the difference is probably not a decision factor. (given similar specs of course).\nConnectivity\n\n\n*\n\n*Both machines have enough USB/FW ports I believe, tho the Mac Pro surely has some more, you will need more ports in the iMac if you use external drives (not that you have much choice there). \n\n\nSo which one do I chose?\nThe answer is, there’s no answer. You have to evaluate your priorities. I wouldn’t change my Mac Pro (early 2008) for a new iMac, because I already have two 27’’ screens, already have 4 drives in there (with some RAID going on) + an SSD for the OS and I have replaced the stock video card (NVIDIA) with an ATI (because my nVidia Failed and the ATI costed the same as the out of warranty nVIdia). My Mac Pro is going to turn 3 years soon and it works fantastically.\nThe iMac on the other hand, is a beautiful looking machine that if you use paired with a lot of BlueTooth stuff, makes your desk look very pristine. Sadly, I need storage, redundancy and multi-core for some of the things I do for a living, so the 8 cores of my Mac Pro are needed in my case. \nI notice that the MultiCore is godsend sometimes, you see processes hanging there at 100% and the rest of the CPUs and cores take care. But of course, a normal World of Warcraft user wouldn’t even use 5% of all that. \nI suggest you visit Anandtech’s Mac section if you want some benchmarks and reviews. It’s usually filled with good impressions and comments and sometimes comparisons. I don’t know if you’ll find an exact comparison between those two models, but you might come up with something similar. \nMy Personal Opinion\nGet the Mac Pro if you’re going to develop and already have screens (or the budget to buy them), because in the future, when you want your time machine, your drive cloned, more space, etc., the Mac Pro is going to be much more helpful than stacking fragile external Firewire/USB drives. \nUPDATE ON VIDEO\nAccording to the experts (tegeril), the “ATI 2600 Pro is a substantially superior card to the Nvidia 7300GT”. You’ll have to find some benchmarking for that and of course evaluate if you’re going to need the extra power or the expandability is better. \n\nA: There's a Mac-specific set of benchmarks called Xbench.  If you have access to both machines, you can run it on them and see how they stack up.\nIf not, there's an online database at db.xbench.com, and there are probably other places around you can find Xbench scores.\nHere's a couple that are pretty close to yours, though running different versions of Mac OS (not sure how much that matters):\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac, 2.4GHz, 3GB RAM\n\n*MacPro, 2.66GHz, 3GB RAM\nIn this particular matchup, it's pretty even.  The Xeon wins on threading (not surprising), while the iMac wins on hard disk (surprising, to me) -- though as Martin noted, it's easy to add more or better disks to a MacPro.\nThe decision probably comes down to form-factor, as much as anything else.  Obviously people have been developing software on machines far slower than either of these for decades.\n\nA: Also don't for get to check out Geekbench results. I find their results very valuable in determining overall system performance. FYI EveryMac.com has the average Geekbench results posted for almost every mac that can run the benchmark. \n\n\n\nApple iMac \"Core 2 Duo\" 2.4 24-Inch (Al) Geekbench result\nApple Mac Pro \"Quad Core\" 2.66 (Original) Geekbench result\nIn this case for raw performance the Mac Pro wins this contest hands down, go with the Mac Pro. I actually have the same Mac Pro, and it runs very well and was a very productive upgrade from a MacBook\n", "Q: How do I \"copy image address\" in iOS? On desktops, when web browsing you typically right click on an image and choose an item from a contextual menu to display/copy the image URL. In iOS, when you tap and hold down an image, an action sheet displays asking if you want to save the image, copy to the clipboard, etc. But what if you just want the URL?\nIf safari doesn't offer this functionality, is there a 3rd party browser that does? Specifically, one that works on the iPad.\n\nA: Neither iOS Safari nor Opera Mini support this option. However, you can install the 'view source' iOS bookmarklet, as explained here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://fettig.net/weblog/2007/07/02/view-source-for-safari-on-iphone/\nAnd use it to look for the image link within the source you are visiting.\nThis may be cumbersome using older iOS versions, but it is much easier on iOS 4.2, using the 'Find text on webpages' feature which allows you to search for text using Safari's Search field (right of the navigation bar) to look for image extensons like .jpg, .png and .gif.\n\nA: Tap, and hold the image; then choose \"copy,\" open a new browser window, and paste into the address bar.\n\nA: Tap and hold, and the 2nd option will be to open it in a new page.  Tap that, and you'll get a new window.  Tap the URL bar, and Copy.\n\nA: [Note: this has only been tested on iOS 5.1.1 on iPad]\nFor a simple image, you can tap-and-hold it and select 'Copy'. This will copy the URL of the image which you can paste wherever you need it.\nHowever, when the image is being used as a link to another URL, this method copies the linked URL only.\nA method that always works is to use the Show Images Bookmarklet (from here - a useful resource any time you want a bookmarklet on iOS).\n", "Q: How tell Safari to open new tab instead of a window How do I tell Safari to always open links that want a new window in a new tab?\nI know I can use cmd-click to do this but that's not what I want. \nThere has to be a setting somewhere?\n\nA: You can use Safari preferences (⌘ ,) to change this setting, you can use automatically or always for opening pages in new tabs instead of new windows.\n\n\nA: In safari preferences (command + ,) on the \"Tabs\" tab you can set this options. \nOr you can right click the link and choose the option you want.

Does anybody have experience with that problem? Is it a pain to get it repaired?\n\nA: I don’t have experience with Apple Keyboard problems specifically, but this seems like a problem which Apple would fix by simply replacing your keyboard. Assuming that the spacer broke during normal usage, and that you are still within the original warranty period for the hardware, it’s far easier for Apple to replace the keyboard than to attempt to repair it.\n", "Q: Best resources on data recovery from corrupted OS X HFS+ partitions My Macbook Pro won't boot from it's hard disc.

Is there a way to remove the preview icon of a gif or jpeg file ?\nI made very little image file for the web, but they weight 45 Ko ! I guess this comes from the preview icons\nEdit : I've added a screenshot to show you the informations i've got.

If want to compact the file anyway, use the command xattr -d com.apple.ResourceFork /Volumes/Database/WebFolder/imgs/confirm.gif to remove the fork.\n\nA: The Finder preview data isn't stored inside the actual file, so that's not what's causing your size problems.\nImageOptim is a handy GUI tool for shrinking excess data. Also, if you're making a small image I'd recommend png or gif, jpeg is designed for photos.\n\nA: Try deleting the resource fork. From the command line this could be:\ncp /dev/null file.ext/rsrc\n\nIf you want to explore the resource fork more, use the DeRez CLI tool (from Developer Tools) or Rezilla.app (GUI)\n", "Q: Did I get a lemon, or does the ipod touch g4 come with a crappy usb cable? Really, I mean you shell out $300 for this thing you'd think the usb cable would be able to sync after two months of use.\nI ended up buying one from China that works just fine (as opposed to the one that came with it!)\n\nA: I believe that all current generation Apple devices some with the same sync cable. From my experience (almost everyone I know is an apple fan) some people wear through them pretty quickly (usually girls who wind them up and put them in hand bags etc) and some last forever (such as mine which just sits on the desk and only gets used every few days. its the original cable that came with my first iPhone a few years back and still works fine).\n\nA: I noticed the new USB cable that came with my iPhone 4 was different than the older one with iPhone 3G, and even different than the one that came with my iPad. It was made with that new \"rubberized\" white plastic like the new ear buds, that seems springier.\nAnyway, if the cable stops functioning under normal use after only two months, I'm quite certain it would be covered under Apple's iPod one year warranty. You should go to your friendly neighbourhood Apple Store or inquire about a replacement.\n\nA: I've had mine for 2 months, throwing it in the bottom of my bag every day, and I've had no problems with it yet.\nIt's the same thickness as the previous iPod USB cable I have, though softer.  That one is several years old and still working fine, though I haven't abused it nearly as much.\nOne nice thing is that, despite being Apple-proprietary, the cable itself is fairly standard across their products these days, so if you have a friend who upgrades iPods/iPhones a lot, they might have a spare (or three) they'd be willing to give you.\nAlso, FWIW, Apple's cable was almost certainly from China, as well.  :-)\n", "Q: Cannot restore or recover ipod Classic 80gb I have an ipod Classic 80gb.

Just download Handbrake and convert your video to H.264, then try importing that into iMovie.\n\nA: Using the VLC player, use the Media Information or Codec Information commands in the Tools menu. This will tell you the original codec. \nChances are that the codec is not one of the ones in Quicktime, or Perian. I am guessing iMovie opens the file, goes through the codec list, can't find it, and fails.\nIf the movie plays on a Windows machine, iTunes for Windows might convert it if you select it in the iTunes library, and choose 'Create iPad or AppleTV Version' from iTune's Advanced menu. \n", "Q: How can I type Chinese on MacBook Pro?

It constantly gives me the grey \"Your machine needs to be restarted\" half way through booting. At first I was able to boot into SuperUser mode and run an fsck which passed normally, but eventually after the constant rebooting fsk now reports:\nInvalid node structure\nThe volume Macintosh HD could not be verified completely\n\nI have also tried booting to my Snow Leopard install DVD but that just brings up the grey \"Your machine needs to be restarted\" screen. \nI assume now that my HD is toast (When using another Mac, I am unable to mount it in Target disk mode), but the inability to boot to the CD tells me there is something deeper at fault here. Is there any way that I can further diagnose the problem?\n\nA: From what you describe, your internal hard drive failed, which will require a replacement;  since you have an iMac, I suggest that unless you’re very comfortable using a variety of tools and have time, let Apple do it for you. In any case, what you can try to do is, connect an external USB/FW drive and try to install into that drive. \nThe fact that your drive doesn’t want to boot from the DVD is intriguing if anything, but the DVD may be crashing when reading the “broken” drive. It’s rare, but it could happen. Do you have any other Mac to “clone” into an external drive and try to boot from there? \nSince it’s an iMac, your best bet is to remove the internal drive and proceed from there. The problem is that removing the drive is a painful operation. \nBest idea: go to an Apple store or certified shop. They have the tools and the spare parts to better diagnose the problem. \n", "Q: Problem downloading iPhone/iOS upgrade, iTunes complains: \"You do not have enough access privileges for this operation\" When trying to upgrade my iPhone running iOS 4.1 to 4.2, iTunes displays the error message saying:\n\nThere was a problem downloading the software for the iPhone \"[Username]'s iPhone\".

I've often been able to track down mail problems by looking in there.\n\nA: right clicking the account in mailbox section of the left panel in Mail and clicking 'get account info' could help to see if it's connecting to the mailbox properly.\nYou could also try turning it off and on again - ie. right click account again then click 'take \"[account name]\" offline' and then repeating to 'take \"[account name]\" online' may help...\nFailing that, see if you can connect to that account through a webmail client - if you have one available for that account to see if it's a problem with the email server rather than mail.\n", "Q: What is the best way to modify Apple keyboards for alternate layouts? I would like to permanently modify my keyboard's button labels to match the non-default keyboard layout that I have set on an Apple computer, so that others who do not touch-type can use the keyboard.  How do I do this?\nI have the \"Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad (English)\".\nWhy?  I don't use the QWERTY layout on my US-bought Apple computer, and Apple does not sell anything except QWERTY keyboards.  This is not a problem for me, as I touch-type, so the labels on the keys are basically unused by me.  But other people (mostly children) use my computer, and I would like to allow them to \"hunt-and-peck\" with the system-wide keyboard layout.\nI have tried using stickers to \"relabel\" the keys, but this is obviously not very durable and looks terrible and makes it difficult to touch-type since it obscures the little nubs on the \"home keys\".  Most of the stickers have been worn off.\nI am willing to disassemble the keyboard and reassemble it if the keys are physically separate from each other.  But I am not willing to disassemble the keyboard to discover if this is true or not.  I have looked at several Mac \"tear down\" articles, but none of them illustrate the keyboard mechanism.  If I could simply re-arrange the existing buttons, I would have to remove the \"home key\" nubs on the \"F\" and \"J\" keys and add something to the \"U\" and \"H\" keys, but I think I can handle that.\nI am also willing to use paint and/or chemicals to modify the labels, but I know nothing about where to start here.  Are the labels painted on?  Or are they a different kind of plastic somehow injected into the button plastic?  Can I paint over the existing labels and then re-paint new ones?  Or would I have to somehow dye the keys to be some single color and then paint on my labels?  What would be a type of paint that is durable enough for a keyboard?\nI am not willing to buy a third-party keyboard, unless it is nearly exactly equivalent to the Apple keyboard.  I suppose I am willing to buy a second third-party keyboard and rotate them if that is simple to do with OS X.  But ideally, I want one keyboard with labels that match the default layout, and touch-typers can use whatever layout they want, and hunt-and-peckers can still make do.\nAre there any other options?\n\nA: If you have a keyboard similar to the one described here, it sounds like you can just pop the keys off and push them back down in the new position.\n\nA: Would one of the printed keyboard covers offered by companies like KBCovers do the job? \nSince you have not stated what the actual \"non-standard keyboard layout\" you are using consists of, it's hard for us to understand what you need.\nFurthermore, Apple does indeed sell keyboards in other layouts besides QWERTY. In the United States Apple Store, you can order an Apple keyboard layed out for US English, German, Belgian, Danish, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Swiss, Swedish, Norwegian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian and Arabic.\n\nA: I haven’t disassembled an Apple Keyboard (aluminium) myself, but I know it’s possible, albeit with a lot of complications to put it back. \nInstead, I suggest to find a “real” keyboard from This Epic Keyboard guide. Some keyboards will allow you to remove the keycaps. \nThe different keyboard mechanisms are explained there. Apple keyboards use the scissor switch mechanism, which is not 100% friendly to reassemble, but possible.\nAdditionally, in a direct response to your question, here is a nice review of the Apple keyboard which shows a picture of a key removed and the scissor mechanism so you know what to expect if you still want to pursue the operation.\nI guess the best way is to pull…pull…pull… (with caution) until the keys “get lose”. That’s how I did it on a laptop with scissor mechanism that had a few failing keys. \n", "Q: How can I view the full name of drop down items on iOS? For a dropdown list on a website, iOS shows only the first few characters and then ellipses for items with a long name. Is it possible to somehow see the full text of each item?\n\nA: You could try selecting the item and then viewing the dropdown list in view mode, not selection mode. But As far as I know there is no way, in selection mode, to change how Apple presents the choices.\n\nA: Other option is to turn your phone to a landscape mode...\n", "Q: iOS 4.2 on iPod Touch 2d Gen : is it worth it? Is there any advantage to upgrade the iPod Touch 2d Gen to iOS 4.2 ?\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the tech specs enough for that new version ?\n\n*Does it consume more battery ?\n\n*Will it be slower ?\n\n\nA: I'd say yes. I just upgraded a pair of 2nd gen iPod Touches to iOS 4.2 and it's been really solid so far - it hasn't slowed down the device or impacted the battery as far as I can tell. If you have an Airport Express or new Apple TV the AirPlay feature is very nice - this Thanksgiving I really enjoyed being able to stream music to a pair of speakers directly from the iPod in my pocket. (this will affect your battery as the device has to keep WiFi active to stream)\n", "Q: Is there a barcode app that works on pictures instead of needing to be connected to wifi for it to work? I've got a couple of barcode apps, but they all require that you have the item, the camera, and the internet connection at the same place.\nAre there any barcode apps where you can take a picture of the item's barcode, store the picture, and then feed it into the app when you have an internet connection?\n\nA: I use RedLaser and it has this capability.

When I go into keychain under access control, it looks like maybe it's because it's not set \n\nA: Double check your permissions in those files, if they are not like this, it won’t work:\n-rw-------  1 martin  staff   1675 Jul 27  2009 id_rsa\n-rw-r--r--  1 martin  staff    403 Jul 27  2009 id_rsa.pub\n\nUPDATE:\nIf you see that the files have an @, that means they have “extended attributes”. \nYou can see what they are by issuing:\nxattr -l <filename>\n\n\nA: Connect manually from Terminal using the verbose options to see where your problem lies, if it's a client-side problem. You might also want to check the error logs on the server to find out if your publickey is getting rejected. Permissions on the user folder, the .ssh folder, and the files within (like authorized_keys) need to have all group/other write permissions removed, on both the client and the server. SSH is very picky about permissions and will not use anything that is accessible to anyone other than you.\n\nA: I had this problem as well.  For me /usr/bin/ssh-agent shuts off after a while. \npgrep ssh-agent\n\n\n/usr/bin/ssh-agent -s  #should show you something like this\n\nSSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-OYn3ShRY4l/agent.37715; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK;\nSSH_AGENT_PID=37716; export SSH_AGENT_PID;\necho Agent pid 37716;\n\nI even got irritated, and removed the OS X programs from the Access Control side and replaced them with up to date, modern MacPorts versions.  All is fine, except that Keychain Accesss is a bit flaky.  My version of ssh-add runs forever. You only need to run the 'ancient of days' version /usr/bin/ssh once to get your key into your keychain.  \n", "Q: Why does changing \"Open with\" also change a files \"Modification date\"? Something I noticed a while ago. I use Carbon Copy Cloner for backing up my files and I noticed one day when I changed a video's \"Open with\" flag to always open a video file with Movist instead of Quicktime, and the next time the clone ran it copied the file again. Even though nothing was changed. Which made me realize that OS X changes changes a files modification date causing backup programs like Rsync (Which CCC and SuperDuper use) and Time Machine to re-copy the file, even if it's 10GB in size.\nWhy does it do this? Is there a technical reason or is it an oversight? Seems like a silly idea to me. Especially since changing a label doesn't modify the file and the color selection is duplicated without the whole file being copied.\n\nA: Some experimentation using the xattr command shows this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Label information is stored in the com.apple.FinderInfo extended attribute, which every file should have by default.\n\n*Custom application associations are stored in the com.apple.ResourceFork attribute, which not every file has.\n\n*Updating the FinderInfo attribute does not cause the modification date to be modified.\n\n*Creating/updating the ResourceFork causes the modification date to be modified.\n\n\nThe resource fork historically had a special place in Mac file systems. I'm not sure if the com.apple.ResourceFork extended attribute is the same as a resource fork, if the latter was superseded by the former or how else they are connected.\nIf there's a technical difference between an extended attribute and a resource fork, it may be \"necessary\" for a file to be modified when the resource fork is updated, but not when the extended attribute is written.\nIt may be that the (legacy) API for updating resource forks updates the file modification date in the process, while the extended attribute API doesn't. The latter possibly in error, possibly because of different philosophies.\nVague information, but it might give a little more insight. In the end though you're right. Some meta information modification causes the modification date to be updated, others doesn't. Whether there's a reason behind this or if it's just an oversight… only a few guys at Apple may know. :)\n\nA: When you select a single file, open a Get Info window, and choose a different, non-default application, this Launch Services binding is saved in the resource fork of the file itself, in a 'usro' (User Override) resource. As far as I know, the format of this resource is private, determined by Apple, and is subject to change. (The all lowercase characters in the OSType name provide a clue, since Apple reserves file type, creator codes and resource types with all lowercase characters. For example, 'icns' (Icon Suite) resource type, 'ttxt' (originally from Teach Text, but is now the creator code (CFBundleSignature) of TextEdit.app), etc.).\nThis resource is created using the Resource Manager functions to modify the fork of the file, which in turn updates the file's modification date.\nAn example file which I just tried this procedure on is shown in the image below, opened in Resorcerer. (Special note: you will notice in the left column that there are 2 types listed: 'TEXT' and 'usro'. There is in fact only a single 'usro' entry; Resorcerer is showing that there's a 'TEXT' resource entry because it notices the content in the file's data fork is text based (a source code header file), and is therefore providing convenient access to it). The second image shows the contents of this resource, which basically contains a path to the target application I chose.\n\n\nSince this 'usro' User Override resource is saved as part of the file itself, that explains why the Launch Services Programming Guide: Choosing the Binding Preference for a File claims the following:\n\nNote: Explicit binding preferences for individual items are not user-specific but systemwide—that is, they continue to apply to the given item on that same computer, even if a different user logs in.\n\nNow, to go one step further. If you now click the Change All button to make this a global override, Launch Services will remove the 'usro' resource entry and instead create a global binding which is stored in the com.apple.LaunchServices.plist (per-user preferences) file. Removing the 'usro' entry is done by using the Resource Manager functions, which will update the file's modification date. Note that while it does remove the 'usro' resource, it may not delete the entire resource fork. In most cases, 286 bytes will remain in the resource fork, which is basically the minimum amount of space taken up by the resource header and resource map.\n", "Q: Anti-virus comparison for Mac OS X This is not a \"I use OS X, do I need Anti-Virus?\" question. \nI am looking at comparison and user opinion of existing AV products.\nI know I can avoid most (if not all) threats by being careful on the sites I visit, and the emails I download. But I need an anti-virus, for a variety of reasons - mostly to prevent my Mac as a carrier for viruses. (Many friends' USB drives turn out to be infected).\nI was looking for the \"Best\" of the anti virus software out there.\nI am looking prominently at anti-virus. \"Internet Security\" and the like are not important, and would try to avoid them if it would save money or not make my mac slower.\nBy \"Best\" I mean the best combination of detect-rate (or whatever that is called) and performance. \nI don't intend to run it always in the background. Maybe I would do a onetime scan of my system and hard drives, and then it would be mostly on a need basis, especially on USB drives/portable hard disks of friends.\nSo primary objective: High Detect rate\nI have used Norton Antivirus for Mac and Virus Barrier (got this with one of those software bundles sometime before, not the latest version) and had problems with both. Both sometimes hog my CPU, and somehow \"lock\" my USB drives preventing me from Ejecting it (I had to force eject them or just pull them off from the port) (thought off late Norton seemed a little better)\nOk, thats a long one. But my question is simple: What anti-virus do you recommend for the Mac?\nThanks.\n\nA: ClamXav\nIt is open source and low resource consumption, but is not free.\nThere is also a free command line version available in brew, fink, and macports under clamav (less ugly).  There is some minor configuration, but there are decent guides on the ClamAV site and here, for example.\n\nA: I've personally used Sophos (Standalone version) and found that it causes high-memory utilization and some other file-system issues. (Updates on this one will bring your internet speeds to minimum).\nI find avast! much better. It's free and covers most basic of the environments. The only caveat is the the first scan takes longer (~55 min for me).\nI've also tried Avira, and I rather liked it. I've been using this for some time now and I gotta say it's very fast and easy to use.\nCheck this study by http://www.av-comparatives.org/ for comparison between different programs. http://www.av-comparatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mac_review_2013_en.pdf (Published last year)\nAlmost forgot about the Bitdefender. It is one of the best rated AV tools.\n\nA: The best free anti-virus software for OS X is Avira if you consider the software which has the least impact on system performance to be the best.\nThis is based off of a comparison of anti-virus softwares which was published on Sophos' website.\n\nThe original publication conducted by AV-Comparatives is available as a PDF download here.  It is a test of the impact of internet security software on system performance, unaffiliated with any software publisher, making it an unbiased comparison.\n\nAccording the the tests, there is 1 other application which is better than Avira; Eset, but they do not offer a free version of their software.  They do offer a free 30-day trial and a yearly subscription service of $39.99 for one computer.\n\nA: Sophos Anti-Virus for Mac Home Edition\n\nA: 2015 edit: No longer accurate, see other answers.\nClamXav is hard-written to never scan some files such as mp3. This made it entirely useless for me, as I was scanning music downloads. I found (but do not currently use) Panda to be the best, on Mac and Windows. It's effective, and in tests is one of the least-bogging-down.

I’ve used OnyX too, it’s very similar. \nThey are not a must, but Cocktail checks the S.M.A.R.T. status of the drives, executes the maintenance tasks in case you missed them too much, etc. The UNIX under the hood requires Unix maintenance. It’s true, the tools are not required but I’d have one (even if OnyX). Sometimes when you have problems, running the tasks (clearing caches, font caches, etc.) helps.\nA plus is that Cocktail (and possibly others) also check for “existing” trojans (there are only a handful). It’s all about having a tool that you can easily use to keep things clean. \nThe rest of the options are merely a nice graphical user interface to existing OS X commands, plus the ability to search for corrupted preference files, remove locked files, etc. Most of these things you can do without any utility, but it’s way faster this way unless you know the commands.\nI’ve used Cocktail for a few years (runs every Friday) and I restart my computer once a month (or when there’s an update) and never associated a problem with this. \n", "Q: What version of Mac Mini supports Leopard 10.5.8? Does Leopard 10.5.8 support the first-ever Mac Mini (M9686*/A, M9687*/A, I think)?\nOr do I need one of the later ones?\nI'm buying my first-ever mac this Christmas.\n\nA: Yes Leopard supports all Intel and all PowerPC based machines over a minimum CPU speed and the original Power PC minus are in that ranges. Apple doc\nSnow Leopard (10.6) only supports Intel based machines\n", "Q: Increasing fan speed of macbook pro is harmful? I wanted to know if increasing fan speed of macbook pro with applications such as CoreDuoTemp, smcFanControl or Fan Control is harmful or not. My macbook's cpu temp rises up to 80 degrees when I use ooVoo or mysql and I want to reduce it. Is it useful to use these applications to do that?\nthanx.\n\nA: I’ve used smcFanControl when I had a 1st Gen Macbook Pro 15’’. It’s not harmful in the sense that the fan is designed to be on, but of course, like any other mechanical device, the more you use it, the faster it wears out. If your Macbook Pro is getting too hot, try one of those utilities to see if it helps. In any case, getting a cooling pad is not a bad idea. Depending upon the type of work and conditions that you have, a Fanless may be enough.\nI believe the “best” fanless was the iLap. And for cooling pads with a Fan, you’ll have to see and trust the power of Google Shop. These generally use a USB port to drive a couple of Fans. Among the best features you can look for are the provision of an extra USB (so you don’t lose your port), portability if you move and sound level of the fans, whether they can be turned on/off, etc. \n\nA: yeah beacause gpu is located  top left  so... set fan controls default or manually spin up left fan 1.5X FASTER than right fan while playing games on windows 3100 for left and 4600-5000 is enough and really cool(heavy gaming ) else 4500 for game and right 2700rps should be enough! \n\nA: Just to add to this post (several years later), I've heard plenty about fan controller software being bad for the MBP, but have yet to see any documented evidence of this.  Would love to hear from anyone who has actually experienced fan breakdown from using a fan controller.  I personally use a controller and it works great -- fan stays silent most of the time, but ramps up when watching videos or gaming and my laptop is about 10 degrees cooler when stressed (checked with iStat).  \nAlso, I tried all of the highly rated laptop coolers (both fans and aluminum stands without fans) and did pretty rigorous testing with and without the fan -- no difference in temps at least for the MBP retina (probably because there is no large intake vent at the bottom like most laptops).  Also tried the thermapak cooling pad -- this didn't result in any change in temps according to iStat, but definitely does absorb heat (you can tell just by sitting on it).  I kept that just for novelty and maybe for sitting on at the beach.  \n", "Q: Using a Magic Trackpad and a USB mouse at the same time I know that the Magic Trackpad is not good for a few things (I personally don’t like trackpads in general too much when I’m on a laptop). I tend to start looking for a mouse. (18 years of mousing around may be too much for my old brain). \nHowever, there are certain things about the Magic Trackpad, that could be handy and that are virtually impossible with a mouse. I don’t like the Magic Mouse because you have to lift your “left button click finger” to perform a right click. (I’ve tried it for a while). \nSo I was thinking, has anyone connected a Magic Trackpad and a USB mouse at the same time, is it possible to have both (and working) and move the hand to either when needed?\nAnyone experienced this?\n\nA: Yes, this works. I have a Magic Trackpad and a Logitech MX Revolution (wireless, through a USB dongle) connected to my Mac at the same time and change between them at will. Have never had any problems with this setup - I even use it both at home and at work.\n", "Q: iPhone Jailbreaking and Unlocking What exactly does jailbreaking and unlocking doing to an iPhone? \nI'm aware that hackers are using baseband crashes for unlocking, but how are they exploiting these crashes? Even if they inject their code into memory, how they are keeping it even after a reboot? \nHow these guys finding the crashes? Can I find the crash log too? \nAs an iPhone developer, I'm interested in some technical answers.\nI've gone through some interesting links from here, but haven't found anything about how the hackers are doing it (especially unlocking).\nAny references will be extremely useful.\n\nA: Jailbreaking is the process of hacking the code signing mechanism to allow unsigned code to run on the phone. There are multiple tools used for this and they vary between both model and iOS version.\nUnlocking is the process of hacking the 3G chip's baseband to allow SIM cards from other networks without an official unlock from the carrier. There's also an alternative method called Subscriber Artificial Module (SAM) which creates a fake but slightly more authentic unlock from iTunes. I have never needed a hacked unlock (Australia has official carrier unlocks) so I don't know much more about it. Unlocking naturally needs a jailbreak to work, which is why the two are sometimes confused.\nIf you want a more technical answer you'll need to specify one or the other, as jailbreaking and unlocking are two entirely different types of hacks.\nI'd also advise against trying anything you don't completely understand because if you don't know what you're doing you're liable to make irreversible changes to your phone, especially when tampering with the baseband.\n\nA: Jailbreak allows installation of non apple approved apps. \nUnlock allows you to use iPhone with another cell phone company.\n", "Q: Is there a file copy utility for OS X that's similar to TeraCopy for Windows? On Windows, I use TeraCopy for improved file copying. Are there any similar equivalents for OS X?\nIn particular, I'd like to see things like copy speed.\n\nA: The best suggestions from this thread are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pathfinder\n\n*XFile\n\n*UltraCopier\n\n*MiniCopier\n\nA: Since you mentioned “better” and in particular “copy speed”, I believe the only answer is Xfile. Other than that, nothing will beat cp ;)\n\nThe world’s fastest file manager for OS X\n\nIt’s not free, quite the contrary. \n\nA: Try Ultracopier, looks a bit like TeraCopy and works on Mac & PC\n\nA: While much more than just a copy utility, Pathfinder shows copy speed. Along with Launchbar, it's one of my must have utilities.\n\nA: I know this question is nearly 12 years old and may be obsolete but there is actually official TeraCopy for Mac.\n\nA: An app I developed, Ultracopier, fits your use case.\nHere is a YouTube demo showcasing the PC version in action. \n\nA: I looked around for something like TeraCopy a while back but everything I found was pretty horrid.  In the end I decided to just use cp and rsync on the command line.\n\nA: Have you first compared speeds between TeraCopy and the built in Mac OS X file copy? I hate to sound like a generic condescending Mac user, but what exactly is wrong with the built in one?\n\nA: You may also consider Hedge for Mac tool. It's mostly for backup purposes and can be used to fast copy large files/folders. It has free version but most interesting features are to be paid.\n\nA: There is one application that I found online that works similar to TeraCopy, and that, too, is for Mac OS X and named Turbo Copy Pro.\nThis is a multi-function application and you can view the copy speed and also pause and resume the copy process similar to TeraCopy. The only drawback it has is that it is not free.\nI have tried and tested the trial version and it worked absolutely fine.

Other than setting up Emacs / Vim with ctags or cscope or both, are there alternatives to C++ code navigation of an existing code base? I used to use Source Insight on Windows and it worked for me fairly well. I know I can setup ctags or cscope but I was wondering if there is anything even better out there. The main functionality I am looking for is quickly find definition of variables and functions and places a function is being called.\n\nA: Is Xcode not what you're looking for ? It's the Mac OS X IDE. It'sn't installed by default, but is present on your Mac OS X DVD.\n\nA: TextMate and BBEdit have significant followings.  I'm personally a big fan of Smultron even though development has stopped.\n\nA: In Xcode:\n\nquickly find definition of variables\n  and functions\n\nRight-click the variable name in question, and select \"Jump to Definition\".\nCommand (apple button) + double click on the variable is a shortcut for the same thing.\n\nquickly find places a function is\n  being called\n\nRight-click the function name, and select \"Find in Project\" > \"As Text\".\n\nA: I have used Eclipse for C++ programming on OS X. \nXcode will compile things but is not that good at dealing with C++ namespaces it is more of a C and Objectve-C tool\n", "Q: Is there an iPad app that will 'play' a large PDF file as a slideshow? I'm looking for an iPad app that will 'play' a large PDF file as a slideshow.\nI've tried the major popular PDF apps, including GoodReader and ReaddleDocs, but none seem to have a 'slideshow' function.\nI've also looked into a few Music Notation viewers, but they all seem to require a screen tap to advance to the next page.\nIdeally, I want to be able to view a large, graphic-intensive PDF file and then hit 'PLAY' and have it auto advance it's pages.  Bonus points if you can zoom, or flip back/forward a page and then after preset interval, the slide show resumes.\n\nA: Presentations are meant to be presentations. If you're going to do the process that 3rdparty suggested, I highly advise that you convert the PDF into a presentation friendly format (jpgs are fine if you want to \"fudge\" it), but invest in Keynote for the iPad and use it!\nKeynote iPad's presentation skills are really astounding. Digital Laser Pointer, private presenter's notes on the iPad and the external display you connect to displays the full screen presentation (requires the VGA video out cable or some equivalent products, the composite/component video cables might work too). Transitions, animations, rich media, everything.\nIt sucks that you already have it in a PDF, but if you do the work to convert it, the iPad will help you present it wonderfully.\n\nA: One solution I've come up with may be to convert the PDF document to individual JPG images, then sync those 'photos' via iTunes.\nThey can then be viewed individually or as a slide show.\nCaveats are:\n\n\n*\n\n*limited resolution once iTunes downsamples the photos for syncing\n\n*slideshow stops once you zoom in or manually disrupt it: ideally would like it to automatically continue (hoping there is a better slide show app to do this...)\n\n\nA: mobile document viewer, \nmobile PDF notebook X1\n", "Q: How to get a list of all songs in iTunes? Is there an easy way to get a list of all my songs in iTunes into a text file?\n\nA: You can get a nice pdf with the content of your music library: hit ⌘P to open the print dialog, select \"Album list\" (I'm using a not english version of iTunes, son I'm not fully sure of the label, I mean the third radiobox from the top) and the \"Only text\" theme (the first option on the select field). Click \"Print...\" and then Save as PDF.\nThe resulting document is really nice:\n\n\nA: This is actually insanely simple:\nOpen iTunes and go into your music library.

I changed my \"full name\" to include my last name, but I'd like to revert back to just my first name. When I try to change the full name entry under \"accounts\" back to \"Richard\" I can't, with the warning \"Name is not available.\"\nWhat gives? Is there a way to revert to my original short name? This is strictly cosmetic, right? The only place I see my full name is the right side of the menu bar (my short name has never changed from \"richard\"). Thanks!\n\nA: The problem is that your short name is already richard, so your Users’ folder looks like /Users/richard. \nIf you want, you could change your short name (provided you’re in Leopard or Snow Leopard) or, not known to a lot of people is that you can create Aliases. \nFor example if your name is Robert De Niro Of The Great Canyon (wow!), and your account is robertdeniroofthegreatcanyon, you can create an alias to “robert”, to simplify. \nTo do that, in the Advanced Options screen, click the plus (+) button under Aliases and then type your desired account alias. (Do not make any other changes.) click OK and restart (just in case any service may be crazy). \nThis is easy and safe, but it doesn’t actually change your short name at all, nor your home folder among other things.\nIf you want to change your short user name, you have two different approaches. A less “intrusive” method (#1) and a full change (#2):\nOption #1: Change your short name, don’t change your home folder’s name.\nYou basically change your account’s name, but you leave your filesystem alone. Everything will work with your new name, but the files will be under the “old name”’s folder. \nThis works fairly well, except that sometimes, programs insist on storing settings based upon your short username, which could lead to some issues with those programs. \nHere’s how to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Automatic Login and FileVault if you have them (for the account you want to rename). You can later reactivate these.\n\n*Logoff completely from the account and login with another account (create one if you have to, you can remove it later).\n\n*ctrl + click on your account name, select advanced options.\n\n*In the “Account Name” field, delete your username and type the new one. Make sure the “home directory” stays the same as it was before, don’t change it.\n\n*Click ok. Restart. Login using your new short name.\n\n\nOption #2 Change both short name and home folder\nBear in mind that this, like the previous solution, has problems with some settings in certain programs/services that may use your /Users/old_name). You’ll have to check the settings for each and fix it (possibly reconfigure it). After you save the new settings for the programs, things should work ok.\nWarning: Time machine will go coo coo if you change your home folder and will have to backup every file again, because it tracks files using their paths. \n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Automatic Login and FileVault if you have them (for the account you want to rename). You can later reactivate these.\n\n*Logoff completely from the account and login with another account (create one if you have to, you can remove it later).\n\n*ctrl + click on your account name, select advanced options.\n\n*Like with option #1, change the name of your Account Name.\n\n*Change the Home Directory from /Users/old to /Users/new, where new is the short username you typed in step # 4. \n\n*Click OK and close all this, open a Terminal (/Application/Utilities/Terminal.app)\n\n*Type the following command, all on one line, and then press Return; when prompted, provide the password of the admin account you’re currently using, and then press Return again:\nsudo mv /Users/old /Users/new\n(these are the names from step 4 and 5).\n\n\n*restart!\n\n\nWhy all this trouble and where is the answer to your question?\nSo after all this, if you want to have robert in your “login menu” I believe you should simply tell it to show the short name and leave the rest of the settings alone:\n\nIn any case, if you REALLY want to have both “richard”, you’ll probably have to rename your shortname first.\n\nA: I may be missing something, but I believe I have the direct answer that you are looking for.  I, too changed my \"Full name\" only to find that I could not change it back.\nHere's how to fix it in one simple step: \nSystem Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Login Options -> Network Account Server: Join -> Open Directory Utility ->\nSelect 'Directory Editor' and at the top left, select 'Users' next to Viewing, click the lock allow write access.\nScroll down to your user name (richard) in the left pane, then select the row in the right pane named 'RealName'.  Finally, change the value of RealName in the bottom right pane:\n\nSave, get out of system preferences and go back in -- Voila, fixed.\n", "Q: Is it possible to add a note to a ToDo in Mail.app How can I add a Note to a ToDo? \nOr is there another way to add a paragraph or two to a ToDo to record progress. \nThe ToDo is linked to an email if that makes a difference.\n\nA: The only feature I was able to find is that in the list of ToDo items one can add a Notes column and enter text into there for each ToDo.\nTo add the Notes column to the list, view your list of ToDo's and then select the Notes item from View->Columns\nI couldn't find a way to view multi-line notes for a ToDo item, but I could type option-return to insert a return character.\n\nA: No, this is unfortunately not possible.\n", "Q: Iphone 4G Wifi Password Issues I recently replaced my wireless router from Verizon.

It correctly identifies the wifi network, and I'm prompted to enter my password.  But even though I've entered the password correctly multiple times, it always returns \"password incorrect\".  \n\nA: You could try this:\nGo to Settings -> common -> reset (at the bottom). On the next screen you can choose which settings you wish to reset.

The factor that determines this is the number of apps in the approval queue. I don’t remember where I read that 95% of the apps where approved within 14 days. I believe this came in a “message” in the dev accounts. But it was more than a year ago. \nYou can see more information in your Developer Account by going to the approval page. (You need a paid account to access that).\nI haven’t submitted an iPhone App but in my near experience, it’s around two weeks.\n\nA: I waited for 8 days with my first iPhone app. It was incredibly fast IMO. I guess the approval times depends on the type of app you are making and how well your app is put together.\n", "Q: Is there a PDF viewer with a vertical split screen feature? I have a very wide PDF and I would like to find a PDF viewer which would allow me to split the screen vertically so I can keep the left side the same while scrolling the right side back and forth.\nI found the application http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/, but it only allows one to split the screen horizontally.\nIs anyone aware of such a PDF viewer on the Mac?\n\nA: You can take a snapshot in Skim (File -> Take Snapshot), then using the wonderful ShiftIt move the snapshot and the main view of the pdf to the opposite sides of the screen (vertically) with just a few keystrokes. Or horizontally. Or to all four corners if you want.\n\nA: A quick look suggests that this feature does not exist in any PDF reader.\nOne responder on this forum [ http://is.gd/i0R12 ] believes that there are no such readers.\nMost of the links in this Google search [ http://is.gd/i0QQy ] are requesting such a feature be implemented in some reader, any reader.\n\nA: PDFpen 11 seems to support vertical split view of the same pdf.\nhttps://smilesoftware.com/pdfpen/entry/new-pdfpen-11-split-view-font-bar-and-for-pro-users-enhancements-to-interactive-form-creation-and-editing\n\n\nA: Here is a decent workaround streamlined from the hints in the comments to this question. In this example I use the PDF viewer Skim, but it should work the same with any other app.\n\nOpen Apple's Script Editor that is in the Applications/Utilities folder, and copy the following code. \non run\n    do shell script \"open -n /Applications/Skim.app\"\n    tell application \"Skim\" to activate\nend run\n\non open theFiles\n    repeat with theFile in theFiles\n        do shell script \"open -na /Applications/Skim.app \" & quote & (POSIX path of theFile) & quote\n    end repeat\n    tell application \"Skim\" to activate\nend open\n\nSave it as an application. Now every time you drag a PDF into the icon, a new instance of Skim will open. I like to use OSX's native split-full-screen view.\n\nI found this script online a long time ago and I don't remember where.

I'm wondering about the feasibility of using my iMac's built-in bluetooth as a source for keyboard input to my iphone. \nThere are times I want to type longer messages in my iphone, i keep a bluetooth keyboard around just to have a full sized keyboard to use on the iphone. I don't use the keyboard on my iMac because I have an ergonomic keyboard there that I much prefer. What I think would be great is to use that corded ergonomic keyboard as an input to the iphone via a bluetooth device that uses the iMac.\nAny thoughts on this?\n\nA: There are apps in App Store: iKeyboard ($9.99), Type2Phone ($9.99), 1Keyboard ($9.99) and Typeeto ($4.99) that allow to use your Mac's keyboard as Bluetooth keyboard. The obvious requirements are Mac with Bluetooth and recent OS X.\n\nA: 2017 Edit: As mentioned in other (newer) answers, there are iPhone apps available that can act as Bluetooth keyboards from the Mac. I've been using Typeeto myself. My original answer should be considered quite out of date now.\nI'd recommend using the dedicated Bluetooth keyboard if it's not too much hassle, as it's currently the most elegant solution.\nIf you really want to type from the iMac though, you'll need a Jailbroken iPhone. There is a VNC server called \"Veency\" available from Cydia. You'll then need a VNC client for the iMac (I use JollysFastVNC myself). The iMac and iPhone also need to be networked via either Wifi or Bluetooth LAN.\nYou'll want to ignore the video and just look at the iPhone's screen while typing, because it lags heavily.\nI would love to have something more elegant to suggest, but other mouse/keyboard-only solutions like Synergy or Teleport are Desktop/Notebook only at the moment.\n\nA: If your iPhone is jailbroken, you can install a BlueTooth driver that supports external keyboards.\n\nA: Try 1Keyboard for Mac\nType on your iPhone, iPad or Apple TV using your Mac's keyboard.\nTurn your Mac into a Bluetooth keyboard that works with all of your devices.\n\n(source: eyalw.com) \n\nA: I've just installed Typeeto today and it seems to work really well.

I have a couple folders in my Finder's sidebar. Since they're nested (on the actual file system), the names aren't very descriptive. Is there a way I can change the name of the entry in the sidebar without changing the actual name of the folder?\n\nA: This was possible in Tiger (As far as I can remember or Leopard) but on Snow Leopard, the “alias” is automatically resolved. \nIf you create an Alias on your desktop for a folder XYZ and then drag the Alias onto your sidebar, it’s automatically resolved. So it doesn’t seem to be possible to override this.\n", "Q: Always show photos full-screen on iOS? In the Photos app on my iPod Touch, when I'm scrolling through photos, it always makes \"up\" = the orientation of the device, even if that doesn't match the orientation of the photo.  So half the time, the photo takes up only half the pixels on the screen, and the other half are just black, and I have to rotate the device, and it takes a couple seconds to realize this and rotate the display.\nIs there any way to make iOS/Photos always show photos full-screen, even when that doesn't match the current orientation of the device?\n\nA: Simply put, no.\nSorry!\nThere may be some jailbreak hack for this issue that I am unaware of, but there is no way to accomplish what you are asking with Apple's iOS and the Photos app on the iPhone/iPod Touch.\n\nA: What I tried was to rotate all the landscape pictures in portrait mode so they use all the screen.\nThe issue is that you then have to rotate your head as rotating the iPod will rotate the picture and you start again the same problem! :) Not very convenient then.\nYou have to find an application which will deactivate the automatic screen rotation and this should then work. It needs extra work upfront though.\nAs you already figured out, the best way would be to find a 3rd party application doing this automatically but, as Alex said, I'm quite doubtful it exists at the moment.

Dictionary functionality is available in any app that allows you to select text. Just highlight the text as if you were going to do a Copy and you will see a \"Define\" option next to \"Copy\". Tap \"Define\" and you get a pop-up window with the definition from the same dictionary built in to iBooks.\n\nA: Are you asking about a jailbreak app?\nThe official build of Apple's iOS does not support this functionality.\nThe best you can do is copy and paste the word and then search Google for the definition.

I have a MacBook Pro (about 18mts old) which has recently started to inexplicably die without warning. I'm running it on battery and, yes, it's getting close to the bottom end (between 10 and 25%). In the past I would get to about 10 minutes of life left and the \"Reserve Battery\" warning dialog would pop up and let me know that I'd better get on the adapter. \nNot any more.\nNow it gets to about 25% and then plik! it's black screen and dead. Instantly. No warning, nothing. \nSome details about the Mac\n\n\n*\n\n*Hardware: 2.5Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo 4Gb, 667Mhz DDR2 SDRAM\n\n*Software: 10.5.8\n\n*Model: 4.1\n\n*Boot ROM: MBP4.1.00C1.B03\n\n\nFollowing advice from @Alex, I've checked the system logs (Console) and disk verification tool (Disk Utility) but they both come up clean. Apart from the instant death at low battery, there are no other dubious intermittent faults.\nEdit to cover suggestions so far\nMany thanks to all who have taken the time to address this issue. I've summarised the answers so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look at the battery cycle count (About this Mac | More Info | Hardware - Power - Battery Information) - @glenstorey\n\n*Recalibrate the battery - @Lawrence Velázquez\n\n*Check hardware (RAM seating, hard disk etc) - @Alex\n\n\nFinal result\nThe whole thing about battery cycles being guaranteed by Apple appears to be a myth (at least the bods at my Apple Store were unaware of it). So I changed the battery and all was fixed. Back to normal.\n\nA: Check to see how many cycles your battery has done (System Profiler - Power - Cycle Count); from what I understand your battery will still be under warranty if it has less than 300 - more than 300 and it's on its way out. We have a whole bunch of MacBooks (Pros) here, and once in a while one of them does this exact thing when the battery gets old and tired, just like yours. \nI've had batteries that have lasted 40 months, and some that have only lasted 18, the newer MacBooks with the non-removable batteries last a lot longer.\n\nA: In addition to what has already been said, it’s possible that your battery may be miscalibrated. If true, this would explain why your computer runs out of charge, even though it thinks otherwise.\nI would strongly suggest trying to recalibrate your battery before doing anything else. Instructions can be found in this Apple support article. In a nutshell:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug the computer in until it thinks the battery is fully charged.\n\n*Let the battery rest in the fully-charged state for at least 2 hours.\n\n*Unplug and run the computer on battery until the battery is exhausted and the computer goes to sleep.\n\n*Let the computer sleep for at least 5 hours. I believe this is to drain the battery of its reserve charge.\n\n*Plug the computer in again until the battery is fully charged.\n\n\nYou can use the computer during every step except #4.\nIf this doesn’t produce results for you, then resort to other options.\n\nA: Is it under warranty with Apple Care? If so, have you tried getting your battery replaced to see if it's the battery? Personally, I wouldn't kill yourself troubleshooting this anymore until you have tested the battery and it's ability to hold a charge. Let me know!\nOther things you can try are opening your MacBook and making sure your RAM cards are securely in place by removing them and setting them back in.\nAlso run a disk utility and make sure your drive is passing all tests.\nMacBooks (and Apple laptops in general) are notorious for logic board failures. Make sure you review your system logs in the Console and the status of the disk utility to make sure everything is running smoothly.\n", "Q: troubleshooting connections issue between two macs I often want to move files between my MacBook and iMac, but its such an issue that I usually resort to failure. They will see each-other on the network (shown in Finder) but after selecting the machine and waiting a while there will be a message like \"connection filed\" or similar. The other MacBook in the house doesn't even show on this list at all. So I am wondering is there a secret to getting networking happening, or at least something I can use to troubleshoot these issues?\n\nA: First, make sure File Sharing is on for both computers. Then connect an Ethernet cable directly between the two machines. Each machine should appear in the other's sidebar of the Finder. Connect to it by double-clicking (login using your credentials if needed), and then drag your files or folders across at 1Gbps!\nLater,\nMike\n\nA: How strong is your connection?  I assume you're using wifi on the MacBook?  I used to have a lot of issues with this kind of thing until I replaced my wireless router.\n\nA: Either give them both static IP's on the interfaces that are linked with each other, or wait for them both to grab 169.254.x.x IP's.  Also make sure firewalls are down or in a \"half\" state (in Snow Leopard, at least, there's a \"firewall on\" mode as well as a \"block ALL connections\" mode - firewall on works well for me, and still offers protection without hindrance.)\nFailing that try pinging one from the other, and vice versa.  Might have a hardware problem.  I would also disable any other interfaces except for the ethernet ones that you're using to connect them to each other.\n", "Q: How to recover an iPod Classic that won't turn on and doesn't appear as a drive? A friend of mine asked for help with an iPod Classic that isn't working.\nIt is an 80GB iPod Classic, model A1238, that doesn't give any signs of still being alive. It won't beep or light the screen, doesn't matters what I try.\nI have tried to reset it (turn the hold switch on/off and then hold the middle and menu button) but it did nothing, and so I couldn't put it in disk mode either.\nRight now I'm trying to charge it from a power adapter, but I don't expect it to help.\nI had already tried to charge it from a PC, and from a MacBook Pro.\nAnything else I could try, before sending it to repair?\n\nA: Here's something that worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put the iPod into a ziploc bag and seal it tightly.\n\n*Put it in the freezer overnight.\n\n*Take it out in the morning.\n\n\nI thought that it was just an urban myth, but as the iPod was apparently dead, why not try it? I was (pleasantly!) shocked to see it start up again the next morning.\n\nA: Assuming that you've tried resetting while the iPod is connected to a power source, there's really not much else that can be done. The Apple Store, or an Authorized Apple Service Provider, is pretty much your only option at this point.\nAlso, how long has the iPod been doing this? If it was subject to extreme conditions for an extensive amount of time, or if it suffered liquid damage, it may be broken beyond repair (or repair may be cost-prohibitive, assuming it's no longer under warranty).\n", "Q: Flash plugin crashes frequently In various websites, at random times and with no apparent pattern, the Flash plugin will crash. This has occurred in every browser, and I typically have at least one crash a day. According to Mozilla's plugin check I have the latest version of Flash (10.1.102.64)\nThis is a new MacBook Pro (17\", 2010 unibody version) running fully updated Mac OS X 10.6.5.\nDoes the plugin just crash for everyone, or is this unique to me? How often does Flash crash for you? Is there anything I can check, or is there a way I can reinstall Flash or some other diagnosis I can run? I haven't been experiencing other issues with my computer or my browser.\n\nA: There's a reason why Apple appears to onlookers to be so anti-Flash, and it's because Flash sucks on Macs (it may also suck on other OSs, but I don't use them enough to be knowledgeable). \nWhat to do about it depends on what browser you use (your question doesn't say, as Mozilla's Plugin Check isn't FF-only):\n\n\n*\n\n*Safari - the answer is ClickToFlash. Honestly, C2F is something that should just come pre-installed on every Mac.\n\n*Firefox/Camino - As Ken mentioned in a comment, you want the FlashBlock extension.\n\n*Chrome - use the FlashBlock for Chrome extension.\n\n\nAs has already been said: you can get along fine on almost all sites without Flash. Here's some additional recommended reading, both of which are from John Gruber at Daring Fireball:\n\n\n*\n\n*Going Flash-Free on Mac OS X, and How to Cheat When You Need It\n\n*Masquerading as Mobile Safari to Get Websites to Serve HTML5 Video to Safari on Mac OS X\n\nA: Flash on the Mac is the single-largest cause of Safari crashes. That's just the way it is.\n\nA: Flash crashed so often for me, I have gone flash free and only use flash in Google Chrome browser. Google installs flash within that one app, updates flash behind the scenes and Safari hasn't crashed once in 6 months.\nI would recommend three useful and stable Safari extensions if you disable flash in Safari:\n\n\n*\n\n*YouTube5\n\n*HTML5 Audio\n\n*H.264 Flickr Video\n\n\n\n\nA: I recently found FlashVideoReplacer for Firefox.  It replaces Flash videos with native players like Quicktime when available.  Flash is a CPU killer for me, so this helps.\n", "Q: Using a US-bought WiFi iPad in the UK with the AppStore? I'm looking to give a WiFi-only iPad to a family member as a gift this Christmas. However, I'm concerned that since I am located in the UK, and the device I purchase will be 'US' configured for the store, etc, I will be unable to configure it to work correctly as a UK iPad, with the correct iTunes store, etc.\nIs the iTunes store (app, music, video) related to the device software, the network it's accessing from, or the locale of the iTunes account associated with that device?\n\nA: The iTunes store is related to the locale of the iTunes account (which is determined by the credit card associated with the account). Several friends of mine have bought iPads in other countries (US and UK) and are happily using them in Sweden with the Swedish iTunes store.\n\nA: Specifically, the locale of the iTunes account is determined by the country of your associated credit card (or gift card). \nIf you entered a UK credit card in your iTunes account, then iTuens will show you only content released in the UK. This is true regardless where the device was bought, and regardless what regional settings and UI language is used.\n", "Q: Application for managing a pdf document library I'm looking for an application that can help manage a library of pdf documents.  I prefer open source (or just free beer), but that's not absolutely essential.\nI am aware of calibre and use it often for my ebooks, including those in pdf format.  However, I'd like something for more general purpose use, especially PDFs that are largely - or entirely - graphics based, or contain small amounts of text (like keyboard shortcut reference cards and the like, research papers, and the like).\nEasy management of metadata, search and filter, and easy access to the files from an application interface are the other main requirements.  I don't need any device-sync or transfer capabilities, all the documents in this library would reside only on my MBP.\nAnything out there that would be useful in this context?\n\nA: BibDesk (free)\nis free, does everything you describe, and integrates well with LaTeX.\n\nA: Papers2 ($79 for Mac and another 15$ for iPad extension)\nDoes what you want, but is not free, and does not have as good integration with LaTeX. Papers does have support for iPhone/iPad devices (at extra cost).\n\nA: Yep (39$)\nIt handles the job of document management pretty well. \nI have a license and it’s really good at finding all the PDF mess that I have scattered. Then the reading feature and the loupe are nice. They have a trial.\n\nA: FingerPDF\nIt is particularly suited for PDF Technical Books, Magazines and Papers\n\nA: DEVONthink\nAfter a hundred years of research I decided on DEVONthink Pro Office for my academic workflow.\nI recommend that you don't simply compare the features of the software listed here, but google around for how other people in your field use these apps. It will give you a better idea of what you actually want without trying them all.\n\nA: Calibre (free/open-source)\nConsidering its price and features, Calibre should be #1 choice. Still I encountered two important limitations:\n\n\n*\n\n*files are stored in a directory structure that you cannot control, root\\Authors\\Paper. This does make the sharing of this folder with solutions like Dropbox really hard to use.\n\n*the GUI is ugly like ** and not so intuitive\n\n\nPlease remember that these were the bad points, in addition it has tons of \"good points\".\n\nA: Evernote\nIt's free unless you need one of their premium features.\nSadly, doing an OCR pass on uploaded PDFs is one of their premium features, but there are a couple of workarounds: you can either OCR your PDF before uploading it to EN, or upload JPGs instead of PDFs (as Evernote OCRs JPGs).\nAnd speaking from experience: even if you think that you'll only need your files at your MBP, you might be surprised how often it's darn handy to have them all available in the cloud.\n\nA: Sente\nNot free, but IMHO has far more functionality and customizability than Papers.  (I've used both.)\n", "Q: Should I avoid booting my MacBook if it's really cold? As the title says; if my MacBook has been exposed to minus degrees, should I wait for it to reach room temperature before I boot it or am I just paranoid and have nothing to worry about?\n\nA: It depends how “minus”. In general, li-on batteries live longer if you respect their acceptable operating temperatures. In the case of your Macbook Pro, Apple has a dedicated page with tips about Battery Maintenance. \nIf you observe the temperature graph on the left, the Minus degrees are not in the “I like this” zone. \nTruth is, your MBP will get warm relatively fast, but if your MBP is at 0ºC, I’d wait a little bit. At those temperatures, depending upon the dew point and the humidity (among other factors) the risk of running moisture is higher, especially if the MBP will start heating fast when you turn it on. \nJust let the machine heat for a few minutes at room temperature to be safe. Of course, if you have to use it one day, the battery is not going to die on you. Remember, extreme temperatures are enemies of batteries!\nThe cold Swedish tundra is not a friendly place for a Li-on battery :)\n", "Q: Where's iOS 4.2 image file? On Apple Developers portal, under downloads I get this:\n\nWhere are the iPhone 3G / 4 / iPad versions of the OS?\nAs I had beta 2 on my iPad (I'm have a iOS developer account), and I want to update to the new one, iTunes says iPad has version 4.2 (witch is right, 4.2b) and mentions, that there is no newer version.\n\nA: got it here\nhttp://tipsneeded.com/download-ios-42-ipsw/\nweird that is not available in the Portal itself :(\n\nA: 4.2.1 is the newest version, and it's no longer in beta. So that means you get it through iTunes, by syncing your device and clicking the \"Check for Update\" button. There won't be images in the Developer Portal until Apple decides to put the next version of iOS (4.3?) into beta.\n\nA: An iOS image file (also called IPSW short for iPhone Software file) for publicly released version of iOS can be obtained unofficially from IPSW.\nThe OS images are signed and verified with Apple servers when attempting a restore via iTunes. Do note that Apple stops signing older releases sometime (usually a couple weeks) after releasing a new iOS update. Hence, this method can be used to restore an iOS device to latest public release of iOS in cases as the one discussed in the question.\n", "Q: Is reassigning or disabling short-key possible? The finder has the Command-H assigned to 'hide finder'. Can I reassign the key to something else? Or can I disable the Command-H short key to hide finder only through menu?\n\nA: Yes you can.\nOpen System Preferences, Keyboard. Click the Keyboard Shortcuts tab at the top. In the left pane, select Application Shortcuts. In the right pane, select Finder.app. Click the + at the bottom of this pane. For Menu Title, type the exact wording / spelling of the menu item in question: in this case Hide Finder. For Keyboard Shortcut, pick another keystroke combination to hide the finder (I use function key F1). Voila. Now go to Finder and look at the Finder menu; beside Hide Finder should be F1 (or whatever you chose).\n\nA: You can also assign a shortcut to something like the NUL control character by editing the property list directly.\ndefaults write com.apple.finder NSUserKeyEquivalents '{\"Hide Finder\"=\"\\0\";}'\n\nIf a shortcut was assigned to nil, it would be shown as N in System Preferences and pressing L would trigger it in some applications like Audacity.\n", "Q: iPhone app that shows app usage statistics? I'm looking for an app that can tell me how much time I spend on each installed iPhone app. This would be useful for identifying apps I really should delete, and also \"lite\" apps I really should purchase.\nI know such programs existed for Palm devices. They simply looked at the clock whenever the device was turned on & off and whenever a program switch occurred (because the OS provided easy hooks for this), then just calculated running times from these timestamps.\nPS: I realize that such an app must by nature be in Cydia, because non-jailbroken devices don't reveal such useful information. --> This fact can't be a reason to close this question!\n\nA: Cydia's App Stat does exactly what you've requested. As far as I can tell, it exists since April 1st:\n\nNew Tweak in Cydia, App Stat, shows you your app usage statistics, frequecy of use, use of time and recent use. Supports IPhone, IPod Touch, IPad running IOS 3.2 or later. Free on Cydia Search for it.\n\n\nA: I did some research and I don't think an app that does this is available, even on Cydia.\nThe only information related to app usage stats that I've been able to find is the information that developers can get from their own apps, as explained in this question on StackOverflow\n", "Q: My apps are using 3.7GB of storage on my iPad, how can I check which app is using what amount? Is there a breakdown that can be viewed somewhere?\n\nA: On iTunes itself, on the App section of your Library (top section in the left side navigation bar) you can see how big Apps are by switching to List view (iTunes menu bar -> View -> As List).\n\nA: On the iPad If you go to Settings -> General -> Usage and a list of your apps will pop up right there, along with the amount of storage that they're taking up. \n", "Q: Differences between Snow Leopard Server and Desktop? I have a friend who is wanting to get a Mac Mini to do iPad development.  He says the server version is cheaper than the desktop version.  I've only ever used the desktop version.  Is there any reason not to get the server version?  What are the main differences between Server and Desktop?\n\nA: First off he's wrong on all levels.\nThe Desktop Version is $29, the Server Version is $500.\nA standard Mac Mini is $700 base. Mac Mini Server is $1000 base.\nSecond, the distributions are pretty much identical. The difference is that the Server Version ships the server applications, tools, and processes. Postfix, Dovecot, Jabberd2, OpenLDAP, the entirety of the /Applications/Server directory, and some of the things in /Applications/Utilites like XSan management and the RAID Utility.\nIf he's looking to do development for iOS, getting the server version makes no sense. If he's looking to do development for Web Services, it's still easier and cheaper to run it on the Desktop version.\nIf he's looking to run a server, trivially, for mail services, chat and calendaring services, MORE than just web services (web services are trivially easy on the Desktop Version), then he should get a MacMini Server.\nUse a Server for a Server for the features it provides, otherwise, use a standard version.\n[edit]\nWe have two versions of XServes, and two Mac Mini Servers (classic style body), I'd be glad to answer any additional questions you or your friend has.\n", "Q: Screen video capture application I am Looking for a program that let's me capture screen videos on Mac OS X.\nI am requesting it for these two use cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*Capture of a webcam. It should allow capturing only the webcam App window.\n\n*Creation of program tutorials. Ideally, it should allow mouse cursor magnification and visual click representation (like, making some visual effect when you click on anything).\nA different program for each case use is fine if there is not a program that can do both.\n\nA: I've found that \"New Screen Recording\" functionality in QuickTime Player combined with iMovie editing capabilities is enough for my needs. Maybe you can give it a try? Best of all, it's already installed on your Mac. Unfortunately, I can't compare it with Camtasia, as I haven't used it.\n\nA: After some research I've learnt that for the second use case you can use a separate program that does mouse magnification and keystroke detection in conjunction with a regular screen recording program like Quicktime Player (included on Mac OS X). Mouseposé seems the most recommended one.\nAs for a standalone screen capture program that has more features than Quicktime Player, I've found four that are maybe the most widely used ones:\n\n\n*\n\n*ScreenFlow \n\n*Camtasia for Mac\n\n*iShowU\n\n*Snapz Pro X\nScreenFlow offers mouse cursor customization, and iShowU offers keystroke and mouse action recording, for showing in the video. ScreenFlow, iShowYou and Camtasia are looking great. Snapz Pro X seems more focused to regular screenshot capturing, but does video as well.\n\nA: There's a question about recording the screen of an OpenGL application without stuttering here at StackExchange.\n\nA: My firsthand experience with ScreenFlow has been great for creating tutorials. It includes cursor magnification, cursor and window highlighting, etc., and a decent editor.\nI agree that Camtasia looks great, too, but I've not tried it.\n\nA: If it comes down to choosing between Camstasia for Mac and Screenflow, here's a side by side comparison: http://www.skillcasting.com/comparison-camtasia-mac-vs-screenflow/\n\nA: Try Jing. Free version have no cam support, but if you really need it there's a pro version for $14.90 / year. Great app, mac style.\n\nA: In 2018, Mojave introduced a new shortcut to do screen recordings.\ncmd + shift + 5\nIn the options you can choose to show mouse clicks (or not).\nAnd you can select a portion of the screen to record if you don't want it all.\n\nA: I can tell you undoubtedly that there is one piece of software that is the cream of the crop when it comes to video recording on Mac. And it's FREE!\nOBS Studio - https://obsproject.com/\nI've tried many screen recorders, most of them have limited trials unless you buy the full version of the software.\nAnd many of them (including QuickTime) save in .mov format with bad transcoding resulting in huge file sizes. OBS videos are tiny even in crisp HD.\nWhat also makes OBS really great is that you can add different scenes with different video and audio sources and seamlessly swap between your monitor recording built-in auto and swap to your webcam using external microphone audio.\nYou can also live stream directly from OBS.\nDid I mention it's FREE!\n", "Q: Can I transmit audio from iPhone to Mac via a Bluetooth A2DP profile? Is there any way to connect my iPhone 4 to my Mac Mini via Bluetooth so that I can play music on my iPhone and hear it on the speakers connected to my Mac?\nWhen I try to connect to my computer via my iPhone's Bluetooth screen, it says \"Connection Unsuccessful: 'My Mac mini' is not supported.\" However, if I take a look at the Bluetooth page in the system preferences of my Mac, I see that the following two services are listed for my iPhone: Audio Source and AVRCP Device (I had to enable the \"Show More Info\" option to see these).\n\nA: While browsing the this site, I found a link to another answer that might be useful. So, it looks like a Sony Ericsson MBR-100 wireless dongle attached to the computer should do the trick. I've never used it (or even heard of it before today) but it sounds like it should work. \nThe reason the computer doesn't work is that both the computer support the A2DP profile but both as a server but not as a receiver. There might be a software solution to get the Mac to support A2DP as a client but I don't know of one.\nAnother option which doesn't quite do what you want but might be useful would be to use the Remote app on your iPhone to control your iTunes library remotely. This allows you to uses the iPhone as a remote control for your iTunes. \n\nA: Airfoil now has this feature. Turn on Airfoil Speakers 4.5 or later on your Mac, with Wi-fi turned on on both Mac and iPhone. In your music player app, click the airplay button and choose the name of your Mac. Audio from your iPhone music player app will be input to your Mac.\n\nA: AirFoil works fo this, although when I've used it there is a 1-2 second lag, making it impractical for realtime use, but good for streaming music.\n\nA: Over bluetooth might be a little hard. But why not over Wifi (You can also have an Ad Hoc connection between your Mac and the iPhone)? Then you could even use an Air Play cilent on the Mac to 'push' content form your iPhone to the mac. I have tried AirPlayer with limited success, but I am sure the newer versions would be much better.\n\nA: I use 5K Player, and this provides a Airplay receiver which you can run on your Mac to Airplay from iOS devices.\n", "Q: View metadata for song currently playing on iPhone Is there any way to view metadata (such as composer, genre, year etc) for a song that is currently playing on an iPhone?\nIf there is no way to do so, and no apps which can do this, does the iOS API allow access to this information (i.e. could I write an app to do this myself)?\n\nA: Looks like many apps do this. Look at FlickTunes, for instance, which allows you to use gestures to control playback. Or TuneWiki, which tries to look up the lyrics for the current song. So I assume the API is there and you could write an app that displays this metadata.\n", "Q: How can I extract the audio from a video file? I have a video of a music performance that I downloaded online, and want to extract the audio so that I can store it as a music file. It's a MOV file with the Codecs - \"XVID, MPEG Layer 3.\" What software should I use for best results?\n\nA: I can't tell you about best results, but for some results:\nVLC, FFMPEG, or MPLAYER\nVLC has a GUI and a Wizard. ffmpeg and mplayer example here.\n\nA: If it is a MOV file which you can open with QuickTime Player, open it QuickTime Player 7, an optional install in Snow Leopard, and then go to File -> Export, and choose Sound to AIFF for instance. The resulting AIFF file can me converted back to MP3 or AAC with iTunes, for instance.\n\nA: Wound up using Audio Hijack Pro for this, was incredibly simple.\n", "Q: Caffeine taking up 2.88GB virtual memory \nCaffeine is a small program. Why is it taking up so much virtual memory or am I reading this wrong?\nEdit: persists across application and os restarts\n\nA: So apparently I was reading it wrong. According to Thomas Franzén ( lightheadsw )\n\nVirtual memory size is a meaningless\n  number for most uses. An application\n  having a big virtual memory size\n  doesn't affect you, because it's just\n  a virtual memory space. The column you\n  should be looking at is RSIZE. That's\n  the actual amount of physical RAM an\n  application is using.\n\nI verified with ObjectAlloc and it seems like it is using only 8MB or so.\n\n\nA: On my machine, it's using 30.2 MB, so you're right that yours is doing something out of the ordinary.\nWhen you reboot, does it start at a lower number, or immediately jump to this level?\nDo you usually have it clicked? (I don't)\nIs it adding any messages to your console log?\nWhat version of Caffeine are you running?\n", "Q: Is the 3G data rate slower when reception is poorer? At work, my iPhone gets only limited 3G signal. The \"3G\" indicator is there, but the signal strength is only 1 or 2 out of 5 bars. Is the download throughput less under these circumstances, compared with the full 5 bars?\n\nA: Short Version: Yes but it largely depends.\nWhy?: 3G networks travel through air and are subject to interference (as any microwave, radio wave, etcetera). Just like a Wi-Fi network, the principle is the same (only 3G requires a stronger signal from the iPhone, hence why 3G drains more battery, the distances in 3G are measured in miles/Km), as opposed to the limited range of a 11n network). When you are far, the distance for the wave to travel is more and therefore is subject to signal degradation, interference, etc. \nAll these nuisances in the signal travel, cause more packages that need to be resent, which increases the response time and the amount of information that must be transferred.\nSay you request an image, the server gets the request and starts sending data. The signal is low, so the reception is bad, your iPhone keeps saying: what? say again… I didn’t hear the last part…\nTo put a real life example: If you’re talking 5 feet away from a person, you can understand hear him ok, provided the ambient noise is low. Now add some noise… you need to talk louder and sometimes you need to request for the other person to repeat because you didn’t hear. \nNow put that person 50feet away…\nYou’re starting to get an idea. \nNow we have to add another real factor:\n3G towers could be a few miles away from you, and there could be a few, so the phone must try to find the strongest one, this process is also time consuming and it causes so many packages to be dropped. When something is dropped, it must be resent… \nAll in all, it really depends. You might have a low signal, but a decent throughput, but think that the weakness in the signal is making it harder for your phone to communicate.\nThink that wireless connections, need to be as stable as possible to work, and in order to do that, they reduce the speed on purpose. I.e.: send less, but stronger. \nNow I don’t have graphs or numbers (nor the real knowledge to be honest) to explain you how the whole 3G works and what is really involved, but having worked with a driver for a wifi modem, I know about the compromise of the stack to “slow down” when the strength of the signal is bad. You have a limited bandwidth and a limited strength, you have to balance. Wireless prefers strength over speed (which I understand) ;)\n", "Q: Should I use 32 or 64bit Mac OS X apps? I have a 64bit Intel Core 2 Duo MacBook Pro. A lot of times, software that I want to use is offered in both 32 and 64 bit.\nWhat version should I prefer?\nI know that even some Apple's apps are not yet 64bit - I guess this means something. I also have read that there is no big difference except for maybe driver software. What do you think?\n\nA: You should go for the 64bit version. Apple is more and more leaning towards 64 bit adoption.  \nIn the end, unless it's some heavy processing application, you won't even feel the difference with the 32bit version. But at least you'll be ready for the future :)\n", "Q: Swap X and Y axes in Numbers? I'm taking an economics course, and for whatever reason economists create graphs with the independent variable (price) on the Y axis and not the X axis. If I only have 1 dependent variable to graph, it's pretty easy just to swap the two, but I need to create a graph with price as the independent variable on the Y axis with multiple dependent variables on the X axis. Is this possible in Numbers?\n\n\nA: I’ve noticed a button you don’t have. What version of Numbers do you have? (I have 09)\nLook at this:\n\nThat swaps the columns in the graph (exactly like you describe). I’m not really very good at Numbers.\nDo you have that? One thing I’ve done, is used the price as a “column” but maybe that’s why you don’t have it?\nMy graphic looks awesome (sarcasm)…\n(btw I hadn’t saved it and had to do it again)\n\n\nA: You can build your own transpose function using the index command:\n\nThe transpose cells all contain this: \n\n", "Q: How do I disable Ping? Although I do like and enjoy using iTunes, I'm not a fan of the new Ping service that Apple has embedded into it. \nIs it possible to disable the Ping link under \"Store\", the Ping sidebar, and the Ping buttons next to each song?

If I have 2.6 and 3.0 on my Mac, where to the library for easy_install is installed?\n\n*Is there any easy way to make python point to 2.6 or 3.0?\n\n\nA: There are several ways to install Python and which way affects the later answers.\nIn all cases you should install a later Python 3 version - 3.1.3 is the latest released version. For choosing which to run I would call python3.1 or python2.6 to be explicit as the language differs enough that the code is specific to the 2.x or 3.x branches. In fact much code starts with the #!/usr/bin/env python line but is 2.x specific. I would say that having the python executable on your path being linked to python3.1 would be a problem Apple scripts that use python always look for /usr/bin/python so will always find the Apple version and not a properly installed other version.\neasy_install is from an external package setuptools and you can tell setup.py where to put it.\nSimplest is install from the python.org installer This will give a python3 executable in /usr/local/bin (and possibly python as well). In this case I would create a python symbolic link in ~/bin (pointing to the apple python or python3 and you can switch where it points as you require without sudo which a link in /usr/local/bin would require.\nIn this case I think easy_install for python3 will by default end up in /usr/local/bin and the apple one is in /usr/bin\nI use macports versions and they install in /opt/local and have a script port select that will switch /opt/local/bin/python between the 3.1 or 2.6 versions (or any others you have installed) - unfortunately not does not do this for  easy_install which is in  /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin (or 3.1 etc)\n", "Q: Navigate through application that have windows shortcut cmd+tab navigates through all open applications.\nSome Apps can have no windows at all e.g. firefox, finder.\nIs there a shortcut for navigating through only applications that have at least one window?\n\nA: The closest built-in option in OS X is to launch Expose which shows all open windows, then hit the tab key to cycle through all open apps.

Whenever I want to listen to songs from a particular band in iTunes, I'll just type the name in the search box, select shuffle, and start playing. For most bands this works very well, but I've run into a few situations where I'm unable to narrow it down to a single band due to the fact that the name of the band I'm looking for is a subset of the name of a different band. A classic example is \"The Who\" - every time I type \"the who\" in my search bar I get \"The Guess Who\" as well.\nI've tried some of the basic tricks like using quotes or minus symbols but nothing seems to work. Is there a way to do this, or do I have to create special playlists for these problem bands?\n\nA: iTunes doesn’t seem to exhibit any sort of smart searching built into the search box. Possibly, the best way to deal with these things is to use an external tool.\nIn my case, I have Coversutra (not free), that allows you to press “tab” (can be changed) to select different things:\n\nI know there are free alternatives that can possibly do the same thing. \nAn additional alternative could be using an AppleScript and Automator to “ask” for the values… but that might be too much.\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n  activate\n  set results to (every file track of playlist \"Library\" whose name contains “some track\" and artist contains “some artist\")\n  repeat with t in results\n    play t\n  end repeat\nend tell\n\nSomething like that, if you can make automator (or the script) to ask you for the two “some” values, you’re set.\nMy opinion: iTunes should support spotlight like search strings!\nUPDATE Ok, you’re right about that one, Coversutra (and others) all use iTunes “syntax” which is… no syntax. \nSpotlight, however, is a different beast. \nIn trying to replicate your scenario, I’ve found that I have two “artists” that are similar in name: Metallica and Metalium. They both contain “Meta” in their names.\nSo when I search for artist “meta” I get both, which is annoying, because I really don’t like Metalium that much…\nSo I have two solutions for you:\na. Use Launchbar (or quicksilver), to quickly find the artist (this is a nice way to do it and what I really use most of the time when I want to find a song or an artist, it works faster than anything else). I use Launchbar. Pressing enter there creates a temporary playlist (called Launchbar) that contains all the tracks in question, but you could have dig a little bit more if you wanted an album or song. Very easy.\n\nb. Use Spotlight: \nThis brings both bands: \nkind:mp3 author:meta\n\n\nbut this excludes the unwanted one:\nkind:mp3 author:meta NOT author:metalium\n\n\nNot the best but… what can we do :)\n\nA: I'm not aware of any way to do that type of boolean searching in iTunes (and neither is this poster),  I use smart playlists to do this (sorry if you're already aware of these, just fyi). \n\n", "Q: How can I set up an alternative X11 window manager in Mac OS X 10.6?

I put my iPhone on top of the desktop, and accidentally I stumbled on the desktop and the phone dropped to the floor.\nWhen I picked it up the screen was OK, the phone was still functioning as normal. And it appeared as if it never dropped. But what I worried is that it may suffer internal damage that I can't see from the surface.\nIs my fear warranted?\n\nA: The inside of an iPhone is all solid state and can tolerate being dropped. That said, you should thoroughly test the hardware on your phone to see if anything broke. This includes the screen, case, the touchscreen (make sure that touch and multitouch still works everywhere), the headphone jack, all the buttons, the camera and flash, and the dock connector. A bump could have misaligned or disconnected any of the above hardware.\n\nA: Honestly my phone started acting up now and I've had it since they came out . I love my phone and I've had this bad habit of laying it my lap and forgetting about it as I get out of my truck . I've done this at least 10 times and it still functions properly \nAll I have to say is as dainty as I thought this phone would be it survived even my rugged harsh lifestyle.\nAnd the thing I respect about it is that at least it breaks down bit by bit instead of leaving you with a brick after the first fall\n\nA: What kind of floor did it land on?\nCarpet: no worries, the fall was too short to cause damage IMHO.\nHardwood: no worries but check to be sure (see Kyle's).\nConcrete: potential damage. Check thoroughly. \n\nA: FYI \nI dropped my iPhone 4 the day before I got my free case...

For exemple, if I am creating an application and I want to create a licensing system, do I leave a file somewhere in the system that my application can read/write?\n\nA: Mac OS X Applications, tend to be limited due to the UNIX “open” nature of the operating system. Contrary to Windows for example, where one could bury an entry into the Registry under any name, provided you’re given Admin privileges (which is very natural in Windows). \nUnder OS X, applications are forced to use dedicated locations for storing settings and preferences. ~/Library and /Library. \nWith that being said, this doesn’t stop some applications to use other mechanisms in conjunction with that. \nI cannot name them all primary because I don’t know all of the existing ways, but I can tell you some common forms:\nSerial Number / License Key:  These are the typical. The program stores an “encrypted” copy of these values in its preferences (sometimes even unencrypted), usually located in:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Preferences or /Library\n\n*The Application Bundle itself \n\n*Some value in the user’s Home folder (possibly hidden by a .)\n\n\nThe problem with these are obvious, the serials get published/shared/copied and you have no way to stop it. Some applications have a “blacklist” of serials that although perfectly formatted, are internally hardcoded to be bad. \nOnline Activation: Less common (and usually more annoying), these require the app to connect to an online host to “activate” or “validate” the license. This prevents a lot of fraud and usually ends with the application cracked by some genius, where the code that does the validation is simply modified to always return “ok” making the application believe that the internet stuff went ok.  Read: Adobe Products.\nIn any case, the program has to store the value somewhere, and the usual locations apply. \nTied with Hardware ID This is common too, they extract your drive’s serial number and some other parameters (Network card MAC Address for example) and they create a serial number that checks for those. So even if you “copy” the license, the new machine won’t have the same values and it will fail. This is annoying because if your hard drive crashes and you boot from a backup, you’ll have to re-register. \nRESOURCES\nI assume you want to continue reading about this, so instead of believing me, follow these links: \n\n\n*\n\n*How should my Cocoa application store the user’s license key?\n\n*What is the best way to protect a Cocoa shareware application from software piracy?\n\n*MAKeyedArchived  \n\n*Using OpenSSL for keys (good read!)\n\n*AquaticPrime: the famous secure registration framework (free, accepts donations)\n\n*Golden % Braeburn: The not free method used by the famous Delicious Library (among others). \n\n\nA: There is no set \"standard way\", you would have to either build your own from scratch or use one of the online store frameworks.\nIt sounds like what you want would be best suited by the Mac App Store. You'll need to join the Mac Developer Program to get access to it. It's $99 a year.\n\nA: DRM is handled by apple automatically if you use the appledev store submittal.\nThe DRM apple uses is extremely kept information, obviously the record labels and video studios demand this, as apple would love to not deal with it, per Steves frequent emails and other public letters.\nI need more info regarding what you want to DRM, type of content, iOS app, or perhaps you need a simple license /registration procedure, for an OSX.app.\nPlease be verbose\nTefrota Ho\n", "Q: Having Remote Desktop in Full screen view Is it possible to have Remote Desktop running in Full Screen mode ?

Electricity is PULLED to devices that use it, not PUSHED from the plug. The phone is smart enough to stop pulling when its battery is full. \nEDIT: However, an adapter can provide incorrect voltage for a device. Don't take what I said there and wire your iphone power adapter to a 220 source, for instance. You can OVERDRIVE a device with too many volts, but you can't send it \"too much\" of the right voltage, because the amperage is a function of the device's draw. I know I just said that assuming that you understand the difference between volts and amps, but there it is; they're different.\n\nA: No, leaving it charging overnight will not have any adverse effects.  All you need to do with the iPhone's lithium battery is be sure to drain it once a month for longevity.\nRead Apple's iPhone Battery page.\n[Similar answer for Apple's lithium laptop batteries, iPad batteries, etc.]\nAlso see Apple's Lithium-Ion Batteries page for more info.\n\nA: The answer is it's just like an laptop: If it's left plugged in all the time, then the battery WILL eventually die. So the answer is yes, it's OK to leave it plugged in, but not all the time. \n", "Q: Use the power of the graphic card on a MacBook? Is there a way to use the processor of the graphic card on a new MacBook Pro to do some long and repetitive calculations?\n\nA: Have you looked at CUDA (nVidia only) or OpenCL to do just this? Both technologies are made to leverage the GPU.\n\nA: Running computationally expensive tasks on the GPU is something that is coded on the development side.  This is not something an end user can do directly.  If this is something you intend to do from the development side, it should probably be posted on Stack Overflow.\nWikipedia: GPGPU\n\nA: There are a number of programs written to use the GPU to help users run through various calculations more quickly than with their processor.\nThere is an OpenCL directory here of math programs claiming to use the GPU:\nhttp://opencl.name/top/Science/Math/Software/\nYou'll have to sort through which ones run on OS X.\nThere are OpenCL tutorials on the net, though, and Xcode is inexpensive.

In my work environment I have three smaller monitors and love the productivity benefit. At home I have two 27\" displays (the iMac and an external cinema display), but am having trouble laying them out on my desk so I can effectively use them without neck strain. What's the best layout for ensuring most of your work involves you staring straight ahead at your work, while still letting your work spread out over all those lovely millions of pixels?\nEDIT: responses so far have focused on having the monitors at the right level, i.e. at and below eye level. But the problem I'm having is that just one monitor nearly fills my field of vision, so I end up turning my neck or chair dramatically to work on the other.\n\nA: You don't say what you'll be using them for.  I'm (among other things) a programmer, and for me being able to see a tall vertical area in my text editor is of primary importance.  Thus, given 2 widescreen monitors, I'd set them up vertically, next to each other.\nI'm not unique here: when I visited Google, most of the programmers I saw had this layout too.\nI would think this could help with your neck problem, since it makes the display area closer to a square, and not a really wide rectangle.  Alternatively, you could keep them horizontal, and stack one right above the other.  Depends on the shape of the things you're going to be looking at most, I guess!\n\nA: Honestly, I've been using 2 24inch monitors for years (one  24ich connected to my 24inch iMac).  I personally think using two monitors is  not necessary anymore, if you effectively use spaces/virtual desktops.  \nI now only use my 24inch iMac as my only display, and basically just got used to the new setup, while mastering the keyboard shortcuts.  I don't need to move my head, the OS does it for me.\nI say ditch the other monitor and get use to using cntrl+arrow keys, just my opinion.\n\nA: Make sure both are at the same height, if you still have neck strain, then you are not sitting at the right level:\n\n(image courtesy of this link).\nIf you put them higher or lower, you’ll have to adjust with your neck, thus causing strain.\nAn excellent blog post about that was written by our own creator…\nLCD Monitor Arms. Good old school post.\n\nA: Ergonomics in a nutshell: The heuristic is to have your eye line be about 1-2\" below the top of your monitor.

We have a pod of 30 MacBooks and MacBook Pros that don't get used over the holidays. \nWhat's best practice to store the laptops for 6 weeks? I know that when you store laptops for long periods at half charge, unplugged in a cool place is a good idea, but in practice I've just put them plugged-in in the storeroom! Could anyone share their best practice methods when storing these sort of devices?\n\nA: That's what I think Apple suggests when you need to store you MacBook for longer periods: \n\n\n*\n\n*discharge your battery to 50% and keep the laptop in a cool place\n\n*if you plan to not use the computer for more than 5 months take the battery off the laptop\n\n*you will probably need to charge the battery every 6 months to better preserve it. \n\n\nA: Power it down and make sure it's somewhere where there is no chance of it getting wet.\n", "Q: Why is the wireless connection between my MacBook and AirPort Express so unstable?  The wireless transmit rate of my MacBook Core 2 Duo is extremely unstable. That is, when I connect to my AirPort Express the transfer rate is good for about one minute and after that it suddenly drops (option click on the AirPort icon shows a transmit rate of 1...).\nThe strange thing is that when I then click on the AirPort icon next to the clock and new networks are being searched, the rate gets normal again for about 10 seconds. Then again all running downloads and page load stop until I click again.\nI use the same network with a MacBook Pro without any problems. I've googled this issue, tried to switch wireless channels, switched back to 802.11g mode (it runs on n and g compatible mode normally) but nothing helped so far.\nAny ideas what could cause these transfer rate drops?\nUpdate\nNot sure if that's of any use but in the AirPort Utility it says Signal -24, Noise -95 and Rate 1 (it raises when I click the AirPort icon).\nUpdate II\nOne solution seems to be to switch to 802.11n only 5 GHz (2.4 GHz does not help). The downside: iPhone and many older notebooks don't support it...\n\nA: Something to try is to turn off IPv6 support in your networking preference control panel for wireless, and even for ethernet if you are hardwired.\nMine would drop connections randomly and I'd have to mess around and eventually would pull its power and let it restart to restore sanity. Then, I read somewhere it was a problem with IPv6 support, and turn it off on our Macs. Now it's very stable. \nI stopped using it for my wireless router, and now use it for AirTunes. Very seldom will it lag, and when it does it'll sync up again by itself. I really can't remember the last time it \"weirded out\" on me, even though some days I'll be playing music through it for most of the day.\n\nA: Just in case you're still experiencing the issue. I've been having that happen with my early 2008 MBP for two years now. I seem to have found two half-solutions, see below. Please see if they work for you.\nTo recap:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rate is usually good (54)\n\n*drops after minutes, sometimes hours\n\n*rate is good in most all other networks I happen to be in\n\n\nSo, the first thing I noticed is that when I alt-click the airport icon the rate rises from 1 to a rate somewhat higher, maybe 2 or 4 or 8. It then usually drops again. When I alt-click several times in quick succession, I can get the rate to rise up to 48. But again, only to see it drop again.\nMy first half-solution is this: I found out that whenever I experience the rate dropping I can change the channel in my router from, say 1 to 6 or 11, which will usually resolve the issue. After I reconnect to the network things will be fine for a while (minutes, hours, sometimes a day or two).\nMy second half-solution is turning off all other wireless clients in the network. Whenever I'm alone at home and my laptop is the only computer running, everything's fine. I seem to be having the dropping-rate-problem only when other clients are in the same network, especially when one of them is using the network intensely. I'm almost certain about that now. Please try and see if removing all other clients \"solves\" your issue.\nWhenever it is not avoidable to have other clients in the network, I try the first half-solution (sometimes 2 or 3 times) and it usually does the trick.\nIncredibly annoying though!\n\nA: Your wireless card in the computer need replacing. I have 2 Mac Books. an old 2008 Core Duo that does exactly what you describe. And a new Mac Air. The Mac Air works all over the house and has a transmission rate upwards of 300 depending on were it is located. Bottom line wireless cards get weak and die a slow death.

Unfortunately, I want to take the raw video stream, and hook it into something like a Justin.TV or LiveStream ProCaster for live streaming purposes, but I can't figure out how.\nThe PVR is not listed as a \"video device\" like a camera, so I cannot choose it as a video source.

Camtwist will become a video source and it does things like just broadcast the desktop. So if you have EyeTV maximized and Camtwist broadcasting the desktop and your flash broadcasted using camtwist as a source, you should be set! If you want audio, soundflower is good for that, but not quite as straightforward as Camtwist. Might have to play with it.

Apple could be experiencing a downtime when you tried to access their server.\nDo you have a firewall on? Is the port open for iTunes?\nIt could be any number of things...Let me know if this helps!\n\nA: Would be helpful in narrowing down the cause: \n\n\n*\n\n*Win or Mac OS X?\n\n*Current version installed? (btw, the latest version is now 4.2.1. A last-minute fix caused the version number to revise)\n\n\nThings that come to mind off-hand:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes version you downloaded is 10.1? (the latest at this moment)\n\n*Firewall? Antivirus?\n\n\nWorst case: Use the links from this page, or a page like this, to download the image for the new OS manually and perform a backup-and-restore using the image.

I can do this in Firefox and Chrome. Is there a setting or an extension for this?\nEDIT: So it turns out I was killing (word choice?) the Safari browser (and the Chrome browser for that matter). When I just Quit the browser my previous browsing is always maintained... So rather than get an extension or anything I believe the solution is just to Quit the browser?\n\nA: I have been using SafariRestore from Safari Extensions. It works quite well. \n\nA: Just reopening after quitting Safari doesn't seem to restore the windows for me. (Or anymore?)\nSo to summarize:\n\n*\n\n*History — Reopen All Windows from Last Session or History — Reopen Last Closed Window\n\n*SafariRestore, Sessions or SaveTabs\n\n*Glims or Saft\n\n*Bookmarks — Add Bookmark for These ␣ Tabs...\n\n*In Lion there's Safari — Quit and Keep Windows (⌥⌘Q)\n\n\nA: May I suggest, the free extension, Sessions. It restores last session and even saves sessions for later retrieval. It's stable with useful features like search, export, remove duplicates, micro-management, KB shortcuts & startup behavior settings.\n\nA: After starting Safari, you can go to History -> Reopen All Windows from Last Session to have Safari reopen the windows and tabs that were open when you last used it. \nThere's some additional info in this question: Is it possible to restart an application using AppleScript?, including a script (Chealion's answer) that can be modified to start Safari and call that menu automatically. \n\nA: There are lots of Safari Extensions here... Some of them are Session Managers which will sure do what you want ;-)\n\nA: Not automatically, but you can click \"Bookmarks \\ Add Bookmark for These 3 Tab\" which will create a folder containing bookmarks for all the currently open tabs.\n\nA: As mentioned in the edited question, the solution seems to be to just Quit (command+Q) the browser rather than killing/restarting etc.\n\nA: Glims will remember the history of your previous session, like Firefox and Chrome do. None of the other suggestions here will do that. They'll only show the last page you looked at in those tabs.\n", "Q: Can the built-in OS X \"Location\" feature auto select locations based on wireless networks? My home network is very secure, but my school's wireless network is open, which makes it vulnerable to wireless sniffing (e.g. with Firesheep). I just discovered the Location feature and I think it's really neat, but it doesn't make obvious a way to automatically switch Location based on which wireless network is currently connected.\nIs this something which it is capable of, and if so then how do I set this up? Otherwise I guess I will use a program like NetworkLocation to do this; I'd just like to avoid paying for a program if possible.\n(I'm using the latest Snow Leopard 10.6.5)\n\nA: Since you mentioned Firesheep, let me put in a plug for Sheepsafe:\n\nSheepsafe was built to automate the task of switching your network configuration to use a SOCKS proxy whenever you join an untrusted network.\nSheepsafe works by keeping a configuration of known safe wireless networks. When you join an untrusted network, Sheepsafe switches to a network location that has a SOCKS proxy configured and starts a SOCKS proxy by SSH'ing into a remote server, thus protecting your browsing traffic from FireSheep and other snoopers on the local network. When you switch back to a safe network, Sheepsafe switches back to the default, trusted location and shuts down the SOCKS proxy.\n\n\nA: There are a number of location switch apps that work along with the Location feature such as NetworkLocation and LocationX. A more recent release you could also try is Airport Location \n\nA: The Location function doesn't let you automatically switch to the\nright network configuration.\nYou have to know that the original Automatic location configuration is a real security hole since it lets all you network interfaces up and doesn't give you a correct information of which one you are riding on.\nYou can always check by looking at Apple > Location > Network Preferences...\nThis Automatic configuration is also one of the nightmares of any network engineer.\n", "Q: What is the function of the power button on the Apple Wireless Keyboard? What does the power button on the Apple Wireless Keyboard do? When it is paired to a MacBook in clamshell mode, does pushing the power button put the MacBook to sleep, wake it up, or have some other effect? Is the power button strictly limited to turning on and off the keyboard itself?\n\nA: \nIs the power button strictly limited\n  to turning on and off the keyboard\n  itself?\n\nYep. The wireless keyboard software detects inactivity and will go in sleep mode where it reduces power consumption, however it's probably better to turn it off if you know you won't be using it for a while. You must press that button for a few seconds. The light will show, then it will disappear while you are still holding the button. Then you know it is off.\nWhen you turn it off that way it should display a notification on the OS X desktop, that the bluetooth device was turned off.\nI'm not using one anymore. When I did, I would often forget to switch off the keyboard.\nNow that I think of it it would be nice if there was an option for the computer to tell the keyboard to power off. That way when you shut down your Mac it would power off. I don't remember seeing such an option :(\n\nA: The power button only powers ON/OFF the keyboard, it doesn’t power off the computer. \nTo power off your computer using the keyboard, you might want to use any of the following:\nReference:\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘ (Command key) - On some Apple keyboards, this key also has an Apple logo ()\n\n*⌃ (Control key)\n\n*⌥ (Option key) - \"Alt\" may also appear on this key\n\n*⏏ (Eject) \n\n*⇧ (Shift)\n\n\n⌃ Control + ⏏ Eject : Show shutdown dialog\n⌥ Option + ⌘ Command + ⏏ Eject : Put the computer to sleep\n⌃ Control + ⌘ Command + ⏏ Eject : Quit all applications (after giving you a chance to save changes to open documents), then restart the computer.\n⌃ Control + ⌥ Option + ⌘ Command + ⏏ Eject : Quit all applications (after giving you a chance to save changes to open documents), then shut down the computer.\n⇧ Shift + ⌃ Control + ⏏ Eject : Sleep the display, but not the computer.

I periodically want to listen to .wav files, however these are never music. Most often, they're voicemails sent to my by our VoIP system, but also my camera records audio notes in .wav files. I do not want these to open in iTunes, because then they get added to my library, and iTunes doesn't have the best interface for listening to files like this. I'd prefer to open them in QuickTime Player.\nIn the Finder, I did \"Get Info\" on a .wav file and chose \"Open With\" \"QuickTime Player\". I then did \"Change All...\" and clicked \"Continue\" in the \"Are you sure you want to change all similar documents to open with\" window.\n\nI've done this numerous times. However the change doesn't stick, presumably because iTunes 9 is re-registering itself for the application of choice to open .wav files. How can I make this change stick under Mac OS X 10.5?\n\nA: You can use RCDefaultApp, it's a freeware System Preference Pane  that works in Snow Leopard, Leopard, Tiger and Panther.\nYou must go to \"Extension tab\" and find .WAV in the list and change the Defallt Application.\n\n", "Q: Most reliable way to mirror large number/size files/folders between drives & computers Often I find myself shuffling large directories (20 GB+) of data between computers or drives.  What is the most reliable way to ensure that all data is being exactly mirrored with permissions/dates intact?\nBonus points if it's wrapped in a GUI rather than a terminal command.\nI saw this question regarding copy utilities for OS X, however the answers were skewed towards speed.  My concern is ultimately file/data integrity.\n\nA: rsync has proven to be very stable and effective throughout its years of Unix service. It’s included in any OS X since Tiger and it’s relatively easy to use. \nIf you want the bonus of a GUI, you can use Arrsync, a free utility better described as: \n\nA Mac OS X graphical front end for the utility rsync.\n\nIf, on the other hand you want something more “easy to use” I can recommend you take a look at the two winners:\nSuperDuper! ($)\nCarbon Copy Cloner (Free, Donationware).\nEither will allow you to clone entire drives or folders or anything you can imagine. \nTheir reliability to copy permissions, ACLs, and that stuff has been proven throughout the years.\n\nA: As an alternative to CCC or rsync, you could check out ChronoSync; I've been using it for years and it's just rock-solid.\n", "Q: Where on my Mac are my iPod Touch photos stored? I took some photos on my iPod Touch, and I want to use them on my Mac.  I've synced the devices, but I don't know where the photos are.\n\n\n*\n\n*I looked in iTunes (since it seems to want to manage everything about my iPod, even the things which aren't \"tunes\"), but I don't see a photo section there.\n\n*I looked in ~/Pictures/ but they're obviously not there.\n\n*I looked in ~/Music/iTunes/ (since my mobile apps are stored their, strangely), but no luck.\nWhere are they hiding?\n\nA: The photos aren't automatically transferred when you sync in iTunes - you have to use iPhoto or Image Capture to get the photos on your computer.\n\nA: You should be using iPhoto (or other digital camera software) to copy these photos onto your Mac, but just for sake of completeness, they are included in the backups that iTunes makes.\nThose backups can be found in ~/Library/Application Support/Mobile Sync/Backup, but you need a special program (iPhone Backup Extractor) to be able to read them (and that only works if they are unencrypted).\nYou can find your camera roll after extracting the area called \"iOS Files\" in /Media/DCIM.\n\nA: Normally iPhoto handles them. iPhoto stores images within the package ~/Pictures/iPhoto Library, but it's easiest to browse with iPhoto.\n", "Q: Considering 27\" iMac. Can I use it as a TV? I may be considering to get the iMac.\nI don't own a TV, but I would love to be able to use it as such. I understand it has a DisplayPort input for these types of purposes.\nWhat would I need to get to get my Wii and analogue TV (PAL) hooked up to this?\n\nA: The best way to get TV hooked up to a Mac is through a TV Tuner. The best TV Tuners for Mac are by far the EyeTV tuners. The TV tuner could also be used to hook up to your Wii, however that is a bit impractical. Instead consider buying an adapter from RCA to Mini-Display Port to use your iMac as a Monitor for the Wii.\n\nA: I don't believe that is an input, but only an output, for a second monitor.\n", "Q: StarCraft II minimises itself after opening Whenever I try to open up StarCraft II, the updating screen appears for a few seconds on 50%. The window then disappears, but it is still shown as open in the dock (light is on under the icon). How can I fix this problem? \n\nA: Have you tried a full re-install of StarCraft? Have you ensured that you have all updates, particularly graphic driver updates, are installed?\nAdditionally, you can also find several troubleshooting steps at OS X Daily which includes a few close descriptions of the issue you described.\n\nA: I would add this as a comment but I don't have the privilege yet, but I would suggest also asking here.\n", "Q: Page down in terminal How can I \"page down\" in the terminal?\n\nA: In order to send a page up/down keystroke to the application, as opposed to scrolling Terminal's window, hold down the shift key while pressing your page up/down keys (or fn-arrows as appropriate for your keyboard).\n\nA: There are two answers to this question.\nThe first is globally useable. I'll assume you're on a narrow/laptop keyboard. In those instances, Fn+Down ▼ acts as Page Down, and just to expand that thought out entirely:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fn+Up ▲ = Page Up\n\n*Fn+Left ◀ = Home\n\n*Fn+Right ▶ = End\nThis will not work properly in some applications. Those that come to mind are things like vim, less, screen, and other \"full screen/ncurses menued\" programs. The above keystrokes scroll the terminal window, but if the terminal window has not been paged, then scrolling won't accomplish anything.\nThe second half of the answer is one that I can't answer without more detail.\nExample:  \n\n\n*\n\n*In less, the spacebar or ctrl ^+f will page down one screen full.  \n\n*In vim, ctrl ^+f will page down one screen full.  \n\n*In screen, you will probably never have to Page Down, but if you scrolled back in copy mode, ctrl ^+f works there too.\nIf I haven't answered your question, you will need to elaborate on it, heavily.\n\nA: In addition to VxJasonxV’s answer (which is correct), if you want to modify your terminal behavior so using up or down does a pageup/pagedown in vim (and others), you can go to:\nTerminal -> Preferences -> Click on the Settings Toolbar, then the Keyboard Tab.\nAdd a new keys like this: (showing one example below)\n\n\n*\n\n*Page Up: \\033[5~\n\n*Page Down: \\033[6~\n\n*Home: \\033[4~\n\n*End: \\033[1~\n\n\nHere’s an example with the “Cursor up”: \n\nNow you can press Up/Down and it will do the pageup/down. I suggest you add a modifier (like Control). Sadly, you can’t use the “Fn” key as a modifier. \nNote: By default, Control + Cursor Left is delete until the end of the line and control+cursor right is insert (in vim at least), so you can use another modifier if you don’t want to change those.\n", "Q: iPad navigation for South Africa Is there an iPad app that will give me turn-by-turn instructions for south africa, or do I need to use an iPhone app and the 2X button?\n\nA: I'm not aware of any iPad specific apps for South African turn-by-turn navigation.\nBut, ALK Technologies, Ltd has iPad software for North America and Europe, and iPhone apps for South Africa - so I think your best bet would be to write to them or facebook them and ask when the South African version is coming out. If you're on safari and fleeing from lions and elephants I don't know if the iPhone version will be big enough to see clearly! \nNB: Apple.StackExchange.Com takes no responsibility for Lion or Elephant related accidents. \n\nA: NAVIGON MobileNavigator for South Africa is what you're looking for.\nIt's a universal app running both on the iPad and the iPhone/iPod touch.\n\nA: HERE WeGo supports turn-by-turn navigation. The app is iPhone only and you will have to run it on an iPad and use 2x scaling. This USP of the app is that it supports offline downloading of maps on per country basis.\nYou won't need active Internet connection on your iPad while navigating, but the app uses GPS to locate you, hence it will work only on Wi-Fi + Cellular variant of iPad as it contains the necessary GPS hardware.\n", "Q: Fastest way to transfer a bunch of photos TO iphone camera roll? what is the quickest way to transfer a bunch of photos (and videos) that come from an iphone to another iPhone's camera roll?\n\n\n*\n\n*Sync with iPhoto/Aperture is not an option: they wouldn't end up in the camera roll\n\n*Opening from email or dropbox one by one and saving them is not an option: too many!\n\n*A big email is not feasible\n\n\nAirSharing and Dropbox apps are apparently of little help, since I couldn't find a “save all” command.\nAny suggestion is welcome, third party apps too!\n\nA: Phoneview - is a great option.  It's fast too.  Connect iphone, copy the files to your desired directory, disconnect.  Connect other iphone, copy files to desired location on iphone.  Boom!\nDrag n drop ease.  Free download, and cheap too. edit: it allows you to see entire disk media folder :)\n\n\nA: You can use \" PicBack - Photo Transfer App \" it works with a regular USB cable, which is 3x faster than WiFi transfer and there is absolutely no third-party software to install\nit imports photos and videos directly To camera roll and it can also find duplicated photos , very handy and very easy to use, you can find it at the app store\n\"https://itun.es/i6BG5cC\"\nGive that a try ;)\n\nA: The app GoodReader can save videos to Camera Roll. Simply transfer files to GoodReader via iTunes, then in GoodReader select \"Manage Files\" -> \"Export\" -> \"Save to Photots\".\n\nA: there is another free way to transfer one photo or many photos from iPhone to computer. That is, you can use Apple's Wifi Photo Transfer to do it. The only disadvantage is that your iPhone and computer should on the same Wifi networks.\n\nA: One way to transfer photos to your camera roll:\nSend the photo via email to yourself.\nWhen you open the email on your iphone tap the photo once; camera roll message appears you tap on the camera roll icon and voila! it's transferred to camera roll.\n\nA: Check out an app called Folder Plus. \nVery minimalist design, easy to understand and packed full of useful functionality. Seriously it is one of the best apps when it comes to working with files on your phone. Photos, music, videos, and even incompatible files can be stored and/or passed through the app to their destination. I think there is a free version and a paid version on the Apple App Store. \nAnd there is a free OS X companion app that really makes quick work of any files you want to move onto or from your phone called Folder Plus USB. It requires Mavericks or later to run on your Mac.\nFor the record: I have no affiliation with the maker of this app in any way. It really is just a great little program that has gone under the radar for a long time.\n\nA: Use AirDrop!\nThere's an (admittedly non-obvious) way to \"select all\" images in camera roll.\nFollow the description given here: https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/use-trick-quickly-select-all-photos-videos-your-iphone-bulk-delete-share-0312925/\nBasically select at least the two newest images by sliding over them with a finger. Then without lifting this finger, use another finger to tap the top of the screen. The screen will immediately jump-scroll to the oldest picture and all pictures will have been selected by this process.\nNow you can AirDrop them as usual.\n\nA: Bump https://bu.mp/ can do this.\nAlso try PhotoSync.\n\nA: You can use Rollit to import your photos and videos into to the camera roll.\n", "Q: What issues might (legacy) FileVault cause? Edit: The below was written before Lion came out, so this post is referring to what is now called \"Legacy FileVault\", which encrypts only your home directory.\nI've enabled FileVault on my computer and haven't had any problems yet, but I've read online that FileVault has issues. What are these issues? Are they out of date and fixed in Snow Leopard or are there still problems that I might have in the future?\nI like the idea of my disk being encrypted, and it hasn't seemed slow to me, but I'd like to be aware of any possible pitfalls that currently exist with FileVault.\n\nA: There are a number of possible pitfalls to having an encrypted home folder; most of them are more-or-less intrinsic to the idea, so they're not likely to go away... ever.\nUPDATE: Lion's FileVault 2 uses full-volume encryption rather than just home-directory, so it actually does make some of these issues go away and changes several others.  I've added notes in [] below.  Note that upgrading to Lion does not automatically convert to FV2; you must first turn off \"Legacy FileVault\" encryption for accounts using the old system, then turn on VF2 to reencrypt.\n\n\n*\n\n*Speed: obviously, the computer has to decrypt the data to read it from disk, and encrypt it before reading from disk, which'll slow down disk access.  This usually isn't a big deal unless you're doing something like video editing.  There's also a delay at logout as it recovers space in the image (and maybe also backs it up; see below). [VF2 removes the logout delay, and can use hardware AES instructions (on CPUs that support them) to minimize the general slowdown.]\n\n*Too much security: the good thing about FileVault is that nobody can get at your data without your login password (of the computer's master password).  The bad thing is that if you forget your password (and don't remember/haven't set a master password), you can't get at your data either.  The recommended procedure is to set a master password (before enabling FileVault), write it down, and store the written copy someplace secure (e.g. sealed envelope in a safe deposit box). [VF2 creates a recovery key, which functions very similarly to the old master key. There's also an option to have Apple store the recovery key for you, although I'd recommend using that in addition to (not instead of) storing the key yourself.]\n\n*File non-sharing: FileVault security prevents you from sharing files out of your home folder.  Your Public folder, normally accessible by other users on the computer (and if you have file sharing turned on, other computers on the network) is locked in the FileVault and available only to you. [FV2 removes this limitation.]\n\n*Risk of data corruption: normally, if your computer crashes there's a possibility that whatever files you had open could get corrupted; with FileVault, your entire home folder is contained in a disk image, and if that gets corrupted you could lose everything.  IIRC both OS X v10.3.0 and 10.4.0 shipped with bugs that could corrupt the types of images used by FileVault (fixed in 10.3.1 and 10.4.1, but still...).  So backup is very important if you have data you don't want to lose. [FV2 does not have the image corruption issue, but is still vulnerable to normal volume corruption; it will also limit your options for data recovery somewhat, as not all volume repair/recovery tools support encrypted volumes (yet).]  Speaking of which:\n\n*Backup time: backing up the FileVault image file is generally only possible when you're logged out.  External volumes (like backup drives) get dismounted when nobody's logged in, creating a bit of a catch-22 for many backup systems.  Time Machine gets around this by doing a backup as you log out (after the image becomes accessible, but before the backup drive gets dismounted), so make sure you log out with the backup drive attached from time to time.  Other backup systems... who knows.  In any case, test to make sure you're actually getting a useable backup. [FV2 removes this limitation. Note that Time Machine under Lion supports encrypting the backup volume, in which case it can only back up when the backup volume is mounted and decrypted.]\n\n*Backup capacity: backup systems generally save space by only backing up files that've changed since the last backup.  With your files hidden in a disk image, this isn't really possible.  The image is stored as a series of \"band\" files (in \"sparse bundle format\"), so the backup system only needs to store the bands that changed, but since these don't neatly correspond to specific files in your home folder, it's still going to use more space than if it could back up the files directly. [FV2 removes this limitation.]\n\n*Backup recovery: since the files you're likely to want to recover from a backup are hidden inside the encrypted image, they're a lot less convenient to recover from backup.  When using Time Machine, its slick view-through-time interface doesn't work with FileVault-protected files, you have to find the backup of the image, mount it, and recover the file(s) you want by hand.  Similarly, if you want to recover a file from an online backup, you're likely to have to recover the entire image so you can mount it and pull out the file(s) you want. [FV2 removes this limitation.]\nOne more note: to keep people from bypassing FileVault, make sure you have secure (encrypted) virtual memory enabled (in System Preferences -> Security pane -> General tab), and either log out consistently (yeah, right) or require a password immediately after sleep or screen saver (same place) and set the screen saver to run automatically when the computer's been idle for a while.  There is an option to automatically log out after a period of inactivity, but this doesn't always work (a program with unsaved documents will generally prevent logout).  [FV2 encrypts the virtual memory swap along with everything else, although the advice about locking or logging off still applies.  Also, 10.7.0-10.7.1 were vulnerable to FireWire DMA attacks in some states, but this appears to have been fixed in 10.7.2.]\n\nA: Filevault has/had some issues in the past, but it also had some pros:\nPROS: \n\n\n*\n\n*Easy to backup (one big image file)\n\n*Protection from unwanted users trying to read your home folder.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Forget your password and you can start forgetting about your data. No way you’re going to get it back.\n\n*If the image for your Filevault gets corrupted somehow, your data will be trapped forever in there…\n\n*No recovery software will be able to read through the encrypted data, so forget about this.\n\n*Startup/Shutdown times are a little bit longer due the cleaning and initializing of the image, the same with some big copies to/from your home. \n\n*Free space for the image will only be reclaimed at shutdown (at least it was like that in Leopard) so you might want to restart every now and then if you move large amounts of data inside your home folder.\n\n*Disabling FileVault: Some people have reported problem when disabling filevault (I’ve never done that to be honest). Some even quote that they had to reinstall OS X. \n\n*Time Machine: Filevault won’t backup your home folder unless you logoff, it will happily skip it until you do that. \n\n*Time Machine II: You cannot restore individual files in your home via T.M. (because they are encrypted and out of reach of TimeMachine) ;)\n\n\nThere are some more stuff you might want to consider that I can’t remember right now. Here’s a link that talks about performance (taken from SuperUser).\nAnd if you want to backup your Home folder while using FileVault and while being logged, it is possible, but the backup will be stored unencrypted. Check this question.\n\nA: One big one I can think of is that if you enable FileVault you won't be able to use the new Find my Mac feature in case your laptop is stolen.\nYou can only use one or the other.\nAlso, as you might've already found out if you enabled it some things won't be available via GUI anymore so you will have to use the terminal to work with the encrypted disk.\nFinally, until Apple releases an update for Bootcamp if you plan on running that you may run into some major problems.\n\nA: One issue seems to be upgrading to Lion. The old FileVault functionality is gone, and you have to first convert your FileVault directories (to normal unencrypted ones). That cannot happen in-place, so you may need quite a bit of temporary disk space.\n", "Q: Do you have a better way to browse Windows 7 machines in Finder (SL 10.6.5)? Browsing the \"network neighborhood\" in OS X Finder does show XP machines, but not Windows 7 machines. (Vista machines have a similar problem). I can connect manually to Windows 7 machines (\"connect to server\" and then specifying \"smb://ip_or_name\"), but want to be able to browse Win 7 machines automatically.\nBrowsing works if security is lowered on the Windows 7 machines, and the OS X machine is forced to be the master browser. Question: Who has a better solution? I would like to find another solution without having to change OS X and all Windows 7 machines. Maybe you know some extra OS X software that \"makes samba just work right\"?\n\nA: Windows 7 has extra network security options, and one of them sets its discoverability. By default in Windows 7, when you connect to a new network you are prompted for what type of network it should be: Public, Work, or Home. These profiles set up the firewall and security options when on that network; I can't off the top of my head list all the things they specifically set up, but when you select Public, sharing and discoverability are locked tight, whereas in Home they are more relaxed.\nIt's very likely that you have set your network type to Public on your Windows 7 computer. If you open the Network and Sharing Center, under the name of your active network it should say either \"Home network\", \"Work network\" or \"Public network\". If it is indeed set to Public (or Work), click it and then click Home network. You shouldn't have any problems after that.\nAlternatively, you can open the start menu and type Network and hit enter. This opens the Network window, which lets you browse other computers on your network. As soon as the window opens, a yellow bar should appear at the top informing you that network discoverability is turned off; click the bar and then click one of the resolution options. This may fix the problem as well.\nI haven't had any problem in OS X connecting to my Windows 7 computers that are set to Home network, as they should be. But a Windows 7 computer set to Public network should be basically undetectable.\n\nA: The Non-Ideal Solution\nAfter reading a lot of hints, lowering the required client security on the Windows and making the OS X machine the master browser works reliably for me. However, this solution is less than ideal, as it requires reconfiguring the Mac and every Win 7 computer.\nSteps\nChanges to Windows 7:\n\n\n*\n\n*change the security policy. Using  secpol.msc, go to local security, security options and find \"Network security: \nMinimum session security for NTLM-SSP based...\" both for client and server.\n(sorry, may be different, I have a German install).\n\n*\n\n*uncheck \"NTLMv2 session security required\"\n\n*leave \"128 encryption required\" checked.\n\n\n\n128 bit encryption works with Snow Leopard. Unchecking it is required for some older versions of OS X.\nChanges to OS X Snow Leopard:\n\n\n*\n\n*edit /private/etc/smb.conf\n\n*locate \"os level = 2\" and change to \"os level = 99\" which makes this samba always win\n\n*locate \"domain master = no\" on next line and change to \"domain master = yes\"\n\n\nStarting the new configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*shut down your OS X and disconnect or shut down all your Windows clients.\n\n*restart OS X. This way, OS X will become the master browser for samba.\n\n*restart or reconnect your Windows clients.\n\n\nThe Very Simple Solution\nBy using OS X Server (properly configured), browsing will \"just work\", without the need to reconfigure anything else.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get OS X server.\n\n*Configure SMB as Standalone Server\n\n*\n\n*enable Workgroup Master Browser\n\n*enable Domain Master Browser\n\n*enable WINS server\n\n\n*under Access, allow NTLMv2 & Kerberos, NTLM, LAN Manager   (according to what your minimum security should be)\n\n\nThis may be more than necessary, but it made the situation unambigous.\nThe problem is circumvented. It is not a principal problem of OS X Server, which uses the same Samba build as OS X client. It works reliable with the server solution. Since there is rather little interest in this topic, I will not further investigate, sorry.\nAbout the server cost: It is quite pricey. If you happen to be registered as an Apple Developer, then you can run an evaluation copy of OS X server.\n", "Q: Use iPod Touch bluetooth to connect mobile phone and use dial-up for internet Is it possible to code a program which connects to my phone and use its dial-up service (GRPS/EDGE) to connect to the Internet?\n\nA: I found the app iBluever which seems to be able to do this job.\nThanks anyway.\n", "Q: Transfer photos (in iPhoto) and maintain detail? I would like to transfer photos from one computer to another, but I would like to maintain the originals (most of them are re-touched), faces information, gps coordinates, whether the image has been hidden, and it's rating. I know that transferring using the built in sharing mechanism will remove this detail, so is there a workaround?\n\nA: There is a (paid) utility, it's called iPhoto library manager.\nFrom the description on the website:\n\nMakin' Copies\n  Copy photos from one library to another while retaining titles, comments,\n  keywords, ratings, and dates\n\n\nA: Generally speaking, this is metadata that's stored in the iPhoto Library itself; only the GPS coordinates are added to the photos’ file(s). So really, the only way to preserve that would be to either copy the library itself, or use the utility Agos recommended.\nEspecially when you mention you want to maintain originals + the retouched versions; that's something that the iPhoto Library itself can only maintain.\n\nA: Explore ~/Pictures/iPhoto Library.  Right-click on it and choose \"Show Package Contents,\" that will give you access to the various files, with metadata in them, as well as the \"Originals\" and \"Modified\" folders.  You can pull the originals out of the originals folder, but I think the metadata is stored among the various other files scattered about.\n", "Q: How to manage Apps without wiping out your iPhone App data? I want one to do one simple task: Manage my iPhone 4 apps using the iTunes interface on my laptop. I've done it before, but now there's a problem.\nWhen I go to the Apps section on iTunes, the apps are all faded out and I can't get access to move Apps around. If I click on the Sync Apps button, I get this message: \n\"Are you sure you want to sync Apps? All existing apps and their data on the iPhone \"[iPhone name]\" will be replaced with apps from this iTunes library.\"\nI don't want to wipe my iPhone Apps, I simply want to move Apps around like I used to. I can't say I trust that this iTunes library has all of the Apps correctly. I've run a sync in the past and it deleted Apps I already had installed before.\n\nA: It sounds as though your iPhone and/or iTunes aren’t synced to each other. Unfortunately, for you to manage the apps on the iPhone from iTunes, the iPhone needs to be synced to iTunes. So you’ll have to go through this procedure at least once, and replace what’s on the iPhone w/ what’s in iTunes.\nNo way around that, but thankfully, any apps you’ve purchased are free to you to download again, so if there are any that are missing in iTunes, just download them again.\nBut yes, if any of the apps aren’t in iTunes, and you’ve got data stored in those apps, that data will be lost.\n\nA: You may have multiple libraries in itunes and are trying to sync with the wrong library. to choose the correct library hold down shift (in pc) or command (in mac) key when you start itunes.  keep the key held down and you will get the option to choose the relevant itunes library.\n", "Q: Why are my updating iPhone apps \"waiting...\" forever? I've got an iPhone 4, not quite sure which version of iOS, but I keep current.\nRecently, I got an update for one of the apps, started it, and then for some reason it got stuck on \"Waiting...\" indefinitely.  Another app later offered an upgrade, and when I accepted it got stuck on \"Waiting...\".  This has been a few days now, with both 3G and wireless available, with no change.\nThe apps don't have the \"delete\" button when I touch and hold on them, and I tried deleting them in iTunes but after syncing my iPhone there was no visible change.  (They're free apps, so deleting and reloading is a fine solution, but knowing how to kick-start the updater would be nice.)  The App Store app simply tells me they've been updated.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I get that problem sometimes too on my iPhone 4, especially if I'm updating an app and I lose network coverage. \nHere's what I'll usually do, either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sync with iTunes\n\n*Restart my phone by holding down the power and home buttons. \n\n\nEither of those fixes the problem for me. \n\nA: This has been discussed in numerous threads in the Apple forums, but as of iOS 9.3.2, Apple do not yet seem to have fixed it. See this one for example:  \nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7236083?tstart=0\nAlthough rebooting your device sometimes fixes this problem, be careful as it may also completely wipe the app from your device, including all data. \nInstead, the recommended way is simply to open the App Store app, visit the updates screen, and then stop and restart the update. I've had the update hang on me several times in a row, but it should eventually download and install.\nI'm not sure, however, if this method is available for those with Automatic App Updates enabled, since I have mine set to manual.\n\nA: Reboot it. I've seen this problem a small handful of times on my, and one other individual's, iPhone.\n", "Q: Can I transfer or sync purchased as well as non-purchased songs from my iPhone to my computer? So, I wiped my drive clean on my MacBook and reinstalled the OS. Happily the best of my music was safe on my iPhone and I figured it would easily flow back to my iTunes library.\nNot so happily, I can't seem to figure out how to get this music, which is mine, to the laptop, which is mine, from the iphone, which is mine.  \nI don't want to jailbreak my phone just for this one task, I'm running iOS 4.2.1 on an iPhone 3G and my MacBook 5,1 runs OS X version 10.6.5.\nI would like my music back.  How to do this?\n\nA: Things you've purchased off the iTunes Store can be transferred off your iPhone by right clicking on your iPhone in iTunes and choosing 'Transfer Purchases'. You might need to Authorise your computer first by clicking the Store Menu, and then choosing Authorise This Computer. \nFor your non-iTunes Store content I'd recommend Senuti (read it backwards!) which lets you copy music from your iPhone or iPad back to your mac. Senuti costs $18, but there's a trial version, which can transfer up to 1000 songs.\nNeither of these require a jailbreak.\n\nA: Phoneview - is a great option, as it allows you to access your entire media directory.  You can download a fully functional trial copy. \nSee this similar question: Fastest way to transfer a bunch of photos TO iphone camera roll?\n\n", "Q: iPad Refusing to Sync after 4.2 Beta Expired I didn't quite get around to updating to the GM version of 4.2 in the iOS developer channel on my iPad and unfortunately the beta I had installed has now expired.\niTunes says that the software on the iPad has expired, but any attempt to synchronise with the device throws an iTunes error along the lines of \"no session could be created with the iPad\".\nLooking at the device logs, I see this:\nMon Dec  6 11:01:36 * lockdownd[16] <Error>: 2ff66000 spawn_service_agent: Service com.apple.mobile.installation_proxy is currently prohibited from running\n\nMon Dec  6 11:01:36 * lockdownd[16] <Error>: 2ff66000 spawn_and_handle_checkin: Could not spawn the com.apple.mobile.installation_proxy service agent:ServiceProhibited \n\nMon Dec  6 11:01:36 * lockdownd[16] <Error>: 2ffe8000 spawn_service_agent: Service com.apple.mobilebackup2 is currently prohibited from running\n\nMon Dec  6 11:01:36 * lockdownd[16] <Error>: 2ffe8000 spawn_and_handle_checkin: Could not spawn the com.apple.mobilebackup2 service agent:ServiceProhibited \n\nAny ideas on how to get up-to-date without taking the iPad to Apple?\n\nA: Huh, figures I'd find the solution right after I finally ask someone...\nBooting the iPad in restore mode allowed iTunes to begin a restore & update process and now my iPad is happily updating to the proper, non-beta release.\n", "Q: Ethernet via Cinema Display I want Ethernet on a MacBook Air running in clamshell mode.  Will the USB<-->Ethernet trinket work from the Cinema Display?\n\nA: I’ve seen people have an external powered Hub connected to the Air, then connect the USB to Ethernet trinket to the hub and have no problems with it. If the Cinema Display functions as a normal hub, then you should have no problems with it. \nThe USB specification doesn’t make distinctions from internal/external ports (in theory). \n", "Q: Can I tether with my iPhone 4 without jailbreaking my phone or paying for the additional service? Basically, I want to be able to tether my laptop to my iPhone 4 but I don't want to pay for extra service or lose my unlimited plan.  I've heard there were some apps that had easter eggs but are no longer available.  I've also heard that you can do some things if you have a developer account.\nSo, are there any free, simple ways to do this without jailbreaking my phone?\n\nA: It's probably not an easy way but since there have been some apps snuck into the app store that had hidden tethering abilities: http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/07/apple-approves-pulls-flashlight-app-with-hidden-tethering-mode/ It's clearly possible to do this in an app but not one that will be in the official store. One way around this would be to spend the $99 for a developer account, find some source code, compile it and install it onto your device. Don't mind the hand waving around finding appropriate source code though.\n\nA: [Breaking this two answers so I can post both links.]\nFor a while you could hack it by updating the carrier file (for me it had the side effect of breaking visual voice mail) : http://reviews.cnet.com/activate-tethering-on-iphone-without-jailbreaking Something similar might be possible for iOS 4 but perhaps it's a just a well kept secret.\n", "Q: How Many iTunes Accounts I have an iPhone 4 with an iTunes account. My husband got his own iPhone 4 today. Is it better to have one or two iTunes accounts, but not have to rebuy apps. \n\nA: I think that Apple's article on iTunes Home Sharing should cover what you're looking for. My husband and I have separate accounts, and anything we both want, we share.\n\nA: It's easy to break things down with the two \"rules of 5\".\nEach account (Apple ID to be technical) can be authorized on 5 computers at the same time.\nEach device is happy to track purchases from 5 different accounts. \nThere is no limit on the number of devices that get to sync to any computer that is currently \"authorized\" so hundreds of devices can feed from that one iTunes library. All purchases from the 5 accounts that are \"authorized\" get to sync without passwords being entered.\nSo if you both had an account - your shared computer would count as one authorization for you and one for your spouse. Each of you could take your iPhones to 3 other friend's house and sync apps and music there (since you used 2 \"slots\" for your accounts). Most people never come close to the 5 limit.\nYou do need to know each account's password to update the apps on the go - so having twice the accounts means an extra step to update on the road or having to wait for a password or having the apps download at home by your spouse. \nThere's no way to split things up later - so if you don't mind the extra hassle of two accounts (and remembering to sign in and out on the computer to keep straight which account is buying what from the computer) it's often better to have two store accounts.\nI always recommend if you don't share underwear drawers, don't share iTunes accounts. There's nothing wrong with a little individual space - especially when it's easy to share whenever you feel like it.\n", "Q: Screen Rotation Lock now turns off iPad speaker After upgrading the iPad to 4.2.1 the screen rotation lock button no longer has any effect on the screen rotation.  Instead it turns off the speaker.  I've looked in settings but I don't seem to find any way to change this behavior.\n\nA: According to Ars Technica, iOS 4.3 will give you a preference pane to configure this on the iPad (so that you can restore the rotation lock).\n\nA: At iPad: Understanding screen rotation lock, Apple says:\n\nBeginning with iOS 4.2, the switch previously used for screen rotation lock functions as a silence switch for notifications and system sounds.\n\nSucks, doesn't it?\nIt is still possible to lock the screen rotation on an iPad (and that article explains how); there's just no hardware solution any more.\n", "Q: Why is DashboardClient taking so much memory on MBP? \nIn recent days, the DashboardClient process is taking more memory on my MBP. It's a real memory of 144 MB as seen in Activity Monitor.\nI have never seen this process occupying memory like this before, as if like Safari. It's started few back before.\nI haven't changed my Dashboard for a couple of months...\nI am running OS X 10.6.5\n\nA: Probably the widgets you are using are leaking memory. Try removing them and check which of the widget is taking too much memory. \nI use Calendar, 2 Clocks, 1 Weather and 2 Webclips and the Dashboard client is taking up 83Mb. Normally I just force quit if I see it is taking too much memory, and start it again if I need to them back.\n", "Q: How can I disable the voicemail button on iPhone? I do not use the voicemail at all and from time to time I keep pressing the voicemail button by mistake. \nI am looking for a solution to this problem. I observed many others are complaining about the same problem, even on Apple's forum but they closed the thread and keep it unresolved :p\n\nA: I suspect that because the vast majority of people with iPhones do use voicemail, you're out of luck. Apple isn't known for providing settings or options that only a small percentage of users will want, especially if it's a setting that might prove confusing in the future. \nTheir UI designers likely weighed the number of users who don't want the button vs. the number of users who will be confused because their voicemail button is now missing and decided against the potential confusion. That certainly seems to be how they make most UI decisions.\n\nA: You can disable voicemail button (not remove it) if you jailbreak and install \"voicemailblock\" from Cydia it will disable it. Works with SBSetting so you can enable and disable the button when you want.\n\nA: *5005*86*XXX#   \nhit the CALL button after typing that code into the dial screen\nUse this to reset where the button dials\nXXX  can be blank (*5005*86*#) and it will throw an error when this is pressed, or you can put another number in there to make a quick dial to someone else such as a phonecard.\nConfirmed working on iOS 4.3\n\nA: You can use NoVoiceMail available on Cydia. Works with iOS 6, too.\n\nA: I spoke to my service provider (DIGI Malaysia) about the issue. They can not help saying its iPhone's domain. The provider is happily making money @ 3 cents (USD) per hit or per mistake \n", "Q: iphone upgrade - did it back up? If you tell iTunes to upgrade your iPhone from os4 to os4.versionupdate (example)...\nDoes iTunes automatically back it up before attempting upgrade?\nmy phone is currently in recovery mode - and I don't know whether it backed up or not (you rookie!!!)\nEDIT I have browsed to the back up folder, i.e. \nC:\\Users\\<MY USERNAME>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\nThere is a folder with todays date: \\a6fbdb939e60771c51f18a68a41e8e0e2d230dcc - would this be the backup done before attempting software upgrade?\n\nA: iTunes creates a backup of your iPhone everytime you sync it, not only when you upgrade it.\nIf in doubt, sync the iPhone before upgrading.\nHere is an Apple Support article about the subject: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1766\n\nA: iTunes definitively creates a backup before upgrading. The folder you see seems to be this backup.\n", "Q: How do I enter Dutch names in Address Book? Dutch surnames are kind of weird, in that a lot of them start with small words such as \nde/'t/het (\"the\"), van (\"of\"), van 't, van der (\"of the\"), etc. This makes them a pain to enter in most address books, since you really want to ignore that part of the name when sorting, but not when displaying. This means you get \"Piet Vries\" instead of \"Piet de Vries\".\nWhile Address Book has the \"middle name\" field, which can be abused for this, it really isn't meant for it, causing some applications (iCal, for example) to ignore the field, showing an incomplete name.\niTunes solves this problem for artist and album names, giving you a \"sort album\" or \"sort artist\" field to enter a string to sort on (so \"The Beatles\" are sorted as if they're called \"Beatles\"). I haven't been able to find a similar field in Address book.\nSo, what is the correct way to make Address Book deal with this?\n\nA: My preference is to list their name as something like \"Heirseele, van\" because when searching by last name you'll still find them using \"van\" if you decided to. Putting the preposition in another field is a little hackey (and incorrect from a data-integrity point of view) for me.\nFor the benefit of others: in Dutch, all those prefixes are part of the name. You refer to someone in Dutch as \"Meneer van Heirseele\" not as \"Meneer Heirseele\". Those names haven't joined the prepositions like French names have (e.g., Dupré).\nJust my two cents…\n\nA: The better-world answer is that Address Book should allow users to enter Dutch surnames with the tussenvoegsels ..\nFirst name: Rembrandt\nLast name: van Rijn\n\nFirst name: Huig\nLast name: de Groot\n\n... and then allow users to specify what collation method to use.  That way someone using one collation can exchange contact information with someone using a different collation, and the names will show up where both expect them.  \nThe term for the bundle of preferences which includes grouping and ordering of names, thousands and decimal point indicators, sort order for non-ASCII vowels, etc., is \"locale.\"  It's not just the Dutch: Gaelic names treat Mac, Mc and M' as identical.  \nThe Address Book needs work on \"locale.\"\n\nA: If you don't mind misusing a field, you can use the \"Phonetic Last Name\" field to change the sort order.\n\nA: I would enter the surname prefixes (\"de\" etc) into the firstname field. \nBenefits:\n\n\n*\n\n*That way, sorting would work correctly regardless whether you prefer sorting by first or last name, \n\n*the full name is always displayed correctly because it simply combines first + last name,\n\n*you don't have to fill in additional fields.\n\n\nA: They've got prefix and suffix fields, so would it really be that hard to have a mid-fix or whatever the correct english term is field?\nGoogle suggests infix or interfix, BTW.\n", "Q: Why does iPhone 4 lose its VPN connection on sleep or screen lock? I've setup a VPN connection using AnchorFree.com on my iPhone 4 which works great, the issue I have is when my iPhone goes to sleep or screen locks the VPN connection appears to auto disconnect and doesn't reconnect unless I manually make it. I saw a thread here on apples forums confirming others are seeing this issue but no real solution.\n\nA: I don't know if it will really help you, but the only way I see to walk-around this problem is to set the System Preferences \"Auto Lock\" to \"Never\". This will keep you connection alive.\nI would do this before every remote work session. Then, reset it to 1 minutes, you're done with it.\n\nA: It's most likely a battery-saving option.

I use it to watch Netflix and listen to Pandora from out of the country. I have been playing around to see if I can get the VPN to stay connected; so far I found a solution that has been working for about an hour or so now. \nI have a jailbroken iPhone 4 and I have installed backgrounder from Cydia which keeps programs running even when closed or when the screen is off. \nAfter installing this, I installed Pandora from the App Store and, after launching it, I held down the home button to background it.\nSo far, it seems to be working because Pandora uses my connection and if I keep it backgrounded, it will prevent the VPN from disconnecting. \nI have only been using it for a couple of hours so I'm not sure how good of a permanent solution it will be.\n", "Q: How to set to open folder with enter in finder?

What are my options for using TOR on an iPod Touch, either using something similar to the VPN settings, or through dedicated apps for browsing/email/RSS ?\n\nA: I suspect you would be able to use TorVPN's PPTP Server, just make sure you switch the \"Send All Traffic\" switch on the VPN configuration settings to \"on\". Otherwise it will be astoundingly ineffective :).\nNote that I have not used this service, but knowing what iOS supports (L2TP/IPSec, PPTP, Cisco L2TP), I have a hunch that it will work.\n\nA: TOR runs on the TorVPN server, actually - so you don't have to run the client software on your end at all.\nTo enable it, just log in to your control panel at http://torvpn.com and in your VPN settings click the checkbox that says 'Transparent TOR routing' or something. It's a server side configuration you can do through the TorVPN website. Hope that clears it up.\nBy the way, PPTP is very unstable in the sense that it works for some people, and doesn't work for others. This is probably because of the GRE protocol and natting issues. I have a feeling PPTP is the only TorVPN supported way that works with iPods, but generally I recommend OpenVPN above all.\nps: i can hardly imagine what you want to do in an iPod that you want TOR for... could you help my curiosity?\n\nA: Yes. Open VPN can be used on all iOs devices. Open VPN Connect is a free app that you can load open VPN config files into. I use it to connect my iOs devices to the Private Internet Access VPN. I think you should be able to use it to connect to tor as well. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Does iOS 4.2 change the voltage on the camera kit USB? I want to use my happy hacking keyboard with ipad.\nI just read an aritlce about changes on ios 4.2. One of changes I noticed was that voltage changes for camera kit on ios 4.2. I also read that USB keyboards no longer works with camera kit on ios 4.2.\nIs that true?\n\nA: I could have sworn I've managed to use a USB keyboard with my iPad, and it shipped to me with 4.2.1 installed. Maybe my keyboard uses less voltage (it's one of those semi-novelty foldable ones).\nPerhaps you could get around this limitation with a powered USB hub?\nUpdate: I've recently heard rumour of someone working on a solution for this.\n\nA: Yes it is true, I just connected my USB Key Board using Camera connection adapter, and it shows \"Accessory unavailable, The attached accessory uses too much power\".\niPad Software Version: 4.2\n", "Q: OS X: Is there a way to change the default behavior of copy/move overwrite? Problem: Many of my friends are moving to OS X and are frustrated that, unlike Windows and *NIX systems, copying/moving a folder (with sub-folders) deletes the destination folder if a folder of the same name already exists at the destination.\nQuestion: Is there a way to hack the system (or install a plugin?) so that it by default copy/move operations merge the source and destinations instead of outright wiping out the destination and everything inside (with no option for recovery)?\n\nA: EDIT: Based on your clarification, you're looking to merge two directories. See this question for more information. There's no built-in way to do that using the OS X Finder.\nAs an alternative, you could try using standard unix tools like rsync, which are available via the command line. But this is not a very \"Mac like\" solution.\n\nI'm not sure what you're asking, because when you copy a folder from one place to the other, nothing is deleted at all. I assume you're talking about copying a folder from one location to another where a folder of the same name already exists at the destination? If so, The Mac OS X Finder will show you a warning, it won't delete anything without your permission.\n\nIf that's not what you're asking, please edit your question to clarify, and comment on this answer asking me to update my answer.

The Apple shop lists glossy and antiglare options for their Hi-Res screens and I'm not sure what the difference is, and in particular which one is better for editing photos.\n\nA: This is 80% what calavera already said, and I'm only posting it for a few additional details that wouldn't fit into a comment. Translation: Accept calavera's answer instead, if you're thinking about accepting mine.\nGlossy is generally considered better for accurate color gamut (I believe that's the proper term). Closer to \"real life\", full representation, etc. If you're professionally serious, I would still recommend picking up a color calibration kit, but you'll likely have less tweaking to do for accurate representation.\nAnti-glare is exactly what it says, and exactly as calavera put it, it doesn't reflect the sun, room lights, generally light sources nearly as strongly, so you can use it nearly anywhere without having to re-orient/re-angle yourself. But, as a side effect of this, colors are dulled, a bit washed out.\nPhoto editing, video editing, anything that is geared for visual presentation pretty much demands a glossy screen, as opposed to something with just a visual interface (surfing, audio editing). Of course, with Apple making the anti-glare the \"special order\", it's there for people who need it, but otherwise people get the better choice in the majority of situations, by default.\n\nA: In my experience I would have to say the glossy.  Even though the resolutions are the same, I really think that the glossy has much better color reproductions and looks more natural.  The anti-glare tends to dull the colors, making it more difficult to judge when making adjustments.  In fact, both my wife and I went with the glossy earlier this year for exactly this reason (photo editing).  She has a lot more experience with photoshop than I, and she was blown away by the difference in color between the two.\n", "Q: OS X: Is there a built-in scheduler program? I would like to schedule a task to execute with parameters at a specific time/date in the future.\nDoes OS X include any such tool (even if it's command-line)? If not, are there any free or relatively cheap tools out there to accomplish this?\n\nA: You can also start Automator workflows with iCal if you just want something simple. Otherwise I would do it through launchd. \n\nA: iCal can be used to run AppleScripts, launch applications, and perform tasks to a schedule.\nThere are limitations to using iCal, but it is included with Mac OS X and relatively easy to set up. The limitations and a visual walk through on how to set up a scheduled AppleScript are included in the link above.\n\n\nA: There are two Unix command-line tools that do what you want.  at will allow you to schedule a task to execute once at a specific time in the future.  Of course, part of the task could be to schedule another task.\ncron allows you to schedule tasks to regularly execute at the same time, based on time of day, day of the week, etc.  \nOne thing to note is that both of these will not run tasks if your machine is not running at the time they are scheduled.  There are alternatives, such as anacron, that will run scheduled tasks the next time the machine boots.\n\nA: Scheduler for MacIntosh is a gui-based task scheduler for macOS can be downloaded at https://macscheduler.net/. Been using it to run a backup app I wrote.  Runs in background, doesn't need to be opened at startup. Can launch apps, scripts, docs.\n\nA: While KeithB's answer is correct, actually, cron is being deprecated in favor of the OS X specific launchd.\nCommands to be run via launchd are described in Apple \"plists\", or property lists, which are really just XML files:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\"\n\"http://www.apple.\ncom/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>  \n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.apple.periodic-daily</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array> \n        <string>/usr/sbin/periodic</string>\n        <string>daily</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>LowPriorityIO</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>Nice</key>\n    <integer>1</integer>\n    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n    <dict>  \n        <key>Hour</key>\n        <integer>3</integer>\n        <key>Minute</key>\n        <integer>15</integer>\n    </dict>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nHaving said that, it's not a very user friendly (nor Mac-like) way of scheduling commands to be run.

Is it possible to change the completion key (escape) to command for instance?

Why doesn't Parallels recognize it? I installed Windows 7 on my (month-old) Macbook Pro using boot camp assistant. I basically used defaults throughout, so I don't think there's anything crazy about my setup.\nUsually, after doing this, I would be able to see the Windows 7 partition mounted by OS X, but this time it's missing.

From Googling I read that the firewall is supposed to let an allowed.app use any ports it wants and specification is not needed. I added the .app I wanted to add the port for.\nThe router is an AirPort Extreme v7.5.1. \nI've created a DHCP Reservation based on wireless MAC address for the laptop, 10.0.0.5.\nUnder Advanced: Port Mapping, I added a new entry with the same values for each combination of fields:\nPublic/Private UDP/TCP Port: 9000\nPrivate IP Address: 10.0.0.5\nI want port 9000 on my public IP address to forward to port 9000 on internal IP 10.0.0.5.\nWhen I test my application after this, it doesn't work.\nTo further test, I've turned off the system firewall on the laptop, and I've also placed the laptop in the 'DMZ' by checking Enable default host at: 10.0.0.5\nEven with this configuration set (disabled firewall in the dmz), a full port scan from GRC Shields Up!! reports no ports open whatsoever. Is that normal for OS X? I come from Windows-land, so that would be a surprise.\nIs something wrong here?\n\nA: Something's wrong.  If you've only got the Apple device between yourself and the internet - you've verified your external IP, you've lowered your machine's firewall, and you've DMZ'd your internal IP (which you've verified is correct...) - then the only way a connection can be halted is through another piece of software running on your machine.\nIf you go through all of those steps, you should be completely open to the internet.\n\nA: Wait.\nIf you are set to be wide open and you are showing as filtered from somewhere outside your network, then look to your ISP. \nEDIT:  After some research ipfw supersedes the Application firewall ( socketfilterfw) so, setting ipfw to allow the ports you want open should help.  Shields up is most likely testing your router, I had a similar issue recently.  You'd want to plug directly into your computer, with your network cable, or, with far more sanity than I, use nmap from your phone or something, and check your ports inside of the network.\n", "Q: How to prevent TextMate from overwriting symbolic links?

After about 9 months I started seeing occasional precipitous drops in battery level overnight (i.e. from 50% to \"dead\", as in all you see is the red \"charge me\" icon).  This would happen every few weeks, even if I made sure nothing was running in background before going to bed.  Since upgrading to iOS 4 and multitasking it's happened once, but in general iOS4 seems to have improved the standby time of the device slightly.  Usually I see a 1-2% drop in charge level overnight.\nThe question: Does the iPhone run its own battery conditioning cycles when it decides it needs to?  If not, what would cause this effect? \nEDIT: Clearly the battery is not going bad:\n\n\n*\n\n*The rapid discharge first happened when the phone was 9 months old,\n\n*The phone is now 18 months old,\n\n*The battery behaves normally and holds a charge just fine, and... \n\n*The rapid discharge happens only every two months or so, over the course of a day or two\n\n\nA: No, the iPhone does not self-condition. Apple has a guide for conditioning laptop batteries, yet I can't find a version for iOS devices (still looking).\nThere is a general tips page on maintaining great battery life, as well as general terms about battery replacement.\nPersonally: This sounds like a bad battery. It sounds like it just plainly is not holding a charge after a certain discharge point. Remember that iOS multitasking is not true multitasking. Barring streaming audio (actually persistent audio in general), there is (almost) NOTHING that your phone can constantly do for more than 20 minutes at a time.\nI've streamed audio for hours (hours being... maybe 5?) during the day at ~40% and it did get under 20% by the time I was done, this was both on an iPad, and roughly equivalent on an iPhone 4.

A possible workaround to see if it is app involved or a bad battery, is to drain your phone to a similar level, open the fast app switcher bar (double tap the home button), tap-hold on any application in the task bar until they begin to \"jiggle\", then press the white minus inside the red circle on EVERYTHING. This will kill any and all tasks that aren't first-party. (For example, it will not stop the occasional housekeeping/tasks that Mail, Phone, Safari, or other built-in apps are allowed to do.)\nHaving said that, to properly test, ensure that mail's auto-fetch is off (or in push only mode at best), make sure that you have no tabs in Safari with \"live\" or automatically refreshing content. Safari IS ALLOWED TO BACKGROUND, and has always been able to, to the best of my knowledge. At least since iOS 2.something (where I started with an iPhone 3G).\n\nA: A note to those who find this QA: a link here from Apple can be helpful.\nThis morning when my battery was draining out, I tried the above tips ( reproduced below), and it worked. \n\nIf you have an Exchange email account\n  you probably have some stale sync\n  threads. Try this:\nGo to Settings/Mail,contacts,calendar.\n  Tap the name of the account. Turn off\n  the 3 switches. Back out to the main\n  settings page. Now launch mail, then\n  contacts, then calendar to kill the\n  pending connections. Reboot the phone,\n  go back to Settings, and turn the 3\n  switches back on. This will probably\n  fix it.\n\n", "Q: iPhone battery symbol is red, doesn't acknowledge charging, but is apparently charged I have an iPhone 3G, \n\n\n*\n\n*When I plug in the charger,  the big red battery on the locked screen is red, low and doesn't appear to be charging. When I unlock the screen, the small battery symbol on the upper right is green with a bolt. \n\n*When I unplug it, the battery symbol in the upper right is low and red, but the phone seems to be charged.\n\n*The phone syncs to my computer fine when connected.\n\n\nDoes anyone know what the problem is and if it can be fixed? Is it relatively benign, or perhaps an early sign that it is reaching its final stage of life?\nUpdate\nAlthough I am still no closer to the answer, and I had tried powering off manually, I let the battery run out (about 7 days at 1hr/day, no cell phone service) and when I charged it again, the issue resolved.\n\nA: Sometimes it happens when you put your iPhone for charging more time. \nPlease power-off and restart your iPhone. Mostly this solves problem.\n", "Q: Where is this \"other calendar\" coming from on my iPhone I am using Google's exchange service on my iPhone, and I have successfully selected which calendars I want to sync by going to m.google.com or whatever the Sync address is. However, in the native iPhone app, I have this weird calendar called \"Birthdays\" in the \"Other Calendars\" section. I have no idea where this calendar is coming from - its not in Outlook (and I don't sync with Outlook anyway), and its not my Google Birthday calendar (the dates are wrong). How do I remove it? I'm using an iPhone 3GS with iOS 4.1.\n\nA: I believe this comes from the address book. If you add a vcard with birthday information, it gets synced to iCal in this calendar. And then it might be getting synced to your phone.\n\nA: The Birthday calendar is a “read only” calendar automatically created by iCal. You can change what will appear there by modifying your contacts’ birthday (in address book).\nIf you don’t like it, you can always disable it. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open iCal\n\n*Go to Preferences:\n\n\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to have tabs in Finder? I often need to open many finder windows at the same time and my desktop becomes cluttered. \nIs there any way to get tabs in Finder so one window can host multiple folders?\n\nA: TotalFinder \"brings tabs to your native Finder\". It's commercial software, however. There are some other Finder replacements as well.\n\nA: Mavericks (MacOS X 10.9) brings us native tabs in the Finder (finally).\n\nA: A free alternative for OS X 10.6.8 to 10.8.2 is also XtraFinder, which supports Tabs as well.\n\nA: it was already mentioned but PathFinder is an incredible app.  Plus there is a mac bundle site with it on discount right now.  MacPromo Bundle\n\nA: Update: As shown in File Menu and being consistent with the rest of the macOS shortcuts, command+T will open a new tab. Tabbed Finder was introduced in OS X Mavericks in 2013.\nWith the native Finder app that comes with OS X is not possible to have tabs.\nIf you really need them you can use some Finder replacement app, like TotalFinder or PathFinder (both not free).\n\nA: IMO, I would wait before buying any program/app, as the new OS from apple, aka: lion, will probably address the finder and its shortcomings. \n", "Q: Hide 'On my iPhone' calendar when syncing with MobileMe Ive now switched back over to MobileMe for all of my calendar stuff. \nI was wondering though, if I go to 'Calendars', it also displays a calendar 'On My iPhone'. I don't think I would ever want to use it (because I want it to write to one of my two MobileMe Calendars). \nIs there any way to remove this other calendar? Or at least make it so its not the 'default' one? Even if I tell the iPhone to not show it - it still wants to write to that calendar by default\n\nA: Yes, I think you can change this settings in iCal, as your mobile me settings are in there.  I did this, and my iPhone only shows my Mobile me calendars.  \nIf you use gmail, I would also reccomend BusySync. It syncs anything you add to you iCal, and then iCal and mobile me syncs.  Its pure awesomeness in my opinion.  \nAlso, if you have devleoper tools enabled, you can edit the plist mobileme sync-time interval to 1 min, instead of 15.  You can access the mobile me plist file in home/library/preferences/byhost/ - the specific file name is like: com.apple.mobilemesync.. or something like that.  Im at work, and use a linux system, so if someone else knows, please confirm, otherwise i will update this when i get home.\n\nA: I haven't done this, but --\nOn the iPhone Under Settings then \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\" then the Calendars section there is a preference to set the default calendar for new events created on the iPhone.\nI'd assume you could change the default to an existing calendar, move any \"On My iPhone\" events to another calendar, make sure the changes have synced, and then delete the \"On My iPhone\" calendar in iCal.\n\nA: Sadly - the only way to remove it is convoluted. Get a backup and make sure you understand the steps.\nFirst temporarily remove all sync accounts (deleting the data from the phone - it's only on the cloud and on the backup now) and then sync with the USB with a checkmark to overwrite the calendar data on the phone one time. Then disable USB calendar syncing and the phone (or iTunes) will prompt and offer to let you delete the calendar at long last.\nOnly then can you add back the calendars you want from the cloud.\nIn the mean time, you can go to the settings app, and at the bottom of \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\" is a place to set the default calendar for new events.\n", "Q: Migration and drivers or kext programs? I recently purchased a new iMac.  I used the Migration Assistant to migrate users and applications from my previous iMac to this one.\nBoth are x86 based, and both running Snow Leopard, so as close as possible from that perspective.\nWhile most things came across cleanly, it seems that programs that have lower-level driver like things did not.\nMy ScanSnap for example did not work, and had to be reinstalled from DVD.\nMy PL2303-based serial port seems to need a reinstall, and I have not yet tried the blackberry software.\nIs the assistant supposed to migrate kext and low-level stuff like that?  If not, is there an easy way to find out what is missing?  Should I do something different in the future with respect to migration?\n\nA: If it was easy to find all of the system items associated with an application, Migration Assistant would've done it for you; generally, if it can't figure it out, the easiest solution is to reinstall the software that didn't come over cleanly.\nThere is an alternative, however: clone the entire volume with something like Carbon Copy Cloner.  This'll get all of the add-on software fine (except things like hardware-tied license keys and such), but may run into compatibility problems with the new computer.  For example, if you clone from an older system to a new one that requires a special build of the latest OS version (with new drivers & such for the new hardware config), you may have to reinstall the OS (from the disc that came with the new computer) to get that to work.  Pick your poison...\n", "Q: Textmate alt-f to move forward by one word I've recently switched from Linux to Mac. One thing that is really killing my emacs memory muscles right now is the lack of alt+f and alt+b to jump forward and backward by word. \nI've gotten the meta/option flag flipped in Terminal.app preferences (so alt+. now works as expected), but I haven't found a similar option for Textmate. Even better if I could enable it as a MacOS  global setting for the U.S. keyboard (so it would work in all input boxes). At the moment I get the following useless (for me) encodings:\nalt+f: ƒ\nalt+b: ∫\nHow do I remap alt+f and alt+b to jump forward and backward by word?\n\nA: As usual... KeyRemap4MacBook to the rescue :P   Its emacs mode will give you those bindings, and you can choose a lot more bindings than that as well:\n\n\nA: FYI, it doesn't seem to be mentioned in the Mac shortcuts list, but on my Macbook Air you can press\nCtrl+option+f\nand\nCtrl+option+b\nto move forward and backward one word, respectively.\n\nA: One way to remap the keys in other applications as well would be to create ~/Library/KeyBindings/ and save a property list like this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict:\n{\n    \"~b\" = moveWordBackward:;\n    \"~f\" = moveWordForward:;\n    \"~d\" = deleteWordForward:;\n    \"~l\" = (moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:, lowercaseWord:);\n    \"~u\" = (moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:, uppercaseWord:);\n    \"~c\" = (moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:, capitalizeWord:);\n}\n\nYou could also cp /Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/Resources/KeyBindings.dict ~/Libary/Application\\ Support/TextMate/KeyBindings.dict and add the same keys there.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 Custom SMS Text Tones I read about how to add custom ring tones, but those don't show up in the SMS tone tab, just the phone ring tab, is there some way to add custom text tones without jailbreaking my iPhone? :(\n\nA: There are new SMS tones as of 4.2, and you can assign a specific SMS tone to a specific person via the Contacts app also as of 4.2, but you still cannot create custom SMS tones in the stock firmware.\n", "Q: Smartfolders- Can I narrow the query? When using Smartfolders in Mac OS 10.6.5, is it possible to choose where to search beyond the 2 button choices?  One button is usually \"This Mac' (too broad) and the other one is a folder that has never been the one I want - in fact, I would want to exclude a particular folder (ie the Library folder in my user directory).\nSince we are given a choice of 2 places to query, why not any particular branch of the directory?\n\nA: Ok, there’s a way to “hack” into SmartFolders and change the locations. \nRules: \n\n\n*\n\n*You can’t do it from the UI\n\n*It involves having the smart folder saved\n\n*I wrote it in spanish a long time ago in a blog post (spanish)\n\n\nFor the sake of helping you (I’m assuming you don’t speak spanish), I’ll transcribe the relevant information here. \nPlease note that the blog explains how to add more than one location to the search, not how to exclude (something I don’t believe is possible).\nSo, the short version: \n\n\n*\n\n*Save your smart folder, the search location is really not important (we’re going to change it!) but make sure you use the searching “terms” that you want. Name it something like: IHATESMARTFOLDERS. Ok, you can name it differently if ya wish ;)\n\n*Go to your ~/Library/Saved Searches and you should see your saved smart folder. \n\n*Once you have located your smart Folder, you have to open it with a text editor like TextWrangler (or anything that can save Plain Text). Do not use Pages…\n\n*Once you have it in your favorite editor, go to the end. You’ll see something like this: \n\n\n\n<key>FXScopeArrayOfPaths</key>\n<array>\n           <string>/Users/martin/Desktop</string>\n</array>\n\n\nNote My smart folder was created for searching on my Desktop.\nGood. As you can see the path is in an Array. If you know something about arrays, you’ll know that they are a collection of items. This means we can go ahead and add more items to this particular collection:\nFor example: \n<key>FXScopeArrayOfPaths</key>\n<array>\n         <string>/Users/martin/Desktop</string>\n         <string>/Users/martin/Pictures/MacStuff</string>\n         <string>/Users/martin/Pictures/Me</string>\n</array>\n\nI have added two more folders to my smart -not so smart- folder. \nNow in order for this to start working you have to: \n\n\n*\n\n*Save the smart folder (remember to use plain text!)\n\n*Restart Finder. \n\n\nAnd voilà. \nSadly, I haven’t found a way to exclude a location.  \n\nA: There is a 3rd party app EasyFind which has more constraints and customizations for your searches. I use it much more than smart folders. EasyFind is free from the App Store.\n", "Q: Custom Application Keyboard shortcut for Safari not always working I uninstalled Flash a little while back, and installed Chrome as a back-up for when I hit something in Safari and want to see the Flash. I have the \"Show Develop in Menu Bar\" preference set, and created an Application Keyboard Shortcut for Safari, to Develop>Open Page With>Google Chrome. The shortcut I created was ⌘ + K. And it works!\nWell, kinda. It seems like every time I quit and restart Safari, the shortcut stops working. But once I navigate back to Develop>Open Page With (I can just cancel when I bring up the menu, I don't need to select anything), the shortcut works again.\nAny way to make sure it always works?\n\nA: This is a known “bug” which I don’t know if Apple will ever consider a bug. \nThe problem is that the list of browsers is generated “dynamically” each time you click on it (or at least the 1st time after Safari has been launched); the reasoning behind this is that different users will have a different set of browsers, so the list cannot be hardcoded. So given the above, the shortcut fails to work until the list has been “generated” by Safari. This occurs when you display the menu. \nA possible solution would be to use Automator and create a service that opens the current safari page onto Chrome. But that’s beyond the scope of this answer.\nTLDR version: There’s nothing you can do other than file a bug report at Apple if you want to stick with the same shortcut technique. Alternatives involve Automator. \n", "Q: Apple 30\" Monitor Intermitently Flashes Off and On I have an apple 30\" monitor plugged into my late 2008 15\" Macbook Pro. Every once in a while when I start up the Macbook pro the monitor will first turn on, then off and repeat indefinitely until I unplug the DVI connection. If I place a finger on the power touch switch on the side the monitor, the display will usually stay on as long as I hold my finger there.\nHas anyone else had this problem. Anyone know what causes it or if it can be easily fixed.\nThe monitor is not under any kind of warranty at this point.\n\nA: \nI don't know why, but if you unplug the monitor power (not just press the power off switch) and then plug it back in the problem goes away.\nMy guess is that the on/off switch on the side of the monitor is heat sensitive and calibrated for the temperature of the room, if the room temperature changes, things become un-calibrated, and the monitor starts thinking it's receiving a touch even when it's not. \nThe stan marsh method resets this calibration.\n\nA: I have a similar problem with my 2009 15\" Unibody MBP, intermittently. \nIt seemed to be to do with the mini-DVI to DVI connector. My laptop goes everywhere with me and is invariably plugged into other things whenever I arrive anywhere, so over time the ports start to get a bit 'soft'. I found that if the mini-DVI to DVI connector wasn't completely sat in the dvi-out socket properly, then the display it was plugged into would flicker. \nI have 2 'identical' Apple mini-DVI to DVI connectors, and one of them seems much more prone to being a 'loose fit' than the other one.\nCan you borrow another mini-DVI to DVI connector to try it?\nYour heat theory is an interesting one but I doubt that the calibration is that sensitive (I've got an older Cinema Display model with the touch-sensitive brightness and power controls, and I've never known it turn itself off/on regardless of the temperature of my office, which varies wildly throughout the year). I could be wrong, though! :-)\n\nA: I also found that @Ben's answer worked for me, but it help kept happening more and more often. Eventually I called Apple because the monitor was still under warranty and Apple replaced the monitor--just the monitor, not the power supply so it seems that @Ben's right on what the problem is.\n\nA: I have the same problem, I think it is temp.and moisture issues.\nafter about 30 min. I can remove my finger from the on off button and the monitor will stay on.  Then if it goes to sleep, it starts all over again\n", "Q: Can't update cabal in Mac OS X 10.6 I am trying to install cabal (for Haskell) in Mac OS X 10.6.5 (64-bit kernel).

This is the model with the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M video card.  This MacBook Pro should support the higher resolution of the 30 inch model (2500x1600 res), but...\nHow do I add the older 24\" monitor (1900x1200 res) into the mix?  \nThe laptop stays closed, but technically this is 3 screens. The older monitor only supports DVI and VGA inputs.  I have read about several USB to DVI converters on Amazon, most with mixed reviews. \nCan anyone recommend a specific piece of hardware known to work?\n\nLater addition:\nThanks everyone for the helpful answers.  \nThanks Martin, but the Matrox is unsuitable for my setup as I have one 2500x1600 and one 1900x1200 monitor. The Matrox website says \"maximum resolutions of dual 1920x1200 and triple 1360x768 under Mac\" and I've read elsewhere that both resolutions need to be the same.\nJohn, Thanks for the tips - that is indeed what I settled on; a Kensington USB to DVI Converter (with DisplayLink 195 chipset).\nMy additions to your suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Definitely use the latest drivers, even if beta. I had a major problems with the DisplayLink 1.5 drivers when trying to resume from sleep. The 1.6b3 drivers fixed that.\n\n*You cannot use the Mac built in screen capture on the USB monitor.  No biggie, but it tripped me up until I figure out that was the issue. \nRock on.\n\nA: A new product has been announced today about this. On the Windows side, the Matrox DualHead/TripleHead were common, but not available for Mac. \nThat has recently changed because Matrox Introduces New Mac-Friendly DualHead2Go DP and TripleHead2Go DP Multi-Monitor Adapters.\n\nA: I use a USB to DVI adapter based on the DisplayPort line of products with my MacBook Pro (2007 running Snow Leopard 10.6).  Overall, I am quite happy with it however there are a few things you should note:\n\n\n*\n\n*It does not support hardware acceleration so certain programs, such as iMovie, will refuse to launch when the device is plugged into your computer.  iMovie is the only program that I have come across that is affected but I mainly do web development and work in PhotoShop.\n\n*At this time, the DisplayPort drivers do not support color profiles.  Your only option for color calibrating your monitor will be whatever manual controls your monitor comes with.  It's not a deal breaker for me as I mainly edit text but if you are color correcting photos it could be a problem.\n\n*Small youtube videos play pretty well but you won't want to use the monitor for anything like fullscreen playback.  It will work, but the results will be pretty choppy.\n\n*Make sure you are on a USB2 hub or directly plugged into a USB port on your machine.  It won't run over anything slower.\n\n\nYou can find a link to my preferred vendor here, though any product with Mac Drivers based on the newer chipset (resolution higher than 1080p) will work:\nhttp://eshop.macsales.com/item/Newer%20Technology/VIDU2DVIA/\nDon't buy an adapter that uses DisplayPort if it does not specifically say it will work on a Mac.  I did so assuming I could use the generic drivers and they did not work.\n", "Q: Is it possible to shut down an Ipod nano 6th generation? If yes, how?\nIf no, why such a decision?\n\nA: According to Apple Support:\n\nIf the iPod nano is paused, and you\n  press the Sleep/Wake button to turn\n  off the screen, the following behavior\n  will take place:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*For 36 hours after pressing the Sleep/Wake button and turning off the\n  screen, iPod nano is in Standby, and\n  will quickly wake up when you press\n  the Sleep/Wake button again.\n  \n*After 36 hours in Standby with no activity, iPod nano will shut down\n  automatically.

To clean iPhone, disconnect all cables and turn off iPhone (press and hold the On/Off Sleep/Wake button, then slide the onscreen slider). Then use a soft, slightly damp, lint-free cloth. Avoid getting moisture in openings. Don’t use window cleaners, household cleaners, compressed air, aerosol sprays, solvents, alcohol, ammonia, or abrasives to clean iPhone. The front and back covers of iPhone 4 are made of glass and have an oleophobic coating. To clean these surfaces, simply wipe with a soft, lint-free cloth. The ability of this coating to repel oil will diminish over time with normal usage, and rubbing the screen with an abrasive material will further diminish its effect and may scratch the glass.\n  — iPhone\n  User Guide, page 54\n\n(emphasis added)\nOr in other words: remember that little piece of cloth that came with your iPhone? That's all you should need.\n\nA: I often slide the phone across my sweater (chest or sleeves) - anything that's soft, reasonably dry and clean, and won't scratch the glass will do.\n\nA: I swipe my iPhone 3GS across soft parts of my clothing, which works OK. But any microfiber cloth should work much better than plain cotton, and should also work reasonably well without being damp. You can get them at an optometrist, glasses cleaning cloths are usually microfiber.\n", "Q: Easy way to get gcc and make in OS X I want to install a few CPAN modules in OS X.\nIt filed since the module I want requires make and gcc to be installed. A quick google on the subject tells me that I need to install \"Apple Developer Tools\".\nDo I really have to install the entire Xcode package (it's a 3 GB download) just to get make and gcc?\n\nA: I would highly recommend installing the developer tools. They are free from Apple. \nIf you really don't want Xcode after the fact, you could just remove the Application itself. You may also be able to not install any documentation, which I think also takes a bit of space. \n\nA: You can use osx-gcc-installer to get GCC and related tools without installing Xcode.\nNote that there might be legal problems with osx-gcc-installer, and for this reason make-gcc-without-xcode has been made as an alternative. It requires the Xcode installer package, and generates an archive with only the necessary stuff -- no Xcode.\n\nA: While I would certainly suggest that you download and install the developer tools from Apple, you can obtain gcc, etc. in any number of other ways. My favorite alternative would be to obtain it from http://www.macports.org/\nThere is a nice GUI for it here: http://porticus.alittledrop.com/\n", "Q: Recommend me a productivity/workflow tool Can anyone recommend me a productivity/workflow tool that does the following?\n\n\n*\n\n*I would like it to be task based\n\n*I would like to be able to set:\n\n\n*\n\n*a due-date\n\n*priority\n\n*status (for example: started, paused, waiting for input, finished, cancelled)\n\n\n*I would like to be able to link directly to one or several emails in my email program (OS X Mail.app or Thunderbird preferred)\n\n*I would like to write notes about each task\n\n*I would like to be able to add attachments (documents and images)\n\n*Some calendar integration would be nice \n\n\nA: I think you're looking for OmniFocus, which does (if I recall) everything you want, has a system-wide modal \"inbox\" tool as well as synchronizable iPad and iPhone apps.\nTheir price point is ridiculously high in my opinion, but people are fanatical about it.\n\nA: I believe Things does all that. I use it. I like it. \nI don’t know about thunderbird “linking” but with Mail.app it works. You can “drag” a mail onto a task or things to create a new one. Same with documents. \n\nA: The Hit List also does all this. I'm currently using it. It offers sub-tasks and sub-folders so it is more inline with OmniOutlier than Things (which does not offer sub-folders).\nIt's currently in Beta, which is nice because it's free.\n\nA: Maybe you want to take a look at Process (Manual in PDF). It’s cheaper than Things and OmniFocus.\nnote: I’m adding this 2nd answer so people can vote at their discretion. \n\nA: Judging by your description, you might like Kanban Tool (https://kanbantool.com/). It is task-based, you can add due dates, set priorities and change the status of the task. You can add attachments. It also has a time tracking feature (I personally find it very helpful) and is easy to use.

I am happy with iTunes 9 and am a bit leery of upgrading to iTunes 10 on my Mac based on some feedback I've heard from others. Can I duplicate iTunes.app in my Applications folder prior to running Software Update to update to iTunes 10, and use the backup iTunes to run iTunes 9 if I am not happy with iTunes 10? I know this works with some applications like Final Cut Pro but not with others like Safari.\n\nA: Don't see why not.  If you're paranoid, you may also want to backup the iTunes prefs (~/Library/com.apple.itunes*), and/or any config files you find in your iTunes music folder (~/Music/iTunes/ in my case).\n\nA: I just did this and I can confirm that it did work. However as Harv said, if you do this make a backup of the old files, specifically your library, as iTunes 10 will upgrade your \"iTunes Library\" file and iTunes 9 will refuse to read it.\n", "Q: How can I stop spaces from switching automatically?

I have a NetBoot image which I use for booting into to do things like disk maintenance and testing new applications without having to install them on my workstation. It's really handy, but I created it a while ago and much of the software on it is now out of date, like the OS, QuickTime, and Safari. I want to update the NetBoot image but the only way I think to do that is to use Disk Utility.app to restore it to a USB drive, boot from the drive directly, make any changes necessary and re-image the USB drive, overwriting the original image.\nIs that the best series of steps or is there an easier way to update a NetBoot DMG file?\n\nA: I think you've got the best way, I know you can mount the disk image inside the netboot image, but AFAIK it breaks the netboot; and some updates can't be applied to a non-boot-drive disk image. \nIf you're netbooting a lot, I'd recommend using DeployStudio, a free, open-source powerhouse for network deployment and the like; it makes it a bit easier to update / deploy images than netboot - but it might be a but much for what you're using netboot for. \n\nA: I would suggest just using a separate user account if you want to test out applications without changing the environment you are working in, if your OS and everything else is up to date.\nIf that is not the route you are looking for, then I agree with glenstory that your direction is the Apple way to go, and will take more time, but maybe less time than learning DeployStudio which will let you update a netboot image, which Apple's System Image Utility will not.\nFinally, a third option is to have an install on an external drive that you can update and boot to to test things.  You have the base as the Netboot that you are using, so that is a good base to start from.\n", "Q: What do you think about Apple's Ping service? Personally, I have not signed up the Ping service that is included in iTunes 10.  My main reason for avoiding it is the fact that Apple requires you to use your real, full name for registration.\nWhat are your opinions of the service?\n\n\n*\n\n*pros/cons\n\n*privacy or security concerns?\n\n*things you wish they had done/not done\n\n*things you'd like to see added\n\n*things you'd like to see removed\n\n\n*note: this question is serious but also meant as a sort of experiment to see if a discussion question can be useful or relevant on the site. if you hate it or don't want any sort of discussion other than the occasional list question, vote to close but please post a comment explaining your reasoning\n\nA: Primarily, I don't understand the purpose.  I don't know a single person in the world whose musical taste I trust, or that I think is similar to mine.  I've seen last.fm, facebook, twitter, etc., and they've taught me to ignore musical recommendations.\nMalcolm Gladwell wrote a New Yorker article about how social network links have so little value because they're so easy.  I might get 50 musical recommendations on facebook this week, and I'd only have to click twice to listen, and I'm not going to listen to any of them.  But when the guy who lives next door hears me listening to Brahms, and stops in and says \"You might like this other thing too!\", and brings me a CD, I'll put it in my stereo and listen to it 2 or 3 times.\nSecond, the interesting music I'd want to share is largely not on iTunes.  It's the bootleg of some Asian singer whose recording you can't get here yet (and maybe never).  It's the Youtube video of some guy you kind of know playing at a club downtown last week.  It's the out-of-print-for-40-years LP on my shelf of an incredible and rare recording of a popular group, that I got at a garage sale once for $4.  It's the MP3 preview that some up-and-coming composer dropped on his blog to show you what he's doing.\nLike everything Apple seems to do these days, Ping is probably great if you only care about recent mainstream name-brand consumer goods.  (Lady Gaga at the announcement!)  From a couple of longhairs who started out selling devices to let you make phone calls without paying, Apple has really turned into a company that doesn't care for the fringe -- even the legal fringe.\nThird, it's part of iTunes.  Back in 2003, I thought iTunes was awesome.  These days, it's got so much crap in it, I don't even know how to do all the things I used to know how to do.  It's confusing and frustrating and I use it as little as possible -- only for feeding my iPod, for things that can't be loaded directly.  (iPods have gotten a lot more complex and confusing since 2003, too, but there's pretty much no competition in this space.)  So Ping would have to be pretty awesome for me to want to use iTunes more than once every couple weeks, and it's not.\nSo if I wanted to do something that I don't, but can do already in better ways, but now do it in an app I hate instead of on the web ... I guess Ping would be for me.\nYou know what would be a better thing to put in iTunes, since apparently it's no longer just about \"tunes\"?  Recipes!  I need to keep track of them somewhere, and iTunes might be better than a bunch of text files.  Plus, I actually do trust food recommendations from friends, so Ping-for-Recipes would actually be worth something to me.\n\nA: Weird question, but… a user with a name calavera (which we still don’t know if it comes from Skull in spanish or Sepultura’s brothers) and the Xcode icon on its profile, what can you expect… ;)\n\ncalavera as in Manny Calavera, the\n  travel agent and grim reaper :)  --calavera\n\nIn any case, here’s what happened with Ping and I.\n\n\n*\n\n*New iTunes. Oh ping, what’s that? \n\n*10 minutes investigating, registering, etc. \n\n*A few days later. Nobody had it. There was nothing (other than 3-4 authors)\n\n*Found a way to disable it. \n\n*New iTunes update. Native disabling. \n\n*Disabled it all. Removed my ping account.\n\n\nHow could it be better?\nI’m not sure, maybe if it was Facebook instead. People already has facebook, nobody wants another social network. Facebook+Twitter is enough for 99%. \nI want to tell my friends (or group of friends): Hey, listen to this, it’s cool, you’ll like it. \nI want to be able to see what they have found…\nFor everything else, there’s Mastercard.\n\nA: One day the RIAA will reach for your music through ITunes.  Spotlight will tell them where it is on your drive, Ping will tell them what.  You think that people who are setting up the equivalent of S.P.E.C.T.R.E won't wait until the political or economic situation  of Apple, the leading music player manufacturer, will allow them to purchase, or negotiate a time time to attack \"filesharers\" in that fashion?  \nThat being said, it's a good idea in principle:  People who share my music taste to a high degree, are almost always people I can get along with.  But share my mp3 list with Apple's backend?  Perhaps not.  Last.fm is ok, or SomaFM for variety.  I don't need to be a data source any more than I am.\n\nA: Ping does not let me like music unless it is in iTunes, which sharply limits its value as a discovery tool.\n\nA: Remove: ping\nAdd: Facebook\nInstead of trying to create a new social network (which people are quite reluctant to change) they should have partnered with Facebook. Or at least tied into Facebook so that you could find friends using Facebook. \n", "Q: Newly Installed App (gem) Via Terminal, Path? I have used sudo gem install to install a few gems.

I have a tangled mess of python installations on my laptop.  I was looking at the executables in /usr/local/bin and they are all symbolic links to ../../../Library......\nThere's some weird behavior surrounding this.  If I do ls -lhaG I see ---> and the relative path to the right of the symlinks:\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel    69B Dec  7 22:29 python3 -> ../../../Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.1/bin/python3\n\nHowever, I can't seem to get any of the command line tools to resolve that path and display the actual path to python3.  I've found some tidbits here and there regarding use of pwd -P and the find utility to do this.  The problem is that these don't seem to work on OS X the way that people describe them working on linux (i.e. outputting the full path to the symbolic link).  They just print the symbolic links path for me:\nFantasticMrFox:bin robert$ pwd -P python3\n/usr/local/bin\nFantasticMrFox:bin robert$ find `pwd -P` -name python3\n/usr/local/bin/python3\n\nAny ideas on what's going on here?\n\nA: I think that pwd -P and readlink are going to be your friends for this task.\n\"How can I get the behavior of GNU's readlink -f on a Mac?\" is a handy resource.\npwd -P only works if you're inside the symlink directory:\n14:07:13 jason@mac ~ $ cd bin\n14:08:08 jason@mac bin $ pwd -P\n/Users/jason/Applications\n\nreadlink works by specifying the target (thus it can be used against files):\n14:09:03 jason@mac ~ $ readlink bin\nApplications\n\n14:09:34 jason@mac ~ $ readlink /var\nprivate/var\n\nThe output of readlink appears to be relative to the parent of the specified target.\nEx: The parent of /var is /, so private/var is correct, relative to /. Per my above example of bin -> Applications, both are in my Home Directory, no matter where I run it, the output is the same.\n\nA: GNU coreutils-8.15 added in 2012 a new command-line tool realpath that does what you want: it resolves chains of symbolic links and outputs the result as either an absolute (default) or relative path.\nApple does not yet include realpath in macOS (they sadly seem to shun all GPLv3 tools), but you can easily install it yourself, e.g. using Homebrew: brew install coreutils.\n\nA: In zsh:\necho /usr/local/bin/python3(:A)\n\nOr more robustly, in case there are backslashes in the path:\nprint -lr -- /usr/local/bin/python3(:A)\n\nThis prints the absolute path to the file with all symbolic links resolved (i.e. it's equivalent to GNU readlink -f, not to a plain readlink).\nExplanation: the parentheses (…) at the end of a word surround a list of glob qualifiers. A colon : in the list of glob qualifiers starts a list of history modifiers. The history modifier A turns the given path into an absolute path and resolves all symbolic links.\nIf this is the python3 in your $PATH, you can save typing with equals expansion.\necho =python3(:A)\n\nEven if you aren't running zsh, you can invoke it just for that.\nzsh -c 'echo /usr/local/bin/python3(:A)\n\nor (putting the history modifier directly on the parameter expansion)\nzsh -c 'echo $0:A' /usr/local/bin/python3\n\n\npwd -P can work as well, but only for a (symlink to a) directory. pwd only prints information about the current directory.

A recent update to macOS (12.3) has apparently introduced readlink -f natively as well.\nDeveloping a solution in Bash to do the job across more platforms is a tricky problem, but the following canonpath function correctly handles the edge cases that cause some simpler solutions to fail:\ncanonpath() (\n    # Print absolute canonical path, like GNU's `readlink -f`\n    # - target may be symlink, file or directory; path may contain ., .., symlinks\n    tgt=${1:?Non-null path required for canonpath}\n    [[ -e $tgt ]] || { echo >&2 \"target path must exist\"; return 2; }\n\n    # resolve symlink(s) at basename (possible chain)\n    while [[ -L $tgt ]]; do\n        tgt_dir=$(dirname -- \"$tgt\")\n        tgt=$(readlink \"$tgt\")\n\n        # handle relative symlink and tgt_dir=/\n        [[ ${tgt:0:1} == / ]] || tgt=${tgt_dir%/}/$tgt\n    done\n\n    _canon_dir() ( builtin cd -P \"$1\" &>/dev/null && pwd; )\n\n    if [[ -d $tgt ]]; then\n        # handle paths like this/is/a/link/..\n        printf '%s\\n' \"$(_canon_dir \"$tgt\")\"\n\n    elif [[ -f $tgt ]]; then\n        printf '%s/%s\\n' \"$(_canon_dir \"$(dirname -- \"$tgt\")\")\" \"$(basename -- \"$tgt\")\"\n\n    else\n        echo >&2 \"unknown file type\"\n        return 3\n    fi\n)\n\nTesting examples:\n# use `set -vx` if you want to see the gory details of unwinding the paths\n# can also compare against `greadlink -f` if you have installed it with homebrew\n\ncanonpath /var\n# outputs /private/var on macOS\n\nln -s ~/Documents /tmp/alink\ncanonpath /tmp/alink/..\n# outputs HOME path as expected\n\nln -s /etc /tmp/e\nmkdir /tmp/a && cd /tmp/a\nln -s ../e b\ncd ..\ncanonpath a/b\n# outputs /private/etc on macOS\n\ntouch /tmp/f\ncd /tmp/a\nln -s ../f\ncd ..\ncanonpath a/f\n# outputs /private/tmp/f on macOS\n# rm e f a/b a/f && rmdir a\n\nHandling paths that don't exist\nThere is a small difference in functionality between the canonpath function above and GNU's readlink -f, in that canonpath explicitly requires that the path must exist. readlink -f allows the final path element to be a broken symlink, or simply non-existent. The function could be adapted to accommodate this functionality, but I suggest simply testing for path existence before calling canonpath, and passing the parent directory of a non-existent path if necessary.\n\nA: You may use readlink -f. It recurses through all the links. Suppose the link is to a path that is further a link. You would like to have the final absolute path. \n", "Q: Changing modifier keys from the command line As a heavy Emacs user, I like to remap my Caps Lock key to function as the Ctrl key.

For instance, I often have\n  10-15 separate PDF documents open.\n  It's a mess to keep track of them on\n  the dock.\n\n-- Harry Gindi\n\nA: A quasi-replacement worth considering is Quicksilver (download: https://qsapp.com/ and guide: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBvFUhTqKK4), used by a large number of devout users.\nThough, that it depends on what you're looking to replace: access to apps, documents, tasks etc? It should work great. If you want something that looks vaguely like a dock/taskbar/GNOME panel, it won't replace that.\n\nA: http://brawersoftware.com/products/ubar\nI was impressed with this. It is the closest thing to a task bar replacement I found. Some of its behavior annoyed me so I did not purchase it at the end of the trial. You may fare diffently.\nThe DOCK is rather ill conceived for a variety of reasons, but programs leaving the dock when open is a huge one. Finding open windows is OSX is far more difficult than in Windows. alt-tab > cmd+tab then cmd+~. Seeing the window clearly on the task bar is also nice.\nEDIT: I found this forum while looking for a replacement for ubar. I was unable to find one worth a crap. So I ended up buying Ubar, even tho it has some issues. Even with its issues it is better than the dock. The dock is a common complaint for windows users; this isnt a case of stubborn users rejecting change or a different way of doing things. This is a case of the taskbar really being the better way fulfill these functions. \n\nA: HyperDock gives you window previews for each running app in the dock, which helps tremendously. \n\n\nA: Ubar is very nice. But I don't think it's a dock replacement. Because for me a big job of the dock is the list of icons for my commonly used apps.

Is this normal? I've been having some trouble with one of the third-party apps on my iPod Touch 4gen, and realized that a lot of apps I use (which isn't many) have been spontaneously exiting, recently.  Safari and Youtube both did this a few times today.\nIs this normal?  iOS apps tend to go back to what they were doing, so it's not that big a deal, but perhaps it's indicative of some hardware or software issue.\nI'm using iOS 4.2.1.  I don't remember it being quite this bad on 4.1, but that could well just be my imagination.\nI looked for crash logs on my computer, but there's been no crash logs created in over a week, even for apps which I know have crashed many times since then.  I don't know what that means, if anything.\nShould I be concerned?  Is there anything I can do?  Is there some kind of \"is my iPod completely &#@!ed?\" diagnostic I should run?  I realize this is kind of a vague question.\n\nA: It could be a low memory issue. iOS is supposed to manage memory automatically, but I've found that it's not always perfect. Try quitting every single app and restart the device (hold the power button down for several seconds, then slide to power off, then power on again) to see if that fixes it.\n\nA: Until recently, iOS apps had no automatic memory management mechanism. Thus, developers had to track memory allocations and release them manually. Most developers were good with this. Apple provides tools to check for various kinds of leaks. This is in contrast to Mac apps, that do have semi-automatic memory management via garbage collection.\nSome iOS developers did not perform enough testing, or could not find the cause of the leaks, and the App Store checks only for content, not app malfunctions, although of course, if an app is DOA, it is rejected.\nWith iOS 5, the situation for iOS developers improved. A new memory management system called Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) was introduced. iOS runtime takes care of memory management in app.\nApple provides a handy tool in Xcode to convert apps to make use of ARC.\nSo, developers now can improve their apps so that the only crashing that happens is with virtual race cars!\n\nA: I browsed on internet and found that app crashing is associated process to low memory and that's why to adjust the processing speed, it simply shuts off the process. Then reboot, refresh and blah blah blah....\nI found 2 main causes:\n\n*\n\n*Refreshing rate: I think iOS devices use Dynamic Ram which needs refreshing/rebooting. When we switch on the iOS device. iOS loads and we never shut it off so the OS stays in RAM. Considering this with PC. We boot and OS comes to RAM, we start process and then after using it we shut down. It means every process which was in RAM was sent back to permanent memory with OS as well.\nWe generally do not shut off the iPad and that's why the OS has a permanent sector in RAM, As the RAM is dynamic it needs to be refreshed but we do not do. Hence it's virtual memory becomes too low and hanging occurs.\n\n\n*Single tasking device: one process at a time. So earlier devices do hang and applications crash.\nLet me know your comments.\n", "Q: iPhoto and unknown RAW Formats I have a Camera that supports RAW (Panasonic Lumix FZ35), but sadly iPhoto (and Aperture) don't support this format.\nShort of reporting Feedback to Apple and hoping for the best, is there any other way to make iPhoto work with this RAW Format, like a \"Plugin\" that integrates neatly into iPhoto?\nI want to avoit having to use Photoshop to edit/convert them to JPG and then put those JPGs into iPhoto.\n\nA: A lot of cameras come with software to convert their RAW files to other formats. If your's comes with conversion then see if it supports regular TIFF. \nYou might want to look into GIMP, which is a graphic program from the *nix world that runs under X11 on the Macintosh. It's very similar to Photoshop but is free. It has some auto conversion capability and/or might be able to read your camera's RAW files. GraphicConverter might be another option. It's got a long list of formats it supports and converts between.\nConverting to JPG changes the file format in ways that make it a lot less flexible. I have my own photography company, and only shoot RAW when I'm doing serious work, because I need the flexibility of non-jpeg. I convert to Photoshop format and do all my manipulation in their format, then save a copy of the final image in Adobe's Photoshop format, then make another copy and save it as JPG, ready for sending to the place that does my prints. RAW and TIFF support better color and greater gamut (light range from dark to light) and you can see the difference after converting to jpeg so I want to avoid the conversion until the last step.\n\nA: Converting to something that isn't RAW means you'll lose data. GIMP and Photoshop are essentially raster image editors so you lose that very useful camera data.\nSilkypix is another good alternative for RAW editing and conversion and it supports a huge list of cameras. It is a non-destructive editor so any editing you do leaves the original file unharmed.\n", "Q: Preview line and half-page scrolling While two-finger scrolling in Preview is nice, it is not very comfortable when slowly reading very long PDFs.\nWhat I've figured out to this point is that I can use space and ⇧+space to move forward and back a page at a time; and ↓ and ↑ arrows to move a couple pixels down.\nIs there any way I can set the arrows to move down a line at a time? (Note that with zoomed in document for reading, it takes 3-4 key presses to move down a line)\nOr, any way I can set space to move down only half a page?\nMaybe there are some other tips for comfortably reading/scrolling long documents?\n\nA: I do not think line or half-page scrolling is possible. I'm not even sure that PDFs have, embedded, a concept of \"line\". I think that Preview tries to detect that for the purposes of selecting text (major improvements on this from 10.5 to 10.6).\nYou could set up a program (AppleScript, Automator, etc.), that simulates pressing the down arrow a certain number of times. Now, perhaps you click on the app in the Dock or run it via a keyboard shortcut, or even via a Voice Command, and it will scroll the amount you set it to scroll.\n", "Q: Ubuntu bootable USB drive does not show up as bootable I tried to make a bootable Ubuntu installation USB drive according to these instructions.\nHowever, when the procedure is finished, the USB drive does not show up in the \"Startup Manager\", nor does it show up on boot with alt pressed. What could I have missed?\nEDIT:\nTo clear things out; what I want to do is to end up with a dual boot system with MacOSX and Ubuntu 10.10.

It’s as if this question belonged on Ubuntu’s forums :)\nIn any case, I’m assuming you have some Mac computer and want to install or Boot an operating system other than Windows via BootCamp or the native OS X. In your example you need to boot from Ubuntu.\nTurns out your Mac uses EFI instead of the archaic BIOS. So you need a little “helper” program in the boot process to tell the EFI to also look elsewhere. \nThe steps for installing the tools and the process are perfectly described in the Ubuntu Community Wiki.\nBefore you go there, bear in mind the following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*The instructions do not work for new iMacs.\n\n*The instructions are for CD booting (tho you have a link for USB at some point in the document).\n\n*You will need to install rEFIt, I did it on an old Macbook (White) and had zero problems, but the usual warning about “have a backup” applies. \n\n\nA: If you want to boot from USB you must reformatted your device in a new partition format specific to Intel-based Macs called GUID Partition Table (GPT).\nIn a Intel-based systems, like the MacBook Pro, you can boot from external USB drives, if drive is formatted appropriately (GPT) and a compatible version of Mac OS X is installed.(like OS X on USB Drive for MacBook Air)\nSo you can't boot bootable Ubuntu USB by default with your macbook pro because have different Partition table(at least I can't do that).\nBut I some where read that you can do this if you install rEFIt (you can continue his toturial here)\n", "Q: iPod Touch 4th Gen dock with AC or USB power and audio out?

The problem is that there is a limit to the number of devices that can connect to the Express, and this limit is being reached every now and then.\n\nA: One way of doing this (like they said in the comments) would be to enable allowed Access control and specifying which devices are allowed to access the express.

Is there a difference between bulk-moving files with Drag & Drop vs mv?\nUse case:\nVolume External_Drive_A has about 8000 files totalling 9GB. External_Drive_B has 74GB of free space. The desired end result is to move all the files from A to B so that A can be wiped and put to use in another location. \nDrag & Drop approach is to open one Finder window for A, another Finder window for B, highlight all the files on A, then command-click-drag them to B.\nmv approach is to open a Terminal session and invoke \nmkdir /Volumes/External_Drive_B/A_legacy\nmv /Volumes/External_Drive_A/* /Volumes/External_Drive/B/A_legacy/\n\nDoes Drag & Drop do anything behind-the-scenes in addition to the copy and remove, or is it strictly a thing of Beauty? \nAnswered by jmlumpkin below: \nThey differ! Drag & Drop brings the metadata, mv does not. I tested this by adding a phrase to the Spotlight Comments section on a text file's Get Info dialog. When I dragged and dropped the file across volumes, the phrase was present when I invoked Get Info on the destination; but when it used mv, the phrase was missing when I invoked Get Info on the destination.\n\nA: Do not use mv or drag&drop for moving data between volumes.\nIf anything bad happens during the operation, you will end up with half the data here and half the data there, and it will be hard to figure out where to restart. If this is done over the network, you may not even still have all the data on either volume.\nDo a copy (command line or drag&drop), and after that succeeded, delete the source. \n\nA: In earlier versions of the Mac OS, Dragging and Dropping a file was actually closer to the 'ditto' command to retain resource forks, etc. \n\nA: The end result is probably the same, but I would guess that edge cases might be treated differently, also depending on which mv you use (the default in /bin/ or a GNU version in /sw/bin/ from fink, or from macports, etc.)\nFor example, an OS X alias or resource forks might not be treated properly by the unix toolchain, and there are probably cases where low-level unix file things might not be handled by the OS X drag-and-drop.\n", "Q: How to automate DropBox startup without logging in I'd like to have DropBox running under multiple user accounts on a Mac, even after a reboot.

I use iPhoto to manage my pictures.  I have, therefore, over several years gained quite a set of Events as iPhoto calls them.\nI also have lots of one-off pictures that people send me that I want to keep.  Not sure they deserve their own event, though, as the Events page is becoming pretty large.\nWhat is a reasonable way to manage these pictures (and I hope that this questions meets the subjectivity benchmark)?  Make a \"Single Picture\" event?  Do pictures even have to be part of events, but if not, how do I find them again?\n\nA: Photos need to be part of events; deleting a photo from an event deletes the photo from your Photo Library (unlike albums where deleting the photo just removes it from the album). If I was you I'd create a 'One-Off' or 'Photos I like' event. \nYou could create a big event for everything you don't want to be in its own event folder. This should let the Events feature be used for what it's designed for - organising your photos by significant dates. If Events seems like too much hassle then you can just ignore them all together, make your own albums and organise them manually. \nPersonally I just use events to find photos from 'the picnic' or 'that time we went to the airport', I don't bother organising or sorting my events. \n\nA: Personally, what I do, is make a folder called \"Random Pics\", and whenever I have single picture events, I just grab them in the Events view and drag them on top of the the \"Random Pics\" event and it adds the pics to that event and gets rid of the single photo event.\n", "Q: When re-importing music in iTunes, is there a way to set \"Replace Existing\" as the default and skip the dialog? I lost a big chunk of my iTunes library due to a disk failure.  The database is fine, but the song files are missing.

Do you want to replace existing songs and import them again? [Replace Existing] [Cancel] [Don't Replace]\n\nSo far so good.  The trouble is that my library is hosted on a headless G4 Mini, and it's inconvenient to hit \"Replace Existing\" every time.  Even if I connect a monitor and keyboard, the dialog takes a little while to come up, and I'd like to just swap CDs in and out whenever I walk through the living room.  There's a few hundred CDs to re-import so I don't want to babysit the process.\nI thought about writing an AppleScript to push \"Replace Existing\" for me, but there doesn't seem to be a way to wait on dialog events.  I looked around the iTunes prefs files, etc., for some \"always replace existing\" option, but no luck.\nI figure this is a long shot, but does anyone have any ideas on how to skip the \"Replace Existing\" dialog or otherwise make this process go more smoothly?  \n\nA: If you have enough disk space, maybe you can import the CDs into a new iTunes library, and when it is all done, import again (in one go) from there into the real one? \n\nA: tell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"iTunes\"\n        repeat\n            -- say \"Checking for Dialog Box\"\n            try\n                 click button \"Replace Existing\" of window 1\n                 -- say \"Clicked Replace Existing.

I did a stupid thing with one Event in iPhoto library.

(new to iPhoto usage ;-))\nSo the big task I have is to delete the possible duplicates of 350 photos. Is there any tool/ option in iPhoto/ apple script etc.. to accomplish task ?\n\nA: Just because there are duplicates within iPhoto, doesn't mean that iPhoto actually has duplicated the file.  Navigate to ~/Pictures/.  Right-click on iPhoto Library, show package contents.  Find your event within Originals/<year>/<event name>.  Backup the directory.  Remove the event from iPhoto - I don't know if this removes the actual folder or not, that's why I suggested backing it up first.  Re-add it.

MIDI support is optional, but probably already there on any piece of software like this.\nI've used LMMS in the past, which (aside from the hard coded AZERTY input method) was a wonderfully simple program that offered plenty of high-end VSTs and features to grow into.\n\nA: You have this in GarageBand. Keyboard mapping. \n\nIf you decide, one day, to link a midi keayboard, the only thing you need is the Midi to USB cable. Nothing else.\n\nA: Give Renoise a try — it's keyboard-centric, and supports VST and AU.\n", "Q: Why is the input level of the external mic so low? I try to use an external mic to make some audio recordings. But the level of the input is really low ! In fact, the internal build-in mac has a better input level than the external one that is closer to my mouth !\nDid I miss something about audio recording ?\n\nA: Microphones are hooked up to a pre-amp to boost the signal before recording. The internal microphone on the Mac probably has a built-in pre-amp while the external jack doesn't. Typically external mikes are connected to a sound or mixing board before hooking up to a computer.\n", "Q: iPhone data usage broken down by app My iPhone 4 data usage suddenly spiked. From using 30-40% of my monthly allowance in the average month (3-400Mb out of a allowed 1Gb), recently I used 175% (1.75Gb) in a single day. \nI have to assume that they numbers from my carrier are more or less correct. The figure shown in Settings > General > Usage more or less tallies with their report. \nThere are a few apps (DataMon, etc.) which will monitor usage as a whole, but I'd like an app which can break down my usage by which app is consuming the data. (Ideally 3G vs Wifi too.) \nDoes anything like this exist - or can it even exist? My iOS coding skillz are not strong, and I can't think how I could do this, but that certainly does not mean that no-one else can. \nNB. I'm not too concerned about challenging the figure, I trust it to be reasonably correct based on past performance, but I'd quite like to be able to monitor the apps and decommission those which seem to be using a disproportionate amount. \n\nA: I know this doesn't answer the question specifically, but are you sure you are on wi-fi when its available and not just solely on 3G? I've made that switch in the past and forgotten to go back. Also, have you installed any apps recently around the time the spike occrured?\n\nA: Onavo (available via iTunes) is a great app to monitor and breakdown your usages, it displays data usage by app and compressed data over 3G. \nEDIT: The primary goal of this app is to reduce data volume by routing all traffic through Onavo's servers and compressing the data between the phone and the server. Depending on your privacy needs this may not be acceptable for you.\n", "Q: Apple TV subtitles How can I find out if (and what languages) subtitles are included in Apple TV movies before i buy it?\n\nA: Is this for translation or closed-captioning purposes?

It always takes close to a second before anything responds to a mouse click, and moving/resizing images is a pain also because the response is so slow.\nQuestion: Is this typical OpenOffice.org/NeoOffice behavior in Mac OS X? Or is there a way to optimise its performance? I doubt it's my hardware being insufficient!\n\nA: I would also take a look at LibreOffice, which is the more open fork of OpenOffice, having used OpenOffice and NeoOffice, LibreOffice is cleaner on OS X then OpenOffice, and does not suffer from the slowness that seems to plague NeoOffice.\n\nA: I do not agree with any of the opinions provided here regarding NeoOffice. \nI have used NeoOffice for eight years, as each new version came out. Today I also use OpenOffice and LibreOffice, and I can tell you from my experience that NeoOffice is in no way inferior to those other programs.\nI find NeoOffice to be faster than OpenOffice.org (which has all but been discontinued in its development) and LibreOffice. NeoOffice's strength is that it is better integrated into Mac OS X than either OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice. It feels more \"Mac-like\" and uses Mac features, such as the system-wide spell check and Services in some cases. NeoOffice is quirky in places, but the full release version of NeoOffice is not buggy. It is quite stable. Of course if you are working with a beta version of any program, you can expect bugs. I'm using NeoOffice 3.2.1 beta right now myself.\nFurthermore, the latest version in beta, 3.2.1, removes much of the deprecated code and replaces it with more up-to-date methods.\nhttp://neowiki.neooffice.org/index.php/Mac_OS_X_Upgrade_Issues\n\nNeoOffice developers have reimplemented all of the text layout code\n  using the \"CoreText\" functions in NeoOffice 3.2 Beta.\n\nI am upset with the tone of many comments made here. Several people who admit to never having actually used NeoOffice have condemned it as being buggy or inferior and say \"Why not use something else?\". \nWhy do other posters spread slander and gossip about a program they have no direct experience with? It would be better for you not to post at all if you admit that you don't know what you are talking about.\n\nA: There is a specific reason that NeoOffice, for several years, hung on to deprecated code. This is that NeoOffice was, for several years, the only fork of OpenOffice.org that would run on PowerPC Macs as well as Intel Macs. OpenOffice for Mac, since its first version for Mac, would only run on Intel Macs, so the developers of NeoOffice deliberately back-ported the OpenOffice code to provide NeoOffice to users that still had PowerPC Macs. This was a valuable service to those users.\nTherefore compatibility with PowerPC Macs running Mac OS X 10.4 was a design decision aimed at providing G3, G4 and G5 Mac owners a free office suite. It was the only such program available for that hardware.\nIt is only in 2011, with version 3.2 and higher, that NeoOffice is being developed more strictly with Intel Macs in mind, on the understanding that today there are very few users who still rely on PowerPC Macs.\n\nA: NeoOffice works ok, but it uses certain technology that is deprecated by Apple. I was trying to find out about that, when I realized that it’s in the front page of NeoOffice. It’s kind of they know that their Java Implementation is using older (and deprecated) APIs…\nIn any case, here’s the neowiki entry about NeoOffice potential problems with Lion, which describes the three deprecated services being used. \nTL;DR Version: They don’t use NSPasteboard and CoreText… this is fail. And of course the future of Java in OS X is, although “guaranteed to exist”, uncertain in compatibility levels. Write Once, Cry Everywhere™. ;)\n", "Q: Passing selected folder path to custom Service executing AppleScript I have a custom Service I created in Automator. Right now, the service shows up in my context (right-click) menu, when right-clicking on any folder. In Automator, I added the Run AppleScript action, to execute this code:\non run {input, parameters}\n    do shell script \"/usr/bin/find ./ -type f -name .DS_Store -delete -print\"\n    return input\nend run\n\nMy objective is to delete all .DS_Store files in the selected folder (and all folders within it). I normally do this in Terminal by executing /usr/bin/find /path-to-folder -type f -name .DS_Store -delete -print, but I would love to get this to work from my custom Service.\nI'm thinking I need to pass the selected folders path to the AppleScript function (through input perhaps?), but I have no idea how, nor do I see any actions in Automator to pass this. I'm using OS X 10.6.5. Any ideas or suggestions?\n\nA: At the top of the screen, above your action, there should be a list-box that says Service receives selected <text> in <any application>.  Changing <text> to folders should give you the folders as input.\n", "Q: How to change AppleScript path to a Terminal-style path? I have a custom Service that I've created in Automater (I'm on OS X 10.6.5). The Service executes an AppleScript which in turn executes a shell script. Here is the AppleScript:\non run {input, parameters}\n    -- do shell script \"/usr/bin/find \" & input & \" -type f -name .DS_Store -delete -print\"\n    display alert \"Path: \" & input\nend run\n\nThe problem is, the path passed by the Service (in the variable input) looks like:\nMacintosh HD:Users:Matthew:Documents:Programming:Apple Scripts:\n\nAnd for the command to execute properly, the path needs to look like:\nMacintosh\\ HD/Users/Matthew/Documents/Programming/Apple\\ Scripts/\n\nSo, is there a way to translate the first path to the second path? I was hoping for a core function which handles this. But I suppose some kind of regex/find/replace/etc would work? I'm familiar with HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP, not with Cocoa/AppleScript/C. Any direction or suggestions would be great!\n\nA: Use quoted form of the POSIX path of input.  Without the quoted form of part, it won't handle funny characters (like spaces) in filenames correctly.  See this Apple technote.\n\nA: Ok...this was easier than I had realized. After some Googling, it looks like what I need here is the POSIX path of command. This converts a given path to a Unix style path, which is the type of path you would see/use in Terminal. So:\nPOSIX path of input\n\nGives me a path like:\n/Users/Matthew/Documents/Programming/Apple Scripts/\n\nIt seems to take into account that you just need a / at the beginning of the path, rather than the hard drive name. It does not, however, escape \\ spaces (or handle special characters) in the path. So, as the other answer here mentions, you need to place the path in quotes ( \" or ' ) in order for those spaces (or special characters) to be interpreted literally. You accomplish this by using quoted form of. Here it is:\nquoted form of the POSIX path of the input\n-- gives a path like: '/Users/Matthew/Documents/Programming/Apple Scripts/'\n\n", "Q: will running Google Latitude (or any similar app) in the background significantly affect battery life? I have installed Google Latitude and am wondering how much quicker my battery will run flat? I know the way Apple implemented its \"mutitasking\" framework minimises the impact?\n\nA: Specifically, the Latitude app (and other background location-updating apps) register themselves for location updates \"on significant location change\". \nHow the phone knows the location has changed significantly is when the phone does a cell tower handoff. It's moved enough that it's out of range of the tower it was talking to and its service is handed to the next tower. At that time, if any apps are registered for location updates, the phone fires up its GPS, gets its coordinates, and feeds them to those apps. Those apps then get to do a LITTLE work with what they were told.\nWhen iOS 4 came out, I wrote a little app to play with this API. Basically it just sat in the background and recorded lat/lng for every update it got. Between my office and my house (like 10 miles) it got eight or nine sets of coordinates.\nThat means eight or nine times (call it once a mile or so) that the phone has to fire up the GPS chip, listen for signals from outer space, and do something with them. That obviously takes up more electricity than if it didn't have to do that.\nIs it MUCH more? You know what? Not really. I charge my phone when it needs it (rather than, say, nightly), and I didn't notice it needing it more than usual when my little app was running. So my guess is that Latitude won't be a major battery suck. But it'll definitely suck some.\n\nA: Yes, any app that runs in the background needs some attention from the CPU, and this costs battery power. Further, if the app needs GPS and/or 3G service or other battery-intensive services, then of course the battery will deplete even faster.\nBut depending on your situation and circumstances, this can be a trade-off that's worth it, especially if you only need to do this for shorter periods of time.\n\nA: Due to the way multitasking is done in iOS 4, Apple tried to implement it in a way to reduce this as much as possible. For example, with the latitude app, it can only poll and post location information at certain intervals. \nSo, yes, any background app actually working (like GPS or Upload type apps) will use a little more resources than a phone not running them. \nBut, if one were to run this type of app fully in the background (for example, how some jailbroken apps do), it would be using a significant amount more of power. \n", "Q: Are there any free alternatives to finder? Relatively new to the Mac world, I still find the 'Finder' not really that user friendly.\nWhat free alternatives to Finder exist?\n*I mean really file browsers, not application launchers like Quicksilver, Launchy etc..\n\nA: muCommander is a free Finder alternative, if that type of application suites you. (Dual-pane Norton Commander like).\n\nA: I don't know the good free alternatives, but PathFinder is the best file manager I have ever used, and probably one of the best desktop apps I've ever used. The features I use most\n\n\n*\n\n*Bookmarks and multiple tabs\n\n*Multiple panes \n\n*Side panes with folder shortcuts\n\n*Drop stack\n\n\nMost importantly, it's not clunky (relatively) and is very reliable. It was worth every cent I paid for it.\n\nA: Here's some free alternatives\nXfolders and MuCommander are free.\n\nA: Another free alternative is xtrafinder http://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/\n\nA: Moroshka file manager (free) - in beta, however, but it may suit your needs: \nI have not yet used it, so offered under advisement (no reflection on product, though!)\n\nA: Finder uses spaces and sub-spaces to organize our information. An alternative or a complementarity would be the use of TIME to organize our information. Here is a video presentation : hipSpace \nEdit: ok, I am the developer of hipSpace, but my app really answers to that question. Just \"Save as…\" your files in the \"hipSpace\" folder, that all ! When there are too much files in the space, Release them. It will be easy to retrieve them using the Time navigation (rather than the space navigation of the Finder). \n", "Q: How do I download photos from my iPhone? I find it very complicated to move photos taken with my iPhone into my pc's photo library. \nI used to take photos with a compact camera, and pc applications could very easily import the photos because the compact camera shows up as a USB disk -- this way, importing photos was almost a one-click process!\nBut the iPhone doesn't show up as a disk, and that makes it very messy. I've tried to sync using iTunes, but syncing is not what I want to achieve. I want to move the pics away from the iPhone! I've tried moving them using iFunBox, and while that works, it creates the problem that all photos to get a new timestamp which ruins my photo library.\nQuestion:\nHow can I easily move photos and videos from iPhone to PC without using iTunes syncing, and keeping the files' original timestamps? \nClarifications:\nI'm using Windows 7, and the phone is already jailbroken. I'm looking for a solution that will allow Windows to see the phone's native file system as a normal USB drive from which I can import the pics&vids using a Windows program -- or any other solution that comes as close as possible to this.\nUpdate:\nBased on the solutions so far it is clear that extra pc applications won't help. What I need instead is some way of getting the damn phone to present itself to Windows using a drive letter, just like any other disk resource or compact camera does. \nThis is a good example where I think Apple is being too restrictive with their products; if people want access, then let them have it. If they break it, it's their problem. That's what backups are for. \"It just works\" only works if you stick by Apple's intended use, and that doesn't include Windows drive letters.\n\nA: When I connect my iPhone to a Windows machine, it does appear as a digital camera and allows me to copy files from the DCIM folder or to use the \"Import Pictures\" option from Windows.\nI just tried this in a Windows 7 VM and was able to view all the pictures in my Camera Roll.\nFrom there, I could drag and drop pictures to my desktop.\nI don't have iTunes installed in the Windows 7 VM.\nIt works the same way in my Windows XP machine, at work. There it is a physical machine and I have iTunes installed, but I can copy the pictures from the iPhone without syncing, anyway.\n\nA: What about this solution?\n\nWith the plug-in you can manage music, videos, podcasts and photos for your iPod. You can >add all those files to your iPod, delete and organize them into playlists as well as smart >playlists. \nInstall WinAmp + mliPod on your computer\nTo manage your iPod you need two\n  files, WinAmp itself and the above\n  mentioned plug-in mliPod.\nDownload\n  directly from WinAmp\nDownload mliPod\n\n\nA: Creation and modification dates in the Finder or in Windows are never completely reliable as they can be changed by almost anything (as you have noticed). The photos have the real time stamps held internally in the files themselves and any image management software should be going by those, not by what you see in the OS' file system,\nApplications like iFunBox on Windows and Image Capture on the Mac to manage file downloads from devices are really the only alternatives to iTunes or iLife.\nUPDATE: Do not jailbreak your iPhone. It's usually unnecessary and it voids your warranty. One viable option is to look at PhoneView which offers a disk mode. You don't say what platform you're on, but I've used that in the past on my Mac before I purchased iLife.\nI think no matter what, the creation and modification dates in the OS are going to be problematic for you because the files will be new to the OS.\n\nA: Have you seen the free app, WiFi Photo Transfer? \nNot sure about timestamps on video, but it's great for quickly grabbing photos and video off your iOS device.  Especially since it will zip up photos.\n\nA: I think you can do this by using Diskaid - http://www.digidna.net/products/diskaid \nIt works for Win7 and for both jailbroken and non-j... phones.\nYou could also give Sharepod at getsharepod.com a try.\n\nA: Here's how I fixed it in Windows 7:\n* Press the Windows Start Button\n* Select Devices and Printers\n* Find the Apple iPhone icon (for me it was under Unspecified)\n* Right-click\n* Select Troubleshoot  \nThat fixed it and then I was able to browse the phone like a regular drive\n", "Q: Tools or scripts for tracking a stolen or lost Mac? Actually I do use the prey project but was wondering about other tools or scripts one could use to find back information about a lost/stolen Mac.\nWith features like:\n-Getting the ip address or any other localization information.\n-Triggering the webcam remotely.\n-Protect/destroy personal files remotely\n\nA: One of the more popular ones is Lojack, a pretty well-respected software program for both Mac and Windows.\n\nA: Take a look at Undercover: it does all that you need, and more (simulating hardware failure, etc.).  \nTheir recovery stories section is quite encouraging, too.\n\nA: If you are comfortable writing your own script, it is very easy to make a LaunchAgent that uses curl to check for a file on a site you maintain. Web logs now show you the IP. If you put commands in that file, the script on the computer can take action based on those commands.\nisightcapture can be used to take images from the camera, and screencapture of the desktop (showing email accounts of the unauthorized users).\nAnd of course DropBox. If you keep your important documents there, then you can easily delete them. If you want to transfer images from iSight or screencapture off, you can do so. If you want to transfer images on, or upload scripts that a local agent will run, etc, you can do all that very easily.\nMarcoPolo could be used to take a screenshot and an iSight image each and every time the computer wakes up or changes network, and email those images (along with IP) to an email account, which you only need to check if you don't know where or who is using the laptop.\n\nA: I'll throw a couple more track-spy-recover products into the list: BAK2u's Phoenix Anti-theft and GadgetTrak.  I have no experience with either, so you'll have to make your own judgements.\n", "Q: Front Row and iTunes \"watched\" flags out of sync The watched flag and playback positions in Front Row are no longer in sync with iTunes. Is there any way to resynchronize them?\nIf it matters, I would rather iTunes' positions replace Front Row's.\nThese two questions on Apple Support were not useful.\nThe Cause\nI recently crashed, presumably while iTunes was writing the iTunes Library and upon restart, it was \"imported\", with the damaged copy saved elsewhere. I still have the same iTunes Library identifier because my iPod and iPad sync as usual (rather than complaining that they're synced with another library as happens when you delete and rebuild iTunes Library.xml).\n\nA: I cannot help with your original question, but you may be interested to know that Front Row was quietly removed from Lion, so if you have any imminent plans to upgrade, then it may be worth bearing in mind that you could be wasting your time trying to fix this.\n", "Q: Connecting a MacBook Pro to a Windows ad hoc network I'm trying to share my wired ethernet connection from my Windows 7 laptop with my MacBook Pro (running 10.6.5). I've just set it up to be an open network; no encryption. I'm pretty sure I set up the ad hoc network correctly, it's broadcasting, and I can connect to the network on the mac. \nThe catch is that the network shows up under the \"Devices\" part of the menu, rather than the main networks area. I can't browse to any websites, nor connect to the Windows box via samba. The IP assigned is a 169.254 one.\nIs there some setting somewhere that I missed to get this to work correctly? Do I need to manually set this up some how? Here are my network settings:\n\n\nA: You've set up the connection correctly, but it looks like you haven't set the Windows machine to allow other computers on the ad-hoc network to access the internet. Here are the steps you need (shamelessly taken from this blog post):\nNote: I assume that you have ensured that the Windows machine is connected to the internet through some non-wireless method. If not, you definitely need to do that first, otherwise there's nothing to share.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Windows icon, and type View network connections and press enter.\n\n*Identify the wired internet connection and the wireless card. Locate the wired internet connection and right click on it. Select Properties.\n\n*Click on the Sharing tab.

After installing and setting up Connectify in Access Point I was able to connect successfully with the iPod Touch. (The Nokia could now at least see the network, but connection failed.)\nSome alternatives to Connectify: \nhttp://alternativeto.net/software/connectify/\n\nA: If your ad hoc address is 192.168.137.1 you should set macbook's ip to 192.168.137.2 or some address like that manually (between 192.168.137.2 and 192.168.137.254) because it is an ad hoc network with no DHCP server.

I'm on windows 7 with bootcamp with a bit older iMac. I installed the bootcamp stuff from my Leopard DVD and I updated my bootcamp to 2.0. with Apple Software Update but the Microphone is still not working. \nHow should I make the microphone work?\n\nA: Are you sure you have all the bootcamp drivers installed on the PC side of things?\nAlso, what type of microphone is it? Are there updated drivers for it?\nIs Windows even recognizing a device is attached? Can you choose it and tell it to find the newest drivers?\nEDIT:\nGo to ControlPanel > SoundAndAudioDevices and click the 'Voice' tab. Make sure the 'Voice recording' device is correctly selected and click the 'Test hardware' button. You should be able to adjust the record volume. (One possible extra step: have to go to \"advanced\" and check-mark a box for \"boost mic.\")\n\nI then determined to try the microphone with headphones on. Sound comes through crystal clear to other people with them on. I don't understand why, but just know that it works fine now. So try some headphones for a temporary fix.\n\nIf none of this works for you, it seems that there is no fix for this issue yet and it will have to take another update to the Windows Bootcamp drivers for this issue to be resolved.\n\nA: Having looked around a long time for answer to this question, I finally sorted mine out today. I have an iMac 27 inch (2013) running Windows 7 64-bit, through Boot Camp.  I have put up with using a headset microphone for a long as I can remember.\nMy solution today turned out to be stupidly simple. Go to Control Panel, Sound. Open the \"Recording\" tab. If you've got a headset connected, and you've got this problem, then I would assume the only thing you would see immediately is \"Headset Microphone\".\nNow right click in the box and you should find an option which says \"show disabled devices\". When I selected that, my on-board microphone showed up as disabled, but at least I finally had an icon for it. Then it's a matter of right clicking on the disabled microphone (icon), select Properties and near the bottom of that screen there is an options box, which should include \"Use this device (enable)\". Selecting that option brought it all to life.\n", "Q: Kingston SV100S2/128G on MacBookPro 6,2 (late 2010) issue \n*\n\n*I just upgraded the harddrive with the Kingston SSD (100V series), did restore with Time Machine, immediately noticed the battery doesn't seem to play nice, it charges, but the time estimate is quite off. On a 100% full charge, it shows it can run shy of 3 hours, with the computer doing nothing. Another thing is it seems the battery drain is crazy fast.\n\n\nDoes anyone else have the same/similar issue?\nanother thing is, I am running Snow Leopard, and Trim support says \"no\", but it is supported on my drive. is that normal? \n\nA: OS X doesn’t support the TRIM command (which is usually tied with the OS and an NTFS volume), however, a few benchmarking have apparently reach the conclusion that OS X’s performance with an SSD drive is not affected like it was in Windows (with TRIM Disabled). \nIn other words, Windows without TRIM suffered massive performance degradation over time. With TRIM, Windows did well.\nOS X, on the other hand, having no TRIM support, didn’t suffer the performance degradation in the first place. The interesting article can be found here at bit-tech.net.\nTLDR Version (and I quote): \n\nWhile we know SSD performance is affected by the OS - after all, you need Windows 7 for TRIM support - but for OS X not to suffer from performance degradation when it's using an SSD seeming stunning to the point of being difficult to believe.\n\n(Emphasis added)\nTRIM aside, your battery problem might be mitigated by a few things and there are a few recommendations about how to make it work better under OS X.\nThe original article is a blog post found here which I suggest you read for more detailed information.\nIn short: \n\n\n*\n\n*Modify Sleeping mode so it doesn’t save the content of RAM to drive when closing the lid (if you do this and remove the battery while in sleep, you lose the ram contents and will have to restart your computer). \n\n*Hard Drive Sleep: turn it off, SSD has no reason to go to sleep.\n\n*Sudden Motion Sensor: You can also disable this, an SSD has no moving mechanical parts that may be affected in case of a sudden impact. \n\n*Enable noatime for SSD filesystems. This will make the SSD write less info. (If you’re using FileVault make sure you read the article) \n\n*Spotlight: The article suggests disabling it if you don’t use it, but I wouldn’t do that. \nOn top of all that, I recommend you do a few things: \n\n\n*\n\n*Check this question and answers on this site about how to identify possible CPU processes that may be hogging your CPU and therefore eating your battery life. \n\n*Perform a full battery cycle charge. All the relevant information is in Apple’s Battery Page, which is linked in this question on this site too, with some more interesting links you might want to follow. \nTo address your question, it shouldn’t happen, as SSDs are usually more energy efficient than mechanical drives. I bet either spotlight or time machine are doing some work and draining your battery life. \nTry starting your machine in safe mode (hint: press ⇧ shift after the chime) and monitor your battery life there. Don’t forget to perform the battery tips before doing that. \n", "Q: Why does Safari cache old pages on iPhone even after you've downloaded the new page? This may be a problem specific to Reddit.com, but I find that if I follow a link to another site on mobile safari and hit back, that only part of the time will I see the latest copy of the page.  A lot of times, I'll see a copy of the page from weeks ago that mobile Safari has cached for some reason.\nFor clarity this is what happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*I visit reddit on March 1st in mobile Safari, click some links, everything works.\n\n*Later I visit reddit on March 3rd and I see the March 3rd homepage. \n\n*I click a link to visit another site off of reddit, and then click back to go back to reddit.com\n\n*I see the March 1st copy of reddit.com\n\n\nA: I would imagine this has something to do with Core Data, memory warnings, or both. If Apple is using its own kit, then it is saving the cache in a Core Data store, which is, essentially, an unordered set. My theory is that when you go to a site, Safari is going to the Core Data store and grabbing the first instance of the URL in question if it exists, which can be old, new, whatever. But since I also don't think that Apple would be nearly that sloppy, I'd say that every page attempts to cache, but the amount of data required to properly cache a site is beholden to memory warnings, which you, as the user, should never, ever see, only this time the newer page simply doesn't get cached and that's why you get random older pages in view.\nOkay, that was a bit technical. In short, I think Safari attempts to maintain a clean cache, but memory limitations of the device don't always allow that to happen.\n\nA: I'm having the same problem. If you goto Settings>Safari>Clear Cache it fixes it for a week or so. \nThe page it's happening to me on is http://www.google.com/m/ig which is my homepage in Safari I use for reading latest news and such.  \nAlso, Philip mentioned that it may be a memory problem, which may be the case on iOS4 but on my 3GS with iOS3, I never had memory problems and animations and such were excellent. I believe iOS4 is very bad at memory/application management in comparison.\n", "Q: In OS X, I want to change to a non-standard keyboard shortcut for switching spaces In System Preferences > Expose and Spaces > Spaces Tab > to switch between spaces, there is a drop down list that allows you to select a modifier key and the arrows. The arrows are so far away from the rest of the keyboard! I want to bind to the vim keys (h, j, k, l) for (left, down, up, and right). On my Ubuntu machine, I push the equivalent of command-option-j to go down a space. Does anyone know how to change to a non-standard keyboard shortcut on OS X?\n(I ran across a post that details how to change the modifiers, but still uses the arrow keys. This is not what I'm trying to do. Custom keyboard shortcuts to change active Spaces desktop)\n\nA: Go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts. Then, on the left side, select Exposé & Spaces. On the right side you will see the current keyboard shortcuts for Exposé and Spaces. If you double click on the shortcut command (literally double click ^1 for instance) you will be able to change this to whatever you want. Just do the key-combo you want to use.\nSo, once you double-click on the shortcut, it'll show it as editable. Then, press the keys you want the short cut to be, all at once, for instance press Apple and J at the same time, and it'll change the shortcut.\n\nA: I think matthepavkov has your answer, but also check out KeyRemap4MacBook for it's vi modes. \n", "Q: In Activity Monitor, how can Swap Used be more than Page Outs? I am trying to understand the relationship between Page Outs and Swap Used as displayed in Activity Monitor.  Currently, Activity Monitor shows:\nPage outs:  1.6 MB\nSwap used:  8.1 MB\nHow can there be more swap used than the amount paged out?\n\nA: My understanding is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Program needs access to some data.  Attempts to do so, and fails, due to lack of RAM.\n\n*OS takes control.  There is a page-out operation, where physical RAM is copied to swap.\n\n*There is a page-in operation, where the required data is copied to RAM.\n\n*OS gives control back to program.\n\n*Program tries again, finds its data.\n\n\nOS's are getting smart about how they choose what and when to to page in/out.  So the operation counts may not be the same, and the swap space may perhaps be in use without there being page outs.\nUnless of course I'm backwards on what a page-in/page-out operation is.  In which case your question makes perfect sense.\n", "Q: How can I group applications? My Applications folder is getting pretty full and I'm starting to lose track of applications. I want to organize them in groups, but I've read that some applications don't properly handle being put inside a folder.\n1) What is the truth to this statement? Is there a list of applications with known problems? Is this a thing of the past? Does FileVault have anything to do with it? (I have FileVault turned on)\n2) What alternatives do I have? How do you group your applications?\nI'm currently considering making some other folder in my home directory (maybe \"Shortcuts\"), with subfolders for groups, and inside of those subfolders making symlinks to applications in the /Applications directory. Then I would drag my Applications folder off my dock and replace it with the Shortcuts folder. Do you see anything wrong with that?\nIs there any mechanism built into Snow Leopard for grouping applications?\n\nA: A little off-topic, but I hardly ever launch Applications from the Finder.\nThey are either in the Dock, or you can get to them with Spotlight (or your favorite alternative app launcher).\n\nA: 1) The pre-installed Apple applications generally won't get updated by Software Update if they are moved. The Developer applications won't work properly if moved. I honestly haven't tried complex installs like Photoshop to see if they can be moved. But most applications that you download from a website as a zip or dmg can be installed where ever you like -- I tend to create an \"Applications\" folder in my home folder for those applications\n2) I think your suggestion is the recommended one. Note that the typical way to create what Mac OS X calls an \"alias\" (kind of like a windows shortcut, more like a unix soft link) is to \noption+command drag the icon to the destination. You could also have sub-folders in your shortcut folder -- \"Games,\" \"Productivity,\" \"Communications.\"\nOnce the Mac OS X App Store gets started, I think there will be more options for organizing app store apps.\n\nA: Very few 3rd party apps need to be in /Applications. You can usually tell as they don't look very Mac-ish, or are low-level requiring an installer and a reboot. I haven't seen any drag-and-drop apps that need to be there.\nI put everything I install in ~/local/Applications, and I have had zero problems.\nIf you want further classification/categorization, I think your suggestion of Aliases is the way to go. The advantage here is you can have the app appear in multiple places, for example, VLC could be filed under both an \"Audio\" and a \"Video\" folder.\n\nA: If you take your recommended route (basically making aliases to the apps and grouping them by folder), you could then add these folders to your dock, and basically have a folder for each group. Then clicking on one (say you have a group for network stuff like browsers and FTP clients), click on that - which would thing bring up the list for you to click the icon.\n\nA: My answer is as simple as the keystrokes I just used to look something up. (Note: Requires an application launcher such as the built-in Spotlight, or the free Alfred.app)\nCmd + Space, terenter ↩\nMy terminal is now open and I can proceed to run the commands I wanted to.\nTwo other favorites are goo / chr for my browser. But that's pretty much always open anyways. And if it isn't, I rarely invoke it directly, more often just by clicking a link.\n(Note: for Alfred, the default keystroke is Ctrl+Space instead of Cmd+Space)\n\nA: I use something called \"Overflow\" (15$) that expands the capacity of the dock.\n\nA: Folders for Applications is coming with Mac OS X Lion. Folders won't be viewed in the Finder, but via Launchpad you can have apps in folders. \n", "Q: Output 4:3 video on old Apple TV? I have an old Apple TV that I have hooked up to my 4:3 TV, and I would like to have the output from the Apple TV match the ratio of my TV so there isn't any stretching or squishing. It's running the latest firmware 3.0.2.\n\nA: I don't believe it will be 4:3. One of the requirements for ATV was a widescreen TV. I think it always assumes a 16:9 ratio. As @matthewpavkov suggested, best bet would be to get the tele to force the input into 4:3, but it's very model dependant if the tele actually supports that.\nUpdate: I stand corrected, there seems to be a thread related to this exact issue on the MacRumors fourms http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=658621 However, it seems that it stopped working on the 3.x firmware, so there's an even more hacky way of achieving it here.

However in india we don't have VOIP support, but my phone \"HTC TOUCH\" supports Remote Sim. I am looking for an app which can allow my ipod to control my phone and also enable me to make calls thru my ipod by dialing on my phone. is it possible?\n\nA: Not possibly currently I'm afraid. Certainly, you'd have to have a jailbroken Touch as a starting point. No way you'd be able to do this on a stock iPod Touch. Even then, I'm not aware of anything out there that will do this.\n", "Q: Can I develop iPhone apps in Windows? I would like to develop iPhone apps without using Mac OS X.\nIs it possible to do this on Windows OS?\n\nA: While you can't develop iOS apps on Windows using full-on Xcode, Objective C, and Cocoa Touch, there are some Windows alternatives that will allow you to develop apps. You lose the flexibility and power of the full programming environment and language, but it's no longer impossible.\nHere's an article that lists a number of current options. It's not the route I'd go (nor the route I chose), but it's no longer impossible.\n\nA: Not supported and borderline with piracy but if you dig on Internet you can find how to create a virtual machine with VMware that run OS X. I do not post the link here but using Google is quite easy to find a really well made tutorial about how to proceed with detailed instructions.\nI did it before purchasing a MacBook Pro to test how a Web Application I have work on a Mac and so I also used it to install Xcode, if you have a powerful Windows machine the performance are not so bad, but it's useful just for testing and seeing how the different iPhone developer tools works, if you want to develop something business related your only real option is to purchase a Mac.\nRegards\nMassimo\n\nA: No it is not possible for full development and submission unless you want to run OS X in a VM on your PC.\nYou can develop, to an extent, on other platforms, but as far as I know you need a Mac to submit.\n\nA: Nope, you have to use a Mac. All the tools are on the Mac, as is the simulator program you'll need to test in.\nEven if you could somehow finagle the whole thing running in Windows you still need a Mac to submit to Apple to get it on the App Store.\nCheapest scenario you're looking $699 for a Mac Mini and $99 for the iOS Developer Program (which you won't need until you want to run the thing on a real phone). You can go cheaper on the hardware if you buy it used but something to keep in mind is that it must be an Intel-based Mac running Leopard (10.5) or higher.\n\nA: Depending on what you want to do, you can develop web apps that look pretty much the same as an actual application, start from the home screen and even hide the navigation and URL bars. Take a look at Glyphboard, for an example.\nNative apps require Mac OS X, as far as I know.\n\nA: Yes, you can. Check out this website called macincloud.com. Most people are trying to install Mac OS to PC hardware, sometimes it works, the drawback for that is newer mac updates often break the installation. macincloud.com actually allows you to rent a mac and access the Mac remotely. Therefore you always have the latest Mac OS and it is a good way to start developing iphone apps right away since you are actually using a native Mac system. Hope that helps.\n", "Q: Running .NET binary with mono When I have abc.exe generated from C#/Mono source, I use 'mono abc.exe'.\nIs there a way to run abc.exe with 'abc.exe' not 'mono abc.exe'? I mean, when I run 'abc.exe', can I make 'mono abc.exe' called automatically?\n\nA: See this link\nBasically what you have to do is to use one of the Mono tools (mkbundle is a generic one while macpack is designed to work on Mac OS X) to link all your application executables, resources and dll in a single executable file that can be later run as a single app.\nFrom the macpack doc:\nmacpack is a tool that must be used to bundle Cocoa# applications into Double-Clickable, Finder friendly, bundles on Mac OS X. It bundles static libraries and resources, as well as generates a basic info.plist into the .app bundle.\nFor example the following commands are used to build the CurrencyConverter.exe into an application bundle:\n$ mcs -g -debug+ CurrencyConverter.cs -out:CurrencyConverter.exe -pkg:cocoa-sharp\n$ rm -rf CurrencyConverter.app\n$ macpack -m:2 -o:.  -r:/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/    \n  libCocoaSharpGlue.dylib -r:CurrencyConverter.nib -n:CurrencyConverter \n  -a:CurrencyConverter.exe\n\nThe resulting CurrencyConverter.app is just another Mac OS X application as far as the Finder is concerned, and can be opened from Finder, or launched from Terminal using the open -a CurrencyConverter command.\n\nA: Improving Calavera’s answer to allow you to do it with a parameter, the script should look like:\n#!/bin/bash\nmono $1\n\nThat way you can do:\n./abc.sh name_of_the_app.exe\n\nI would have added this as a comment, but the format would have been lost\n\nA: I don't have a lot of experience with mono but you'll probably have to create an executable shell script that does the mono call for you.  Something like:\n$ vi abc.sh\n\n#!/bin/bash\n#abc.sh\nmono abc.exe\n:wq\n\n$ chmod +x abc.sh\n$ ./abc.sh\n\n", "Q: Why automatically adjust brightness doesn't work after I change the brightness Why automatically adjust brightness doesn't work after I change the brightness manually using the hot keys although it's set to do so in the displays configuration?\n\nA: I have noticed a few times that if I turn the brightness up very high, the auto adjust is not nearly as noticeable as it is on lower settings. \n\nA: Theoretically it should, but it is all relative. The ambient light sensor turns the display brighter when its bright outside and dim when it's dark inside. The thing is, the Mac is designed to cater to the user, because supposedly a human being knows what it wants better than a little $.005 photo sensor, so the buttons on the keyboard (F1 and F2) override the ambient light settings for a set period of time, and then still until the light conditions change drastically enough to cause the auto-adjust to kick in again. Going from dark screen to bright screen is almost immediate, but the Mac will take a while to go from bright screen to dark screen except on opening the clamshell or waking from sleep. This kind of makes sense when you think about the real world situations where this would happen.\nSo try this with auto-adjust ON and make sure \"dim screen after inactivity\" in Energy Saver prefs is off: \n\n\n*\n\n*In a really dark room (no light except from computer), open the computer and manually raise the brightness to maximum, screen and keyboard backlight too if equipped.\n\n*Hold a small headed, bright flashlight (Mini Maglight or smaller) to the ALS, which is located to the left of the iSight camera on glass-paneled macs or in the speaker grille on older macs.\n\n*If the keyboard backlight goes off then the ALS IS WORKING\n\n*Lower DISPLAY backlight only to 1 above minimum level (minimum turns backlight completely off)\n\n*Put flashlight over ALS\n\n*You should see IMMEDIATE increase in backlight to full level.\n\n*Remove flashlight, display should readjust immediately to ambient level. Notice how after auto-adjusting the manual override is overridden so you can repeat steps 5 and 7 over and over again for entertainment ;)\n\n\nIf the steps above produce no results, restart computer and repeat tests. If still no results take to Apple certified repair center or Apple Store for repair which will likely be covered under warranty.\n\nA: From my experience, if you put your head between the camera and the light the sensor will trigger the auto adjust no matter what.\n\nA: After manually changing the brightness you need a way to trigger the light sensor. Just place your hand on the camera area, which will make the brightness dimmer and once you remove your hand, the screen brightness will automatically adjust itself.\n", "Q: How is a large, spread out company supposed to work with the iOS Developer Program? I work for a company which has several offices in various parts of the country (USA).\nThe division I'm part of wants to get an Apple iOS Developer Program license.\nAnother division (in another office/state) already has a license.\nWhen we go to that division they said it would be better/easier to just apply for our own license, which made sense.\nWhen we apply to get the license we have to use our legal company name.\nApple shot us down - because the other division already has the license under the legal company name. Which also makes sense.\nApple is being Apple in that it's basically impossible to get someone on the phone to discuss what we're supposed to do here. So my guess is that what we're going to have to do is piggy-back off of the license the other division is using.\nBesides sounding like a big huge hassle (coordinating with coworkers in another office/state whom you've never met) I'm not really sure what the logistics are. Are we supposed to be able to use this one license on every Mac we own across the company? (which luckily there's not that many of) Or is there a seat limit? The end goal is the App Store, but should we have gotten an Enterprise license? If so, is there any way to \"upgrade\" to that if the other division just got the standard one? Is someone from the other division supposed to be the \"admin\" of the license? Or can we all be added as users to their license?\nFor a large, spread out company with divisions in many different offices and states, how are you supposed to work with the iOS Developer Program?\n(I asked this on SO as well, and someone recommended I ask it here, too. Let me know if this is unacceptable)\n\nA: A $99 \"company\" developer membership allows the administrator of the account to set up many \"developer\" accounts. You should get the administrator of that account (whoever set it up originally, most likely) to create accounts for each of your developers.\nYou might need to share the admin account for things like provisioning and app submission, but for most of your daily work, you can have your own login that shares the developer membership.\n\nA: Since Apple has spoken that each \"company\" only gets one developer program, you will be forced to share or create a new company.\nThe initial burden of forming a wholly owned subsidiary for the purpose of establishing a legal entity is something that independent developers do for less than $500 and they get professional, but canned help.\nYou'll have to run this by your finance and legal teams to know how painful this will be for your company's particular situation. It's fairly simple for an individual to have an LLC or S corp fall under personal income tax and handling the filing paperwork with the state government is more of a light administrative burden. It could easily be more costly and complicated for a real corporation to set up a child company - but that's the direct route to getting your own developer account.\n", "Q: How can I remove pending downloads in iTunes? I have an update for the Dexter game on iPhone which is 400MB in size.

If so then you can click on it, click on the stalled download, and delete it.\nEdited to add\nThere are a couple of places you might check after quitting iTunes. The first is \n/Users/yourUserName/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications/Downloads/\n\nMake sure it's empty, and if not, remove what's in there (set it aside so you can put it back if it confuses iTunes later).\nThe other place is:\n/Users/yourUserName/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications/\n\nand look for the file Dexter.ipa (or DexteGame.ipa or whatever the game is called). Delete this file -- it's the actual now-outdated game that iTunes is trying to update.\nOtherwise iTunes has the need to download it stored in its database and doesn't care about files. \nI take it that agreeing to the download doesn't help?\n\nA: Go to the file,\nSlide slowly to the left on the download icon until you see a Delete button in a red box.\nTry it few times if it doesn't work.\n\nA: I had the same issue w/ two apps that I did not want to download.

I'd prefer to do this purely from the \n command-line, but if I have to open up a graphical program, I will. \n\nA: You might be interested in reading Apple's documentation on Speakable Items, but the relevant part to your question, \"How can I get OS X to listen for the string \"s\" and run the program \"cmd\" in response?\" is:\n\nYou can add an item to the Speakable\n  Items folder to make it speakable.    \nTo open something using a spoken\n  command, just add it to the Speakable\n  Items folder. You can use a command to\n  open anything you can open by\n  double-clicking, including\n  applications, files, and Web sites.\n  You can also write scripts and add\n  them to the folder.\n\nIn regards to \"How does OS X know what command to run? I see nothing in that file that says what command to run?\", the relevant portion of the file you posted is:\n    <key>BuiltInCommandID</key> \n    <integer>105</integer> \n    <key>DefaultCommandName</key> \n    <string>Tell me a joke</string> \n\nThis is saying, when the spoken command \"Tell me a joke\" is received, run the internal command ID#105, which is the \"Tell me a joke\" command.\nIn this case you're looking at an internal command to the speech system. But you can add AppleScripts or shell commands to the speakable items folder as well.\nThis article on Mac OS X Hints may be helpful as well.\nEDIT: After some research I am not sure if you can run shell scripts directly from there, but a little AppleScript wrapper would be easy enough to write, and you could even write it so it can be duplicated and renamed, and it would just run the corresponding shell script from /scripts or something.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade my 2008 Mac Pro completely? Hey everyone, I have a 2008 Mac Pro/2.83hzXEON(8)/8800GT512mb.\nIs it possible for me to upgrade this machine to newer hardware, since it is Intel based? What would it entail to put a newer processor, ram and video card in this machine? Is it worth it?\nThanks\n\nA: I purchased a 2008 Mac Pro (3,1) with single quad core processor (Intel Xeon E5462 @ 2.80 GHz\n1 processor, 4 cores), and 4GB of RAM running at 667 MHz.  It produced the following GeekBench 3 results:\nSingle Core: 1559,  Multi Core: 3927\nI performed the following upgrades in stages and re-ran GeekBench 3 to get a base-line of what each upgrade offered in incremental performance.\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgraded RAM to 8GB to populate slots 1 & 2 on both memory cards.  Result was a single core score of: 1647, and a multi core score of: 5743  (pretty substantial increase in memory read/write speeds).\n\n*Next, I upgraded the CPU to 2 Intel Xeon E5472 @ 3.00 GHz (2 processors, 8 cores) which resulted in a single core score of: 1740 and a multi-core score of: 11638\n\n*Next, I upgraded the memory to 800MHz and 16GB, again populating the first two memory slots on both cards with the same memory resulting in the following pick up:  Single Core score: 1778, and Multi-Core score: 12441.\nThat is it for the Geek Bench measurable results.  Above should give you a pretty good guide on the increases you can achieve in your system just by changing the RAM config, or upgrading your CPUs.\nFor two other upgrades I would have to turn to Nova Bench to show the details.\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgraded video card from NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT GPU to the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 285. The 8800 was scoring at 405 fps, and scored a 139 on Nova Bench, whereas the GTX 285 scored 627 fps and a score of 191.  The GTX 285 doesn't have EFI support and therefore doesn't show the Apple logo during startup, but the cost/value savings of not showing that is good enough for me to forgo watching the Apple logo during startup.  The card is a 1GB DDR congif and just works (I had to add an extra power connector to power it, but the Mac Pro logic board has two and supports this card's power requirements stock).\n\n\nProbably the most significant increase that I noticed was the addition of an SSD;  unfortunately this isn't going to GeekBench or NovaBench a score that adequately demonstrates the perceived speed increase that I see.  I believe this is likely the most significant improvement one can make to any older system to see immediate and meaningful improvements.  I added a 500GB SSD, and turned it into a Fusion Drive using instructions I found using Google.  The load time for the OS went from 50 seconds to 21 seconds, and launching of some applications is instantaneous vs. 5 to 10 seconds.  Everything appears to be a bit faster.  This is so much the case, I purchased a bunch of 128GB SSDs for about $70 and moved ever computer in the house to use them for the startup partition and virtual memory manager utilizing a secondary hard disk for larger applications and data.\nHere are the specs reported by NovaBench for reference:\nDrive Write Speed (read speeds are going to be significantly higher on the SSD): \nStock Hard Drive: 44 MB/s\n7200 RPM Hard Drive: 75 MB/s\nFusion Drive: 180 MB/s  (the SSD by itself was the same as MacOS manages the SSD to always have free space available which should result in SSD drive speeds for writing data;  data reads will toggle between SSD and hard drive speeds depending on whether the data is on the SSD or hard disk when being read).\nThat is it on my upgrade.  I used the guides on FixIt for the take apart on the Mac Pro CPU upgrades, and everything else I already knew how to do.\nTotal cost for my new computer is about $900 and includes the cost of two 24 inch displays + my time to do the work.  \n\nA: I concur with your observations. I was ready to toss this 2008 dual 2.8 Quad Core machine as it seemed deathly slow compared to my PC. As a last ditch effort to save it I upgraded to Yosemite, threw in 12 GB of 800MHz DDR2 Ram, a 500 GB Samsung SSD boot disk, and an nVidia GeForce GTX770 which I bought on eBay. The machine once again rocks. I couldn't be happier with it. It is like a new machine and responds as well as my fast PC.\nDon't listen to all the bad reviews about Yosemite: it seems to have a very good handle on optimization for older machines. The total cost for my upgrades was about $800 and was a steal compared to the cost of a new Mac Pro.  \n\nA: Certain upgrades are possible, but it’s not that simple.\n\n\n*\n\n*Accelerate your Mac is a nice source of information, you can find them here.\n\n*ANandtech did change the CPU of a Mac Pro.\n\n*OWC Mac Sales does have memory upgrades (there are others).\n\n*Video card: Unless you want to experiment with modified firmwares, your only choice in that model is the ATI 4870, which is considerably faster than the regular NVidia (it’s very noticeable in x-plane and 3d applications) but still lagging behind the “latest offerings”. \nAccording to Wikipedia: \"The Mac Pro, as with other Macintosh platforms, requires Mac OS X firmware. That is to say, a PCIe video card designed exclusively for other operating systems will not work properly under Mac OS X without appropriate drivers and/or firmware”\nSadly, no other video card has that, other than the Apple’s offerings. But If you google around there are some posts about people who managed to make other cards work. \n\n\n*\n\n*Forget about upgrading your Motherboard, as it’s a custom design. \n\n*Hard drives/SuperDrives are generic and can be replaced, as you may have already guessed.\n\n*Any other component is probably “custom” designed for a Mac Pro (the power supply for example) and you won’t be able to get away with it…\nIs it worth?\nI have an early 2008 Mac Pro with 2x4 Intel XEON 2.8 and 10GB RAM. I’ve upgraded the RAM (from the lame 2GB to 10 @ OWC liked above), and I ordered the machine with the NVIDIA card (8800? I don’t remember), which was the only option other than the stock ATI2600 or something lame like that. \nA couple of years later, the NVIDIA died (the Apple guy told me it had bugs and used to fail), so I got the new ATI 4780 512MB (it was 100€ less expensive than the out of warranty NVIDIA apple replacement). The difference was really noticeable in 3d apps. \nI haven’t thought about upgrading the CPUs because getting faster XEONs (I wouldn’t be able to upgrade to Nehalem or anything new) won’t really make a big difference for me.\nI use a SSD and 4 Hard Drives in the bays, if that counts as an upgrade (my original drive was 750gb, up from the stock 500). \nI brought it with the Bluetooth/Wifi module (it was optional back then) and tho I haven’t used it a lot, it came in handy in a few occasions. \nOS X Doesn’t support SLI/Crossfire for using more than 1 video card in parallel (you can install more than one, but it’s not the same thing), so forget about getting two super video cards for running crysis y super-top-ultra-maximum quality. \nConclusion\nYes, if you upgrade the RAM to something other than the 2GB and yes to the video card if you do 3d intensive stuff. Exposé will work fine on the NVIDIA8800 you have, but X-Plane (among other 3D things) will be noticeably faster with a new video card. \n\nA: My 2008 Mac pro 2.8 8 core 16g ram has been upgraded with PCI-e bus ssd's (2x500gb) and a 2 gb gtx 680 video card. 4 bays have 1tb or 2tb sata drives. driving 3 23 inch apple monitors.\nWith El capitan its stable and fast. maxing out black magic disk speed tests across the board.\n", "Q: Transferring contact list from Iphone 4 to a Windows 7 PC and vice versa I would like to transfer the contact list from my iPhone 4 to my Windows 7 PC.  How can I do that?  Which software should I need?\nAfter I transfer all my contacts to the PC, I want it to copy back to another iPhone 4. \n\nA: You can do it with iTunes! You can sync iPhone contacts with Windows address book, Yahoo! contacts, Google contacts or Outlook contacts... And after that you could sync it with another iPhone...\nAlso, you can use Apple's mobileMe service (which is NOT free). They have a sync tool for Windows (me.com)...\n", "Q: Can Disk Utility format an SD card with FAT32? In the pulldown for \"Format\", there are only the following options (other than various Mac OS Extended variations): MS-DOS (FAT) and ExFAT. \n\nA: Selecting \"MS-DOS (FAT)\" will automatically format as FAT16 or FAT32 depending on the target's size.\n", "Q: Can I get the Media browsers from the File Open dialog in the Finder sidebar? The File Open dialog has three very useful Media entries in the sidebar (Photos, Movies, Music). They are backed by the various iLife applications, so that you can select, for example, from your iPhoto albums. \nThe Finder windows have a \"Search For\" section in the sidebar, but the \"All Images\" entry there is just a smart folder that contains all image files from your whole hard disk with no further categorization. \nCan I get the Media libraries to show up in the Finder as well?\n\nA: A software alternative that provides a media browser from anywhere:\nhttp://www.karelia.com/imedia/\n", "Q: How Many Hours of Game Playing can Iphone 4 Support? iPhone 4 supports:\n\n\n*\n\n*up to 6 hours of 3G\n\n*up to 10 hours of wifi\n\n\nBut how many hours of game play can iphone 4 support?\nI've been playing Angry Birds recently and it seems to me that the iPhone can only support 5 hours of Angry Birds. Is this normal?\n\nA: Playing games on your iPhone uses a lot more processing power than 3G or wifi.  The higher the cpu usage, the faster the battery drains.  I'm actually surprised you get as much battery life as you do, that seems pretty good to me.\n\nA: Using a high resolution game that requires a lot of computing power (like R Racing or Infinity Blade) in 3 or 4 hours the battery should be completely drained, 5 hours it's a lot...\n", "Q: MacBook Air (1st gen) running really slow, basic apps crash and no internet MacBook Air was working fine yesterday.

My thoughts are corrupt OS or RAM. I can't reinstall the OS with being recognised by another Mac and I can't test the hardware for the same reason. Am I missing something?\nRich\n\nA: Have you run the Apple Hardware Test that came with the MacBook Air?\n\nTo use Apple Hardware Test on your\n  MacBook Air:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Disconnect all external devices from your computer except the power\n  adapter.\n  \n*Restart your MacBook Air while holding down the \"D\" key.\n  \n*When the Apple Hardware Test chooser screen appears, select the\n  language for your location.\n  \n*Press the Return key or click the right arrow button.\n  \n*When the Apple Hardware Test main screen appears (after about 45\n  seconds), follow the onscreen\n  instructions.\n  \n*If Apple Hardware Test detects an issue, it displays an error code. Make\n  a note of the error code before\n  pursuing support options. If Apple\n  Hardware Test doesn't detect a\n  hardware issue, the issue may be\n  software related.\n\nIf AHT found no issues, run a memory test. Download memtest86+ and burn that to a CD, and boot the MacBook Air from the CD. I have personally had RAM issues which AHT didn't find but memtest did.\nEDIT: Sorry, I only just not noticed that you said you're unable to run AHT, presumably because you don't have an external optical drive. I'd recommend taking the MacBook Air in to an Apple store. Or by using a USB Ethernet Adapter you could probably get it to boot AHT from the network.\nEDIT2: Have you tried booting from a USB drive? You could use another Mac to install a fresh copy of OS X to a US disk and see if the Air can boot that. or, you might be able to copy the Mac OS X Install DVD to a USB disk and try to run AHT off there...\nUltimately, a visit to the Apple Store is probably your best bet :-(\n\nA: Turned out to be a HDD fault.

When I switch to the Guest login, though, Skype launches but does not connect after 90 seconds.  Does it eventually connect if I give it more time, or is there some architectural obstacle that prevents using it as Guest?\n\nA: You say that you 'switch' to the Guest login. Are you using fast user switching and leaving Skype running on your other account? It may not be a problem with the Guest account, but with trying to run multiple instances of Skype on the same machine.\n", "Q: AppleId, language always changes On https://appleid.apple.com/ I changed the preferred language to French at least 10 times now, but it always comes back to German. Not immediately thus I see I can save the French language preference, but then I receive the next mail in German, I check my account and language is set to German. I live in Switzerland and thus our languages are French German and Italian...\n\nA: I have experienced inconsistencies at times in the language used in communication received from Apple. I am not sure there is a clear answer. While a single Apple Id may be used to authenticate separate systems (e.g. Developer, iTunes, MobileMe) may handle languages differently.\nFrom my experience, the following appear to affect the language used in communication from Apple.\n\n\n*\n\n*The language of the device that\ninitiated an interaction using an\nApple Id\n\n*The language of the\ncountry for which you are registered \n\n*The language in the preferred\nlanguage setting\n\n\nFor example, when purchasing from iTunes on my iPhone (Spanish), I received a receipt in Spanish. But when ordering from my Mac (English) I received a receipt in English.\nTo isolate the problem it may be worth reviewing which systems you use with Apple and in which languages to see what may be causing the change. If you are near an Apple Store, with this information, they may be able to help you sort our what is causing the change. Or perhaps report it as a bug in there system. \n\nA: From the Apple support forum:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/26685508#26685508\nGo to appleid.apple.com, click \"Manage your Apple ID\" and log on.\nOn the left, select \"Language and Contact preferences\" (or whatever it is in German, it is the last choice), and try to select the language to what you prefer.\nIf it already displays your preferred language, change it to something else, then change it back.\n", "Q: RSS feed for new AppleTv titles? Is there perhaps an RSS feed or some other method of being notified of new AppleTv titles as they become available?\n\nA: There should be, but almost all I found were people complaining that there wasn't one.\nGiven that, one or more of these might help:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple TV Junkie has a feed of at least some new movies.\n\n*Apple has an iTunes RSS Generator\nWhile it doesn't do new movies, it will give you top movies and top movie rentals.\n\n*If you felt like getting into the code, here's the  iTunes search API.\n\n*This URL launches iTunes and goes directly to the \"New Movies to Rent or Own\" section of the iTunes store.\n\n", "Q: Preview problem on \"iPhoto imported\" clips in iMovie I've a strange problem with iMovie : I can preview movie clips that I've directly imported into iMovie, but the ones that have been imported from my camera by iPhoto have a problem : the displayed preview when I do a \"mouse-over\" is showing another movie clip (always the same, for every movie clip)\nIs there a way to ask iPhoto or iMovie to \"rebuild\" this previews ?\nEDIT : Is there a way to rebuild the cache of iPhoto ?\n\nA: Hold cmd+opt while launching iPhoto.  Good luck! :-)\n", "Q: How can I keep bugs out of the MacBook Pro's hinge vent? I've noticed that some flying bugs have an irritating habit of crawling into the hinge vent on my MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2009).\nI don't know what possesses them to go in there, maybe it looks like an inviting hidey-hole, but they obviously end up dying from the heat. I'm paranoid they'll eventually clog something. Bless the designer for the nice design, but it's next to impossible to fish dead bugs out of there! Ironically, because of the silent design there's also no huge gust of hot air to persuade them not to try climbing in there.\nThe problem is made worse when there's a light above the table drawing them in, but even without it the screen is a bright enough draw. I've seen them crash into the screen (or fall from an above light), and then make a mad dash straight into the vent. It's infuriating!\nHas anyone else experienced this problem with bugs and that hinge vent? How did you de-bug yours? My only workaround so far has been to surround myself with tons of other lights on to keep them as scattered as possible...\nEdit: Looking back at this question I'm disappointed that I forgot to include any regional info. At the time I was in a house in the country in Queensland, Australia. Bugs inside the house are the norm rather than the exception. I may have to wait until Summer again (in December) before I can actually test to see if this was a seasonal thing for the bugs, as I haven't been bothered by them again since then.\n\nA: Hmmm....I have a pc and it's bug free.\n\n[non-troll answer]\nOk, ok....you might try flushing the vent openings with canned air while the computer is off.  Turn the can upside down so that you can actually get that super cold dangerous liquid in there.  Maybe there's some kind of scent that's drawing them in (is it the same species?).\n", "Q: Automatically marking junk mail as read Is there any way to automatically mark junk mail as 'read' in OS X (10.6.5) Mail? A free or shareware utility would be nice.\nMy mail provider supports junk filters that automatically moves selected messages to the junk folder, but does not mark them as read. OS X Mail picks them up (IMAP) and displays the headers in the Junk folder as unread.\nI would like to continue to use my mail provider's filters instead of just the 'Rules' in OS X Mail because otherwise I show tons of messages in my iPhone inbox, since it does not support filtering.\n\nA: Go To Mail -> Preferences -> Junk\nWhen junk mail arrives, say:\nPerform Custom actions\nClick on the Advanced button at the bottom, which just turned up to be active.\n\nThen say \"Mark as read\" in one of your actions:\n\n\nA: The link in the accepted answer is dead. I've been able to solve this using the following AppleScript:\nusing terms from application \"Mail\"\n    on perform mail action with messages theMessages\n        tell application \"Mail\"\n            set read status of messages of mailbox \"Bulk Mail\" of account \"Yahoo!\" to true\n        end tell\n    end perform mail action with messages\nend using terms from\n\nUsing Script Editor, edit the above with the name of your Junk mailbox and account. Save it as \"Mark_Junk_Read.scpt\" in ~/Library/Application Scripts/com.apple.mail. Then, in Mail, go to \"Preferences\", \"Rules\", \"Add Rule\". Make the rule apply to \"Every Message\" and tell it to run your script, like so:\n\n\nA: You could add a Mail.app Rule that mark every new mail in the \"Junk\" folder as read.\n\nA: You could create an AppleScript that does this.\nI haven't looked into it much, but this link appears to have a promising solution.\nhttp://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=8350917\n\nA: I don't really trust SPAM headers. I've seen messages from mail-lists I subscribed to be labeled as SPAM and end up in that folder where I don't see it for ages. \nAs a result I bought a copy of SpamSieve which, after training, does a much better job filtering out the garbage.\n", "Q: Optimal method to test an external hard drive? I've got an HFS+ formatted external drive that is starting to act a bit funny, mainly causing my mac mini (finder) to freeze up on occassion when accessing it.\nFearing imminent failure, what is the most comprehensive way to determine the health of the physical drive and the file system?\nVerify in Disk Utility indicates the disk is fine, but weird behaviour would indicate otherwise.\n\nA: Apple's Disk Utility doesn't have false positives but it can miss some errors. \nAlthough it's not cheap Disk Warrior is magic for these sort of problems, in my experience it's fixed all non-physical-damage errors that I could throw at it. \nIf you're not keen to spend money, and if you've got the hard disk space, copying the contents off, repartitioning your external drive and copying back on on might clear up your problems. Copying the whole disk's contents (starting with what is most valuable to you, in case it dies while you're copying) is probably a good idea anyway, in case your disk is on its death bed. \n\nA: Yes, Drive Genius allows to check surface for bad sectors even in demo mode:\n\nThere is also option to perform an \"Extended Scan\" which checks disk for read and write ability of a disk (burn-in test for drives).\nIt also supports block remapping \"Spare bad blocks\" option but you should backup your data before doing this.\nThere is related question where some more utilities may appear in answers.\nIt's hard not to mention MHDD which gives much more information about what's going on with you disc while it scans it (instead of showing nice visualisation):\n\nHere is video from Youtube.\n", "Q: How can I bulk-edit Address Book, in particular to split the contents of First Name into First Name, Last Name? Following a MobileMe import of a Windows XP AddressBook legacy, there are hundreds of entries in the Mac Address Book like this:\nFirst: Harry Potter\nLast:\nFirst: Fred Flintstone\nLast:\n\nIt appears that what happened is that both the First and Last names in the Windows XP Address Book migrated to the Firstname field in Mac Address Book.\nIs there a way to bulk-edit these?  Going through the GUI means click on first name, highlight tail, cut, click on last, paste, next.  It would be nice to do that in a text editor or with a wee perl script.\nCan the Address Book be exported as structured text and subsequently replaced by modified structured text?\n\nA: If you are comfortable with AppleScript, you should be able to get it done using this web page as a starting point: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20070813135408868\nOtherwise, you can export one or more cards in the vCard format, open that up in a file editor and it looks like a properly separated name field looks like this: \"N:Smith;Joe;;;\" so if yours look like \"N:Joe Smith;;;;\" and you are comfortable with regular expressions you should be able to work out a search and replace that would look for 'N:(word1) (word2);' and replace it with 'N:(word2);(word1)'. I think that would give you the right number of ';'.\n\nA: You can export from inside AddressBook to vCard format which is ASCII, or use the contacts program to dump your AddressBook to plain text. Find the problematic entries, reformat them using your favorite scripting/programming language, or use Google Refine if you are not a programmer, create a new CSV file, and then re-import. Check it works, then delete the originals.\n", "Q: How should I set up my coding environment for PHP, mySQL, and JavaScript development? I'm having trouble finding a coding environment that is comfortable and I'm hoping anyone has had the same problem. On my windows box at the office I've found my ideal coding environment that I really dig. VS2010 or Eclipse, Notepad++, WinScp, Fireftp is often everything I need. \nOn my macbook pro however, I've not yet found that environment that just says \"click\". \nWhat I'm looking for is a solution that can handle \"intellisense\" with php, ssh browsing like WinScp and snapping windows over halv the screen like Windows 7.\nI've found one solution for the last point, but it had a lot of bugs so it got disabled. For some reason I find Eclipse to be a bit slow on my mac, and I haven't found a nice way of integrating a browser for the remote server via ssh either. \nI'm making this community wiki since I'm really looking forward to seeing how everyone sets their environment up. I'm sure there are some gems to be found.\nOn my mac I mainly do PHP, mySQL, javaScript development. \n\nA: I have about 7 years of experience coding in a Windows environment before I got my first mac early this year.  So I know exactly what you're talking about.  I was very used to the combination of Visual Studio for c++ and .net, Notepad++ for .bat and other scripting and lightweight tasks, and the occasional bit of Eclipse for java.\nWhen I first started using my Mac, I was frustrated by what I saw to be a lack of equivalent software for OS X.  I tried different IDEs and text editing solutions (Eclipse, Aptana, Textmate, Smultron, Fraise, etc), but like you said, nothing really 'clicked'.\nHowever, at some point I stopped looking for replacements and started using the tools that were commonly used on *nix machines.  Particularly vim.  I've found that once my expectation of finding software equivalents to everything I had used on Windows dropped away, my horizons broadened.  I feel like my interest in coding has been renewed because I'm learning a completely different way to work and think about the process.  I'm using the command line way more than I ever have in the past, and this has translated into new techniques even in my Windows development (like using powershell and command line versions of tools rather than the gui).\nI was in a huge programming rut before I started using my mac, but I'm finding that being forced to look at my process and tools in a different way is really bringing out talents and interests I didn't know I had before.  I'm coding in python and c++ rather than javascript and c#, in one of the oldest editors in existence, and I'm loving it.\n\nA: I my self use variant of IDE for coding:\nWhen I did PHP I mainly use Zend Studio that was eclipse based.\nBeside that I use Eclipse itself (but I hadn't your problem about it's speed), or use NetBeans (it was really good).\nAnd some times use Vim or MacVim.\n\nA: I've found TextMate with a PHP completion bundle and an ftp+ssh bundle to be pretty solid. You get everything you're asking for except for the window management, and as @mankoff noted, there are lots of choices for that. Not listed by him is HyperDock, which handles both window-snapping and window previews from the dock.\n\nA: Jetbrains PHP Storm\n\nA: If Vim is being given as a solution - I think Aquamacs should also be considered. It is a version of Emacs configured to be more OS X like. (Note the usual vi/Emacs arguments)\nEmacs includes several modes supporting programming. \nEmacs does not have the vi split between inserting text and text manipulation whch might be a point in Aquamacs' favour if that is the reason you use nano.\n\nA: For window arranging:\n\n\n*\n\n*SizeUp http://irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/\n\n*Divvy http://mizage.com/divvy/\n\n*Breeze http://www.autumnapps.com/breeze/\n\n*ShiftIt http://code.google.com/p/shiftit/\n\n*Mercury Mover http://www.heliumfoot.com/mercurymover/details\n\n*Optimal Layout http://most-advantageous.com/optimal-layout/\n\n*Cinch http://irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/\n\nA: I've been using a combination of Eclipse and TextMate. TextMate grew on me quickly, especially since I'd come from the premise of finding a free editor, it was just very neat. I use VI for quick command line edits.\nTextMate has nice SCM integration, snippet based completion, great highlighting and folding. It also has plenty of helper scripts, and a really good system for customizing or adding languages. However, it lacks if you want to browse a codebase - no indexing. It is for that kind fo indexing and heavyweight autocompletion that I switch to Eclipse. TextMate is fast and light, in a similar way to Np++ on windows. Extending textmate can be done with simple scripts - ruby, shell and others.\nEclipse you already know - just download and unzip. Heavy, a little slow, but great for source browsing. \nWith the SSHFS suggestion from mankoff, take a look at macfusion - handy setup for fuse file systems.\n\nA: I'll recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacVim - it's a great editor, extremely powerful, and uses all the same plugins and config files on MacOS as it would on a PC or Linux. This is my main editor at work and I do about 50% of my coding at home with it.\n\n*TextMate - MacOS only though there are some clones for Windows now. Very flexible and powerful too, but not the fastest or most powerful when doing search/replace. It is very easy to set up snippets and tab-completion. I recommend watching the videos to see what it can do. It's commercial and hasn't seen any enhancements for a while but it's solid. When I'm experimenting or answering questions for Ruby code on StackOverflow I'm using TextMate.\n\n*Komodo Edit - Pretty useful. I don't use it as much as the other two but some people swear by it or it's big brother Komodo.\n\n*BBEdit - BB and I go way back, to before it was released as a commercial product. It is very fast when searching/replacing in multiple files - amazingly fast. The developers know the Mac really well and, in my opinion, have a lot more powerful editor than TextMate or Komodo Edit. When I have to munge or search a bunch of files it's my first choice. BBEdit's smaller sibling is TextWrangler, which is free and quite fast and nicely featured also.\n\n*Coda - a great web development editor, and my first choice when I'm going to be doing a lot of HTML because of its web-page preview integration and CSS editing.\n\n\nAlso, if you do a lot of CSS then check out CSSEdit. That's all it does, but it does it really well.\n\nA: For SSH browsing, you could use sshfs to mount the drive locally, and then use the Finder, or whatever local browser you want.\n\nA: Personally, I use a combination of NetBeans PHP Edition and Coda for my PHP / JavaScript development. I use NetBeans when I'm working on a full project locally, and when I commit to subversion that uploads to our testing server. I use Coda for editing files via SFTP as well as for quick PHP or JavaScript edits. I also use Transmit on occasion when I need to browse an SFTP / FTP site.\n", "Q: How can I hide my top menu bar on Mac OS X? I need to temporarily (5 min) hide my top menu bar. Is there a glitch, or something that will let me do that?\n\nA: You have a few choices.\n\n\n*\n\n*MenuFela, site down, claims to do this.\n\n*MegaZoomer claims to zoom an app and hide the menu bar. Not sure if this will work, for example, with the Finder.\n\n*MenuShade does a so-so job. Hidden menu, but the shadow is there and the space is not usable\n\n*According to this hint you can edit the plist of the app and have the menu bar become hidden.

Is there someway to get the Trash icon back, so I can delete messages with one keystroke instead of two?  I use Gmail IMAP.\n\nA: It sounds like you might have the Archive button switched on. The latest update assumes you would prefer to archive than to trash.\nIf this is the case, Go to Settings > Mail, Calendar, etc.. > Gmail Mail Account > deactivate Archive button.\n", "Q: AirPlay button in multitasking bar? I don't have an Apple TV, so I've never had an AirPlay button anywhere. However I noticed while switching apps in a call that the AirPlay button appears while making a call. Pressing it does nothing. Also when the call in on speaker the AirPlay button goes blue (and still does nothing on pressing it) Why has it suddenly appeared, whats it's use during a call?\nAlso I then discovered a program for Mac which allows you to AirPlay to a Mac, increasing the AirPlay functionality vastly. And tryed pressing the button when I had that working, it still did nothing. (though the Mac program works as I can send youtube videos and photos to it)  And in the photos app, opening the multitasking bar and pressing the AirPlay button does nothing. So what is it there for anyway?\n\nA: It's not just for AirPlay.  It's general-purpose media redirection. You can use it to switch between the built-in earpiece, the speaker on the bottom, Bluetooth earpiece, etc when on a phone call.  For example, I placed a call then went over to the audio controls in the multitasking bar.\nIt just so happens that the primary use is for AirPlay and media playback.\n", "Q: Configure mail client for Adobe Acrobat plugin 9.4.0 Adobe Acrobat plugin 9.4.0 has File | Attach to Email ..., but selecting it yields the following:\n\nThe SendMail doesn't know how to talk\n  to your default mail client.  Please\n  select a different mail application to\n  use.\n\nHow does the user select which mail application for SendMail to use, and which mail applications does SendMail know how to use?\n\nA: I believe it looks to see which is your default mail app.  I also think that it will pretty much only work with Mail.app.  If you go into Mail.app, check which is the default email app (and re-set it, if required) on the Preferences -> General screen.  I bet setting it to Mail will fix your problem.\n", "Q: Educational discount at Apple Retail Stores? Is it possible to get educationally-priced hardware by visiting any given physical Apple Store, or is that only achievable online or at college stores?\n\nA: Yes, you can get educational discounts at a physical Apple Store -- I have done it, though it has been a while ;-).\nThey require verification of your status which can generally be done with a student id. \n\nA: Yes, you can get the educational discount at an Apple Store. Just make sure to bring your student ID.\n", "Q: iMac bundled pointing devices With the purchase of a new iMac, Apple seems to be offering your choice of Mighty Mouse (Apple Mouse) or Magic Mouse with the option of adding a Magic Trackpad to the Magic Mouse. I have no interest in either of those mice, and would prefer to simply get a Magic Trackpad with my iMac, which is priced the same as a Magic Mouse. Would Apple Retail be able to set me up with this at a brick-and-mortar Apple Store?\n\nA: Probably not.\nThe retail stores only sell the standard configurations of their products. When looking at the specs for \"What's in the Box\" for an iMac, it includes a Magic Mouse. They'd have to open up the box and take out the mouse while giving you the separately packaged Magic Trackpad.\nYou're best chance is getting the Magic Trackpad thrown in at a discount.\n", "Q: Installing a HP Color LaserJet 1600 on MacOS 10.6.4 I'm trying to install a HP Color LaserJet 1600 on MacOS 10.6.4 with little luck.

If it has a clock, does it have other stuff?\n\nA: You can find some information about the guts of an iPod Shuffle here.\nAlso because the selling point of a Shuffle is price (and portability) while still maintaining the Apple quality I don't think Apple would put much more components into it than what is absolutely necessary.\n", "Q: Problems integrating Python 3.1 on 10.6.5 I am beginning to learn Python, and want to \"upgrade\" my Python installation os OS X 10.6.5.\nI know it's a bad idea to directly upgrade the Python install, so I have installed Python 3.1 separately from the default Python install (2.6.1).\nHowever, whenever I use the \"python\" command from the terminal, it starts up Python 2.6.1.\nI have tried multiple recommended ways to get the \"python\" command to start up the newest version, rather then the default:\n1) I have tried running the script \"Update Shell Profile.command\" script in the Applications/Python 3.1 directory, and get the following output:\n    This script will update your shell profile when the 'bin' directory\nof python is not early enough of the PATH of your shell.\nThese changes will be effective only in shell windows that you open\nafter running this script.\nAll right, you're a python lover already\n\n2) I have created a file named .profile in my home directory, with the following contents:\n#### Let's take care of our $PATH\n# A backup of the original $PATH\n# /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin\n\n# My preferred order - /usr/local goes first, damn it!\nPATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/X11/bin\n\nAs recommended here: https://superuser.com/questions/29652/how-do-i-properly-update-python-on-mac-os-x\nNeither one changes the effects of the \"python\" command; it still starts up Python 2.6.1. I can still start Python 3.1 by using the command python3.1, but I'd like to set Python 3.1 to the default for the \"python\" command.\n\nA: At least with MacPorts, this is done with the python_select command.  It may not be immediately applicable to your setup (you didn't mention MacPorts) but it's somewhere to start.\n\nA: What shell do you use? On OS X, /bin/bash is the default, so try editing .bashrc or .bash_profile instead.\n\nA: All you have to do to change this is open Terminal.app, and enter the following: \n\ndefaults write com.apple.versioner.python Version 3.1\n\nThis will change the default used in the terminal. You can also install separate IDLEs if you want to run from a GUI. \n", "Q: Can a jailbroken iPhone and a non-jailbroken iPod Touch operate on the same machine/itunes I have a iPod touch that is not jailbroken. Recently I was given a jailbroken iPhone by somebody. I want to know if I can use both devices with the same iTunes installed on my laptop? Will using a jailbroken iPhone mess up with the iPod touch syncing?\nThanks\n\nA: Sure, it'll be fine.  I did that for a while after I got my iPad and still had my jailbroken iPhone 3G.\nJailbreaking, at least at its basic level, doesn't mess with most of the basic functions of the device such as syncing.  All bets are off if you install some JB app that is specifically meant to alter some part of the sync process, but even then it's very unlikely it will cause trouble of the iPod.\n\nA: I have a jailbroken iPod and do (uncommonly) experience syncing problems. It uncommonly displays an error message saying \"Could Not Connect to This iPod\" and I just re-connect and all is well.\n", "Q: Concatenate two videos recorded with Snapz Pro I've recorded two videos with Snapz Pro, and I'd like to concatenate them (i.e., have one immediately follow the other in a single file). What's the easiest way to do that? I have iMovie '08 installed, and I can use it to combine the two into a single movie. However, I can't get it to export the resulting video at the same resolution as the original video.\nAccording to the QuickTime player inspector, the video formats of the two original videos are \"Apple Animation, 1164x1153, Millions IMA 4:1, Mono, 22.050 kHz', FPS: 9.97 fps.\n\nA: Becuase Apple Animation is an older QuickTime format, you should give QuickTime Player 7 a try, which has basic editing capabilities. If you're on Snow Leopard, it may not be installed, but you can fix that pretty quickly\nIf you need more than what QuickTime Player provides, it might be worth looking at QuickTime Pro.\n\nA: If you have QuickTime 7 Pro, this is as easy as copy and paste.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open both videos in QuickTime\n\n*Select and copy the contents of one video\n(⌘+A,\n⌘+C)\n\n*Switch to the other video and move the playhead to the desired insertion point (e.g. the beginning or end) and paste (⌘+V)\n\n\nThen you can save the combined movie.\nOf course, it is likely you don't already have QuickTime 7 Pro already installed. Apple charge extra for QuickTime Pro (£20) which may not be worthwhile for you if you don't use it much. Also, if you are using Snow Leopard, that includes QuickTime X which doesn't have a Pro version available. In that case you'd need to install QuickTime 7 in addition to QuickTime X.\nI imagine there has to be a way to do it with iMovie as well, but I don't have experience with that. Perhaps someone else might.\n", "Q: How do I get Windows to assign a drive letter to my iPhone? I want to be able to move photos and videos from my iPhone onto my Windows PC, but the iPhone doesn't present itself like a compact camera. Because my existing import process works so well with normal compact cameras (they have drive letters!), I don't want to have to mess around with extra programs.\nWhen I connect my iPhone, I don't get a new drive letter for it. Instead of e.g. K:\\DCIM\\800AAAAA I just get the very cryptic address Computer\\Torbens iPhone 4\\Internal Storage\\DCIM\\800AAAAA. Windows Explorer can navigate this path, but no programs can access the path.\nHow do I get Windows to assign a drive letter to my iPhone?\nI am not interested in programs that can look into my iPhone and allow me to manually copy files from it to my harddisk. (iFunBox, DiskAid, Wifi photo transfer app, WinAmp - as mentioned in this recent question)\nI want a drive letter! When I have that, I can continue to use my existing photo-importing applications that do everything with a single click! (Moving rather than copying, file renaming based on timestamp, etc.) \nIs there some hack app that will make the iPhone present itself with a drive letter? This would probably not be a Windows application but rather an iPhone jailbreak app, but any solution is welcome.\nI'm running Win7 and a jailbroken iOS 4.1. \n\nA: I get a drive letter just fine under XP. Under XP a dialog pops up each time I plug it in, asking how it should be handled. By canceling it ends up being handled as a drive.\nMy guess is that there's a setting, probably related to cameras and photos, that will change how Windows 7 handles it by default. Unfortunately I've no Win 7 machine handy.\n\nA couple of suggestions from Googling for answers:\n\n*\n\n*Many people have solved the problem by deleting any photos on their iPhone that weren't actually taken with the iPhone. Anything received in email, saved to disk in Safari, etc. After clearing those out the device again appeared as a drive.\n\n\n*Reinstall the iPhone driver in Windows 7 by following instructions from Apple Support.\n\n\nEDITED TO ADD WIN XP, AS REQUESTED\n\nGetting Windows XP to Present Itself as a Drive-Like Camera\nFirst, the way I have things set up, which may or may not affect how it works for you: I am running all of the XP service packs, updated regularly through Software Update, with no special drivers or applications. My account is an administrator on my PC. iTunes 10.1 is installed, though it is not involved with the camera stuff (it's possible that having iTunes installed does provide some kind of driver, I don't know). My iPhone is a stock iPhone 3GS, non-jailbroken, running iOS 4.2.1. Note that all of this worked identically with iTunes 9 and my phone running iOS 3.0.1.\nEvent Handling\nThe first time you attach your iPhone to your WinXP PC a dialog much like the following should appear:\n\nDrive List\nIf you choose one of the Microsoft Office handlers, the Wizard, or another app like Photoshop, your phone  will not present itself as a camera (more on changing that behavior below). If you click Cancel then the dialog will disappear and the camera will become available.\n\nWindows Explorer Media Directory\nIf you then double-click on the iPhone icon all of the images and movies are presented:\n\nYou can freely drag photos and videos out of the directory. You can drag stuff in, too.\nChanging the Event Handler\nIf at some point you chose an event handler rather than clicking Cancel you can change how XP handles the iPhone. You'll need to get to the phone's Properties, which may require opening the Scanners and Cameras control panel. Click on the dialog's Events tab to see this:\n\nIf you change your current setting to Prompt then you'll get that first dialog I showed when you plug in your device. You can also choose Take no action if you want it to always behave like a drive.\n\nA: I've successfully mapped a drive letter to the iPad on Win7 64 machine. Just install the Air Sharing app on the iPad and map using the Bonjour address.\n", "Q: Is there a bash command to check to see if Time Machine has finished backing up? I'm writing a script that will rsycnc my Time Machine directory to a remote server using ssh. I've switched from a shell script to an AppleScript and then back to an Apple script and I don't really care what kind of script the solution will require. \nI've had success starting the backup process with this little snippet of code.\ndo shell script \"/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/backupd-helper >/dev/null 2>&1 &\"\n\nWhat I'm trying to do now is have an rsync command performed once that backup is completed. Is there any clean way in AppleScript to check to see if the backup process is completed? Or is there a good \"hook\" that you can use in bash to check to see if it's completed?\n\nA: You might also start the backup with tmutil startbackup -b. -b blocks the command until the backup has finished.\n\nA: Here's one way - I know it's nowhere near a \"proper\" solution, but I imagine it would work.\nps ax | grep \"/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/backupd-helper\" | grep -v 'grep'\nWhat it does is search the process list for the backupd-helper process, then filters out the grep command itself from showing up.  If the command returns > 0 results, the backupd-helper process is still active.  If not, the process has ended, and so you might assume it's done.\n\nA: tmutil status|grep -c \"Running = 1\"\nreturns '1' when running, '0' when not.\n\nA: Absence of backup-related processes is not assurance that a Time Machine backup is complete\nOn the volume to which Time Machine writes its backups: alongside the …/Latest/… directory, consider: \n\n\n*\n\n*the ….inProgress/… bundle. \n\n\nIf that bundle exists, a backup is incomplete. \n\nA: tmutil status is the Lion way now that we have a nice tool for this sort of query.\nOn newer OS, there is an undocumented command tmutil currentphase that shows the name of the current phase.\n\nA: The following work for me...\n\nScript backup_status:\n    #!/usr/bin/env bash\n    #\n    # Determines if Time Machine is running and works with older Mac OS x versions\n    #\n    if [ x == x`type -P tmutil` ]; then\n            # Older OSx\n            count=`ps -ef | grep -v grep | grep -c 'CoreServices/backupd'`\n            # Should also detect /Volume/Time Machine …/Latest/… directory ….inProgress/… bundle existence here to make it tight.\n    else\n            # OSx 10.7+\n            count=`tmutil status | grep -c \"Running = 1\"`\n    fi\n\n    if [ $count == 0 ]; then\n            echo stopped\n    else\n            echo running\n    fi\n\n\nScript backup_wait:\n    #!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n    #\n    # Waits for Time Machine backup to complete\n    #\n    while [ `backup_status` == running ] ; do\n            sleep 2\n    done\n\n\n\nA: tmutils only exists from 10.7 on. Before that you can use, as mentioned, /System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/backupd-helper to manually run Time Machine.\nYou can then use wait to wait until the process is finished. Without arguments it will simply wait; if you provide the PID you can get its return value (exit status).\nParticularly, wait $! will wait for the last process started in that shell. However, as Lauri mentioned, this wait will return before time machine is finished because backupd-helper finishes before the backup is done. I was not able to find any process name that indicated that the backup was not complete.\nLooking at the contents of /var/logs/system.log (or via the Console), I noticed that when the backup is finished, the last thing that is done is to eject the time machine disk image. Sure enough I checked that (this is OS X 10.6.8) during the backup there is a /Volumes/Time Machine Backups. Thus you can simply check if the directory exists. When it no longer does, Time Machine is finished.\nI am not sure if this will work for everyone since I've followed the directions here to backup to a Windows machine on the network.\n", "Q: Replace my MacBook Pro 15\" 2009 hard drive I need to replace my MacBook Pro 15\" 2009 hard drive with a bigger size. Will this hard drive: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136545&Tpk=western%20digital%202.5 be compatible with my Mac?\n\nA: According to Other World Computing, which specializes in Mac accessories & parts, that hard drive fits \"all Apple MacBook/MacBook Pro 'Unibody' Models (13/15/17\"), MacBook Pro 'pre-unibody' 17\", and PC Laptops which support 12.5mm SATA Drives\".\nSo I'd say you're good to go.\n", "Q: How can I forward delete on iOS? Is there a way to delete text in front of the caret using the iOS software keyboard? The small wireless hardware keyboard accomplishes this with a fn+delete, so there might be a way to use multiple keys to accomplish the same task in iOS?\n\nA: Nope. In the stock keyboard provided by the API, a \"Forward Delete\" (as opposed to a Backward Delete/Backspace), none of the keys, nor combination therein, provide a Delete keystroke to occur. Your only option, as you now see, is to use an external keyboard to accomplish this.\nAny other options would just be something else entirely. Like selecting a word, and deleting it, or using replace, etc.\n\nA: This answer won’t solve the problem now, but maybe someday soon.  Please go to the iPhone Feedback page and request the feature.  It might help if you reference FB9680931, shown below, so we all pile on to the same request.\n\n", "Q: Fastest way to split a video file into two? Does anyone know of software for OS X that can quickly split a 2 hour H.264 video file into two 1 hour files? iMovie estimates 2 hours just to import the file. I was hoping for something that could do it quicker.\n\nA: The easiest tool would probably be Quicktime 7 Pro.  I believe it is available on Apple's store for $30.\nIf you prefer a CLI method, take a look at mp4box.  It has a -split option that does what you're describing.\n\nA: You might also be able to do this using Quicktime X. Open the movie, then choose Edit -> Trim... Trim away the second part of the movie file and do a save as to get the first part in a separate file. Re-open the original file and trim away the first part, save as to get the second part in a separate file. \nI've only been able to try it with a 5 minute long movie, which was quick enough, but I'm unsure of how quickly it'll work with a 2 hour movie.\n\nA: Movie Splitter\n\nSplit MPEG-4 movies with ease and speed.\n\nMovie Splitter can split your H.264 (.mp4) movie into two halves. A multi-gigabyte split typically takes a minute or two. The bulk of the time is spent reading and writing the file.\nIf an application takes longer than a few minutes, it is likely re-encoding your movie. You do not want this because it risks reducing the quality of your split movie files.\nPlease note I wrote Movie Splitter and am likely bias.\n\n\nA: Some other options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Splitfuse\n($12, free to try)\n\n*Simple Video Splicer which looks free, but I havn't tried it. You'll see the link on the right of the dev's page. \n\n\nA: http://www.hjsplit.org/\nCompletely free, completely awesome.\n", "Q: How can I view and copy an email address in a message header within iOS' Mail.app? If I reply-to-all on an inbound message with multiple recipients within iOS' Mail.app, I can't view or move/copy the email address of any recipients - I can only view the a 'bubble' which contains their name.\nCurious if there is a way to view the actual email address while composing, and ideally, copy the address (in case I wanted to move it from the TO: field to the CC: field)\n\nA: In 4.2 at least, you can tap on the bubble to see the email address, then press and hold on the email address.  A copy option will appear above it.\n\nA: Click on \"forward\". Then you can see all the headers   Then click cancel to go back to the email. \n\nA: Press an address bubble for half a second or so until it puffs up a bit then drag it to the To or Cc field to copy it over. Tap to select the name bubble, then tap the now highlighted bubble again to reveal the address.\n", "Q: Where can I find iTunes 9 for Tiger (possibly in my language)? I've an issue on a old Mac with Tiger.\nI cannot upgrade iTunes to version 9. (I cannot find version 9, and I'm actually looking for the Italian version).\niTunes suggests to upgrade to 10, but this version doesn't work on Tiger. So it is suggesting an impossible update.\nthanks\n\nA: Apple maintains lists of download links of the older versions of their software from the Support section of their website. Sometimes they come up in Google searches, but they are hard to find no matter what. I've grabbed versions of iTunes for Mac OS 10.4 from their site recently, so start digging around their Support section.\nUPDATE: Here is the page I was thinking of: http://support.apple.com/downloads/ Just search for the software you're looking for, it shouldn't be too hard to find there\n\nA: Here is a link to at least iTunes 9.1.1 for Mac http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1036\n", "Q: iMovie 9.0: how do you make clips shorter than 5ms? I'm trying to make a stop motion animation and I can't seem to find a way to make clips shorter than 5ms. By \"clip\" I mean the images I drag into the time line. I try to adjust it by hovering over the timeline object, click on the cog, then go to clip adjustments, then edit the duration.\nHow do I make a clip shorter than 5ms? \n\nA: I don't think it's possible to make the clips shorter then 5ms in any video software, because depending on the frame rate a single frame takes more time (16,6 ms for 60 fps). It doesn't make much sense to add a clip to a video, that is so short that it is not seen on screen for at least one frame.\n\nA: I don't have an official document anywhere outlining this as a specific limitation, but having used iMovie for a while, and having just tried to replicate what you're trying to do, I'm fairly confident in saying that this isn't supported in iMovie. Final Cut will certainly support this sort of fine-grain clip control, but iMovie is very consumer orientated and I wouldn't expect it to support something as niche as this. Perhaps it's worth giving Final Cut Express/Pro a try to see if it meets your requirements?\n", "Q: Mac display won't turn on I have an Apple HD display that has been in our IT depart for a few months now. It was working fine until recently (the past month or two). I can turn it on and it will work for a few days, but then it suddenly will stop working.  If I unplug the monitor, wait for a few days, and then plug it back in, the monitor will work again for a few more days.\nI suspect the issue is the 90W power converter, but before I invest the 140 dollars I was wondering: Has anyone else had the same issue? If so, how did you solve it?  \n\nA: If it is new, then I suggest taking it back to Apple for repair, especially if it still under warranty so that you don't have to spend $140 on what is ultimately a guess.\n", "Q: Macbook Air (Oct 2010) Photoshop & Web development laptop? I currently have a 2008 MBP and am thinking of getting a new computer. I was wondering if the MBA OCT 2010 edition with max cpu (2.13GHz Intel Core 2 Duo) and 4gb ram would work well with photoshop and some web development? The tools I use are photoshop, dreamweaver, textmate,coda, and transmit, also my MBP from 2008 is 4gb intel core 2 duo 2.4 ghz. Would the MBA be faster then my 2008 MBP? \n\nA: A similar question was asked over at Programmers.SE, though it was about iOS development. Some might say that's not the same thing, but Photoshop is a robust application that allows you to install some very heavy-duty plug-ins and it has some of its own as well. The consensus could be gotten from the top two answers (mine, which has the higher vote count, and the other which was accepted):\nMine with 5 votes:\n\n...leaving aside price, I would\n  recommend a MacBook Pro for any\n  serious development work instead. A\n  MacBook Pro is more easily upgradeable\n  to suit needs than an Air (if it is\n  even upgradeable at all). The Air\n  seems more targeted to lighter-weight\n  uses.\n\nAccepted with 4 votes:\n\nIt's obviously not going to be the\n  fastest machine but it's perfectly\n  suitable.\nI'd say the 13\" over the 11\" because\n  reasonable screen size is a big deal\n  for development, and it can go up to\n  4Gb RAM rather than 2Gb (absolutely go\n  for the 4Gb RAM model on day one and\n  if you can afford it the faster\n  processor as I suspect upgrading later\n  isn't something Apple will be\n  pushing).\nYes it's got limitations (basically\n  the same as any laptop - essentially\n  screen and power are limited next to a\n  desktop) but I have the new one and\n  it's entirely workable and I know\n  others who use them (and used the old\n  MacBook Air) day to day with no\n  problems.\n\nI, personally, still wouldn't recommend the MBA for any type of development work, web or otherwise. I've yet to do anything developing for iOS that causes me to bog down my machine the way Photoshop can and will.\n\nA: I use a Oct 2010 Air for development work, that includes working in Coda on RoR sites, light Photoshop, XCode iOS development and C++ work in QtCreator. This is frequently with Ubuntu running in VBox at the same time. \nIt works, it's not going to be so fast your eyes fall out. I've never seen mine get bogged down at all, it stays perfectly solid unless I'm really really pushing it and that's incredibly rare. Plus, you know, 8 hours battery life, I'll take portable and long life over the extra weight and more power.\n(As a side note I opened 50 3.5Mb PSDs in about 30 seconds without the system stuttering, so that might have an indication of the relative speed)\n\nA: As a web developer who uses a Mac Pro and sits next to another dev who uses just a 13\" MBA (MC504LL/A (256 GB)), for web development (especially if you're starting and stopping a server often) the Air often \"feels\" faster than much more powerful machines, though to be fair, on the Mac Pro (with a single 2TB 7200rpm drive), I have 9GB of ram, and tend to leave more things running/open as a result. This is almost entirely the SSD's doing. So putting an SSD in the 13\" MBP would be a big help to overcome that.\nSo from my experience it works well for web development and some Photoshoping, which is more what I do.\nI'm looking to replace a 2006 Macbook I still use for freelance work, but Apple really made it a tough by keeping the lower-res screen in the 13\" MBP, that's the only thing that's making the Air look more attractive at this point.\nEdit: After seeing this video I decided to go with the Air (Thunderbolt) MBA (Oct 2010) + Photoshop video\n", "Q: Mac OS Desktop coordinate problem I'm having a hard time working with Mac OS screen coordinates.  I can use ⌘+⇧+4 to get them, but each of my monitors does not have a unique coordinate system??!?\nI have a desktop of 4 screens arranged in a 2x2 pattern. Each screen has a size of (2048 pixels x 1152 pixels).  (And the Apple Menu Bar is on the top-left screen).\n⌘+⇧+4 gives the upper-left of each screen as (0,0) and the lower right as (2048,1152).\nBut each screen does that!\nTechnically, the coordinate system \"should\" run from (0,0) to (4096,2304). How do I differentiate the coordinates of the individual monitors?\nFurthermore, when I create a window at (500,500) it creates it in the top-left monitor at (500,652)\nSo I just don't understand what's going on. How can I get an accurate coordinate map for the Mac OS desktop with multiple monitors?\n\nA: If you have Developer Tools installed, you could try running Pixie.app and configuring that to give you coordinates. It might calculate them differently.\n", "Q: iPhone 1 gen , slide to unlock is not responding I have an iPhone 1 gen and the iOS version 3.1.1 the latest for 1st gen iPhone. Suddenly I am not able to slide the slider which unlocks the home screen.\n\nA: Your phone has likely hung. Press and hold the power button to try to power it off. If that still fails to happen, the other solution would be to hard reset the iphone:\nTo reset the iPhone, simply press the POWER/SLEEP button and Home button together. Hold them until you can see the boot screen, which is with black background and Apple logo. One point to note is you have to release both buttons at the same time.\nThis will not erase your data. \nIf the iPhone fails to work after that, you might have to restore it using iTunes. But I don’t think that’s the case.\n", "Q: Did the iPod Nano dock connector change from 5th to 6th generation? Does anyone know if the dock connector change when Apple upgraded from 5th to 6th generation?\n\nA: They did, and unfortunately there's no adapter for it yet. You can see more information on the Apple support pages here:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1380?viewlocale=en_US\nMy understanding is that the new iPod Nano likely won't fit with a number of older, existing devices.\nI should also mention that although there's no adapter, it still has a standard Dock connector, so it'll work with your existing cables, etc.\n\nA: I have a dock connector to 3.5 mm head phone jack that I use to connect to a headphone\namplifier, using my 4th gen iPod I got an output. The 5th and 6th gen iPods would not produce an audio out signal using the connector.\nWhat I determined is that pin 11 on the dock connector is used to enable audio out on the dock connector if pin 11 is grounded. I took a my dock connector apart and pin 11 was not connected. Determining which pin 11 is was difficult as the connector is quite small. After soldering a jumper between pin 11 and ground my 5th and 6th gen iPods can once again be used with the headphone amplifier.\nIt seem the the 5th and 6th gens check for the pin 11 being at ground before audio comes out of the dock connector, where as the older generations sent audio to the dock regardless. I bought the connector online — I went to the Apple store but they do not have a connector like that, otherwise I would have bought one of theirs.\n\nA: I just got the iPod Nano 6th generation, and was able to plug it into my Altec Lansing IMT325 via dock connector without any problems.\nSo, I think the 6th generation iPod dock connector is not different from the 5th generation at all.\n(The Altec Lansing IMT325 says on the box that it works with iPod Nano 3rd to 5th generation, which led to my original question.)\n", "Q: Can I configure the modem on my G5 to only allow calls from certain numbers to ring through? This is a weird question, I know, but... I have an alarm system which I can call into and send commands to, I.E. to arm/disarm/listen to the ambient noise. However, for this to work obviously it has to pick up the line, which prevents me from using voicemail for anyone who calls me.\nInstead of getting a separate phone line, I was wondering, if I plug my G5 into the phone line and plug this device's telephone line in to the telephone line out of my G5, is there any way the G5 could only tell the alarm system the phone is ringing for certain caller ID numbers?\n\nA: I can think of a variety of methods to do what you want, but none of them are easy solutions. You'll probably need to write some code. This question should be tagged PBX, but that is too obscure for this site.\nYou'll probably want minicom installed to control the G5 modem. Get it via fink or macports. If you can use minicom to check the number without answering, then you are mostly done. If it doesn't match, ignore it. If it does match, you'll need to find some way for minicom to answer/forward/pass the incoming call out the modem out line. I'm not yet sure how to do this.\nIf minicom needs to answer the call in order to determine where it came from, then the situation is as above, but you might need two modems. If it is a call for the security center, pass it out one modem. If it isn't, pass it out the other, which goes to your home phone I presume.\nIf minicom cannot determine the number, or if can but has to answer in order to check it and this is problematic, then I would get a caller ID display, put it in next to the G5, and use a webcam to read the numbers off the caller ID. OpenCV would help with this part, or any script-able optical character recognition (OCR) software. You can get gocr from fink or macports too, and that might be sufficient. Determine the number and if it should go to the security console, have minicom patch it through.\nBut, why do you need to call in?\nIf your G5 is at home and online, it might be easier to not call into the security system, but SMS or email yourself, have the G5 fetching the mail, and taking action based on that (perhaps that action is using minicom to connect to the security system, but you don't need a phone line to the outside world in this case).\n", "Q: Can I use my iMac as a display with my MacBook? Is it possible to attach my MacBook to my iMac and use the iMac as a display? What cable/connector would I need?\nEDIT:\nI have the newest MacBook and a Late 2009 21.5\" iMac.\n\nA: Which model of iMac do you have? Only the latest 27-inch model supports video in physically.

I'd like to sell both and upgrade.\n\nA: If you're in the USA, gazelle.com can be a good place, but the prices aren't always great.\n\nA: I believe you can trade your machine(s) in when you purchase a new one from Apple.  They will reduce your cost for the new machine, certify your old ones and do any repairs necessary, and put them back on the market for others to purchase.\nhttp://www.apple.com/recycling/\n\nA: I've heard of these guys several times previously, but don't have any experience of using them myself. http://www.powermax.com/ I suspect you won't get the best deal if trading in an old machine.\n", "Q: FM Tuner for iPod Touch Is there a way to add (or even enable) a FM tuner for the iPod Touch? The only thing stopping me from getting one is the missing FM tuner. By the way, I need the FM tuner to listen to TV shows at the gym (they transmit the sound through a FM transmitter). So I cannot replace the FM tuner by Pandora.\n\nA: I don't know for sure whether the fourth generation iPod actually has a built in FM Tuner. However, external FM Tuner adapters are quite prevalent.\nEdit: Whoops, sorry about that, I did link the wrong item. Chops is correct, that was a transmitter. The link now points to the original item I had intended to link.\n", "Q: Why don't I have a camera on my iPod touch? Why do a couple of my friends have a camera on their iPod touch and I don't?\n\nA: Only the 4th generation iPod Touch has cameras, that is the iPod Touch that was introduced back in September. The iPod Touch you have is either a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd generation, which means it doesn't have the camera.\n\nA: As far as I know, only the 4th gen iPod touch has a camera. Yours is probably older.\nAs you can see from the specifications published on Apple's site, there are no mention of a camera for the third gen iPod touch, while the fourth gen has detailed information about it.\n", "Q: key combo to toggle showing hidden items Is there a key combination I can use to show/hide hidden items in Finder?\n\nA: I don't think you can do this by default.\nI myself use Hidden Files widget. it's so easy to use.\n\n\nA: You can do it with two small shell scripts:\nThis will reveal the \"invisible\" files:\n#!/bin/sh\n# make invisible files visible\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE\nkillall Finder\n\nThis will hide the \"invisible\" files made visible:\n#!/bin/sh\n# make visible files invisible\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE\nkillall Finder\n\nSave each into an appropriately named file, set their executable bits using chmod, then you can run them to set or unset the visibility.\nAlternately, you could use the following code, and toggle back and forth by executing the code repeatedly:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nshowFiles=`defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles`\nif [ \"$showFiles\" = 1 ]\n then defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool FALSE\n else defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool TRUE\nfi\n\nkillall Finder\n\n\nA: I have an AppleScript I use to toggle things like these off and on:\nhttp://www.markdouma.com/developer/ToggleInvisibleFiles.zip\nThe code:\nproperty showAllFiles : missing value -- missing value is AppleScript equivalent of nil or NULL\n\ntry\n    set showAllFiles to (do shell script \"/usr/bin/defaults read -g AppleShowAllFiles\")\non error\n    set showAllFiles to \"0\"\nend try\n\ntell application \"Finder\" to quit\n\nif showAllFiles = \"0\" then\n    do shell script \"/usr/bin/defaults write -g AppleShowAllFiles 1\"\n    say \"AppleShowAllFiles 1\"\n    --say \"Now showing invisible files\"\nelse if (showAllFiles = \"1\") then\n    do shell script \"/usr/bin/defaults write -g AppleShowAllFiles 0\"\n    say \"AppleShowAllFiles 0\"\n    --say \"Now hiding invisible files\"\nend if\n\ntell application \"Finder\" to activate\n\n(Note, you can open up the downloaded AppleScript by dragging it to the icon of AppleScript Editor.app).\nI generally prefer to tell applications to quit rather than kill them (though, with the sudden termination feature introduced in 10.6, that can sometimes be the same thing).\nOh, mine differs from Greg's in that I set it for the global preference domain (so that it affects all apps, including the Open and Save dialogs). (Though you can always toggle invisible files off or on in Open or Save panels using Command-Shift-period ).\n", "Q: Where can I find the AirPrint firmware update for my HP 8500A printer? I was excited when my new HP 8500A arrived this weekend because I wanted to try out its recently added AirPrint compatibility. However, I can't seem to find the requisite firmware update for the printer. Since I haven't updated the firmware when I tap print from Safari I'm told no printer can be found. What am I missing to enable AirPrint on my HP 8500a?\n\nA: As noted in my question the printer requires a firmware upgrade to become AirPrint compatible. What is not clear on HP's AirPrint website is how one goes about updating the firmware. Playing with the menus on the printer I finally found that attempting to access the web apps menu causes the printer to check if it has the latest firmware. The printer then determined that it did not and proceeded to download and install the firmware update. After the update the iPad lists the printer as an option for printing. My programmer brain was probably making this too hard looking for a non-consumer friendly way of doing the update. That said can't say opening up the web apps menu is the most obvious way to check for a firmware update.\n\nA: Sorry to answer a question with a question, but are these the drivers you're after?\nIf not have you followed the network setup for your printer (via your computer or the printer itself) and turned on ePrint / AirPrint?\n", "Q: OS X application shortcut folder in dock and icon updates after installation Here is the setup: I have the Applications folder right in the dock, which is the default after installation afaik.\nNow I have a custom build DMG with an application in there which I drag&drop into the Application folder. When I open the Application folder from the dock and look for the newly installed app, it does not have the application icon it should.\nThe App is custom build as well. It uses the info.plist to specify the icon file to be used - which is called cc.icns and located in the Contents/Resources folder \nI think this might be a problem with the icon cache and can be resolved by logout/login - a solution that I'm not looking for. Afaik there are apps that do not have this problem. (Right? Wrong?)\nAny suggestions on this?\n\nA: If you want to avoid the Login/Logout, restarting the dock should be enough: killall Dock from the Terminal should be enough.\n\nA: Apparently there's an application that takes care of the quarantining 'problem' - that is, when an application is first installed, OS X will not launch it without approval from you, the first time only.\nThere is a utility that can get around this called Deeper.

Please share your experiences and reviews about NAS (Network-Attached Storage) below. In particular, rate their compatibility with Macs, OS X, iTunes, Time Machine, AppleTV, and other Apple-specific tools. The goal is for future users to be able to easily find the best Mac-compatible NAS appliance.\nRules:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a single answer for each NAS (no duplicates, please).\n\n*Vote (up or down) on any NAS you have experience with.\n\n\nAlso welcome: useful reference links, such as this one from xlr8yourmac.com.\n\nA: Drobo FS\nThe Drobo FS is my new favourite NAS. I've run a Netgear ReadyNAS and a PC-based NAS in the past and neither touch the Drobo FS for simplicity, speed and reliability. The ReadyNAS suffered from poor RAID performance, especially on reboots when volumes needed to be scanned. And the power supply in it was really lame. And the PC-based NAS was just a pain to maintain and costly to keep up.\nThe Drobo FS is super simple to set up. Has very, very good volume build and scanning speeds on startup. Has what has to be the best hot-swapping of any multi-disk unit I've ever seen that was in the sub-$10k range. And performs like a champ while drawing very little power.\nI now run an FS for home sharing and an old Drobo hangs off my iMac for audio project data. They are teh awesome.\n\nA: Time Capsule\nThe Time Capsule can be used as a shared drive.\nIt is also a Wi-Fi router, and is automatically recognized as a backup device for Time Machine.\n\nA: Freenas using generic hardware\nI love the ability to grab an old computer, fill it full of cheap hard drives, and install Freenas on a CF card or USB drive. Software RAID is reliable. \nA key point, if any of the hardware dies, the RAID array can be rebuilt when the software is installed on new hardware, unlike some proprietary solutions (NAS or RAID cards) where you may be tied to a particular vendor and/or model, which, after time, may not be sold/available.\nWorks fine with Macs and PCs -- and for this reason i use SMB shares rather than AFP. Performance is fine.\nI use the SMB shares to stream to all the computers in the house, and there is no problem.\nTime Machine backups are a little more complex, involving creating a Sparse Bundle (which is not the official method). For this reason, i don't do this, i use Carbon Copy Cloner to run to a disk image (dmg) every night.\nI use MediaRover to sync iTunes libraries, and this works fine. Other iTunes support is available (an iTunes/DAAP server called Firefly), but i haven't used it.\nIt has a BitTorrent server built in, but again, i haven't used it.\nAdministration is very easy (web based), setup is not difficult, but there are several steps to add disks, format them, create a RAID array, create a mount point, enable the services (AFP or SMB) to access. Documentation and community support are satisfactory.\n\nA: Don't want start any flamewar, but today here is only NAS solution - the ZFS based NAS.\nZFS is a filesystem, what has \"copy on write\" feature, so you will get a backup in every save - fully transparently. ZFS has million really cool features like raid management, snapshots etc.. too much for one post. If you interested can duckduck for ZFS.\nZFS is implemented in Solaris and in the FreeBSD. So, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*use some older (but 64bit+lots of RAM) PC with a plenty of HDDs and\n\n*\n\n*download and install FreeNAS. You will get web-managed NAS with Samba and etc.\n\n*install plain FreeBSD and config it as NAS plus some your own tweaking - IMHO this is the best way.\n\n\n*you can also buy an preconfigured FreeBSD/ZFS NAS too\n\n\nYou should definitely check theese:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://breden.org.uk/2008/03/02/home-fileserver-i’ll-use-zfs/\n\n*http://blogs.oracle.com/constantin/entry/zfs_and_mac_os_x\n\nA: Western Digital MyBook World Edition\nYesterday I installed a Western Digital MyBook World Edition, 1 TeraByte, single disk.\nPros: very simple to install and work with, includes a Media Server and a iTunes server that can be used to share music and videos across the network. It's pre configured with the common shares and if you copy the files in the proper folders it's very, very simple to use. Quite cheap compared to a similar solution from QNap or Sinology. I did not perform any single task \"mac related\" on it and it worked from start with my Mac.\nCons: old firmware from 2009 and no update available, the single 1 TB disk inside obviously do not support any kind of Raid, no serviceable by changing disk if needed (unless you broke your warranty), the control panel do not give you a lot of control also if you use the so called advanced version.\nDefinitively a good choice for a \"first\" NAS to work and experience with, if you need to go on a cheap model or if you do not have a lot of IT experience, suggested for simple home environment where no redundancy it's needed, I would avoid it if you need redundancy or if you like to fine tune and experiment with every possible option.\nThere is also a public wiki about hacking it but I've not tested any of the stuff described (yet!).\nUPDATE: after some time I've found more problems, all related to the time machine interface:\n1) The quota option do not work with time machine\n2) The Lion update completely stopped the Time Machine usage\nNOT RECOMMENDED ANYMORE!!!!\nUPDATE: The Lion/Time Machine problem will hopefully be fixed soon. Apple changed some things and Western Digital is working on an update. This affects the MyBook Live and MyBook World Edition II. Read more: Error: 'The network backup disk does not support the required AFP features' is displayed using Time Machine on Mac OSX 10.7.x (Lion) to backup to a WD NAS drive\n\nA: Netgear ReadyNAS\nWe recently joined the crowd getting their first NAS, and after taking a close look at several, settled on the Netgear ReadyNAS NV+.\nThe Drobo, previously mentioned, was tempting—but just way too expensive for use on a home network.\nWe've only had it a month or two, but so far, so good. Like most Netgear products, it works well with Macs. There's also a solid community & support site.\n\nA: Western Digital My Book Live\n\n\n*\n\n*Small footprint (same size as MyBook desktop drives)\n\n*Size 1-3 Tb\n\n*Pretty cheap\n\n*TimeMachine compatible over network (firmware just got updated with support for Lion)\n\n*Single disk, no RAID\n\n\nhttp://wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=280\n\nA: Qnap 259PRO+\nThe Qnap TS259Pro+ which uses a 1.8Ghz Dual Core Atom CPU,\nwould be the perfect setup for Sickbeard, and streaming to more than one TV in the house. Take the firmware for a spin with this \"Live Demo\"\n\nA: Seagate Blackarmor NAS220\nAt the moment of buying, the features listed sounded great, and Mac compatible.\nOnce in the studio, and after 4 weeks, it is just a hard drive on the network.\nThese are some of the issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*NOT Time Machine compatible\n\n*Very slow\n\n*Access remotely is useless, hangs everytime. So you cannot access it outside the studio. This was a main reason for buying, and tech support say they know about the issue and are to update... still waiting for it.\n\n*Software for mac is just a discovery tool. The name says it all, it tries to find the NAS, which it initially did, now it no longer detects it. Finder does.\n\n*Only a APC brand UPS is compatible. This was a total surprise, it is only stated in small letters in the manual inside the box, not outside or anywhere else visible before you buy, not even the product web page.\n\n*Very slow, i know i already said that, but it is terribly slow.\n\n\nStay away, not only mac users, but everybody who wants a NAS, this is not an option.\n\nA: Synology DiskStation\nThe Synology DSM software has built-in support for Macs including Apple Fileshare Protocol (afp) and Time Machine support. It has an iTunes server in addition to a regular DLNA Media server. As it is Linux based it is easy to configure the NAS to do rsync backups (ssh login).\nIt has a great web-based desktop-style interface that is very easy to understand and use. The DSM software is constantly being updated and improved.\nThey have solutions from 2-disk on up to 15-disk.  You can find the 4-disk DS411j without drives for less than $400.\n\nA: A Mac\nMy NAS of choice is an old Mac. In my case, I had an old MacBook that wouldn't hold a charge anymore so I rigged up an eSATA connection to my 2TB external drive.\nThe advantages to using an actual Mac over a true NAS system:\n\n*\n\n*Uses first-party AFP on HFS for optimal compatibility. In particular, it supports Spotlight and fast file searches (CatSearch), something that other NAS systems cannot do as well: They usually use a Linux system with netatalk and an ext3 file system which, compared to AFP with HFS, are not optimized for the ways a Mac can search. For more technical information on this, see the Find Any File FAQ, What kind of disks do support \"fast search\"?\nFurther features to consider:\n\n*\n\n*Can serve as a Time Machine backup volume (some other NAS can do that as well).\n\n*Works great as an iTunes master library, connected to my Apple TV and my other Macs via Home Sharing.\n\n*Can run a BitTorrent client to download Linux ISOs and Stack Overflow data dumps (some other NAS can do that as well).\n\n*Use built-in screen sharing to control.\n\n\nA: D-Link DNS-323\nThe D-Link DNS-323 is quite customizable, but should do everything you need out of the box.\nIt has a very active community behind it\n\nA: QNAP is surprisingly perfect actually ;o)\nI use TS-419 for my home use and pretty happy with it.\n\nA: WD My Cloud EX2 12 TB: Pre-configured Network Attached Storage featuring WD Red Drives: $662.5 or $56/TB\nI put together a comparison here: http://forum.railsonmaui.com/t/best-way-to-backup-large-external-hard-drives/305.\nBased on reading many of the numerous reviews, the WD gets the job done at a very competitive price point with few disadvantages.\nI'm ordering one this week and will plan to update my answer. I'll be using it for other network backup and shared network files.\n", "Q: How to promote an iPhone app (productivity / goal-setting) I've made an iPhone application that is a goal-setting workshop (that is - it doesn't just track goals - it helps users to decide upon them). That is quite a novel approach I think.\nThere is a New Year approaching so there will be many articles on New Year's resolutions (and in some cases - goal setting applications). I would like to let journalists know about my app.\nI have already prepared a press release package and sent it to the app review sites. What more can I do? \n\nA: Press packages are a start but the press gets tons of those. There's no way of knowing, but you could be one of several developers that sent a press kit for a similar application. \nYou should definitely have a website for the product to promote it in the way you feel is appropriate. \nAlso, going to developer, mobile, and computer conferences and meeting with Apple, relevant press folks, and interested users is a good way to get attention, just be sure to have business cards and promo codes handy for when you meet people and want to show them your app.\nThere are many articles and books that cover this aspect of iPhone development including strategies on working with the App Store as well, most going beyond the scope of the Q&A format of this site.\n", "Q: How to create a bootable USB drive for Disk Utility? Disk Utility says my boot drive need repair.  Unfortunately my DVD drive is toast, so I can't boot from the install DVD and make the repair.  Is there a way I can create a bootable USB drive and perform the repair that way.  I have an 8Gb USB drive.\n\nA: In order to create a bootable drive, you need the install DVD (or a copy of it) mounted. Sorry…\nDo you have a friend with a Mac? If so, you could take the thumb drive & install DVD there and create a boot drive for yourself.\n\nA: This may not be the solution you want, but you could boot into single-user mode to run a diagnostic on your boot drive.\nTo do this you hold down Command+s when turning the computer on. You'll be dropped into a terminal.\nUse the fsck utility (filesystem check) to examine the boot drive for repairs:\n/sbin/fsck -fy\n\nThis forces the utility to check the filesystem and automatically repair errors it detects.\nIf it the resulting messages reads that the volume appears to be OK, then you've done all you can do from this method. If it reads that the filesystem was modified, run it again. Repeat running the command until you receive the message that the volume is OK, then reboot normally. You can do that just by typing\nreboot\n\nI have had to do this a few times with my own boot drive, and it did fix the problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X: How to start up in single-user or verbose mode\n\nA: This might be a bit risky, but you could try using Carbon Copy Cloner to clone just the bootable portions of your failing drive to the USB drive. The newest version of CCC can tell you specifically what to copy, but basically you'll want the /System folder and a bunch of other Unix directories, and portions of /Library.\nThis CCC FAQ entry describes what specifically needs to be done to make a bootable clone, but basically you'll want to use CCC to copy:\n/Library\n/System\n/bin\n/etc\n/mach_kernel\n/private\n/sbin\n/tmp\n/usr\n/var\n\nBe warned: if your boot drive is physically failing, cloning it like this might very well push it over the edge and kill it. Back up any important documents first. This is a somewhat risky method!\n", "Q: HDTV only detected when turned off (connected via DisplayPort to HDMI) I tried to connect my LG HDTV (42\" LD650) to my MacBook Pro 13\" (mid-2010) using a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter. When I plug the cable in, my MacBook's screen flickers every time but the TV is only detected when it is in standby mode.

I had a similar problem when I first started connecting to my tv because I was set to use Intel graphics only.  The Intel graphics chipset doesn't support HDMI output. \nI see in your system profiler output the NVidia card, but I'm wondering if you're still somehow switched to the Intel...\n", "Q: How to fix links after importing a PPT onto iPad's Keynote? After I transferred my Power Point presentations onto my new iPad, into Keynote, I notice a problem. The links associated with buttons within a Power Point slide to connect to other slides in the presentation are no longer working, but everything else is? \nIs there an easy fix?\n\nA: Keynote for iPad doesn't support links inside the presentation itself (per Apple's Keynote for iPad FAQ). Or at least it doesn't currently; KN/iPad is already a lot better than it was when it first shipped.\n", "Q: Menus overlap/hide Menu Extras. How to access? If I have a bunch of menu extras (the things on the top right side of the menu bar, such as time, date, battery status, and other OS X icons, plus 3rd party icons from QuickSilver, DropBox, etc.), sometimes they are hidden if the foreground application has a lot of or long-named menu items.\nIs there a way that I can access the menu extras that are not displayed because the menu items get priority? I can switch to an app that has fewer menu items, but sometimes the menu extras operate on the foreground app, so this won't always work.\n\nA: I've searched far and wide for a way to do the same thing. The best I can come up with is an app called AccessMenuBarApps. \n\nA: I don't know any way to do this, so I usually switch to finder.\nNote that some extras can be dragged on the menubar while holding down command; this might get some extras that you need in an app with long menu lists accessible from there.\n\nA: Note: See Keyboard icons & terminology if any of this is confusing to you.\nThis may not be a working answer (see below), but it's too big and format-laden for a comment. I notice there's a default shortcut of ^ F8 (and in many cases, Fn ^ F8) which let's you \"Move focus to status menus\".\nHaving said that, in my tests with it, I can't seem to move left of MenuMeters, which means that, for me, Last.fm, Sparrow, Alfred, LittleSnitch, Dropbox, Divvy, and GeekTool's menus cannot be manipulated in this manner. Given that it ends at MenuMeters, I'm curious if that's just a bug. Try Fn ^ F8 or ^ F8 (as necessary), use your left and right arrow keys, and see if this solves your issue?\n", "Q: What are your \"must-have\" MacPorts? I hate to be all cliché with yet another \"best [something]\" question, but I am genuinely interested in what you most often install with MacPorts. When you get a new Mac, which ports do you first install?\nSo far, I've installed wget and watch, since I find those to be very useful on Linux machines. I also installed wine and winetricks to run a Windows program or two. And earlier today I started playing with Scala, so I installed the scala28 port.\nTip: to see your installed ports, use the port installed command.\n\nA: I just compile from source, since all of the important programs build easily on Mac OS X these days.

So I've discovered there are a number of things to be kept up to date in OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*built-in Software Update, obviously\n\n*Individual programs, which typically check for updates automatically and the 'update' option can usually be found under the program's menu (to the right of the Apple menu in the menu bar).\n\n*Gem, which comes preinstalled in OS X (correct me if I'm wrong), should be periodically updated with sudo gem update --system and then the gems updated with sudo gem update - see Greg's answer for why you should not update Ruby.\n\n*MacPorts, if installed, should be periodically updated with sudo port selfupdate and then sudo port upgrade outdated\nAre there any other update processes I'm missing? I've only been using OS X for a few weeks so I want to make sure to keep everything up to date in my system and already I feel like most Mac users don't even know about all of the above (especially the Gem update command).\nAm I somehow wrong in thinking I need to do all of the above?\n\nA: It might be good to not upgrade the system Ruby installed by Apple. Apple installs /usr/lib/podcastproducer, which uses that Ruby, and changing the files could cause it to break if there are version sensitive gems being referenced. In addition, other developers can write code knowing the Ruby is there. \nUse locate *.rb | grep ^/usr | xargs grep require for a file list and the requires.\nI prefer to install a new Ruby, either in /usr/local/bin, or by using RVM to install into a sandbox in ~/.rvm and leave my system version alone.\nSimilarly, Apple's Python and Perl installations are also used by some apps. There's a reason the languages are on there and it's not entirely for our convenience.\n\nA: fink if you use that instead of macports.\nfink selfupdate && fink update-all\n\n\nA: Like I said in another answer, you can update all your applications at once using AppFresh. It can even check your updates from Appl for you.\n\nA: Wait until January 6th, the new Mac App Store that will be opened for Mac OS X will also support the same auto upgrade feature for all product installed like the App Store for iPhone and iPad, so everything will be updated at the same time.\nMeanwhile AppFresh works like a charm.\n", "Q: Can Roambi or any iPad app make authorized http-requests to pull data to visualize? Can Roambi or any iPad app make authorized http-requests to pull data (say JSON or .csv) from some source and interactively visualize it on the iPad screen?\n\nA: I don't know about Roambi (but it does seem like they care about the security of their clients' business data, so the requests from the app are very likely authenticated and encrypted), but of course an iPad app can make HTTP requests that include authentication information, if that was your question. Even Mobile Safari supports Basic Auth, for example.\n", "Q: Not seeing help content of Windows apps in Parallels Configuration: OS X 10.6.x, Parallels-desktop 6, Windows 7\nWhen I press F1 or the help button in any windows app (f.e. MS Office 2010, Delphi 2007/2010), Microsoft Help Viewer or Microsoft Document Viewer try to download content. Accepting this, or canceling, will both result in empty documents, sometimes at least showing an outline of the help file, but no content at all.\nHow can this be fixed?\n\nShow me offline help ... results in a file not found error message (German).\n\nHelp in Notepad works as expected, it's only products installed after Windows that show this behavior. And I do have access to the web, I can call any website from within firefox and retrieve any document from the company network.\n\nA: Installation of version 6.0.11992, the newest release of parallels desktop, fixed the problem. Installing a new release also reinstalled the parallels desktop tool and relinked the shared folders.\nIt took about 5 days for the release to be visible for the parallels updater after it was available. But once it was, all worked like a charm.\nMy problem took place over Christmas, and I was helped wonderfully through these days. I want to thank the people of Parallels support team. (I have to blame myself for spending my time with this problem instead of taking time to worship the king.)\nWhat the problem was never really became clear.

The Windows 7 Help should appear.\nHere’s mine: (in spanish)\n\nIt’s running under Parallels 5, but it gives you an idea. \n\nA: Is it possible that you have some firewall kinda apps that block internet connections? (eg.: LittleSnitch)\nOr is your parallels configured to connect to a non existent network that Windows thinks to be connected to the internet?\nBtw, a screenshot would be helpful\nUpdate:\nOk, that screenshot explains:\nYou have configured Parallels to use Firefox on the Mac as the \"Default Browser\" for the Windows VM also.\nWhen you click help, the help details should open in the \"Help Center\" window, but is opening in the FF on the Mac, because Parallels \"thinks\" that this is a request to IE and redirects to FF on the Mac. (the Help Center uses IE internally, or is built on an IE base, I think)\nTry to remove the setting in parallels configuration for this VM and give a try.\n(I don't have access to a Mac till evening, so unable to give the exact name of the setting. But it should not be difficult to find)\n", "Q: Switching between applications in OS X It is very easy to switch applications in OS X using ⌘-tab. But what if an application is hidden?\nLet me describe some problems I am facing and what I want to accomplish.\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘-tab switches between all opened applications\nWhat about minimized applications or applications with no windows?\n(Xcode, for example, after I've closed all its open windows)\n\n*When I press F9, I can see all windows\nThis includes minimized windows at the bottom, but not hidden windows\n\n*Hidden versus minimized windows and application creates confusion\n\n*If someone wants to switch, they can:\n\n\n*\n\n*F11 to view the desktop\n\n*F9 to view all opened windows (except for hidden windows)\n\n*F8 to switch Spaces (if multiple Spaces are active)\n\n*⌘-tab for all applications\n\n*⌘-H to hide an application\n\n*⌘-M to minimize a window\n\n*⌘-` to switch between multiple windows of one application\n\n\n\nI face a lot of confusion while switching. I have to keep many things in mind, such as whether it is a window or an application.\nIn short: What do you do when you want to switch? And what's the simplest way to get familiar with how OS X handles opened windows and applications?\n\nA: Let’s reply in parts (as Jack The Ripper may say).\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘ cmd + Tab is effectively for switching between applications but not windows of an application.\n\n*⌘ cmd + ` does the window part. \n\n\nSo far, so good. \nWhy do we have Minimize and Hide?\nAt first they tend to be very confusing, especially because the hide part is rather new to people coming from other Operating Systems. Windows only has minimize. \nIt is confusing but the reason for both becomes apparent when you analyze the limitations of each. Independently of the particular implementation that OS X does for handling with this situations, there’s a reason for each. \nHide\n⌘ cmd + H will effectively hide most of the applications (and I say most because there are some notable exceptions out there). You will want to hide an application when you want to get it out of the way, completely, in all its forms, windows, and palettes. There will be two traces of the application after it has been hidden. It will be on the Dock with a dot (where you can click to perform the usual dock’s magic) and it will be once in ⌘ cmd + Tab regardless of the number of windows/palettes/etc.\nSo in conclusion, hide is an all-or-nothing mode. If you have a multi-document application (e.g.: Pages) with a few documents open (each in its own window), and you want to not see all of them at the same time, Hide is the way to go. It disappears. Until you bring it back, again, all of it. It also doesn’t show in Exposé, so you can’t find it there. You’ve hidden it. \nMinimize\n⌘ cmd + M will perform an old trick and will send the current window to the dock. In older OS X versions, there was a dedicated space (next to the trashcan) for these minimized windows. Snow Leopard changed (for better in my opinion) the way this works, and now you can see them in Exposé or when clicking (and holding) on the application icon in the Dock. This subtle distinction is the first important difference, as hidden apps are invisible to Exposé (except when you click on the Dock’s Icon, exposé will show all the windows, separating the minimized ones in the lower portion, but you can still see the ones that were open before you hide the whole application).\nYou want to use Minimize when —following the above example with Pages— you have this Application with three windows (Pages Docs) and you want to hide one of the documents, but not all of them. Minimize it, and it will go to the Dock, but you can still work on the other documents you have open. \nBut what about Applications with one Window?\nWell, here’s where things get “gray”. Technically, unless you really like Minimize (or have any other reason), hide should be the way to get rid of that Application. Minimize is more clumsy and harder to bring back without the mouse, but hidden windows do not show up in Exposé, so you really have to decide.\nOk, I know I minimized something, how do I bring it back without the mouse?\nThat’s a tricky one since the age of Panther (OS X 10.3). Perform this simple test. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open TextEdit and create 3 new documents (windows). You have now 3 editor screens right in front of you. \n\n*⌘ cmd + M one of them, and watch it go to the Dock. \n\n*Now use ⌘ cmd + ` and see you can only switch between the two windows.\n\n*⌘ cmd + H in either Window, hides all the TextEdit windows. It no longer shows in Exposé… wait… the Minimized windows do show! \n\n\nLet’s get real… really, how do I bring it back?!\nTechnique Number One:\nUse Exposé. You can type the name of the window while expose is activated (or use the arrow keys) to select a window, including the minimized ones.\nTechnique Number Two: (this one is trickier)\n⌘ cmd + Tab until you have TextEdit selected but don’t release ⌘ cmd, instead press ⌥ alt (both at the same time now) and release them together. It’s hard. \nNow this doesn’t always work (especially if the Application has multiple windows open and you have switched a few times away), so the best way to bring minimized apps back is Expose.\nEnough trickery, how do we deal with this?\nThis is subjective and a matter of personal preference, and I didn’t even include Spaces in the mix, that would have make it more interesting… all these window handling mechanisms are confusing and have gotten more confusing with the newest additions to OS X. But it’s usable and you get used to it kind of fast. \nWhat I do is usually hide an application I don’t use. I don’t really use Spaces, I hide. If I happen to have a lot of windows of an application open, I start to minimize the ones that I really wish I could hide but I can’t because then I’ll lose the others (are you following me here?). So the key for me is Hide as much as possible. Only minimize when more than one Window within the same application and I want to keep at least one visible. \nI have recently started using HyperDock (still Beta and Free) and I like the Window 7 approach to the Dock (and the fact that It can show all safari tabs as “windows”). So I’ll be likely getting that. I don’t use the Mouse that much, but that’s a nice addition for when I do. \nIn Mac, users tend to hide rather than Minimize, at least that’s my experience after spending years with other Mac users (mostly programmers and graphic designers). \nAs they say in Internet, ymmv. :)\n", "Q: Where to get iPhone app download statistics? I know this is a elementary question, but I figured I'd get a quicker answer here than Apple support. Where can I find out how many times the app has been downloaded and other download stats? I'm a developer and can't find the stats on the iOS Dev Center. I have not renewed the $99 Developer license, so could it be hidden because of that?\n\nA: If it is the application you developed, you can access it from itunesconnect.apple.com which is called iTunes Connect, and that's how you should have uploaded your app to Apple in the first place. \nYou can also try a piece of software called AppFigures, which is essentially a portal to iTunes Connect, which I find easier to use and with more features.\nAlso: after not renewing your iPhone Developer licence, your apps will stay in iTunes Connect for some period of time, probably around a year before being deleted.\n\nA: \"The App\". Your app? Any app?\nYou cannot find out how many times any arbitrary app has been downloaded.\nYour own apps, yes. With an in-good-standing (paid up) developer account, you will be able to access iTunes Connect, which offers some download metrics, going back thirteen weeks into the past.\n", "Q: How can I mount SFTP/SSH in Finder on OS X Snow Leopard? My Question is seemingly simple. I need to mount an SSH/SFTP volume and make it visible in finder to be able to use it as if it were a local volume (think SMB share). I have tried everything I could find (MacFUSE + sshfs (whatever version), Macfusion (couldn't install),...).\nIs there anyway to do this seemingly simple thing? It feels like I'm missing something here. Also, I'm not looking for an SFTP client for download/upload. My personal machine is an Ubuntu box, and that's easily doable on that.\n\nA: As of March 2013, the current free software solution is macFUSE plus a package for SSHFS (a download link on Fuse for OS X webpage).\nMacfusion is a GUI for easy mounting/unmounting remote shares but it needs to be patched to work with SSHFS/Fuse for OS X.\n\nA: Well, MacFusion was going to be my answer but since you've tried that I'll recommend my second favourite app when it comes to mounting shares: Panic's Transmit. It's new, very awesome, feature lets you mount any share that it can connect to in the UI as a \"disk\" in your Finder that you can drag files to. SFTP, SSH, S3...very cool.\n\nA: The best solution I've found today (2017) is to use Homebrew and Cask to install osxfuse and sshfs. Note that Homebrew core deprecated all FUSE-related formulae in 2020 so you need to install sshfs from a tap:\nbrew install --cask macfuse\nbrew install gromgit/fuse/sshfs-mac\n\nAnd then:\nsshfs username@hostname:/remote/directory/path /local/mount/point -ovolname=NAME\n\nIt works! :-)\n\nA: I use Cyberduck for this task. It's a cross-platform (but native on mac) app that is full of features and it's free to use. You can support the developers by donating or buying it directly from the Mac App Store.\nThe developer also has an application named Mountainduck which let you mount the path you want to a folder and access it through Finder app.\n\nA: Best ones that you can use are Transmit, like has been said before, or Expandrive, which is probably more like what you're looking for, as finder integration is its main feature.\n\nA: Another solution is WebDrive (35$+). I successfully used the Windows version of the same product, so I expect the same from the OS X version. Too bad, that they require you to buy separate licenses for Windows and OS X.\n\nA: If you already have FUSE for OS X installed (e.g. you got it directly from SourceForge), then @eskatos solution can reduced to just installing sshfs instead of the whole cask which includes FUSE.  You can do this by using:  \nbrew install homebrew/fuse/sshfs\n\nYou might want to check if you have the latest version of FUSE for OS X through your System Preferences while you're at it.\n\nA: Given I cannot comment, I'll add to this answer that if you want to unmount the recently mounted sshfs disk, you need to execute:\numount <MOUNTPOINT>\n\nThe sshfs man page states that you should do fusermount -u <MOUNTPOINT> but that command doesn't exist in macOS\n\nA: Just in case you are having problems unmounting the disk, you can unmount it simply writing\numount ~/mounted/folder\n\nhope it saves some headache to someone else\n\nA: I use Filezilla, its free, connect as sftp.\n\nA: ExpanDrive is a commercial version with an outrageous $50 price tag, but is very clean and slick. \nIt also mounts Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, Amazon S3, OwnCloud folders, plus a bunch more and supports ssh keys and sftp. \n\nA: You can download CloudMounter from the Mac App Store.\nThis app, permit virtual mount units like, GoogleDrive, DropBox, S3, SFTP, FTP, etc.\n", "Q: Backup Mail.app Quick question. I'm reinstalling Snow Leopard, and am not sure how to back up my Mail. It is all done solely in Mail.app, so is there a folder I can just back up and have Mail 'rediscover' after I load the fresh install?\n\nA: You can copy the folder \"Mail\" in the folder \"Library\" in your Home Folder (~/Library/Mail) and put it back in the same place whenever you want.\nand according to Apple Support Center:\n*  To back up Mail preferences and messages:\n\n  Note: These steps back up Mail preferences, but do not back up Mail messages (emails), although you can do that with the .Mac Backup utility. See below if you want to manually back up Mail messages (mailboxes).\n     1. Create a uniquely-named folder on your desktop (or other favorite location). For example, you might call it \"Mail Prefs Backups May_15_2005\" (adding a date is a good idea).\n     2. Quit Mail if it's running.\n     3. In the Finder choose Home from the Go menu.\n     4. Open the Library folder.\n     5. Open the Preferences folder.\n     6. Copy the \"com.apple.mail.plist\" file to the folder you made in step 1 by Option-dragging the file. Don't remove the original file from its current location (this file contains your Mail accounts information).\n     7. Close the Preferences folder.\n     8. Open the Mail folder.\n     9. Copy the \"MessageRules.plist\" file to the folder you made in step 1 by Option-dragging the file (this file contains your Mail rules).\n    10. Copy the \"SmartMailboxes.plist\" file to the folder you made in step 1 by Option-dragging the file (you guessed it, this file contains Smart Mailboxes information).\n    11. Finally, copy the Signatures folder to the folder you made in step 1 by Option-dragging the folder. (Your custom signatures, if you use them, are stored here.)\n* To restore:\n\n  Move all copies of the files and folders from your uniquely-named folder to the original locations from which they came, as listed above.\n\n\nA: Unless you've gone and changed something, the emails themselves are in ~/Library/Mail/ with attachments in ~/Library/Mail Downloads/. You email settings are in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist and ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.searchhistory.plist. Your passwords are stored in the keychain, normally ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain.\nSo, if you backup your home folder you should be good to go. This should be generally true, especially if you follow recommended practices and don't store any personal documents or files anywhere but in your home folder. Everything else you should be able to reinstall the software (system or otherwise) to get back.\n", "Q: saving login information on iPhone Is there a good app to store login information to various sites and services on my iPhone?\n\nA: I like 1Password.\n\nA: I like LastPass.

Am I doing something wrong, or do 1st generation iPhones require particular headphones? My white iPod headphones work, but most of my other ones wont fit? Is the standard solution to purchase an adapter?\n\nA: Do you have an original (aluminum backed) iPhone? If so then yes, unfortunately Apple recessed the headphone jack and you do need an extender. If you have an iPhone 3G, 3GS, or 4, then you shouldn't need to, as the headphone jack is flush with the device.\n", "Q: How can I reset my iPhone 1 without using the (broken) power button? The power button on my first-gen iPhone is broken. I remember last time I came across this problem I found a utility (for windows) which caused the phone to reset to enter restore mode (the one with the yellow alert symbol), but I can't for the life of me find it again. Does anyone know what it is?\nThanks for any help,\nWyatt.\n\nA: I don't know about the yellow alert symbol, but a quick google for \"iphone recovery mode utility\" revealed RecBoot, which looks like exactly what you're looking for.\nAlso, Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings should restart your iPhone.\n", "Q: Using international phone numbers on iPhone edit: 1 accepted answer but still no (good) solution! :(\n\n\n*\n\n*In my previous phone carrier I could just dial +55 11 99883655 and it would just work.\n\n*Now I moved to a new carrier and it doesn't work anymore! When I dial the same international number it keeps saying the number isn't formatted correctly.\nHow can I get my iPhone to understand international numbering back again?\nI've got over 100 contacts with numbers stored in this format already, and I want to keep them that way.\nAt this point I would be happy with any simple app that would just enable me to use my stored info the way it is to strip the +5511 part and place a call. Or some tweaking to allow proper and simple editing of the phone number on Phone.app would be very welcomed!\n\nA: You are in Brazil (so am I), so you can't just dial the \"+\" in front of the country code. You need to dial \"00\" and the CSP (the long distance operator code).\nWhat happens is that some operators (Oi and Claro, for sure) have a JavaCard application in the SIM card that intercepts every call you place and before send the dialed number to the network verifies if you are in a situation that you should need to add a CSP or not, and adds the operators own CSP in that case, if there isn't one in the dialed number.\nSo, for example, if I'm in Rio (area code 21) and dial a call to (24) 9999-8888, which is a long distance call, the application will add \"0\"+  to my number. The same if I'm in Petrópolis (area code 24), since my MSISDN is from Rio.\nOn the other side, if I register my phone numbers using the international notation, the application is smart enough to remove the \"+\" and the country code and add the \"0\" and the CSP, unless it realizes that you're roaming abroad.\nBesides Oi and Claro, I would guess that Vivo also uses an application like that, since it buys SIM cards from the same manufacturers. \nTIM has a different application in their SIM cards that modifies the phone numbers in your SIM card to add the CSP 41. It is a lame solution and I regret every time I have to use a TIM mobile.\nIf it is enough for you to have an application like TIM's, there are at least two in the brazilian App Store that will edit the iPhone's Address Book:\n\n\n*\n\n*[Minha Operadora](http://itunes.apple.com/br/app/minha-operadora/id401640256?mt=8)\n\n*[DDD Fácil](http://itunes.apple.com/br/app/ddd-facil/id381994693?mt=8)\n\n\nI haven't tested either, so I can't offer advice on how well they work.\nOtherwise, you will probably have to go back to an operator that offer that application in the SIM card (there is no way for a user to add apps to their SIM card by themselves).\n\nA: Usually adding two 0 at the beginning works. For example: 0055 11 99883655\n", "Q: Software (not app) To Read Underlying iPhone Data About a year ago I came across a piece of software that was around $30 that said it could read the underlying data in an iPhone.  I bookmarked it and still I cant find it.  It said it could read and export any of the Notes, SMS Text Messages, Call History, etc.  Essentially, if it was on the iPhone it could get to it.\nDoes anyone recall seeing such software?  Its not an App.  This is installable software and it ran on the PC and Mac.  I've got both so if anyone knows of anything else then I'm open to investigating that too. Its for the iPhone 3G.\n\nA: I don't think there's any software that can do it without jailbreaking the device.\niPhone Explorer is free software for Mac and PC that allows you to browse many files and folders without jailbreaking. If you do jailbreak it is also supposed to let you get at MS messages, call history, etc.\nI've not used with with a jailbroken device, but can attest that it works reasonably well in its normal mode (it seems to not work as well with iOS 4.2, though you can still browse and such).\n\nA: you can use iFun-box to have an access to iPhone filesystem from your PC. \nAFAIK, it doesnt need a jailbreak. \n\nA: Try PhoneView, it does what you said and doesn't need jailbreak.\n", "Q: Mystery Box in Expose (or what I think is expose) For some reason I have a mystery box when I go to expose (or w/e f3 is).  It'll show my other open apps, but once space will be transparent until I mouseover it.\nIt isn't horrible, but annoying so any help would be great.\nThanks\n\nA: If it's not the web browser, and you're sure you've quitted it (I'm sure you know on a Mac closing the window doesn't usually quit the application), then try this when you see another floating window:\n\n\n*\n\n*Search Spotlight for Activity Monitor\n\n*Change the drop down menu to Active Processes or if not available choose My Processes\n\n*Sort by Real Memory Usage\n\n*File>Print the list and post it somewhere where we can see it\n\n\nThat will tell you every application and active daemon that is running actively so that we can check if anything is out of the ordinary. \n\nA: I think I had that problem and I believe Firefox was the culprit.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to reproduce this bug with only Firefox open.\n\n*Try to temporarily switch to Safari or Chrome and see if it still happens. And while you're there, never switch back to Firefox since those two are so much better ;) \n\n\nCan you list your open apps next time it happens? And the times after too. You can also list the menubar app.\n\nA: Some websites create a temporary invisible window using Javascript that they can use as a timer or something else that can be referenced globally from any page on their site. It's an old technique and usually, because the \"window\" has no profile, it cannot be detected (no taskbar item on Windows) except by exposé which shows all windows. \nThere really isn't a way to stop it except restart your browser and not navigate to that site again.\n", "Q: directory location of sync files?

So..to what directory does the Itune download purchased application from my iPad?\nand..is there an option to prevent iTune from downloading apps from my iPad to sync?\n\nA: For the first question, I think its actually stored under C:\\Users\\username\\My Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Media\\, if everything is standard. If anything, it will be wherever your music is also stored (just in another directory). \nAs for your second question, I don't think you can tell it not to sync the apps. The only ways to not keep them would be to delete off your iPad before sync, or delete from the file system after sync. \n", "Q: Can I record a phone call on an iPhone? Nothing more to say than \"Is there an app to record the current phone call ?\" :-)\n\nA: Beware of legal issues.\nYou can but you'll need to jailbreak, use extra hardware (plug a mic into the headphone jack), or use 3rd party SIP software. For example, Google Voice has an iPhone app, and Google Voice supports call recording. Google Voice does announce to both parties that it is recording the call.\n\nA: As far as I know 3rd-party, Apple-sanctioned apps - ones you'd find in the App Store, jailbroken apps notwithstanding - do not have access to the phone beyond dialing.  In other words you won't find anything in the App Store.\n\nA: The best way is to have Google voice account and download there app.\n", "Q: iPhone app to point me back to a waypoint (like a computer game) I'm looking for an app which I can use to find my camper in the desert after going for a walk, or find the b&b i left my bags in after exploring a new city. I'm hoping for something really simple which just points in the right direction and perhaps tells me a distance, like your next target on a computer game. I'm imagining opening a compass and clicking a button to record a place then having a needle pointing north and another arrow point back to the waypoint.\nDoes this exist?\n\nA: Motion-X GPS Lite is free, and lets you set waypoints and navigate back to them.

Is there a way to retain a map with as much detail as possible (street view, maps, directions, zoom levels) offline? \nThis question refers to the Apple maps program that shipped with iOS versions 1 to 5 that relied on google map tiles. Please open a new question for iOS 6 maps and the google map app that is also available on the App Store since 2012.\n\nA: Without jailbreaking, the iPhone DOES cache the last few map tiles on the view, at all the view zoom levels. I'm not sure how extensive this is, and because it's only a temporary cache the data is always a second away from deletion. \nWithout jailbreaking, you can download an application, there are lots of them, but my favorite is called MotionX GPS, which is on the App Store. It allows you to cache and save certain types of map tiles from a variety of map modes, including Terrain, roads, and more. I'm not sure if they're specifically Google Maps, but you can get some types of maps for sure.\nAfter jailbreaking, which is both legal and easy, you can find a couple of 3rd party utilities to help you download map tiles to the device, but most of them require you to view the tiles in the app itself, not in the Maps application. \n\nA: Yes there is, but to do it properly requires a jailbreak (legal, voids warranty) and a possible breaking of the Google Maps TOS.\nThe cache can be used to an extent: The Google Maps application uses its cache offline, so tiles are visible and the map can be panned a bit (if it was panned while online and could fetch neighboring tiles). Directions are retained in the list view even if you can't follow them all in map view.\nIf you want more than this, it isn't built in by default. If you jailbreak, you could hack it to have a much larger cache that supports hundreds of MB of content including zoom levels, etc.\nSetting it up would be a significant hack and against the Google Maps TOS. When online, you'd need to sniff your own packets off the iPhone, detect those involving Google Maps, and build a cache. When offline, you'll want to redirect all requests to Google Maps servers to a local HTTP server running on the iPhone, and then serve the tiles. \nI've seen this done with a computer that was frequently offline, but not with an iPhone, but it should work just fine. You can also add custom tile layers this way if you want.\n\nA: Another method does not involve as much hacking. It seems some people have already solved this problem. You do need to jailbreak, and directions will not work, but browsing at different zoom levels should work, and GPS works too, so you at least know where you are.\nSee the following sites:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://iphonenodata.com/site/offline-maps/\n\n*http://joesonic.com/blog/2008/04/14/google-maps-offline-for-iphone/\n\n*http://iphonefreakz.com/2008/04/12/save-google-maps-with-maps-offline-for-later-viewing/\n\nA: I use CityMaps2Go for offline maps.  Not quite the same as Google Maps, but pretty good for my use.  I live in a relatively low-population area, so there wasn't a map available for my area at first, but they added it within a few days of my requesting it.\n\nA: The application Atomic Web Browser can save a static copy of a Google Map page locally.  The saved page cannot be scrolled or zoomed, but it is available offline.  I tested with Airplane Mode on version 4.0.2.\n\nA: This may not satisfy all of the criteria, but there are a handful of humongous (in terms of file size) applications that have map data stored locally. Think traditional GPSes with screens that have to have this data stored locally.\nXROAD, Inc. has US West and US East apps that offer navigation features, and have map data stored in the application, so you may look them up offline, manually, or online with automatic triangulation. Note that these ARE NOT Google Maps. Per mankoff, Google's TOS prevents any other company from offering turn-by-turn on their map data (less current agreements with Apple and the like).\niTunes App Links:\nXROAD US West\nXROAD US East\nThere is very likely more if you look around, these are just the two that I've been shown before should I ever need to travel in a place with uncertain coverage.\n\nA: The iOS map app will cache tiles for as long as it can. In practice, my iPad will cache tiles for a turn by turn trip across the country and generally not lose any of the tiles when playing light games, reading books, etc... It's not foolproof, but the less you do with the device, the longer your tiles stay in memory. \nGoogle's tiles are not generally licensed for offline use. They do have an excellent static map API that might suit your needs but you'll have to find another app that allows more control over pre-loading map tiles for true offline use. The iOS map app simply doesn't do what you ask. \n\nA: I recommend OpenMaps - which uses OpenStreetMaps for map data. Simple to use, you can download the needed map area at any or all zoom levels.\n\nBrowse the maps of OpenStreetMap, download them for offline use, edit the maps (tag editing and node creation), find out where you are, search for addresses, get directions and scan the map for tweets with OpenMaps for iPhone, iPad an iPod touch.\n\n\nA: For offline maps, I use Offmaps, the old version. The map display is much faster than of City Maps 2Go, and my personal opinion is that it also feels much more like a iOS app should feel like. So even though Offmaps has no working compass, cost more money, can’t download in the background and I had downloaded CityMaps for free, I stick with Offmaps.\n(Developer Felix Lamouroux has released a rather misleadingly-named new version some time ago, which is a different thing altogether — more a city guide with Points of Interest and maps.)\n\nA: I've installed on ipad galileo-offline-maps, and it keeps available previously opened maps when offline.\n\nA: As others have noted, you can't easily do it with Google Maps on a standard handset. What you can do is use another source of maps. There are a number of apps that use OpenStreetMap that allow you to download maps in advance. The one I used, oMaps, downloads data a different levels of detail so you can zoom in and out.\nThe maps are a little variable in quality but undoubtedly better than having no map at all.\n\nA: I use the GaiaGPS App for my walks. This is free and does the job. You can save maps and use them once you're on the spot without any connexions. And you can zoom! No need to say that this don't cover Street View, because of the size needed for this kind of feature.\n", "Q: history of version / price changes for itunes apps I'm looking to get \"app activity\" type information from pages like these. http://appshopper.com/social-networking/tweetee\nonly that I want to be able to get such information via \"Appid\" that apple used for each app on the appstore. anyone have any ideas on how I might do that?\n\nA: AppShopper does this.

I have it currently on my iPhone 4. It's untethered for last-gen devices, but for the iPhone 4 it's a tethered jailbreak, which means that you'll have to connect it to your computer and use the program (redsn0w) to turn on the phone every time the phone gets turned off or looses power. \nIf you don't turn off your phone a lot, then it's not big issue, though. And because you have a 3GS, you'll be untethered anyway.\nThe jailbreak is at http://blog.iphone-dev.org which is the iPhone Dev Team, the MOST reputable source for iPhone jailbreaking. These are the actual people who do the work (or compile it from Geohot). DO NOT trust any info from places like BigBoss, RedmondPie, UltraPWN, or anyone else.\n\nA: It is possible and it includes unlock. All you need is a simple tutorial, Redsn0w and the correspondent firmware. Unless of course you prefer to go the \"official\" way. I did it with iPhone 3G and the first tutorial.\nThe 3Gs got is the only device that marks the bootrom change. Basically all \"i devices\" are only able to get a (bad) tethered jailbreak if they're launched after a given point. Here's a long guide with steps on how to check your bootrom to see if you're lucky or not. I'll summarize it for both mac and PC:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put your iPhone in DFU mode (not recovery mode):\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your computer.\n\n*Turn iPhone off.\n\n*Start iTunes.\n\n*Hold Power and Home buttons together for 10 seconds or so.\n\n*Release Power button but keep holding the Home button until your computer recognizes a new USB device.\n\n*iTunes will now recognize your iPhone.\n\n\n\nNote: Your iPhone screen at this time should be blank (black in color), if not, then you are most likely in Recovery Mode, not DFU mode.\n\n\n*Locate the value [iBoot-359.3] or something alike under System Profiler (mac) or Device Manager (win). Keywords are: USB and Apple Mobile Device (DFU Mode).\n\n*If the value after iBoot is 359.3 or lower, that's the old bootrom. Yippie!\nIf it's 359.3.2 or higher, tough luck you're stuck with new bootrom and lame tethered jailbreak.\n", "Q: Keep iPhone Screen On (when plugged in) Is there an app (normal, jailbreak) that will keep my iPhone (3GS, OS 4.x) screen on, indefinitely, when it is plugged in, regardless of what app is running in the foreground?\n\nA: The have moved the Auto-Lock option from General in iOS 10 (and possibly above):\nSettings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock\n\nA: An unexplained downvote brought to my attention this old post, so I decided to update it.\nI don't have an iPhone any longer, but my iPad screen simply stays on, whenever plugged in or not, if my setting to Auto Lock is set to Never. On iOS 7+ it is that simple.\n\nNow, if you want to automatically change it back (which is a completely different question), once you plug it out, you'll need to jailbreak. But since it's complicated and I haven't tried, I'll just give one pointer that seems to do it: get Tasker (found on lifehacker).\nI personally rather just manually switch it on and off, until apple decides to have some kind of NFC. It should be just around the corner, if not with NFC, then with iBeacon.\nOld answer (jailbreak only, iOS 4 or less)\nFirst, I just tried on my iphone and even calculator stays active after 1 minute, even if the screen dims out. So maybe your question is really just about keeping the screen on.\nAnyway, I can think of two solutions: kirikae with backgrounder might do the trick as a side effect. If not, you can use SBSettings with Autolock toggle to do it manually and temporarily set the auto-lock to never. All of them you should find in Cydia.\nedit: as none of the above actually worked, here's some update.\nSome custom toggles on SBSettings seem to just not work indeed. It's probably due to getting outdated or conflicting with something else, two common problems we find on cydia apps. BigBoss is kind of similar to SBSettings and also have an Autolock toggle. You could use it along with some multitasking, leave it on the background and use it as needed. It hardly have any conflicting issue.\nUnfortunately I can't find many more ideas to this.\nOnly thing I can assure you is that I just tried SBSettings's Autolock toggle on my iOS 3.1.3 and it works. It also says it's updated to 4, so most likely it's either problem with 4.1 or conflicting with something else you've got installed. And believe me, there are conflicts from the least expected things (look at the comments).\n\nA: I use iTunes.  As long as you have a song playing the screen will dim, but it won't go black and it won't lock.  If you don't want to have music playing you can download a track that's just silence, then put it on repeat.\nEDIT: I should note that my IOS version is 7.1.0 - can't make any promises about other versions...\nEDIT: I should also note that the behavior described above only applies when the phone is on external power, that is, iTunes will not keep the phone unlocked when on battery power.\n\nA: The Gentle Alarm keeps the screen active when it is plugged in, but I guess that is a feature that each app has to implement, not something that you install to keep the screen active for all apps.\n\nA: I use Kensington's Nightstand every night. Sure beats having a separate alarm clock by the bed. And no, you don't actually have to use (or even own) their charger.\n", "Q: Customizing OS X Finder toolbar How is it possible to customize toolbar of Finder and to add more buttons other than defaults ?\n\nA: Which kind of buttons are you talking about?\nIf you want to customize your toolbar by adding or removing existing buttons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click in the Finder toolbar and select Customize Toolbar… from the context menu\n\n*Drag the buttons you want in or out, and place them where you want them.\n\n*Click Done.\n\n\n[This also works for most apps, btw.]\nIf you want to add new buttons that aren't shipped by Apple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Just drag them into the toolbar.\n\n\nFor example, I've used Refresh Finder for years (Macworld review).\n\nA: In case it wasn't already clear, you can also drag folders or files to the toolbar:\nHmm, can't post image, so you will have to use your imagination :-(\nOr wait, nm, they just can't be inline:\n[EDIT] okay, now it can be inline\n\nI started using OS X back in 10.1, well before the sidebar came out, so that's the way I used to get around. To add these, drag the item to the toolbar (when you're not running the toolbar customization sheet. Adding a separator bar from the customization sheet will make dragging things to the toolbar easier (aim for the divider, then the Finder will know you want to add the item to the toolbar, rather than, say, copy the item to your Applications folder).\nA couple of other tips if you weren't already aware of these. Hold down Command-Option and click on the toggle-toolbar button (the oblong button in the upper right) to immediately invoke the customization sheet.\nYou can also hold down the Command key to allow manipulation of the toolbar items without having to use the customization sheet. For example, if I no longer want my Apps folder in the toolbar, hold down Command and drag it out of the toolbar and release, and it will poof \nlike when you remove an app from the Dock. Or, you can hold down the Command key and drag the toolbar items to the left or right to rearrange them.\nAlso, hold down the Command key and press the toggle-toolbar button to cycle through the different toolbar viewing modes (for example, text or icons, and large or small size, etc.). \n", "Q: Make QuickTime player ignore mouse gestures and touches I like my Magic Mouse, but I often touch it \"incorrectly\" while watching a movie in QuickTime Player, and QTP then moves the video position forward or backwards or makes a pause or ... .

What's the best application to open and edit a plist file ?\n\nA: If the plist file is in the XML format, you can edit it in any text editor like TextEdit. If the plist file is in the binary format, you can convert it to XML first by running:\nplutil -convert xml1 file.plist\n\nIf you want to go back to binary format after editing:\nplutil -convert binary1 file.plist\n\nIf you have Xcode 4.3 or later, you can use it to edit property lists in a graphical editor like this:\n\nXcode 4.2 and earlier came with a separate application for editing property lists (/Developer/Applications/Utilities/Property List Editor.app/).\n\nA: A fine program like TextWrangler can edit binary .plist files without first converting them using Terminal. Simply open the file like you would any other (i.e. drag-and-drop on the program icon, or the File open dialog, or Open With in the Finder or...)\n\nA: Since Apple got rid of the GUI Property List Editor, Xcode is the best free option if you want to be sure of the result.\nThere are some gotcha's using a generic code editor to edit plist files.  Since dictionaries use entries like\n<key>some key</key>\n<string>some value</string>\n<key>another key with boolean value</key>\n<true />\n\nYou can create a valid XML file that is not a valid plist file, for example:\n<key>some key</key>\n<!-- oops, forgot to enter a value - still valid XML -->\n\n<!-- valid XML, not a plist -->\n<key>another key with boolean value</key>\n<true>yes</true>\n\nIf you're willing to go commercial, Plistinator will edit both binary and XML plist files.  \nFull-disclosure: I'm the author of Plistinator and the $12.99 it costs pays for my ramen and rent.\n\nA: Free Visual Studio Code editor can open, edit and save plist files in binary format with the help of the Binary Plist extension:\n\nA Visual Studio Code extension that enables editing of binary property list files as XML. It is inspired by the BinaryPlist Sublime Text package, although the experience is not as seamless (the user must agree to opening a binary file and the editing takes place in an additional tab). A virtual file system is used to achieve this using the FileSystemProvider API.\nThe extension is cross-platform but primarily uses the macOS plutil binary for conversion, the Python plistlib is used as an alterntative if available. The node package simple-plist is used as a fallback but due to JavaScript not having a float type real values that are whole numbers will be cast to integer types (a warning dialog is shown first).\n\n\nA: On a Terminal window, you can use PlistBuddy, available at /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy.\nPlistBuddy can read and modify values inside of a plist, either interactively or directly on the command line.\nHowever, PlistBuddy is not a GUI editor.\nUsage examples:\n# Show full help\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -h\n\n# Print content of plist\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c print /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist\n\n# Print selected content of plist\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'print SkipPaths' /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist\n\n\nA: A PList file, like Mankoff said, is just a specially formatted XML file, so you can actually edit and create them in a program like TextEdit.\nBecause of the specific nature of PLists to Development, however, using a special program like Xcode or Property List Editor becomes a much more fruitful endeavor. This is because it not only automatically formats the XML code for you, but it will actually translate the key identifiers and layers into readable words, and also for some values it will provide a drop-down menu to fill in the correct responses. Especially when dealing with iPhone plists, when multiple runtime variables can be set using the Plist, easily creating new fields and knowing what to put in them makes it so much easier.\nYou can get both Xcode and PList Editor from the Apple Developer website for free by downloading the latest Xcode release.\n\nA: I have used PlistEdit Pro for macOS and found it to be useful and comprehensively feature rich.\n\nA: BBEdit will open plist files for editing, and do any necessary conversion of file types.\nIt will also handle file permission access, if needed.\nYou can also do things like create Text Filters to do things like encode/decode base64 encoding.\nIt's the essential text editor for Mac.

Acro's SoftPhone does support the VoIP backgrounding, and even push, so you can \"Swipe To Answer\", but it still takes at least a couple seconds to do. (At least that's how it feels, comparatively speaking.)\nInternational Number Support: I think this is not so much a client feature as much as it is a feature of your server you SIP register to. This one is unknown to me as I've never attempted to call an international (outside the US) number.\nAllow Recording: Yes. Upon tapping the record button, a voice announcement is played, and then conversation is recorded and able to be replayed from the app.\nSkype: Nope\nGoogle Voice: Yep, but to what extent, I am unsure. Per their website:\n\nGoogleVoice users:  Though we have integrated GoogleVoice, Acrobits Softphone's main use is as a SIP client.  You can setup Acrobits Softphone to initiate GoogleVoice calls through other types of numbers, but to get the full functionality of Acrobits Softphone, you need to have GoogleVoice linked to a SIP Account.\n\nRest: If it's SIP, it should work.\nBonus: It supports ZRTP. Zimmerman's encrypted RTP protocol for SIP calls. Free for incoming calls, in-app purchase for initiating calls using it.\niTunes Link: Acrobits Softphone.\n\nA: After some problems getting DTMF to work I tried WeePhone with some success.\n\nA: I just tried several free softphones and I liked Zoiper the best, but since our Asterisk server is configured with very peculiar prefix rules I cannot use it. It supports native address book integration, call recording, various audio and video codes... pretty cool, if only it would allow custom rewriting rules :(\nAs strong second best I decided to use Join softphone. It does integrate with addressbook and allows complex rewrite rules. It promises that it does call recordings, but I could not get it to work properly. What really puts me off with Join is rather confusing UI with too many colors and drop shadows. It really does not work well on mobile screen. Maybe desktop but not small screen such as mobile. But it was only feature full free solution I've found.\n\nA: I use Smartgroshen app, simple, good quality of voice and sync with your phone contacts. Get 0.5 euro at start.\n\nA: General problems when using Softphone app are:\n1. Complex network conditions in mobile networks (i.e. NAT). Not all VoIP servers can properly work with NAT.\n2. Limited bandwidth. Is is impossible to use high nitrate codecs in 3G networks. But many operators does not support modern codecs like Opus.\n3. Problems with incoming calls. To receive calls phone must be connected to the server. It drains battery.\nThis is not ad, but try our solution:\nwww.sipmobile.org\nWe resolved this issues. You can use our Softphone in mobile 3G networks with good voice quality. If you have LTE or WiFi, video calls are available. Softphone for iOS can be switched off and receive calls with push notifications (of course only in our domain).\n\nA: Prefer Sipgo. It's probably the app with the lowest bandwidth usage. No useless extras, just sip calls.\n\nA: I confirm Smartgroschen is good app for cheap international calls, voip calls with good quality voice calls.\n", "Q: How can I get Time Machine to ignore the data created by Spotlight? I would like Time Machine to ignore the indexes and other metadata created by Spotlight, where are those kept on 10.6?\n\nA: On the root of each indexed volume, a hidden folder called .Spotlight-V100.\nAlso: spotlight metadata is probably not large enough to be worthwhile in excluding, at least if you are doing this for space reasons. Spotlight is also essential for TM to work properly, as this is how TM determines which files have changed since the last backup.\n\nA: The Spotlight index is automatically excluded from Time Machine backups (in /System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist, the PathsExcluded section lists /.Spotlight-V100).  However, as I understand it Time Machine then builds a new Spotlight index for the backup itself; I don't know of a way to prevent this being created.\n", "Q: Can I display only battery percentage in menu bar? I'd like to only display the percentage left in the menubar.  It seems that it is more useful than any other battery display option, but it isn't available.\nIs there a work-around?\n\nA: I recommend and use SlimBatteryMonitor (donation-ware). It's much more flexible than what Apple provides.\n\nA: Hmm.  This is a good little app.  A little on the pricey side though.  http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/\n\nA: Assuming you're talking about a Mac, and not an iPhone, iStat Menus 3 is a fantastic application that has a LOT of features, including the one you asked for. In addition to the battery, you can add info to your menu bar such as disk usage, network, internal temp. sensors, and more with graphs and detals. \nFor the battery part, upon clicking on the battery percentage instead of a useless menu you will be presented with information such as battery health, charge cycles, amperage, and cell charges and more, so for only $10 it's a worthwhile investment. \nOne of my favorite features is the date/time thing which actually shows you a drop down calendar and world clocks. Overall, iStat Menus is definitely worth the $10 lifetime investment. Plus, they give out copies on Twitter (@Bjangocodes and @Bjango) all the time.\n", "Q: Why doesn't my headset microphone work?  I got a SteelSeries headset for Christmas and I plugged it into my MacBook Pro. The audio output works fine, but I am having issues with the audio input.\nI saw this post which talked about some power issues to the microphone on the Mac Mini… I did not quite get what they were discussing, though.\nI also found this link which says:\n\nSome microphones require power on the stereo mini jack and may not work on Mac systems. Try to check for Mac compatibility when buying USB microphone sets. Unamplified PC microphones often won't work.\n\nThe SteelSeries FAQ says I need a USB sound card to use the microphone with a Mac.\nDoes this mean I can't use my headset because it needs power from the computer? If yes, is there a workaround?\nDoes anyone know of any VERY cheap sound cards?\nWhy doesn't my microphone work?\n\nA: On new Macbook Pros, there is no microphone input. What you have is a line-level input. Microphones that do not have integrated power and amplification (all cheap computer microphones/handsets) will not work when connected to the line-level input.\nThe connectors are exactly the same, but on the line input there is stereo input and ground, and on the microphone input there is mono input, voltage reference and ground. The input level is also different, with line level at around 1V and microphone level at 10-100mV.\nTo resolve the problem, you need to get one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*a USB sound card which has a proper microphone input circuitry,\n\n*a powered, amplified microphone that can be used with line-level input, or \n\n*a microphone preamplifier.\n\n\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.hobby-hour.com/electronics/computer_microphone.php\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_level\n\nA: As discussed in the \"Are there headset adapters usable for MacBook Pros?\" thread, new Macs DO have a normal Mic level input.  However it is combined with the headphone jack (not the \"audio in\" port).  You can purchase an adapter (such as the \"Headset Buddy\") that combines the headphone and mic into a single \"smart-phone\" style plug.\nNote that this will only work properly under Mac OS.  So if you intend to use your headset under Windows with BootCamp, you will want a USB adapter, such as the Griffin iMic instead.\n\nA: As I wrote in an answer to this question, you can buy third-party USB adapters which should work (emphasis on the should), such as this USB 2.0 Virtual 7.1 Channel Sound Card Adapter.\n", "Q: How do I get audio CD to open in iTunes for ripping?

I have the preferences set in iTunes to prompt to import an audio CD when it's inserted into the drive, and my System Preferences set to throw audio CDs over to iTunes, but whenever I put in an audio CD, it just starts playing (and not through iTunes).  I don't see any other players pop up w/ controls, either, and if iTunes isnt' already open, it doesn't open but I see the same behavior (i.e. music starts playing).  \nAny ideas of what I am missing?\n\nA: Can you use Expose to show all of the windows running? Have you tried with different CDs, to make sure it isn't one of those CDs that has an application on that just plays the music.\nI've just tested with the same settings as you (System preferences - Music CD, open iTunes and iTunes, Ask to import) and all it did was open iTunes.\nAnother possibility, have you got any other media player applications running?\n", "Q: Binding an AppleScript to a button in OS X I have asked a question here. But it is for adding a custom button in OS X Finder toolbar.\nSuppose I have an AppleScript and I want to bind it on a custom button. And then I want to place that button on a toolbar - how that would be possible ?\n\nA: You can drag and drop an AppleScript (script and application) to the Finder toolbar, which places the icon for the AppleScript in the toolbar just like any other button (though I prefer the menu bar's AppleScript menu for such things because I can have more scripts available in a smaller space). I don't think you can create a button out of nothing and bind an AppleScript to it, however.\n\nA: No, you can’t add a custom button to the Finder directly to an Applescript, because the Finder’s toolbar is not an “Application Launcher”. It is, however, possible to create a small app (using Xcode) that does that. Out of my mind, you can check ShellHere, which is a very simple application that puts a button in the Finder to “open a terminal here”. \nThe little app is Open Source, so you could see how he did it. It’s a very small project and if you have a little bit of Xcode/Cocoa experience, you’ll grasp the concept immediately.\n", "Q: Attaching 3.5\" desktop drive to MacBook SATA I have a mid-2007 MacBook that, according to the Apple Store, has suffered some liquid damage and requires a new logic board to operate correctly, a ~$750 repair I've been told (would normally be around ~$300 were it not for the \"liquid damage\"). The unit itself works fine - the only problem I've been having is that the system does not recognize the battery and will not charge it. Curiously, the system can still be powered by the battery and even recognizes when the power cord is detached by diming the backlight, but I digress.\nNow that this laptop will likely become a desktop, I'm wondering if it might be possible to attach a desktop drive. I recently purchased a 2TB SATA drive and I'm wondering if it's possible to somehow attach it where the current internal drive connects. Obviously the drive itself will not fit inside the device, but as the unit will spend the rest of its days on my desk, that's not really much of an issue.\nMy main questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this possible?\n\n*If so, how would I connect the drive? Would a SATA extender cable work?\n\n*Is the SATA port on my MacBook capable of powering a desktop drive? Or should I just get a SATA male-to-female cable and see if I can power the drive through other means (a cheap power supply, for example)\n\n\nThe disk I'm referring to is the Hitachi Deskstar HD32000. Though I couldn't find that exact model on Hitachi's support site, these are the power requirements for a similar drive, the 7K2000 (2TB, 7200RPM, SATA II):\n\nPower\nRequirement +5 VDC (+/-5%) +12 VDC (+/-10%)\nStartup current (A, max.) 1.2 (+5V), 2.0 (+12V)\nIdle (W) 7.5\n\nFrom what I've read, 2.5\" drives require 5V, meaning that my MacBook obviously is capable of producing it. The specs seem to suggest that this drive seems capable of accepting it instead of the typical 12V - is this an accurate interpretation of the power requirements? Or does it need both 12V and 5V?\n\nA: Just an update - I've successfully connected my 2TB HD to my MacBook's internal SATA data connector. If anyone's interested in doing this themselves, you'll need:\n\n\n*\n\n*external enclosure with eSATA to power the drive (I'm using a NexStar CX with eSata):\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*an eSATA to female SATA cable (I got mine from http://satacables.com, see \"eSATA DATA Cable Extension Male to Female\" near the bottom of the page):\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll need to cut those plastic tabs off the SATA portion of the cable, leaving only the section with the pins - otherwise, the cable won't fit in the port.\n\n*Follow iFixit's steps for removing the keyboard section of the MacBook \n\n*Remove the hard drive, connect cable. Since we had to remove the tabs on the cable in order to make the connection, the cable does not latch in place. I recomment taping the table to the bottom of the case where the hard drive was:\n\n\n*Reverse the disassembly steps to put the computer back together, with the exception of the memory cover and the battery. The cable should now poke out of the hole where the battery used to be.\n\n*Install the hard drive in the external enclosure, connect the eSATA and power cables, and enjoy.\n\n\nA: 1) Yes\n2) You have a couple options. You can use an external device such as this that will connect through USB, or you could connect the external SATA drive to the onboard SATA port. You would probably still need an external power source, but I can't find any links to back up that statement. (#3)\nGood luck!\n\nA: I've never done this but one thread I found has some ups and downs with some anecdotal evidence of frying a drive this way. I suppose looking into an external power supply would be best.\n\nA: FireWire 800 would be faster than USB, so I'd look into getting a FW800 enclosure. If it's a Pro model, you could use an expresscard esata adapter (I think the mid-2007's had those).\nLook at OWC's mercury elite external cases. They're expensive, but blazingly fast.. and they look cool. :)\n(EDIT: Whoops, did the mid-2007 macbooks have firewire 800? If not, my bad...)\n\nA: Okay, I've done a bit of looking on this one, because it got me interested.\nIt seems the connector for the sata HD is not really a cable but more of a port that the HD slides into(1). This makes me think your idea of a female to male adapter is a good one. However, I'd still grab an eSATA case, and get something like an eSATA to SATA Type (“I”) to Type (“L”) Shielded External Data Cable with a female->male sata cable for between that and the one inside the lappy. I wouldn't use the laptop's sata power lead to run a full size drive, and this would mean one instead of two cables coming out of the lappy. Make sure to tape it down well so an accidental yank won't pull it out.\nCheck that ifixit guide, they have really useful information if you didn't know about them.\n", "Q: What devices can receive an AirTunes signal? I'm trying to set up an in-home music system with built-in speakers. Right now I have my Apple TV plugged into the stereo outputting the AirTunes signal to the speakers. However, I'd like to get my Apple TV back at some point, so I've been looking into a replacement unit. The AirPort express and the Apple TV seem to be the only two devices that will seamlessly work with iTunes. New units cost $100, and even the used units command $50-$60 on eBay. It's also possible that I'd like to control several sets of speakers throughout the house, which would require several units for the different audio channels.\nAre there any other pieces of hardware that will perform this task? What about software solutions? I'm aware of Rogue Amoeba's Airfoil, but this doesn't work well with the Remote app for the iPhone, and plus it requires that the software be installed and configured on the streaming computer. Are there any other solutions?\n\nA: As far as I've been able to find, you've covered it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple TV\n\n*AirPort Express\n\n*Airfoil\n\n\nI'm not positive, but I thought that you can use AirTunes from one Mac to another if they were on the same Airport Express network. I don't have my Airport Express hooked up right now. I'll have to test it out later.\n\nA: Ken's got it covered; Airfoil nonwithstanding, you're stuck with either an AppleTV or an AirPort Express.\n(Sidebar: I have an AirPort Extreme, and it does not support AirTunes.  I didn't need it to when I bought mine, but I thought it did for some reason.)\nSo yeah, to do an AirTunes network \"right\", you need a seperate AirPort Express for each set of speakers in the house.  Then you can have iTunes running on your PC as the streaming source, and it all works great - the iPhone remote, speaker selection, etc.\nBut, of course, that costs a bajillion dollars at ~90 bucks a pop for the Express.  Too rich for my blood, certainly.\nI went with the PC, a bunch of speakers, a receiver, a big roll of speaker wire from monoprice.com, and a drill.  Sounds great.\n", "Q: Is it possible to hide the dock on a per-application basis? There's an app or two that I'd like to run fullscreen on my Mac. However, hiding the dock manually and unhiding it when I'm done gets tedious. I know there must be a way to get an application to hide the dock when it's active as iMovie 06 used to do exactly this. I also think that I read somewhere recently how to do it, but my search for the particular article comes up empty.\nHow can I get an app to hide the dock when it's active?\n\nA: This can be done, but you cannot hide just the dock per app. It will hide both the Dock and the Menu bar per app.\nYou just have to make a quick, simple edit to the plist file for the application. Check out this article from Mac OS X Hints:\n\nTo hack an app so that when it's active, the menubar and dock are hidden, you need to find its info.plist file. Control-click on the program in question, choose Show Package Contents from the pop-up menu, and then navigate into the Contents folder. \nOnce there, add the following to the file:\n<key>LSUIPresentationMode</key>\n<integer>4</integer>\n\nBe sure that it goes in alphabetical order, otherwise it won't work (i.e. LSUIPresentationMode goes after LSMinimumSystemVersion but before NSAppleScriptEnabled). Save the file and enjoy. \n\nYou can change the value (in the example, it is 4) to 0 - 4. Apple's documentation has more details:\n\nValue: 0\nNormal mode. In this mode, all standard system UI elements are visible. This is the default value.\nValue: 1\nContent suppressed mode. In this mode, system UI elements in the content area of the screen are hidden. UI elements may show themselves automatically in response to mouse movements or other user activity. For example, the Dock may show itself when the mouse moves into the Dock’s auto-show region.\nValue: 2\nContent hidden mode. In this mode, system UI elements in the content area of the screen are hidden and do not automatically show themselves in response to mouse movements or user activity.\nValue: 3\nAll hidden mode. In this mode, all UI elements are hidden, including the menu bar. Elements do not automatically show themselves in response to mouse movements or user activity.\nValue: 4\nAll suppressed mode. In this mode, all UI elements are hidden, including the menu bar. UI elements may show themselves automatically in response to mouse movements or other user activity. This option is available only in Mac OS X 10.3 and later.\n\n\nA: Is this Yosemite? \nYou could just click the green button in the top left corner that takes the app (most are supported) to full screen on a different desktop.  I often have several apps open (on several different desktops) in fullscreen at the same time and have mouse horizontal scroll enabled so that I can scroll between them with a quick simple mouse swipe.  No need to start hacking plist files with this method.  \n", "Q: What does it mean when a %CPU exceeds (# of cores) x 100%? Several responses to a question I asked earlier suggested I try Opera kiosk mode, so I decided to download it and give it a try. Once the download had completed and the disk image was being verified, Safari hung for over a minute and there were periods where Safari used a very high %CPU:\n\nIn Mac OS X 10.5, I was accustomed to seeing Safari freeze, but it never used up more than 200% CPU (2 cores x 100%). Is this a bug in Activity Monitor? Or does this mean that %CPU is now more akin to system load?\n\nA: The % CPU is relative to 1 core, so 726% is using almost 8 cores. Core is loosely defined, so 1 Hyper-Threaded, \"virtual\" core looks like 2 cores to Activity Monitor.\nWhat type of system do you have? If it is just 2 cores (which is seems to be) then nik's answer sounds correct.\nA late model 8-core system can look like 16 cores to Activity Monitor:\n\n", "Q: Why does Safari always hang?

I have a plastic MacBook that I like to use both on the go and at home, where I have a monitor, keyboard/mouse, speakers, etc that I hook up to use it more or less as a desktop. This works great, for the most part, except for the adaptor - it's constantly getting snagged on my desk due to the sheer size of the DVI-DVI connection.\nI've tried looking online for a 3 foot Mini-DVI to DVI cable so that I can eliminate this bulk, but without success. It seems that both Apple and a number of third parties are more than willing to sell adaptors for the Mini-DVI, but none sell actual cables.\nHave I missed something in my search? Or do manufacturers simply not produce the product I describe? If the latter, is it due to restrictions on using the Mini-DVI connector, a technical problem that requires the adaptor to be no longer than 6 or so inches, or perceived lack of demand?\n\nA: I think the idea would be to use the Mini-DVI to DVI adapter at one end of a DVI to DVI cable.\nThe specs should be checked for maximum workable length (example)\n\nA: Monoprice is usually the best bet for cables and they don't see to have anything.

As the owner of a Mac and an iPhone, I've naturally been using iTunes as my podcasting program. It works pretty well, except for one huge problem: if it determines that I haven't been listening to podcasts for a while it stops downloading them. Is there any way to force iTunes to continue downloading podcasts regardless of how often I listen to them? For most it isn't a big deal, but there are some (like \"This American Life\") that only publish one episode at a time so it's impossible to download the ones that you've missed.\nThis would also be useful to set up an iTunes server that shares the podcasts over the local network - since the podcasts would be listened to remotely, their \"new\" status would not be changed.\nI poked around com.apple.iTunes.plist to no avail - if there is a setting to disable it, it's not labelled in there.\nOne idea I had would be possibly trying to fool iTunes into thinking that the podcast was listened to recently, as one of the criteria for automatically unsubscribing is that it hasn't been listened to in 5 days. Would it be possible to periodically set this value to the current time? Or might it even accept a future time so it doesn't have to be periodically set?\n\nA: Apple covers this feature in their Making a Podcast page.\n\nAutomatic Unsubscribe.\niTunes automatically unsubscribes from\n  a podcast if the following conditions\n  are both met:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The user has not played any episode downloaded in the past 5 updates\n  (there may be more than one episode\n  downloaded per update.\n  \n*More than 5 days have elapsed since an episode was played.\n  \n  \n  In addition to minimizing unnecessary\n  bandwidth costs for both the user and\n  the podcaster, the unsubscribe logic\n  built into the iTunes client makes it\n  more likely that episode downloads, as\n  reported by a podcaster to a sponsor,\n  are roughly in line with actual plays\n  of the episode\n\nAnd as far as I am aware, you cannot disable this feature.\n\nA: There is an Applescript called \"Update Expired Podcasts\" at dougscripts.com.  \nhttp://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=updateexpiredpodcasts\nYou can run this automatically via your crontab or launchd using osacript:\nosascript ~/Library/iTunes/Scripts/Update\\ Expired\\ Podcasts.scptd\n\n", "Q: How can I play music from my iPhone through my computer? Now that I've had my iPhone for a few months, I'm trying an experiment to see if I can't replace the laptop I carry around with my iPhone + internet connected computer. To this end, I've been trying to find a program that will let me play the music on my iPhone through the hardware and software on the host computer.\nIf I recall correctly this was possible a few years ago with the iPod - Linux software like Rhythmbox and Banshee was able to read the music off an iPod and play it through the speakers. I even thought I recalled iTunes itself being capable of this at one time.\nNow, however, iTunes greys out/disables the music on my iPhone and I can't find any documented support for the iPhone in any other music program. Is this really no longer possible? Am I limited to using the headphone jack to get music to play?\n(note: I am using an iPhone 3G with the 3.0 software. I am attempting to play music on computers other than the one I sync with)\n\nA: The only way to play the music from your iPod or iPhone is to set iTunes to 'Manually manage  music and videos' on your device. \nTo do this just select your iPhone under 'Devices' on the left, and make sure \"Manually manage  music and videos\" is selected.\n\nClick 'Apply', and now your music should not be greyed out and you are free to play it. You should then be able to use Apple's Remote iPhone application to control iTunes from your device.\nIf you have all your music (and everything else) backed up already, just try it. iTunes can manage iPods funny sometimes and can do strange things (such as warnings like you describe that don't amount to anything). I have done this before to watch a video on another and no content was removed from my iPod touch at all.\n\nA: I came across this question via a Google search and registered just to post what I've discovered relating to this problem. I have a similar situation: I have a home computer that I'm using to sync music with my iPhone 3G S, and a work computer that I'd like to play the music on (without copying the music to the computer). The work computer can see all of the music but it is all greyed out, and when I do the \"Erase and Sync\" dance I get the same results that you do.\nUntil I got my iPhone last week I used to play its music through my work computer without issue with my 80GB iPod 5.5 gen.\nDespite what the other answers here say, everything I've read indicates that this is not possible with an iPhone. I suspect that the other people who have said it works do it with their iPods and just assume it works with the iPhone as well.\nDisappointed that I was losing a feature important to me by replacing my iPod with an iPhone, I set out to find a workaround. The best one I've found so far is this:\nhttp://www.andrewgrant.org/2008/03/30/how-to-sync-an-iphone-with-two-or-more-computers.html\nThe author refers to this technique as a method to allow you to sync with two computers, but I've found it also enables playback of my iPhone's music flawlessly on my work computer. You are essentially tricking the iPhone into thinking it's connected to the exact same instance of iTunes in either location.\nHope this helps you!\n\nA: Run this program on your computer:\nhttp://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/speakers.php\nIf it's a Mac, what you want is Airfoil Speakers for Mac. When the program is running, start playing music on your iOS device. Look in the little menu to right of the start/pause buttons in the iOS device screen. You'll see your computer listed there! Choose it. The sound from your iOS device is now coming out of your computer. If the computer is connected to speakers and using them as its output, the sound is coming out of those speakers.\n\nA: I know I'm replying on an old question, but I came in here googling.\nMy iPhone 4 had the same behavior, I just updated to iTunes 10 and I my music is no longer greyed out.\nIn essence: upgrade to iTunes 10 and you should be able to do this.\n\nA: You can do this with iTunes itself. Enable \"manual sync mode\" and you can then read right off the disk for playback.\nHere is an article with further details.\n\nA: You're talking about DAAP, which is what is used to present and stream music in iTunes (although iTunes also has encryption & friends, but we'll leave that out of the conversation for the moment).\nI think that this article on an app that allows you to turn your iPhone into a DAAP server might be of considerable interest to you.  As in, it allows you to stream your music from your iPhone to another DAAP-capable client, like iTunes...or Banshee...or Rhythmbox...\nAnyways, if that doesn't work, you at least know what you're looking for...and that's half the battle.  Find a DAAP server for iPhone and you're pretty much set.\n\nA: Here is a simple solution for those wanting to play music on iphone through the computer that I am doing.  Use your pc speakers simpy as headphones for the iphone.  Just plug in a 3.5mm jack into the pc audio in (microphone) receptacle and run it to the iphone headphones jack.  Problem solved, you do not have to transfer the songs on your phone to the computer, all controlled by the iphone.    \n\nA: Try using manual sync?  I have only an iPod Classic, but I can still play the music on other computer's using iTunes when I use manual sync...\nI believe I remember reading somewhere that with Auto Sync, you can only use your own library no matter what.\n\nA: update your firmware to the latest iOS firmware, then download a program called shairport4w. Open it up and select the \"change\" option, then rename the Name and create a password. Now start playing music on your iphone and press the icon next to the next track button (it looks like a Arrow pointing into a rectangle) And choose the option that will be whatever you named your computer in shirport4w. you will now be able to play your music through your PC's Speakers - you can change the volume through your iphone/ipod touch.\n", "Q: How can I resize a Mac OS X app window after disconnecting from an external monitor? I'm a MacBook user, and when I'm home I plug into a large external monitor to get additional screen space. When I'm on the go I disconnect and use my laptop's built-in display. For the most part this arrangement works very well; however, I occasionally run into an issue where I'll resize an app on the external, causing it to be too large to fit on the built-in screen when I disconnect.\nMost apps don't have a problem decreasing their height automatically or resizing to fit when I click the green orb, but some (like iTunes) don't want to cooperate. How can I resize apps like iTunes without reconnecting to my external?\nHere's a screenshot:\n\n\nA: For 99% of applications: The green button in the top left of any OS X window is called the \"Zoom\" button and will resize the window to it's contents so long as it fits in the current resolution. This is the same as choosing Zoom from the Window menu. \nFor programs such as iTunes that show a completely different mode when you choose Zoom, you can hold the option key when clicking the zoom button to force it to perform the normal zoom action instead of changing modes.\n\nA: Hold down the option key while clicking on the green button.  This should prevent iTunes from changing to the mini-player, and will resize the window as expected.\n\nA: There's an alternative. Use some app such as BetterTouchTool that enables you to resize windows in different ways. On BTT I choose Fn + Option to resize window on top of the mouse.\n\n\nA: You should try a third party window management add on, it'll really suit your power user style.\nTry Cinch, which is a shareware program that adds AeroSnap-like functionality to a mac (like that in windows 7, which allows you to drag a window to the top of the screen to make it maximize, or drag it to either side and make it consume exactly half the screen). \nAlso Stay is a great app for setting specified locations for windows to exist, and have them be restored to that spot every time the display configuration changes or the app is open. (for example you could set your contact list to always be in the rightmost side consuming a small portion of the screen. Everytime ur IM app is opened or a screen is plugged in or unplugged, it'll move back to it's spot)\nyou can see some others i found online on this aricle\n\nA: Starting with macOS Sierra, you can easily resize a window to fit the display. Move the mouse cursor to any edge of the window until it turns into a bi-directional arrow aligned diagonally (as-shown):\n\nNow, press and hold the Option key and double click/tap to change the size of window to fit the screen.\n", "Q: Why can't I sync more photos to my ipod touch? I am trying to sync all of my photos to my ipod touch. it syncs some of them but now when I add more folders it simply fails upfront saying:\nNo photos were copied to the Ipod because there is not enough free space on the ipod to hold your photos and photo albums.\nI have 12 GB free so I understand if all can't be synced but why doesn't it sync as many as it can until the ipod is filled up ??\nIs there any way I can figure out how many photos it will let me sync to avoid wasting time trying and failing ??\n\nA: As you have figured out, you need to select fewer folders/photos in order to keep it from failing. Simply compare the size of the folder(s) you want to sync with the space available on your iPod.\nOn a Mac, you can select a folder and press command+i (or control+click and select Get Info) to display the size of a folder.\nOn Windows, you can right click and select Properties to display the size of the folder.\n", "Q: Freeware for extracting 7zip files?

I feel really awful for rendering useless the iPhone of my friend...and I can't seem to fix it..it was firmware 3.1.3 it said it was upgrading but then it restored so I'm guessing the firmware didn't changed.\n\nA: I agree - PwnageTool tends to be the best, most complete and safest form of jailbreaking because it modifies the iPhone's firmware on your computer and then transfers it to the phone during a restore through iTunes, as opposed to accepting a new iOS upgrade from Apple and then re-jailbreaking it on the device. Another benefit of PwnageTool is that it doesn't upgrade your iPhone's baseband, which means that once you're unlocked, as long as you only upgrade using PwnageTool, you'll stay unlockable. \niClarified has excellent tutorials for unlocking and jailbreaking iPhones and a wizard to help you decide which tutorial to use. \n\nA: What you have to watch out for with iPhones is the baseband firmware -- there need to be both a jailbreak (allows unsigned applications like Cydia to run) and an unlock for your baseband firmware. At 3.1.3 you should be ok.\n\n\n*\n\n*Jailbreak. Use whatever method works for you.

After having used Eucalyptus and Stanza apps on my iPhone, I really can't read printed books while traveling any more.\nWhat similar app can I use to transfer, store and read my own pdf files on my iPhone?\nPS: I know that Stanza has a Windows application that converts PDFs for iPhone, but I am not a Windows user.\n\nA: As of 21st June, the Apple iBooks app can read and bookmark PDFs.\n\nA: My wife uses Evernote to read her existing PDFs of her knitting patterns on the iPhone - plus she has the benefit of them being available on the web, and her laptop.  It also has a great free version.\n\nA: I use Air Sharing which creates a virtual drive on your wireless network. I can copy files (including MS Office and PDF files) to my iPhone and view them. There are other file transfer apps that do similar things.\nIf you're starting with documents that are not PDFs (e.g. Word files), you might find reading PDFs inconvenient since PDFs are inherently page oriented. Stanza's FAQ page has an answer about creating ePub content from other documents.\n\nA: Readdle has an iphone app that allows you to download files in many formats from the web to your iphone.  They give you some free storage space at their site, but you can sync the files to your phone for reading on a plane, etc.\n\nA: GoodReader is very handy.  You can wirelessly transfer files and you can even add any web content to the GoodReader library simply by  placing a \"g\" in front of the URL in mobile Safari.\n\nA: Adobe Reader by Adobe for iOS can view PDFs\n\nA: I use PDFViewer:\n\nTransfer your PDF files to your iPhone and view them with this application.\n\n\nA: Another possibility is to use Calibre, it can convert PDF and other ebooks into epub and it is compatible with Stanza on the iPhone for downloading docs into the phone.  Internface is definitely not up to Mac standards but it works.\n\nA: I copy the PDFs I want to read while being mobile into a folder in my DropBox. And I just view them using the DropBox app.\nSo far, it's ok for simple PDFs, although moving from page to page may stutter a bit.\n\nA: I generally recommend Evernote for reading PDFs. There are other iphone apps that can get the job done, but evernote is front of the pack.\n\nA: I use Stanza.

I'm wondering if there is a way to extend the maximum duration of a custom ringtone i make for my iPhone past 30 seconds.\n\nA: Method that semtex41 mentioned still works on iOS 8. \nOn Mac (OS X) you can do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create two folders, one for short and one for long\n\n*Create two .m4r (.m4a, renamed) ringtones, one to each folder\n\n\n*\n\n*Short one must be LESS than 40 seconds\n\n\n*Give both files same name\n\n*Open iTunes and drag the short tone to tone library\n\n*Close iTunes\n\n*Open /Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Tones\n\n*Rename the ringtone from eg. tone.m4r to tone.m4r_short\n\n*Copypaste long version to Tones folder mentioned in 6, and make sure it has same name as short one had\n\n*Open iTunes, the Ringtones (or Tones) sections shows, that your tone's length is same as the short one's but content is from the long one.\n\n*Connect your iDevice, select Tones, select tones to sync, and click sync\n\n*Done!\n\n\nA: A custom ringtone can be up to 40 seconds - my custom ones are 38 seconds, and are made with iTunes - like this: http://artoftheiphone.com/2009/01/19/how-to-create-an-iphone-ringtone-using-itunes/\n\nA: iOS 7 update: the below procedure requires that you first install the ToneEnabler tweak, as Apple changed the way ringtones are loaded.\nIf your device is jailbroken:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create your ringtone file (neroAacEnc -if ringtone.wav -of ringtone.m4r).\n\n*Establish an SSH tunnel to your device (iphone_tunnel --iport 22 --lport 22).\n\n*Connect to your device using WinSCP or similar tool.\n\n*Browse to /Library/Ringtones/ (there should be a bunch of .m4r files in there).\n\n*Drag and drop your ringtone file in with the others.\n\n*Re-open \"Sounds\" in your device's settings.\n\n\nYour ringtone (of arbitrary length) should now be available to you.\nNote: Tested on iOS 5.1.1\n\nA: This is a way to trick the iPhone (iOS 6.0) into making ringtones longer than the ~40 second maximum:\nNote: This may now be a moot point since you can select songs for the default alarm, but the one advantage is it allows the phone to vibrate when it is a ringtone and the vibrate alert is enabled. \n\nSummary: Add a short 15sec .m4r song to iTunes. Replace the source file with the full length .m4r version, then drag it from the Library to your iPhone. iTunes will be expecting the short version but will copy the whole thing without error. \n\n\nPrerequisites: Create two .mp3 versions of the song. One the full length, the other a short version <30sec.\nDetailed instructions:\n1) Create two folders. One with the full length version of the song. The other with a 15s version.\n2) Add the short version to the iTunes Library via File>Add File to Library\n3) Convert the short version to AAC, then search for it in Music. Once you find it, right click to Show in Windows Explorer. Rename the file extension of the short song to .m4r. Keep the Window Open. \n4) Move the .m4r version to the short folder in Step 1. \n5) Remove the AAC listings in the Music Library. \n6) Repeat the AAC conversion for the full version, following Steps 3-5 while working from the full length folder. This is to prevent confusion. Use file size to help separate if needed. \n6) From the short folder in Step 1, drag the .m4r into the Library section in iTunes. \n7) Rename the short .m4r file extension to .m4r_short\n8) Copy the full length .m4r into the short directory. \n9) From within the iTunes Library, open Tones and then drag the song to your iPhone. The entire full length song will copy without any errors. \n\nA: \nI'm wondering if there is a way to extend the maximum duration of ringtones for my iPhone past 30 seconds.\n\niPhone ringtones cannot be longer than 40 seconds.\n\nA: It's not a carrier setting it's a phone setting. Max I've seen is 30 seconds but there may be a way to get around that. I think that the file format .m4r has to be cut down to 30 seconds to work with the iphone. Even when I made custom ones they had to be edited down to 30 seconds.\n\nA: Yes, you can extend your custom-ringtone duration on any iPhone with any iTunes version. No jailbreak required.\nHere's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put your ringtone in your device by using the normal iTunes procedure (sync it, drag and drop in Ringtones, etc.). It must be less than 40 seconds. Say 10 seconds.\n\n*Make sure it's been transferred in your device by going to Settings →  Sounds.\n\n*You can already select it as your ringtone if you wish.\n\n*Download iBackupBot and install it on your computer (available for free for both macOS and Windows, google for it, first result).\n\n*Open iBackupBot. Make sure it detects your device. If it doesn't, just click on the Refresh button (blue circular arrow).\n\n*Click on your device name.\n\n*Click on \"Raw file system\".\n\n*On the right panel, click on iTunes_Control → Ringtones.\n\n*You will see a random-named file ending with .m4r extension.\n\n*That file is the ringtone. If you have multiple ringtones, you will see multiple m4r files.\n\n*On your computer, convert any full-length song/ringtone of your choice to m4r format. You can use any online service for that.\n\n*Once you got your full-length m4r, just rename it to the one currently in the Ringtones folder of your device (as seen in step 8-9). If you have multiple m4r, just choose one.\n\n*In iBackupBot, click the Import button located exactly on the top of the folder structure.\n\n*Find and select your full-length m4r file.\n\n*Confirm to overwrite.\n\n*Done.\n\n", "Q: Can you install two versions of an app on the same iOS device? Is it possible to install two versions of an app on the same iPhone and, if so, how?\nThe scenario would be that you have purchased an app, and a recent update has changed some of the features--not necessarily for the better or worse, but enough of a change that you'd like to still be able and use the older version at times. You could downgrade from a backup, but it'd be nice to have the new version at times as well. Is it possible to have two versions of an app be 'seen' as different apps so that they can both be transferred to the iPhone at the same time? \n\nA: It's not so much the name -- at least not the visible one, as an upgrade can change the visible name -- but it's the bundle identifier inside the app that identifies it and allows the OS to know it's supposed to perform an upgrade. The developer has to keep the bundle identifier the same in order to actually provide an upgrade and not a new app, so no, you're out of luck.*\n*Note that there may well be some way to do such a thing if you jailbreak your device, but I have no firsthand knowledge of such.\n\nA: It is possible to install 2 versions of the same app on your device. However, you're the one who gotta edit the .ipa, and it will lose its online features, like syncing with Facebook or something else.\nMatthew Frederick said on his answer to your post:\n\n\"but it's the bundle identifier inside the app that identifies it and allows the OS to know it's supposed to perform an upgrade. The developer has to keep the bundle identifier the same in order to actually provide an upgrade and not a new app\"\n\nYou can edit the bundle identifier, and here's a guide on how to do it:\nLet's suppose you have the version 2.0 of the app installed on your device, and you want the version 1.0 also.\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll need those following programs on your computer: \"WinRAR\", \"plist Editor Pro\" and \"iFunbox\" (the last one is to install the older version of the app on your device)\n\n*Download the version 1.0 of the app (.ipa file) from the internet.\n\n*Search for an app that you would NEVER want to download, it doesn't matter what it is, and download its .ipa .\n\n*Open this last .ipa with WinRAR.\n\n*There will be a folder called \"Playload\", open it.\n\n*There will be a folder with the name of the app, open it.\n\n*Double click (to open) the file \"Info.plist\".\n\n*Search for <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>.\n\n*Under it, there will be the identifier, for example: <string>com.company.appname</string>.\n\n*Copy this \"com.company.appname\".\n\n*Close the file.\n\n*Now open your app's older version's .ipa with WinRAR.\n\n*There will be a folder called \"Playload\", open it.\n\n*There will be a folder with the name of the app, open it.\n\n*Double click (to open) the file \"Info.plist\".\n\n*Search for <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>.\n\n*Under it, there will be the identifier, for example: <string>com.2company2.2appname2</string>.\n\n*Replace this \"com.2company2.2appname2\" with the one you've copied earlier.\n\n*That will make your device think it's another app, and not simply replace the one you had with the one you'll install.\n\n*Save and close the file.\n\n*If WinRAR asks if you want to make the modifications, press YES.\n\n*Now open iFunbox, and plug your device into the computer (close iTunes if it pops up).\n\n*On the top left hand corner, press \"iFunbox Classic\".\n\n*On the left, open \"Connected Devices\", then open your device's name (for example, \"Johnny | New iPad on USB\"), then open \"User Applications\".\n\n*On the top, click \"Install App\", and select the .ipa you've just modified.\n\n*Wait for it to install. Make sure the device has its lights off (locked).\n\n*Enjoy the 2 versions of the app on your device :)\n\n\nBut again, don't forget this disables the online features of the app, because of the bundle identifier change. Also be careful not to install the app from Step 3 as this will cause an upgrade.\nThat's the only way I could figure out to do this. There may be other ways.\n\nA: No, it’s not possible to install two versions of an app that has the same name. You’d have to ask the developer to rename it, which I doubt he’ll be willing to do. Although the iOS doesn’t really check “the name” (like a file manager would do), the develop would have to create another “build” if I am not mistaken.\nSo you’re out of luck. Either embrace the new features or find an alternative. :)\n\nA: Mine just gave me to versions of the same app without jailbreaking or using the computer i just go iOS 7.1 and i git two copies :)\n", "Q: iPod touch bad battery performance after updating to iOS 4 Hey, I own an iPod touch 2g which worked great until I updated to iOS4. After I did the update, it takes just a few hours for the battery to run out. Even if I´m not doing anything with it. I noticed that if I turn off wifi the battery life is great. So I´m hoping you guys can help me with either a solution to this issue and get it to work normally even with wifi on, or some way to get the wifi turned off when blocking it.\nSome things I already try: - fully discharge the vattery and then charge it to 100% - restore the iPod - Updated iOS again to 4.1 now\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Try to completely disable Push Notifications in the Settings application. This might lead to the iPod not trying to maintain a WiFi connection all the time and thus increase battery life.\n\nA: This would be a combination of the fact that the age of your device means the battery is losing capacity anyway, and the fact that iOS4 is much more resource-intensive. To preserve and keep the battery in good running order, every month or so calibrate it, and make sure the software is always running the newest version, as bug and software fixes can improve battery life. Hope this helps. \n\nA: For others who come across this question:\nI had really bad battery life when my ipod was having a hard time connecting to the network at home.

Is it possible to crossfade songs on an iPhone that are played through the iPod app?\nIf there is no native way to do this, are there any apps that can do this?\n\nA: I'm sorry, I don't think it is possible (yet). If you had an old iPod Nano/Classic then I might have suggested 'Rockbox' (give it a google). Send Apple a feature request about it, they never know, if enough people bombard them with requests then maybe it will become a native feature.\nSorry I can't be of more help.\n\nA: I added a new app myself, because I wasn't happy with the other ones out there.

I would like to install Windows 7 on an external USB 2.0 500 gb hard drive. Is it possible to both install to and boot from this USB drive from my MacBook Pro 2010?\n\nA: As far as I know Microsoft lock their Operating Systems so that you cannot run them directly from an external storage device. Microsoft say something about it not being a 'primary means of storage.' More like them making an attempt at stopping people running multiple computers of on copy of the OS, as allowing them to install it on any storage would allow people to make loads of copies. Hence, Linux does not have this problem. I personally do not do much gaming, and have never needed Windows on my MacBook Pro, so have not dabbled in the whole 'Windows on my Mac' thing. If you really do have a problem with sticking Windows on the MBP's Hard drive and booting either natively or through virtualisation, then the following links may help, although the guides are designed for XP and I have no idea if they will work on 7.\nPrepping the install CD (scroll down)\nInstalling\nAs I said, I cannot guarantee this will work for 7. I hope, however that I have helped in some way. \n\nA: Disclosure: I have never attempted to install program files to an external drive, so I have no idea on how programs will perform. I supply this answer as a possible solution with no guarantees on performance.\nIf you were contemplating running an entire Windows install off an external drive, you could try boot camping Windows with 20-30 gigs of your SSD. That should suffice for getting Windows operating. You then would have to install games to the external and run them off that. \nI really have no idea if you would be able to get enough bandwidth for loading textures etc from USB 2.0, but then again you didn't clarify what type of games (casual, graphics intensive, etc), so it just might be sufficient.\nTo answer the actual question: everything I have ever read on the subject of actual running full Windows from a USB drive indicates it can't be done. I believe a couple projects have managed to get Windows XP running well enough on a USB drive, but I myself have not used them.\n", "Q: Migrating to new iMac, what does Migration Assistant actually migrate? I've got a new iMac (Santa must have thought I was a good boy this year) and I want to move data from my 3 year old MacBook (Intel, running Snow Leopard). I realise I have a few options for this, but migration assistant is currently looking better than either starting from fresh or Carbon Copy Cloner etc.\nWhat I would like to know is if migration assistant will bring across everything from a 3 year old system, including all the remnants of applications I have installed and deleted etc. If it does has anyone got any hints to stop it doing this?\n\nA: I've migrated between many macs over the years, and I've always found that the best way to do it, is manually. Normally I use a firewire cable (but you can also use WiFi, USB, external hard drive, dvd/cd, etc) to hook up the two computers, then just drag over files from one computer to the other.\nMostly everything the average user has on their mac will be found in their user folder (home folder). You can just drag/copy this entire folder over, or you can be more selective about which folders in your home folder you move (for instance, you may not want the Library folder). Then, anything outside of your home folder (Applications, for one) you can drag/copy over if you want.\n\nA: You should not use CCC between Macs. Every Mac has a set of drivers configured for the current hardware during installation. When you use CCC to clone to another Mac, you are getting the setup, which is not optimized for that Mac.\nUse Migration Assistant. I had to migrate several Macs in the past, restoring from the Time Machine or copying from older Macs. Migration Assistant never failed. I have lots of apps and some of them are copy-protected and have own drivers (I am a developer). Migration Assistant took care of almost all of them.

I'm thinking of using Migration Assistant to transfer data to my new Mac, but what is the best way to do this?\nI have a Time Machine Back up on a Time Capsule, but this would be over wifi, so slow?\nI guess target disk mode is out, as my MacBook only has FW400 and the iMac only has FW800, I understand these are different connectors, so out of the question?\nHowever I do have a FW drive with both FW400 & FW800 connectors, so could Time Machine onto that, would it be slow?\nOr could I make a temporary wired network between the two machines? If so would I need a crossover cable, or are Macs clever enough for this to work with a standard ethernet cable?\n\nA: I have a FW800-FW800 cable that comes with an adaptor, and will convert FW800 to FW400.  So I can put on the adaptor and use TDM between a FW800 and FW400 machines.  Macs have ethernet interfaces that do auto MDI-X, so a crossover cable is not necessary.

Also, can anyone recommend the best (free) hard drive diagnostic tools Mac OS X?\nThanks, Chirag\n  Model Name: MacBook Pro\n  Model Identifier: MacBookPro5,5\n  Processor Name: Intel Core 2 Duo\n  Processor Speed: 2.53 GHz\n  Number Of Processors: 1\n  Total Number Of Cores: 2\n  L2 Cache: 3 MB\n  Memory: 4 GB\n  Bus Speed: 1.07 GHz\n  Boot ROM Version: MBP55.00AC.B03\n  SMC Version (system): 1.47f2\n  Serial Number (system): W89241NW66E\n  Hardware UUID: D62F2A33-E5BA-5208-B300-28730564D27F\n  Sudden Motion Sensor:\n  State: Enabled\n\nSystem Software Overview:\n\n  System Version: Mac OS X 10.5.8 (9L30)\n  Kernel Version: Darwin 9.8.0\n  Boot Volume: Macintosh HD\n  Boot Mode: Normal\n  Time since boot: 5:20\n\n\nA: About the only \"free\" tool that's worth anything is smartmontools, IMHO. \nsmartmontools is a free SMART monitoring application that comes from the Unix, BSD, and Linux world (OS X is based on BSD). This tool can provide extensive SMART monitoring but it's command line which a lot of people don't like. Everything else costs money - I suppose some people have actual costs, like food, water, heat, mortgage, etc. etc.\nZVH, over on MacRumors, has written a list of drive testing tools but beware most of these cost money:\n\nMac hard drive test software - creating the definitive list\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Disk Utility, diskutil (FREE, comes with OS)\n  \n*Smartmon Tools (FREE, Open Source)\n  \n*SMARTReporter ($4.95 for commercial version, but an older version is FREE)\n  \n*Scannerz Lite ($21.95)\n  \n*Scannerz with Phoenix and FSE-Lite ($39.95)\n  \n*Disk Tools Pro ($79.99)\n  \n*Disk Warrior ($99.00)\n  \n*Drive Genius ($99.00)\n  \n*TechTool Pro ($99.99)\n  \n\nThat's actually a really good report. Interesting that nearly no one commented on it. In any case, I think you get what you pay for. Tools like Disk Warrior and Scannerz are known to do very limited things but do an extraordinarily good job of doing it, while other \"Swiss Army Knife\" tools apparently do a decent job, but not really all that thorough. The author only identifies a few applications as \"free.\"\nAlthough I find SMART status useful, I wouldn't base my life around SMART reports and would recommend that people do web searches about the reliability of SMART testing before using it as a defacto standard.\n\nA: I assume you are aware of the Shareware tools (Like the five mentioned in this article).\nIn any case, since you want the free option, you will have to rely in your common sense and the tools you have (this is also true for the Shareware options, which really don’t seem to add much at this stage). Most of the benefit of TechTool Pro and DiskWarrior is to have am emergency plan in place in case of hard drive failure. But that is to be done before the problem :)\nBack to your case, I suggest you give Onyx a try to check the status of your HDD’s Smart status. Assuming you don’t hear strange noises in the drive, performing a full Clone to an external drive using Carbon Copy Cloner would provide you with an important piece of information: the computer can read your entire drive, block by block. \nBoth Onyx and OS X can verify your volume so I suggest you also perform a verify (using Disk Utility for example) and verify your permissions. \nFinally, use AppleJack to execute some of the above tests to make sure that the OS is in Single User. \nIf after performing all of the above, you see nothing “out of the ordinary”, you don’t hear “strange click noises” or you don’t detect any strange slowness in your drive, you can assume that the drive has not suffered any damage. \nBut, all things said, I’d keep my backups up2date just in case. (You do have backups, don’t you?)\nI’ve had drives fall from a desktop to the floor and survive for years without any problems, and some drives tipped 0.5 inches and instantly died. Hard drives are like unicorns. :)\n\nA: If you haven't already, you should pop open Disk Utility, select your drive, and click the Info button. Ensure that the SMART status is \"Verified\". \nOf course if you hear any audible clicking or anything of the sort, then you'll likely want to order a new HDD now (then again, I figure you haven't heard any clicking, and are wanting to check the health of the drive to ensure it is okay).\n\nA: Sounds like your best recourse would be to pull the hard drive and test it in a Windows Machine, or dual-boot Windows on your Mac.  Software that's actually useful, like Seatools, which does far more than Smart Monitoring, and is far better than the sub-standard disk utility built into Mac.  \n", "Q: Playlist on ipod nano 5th gen I have been trying to sync my playlists from itunes with my new ipod nano 5th gen, but the podcasts don't sync (they did sync on my old 2nd gen).  Any suggestions for how to fix this?\nThe music playlists sync as do the podcasts, but the playlists with only podcasts don't sync.  I sync automatically when plugging into my Macbook Pro with iTunes version 10.\nI don't have any playlists that have both podcasts and non-podcasts.\n\nA: You might need to provide more details (are you getting any error messages? Are you manually managing you iPod's music or automatically?) but here's the best place to look:\nConnect your iPod to your computer, fire up iTunes and click your nano's icon on the left of the iTunes window. Look for the podcasts tab and make sure the sync Podcasts and 'automatically sync podcast' tick boxes are selected. \nThere's a really clear step-by-step here. \n", "Q: Why did syncing with iTunes delete one of my photos folders? I have an iPod Touch, and I tried to sync with apparently more room than my iPod Touch had on it.  So instead of not syncing some new podcasts, it decided to delete one of my photos folders off of my iPod Touch (over 5000 pictures).\nWhy did the iPod Touch determine that this should be deleted? Why didn't it give me a warning or a prompt so I could have chosen what action to take?\n\nA: Suggestion 1 :\nI think you would be a new user to the iPod/iPhone/OS X/iTunes family. \nIf your afraid or don't understand what is happening during synchronization using iTunes, I suggest you to use a utility called iPhoneExplorer.\nJust Explorer the iPhone/iPod/iPad like a file system. You would get your images under Root/User/Media/DCIM/ directory. images are grouped in directories like 100APPLE, 101APPLE and so on. Just explore and copy it.\nSuggestion 2:\nSynchronization - means A single machine and an iPod synchronization. Not multiple machines and an iPod. If you synchronizes from other machine it will erase all of your old data. According to me, you had the problem just because you might have synchronized from other machines iTunes. \n\nA: In my experience iTunes treats photos as the least important content on an iOS device, whenever there is too much music selected to sync a pop up tells me that there was not enough space to sync all of my photos to the iOS device. I don't think this can be changed.\n", "Q: Got any tips or tricks for Terminal in Mac OS X? One tip or trick per answer.\nMy favorite is \nopen .\n\nOpens the folder you're currently browsing in Finder.

(The first time you do this, it can take a few seconds to index the man page files, so wait a bit for results to appear, but subsequent searches are fast.) It will show man page results in the Help menu search results. Selecting one opens a window displaying the formatted page.\nAs of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, there are a number of enhancements to man page support:\n\n\n*\n\n*Man page searching lets you supply section numbers/names in various formats: \"2 open\", \"open 2\", \"open(2)\". It also supports asterisk \"*\" for wildcard searches.\n\n*It now searches all the files in MANPATH (prior to Lion it only searched a fixed set of directories, so, for example, it didn't find any X11 man pages). It doesn't run in a shell, however, so if you want to customize MANPATH you may need to customize man.conf (x-man-page://1/man), or set it in your global environment.\n\n*There are commands in the Help menu for opening man pages (Open man Page for Selection) and performing an apropos search (Search in man Pages for Selection). There are corresponding commands in the contextual menu, and there are Services you can enable to perform these lookups from other applications (System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services > Open man Page in Terminal / Search man Pages in Terminal).\n\n*If there is no selected text, Open man Page for Selection will automatically look at the text to the left of the cursor. This means you can enter a command name, then use this command to open the man page before entering command arguments. It'll skip over whitespace. It also understands man page references \"open(2)\" and URLs \"x-man-page://2/open\". (If you explicitly select text, it also understands \"2 open\" and \"open 2\".)\n\n*Man page windows use the \"Man Page\" settings profile. You can customize this to alter the appearance of man pages displayed using these commands. It also remembers the position of man page windows separately from other windows, so you can have man pages appear in the same place on screen each time, independent of where you place other terminal windows.\n\n*⌘+ double-click will open man page references \"open(2)\", enabling you to navigate references from one man page to another. (⌘+ double-click will also open any recognized URL, or even some patterns like email addresses—creates a new mail message—and domain names—opens in Safari.)\n\n*When viewing a man page window (or any terminal whose commands have all completed/exited), Terminal supports some \"less\"-compatible pager commands: space = Page Down, ⇧+space = Page Up, F = Page Down (\"forward\"), B = Page Up (\"back\"), ⌫ = Scroll down one line, ↑/↓ = Scroll up/down one line.\n\n\nA: $ emacs -batch -l dunnet\n\nDead end\nYou are at a dead end of a dirt road.

In the preferences, go to the Settings tab and select your default profile. Go to Keyboard and set control cursor left and control cursor right to send string \\033b and \\033f respectively.\nWhile your're at it, you can also fix Home (\\033[H), End (\\033[F), Page Up (\\033[5~) and Page Down (\\033[6~) so that they send those keys to the shell instead of scrolling the buffer.\n\nA: Resample image so height and width aren't greater than specified size, e.g. 100x100:\nsips -Z 100x100 image.jpg\n\nsips supports other operations such as: flip, rotate, crop, image properties query, colour profile query and modification.

If you drag to the tab bar of an existing window, it will create a new tab in that window.\nYou can also do this from the command line or a shell script:\nopen -a Terminal /some/path/\n\nThis is the command-line equivalent of dragging a folder onto the Terminal application icon and will open a new terminal window at \"/some/path\".\nTerminal also now supports Services for opening a terminal at a selected folder (e.g., in Finder) or a text pathname using the contextual menu. You can enable them in\n\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services\n\nLook for New Terminal at Folder and New Terminal Tab at Folder. You can even assign command keys to them if you like.\nFinally, if you drag a folder or pathname onto an existing tab (i.e., the tab in the tab bar) and the foreground process is the shell, it will execute a \"cd\" command in one step. As in previous versions, dragging a folder onto the terminal display will insert the pathname to the folder.\n\nA: If you’re like me, you have multiple Terminal.app tabs open at the same time.\nNow, if you open three tabs at the same point in time, then enter some commands in each of them, then close them all, the Bash shell that Terminal.app uses only remembers the command history for the last tab that you close. So, the command history from the other two tabs gets lost.\nIf you don’t want to lose your command history in any tab, add this to your ~/.bash_profile (or any other file that gets sourced when a new Terminal tab is opened):\n# Append to the Bash history file, rather than overwriting it\nshopt -s histappend\n\n\nA: When cding, one of the most useful features is tab completion.\nFor example, instead of entering cd FooBarBazBax, you can enter cd FooB followed by Tab. Tab completion will work as long as the part of the path or filename you entered isn’t ambiguous.\nHowever, if you were to type cd foob followed by Tab, the completion wouldn’t work, as the folder name starts with an uppercase F. Luckily, you can make tab completion even more useful by making it ignore the filename case.\nAdd this to your ~/.inputrc file (create the file if you don’t have it already):\n# Make Tab autocomplete regardless of filename case\nset completion-ignore-case on\n\nThis way, cd foob followed by Tab would complete it into cd FooBarBazBax, provided there’s a folder with that name in the current working directory.\n\nA: Just type \npurge\n\nand it will make inactive memory as free again. Mac OS X keeps apps in memory for a while after you close them, so they will open fast if you open them again.

Here you have:\nCHFLAGS(1)        BSD General Commands Manual           CHFLAGS(1)\n\nNAME\n     chflags -- change file flags\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     chflags [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] flags file ...\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The chflags utility modifies the file flags of the listed files as speci-\n     fied by the flags operand.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -f      Do not display a diagnostic message if chflags could not modify\n         the flags for file, nor modify the exit status to reflect such\n         failures.\n\n     -H      If the -R option is specified, symbolic links on the command line\n         are followed.  (Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal\n         are not followed.)\n\n     -h      If the file is a symbolic link, change the file flags of the link\n         itself rather than the file to which it points.\n\n     -L      If the -R option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.\n\n     -P      If the -R option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.\n         This is the default.\n\n     -R      Change the file flags for the file hierarchies rooted in the\n         files instead of just the files themselves.\n\n     -v      Cause chflags to be verbose, showing filenames as the flags are\n         modified.  If the -v option is specified more than once, the old\n         and new flags of the file will also be printed, in octal nota-\n         tion.\n\n     The flags are specified as an octal number or a comma separated list of\n     keywords.  The following keywords are currently defined:\n\n       arch, archived\n           set the archived flag (super-user only)\n\n       opaque  set the opaque flag (owner or super-user only).  [Directory\n           is opaque when viewed through a union mount]\n\n       nodump  set the nodump flag (owner or super-user only)\n\n       sappnd, sappend\n           set the system append-only flag (super-user only)\n\n       schg, schange, simmutable\n           set the system immutable flag (super-user only)\n\n       uappnd, uappend\n           set the user append-only flag (owner or super-user only)\n\n       uchg, uchange, uimmutable\n           set the user immutable flag (owner or super-user only)\n\n       hidden  set the hidden flag [Hide item from GUI]\n\n     As discussed in chflags(2), the sappnd and schg flags may only be unset\n     when the system is in single-user mode.\n\n     Putting the letters ``no'' before or removing the letters ``no'' from a\n     keyword causes the flag to be cleared.  For example:\n\n       nouchg  clear the user immutable flag (owner or super-user only)\n       dump    clear the nodump flag (owner or super-user only)\n\n     Unless the -H or -L options are given, chflags on a symbolic link always\n     succeeds and has no effect.  The -H, -L and -P options are ignored unless\n     the -R option is specified.  In addition, these options override each\n     other and the command's actions are determined by the last one specified.\n\n     You can use \"ls -lO\" to see the flags of existing files.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     The chflags utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     ls(1), chflags(2), stat(2), fts(3), symlink(7)\n\nHISTORY\n     The chflags command first appeared in 4.4BSD.\n\nBUGS\n     Only a limited number of utilities are chflags aware.

It's gotten me out of some binds. It's not too hard to use.\n\nA: I’m not sure; this might work in any decent terminal application, not only in OS X’s. However: \nUsing Terminal.app it is possible to put status information to the actual title bar and not just to the prompt.\nIn order to do that, you need to change the PS1 variable in bash to the following model:\nPS1='\\[\\033]0;TITLE\\007\\]PROMPT'\n\nWhere TITLE and PROMPT must be substituted to the actual commands which provide the status information. For example, \\w lists the current full path; \\W the directory name. You can even execute a command by putting it in backticks. (So you could even put the output of arbitrary commands to the title – or to the prompt.)\nGit users (with git’s bash completion installed) might find the following useful. Add this to your .bashrc\nexport GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1\nPS1='\\[\\033]0;`__git_ps1` \\w\\007\\]\\h:\\W \\u\\$ '\n\nand the title bar of Terminal.app will show the current git branch (and whether it’s clean or not) followed by the current full path. This gives useful information about where you are only when you need it and does not make the actual prompt overly long.\nIn case you don’t use git very much and only care about the path in the title bar:\nPS1='\\[\\033]0;\\w\\007\\]\\h:\\W \\u\\$ '\n\n\nA: The say command invokes the system text-to-speech capabilities.\nsay \"Hello there.\"\n\n\nA: !!\n\nRuns the last command again.

It furthermore allows one to \"cd\" to a file, which is very helpful when you want to change your directory to that of a given finder file. Simply write cd, and drag the file to the terminal and your are there.\nAdd the following to your .bashrc or .alias file\nalias cd=mycd\n\nmycd(){ \n  if [ -f \"$*\" ]\n  then\n   \\cd  \"`dirname $*`\"\n  else \n    \\cd \"$*\";\n  fi\n\n  echo \"\\cd \\\"\"`pwd`\\\"\"\" > ~/.todir  ; \n  PS1='\\[\\033]0;`pwd | xargs basename`\\007\\]\\e[31m\\w:\\e[0m\n'\n}\n\nFinally, you need to change your terminal settings: \nIn terminal:settings:shell - make the shell complete the following command:\nsource ~/.todir; clear\n\nNext time you start your terminal - you will automatically be redirected to your last opened directory - the terminal title will change title when you use the cd alias, and your prompt will show the full directory path.\n\nA: As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal supports a few \"less\"-compatible pager commands when there are no processes running in a terminal. This is useful for paging through and reading text after commands have completed/exited.

New tabs, gooood.\nIn general, Safari’s tab controls are wonderful, but one failing drives us crazy: Certain links are allowed to override your preference for opening new webpages in tabs, essentially forcing the application to open a new window. To prevent this in the future, execute this command: defaults write com.apple.Safari TargetedClicksCreateTabs -bool TRUE.\n\nShow Hidden Files in The Finder\nThe names of hidden files always begin with a period--keep that in mind before you delete or edit a file that doesn’t look familiar.\nBelieve it or not, the files you see listed on your Desktop in the Finder do not represent all of the files contained in your Desktop folder. In almost every folder, the OS hides system files that Apple considers too important for the likes of us to mess with (or too mundane for us to be bothered with). Now and again, though, it’s useful to view these files. To see the full contents of all folders in the Finder, execute :  defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE.\n\nDisable the Dashboard\nWhen the Dashboard appears on our Desktop, it’s usually because we missed the delete key and hit F12 instead.\nWe’ve always liked the Dashboard in theory--on occasion, we’ve even downloaded widgets for it. Unfortunately, we never get around to using them, and our aging Mac laptop could use the extra RAM to run real apps. If you’re in the same boat, free up some system memory by terminating the Dashboard with two quick Terminal commands. First, set its default to Off by executing : defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean YES. Second, kill and restart the Dashboard and Dock with this command: killall Dock.\n\nA lot more on this website : Click HERE\n\nA: pg with no arguments ping the IP 8.8.8.8 (usefull for basic internet connection test), otherwise ping the given IP.

I just renamed it to Tiger Terminal.app, and it still runs fine on Leopard.  Haven't tried it on Snow Leopard.\nSo, with Tiger Terminal, you can do mouse-free copy by typing ⌘+⌥+⌫, then using the arrow keys to move to the start of the area you want to copy.  Next, type ⌘+⌥+⌫ again to anchor the selection point.  Use the arrow keys (some emacs-like commands also work for navigation like ctrl+E) to move to the end of the region you want to copy.  Finally, type ⌘+⌥+⌫ again to copy selection to the clipboard.\n\nA: BBEdit version for viewing man pages:\nbbman () {\n  MANWIDTH=160 MANPAGER='col -bx' man $@ | bbedit --clean\n}\n\n\nA: List all directories alone in a directory - er - folders in a folder.\nls -la | grep '^d'\n\nFind sizes of given directory - again - er - folder.\ndu -s dirname\n\n\nA: user42053 mentions adding a file -i to every folder.

The best improvement of a OS X terminal is to make it feel UNIX/Linux like. My first intention was to show you a proper bash-completion completing several things like ssh or git correctly.

I put this in my .bash_profile for easy access.\n\nA: When I'm in terminal I expect every action to be given in written form, because there is no GUI. \nMany of the terminal based apps have some kind of quit command to bring you back to shell. This is what I'm used to when in terminal.\nTo leave a terminal window or tab I aliased following command:\nalias q=\"osascript -e 'tell application \\\"System Events\\\" to tell process \\\"Terminal\\\" to keystroke \\\"w\\\" using command down'\"\n\nEDIT:\nbetter even is to do as Jason commented:\nconfigure Terminal.app to close the window if the shell exited cleanly\nalias q=\"logout\"\n\n\nA: If you have XCode installed, running the command purge at the terminal is really helpful.  It frees up all of your active and inactive RAM.  It's useful for people like me who do a lot of audio production (or any kind of media editing for that matter) when you only have 4 GB RAM.  You would be surprised how fast 4 GB gets used up.\n", "Q: What's the point of the 60W Apple MagSafe replacement charger? One of the cable tabs on my MagSafe charger for my MacBook came undone, so I took this as a sign to retire the charger to home use and to purchase another for travel. When I went to my local Best Buy, they had two chargers for sale, 60W and 85W, that looked the same size, sold for the same price, etc. The only difference was that the 85W supported the MacBook Pro, while the 60W only supported the MacBook.\nEven though I am a MacBook owner, I figured I might, sometime in the future, purchase a MacBook Pro and I went with the 85W charger. When I opened it up I found it was slightly larger than the 60W charger it was replacing, but for all intents and purposes there's no real difference between the two. So why does Apple sell a 60W replacement (or even manufacture the 60W at all)? Are there enough people that want to save 25W?\n\nA: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=6301678\nSounds like it does work just fine.  You cannot use the smaller charger with MBP of course.  This is also the case with the MBA which uses a 45watt version.\nIn addition to what rangerpretzel said, which is the main technical reason:\nBut also, size matters to some, MBA users want portability. the 45 watt version is much smaller and the 60 is smaller then the 85.  Some people want the smallest one compatible with their computer.  Also, the original 85 watt magsafe power supply used to be even larger then it is today and was a concern at the time of release. Apple eventualy re-engineered it to the size it is now.  \nCost wise, it might make more sence to just make one power supply, but apple does offer its users a \"few\" options. haha.\n\nA: You definitely don't need to worry about your laptop being fried by the higher-capacity power adapter, because the laptop will only draw what it needs.\nMy 6-year-old laptop came with a 65W power supply. When I bought it, I could have gotten it with a 90W power supply, but I opted for the smaller power supply.  The docking station that I purchased later came with a 90W power supply which can also plug directly into the laptop.  I've noticed that the 90W supply charges the laptop faster, but I prefer it mainly because it has a much longer power cord.\nThe efficiency figures Ranger has hypothesized are not necessarily accurate; it depends on the design of the specific power supply and the optimal load range. A given power supply may be more efficient under your own typical usage scenario, but the only way to find out for certain is to test each power supply's power draw yourself under different loads.  For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plugged into the wall, but not into a laptop\n\n*Laptop fully charged and turned on (idle)\n\n*Laptop fully charged and maxing out power draw (e.g., transcoding video while burning a CD)\n\n*Laptop charging but turned off\n\n*Laptop charging and turned on (idle)\n\n*Laptop charging and maxing out power draw (e.g., transcoding video while burning a CD)\n\n\nYou may find that the higher-wattage power supply is actually significantly more efficient under a high load than the lower-wattage power supply, because it is not near its maximum capacity.  In fact, you may find that the higher-wattage power supply is more efficient across the board, and the lower-wattage power supply only beats the bigger supply under a narrow range of loads. Or perhaps the smaller supply is never more efficient, and its only advantage is its smaller physical size.\n\nA: Most of the anecdotal evidence is that there are no problems, and this extends to a member of Apple Store staff who say they use MBP charger to charge all laptops and if you read the small print they are suitable for both MB and MBP.\nI did find one person who said that their batteries \"burnt out\" while using the 85w charger with a MacBook but this seemed so far from the normal tale (that everything was fine, of which there are hundreds of accounts) that it may have been down to something else.\nBut it doesn't answer the question why do apple do it.  It would be simpler (certainly) and cheaper (probably - just down to bulk buying) to standardise.  The fact they haven't makes me think that there may be a reason, however it may be historic.  For instance it may be that the new MacBooks may run fine on either charger while the old ones don't.  To avoid having to specify model and year and risk selling someone a charger which will melt their old laptop, they may have just decided to stick with MacBook charger and a MacBook pro charger and avoid confusion.\nThe 60w adaptor incidentally is underpowered for the MBP - battery charging takes longer and it will get very very hot in extended use.  It works but really not advised.\n\nA: Most switching power supplies are most efficient when operating at 50% capacity. And they're definitely pretty inefficient at less than 20% capacity.\nSince the MacBook draws less power than a MacBook Pro, I would suspect that an 85w power supply would work just fine, but the larger power supply for the MBP probably would draw more power from the wall socket than is necessary when connected to a MB because it is operating in a suboptimal capacity range.\nHere's an example: Take for example the 45w power supply for the MacBook Air. Sure you could hook up the 85w power supply, but since the MBA might only draw 20 watts, the power supply is operating at less than 25% capacity. At this capacity, the power supply may only be 60% efficient (an educated guess), that means the power supply has to draw 33 watts of AC power just to supply the laptop with 20 watts of DC power.\nLong story, short: It's a power conversion efficiency thing. I'd say buy the one that is designed for your laptop so that you save energy.\n", "Q: Why can't i activate facetime on my ipod touch i have a new ipod touch and i am on a wifi connection but whenever i try to use facetime i get this error:\n\"Can't connect to facetime, please check your network\"\n\nA: i found the answer.  you have to go into:\nSettings\nWIFI\nand click on your wireless router and change the DNS to 8.8.8.8\n", "Q: what is the best way to get my gmail contacts on my ipod touch contacts list i have a new ipod touch and i want to get my gmail contacts available on the ipod touch contacts.\nwhat is the best way to do this?\n\nA: iTunes offers this option in the sync panel out of the box, at least with an iPhone:  \n\nA: I am using Google Sync for this, it sets my Google Account up as an Exchange server so emails, calendars (multiple) and contacts are synced over the air.\nThere is a walk through on how to set this up on the Google help pages for the sync feature.\n", "Q: iTunes home sharing, between 2 iTunes accounts, but 2 way?

Whilst maintaining separate iTunes accounts?\n(I have only ever used home sharing to sync 2 libraries using the same iTunes account)\n\nA: You can use separate iTunes accounts, but the HomeSharing account must be the same. You will need to authorize each other's computers/devices with both iTunes accounts in order to play back content purchased under the other account.\n\nA: Yes this is the purpose of Home Sharing. I have the setup you describe above, which is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Two computers\n\n*Two user accounts\n\n*Two iTunes accounts\n\n\nThe result of setting up Home Sharing is that anything added to either account shows up on the other system.\n", "Q: when syncing with my ipod touch, why does itunes say \"optimizing photos\" even if nothing has changed .  every time i sync, i get a status saying \"optimizing photos . .1 of xx\".  this is even if no photos have changed since my last sync.\nwhat is going on here?  why does itunes keep trying to optimize photos every time i sync ?\n\nA: When you sync photos to an iPod or iOS device iTunes performs a set number of tasks, which include optimizing photos, if photos are selected to sync and to be optimized. iTunes doesn't cache the optimized photos, and if anything on the device has changed (like a contact, or some application data, basically anything) then it will sync all of the photos again, including optimizing them. \nBasically, it will do this every single time you sync, and there really isn't much you can do to stop it.

I have the 13\" Late 2010 MacBook Pro, and the 250 GB Hard Drive is way to small, so I'm looking to get a bigger one.\nI wanted to upgrade to a 750 GB WD Scorpio Blue (WD7500BPVT), but I've read reviews that say the Mac will constantly park the head and that I need an HDAPM fix or downgrade to a lower EFI.\nIs that because it's an Advanced Format (4k sectors) drive, or what causes this?\nIs there a good way to know if a hard drive is fully compatible or not? Is there any 640 or 750 GB Drive that works in the MBP without having to install fixes or anything like that?\n\nA: I read that the larger capacity (750Gb-1Tb) WD Scorpio Blue hard drives are physically a few mm's to thick to fit in MacBooks and MBP's. I cannot answer your question about the software compatibility but in regards to alternatives try this one, from OWC:\n750 GB 7200rpm Seagate\nHope some part of this helps.\n\nA: I have that exact disk (WD7500BPVT) in my late 2010 (bought it in September) 13\" Macbook Pro, and it fits fine. No EFI problems when installing, just replaced the disk, formatted it and installed OS X.\nExcessive head parking\nI experienced the excessive head parking problem with this disk.\nI resolved it by using the hdapm utility to set the disk's power saving settings to the least aggressive setting, which stopped the heads from parking, and it works just fine. \nI had the same issue (with a different disk) in Linux on my previous laptop; I did an equivalent fix, and it has worked fine for well over 3 years -- so I'm not worried about the disk, but had I known this before buying it I might have chosen a different disk.\nWhen I was googling around for a solution to this problem, I got the impressions that lots of disks behave this way, so I guess it's not just the WD Scorpio Blue. This is a very common issue with certain disks on Linux as well.\nAdvanced Format on OS X\nWD says this about their Advanced Format disks on OS X:\n\nMac OSX version 10.4 onwards (Tiger, Leopard and Snow Leopard) can use the GUID Partitioning Table scheme (GPT) which will align an Advanced Format drive correctly. Mac OS versions using Apple Partition Manager (APM) will not align partitions correctly and will not provide optimum performance.\n\nBasically; use GPT, and you're good.\n", "Q: 2nd Gen iPod (iOS4.x) using iPod keyboard Does anyone tried cramming a second gen iPod touch with iOS4 into the iPad keyboard sold by apple?  I've seen this but I'm not sure what the difference in architecture is between the iPhone that the Wired article is talking about and the iPod that I own.  \n\nA: The original article by Andy Ihnatko can be found here: The iPad Keyboard Dock works with the iPhone 3GS! According to one of the commenters there:\n\nThe iPad keyboard dock also works with my iPod touch 2G (8GB) running iOS4. Great!\n\nBut personally, I'm not sure how or why this would be a better solution than a Bluetooth keyboard.\n", "Q: Can I tag Faces on iOS using the iPhoto app? Is there a way to tag photos in the iPhoto library with Faces on iOS?\nSomething like a sequence of screens that just asks for confirmation like \"Is this John, yes/no\"?\n\nA: I'm afraid not. You can do places and whatnot from your i-device, but sadly no faces ability, although I have the feeling Apple will do it in the future. You can quite easily do it on iPhoto however. If you need any help in getting started at all in iPhoto, here's Apple's own support page: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=iPhoto/9.0/en/pht2297cf5f.html\nHope this helps. \n\nA: You can do it now, as of Ios 10: ios face tags\n\nA: This might do it - untested but found whilst Googling for another Ask Different question\nPhotoTime - Automatic Face Sorting & Keywords Tagging for Your Moments\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/phototime-automatic-face-sorting/id846435251?mt=8\n", "Q: Where can I get this iPad stand? I am not sure if my question is okay to post or not.\nI found a cheap, but simple and beautiful iPad stand on a korean website.\nhttp://www.funshop.co.kr/vs/detail.aspx?categoryno=1359&itemno=10516\n\ndescription says that it is from USA.\nI googled with its name 'easy ipad stand', but I could not find anything.\nanyone knows where to buy this product?\n\n\n\nA: That's not an iPad stand—it's just a cheap three wire display stand. It's the kind of stand that can display anything at all, which could include an iPad, I guess (although I'd want something a little more secure, personally). You should be able to get one at your local office supply store for $2-5.\nHere they are on Amazon at two for $5.65.\n\nA: Sorry, but from what it looks like the product is only available from this website. My only suggestions would be trawl eBay, or try and translate the page using google translate? Sorry I can't help anymore, but someone else may have found something?\n", "Q: List DHCP leases held from client Does Mac OS X Snow Leopard store complete information on the client DHCP leases it holds on Snow Leopard Server?  It is apparently not recorded in /var/log/system.log — although this information is logged here on Tiger.\nI can get the DHCP leases granted from sudo serveradmin fullstatus dhcp; this is the other end to what I want.\nThe issue arose when I managed to cripple the machine so that, while it was quite capable of accessing the local network, it couldn't play its part in receiving a fresh DHCP lease, and so the router wouldn't talk to it on any channel other than 80, isolating from anything outside the local network.  I fixed the issue by rolling back the state with Time Machine, but I'd like to know how to troubleshoot this issue in future.\nPostscript\nWhich it did, and being able to verify that no leases had been generated in the past week (by looking at the date of the leases directory in the output of ls -l /var/db/dhcpclient) was useful in debugging the situation, so kudos to Harv.  You can get more information on the individual leases by looking at ipconfig getpacket $INTERFACE, but not the date of when the last lease was issued/deleted.\nWhat happens is that the ipfw firewall was blocking the ports used by DHCP.  Switching off the firewall allows DHCP leases to be granted.  Now, why these ports were blocked is still a mystery to me.\n\nA: I don't think you can find lease information from the client end, I believe it's stored on the server end.  I don't quite understand, though, your predicament.  You managed to cripple your network connectivity somehow?\nTry /private/var/db/dhcpclient/leases.\n", "Q: Can I create an iTunes account without a credit card? I am trying to create a iTunes account for my younger cousin, but he does not have a credit card (he's too young). Tried Google, seems outdated on this issue.\n\nA: I seem to have found a method. First i open itunes, app store and click a free app, it will prompt me to sign in or create new acc. When i create new acc i can choose Nil as a payment option. Thanks for the other methods too. \n\nA: You must first go to iTunes store in iTunes then choose App Store, then select 1 free app (this is the most important steps) and try to get that app. When you try to download this free app iTunes ask you to enter your account so you must press Create New Account and fill the forms but in the Provide a Payment Method steps because you try to download free apps you see below form instead of normal form:\n\nYou must choose None for your Credit Card.\n\nA: Assuming you cannot use the tremendously easier method of a gift card, which Daniel Beck mentioned:\niTunes supports PayPal, so use a PayPal account.\nWhether you use/create your own account, your cousin's account or a dud account is up to you. The billing method can be changed later.\n\nA: As others have said, you can create an account by first trying to purchase a free app. This is also documented at Apple's own Knowledge Base:\nCreate an iTunes App Store account without a credit card\n(I found the link above in this question: How to activate new iPad without disclosing credit card number? )\n\nA: You can also create an account with an iTunes gift card. This has the added benefit of being able to purchase things after you set it up. If you ever want more money in your account balance, simply buy another \"gift\" card and redeem it to your account!\n", "Q: Making music CDs with ITunes I have 4 CDs I made from music tracks using iTunes and I was wondering if those are MP3 or some other format. Is it possible to read them with a non-MP3 player, such as a car CD player?\n\nA: If you create a playable CD with iTunes, then the software converts them to a format that can be played through any hi-fi or CD player and burns that to a disc. If it was a data CD you used, then that works in a similar way to a USB flash drive, just copying the files and burning them to a CD. These will not be playable in a CD player, but you can get the files off from a computer. \nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Can you tether via bluetooth? I would like my iPad to connect to the internet via a bluetooth modem (in this particular case, a Samsung Omnia with a more convenient pricing plan.)\nThe iPad has been bought full price and thus should be carrier unlocked. However, when I go Settings → Bluetooth and tap on the device name, the only available option is \"Ignore this device.\"\nIs there a way to make this happen?\n\nTo be crystal clear:\n                                   GPRS/EDGE/3G                 Bluetooth\n(Internets) - - - (Mobile Carrier) - - - - - -  (Samsung Omnia) - - - - - (iPad)\n\n\nA: I read on forum that one user managed to successfully tether his Omnia to an iPad via the WMWifiRouter, a program that turns the Omnia into a Wireless access point that the iPad can then connect to. I am nearly positive that this will not be able to be done over bluetooth, as the iOS and bluetooth are pretty restricted. Sorry I can't help with the BT issue, and I hope I have provided a decent alternative that you can work with. Cheers.\n\nA: For bluetooth tethering to work you need a device that support Bluetooth PAN profile. I did my own testing and crowdsourcing (it's in Russian) and it seems only Nokia S40 5th edition phones and above are relatively problem free (but not s60 ones).\nSE is hit and miss and Samsung as far as my sample goes is no-no.\nYou probably have a better luck with some kind of Wi-Fi AP done by app from that phone if it's Android or WM one.\n", "Q: On the iPad, is there a way to email a link to a mapped set of directions? Now that I have the directions from A to B, I want to mail them to a contact, ideally as a Google Map link.  I see no way to do so within the iPad Maps application, but maybe I am overlooking something.\n\nA: As far as I know there is no way to email a link to something you have got to inside a native iOS app, in your case, a set of instructions. I believe however that you can email a set of instructions as a link from the google maps website, which you can access in safari. Hope this helps in some form.\n\nA: I want to e-mail a link to a set of Google map directions from my iPad.  Go to Google maps via safari, and make sure you've got the 'classic' view as this has the print option on it.  Find your route, then press the 'print' option and then, on the iPad you've got the 'mail this link' option which sends a link to that printed page of directions.\n", "Q: What's the best way to import DVD into iMovie 11? My got a new Mac for Christmas and I'm trying to help her import a bunch of DVDs with home movies transferred from VHS into iMovie 11. \nGoogle turns up several results but most are trying to sell you an app to rip encrypted DVDs. Other results suggest using Disk Utility to copy the DVD into a .dmg file which iMovie would recognize as a camera it could import from, but that doesn't seem to work with the current version.\nI was able to use Handbrake to rip it to an MP4 and import that into iMovie but I'm curious if there's a more efficient way that avoids two transcodes and would be easier to explain to my mom.\n\nA: Not really, you've utilised the quickest, easiest and cheapest route available with doing it with Handbrake. Don't bother trying to find another piece of software that will do the job better, Handbrake is really the best when it comes to ripping and encoding Apple friendly formats. Thanks, hope this helps.\n\nA: Handbrake is free but not the most user friendly. Here is a great tutorial on using Handbrake: http://www.methodshop.com/gadgets/tutorials/handbrake/index.shtml\nMy personal favorite (for ripping movies for playback on your Mac) is MacDVDRipper Pro ( http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/31118/mac-dvdripper-pro) which actually rips the disk image to your Mac retaining the menus and extra features you might have on the DVD. Then you can mount the disk image on your Mac and use it like a \"virtual DVD\". This software is not free though.\n\nA: iMovie can import QuickTime movies, DV video and MPEG 4 video. What's in the VIDEO_TS folder is MPEG 2 video, so that's not on the iMovie list. There are several applications available that will convert video from a VIDEO_TS folder to one of the formats usable in iMovie. MPEG Streamclip is popular. Cinematize is designed for this. Toast and Popcorn 2 can do it.\nYou do not need to rip DVDs unless they are encoded with copy protection. So if these are DVDs you recorded you can just drag the VIDEO_TS folder to the hard drive to copy them and don't need another commercial product. I mention this because the main reason people use iMovie is for their home videos, not for editing movies from commercial DVDs.\n", "Q: Icon for iWeb published site? How can I use a favicon for my website that is published using iWeb?\n\nA: Unfortunately, there appears to be no way to create a favicon via the gui elements of iWeb. However, you are able to pretty simply add the html to the published version of your site.\nI recommend following this guide from All About iWeb. It walks you through how to first create the favicon using one of a variety of free online tools and then informs you where it needs be stored in your site's structure as well as the necessary html you need to add to your pages.\n\nA: Can you define what you mean by a \"personal icon\"?\nAre you referring to the image shown next to the URL in the address bar? That's called a favicon.\nOr do you mean an image on the web page itself that represents you/your site, such as the apple on the left-hand side of the menubar at the top of apple.com? That can be called any number of things (header graphic, home button, etc.), but it's just a normal graphic in png, jpg, or gif format.\n\nA: This article should be just the thing.\n", "Q: Mobile Me Family Pack Accounts: Do Sub-Accounts have their own syncing features? Merry Christmas.\nIn a MobileMe Family Pack, do the subaccounts have their own, independent syncing features (dock, bookmarks, etc - as seen in the MobileMe system preference?). \nI could really use the syncing features, but I don't need a full individual account. My brother has an individual account, and we were thinking of upgrading it to a family, so I could get the syncing features (I have a work mac, and a personal mac). \nThe Apple Website is a little vague on this:\n\nA Family Pack subscription includes one Individual account with 20GB of combined email and file storage, plus four Family Member accounts, each with its own email address and 5GB of storage. Convert an Individual account to a Family Pack anytime you like — you just pay the difference.\n\nI'm not sure whether to read it as 'a family pack is a glorified email account' or 'a family pack is a full mobile me account (with syncing features) but less space for each user'.\n\nA: Yes a family pack allows you to create 4 additional usernames that have all the features of the main account, the only difference being that they are limited to 5gb of storage.  I upgraded to a family pack and used one of the 4 additional accounts for my girlfriend so she could use Find My iPhone (before it was free with an AppleID) she can also sync her bookmarks, dock, prefs, etc just like my account.  \nThe only thing I am not 100% sure is if she can also create alias email addresses like I can on my main account but I believe she can.\n", "Q: Errors while syncing iPhone I did a restore on my iPhone 3GS running the latest 4.2.1 (after a failed attempt at jailbreaking).\nFor whatever reason the applications won't sync. For each of the apps it gives me an error:\nThe app \"iDivide\" was not installed on the iPhone \"iPhone\" because an unknown error occured (0xE8000001).\nI've shutdown and restarted the phone, all to no avail.  Everything else seems to sync fine (photos, podcasts, etc...).\nHow do I sync my apps? \n\nA: Many resources out on the web seem to suggest that 0xE8000001 occurs because of iTunes/associated daemons, not your device itself. Most folks report success after quitting iTunes, and using Activity Monitor to force quit the iTunes Helper, and any other process referencing iTunes, iPod/iPhone, etc.\nA blanket search for 0xE8000001 reveals most of these sources.\n\nA: This restore that you did, was it from a backup made pre-jailbreak or post-jailbreak? It may not matter but it always helps to isolate possible sources of errors.\nI know these are a bit of a generic set of tests, but have you tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleting and re-downloading a couple of apps to test if the app files have been corrupted?\n\n*Reinstalling iTunes, to test if the iTunes installation has been corrupted?\n\n*Set up the phone \"as a new phone\", to test if the backup is what is causing the sync error? If this doesn't work you can still go back to restoring from backup.\n\n\nIf none of those help, the more drastic options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete and re-download the IPSW file and re-restore the phone with the fresh IPSW, to test if the IPSW file on your computer has been corrupted.\n\n*Copy your iTunes Library to another computer, to test if iTunes + your computer is having problems (Reinstalling iTunes isn't quite as exact as a fresh install).\n\n*Move your iTunes Library to a temporary location, start iTunes and let it create a blank Library, download a few apps to test, then see if it syncs.\n\n\nA: VxJasonxV is correct about the error. Though normally the fault actually lies with Antivirus software on a Windows machine causing said daemon to fail.\nAlso: if a USB hub is being used, connect directly to the computer at try. The error is not consistent with that failure but it can cause problems.\n", "Q: Is it  possible to create a folder in iBooks? I have iPad and iPod touch. Both I bought just for reading books in pdf format.\nIf it is possible, I want to create some folders to separate the books based on categories I will define.\n\nA: Yes, as long as you're running the latest version.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap the button a the top of the bookshelf where it likely says \"Books\" (though it might say \"PDFs\") -- this is the Collections button.\n\n*Tap \"New\" to add a new collections folder with a name of your choice.\n\n*Tap the \"Books\" collection and you'll see all of your books. \n\n*Tap the \"Select\" button in the upper-right corner, then tap on all of the books you want to move into a collection.\n\n*Tap \"Move\" and select the collection you want to move the books into. \nPoof, they're now out of the default \"Books\" collection and now in the collection you chose.\n\nA: Yes, with the latest iBooks it is possible to create your own categories of books. When in your iBooks library on the iPod, tap the middle button at the top, it will probable read Books or PDFs, to create/edit your categories. The same functionality is found by tapping the Categories button on the iPad iBooks. \nOnce you have the categories you want, you can move books into them by tapping the Edit button in the library view, tapping the books to select them and then tap the Move button. Select the category you want, and press done. \nYou can then switch between categories from the same screen that you created them.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 - bad proximity sensor? I think the proximity sensor in my iPhone 4 is out of order.\nNearly every time when I use the phone to place/receive calls, suddenly the mic mutes itself, or the speakerphone turns on, or a call starts on the second line -- but I am not doing this! I am merely holding the phone up to my ear (in a quite normal way). This was never a problem on my iPhone 3G.\nIt seems to me that the proximity sensor isn't sensitive enough and turns on the touch screen sometimes. I've heard that there used to be problems with that back on iOS 3, but I've been running 4.1 since it came out and the problem remains.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way to check if my suspicion is right?\n\n*Can I do something to fix this myself? Is there a fix in iOS 4.2.1?\n\n*Do I have to go to an Apple shop and wait phonelessly for weeks while they send it to the factory?\nNote: I'm in Austria, we don't have Apple Stores.\n\n\nI feel forced to use the headset in order to avoid these problems. While that has some advantages, it's not always practical, and anyway I want this fixed. Here is just one of the stories about this; so I think I'm not alone. \n<rant>It's a #¤%! expensive phone and it better work.... I'm asking here rather than the Apple support site though because that other site has so few answers but page after page full of screaming people.\n\nA: The proximity sensor was fixed in iOS 4.2.1, and people in Apple Support forums confirm it works.\nhttp://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=12630060\n", "Q: Tidy up iTunes library? I am trying to do a spring clean on my iTunes library. I have around 500 songs that are tagged incorrrectly. The Name is in the format '11 Artist - Song Name'. Is there any quick way of extracting this and retagging the files without manually editing each of them?\nCheers\n\nA: You could possibly write an AppleScipt to go through selected tracks, and change the name that way, but you would have to make sure you only select the ones in that format. \nIve had to do this a few times before, and have tried various apps, but usually end up just digging in and doing it manually. While it takes time, I can give a lot more care to each thing, espc. artwork and genre at the same time. I usually just take a night and go through everything in groups (like artists starting with an A, then a B, etc). \n\nA: Four suggestions of apps I've used in the past. Only one of them is free (and go figure that one isn't exactly iTunes-friendly, not easily anyways).\n\n\n*\n\n*Pollux - Pollux was featured on net@nite (Amber MacArthur and Leo Laporte), and subsequently died off for months due to illegally using various APIs from services like (IIRC) MusicIP, GraceNote, and other big name commercial music vendors. After negotiating agreements with companies that could provide plenty of helpful information, they re-launched the product with a 20 song tag trial, and unlimited tagging for $10. I believe this is the cheapest app that integrates as well as it does into iTunes.\nIt's UI is geared heavily towards albums, wherein you select all the tracks in an album, then click the Pollux icon in the menu bar, and then click \"Tag\". It goes about it's business pulling information, cover art, and more (where possible), then does it's work. Updating your music with pretty information.\nAfterward, you won't re-live this terrible memory.\n\n*TuneUp - TuneUp is similar to Pollux, except it's a bit... obnoxious. It runs as a separate app that shrinks iTunes and places itself it the far right of it, like an even more annoying sidebar than Ping. Again, choose your song(s), tell it to \"Clean Up\", and off it goes searching the internet for all the same information you want to make your information clean as a whistle.\nYou can buy TuneUp for $20 for a year (warning: automatically renewing), or $30 for life.\n\n*Song Genie - I'm actually quite a big fan of the Song Genie and Cover Scout duo, perhaps solely because it's UI/UX is ahead of it's curve. You open the app and you get to work. TuneUp is too small and has too few options for checking the details of the data, and Pollux is one-shot (though it allows you to rollback the last action, thankfully).\nSong Genie uses fingerprinting to identify the song and pull in data. It works very nicely with the iTunes Library, or even any arbitrary folder on your drive. It \"rates\" your data, and can fill in the gaps marvelously well (lyrics where you had none previously despite having plenty of other information). With a large, attractive, simple interface, it's actually pretty easy to whip through tagging in a quick manner (subject to the CPU speed of fingerprinting, and your internet connection for searching). Unfortunately, this dream team duo is expensive. $30 for Song Genie, and $40 for Cover Scout.\nI note also their site says \"Your Special Price\", so there may be some sort of active deal at the time of writing.\n\n*MusicBrainz Picard - Picard is in a class all it's own. It doesn't integrate alongside iTunes well, and it's UX flow is god awful. However, if you want absolute control in tagging, nearly the experience of manually writing tags, with just a bit of assistance to make sure you're doing it right, Picard cannot be beat. (And yes, this is a good thing.)\nPicard is not at all hands off, unlike the majority use cases of the rest of the apps, but this makes it awfully better for more niché releases, and bonus: If it can't find something, do the work and contribute back to the MusicBrainz community! We'd be glad to have you as long as you follow the rules and contribute responsibly.\nPicard is free, no ads, no account required unless you want to contribute, and I highly suggest you use the Intel-only -NX version, unless of course you don't have an Intel CPU Mac.\n\nA: As noted by others This can be done by an AppleScript.\nLuckily for iTubes there is a collection of scripts to do things with iTunes Doug's AppleScripts for iTunes and for your particular case look at tag script or others\n\nA: Try Jaikoz. It is a tool for identifying and tagging songs.\nIt doesn't use the name of the file or the tags for that. It \"listens\" for the song and generates an \"id\" for it (search for MusicId in Wikipedia), then searches for that id in MusicBrainz (a giant music database, with better tags than cddb or Gracenotes).\nThe GUI isn't terribly appealing, tough.\nThe benefit of Jaikoz is that it doesn't use the metadata already in the file, that could be wrong. MusicBrainz has very high standard for its tags and is strongly curated.\n\nA: What I would suggest is select original tracks by album, one album at a time, and then find the option to 'Get Track names' or something to that effect and click it. That should work, and then move on to the next album. Then, if you have an iTunes account you can 'get album artwork' for even more organisation. Hope this helps in some way.\n", "Q: What's a good iOS app for quickly posting screenshots on the web? Something analogous to photobucket for the desktop - whose iPhone app is a bit useless to me because it doesn't enable importing from the camera roll. I'm looking for something that easily allows me to share a screenshot (to embed somewhere, for example in a forum, or on a Stack Exchange question) but don't want to junk up my flickr, Instagram, etc.\n\nA: There's also the official Flickr app. It supports uploading photos and videos from the Camera Roll. Flickr specifically will require that you already have an account on the service, most Twitter integrated networks (yFrog, TwitPic) will \"create\" an account when you use it for the first time.\nFlickr the site.\nFlickr.app the iOS app.\n(Native to iPhone only, obviously works on the iPad using small screen emulation.)\n\nA: If you don't want to \"junk up\" your flickr or instagram or whatever, you could just create another flickr or twitter account only for screenshots. Then you could use these specialized account settings in Flickit or Photoshop Express or whatever.\nYou could also use Dropbox. I love it for syncing files, and it easily works with images too.\n\nA: If you have twitter, Echofon uploads pics from the camera roll to Twitpic very quickly. Otherwise, the Flickr iOS app works very well, and you can select any pic/screenshot from your library to upload. Thanks, Hope that helps. \n\nA: I like the ImgurFree app.  You can take a photo or import one from a Camera Roll.  It uploads the photo to imgur and creates a link that you can quickly copy the link in your clipboard or post directly to Reddit, or Email it.  Works great for me. It also keeps a history of all the images uploaded using the phone which you can quickly delete from Imgur site if you want.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for toggling between Fn and F keys Is there a keyboard shortcut for toggling between Function and classic F keys?\n\nA: There is now an app for this: https://github.com/Pyroh/Fluor\nIt lets you specify the fn key behaviour depending on a rules engine, and also switches between one behaviour and the other when you press the fn key.\n\nA: You can create application specific shortcuts by creating a custom setting in your private.xml file. Check out the reference documentation for details, or my example below where I'm rebinding the Consumer keys back to Function keys when in PhpStorm (to use the debugger).\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n    <!-- PhpStorm & EAP Version -->\n    <appdef>\n        <appname>PHPSTORM</appname>\n        <equal>com.jetbrains.PhpStorm-EAP</equal>\n        <equal>com.jetbrains.PhpStorm</equal>\n    </appdef>\n    <!-- ============================================================ -->\n    <item>\n        <name>Switch to normal function keys when in PhpStorm</name>\n        <appendix>Change consumer keys to function keys in PhpStorm</appendix>\n        <identifier>private.app_phpstorm_switch_consumer_to_fn</identifier>\n        <only>PHPSTORM</only>\n        <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_DOWN, KeyCode::F1</autogen>\n        <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_UP, KeyCode::F2</autogen>\n        <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::EXPOSE_ALL, KeyCode::F3</autogen>\n        <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::LAUNCHPAD, KeyCode::F4</autogen>\n        <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_KEYBOARDLIGHT_LOW, KeyCode::F5</autogen>\n        <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_KEYBOARDLIGHT_HIGH, KeyCode::F6</autogen>\n        <autogen>__KeyToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_PREV, KeyCode::F7</autogen>\n        <autogen>__KeyToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_PLAY, KeyCode::F8</autogen>\n        <autogen>__KeyToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_NEXT, KeyCode::F9</autogen>\n    <!-- I want to use these while in PhpStorm\n        <autogen>__KeyToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_MUTE, KeyCode::F10</autogen>\n        <autogen>__KeyToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_DOWN, KeyCode::F11</autogen>\n        <autogen>__KeyToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_UP, KeyCode::F12</autogen>\n    -->\n    </item>\n</root>\n\n\nA: Depending on what you're trying to do, you may be able to cut out the keyboard shortcuts altogether and completely automate this.  KeyRemap4MacBook allows you to set key re-mappings based on what application you're currently using.  \nI am using a setting that switches F1 through F12 to standard Function keys whenever I'm using RDC (Windows Remote Desktop).  Any other time they operate like their icons (brightness, volume, play, etc).\n\nA: There might be an easier way, but the following comes to mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on Universal Access.\n\n*Create an AppleScript or Automator App that toggles this via the UI.\n\n*Bind that app to a key combo.\n\n\nA: I‘d suggest you try FNable. FNable will switch the behavior for the active application, when you tell it to. The next time you activate this application, FNable will automatically switch your function keys.\nThat way you can use brightness/volume controls in most of the apps you are using and you can use the function keys in those apps where you need to.\nNo configuration needed, switching behavior is just a matter of a single click.\nIf you want to use a global hotkey to toggle the function keys, FNable supports that, too.\n\nA: This can be done natively with no 3rd party software needed by opening System Preferences -> Keyboard, and then check/uncheck the box that says \"Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\". If checked, the keys act as F keys, if unchecked, they act as the system control keys, such as screen brightness, volume controls, etc. (I can't think of a better way to describe them).\nSource:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204436\n\nA: i know this is an old question, but what helped me that i didnt find here is using fn + esc. this toggles between using F keys and the media keys.\n", "Q: Can I use Apple Earphones with Mic on Mac Mini? I read on Apple website that Mac mini audio port supports the apple earphones with mic. Does it support the mic as well? Can I use the mic for Audio input on applications like Skype?\nI tried plugging it in but the audio input did not work...\nUpdate: Here's the apple website where its written that Support for Apple iPhone headset with microphone is there. Mac Mini Specs Page\nUpdate: I think I've got what the problem is. The specs page I referred to above is about the latest Mac Mini. What I have is the Mac Mini mid 2007 model. I checked its specs and there is nothing about support of Apple earphones with mic. I think this is the reason its not working.\nRegards\n\nA: You cannot directly plug your headphones into the Audio Input jack and have it work, because, the microphone/button signal rides on the third ring, and the audio input jack only connects the first two. You have to have specially designed hardware to connect to that third ring. This is currently achieved via the Headphone/Audio Output ports of devices.\nOnly the iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad, 2010 MacBook Pros, and the modern body (smaller height) Mac Minis are the only pieces of hardware I am aware that do. Anything older will not support the microphone/button/volume buttons at all.\n\nA: Have you tried plugging it into the headphone jack?\nSounds screwy, I know, but I think that's the answer.\n\nA: If the website or documentation explicitly states that it supports 'Apple Earphones with Mic' or something to that effect while still mentioning the mic, then yes, you should be able to use then as you would on an iPhone, in Skype or whatever. HOWEVER if they don't work in the input port then they will not work at all I didn't think that any other devices except the MBP and the iOS devices worked with them. Sorry.\n\nA: I had the same issue and had to use an adapater. I've found this one.\n(just for info, I'm not affiliated in any way with the site).\nI suppose you can find other brand and stores providing the same type of adapters.\nEdit: It seems not to be possible with \"normal\" headset mic but they state clearly that the Apple headset is compatible. How would it be amplified?\nStrange for our mic, I'll have to check at the office how we are using this then. I'm confused now :-/ I know we also have amplified mic and we probably went this way then... Sorry for the wrong info.\n", "Q: How do I completely start over with an iPhone? After a botched attempt at jailbreaking, then removing the jailbreak, half the stuff does not work on the iPhone (apps won't sync, iPod app crashes, Settings don't \"take\", sync freezes the phone for 5 minutes after iTunes says its done, etc...).  \nI'd like to start over.  I will re-download the apps manually and sync all my photos, addresses, etc... after the fact.\nSo how do I start over?  I guess, if this was a PC, I'd be asking how to reformat the hard drive. \n\nA: Does iTunes recognize your iPhone? If so, you can start (non-jailbroken), by just going to the Summary page when its plugged in and selecting restore. \n\nA: You could put your phone into recovery mode by turning it off, then plugging it in to your computer while holding down the home button. All the data on your phone will be completely erased.\n", "Q: What are the radii of the iOS icon corners? What are the radii of the iOS icon corners at the various sizes?\n\nA: There are a variety of iOS icon templates available for free on the web—the best I've seen so far is from The Hicksenian—that will offer up this information (and possibly even obviate the need to know entirely). There is even a (very) short discussion about the corner radii. A quick search for ios icon template will return a lot of similar results.\n", "Q: Can iTunes combine identical podcasts? Somewhat similar to this question, but I don't just want to import.  I have a bunch of This American Life podcasts that I downloaded using iTunes on another computer.  I also have a This American Life podcast subscription on my current Mac with a bunch of podcasts downloaded.  \nI have already imported the old ones into iTunes.  They show up as two separate podcasts, with the same name and metadata.  The old ones have a \"subscribe\" link but I haven't clicked it, they're just sitting there.  The new ones are subscribed and regularly downloading new episodes.\nHow can I merge the old ones into the newer, subscribed version of the podcast in iTunes?\n\nA: This has been bugging me for years, most specifically with This American Life and To The Best of Our Knowledge.\nThe tag that's causing them to be separated is not available via iTunes -- you need an extended tag editor. On the Mac, I used ID3 Editor. \nInstructions specifically for ID3 editor:\n• Open a \"good\" podcast file (you can drag it straight from iTunes onto the ID3 Editor icon in the dock to open). \n• Click on the Podcast tab. Look for the field called Feed (It may have a different name if you're using different tag editing software). Copy the Feed field contents.\n• Open your \"bad\" podcast files, paste/replace the \"good\" Feed info into the Feed field (they should be different - mine were) and click Update.\n• Last important step is that you have to delete the \"bad\" files from iTunes and reimport them. If you right click or control click the file in iTunes before deleting, and select \"Show in Finder,\" the enclosing folder will open. If you sort by date modified, all the podcast you just updated should be at the top, if they're in the same folder. Then you can delete all the bad ones, and drag them back into iTunes. Whey they're re-imported, they should now be grouped with the \"good\" podcast.\n\nA: Select 'em all, and go to File-> Get Info. If any usual fields are blank, this means that they vary among the selected tracks. If it should be the same, type in the right value.\nThis procedure almost always fixes this kind of a problem.\n\nA: Follow-up on what Nathan G. said: sometimes, it helped me when I checked fields that were filled in to overwrite these values, so not only the empty fields, but title and album as well (probably all fields but title would be fine).\nAlso, as a last resort, all metadata for each podcast are written in /Users/YOUR_USER_ID/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music Library.xml. Search for your podcasts and make sure that they have identical data (all white-spaces count!).\n", "Q: What's the differences between the iPod Touch calendar and the iPhone calendar? What's the differences between the iPod Touch calendar and the iPhone calendar?\n\nA: There is no difference. What makes you think there is?\n\nA: Assuming you are running the same version of iOS, there should be absolutely no difference whatsoever. \n", "Q: Why is Firefox randomly reopening itself after quitting? I've had a strange problem that's been bugging me for awhile.  It seems that every couple times I quit Firefox, it will reopen itself automatically.  Basically:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'll hit cmdq\n\n*Firefox will shut down\n\n*the little 'open' light underneath its icon in the dock will disappear\n\n*suddenly the FF icon will start bouncing and it will open back up\n\n\nUsually when this happens, my previous session will appear to be loading but all the tabs will stay blank.  However, this is not always the case, sometimes my tabs will load.  Another thing I just noticed is that after it reopens, Firefox is 'hidden' (like when you click 'Hide Firefox' from the main menu) until I click on it.  \nIf I quit FF a second time, it stays closed.  The next time I open FF, my original session will be restored and everything works normally.\nThis has happened on two different Macs for me, and my wife has occasionally seen this behavior as well.  Any ideas on what might be happening, and has anyone else had this happen?\n\nA: I had the same problem ! I downloaded version 3.5 for mac & it works fine for me now.\nPlease Take Note of following.\nEven in FireFox version 3.5, I faced a strange behavior.\nWhen I try to open a new tab sometimes it goes adding new tabs in bulk, I mean infinite loop of adding new tab. In that case, I used to quit fireFox by force. ( force-Quit ).\nIt happens quite frequently, even though I couldn't determine the exact steps to produce that bug. So, If you face same kind of behavior, please let me know by comments.  \n", "Q: Enable 3-finger swipe for home and end in Chrome 3-finger left and right swipes on my trackpad work in Chrome.  They take me back one page in my history or right one page.  However, 3-finger up and down swipes does not appear to be implemented.\nIn Firefox and many other applications, an up or down swipe works the same way as hitting the home or end keys, respectively.\nIs there any extension, application, or tweak that will enable this functionality in Google Chrome?\n\nA: Something that may be of interest is Chrome does support 3 finger swipe down, but it's semi-hidden; and not what you're looking for. But it's way cool. The way to access it is by simply typing about:flags into your address bar. You'll see the option at the top. It's called:\nTab Overview:\nSwipe down with three fingers on your trackpad to see an overview of all your tabs. Click on a thumbnail to select it. Works great in fullscreen mode.\nSo this suggests that they will not be doing what you would like them to do. It would obviously conflict with Tab Overview. So you should look into an app like JiTouch if you want to get more customized gesture support. It will do what you're looking for.\nMy guess is that Google's next step will be to map fullscreen to 3 finger swipe up; especially given the emphasis Lion will be putting on fullscreen mode apps.\n\nA: BetterTouchTool is the answer!\nYou can get it from here. It helps you configure all gestures globally or for a specific application. It also includes some special gestures not embedded by default on Mac OS.\nWith gestures, I can scroll through tabs, reload page, close tab, go up and down.\nIt works for the macbook trackpad, the Magic Mouse and the magic Trackpad.\nA bliss ;)\n", "Q: Is there an iPhone dock with a headset jack? Does anyone know of a dock for an iPhone that has standard usb data/power, but also a headset jack (not just speaker / headphones output)?\n\nA: I wonder what is that for, if it's to connect to a stereo, the jack on the Universal Dock is more than enough.\n\nIf the idea is to use the phone to answer calls while in the dock, I would strongly suggest a Bluetooth set as that's what they are made for. You will find plenty on the Apple Store as well.\n\nA: The biggest problem you face here is the fact that you want to use your phone, as a phone, while in a dock.\nFirst problem:\nMany docks are \"not compatible\" with the iPhone, they don't have GSM noise filters on their speakers, so if you dock it and listen to music, you get that god awful chirping when the GSM radio starts going.\nSecond problem:\nThose that are, make data connections, not line-out connections! The only way to fulfill this request is;\n\n\n*\n\n*if the chosen dock connects not only via data, but ALSO via the headphone jack, and;\n\n*that connection is a triple-ring connection, just like the iPhone headphones. Note that you're highly unlikely to find this, because docks are for data/playing audio (which can be accomplished via the audio jack), the \"dock your phone and use the computer as a gateway to phone functions\" use case is, unfortunately, not present.\n\n\nThird problem:\nThe iPhone is too smart. A while back I was driving with my phone plugged into a line-in port on my car (for music), and I was received a phone call. I had guests in the car, all friends, and figured I would just let the conversation take place via the car stereo, and turn on speaker so the other part could adequately hear me. No such luck. When not on speaker, the call came out of the ear piece only, when on speaker, the call came out of the speaker ports. The iPhone will only use the headphone port for a call if it has a microphone attached.\nBluePhone Elite was an option for this (with serious caveats), but it never had terribly good support for the iPhone. Only because of the limitations imposed by Apple. And, apparently BPE is dead now? What a shame. That was a good app for many many other phones.\nI'm (unfortunately) very confident in saying that you will have a very hard time finding this dream product of yours, and you're better off simply plugging your own headset into the headphone port, or like balexandre suggested, pair a Bluetooth headset. A product like you want will invariably not pass Apple Certification, which means you will not easily find it in any mainstream store (not only Apple Stores, but BestBuy and it's ilk).\n", "Q: iPhone application to edit text files I need to edit some local text files on my iPhone but so far, all the apps I have downloaded do not navigate the OS3 file tree for me to open, edit and save them.\nI need to do this on my iPhone as I can no longer access it via ssh or with the iPhone cable. One of the files I want to edit is an ssh config file which is what is not allowing ssh connections.\nAny suggestions of applications or other simple methods that I could use?\n\nA: You can do this with iFile.\nThis application will let you browse the local file system.\nLocate your config file, then open it using the built-in Text Viewer\n(it also has viewers/players for other file formats such as PDF or MP3).\nDespite the name the Text Viewer will actually let you edit and save the file.\n\nA: Try this https://apps.apple.com/it/app/pretext/id1347707000 that won’t require jailbreak\n", "Q: Group running apps in OS X? Since I'm working on several projects that require different resources (shells, files, Chrome windows, etc.), I'd like to organize them better.\nIs there a Mac utility or something that will allow me to group a bunch of app windows together to represent a specific task?  \nFor instance I can group Chrome window, Finder window, shell into one group (this would be one project), and then a bunch of those into another group, etc.\n\nA: An out-of-the-box possibility would be to use Spaces to define applications to go to a specific screen on launch, and navigate between Spaces (Virtual Desktops) as a whole.\nNote, however, that you will have a conflict if you want the Finder to be in two places at once :). Your only option is one specific Space, or globally across all Spaces.\n\nA: As @VxJasonxV wrote, Spaces is the solution.\nIf you want a bigger sandbox, you could probably run a dozen VMs if you had a desktop with 32GB or so of RAM.

But none of the ways to do this that I can find works, for various reasons. One reason common to all is that I can't stop the mysql deamon.\nAs I understand it, I should be able to stop it with\nsudo launchctl stop org.macports.mysql5\n\nWhich makes absolutely no difference. No error message, nothing. Is launchd really this sucky, or do I misuse it? Reasonably it should give me an error when it fails, but nope, nothing.\nTrying to kill the processes with kill -9 just makes them restart again, so that doesn't work either.\nI also tried \nsudo launchctl unload org.macports.mysql5\n\nBut that gives me this error:\nlaunchctl: Couldn't stat(\"org.macports.mysql5\"): No such file or directory\n\n(And I must confess I don't understand what \"Unload configuration files and/or directories\" means, which is what the Unload command apparently does according to the little docs I can find).\nSo, what now?\n\nA: The correct answer is \nsudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.mysql5.plist\n\nAnd you start it with \nsudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.mysql5.plist\n\nThanks to kh13org for the pointer.\n", "Q: iPhoto gets stuck on finishing last import I have this problem where iPhoto gets into a state where it won't quit, and won't let me import anything.

It’s a small detail that, if you come from Windows (or Linux) turns out to be of great help (provided you really care about improving your typing skills). Available on most Cocoa applications by default (thanks to the underlying technology), it underlines incorrect words and obvious grammar errors. It has its bad days, but the results are usually better than nothing. I type mainly in English and Spanish and in both cases, it’s a decent solution. \nBut I just realized that I have a problem with it. I rarely use the mouse when I’m in “Type Mode”. If I’m writing I don’t need to use the mouse. I just don’t use it; I manage to perform most of what I have to with the keyboard and its shortcuts. \nThere are notable exceptions to the above (where a dialog requires mouse action, or there’s simply no way to get the focus of a particular UI element). Those exceptions are annoying (and frequent), but I guess I already deal with them (by grabbing the mouse and killing a kitten). \nHowever, there’s one that I’d like to know how to solve, and maybe the minds behind the site can clear for me. \nImagine the following simple scenario. TextEdit. \nYou start typing this: \n\nIn order to fix the misspelled word, you have a few choices with your mouse, or you could use the ⇧Shift⌘Cmd: combination to bring this:\n\nHowever that dialog doesn’t have keyboard focus and I am unable to get it, so I have to reach the mouse, click on it, and fix the problem. That’s not good.\nWhat I want is to be able to bring this:\n\n…with my keyboard. \nThat menu came when I right clicked on the word. \nHow do you deal with this? Do you use the mouse? Do you use the keyboard?\nEnlighten me please. \nUPDATE FOR LION OS X 10.7\nAs many of you are aware, OS X 10.7 \"Lion\" is out and it brings some changes in this area. Sadly, the biggest complain is still not 100% fixed.\nThe good news is, it is \"possible\" to spell check using the keyboard only, although we still don't have a nice popup like the \"right click\" over an underlined word. \nThe Spell Check pane can be focused now by using ⌃F6 if it loses focus, but has it by default when you invoke it with ⇧⌘:, this allows you to invoke it over a red-underlined word and press ⏎ to change the word (or TAB to focus the list of alternatives and then ⏎ to change it)… but not really because…\n…the Bad news is, if I make a mistake right here and I try to bring the spell check, it will go to the next mistake, not the word I have below the cursor, which is annoying, because it means you have to actually go back with the cursor before invoking the spell checker. \nAlso there are no shortcuts on the Grammar Pane, so you have to TAB around the fields to click anything other than \"Change\". The order of the options is also weird:\n1) Upon launching Grammar Pane, focus is on Change for \"return\" but you are ready to start typing a replacement if you want. So you could type the \"right word\" and press return, or you could press return to accept the first replacement on the list, or you could press TAB to move to that list, select a new one (with the arrow keys) and finally press return to accept it.\n2) If you wanted to move to the next change without accepting anything for the current word, you need to press TAB four times and then the space bar to click on find next. \n3) Focus is one way, if you reach the last option in that dialog, it won't cycle back to the first option, so you have to shift-tab back in the focus chain. (weird?)\n4) You can't focus the Define, Guess or Automatic by Language Buttons/Combo boxes, unless you grab your mouse. \n5) You can dismiss the panel by pressing escape.\nFinally, going from \"mistake to mistake\" is achieved with ⌘;; this will jump from red underlined word to the next in a cycle.\n\nA: Yo ! Man, I got the best thing for you.\nJust type some of your characters of word & press F5 & see the magic, It is what you want. Suppose your not getting the word rub some & get what you want.\nHere is snap-shot of what you want.

It will give you list on the spot.\n\n\nA: I just went through Apple's Keyboard Shortcuts Document and really didn't fine anything meaningful. I picked some of the more vague ones and tried them out in TextEdit to no avail.\nWhile I don't want this to be the answer, my current idea is to use Mouse Keys, as silly as it is to say. Activating the shortcut via Universal Access.prefpane, then quint (five)-tapping Option ⌥, then you should be able to call up the window by either;\n\n\n*\n\n*holding (with a numpad) 5 (without a numpad) i, or;\n\n*pressing (with a numpad) 0 (without a numpad) m.\n\n\nThe context window should pop-up, and you can select the correct spelling/action as you desire, and move on... after you disable Mouse Keys with the same shortcut, that is.

Recently, I have realized that its battery usage is abysmal. Suspecting that it has something to do with the radio, I downloaded Data Counter from Cydia to check real-time data usage and found that even with push notifications off and exchange set to manual, there is a persistent 0.06kb/s of data transfer.

I am keeping it accepted for historical reasons, but all readers using Mavericks should use and up-vote this answer.\n\nBy default, pressing ⌘+tab will display a list of all open applications.  I would like that list to only include applications in the current space, or at least give priority to applications with windows in the current space.  In other words, I'd like OS X to mimic the behavior of most X window managers with respect to their workspaces/virtual desktops.\nHere's my rather long-winded explanation of why I want this:\nI have disabled spaces' auto-switching, and I've mapped each space to a ⌘+space # shortcut.  In general, I usually have one application open per space, maximized.  Since I really only ever have a half-dozen or so applications open at any time, I can easily switch between them in constant time with my left hand.  The problem is that I sometimes do have two or three windows from different applications open in the same space (e.g., I often have a PDF reader open in the same space as my web browser).   Let's say I have a terminal open in Space 1 and both a web browser and Preview open in Space 2.  If I am in the terminal and then decide I want to open a web page, I switch to Space 2, where the web browser has focus.  I then want to consult a PDF that is open in Preview, which is in the same Space but whose window is behind the web browser.  If I hit ⌘+tab, however, the first option will be to take me back to Terminal in Space 1 (since Terminal most recently had focus).  In the worst case, I will have to cycle through all n open applications by repeatedly pressing ⌘+tab in order to get to Preview.  I want the first hit to ⌘+tab to bring me to the next application with windows in the current space, i.e., Preview.\nI know that using Exposé is the more \"Apple\" way of handling these situations, but I want to avoid having to reach for the mouse.  I know I can also use the arrow keys to select a window in Exposé, but once again that breaks my mental model of the window layering, will institute a cognitive feedback loop in the selection, and will require worst case log(n) keystrokes.   As far as I know, there is no constant-time way of switching to a specific application in the current workspace using only the keyboard.\n\nA: control+F4.  Cycles through the applications in that Space.\n (I actually have this mapped to control+`; which I find easier to remember, being close to the cmd+`; to cycle through an application's windows.)\nTo change the keyboard shortcut, go to the Keyboard preferences, Keyboard Shortcuts, and Keyboard & Text Input.  It's the 'Move focus to active or next window' option.\n(Edit to fix the keyboard shortcuts; I didn't realise that the backtick character wasn't showing up.)\n\nA: I'm the author of the Command-Tab Plus application which allows you to quickly switch between applications, and additionally between windows (using MacOS's cmd+tilde ability). Here's a demo on YouTube.\n\nA: Yosemite\nThis behavior can be mapped to your desired key combination like so:\n\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Keyboard > Move focus to active\n  or next window\n\nMavericks\n^F4 does switch through windows in the current space but you may have to upgrade to Yosemite to map this behavior to ^~.\nBut the problem can still be alleviated like so:\n\nSystem Preferences > Mission Control > Uncheck \"When switching to an\n  application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application\"\n\n\nA: As an aside to this answer, I've been able to remap control+F4 to alt+tab, which feels quite natural imo.\n\nA: I found the open source app alt-tab-macos does exactly what OP wants: Providing an app switcher for apps on the current desktop only.\nIt also works well for full screen / minimized / hidden windows as well as across multiple display situations where Mission Control and macOS work more on spaces as opposed to separate displays.\n\nA: Pressing ⌃F4 will do what you're asking for, but you might get carpal tunnel in the process.\nJust from reading your example, it sounds like you may actually be looking for ⌘⇧⇥, which cycles through applications in reverse order, thus cutting the number of times you press ⇥ in half. \nGranted, that's not be a constant time solution, but I think you'll find that the result of ⌘⇥ is the application you want to focus on 70% of the time, and  ⌘⇧⇥ is the application you want to focus on 28% of the time.\n\nA: One powerful tool is hammerspoon.\nFrom its webpage:\n\nThis is a tool for powerful automation of OS X. At its core, Hammerspoon is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine. What gives Hammerspoon its power is a set of extensions that expose specific pieces of system functionality, to the user.\n\nUsing hs.window.switcher one just adds (as mentioned in the docs) to the init.lua\nswitcher_space = hs.window.switcher.new(hs.window.filter.new():setCurrentSpace(true):setDefaultFilter{})\nhs.hotkey.bind('alt','tab','Next window',function()switcher_space:next()end)\nhs.hotkey.bind('alt-shift','tab','Prev window',function()switcher_space:previous()end)\n\nand one can happily switch between windows in the current space using alt+tab and alt+shift+tab.\nIf you like Lua scripting, you can extend the tool easily. Moreover, there are numerous plugins, called spoons, available. See also official hammerspoon spoons.\n\nA: After trying many options I went for Contexts which costs 10$.\nYou can configure it so that cmd-tab shows only…\n\n*\n\n*application of current space (see command-tab setting show windows from \"visible spaces\")\n\n*hide some windows (\"background\" apps such as VPN to which I don't need to switch to)\n\nIt organizes the icons in a list (vertically) instead of the default horizontal layout, which I needed to adapt to, but on the other side it also let's you search through all open apps with ctrl-space and there the list layout is beneficial.\n\nA: I know Hyperswitch didn't exist when that question was asked, but it is a modern answer to that question, and it is much better than hacking with Karabiner (formerly KeyRemap4MacBook) and/or struggling with the system preferences (since they don't accept any key mapping for every command).\nPlease see https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/127414 and upvote it if you find HyperSwitch useful.\n\nA: You can try with Switché. They pretend that \"Switché works great with Spaces and is able to display Space number badges\".  As I'm not using Spaces I cannot confirm nor infirm but it's worth the try.\nSee comments below.\n\nA: Although this doesn't technically answer the original question, those here looking for a more configurable Cmd-Tab app switcher could look at\nSuperTab .\nDisclaimer: I bought this and it think it's well done.\n\nA: for those searching where that keyboard shortcut is located:\n\nI've mapped mine to option + tab\n", "Q: Is it possible to purchase music on an iPhone without iTunes?

I'm planning on installing Windows on my Mac, and would like to be able to use both Boot Camp (for when I need to be able to use all of the hardware of the computer) and a virtual machine (for those times when I don't want to restart).\nI noticed that both VMWare Fusion and Parallels allow you to set up a virtual machine which uses the Boot Camp installation, which is exactly what I want because I want to have one installation of all the programs.\nHowever, I'm wondering if using a virtual machine with the Boot Camp installation has the same exact performance as creating a brand new virtual machine.\nThe thing that prompted me to think that they might not have the same performance is the marketing text on VMware Fusion's website:\n\nBoot Camp Improvements — Up to 5x faster disk performance with Boot Camp virtual machines and a new option to disable authentication.\n\n... which I understood to mean that, in the past, a normal virtual machine (i.e. one that doesn't use Boot Camp) was faster than one that uses a Boot Camp installation, and now with the upgrade, it's 5x faster... yet it's still not as fast as the normal virtual machine (since then they would probably mention that it's now as fast as a traditional virtual machine).\nIs there a performance difference when using a normal virtual machine vs. one that uses a Boot Camp installation in VMware Fusion or Parallels? If so, which one is faster and by how much?\nUpdate: Since there are two attributes to compare, the wording is a bit confusing.\nFor clarification, let:\n\nA = Performance of normal VM on VMware Fusion 3\n  B = Performance of Boot Camp VM on VMware Fusion 3\n  C = Performance of normal VM on VMware Fusion 2\n  D = Performance of Boot Camp VM on VMware Fusion 2 \n\nI understood the marketing text to mean B = D * 5, and I inferred A > B since they mention that Boot Camp needed improvements, and rather than saying it's now as fast as a normal VM, they give a \"5x\" figure.\n\nA: As I use it on regular basis I can say it's good performance of using Bootcamp installed windows via VMWare Fusion 3.\nHere is process I followed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a bootcamp partition using Bootcamp Assistant for the space.\n\n*Install the Windows XP version.\n\n*Open the VMware and select the bootcamp partition, when you create a new virtual machine for Windows.\n\n*VMWare installs few utilities on the bootcamp partition, to use it to boot via Fusion.\n\n*Once all this is done, you can launch this windows version like a normal virtual machine in Fusion.\n\n\nIf I want a lite usage of windows I will boot via Fusion, if I want to run heavy programs then I will boot into Bootcamp, but I rarely does it, as Fusion VM is 99% OK for me for all activities including development with Eclipse.\n\nA: A Boot Camp VM is slower for two reasons: the NTFS driver used is slower than whatever a normal VM uses, and also, the Boot Camp partition is placed on the innermost (slowest) section of the hard drive platters. \n\nA: I have exactly the same question, and have yet to find a good answer. In the past (before Fusion 3.1), I understand that a virtual disk was generally faster, because: a) this could take advantage of host cacheing, etc. and b) Fusion still had to tunnel through the host OS to access the Boot Camp partition, since the hard drive is really \"owned\" and managed by the host. I'm not sure what changed in 3.1 to increase the performance by 5x, but apparently it can now access the BC partition much more efficiently.\nIn my case, I actually have a second physical hard drive in my Mac Pro that is dedicated to Windows. So, theoretically, Windows could talk directly to this hard drive without going through the host OS at all. I'm not sure that Fusion is actually able to recognize this special case and do that, but it would be awesome if it did, similar to the way the guest OS can \"own\" certain USB devices.\n", "Q: How do I disable update warnings on my iPhone? I got a bought app (i.e. not a free one - be it given to me, bought by me or gifted, I don't know). It works great. Then some update for it comes along with many other updates for other apps. I press \"update all\" and every time this one app gives me a notification that I need to buy it because it's a new major version or whatever. Well, I don't want to do it, it works fine the way it is (probably because I was still in iOS 3.1.3)!\nSo, how can I just remove the future updates from the list? If there is any way to do it, that is.\nP.S.: Now I upgraded to iOS 4, the app stopped working and I decided to just delete it along with another couple of apps which had a similar issue.\n\nA: You don't get charged for app upgrades on iOS. You only get notification for free updates.\n\nA: It is possible you had run into whatever is described here (the comment 9:09AM on 3-05-2010 and further): http://www.tuaw.com/2010/03/04/paid-app-upgrades-coming-to-app-store/2#comments\nSo seems clear iPhone checks the installed apps vs iTunes store but when you click update all and it asks for the updated app, iTunes says \"nuh-uh! you did not purchase this one, i am not signing/certifying bundle for you\"\n", "Q: System-wide Keyboard Shortcut for Moving to Sidebar/Next Column I've been on a bit of a Keyboard-only kick lately, enabled chiefly due to the Chrome Keyboard Shortcut Extension, and I've begun bumping into a few difficult situations in everyday Desktop App use.\nIn applications like iTunes, or Code Editors, they have a unified sidebar with categorically organized content. iTunes has categories for your library, other people's libraries, your device, and playlists, Coda has a file picker, etc. But what is the easiest way to move keyboard focus to these sidebars? My current solution is to alternate Tab and ▼ aimlessly until I see an item on the sidebar highlighted. Needless to say this is frustrating and can lead to unintended changes being made in content panes.\nI notice that most all apps have a function to hide the sidebar in the app menus, but restoring it doesn't move the focus to the sidebar.\nI've looked at the Mac OS X Keyboard Shortcut Question but didn't find what I was looking for. Is there some kind of a global shortcut that will move focus between different interface elements, easily? Reliably?\n\nA: Thinking outside the box:\nIf the only reason you want the keyboard shortcut, is to avoid your mouse, have you considered a trackpoint keyboard?\nBecause I had RSI in the past, trackpoint keyboards are about the only ones I can use (even at clients, I usually bring my keyboard, or work from my laptop that has such a keyboard).\nThe big upside of those keyboards is that you don't have to take your hand of the keyboard in order to use the mouse.\nFor trackpads I still need to (somehow using my thumb is far less accurate on trackpads than using my index finger, o I still need to lift my hand for pointing).\nIt takes a little while to get used to a trackpoint, but I can't do without them any more.\nUSB trackpoint keyboards work equally well on Mac and PC.\n--jeroen\n", "Q: How to delete images already imported into iPhoto? I have a large number of random folders of photos on my hard drive, some of which have been imported into iPhoto. How do I figure out which photos have been imported into iPhoto, so I can delete the non-iPhoto copies?\n\nA: If you batch drag them, as jmlumpkin suggested, a number of them will be spotted with the 'do you want to import again', and you can apply no to all, then delete the bunch. If hwoever, it accepts them, there are a few bits of duplicate finder software - none of them free (at least not that I've found), but at around $8 - http://www.brattoo.com/propaganda/. \nI'd love to find something free that did the same!\nOther helpful things: It may take some time, but letting faces do its thing, you will be able to group up and spot some duplicates. \n\nA: I would drag each photo to iPhoto individually. It should then tell you 'these already exist in your library, do you want to import again, etc'. I would then visually check to make sure that they are in there, and then delete the folder. \nIf it doesn't give you that message, then you would go ahead and import them, and then can remove the original folder. \n\nA: You can delete all duplicate photos under \"Last import\" section after import\n", "Q: Is it possible to run Nautilus on OS X? Is it possible to run Nautilus instead of Finder on Mac OS X Snow Leopard? How?\n\nA: Looks like it's available in MacPorts, so you could install MacPorts and then install Nautilus using that:\nsudo port install nautilus  \n\nYou should then be able to run it using the nautilus terminal command.\n\nYou may see the following during installation:\n############################################################################\n# Startup items have been generated that will aid in\n# starting dbus with launchd. They are disabled\n# by default. Execute the following command to start them,\n# and to cause them to launch at startup:\n#\n# sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist\n# launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist\n############################################################################\n\nRunning the commands manually should be enough to run nautilus directly after installation (without rebooting).\n\nA: While Josh's answer regarding MacPorts addresses how to install nautilus, it doesn't address how to run it \"instead of Finder\". In the other answer(s), there seemed to be some confusion about whether it would be possible to prevent the Finder from running.\nUnlike an application such as the Dock, the Finder isn't considered a \"required\" application. For example, if you were to write an AppleScript to the effect of tell application \"Dock\" to quit\"and then run it, the loginwindow would immediately re-launch the Dock, since it assumes the Dock must always be running. With the Finder, however, as long as you quit it in a way that allows OS X to know that you had a clear intent to do that, the loginwindow won't relaunch it.\nTo do that, all you need to do is simply tell the Finder to quit rather than trying to kill it. When you kill the Finder forcibly by using the Force-Quit option or by using kill or killall in Terminal, loginwindow (or launchd for your user account) will immediately try to relaunch it because it saw that it terminated \"unexpectedly\".\nTelling the Finder to quit via an Apple Event won't result in it automatically being relaunched.\n[EDIT]: In more recent versions of macOS, as I mentioned in this answer, it's possible to prevent the Finder from running by running the following command in Terminal:\nlaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Finder.plist\nAlternatively, in older versions of OS X, an AppleScript like the following could be run at login to quit the Finder:\nproperty runningApps : {}\nproperty assureQuitMenuItem : true\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to set runningApps to name of every application process\n\nif (runningApps contains \"Finder\") then\n    tell application \"Finder\" to quit\nend if\n\nif (assureQuitMenuItem) then\n    set quitMenuItem to missing value\n    try\n        set quitMenuItem to (do shell script \"/usr/bin/defaults read com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem\")\n    on error\n        set quitMenuItem to \"0\"\n    end try\n    if quitMenuItem = \"0\" then\n        do shell script \"/usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem 1\"\n    end if\nend if\n\nA saved version of this in application form is at: QuitFinder.zip\n(You can open the application in AppleScript Editor to see its contents by dragging the script app icon onto AppleScript Editor's application icon).\n", "Q: Permissions for new files in shared directory We just got a new iMac are using the /Users/Shared directory to store media assets (pictures, audio, video) that we want accessible to all users on the machine. After copying over all the files initially, we set the desired permissions and then applied the same permissions to all directory contents recursively. This is working fine, except then whenever someone creates a new file or directory, it does not have the same permissions and we have to repeat the whole permissions process before everyone can access it.\nIs there a way that we can set permissions for all new files/directories created within that directory?\n\nA: Another approach is to use Terminal (a.k.a shell or command prompt) to create/edit (must be performed as super-user, see sudo) the file: /etc/launchd-user.conf adding the line:\numask 000\nsave and reboot. New files/folders (including files changed by save as) will allow everyone read/write.\nThis works by changing the default file creation permissions for programs, whereas the ACL approach works in terms of access rules bound to particular files and folders.\nWithout this tweak, files are created allowing user: read-write, group & other: read-only.\nIf you are sharing between multiple computers, you need to do this for all computers that will use the share.\nIf you have existing files and folder in the shared area, you need to make them all readable/writable by everyone using:\nsudo chmod -R og+w <shared-folder-name>\nThe command reads in English as change mode, recursive through all sub folders and files, other & group permissions add write access, starting at folder with .\nThis approach is mentioned in forums to work with at least as early as 10.6 and still works on 10.7.\nOther factors still affect access to content. For example, permissions set in the Sharing control panel, home folder permissions/ACLs, and when using Terminal any umask in effect for the shell.\nLook up umask and Posix file permissions for details on these Unix concepts. In the write ups, the word directory is Unix parlance synonymous with folder. You will also encounter the terms UID and GID: user and group IDs, which define the Posix ownership of running programs (processes). Note that UIDs and GIDs are numbers which may be the same or different for a given user name across different computers. These numbers are assigned to names in the order accounts are created on a given computer, typically starting with ID 501. Home networks lack a mechanism to harmonize these assignments across computers. Therefore on network shares a file may appear to belong to different users because the user ID to user name binding is determined from the perspective of computer is accessing the file. So shares really always allows everyone to access files to various degrees of everyone. In other words, the Posix \"other\" permission is an indefinite limit on access ranging from allowing a quite predictable but apparently uncertain degree of access depending on the user IDs assigned on different computers. This leads to apparently absurd variations in experiences, where on some networks, for example a setup with only one user account ever created on each Mac, will be able to share without any permissions tweaks because all accounts will have the same UID (501, no matter what the accounts are named) whereas another network using multiple user accounts per Mac will see problems right away. So some groups will never struggle with this, whereas some others may see problems that develop over time, or problems which appear/disappear spontaneously, depending on when/how additional user accounts are created/used with the shared folder. \nIt's a mystery why Apple has left such a festering usability defect in the configuration of such an otherwise easy to enable file sharing capability.\nOn external disks, this problem is addressed with the \"Ignore permissions on this volume\" option. There may be a similar feature for apple file sharing, but where is it.\nIf you roll you own Samba service config there are other mechanisms for handling these problems, but Samba is not at all easy to use.\n\nA: You can't do this with traditional POSIX-style permissions, but you can with inheritable access control entries.  To allow read+write access for the entire \"staff\" group to everything in /Users/Shared/reallyshared, you'd use:\nsudo chmod -R +a \"staff allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\" /Users/Shared/reallyshared\n\nThe file_inherit,directory_inherit part means that this access control entry will automatically be added to new files & folders created inside this folder, but it doesn't automatically apply to items already there (that's why I added the -R flag to chmod -- that applies it to everything currently within the folder), and it won't be applied to items created somewhere else and then moved into this folder (I don't know of a way around this, sorry).\n", "Q: How can I rebind keys in OS X? Is there a native way to rebind keys in OS X without requiring a 3rd party tool?\nI'm interested in rebinding my whole keyboard layout, not specific shortcut keys. It's not a standard layout either, so I can't just change it from Qwerty to Azerty, for example. I need to be able to choose exactly which keys are at each location.\nI noticed that Mac OS X has the directories KeyBindings and Keyboard Layouts under the ~/Library/ folder. Are these related to what I want to do? If so, how would I use them?\n\nA: You mean besides the \"System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts\" settings? (Click on the ? button in the bottom-right for more info.)\nThe Mac has dictionary (.dict) files for configuring parts of apps, system services. There are .dict files for the keyboard layout that can be edited by the property editor app, which is part of Apple's XCode development environment. Be very careful to understand that messing with them without knowing what you are doing can, and most likely will, break stuff.\n/System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Versions/C/Resources/StandardKeyBinding.dict is an example. If you have TextMate, /Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/Resources/KeyBindings.dict is another. TextMate's site has a little write-up about how it uses the key bindings.\nAlso, look to the right at the \"Related\" section. There are some similar questions that might give you more ideas, such as \"Best key remapper tool?\".\nThat should be enough to get you started.\n\nApple's Technical Note TN2056 \"Installable Keyboard Layouts\" is something you should probably read, then search for more info from that point. You're messing with stuff that can make your machine hard to work with if it isn't done right, so arm yourself with enough information to know what you are doing. Apple's Technical documentation is the top-level for their developer documentation. Their support forum would be another good resource.\n\nA: \nI noticed that Mac OS X has the directories KeyBindings and Keyboard Layouts under the ~/Library/ folder.

Previously I was keeping the .pst file from the PC on an external HD so I could see it on all my PCs, but now with a Mac, I'm at loss as to what to do. I still plan to use both Mac and PC.\n\nA: My first instinct is to suggest using IMAP and just keeping all your mail etc on the server. Then it is as simple as using Thunderbird or another Mac compatible mail client up to date with your email accounts.\nHowever, I am assuming you have a reason to not go this route. An alternative would be to use Outlook for Mac if you're familiar with Outlook and wish to keep using it (and are okay with shelling out a little bit of money for it). I would like to believe that Microsoft kept compatibility with pst files alive in the transition.\n\nA: If you are looking for backup & Restore of mails, you would love to use GMAIL back-up utility. I usually forward all mails from my account(a setting to send a copy to other account) to gmail account & I can always have backup on gmail. I can download all mails from GMAIL-Backup utility & similarly restore to specific account. This is what I did when I want to have backup of mails & transfer it to mac. You might not like the answer.

I'm trying to make an Applescript to convert from .flv to .m4v automatically by using this tutorial and butchering their example applescript file, which normally converts ChemDraw files (.cdx, .cml, .mol) to .tiff, so that it instead uses Quicktime to save the .flv files as .m4v.  When I try to use it, though, I get an error \"QuickTime Player got an error: document 1 doesn't understand the save message\".  My save message is currently:\n\nsave first document in target_path as \".m4v\"\n\nwhich looks like the QuickTime dictionary's instructions:\n\nsave specifier : The document(s) or window(s) to save.\n[as saveable file format] : The file format to use.\n\nI've also tried \"m4v\", without the period, and still get the error.\nIs my Save direction wrong, or is it probably an error from trying to use Quicktime instead of the original ChemDraw?  I tried to change references to .cdx, .cml, .mol, .tiff, and ChemDraw to .flv, .m4v, and QuickTime respectively, but maybe it's more complicated than that?\nI would, in fact, appreciate any example showing how to save an application file (ex: a TextEdit .rtf or .txt), as I can't seem to get any kind of file to save using applescript.\n\nA: Sorry, still too low to post comment. Are we talking QuickTime Player X or QuickTime Player 7? (very different .sdefs)\nAlso, can you post the script content leading up tosave first document in target_path as \".m4v\"?

But the key was to actually manually create and use the preset first.\nThere are a lot of places to get started with Applescript, but Quicktime is definitely not one of them, and hacking that tutorial isn't going to work without a lot of unnecessary effort. I recommend you further search for Applescript example specific to Quicktime as the API is a bit wonky and really weak in the current version (10.x, I believe), to be honest. I do know that Apple has a complete Quicktime Applescript example code collection buried on their site, but the link is no longer in my notes. Macscripter.net might offer up some practical examples as well.\n\nA: If you're using QuickTime Pro 7, I believe it can only save natively in .mov. You do have the option to export to other formats, but saving is a different function, and is always .mov regardless of the codec used within.\nSee if you can save as .mov with your script. If you can, then you know that you need to change your code to use an export function.

I enter the password for the share account but it tells me it's invalid.  I've also tried different username/passwords just incase and using guest access.  All no good.\n\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas on what else I can try?  I'm definitely getting the right username & password combination.\nCheers for any help\nLee\n\nA: I finally found the answer on the DD-WRT forums and it's annoyingly simple but I would never have guessed it in a million years.\nThe username has to be entered in UPPER CASE.  So while smb://share@192.168.1.1/public didn't work, smb://SHARE@192.168.1.1/public did!\nJust wish I hadn't spent a day trying to get find that out!\n\nA: Good find!  I expect it is because Linux works on case-sensitive file systems.  Macs mostly do not anymore, although they can be configured to respect case.  If the uppercase annoys you, you can either check the share to make sure it's lowercase, or check your /etc/smb.conf file on the DD-WRT to make sure it respects case.\n", "Q: Can a WiFi-only Kindle connect to the internet through an iPhone? I'm considering getting a Kindle, but am still doubting as to whether the 3G model is worth the extra expense. As I'm also considering getting an iPhone later: on the off chance that I'd ever want to buy a book without a WiFi hotspot nearby, wouldn't it be possible to share an iPhone's 3G connection with the Kindle through WiFi and hence buy a book and read it on the WiFi-only Kindle?\n\nA: For information about the full article “iOS 4.3 lets iPhone 4 host wifi over 3G”\nhttp://devicegadget.com/apple/ios-4-3-lets-iphone-4-host-wifi-3g/1320/\nThx.. ;)\n\nA: I have an iPhone 3G with MyWi 5 on it.  I can confirm that other devices such as my laptop (Sony VAIO FWIW) connects well over the WiFi hotspot of the iPhone and can access the internet but that the Kindle WiFi 6\" device I also have will not connect.  It seems to detect that this is a 3G wifi device rather than a WiFi network and gives me an error message saying I am not allowed to connect to devices of this type.\nI dont know if the iPhone 4 or iPhone 4s will enable you to connect (as they have built in WiFi hotspots in the operating system) but an iPhone 3G with MyWi 5 definitely wont.  Not sure if Android devices will allow you to or not.\nHope that helps folks\n\nA: Tethering isn't allowed for the iPhone or iPad (at least not without jailbreaking it, I believe). At the same time, I have a wifi-only iPad, and I have yet to find myself in a situation where I was 1.) in a public wifi-less area and 2.) I just had to have a book for the Kindle app at that very moment. The chances are more \"off\" than \"on\", realistically, and a little planning gets obviates the scenario you describe. I feel the 3G is a bit of a boondoggle, at least for me.\n\nA: You have to jailbreak the iPhone and install an expensive program called MyWi 4.0 (check spelling) from Cydia. This allows the iPhone to host a wifi network that a Kindle can connect to. \nAsk if you need more details, I'm on my iPhone now so don't want to type much :)\n\nA: My mom has a kindle wifi only and when tethering wifi on iPhone 4 kindle says it doesn't allow connecting to tethered connections\n\nA: *\n\n*You can create a mobile hotspot with an iPhone (if you pay your carrier for the privilege and your carrier supports it)\n\n*A Kindle Fire (which is WiFi only) can connect to a mobile hotspot created by an iPhone to connect to the Internet. \nGiven 1 and 2, I assume a \"regular\" Kindle can do the same.\nps - The mobile hotspot prices are insane, and both AT&T and Verizon have done nothing but raise prices as time goes on. But it's possible to do, and if you only need it for a short while you can cancel it when you are done. I would not spend the money on a 3G Kindle unless you wanted to get a Kindle 3 (aka \"Kindle Keyboard\") where the 3G can be used for more than just downloading books. The new Kindle 4s which have 3G do not let you web browse using 3G, only WiFi. (And if you have an iPhone, there's no way you would ever want to use the horrible Kindle browser anyway.)\n\nA: Apple says the personal hotspot requires data roaming needs to be on (hidden at the bottom of one of their support pages instead of the first line).  After enabling data roaming my kindle keyboard connected via personal hotspot to my iPhone 4S.\n\nA: I use kindle fire hd with iphone 5 but lose connection if you get a call can't do data and phone call at same time but that is an iPhone thing.\n\nA: It may be noted to everyone viewing this post that newer iOS brings native mobile hotspot. As of posting iOS 10 is the newest iOS, and iOS 7 allows mobile hotspot for the iPhone 4.\nThe mobile hotspot can be found in your iPhone's settings, with no jailbreak required. If your carrier does not allow you a mobile hotspot, then a jailbreak and installation of MyWi will be necessary.\nCheers\n", "Q: How can I associate localhost in Snow Leopard to a specific ip? I've disabled the web server on Snow Leopard, and I'm using an emulated Ubuntu with Lighttpd web server.\nIn order to access to the web pages I need to specify the ip of the emulated machine. However I now need to associated such ip with \"localhost\" in Leopard environment.\nWhen I type localhost in Leopard I actually want to visit the localhost on the Ubuntu machine.\nDo I need apache on leopard to make the forward or can I change network settings in Leopard or what?\n\nA: You don't want to do this. As you pointed out, there are warnigs in the /etc/hosts file not to change the localhost entry.\nThe localhost entry is meant to resolve to the local host and more specifically the loopback address 127.0.0.1. On your Snow Leopard machine, localhost should resolve to your Snow Leopard machine and on your Ubuntu machine, localhost should resolve to your Ubuntu machine.\nIf you are trying to access the Ubuntu system from your Snow Leopard system, why don't you just use the IP address of the Ubuntu system?\n\nA: You could add a new line to /etc/hosts to map the VM's IP to something like ubuntu. Then you could just do http://ubuntu to get to it. Still some config file modification required, but a better solution than remapping localhost that should also suit your requirements.\n\nA: You could change your /etc/hosts file to map localhost to the IP of the VM, not to 127.0.0.1\n", "Q: Can I set up an Apple TV to receive content from a Synology NAS? I have a Synology DS210j NAS. My music and movies are served from the NAS by its built-in iTunes server. The content is then available on my MacBook in iTunes / Sharing Library.\nI am looking for a way to set up an audio system in my apartment that doesn't need my MacBook. The content would come from the NAS (served by the iTunes server).\nI'd like to buy a 2nd generation AppleTV to receive the content and then use iPhone's Remote app to control it. I also thought about extending this setup with AirPlay speakers (probably with an Airport Express) which would allow me to control the music separately in every room.\nWould such a setup work? Can an AppleTV receive content from the NAS/iTunes server? If not, what are the alternatives?\n\nA: Watch Erica Sadun's AirFlick project. It can do what you want from a host running Mac OS X, so one would expect a GUI-less version to appear soon that could be ported to your NAS.\n\nA: As far as I'm aware a stock AppleTV will only talk to the iTunes store or a Mac/PC running iTunes. Third party daapd servers such as the one that Synology embed in their NAS line won't work without hacking the AppleTV. Currently the hacks for the black AppleTV are just getting started but Firecore have mentioned being able to play almost any media file from almost any NAS in a upcoming update. See:\nhttp://firecore.com/atvflash-black\n\nAccess Media Anywhere\n  Stream media\n  from most NAS devices. Includes\n  support for AFP, SMB and NFS\n  protocols.\n\n\nA: I have successfully used my Synology NAS directly with my two AppleTVs.  There are two different options that I've had success with.\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes Home Sharing\n\n*Synology AirPlay support and told it to use the audio renderer that is the AppleTV.\n\n\nNote, you have to be using at least DSM 3.2.  Also, I've seen a few problems where it didn't like to play Apple Lossless files via home sharing.\n\nA: the apple TV works only with airplay (old airtunes) protocol, which is proprietary and does not allow to do streaming from any other 3rd party devices which includes synology nas severs (and other devices).\n", "Q: Can I have a stable IP address for a virtual machine under VMWare? I'm using VMWare to emulate Ubuntu on my Leopard Mac OS X.\nThe IP address changes everytime I put the Mac to sleep.\nI was wondering if I can avoid that.\n\nA: You can do this -- just configure the Ubuntu virtual machine with a static IP. The choice of IP will depend on the network you're connecting to... You didn't mention if you were using a NAT or Bridged connection, and the choice of IP will different based on that. I can provide specific instructions if you like, but, they'll be all things you do within the Ubuntu VM, not within the Mac environment. (So you may find better luck asking on http://askubuntu.com or https://unix.stackexchange.com/)\nYou could also install the \"avahi-daemon\" package in Ubuntu and then you won't need to remember the VM's IP address, you can use vm-hostname.local as if it were a Mac with Bonjour.\nEDIT: I see you're using a NAT interface. I typed up a long list of instructions only got get stuck on the final step. I'll do more research into this, but in the meantime, here's some instructions which I have not tested, but might work on the Mac side...\nHere's incomplete instructions, I will finish them up shortly:\nVMware Susion starts assigning IPs via DHCP at .128 (at least on my machine). The first three octets of the IPs are defined by a network probe which happened when you installed VMware, so you'll want to determine what network VMware chose for you, and then choose an IP underneath the range VMware assigns via DHCP to avoid conflicts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine what network VMware chose: In the Ubuntu Virtual Machine, choose System > Administration > Network Tools. In the window that appears, under \"Network Device\", choose \"Ethernet Interface (eth0)\". In the list below, look for \"IPv4\". Look at the IP address in the right hand column, and make note of the first three octets (numbers between the dots). On my machine, this is: 172.16.1\n\n*Choose a new static IP: You can make up any number from 2 to 127 which will be appended to the network from step 1, as long as it doesn't conflict with any other static IPs you have assigned. Let's say you choose 15, because I like the number 15. In my example your static IP would then be 172.16.1.15.\n\n*Configure Ubuntu to use a static IP: Go to System > Preferences > Network Connections in the Ubuntu VM.  Under \"Wired\" choose \"Auto eth0\" and click \"edit\". Go to \"IPv4 Settings\" and set \"Method:\" to \"Manual\". Next to \"Addresses\", click the \"Add\" button. In the new row that appears, under \"Address\", enter the IP you close (172.16.1.15 in my example). Under Netmask, enter 255.255.255.0. Under gateway, enter the first three octets of your IP, followed by .1. (In my example, the gateway would be 172.16.1.1). Under DNS Servers, enter... oh, crap, this is being provided by DHCP. Let me figure out a way to make this work :-/\n\nA: To complement on Josh’s post, the answer is yes, but it depends. \nTechnically speaking, any OS inside a VM has direct access to either the network card or a private network created by the host OS. In either case, you can configure your VM to have any IP address you want. \nNow I assume you want to have your VM with the same IP all the time, so you should switch to bridged connection, which will make the VM believe that it has a dedicated network card that you can later configure as you please. In fact, for the rest of the network, the machine will be a regular computer. VMWare will take care of the virtualization and the virtual Network Card (NIC).\n", "Q: Can I put a \"marker\" on a QuickTime movie? Is there any way for me to put a \"marker\" in the timeline of a QuickTime movie? This would be very helpful in certain cases, for example quickly marking parts of long movies from my digital camera which I want to review later. I'm sure I could do this using iMovie or Final Cut Pro, but I'm looking for something specifically in QuickTime player (as I'm previewing movies taken right off my digital camera)\nWhat I envision is something like I have mocked up in this doctored screen capture:\n\n\nA: I'm afraid no feature like that exists.\nHowever, with QuickTime Pro, you can fairly easily cut out clips of a movie to save for later. You get two selection cursors, and can actually use copy and paste to yank out sections and put them into new players. It will then save them natively inside .mov containers with no need for exporting.\n", "Q: iPod Touch G4 disconnects from Belkin N+ Router at random intervals I have an iPod Touch G4 and a Belkin N+ Router F5D8235-4 v2, and for some reason the iPod Touch disconnects from the router at random intervals.  \nChecking the settings in the iPod, it will read that it is still connected to the router, but before I can access the internet again, I have to turn on Airplane mode and then turn it off again to get any program to work with the Internet again.\nI've tried upgrading the firmware in the router, but that also doesn't seem to help.  I'm using the wiresless mode 802.11b&802.11g&802.11n in the 20/40MHz frequency.\nIs there any way of fixing this issue?  It doesn't happen with any of the other devices that are connected to the router.\nThis post has been cross posted here\n\nA: I have had this issue with the D-link router at home from time to time. My solution was to set a static IP and manually enter the device's IP, subnet mask, gateway IP, and DNS server IPs manually into the device.\n", "Q: there used to be a full sized wireless keyboard? I am a programmer and find the small wireless keyboard hard to use (the small arrow keys and lack of home/end keys). From what I remember there used to be a full sized wireless keyboard, is this correct?\n\nA: Yes, you can even still purchase it from vendors listed on this Google Shopping page. Unfortunately, that option will run you $120 plus whatever shipping they charge.\nAn alternative is purchasing it used off eBay, but I only found one listing for the full sized wireless Apple keyboard.\n\nA: Yup, you're right, but it is not in the style of the present day designs (flat aluminium enclosure, laptop style keys). It was of the older, chunkier keys present on older Apple desktop keyboards. It was discontinued in about 2007 when Apple redesigned it and released the present day design. \nDetails of older design\n", "Q: How to run Wireshark in the background without the GUI? I am trying to run Wireshark on Mac OS X in the background. I installed the command line utilities, and so I am able to start Wireshark and capture packets using the command line.\nThe only thing I want now is to run it in the background, without the X11 icon in the Dock or seeing Wireshark's window. I believe it is possible, but can't find anything in Wireshark's docs.\nMaybe another approach would be to hide the icon?\nIf anybody has already did this or has an idea…\n\nA: As initially seen here:\n\nAs far as I remember TShark comes with all distributions of Wireshark. This runs from the command line. The documentation for it is here: http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html\nAnd there's some examples on how to use it here: http://www.codealias.info/technotes/the_tshark_capture_and_filter_example_page\n\n— David Hewitt\n\nA: There is also a complete alternative in the form of tcpdump, which comes by default on many OS X installs. The syntax is different, but it's command-line only, and is invaluable in a smaller/command line only environment.\nIt must be run as root, otherwise undo sudo.\n\nA: As @VxJasonxV said you can use TCPDump and if you don't want the output show on terminal can use >> filename to TCPDump save result on your desired file.\nyou can use TCPDump with many options but I think this was the best one:\ntcpdump -n -v -S -i en1 tcp\n\nen1: interface that you assign IPv4\n-v: produce (slightly more) verbose output \n-S: Print absolute, rather than relative, TCP sequence numbers.\n-n: Don't convert addresses (i.e., host addresses, port numbers, etc.) to names.\n-i: Listen on interface.\nbut this save the output that was not readable by human if you want to process the output that was readable by human you must use tshark:\nthe command that you must use is some thing like this:\ntshark -r ~/home/myHome/Desktop/file_name(produce by tcpdump) -R \"ip.src==172.16.13.128\" -T fields -e frame.number -e frame.time -e ip.id -e tcp.window_size -e tcp.analysis.ack_rtt -E header=y > ~/home/myHome/Desktop/file_name.txt\n\n\nA: You could run it in screen, or in a virtual X11 session (Xvfb) that is not displaying to your monitor.\n", "Q: What's the purpose of the eject button on the MacBook Air? I was interested to see that the power button on the new Airs has been moved to the keyboard, and was anticipating that it would just replace the eject key that has traditionally taken up that position.\nHowever, this appears not to be the case (pic is from iFixit's teardown guide):\n\nWhat's the purpose of the eject key with no optical drive?\n\nA: Well, The keyboard is the same as other Macbooks (which have SuperDrive), but in any case, if you have an external (USB) superdrive, the button will work as advertised. \n\nA: You can use Ejectulate to map the eject key to show you a list of every ejectable volume, making it useful even on a MacBook Air lacking an optical drive.\n\nA: There's also quite a few keyboard shortcuts that use the eject key. \n\n\n*\n\n*Control ⌃+Eject ⏏ brings up a screen that has Restart/Sleep/Cancel/Shut Down options\n\n*Command ⌘+Control ⌃+Eject ⏏ instantly restarts\n\n*(etc.)\n\nA: That's funny. I was wondering the same thing when I first opened up my MBA! I asked a Genius at the Apple Store who proceeded to tell me that he had wondered the same thing too, and asked his superior who told him that is was designed for use with the MacBook Air Superdrive, which costs an astounding $79 and is basically a slick looking external DVD writer. Because it's made by Apple it doesn't have any buttons on it, including an eject button. Most new/casual Mac users won't know the drag to eject or context-menu eject methods, so in order to make the drive streamlined with the Mac, they put the eject key on the MacBook Air itself.\nI guess Apple anticipates a wide user base for the new Superdrive...\n", "Q: HDMI audio doesn't work through DisplayPort adapter on OS X but works on boot camped Win 7 I recently purchased this Dynex DisplayPort to HDMI adapter with the understanding that it would support audio out.\nHowever, it only works on my boot camped Windows 7 install that way. Video and audio passed to the TV with no issues. On the other hand, I only get video passed when booted into OS X.\nI have already tinkered with the sound configuration numerous times in an effort to get it to work. Googling turned up the fact that some adapters do not support passing audio through from the DisplayPort. I believe this is not the case since it works on Windows with no issues. I have also ensured that all updates have been installed. Still no dice.\nAny ideas on how I can get the audio passed through to the TV?\n\nA: Hold down the option key and click on the volume icon in the menu bar. What does the menu say for Output Device? If your adapter doesn't appear, here's what you can do: Open /Applications/Utilities/Audio MIDI Setup. See if your adapter appears in the list to the left. If it does, play with the Configure Device and Configure Speakers options (accessed by the gear button).\n\nA: It works! As soon as you change your audio output to your TV, the audio should work.\nHere is how to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down Option and click on the volume icon in the menu bar.\n\n*Change your audio output to the name of your TV. (i.e: XVA62619)\n\n*The audio icon will gray out, so don't worry about it.\n\n*Play something from your computer and it should work.\n\n", "Q: OS X 10.6: Applications crash when sounds play Most of my applications crash whenever a sound is played -- but not if the machine has been recently rebooted.\nFor example, Mail.app crashes when I send email, because of the whoosh sending sound. Safari/Chrome/Firefox will crash when Flash plays sounds, e.g. with YouTube, but does not crash for silent Flash apps. iChat will crash if I get a video chat request. iTunes will not start at all.\nAll display the same symptom -- freeze with spinning beach ball. All can be force-quit without issue, and without affecting other applications.\nIf I start an app right after a reboot, it generally will run just fine. If I open Safari after a fresh reboot, I can watch Flash video for an hour or two without issue, but the next morning, it will crash again.\nIf I open Skype after a fresh reboot, it will remain open and working, sometimes for days. But if I close it, it will not open again until I reboot.\nI've go through flashing PRAM and repair permissions with the Apple techs, and it doesn't seem to help. Any idea what I might be able to to do to get sound working again? I've been told to reinstall, but I primarily use the machine for work, and I can't take a week to get everything configured again just so I can use iTunes and YouTube.\nWhat is particularly annoying is having to quit Mail.app and restart after each sent email. If there were a way to disable the sent email sound that would be great too.\nThanks!\nCross-posted: http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=12791456\n\nA: Can you open the Console application (in the /Applications/Utilities/ folder) and see if anything is reported up to and during the application hangs?\nAre you actually getting a crash or just a hang? (A crash will display an \"unexpectedly quit\" dialog on its own (creating a .crash file) , whereas a hang will require you to explicitly force the application that's not responding to quit, which will then generate a .hang (\" stopped working because of a problem).\nIf you are actually getting a crash, please post the crash log (as much as you can) or otherwise provide access to it (as they can be somewhat long). If it's a hang, perhaps any output to Console might be more informative than the .hang report.\nYou mention iTunes does not start at all: do you mean it immediately starts to hang when you try to launch it, or does it crash with an unexpectedly quit dialog?\nAlso, try launching Activity Monitor (also in /Applications/Utilities/) and be sure to set the \"Show\" popup menu to All Processes. Check once at launch or on a fresh startup to see if there are any processes highlighted in red. Then when you begin having the problems, check again in Activity Monitor to see if there are any processes shown as not responding; if so, please post the name of them along with any info that's reported to Console.\nMy rough guess of what's happening is that either coreaudiod itself, or another sound/multi-media-related framework or launch-on-demand agent or service that these apps need is not responding, which in turn causes any applications that rely on it to hang as well.  \n\nA: NSGod's advice to look in the Console led me to a whole bunch of errors like this one:\n1/1/11 8:03:31 PM   com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[288]  (0x1002002f0.mach_init.VersionCueCS3monitor[20180]) The following job tried to hijack the service \"ah_serv_trigger.v1:20179\" from this job: 0x103ae66a0.anonymous.Google Chrome He\n\nFrom there, I found someone else complaining about the same problem who fixed it by removing Adobe Version Cue CS3.\nI uninstalled Version Cue using these instructions. I had a different set of files to remove — not all the ones they listed existed on my Mac, and not all of my related files were on that list.\nI used these commands:\nsudo rm -rf /Library/PreferencePanes/VersionCueCS3.prefPane/\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Preferences/com.adobe.versioncueCS3.plist\nsudo rm /private/etc/mach_init_per_user.d/com.adobe.versioncueCS3.monitor.plist\nsudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.adobe.versioncueCS3.plist\n\nWithout even rebooting, all my audio problems vanished.\nThanks so much to everyone who gave advice, especially NSGod. Sorry I cannot give upvotes, or hyperlink my links, but I lack the points to do so. Once I have them, I'll come back and upvote.\nUPDATE: Don't do this one, that I earlier had in the list:\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Application\\ Support/Adobe/Adobe\\ Version\\ Cue\\ CS3/\n\nSeems that that one prevented Photoshop from opening some files. I restored it, and Photoshop works fine, and so does audio.\n\nA: It is difficult to say what the problem is. It sounds like you have a done a good job isolating the problem as related to audio. Here are some general things that might help.\n\n\n*\n\n*Genius Bar - Often problems such as this are caused by hardware issues. If it is a standard Mac system, it likely isn't a hardware compatibility or driver issue as is common with Windows. There is a small chance that it is a known hardware problem in which case I would suggest visiting a Genius Bar if you are near an Apple Store. Even if it isn't a known problem, they will likely be able to determine if it is a hardware issue or not.\n\n*Reinstall Mac OS X - If it is not a hardware problem, then it must be something about the operating system, software or configuration that is causing the problem. Unfortunately, with computer systems the easiest answer is to get the system back to a known good state. Generally this means reinstalling the system as has been suggested to you.\n\n*Restore from Time Machine - If this problem is relatively new and you have a Time Machine or Time Capsule, you could try to get your system back to a known good state by restoring to a time when you did not have this problem.\n\n*Back Track - Try to determine what applications or changes you have made to the system that may have caused this problem. Try to undo those changes or uninstall those applications as much as possible. If you have a similar known good system, you can try and compare the audio settings between the machines and look for any differences. Eliminating potential causes and comparing to a known good configuration are two common troubleshooting techniques -- unfortunately, this could require some technical expertise as well as be time consuming.\n\n*Disable Sounds - If you want to just minimise the damage, try disabling as much of the sound effects as possible. Look both in the system preferences and in individual application preferences. For example in Mail, there is a tick box in the Preferences for 'Play sounds for other mail actions'. \nOne last thought, since everything seems to work fine after a fresh reboot, could it a be a problem caused after waking from sleep or hibernate?\n\nA: Sounds like (no pun intended) you've got some corrupt files on your hard disk, in particular CoreAudio libraries. You may have a dying heard disk.\nI would suggest at a minimum backing up your home directory and reinstalling.\n", "Q: Is there an Air Video app, but for photos? I was wondering if there is an app for the iPad in order to see photos that are shared in a Windows/Mac folder.\nI went to Australia and took over 12000 photos, now I want to take a close look at all of them without without importing all to iTunes (so it does not fill up space on my iPad).\nSomething that I could check, mark in order to move/copy to a diff folder so I can edit them later.\nFor iPhone there is the WiFi Photo Viewer but I can't find one for iPad.\n\nA: I developed ImageBank for iOS to do exactly this - streams photos from your PC/Mac to your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch.  It's universal so it works natively on the iPad, and it even works over 3G.\nThere's a free version too if you want to try it out:\nImageBank Lite\nIt's only US $0.99 to buy or upgrade from the free version.\n\nA: StreamToMe is far better than Air Video in many ways. One prime example is it's ability to remotely view photos. It will work with files stored anywhere or even browse your iPhoto library It also supports audio only files and portrait orientation playback while Air Video does not. It's a universal app that runs on iPhones too and the server app runs on Mac or PC. Price - $2.99.\nThe interface is nicer and there's even a recent history for convenience. It has always perplexed me why AirVideo is more popular.\nAlternatively, there's another great app you may wanna look at when you get some time called HereFileFile. It does not have an iPad optimized version yet, but they are in fact working on one as we speak. It looks very promising. However, the iPhone version is very nice. It's fairly similar in concept to these other two apps, but there are differences which I won't go into here.\n\nA: while it requires a jailbreak, I was really impressed after installing AirServer yesterday - I can run the server on my iPad and use my iPhoto to stream photos over AirPlay - really really awesome when you're not nearby a TV and if you are, you've got the reverse - a mini AppleTV in your pocket with your iPad as a beautiful remote for content!\n\nA: On the link you provide, it is marked as compatible with iPad. What's the issue? Moreover, it seems they're running a christmas sale :)\n\nApart my silly remark above (which clearly deserved votes down. Probably let too many neurons in the end of year festivities... :-/) there is an Air Photo HD app. It seems to be a browser of your iPhoto library over the air. Are you using iPhoto? If so, it could be a solution. Though, from the screenshots, I don't know if you can mark them as accepted/rejected.\nOtherwise, depending on the total size of your photos folder, Dropbox or similar services could be used, as what you'll do on the iPad will then be sync'ed automatically in the cloud (Dropbox free account is 2GB)\n\nA: ImageBank for iPhone/iPad does the trick for me!\n\nA: Not exactly what you were looking for, but if you had the time/bandwidth, you could upload the 12,000 photos to Flickr. Then you would have many more options for viewing/sharing. You could view the photos via Safari on the iPad or download one of the many applications which support viewing a Flickr feed.\nAgain, not ideal. Food for thought.\nGood luck!\n\nA: If you can't find a dedicated app (and it sure seems like something at least 20 people would have implemented by now) you could go old school and use safari and web sharing.\nI have used the export to web page and export to slide show functionality of iPhoto/Aperture to save a html folder to the ~/Sites folder.\nThen it's simple to turn on web sharing and use mobile safari to browse the thumbnail pages or just click through the main images as a slide show. \nYou can also export the slide show and a quicktime movie can be dumped if you would prefer better transitions and full screen with less tapping to navigate.\nI might try out PixelSync next time I need to rate and do heavier editing from the couch or by handing the iPad to a client. Again - this won't be good unless you want your photos in a managed database as it won't work with just a folder of files.\nAnd way out in \"the OP didn't even ask this\" land is a suggestion to check out PhotoMechanic - it stores all images in a folder but is optimized for extremely rapid optimized rating of many photos. There isn't an iPad/iPhoto link, but I've seen professionals blitz through 4.5k photos at the end of a major marathon and cull that first to 500 and then a second pass to the 35 images that make the day's news media picks for press use. With 12k images you might need a great tool on the computer to narrow down things before you move them to iOS land.\n\nA: I'm not quite following the reasoning behind chasing for an iOS app for aide in your sorting process. No matter what app you find, importing to your Mac/PC and using one of many available applications will allow far greater ease and efficiency to go through such a massive bulk of images. Why not import and then sort them in an Aperture library? Your data doesn't get locked in, you can rate, edit, sort, and delete photos, and you can get a 30-day trial.\n\nA: If you've willing to put the photos in iPhoto, we've just released an app that will stream them to your iPad over your home Wi-Fi network: AirPics.\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/airpics/id475202862?mt=8\nIt does not support flagging photos, but is good for streaming large albums (I've tested it with more than 3000 photos in a single album on my iPad 2 without issue).\n", "Q: Can I hide the new messages notification in the Mail icon for only one of my email accounts? Basically I would like to have two email accounts setup on my iPhone 4, one my personal account and one for work.\nHowever for the work account, I'd like to not have it's unread message count included in the number of unread messages displayed as a part of the Mail app's icon (the number in the red circle).\nIs this possible to do?\n\nA: No - there's no control for that on iOS 4.3 or less. If you disable that account it will temporarily turn it off on counts but the content stays loaded on the device.\nI will second the suggestion to set up a separate folder to store the majority of the unread messages and use server side filtering or a manual process to get rid of the distracting/offending messages. \nMy phone and sanity are both better once I bit the bullet and set up a rule that says if it's unread over a week it goes into my triage later folder. I can still search for messages using spotlight, they are all where I can find them but my phone is faster and the badge is more meaningful without that pile of messages.\nI'm not quite to inbox zero, but this was a good first step for me to getting there.\n\nA: You can effectively turn off push notifications for a particular email account... sort of. Go to the Settings app, and hit \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\". Go to \"Fetch New Data\", then scroll down and go to \"Advanced\". For the email account whose little red badges you don't want, change the setting to \"Manual\" instead of \"Push\". \nThis will prevent new messages from pushing a notification icon to the home screen. However, when you open the Mail app to check your other email, the app will sync the \"Manual\" account with the server and you'll get a badge if there are unread messages there. So, like bmike mentioned, the real way to get rid of those badges is to get closer to inbox zero. \n\nA: There's probably no \"set this option\" way to do it, but I've noticed that a.) the unread count is the number of unread messages in your inbox, not in subfolders and b.) iOS does not automatically check subfolders for new messages unless those subfolders are set to push via Exchange.  So, if your work account is an Exchange account:\n-Make a subfolder in your Inbox\n-Create a server-side rule to move all messages to that folder.  This can be done in Outlook on your work computer (assuming it's a PC) or probably in the Exchange web client (possibly requiring IE, since they disable certain functionality in the web client for other browsers...).\nThen you still have access to the messages in the work account (+1 tap, but it's an iPhone 4, so it's snappy), and they won't show up in your unread count.\n\nA: Sorry but you are all wrong... there is a way... I've spent the past several hours searching google for a forum for someone who knows... the reason why I know is because someone showed me once... I then reset my phone and the setting was reset and I've been trying for the past several days to remember how I did it.. yes IOS 7 and yes I did it... All I remember was that it wasn't very intuitive so hence why I've now forgotton... if I find it I will repost.. \n", "Q: What is the difference between a \"sparse disk image\" and a \"sparse bundle disk image\"? What are the differences between sparse and sparse bundle disk images?\n\nA: From the DropDMG manual:\n\nSparse\n  bundle disk images appear as a single\n  file but are actually stored as a\n  folder with many files inside. This\n  makes it more efficient to back them\n  up using Time Machine or other backup\n  utilities, as only the changed parts\n  need to be copied. Additionally,\n  sparse bundle disk images work well\n  with the Compact Image… command.\n  Compatible with Mac OS X 10.5 and\n  later.\nSparse\n  disk images are stored as a single\n  file. This can make backups\n  inefficient for large disk images,\n  because the entire file must be copied\n  each time. The Compact Image… command\n  generally does not reclaim as much\n  disk space as with sparse bundle disk\n  images. Compatible with Mac OS X 10.3\n  and later.\n\n\nA: Sparse bundle disk image is an optimized form of the sparse disk image. It optimizes intentionally to reduce network load upon backup of changes to the filesystem at the expense of time and space. Specifically it uses a hashing function to store bits of data across a large directory structure which allows changes to be isolated in smaller band files. When copying the disk image elsewhere, rsync like tools will only need to copy the bands that change which makes incremental copies or backups far faster than moving the entire sparse image.\nLocal storage of the bundle img is less efficient in terms of space used, CPU time needed to process IO to the disk image is increased and when files are deleted, the reclamation of space is delayed and not as complete when compared to a sparse disk image. \nUnless you are backing up the bands incrementally online (as Time Machine does to Time Capsule) it's usually better to go with the sparse disk image over a sparse bundle. Some software will look inside a sparse image and only copy the changed blocks, but the bundle allows simpler tools to be more efficient moving changes around.\n", "Q: How to make an expanding compressed encrypted disk image? I'd like the following setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*A DMG file sits on my HD, taking up only the space of the contents, or perhaps only the space of the contents compressed.\n\n*If I double-click on it, I need to give a password for it to open\n\n*Once opened, I can drag files in and out, as long as I don't fill it up. The theoretical maximum should be the 4.6 or 8.3 GB DVD option from Disk Utility\n\n*Once I've added (or removed) files from it, I can eject / unmount it\n\n*When unmounted, it returns to the size of the contents and is again password protected.\n\n\nIs this possible with disk images (DMGs)? What is the best way to set this up?\n\nA: This is exactly what a dmg does.\nTo create one use Disk Utility and hit the New Image icon. Then choose the size, encryption and choose the image format as one of the sparse images. Even if you choose a large size it will only take up space according to what you save in it.\n\nA: You can not write to a disk image where the format is compressed\n\n… files in and out …\n\nThe compressed formats do not allow addition, edition or removal. \nYou can use existing files to create an image with a compressed format. Write once. \nIf you create a new blank disk image that is compressed — with or without encryption — it will be relatively useless: \n\n\nCompressed — write once. The one write occurs when you create the image — not afterwards. The resulting volume is read only: \n\nYou can use Disk Utility to convert a compressed image to a format that allows writing. At http://www.wuala.com/%23%23Apple-support/members/grahamperrin/2011/08/04/a/?mode=gallery I posted a five-minute movie showing two conversions. \n", "Q: How do I detect an iPhone user on my website? I want to forward my viewers on my site to a different place if they are using an iPhone. Is there a way to do that using iWeb?\n\nA: Don't.\nThe only reasons to ever have a separate mobile site are cheapness and laziness.\nThe right approach is to have your visitors all get the same content; the only thing that should change how that content is styled—and doing that doesn't need a separate site, or even a special page.\nIf your next question is \"Can iWeb do that?,\" the answer is that I doubt it, because iWeb just isn't meant to be a professional web development tool. If you're looking for an alternative, I recommend TextWrangler—it's both better and cheaper.\n\nReferences:1\n\n\n*\n\n*How to Make Your Website Mobile Today, InfoWorld, 20 September 2010\n\n*Mobilizing Your Web Site, Users Conference session at Macworld Expo 2011, 28 January 2011\n\n\n1 Yes, they're both me.\n\nA: You can use this script in the HEAD section of your index file.\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        var agent=navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase();\n        var is_iphone = (agent.indexOf('iphone')!=-1);\n        if (is_iphone) { window.location =\"http://www.yourPage.com/iphone\" }\n</script>\n\nand redirect your visitor to iPhone compatible page. See an example on http://www.barisoztekin.com\n\nA: You can do it from the environment settings passed to a CGI or app called by the server. The HTTP_USER_AGENT field describes the client connecting to the server, and is what is often used to branch or redirect based on a particular browser.\nThe downside to sensing with that is it can be spoofed and/or changed in a lot of client software. \n\nA: Typically this is done server side by evaluating the User Agent that is passed with the HTTP request. I believe iWeb just publishes static pages and doesn't support dynamic content. In that case you will probably need to resort to using JavaScript so that the redirect is performed client side.\nBe careful when using this approach though as it has the potential to create a poor user experience. It would be best to establish a way to allow the user to view the page if they really want to. Typically this is done with a cookie if the user selects that they want the 'normal' site rather than the 'mobile' one. \n", "Q: Utility for Visualizing Network Traffic via SNMP I'm looking for a piece of software akin to Cacti, one that is preferably much easier to set up, and has a high-quality frontend to it.\nI had a headless Linux desktop that I used to poll my Time Machine and graph network statistics off of, but that computer is currently undergoing repairs, so I'm left with the remaining computers I have in the house, which are all Mac.\nI have no specific requirements that I consider as a sticking point. My baseline of features would be something with the granularity that Cacti/RRDTool provide. Graphs with scalable units of time/history (configurable is a plus!), quick/easy to get started with little installation is preferable, something that perhaps just runs as a daemon/program and doesn't require a web server and detailed tailored configuration (read: discovery) would be just fine, and possibly even preferred.\n\nA: Unfortunately I'm not aware of any serious competition to Cacti, but have you considered using a Cacti virtual appliance? There are several pre-configured VMs available with everything pre-installed and ready to go.\nCacti 0.8.7g\nrPath Cacti Appliance\nYou might also want to take a look here:\nA Half-Dozen or So Essential Open Source Network Administraton Tools\nand in particular at:\nGraph Network Performance with NRG - Part 1\nHe also has a page on how to install Cacti on OS X.\nNow I can't say that this meets your desire for something as simple as a typical OS X application install but it certainly meets the free requirement.\nI can't say I've played with any of these tools on OS X bar Mac Ports which I consider an essential on any OS X system.\nAnother really simplistic app (OS X widget actually) is iEyeNet, it definitely meets the free and simple criteria but isn't anywhere as configurable as Cacti. I tried it with my Airport Extreme and it \"just worked\".\nAnother option is documented here, it uses a combination of MRTG/Lingon/Geektool to generate and display the network graphs. Reasonably easy to setup...\n\nA: I know this is an old topic and also I'm aware of how sensitive recommending one's own application can be (especially in case of a commercial application), however I think this does answer the OP's question exactly. If this is not allowed (I tried looking for a policy in the FAQ), please let me know and I will take this down. \nI've been looking for such application for OSX myself. I couldn't really find one (except for the afore mentioned iEyeNet, which didn't meet my requirements) and so I've decided to write one myself, which gave me the opportunity to learn a bit of Objective-C. \nI call it iNetGrapher. I think it will meet your requirements although it's not free. It's very simple to install (essentially get it on Mac App Store), doesn't require a web server or any other service / daemon / dependent software, it does autodiscovery of all interfaces on a supported network device / server and it lets you simultaneously graph traffic from multiple interfaces and multiple devices. It supports SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, and in the latter case, both 32-bit and 64-bit counters. \nThere is also a free, good alternative, although it is command line only - it might fit your needs though. It's called ttg - you'll need to open this page and scroll down till you find it, or download the source from here: ttg.c. This one has been written by a good friend of mine. \nI hope this is useful.

I noticed that colors in the Snow Leopard Terminal.app aren't that great (using the Pro theme, but the other themes are worse).\nThere seems to be no easy way to customize the colors, and googling only showed weird workarounds involving SIMBL and forcing the terminal to 32-Bit.\nIs that still the case, or is there a way to change the colors in Snow Leopard's Terminal.app? My shell is zsh, not bash if that makes a difference.\nClarification: I'm referring to the ANSI Colors like Green, Red, Blue etc. By default, the Terminal looks like this:\n\nThese colors aren't that great, I want them look like this:\n\nI have found a 64-Bit compatible SIMBL/TerminalColours plugin, but if I can avoid having to use SIMBL, that would be my goal. I know that there are alternative terminals like iTerm, but I want Terminal.app.\n\nA: As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, the sixteen ANSI colors are customizable in Terminal preferences.\n\nTerminal > Preferences > Settings > [profile] > Text > ANSI Colors\n\n\nWhen you point at one of the color controls it displays the ANSI color name and number for reference.\nWhen you edit an ANSI color there's a button in the color panel for resetting the individual ANSI color back to its default:\n\nA couple of tips about the Settings preference panel:\n\n\n*\n\n*As with most of the Settings, you can select more than one profile at a time (e.g., Shift- or Command-Click, or choose Edit > Select All) and change the colors for all of them at the same time.\n\n*The Settings preference panel supports Undo (and Redo), so you can try out a change (or several changes) and revert changes you don't like.\n\nA: Terminal.app has these colors hard-coded into it. Internal methods like +[NSColor(Terminal) vtRedColor] use hard-coded floating-point constants to set the colors.\nAs you noted, there are SIMBL plugins that can patch this but you've already noted their current limitations. SIMBL has been updated to support 64-bit applications, so you should contact the authors of the plugins to request that they rebuild them to support 64-bit. There's also another SIMBL plugin to consider.\nThe only other option for Terminal.app is to write a feature request at http://bugreport.apple.com and hope that somebody at Apple is enticed to add color customization to Terminal.app for Lion.\n\nA: ANSI escape codes might do what you want. They're not as popular now as they were when everyone worked at a terminal over a modem, but they're still work in Terminal and iTerm and such ilk. I wouldn't be surprised to find that Terminal is using them behind the scenes to control its colors.\nYou might want to look at IBM's Prompt magic page. ANSI codes should allow you to customize the colors if you start with the Basic terminal profile.\nWikipedia has additional info at ANSI escape code.\n", "Q: Ports in the TimeCapsule \nIn a few days I'm going to buy my first Mac (an iMac) as well as a Time Capsule. Looking at the specs of that product, I've seen that it has a WAN port and 3 Ethernet Ports. \nI suppose that the WAN port is to connect the TimeCapsule with the Internet. At home, I get Internet trough a Ethernet wire (it's not an ADSL connection). \nMy question is: will I be able to connect the Ethernet wire into the WAN port in order to share my Internet connection wirelessly over the house? \n\nThank you so much!!\n\nA: Yes, that is the port you'll use. If you use one of the other ports, Internet access will sometimes work but the device will think it won't. \nUse the WAN port for your apartment's inbound Internet (whether an Ethernet cable or from an ADSL or cable modem), and the other three ports for outbound to your local machines that aren't on wireless.\n", "Q: MacBook will not turn on I have a MacBook pro and it won't turn on. Basically I press the power button and the White light at the front turns on.

So any help no matter how big all small would be very welcome. And I'll add a bounty for all my reputation if answers start appearing. \n\nA: There is a problem with the NVIDIA graphics processors that can prevent the MacBook Pro for powering on. I have a 2008 15\" MacBook Pro that had symptoms similar to what you are describing about a month ago. I took it to the Genius Bar and they determined that it was the NVIDIA chip causing it and replaced the logic board for free despite the fact that it was not under warranty and I didn't have AppleCare.\nMy recommendation is to take it in to the Genius Bar and have them check it out. I have found they have great support and have fixed problems out of warranty (such as this one) on more than one occasion. However, it looks like from the comments on another answer that you have done this already. It might be worth a shot trying again and take the support article with you to see if they change the diagnosis.\nOr perhaps this answer might help someone else experiencing the same problem.\n\nA: Run Apple Hardware Test. It sounds to me like a dead hard drive. That's relatively simple to fix. If you have backups, you'll be fine. See what the test says and let us know the results. We can advise over where to go for service / how to go about a DIY repair. If it is the disk (I'm 80% sure), it's quite easy to do yourself (and not too pricey).

Purchases are tied to your iTunes Account, not to the device.\n\nA: iTunes purchases are tied to your account. The current policy (January 2011) is that you can download apps for free once you've downloaded them the first time. Music and movies do not have this courtesy.\nThat said, if you purchase an app with your iTunes account on your iPod, you can log into that account on your computer, iPhone, or iPad and download it again.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to create custom text format style and apply to hotkey in Pages?

Does it require a computer with home sharing enabled to download it to?\n\nA: A single movie will usually be between 1-2G. The amount it will want to buffer will depend on the speed of the buffering.\nHaving a reliable sustained download speed of about 300K/s then it should buffer and start playing within a few seconds.\n\nA: The Apple TV has 8 GB internal memory for buffering (You can't access this and you can't put your own files in that memory). Rentals (just like Netflix) only need to buffer a very small part, so they play almost immediately and stream after that.\nI don't know how much of the movie it keeps, but even if you fast-forward it always only downloads a minimal part of the movie.\nI don't think you can purchase movies on Apple TV, only rent them, but I may be wrong.

In this case iTunes would be running on another computer rather than on the Time Capsule.\n\nA: I have actually tried this and there are two ways the first is the shared location works well most of the time.

Over the past decade I've come to acquire a random selection of large hard disks from my older computers. While most of the stuff on it isn't vital, there are fair bits of music I made over the years just sitting on them. \nI'd like to have all these files stored in some kind of library kinda like the way iTunes does it... HOWEVER.\nA lot of it is either crap, or the disk may even contain large groupings of game audio files etc. \nI don't want to bog my actual iTunes library down with this nonsense. So can anyone recommend me an alternative that will essentially scan these old disks and add any content to its library. \n\nA: You should try Songbird. It's an open source media player with Firefox-like extensions. It supports lots of file formats, unlike iTunes.\n\nA: In addition to Songbird that lpacheco suggested (and also I think it's best Alternative) you have some other choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Instinctiv\n\n*EverPlay\n\n*PicoPlay\n\n*Banshee\n\n*VoxApp\n\nA: You could create alternative iTunes libraries. \nJust hold the Option key while starting iTunes and point it to a new directory. To go back to your main library quit iTunes and start it again while holding the Option key. \nIf you are on Windows, the Alt key should have the same function, I don't remember which one.\n\nA: One option would be to create playlists for all of these files you don’t really like and then have a smart playlist which displays all music not in those playlists. Then, all you have to do is avoid the main library view of iTunes and only use that smart playlist as your stating point whenever your browsing for songs to play.\nIt’s not an optimal solution, however, because every now and then iTunes will show you the main media library again and you’ll have to manually select the smart playlist view again. (And because you get a useless number before each entry.)\nI’d be great, if iTunes had an option to create a second (or even more) ‘Music’ view in the library for all the stuff that is secondary.\n", "Q: How can I cancel an app installation on the iPhone?

This will cause iTunes to start downloading the app.\n\n*Go to the Downloads tab in iTunes and delete the download.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Pause the download by tapping the icon\n\n*Turn the phone completely off (with red slider) thus disconnecting the phone from the app store\n\n*Turn the phone back on, when prompted to sign into the app store click cancel so that the download does not resume\n\n*Press and hold an icon to enter \"shakey\" mode\n\n*You should now be able to delete the icon/download by tapping it. I was prompted that I would still be able to down load from the app store \n\n\nA: I found that turning off the iPhone,waiting 10 seconds,then turning it back on,and then deleting the app(holding it down till it shakes and then tapping the x) worked best.

I have had my blackbook for a little over 4 years now and think it's time to upgrade to a new macbook pro. I'm currently running leopard on the blackbook with time machine. I'm wondering if time machine is the right way to move my data from my old mac to the new one.\nMy main concern is that if I do a full restore, I will lose the new software on my new mac (e.g. - Aperture). I basically want to migrate all of my music (from itunes), a bunch of files/projects, photos (I don't use iPhoto), etc. I probably don't care as much about applications.\nWhat's the most painless way of doing this?\nNOTE: I would like to be able to use my time machine harddrive with the new computer for the same purpose.\n(Extra credit if anyone can comment on migrating Eclipse workspaces. I'm pretty sure just moving all the directories over will work fine if I just reinstall Eclipse on the new machine.)\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The best way to do this is with Apple's Migration Assistant. Plug the Macs into each other with an ethernet cable and launch Migration Assistant on both. Follow the instructions on screen.\nI've migrated to new machines seven times and it's a pretty flawless system. Based on other answers I'm pretty sure that Eclipse won't really know the difference after migration as long as your short name on both Macs is the same.\n\nA: I wouldn't recommend a full restore, assuming it's even possible (Apple can sometimes be a bit funky about system releases on new machines). What you should do is a home directory migration, which I believe you can do from your time machine backup with Migration Assistant when you set up the new machine.\nWhat you want to be careful to do to be as seamless as possible is make sure your new user account has the same shortname as your existing one. That should clear up any snafus you might have with migrating Eclipse as well (I think I saw a related issue for Eclipse on Super User that suggested this.)\n\nA: For eclipse workspace, migrating the workspace folder will be OK (if you have all your source files inside the folder). At first launch, Eclipse will ask you to set the workspace folder. You'll give this folder and your projects will be there.  If you have the source files elsewhere, you will have to copy them and keep the same folders structure for Eclipse to find the files.\nFor the Time Machine Disk. You will be able to use the same one. Another folder will be created to store the backup of your new laptop as there is noe different folder per physical machine. So no worry on this side.\nFor the rest of your files, it will be on a case by case as you just want to migrate a part of it. As said already, you can migrate your home directory with the Migration Assistant (in Applications/Utilities).  As for the main part of Apple applications, if the files are managed in the library, an export/import of the library will be fine. If not, you'll have to do the file copy by yourself. \n", "Q: Can I use a non-Apple keyboard with OS X? Recently I've been thinking about the idea of migrating from PC to Mac, specifically Mac Mini. The biggest issue however is hardware, since I'm not sure what will and what won't work on OS X.\nFirst issue that comes to my mind is keyboard, currently I'm using Logitech G15. If I connect it to a Mac, how well will this work with OS X specific keys like Option, Cmd, etc? Does it work out of the box with all keyboards, or should I rather buy the Apple keyboard?\n\nA: If the keyboard is USB, it should be fine. That USB thing is important though - there are no PS2 ports on a Mac. I was able to use my cymotion keyboard with no hassle, but as Kyle pointed out, I needed to remap one or two keys.\n\nA: I use a PC keyboard with my MacBook Pro and I just recently ran into a problem.\nI'd like a quick keyboard shortcut to sleep the computer without a popup.\nThere is a shortcut that uses the \"eject\" button, but my keyboard\nhas no \"eject\" button.  There doesn't seem to be any way to redefine the shortcut,\nor any way to emulate the \"eject\" button.\nSo that's a data point for you.\n\nA: I'm using a Microsoft keyboard with my new Macbook pro and its fine. Recommend the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic keyboard 4000 v1 to anyone. It will save your wrists.\n\nA: Macs work just fine with non-Apple keyboards. Alt becomes option, and the Windows key becomes the command key. And if you want to rearrange them, you can easily do so in the System Preferences:\n\nHowever, I prefer to use Apple keyboards with my Mac as they have buttons on the top to control expose, volume, and pause/rewind/fastforward of media playback. Apple keyboards also have the command key better positioned for keyboard shortcuts than the Windows key is on regular keyboards.\n\nA: Just in case Keyboard pref setting doesn't stick, try to combine it with KeyRemap4MacBook\nSome explanation by myself over there.\nBtw, don't be surprised if vendor's drivers act weird or even cause kernel panics - last time I checked, three months ago, the Microsoft driver still wasn't fully functional on Snow Leopard. And I installed it on my Mom's mini…\n", "Q: How can I set Spotlight metadata to files? I am looking for a command line utility (I need to use it in a script) that can set Spotlight metadata to files.\n\nA: You can always use the command line tool xattr, which lists/reads/writes/erases the filesystem's extended attributes of a file.\nThat's what spotlight uses to build it's index.\nNote that spotlight information keys are prefixed with com.apple.metadata:\nAs quick example, to change the display name on spotlight of a file:\nxattr -w com.apple.metadata:kMDItemDisplayName MyNewFilename.txt ActualFile.txt\n\nto access xattr help, type on t:\nxattr -h\n\n\nA: I don't think there's a way to -- the Spotlight indexes are generated by metadata importers that scan files and figure out their properties.  If the relevant importer doesn't detect some property, then as far as Spotlight is concerned it doesn't exist.\nNow, it might be possible to change the actual file in such a way as to add properties to its index entry.  This page claims you can add extended attributes starting with \"com.apple.metadata:\" and they'll be added to the spotlight entry for the file, but I couldn't get it to work.  The SpotMeta project extends the import system to add extended attributes to the spotlight database, but only works on OS X v10.4.  Not an actual solution, but that's as close as I could find...\n\nA: Here is a Python function I use to write Finder Comments to a file using the system shell. They show up in Spotlight, but not in the Get Info box...\ndef writexattrs(F,TagList):\n    import subprocess\n    \"\"\" writexattrs(F,TagList):\n    Writes the list of tags to xattr field of file named F\n    \"\"\"\n    plistFront = '<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"><plist version=\"1.0\"><array>'\n    plistEnd = '</array></plist>'\n    plistTagString = ''\n    for Tag in TagList:\n        plistTagString = plistTagString + '<string>{}</string>'.format(Tag)\n    TagText = plistFront + plistTagString + plistEnd\n\n    WhichAttribute = \"com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment\"\n    # Other attributes you might want to try: [\"kOMUserTags\",\"kMDItemOMUserTags\",\"_kMDItemUserTags\",\"kMDItemkeywords\"]\n    XattrCommand = 'xattr -w {0} \\'{1}\\' \"{2}\"'.format(WhichAttribute,TagText.encode(\"utf8\"),F)\n    # optional, print command format to check:\n    # print XattrCommand\n    ProcString = subprocess.check_output(XattrCommand, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,shell=True) \n    return ProcString\n\n\nA: If you have installed Apple Developer Tools (usually appears under /Developer/Tools), then you have access to the SetFile and GetFileInfo commands which both assist in manipulating metadata of files. \nAdditionally, I found a set of command line utilities called osxutils that may prove useful with additional requirements that come up while writing your scripts.\n", "Q: How do I set up an Exchange Account in Mac Mail? I am having trouble transferring my account settings from Entourage to Mac Mail.  Specifically, what is the equivalent setting in Mac Mail for the Domain setting in Entourage?\nIn Entourage I have the following account settings.\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n  Name: My Name\n  E-mail Address: me@mycompany.org\n\nAUTHENTICATION\n  Account ID: myUserName\n  Domain: NETBSA\n\nSERVER INFORMATION\n  Exchange Server: https://path.to.webmail\n  [x] This DAV Service requires a secure connection\n\nI can see in Mac Mail where all the other settings match up when creating a new account, but I'm not sure what \"Domain\" means or where I can specify it in Mac Mail. Is it some quirky Microsoft thing that only Exchange supports?\nWhenever I try to set up my account in Mac Mail the server just times out.\n\nA: Domain shuld be the beginning part of your username when you logon to your machine or account at work.  It's the name of your internal corporate network.  It looks like this when you sign on to machines at work:\nnetbsa\\myusername\n\nYou might need to specify this format as your username in mail.app.  However, if it's timing out, it's probably more likely that the server settings are wrong.  Don't use the https:// part in the server settings and see if it will connect.\n", "Q: Why is my iPhone 3GS proximity detector not working? Whenever I use the phone on my iPhone 3GS, it detects my face's proximity and dims the screen. However, once the call ends and I take the phone away from my face, the screen does not brighten again until I press the power/wake button, at which point the screen returns to normal.\nWhy is this happening? How can I fix it?\nSome basic info: I'm running iOS 4.1, jailbroken.\n\nA: I don't remember ever reading about a problem with proximity sensors in iPhone 3GS running iOS 4.x. The well-known problem was with iPhone 4, and it was fixed in iOS 4.2.1.\nI guess you will have to restore your iPhone, either to verify that your problem was caused by some rogue app you installed via jailbreak or to take the phone to an Apple Store.\n", "Q: What's a good IE tester for Macs? I just moved to the Mac after years and permanently moved my PC out of my life at home. I am a graphic designer who builds web pages. I code pure XHTML pages with div layouts. But whenever you keep to web standards, you have to check out how it works on the most commonly-used browsers.\nOn the Mac, my default browser is Firefox (Chrome and Safari are also installed). But I cannot see the result of how my pages look in IE.\nOn a Mac, is there any way to test web designs on IE?\n(IE for Mac is not supported by Microsoft any more, so I didn't download it. I've received several suggestions to use Boot Camp, but I don't want to install Windows.)\n\nA: If running a virtual machine isn't interesting, I think your best bet is to get a cheap PC with a Microsoft OS.\nYou can run it without a monitor and connect to it using Microsoft's free \"Remote Desktop Connection\" software so you don't have to physically type on a different machine to test things. There are a few different versions of IE you may wish to test. Microsoft has virtual-machine-based copies of their browsers for this purpose [1]. These images can't be run in a traditional VM on your Mac due to licensing problems. They will run on the cheap PC.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyId=21EABB90-958F-4B64-B5F1-73D0A413C8EF&displaylang=en\n\nA: I understand you don't want to install Windows. However, thats what all Mac-users at our company do (with vmWare fusion).\n\nA: The most common ways I know of doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Virtual testing:\n\n*\n\n*BrowserCam\nScreen capture and Remote Access service for cross platform compatibility testing and HTML design quality assurance\n\n*Adobe BrowserLab\n\n*Browsershots\nCheck Browser Compatibility, Cross Platform Browser Test\n\n\n*Your local library often has PCs available for patrons to use\n\n*Ask a buddy to test it/take screenshots for you (often, in return for you doing the same for them on the Mac)\nEven if you had IE/Mac installed, it wouldn't help you any in this regard. It used a different rendering engine; one that no version of IE/Win has ever used.\n\nA: There is a Way to use the regular IE7 and IE8 for Windows via Wine. A short German tutorial is available at http://www.webmasterpro.de/coding/article/internet-explorer-auf-mac-os-x-installieren.html.\n\nA: I've been using http://ipinfo.info/netrenderer/index.php and it works well, though obviously not as good as vmWare. If I was working with webpages just a bit more often I would probably invest in a virtual windows-machine.\n\nA: I would suggest a virtual environment so that you can clone your virtual machine to host different versions of IE on every virtual machine (at least IE version 7 and 8 need to be tested and version 9 is about to be released).\nBeside the commercial offering (VMWare Fusion and Parallels) there are also open source projects like Virtual Box that you can use to start experimenting.\nYou'll need a valid Microsoft Windows XP or Windows 7 license so that you can install Windows on the virtual machine.\nRegards\nMassimo\n\nA: You don't. No IE-testing suite is completely accurate, and several will raise errors which don't appear in production (wasting your time on false positives). Virtual machines aren't as reliable as people think - I've seen several VM-specific bugs whilst trying to run IE6 (I think IE6's rendering engine relies on the coordination of certain threads, which VMs can't quite manage properly).\nIf IE6/7 functionality matters to your organization, I\n", "Q: How can I sort notes in the built-in notes app by date created rather than date last saved? I've found how to do this on the desktop, but haven't noticed how to achieve this on any of my iOS devices.  I'd also be happy to know if this actually isn't possible.\n\nA: Hmmm, it's not possible. The built-in Notes app is quite straightforward. You should look for another app which will allow you do to this. There are tons of Notes app (free or not) on the AppStore.\nedit: As Dori said, Evernote is really good and allows you to sort like this.\n", "Q: Import Google Voice Contacts Into iPhone What I'd like to do is have my Google Voice contacts available on my iPhone, not the other way around.  I recently had to restore the phone to factory defaults and it's a pain to manually enter all them all.\nWhen I make a new GMail e-mail account on my iPhone it won't let me import contacts from my Google account, but even if it did I don't want every single contact in my phone.  Google for some reason adds every single person I've ever sent e-mails to into my contacts list, which as you can imagine is quite a large list by now.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for how to do this?\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to the Contacts tab of the GV sidebar. \n\n*Click the Export link at the top right. \n\n*Select which you want to export. \n\n*Use the Outlook CSV format if you've got a PC and the vCard format if you've got a Mac. \n\n*Import it to Outlook or Address book (depending on your system) and set iTunes to sync contacts to the iPhone from that program.\n\n\nA: You can trim the contacts you have and setup google sync via exchange and it should only sync your contacts from \"My Contacts\"\nEdit your contacts here:\nhttp://www.google.com/contacts\nhow to set up your iPhone with google sync:\nhttp://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=138740&topic=14252\n\nA: Set up your iPhone with the Exchange Servers that Google has. I have mine set up for just Calendar and Contacts sync. For instructions, take a look over here. Also, take a look over at the Google Voice iPhone app - it's fairly useful, and it can (and indeed has for my dad at least) replaced Messages.App and Phone.App on his iPhone.\n", "Q: How can I stop my device open being reset to iPhoto When I plug in my Camera (Toshiba Camileo H20), it always opens in iPhoto. Because I want a little more control over the import process, I would like Image Capture to be the default app for it. \nWhen I open up Image Capture to change the 'connecting this camera opens' drop down, and select another app, as soon as my mouse has left the selection, it reverts back to iPhoto. This is regardless of which other option I select.\nThe computer is an iMac 2009, with OS X 10.6.5 (Snow Leopard), and Image Capture v6.0.1 (428). The Camera is connected via USB, and appears in Image Capture as 2 Mass storage devices (internal + the card). The card device (2nd) is exhibiting this problem, the first device does have Image Capture set as its default when connected.\nOther notes - each device now has a different name (Not just NO NAME for both).\nHow can I stop Image Capture reverting my choice for behaviour when the camera is connected?\n\nA: Image Capture and iPhoto have cache locations to store the status of pictures and camera roll information for each device. It's likely those preferences and databases are corrupt.\nIf you have a recent backup, you might try quitting the apps and cleaning some of these by moving them to the trash:\n~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.Image_Capture*\n~/Library/Caches/com.apple.iPhoto/Cache.db\nWithout emptying the trash you can reboot and test to see that it fixes the issue and doesn't cause other issues before emptying the trash. You can quit the apps and move things back if it causes you issues - but these should be regenerated from a normally working system (and yours is either slightly confused or potentially not working so well)\n\nA: Hmm, this is quite odd behaviour. I would try clicking 'Other' in that drop down menu, and then clicking 'Image Capture' from the Applications folder windows that drops down. This may make it work. Hope this helps. \n", "Q: What MIDI hardware do iOS 4.2 compatible devices support? (Apologies ahead of time if this question belongs in the audio production stack exchange. Since this question directly involves iOS, it seemed more appropriate here.)\nA while back I ran across a webpage which claimed to have a maintained list of which midi devices were tested on iOS devices for compatibility. Does anyone know where I could find this list or one like it?\n(For those interested, it was discovered during the betas for 4.2 that, by using the camera connection kit, one could connect certain midi devices to the iPad and transfer midi data back and forth.)\nThank you,\n-b\n\nA: I just came upon the site I was looking for in relation to this question. I'm posting it in case others inquire.\nhttp://iosmidi.com/\n-b\n\nA: Every USB device that is compliant to the USB Midi class specification which does not draw significant power from the USB port works as a midi device using the camera connection kit.\nMost devices that do draw from USB power can be run using a powered hub connected to the camera connection kit when the powered hub is plugged into an electrical outlet.\nSome USB midi devices do not completely follow the USB Midi class, and they may not work, or will only work erratically, but this is rare.\n", "Q: How to make terminals open side-by-side? I use terminals a lot, and I frequently open and close them. The problem is that whenever I open a new terminal using ⌘+n it overlaps the current one, and I have to move it out of the way first. Is there a way to make them open side by side from top left to bottom right?\n\nA: This behavior won't happen in OS X by default, but a whole bunch of 3rd party window-arranging apps ought to be able to help:\n\n\n*\n\n*SizeUp http://irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/\n\n*Divvy http://mizage.com/divvy/\n\n*Breeze http://www.autumnapps.com/breeze/\n\n*ShiftIt http://code.google.com/p/shiftit/\n\n*Mercury Mover http://www.heliumfoot.com/mercurymover/details\n\n*Optimal Layout http://most-advantageous.com/optimal-layout/\n\n*Cinch http://irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/\n\nA: You could also check out iTerm 2. One of the nice features it has is the ability to split panes, each one of which shows a different session. You can slice vertically and horizontally and create any number of panes in any imaginable arrangement. It also offers a number of other improvements over Terminal.app.\n\nA: Try using the tabs feature. When you're in a Terminal window, press Cmd+T and a new tab will open up alongside your current one, just like in Safari. You can even rename the tabs by double clicking the tab header, and assigning a title. Hope this helps.\n\nA: There is not going to be a way to accomplish this out-of-the-box, you will have to have some sort of third party window management utility. There very well may be one that works automatically, but I haven't quite found one yet :).\nMy two recommendations (in this order only because I've used Divvy, not SizeUp) are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Divvy - $14, Divvy is a very sleek little utility. On it's face, the use case is to have the application window open and active that you wish to resize, then call up Divvy either by clicking it's icon in the menu bar, or hitting a defined activation shortcut, which calls up a 6x6 grid on all active screens (multi-monitor aware!) which you can drag a cutout on to move+resize your application window.\n\n\nYour use case would likely involve creating a global shortcut to define a 1/2 left and a 1/2 right cutout on the primary screen. You can then click the terminal you want, press this series of shortcut keys, et voíla, 1/2 width slots for your terminal windows.\n\n\n*\n\n*SizeUp - $7, SizeUp will likely be quicker to start for you if all you ever want is the 1/2 left 1/2 right capability. It already has predefined shortcuts for halfs, corners, and moving windows around Screens and Spaces, but that is (to the best of my knowledge) where the functionality ends.\n\n\nCheck them out, decide what you want, maybe do a little more research to see if something else exists.\nI seem to recall seeing a question on this site regarding the Windows 7 feature of Window snapping. Drag a window to the top of the screen to maximize it, left to 1/2 left it, right to 1/2 right it, but again my term selection seems to be... inefficient. That and window shopping for price is always in your best interest.\n\nA: Apart from the tools already mentioned above, there is BetterTouchTool, a very nice utility that allows custom finger tap gestures on a Magic Mouse or any multitouch trackpad. I have configured it to make windows snap to the left or right half of the screen by simply using a two-finger hold-and-tap gesture. Not as nice as a tiling window manager, but quick and easy nonetheless.\n", "Q: Fast or automatic way to organize iphone/ipod apps Is there a tool or application that can help me quickly organize my iphone applications?  The standard way of dragging and dropping 1 application at a time in folder is too frustrating for me.  I gave up after 1 hour of trying... I found it to be such a waste of time ...\nI am looking for an application to automatically organize my apps in the standard folder categories at least (Productivity, Navigation, Photography, etc).  I was not able to find one in the iTunes store.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Connect your phone to iTunes, go to your phone in the sidebar, and select the Apps tab. There you should find some slightly less tedious app management where you can rearrange icons and/or screens. Perform a sync when you're finished reorganizing.\nThere's also a Jailbreak app called MultiIconMover, but the Jailbreak apps for messing with icons is a whole other kettle of fish...\n\nA: You don't have to do it one icon at a time: just hold SHIFT to multi-select icons on a single page!\n(You can multi-select folders along with the icons, too).\nThen you can drag them all at once to a new page, or inside an existing folder (or out of a folder).\nMuch faster than one at a time!!\n\nA: Have you been doing the organisation on the device, or in iTunes? I find iTunes a lot easier for this.\n\nA: Take look at this video. You create category and then go select apps you want in that category from list as oppose to dragging them. I find it a lot more faster and easier to do:\nInstallerApps\n\nA: There is a jailbreak tweak called mutliIconMover which will let you move multiple icons at once. I find it indispensable for quickly re-arranging my icons.\n", "Q: Is there any way to upload screenshots directly to FTP or image hosting and give me the url? Is there any application for screenshots that could upload directly to FTP or any image hosting site and just give me the URL?\nI come from the Windows world, where I got used to FastStone Capture, where you basically press print screen, click on FTP and it copies the URL into clipaboard so you can immediately paste it for example on IM.\n\nA: If you use Dropbox (and you should), I recommend GrabBox. When you take a regular screenshot (command-shift-3, command-shift-4, etc.) it automatically uploads it to your public folder, grabs the public URL, optionally shortens it, and copies it to the clipboard.\n\nA: i think tinygrab (http://tinygrab.com/features.php) can do it\nyou can also roll your own if you want.  \nHere is a link to the code below for working with imgur:\n#!/bin/sh\n# version 0.3\n# 2010-02-12\n# description: bash alternative to grabup using imgur.com\n# todo: add error code checking/reporting\n#       report upload speed & time via growl\n#       copy to clipboard on 'click on notification'\n\napikey=\"7d9157e3bb2823aadb62a40e30e10dcc\"\ngrowlecho (){ echo $@ | /usr/local/bin/growlnotify -t QuickGrab -a /Applications/Utilities/Grab.app; }\n\n# work in temporary directory\ntempdir=`mktemp -dt quickgrab`\ncd $tempdir\n\n# start screencapture in interactive mode unless...\nif [[ \"$1\" == \"-m\" ]]\nthen\n    screencapture -m tmpfile.png\nelse\n    screencapture -i tmpfile.png\nfi\n\n# check if tmpfile.png exists before continuing\nif [ -f tmpfile.png ]\nthen\n    # upload via imgur.com api & output to response.log\n    curl -F \"image=@tmpfile.png\" -F \"key=$apikey\" http://imgur.com/api/upload.xml > response.log\n    LOGFILE=./response.log\n\n    # if no errors (return 1), copy url\n    A1=`xpath $LOGFILE \"/rsp/@stat='ok'\"`\n    if [[ \"$A1\" == \"1\" ]]\n    then\n        # copy url to clipboard & growl success\n        echo `xpath $LOGFILE \"//original_image/text()\"` | pbcopy\n        growlecho `xpath $LOGFILE \"//original_image/text()\"`\n    else\n        # growl failure\n        growlecho \"$A1\"\n    fi\nfi\n\n# delete temporary directory\nrm -r $tempdir\n\n\nA: Two of the best apps for this are CloudApp and Skitch.\nCloud app has an option to automatically upload screenshots (image courtesy of Softpedia). It is very drag and drop friendly and pastes the URL to your clipboard for convenience.\nSkitch is a little more heavy on the screen snapping controls. It's like grab on steroids. You can quickly hide private information, point out items, and edit the snap before uploading.\nThe free version of both are well worth it. Both have paid upgrades that are low cost, but you don't need to pay to use either. I have also heard really good things about Droplr so you might check it out as well.\n\nBoth CloudApp and Skitch are available on the App Store. The two are better together - skitch is better for grabbing a great screen shot, and droplr for upload and sharing it.\n\nA: Dropshare is another paid option that has come along - in the vein of TinyGrab and LittleSnaper (which Realmac has replaced with Ember) mentioned already.\nBoth the OS X and iOS version can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upload to S3, Rackspace or your own server (via SCP over SSH)\n\n*Global hotkeys for uploading clipboard, screenshot/recording or note (MarkDown supported)\n\n*Create optional, custom landing pages for your files\n\n*Sync connections/preferences via Dropshare's own sync service\n\n*Shorten URLs using services or custom shorteners\n\n*Delete previously shared files directly via the app\n\n\nThree-day trial of the OS X version's available at their site.\n\nI've been pleased using it for the past few months.\n\nA: I wrote a small python script to do that.\nIt will not just auto upload screenshots to imgur but also copy screenshot url to clipboard and open up browser with link instantly.\nCheck it out:\nVideo Demo:\nLink\n\nA: LittleSnapper is designed to work with FTP and copy the URL after upload. Upload is a separate step from snapping, so you will have to set a key command or automate that for the exact functionality you ask.\nThere is a free trial version from the RealMac website - so you can see if it's what you want before buying a license.\n\n\n", "Q: Custom \"mouse\" gestures for Trackpad on Macbook Pro and Magic mouse Is it possible to create custom gestures for Macbook Pro Trackpad and Magic Mouse to custom actions? For example to close a window or launch some application.\n\nA: Not so sure about the Magic Mouse, but for the trackpad there are a number of options.\njitouch looks very customisable, but costs.\nBetterTouchTool works with the Magic Mouse. It gives you a PrefPane that lets you assign loads of gestures with loads of actions, including opening Apps. I'm sure it has capability to close windows as well. \nHope this helps!\n\nA: Another useful tool is MagicPrefs, although it really shines with the trackpad.\n", "Q: How to show hidden files and folders in Finder? I have a folder that starts with a dot . but am unable to display it in Finder.\nHow can I say that for folder x, Finder should also display hidden files/folders?\n\nA: I don't think you can set this for individual folders. To set it globally, so that Finder always shows hidden files, run Terminal and enter the following two commands:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles true\nkillall Finder\n\nTo switch back, do the same but substitute false for true.\nThis works all the way through macOS Catalina (and betas for Big Sur).\n\nA: In the Finder, press CommandShift. to show hidden files & folders.\n\nA: You can customize Finder through Terminal commands such that it defaults to show/hide hidden files. \nTo show hidden files and restart Finder:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES; killall Finder /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app\n\nTo hide hidden files and restart Finder:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO; killall Finder /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app\n\ns\n\nA: I myself use hiddenfiles widget. it's so easy to use.\n\nBeside that you can use free 3rd-party software like Deeper or TinkerTool.\n\n\n", "Q: Can I have multiple mice & keyboards for one Mac? I would like to control two cursors with two mice in the same time, as well as have two keyboards for separate control and text input.\nMy goal is to have two users on one computer, so I can let my brother to play/chat anything while I do my job. If we have two monitors, then I don't need to buy a new computer.\nIf you know of some software that can do this, please let me know.\n\nA: You can achieve something very close to this with a virtual PC solution. I tried it with Parallels. For simplicity I'll assume you run Mac OS X on the \"real\" computer and Windows in Parallels (of course you can run another OS too, I just picked one to keep the story simple).\nIn the Parallels settings, you can choose which USB devices should be connected to the Mac and which to Windows. If you connect your external keyboard and mouse to Windows, you get a warning that this will disable input from them on the Mac, but this is exactly what you want. Be sure to disable mouse pointer synchronization (in version 5 it's called \"SmartMouse\"), otherwise you won't see the Windows mouse pointer.\nNow you can use the external keyboard and mouse only in Windows, and the main keyboard and mouse anywhere. This is also useful if you want to override something your brother is doing :-)\nDoing this in a Mac only environment is currently not possible because it would require changes in the window manager, which is part of the OS. There is a project that does this for the X window manager, but this will not work to control every window on your Mac. TeamPlayer is software that allows you to control Windows with multiple mice, but with the exception of their own programs, you control the computer in turns: only one mouse can give real clicks, the others must wait for their turn.\nA complete solution is Userful, but this runs only on Linux, because, as I said, it requires modifications at different places in the software stack and only Linux is open enough to allow this. Microsoft created a similar project: Windows MultiPoint Server, but this is targets to schools and I doubt you can get it. And of course, it only runs on Windows.\n\nA: Actually, its not that simple.\nThe calls software makes into the operating system assumes up to one keyboard and up to one mouse. Anything more would require the software know how to tell the difference between them.\nI have heard of 'virtual' solutions for Windows that allow a PC to have its resources divided up to two sets of keyboard, mouse and monitor. I am unaware of such a solution for the Mac however.\nIf such software existed, I would still be wary of using it. The performance burden of two users at once may be worse than you would tolerate, especially if one is play a game and/or playing music as is implied in the question. In addition its cost, whether it be in the time to setup and maintain this two-headed machine or the funds to acquire software capable of this task, may be more than simply buying another computer.\n\nA: macOS has screen sharing and can make two user accounts in system preferences. One for each of you.\nAttach the second keyboard, mouse, display to an iPhone or iPad or raspberry pi or other low cost computer you own and when the second account connects, you will be asked if you want to share the same screen with your brother or start a second distinct virtual-only session.\nI believe 10.7 OS X Lion was the first OS to support this.\nEnjoy!\n\nA: In a nutshell, this is not possible. User interaction with the Mac OS is assumed to be single user. Two input devices will function simultaneously, but you cannot render two cursors or have them function in parallel. The only way to have two users on one Mac is to provide accounts via netboot, which still requires separate hardware.\n", "Q: Preparing my MacBook Pro in case it is ever stolen How might I best prepare my MacBook Pro in case it is ever stolen?\nI hardened my security by flipping on FileVault (home directory encryption) and enabling the password prompt after waking from sleep or screensaver. My account has a secure password.\nBut then if a thief steals my laptop, they'll be completely locked out. So then they will be forced to reformat, and any potential security measures I have will be thrown out the window. Should I then create another user account or something, to allow them a way into my laptop without compromising my home directory and let something like Prey run in the background?\nCan I enable some sort of guest account for this purpose, is it a good idea, and what is the security implications of doing so? And then what else should I do to protect my laptop and allow me to potentially recover it? What are my options besides Prey for sneaky background things? How do I prevent the thief from reformatting my laptop and bypassing everything entirely? (is there a BIOS-level theft prevention program?)\nHow can I best ensure that I can recover my MacBook Pro if it is stolen or lost, while also keeping my physical security of passwords and such to prevent anyone from walking up and using my computer when I'm not looking?\n(2010 MacBook Pro, OS X 10.6.5)\n\nA: You want to set an Open Firmware Password. This makes it so that a thief needs a password to boot to another disk (or do anything other than a normal boot). This means that they can't reset your password from the OS disc and get in anyway. This is an important security measure to take. The only problem is that you can't do things like safe boots and verbose mode. Here is an article about how to set up the OF password (and how to reset a user password).\nAnd here is a general article about physical and virtual options to increase security (ways to help locate a stolen Mac, make thieves think it's broken, or even just lock it to your desk).\n\nA: Considering the other answers, and the possibility of not getting a laptop back, perhaps you need to consider using time machine for a backup, and put the target NAS somewhere not close to the laptop - like in a discrete cupboard with good wi-fi coverage, or a wired ethernet port. You should do this anyway - for the dozen other reasons that the data on one hard drive may become irretrievable.\nThat way, you can have reasonable drive encryption, as even with the OF password, it does not prevent them removing the drive and using it in another machine to retrieve interesting contents. Your bank details may be far more value to some thieves than a working MBP depending on their level of sophistication.\n\nA: I use and like Undercover by www.orbicule.com\n\nA: Use Find My Mac.

I want to setup a virtualized OS X for testing instead of going to buy another mac. Can I do that technically and legally?\nTo be explicit I do own a mac already.\n\nA: You can do it technically. Legally I think you can do it if a) The VM is on Mac hardware and b) you purchase a unique disk (license) for the OS in the VM.\n", "Q: Can the Lagom.nl \"Inversion / Pixel Walk\" screen test truly indicate a problem on a 13\" MacBook Air? My 13\" MacBook Air (late-2010 model) shows strong flicker on some of the following \"Inversion / Pixel Walk\" test images from the LCD test on the site \"lagom.nl\". Does that truly indicate a quality problem with the screen (as the test says), or is it a normal side effect from the screen technology that any 13\" MacBook Air would suffer from?\nI do notice that when scrolling say a web page or Pages document, the image noticeably flickers while scrolling. This might be due to the problem this test is supposed to detect, but I'm not sure. Web pages with a striped background where the stripes are just 1 pixel high also show annoying flicker (even when not scrolling).\nThe test images: http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/inversion.php#inversion-all.png\nAt full screen brightness on my 13\" Air, I can see strong flickering on test image 3. Some of the other images show some slight flickering too, but 3 is particularly strong. By \"strong\" I mean that the flicker is clearly visible even from over 1.5 meters away from the screen (and yes I measured that).\nI had a chance to test it out on two store models of the 13\" MacBook Air and couldn't see any strong flicker, but I did forget to turn up the screen brightness so I'm not sure. Neither my 20\" Cinema Display nor some MacBook (Pro) and PowerBook screens I tested showed any strong flicker. But note that the Air's screen has a higher pixel density, could that affect this test?\nAnd if it's a quality problem, is it something I should / can demand Apple to fix or replace? (I still have a few days of return period left; it might just be a minor nuisance, but do I have to put up with that considering the price of the machine? ...)\n\nA: Every Mac I've ever owned does this same thing. Don't demand a replacement. \nAs an aside, monitor flicker is sometimes noticeable because the 60Hz refresh rate is the same frequency as house electrical current. This causes your lights to blink at that rate. This is usually imperceptible, but can be noticeable with a monitor if they get synced up. This is more common with CRTs, but not unheard of with an LCD.\nDon't worry yourself over this. Did you notice problems with your display before the test?\n\nA: The flicker is caused by the technology (TN) used in your MBA. It's noticeable when brightness is high and under some of the tests. I have 13\" MBP 2010 and I can register flicker on 2a and 4a tests when brightness is above 50%.\nUsually under normal use this shouldn't be noticeable.\n\nA: As noted by others, the amount of pixel walk varies from screen to screen, even in the same model. My experience is that this has nothing to do with it being a TN panel as IPS screens get pixel walk, too.  \nIf it is noticeable on solid colors, I would consider it defective. Especially if you have one display that is noticeably (i.e. your non-technical uncle or other disinterested party would agree that one of the several identical models was \"off\" upon a casual demonstration of normal use. Basically, a one minute test with identical web browsers up - ask the \"helper\" if they all look the same when scrolling). When something is made that different than another model, seeking an exchange from the manufacturer seems like a reasonable request.\n", "Q: Software to sync external HD and NAS - must work with FAT32 I am a photographer and archive my images on a NAS (LaCie Networkspace), but as this is a single point of failure I also back my images up to an external harddrive. However, when I am away from home I archive my images straight to the external hard drive.\nI would like to be able to keep these devices in sync to ensure that al images are on both drives.\nLooking at the \"Favourite Mac software\" question, I saw Carbon Copy Cloner mentioned, which unfortunately only works with HFS+ formatted drives, so I can rule that out. I have also tried LaCie's SilverKeeper software in the past, but could not get this to work correctly. As it seemed to think that there were too many errors and just stopped working each time I tried to sync.\nCan anyone recommend some reliable and intuitive software for this task?\n\nA: I used the Intego sync software that comes with LaCie drives. It wasn't great, but it did the job. It is FAT32 compatible. You can get the free LaCie version here (version depends on the drive; you need the code that came with it). LaCie's instructional article is here.\n\nA: I'm not sure on the ettiquette of answering your own question, but when I downloaded the Mac App store I came across Get Backup Lite (App store) which seems to be a lot better than the Intego software that comes with LaCie drives. I've tested it on a 100GB folder between an external drive and a NAS, it was slow, but that was probably more to do with it being a network drive.\nThere is also a Pro version (App store), which adds 2 way sync and encryption, which I may upgrade to in the future.\n", "Q: New Apple ID not pushed to iPhone I recently changed my Apple ID from an old email address to my current one. I updated the Apple ID in iTunes and then synced my phone with iTunes. Now, however, when I try to download new apps (or update existing ones), I get the standard notification asking for my Apple ID Password, however the Apple ID that is displays is my old Apple ID. When I enter in my password, it tells me that \"Your iTunes Store password was incorrect. Please Try again\".\nI believe the problem is that for some reason iTunes is not pushing my new Apple ID to the device. Anyone know how to rectify this problem?\n\nA: On your iPhone, go into Settings -> Store, sign out of your old Apple ID and sign in with your new one.\n", "Q: Can spyware affect the iPad? I tried to login to my gmail, hotmail, and facebook accounts today. I could not login to those three because they said that my password is incorrect. So I tried to think what I did yesterday. I only used those three websites on my iPad.\nOne thing I noticed with iPad's safari is that it does not warn me for suspicious websites like Chrome or Firefox do.\nI concluded that either someone hacked my facebook account and found primary email accounts from facebook and hacked my emails (since they all use same passwords) or my iPad has been hacked. Is it possible that my iPad was hacked?\n\nA: Don't be so quick to jump to conclusions, there are other possible attack vectors. iOS Safari is one of the most secure browsers because of the sandbox design of iOS.\nFirst and foremost, do you use the same password for all three? Password reuse is a dangerous problem, because if one account is compromised an attacker can try that same password on other websites to see if you have the same password there.\nSecondly, how complex is your password? If it's a word (or combination of words) from the dictionary, attackers can run automated login attempts to guess short passwords. If your password is short and only contains words then it's much easily guessed using this method.\nThirdly, there's no guarantee that the passwords were compromised in the last 24 hours, it could have happened in the past week.\nIn any case, change those passwords soon and promptly, make sure they all have different passwords, and try to use numbers, symbols, or uppercase letters to prevent a dictionary attack. Also don't use common tricks like \"password1\" or \"abc123\" or \"blink182\" because attackers keep common passwords like that on file for dictionary attacks.\n\nA: To date, there has never been a spyware issue on any iPad. Apple's OSes are generally highly secure; even the desktop OS has few such issues.\nSo, rest assured your iPad is highly secure, much more so than any Android tablet.\n", "Q: How can I get \"Automatically fill free space with songs\" to reserve more space than a half gig On my iPhone 3GS (32GB) I want to keep more than .48GB free space when I tell iTunes to \"Automatically fill free space with songs\" for doing things like taking pictures/recording videos.\nI don't want to create a playlist by hand to do the same thing. I like how it randomly comes up with new songs to put on there (and yes I'm aware of the \"random\"ness of iPods ;) )\nDo I have any options?\n\nA: Unfortunately no, the automatic filling takes place during sync, and only gets changed in size if you add/remove things that will also take place during sync.\nIf you want to limit it while also preserving some of that randomness, try creating a Smart Playlist that will select songs at random, and then tweak the \"Limit to\" feature until you have enough space free. It limits to number of tracks not size, so it won't be exact, but it will allow you to (roughly) tailor your size.\nEdit: Actually I made a mistake, it is possible to limit to a GB amount\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Smart Playlist\n\n*Under \"Match the following rule:\", select something broad like \"Media Kind\", \"is\", \"Music\"\n\n*Tick the checkbox next to \"Limit to\"\n\n*Select \"items\" and change it to \"GB\" and enter your desired GB amount\n\n\nA: Neth, you don't need to recreate the smart playlist to get a new random order : just select all tracks in it (command+A) then delete them with the backspace key. They'll get randomized, nothing gets \"deleted\".\n\nA: According to this question it is possible. I don't have an iPhone to test with.\nFrom what I read it's important that when you connect the iPhone/iPod go to the summary tab of the device. Click on manage music manually and then press Apply before going to the music option under the device on the left-hand side.\n", "Q: How to stop \"password reset\" emails from Apple? Every day or two, I get another \"how to reset your AppleID password\" from Apple.  They assure me my account is secure.\nI've never gotten more than one of these from any other individual service, ever.  It's getting pretty annoying with the Apple ones, though.\nShort of deleting my Apple account altogether, is there any way to stop this?\n\nA: If you're getting these, it might mean someone is trying to hack into your Apple account. And they don't know your password. Though they would be stupid to keep pressing the Reset link unless they're also trying to hack into your email account to get the email too. I don't assume the emails come with an IP of the computer sending the request? Maybe you could contact Apple and see if someone on an outside IP is trying to access your stuff.\n\nA: You can stop getting these emails by switching your account to two-step authentication now that iCloud and Apple ID support that. Do keep in mind, that if you receive that email, someone (or some bot / computer script) is telling Apple to begin the reset procedure for your account and if they happen to have compromised any step in the email chain between you and Apple - they can take control of your account.\nYou'll no longer have security questions to ask and Apple will never allow the password to be reset via emails from iForgot.apple.com. You'll instead get a SMS code (or iMessage) to a trusted iOS device or use your recovery key and current password to reset the password going forward.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple ID: Frequently asked questions about two-step verification for Apple ID  - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5570\n\nA: I get these all the time, and it's not even Apple's fault.\nIf—like me—you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a me.com or mac.com email address as your Apple ID\n\n*Have a common username (such as steve, @ either mac.com or me.com)\n\n\nThen every Joe or Jane who comes along thinks that they have joe@mac or jane@me, can't sign in, and tells Apple to reset the password. Apple does what it should do and sends you an email telling you how to reset your password. Again. And again. And again.\nIf you're in the same situation, there's nothing that can be done about it (short of giving up that nice mac.com address).\n\nA: Check that the home page/remembered pages in one of your browsers is not the password reset URL. Is there a particular time every day that you get them?\n\nA: I got three then the next one said you've changed your password...I think my account was hacked. Another today so whoever it was us still trying!  Don't ignore the emails \n", "Q: What control / access does the exchange team have over my iphone when using the exchange connector? I work at a small company (80 employees), when we deployed MS Exchange anyone who connected their iphones using the exchange connector lost the icon to the camera on the home screen. The engineers made some changes and the camera icon returned. What other access / control does the exchange team have over our phones? Can they view email (personal and exchange?), photos, web history etc?\n\nA: From a quick glance at http://www.apple.com/iphone/business/integration/ -- Exchange can set password policies, network access (including VPN), restrictions on use of YouTube and iTunes, prohibit app installs and use of the camera.\nMore information at: http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/Enterprise_Deployment_Guide.pdf\nI don't see anything about viewing web history, etc. -- but if you are on a company WiFi they could theoretically see what websites you are viewing.\n\nA: They can reset your iPhone remotely.

Would you please confirm that it is not possible to add an arbitrary RSS feed to Flipboard on my iPad? I find this so hard to believe that I'm in doubt I missed something...\n\nA: Actually, it can be done very easily: Just put the name of the feed, or its URL, in the search box. Flipboard will find it. And then, you can select it, and add it.\n\nA: Actually you CAN load a specific feed to Flipboard.  Start by adding Google Reader.  Then launch into it, and click on the downward facing Triangle next to the headline \"Google Reader.\"  It will then pop up a window showing you your various feeds.  Select the one you want, and its name will appear as the new headline and you will only see stories from that feed.  Then click the little \"+ content\" symbol in the upper left, and it'll add just this single RSS feed to your main flipboard page.\n\nA: You are correct that you cannot add an arbitrary feed, and as @Mike Scott noted, you have to add your entire Google Reader account.\nFrustrating because Flipboard is absolutely not a good way for me to read the bulk of my feeds -- Reeder is perfect for them -- but I'd love to add a few feeds that I rarely read to Flipboard, feeds that fit its visual style.\n\nA: You can add an arbitrary RSS feed by creating a Google Reader account, adding the feed to that, and then linking it with Flipboard.\n\nA: From the Flipboard tips page:\n\nDiscover Great RSS Feeds.\n  You can use the Google Reader service to access RSS and then read and interact with your feeds right in Flipboard.  You can also use the Search feature to find any RSS feed by name, website URL, or RSS link.\n\n\nA: More to the original point, unlike Twitter, Google Reader is not fully integrated with Flipboard as you can not add RSS feed to your Google Reader on your iPad app. Disappointing as Google Reader is a best archiver/database of all feeds you are following. \n\nA: Yes, but it's based on blekko.com cached search result which may not be up to dated.\n", "Q: OS X Dock+ Window/App management I'm working on my Mac for video editing from time to time and normaly use Windows and Linux.

I would like for someone to outline the differences between buying a time capsule vs. just getting an airport extreme and attaching an external harddrive. The latter seems more flexible (easy to change external harddrive) and even cheaper, yet people are getting time capsules.\nWhat are the pros and cons.\nThanks.\nUPDATE\nCould you please elaborate on:\n\n\n*\n\n*How easy is it to setup with an airport extreme. (Apple explicitly mentions you can add a harddrive to airport extreme, but doesn't say anything about time machine. Is there anything more to it?)\n\n*What are my options if the Time Capsule harddrive fails and/or I need more storage later.\n\n*What are the differences in the router capabilities, e.g. - number of ports, number of supported users, usb jacks, etc.\n\n\nA: As above the Time Capsule is the easy solution.\nI can only really comment on your second point, I bought one about 3 years ago and 18 months ago the hard drive failed, it seemed to be a known problem as Apple replaced the Time Capsule free of charge even though it was outside of the warranty period. What could not be replaced however was the 18 months of backups as Apple would not have replaced the Time Capsule had I opened it up to get a the drive and try to recover the data. So after that experience I won't be buying another Time Capsule.\nIf you are not particularly after a router there are now other companies that offer Time Machine compatible network storage, which may be worth looking at.\n\nA: If you are considering alternative solutions to a Time Capsule, and since you seem particularly worried about hard drive failure and future expandability, you might consider getting a Drobo. It's a storage system that spreads your data over multiple drives, allowing you to hot-swap drives when one fails or you want more storage. The company has an article on their page titled \"Drobo Complements Time Machine function of Mac Leopard OS X\". However, note that this is a storage solution only, it doesn't provide wireless network connectivity. There's a Drobo model that can connect to a network via Ethernet which in turn you could connect to an Ethernet+Wireless router, but I am not sure whether using it that way is compatible with Time Machine. Also, this is far from cheap. But given your concerns over hard drive failure and future expandability, you may want to check it out further.\n(I originally wanted to post this as a comment on LC1983's answer and Tom's follow-up comment, but because I don't have enough reputation to post it as a comment I tried my best to turn this into a \"potential\" answer to the question. My apologies for not fully answering the question though.)\n\nA: Note that according to the following page, it is possible to set up an AirPort Extreme for use with Time Machine but it's not recommended:\nhttp://web.me.com/pondini/Time_Machine/Airport.html\nThe same site nevertheless also still provides instructions on how to set it up. I'll post the link in a comment below (due to lack of reputation points I can only include one link in my answer). You can also find other advice there such as on how to keep multiple backups if you're particularly worried about the need for that; see the link \"FAQ\" at the top of the page for an overview.\n", "Q: How to install an app on iPhone from a second machine? I actually took many hours this morning to find out how to do it, but I want to see alternatives to it.\nI got my iPhone in sync with my iTunes at home, my first machine. I could \"just\" bring the app folder/file back home and sync through that. It works just fine.\nThe question here is on alternatives to that. Jailbreak or not, how could we do it on a second machine?\nedit: I mean to install an actual file like application.app or application.ipa just like they are on the Mobile Applications folder or on iPhone's own /Applications one.\n\nA: For most users, the headache free method is preserving the iTunes folder in its entirety and bringing it over to the other computer. You would then sign into the account you obtain the app with on that computer, and authorize it.\nIf you're simply without the first computer and want to get the app back, then you would simply re-download from the App Store for free (assuming it hasn't been removed).\n\nA: I seem to remember this question being asked before, but the link eludes me at this moment. \nIn short, you can't. iPhone syncing is on a per iTunes-installation basis. Plugging the phone into a different machine and trying to sync will result in iTunes asking if you want to wipe the data and re-sync from the new iTunes repository.\n\nA: It's quite simple if you have iOS SDK installed. I've found the solution in the first place I should have looked for, because I actually generated the app file using Corona. But I suppose this is irrelevant to the question.\nOpen Xcode Organizer, plug in the iDevice and drag n' drop the app into \"applications\". That's it.\nNow, if you don't have iOS SDK, I highly recommend against installing it just for this. It's almost 5GB of downloading. This is why I'd like to know of alternatives.\nedit: I believe the best way is using the iPhone Configuration Utility, yet again like that guide from corona. I've confirmed it works just like using the Organizer, but it doesn't need the Xcode. Just download it (this needs a free login, or find another place on the web with that file, v3.2 is about 10Mb), and drag the app / ipa inside your phone.

I need to replace the keyboard on my iMac G5, and I'm considering the MacAlly keyboards, probably the iKey Slim as it's available for less than $20 with shipping and tax. It also has two USB ports on the back, which I need. My only hesitation is that I saw a review on Amazon that mentioned a driver problem. I'd prefer to avoid installing any drivers. The MacAlly site isn't of much help. \nCan anyone tell me if MacAlly keyboards come with drivers? If so, are they necessary? If they are needed, am I best off buying an old Apple keyboard on eBay or is there another brand I should consider? (Kensington's Mac keyboard looks nice, but expensive.) \n\nA: I severely doubt that you will need any drivers to make it work out of the box, as nearly all keyboards are just plug-and-play with the Mac, although it seems with this one you only need install drivers if you want to activate volume control and eject functionality. (if it's any help, the driver is located here). This driver appears to be rubbish, not very friendly and unreliable, so if volume control and eject keys are important to you, and you really want to avoid installing drivers, then you had better avoid this keyboard, in my opinion. \nReplacements wise, Apple do great keyboards themselves, particularly the newer slimline style keyboards. These go for about £30-£45 on eBay. They do not, however, come in a wireless form with the numerical keypad, which I know will be a problem for some people. \nApple keyboards come in laptop MacBook layout (wireless), MacBook layout (wired with extra USB port), and MacBook layout with numerical keypad (wired with extra USB port) variations. These all work right out of the box. \nIf you really want an Apple wireless keyboard with the numerical keypad, you can get help with that here.\nIn terms of others besides Apple's, I know logitech do some nice ones that work very well, but thats about all I can tell you I'm afraid. \nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How can I fix the GPS problem that occured after jailbreaking iPhone 3GS 4.2.1? I have an iPhone 3GS (old bootrom) and updated to 4.2.1 via iTunes a few days ago. Then I jailbreaked it via redsn0w 0.9.6b6. I only marked the option to install Cydia, nothing else (i.e. I didn't updated the baseband to 6.15.00; in settings on the iPhone, it says I have 5.15.04).\nNow, it seems that GPS is not working anymore. Why? How can I fix it?\nIf there is not really a way to fix it, what are the options? In any case, I must have GPS working and I must have the jailbreak.\nDowngrade to 4.2 somehow? Or reset it somehow?\n\nA: You'll need a copy of your old SHSH blobs. If you don't have it, I don't believe you will be able to downgrade.\nIf you have your old blobs, grab a copy of the older firmware and follow various guides\n", "Q: Local reverse/duplicate image search for Mac? I'm searching for an application to find duplicate images. \nIn my Linux days, there was a nice Gtk+ application which I could provide some folders and which would list all duplicate images based on some algorithm to determine image-equality (It could detect duplicate images even if one image had a lower resolution or was color shifted)\nIt was also possible to modify the threshold to prevent false-positives.\nSo far, I found nothing for Mac OS X which could do this.\nNice GUI is a plus.\n\nA: dupeguru picture ed is free and does exactly that. http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/22724/dupeguru-picture-edition\n", "Q: Monitoring and disconnecting users from an AirPort Extreme Does anyone know a simple way to monitor who is connected to an AirPort Extreme, see the bandwidth they are using, and the ability to disconnect them or throttle their bandwidth usage?\nI know for disconnecting two options would be\n1. updating wifi password and restarting the AirPort Extreme\n2. setting a limit by MAC address\nbut I am looking for something that wouldn't involve restarting the AirPort each time.\n\nA: Sadly, there doesn't seem to be a native way to do this.\nWith regard to detailed bandwidth monitoring, the Airport Extreme supports SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) so if you want to put in a bit of effort, you could set up Cacti http://www.cacti.net/ and point that at the base station.\nAs far as remote disconnection of users, there is no way that I know of short of the two options you mentioned.\n", "Q: iTunes: What is the usefulness of checked/unchecked songs? I know the functional effect of unchecking a song: it doesn't play (except when explicitly double-clicked) and doesn't sync with an iPod/iPad. But how is this useful? Does Apple officially recommend any sort of usage of the checkboxes? Or, more subjectively, do you make use of the checkboxes in iTunes, and if so, what songs do you check or uncheck and why?\n\nA: It keeps holiday music out of my playlists, off my iPhone, until I want to overdose on them from December 24th through 25th every year.\nFor that alone: I love the check box.\n\nA: I think you sort of answered your own question as far as \"usefulness\" of the feature.  \nAs far as a use case I would use the check boxes more when I had a larger capacity iPod that could fit my entire music library.  The songs I would uncheck would be skits on hip-hop/rap albums and I have a few theme songs from movies or tv shows I would also uncheck.  I would then select the \"Only sync checked songs\" option in iTunes so I would only have to plug my iPod in and it would automatically sync my library except for those that were unchecked.\n\nA: I uncheck tracks that contain dialogues, like the Pulp Fiction OST, interviews in Beatles at BBC, or an interview at the end of the Aqualung 25th Anniversary.\n\nA: There are a few good case scenarios here to show why they exist. One for myself is that I have a lot of lectures in my iTunes library, but do not want to listen to them regularly. Unchecking them will ensure they neither sync to a device, or play unless I selectively choose to play it.\n\nA: Almost all the answers so far seem to be things where a smart playlist might be a better solution… but given that, here's mine:\nThere are a lot of bands that have one great album and a few hit-or-miss albums. For them, I buy the good album + the greatest hits.\nBut that leaves me with duplicated songs. Yes, they're really good songs, true, but they're still dupes. Those, I check off so they only show up once.\n\nA: They can be used to solve the dreaded \"remove all files with exclamation marks\" problem.\nSee https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/35813/646\n\nA: Some DJ dance compilations add, in addition to all tracks, a mixed version of the album as a single 1-hour-length track. (As the last track in the album).\nIt's very useful for this scenario.\n\nA: I typically don't uncheck tracks, but when I do, it's typically because I've ripped an entire CD, and there are tracks that I don't think I will want to hear, except on rare occasions.  If I wasn't completely pedantic about having everything I own in my library, I'd probably just delete those tracks, but I don't want to have to dig the CD out of a box and re-rip it, should I change my mind in the future.\nI think most other uses are better supported using smart playlists.  IMO, checkboxes became mostly pointless after Apple introduced smart playlists.\n\nA: In my case, I've added an audiobook to my iTunes to listen to on my iPhone while I'm out of the house and want to, but can't, read my book. (I get carsick while reading, etc.) However, it's 20 discs long and averages 20 tracks per disc. I want to keep it in my iTunes because I spent quite a bit of time adding all of these discs and adding information, but I also don't want to have it popping up with my music randomly! Also, I don't want to bloat my poor phone with the entire thing. So I sync like four discs at a time, and uncheck the ones I've already listened to and ones I don't want on my phone yet!\n\nA: I have a lot of duplicate songs - the same song by the same artist, from different CDs. I compare them and uncheck the one that is not as good quality as the other.\n", "Q: How does the Docx rendering in Pages compare to Mac Office 2011 It's about time for me to bit the bullet and buy either iWork 09 or MS Office 2011.  My main concern is rendering docx files (I've been using OpenOffice for many years, but the .doc and .docx rendering is still suspect).\nHow do they compare?\nDoes Pages render a docx file at least 95% accurate?\nFrom the info online I understand that Pages cannot save in docx format.\nWhich do you prefer? \nTo clarify\nI'm talking about more complex layouts. \n\nA: To answer my own question.\nI've found that Pages does a much better job at rendering more complex DOCX layouts than OpenOffice currently. Pages does not save in DOCX format.\nBTW.... You can get pages for $20 through the new Apple App Store :)\n", "Q: Connect to Mac Mini and browse files - works on one Mac but not the other Edit: Case closed! I reinstalled my OS and now it's working.\nI've got one Mac Book, one Mac Book Pro and one Mac Mini (the latest version). The Mac Book can easily connect to and browse files and folders using Finder on my Mac Mini via my wifi network but not the Mac Book Pro and I think I've set everything up right - enabling file sharing on the Mac Mini and also screen sharing. Both file sharing and screen sharing works from my Mac Book using the main admin account on my Mac Mini.\nWhen connecting from my Mac Book Pro I'm able to connect through Finder and see the shared folders on my Mac Mini but when double clicking a folder (for example the folder called \"Richard\") I get this error message:\nThe operation cannot be completed because the original item for \"Richard\" cannot be found.\nThe error message is actually in Swedish, since that's my language, but I'm pretty sure it's translated exactly like this on a default Snow Leopard installation.\nAlso, a weird thing is that when I first set up my Mac Mini I was actually able to access it and browse files from my Mac Book Pro as well, but just for a week or so and then this error message started showing up. Don't know if I might have changed any settings but I don't think so.\nDoes anyone have a clue what this problem is due to and how I might be able to solve it? I would love it if I could at least get some hints on how to address the problem - what to look for in the system preferences etc. And please let me know if I'm not giving you enough details!\n\nA: The error sounds like it's unable to resolve the alias to the original source. What I would do is remove the shared folder(s) from the Preferences on the Mac Mini, and recreate a preference for a specific folder (ie. Public), with further testing. If the issue were to persist, I'd create another User and test from there.\n", "Q: iPhone Calendar.App and TimeZones Is there a way to make the iPhone's Calendar App support timezones with appointments, or is there an alternative App that has multiple timezone support? I have a friend with an iPhone 4 (4.2.1) who travels around quite a bit and always struggles to book appointments with people when he's outside of his home country, the U.S. \nThe conversation might go something like this:\n\n[The scene is a New Zealand Beach on a Sunny January 5th]\n\"Let's met for lunch a 2pm, sushi, my shout\"\n\"Sweet, so, 2pm new zealand time is 12pm yesterday american time, so I'll put it in my iCal at 12pm yesterday\"\n\nHe needs iCal to be smart enough to adjust to the timezone of the country he is in. His iPhone does figure out local time from his telco and adjust that when he enters a new country. \n\nA: Both iCal on Mac OS and Calendar on iOS have timezone support where you can tell it what timezone to use to show your calendar.  It didn't seem clear which you were asking about, so here's how to enable and use it on both.\nOn iCal on Mac OS, it is located at:\n\"iCal\" menu -> \"Preferences...\" -> \"Advanced\" tab -> \"Turn on timezone support\"\n\nOnce enabled there, your iCal window will have a menu on the right top that allows you to select the timezone to use.\n\nOn Calendar on iOS, it is in the system preferences at:\n\"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\" -> \"Time Zone Support\" all the way at the bottom\n\nYou can turn it on there and select the timezone in the selection below the toggle.\n", "Q: Syncing iPhone Contacts with an Exchange Server Happy new year! \nI'm using an iPhone 4 with 4.2.1.\nOn the iPhone with Exchange Server, how do you get the group 'All On My iPhone' to sync with the exchange server? At present everything but that group is synced.\n\n\nA: I'm using Google sync, which works like an Exchange server, so my experience may not be 100% the same as with a full Exchange set up.\nI had to import all of the contact to the server (I did this through the Apple contacts app on my Mac) then synchronised them from there. I deleted all of the contacts from my iPhone to prevent contacts being displayed twice. So in short I'm not sure that it is possible to synchronise that group at all.\nFWIW I also disabled synchronising contacts with my Mac through iTunes, leaving Exchange to handle all the contact syncing.\n", "Q: How to sync the data structure of my iPod touch with that of my iPad? I have two device: iPod touch and iPad. All of them use the newest OS.\nI have a folder in my Windows, call it c:\\mybook.\nI put all my pdf books into this folder. No nested categorizing folder for sure.\nI import these books from iTune using CTRL+O (add file to library). Then I sync my iPod touch.\nFrom within iPod touch, I make collections based on genres such as Physics, Math, Biology, etc. I move each book to the proper collection. All books have been arranged and I am happy.\nNext... how to make the arrangement in iPod to be reflected to my iPad? Hopely using the simplest method. For sure, my iPad has been restored to default factory without any data now.\nThank you.\n\nA: Sync your iPod Touch configuration back to iTunes and then sync your iPad with iTunes!\nFor syncing your iPod configuratuon you must only connect it with iTunes. Every time it will be created a backup of the device. After that you connect your iPad (which has been restored to default factory) with iTunes. \nThen you can do the following steps which are described on the apple support sites (Restoring your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch).\n", "Q: How to fix an iPod Classic with a bad hard drive? I've an iPod Classic 160 GB bought in 2007. \nI've never had problems copying songs into it, through iTunes, but from the beginning I never had much success using it as a portable hard drive. Whenever I tried copying large files, or many files, into it, it would hang and reboot after a while.\nThe same happens when I tried copying videos into it, also through iTunes, to the extension that iTunes complains that it can't read or write to the iPod.\nUsually, restoring the iPod returns it to the state that I can copy songs again, but when I increase the usage to videos or large files the trouble starts again.\nI'm pretty convinced it has a bad hard drive, but it is not covered by warranty anymore. Fixing it at a local Apple representative would cost as much as buying a new one, and the ifixit howto is pretty much discouraging, besides stating that video iPod use special hard drives and they don't sell them anymore.\nI was hoping that mounting the iPod in disk mode and running a check disk would mark the bad sectors and allow me use it as a <160GB iPod, but I can't find what tool would do that on the Mac.\nWhat do you recommend? How should I proceed? \n\nA: You can try to diagnose if the disk has a problem with the diagnostic mode.\nTo enter the diagnostic mode, press the folowing key for 5 seconds when the apple logo appears after a reset :\n\"back\"\n\"select\"\n\nIn the diagnotic mode, you can navigate in the menus with the back/next keys and launch a bunch of test, inluding hard drive tests.\nIf the tests shows a disk problem, the solution is to change the disk. Buying a second-hand ipod disk from someone who breack his screen won't normaly be very expensive.\n\nA: It wasn't clear from your question—can you mount the iPod as a hard drive?\nIf you can, try running Disk Utility on it.\n\nA: Buy a new drive\nWhen you are certain the drive is broken (and this does happen), you can buy a new drive (for example on ebay).\nYou can find another link to buy the drive, and an installation guide on how to install the drive on iFixit\nI had similar issues and replaced the drive with succes. It is not so hard to do it yourself.\n\nA: Most likely your iPod Classic hardisk has got stuck in retract, but if you are lucky, try the Hard Reset.\n", "Q: When I add a file to iTunes library, does iTunes make a copy of it? If yes, where is the copy saved? When I add a file to iTunes library, does iTunes make a copy of it? If yes, where is the copy saved?\n\nA: There's also a special folder inside your iTunes library folder (Whatever you set it to if not default) called \"Automatically Add to iTunes\" which is a watched folder. Any time you add a file to it, while iTunes is running, it'll grab it and move it to the correct location. I just use this now. I keep an alias to it in a Stack on my Dock.\n\nA: If the option \"Copy files to the iTunes Music folder when adding to library\" is activated, iTunes makes a copy. \nThe default storing location is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 7: \\username\\Music\\iTunes\n\n*Windows Vista: \\username\\My Music\\iTunes\n\n*Windows XP and 2000: \\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\My Music\\iTunes\n\n*MAC OS X: ~/Music/iTunes/\n", "Q: Why is Mac-to-Mac screen sharing just hanging? I have my iMac set up with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Firewall off\n\n*Screen sharing on for specific user, no general VNC password\n\n*File sharing on (with liberal access)\n\n\nI want to connect to it's screen from my MBPro. Whenever I try to start a screen sharing session from the MBPro to the iMac, either via Finder's screen sharing dialog or by calling the Screen Sharing app directly, it just hangs. And hangs. And hangs. And eventually the \"Connecting...\" window just quietly disappears and no screen is shared.\nI checked Keychain to make sure there isn't a bad password set for the iMac and, nope, nothing there. I'm not being prompted for a user name or password from Screen Sharing when it runs.\nI don't have a central user authority on my network. Each Mac has its own local user settings. But the user names and passwords are identical.\nI can connect successfully using Jolly's Fast VNC. It actually finds the iMac via Bounjour broadcast. But this software, technically, is not free and I'm perplexed as to why the built-in Mac approach isn't working for me.\nUpdate: here are the screen sharing settings on the iMac.\n\nAnd this is what I have set when you click on the 'Computer Settings...' button:\n\nJolly's Fast VNC continues to find (via Bonjour) and connect to this machine without any issues. I have to give it my user name and password for the iMac when I want to connect. Finder, on the MBPro, can connect to the file shares (using my iMac user name and password) just fine. Clicking 'Share Screen' in the Finder window wakes up the iMac -- the display turns on and what not. But the connect times out.\nAre there log files for Screen Sharing on the MBPro I can look at to debug this? What about log files on the iMac for Screen Sharing? Something that might shed some light on why Screen Sharing says it's connecting and then just mysteriously stops?\n\nA: since your a site to site mac network, your networks dns servers need to be update with A records of your mac machine names, to whatever.whaterver.com or .edu or what ever you are,\nthat way the dns can resolve host names to ip addresses, it is especially complex on spaced names, windows machines with simple names are easy to convert, name to ip either via WINS or DNS, so you have 2 choices for the future,\n\n*\n\n*create local name mappings to STATIC ip addresses on the macs into your /etc/hosts file  on EACH mac\n\n\n*buy your it folks some donuts and coffee and kindly ask them to setup some a records in DNS for your macs.\n\n\n*if you have an Xserve it should do this for you, just make sure your directory utility is setup to use it.\n\nA: Since the Screen Sharing feature seems to be the only one unable to connect, the best way to diagnose its behavior is by using the application directly.\nPlease, launch screen sharing located in:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/ScreenSharing.app\n\nThe application has no visible \"UI\" so don't expect a fancy Cocoa interface. Instead, once you have loaded it, all you'll see is this \"poor\" icon in the Dock:\n\nClick on it and then go to Preferences in the Mac menu bar. You should be presented with: \n\nNotice the second option to only encrypt passwords and keystrokes. That's fine, but as you can see, there's no option to skip encryption altogether. Some VNC versions have incompatibilities with encryption, but this would be rather shocking since you're talking about OS X vs OS X. \nIn any case, once you have the settings like that, try connecting, again, in the menu bar: Connection -> New (or ⌘cmd + N).\nA simple dialog appears asking you to enter the Host's name. Following your screenshots, try: 192.168.1.99 and hit enter. \nWe'll see what happens from here. Also, have the Console.app open on both computers, to see if there are any System messages going on (or anything related). \n", "Q: Is it possible to arrange or categorize the imported pdf assets from within iTunes first and then sync the devices (iPod,iPad) with iTunes? Categorizing the pdf assets from within iPad or iPod is possible now. But I think it is more elegant if I can make the categorization from within iTunes in advance.\nIs it possible to arrange or categorize the imported pdf assets from within  iTunes first and then sync the devices (iPod,iPad) with iTunes?\n\nA: You might want to look at Calibre. Famously one of the ugliest Mac apps ever created (although it's much nicer looking now), Calibre is an e-book manager. You can use it to process your books, categorize them, tidy up the metadata etc. and then hit \"send to device\" to copy the books into iTunes.\nI originally used it because my ePub collection for my Sony Reader was in it, and so it was the easiest way to get that to my iPad, but I've stuck with it because it has lots more features than iTunes.\n\nA: Within iTunes-Books, you can view all the ePub books and PDFs you have available to sync to your iPhone or iPad. The PDFs will have a spiral bound edge and the ePubs have either a brown generic cover, the cover art included in the download or the cover art you added via \"Get Info\"-\"Artwork\". If you rename the PDF with a number (01-10...) before the title, it will automatically sort via name and put the 01s together Alphabetically and so on down the number line. This is not as nice as setting up a \"compilation\" like you can do with audio books or multi-CD albums but it should sort your PDFs for you.\n\nA: I took a quick look in the iTunes Music Library.xml and couldn't find my books in there (music, movies, TV shows, podcasts and audiobooks are all in there - books and pdfs are missing). The Book category does not seem to affect the Album/Grouping/Genre metadata of the book (from iPhone to iTunes) and the Album/Grouping/Genre metadata does not seem to affect the Book category (from iTunes to iPhone).\nIf I remember correctly, the iBooks app asked me if I wanted my bookmarks and other data to be stored on my AppleID account and I confirmed. If the categories are stored along with the bookmarks in the cloud then you are in tough luck until Apple decides to add this functionality to iTunes.\n", "Q: Portable apps for Mac? Windows users have the luxury of being able to load a flash drive with specially-modified \"portable\" applications, which run and keep all data contained on the flash drive so that moving them from computer to computer doesn't change the experience or modify the host computer at all. In the past I have gotten various apps from portableapps.com for this purpose.\nNow that I'm a Mac owner, I wonder, is there an equivalent for Mac? At first thought I figured applications could just be copied from the Applications folder onto a drive, since they are self-contained; but I do know a little bit about how they actually store preferences in other directories and some even store things in the Library folder and stuff like that. So applications aren't truly natively portable, even if they require no installation.\nAre there any portable Mac apps out there? Are there some recommended websites for these apps?\n\nA: Big list of Portable Mac Apps here \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.freesmug.org/portableapps\n\n*http://osxportableapps.sourceforge.net/\nAnd if you use Google, you'd find those, and many many other sites...\n\nA: There's a portable Firefox for Mac; I don't know about anything else. It seems that portable Mac apps aren't as useful as portable Windows apps, as you'd usually use portable apps on a kiosk computer or on a loaner computer, and there are very few kiosk/loaner Macs around. \n", "Q: Video/Image processing on Apple iPhone4 I know iPhone 4 supports H.264 and MPEG-4 as video codecs, and JPEG and M-JPEG as image codecs.\nI'm looking to get some information on the iPhone 4's video and image codecs and processing chips/SoC parts.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does anyone know which vendor provides the SoC's to enable image/video compression and processing on the iPhone 4?\n\n*Are the video/image codec solutions - 'Software codecs' on a specialized dsp-core/processor or hard-wired as in a FPGA/ASIC solution? \nAny pointers would be useful.\n\nA: I think you'll get the answer in the iPhone 4 teardown that the guys at iFixit did sometime ago:\nhttp://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone-4-Teardown/3130/1\nYou will be able to see there what components are inside the iPhone 4, but I'd guess all the video compression/decompression is processed by the A4 processor (an ARM Cortex A8 core variant). \nhttp://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Apple-A4-Teardown/2204/1\n\nA: Goldenmean-\nIt's hard to determine, isn't it?  No credible online documentation for A4 cores other than ARM + Imagine Tech.\nAs far as I can tell, Apple currently provides frame (stream) based H.264 decode API, but not encode.  That could be because there's not enough horsepower for multiparty video conf (encode + multiple decode)... or it could just be there is a hardware-assist encode but Apple doesn't want to make it visible through APIs (royalty/licensing issues come to mind).\nOur calculations show NEON is not enough for multiparty video conf -- or at best it may work but shut down everything else.\n-Jeff\n", "Q: Why can't I delete movies from my iPhone 4, either from the phone or through iTunes?  I was on vacation and took some videos, and now the iPhone 4 memory is near full.  So I tried to delete other experimental movies I made using Handbrake, so that I can take more video or photos, but if I plug the iPhone 4 into my Notebook computer, I can seem to delete it on iTunes?\nMaybe because the computer I sync with the iPhone 4 is at home (a desktop), but not with me on vacation.\nI can't delete it on iTunes, can't delete it on iPhone itself.  I am stuck during the vacation, or is there a way to handle it?\n\nA: While not a SuperUser-compatible answer, since the computer interface is missing, I just did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the iPod app\n\n*Go to Videos \n\n*Swipe over a video from right to left\n\n*Press Delete\n\n*Confirm\n\n*Done!\n\n\nNo computer needed. Also works for music\n\nA: I'm not aware of anyway to delete music/video directly from the phone, without connecting back to the original iTunes and telling it to remove the file. If you're jailbroken you could SSH/SFTP into the phone and try removing the file from the phone but I'm not sure what affect that would have on the iPod's index of files.\nI think you might be stuck until you can get back to the original system.\n", "Q: Can I force password protection of specific apps on the iPad? I am unable to find out how to force the iPad ask for my password when I want to use certain applications (e.g. e-mail)\nI want to be able to share the iPad but I don't want anyone to have access to my e-mail account. The only way I can see to do this is to create and delete the account every time I use it, but this is an extreme hassle. Ideally it should simply ask for my password whenever I want to access my e-mail. How can I do this?\n\nA: That's not a general feature of iOS. You can lock the entire device, but not certain applications. \nThe iPad mail app does not have this as a specific feature either - when adding an account you must store the password so it can check for new mail in the background.\nThere are some third party apps for iPad that require a password to access them but I'm not aware of an email app with this feature. But it might be worth a search.\n", "Q: Can I move my iTunes library to a network drive? The question title pretty much says it all. I'd like to be able to free up space on my iMac G5's hard drive. I had considered upgrading the drive, but moving it off the Mac seems like it'd be a better option. \nIf I'm able to do this, might it be possible that other non-Mac computers could make use of the MP3s on the server? I'd love to, for example, be able to access the library when the Mac isn't on, particularly from my ChromeOS laptop and Win7 netbook. (I can post a separate question to SuperUser about that part of the issue.)\nThe mac is a G5 iMac, the drive is a LaCie 2TB drive connected to an AirPort hub via USB. \nWhat would I need to do to get this to work? What about protected AACs from the Apple Store? (I still have a few of those, but most of my iTunes library is DRM-free.)  \n\nA: You certainly can.\nIn iTunes, you can choose where your music library is stored: \nITunes->Preferences->Advanced->ITunes...location\n\nIf you want multiple iTunes accessing the library, it can get complicated. If other music players just use the folder structure, it should just work.\nExtra scripts and config options can be set up so that iTunes uses a small local library if the network drive is not mounted, etc.\n", "Q: How do I connect the location of a calendar event with the iPad maps app? I would like to be able to either navigate from a calendar event to its location within maps, or view all upcoming events on a map. Preferably, both. \nHow do I connect the location of a calendar event with the iPad maps app?\n\nA: Sadly, (as of iOS 4), this cannot be done. The location field of an event does not recognise an address, no matter how perfectly you enter it.\n[UPDATE] In iOS 5, the location field in any calendar event will (if properly formatted) hyperlink to the Maps app.\n\nA: It wouldn't be a perfect solution, but you could try pasting in a maps.google.com link into you calendar events.\nFor example:\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Infinite+Loop+1,+Cupertino,+CA,+United+States&sll=37.331693,-122.030764&sspn=0.007311,0.009871&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=1+Infinite+Loop,+Cupertino,+Santa+Clara,+California+95014&ll=37.331906,-122.031262&spn=0.007311,0.009871&z=17\nIf you open this link on an iPad it should take you to the Maps application.\nBut you would have to do this manually on a computer for each event.\n\nA: There are several apps that have this featured into them.

What reputable stores exist for purchasing RAM for a Mac?\n\nA: Macs and PCs use the same type of RAM just like they use the same type of Hard Drives, if you buy RAM directly from Apple it is definitely marked up.  I have personally had good experiences with Kingston. Other popular 3rd party suppliers are  New Egg, Tiger Direct, and Crucial.\n\nA: Personally I go with OWC. They are more famous for all Mac related upgrades. Here is the memory upgrade link http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/apple/memory/\nMain advantage is you can choose RAM based on your model/ make of the year etc...\n\nA: Once you figure out what brand(s) of memory you're looking for, the place to start shopping is DealRAM.com.\nYou put in what computer you have, and it'll tell you what your options are and where to buy at the best price.\n\nA: I'm surprised no one has mentioned RamJet for Apple memory. Their prices are good, shipping is excellent and their web site is optimized for eliminating mistakes in ordering the incorrect memory. \nI find their site to be the best reference on the web for rapidly finding the memory needs for any Mac bar none - even Apple's on-line documentation pales in comparison to RamJet for memory specifications or planning an upgrade.\nThey use pictures of the products and have very good descriptions to figure out exactly what mac you own. I've made perhaps 8 purchases from them and shipping, returns and customer support are top notch. I do regret buying from one of the \"cheapest\" vendors linked above when the product they sold didn't work and they charged me incorrectly for the return / exchange. It eventually got sorted, but I'll never get back the time and effort to clear up their mistakes on that one order.\nDo your homework on what happens if you need support down the road and know the time periods for returns / warranty / support if you care. I'm more value sensitive than price sensitive but RamJet is generally very competitive on price as well. I'd also put Crucial and OWC in the tried and true category, but I've never seen a time when their prices were lower enough for me to not spend my time and $$ with RamJet.\n", "Q: What's the racoon doing in my apple? I'm not normally one for paraniodly checking my activity monitor for rogue processes; but this one just has my internal nature-watcher all curious. Why is there a racoon running under my root user? What's it doing? Foraging? Looking for nuts and berries? Staring at headlights? \n\n\nA: From Apple's documentation:\n\nracoon speaks the IKE (ISAKMP/Oakley) key management protocol, to establish security associations with\n  other hosts.  The SPD (Security Policy Database) in the kernel usually triggers racoon.  racoon usually\n  sends all informational messages, warnings and error messages to syslogd(8) with the facility\n  LOG_DAEMON and the priority LOG_INFO.  Debugging messages are sent with the priority LOG_DEBUG.  You\n  should configure syslog.conf(5) appropriately to see these messages.\n\n\nA: The documentation link of the main answer is now dead, but you can still run:\nman racoon\n\nand obtain an answer:\n\nracoon is used to setup and maintain an IPSec tunnel or transport channel, between two devices, over which network traffic is conveyed\nsecurely.

You need to remove the parent after removing all of the subfolders.  Then the parent will disappear as expected.\n", "Q: iPhone app to download/upload files How can I upload/download files from/on to a jailbroken iPhone 3G?\nAre there any apps that allow me to do this?\n\nA: http://www.dropbox.com/iphoneapp\n2 Gb free account. No jailbreak needed.\nUploaded files can be private or be made public (accessible via http link).\n\nA: Diskaid will let you manage the contents of the filesystem from your Computer.\niPhoneBrowser will as well, but the interface is much cruder. It is free, though (DiskAid is $10).\ni-FunBox is another free option (though not open source). I have no experience with it.\nOn the iPhone, you can get SafariDownloadManager to download files. It's $5, unfortunately.\nOnce you've downloaded the files, it's likely you will need to move them to whatever application you want to consume them with, so a local filemanager is probably needed.\niFile is a really nice file manager, and is good for moving data files between apps (books, etc...). It's a few dollars, though.\nI believe there are a few free filemanagers on cydia. I'm not familiar with them, though.\n\nA: Install OpenSSH on Cydia (remember to change from the default password somehow - can also be done through ssh of course) and use your favorite SSH client. Here's a little how to suggesting WinSCP. On Mac you can use ssh with Terminal.app or even AFP directly with Finder.app with Cydia's netatalk.\n", "Q: One message that cannot be deleted on iPhone 4 I have a single message in Mail on my iPhone 4 that just cannot be deleted. I get a popup saying Unable to move message - The message could not be moved to the trash folder.\nI'm using the latest version of iOS. The account is an Exchange Active Sync account and deleting other messages is not a problem. I also use the same Exchange account from Outlook on my desktop and the message in question does not exist in Outlook. It only shows in Mail on iPhone.\nI also have an another IMAP account on my iPhone and deleting isn't a problem on that account.\nHow can I remove this rogue message?\n\nA: You could try removing the Exchange account completely and setting it up again. Maybe this also deletes the message.\n\nA: It sounds like Mail got a bit out of sync and it can't move the message because it doesn't exist. Here are a few things you can do to get it to resync.\n\n\n*\n\n*'Quit' the Mail app - from the home screen, double 'click' the home button to show the list of recent apps. Press and hold the Mail app icon until it shakes and displays a red icon. Tap the red icon.\n\n*Restart your phone - always a good thing to try with software and caching problems.\n\n*Re-configure your mail account - this is a bit of a pain, but you should won't lose any messages because they are all on the server.\n\nA: I found that after a month the undeletable email would disappear from the mail app. This I can live with because I don't like the other option of setting up the Exchange account all over again.\n\nA: I had the same problem occur recently with iPhone 5. After several days of trying everything under the sun I deleted the account and set it up from scratch. Not really a solution cause I'll be upset if I have to do this frequently. \n\nA: I found a quick way that worked.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the mail setting \n\n*Unselect mail (checkbox) leave the others as they were. \n\n\nThis takes a minute or so and the corrupt e-mail go.

If I've previously bought a song in iTunes, can I download it again on another computer without paying for it a second time? Both computers are authorized to the same account.\n\nA: If you log in to the iTunes Store with the same Apple ID, you can. Go to the Purchased section (located in the sidebar on the main page) and re-download any songs you wish.\n\nA: No, that is not possible. That is described on that apple support page.\n\nA: You will be able to copy it yourself, with a USB stick etc, or if you are running the latest version of iTunes and both machines are on the same network you will be able to use Home Sharing to identify which tracks are in one library but not the other, then copy them across. You can even set Home Sharing to automatically sync new iTunes purchases.\n", "Q: Do I have to repurchase Apple apps through the Mac App Store to get updates there? Back when Apple announced iLife '11 I bought a copy, but now I see that it's also available on the Mac App Store. If I want to be eligible to use the Mac App Store's built-in update mechanism to update it, do I have to repurchase it through the Mac App Store?\n\nA: Yes, you do have to re-buy to get updates via the Mac App Store. Via Daring Fireball:\n\nThe Mac App Store may show software\n  bought from us previously as\n  “Installed”, even though they’re two\n  different licenses. You will not get\n  Mac App Store auto-updates unless you\n  purchase from the Mac App Store. To\n  re-enable the “Purchase” button in the\n  Mac App Store, just drag the app to\n  the trash. Your preferences/sites will\n  not be affected.\nIn other words, for apps that use the\n  same bundle ID for the both the Mac\n  App Store and non-App Store versions,\n  the Mac App Store will not install\n  updates to already-installed non-App\n  Store versions, but it will recognize\n  them as being already installed. If\n  you want to get updates via the Mac\n  App Store, you’ll have to re-buy the\n  app through the App Store.\n\nHonestly, I'm really surprised by this.\nUPDATE: I'd recommend reading Cabel Sasser's blog post over at Panic about this as it provides a more comprehensive picture of what's going on, and includes some developer-related information.\n\nA: No, you do not need to repurchase an Apple App through the Mac App Store if you want to be eligible to use the Mac App Store's built-in update mechanism to update it.\nYou can perform updates of Apple provided Apps which you bought on CD/DVD (before the advent of the App Store) with the App Store's update feature.  Even though the App is not shown as Installed normally, this changes to Update if an update is available.  This is at least true for me with Aperture.\n\nA: Yes. Unless you buy the apps through the App Store, they will not be official App Store apps. Meaning no reinstalling if you ever needed to, no installing on other Macs, etc. And you won't get updates through the App Store, you'll get updates through Software Update (which you can find in System Preferences).\nHowever, if/when you upgrade to Mountain Lion, which came out last week, Software Update has been integrated into the App Store. So all your Apple software, regardless of whether or not it was purchased through the App Store, is updated in one place.\n", "Q: How do I delete an app purchased through the Mac App Store? I notice that apps downloaded through the Mac App Store are placed in the /Applications folder on my Mac. Is there any special procedure to delete them, or can I just drag them to the trash like I can with other apps? \n\nA: There's no delete mechanism in the App Store. You can use a normal app-removal procedure to get rid of it. Apps leave config information and what not lying around that's outside of the .app container, so just dragging the .app container to the trash doesn't uninstall it completely. An uninstaller app like TrashMe will find and remove most of the little bits apps strew about your profile.\n\nA: If you have Lion, then you can also hold down the option key in Launchpad; the icons will start to wiggle and show little x's on all the App Store installed apps very much like iOS does. Click the x and confirm the deletion and it will be the equivalent of dragging it to the trash from Finder; which means supporting preference files, etc. still remain, but for most users that should be of no concern.\n", "Q: If I delete a paid app purchased through the Mac App Store, can I redownload without paying? If I delete an app purchased through the Mac App Store, can I download it again without paying for it again like I can with iOS? In the event of an app restore, does the app retain settings, saved progress, etc from the previous installation?\n\nA: Yes. Just go to the \"Purchases\" tab and click \"Install\" by the app you wish to reinstall:\n\nWell-behaved apps should retain settings, etc upon reinstall, as merely deleting the app from /Applications is not sufficient to remove that information from your system. This may not be the case if an app cleaner is used.\n", "Q: Change background based on location/wifi? Does anyone know if an application that can change the background of the desktop to a different set of images based on your location?\nI am thinking about writing an AppleScript to do this, but if someone knows an application / script that already does this that would be great?\nI want it to check every time I login to the computer and it would be great if it could do the 1 hour rotation that I currently have, but otherwise a random image from a folder each time I login would be fine too.\n\nA: Anything involving location-aware contexts can be done with Marco Polo.\n", "Q: Recording video to MacBook Pro I have an RCA feed with video.

I've previously purchased several apps (Pixelmator, Rivet, a few others I can't think of now) that are now available in the Mac App Store. Given that apps in the store are not allowed to use their own updating frameworks (like Sparkle), how will I get updates to them in the future? Can I somehow tell Apple that I already own those apps and get updates through the store? Or will the individual developers have to work something out on their own?\n\nA: From Daring Fireball:\n\nPanic on the Mac App Store\nCabel Sasser on what it’s like for existing\n  Mac apps that are now in the App\n  Store:\n\nPS:  If you’re a current customer,\n    there’s no way to convert a previous\n    purchase into a Mac App Store purchase\n    — that requires a re-buy. But\n    remember, what you have now will\n    continue to work just fine.\nUPDATE: The Mac App Store may show\n    software bought from us previously as\n    “Installed”, even though they’re two\n    different licenses. You will not get\n    Mac App Store auto-updates unless you\n    purchase from the Mac App Store.

If\n  you want to get updates via the Mac\n  App Store, you’ll have to re-buy the\n  app through the App Store.\n\n\nA: It depends.\nAs reported in the Daring Fireball link: it doesn't work for some apps like Panic's Transmit, Unison or Coda. The licensing schemes used when you buy via the App Store versus directly from the developer are different and won't allow for it.\nBut this article from Cult of Mac has the author successfully updating a previously installed version of TextWrangler to the latest version via the App Store.\n\nI just tried a quick Mac App Store experiment.\nOne of the more tempting offerings on offer there is TextWrangler, the excellent all-purpose text editor from Bare Bones software. It’s been free on the web for years, and now it’s free on the store.\nI already had a copy installed, but on closer inspection, my existing version was 3.1, and the one in the App Store was 3.5. What would happen, I wondered, if I clicked the “Install” button? Would the App Store version be installed separately? Would there be some kind of conflict? Or would it Just Work?\nOf course, it Just Worked. TextWrangler 3.5 was installed where I expected it to be, and the older version was overwritten.\nSo now you know: if you see something in the store that’s already on your hard disk, you shouldn’t have any problems installing a newer version from there. \n\nI disagree with the Cult of Mac articles conclusion, that \"if you see something in the store that’s already on your hard disk, you shouldn’t have any problems installing a newer version from there\" -- as Panic has directly contradicted that conclusion and they build and sell through the App Store so, pretty authoritative there.\nI did talk to the developer of my favourite Twitter app, Kiwi, and he said he wasn't sure if the App Store could be used to update copies of Kiwi bought before the App Store came in to existence.\nSo welcome to the Land of Confusion. \n", "Q: Migrating from Old to Less-Old Mac - any other specific issues? Scenario - I have a new Mac, and am giving my old one to my father-in-law.\nHe now has an old Gx Gumdrop iMac running 10.3 (I think), and the new-to-him mac is an older Core2 iMac running 10.6\nFrom How can I transfer data from a G5 iMac to an i7 iMac? I have an idea of how to connect the two machines.\nOther than deleting my old data, etc.; any specific gotchas to watch out for, given that I am targeting not a brand-new mac, but an old one?  Can I just trigger the migration assistant (because normally it is triggered as part of the initial install process)?\nThanks\n\nA: Yes, if you're fresh installing the new Mac it will ask if you want to transfer information at the end of the install process - just have a firewire to firewire cable handy and have the old mac booted into target disk mode (hold down T while the old mac is booting up). \nJust check you can boot the old mac into target mode first - I know some of those old macs weren't built with the capability. If you can't target mode just comment on the answer or your question, there are other ways around this. \nThe only gotcha I can think of is any PPC apps (ones that use the older Power PC processors) like AppleWorks will need to use Rosetta to run, which might make them run a bit slow or cause general funkyness with those apps. You'll want to upgrade your Dad's apps to their Intel versions if you can - using something like App Fresh after the migration would be a good idea. \n", "Q: Entourage MyDay replacement I am migrating from Entourage to Mac Mail.

I'm wondering whether it's possible to use Image Capture to scan over WiFi with my EPSON All-in-One SX620FW? If so, how can I set it up?\nI've found instructions from someone claiming it works with their EPSON PX710W, but I haven't been able to replicate these. I can scan without problems over WiFi using the bundled EPSON Scan application, but am wondering if and how I could use Image Capture instead.\n\nA: I've got an NX420, and I can use the scanner with Image Capture over WiFi. What did it for me was installing the drivers that came on the CD (the ones Apple included didn't do it, and neither did the ones on the Epson website).\nYou might try that.\n\nA: Software Update provided me with an update for EPSON printers today and now I can use my EPSON SX620FW to scan over WiFi with Image Capture, no additional setup needed (apart from adding the device in the Print&Fax system preferences panel)!\nThe update is also available through Apple's website:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/DL900\n", "Q: Merge Time Machine Backup Is it possible to merge to Time Machine Backups?\nWhen I look inside the sparse-bundle which Time Machine generates then I see that the folder-structure ordered by dates. So theoretically I could copy the files from my old TM sparse-bundle into the new one. Is this possible?\n\nA: I tried: it works.\nHere is how:\nI have a time machine volume and a backup of it. I update this backup every two months, using Super Duper.\nRecently, several successive mistakes made my time machine volume loose its first two years of backups. I then had a primary time machine volume with all backups but first two years and a backup time machine volume with all backups but latest two months.\nI decided to experiment. Starting from scratch on a new hard drive, I copied the backup time machine volume to the new hard drive with Super Duper (backup all files using erase and save option). Then I copied the primary time machine volume on top of that, again with Super Duper (backup all files, using copy files that are different).\nI ended with a new working time machine volume including all backups, from day one up to today.\n\nA: Simply: Don't!\nTime machine uses hardlinks, that you will not be able to recreate by simply copying stuff around. What this means in plain english is you might end up with each copy of the file taking up space - rapidly filling the drive.\nTime Machine uses great care to only store each file once - and only takes up more space when the file changes. It assumes everything already stored is correct and won't go back and \"fix\" any errors you make. It's possible to make a tool to merge the backups, but Snow Leopard makes it easy to browse both backups. Just connect all the drives and option click the Time Machine icon in the menu bar to browse the other backup drives and see that history.\nMany people have their time machine data on several drives - you can safely put them on the shelf and move to a new drive rather than go back and edit the past. It's easy to move the whole package to a new drive if needed - just not splice data in to an existing backup folder.\nA great place for information is this time machine and internals site  and also the Time Machine discussions forum at Apple (I'm assuming we're talking about Snow Leopard here).\n\nA: Time Machine does not (or should not) work when you tamper with it's files in any way. Even a cloning of the TM backup and restoring it can (and probably will) make Time Machine not work with the backups anymore.\n", "Q: Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad on Windows-7 I am using Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad on Windows 7 and its numeric pad is not working on windows 7, it was working OK on windows XP, what I can do to make it work on it too?\n\nA: Hah! I actually use a mac keyboard as the normal keyboard on my windows boxes. I like the laptop-feel and the aluminium.\nThis is easy to fix. \nPush \"Clear\".\nThe \"Clear\" key on the numberpad gets mapped to the \"NumLock\" key on windows.\nIf you want to fix the swapping of the alt and \"Command\" keys, KeyTweak works well.\nIt can also let you set the additional F-keys (e.g. F13-F19, which are not real F-keys) to be  whatever you want. I have them mapped as media keys (next-track, pause, etc...)\n\nA: Press and hold \"clear\" key for three seconds. It will work as NUMLOCK in windows. You can shift to numerics and the \"<-- -->\" kind of finctions.\nHope it will help.\n\nA: Took me a while to figure out the \"Clear\" key (which acts as NumLock on long-press, in Windows) is the square with the \"x\" inside, on the upper left corner of the numpad, on my Apple keyboard.\n", "Q: Mail.app import from Entourage failed I am trying to import my entire folder structure from Entourage 2008 to Mail on a Mac running OS X 10.5.8.\nFirst I tried to export the whole email database from Entourage to the Desktop as a .rge file.

I checked Console and saw following message:\nMail[2899] Applescript Error: \n  aliasForMailImporter got an error: \n  AppleEvent handler failed.\n\nWhat does that mean and what can I do to move my subfolder structure over completely?\n\nA: Based on the message saying that your Entourage database is corrupt and needs to be rebuilt, I have to guess that your Entourage database is corrupt and recommend that you rebuild it.\nAs the saying goes, \"Garbage in, garbage out.\"\nHere are the directions on how to rebuild your Entourage database.\n\nA: Your first problem is that you're dealing with a corrupt Entourage database.  Rebuild it.  I suggest then using the Jolly Roger script to export all of your mail.  Find it here... http://jollyroger.kicks-ass.org/software/ArchiveMessageFolders.zip\nThen you can import the structure by using the import feature in Mail.app.  Select the most parent folder that has been exported, and it will drop down to all of the subfolders automatically.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Connection to Wireless Network always breaks down I have a Netgear Wireless Modem Router which I have configured to not broadcast it's SSID and the security level is set to WPA2 with a MAC Adress Filter.

Just doing a refresh leaves it there, even when viewing the outbox.  To get them to send I manually need to open each email in the outbox and hit send again (and again specifying what size to make the image).  \nIs there a way to make the photos send automatically, or to at least send them all at once?  Manually sending each one at time is tedious.  The first few times I discovered this I had quite a few emails to send out (some of them more than a month old).\nUpdate: I am sending them from the standard photo app when they get stuck. Then resending them from the standard mail app. The size doesn't seem to matter (small, medium, large or original).  Neither does WiFi or 3G.\n\nA: This fixed itself when I updated to latest version of iOS.\n\nA: I still had the same problem in iOS 6! \nFor historical reasons I had two accounts syncing with GMail. One for the contacts and one for Mail/Calendar. As soon as I reduced it to one account the mails were sent immediately. \n", "Q: How to disable CMD+Q combination? I am using WinOS at the office and MacOS at home. But I am more experienced on WinOS. While i am browsing (via Firefox), I use ⌘ CMD+Q accidentally to write \"@\" mark because of WinOS and keyboard habits. So, the browser quits and I lose all what I've written.\nIs there a way to constrain this key combination on MacOS or do I have to look for it on Firefox? (I know, the best way is adapting MacOS but mostly I am working on WinOS.)\n\nA: Unfortunately, Firefox (at least the 3.6 version I experimented with) does not disable the command shortcut for Quit when you change it in System Preferences.\nI think the quick and easy fix for this is to add ⌘Q as a global shortcut to something else innocuous. In my experiments, I found this to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.\n\n*Click on the Keyboard pane.\n\n*Click Keyboard Shortcuts tab.\n\n*Click Exposé & Spaces shortcuts in the left side list.\n\n*Under \"Exposé\" change the shortcut for \"Desktop\" to ⌘Q\n\n\nNow when you accidentally hit ⌘Q, your desktop will magically and amusingly appear reminding you of your folly. Hit ⌘Q again and you're back exactly where you were.\nAs a sidenote, after a while you may want to change this back after you \"unlearn\" your behaviour. ⌘Q, the Mac equivalent to \"ALT-F4\" has been the standard shortcut since the introduction of the Macintosh, and like the other \"standard\" shortcuts ⌘W,⌘Z,⌘C,⌘V and so on, it's best to learn them to ease use of other Mac computers or when you upgrade.\n\nA: Here's how to change that particular shortcut for Firefox:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.

It's stuck on the 'connect to iTunes' screen. \niTunes does recognize the iPhone, but when I select 'restore', it goes through a few progress bars, then errors again. I've already tried to hard reset the phone, but that doesn't work either.\n\nA: Please note that the instructions I am giving are assuming you are using an English copy of Windows, since I do not have a Mac and therefore do not have much experience with them.  However, the steps will be very similar, and I will try to note where things might be different for Mac OS X.\nFirst, check all of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your copy of iTunes is up-to-date. In Windows, open iTunes, click \"Help\", then \"Check for Updates\".\n\n*Make sure you are connected to the internet and the connection is reliable.  iTunes contacts Apple several times during the restore procedure, and if iTunes fails to get a response during one of these check-ins, the restore will fail.\n\n*Make sure you are using the correct version of iTunes for your system.  If you are using a 64-bit version of Windows, you will need to install the 64-bit version of iTunes.  If you have Windows XP, you need the normal 32-bit version. If you have Vista or Windows 7, click the start orb, right-click computer, then click \"Properties\". In the \"System\" section, look for the line that starts with \"System Type\". If it says 32-bit, use the normal iTunes installer. If it says \"64-bit Operating System\", download the 64-bit version of iTunes from http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1047  (If you have trouble determining whether you have a 32-bit or 64-bit copy of Windows installed, try installing iTunes using http://www.ninite.com and it will automatically download the right version)\n\n*Delete the restore files from your computer. In Windows, press WindowsKey+R, type '%appdata%\\apple computer\\itunes' then delete the folders iPod Software Update and iPhone Software update if they exist.  If you are using OS X, the folder should be ~/Library/iTunes/.\n\n*If it still isn't working, uninstall iTunes, reboot, then install iTunes again, then reboot again.\n\n\nIf none of the above work, do the following to place your iPhone into DFU mode.  Some people have better luck with restoring with this method.\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug the iPhone into the computer, and wait for it to be recognized in iTunes.\n\n*Press and hold the home and sleep buttons.\n\n*As soon as the iPhone screen goes blank, count to six seconds. At six, release the sleep button, and continue holding the home button.\n\n*You should see or hear the new hardware notification on your computer. When you do, you can release the home button.  If the new hardware notification, wait until iTunes recognizes it and tells you it found an iPhone in restore mode.\n\n*The iPhone screen should be blank. If it shows the \"Connect to iTunes\" screen, unplug it, then try again from step 1.\n\n\nA: If you see Connect to iTunes screen when you start iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch \nIn some situations, you might see the Connect to iTunes screen when you start your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. When this happens, your device is in recovery mode. Here's what to do.\nRestart your device by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons at the same time until you see the Apple logo.\nIf you see the Connect to iTunes screen again, you'll need to reinstall iOS. Follow these steps:\n1. Connect your device to your computer.\n2. You should see this message: \"The software on [your device name] needs to be restored to factory settings or updated.\"\n3. Click Update to reinstall iOS while keeping your data.\nGet help if, after following the steps above, you see a restore error.\nIf you don't see a restore error, but you still see the Connect to iTunes screen when you start your device, contact Apple.\nSource - https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT203122\n", "Q: iPhone4: Keep playing songs after song selected from Search iPhone screen ends? When I first got my iPhone 4, if I selected a song from the \"search iPhone\" screen (when you hit home twice), iTunes would start playing a playlist of all my songs, starting with the selected one.\nI recently updated it to 4.2.1 (I don't remember exactly what I was at before). Now, when I select a song from the \"Search iPhone\" screen, iTunes starts playing a playlist containing only that song.\nIs there a way I can get the old behavior back?\n\nA: I believe it has to do with the way you last accessed your iPod. If you open your iPod and  select songs and then select a song to play, the next time you search for a song, it will continue to play through all of your songs. If the last time you accessed the iPod by going to a particular album or playlist, it will only play the songs located in the same album or playlist as the song you searched for. \nIts a little confusing but I could try to explain it better if you need me to. \n", "Q: Can I browse the Mac App Store without Snow Leopard? I understand that Snow Leopard is required to install the Mac App Store and actually install apps.

How can I make the Safari tab bar display all of the tabs?\nRight now it displays only n tabs and the remaining are only accessible through a >> button.\nHow can I display all tabs at once without needing to scroll horizontally? Can tabs be set to shrink to a much smaller size, to display more at once?\n\nA: Actually there is a plugin (not to be confused with an extension) called Glims which allows the tabs to have a minimum width roughly the size of the close button. It's free - Glims\nThe screen resolution you are set to will ultimately determine your results, but for me I can normally only fit 13 tabs in a full screen Safari window. With Glims installed and this option turned on, it fits around 50 tabs. After that it resumes the usual behavior of giving you the >> for more tabs.\nThe drawback is obviously you loose your tab titles, making it difficult to discern one tab from another and this is why Apple chose to impose this arbitrary limitation. However there is another feature in Glims to display the website's favicon in the place where the close tab button usually is. This helps alleviate the aforementioned dilemma to an extent.\nFYI - Glims does much more than that as well.\n\nA: You can also try those following keys: Cmd + Shift + T but also chose go to view\" Show Tab Bar.\nIf you are looking for a fresh app I recommand you to try the sweet Tabexposé which works for Leopard as well as Snow Leopard\n\nA: It sounds as if you already know you can click on the » to see the additional tabs.\nOutside of that, your only other option is to make the browser window wider.\n\nA: In Safari 14 for macOS 11 Big Sur, tabs now shrink down to the size of their Favicon. This allows for many more tabs to be seen at once without horizontal scrolling.\n\n", "Q: Time Machine multiple Disks Backup over Network I have a Mac OS X Server 10.6 with a hard disk attached to it which has been configured as Time Machine destination. Over the Workgroup manager I have assigned the TM destination on Computergrouplevel. Now I would like to swap Backupdisks so I can always store one disk offsite. \nIs it possible to change disks and let the clients update their TM destination automatically when the Disks have been changed?\nI also appreciate if you have other usefull methods to overcome this obstacle. An example would be dynamic links where you could specify the path with a wildcard a for example:\nIf my two disks are named Backup_Disk_A and Backup_Disk_B then I would create this alias\nln -s /Volumes/Backup_Disk_%\n\nThe problem here is that when I change the disk then the link can't find the destination.\n\nA: So I managed to get a solution. \nYou have to name your external disks which you want to swap with the exact same name (to be able to differentiate them just write different names on the cases). Then you insert one disk and share it as a time machine destination. Now go to the clients and select your shared time machine destination disk. When Time Machine has done its backup you can swap the external HD with the second one. \nTime machine on the clients will not notice that the destination drive has been swapped, neither will the server (it seems that the shared time machine destination points to the HD name and not as expected to the HD GUID).\nCAUTION This workaround works best with mac os x 10.6, Mac OS X 10.5 will notice a swapped harddrive and show an error which references to a missing cookie or something in this kind. When confronted whith this error just proceed and make new backup on the swapped drive.\n", "Q: How do I disable this message: \"the disk was not ejected properly\"? Is there any way to disable the \"the disk was not ejected properly\" message?\nI use a KVM and need to switch between two systems and have a memory stick that is in the KVM. The problem is that it's very annoying to get the message every time I switch from one computer to the other. I know, I can unmount it (and probably should), but I switch all the time, so it's a inconvenience to unmount, and there is nothing sensitive on the memory stick.\n\nA: Certainly not an elegant answer but, you can disable UserNotificationCenter.app found in /system/library/coreservices - replace it with another app or file with the same name. It will stop any warnings popping up (including that your drive is full) so watch out for that, but in my experience it does what you are looking for.\nI actually did this to my mac a long time ago, and forgot about it until you asked you question.

Then place the PLIST in ~/Library/LaunchAgents and run launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/file.plist (replacing file.plist with the name of the file) in Terminal.\nWhat's really cool about launchd is that if a job does not run because the computer is asleep (e.g., when your laptop is closed), launchd will run the job as soon as the computer wakes up again (and if the job was supposed to run multiple times while the computer was asleep, the multiple runs will be coalesced into one run upon wakeup).

QuantumG is a genius! Here is a hack (and I mean a real life hack) for disabling just this annoying message and leaving the rest of the notification system intact...\nhttp://quantumg.blogspot.com/2015/04/disabling-os-x-device-removal-warnings.html\nWarning: This is a pro-tip and not for the faint of heart! It requires hacking your Mac OSX system files and could result in you breaking your Mac.\nEdited for clarity. \nThe issue with flash drives or other USB drives is this; whenever you write data to a drive... ANY drive on your system, the data is first written to a buffer in memory. Later, when the computer gets around to it, it will flush the buffers to the device (hard drive, SSD, or any USB device). That may be instantaneous (at least to us mere mortals) or it may take a few seconds. The possible delay means that if you yank a USB device before the buffers have flushed you may end up with a corrupted drive, or a set of corrupted files on the drive.\nIf you only read from a device, then there is NO NEED to flush the write buffers before you yank to your heart's content because they are empty and don't need to be flushed to the device. \nSo... The annoying MAC OS X warning is most probably NOT relevant. It is only important to do so if you have recently written to the device, and haven't given it enough time to flush the buffers (a few seconds, max). It is NEVER necessary to wait for the buffers to flush if you are only reading from the USB device.\nTherefore Apple NEEDS to provide a way to disable individual messages for power users. Don't treat everyone as a n00b who can't be relied on to know how their computer works.\nAnd to those who complain that I'm wrong, and there is a way to disable the messages by disabling the ENTIRE NOTIFICATION SUBSYSTEM are just plain wrong. Disabling the entire notification subsystem isn't an acceptable solution, just as removing the battery from your cell phone is NOT an acceptable solution to receiving too many telemarketing calls. The notification subsystem is important and shouldn't be disabled just because the OP finds one of the many myriad of messages to be annoying.\nThis is a problem that can only be adequately solved by Apple providing a way for users to opt out of specific messages.\n\nA: your answer is here.

The procfs documentation tells you that MemTotal as reported by meminfo corresponds to \"Total usable ram (i.e. physical ram minus a few reserved bits and the kernel binary code)\". So you have about 400 MB used for the firmware and the kernel image. Firmware could include BootCamp and the graphical memory.

To be honest though, it's kind of like trying to chop down a tree with a plastic spoon. It feels quite clumsy, it's fairly slow and it's not something you'd want to be a regular part of your work flow. \n\nYou're unable to select text, which means no copy or pasting. If you double-tap at the end of a sentence to get a period, you won't be rewarded with that particular mobile shortcut. There is no shift key; if you capitalize a word, all the text will be capitalized until you toggle the button off. Backspacing is equally slow, especially if you need to edit a large area of text.  Tuaw\n\nThere are Apps like GoDocs that claim to make the experience better, but I haven't tried them myself.\nIf you don't have an iPad (and I'm presuming you haven't because you're asking this question!) you can get your Mac or PC to pretend to be an iPad in Safari and try it out yourself. Fire up Safari's preferences and tick the show develop menu under the Advanced Tab:\n\nThen use the Develop Menu in your Menu Bar to set your User Agent to Mobile Safari 3.2.2 - iPad. Your browser will act just like it was an iPad, which lets you experience with Google Docs or any other sites you're curious about. \n\n\nA: Current situation is much better than the one sketched in the answer of Tuaw although some essentials are still missing.\nBasic editing works, including font types, headers, bullets, numbering. So you can definitely write a nice piece of text. Compared to the desktop browser experience however, many features are missing. Tabs can only be inserted with an external keyboard, tables cannot be created at all (viewing and editing the contents of an existing table is possible), multiple columns is impossible, etc. It is impossible to use the desktop version of Google Docs in a browser on an iPad.\nSo the Google Docs iPad app is useable but you will probably have to make certain changes on a laptop or desktop machine if your document is more than a simple note.\n", "Q: Increasing video memory on an older macbook I have a 2,1 macbook with 4GB ram of which 64mb are dedicated to the video card. Can I increase this to at least 512?\n\nA: Generally, VRAM is soldered on/in somewhere.  I suppose you could, if you had the know how, but the short answer is, no.\nEdit:  That is, VRAM is not (usually) taken from the pool of \"available RAM,\" it's actually separate RAM entirely.  And dedicated to the GPU, only.\n", "Q: Where's my free space gone on my MP3 player? I have a Sansa Fuze MP3 player, it's 4 GB.\nI plug it in my Mac I have a capacity of 3,7 GB of which apparently 1,8 GB is in use.\nProblem is I only have arround 120 MB of MP3s on it...\nWho's stealing my free space ?\nHere are DiskInventoryX screenshots. I have the same results with du and the terminal.\n\n\n\nA: It might also be the trash -- I'm not sure how DiskInventoryX copes with trash directories on external drives. It might be worth emptying your trash while the drive is mounted.\n\nA: The missing space is probably the operating system and other hidden system files. \n\nA: Ok problem solved.\nI repaired the disk using Disk Utility.app. Some blocks were not marked as free apparently!\n", "Q: International Power Converter I am going out of th country in a few weeks, and I am planning on taking my Macbook. I have a power adapter for the country I'm visiting, but it was bought for a PC. Will it work on a Mac? \n\nA: You don't need a power converter, as Apple power supplies will all take 100-240V at 50 or 60 Hz, so a simple mechanical adaptor will do. Having said that, anything that will work with a PC power supply should also work with a Mac.\n", "Q: How to shut down Apple TV (2G) remotly? Is there any way to shut down Apple TV (new, 2G, second generation) by remote controler?\nI can do it by holding middle button on remote controller but only if the TV set is on. If I just listen to the internet radio without TV set on, I cannot do this.\n\nA: If you notice, the \"Sleep Now\" menu entry for the AppleTV is in the lower right-hand corner of the menu system.\nHere's how I do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the \"menu\" button several times, until you hear the different audio sound to indicate that you're at the home screen.\n\n*Press the \"right\" button several times, until you'd think that the cursor is over on the farthest right option.\n\n*Press the \"down\" button several times, until you'd think that the cursor is at the \"Sleep Now\" option.\n\n*Press the \"middle\" button.\n\n\nI do this a lot when I am streaming music to the device; takes me about three seconds and it works.\n\nA: You cannot shutdown the Apple TV 2G as the powersupply does not support it.\nBut you can hold Play / Pause for 6 seconds on the remote, then it will go into standby. From this state it is safe to remove power from the unit.\nIf you have SSH you can issue the command sudo shutdown -h now to activate standby.\n", "Q: Syncing iCal with Google calendar under 10.4?

The solution is a little bit tricky/efforty:\n\nThis should be possible by manually mounting the drive via the terminal. You'll have to eject the drive when you plug it in and then remount it in the terminal using the noasync option.\nThe best way to go about this would be to run mount in the terminal and take down the device so you know what to remount. Then umount /dev/disk1s1 (where disk1s1 is the device name) then mount -o noasync /dev/disk1s1. This method would also apply to most linux distros.\nAs you can see, it's easier to just remember to eject.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to have GPL software in the Mac App Store? Can you have GPL software in Mac App Store?\nI know this is not possible in the iPhone App Store, but is it the same situation in Mac App Store?\nNOTE: None of the answers below should be considered legal advice. If you require a legal answer to this question, consult a lawyer.\n\nA: I think the primary sticking point with the iOS App Store was the fact that even if you had the source code it wasn't possible to modify and redistribute an application to iOS devices without agreeing to Apple's iOS App Store terms, as that is the only way to get apps on the device.\nThe same is not true, however, with the Mac App Store - you could easily provide the source that people can use to modify and distribute the application outside of the Mac App Store, so I think there is no problem with GPL'd apps in the Mac App Store.\n\nA: We have a GPL project which we'd like to distribute on the MAS. In my (non-lawyer) opinion it's probably OK to distribute on the MAS, but we may not take the risk with our project. It's a decade old project with none of the early developers involved anymore, so we need to be careful about perfectly following the GPL.\n\nI think the primary sticking point with the iOS App Store was the fact that even if you had the source code it wasn't possible to modify and redistribute an application to iOS devices without agreeing to Apple's iOS App Store terms, as that is the only way to get apps on the device.\n\nIf you have Xcode, or if your device is jail broken, then you do not have to agree to the iOS App Store terms to distribute and install open source software. How does this not satisfy the GPL?\nI realise you have to agree to a license to install Xcode, and many users are unwilling to jail break their device (I wont do it). But GPL doesn't require your software to be installable by everyone who downloads it. How is that any different from, say, distributing software that only runs on windows, which cannot be used by linux users unless they purchase a windows pc and agree to the included EULA?\n\nThe same is not true, however, with the Mac App Store - you could easily provide the source that people can use to modify and distribute the application outside of the Mac App Store, so I think there is no problem with GPL'd apps in the Mac App Store.\n\nWhat exactly would the requirements be? Do you have to distribute both binary and source code outside the app store, or is just source code enough? Seems like you should be able to have a binary-only distribution on the app store, and a code-only distribution on your website (eg: google code).\nAvoiding a second binary distribution would be nice, our team doesn't do binary releases as often as we should — simply because of all the work involved.\nThis mess is one more reason to change to MIT or BSD, a process we had already begun for other reasons, and are soon to complete. We should be fixing bugs, not discussing the legal restrictions dictating precisely how we give our work to the whole world.\n\nA: If you mean taking software that you do not hold copyright to, and which you are only allowed to use and copy because it was licensed under the GNU GPL, then no.\nThe FSF spells it out here: section 6 of the GPL says \"You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein\", and the Mac App Store Terms of Service explicitly add other restrictions.\nThe Software Freedom Law Center's legal representative confirmed this: the App Store agreements, on all platforms, are incompatible with the GNU GPL.\nApple seems to be disallowing GPL programs in the App Store as a matter of policy, but if you managed to sneak one through, then the author of the program could go after you for violating their copyright.\nA completely different case is where you hold the copyright to a piece of software.  In that case, you are welcome to distribute it under more than one license.  (For example, Firefox was for a while licensed under the MPL, GPL, and LGPL.  MySQL is licensed under the GPL and also a proprietary license.)  So if you sell a program through the Mac App Store, you can also release it under the GPL -- assuming you are allowed to do each of these things independently.\n(If you wanted to use somebody else's GNU GPL-licensed code in one of the App Stores, you could write to the copyright holder and see if they're willing to sell you an alternative license to their software.  They're under absolutely no obligation to do this, of course.)\nVLC ran into trouble (I think) because copyright for the software was held by many different people, and the whole program was only allowed to be distributed under the GPL.  Some programs sidestep such issues by requiring contributors to assign copyright to them, but most don't.\n\nA: I am going to disagree with the sentiment that GPL code cannot be included in either App Store. (as well as stir the pot a bit with no offense to anyone who has answered this so far in good faith!)\nOf course anyone CAN take code that is GPL and send it to the app store. Apple has no way to know what code you used unless you somehow embed the license file in the binary. You or someone else has to call their attention to that fact.\nApple's license linked from the Mac App store currently runs 16.7k words in length and allows for a third party license to be different and bind you in addition to their licenses.\n\nThe GPLv3 currently runs 5.2k words - many of which are openly intended to combat DRM and adding restrictions not expressly already a part of GPL (say like an N-device limitation)\nIt's clear that both the license that Apple attaches to Mac App store and iTunes App store isn't any version of GPL. It's also clear both are intended to be binding legal documents.\nSo a simple \"can you have...\" question boils down to several implied questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do Apple's terms and conditions for App Store distribution preclude you from using code obtained under a GPL license?\n\n*Does GPL prevent you from distribution channels that use DRM or don't include verbatim (and solely) GPL licensing in the terms of sale / use.\n\n*Is it probable that:\n\n\n*\n\n*That they are in some (or any) way compatible?\n\n*That it will get caught?\n\n*That there will be repercussions for going down that path?\n\n\n\nAll the non-lawyers here (me included) are barking at the moon, dancing around questions of the legality of very specific licenses governing intellectual property and copyright. The barking is intelligent and well-meant, but barking nonetheless.\nPretending that GPL is a free ride and comes with no restrictions is naive - it is intended as a legal document with real teeth. I don't intend to insult anyone - just point out how inadequate even a good faith attempt at trying to answer this question will be.\n\nA: You clearly and evidently can have GPL software in the iOS App Store — WordPress being one of the more prominent examples (1). It also wasn't Apple who objected to VLC in the iOS App Store; it was one of VLC's developers (and there was a heavy debate on the mailing list about whether his interpretation was correct).\nFor the Mac App Store, I'll lean even closer to it not being an issue. Unlike on iOS, anyone can inspect, modify, compile and run your GPL'd code for free on a Mac; there is no need to pay $99/yr, or to agree to Apple's ADC policies.\n", "Q: is there any way to have Facebook or Twitter update in the background on my iPod touch? I have an iPod touch.  I want to know if there is any way to have my Facebook or Twitter feeds update in the background?\nI often grab my iPod from my home (with WiFi) and then go into the train (no WiFi) and want to see what was posted recently or when I was sleeping.\nIt seems like these apps only do a \"fetch\" once you start the app up.\nIs there any work around for this so it's always updating if i am on a WiFi network?\n\nA: You can either leave one of the apps open at night so it will refresh or get something like Boxcar, which would be a solution more fitting to your needs. Boxcar will push notifications from facebook and Twitter, and then you can launch Boxcar to see the updates. \n", "Q: Reviving a dead iPod Touch 8GB (2nd gen?) I have an iPod Touch 8GB (probably 2nd gen) that stopped working. By this I mean that it cannot be turned on, an doesn't show any sign of activity when connected to the PC, a docking station and other chargers. Of course iTunes does not recognize the device when plugged in to the PC. This happened, without prior signs of a coming malfunction, about 2 months after I bought it, used, during the last summer.\nWhat are my options in trying to bring it back to life? At the moment, buying a new iPod Touch is not an option.\n\nA: Try leaving it connected to a PC or Mac for several hours. If the Battery is completely empty, it will take some time to turn on. Happens to my 8GB iPod (which is not used much anymore) every time I leave it disconnected for 2 weeks or more.\nTHe only other option I can think of is trying to use a tool called RecBoot to boot the iPod into recovery mode. I don't know if that works (never needed it) and where to download it, but it's the only other option that would come to my mind.\n\nA: If you're sure its charged (try at least 3 combinations of computer->cables, or cable->chargers in case a charger or cable is broken) you should take it to your local Apple store. They will diagnose the problem and fix it if it's in warranty for free. Although you bought it last summer you say it is a Second gen, which means it's probably not in warranty. They will tell you all your options.\n", "Q: Syncing Contacts and iCal between multiple Macs and iOS? I have a two Macs, an iPod Touch and an iPad, so 4 devices in total.\nI wonder if there is a way to sync contacts and ical calendars between these devices automatically (or in case of the iPod/iPad when they are connected to a mac).\nSo far, I'm seeing these options:\n\n\n*\n\n*MobileMe - seems really expensive for what it offers and stores data in the cloud\n\n*Mac OS X Server - requires a dedicated machine and is also not cheap\n\n*Syncing with Google Contacts and Calendars - requires the data to go to the cloud, but is free\n\n\nIs there anything that simply allows me to sync from Mac to Mac to iOS through my local network?\n\nA: I've been extremely happy with iCloud syncing between MacBook Pro, iPhone, and iPad. Once set up it works flawlessly and reliably unlike MobileMe which I had for years and was useful but never totally trustworthy. iCloud really is a great solution for syncing address book and calendar and reminders. I'm also enjoying it's syncing of bookmarks and other safari browser data.\nMy only caveat about it is that some MobileMe users have had some issues in doing the move. None of these issues to my knowledge have been unsolveable but there have been some bumps. For users with an Apple ID and no legacy of MobileMe use it's extremely smooth to set up.\nAll iOS devices need to be running iOS 5, Macs need latest version of Lion.\nhttp://www.apple.com/icloud/setup/\n\nA: I'm using Google Calendars and Contcts for this, it works really well. My iPhone has been set up with Google sync, so the calendar/contact updates get pushed automatically (when there's a network connection).\n\nA: The iOS devices will sync with a Mac when they're connected to it and you sync via iTunes, so we don't need to worry about those.\nMarkSpace's SyncTogether product will allow you to sync your calendars and address book (and some other stuff) between the Macs. BusySync (or its big brother BusyCal) will do the calendars but not the address book. Fruux does calendars and address books, but its in beta and I know nothing about its reliability. But none of those is free -- I don't know of any free options other than syncing via Google.\n\nA: For calendars you might want to look into BusyCal (if you really don't want your data in the cloud).\nOtherwise go with iCloud (the MobileMe replacement). It's free and syncs a lot more than just contacts and calendars.\n\nA: This is the Calender Server from OS X Server that works on normal OS X fine. It's fairly simple, the instructions are included.\nhttp://www.macosforge.org/post/calendar-and-contacts-server/\n\nA: For information about the full article \"Mac OS X and iOS Syncing with Google\"\nhttp://devicegadget.com/apple/mac-os-ios-syncing-google/1214/\n", "Q: afp over wireless lan extremely slow I’m connecting from one MacBook Pro (10.6.5) (let’s call it “1”) to another (10.4.11) “2” via WLAN and afp and both are connected to the WLAN via WPA2.\nThe router is showing me theoretical connection speeds of 104 MBit/s for “1” and 54 MBit/s for “2”. However, when I’m trying to transfer files (doesn’t matter whether I use drag & drop in Finder or cp in the terminal), it takes eternities: 70 seconds for a 2.1 MB file (~ 250 KBit/s if I didn’t make a mistake). The network activity monitor looks like this during the transfer:\n (There’s no other significant network activity going on.)\nClearly, this is off by several orders of magnitude. Does somebody have a clue what could cause this?\nOther network traffic works normal on both MacBooks. As far as I know, I have made no special configurations.\n\nA: Radio interference? How many other wifi spots are nearby? How many are using the same channel as you? Does this only happen with AFP or does it happen with other protocols as well (e.g., HTTP, CIFS, etc)? Are you using A/B/G/N?\nWhat's the memory usage look like on both systems? Is one (or both) maxed out? The traffic seems very bursty. This could indicate that one or both sides can't buffer the stream properly (i.e., not enough free memory).\nDo you have the same problems when configured to use an Ad Hoc network? If not then the problem is your WAP.\n\nA: You should try the transfer in FTP only because FTP sets it's own \"MTU\". If this sends files very quickly, you are looking at a TCP fragmentation issue, i.e., you are sending TCP packets too large for the router to handle on it's own.  I imagine you can tweak the Mac network settings to force fragmentation to 1500 or less per packet.\n", "Q: Controlling a Mac remotely Is it possible to control the Mac remotely?\nMy parents live in different country other than where I'm living now, I think about giving one of my Mac to my parents to use iChat. As my parents are not good at using computers, I need to control the Mac remotely. \nIs there any software tool for it?\n\nA: There are a lot!\nLogMeIn is one of them, which has the benefit to have a web interface and doesn't need your parents computer to have a fixed IP. You install the client on their computer, register it and then you'll be able to control it via your interface.\nGive it a look, it's quite good. The free version doesn't have all advanced features (obviously) but it's quite enough for remote help of parents' computers (I use it for this same purpose and I also do it for computers in Canada while I'm in Europe!)\n\nA: A number of good solutions have been posted.\nFor completeness sake, I want to mention something that easily lets you see, if not control, the remote computer.  Skype lets you \"share the desktop\", which sends an image of the user's computer over as if it were a video chat.\nIt's not as good as actual control, I will agree, but it's cross-platform and can help out a lot in a pinch.\n\nA: The Mac comes with the server part of the software built-in for \"Apple Remote Desktop\"; They can be viewed and managed remotely if you have the client software. For most of us that's too expensive a solution, so an alternate is to use VNC. Check out JollysFastVNC and Chicken of the VNC.\nAlso, iChat, which comes with the Macs, can do screen sharing, which might be all you need. Check out \"Share and share alike.\" from Apple's iChat site and \"Sharing your screen with a buddy\".\n\nA: I have used logmein, teamviewer, ichat and teamviewer emerged winner due to its simplicity and availability of a free iPhone app as a bonus! Try them all, simple and easy.\n\nA: Here's a step by step (the free, reliable route):\n\n\n*\n\n*Download \"Vine server\" and install it on your mac. \n\n*Go to dyndns.org (dynamic DNS), register, and create a free domain name pointer for yourself.  This will create a hostname that points to your house's ip address all the time (ie bill.dyndns.org --> 123.123.123.123).\n\n*Once you get a dyndns domain name, login to your router and put your login information in for the domain name you just got from dyndns.  Look around, there should be a page for DDNS.  If there's not, then grab the dyndns software.\n\n*While in your router, open up a port for vnc.  The default for VNC is 5900.\n\n*Restart VNC server.\n\n*Now, from outside of the mac's house, grab a vnc client...  there are many.  A good one for PC is vncviewer, tightvnc, others.  Just google PC or MAC free VNC client.\n\n*Open the client vnc, put in your dyndns hostname as the IP, and the port is 5900.\n\n\nA: (I'm going to mention this for completeness rather than because I think you'd actually use it). \nThere's a product called Timbuktu which is a bit more hard-core than LogMeIn, VNC and Remote Desktop, but really it does something very similar. \nIt's a paid-for program (and not really that cheap, to be fair) but it does work BRILLIANTLY, it's fast, you can get compatible Windows versions (so Mac-Mac, Mac-Windows, Windows-Windows etc) and it makes a decent job of useful things like file transfers, clipboard syncing and handling different screen resolutions etc.\nI've used Timbuktu to remotely control my office Mac from my laptop for a couple of years now and I'm a very happy customer.\n", "Q: Adding an entry to the hosts file on iPod touch 4G? Is it possible to add an entry to your /etc/hosts type file (or whatever the equivalent is) on an iPod Touch 4G without jail breaking it?\n\nA: No, there's no access to system-level files without jailbreaking.\n", "Q: I want to play one podcast only on iPod Touch, but they play in series one after the other I download multiple podcasts from one source, eg, five episodes of Naked Scientists.  I want to listen to one only, but when the first finishes it automatically goes to the second, and third etc.\nI want to listen to just one episode at a time and have the iPod Touch turn off when it is finished (this is a sleep-aid for my insomnia...I don't want it playing all night !)\nA \"Genius\" suggested making playlists, but although you can make a podcast playlist, it does NOT sync.\n\nA: With iOS 4, you can make a playlist directly on your device. Go to the Music app, then Playlists, then \"Add Playlist...\". Type in the name for the playlist, hit Save, and you're presented with a screen to add items to the playlist. Select \"Podcasts\" (by default, it's found under \"More\") and select the item you want to play. Tap \"Done\".\nYou're all set - just select the item from the playlist and only that item will play.\n\nA: Use the On-The-Go playlist and add the one podcast episode to it. Works from at least iOS 3 or possibly before.\nYou don't event need to clear the existing playlist, because adding a track will add to the end, so just start from that track and it will stop at the end (unless you have repeat on).\n\nA: You should be able to do this with a smart playlist. Set it up with the following rule:\n- Name is {the podcast's name}\n- Plays is 0  \nLimit it to 1 item, selected by least recently added.\nCheck the \"live updating\" box. \nThis should give you a playlist with one track - the oldest unheard episode of the podcast. \nI've used a variation on this and it is able to sync to my iPhone (once I selected it to be included in the sync). \n", "Q: Remember desktop state after reboot Does anyone know if desktop switching can be done programatically? Exposé activation and deactivation? I know of the screencapture command for the last part of my proposed solution.\n\nI would like to be able to restore my desktop work environment after a reboot. I have one idea how to do this.\nReason: I reboot every 2 - 4 weeks. I have 9 virtual desktops, each with a few to a dozen windows and applications. After a computer reboot it feels like a brain reboot and takes a few days to get everything back.\nConcept: Manually prior to a planned reboot, or perhaps once a day via cron in case of accidental reboot or system freeze, I'd like to somehow capture the system state in order make recovery post-reboot easier.\nIdeal Solution: I prefer the CLI. My ideal solution would be a text file of open files on each desktop, and terminal windows on each desktop, and what folder those terminal windows are in. I could then write a script that would go to desktop 1, open all the PDFs there in Preview, open all the .m files in AquaMacs, and open the terminals and cd them to the correct folder, etc. Repeat for each desktop.\nI think AppleScript could easily tell me what PDFs are open in Preview.app, but I don't think it can tell me what desktop they are on. Same with Terminal.app\nProposed Solution: Screenshots of each Desktop while in Exposé mode.\nIs there a way to script switching from Desktop #1 through Desktop #9, where at each Desktop, it activates Exposé and takes a screenshot?\nNow, after a reboot, I can at least go to a folder, open the 9 screenshots, and manually see what application and what files were open where.\n\nA: do you ever try Relaunch application:\nRelaunch saves you time by taking Snapshots of which applications you are using, and starts them back up for you. Think of it as a launcher on steroids that lets you switch between work contexts with one click. \nyou can take a snapshot before restart your system and after that double click on the snapshot you created then it restored all your files and application you worked on.\n", "Q: How can I stop OS X from switching Spaces when the mouse cursor is at the edge of the screen? Mac OS X Spaces change when I hold the mouse at the edge of the screen. Is there an application or 'defaults' command to disable this?\nWarp looks like it might help, but hasn't changed the behavior for me, even though I tried turning it off, or setting a modifier key.\n\nA: I found a solution. The following sets the delay to 1 minute.\ndefaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-edge-delay -float 60 && killall Dock\nsource: Leopard: Lower the window drag delay between spaces\n\nA: OS X - Snow Leopard seems to have two states when it comes to the switching behavior. Dragging a window or not dragging a window. If you are not dragging a window, it ignores your mouse hovering at a side. This makes sense, or the dock and hot corners would be very hard to use. When you are dragging a window, it auto-switches workspaces if you hang around at a side. This also makes sense.\nSometimes though, it seems to get confused about if you're dragging a window or not. When this happens, even if you aren't dragging a window, it still flips workspaces if you hover the mouse on a side, thereby making the dock and hot corners very hard to use.\nIn order to reset this state, I figured out that you can pick up a window, drag it around a bit, then let go. This seems to reset its \"you're currently dragging a window\" state with respect to workspace switching.\n\nA: It only switches when you're actively dragging something and linger on the edge of the screen for several seconds. Simply hovering shouldn't change anything. \n\nA: I am using Warp successfully to do that.  I've checked \"Enable Warp\" and \"Click screen edge to Warp\".  When I touch an edge, I get a small window surrounding the cursor that either shows a tiny view of the adjacent space and its windows, or says \"No windows\" -- is that what you're seeing?  At that point, clicking will change spaces, or you can back away from the edge to remain in the same space.\nEdit:  Oops - I have to backtrack. My answer applies to just the mouse cursor, not to dragging a window.  I see the same behavior you describe if I drag a window to the edge and hover there holding it: Spaces will switch repeatedly until I back the cursor off of the edge.\n", "Q: Some applications on MacBook Pro think Internet is not connected when it is I have had my MacBook Pro for about 6 months; bought it new in 2010.

Had no problems until this last week, when at an apparently random moment, some applications (e.g. Safari, iTunes, Adium and Tweetie) decide the Internet is no longer connected. The message from Safari is the standard \"You are not connected to the Internet.\"\nPinging different hosts on the Internet works completely fine, and I can browse without any issue on Firefox.\nNetwork Diagnostics reports that the Internet is connected. Turning Airport on and off, and closing and rebootting the applications doesn't seem to help.\nI did manage to fix the problem with a reboot but would rather find the underlying issue and a better solution. Can anyone out there help?\n\nA: Just stabbing in the dark here - DNS? Or rather, the relation of Safari towards DNS (since you mentioned that Firefox was working fine). \nI know that Safari takes on the system wide proxy settings and firefox has its own - another possible avenue why firefox works when safari doesn't.\nMaybe you could try opening two new tabs when the issue occurs again and try accessing http://72.30.2.43 and www.yahoo.com on the second tab. Perhaps we could help eliminate DNS with that test.\nMuck around the system proxy settings is another possible investigation route.\n\nA: I've had this issue on my Macbook as well and found that if you go into terminal and clear the cache it loads the pages again.\nType dscacheutil -flushcache\n", "Q: OS X 10.6 : Automating new system provisioning with scripts I've been working on this for days but simply cannot find the correct references to make it work.\nThe idea is to have a script that will baseline newly purchased Macs that comes into the company with basic stuffs like set autologin to off, create a new admin user (for remote admins to access for support, set password to unlock screensaver and etc) .\nSample list for baseline that admins have to do on each new machine:\n\nClick the Login Options button\nSet Automatic Login: OFF\nCheck: Show the Restart, Sleep, and Shutdown buttons\nUncheck: Show input menu in login window\nUncheck: Show password hints\nUncheck: Use voice over in the login window\nCheck: Show fast user switching menu as Short Name\n\n(note: this is only part of a long list to do on each machine)\nI've managed to find some references to make some parts work. Like autologin can be unset with \"defaults write /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences com.apple.userspref.DisableAutoLogin -bool TRUE\" and I've kinda found ways to muscle in a new user creation (including prompts) with applescript and shell commands.\nBut generally its tough finding ways to do somewhat simple things like turn on password to get out of screensaver or to allow fast user switching. References are either too limited or just no where to be seen (e.g. i can unset autologin via cli but the very next setting on the system preference \"show restart, sleep and shutdown buttons\" is somewhere else and i can't find any command line to make it set)\nDoes anyone have any ideas on a list, document, reference or anything of where each setting on the system resides so that I can be pointed to make it work? or maybe sample scripts for the above example...\nMy thanks for reading thus far - a huge thank you for whoever that has any info on the above.\n\nA: There is a better way to do this. The IT department at my company maintains a disk image with all of the settings in place they need to administer the Macs when they are received-including software in place registered with site licenses. They open the Macs and simply replace what's on the hard drive with the disk image.\nScripting is a logical path, but scripting System Preferences is a real bear because you have to go with GUI Scripting which is rife with problems, the least of which trying to decipher UIElementInspector to get what you need.\n\nA: You're talking about things that would probably be easier to do with a mix UI scripting, and scripting System Preferences.UI scripting is where you write an AppleScript that opens System Preferences and clicks buttons. Scripting System Preferences directly is where you talk to the app. Support for this is... patchy. You can use one where the other fails.\nHere is some info about scripting System Preferences. Some info on UI scripting SysPrefs is here, and better examples can be downloaded here (direct link). They are installed to your ~/Library/Scripts/System Preferences folder.\nHope this helps.

Those MCX settings then can be exported and it´s easier to cope with system updates (you don´t have to re-create a new \"master\"-image)\nFor more information I´d suggest reading through www.afp548.com and www.macenterprise.org - they have loads of information on these topics.\n\nA: thank you folks - coming from someone who has almost zero knowledge of supporting macs on an enterprise level, i really appreciate all the replies. for one, it has broadened the spectrum of how and what I can do to achieve the said target is. \ni've took up most of your pointers and they have forked into many other areas of exploration and learning of ways and means to get the job at hand done. i've decided on a \"blended\" solution that kinda gets it done - provision with applescript, calling in a shell script and a little bit of UI scripting all done within a single double clickable executable - that should help with the pressure of quick roll out for now.\nI am working on laying on the imaging route for our next big wave of macs coming in as i type now :)  \n", "Q: What's a good iTunes alternative to use with my iPod nano 6g?

You don't even have to be in sync with that iTunes library, just plug it in, navigate to your music, and press play.\nIf you're talking about like game audio coming out your mac's speakers... I'd take your speakers and plug them straight into the phone. There's no way I know of to use the mac as an audio route from the phone.\n\nA: The LineIn free app worked great.\nThe Rogue Amoeba product LineIn is an excellent free utility for listening to external audio.\nAdvantages over QuickTime Player\nLineIn has several advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*LineIn has lower (nearly none!) audio lag, whereas QuickTime Player has about ~500ms of increased audio latency.\n\n*Does not shift to the wrong speed/pitch issue; this is a problem that sometimes manifests with QuickTime Player.\n\n*Does not replace the top bar with 9:41 AM and 100% Battery.\n\n\nHow To\n\n\n*\n\n*After plugging the iPhone on your Mac (via Lightning/USB), enable the audio device in Audio Midi Setup.app:\n\n\n*Launch the LineIn.app, and select iPhone as the input source:\n \n\n*Hit Play Thru and you're done!\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the iPhone is not muted.\n\n*Step one will need to be done again once the iPhone is unplugged and plugged back in.\n\n\nA: Run Airfoil Speakers on your mac..it'll then allow you to airplay just like you would to an apple TV or airport express.  You do have to be on the same wifi network for this to work.\n\nA: Simple, and simply surprising:\n\n*\n\n*First, check that you have enabled the iPhone/iPad as an audio input device in Audio Midi Setup.app:\n\n\n\n\n*Plug in your iPhone to your Mac using your Lightning Cable (doesn't work with 30 pin iPhones, sorry.

Just turn up the volume.\n\nNote: for those who want a louder volume, go to the system preferences on your Mac. Then go to the sound settings and you can increase the output volume so it is louder.\n\nA: If your iPhone is running (I think) 4.0 or above, I think most machines should be able to mount the phone and play the music through iTunes. \n\nA: The solution is to use Miccuss or some other Bluetooth audio receiver to receive the audio via Bluetooth and pass the signal via cable to the Mac's audio input.\nMiccuss works perfectly, the sound is pristine. \nI am not sure why Apple can't (or won't) enable Mac's to receive audio from Bluetooth devices even when the service seem to be available in the Bluetooth profile (handsfree gateway). MS Windows Bluetooth support handsfree gateway in a hassle free way which gives it a versatility score in this area over Mac.\n\nA: To Play Music\n\n*\n\n*Plug in iPhone to computer via USB\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*Click iPhone button in iTunes near the the top left\n\n*Under Settings on the left there is  On My Device\n\n*Click Music, you should see all the music on your phone on the right.\n\n*Play that funky music.\n\n\nA: I tried all recommended with no sound output on a macbook pro.

Perhaps some could use the existing iPhone connector. But certainly if you get a male to male headphone adapter, you could take the audio out of the iPhone and into the audio input (mic) on the desktop, then use Audacity or another program to play the sound from the mic input\nMusic from iPhone\nIn iTunes, select your iPhone on the left column. Select music. Play.\n\nA: I know where this question is coming from. I sometimes like to plug my iPhone into the USB cable so it keeps being charged while I also like to play some type of videos like Periscope on the phone at all time. This leads to a problem that the AUX output from the iPhone will have background hiss noise because the USB port being plugged in.\nSo having the phone playing audio via the USB is the only method that can give you high quality audio output.\nBut unfortunately there is no commercially available method to create a USB audio receiver on OSX. But, there is an alternative. First, you must enable the iPhone's hotspot via USB. This can be done through purchasing hotspot plan from your wireless carrier or other illegal methods. Second, you must install a wireless audio receiver software like airfoil or airserver on your OSX. Third, you must enable the USB connection on your OSX's system setting under network. The name of such connection can be vary and unpredictable. Take your best guest. Fourth, enabling the audio playback on your iPhone via airplay. If you don't see the airplay, it means the connection isn't established successfully. Repeat the entire process until it does. It might never run successfully because of a number of reasons that can only be explained through a very long essay, of which I would not replicate here and now, and the connection may break after being established.\nNote this method will slow down your OSX sometimes quite dramatically.\n\nA: Turn a MacBook into an AirPlay receiver w/ macOS Monterey\n\nFortunately, there is now a better way. Installing MacOS Monterey\n(launching today) adds a feature dubbed ‘AirPlay to Mac’ which turns\nany MacBook or iMac into an AirPlay receiver. To activate ‘AirPlay to\nMac’, simply check the tickbox in the ‘Sharing’ preferences pane: the\nMacBook/iMac will now accept AirPlay audio streams from any iPhone or\niPad running iOS 15 or iPadOS 15 (or later). ‘AirPlay to Mac’ also\nworks with video content.\n\n", "Q: Which iPod has the best sound quality? I'd like to know if an iPod classic is a better investment than an iPod touch? I am really more into music than apps and games. If you have some other suggestions about great-sounding mp3 players I'd like to hear it.\n\nA: The 5th generation and earlier have the best sound because they use the Wolfson chips. (see this article for more info)\n\nA: I got an iPod Classic for Christmas to replace my aging iPod Mini (1st generation). The sound difference between the two is very obvious. I have a couple different sets of in-ear and over the ear headphones, all at least $100, that I used with the Mini, and with the Classic I'm hearing new stuff with every song. \nI attribute this to faster CPUs and better algorithms but I haven't checked to see how different the CPUs are. \n\nA: All current iPods support the same:\n\nFrequency response: 20Hz to 20,000Hz\n  Audio formats supported: AAC (8 to 320\n  Kbps), Protected AAC (from iTunes\n  Store), HE-AAC, MP3 (8 to 320 Kbps),\n  MP3 VBR, Audible (formats 2, 3, 4,\n  Audible Enhanced Audio, AAX, and\n  AAX+), Apple Lossless, AIFF, and WAV\n\nThis is from the Apple iPod tech specs page.\nSo, since they all support the same bitrates and formats, the quality does not change between models.\nGet whichever you want. The real sound quality difference will come from your speakers or headphones.\nNote: If you want the best sound, use the Apple Lossless format.\n\nA: Whoever will tell you the devices have the same sound output capabilities is certainly not an audiophile or is simply someone who needs an ears'check. I own an iPod Touch 2G, an iPod Nano 7th Gen, iPod Classic 5th Gen, iPhone 4S, iPhone 6s, iPad Air 2. The best, crisper, crystal clear sound, after testing all devices with the same FLAC album, same headphones and no equalizers enabled, the best audio quality comes out from the iPod Classic.\nPeriod.\n\nA: If you are not considering the speaker of the iPod Touch itself, the music is happening on a different device.  The only considerations then are whether the player can handle the music you throw at it, considering sample rate, bit rate, and compression.  Cheaper MP3 players, for example, could only handle 128 kbit/s, which wouldn't technically sound as good as 192 kbit/s.  CD quality sound is 44.1 kHz and ~1,400 kbit/s.  The MP3 is compressed, so the bit rate is obviously less.\nThe other consideration is whether your player's flash can be upgraded.  The downside to this is having it run very slowly.\nAnother consideration is how you will use it, whether it will be jogging or setting in a cradle to a bigger sound system.\n", "Q: Video out on iPod dock: pre-iOS versus iOS I have an iPod dock with Video Out. It says on the box that it only supports pre-iOS devices for that (iPod classic and the like), and it certainly does not seem to do anything with my iPod Touch (audio and remote control work fine, though).\nIs this something that can be solved with an additional (cheap) adapter, or are the two Video Out systems fundamentally different?\n\nA: Unfortunately, the old video output is not compatible with iOS devices, even with an adapter. To see, why, here's a diagram of the iPod dock connector pinout. Notice that there are some video output pins that are only used for older iPods.\n", "Q: MobileMe bookmark sync with Opera I am forced to use Opera instead of Safari on windows, and would like to sync my bookmarks with MobileMe. Is this at all possible?\n\nA: Not with MobileMe's built in sync function, it only works with Safari.\nYou could use Opera's Link, which might work ok for what you're after -\n\nCan I use other browsers to access my bookmarks?\nYes, you can log into a web-based user interface using Opera browsers, including Opera for Mac/PC, Opera Mobile or Opera Mini. You can also access your bookmarks using other Web browsers like Internet Explorer, Firefox or Safari. (Opera faq)\n\n\nA: Like dropbox, you could simlink the Opera bookmark file into your iDisk. Something like ln -s /Users/.../bookmark.dat /Volumes/iDisk/bookmark.dat\nIf you want cross-browser bookmark sync - wait for xmarks or similar to come to both of those browsers, so far ti's probably only firefox and chrome.\n", "Q: How can I switch option (alt) and command (windows) keys for Windows 7 in Boot Camp? Installed Windows 7 via Bootcamp for some work-related projects. I've also installed the Apple Bootcamp drivers from the OS X install disk and updated to the latest version. It mapped all my keys just fine, but I was surprised it does not offer an option to switch the mappings of Alt and Windows keys; ie. Alt is left of Spacebar, Windows key is left of Alt.\nThe current way directly maps to the physical keyboard layout, but not to the way people are used to working: e.g. OS X's Command+Tab for window switching is equivelant to Alt+Tab not Windows+Tab. I keep hitting the wrong keys because of muscle memory. :)\nIs there a built-in way to remap Windows and Alt keys? If not, what 3rd party app is the best way to do this?\n\nA: Here is a script file for the Apple keyboard with F hotkeys and CMD hotkeys too.\nhttps://github.com/stroebjo/autohotkey-windows-mac-keyboard\n\nA: I didn't like Sharp Keys because it requires a restart to swap mappings. Other AutoHotKey scripts here had too much extra stuff for my needs. This AutoHotKey script is only the win key swap, plus a hotkey to turn it off (ctrl+F6) if you also occasionally use a Windows keyboard.\n\nA: I had this issue.  Resolved it using Sharp Keys (free). \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/map-any-key-to-any-key-on-windows-xp-vista/\n\nA: I've been using AutoHotKey for about a year on Win7 Ultimate x64. Works great. \nIn addition to swapping the left Command and Option keys, I've remapped the right Command to forward delete, and right Option to \"AppsKey\" (aka, context menu) which helps in Visual Studio and other apps.\nIf you want function keys to work as, well, function keys (without having to hold down Fn), you can set that in the Bootcamp application via the system tray icon.\nHere's a script just for swapping left Option (alt) and Command (Windows):\nRAlt::AppsKey ; right-Option to context menu\nRWin::Del ; right command to forward delete\nLWin::LAlt ; left command to alt\nLAlt::LWin ; left alt to command (windows key)\n\nYou may also consider remapping Caps Lock if you need an additional key since, really, how often do any of us use Caps Lock? \n\nA: I would like to share a trick that you can remap some less used keys to keys you prefer. E.g. I map right CMD to DEL and right ALT to menu('application'), using Sharpkeys\n", "Q: File location of kernel extensions? Is there an easy way to make the mapping from kernel extension to the file it came from?\nI can get the list of currently loaded kernel extension via kextstat. This gives me the bundle names, like com.AmbrosiaSW.AudioSupport or jp.plentycom.driver.SteerMouse. But how can I then find the actual file locations of these bundles? For example, the Ambrosia bundle is AmbrosiaAudioSupport.kext, and I can only find the bundle name in the Info.plist inside that bundle. I could grep the /System/Library/Extensions/ directory, but this does not necessarily contain extensions loaded after booting, and I assume there is a better way to do it?\n\nA: You can use kextfind -b <bundlename> to find the file defining a kext you only know the bundle name of.\nEDIT: newer versions of kextfind need a -print predicate to show output. Example updated below.\nFor example:\nkextfind -b com.AmbrosiaSW.AudioSupport -print\n\n\nA: See kextfind\n\nA: Try About this mac -> System report -> Software section -> Extensions.\nIt shows the filepath upon selecting an extension.\n", "Q: iPhone restarts frequently whilst tethering via.

I'm aware of the ability to use accented characters by holding down a key until they appear (ie. á ü etc.); however, I'm curious as to how, if possible, one might enter a code point in hexadecimal format or otherwise to output the corresponding character?\n\nA: UniK - Unicode & navigation Keyboard extension seems to be the closest to a character map and it also functions as a keyboard extension. You actually have to type hexadecimal code points in this app.\n\nA: There are applications in the App Store that display all of the characters allowed in the Unicode set that you can copy and paste into other applications like Mail and the like. Searching \"unicode\" in the App Store brings up a whole slew of them, both free and paid. \nThere is also Glyphboard (visit with your iOS device) that you can save as a bookmark on your iOS device for an easy interface to some of the more popular ones. This is very lightweight and changes every so often.\n\nA: I wonder if you ever found a way to enter Unicode characters directly on the ipad? \nIt's 2017.09 and the closest I've found is the app Unichar. Can't enter (uni)codes directly, but it has 18 unicode pages avaible (in the paid version, 8 in the free version.) Interesting is that it installs as an app that you can open, but also has a keyboard with the same level of features as the app and similar interface\nThis is as close of an answer as I've found to the same question. It's odd apple resists users' interest for so long.\n\nA: I have been looking for similar and the best third party app I've found for arbitrary unicode input is called UnicodeLab.\nIt allows you to input any unicode in decimal or hex, view it in multiple fonts, and copy it to the clipboard. You can also cycle through neighboring character codes easily. \nIt is free.\n\nA: I think IOS don't provide unicode Hex Input because it could impact the performance.

Will Excel formulas be OK if they are imported within a spreadsheet into iPad Numbers?\n\nA: In general yes - but there are some functions that are only in Excel.\nGoogling found this comparison for Apple Numbers for Mac OS.\n", "Q: Why can't I transfer purchases from my jailbroken iPhone 3GS to iTunes? I have a jailbroken iPhone 3GS and I cannot transfer purchases to iTunes.\nThis is a recent issue; I could transfer purchases earlier.\n\nA: If both iTunes and the iPhone are logged into the same iTunes account and you still can't sync the apps and you don't want to play with the iPhone too much (jailbreaking does weird things sometimes, seemingly irrelevant stuff can break things), you can just download the apps again in iTunes. All purchases can be re-downloaded for free.\n", "Q: How can I transfer large files from Linux to iPad over a cable or wifi? I am looking for a way to transfer large files to the iPad without using iTunes or pushing to and pulling from a remote server.\nI run an Ubuntu laptop as my only OS at the moment and want to be able to transfer movies to my iPad.  I currently transfer most of my files by way of the dropbox app which works well for small files but is quite slow for larger files and eats up my bandwidth.  Ideally I'd like to be able to transfer over a cable or through WiFi.\nThanks for any tips.\n\nA: Since iOS 13, you are able to access SMB shares with the Files app. Just set up your share in the Linux system (I recommend usershares), create the user on samba (while samba allows you to have the same Linux user, it requires that you use samba specific utilities to set up the password) and use \"Connect to Server\" within Files on your iOS device.\n\nA: Look at the iOS app GoodReader.  GoodReader is a $5 app that allows you to transfer files from Windows, Mac OS X & Linux via WiFi to your iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch. You can then open the files in other apps based on the filetype.\n\nA: Simply install VLC app from the app store and use its wifi transfer feature (in the sidebar of vlc app) to transfer videos(in all formats recognizable by vlc) into your vlc library.... \nUPDATE: This method not only works for audio/video formats but pretty much all file formats. Ofcourse, VLC won't show these files but one could access them using any decent File manager app such as Document.\n\nA: Yes! You can transfer files to / from the iPad from Ubuntu via USB.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can always transfer files via SSH / a Samba share / etc.\n\n*However that would be over Wifi, which is nowhere near as fast as USB connectivity.\n\n*Via USB you can only access /var/root/Media on the ipad. Useful to put movies onto it - you will need to find a way to make these visible within iPad - I think you need to create some playlist?  \n\n\n*\n\n*I use FileBrowser on the iPad and since my iPad is jailbroken, I ssh in and mv the transferred files from /var/root/Media to /var/mobile/Applications/[app-ID]/.data/Movies/. It is then visible within FileBrowser and Movies can be played there. \n\n\n\nSteps\nInstall additional PPA repository\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:pmcenery/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\nInstall libimobiledevice-utils\nsudo apt-get install libimobiledevice-utils\n\nPlug in the iPad / iPod / iPhone.

When I connect the iPad to my comp with usb it brings up a folder called \"Documents on YOUR NAME's iPad\". In this I can open the Document app's folder and just drag and drop. The files appear in the app then....magic! \n\nA: *\n\n*Install Zip & RAR File Extractor in your iPad\n\n*Create a zip folder in your Linux machine of the files which you want to transfer.\n\n*Open the Zip extractor app on your iPad, then go to Wi-Fi Transfer. It will show a web address. Write that address into your Linux web browser. There is an option of \"Upload files\", just click and upload the zip file and then transfer.\n\n*Open iPad files, go to \"On My iPad\" and then go to the \"Zip Extractor folder\". You can see that the file has been transferred. Touch on that zip file, and you will see the file has been extracted.\n\n\nA: FileBrowser is very good for transferring files.\n\nA: I used to transfer by uploading to dropbox and downloading files on the dropbox app on my ipad. \nThere is another way which doesn't need internet which is using the app called \"wireless drive\". With this basically you connect your ipad with your laptop by creating wifi hotspot and transfer the files. But my ipad is unable to connect the wifi created by my new laptop. (wifi connection problem for unknown reason) ..... what do I do? I dont have internet right now.\nYou do following (after installing the app):\n\n\n*\n\n*just connect ipad to laptop using usb cable.\n\n*You see \"documents on the ipad\" as a usb drive (as the external-pen drive)\n\n*open the documents on the ipad > you see different apps you have on the ipad\n\n*You will see \"wireless drive\" in the list, open it by double-clicking.\n\n*You will see folder \"documents\", open it.\n\n*You will see folder is empty, if it's used for the first time.\nJust simply copy whatever you want to copy to your ipad in this folder and that's it!! \n\n\nNow, just open the \"wireless drive\" app on your ipad, and you see the files you have transferred. Tap on any of the document, you will be asked which app to be used to open/run the file, select appropriate app and you can use the file on your ipad.\n\nA: Download Folder Lock for your iPad and enjoy its WiFi File Transfer feature.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id372925917?pt=329691&ct=fa&mt=8\n\nA: Install Phone Drive Free from the app store. You don't need to jailbreak your idevice.\nPhone Drive Free will tell you the device address. Enter this into your web browser. The browser will give you an interface to drag n drop your files. \n\nA: I just connected my iPad 2021 to Ubuntu 22.04 and I got access to Clips, GarageBand and several other folders.

When I choose, transfer - It transfered all the items. \n\n*Even though it was not from same account of itunes.\n\n*I have different iTunes account & purchased application was from different itunes account even though it could transfer - my question is why - iTunes allows doing this ? \n\n\nOk. One more problem that I faced is as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*When I was in wifi range, I directly downloaded an application ( using same account which I have on my itunes ).\n\n*Next when I connected iPhone to iTunes, it didn't transferred anything & I lost my downloaded application.\n\n\nDid any-one faced this issue ? If yes,\nWhat did you do to resolve this issue ?\nThanks in Advance for sharing your great Knowledge.\nSugar.\n\nA: 1)your friends itunes account was probably registered on your phone when you synced with the computer.\n2) you can only be synced with one itunes account at a time. your problem might be that your synced with your friends account so any app that you download with your account wont be able to sync any apps unless you change it to sync with your account(which will delete all apps not purchased with your account.)\n\nA: Either there was previous authorization on your system for his account, or if the iPhone was modified in some fashion (ie. Jailbreak), then any predictability with normal function goes out the window.\nIf iTunes synced and removed an application without any warning, then there is a problem with your iTunes, or there may be a corruption with the iPhone requiring a possible restore. I'd de-authorize the computer, re-authorize, and then sign out and back in on your iPhone with further testing.\n\nA: It is possible to use applications from different accounts on one iPhone. I do this too, where I usually download the free apps with my account and the paid with my wife's (we usually only buy using gift cards, and by redeeming all gift cards on one account we save up the spare cents after each 0.99€ song). For this to work, I needed to authorize my iTunes installation to use stuff bought using my wife's account.\nSo it's possible that you authorized your computer some time in the past to play music from your friends computer (even by streaming them, not only a file copy), and iTunes remembered this authorization so you can get the apps now. For updates to these apps it will ask for the password of your friend, so you see this use-case is usually limited to situations where people know each other very well and password sharing is not a big problem (in one household, usually).\nIn the mobile version of the App Store you can see which account you're logged in as by scrolling down on the first page. If it's still acting weird a restore could help that. Since you were able to transfer the purchased apps from the iPhone to your computer, you should be able to place them back after the restore.\n\nA: You must ensure you sync the iPhone with one and the same iTunes account. To authorize/deauthorize iTunes, you might want to have a look at this Apple page:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1420\n", "Q: What are the best mnemonics to remember important short cuts? In my job I teach a lot of people to use macs. Since you use what you remember I'm always on the look out for funny or memorable ways to remember keyboard or system shortcuts (like you have the option to command escape, I know it's corny, but it works for newbies!). \nWhat are the mnemonics you use to remember important keyboard or system shortcuts? Funny is a bonus. \nEDIT / UPDATE\nSorry I've been away for a bit and haven't updated my question for a bit. A bit more info - I'm teaching a digital class of 8,9 and 10 year olds (who have a MacBook each) this year; and I'm looking for funny ways for them to remember the things you commonly do on your mac. Kids love learning shortcuts (for some reason) and any thing I can do to help them build confidence and have a laugh is great. \nHere are the shortcuts that would be handy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Force Quit (That was my example, you\nhave the option to\ncommand escape).\n\n*Search (command space)\n\n*Command Tab\n\n*Expose (Four fingers down on the mouse pad!?)\n\n*Command ShiftK (Connect to a nearby server in finder)\n\n*Apple ShiftA for Applications\n\n*Anything else you might think is handy. \n\n\nI know it's a bit of a vague question, I'm just looking for any fun and easy way to teach these shortcuts. \n\nA: Spotlight:\nI've heard it remembered as 'space command'. Like you're the commander of a futuristic spaceship and you're talking to the computer, asking it to look for something or open something. You're commanding the space ship.\nPress command-space to access Space Command.\n\nA: Of the most commonly used keyboard shortcuts, I've found that most new users find the ones for \"cut\" and \"paste\" are the most difficult to remember. Not difficult, though, if you think of the \"X\" for \"cut\" as a pair of scissors, and \"V\" for paste as \"viscous\".\nBut blindingly funny ones?  Hmm, you've stumped me there...\n\nA: \"Very much long work causes injury just because stress yanks energy gradually.\"\nmoVe    V very\nMarquee M much\nLasso   L long\nWand    W work\nCrop    C causes\nEye I injury\nHealing J just  (Jesus heals)\nBrush   B because\nStamp   S stress\nHistorY Y yanks\nErasor  E energy\nGradiant G gradually\nBlur    -- \n\"Optimum practice teaches attention under hard rigor.\"\nDOdge   O Optimum\nPen P Practice\nText    T Teaches\nSelect  A Attention\nShapes  U Under\nHand    H Hard\nRotate  R Rigor\nSwitch X (Exchange)\nDefault D\nQuick Mask  Q\nScreen F (Full)\n\nA: The most obvious mnemonic is really the first letter of the action wanted in combination with ⌘, e.g. ⌘-F for 'Find'. The hard part comes when that is reserved to some other command than the intended.\nI'd suggest first learning the most used shortcuts (maybe just one or two) and start using them whenever possible. After a while, when those come right from the spine, form a habit of adopting a few new shortcuts every week or month, what seems to be appropriate rate for one. Gradually one knows a conciderable amount of shortcuts.\n\nA: Command - F -- usually finds\nCommand - C -- usually copies\nCommand - V -- usually pastes\nCommand - F -- usually cuts\nCommand - Space -- spotlight, or I configured it to alfred\nCommand - Tab / Command - Shift - Tab -- Tab between open applications\nCommand - ` / Command - Shift - ` -- Tab between windows of current application\nCommand - T -- usually open a new tab\nCommand - W -- close current window / document\nCommand - Q -- quit current application\n\nCommand - [ -- history back (browser, finder)\nCommand - ] -- history forward (browser, finder)\nCommand - Shift - [ -- switch to previous tab\nCommand - Shift - ] -- switch to next tab\n\nCtrl - Left / Right -- Switch to different workspace left / right\nCtrl - Up -- Expose all windows of all apps\nCtrl - Down -- Expose all windows of current app\n\nWithout terminal commands thats what I use daily, no more.

I can't find many solutions for changing the mouse cursor on OS X 10.6\nI've seen http://unsanity.com/haxies/mightymouse but it does not support 10.6 at the moment.\nAny hints or tricks to change the cursor? Specifically, I need to modify the text selection cursor as it is almost invisible when using a grey background in my IDE.\nThanks!\n\nA: There are a couple options:\nIn System Preferences > Universal Access > Mouse pane, there is a control to change the size of the cursor.\nMouseposé is an application that supports Snow Leopard used mostly for presentations and recording demos. You can set up a hotkey that dims the screen puts a spotlight on the current cursor position so you can find it quickly.\n\nA: Mousecape does a great job. It is almost completely undocumented, sub-1.0 release, and doesn't really come with any cursors. Still worth a look!\n\nA: Sorry, Apple doesn't allow people to change the mouse cursor anymore. \n\nA: Use Mousecape. I'm currently using version 0.0.5.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the program (version 0.0.5)\n\n*Double-click the program\n\n*Make a new mouse cape (cmd + n or by menus)\n\n*Drag image files on to each new pointer, choose what type of pointer\n\n*Move the Hot Spot to correctly register clicks\n\n\n\nI suggest getting images from free icon libraries. Google search or something. I downloaded some free icons and edited them.\nYou can use custom capes that others have made but the only one I've found is the one included in the source code. To get it, download the source and find the .cape file in it. Simple drag and drop the file into the program.\nYou can download the source code, etc, on github.\n\nA: You could use Mouse Locator and leave it on or turn it on via a hotkey when you need to find your cursor.\n\nA: The way you do this is \"System Preferences\" -> \"Accessibility\" -> \"Display\" -> \"Cursor\".\nInside the cursor tab you are table to change the size.

Besides working on their respective carriers, what are the similarities and differences between the AT&T iPhone 4 and Verizon iPhone 4?\n\nA: Due to the differences between CDMA and GSM, the antenna notches have been moved around. There are also 4 now instead of 3, and as a result of adding a notch on the left side of the phone, the mute switch is slightly lower on the Verizon iPhone 4 than the AT&T iPhone 4, which could cause cases made for the AT&T iPhone 4 to not fit the Verizon iPhone 4 properly:\n\nThough this may change in a future version of iOS, right now the Verizon iPhone 4 has a \"Personal Hotspot\" feature to share the data connection with up to 5 devices. In contrast, the AT&T iPhone 4 supports tethering through USB or Bluetooth only, and only to 1 device:\n\nFinally, because the Verizon iPhone 4 runs on Verizon's CDMA, it does not support simultaneous data and voice, unlike the AT&T iPhone 4 which does over 3G.\n\nA: Engadget summarized the differences... \nhttp://www.engadget.com/2011/01/11/atandt-iphone-4-vs-verizon-iphone-4-whats-changed/\n", "Q: Is the Verizon iPhone 4 susceptible to the 'grip of death'? Of course, it's possible to get any phone to lose a bit of signal if you cover the antenna with your hands, but I'm wondering if the Verizon iPhone 4 also suffers from the attenuation issues that the AT&T iPhone 4 famously suffered from last summer:\n\n\nA: ArsTechnica notes that there is no  noticeable signal loss when gripping it with the 'death grip'. Though due to the way smart phone antennas are designed, it still may be possible\n\nA: As an add-on to the Ars report: photos of the adjustment of button locations also show differing locations of the breaks in the metal band around the device, so it's quite possible there was a real hardware change.  \n\nOther pictures show different breaks near the bottom of the phone, too.\n\nA: The flaw is in the iPhone 4's antenna design, not the network or carrier.  So, I would say yes.  The software \"fix\" they released is supposed to make the bars depict signal quality more accurately, so you may find that while on Verizon, \"the death grip\" doesn't affect signal quality at all or as much.. but that doesn't negate that the antenna design itself is flawed physically, and that's why \"the death grip\" has any affect on signal quality.\n\nA: Slashgear confirms that the Verizon iPhone 4 does not suffer from the death grip:\n\nWe put our hand in the standard “death\n  grip” location, making sure that we\n  covered up all of the right spots, and\n  held onto the device for up to a\n  minute. When we started the test, the\n  device was at four bars. It should be\n  noted that full service is represented\n  on the iPhone 4 with 5 bars. So, the\n  test started with only four bars being\n  shown. As we held the device, and we\n  timed it at a minute, we watched as\n  only one bar disappeared.\nWe then put our fingers over certain\n  points on the device. Making sure to\n  cover up the “new” top portion of the\n  antenna, and we still couldn’t\n  reproduce the “death grip” symptoms\n  that plagued the initial launch of the\n  iPhone 4. You can check out the images\n  from our test below, but it looks like\n  Verizon’s confidence in the iPhone 4\n  on their network seem to be pretty\n  sound.\n\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro uses an extraordinary amount of RAM I bought my MacBook Pro about 1.5 years ago (with 4 GB RAM) but these days I think it uses an extraordinary amount of memory; when I open Firefox & Adium & Thunderbird & iTunes & last.fm it uses 3.84 of my 4GB RAM. I must say I installed several 3rd-party software packages on my laptop (maybe on start up they run some process of itself) is there any tool that exists to help me tune my laptop and find what processes run functionless in background, or is there any guideline to help me fix this problem?\n\n\nA: It's probably just been a while since you restarted your computer. When you close a program, the memory it was using doesn't go back to \"Free\", it gets marked \"Inactive\". It's still available for use by other programs, though:\n\nInactive memory\nThis information in memory is not actively being used, but was recently used.\nFor example, if you've been using Mail and then quit it, the RAM that Mail was using is marked as Inactive memory. This Inactive memory is available for use by another application, just like Free memory.  However, if you open Mail before its Inactive memory is used by a different application, Mail will open quicker because its Inactive memory is converted to Active memory, instead of loading Mail from the slower hard disk.\n\n\nA: There are probably tools that make it easier to suss things out than using Activity Viewer, but in the end, you just have to be careful what you install. Depending on the applications you install, there may very well be frameworks, daemons, and the like that can run unnecessarily. last.fm is a music streaming application and that is a known resource hog. McAfee AnitVirus is another; I had McAfee slow my machine to a crawl trying to scan my iDisk. The best example I can offer is I got rid of all Adobe applications and related files including Flash off of my home Macs and I found things to be snappier all around (and if I do need Flash for something, which is fast becoming a rare event, I just crack open Google Chrome). I'd say it's simply time for some housecleaning.\n", "Q: Power adapter connection issues Lately, my Magsafe power adapter has not been connecting properly:\n\n\n*\n\n*The wires are not worn out as I take good care of them\n\n*The issue happens when I try to connect my power adapter to my computer\n\n*The LED does not come on and the MacBook does not get charged. I have to unplug and plug the power adapter several times until I can get a connection.\n\n*The cord and computer intake seem clean and no pins are pushed down\n\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: Even if there isn't any obvious cable damage or bulging, the adapter could be failing. If the adapter is not one of the newer L-Shape Magsafe plugs, the need for a SMC firmware update is moot, but it's helpful to have the system up to date regardless.\nHave you confirmed if a second, known-good adapter works on your Mac?\nUpdated: An SMC reset can also correct magsafe LED issues. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964\n\nA: Your MagSafe power adapter could require frequent reset because of an external problem: the electrical wiring in your home is substandard, and/or the power provided by your electrical company is sending \"dirty\" current out of your wall outlet and into your MagSafe adapter. This official Apple support document refers to this problem as \"line noise issues\".\nThis means that the alternating current (AC) is irregular, and the MagSafe adapter cannot handle it. The best way to test for this is to use your MagSafe adapter and your MacBook at another location, possibly in another neighborhood, in a house or business where the electrical wiring is newer. If the problem goes away, this is an indication that the electrical wiring and electrical service in your home are substandard. \nFixing this would of course be an expensive proposition, and involve the services of a professional electrical contractor to retrofit the electrical system in your home or business, or to install expensive power conditioning equipment.\n\nA: Do you restart your computer regularly?  If not, you may want to try that.  I suggest this because my early 2011 MacBook Pro's Magsafe indicator did not light up yesterday when I plugged it in.  This is the first time that I've seen this.  I tried several times and it did not light up and charging was not detected on the menu bar icon. \nAfter doing a full system reboot, everything was fine, though.  \nI'm not suggesting this will solve the problem, but it may be worth trying.\n\nA: When I had a problem like this (the light would not come on and the menu bar status icon said “Not Charging”), I called AppleCare and they chose to replace the power adapter, and the problem did not reoccur.\n\nA: Make sure you have the newest SMC firmware. This controls connecting to the MagSafe and charging.\nUse this Apple page to see if there are any updates available.\n\nA: I have a similar issue. It is reliably solved by rubbing the connections on one or both ends with a Q-tip. There may be some static or oxidation on the surface, and removing it solves my problem. I have to do this almost every day  \n", "Q: How can I diagnose a superdrive that won't read disks? My MacBook (Snow Leopard) seems to be unable to read DVDs and CDs. When I insert a disk (DVD or CD, I've tried a couple of each), the drive spins up, and (it sounds like) moves the laser back and forth a few times, then ejects the disk. I haven't tried blank media.\nI've searched around the nets, and it looks like I may be experiencing a relatively common problem, but I don't want to jump to conclusions. Unfortunately, all the threads I've found are filled with \"me too, me too\", and not a lot in terms of actual help. \nWhat tools can I use, or tests can I run, to try to diagnose (and perhaps even solve) the problem myself before I give up and replace the drive?\n\nA: Try running the Apple Hardware Test.  If I remember right, reboot holding D.  If that doesn't work, reboot while holding D, with an OS X disk in.  Of course you'll need to have an external DVD drive for that to work.\n\nA: It would depend first on what it means to not read the discs. Does the disc insert and then eject, or simply not show up in the Finder? Does it mount and not burn properly? etc.\nYou can check for the optical drive in your System Profiler to see if the hardware is present (see: Disc Burning).\n", "Q: Add heading to Google Docs document from iPhone quite a straightforward question. I started to really like Google Docs and the fact I can edit them from iPhone from the mobile site.\nHowever, I would like to add headings to the documents while editing on iPhone. It is not possible through any drop-menu, but isn't there some sort of hack?\n\nA: I can suggest several for title editing, but I'm unaware of any that offer headings. \nIf you've already scanned through the available App Store offerings without much success, then I can suggest little-else. It's not about a hack, as Google hasn't gone out of their way to restrict you in this fashion.

Or does UserB need to log in via the GUI also, and then \"switch\" (not log out) to UserA?\n\nA: DropBox does not support not-logged-in users. The solution seems to be the following:\nLog in and start Dropbox from the command line:\nalias dropbox='/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/Dropbox &'\ndropbox # start it.\n\nps aux | grep -i dropbox # shows multiple instances running\n\nThe above technique seems to work. Error messages are sent when the second Dropbox launches:\nalready someone listening at socket\n\nRegisterApplication(), FAILED TO establish the default connection to the WindowServer, _CGSDefaultConnection() is NULL.\n\nBut everything appears to work.\n\nA: The Dropbox app runs as the logged-in user, and uses user-specific preferences to determine which Dropbox it's associated with and where the local Dropbox folder is located, so I'd assume that means that it only works for the logged-in user.

In the article they alluded towards a developer running Swype on his iPhone, however no releases or leaks are anywhere to be found.\nMy guess... just a guess... is that they are trying to work around the need to jailbreak your iPhone in order to run it.\nIf you follow the Engadget blog, you'll be among the first to know.\n", "Q: How to securely erase an SSD drive? I'm pretty new to SSD technology, so I don't know how it compares to hard drives when it comes to securely erasing the drive. Is it enough to run Disk Utility and erase the drive with the option \"overwrite with zeroes\", or is this designed for hard drives? Are there other actions that should be taken?\nI'm not looking for NSA-grade security though, just the kind of wipe you'd do if you're returning or selling the Mac.\n\nA: Open a terminal and type the following command:\ndf -k\n\nNote the first column corresponding to the partition of the SSD you\nwould like to irreversibly erase. Let's say it is /dev/disk1s2.\nType the following command:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rdisk1s2 bs=100k\n\nwhere /dev/rdisk1s2 is the raw device associated with your partition\non SSD. This command will completely write this partition from 1st block\navailable to the last one. This command will last long (~1/2 h for 100 Gbytes) with no nice scroll bar of progress.\nOnce this command return you the prompt of your shell the disk has been\ncompletly and irreversibly erased.\nStart Disk Utility and check this partition.\nIt will tell you it is dammaged beyond any form of repair.\nAnd it is right.\nJust format this partition as you like.\nHere is what is happening at the physical blocks level:\n\nA: The \"Security Options...\" button in Disk Utility is currently grayed out for SSDs. According to http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3680, erasing an SSD normally might be secure enough:\n\nNote: With OS X Lion and an SSD drive, Secure Erase and Erasing Free Space are not available in Disk Utility. These options are not needed for an SSD drive because a standard erase makes it difficult to recover data from an SSD. For more security, consider turning on FileVault 2 encryption when you start using the SSD drive.\n\nIt is still possible to run something like diskutil secureErase freespace 4 disk0s2 from Terminal on the recovery partition.\nSimply turning on FileVault 2 before erasing the drive is probably a better option though. According to this answer, performing a remote wipe also just erases the encryption key if FileVault 2 is enabled:\n\nYes, when you remotely wipe the computer it does a secure wipe. Apple even warns you that it could take as long as a day. However, if your drive was encrypted with FileVault 2, then it is not necessary to erase the disk. It is sufficient to securely erase the encryption key(s) stored on the disk, so that's what they do. It's very quick and as secure as the underlying encryption system is, which for now is very secure.\n\nhttp://training.apple.com/pdf/wp_osx_security.pdf:\n\nFileVault 2 provides IT departments with the ability to erase the encryption key from a given Mac at any time to ensure that encrypted data cannot be accessed by either user login or data recovery tools. This process is referred to as a remote wipe.\n\n\nA: It depends on your paranoia level. Because of the way SSDs handle writing data, doing a zero-once on an SSD is not as good as doing so on a hard drive.\nWhen you write a particular data page on an HD, the new data is simply written over the old data, replacing it. Write zeros over the whole disk and all the old data will be gone. SSDs, on the other hand, cannot simply overwrite individual pages. In order to replace the data on a page, the old data must first be erased, and SSDs cannot erase individual pages; they have to erase entire blocks consisting of many pages. \nSo what happens when you ask an SSD to overwrite, say, page #5, is that the SSD leaves the data on page #5 alone, but marks it as invalid, allocates another currently-blank page (say, #2305), writes the new data to page #2305, and makes a note that next time the OS asks for page #5 it should get #2305 instead. The original page #5 data sits there until some later time, when the drive needs more space, moves any remaining valid pages away from the block, and erases it. SSDs have more physical memory capacity than they expose to the computer, so they can juggle blocks like this for a while before actually having to erase anything (and when they do actually erase something, there's no good way to predict which blocks of leftover data will be chosen for erasure). See this AnandTech review for way more details (warning: it's fairly long, and the relevant stuff is spread around).\nNet result: if you write zeros over the \"whole\" drive, you haven't actually overwritten all the old data. You have updated the controller's translation table so it'll never return any of the old data to the OS (those pages are all invalid). But if someone's hardcore enough to bypass the controller, they could get some of your data back.\nOverwriting twice will probably work, but it depends on the controller's allocation strategy. Overwriting twice with random data (diskutil randomDisk 2 /dev/diskN) is a little more likely to work, but still not guaranteed.  Both of these also have some bad side-effects: they uses some of the lifetime of the drive, and also increase the logical fragmentation on the SSD, decreasing its write performance.\nNote that recent versions of OS X's graphical Disk Utility disable the secure erasure options on SSDs (for the reasons discussed above), but the command-line version still allows them. BTW, I have also seen several recommendations to securely erase SSDs by converting them to encrypted format, but this is (if anything) slightly less secure than overwriting with random data.\nThe best way to secure-erase an SSD is to invoke the controller's built-in secure-erase feature. This should (if the controller designers did their jobs) truly erase all blocks, and also have the side-effect of resetting the logical page map, essentially defragmenting it and restoring its original performance.  Unfortunately, most of the utilities I've seen for doing this (e.g. CMRR's HDDErase) run under DOS, which won't boot on a Mac. I did find a posting on macrumors with (rather complex) instructions for doing a secure erase from a GParted boot CD. It might also be possible to use Parted Magic from a bootable flash drive, but I have not tried this.\nResearchers at the Non-Volatile Systems Lab at UCSD have tested various ways of sanitizing SSDs by \"erasing\" the drive, then disassembling it to bypass the controller, and checking for remnant data (summary, full paper).  Their results mostly agree with what I said above (and also show that the built-in secure-erase command isn't always implemented properly):\n\nOur results lead to three conclusions:\n  First, built-in commands are effective, but manufacturers\n  sometimes implement them incorrectly. Second,\n  overwriting the entire visible address space of an SSD\n  twice is usually, but not always, sufficient to sanitize the\n  drive. Third, none of the existing hard drive-oriented\n  techniques for individual file sanitization are effective on\n  SSDs.\n\n", "Q: Convert from OpenOffice to Pages Does anybody has experience in how to best convert OpenOffice.org documents to pages documents.\nObviously, it can be read in a Text Editor.\n\nA: The way I do it is I export the OpenOffice document to Microsoft Word DOC format, then use Pages to convert that into a Pages document. There may be some formatting loss, but I'm not aware of a way to convert directly from one format to the other.\n\nA: I would suggest saving in RTF format instead of Word format as OS X has a very competent RFT engine as used by TextEdit and, I would guess, Pages. This avoids the conversion in and out of a poorly defined format with no public specification.\n", "Q: Is it possible to disable or hide the digital zoom controls in the Camera app on iPhone? I don't think I have ever used the digital zoom feature in the Camera app. The controls are just in the way when you wan't to focus something in that part of the image. So, if possible, I want to hide them. I'm not afraid to jailbreak my phone if that is what i takes. Any answer appreciated.\nI have an iPhone 3GS.\n\nA: Currently there is no officially supported method of disabling the digital zoom feature. One way around it that I use when I (rarely) need to focus on the lower screen portion, is to focus on the subject, then move the camera's view to the preferred state. The camera will preserve this focus state long enough for a picture.\n\nA: It's possible for a developer to hide them when displaying the camera interface. But there's no way for a user to turn that control off in Apple's \"Camera\" app.\n\nA: Simply instal a different camera app that's more focused (see what I did there) on experienced photographers. ProCam, for example, has an option not only to disable digital zoom, but also tells the truth about how the two lenses on the 7 Plus work, by providing direct control over which lens is active, rather than hiding the (possible, but not guaranteed) switch at 2x \"zoom\".\n", "Q: Can I install apps bought on the Mac App Store on multiple computers? If I buy an app on through the Mac App Store, can I install it on both of my Macs?\nI use the same iTunes account on both of them.\n\nA: There is no numerical limit, and you don't need to run App Store on every Mac. The App Store's own online Help document explains all this -- from App Store, open Help, then select Purchase Applications>Use Applications on Multiple Macs for details.\nThe only restriction on this is if your purchase was for commercial use and more than one person uses the apps. In that case the language of the license asks for one purchase per user or one purchase per computer.\n\nA: Yes. Just run the App Store app on the second Mac and go to the Purchases tab. You'll see a list of the apps you've already purchased, with an Install button next to each one - click the button to install on the second Mac.\n\nA: You can in fact do this. There may be a limit to the number of devices similar to how iTunes limits you to 5 \"authorized\" computers. I'm not sure though. The concept is that the computers you install them on are supposed to be your own, but the truth is there is not literally any verification process to determine this. Fortunately, Apple never makes you jump through annoying anti-piracy hoops. I know this because I have Mac App Store apps on 2 computers in my house.\n\nA: Yes, you can install apps bought from the Mac App Store on any and every Mac that you personally own and use.\nI suggest you read this article about mac app-store\n\nLicenses and copy protection\nCan I buy an app on one Mac for use on all my computers?\nYes, you can install apps bought from the Mac App Store on any and\n  every Mac that you personally own and use.\nWhat about the five-Mac restriction that I have with videos I bought\n  from iTunes? Does that work for Apps too?\nNo. Apps don't check to see if you've using an iTunes-authorized Mac.\n  They can ask you to verify your Apple ID and password, but that's a\n  single check and it's just to verify you are who you say you are. Once\n  your identity is verified, that's it. There's no authorizing or\n  deauthorizing or counting of different Macs.\nDoes that mean I could buy one copy of an app and install it on every\n  Mac in my business?\nNo, the license you agree to when you enter the Mac App Store says\n  that app downloads are for Macs that you personally own, and that's a\n  license for personal use. Apps that are intended for professional use\n  are licensed for you or for a single computer used by several people.\n  While there's no technical impediment to you installing them on\n  multiple Macs at work, you'll be violating the license agreement. It's\n  the same scenario as if you buy a single-user copy of iWork and\n  install it on ten Macs at work—you can do it, but you're violating the\n  license agreement, making the act ethically questionable.\n\n\nA: Apple's rules: If you buy the app for private use, then you are allowed to run the app on up to six computers that you own and control. If you buy the app for commercial use, then you are allowed to either run it on any number of computers used by the same person, or on one computer used by any number of persons. \nAnd none of these is checked by Apple. \n\nA: No, you cannot. According to my research in the field, it is not allowed, except in North Korea.\n", "Q: Does latest MacBook Air have powered USB ports? I see that the latest 13 inch MacBook Air has two USB 2.0 ports, but can they power, say, a 2.5 inch external hard drive?\n\nA: Yes, the USB ports are powered.

I just recorded a video on my phone, but when I play it on my Mac it's in the wrong orientation. \nHow can I rotate the video by 90 degrees so that I can upload it to youtube?\nFree solutions are preferred.\n\nI just found out how to do it using YouTube's Video Editor which has rotate left/right buttons. \nBut this is not an answer how to rotate on Mac.\n\nA: Use QuickTime to Rotate Videos\nYou don't need to use any 3rd party tools to do this. It's built right in to QuickTime Player.\nAny file that can be opened in QuickTime can be rotated by choosing Edit > Rotate Left (or Right) or by typing Command-Shift-L / R.\nIf you alter a movie file in this way and attempt to close the file (Command-W) you will be prompted to save your changes.

Any time you drain the battery at all, and then charge it, the drain + charge is counted towards 'a cycle', where 'a cycle' means the battery has drained, and been charged, 100%.\nSo if you drain it half way and charge it fully, twice, that counts as 'a cycle'.  These batteries will last a certain number of cycles.  There are utilities out there that will check your cycle count, I often use one called \"Pow!\".\nOther than that;  run as few applications as possible.  Turn off any sensors (ambient light sensor, keyboard backlighting, etc).  Run the laptop with as dim a setting on the screen as possible.\nAlso, try to know what's running in the background.

This plugin extends the Finder to allow QuickLook to display the GIF in its animated form.\n\n\nA: In Mountain Lion and Mavericks, Mac's own Quick Look has GIF support, so clicking     space     or ⌘+Y while the GIF is selected will play it. It might take a second or two to load though, depending on the size of the GIF.\n\nA: Right-click it, go to the Open With menu, and choose Safari (or your other favorite Web browser).\nIt should open quickly, and will play the animation.\nNo internet connection is required if you have a local copy of the image.\n\nA: Answering the question, you go to your gif file, select it and press your space bar on your keyboard, to open a window that shows the animation of your gif.\nI had installed the QuickLook plugging, thinking that will be better and easier to view, maybe in the same window of finder, but i was wrong.

I really don't like to bookmark things (on iPad or other platforms) but just type a few relevent letters that bring the right site from browser history as a suggestion. However, on iPad I noticed that when I haven't visited a site for a while, Safari no longer suggests sites it previously did.\nSo, it seems that the browsing history is limited, by days or by size, am I right? I tried to stop Safari automatically deleting page history or at least increase the history size but there's nothing relevant in Settings for Safari.\nIs adding a bookmark for every site I want to be suggested for sure the only option? Are there any restrictions for amount of bookmarks?\n\nA: The iPad seems to limit its history to a week, which is presumably an acknowledgement of the limited RAM and storage in comparison to a traditional computer.\nAdding bookmarks for desired/frequent sites is the only way to make sure they come up easily.  There is no practical limit to the number of bookmarks, and you could easily shove all of those bookmarks in a folder you never visit directly.\n", "Q: I think I have bricked my MacBook Pro, what are my options to get it fixed? I have been having power issues with my MacBook Pro (late 2007?). The power cable had a dodgy connection, and kept cutting out. This destroyed the life of the battery to the point where it would only hold a charge for a couple of seconds. Last night it stopped booting up, so I reset the PRAM, and tried booting from a CD but it wouldn't fully boot.\nFinally, today I attempted to turn it on using a working power cable and there is no life whatsoever. The light goes green on the cable when I plug it in, but the power button doesn't give any life to the computer, no screen, no sound, nothing.\nI've tried booting it with the battery removed.\nWhat are my options? Is it likely to be a motherboard or RAM issue? Can I use the hard disk in another laptop to at least recover files? What is it likely to cost in repairs in the Apple store? \n\nA: Take it to an Apple Store (make an appointment first): they'll examine and diagnose it for you with no charge, and then tell you what they'd charge to fix it. \nDoesn't cost you anything and if the price is too great or you'd rather fix it yourself (now that you know the problem) then you can simply decline the service. It's a no-pressure deal, and one of the primary reasons I recommend Macs.\n\nA: You could try to drain the last energy out of the capacitors by removing the battery and the power cable, and then turn it on. Then try booting with a power cable again. If this doesn't help, there's not much you can do yourself. \nI'd guess it's a motherboard issue, with the history of dodgy power supplies that's imho more likely than RAM giving out. \nRemoving the harddisk and saving your files is indeed an option, you could look at sata-docks like this one. That way you can just take the files off instead of having to deal with booting the os on the hard drive in another laptop if you get what I mean.\nAs to the price of the repair: I have no clue at all.\n\nA: If you have a known-good power cable now, I'd try looking up \"reset PMU macbook\" and see if those instructions help at all. The PMU is a chip that governs the power management functions of the Mac, and if its settings get corrupt it could lead to a non-booting computer.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Management_Unit\n\nA: Another option you can do yourself it to reset the System Management Controller (SMC). \nThe list of power problems this can fix has enough overlap with your problems that it's likely worthwhile:\n\nPower\n  The computer doesn't respond to the power button when pressed.\n  A portable Mac doesn't appear to respond properly when you close or open the lid.\n  The computer sleeps or shuts down unexpectedly.\n  The battery does not appear to be charging properly.\n  The MagSafe power adaptor LED doesn't appear to indicate the correct activity.\n\n\nA: I am unsure that you can speak of 'bricking' your laptop in that fashion.

I'm looking to imitate the functionality of Firefox's keywords in Safari. That is, I want to be able to type wp Apple in the address bar, and Safari should go to the Wikipedia article on Apple. I found a Sourceforge project, SafariKeywords, which does just this, but it was last updated in 2004 and doesn't work on Intel-based Macs.\nDoes the latest version of Safari have this functionality built in and I just didn't find it, or is there something like SafariKeywords I can use, or is this just a feature I'll have to live without?\n\nA: I understand this is an older thread, but for the next person who comes along, I recommend taking a look at Safari Keyword Search. It is a Safari extension that adds exactly what you are looking for.\n\nA: I don't know if this is what you're looking, but this feature exists on Alfred. It's also on the Mac App Store.

Is it at all possible to change the time for saving drafts in Apple Mail? I use MobileMe and whenever I send an email, the draft doesn't get deleted automatically. I don't want to switch off saving of drafts, but would like to increase the time between saves. Since I don't need to save drafts for short emails.\n\nA: If you go into Preferences, Accounts, select your account, then select the \"Mailbox Behaviors\" tab, there's an option to disable saving drafts on the server. I know you said you didn't want to disable saving of drafts, but this option will still save the draft on your computer, yet it won't mess up Mobile Me.\n", "Q: How can I disable the Screen Saver on the login window? How can I disable the Screen Saver on the login window?\n\nA: You can edit the .plist file at /Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver either using a text editor, Plist Editor (requires the OS X Developer Tools) or the defaults command in Terminal to remove the screensaver at login window.\nLike this:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver loginWindowIdleTime 0\n\n\nA: It isn't possible to disable the login screensaver in Mountain Lion due to a bug. According to https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4540671?start=0&tstart=0 the best you can do is log into root's screensaver settings and change it to Message which uses less resources.\nSee https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/16515/21181 for how to do that.\n\nA: I believe this does the trick (at least it seems to have worked for mefor several hours now):\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver loginWindowIdleTime 0\n\nThis disables the screensaver in the loginwindow.\n\nA: For some reason I don't understand yet, the solution in the accepted answer didn't work for me. Below is an alternative method that actually did work for me.\nBefore doing anything, i noticed that a file called com.apple.screensaver.plist did not yet exist in /Library/Preferences/. But issuing the defaults -command as mentioned in the accepted answer created this file with correct loginWindowIdleTime-entry just fine. This was confirmed both with defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver as well as by manually confirming the files' existence and inspecting its' contents.\nHowever, it didn't seem to have any effect on the screensaver-behaviour in the Login Screen whatsoever.\nI then used a different approach that actually did work:\n\n\n*\n\n*I opened a command-prompt (Terminal window)\n\n*First I issued $ > sudo -s to become root\n\n*Then, as root, I started System Preferences: # > /Applications/System\\ Preferences.app/Contents/MacOS/System\\ Preferences\n\n*And finally I went into the Desktop and Screen Savers Preference-Pane to use the regular GUI to disable the screensaver timeout.\n\n\nThis did the trick for me.\nI'm wondering though, if the defaults-command perhaps did actually work fine already, just the changed plist-value wasn't picked-up (synced) yet by the (still running?) screensaver process…\n\nA: The problem is that the login screen is not the result of the screen saver, I lock my Mac when I go out. The screen saver appears by itself, even if it is disabled from SysPref.\n", "Q: Apple Mail incoming mail notification When you get a new mail in Entourage then a small window appears with some basic info about the new mail you receveid. Is it possible to do the same thing with Apple Mail?\n\nA: Try Growl and the GrowlMail plugin, simply click to view the message, and it's free! http://growl.info/\n\n\nA: I've used Mail.appetizer before and it was my favorite of all the mail notification apps I've tried.  It's not yet compatible officially with Snow Leopard, but there are development versions available that will probably work (link from their twitter account).\nNote that in recent versions of OS X, Mail requires that plugins list the specific versions of it that they support; they can't just say they're compatible with anything newer than a certain version.

You can review these steps in case they apply in your case. Not everyone sees this speed up, but it shouldn’t be hard to test and reverse if it doesn’t help you. Anyone on Mojave and newer should look to other fixes like testing a backup to a blank or erased drive.\nTime Machine ridiculously slow after El Capitan upgrade\nThe throttle should be evident in observing the backupd usage of the filesystem:\nsudo fs_usage backupd\n\nWriting a command to /etc/sysctl.conf and then restarting should disable that throttle:\necho 'debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nOr without restarting:\nsudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0\n\nYou'll want to watch for other performance issues (extra CPU usage, other IO slowing, increased energy usage when backing up) after making that low level system tuning adjustment.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the solution in this case was:\nFormat disk (lose old backups)\n\nNow the disk backs up at full speed.\n\nA: According to this thread:\nDelete the \"in progress\" folder on the TM drive and then things will operate at a normal speed.\nNote: That did not fix the problem in my case.\n\nA: You could try renaming the /.Spotlight-V100 folder on the TM volume.  I've never tried this but Spotlight is used to decide which files are new/changed since the last backup.  The only thing that comes to mind in reading your question, is maybe the index is broken and needs to be rebuilt, and TM in the mean time is running that search live, rather than indexed.\nLong shot.\n\nA: It could also be related to MRT process. For me, when I removed MRT process, backup speed becomes normal. By the way, MRT is sth called malware remove tool which comes with the security update and it will take lots of CPU to do scanning work. There are some articles on how to remove it.\n\nA: Add the Time Machine disk to the Privacy list of Spotlight (in System Preferences) so that Spotlight does not spend time accessing that drive.\n\nA: Fragmentation\nIn my experience, it's very common for the catalog B-tree to become very fragmented.

Is it possible to create a wikipage in this manner on stackexchange? \n\nA: Well-built applications (hopefully including most of Apple's own apps) should be self-documenting -- Apple recommends that developers include a preference manifest inside each application that describes the preference keys they use (including their names, data types, descriptions, reasonable default values, etc).\nTo view an app's manifest, right-click (or control-click) on the app, and select Show Package Contents; then open Contents/Resources, and look for a file or folder named after the app's bundle id with a \".manifest\" suffix (e.g. Safari's is in a sub-bundle, so it's actually in Safari.app/Contents/Resources/com.apple.safari.manifest/Contents/Resources/com.apple.safari.manifest).\nThe manifest file is itself in .plist format, and may be a little hard to ready by hand, but if you look for the name values listed under <key>pfm_name</key>, you should find what you're looking for.\n\nA: As far as I know the answer to your question is \"no\".\nFor any given software you can use defaults read to get whatever options are set, but if there are default options that are not set, you won't see them.\nBlacktree Secrets is building a DB of defaults commands (which modify app plists). \n\nA: Manifest Destiny is a site used to track Manifest (option) files for apps.\n", "Q: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Tool to Convert Pictures or Images to Text I have scanned text.

I'm afraid I may have irreversibly harmed my internal speakers, or sound system in general.\nYesterday, I was trying to find a way to hook up my electric guitar to the computer. I, logically, thought that going through my amp and running the amp to the macbook line-in was the best course of action.\nWhat came through my external speakers was just muffle-ly cracked noise that were very unstable sounding.

I have an app that's been out for a couple of weeks. Its not exactly selling like hot cakes yet, but I'm pretty sure I've gotten a rating or a review by now. But nothing shows when viewing either in iTunes or directly on the AppStore on the iPhone.\nIs there a standard delay as to when ratings/reviews show up, that Apple imposes, especially for new apps? Or do you think there is some problem with Apple's system?\n\nA: My experience is there is a fairly big delay in reviews showing up - but I would expect even the first review to get published within a month of posting should other ratings and reviews arrive for that app to separate it from an app that has less than 100 downloads ever.\nI don't know for sure, but the ratings seem to be held back until 10 or 20 are submitted. Once you reach that limit the store will show the overall rating and only new versions get ratings once they hit their threshold (but a message stating not enough ratings are in to show).\nIt makes sense for users to expect a few points before any app gets zero or five stars and makes the ratings a useful measure that some handful of people expressed an opinion before they are shown.\nAfter hearing about the delays, I've sometimes checked and my experience with about 50 reviews where I cared to check back, the shortest time was about 24 hours and the longest was 2 weeks for a review to appear. I've not had one not eventually get published, but I also don't generally review apps that have hundreds of reviews which is much harder to find your needle in the haystack of other reviews. I generally star those apps or write something and not bother to check if it ever made it live.\n\nA: From a users standpoint, you only see reviews from the app store/country you are logged into. I have accounts on the China, US and NZ app stores, and notice significantly more reviews on the American and Chinese sites than the NZ one (unsurprisingly I might add). Perhaps you are logged in to an app store with less users/less likely to have reviews?\nMaybe you can link us to you app so we can have a look at it. Good luck.\n\nA: All these answers seem well enough, but I've made shining, 5 star reviews in the past (in America, with games I've bought and am logged into) that have yet to appear.  In the meantime, the illiterate smeghead who's dropped F-bombs every other word... he has 19 reviews showing, all made in the last 2 weeks.\nI am more willing to believe that they're just waiting for a grouping of reviews, rather than reviewing reviews for viewable content.\nIt all seems disorganized to me.  I don't think the employess hired to improve this process have any real idea what they're doing.\n\nA: I know that they wait for a set number of ratings before displaying, and I imagine that reviews are subject to moderation.\nThese things might be especially true for new apps/developers.\n", "Q: How do I read .CHM files in OS X? What software do I need to open and read a .chm document in OS X?\n\nA: One of the best apps I've found is iChm. It has a Spotlight importer as well as the app itself.*  It's free as well as being open source.\nOnly issue I've had with it is that sometimes long \"m dashes\", like —, will not be present, and instead the two words will be run together. (Though, I've looked at the source code myself, and it appears to actually be a problem with libchm, the open source library that iChm relies on).\n*NOTE: the version of iChm in the link above (1.4.2) does not have a Spotlight importer, but I've forked this project on GitHub and added a Spotlight importer in version 1.5.

But these days, your problem boils down to sharing the raw files for the music, and adding the directory containing those files to iTunes.  Probably you're interested in the functionality of iTunes so that it can automatically \"discover\" music that has been added to a directory.  I think that exists, but I haven't used it do far, so I don't know the details.\nIf some of your music is older and has access restrictions on it, then you have a bigger issue to work around.

The quality of my PowerBook and 20\" Cinema Display screens has degraded over time, they became noticeably yellowish and darker due to the wear of the backlight (I assume). Neither of those screens is LED-backlit. I'm wondering, how do the LED-backlit screens used in current Apple products degrade over time? Do they similarly become yellowish, give less light, ...? How long does it take for the effect to become obvious, or what's the expected life time of these screens?\n\nA: This Engadget article shows photos of a direct comparison:\n\nStanding in front of the white-LED backlight on the new MBP, it's immediately apparent how crisp the whites are -- it's very noticeable after staring into CCFL LCDs all day long. But even though the whites were whiter, the screen didn't necessarily seem a lot brighter, which is probably where some amount of CCFL dimming on our test MBP came into play in creating the dramatic difference we saw. Viewing angles were very similar on both machines, but as you'll notice, at half brightness it's the LED backlit MBP that's dimmer, and the CCFL display that's actually brighter. Interesting stuff.\n\nAlso interesting could be the Advantages and Disadvantages sections of the Wikipedia article on LEDs (link):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Slow failure: LEDs mostly fail by dimming over time, rather than the abrupt failure of incandescent bulbs.\n  \n*Lifetime: LEDs can have a relatively long useful life. One report estimates 35,000 to 50,000 hours of useful life, though time to complete failure may be longer. Fluorescent tubes typically are rated at about 10,000 to 15,000 hours, depending partly on the conditions of use, and incandescent light bulbs at 1,000–2,000 hours.\n  \n\n\nA: I've had my 2007 MBP17 backlights replaced a couple times. \nWith that model, you could place downward pressure on the closed device. That apparently causes blobby regions of the backlight to appear overtly grayer. I carried my MBP17 in a padded backpack with stuff in it that compressed the unit while carrying. Whoops.\nAnother failure mode I saw was the backlighting dimmed in largely vertical areas; text over at the top-left of the panel and below over time became harder to read. The effect is considerably less obvious than the first problem.\n(Normally, the screen center looks brightest and the edges look a little dimmer, but I can see the left side of the screen as brightly as the center by moving my head to the left. When it doesn't seem a little brighter by doing that, you may have a backlight issue.) \nThere may be other failure modes, these are the ones I've seen. For me, the degradation is slow and involved areas of the backlight becoming less bright.\n", "Q: Disabling default keyboard on iPad with iOS 4.2 I have enabled 3 languages and use their keyboards, but the default keyboard still insists on popping up.

I have a Mac Pro from late 2007, early 2008 and I want to perform a clean install but nothing comes up on my monitor. The graphics card is an NVIDIA GT 120 and the hard drive is an Intel SSD. I am assuming the graphics card is the problem but all comments point to it being supported. \nHow do I do a clean Snow Leopard install with the given hardware?\n\nA: The Apple NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 Graphics card is not compatible with the 2007/2008 Mac Pro, so in order to do the fresh install you will want to remove the GT 120 and re-install a compatible graphics card that will work with the 2007 / 2008 generation of Mac Pro.\nAs noted on Amazon the following system requirements are noted for the Apple NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 Graphics card.\n\nProduct Features\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Requires Mac Pro (Early 2009 with 1066MHz DDR3 memory) with PCI Express 2.0 slot\n  \n*Requires Mac OS X v10.5.6 or later\n  \n\n\nA: You have to keep the stock video card in the first slot, and the new one in the second slot, then OS X should boot because it senses the EFI patched video card and allows you to see it.\n\nA: If you have reset the NVRAM to clear the device tree and let the mac have the best chance to run the installer, you still have some options to resolve this.\n\n\n*\n\n*A newer retail OS X DVD should\nhave the original and updated\ndrivers to drive that monitor\n(making a failure more likely\nhardware and less of a driver\nquestion) than the DVD that originally shipped with that model.\n\n*Taking the drive (or the whole Mac) to a shop that has all the boot images and several retail OS DVD on hand might be needed.\n\n\nDeployStudio running on another mac has saved my day more times than I can count. Their boot loader is quite up to date - the closest to a universal image as I have seen. If that fails, you may have to resort to installing an OS to the drive connected to another mac in target mode or by a dongle for SATA drives.\n", "Q: ASP & PHP Web Server on OS X On Windows, I ran Xampp on port 80 for PHP/MySQL and IIS on port 8080 for ASP.\nFor OS X, what's the best route to take...\n\n\n*\n\n*Should I just run Xampp for Mac for PHP/mySQL, or is there a better option since this is Unix?\n\n*What's the best (free) way to run ASP off a mac?\n\n\nA: I've never used it any of them, but there is a port of Mono for Mac that allows you to run ASP.NET on the Mac, and as other users answered there is XAMPP for Mac also.\nhttp://www.mono-project.com/Mono:OSX\n\nA: Mono works relatively well, but some sites built using ASP require Windows-only components (like Windows Forms) that it can't support. I was able to build it but it took some time and hand editing of various dependencies and make files.\nAs for PHP/MySQL, you do have them already in Mac OS X. You may need to do a bit of leg work to get them working together as you'd like. MAMP and EMAMP are ok, but I almost always run into gotchas when I use them.

Also, this would enable me to verify if the app already exists in the App Store of my main account and buy/download it from there. \n\nA: In iTunes you can simply right click the app in question and choose Get Info. On the summary tab you can see the account used to purchase the app.\n\n\nA: I would log in to each account and check your purchase history. That seems like the most direct way to me. This Apple article has details on how to do this.\n", "Q: iPhone apps think they are under old iTunes username after it has changed Ever since apple has decided to make iTunes account access your email address instead of a username I have noticed the apps that were bought under the old username do not recognize this and there doesn't seem to be a simple way to fix this. For example when an app has an update it asks me to enter my old username/pw combo, however if I make a new purchase and then it has an update the new email/pw info is displayed. This more of an inconvenience than anything, but the other day I was trying to make and in-app purchase and the new email/pw dialog displayed for an app I purchased with the username/pw and the transaction would not go through saying I needed to purchase the app first. Is there an easy way to fix this?\n\nA: Have you tried removing the app from iTunes and and the iOS device and then downloading them again? iTunes should see that you had already bought it and just downloads it.\nThis way I changed some apps when I got the iOS device from my girlfriend, which were bought with her account.\n\nA: Was your old username linked to your current email address? \nSupposing the two aren't linked, there isn't an easy way around this, although you might try contacting Apple support to see if they can transfer those purchases to your account. I've had luck doing this before when an album I purchased was link to the wrong account.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Emptying trash of the USB drive I have a USB drive plugged into my Mac. What I found was .Trashes was not emptied when the emptying trash (right click the Trash icon and run \"Empty Trash\") for the USB drive\nWhat might be wrong? Is there any other way to empty trash the USB drive? \n\nA: I don't know wether it's the best answer, but at least it's working answer.\nOpen the command line, cd to the USB volume (/Volumes/USB for my case), and type:\n/bin/rm -rf ./Trashes/* works fine with me.\n\n\nA: It's possible that there are files in some other user's trash.  The .Trashes folder at the top of each volume has subfolders for each different user, by user ID number (e.g. user 502's trash is in .Trashes/502).\nYou can see if it for yourself using a command like this (replace VolumeName with your drive name):\nls -la /Volumes/VolumeName/.Trashes/\ntotal 0\nd-wx-wx-wt@  3 _unknown  _unknown   102 10 Feb 18:15 .\ndrwxrwxrwx@ 21 root      wheel      782 13 Feb 14:17 ..\ndrwx------@ 35 _unknown  _unknown  1190 13 Feb 14:18 502\n\nNote: you might get a permissions error from this command, either because the .Trashes folder doesn't allow read access (solve this by adding sudo, e.g. sudo ls -ls ..., and entering your admin password when requested); and/or because of the privacy protections in macOS Mojave (10.14) and later (solve this by granting the Terminal access in System Preferences > Security & Privacy pane > Privacy tab > Full Disk Access category, see here for more details).\nAs you can see, on my USB disk .Trashes folder there's a sub foder called 502, owned by user ID 502 (for reference, my current user ID is 501). Since this user doesn't exist on my system, I see it as _unknown, and my user can't look inside of it, neither delete it.  To look inside that folder we need to do it as administrator (i.e. use sudo).\nIf you are sure that you want to, you can delete everyone's trash by deleting the entire .Trashes folder with a command like:\nsudo rm -R /Volumes/volumeName/.Trashes\n\nWarning: as with anything involving sudo (\"do as super user\", i.e. system administrator) and rm -R, use this carefully. If you type it wrong, it could have ... unpleasant consequences.\n\nA: 2 Solutions. 1 using Bash the other using Bash wrapped in AppleScript.\nSolution #1\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new AppleScript with /Applications/Utilities/AppleScript Editor\n\n*Type the following code:\n\ndo shell script \"rm -rf /Volumes/*/.Trashes/*\" with administrator privileges\n\n*Save the file to somewhere convenient and run it whenever you need to clear the USB Trash\n\n*This can be executed by double-clicking on it\n\n\nNOTE: This will empty the Trash for all connected volumes including your internal hard disk. If you have connected 5 USB drives and a Firewire hard disk, it will empty the trash for all of them.\n\nSolution #2\n\n\n*\n\n*Fire up your favourite text editor (mine is nano)\n\n*Paste the following code into your text editor and save the file\n\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo rm -rf /Volumes/*/.Trashes/*\n\n*Save the file to somewhere convenient with the extension .sh and then make it executable with chmod +x {filename}.sh from Terminal\n\n*Run that with ./{filename}.sh\nNOTE: Same note as above. This is executable from Terminal.\n\nA: I use this script AppleScript, save it as Application :\non open these_volumes\n    set t_id to user ID of (system info)\n    repeat with i in these_volumes\n        if (kind of (info for i without size)) is \"Volume\" then\n            set tPath to (POSIX path of i) & \".Trashes/\" & t_id\n            do shell script \"/bin/rm -Rf  \" & (quoted form of tPath) & \"/*\"\n        end if\n    end repeat\nend open\n\nDrag/Drop Volume(s) on the application.\nThis script removes the items from your trash (user ID) folder on the volume.\nif other users use the volume  this script will not delete the items from their  trash folder, otherwise the script would need an administrator password to do that.\n\nIf you want to eject the volume after emptying the trash, use this script.\non open these_volumes\n    set t_id to user ID of (system info)\n    set volToEject to {}\n    repeat with i in these_volumes\n        if (kind of (info for i without size)) is \"Volume\" then\n            set tPath to (POSIX path of i) & \".Trashes/\" & t_id\n            do shell script \"/bin/rm -Rf  \" & (quoted form of tPath) & \"/*\"\n            set end of volToEject to contents of i\n        end if\n    end repeat\n    if volToEject is not {} then tell application \"Finder\" to eject volToEject\nend open\n\n\nA: Usual behavior:\nWhen you delete something off a USB drive, it is moved to a .Trashes folder on that volume. When plugged into your computer, deleted items will appear in your trash bin with everything else.\nWhen you unplug it, items that you've deleted from that drive will no longer show up in your trash UNTIL you plug it in again. Then, you can empty the trash. It will really delete them from that drive.\nIf that isn't happening for you, here's my suggestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the drive in your Finder sidebar. \n\n*Without selecting anything else, press cmd-i (or use menu item File → Get Info). \n\n*Use the Sharing and Permissions section of that window to give Everyone the permissions to Read and Write.\n\n", "Q: Remove Specific Text from Multiple Descriptions I've recently upgraded to iPhoto '11 (couldn't resist the pricing on the new app store) and as I'm adding more meta-data to my library and generally organizing things (places, faces, etc... I hadn't upgraded since '08) I've noticed something odd in my photos.  Every photo in my library has a description (though many are short), but it would appear that somehow the description of one of the photos has been appended to many.\nI don't know if maybe I accidentally screwed up a batch change at some point in the past, or if the library upgrade somehow messed up, or what else may have happened.  But what I need to do is fix these somehow.\nNow, manually editing is something of a daunting task.  Within a library of 21,248 photos, 18,858 of them have this additional text.  The one thing I do have going for me is that it's a specific string.  If there's a way to \"remove this string from everywhere in the library without removing the rest of any given description\" then that would be perfect.\nIs there anything I can do like this?  Maybe even manually editing a library file in a text editor?  (Would that break anything else in iPhoto if its library was edited outside of the application, even while it's not running?)  Does anybody have any ideas?\n\nA: Consider using an AppleScript to perform this task. The following AppleScript will get you started:\ntell application \"iPhoto\"\n\n    repeat with i from 1 to number of items in photos\n\n        set myPhoto to item i of photos\n\n        set comment of myPhoto to replaceText(\"find this\", \"replace with this\", comment of myPhoto)\n\n    end repeat\n\nend tell\n\n-- replaceText from Bruce Phillips (http://brucep.net/2007/replace-text/)\non replaceText(find, replace, subject)\n    set prevTIDs to text item delimiters of AppleScript\n    set text item delimiters of AppleScript to find\n    set subject to text items of subject\n\n    set text item delimiters of AppleScript to replace\n    set subject to \"\" & subject\n    set text item delimiters of AppleScript to prevTIDs\n\n    return subject\nend replaceText\n\nTo use this AppleScript, copy and paste it into a new AppleScript Editor document.\nIn this situation, you want to find and remove a specific piece of text. Modify the above AppleScript as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the \"find this\" segment and enter the text to find.\n\n*Change the \"replace with this\" segment to be blank, \"\".\n\n\nWith these changes in place, save the document, and click Run in the toolbar. Depending on the number of photos, this AppleScript will take a long time; potentially hours.\n", "Q: How can I tell when Safari on iPad is using HTTPS Safari hides the protocol part of the URL (HTTP or HTTPS) in the address bar.\nWhen I'm purchasing something on the Internet, I like to check that I'm using HTTPS when entering credit card details or entering a username and password.\nI don't seem to be able to do this when using Safari on my iPad.\n\nA: There should be a padlock before the page title at the top of the screen when you're on an https page.\n\nA: On iPad 3 I touch the address bar to select then touch and hold to bring up the magnifying glass.

Anyone know of a good, reliable insurer for a MBP?\nI've read up on AppleCare but it doesn't include theft cover (as far as I can tell?)... I'd need this sort of cover as it's my major concern aside dropping it.\n\nA: AppleCare definitely doesn't cover theft. In fact, AppleCare doesn't even cover accidental damage like dropping it, spilling liquid on it, etc.\nThere are two companies that I hear about from other Mac users where the stories have been positive. Mind you I've never used either company so have no idea how their service is or anything.\nFor accidental damage plus the normal manufacturer's defect coverage provided by AppleCare I've heard good things about Square Trade. This is the company I've heard the most good about, but they don't provide theft coverage. Square Trade is available only in the United States and Canada.\nFor accidental damage plus theft (not clear if it covers standard warranty-type damage) I've heard some good about Safeware. I haven't heard as much about them, but a lot of folks have theft coverage through their homeowner's insurance or their renter's insurance, so not at many people need a separate policy. Safeware is available only in the United States.\n\nA: Do you have renters or home owners insurance? your broker may be able to track down a rider you can attach to those policies to provide specific coverage for a laptop. You may have to dance a bit if the device is used entirely for work at the work premises, or if it is work related for your home business.\n", "Q: How to set a Monospace Font for Dashboard Sticky Notes Widget? I would like to use a monospaced font on the Sticky Notes in Apple's Dashboard widget.\nHowever, only a few fonts can be selected, none of which is monospaced.\n\nA: This is possible, because widgets are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based. Here's how:\nFirst, go to /Library/Widgets and find the Stickies one. Copy it to ~/Library/Widgets and name it myStickies (or something else).\nClose the Stickies widget in Dashboard.\nNow, go to the myStickies.wdgt version you copied and right-click it. Choose Show Package Contents.\nIn the new window that appears, right-click on the Stickies.js file and open it with your favorite JavaScript editor (if you don't have one, TextWrangler is great and free).\nNow, use the editor to find the line var fontArray = new Array; (should be around line 407). You'll see below that line a bunch of lines similar to each other, saying something like fontArray[\"font name\"] = 1,. You want to copy the last one of those (American Typewriter), and paste it back below itself. Then, change it so it looks like this: fontArray[\"Courier New\"] = 8;\nSave and close this file.\nNow, open (from the same folder) Stickies.html in an HTML editor (TextWrangler works).\nFind the line that says, <select id='font-popup' class='popup' onchange='fontchanged(this);'> (should be about line 40).\nBelow that, you'll find a bunch of lines similar to each other, each beginning with <option value. Copy the one for Gill Sans, and paste it below itself.\nEdit it to say <option value =\"Courier New\">Courier New</option>.\nSave and close this file.\nOpen Terminal and type killall Dock. This restarts Dashboard.\nNow, double click the myStickies widget file you made. It will open in Dashboard. Follow the normal procedure of clicking the i and changing the font. You'll have a Courier option, and it will be that font. Yay!\n", "Q: With iLife 11, considerations of slide shows I have to turn a big stack of images into one of those somewhat sappy slide shows with music.\nGoogle shows various advice from various points in time. The last advice I found was iDVD. Is that the right path to launch off on?\n\nA: Nope, not at all. iPhoto has great slideshow capabilities.\nLots of examples on YouTube.\nNo need to involve DVDs; or slow, aging software like iDVD.\n\nA: iMovie has the \"Ken Burns\" effect (the actual name in the application!), designed specifically to do slow panning across images that dissolve into others, etc. It's very flexible and quite powerful.\niDVD is definitely not what you want. If nothing else, it hasn't actually been updated in years, and both iPhoto and iMovie significantly outshine it.\n", "Q: Is it possible to hide all theme related packages from Cydia? Cydia is spammed by too many skinning tweaks and it is real hard to browse for more interesting applications.\nDo you know a way to make Cydia hide the theme-related packages?\n\nA: Cydia > Sections > Edit\nTurn the toggle to \"Off\" next to the \"Theme\" sections.\n", "Q: Why does my Exchange account work on my iPhone, but not Mail.app? I can set up my work Exchange account just fine on my iPhone, but I can't get it to work on Mail.app under Snow Leopard.\nI have read some forums and understand that mobile devices use ActiveSync in order to access Exchange mail and I thought Snow Leopard introduced this feature to Mail, but I can't seem to get it working.\nI have tried just about every combination of settings I can think of.\nMy iPhone asks for a domain, but I can't find a similar setting in Mail. I have tried entering my username as domain/username to no avail.\nHas anyone had experience/similar problems with this?\n\nA: Most likely because your corporate exchange server is running Microsoft Exchange Server 2003. Snow Leopard now only connects to Exchange 2007 (See http://www.apple.com/macosx/exchange/) whereas Leopard used to connect to Exchange 2003 using the OWA mechanism.\niPhone supports both Exchange 2003, 2007 and 2010 it seems (See iPhone User Guide , page 2);\n\nA: I'd been struggling with the same issue for over a year. Finally I installed DavMail Gateway which is free. \nIt provides support for Exchange 2003 ( using OWA ). Using it you can even get support for LDAP directory services & even events in iCal!!\nSee page for details. Step-by-step instructions on:\nSetting up DavMail on OS X\nIMAP Mail setup\n\nA: Have you tried everything listed in this Apple doc?\n\nA: Try domain\\username. I've never seen a forward slash work to indicate a domain. Then again, I've never tried. Do you get any error messages?\n\nA: I've been having this problem with Exchange Server 2003 and Mail under Snow Leopard, and it's because the IMAP process on the server periodically dies.  This affects the Mail app on the computer and not the iPhone because, as another answer here mentions, the iPhone uses ActiveSync, while the Mail app on the computer relies on IMAP if it's not Exchange 2007 or newer.  Someone needs to log into the server and restart it.\nOne possible fix is here.\n\nA: AFAIK: Snow Leopard supports Exchange via Web Services (new in Exchange 2007). All mobile devices use ActiveSync (which is basically XML over long lived HTTPS sessions).\nUsing IMAP to check email on Exchange is fine (if enabled on server) but you lose calendar and contacts sync.\n", "Q: How do I get vim to work at 256 colors in iTerm? I just got a new iMac, and installed iTerm (0.10).\nOn my last laptop 256 color mode worked fine, but I'm having trouble getting this to work on my new Mac.\nI copied over all the settings, set $TERM to xterm-256color, but no dice.\nI changed my .vimrc to the absolute minimum to try this out:\nset t_Co=256\nsyntax on\n\nTried multiple colorschemes, too. \n\nA: OK, so...\nI just started vim again, and colors where there. Since then I did make a changehowever, I installed XCode. This is the only thing I did change, so there must be something in there that fixes this.\nThanks for the effort!\n", "Q: iphoto versus imovie - wanting to get features from both places Origami is very nice. However, detailed control is, in my case, very hard to live without. I am setting up a 10-minute slide show. I want to use several pieces of audio cued to different points in the show. I want to have some sections, and origama shuffles my pictures across the section boundaries. Even text slides don't clue it in that this might be a good place not to shuffle across. Some of my consumers find the plain 'Ken Burns' transition in imovie positively sea-sickness-inducing.\nI can predict that the answer will be that, inside iphoto, I'm in the traditional 'Steve Jobs is the reincarnation of Henry Ford' situation, and I won't be finding any way to exercise detailed control. So, can anyone give me a running start on how to introduce other transition effects to imovie?\n\nA: Versions of iMovie after iMovie HD don't support plugins and extra effects.\nYou're looking for something more along the lines of Apple Final Cut Express ($170) or Adobe Premiere Elements ($80).\nBoth let you make photo slideshows with titles, effects, transitions, and music; and both let you install free and paid plugins for more.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Synchronizing Gmail Contacts to my Mac How do I sync GMail contacts into my Mac?\n\nA: If you are using Mac OS X 10.5 or later, it's just a matter of enabling in in your Address Book:\n\n\n*\n\n*Address Book --> Preferences --> Accounts --> Synchronize with Google\n\n\nA: On most modern Macs (Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard) you simply open the Address Book (-,), click on Accounts tab, and then under the left column, select \"On My Mac (Local)\".\nThen click on the \"Synchronize with Google\" checkbox and enter your Google credentials, and voila! note that synchronising may have deleterious effects because of inherent problems with most sync systems. To be safe, I would back up either (or both) your Gmail and Address Book contants before proceeding. \nTo back-up your Address Book contacts go to File menu > Export… > Address Book Archive…\nYour Gmail contacts can be backed up in this way.\n", "Q: Is it really true that the iPhone doesn't have turn-by-turn navigation? I'm looking into getting a new Verizon smartphone. I like many things about the iPhone, but I'm concerned that I'll have to give up a feature I really like about my current phone--turn-by-turn navigation. According to this skattertech chart, the iPhone lacks this feature. Is there really not an \"app for that\"? (And if not, why? The phone has GPS, so what gives?)\n\nA: There are plenty of apps for that, especially in the US (where I'm not). There are the apps that mankoff suggests (I use TomTom here in NZ), but I think he left out the best value option: MotionX GPS Drive - they actually do a bunch of different applications, and all great value. Check them out.\nBTW, what phone are you using at the moment? What app are you most familiar with?\n\nA: There is an app for that. Look in the App Store. I think the going rate for the GPS apps (Navigon, TomTom, etc.) is about $50 USD.\nThe built-in Google Maps app does have turn-by-turn (it lists the turns you need to take), but it does not have a voice, and it does not recognize when you have deviated from the suggested route and then re-program itself.\n\nA: The thing is that the built-in Maps app uses Google Maps for the maps, and the Google Maps license doesn't allow a third-party to implement voice navigation using it. \nSo, Apple's Maps isn't allowed to implement voice navigation, but any other GPS software provider can offer the feature along with their own maps.\nHere is a nice review of some of the GPS software available for the iPhone: http://www.macworld.com/article/156720/2011/01/gps.html\nAlso, that situation could change, since Apple purchased a maps company a few years ago.\n\nA: The $50+ GPS apps usually include the maps in the download while the free/cheap ones download pieces of the map as required.  This is an issue if you are going to drive in areas with poor data coverage.  It's not a happy moment when your GSP doesn't have the necessary map section nd there's no reception to get it.  On the other hand, apps like TomTom (which I use) are huge (1.2GB) since they include the map so it takes up a pretty big chunk of space on your phone.\nWaze is a pretty fun app but is intended to help with local driving more than trip-based navigation.  Map accuracy is crowd-sourced so the quality is wildly variable and the routing software isn't designed for long-trips.  But it's a lot of fun to use.\nLive traffic usually requires a fee but it varies from product to product.\nAll the apps suck your battery dry at an alarming rate.  Power in the car is an absolute necessity.\n\nA: Yes its true no turn by turn navigation from Apple on the iPhone, etc. However, there are many good free solutions out there and paid as well. One free solution that work currently best for local area navigation is the free Waze gps app. Works good for local under 1 hour trips and provides free traffic re routing too. Has an interesting community aka social networking aspect to it as well. Just note that with this app you are best off copying address from the maps app to Waze to best begin navigation.\n", "Q: Peripherals with Great Mac Compatibility What peripherals do you use on your Mac that really work well? It seems like most things (especially mice and keyboards) don't work all that well, even if they claim compatibility. I'm looking for things that work as well on a Mac as they do on a PC.\nSo, community, what Mac peripherals do you use that 'just work', and work all the way?\nPlease post answers as wiki, as I'm not looking for a particular piece of hardware.\n\nA: Razer Mice\nMany of their mice are fully Mac-compatible (I use the Naga). Macro running and recording works perfectly, and they can be very complex (if you want). These are the only mice I've seen that work like this on a Mac.\n\nA: I'd like to know your background for the statement that \"most things (especially mice and keyboards) don't work all that well\"\nIn the 10+ years that I've been using Macs compatibility has been better than on PC.  Recently this has been excellent.\nFor cameras and printers (Epsom and Canon) I've never had to install drives for them to work with the OS, iPhoto or Image Capture.  Recently Image Capture has identified my old scanner and works better than Canon's own software at grabbing information from that.\nThe only peripherals I've had to install install software for are mice that have greater than the default number of buttons or esoteric functions (like wacom tablets).  And even then the basic functions worked out of the box.\nIn fact, these days, if a peripheral doesn't work out of the box on my Macs, then I get more than a bit worried that it'll cause me grief down the road - normally at the next OS update.\n\nA: Logitech Mice\nI have been very happy with high-end Logitech mice. In particular the VX.\n\nA: Matias Keyboards\nSpecifically the Tactile Pro. Designed to the same specs as the best keyboard Apple ever made. Worth ever penny.\n", "Q: How can I upgrade my jailbroken and unlocked iPhone 3GS to 4.2? I have an iPhone 3GS running on 4.0.1 and I want to upgrade it to 4.2 with my Mac.

I'm generally not a fan of iTunes for storing/listening to music (I use MediaMonkey). Is iTunes required for syncing between an iPhone and a PC?\n\nA: I know of no other solution to sync the handheld device. \nIf you want to get files on and off the device, you may be able to find tools/apps to help you. I've had to resort to a tool to get some audio and video content off of an iPod once that was loaded on someone else's machine; when you associate an iPod with a new machine, iTunes really wants to zap the contents, and I assume that may also be true with iPhone. \nAlso, the way some of that content is stored on the device may not be what you'd expect (files in a file system), it's more like cryptically named blocks of data in a database. But there are tools that can help you deal with the problem.\n\nA: I don't have an iPhone, but an app I stand by is Floola.

I'm seeking a Mac app for creating basic flowcharts and similar diagrams. \nGoogle has been no help; I've followed dozens of links to apps that either don't exist anymore, I can't find any real reviews of, or that won't run on OS X 10.6.6.\nWhat I'd really like:\n\n\n*\n\n*A simple and clean interface\n\n*Basic shapes\n\n*Automated connectors that stay linked as you move shapes around\n\n*Inexpensive, preferably under $30 but definitely under $50\nWhat I'm not looking for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hundreds of shapes \n\n*Default styles that have shadows and textures and such that I have to keep removing\n\n*Dozens of amazing features that allow you to automatically map databases and draw UML diagrams from code and such (I'm looking at you, Visio) that I have to constantly navigate around to make a few basic diagrams\n\n*A mind-mapping app with all the features such a thing entails, one that happens to also let you make basic diagrams\n\n*A full-fledged drawing app where, once again, I have to maneuver around a whole bunch of features and options to get to the basic functions I need.  (I have Illustrator, I love Illustrator, but it's crap for basic flowcharts and other simple diagrams.)\nI wouldn't actually use it for flowcharts, but rather basic similar diagrams to show data flow between apps, information flow in a company or other places, that kind of thing.\nI recently found out that the drawing portion of Google Docs actually does a pretty good job with the types of diagrams I need to create, but the UI is pretty poor and it obviously requires a constant net connection.\n\nA: For free online diagramming there's diagrams.net, which I am a developer on. It supports the automatic connection and dragging of components you're looking for. Also, it's free (and open source), which meets your under $30 requirement.\nThere is also a Desktop version available.\n\nA: I know this is an older thread, but I would like to throw in my $.02 (since things have changed some since this was posted). Lucid Chart for Google Apps is a viable solution. It is free for basic diagramming, and there are very reasonable pricing for more advanced features. It even has the capability to open (and save) Visio documents. It is integrated with Google Drive (for personal OR Apps Domains) and is real-time collaborative. Google Docs, of course, has a Drawing tool, but Lucid expands on it with some drag-n-drop features and other more advanced tools you would expect from fat-client apps. more information can be found on their website but if you search in the Chrome Web Store, you will find it and can install it directly from there. At that point it is as simple as logging into Google Drive and clicking Create and selecting Lucid Chart as the document type.\n\nA: Apple's Keynote may primarily be for presentations, but its diagramming tools also hit all your requirements: simple interface; polygons of arbitrary number of sides; connection lines (select two shapes, right click, \"Add Connection Line\"); cost of USD$20.\nAs a bonus, you'll have great presentation software to show off your cool new diagrams.\n\nA: Take a look at the free and simple to use yEd, I believe this would fit about right for your 2 yr old question :)  \n\nA: If you can stretch your budget, get OmniGraffle for Mac. At $149, it's pricier than you'd like (do you possibly qualify for the $89.99 edu price?), but it's exactly what you're looking for.\nOn the lower end there's Mindcad Incubator for $10.99, but I haven't tried it myself and I'm not sure it does everything you want.\n\nA: Would MindNode fit what you're looking for?\nThere's a free version and and $20 version available. They're both on the Mac App Store.\n\nA: I love Gliffy. It's free and very user-friendly.\n\nA: You also have several proposals from another SO thread here.\nOmniGraffle won the competition but the other links are quite interesting and could fit your needs.\n\nA: Give Xmind a try. It's Java, so expect a Java applications… if you know what that means.\nBut given that you haven't found OmniGraffle very \"attractive\" for you, you might want to give it a try.\n\nA: There is new diagramming tool Diagrammix in the Mac App Store. Simple and beautiful. \n\nA: I see you that you need to draw flowchart with basic shapes and grids. I would recommend a web based solution since you are not always using it. But if you are drawing flowcharts frequently I suggest you to get an flowchart software like Creately. There is a mac version available and you can try for free \n\n\n*\n\n*Creately has an improved interface  and I can assure you that it is very user friendly powerful and simple.\n\n*Yes, Creately supports 1000's shapes since there are more than 50 diagrams types made available to use. And you can customize to use the ones you want to use frequently as well.\n\n*Creately has what you call (smart connectors) that can automatically connect shapes by identifying the position of the shape and the connector type it requires.\n\n*You can edit change / add different styles and improve your diagrams with creately as you want. \n\n*Its a fully fledged diagram designing application made for diagramming mainly focused on the design and use. It has specific features for each diagram type.\n\n*Perfection is the word for the diagrams you design from creately. Further more there are many templates and examples to be used to create instant diagrams.\n\n*Price is under 50$ as you mentioned and the whole package is worth it. You can always try be for you buy.  \n\nA: You can take a look at MyDraw (https://www.mydraw.com), which has versions for Mac and Windows. It costs 69USD and is in your budget. MyDraw has thousands of shapes for different diagramming scenarios (flowcharts, OrgCharts, UML, mindmaps etc.) and is packed with enterprise features like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Import and export to Microsoft Visio.  \n\n*Highly interactive, fast and modern User Interface that is Visio like.\n\n*Support for embedding barcodes (and soon charts, gauges and tables) in drawings.\n\n*Export to vector formats like SVG, PDF, WMF and DXF (Autocad).\n\n*Export to raster formats like BMP, PNG, JPEG and other.\n\n\n\nDisclosure: I work for Nevron\n\nA: The Google Docs suite of tools now has a diagramming tool that lets you create flowcharts. While not as feature rich as something like OmniGraffle, it does cover all your requirements: simple & clean interface, basic shapes (and not an overabundance of shapes), automatic connectors with elasticity, and it meets your price point at free.\nCertainly can't hurt to try it out before you drop $100 on the Mac Daddy of diagramming programs for Mac.\nEdit: just noticed your last paragraph in your question. Not much I can do about the UI, but I will mention that offline support is about to make a return via Chrome.\n\nA: I found another one. Seems to meet all your prerequisites.\nShapes\n\nShapes is a simple, elegant Graphing and Diagramming app for Mac OS X Snow Leopard. Shapes gives you all of the most important features you need in a Diagramming tool without all the extra cruft, and without breaking the bank.\n\n\nA: Dia is pretty useful. From the description: \"Dia is a program to draw structured diagrams\". Available for Linux, Windows, OS X.\n\nA: GraphViz\nThe link above is to a GUI wrapper to the command line utility. With GraphViz, layout is automated, so you don't get to choose exactly where the nodes end up, although you can provide hints and have some limited control.\nRegarding your other points:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is CLI, so I think that counts as a simple and clean interface\n\n*Basic shapes are provided\n\n*Connectors are automated and will stay linked (although you can't move shapes with a mouse).\n\n*Free.\n\n\nA: I'm late to the party, but NeoOffice's drawing tool meets your four criteria.\n\n\nA: How about pencil? This is for fast prototyping.\n\nA: iPlotz\n\niPlotz allows you to rapidly create clickable, navigable mockups and wireframes for prototyping websites and software applications.\nCreate a project, add wireframe pages with design components and discuss your creations with others.\n\n\nA: IHMC CmapTools is very good. You have to register for it but it is free to use and can run on all major OSes.\n\nA: Your best solution is probably Inspiration. There's a free trial version available you can try out.\n\nA: Since what you're asking for is an extremely simple to use program without advanced features and lots of shapes, I suggest Delinieato, available through the Mac App store. Delineato gets ideas out of your head and onto the screen with a few clicks. It includes specifically the features you asked for, simple shapes, easy to use connectors, connectors that flow with the shapes as you move them around the screen. Delineato also has an infinite sized canvas, allowing you to shift things around and expand ideas as neccessary.\nBest of all, it's under $10 on the App Store for the full version.\n\nA: Well, I read all the posts and tried several of these apps, as I was also looking for a flowchart tool.\nGo for Pencil (thanks Sangcheol Choi) It's amazing yet simple. Yes, it has a lot of shapes, but it also has a very intuitive search tool, and the MEANING of each of them, which many other apps don't have.... Sometimes, that's very useful, at least for people who do not deal with flowcharts every day, so we are not sure about the meaning of some less used shapes....\n\nA: Lovely Charts:\nA diagramming application that allows you to create professional looking diagrams of all kinds, such as flowcharts, sitemaps, business processes, organisation charts, wireframes and many more....\nA cross-platform desktop application that is available for Linux, Mac & Windows, as well as an online edition & iPad edition compliments its versatility.\nThis is a Premium application and the price varies depending upon which version who choose to purchase.\n\nA: I'm really liking Gliffy. I'm a long-time user of Graffle and have tried a number of the other suggestions on this page. Graffle is great except for one crucial, deal-killing problem - it's orthogonal connecting line algorithm is terrible. I have to manually redraw lines almost anytime I move anything.\nGliffy is completely intuitive - everything pretty much does what I expect it to, and there are nice keyboard shortcuts for most things. I'd like to see symmetrical resizing (hold down option like in Graffle) so I don't have to re-center every time I resize a box, but that's a niggle.\nThe one feature I'd really like that none of these programs seems to have is the ability to expand or collapse a process block to reveal the flowchart of what's in the box. MacFlow under Mac OS9 used to do this, and it was wonderful: double-click a box and a new page would open, where you could flowchart the \"nested\" process. Close that window and the chart is hidden, but still there underneath whenever needed. Boxes with nested flowcharts had a bold border around them to let you know.\n\nA: The ProcessOn diagram platform is completely free, and includes a drawing application that is actually fairly useable for creating diagrams and flowcharts at the simpler end of the scale.\n\nA: Try Describio (https://www.describio.com). You can create runnable flowcharts using either the user interface or JavaScript (if you know how to code). You can also use user inputs to help control the flow. It's a more-advanced tool, but it's very useful for creating working prototypes. Check it out!\n\nA: Why does nobody mention the excellent diagramming app - ConceptDraw?\nIf you're familiar with Microsoft Visio, this one is absolutely your choice. The only one problem is that it's more expensive than what you expect.\nHope you can have a trial and consider my recommendation.\n\nA: You can actually do a lot of flowcharting stuff with Google Docs too. It depends on whether you're willing to pay for something or not. There's a good mix of both paid and free flowcharting software on Mac here.\n\nA: You can try Edraw Flowchart for Mac. It's an all-purpose diagram software with all flowcharting shapes. I suggest it to you because I found it one of the greatest diagramming tools after I tried some. It has a simple and elegant interface that you will feel comfortable to work on. It also includes templates that you can choose from. If you are a student, you just pay half price. These are its main features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatic connection.\n\n*Basic shapes.\n\n*Vector Drawing\n\n*Templates and Examples.\n\n*Export to PDF, JPEG, PNG, Word, PPT, Html, PS, Visio, etc.\n\n*Cloud collaboration.\n\n*Cross-platform\n\n*Support 260+ kinds of diagrams.\n\n*Add hyperlink, attachment, note and comment.\n\n*Support large flowchart and multiple pages drawing.\n\n\n\n\nA: Try yEd, it's free and very good.\n", "Q: Transfer video from iPhone to Mac without cable? I'm at my job and I have no cable, so connecting my iPhone with my computer is not possible. \nI have tried emailing the video, but the iPhone is compressing the video. It is not jailbroken.\nIs it possible to transfer the original video?\n\nA: Emailing full resolution photos or videos\nOn your iPhone open your camera roll and navigate to the overview screen where all your recent captures are shown via small square icons. Press and hold on the icon for the video you wish to move to your computer and select copy from the pop-up menu that appears.\nStill on your iPhone open Mail and create a new message. In the body of the message, press and hold the cursor, and select paste from the pop-up menu. The message you send will now have the full, unadulterated video attached which you can download on your desktop.\nNote: on my iPhone 4 I created a 4 second clip with very little motion and it used 6 MB. You may hit your attachment limit very quickly depending on length and resolution.\n\nA: Use the Dropbox app. This lets you sync a large video wirelessly without worrying about file-size limits imposed by other messaging techniques (like email).\n\nA: You can transfer video from iPhone to Mac in 3 different ways:\n1. transfer over cloud servers\n2. transfer over LAN\n3. transfer over WiFi\nThis iPhone file manager app can help you transfer files from iPhone to Mac by using above 3 ways easily: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ifile-pocket/id690442933?mt=8\n", "Q: How do split panes in Terminal work? I tried to open a split pane to run another command but instead it displays the same in both panes and I can only interact with one of them. I thought it would split the view so I could use the two panes independently like two windows.\nI have the Visor installed but I don't think it would interfere.\nTerminal - version 2.1.1\nVisor custom (84d1873) based on 1.5\n\n\nA: It's meant to be like that. See this Super User answer:\n\nYou're misinterpreting the feature. It's not meant for two separate\n  terminals. It's intended to allow a\n  user to see two different view points\n  in the same terminal. For instance, if\n  you have 3000 files in a directory,\n  and you perform an ls command, that\n  output is going to be very long.\nIf you use the split pane, you can\n  scroll through that long output\n  without having to flip back and forth,\n  possibly losing your place along the\n  way.\nIf you want two terminals, use tabs,\n  or separate windows.\n\nI would add that, for two separate terminals, you can use separate tabs as well.\n\nA: You should really have a look at screen (that´s an already installed command line tool, not a separate application), which gives you the ability to split your Terminal into two (or more) separate ones. I use that with Visor and it works like a charm. Have a look around here, there are quite a few tips on how to use \"screen\" on a Mac.\n\nA: Also don't over look tmux. Its like screen but more features I believe.\n\nA: iTerm 2 supports split panes with independent shells in each pane, not one linked shell.\n\n", "Q: Switching two MacBook motherboards I have two similar MacBooks that are off by one revision:\n\n\n*\n\n*Black: Model 2,1 --- 2.16 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo, 2GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM\n\n*White: Model 3,1 --- 2.2 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo, 1GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM\nI want to upgrade my Black macbook (my primary laptop) with 4GB of RAM but model 2,1 can only make use of around 3GB (3,1 can take 4GB).\nSo what I want to do is swap the motherboards of each laptop. That way they both get an upgrade -- the Black Macbook moves up to 4GB and the white moves up to 2GB.\nIs doing a motherboard swap on my own feasible? I've built my own desktops in the past and I'm not worried about what is what and what goes where. I'm just wondering about the difficulty of the job and/or if there's something I don't know about that would prevent this from working at all.\nOh yeah and also, from an aesthetic perspective I like the black one much more and don't want to just make the white one my primary laptop. It looks pretty worn and the girlfriend put some stickers on it, etc.\n\nA: You can check out the directions on iFixit here.\nThere are a lot of steps, but none of it is really rocket science. They explain it in detail.\nMy bigger question would be whether the two boards are compatible.\nBased on the specs for each one (2,1 / 3,1), the main differences are (respectively):\n\n\n*\n\n*Processor: TS7400 / TS7500\n\n*Video Card (integrated): Intel GMA 950 / IntelGMA X3100\n\n*VRAM: 64MB / 144MB\n\n\nI'm not sure how these effect logic board compatibility, but I'd be careful.\nAlso worth noting that the white 3,1 actually supports 6GB of memory (unofficially). Get it here.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How do I tell what processes are driving I/O loads? Something is driving a lot of Disk I/O on my system lately. I can see in ActivityMonitor that there are huge volumes of reads and writes every second. But none of the \"normal\" suspects are active when this is happening. (i.e. it's not time machine.) and I have plenty of free memory (800MB to 1.3GB out of 6GB total) so it shouldn't be paging. I don't see any apps in top that are blocked on I/O when this starts. (once it's going then I see things start to pile up... but everything I see in there appears to be victim.)\nWhat tools can I use to get a sense for what process is causing the disk io?\nI think it started with 10.6.6. :( I don't recall ever hitting this with 10.6.5.\n\nA: Try sudo iosnoop; it shows I/O as it happens, including the process ID and process name doing the I/O, as well as data size, file path, etc.  There are options to restrict it to only show a certain device, mount point, process, etc.\n\nA: On *nix systems lsof is used for checking to see what app has what file open. It's a good starting point for digging around.\nType man lsof at the commend line to see if its description sounds useful.\nAlso, open the \"console\" app, or tail -f some of the /var/log files that show a lot of activity, and see if something is broken or complaining. \n", "Q: Use internal speakers with others plugged into headphones jack I have a set of surround speakers, connected to my iMac through the headphone jack. I use a switch to control what goes to the speaker set (iMac, iPod, or MacBook/aux). So that I don't have to be constantly unplugging and replugging, I leave the audio cable in the iMac's audio port. This means that when I'm listening to something from another source, I can't hear anything from the iMac unless I unplug the cable.\nIs there a way to force sound to come out of the internal speakers, even if there's something in the audio out port?\n\nA: There is a way to do this but it is difficult and probably not for every user. What happened is Apple does have a \"hardware\" switch built in, which sends a signal to disable/enable the internal speaker. Because Windows or other OS simply doesn't have such function built in, it will just be a weird signal that does nothing.\nOption 1\nI cannot disable this signal, it probably requires some highly skilled kext modifier, but I found a way to reset the internal speaker after it gets disabled. It will not stick after a reboot, so you have to do it every time after the booting.\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your AppleHDA.kext in /System/Library/Extensions/\n\n*Show package content of this file, go to Contents/Plugins then remove AppleHDAHALPlugIn.bundle.\n\n*Reload the kext by running\nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext\nsudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext\nps aux | grep 'coreaudio[d]' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs sudo kill\n\n\n*Recover the backup file AppleHDA.kext (or your computer won't boot next time you reboot).\nNote, if you unplug the headphone, it will still show in your audio device panel. Tested working on a retina iMac. Not working on a retina Macbook (no audio afterward).\n\nOption 2\nI have a better way to do this (this method no longer works for 10.12.x+).\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the following files:\nhttps://mega.co.nz/#!js4gmZbI!xNFCxGT5zPYCS8RLtxk4xZQxNk0oP2sH8RjXbBqgmE0\nhttps://mega.co.nz/#!ulw13BzD!Y1k564bTSxZrePpPL-si5h65XULwnYeEMwH-l0lSLfI\n\n*Open up the first download, and drag the second download into it. It will take 10 minutes to install. Then restart your system.\nYou will not have line out and internal speakers both in your sound panel at all time, even when your headphone is not plugged in.\nTested on macOS 10.11, iMac Retina and not working on MacBook Pro Retina.\n\nA: Pretty sure it can't be done with the built-in headphone jack. What you could try is getting a USB soundcard (one example, but there are lots out there for $20 or so) to plug your headphones into. That should give you two options in the sound preferences.\nPS, if you option-click the speaker icon in the menu bar, you get a quicker way to swap inputs/outputs than going to the sound preference pane every time.\n\nA: Just found a solution that works or me - I use an HDTV as an additional monitor, and with headphones plugged in there I can route the audio to the external monitor. I can now switch between iMac speakers and headphones without unplugging the headphones.\n\nA: I have been trying to get this to work. After moving from my Mac Pro which has speakers and headphones plugged in and I simple switched between them (and even internal speakers) to a new iMac where I have to keep unplugging the headphones to get sound through the iMac speakers. What I'm about to order is a simple USB Sound Card dongle. Small thing that gives an audio jack via a usb, this should then allow me to alt+click the volume icon and switch between built in and headphones as it will see them as separate outputs.\n\nA: There's no supported way to override the switch that deactivates the internal speakers when a headphone jack is detected on 2011 through 2015 era hardware. The answer on modifying kernel extensions is amazing though if you like experimenting.\nThe switch that detects whether a 3.5mm headphone jack or mini-toslink is inserted removes the internal speaker from the sound control panel. (Probably at a low enough level that the OS itself cannot over-ride this control.)\nSince there isn't a widely known firmware hack, OS hack or hidden preference to disable this detection, you will need to add a USB to headphone device to avoid losing your internal speaker option while a headphone is plugged in.\n\n*\n\n*Griffin iMic\nAs long as you don't plug into the Apple port, you can switch amongst the internal and all other output sources using the normal tools (or whatever third party software option you prefer)\n\nA: I use Boot Camp to run Windows 7 on my iMac 27\" mid-2011.  When in the Windows mode I have the choice of internal speakers or headphone jack in my audio output, even although I the headphones permanently plugged into the headphone jack.  So Windows have it solved  how come Mac can't - after all it's all the same hardware!\n\nA: You can upgrade to a more recent Mac model. Later Macs that come with the Apple T2 chip treat the headphone jack and the internal speakers as separate devices. For a list of Macs with T2 chip, see the support article “Mac models with the Apple T2 Security Chip.”\nMacs with M1 chip can also use the 3.5mm headphone jack and built-in speakers simultaneously.\n\n\nA: You can change the audio (output and input) directly on the Sounds Preference panel.   There's an output tab that includes a selector for selecting the output.\n\nIf you want something a bit more convenient I used a free program called Audio Switcher from Spike Software.  It sits in the task tray and offers quick access to the same settings you see in the Sound Preferences pane.\n\nA: A faster way to do what @rwr suggested is to option click on the audio icon in the menu bar and select Internal Speakers under Output.\n\n\nA: The switch that is used is hardware based, so no way to override it except with an audio USB device, or: bluetooth speakers!\n", "Q: Windows 7 reports mDNSResponse.exe caused a problem with Bonjour Windows 7 Action Ceenter reports: \n\nAddress a problem with Bonjour\nBonjour has stopped working properly.\nThe name of the file that caused this\n  problem is mDNSResponse.exe. \nFor information about possible\n  solutions to this problem, go online\n  to the following Knowledge Base (KB)\n  article:\nClick to go online to the Apple Inc. website for the KB article\n\nWhen clicked, the browser opens to the Bonjour Print Services for Windows download page. \nOne could infer this means \"Download and reinstall Bonjour Print Services for Windows.\"  Is that what we are supposed to do?\nAll messages in the Event Viewer where the source is Bonjour Service are of severity Informational.  They alternate between Service Started and Service Stopped(0).  My guess is the (0) is the return value.\nI am asking here rather than some other stack because the malfunctioning software is a Windows executable authored and controlled by Apple.  When an application experiences a problem, it is the application which has the first responsibility for diagnosing and reporting the problem.  The operating system is responsible for faithfully executing the services the application requests, but it is unreasonable to expect the operating system to explain to a user why exactly an application ended abnormally.  Thus, this is an Apple issue, not a Windows issue.\nAfter reinstallation of Bonjour, the problem was no longer reported.  However, that does not mean the reinstallation was fix; it could be that the problem is transient.  \n\nA: I cleared the problem on my system by reinstalling Bonjour.  \n", "Q: Is it safe to put ipad baseband 06.15.00 on iPhone 3G in order to unlock it when using iOS 4.2.1? I am asking this because I observed that there were some reports regarding problems with baseband 06.15.00 on iPhone 3G like no GMS connection or poor or no GPS functionality.\nFrom my knowlege Redsn0w is the tool to do this.\n\nA: I believe the iPhone 3G and the iPad 3G use very different baseband processors and putting the firmware from one on the other, if possible, would probably brick it. It's akin to trying to put the BIOS for a Toshiba computer onto a Dell.\nThen again, I'm not entirely sure on this one.\n", "Q: How do I automate a backup of new MobileMe calendar data The new MobileMe iCal data lives in the cloud, and the data on your computer is actually a cache. This support article from Apple explains how to backup calendar data by exporting to an .ics file. I would like to automate that process via AppleScript, Automator or any other method (paid software is fine). \nThe sticking point with AppleScript is selecting the calendar on the left hand column. In Automator I don't think the available actions support this level of automation.\n\nA: Automator does support selecting a Calendar. Using the Filter or Find actions, you can Find (Calendar) Where: and then (Title) (Contains): ____\n\nA: I was going to suggest using MobileMe's backup but:\n\nUnlike the previous version of MobileMe Calendar, with the new MobileMe Calendar, the master copy of your calendar data exists in the cloud (on the MobileMe severs). Various calendar clients (such as iCal on Mac OS X and the Calendar app on iOS devices) view a locally-cached copy of the data that is updated whenever a change is made on the server.\n\nSo it's a bit tricky! If you comfortable setting AppleScript or Automator to download a file AND you're comfortable making your calendar publicly accessible (assuming someone finds out your public url), you could do this:  \n\nBacking up from me.com/calendar\nGo to me.com.\n  Publicly share a calendar.\n  Copy the URL (web address) from that shared calendar and paste it to the address field in you browser.

For example:\n\nPerpetua:2011-01-16 ashley$ xattr -l IMAG0107.jpg \ncom.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment:\n00000000  62 70 6C 69 73 74 30 30 50 08 00 00 00 00 00 00  |bplist00P.......|\n00000010  01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000020  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 09                    |..........|\n0000002a\nPerpetua:2011-01-16 ashley$ \n\n\nBut this isn't the attribute I want to edit.  I imagine this is because kMDItemComment is an iPhoto-specific piece of metadata.  My question would be, how do I go about editing it?\n\nA: com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment is in binary property list format. Using xattr -p -l -x | tail +2 gives you just the hex dump of the attribute. You can then pipe that into xxd -r to turn that back into a binary file.\nFrom there you can open that file in Apple's Property List Editor, assuming you have the Developer Tools installed. You can then edit the property visually.\nYou should then be able to reapply the edited value to the file using xxd -p -x and xattr -w -x.\nThis is all much more messy than one really wants for a single property that's just a string.\n\nA: One can do this in the \"Mac\" way (by AppleScript), using the following script setFinderComment.scpt\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\non run argv\n    set filePath to POSIX file (item 1 of argv)\n    set fileComment to item 2 of argv\n    set theFile to filePath as alias\n    tell application \"Finder\" to set comment of theFile to fileComment\nend run\n\nThen you make it executable chmod a+x setFinderComment.scpt and use as\nsetFinderComment.scpt filename comment\n\n\nA: The OpenMeta project is using the extended attributes to store their tags. The source code is available at https://code.google.com/p/openmeta/. Part of that project are open meta command line tools. \nThis command line tool does operate on pre-defined set of attributes used by OpenMeta, but as it is open source, it can be easily adapted to allow additional command line setting for setting/reading other extended attribute.\nNot direct solution, but a path to a solution ?\n", "Q: How do I make an iMovie 11 project into a DVD without iDVD?

So I have other choices?\n\nA: Apple has just issued an update to iDVD to make it more stable, and help with importing from iPhoto. With any luck, it will solve this. Get it through Software Update, or from here.\n\nA: Even though iDvd is a bit of a mothballed application, you might be able to get around your hassles with one of these workarounds (iDVD was always a little buggy transferring from iMovie to iDVD anyway).\n\n\n*\n\n*Try exporting your slideshow from iMovie using the default settings of Share -> 'Export Movie using Quicktime', then import that .mov or .dv file into DVD by dragging and dropping it into iDVD. If you're confident export the movie using 'Export Movie using Quicktime' with the following settings:\n\nFor best results, in the QuickTime export settings, choose NTSC-DV with a frame rate of 29.97 or PAL-DV with a frame rate of 25. Choose No Compression for audio and set the rate to 48 kHz  (here)\n\n\n*If you still don't have any luck, use the 'Save as Disk Image' option in iDVD, and then use Disk Utility to burn that image to a DVD (drag the disk image into Disk Utility, click on it and choose burn). Leave a comment if you'd like more detailed instructions on how to do this.\n\n*If that doesn't work use iDVD's built in Slideshow function. The options are pretty sparse compared to today's iPhoto / iMovie's effects, but it might do the trick for you. \n\n*Toast, Xilisoft and Burn can also create DVD video discs. \n", "Q: Moving an iMovie-11 'work in progress' moving from one system to another I just discovered that 'system a' has no DvD burner. System B has one. I can drop ilife onto system B, but ... which of the collection of 'import/export' mechanisms makes sense here to use the B drive if the movie is under construction on A? Heck, can I just somewhow share the 'media browser' and just do the DVD part of the process on System B?\n\nA: Accessing DVD drives\nUnder System Preferences > Sharing you can share the DVD drive of B with A.\nThis should allow you to use the DVD burner on B as though it were a part of A, so you can just keep working on A.\nImport / Export\nYou mention iLife, but not what program in iLife you are using, nor what you are doing with that program, so it is difficult to suggest an export/import method.\nMoving 'Work in Progress'\nYour question is about accessing a DVD drive, but your title is more generic. \nIf you want to move work in progress between two computers, you can use a variety of techniques, including, for example, DropBox, USB drives, shared folders over wireless or wired intranet or internet, etc.\n\nA: Do you mean to import/export the iMovie project (or whatever) from system A to system B? \nAs mankoff points out you can simply share the DVD drive over the network, or alternatively, once you've got iLife on system B, you could browse to your project file over the network (on system B) and burn that way as well.\nUsing either of these methods you don't need to do any importing or exporting, so they are probably the two best methods for you.\n", "Q: Can anyone recommend a programmers' editor? I'm looking for a programmers' editor. I know Xcode and I use it for application programming but I'm looking for something that will:\n\n\n*\n\n*Syntax highlight PHP, SQL, Javascript (including jQuery) and CSS not required but would be nice; also Lua, Python, and Perl   \n\n*IntelliSense type stuff, start typing and get all the functions/objects/variables it could be and any parameters. Xcode does this well for C/C++/Objective-C but looking for languages that are listed above.\n\n*Would be nice if it worked with projects and not just files   \n\n*Integrated with SVN, CVS, or GIT\n\n*Had upload-to-server functionality built in\n\n\nI am aware of Coda but am looking for other options before I drop 100 bucks.\n\nA: Eclipse has addins for those languages and does all of the things you mention \n\nA: One more thing.\nSublime Text 2\n\nA: Smultron is one of my favorites, along with TextWrangelr. Both are free.\n\nA: Espresso is nice.  Similar to Coda.\n\nA: ActiveState's Komodo is an excellent cross-platform IDE (it's based on Gecko, so feels as native to OS X as Firefox does).\nIt includes all of the features you mention.  There's also a free, open-source, version, Komodo Edit that includes nearly all the features (e.g., no source code repository integration).\n\nA: NetBeans is my development environment of choice. While it's not my text editor for regular files - I'm using TextWrangler or vim on the shell for that - it is the most usable IDE I've come across so far.\nIt has great code completion, supports various languages, has a great formatting engine, extremely well done and easy to configure debugging functionalities and a very good SVN integration. \n\nA: TextMate\nDoesn't address all of your needs but I think it's pretty snaz.\n\nA: BBEdit by Bare Bones fulfills all of your requirements. Pricey but 100% worth it.\n\nA: jEdit do some of your requests, but not all of them, and it's also free.\nYou can read here its feature and languages that it supports.\n\n\nA: Ultraedit is now available for MacOS X. I haven't tried it yet. But if it comes with the same features as the Windows version (which I use on a daily basis as part of my job) it is absolutely a good recommendation. \nIt can do all the stuff you are asking for with the exception of providing an integration with software configuration management. Man, would I love to see this implemented.\n\nA: An editor that gets overlooked a lot is MacVim. It's based on the venerable vim editor, from *nix, and can do everything you asked via plugins. \nI show it supports 176-ish different languages, including all the ones you mentioned.\nI regularly do lookups of existing methods, variables, random text phrases via a CNTRL_N or CNTRL_P mapping which searches all the open files and pops up a list of the hits.\nVim calls its projects \"sessions\", which stores all the files, window settings, macros, etc., for later reloading. From vim's \"direct\" mode, :mksession path/to/sessionfile will create it. Sourcing it later from the command-line is simple: vim -S path/to/sessionfile.\nThere's a great plugin called VCS, that handles my SVN stuff:\n\n...CVS, SVN, SVK, git, bzr, and hg within VIM, including committing changes and performing diffs...\n\nUpload to server functionality is handled by the netrw plugin.\nvim does have a steep learning curve, the vimtutor, which comes with the app, can help jump-start you. Also, there are active users here and on SO's sister sites, plus on the vim IRC node on freenode.net.\nProbably the most awesome thing about vim, is its available in an interfaced version on Mac OS as MacVim, on Linux using gvim, on Windows, and from the command-line of any of those OSes. vim on any of them will use the same commands, same plugins, same themes, etc., within the limitations of those environments. I bounce back and forth from Mac to Linux all day long and have at least one vim window open somewhere. \nAnd, lest anyone think I'm not familiar with the Mac-only alternatives, I own all my copies of Coda, BBEdit and TextMate, and use them. I go way back with BBEdit, and actually used to occasionally demo it at MacWorld. It's great, but I use vim with the same settings everywhere, and none of the other editors can do that. So, if you need that cross-platform compatibility, look into it.\n\nA: i'd go with Fraise, which used to be Smultron. works with very many languages and has a minimalist interface. syntax highlighting.\n\nA: Beyond up-voting @philip's BBedit recommendation, I am compelled to emphatically endorse BBEIT: BBEdit Simply the best coding editor I've used PC or Mac. I've not used VIM but I've been coding since before DOS existed, so I understand the speed of all-keyboard-all-the-time editing. I'll give you that and yet stand by my BBEdit endorsement.\nP.S. Did I mention I like BBEdit?\n\nA: I'd second the recommendations for Sublime Text and the JetBrains products (I use WebStorm extensively in my job). If you want something free, atom is well worth a look. It's fairly bare-bones, but has a wide selection of plugins that should encompass what you need.\n\nA: It has been mentioned, but only in passing:\nAtom (https://atom.io/) is open source and developed by GitHub. Integration with github is superb and it is particularly interesting these days since there is a lot of development with new features and new ideas regularly. I think it will cover your whole list of requirements through extensions (packages - https://atom.io/packages).\n\nA: For me Jetbrains PHP-Storm is simply the best & most complete IDE!\nIt has a lot of good and usefull features though it stays simple to handle and setup.\nIt's available for Linux, OSX and Windows. .\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*PhP 5.x \n\n*Javascript (JSLint, JSHint code hints)\n\n*HTML/CSS/SCSS/SASS\n\n*Lua, Perl and Python plugins do exist.

I'd like to set up my network like this, and I want to make sure it's possible using the hardware I have. I think it should be...\nI've got my cable modem in one room. I want to plug it into an Apple Airport Express and create my wireless my wireless network here. The airport express will do the NAT and DHCP.\nBy my TV there are a few things to be networked (Xbox and Tivo). I have an airport extreme here. I'd like to have the airport extreme join the wireless network and share the connection to the ethernet ports.\nCan anyone provide some assistance on the best way to configure to do this?\nThanks!\n\nA: Here's what ended up working, via: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2725432&tstart=0\nThe following are the basic steps to configure a \"dynamic\" WDS with the 802.11n AirPort Express Base Station (AXn) being extended by the 802.11n AirPort Extreme Base Station (AEBSn). Please compare them to what you attempted to see if anything was missed.\nOne thing to note is that the AXn is not capable of providing simultaneous dual-band operation like the AEBSn. That said, you will only be able to extend the 2.4 OR the 5 GHz radio of the AXn. Since the lower frequency band travels longer distances, I would suggest extending it.\no If practical, place the base stations in near proximity to each other during the setup phase. Once done, move them to their desired locations.\no Open AirPort Utility and select the AXn.\no Choose Manual Setup from the Base Station menu. Enter the base station password if necessary.\no Click AirPort in the toolbar, and then, click Wireless.\no Choose “Create a wireless network” from the Wireless Mode pop-up menu, and then, select the “Allow this network to be extended” checkbox.\no Next, select the AEBSn, and then, choose Manual Setup from the Base Station menu. Again, enter the base station password if necessary.\no Choose “Extend a wireless network” from the Wireless Mode pop-up menu, and then, choose the network provided by the AXn from the Network Name pop-up menu.\no Enter the base station network and base station password is necessary.\no Click Update to update the base station with new network settings.\n\nA: http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/Time_Capsule_Early2009_Setup.pdf\nThe configuration on page 27 should be what you're looking for.  It will require that your modem be only a modem; not a router.  We had trouble with that when we were trying to set it up with our DSL modem.\nHave fun!\n\nA: John..  the express apparently is not supposed to be able to handle more than 10 connections, according to Apple.  Which means, you have have to set up the express so that it doesn't accept wireless clients, but can be extended.\nYou would then set up the Extreme to extend the Express, and to accept wireless clients.  Then of course you would put it into bridge mode so that the wired clients can access the wireless...\nOr you could move the Extreme to where the modem is.  Of course that means you'd have to get a switch and connect it up to the Express.  Blegh...\n", "Q: How can I downgrade the OS on a Mac to the original one it came with? If I buy a mac with OS X 10.6.5, and then I upgrade it to OS X 10.6.6, how can I downgrade it back to OS X 10.6.5? I don't mind having to reinstall the entire operating system if necessary.\nCould this same method also be used if I upgrade to OS X Lion (OS X 10.7)?\nThe reason I'm asking is because I heard that OS X 10.6.6 removed support for installing boot camp using a Vista CD, and that's all I have. Thus, if I ever want to wipe my computer and reinstall everything, I want to be able to still use a Vista CD to install boot camp.\n\nA: You can reinstall the OS back to the same version that it shipped with by using the restore discs that came with your Mac to wipe your disk and reinstall Mac OS X.\nHowever, just because Apple has officially dropped support for XP and Vista with Boot Camp doesn't mean it will stop working - the most likely situation will be that new computers will have hardware that Apple will only provide Windows 7 drivers for. Existing hardware should be unaffected.\n", "Q: How can I install boot camp if I have a Windows 7 upgrade CD? I have the following CD's:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows Vista Home Premium (Upgrade)\n\n*Windows Vista Ultimate (Full)\n\n*Windows 7 Professional (Upgrade)\n\n\nI would like to install Windows 7 on a mac with boot camp. It seems that Apple doesn't support installations via upgrade discs.\nFrom what I understand, this means that I can't simply begin the installation using the Windows 7 CD, since it is an upgrade version. What I didn't understand, though, is if I can upgrade the OS once it is installed. For example, if I install the full version of Windows Vista Ultimate, could I then upgrade it to Windows 7? Or is my only option to purchase a full edition of Windows 7?\n\nA: Actually, it's not that Apple won't let you install Windows from an upgrade disc—it's Microsoft that won't.\nThink of it in terms of a blank hard drive on (what will be) a Windows PC. You can't use an upgrade disc to install Windows, as there's no OS there to upgrade.\nHowever, once Windows is installed, you can then upgrade to a later version of Windows. This is covered in the Boot Camp\nInstallation & Setup Guide (pdf), page 15+.\n\nA: What @dori said is correct. The ability (or lack of) to upgrade a Windows edition to another, is restricted by Microsoft. If what you have is correct, you could install Vista Ultimate and then upgrade to Windows 7, however, this is a bad idea in terms of final results. \nWindows 7 \"upgrades\" haven't been too smooth according to users doing that both in Virtual Machines, Bootcamp and Native PCs. In fact, I have some Microsoft friends who recommended that I perform fresh W7 installs. \nIf you still want to try it, you can follow Microsoft's guide about Upgrading from vista to w7.\n", "Q: Why does Google Chrome mount and unmount a volume every few hours? I'm assuming it's part of the 'check for updates' process, but does anyone know how this is controlled and what it's mounting and unmounting?  \nI first discovered this behavior after updating Growl, and I ran HardwareGrowler to see what it did (it was a slow afternoon) and it's kind of neat to see what hardware is connected at any given time, and watching what happens when I plug in various USB peripherals, etc.  I know, I have a severely deficient view of entertainment.  After amusing myself with this for about 5-10 minutes, I returned to my work.\nSome time after this, I spotted out of the corner of my eye a Growl message that said 'Volume Mounted Google 8.0.0 (something)'  And just as quickly 'Volume Unmounted Google 8.0.0 (something)'.  I didn't get time for screen shots, it appeared and disappeared within seconds. \nHas anyone else noticed this and is the explanation for it posted somewhere online?  Apparently there's some helper process that's running that's doing it, but I don't see anything in Activity Monitor with Google or Chrome in the name.  I'm not a process-killing weenie, I'm just curious about this behavior I'd never noticed before.\n\nA: Apparently there is a Google Software Update process that is queued to run periodically, which is why it's not always there. (I couldn't grab a screenshot of it, it was too sneaky). It's not just for Chrome, but for Google Earth and Picasa too. It was a bit of a breadcrumb hunt finding info about it.\n\nI think the Google updater isn't a proces that runs all the time, but a launchd job that runs when you boot and every so often after that. Google com.google.keystone.user.agent and you'll find a number of explanations of what they've done (and how to get rid of it if you want).\ncharlie  (Apple Discussions)\n\nFrom Google's Help Page:\n\nGoogle Software Update is a background application for the Mac OS that helps ensure that you always have the most up-to-date, stable, and secure versions of the Google software you have installed.

How would I go about doing that?\nEDIT:  I have been looking at the asl.conf file  for the asl logging daemon.  This seems to have something to do with what I want, although, going from syslog to a binary log format is directly against sense.\nEDIT:  To be very clear one can use syslog to dynamically slice the logs. Apple is transitioning from syslog to the apple system log. So the grep approach only deals with the deprecated /var/log syslogd files. \nSwitching to syslog-ng and logging to sqlite would seem to be easier, but who knows?

All of these messages are handed over to the syslog Daemon: syslogd(8). The syslogd now outputs log messages both the BSD way (it writes stuff into various basic log files like /var/log) and into a unified log message store (/var/log/asl.log).\nIf you want certain log messages not to appear in your log files (eg. you read logs like system.log by selecting them in Console.app), you will need to configure syslog.conf(5) like chiggsy said. If you want messages not to be stored in the asl database, you will need to configure asl.conf(5).\nIf, for example, you do not longer want Bonjour's (mDNSResponders) Log messages to be stored in the ASL db, you will need to add the following line to /etc/asl.conf :\n? [= Sender mDNSResponder] ignore\n\n… and then \"gently\" restart the syslogd by:\nsudo killall -HUP syslogd \n\nNow, messages from mDNSResponder will no longer appear when you go into Console.app's \"all messages\", but still exist within your logfiles.\nLastly, if you call syslog(1) from the command line, it acts as a nice frontend for querying the ASL db - you could for example ask it to show all messages from the Time Machine Backup starter that were logged in the last two hours by running:\nsyslog -k Facility -k Sender com.apple.backupd-auto -k Time ge −2h\n\n…which explains, why the ASL db is handy: you can search for log files simultaneously in \"all log files\". \n\nA: There are 2 answers in practice, if I want to change the logging file location.\nSyslog:\nSolution is to not read the OS X syslog.conf manpage. Read the FreeBSD one. Syslog still works this way when using its BSD module.\n!-org.chromium.Chromium\n\n*.notice;authpriv,remoteauth,ftp,install,internal.none  /var/log/system.log\nkern.*                          /var/log/kernel.log\n\n!*\n\n!org.chromium.Chromium\n*.*                                                 /var/log/stfu.log\n!*\n\nThis removes chromium's ludicrously chatty log from /var/log/system.log, and puts it into stfu.log.\n", "Q: What can be done more with an old ipod touch(First generation) Hi I had an I pod touch (first generation) with version : 1.1.5(4B1) which I bought from EBAy\nlong time back in 2008\nI had installed latest ITunes and browsing if \nI can find any applications that can be run on this 1st gen iPod.\nBut most of the apps are generally compatible with 3 and greater.\nAre there really any  for 1st gen?

I've got an old MBP where the internal drive starts to refuse reading discs and stopped burning discs a while ago.\nNow I'm thinking about getting an external drive (DVD-RW, USB or Firewire). Most of these devices don't explicitly mention Mac compatibility. According to this forum post, most of the drives should be compatible though.\nI was wondering if there's some sort of \"official\" compatibility list for different versions of Mac OS X? I also read somewhere that OS X 10.5 and 10.6 are compatible with most of the external drives... is there some information about which devices won't work?\n\nA: I've never heard of an external drive that wouldn't work.\n\nA: Modern and semi modern CD Drives (USB) are 100 % compatible with OS X since they are really an ATA drive, connected through USB.\nBluetooth and LightScribe technology will be another story, but the drive, as a reader/recorder ought to work without problems. In fact, if you ever find one that doesn't work, it would be a nice discovery. \n", "Q: Can the Epson V700 be used with an Airport I have a MacBook Pro, Snow Leopard, and an Epson V700 Scanner.\nI'm thinking of buying an Airport Extreme or even better, an Airport Express (cos it's cheap).\nCan I use the Epson V700 via the Airport as if it was connected locally via USB?\nApple talks about printers but not dedicated scanner, any ideas...?\ncheers!\n\nA: You cannot scan over the network using the USB port of the airport express. It is only for printing.\nApple does not explicitly say that scanners are not supported, but it is not one of the official uses of the USB hub. I have not heard anyone being successful in this, and AFAIK there are no hacks/third party s/w to do this (like AirFoil for streaming audio).\nI personally have tried, in vain. I have a HP all in one, but the Snow Leopard does not recognize the scanner functions. I have to physically connect the scanner for this to work.\n", "Q: Rent foreign language films in iTunes It’s now pretty well-established that you cannot change the language of the iTunes store unless you also change your billing address.\nFair enough.\nBut the language setting also dominates the contents of the store completely. I.e. I cannot download films that, though available in the US, have not (yet) appeared on DVD in Germany (having a German billing address).\nThis is annoying.\nBut it gets worse: apparently I also cannot rent/buy the original version of most DVDs that are available.\nWhen I buy a DVD in Germany, it always also contains the original voice track. No reason not to include it, after all. Since most film translations are sloppy and generally just incredibly poorly done, and since even the well done translations necessarily lose some of the finer nuances, I always try to watch the original versions of films of which I understand the language, and I know a lot of people who do the same.\nSo this must be a common request.\nIs there any way to rent/buy the original version of the available iTunes films?\n\nA: Short (and only) answer: No, you cannot rent or buy movies in other languages. I share the same problem in Spain, movies are dubbed in spanish. \nMatrix sounds hilarious in spanish, trust me. \nThere's no way to change that. The only solution is -like you've said- switch to the US Store, but that requires billing address changes and all the hurdles involved in that. \n\nA: If you find someone who can provide you a foreign gift card from your desired country, you can use it to create an account and purchase from the store of that country.\n", "Q: 25+ inch monitor (Macbook Pro and Windows laptop) I have a Lenovo Windows 7 laptop and now I have a shiny new Macbook pro to go with it.\nI want to build a workstation where both share the same monitor. Since I code, I want a fairly large monitor with a fairly large resolution so that I can see a lot of code. The only thing better than high resolution is very high resolution. :)\nThe Lenovo laptop is docked and has a digital output (the unused rectangular white outlet in middle of the picture)\n\nSince I want a large monitor which is going to be a decent investment, I should get one with the best goodies so I can hook up other things to it and use it for other purposes. \nSo here is a two part question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can anyone provide insight on the features to get?\n\n*How do I go about choosing a monitor that can be shared between the Lenovo and the Macbook Pro laptops?\n\nA: This may have less to do with the monitor you get and more to do with how you hook up the laptops to the monitor. When using multiple desktops on a single monitor, I've found KVM switches extremely useful. If you were planning on using a single keyboard for the two laptops, I would recommend this approach. However, I'm not aware of a single keyboard that will give you OS-specific controls for both Mac (command, eject, volume, etc) and Windows (start, etc).\n\nA: @Daniel has a good idea with the switch.\nHowever, if you don't need to share keyboards/mice, I recommend getting a monitor with multiple inputs (almost all these days) and just connecting the Lenovo to one and the MacBook Pro to the other. Switch the inputs on the monitor.\nThe downside of this is that, even if the monitor isn't using the Mac's input, the Mac will think it's connected. So, you may get windows popping up on a nonexistent monitor, and losing your cursor now and then.\nAs for features: Make sure you get something with a high contrast ratio, and as VESA mount. Even if you don't anticipate mounting it right away, you may well want to later, especially if you share it between multiple machines.\n\nA: In addition to Daniel and Nathan's answers, do not buy any monitor that has \"speakers\", 99% of the displays that came with speakers turned out to be a complete waste of technology (not the display itself, but the speakers), which will let you wonder, why put speakers there in the first place if the volume/quality is going to be worse than using a Megaphone. \n", "Q: Can I disable the iPhone's auto-rotation to landscape mode? I can't stand iPhone's auto-rotation feature, e.g. rotate your phone just past some threshold, and the screen rotates from portrait to landscape.\nThis is always tripping me up, especially when I'm lying down and simply want to read my iPhone in portrait mode.\nIs there a way to just disable the feature altogether?\n\nA: No, there is no way to disable the accelerometer on an official iPhone.\nApparently for Jailbroken iPhones, there is a Cydia app called 'Rotation Inhibitor' (thanks JeffP) that lets you disable tilting for Safari and music mode. Info is here, but I have no experience with it.\n\nA: Before iOS 4 - jailbreak software changes could do this.\nFor iOS 4 and later, the lock function easily sets a portrait mode for all apps that run in both portrait and landscape. \nYou can lock the screen rotation on the iPhone 3GS and 4, running iOS 4, to portrait only by double pressing the Home button (bringing up the task switcher), swiping right to show the media controls and pressing the left most icon (looks like a refresh button), the rotation lock. When locked you will see a padlock in the icon and a new status bar icon of the same design.\nNote: this does not affect applications which only run in landscape mode, such as most games.\nEdit: Video of how to do this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYkUzYXtZT0\n\nA: On iOS 7+:\n\n\n*\n\n*Slide your finger from the bottom of the screen upwards. A menu called Control Center should appear.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the lock icon.\n\n\nA: With the advent of the iOS 6+ Accessibility feature \"Guided Access\", there is a workaround for this. It limits a few things but it completely works if you really need a solution.\n\n\n*\n\n*To enable the feature you will use, navigate to Settings > General > Accessibility > Guided Access and flip the toggle to ON. Set a passcode.\n\n*Navigate to the app you wish to lock rotation in, and rotate the device to a landscape orientation.\n\n*Triple-click the Home button. Depending on how other Accessibility options are set, you may need to then select Guided Access from a popup that appears.\n\n*Select Options and disable Motion. Press Done, followed by Start.\nThis will now lock the rotation in a lanscape orientation! Unfortunately it also disables all hardware buttons, so you will be unable to switch apps, lock the device, or adjust the volume until you triple-click the Home button again to disable Guided Access.\n", "Q: How to make preview jump to a specific line on startup I am using TexLipse for working with latex, producing pdfs as output. I have configured it to use preview as viewer using this command line:\nopen -a \"/Applications/Preview.app\" %fullfile\n\nWhere %fullfile is the name of the file to be opened. TexLipse supports the adding of a %line argument, that can be passed to the viewer to make it jump to the position where the cursor in the editor is at. However, I could not find a way or any documentation on how to pass that argument to preview. Can anyone explain how to achieve this? Is it even possible?\n\nA: If you are working with LaTeX, you should use Skim.app not Preview.app\nSkim has support for moving bi-directionally between LaTeX source and the PDF, to a specific line in either the source or PDF file.\n\nA: Not possible with Preview. It can go to a specific page, but that's as close as you can get. And I doubt that's baked into the CL access.\nYou can get the free Adobe Reader for Mac here. It must be able to do this...\n\nA: It is possible with Preview.app but it wasn't designed for this so it is a bit of a hack.\nTurn on GUI scripting, then make a script that simulates pressing the down arrow, then call that script n times.\n", "Q: Cleaning White MacBook I have a white MacBook, and it has gotten kinda dingy over the past couple of years. Still runs fine, but I would like to know what I can use to clean the white plastic. I was thinking one of those Mr. Clean erasers, but just want to see if The Community had any other (verified) options lol.\nThanks!\nThomas\n\nA: In my (too many) years of experience, the best \"mix\" you can make is composed of:\nSeven parts of water (distilled if possible but in the case of the plastic it won't make much difference)\nThree parts of alcohol (the same used in medicine, sold in pharmacies). \nSo you actually put seven \"somethings\" of water and then three of alcohol. Mix, and store in a bottle, closed (or the alcohol will evaporate!). It can last for months. Use soft cloth to clean everything, even screens. Don't use toilet paper on screens. \nnote: Somethings can be, glasses, spoons, lid, etc. The important thing is that you use it for both water and alcohol, so it's the same proportion.\n\nA: Nothing beats a microfiber lens cloth to get all the fingerprints and smudges off of a glossy screen (without streaks).\nI just use plain old Windex on a cloth to get the keyboard and case feeling crisp again.  Been doing this for years and never noticed a difference from isopropyl alcohol.  (Just don't spray your laptop)\nMicrofiber cloths on Amazon\n\nA: Be careful with Mr. Clean Magic Erasers. Although at first they seem perfect for the job (you just gently rub the eraser and your Macbook starts to look like new again) they are very abrasive, which means you're actually removing the coating from your Macbook (as if you were using a very fine sandpaper).\nI only used Magic Erasers on my Macbook once, but I suppose that over time the result won't be good.\n", "Q: Recreating iTunes library from a .itdb file? My Windows laptop (and HDD) have died, taking with it iTunes and my music. Things could have been a lot worse, but I fortunately have a back up of my mp3s. However, I have lost the iTunes library containing all my play counts, last played, ratings etc.\nI am keen to recover this data and have bought software to access my iPod Touch as a hard drive which has enabled me to view the underlying files. However I don't seem to be able to find a version of the iTunes Library.itl (or iTunes Music Library.xml) file which would contain the meta data I need.\nThe only seemingly useful file I can find is the library.itdb file, which seems about the right file size to contain the data I'm looking for.\nMy question therefore is can anyone advise if there is a way of recreating the library .itl or .xml file from this .itdb (iTunes database) file?\n\nNB. I have managed to extract the meta data I need, but the program I am using creates its own paths to the mp3 files, which would leave every track broken.\n\nA: You never said whether your hard drive is dead. If it's not, pull it out and use it as an external drive (with the help of a SATA-Firewire adapter).

I'm looking for something to replace Visio on a Mac.  I am getting tired of using VMware because it's too slow on my computer and was wondering if there's anything out there I can use to wireframe apps specific to Macs.\n\nA: If money isn't an issue, or one that you can wrestle with, then I don't think there is really any better tool for this than OmniGraffle by the Omni Group. It doesn't come with interface elements by default, but there is a freely-available extensive library of options on their site Graffletopia.\n\nA: Even if the need is not exactly the same, some answers of this recent thread may apply.\n\nA: I have the same problem, Visio and MS Project are the only things i can't find good replacements for, so i have an XP VM running in Parallels.\nMost of the time we use the free version of Balsamiq. We have a license for the installable version, but no one uses it, preferring to use the online version.\nNot as clean as Omnigraffle or Visio, but works well for wireframing. \nAlso, consider the Drawing tools in Google Docs, they are excellent and have all the basic shapes.\n\nA: Not the exact answer, but Crossover Mac claims to run Visio 2K3 (And the whole Office Suite) using an API comparability layer, rather than a full-blown VM.\nIt's basically Wine with a pretty GUI and some Mac-Specific Tweaks.\nOTOH, if you're feeling adventurous, you could try straight-up wine, whough it will likely require some console trickery. \nThe Wine App DB Claims that Visio 2007 works pretty well.\nThe easiest way to get Wine on OS X is probably MacPorts -\nJust sudo port install wine winetricks\n\nA: I recommend OmniGraffle, as previously mentioned, with the Konigi Wireframe Stencils or the Yahoo! Design Stencil Kit.\nBut, if you find OmniGraffle too expensive, you can save some money and use Keynote ($20 in the App Store) with Travis Isaac's Keynote Wireframe Toolkit ($12), which I've found a very capable replacement. Check out his Keynote Kung-Fu presentation on the subject of wireframing with Keynote.\n", "Q: Typing umlauts and accented characters without the one second delay One of the things I dislike most with the iPhone is its sized-down keyboard with only 10 keys in a row.\nThis may fine for English, but leaves not enough room for umlauts or accented letters.\nThe official way to input umlauts is to hold down the key and wait\nuntil the umlauts and accented letters pop up, but this is way too slow.\nFor numbers and symbols there is the tap-slide-release trick,\nbut for umlauts this doesn't work.\nIs there a way to type these letters faster?\n\nA: I don't know a direct solution to your question: Reduced delay. If your iPhone is jailbroken you might be able to find the preference file that sets the delay and reduce it.\nOne work around could be to not deal with the accents at all and have the iPhone insert them for you, as autocorrected words. You can now type full speed.\nTo add custom words to the dictionary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the Japanese Ten Key keyboard: Settings > General > Keyboards > International Keyboards > Add New Keyboard > Japanese Ten Key.\n\n*Add words: Settings > General > Keyboards > Edit User Dictionary.\n\n*Have the Word be what you want to type w/o accennts, and the Yomi be the accented work.\n\n\nFor example, I added Word=fooxx and Yomi=föoxx, I then went to the Notepad and using the English keyboard I typed \"fooxx\", and the iPhone suggested föoxx. When I did this example without the \"xx\" it did not work, perhaps because foo is already in my dictionary.\nAlternatively, if you iPhone is jailbroken you could try using Xpandr\n\nA: What umlauts are you interested in? Could you switch to a keyboard layout which has them? I use åäö which are included in the swedish keyboard layout.\nApple provides several keyboard layouts for iOS.

I ran Airport Utility on the\nMacBook, then tried \"Configure Other\" (from the File menu).  I got a prompt for the\nIP address and password of the AEBS.  I was able to successfully connect when I entered the IP address 192.168.1.2:5009 or just 192.168.1.2, but the connection failed\nif I tried 192.168.1.2:548.\nNext I connected to a \"live\" WRT160N over the internet.  I configured a port forwarding entry (using \"Applications & Gaming\") for 5009, to forward to an AEBS behind the WRT160N.  Then I ran Airport Utility, did another Configure Other, and BINGO!  It worked.  When I tried the same process using port 548, it failed.\nMaybe 548 is the port to use to access files on a Time Capsule, or a disk attached to an AEBS?\n\nA: If You Have a Time Capsule or an AirPort Extreme Base Station with Shared USB Hard Drive \nIf you have either a Time Capsule (which is basically an AirPort Extreme Base Station with a built-in 500 GB or 1 TB hard drive) or an AirPort Extreme Base Station (AEBS) with an attached USB hard drive, you can share out the Time Capsule/AEBS hard drive and make it accessible via the Internet. To do this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Start the Airport Utility. \n\n*Select your Time Capsule or AEBS. Make a note of the IP Address shown on the right -- you will need it later. \n\n*Click Manual Setup. \n\n*Check your \"Connection Sharing\" setting under the Internet Tab. The following tutorial is valid if your \"Connection Sharing\" is to \"Share a public IP address\", the normal setup for a home network. You will need to have a static IP address, or use a free dynamic DNS service. If you have a different type of \"Connection Sharing,\" you probably don't need a tutorial to set up remote access to your disk; adapt this one as needed.\n\n*Click Disks (at the top of the dialog box), and then click File Sharing. \n\n*Select (check) the \"Enable file sharing\" checkbox and the \"Share disks over Ethernet WAN port\" checkbox. It is strongly recommended that you also set Secure Shared Disks to \"With base station password\" and Guest Access to \"Not allowed\"; not making these changes may allow unauthorized users to access your Time Capsule/AEBS hard drive. \n\n*Click Airport (at the top of the dialog box), and then click Base Station. \n\n*Enter a Base Station Password and verify it in the Verify Password box. \n\n*Click Advanced (at the top of the dialog box), and then click Port Mapping. \n\n*Click the plus sign (+) to add a new port mapping. \n\n*In the Public UDP Port(s) and Public TCP Port(s) boxes, type in a 4-digit port number (e.g., 5678) that you choose. In the Private IP Address box, type the internal IP address of your Time Capsule or AEBS that you wrote down in step 2 (for example, 192.168.0.1). In the Private UDP Port(s) and Private TCP Port(s) boxes, type 548. Click Continue. \n\n*In the Description box, type a descriptive name like \"Time Capsule File Sharing\" or \"AEBS File Sharing\". Then, click Done. \n\n*When you have made all changes, click Update. \nYour Time Capsule/AEBS will restart. Once it does, you are now ready to connect to the Time Capsule/AEBS hard drive via the Internet. To do this when your MBA is away from home: \n\n\n*\n\n*In the Finder, click Go > Connect to Server. \n\n*Type in the correct domain name or external IP address for your network, plus a colon and the port number you specified in step 11. For example, \"www.myhomedomain.com:5678\" or \"123.123.12.123:5678\". \n\n*Click Connect. \n\n*You will be prompted for your user name and password. The user name can be anything you like; the password should be the password for the Time Capsule/AEBS which you specified above. \n\n*Click Connect. \n\n\nVoilà! You are now connected to your Time Capsule/AEBS hard drive from your MBA. You can access files, copy files back and forth between your MBA and the hard drive, delete files, whatever you want, as long as your MBA remains network-connected. The next time you go to connect, it should go even more quickly (especially if you save your password in your keychain, and if you add your home IP address/domain name to your list of Favorite Servers in the Connect dialog box). \nNote that the Time Capsule/AEBS will appear in the Shared section of your Finder's sidebar as a server, with the Base Station Name of the Time Capsule/AEBS as the server name. \nTaken from http://forums.dealmac.com/read.php?4,2800627\nAdditional Info:\nI know port forwarding can be a big hassle so I thought I would add that you could also use apple's built in \"Back To My Mac\" feature. This way you can access your Time Capsule's files as well as accessing you home mac files and screen share with your mac over a secure connection.\nTry this article: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204618\n\nA: Here're 4 methods found on Apple discussion board, https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-3413\n\nA: Worked immediately in a iPhone:\nhttps://www.stratospherix.com/support/getting-started-with-timecapsule.php\n\nA: You have to set up port forwarding or a NAT on your home internet router mapping the port to the internal ip address of your time capsule.\n\nA: I would absolutely not do this because the connection from your local machine on your \"other network\" to your home router/gateway (and also therefore Time Capsule or AEBS) is insecure.  [note: this is true even though you can securely remotely configure your Time Capsule or AEBS via AirPort Utility because that connection is most certainly secure/encrypted]\n\n\n*\n\n*passwords are being sent over the wire, they are probably encrypted, but potentially they are not\n\n*files/backups are being sent over the wire, they are very likely not encrypted, though they may be\n\n*even if your passwords and files are encrypted, without a secured/encrypted session (such as TLS/SSL/WireGuard) you are vulnerable to a man in the middle replay attack\n\n\nThe proposed solution is insecure.\nMuch Better Solution:  You need to add in either a hardware VPN or a software VPN (running on a computer on the LAN).  For most consumer (non-business) use cases, you are going to want a software VPN.  It is ideal that this VPN is at the edge of your network so unauthenticated users cannot get beyond the VPN onto your network.\nOK, now things just got messy because now you need to know about VPNs, and thats not simple.  That's probably why this feature (access files remotely over WAN/internet) was not promoted (even if it has minimal insecure support).  So my explanation will stop here.  Best of luck!\n", "Q: When plugged in, does the iPhone use the battery or the external source during heavy use? I love to play games and do other tasks that quickly drain the iPhone's battery. Sometimes I'll use the phone while plugged into a power supply. Does the iPhone still use the battery when performing these high-performance tasks while connected to the power source?\n\nA: When you're plugged in to a power source, the iPhone will not use the battery unless for some reason you are using more power than the charging source can provide.\nNormally, unless some process is hitting the CPU and GPU and all radios (such as a GPS mapping app), even a computer USB port at 500 mA will both power your games/apps and charge your battery at the same time. \nEven if your game takes more current than the charge is providing, using all the wall power will reduce the amount of battery being consumed which will certainly save your battery.\nOf course, you should expect hundreds of full charge/discharges and as long as you are one a month draining the battery, you don't need to keep the electrons moving otherwise for good battery lifespan and health.\n\nA: Although Nathan has a valid point for wall charging, from personal experience it is possible to discharge the battery while it is plugged into a powered USB port.\nEven though my iPod Touch 2nd Gen was plugged into my MacBook, playing Need for Speed Undercover was sufficient to cause the device to power down due to low battery. It seems that a powered USB doesn't provide sufficient charge to offset the drain caused by a graphically intensive game.\nTo sum up: if you are worried about exhausting the battery while charging, use a wall charger.\n\nA: nonsense , the icon means nothing , i have my phone at 100% with the plugged in icon , i use it for awhile it goes back to lightning icon , i use r more it goes down to 99% , at 96% now having used it plugged in since 100% watching stuff in YouTube multitasking iPod etc\nit shows Apple electronics suck that they are clever enough to implement this - or they prefer batteries have shorter life , to charge you more money\n", "Q: Automating .ics import from Mail to iCal I've got a setup that will take all the events in a range of dates in Outlook 2007 (at work), create an .ics file for it, and email it to my home email address. The email comes with a few .gif files as well for prettiness. \nIs there a straightforward, relatively failproof way to automatically take the .ics attachemnt when it is received in Mail.app and import it into a specific iCal calendar? The calendar I'd like to use is the default calendar that pops up in the dialog box. \nI've done some mucking about with Automator - it sort of works, except that sometimes it 'finds' the .ics file multiple times, and so tries to import it multiple times... if it only finds the file once, it works fine. \nEDIT Jan-19 - The \"Add to iCal Automatically\" solution in Mail.app's preferneces is better than what I had, but still not quite enough.\n1. I don't see that it allows me to specify what calendar it's adding the event(s) to.\n2. It's not automatic - I would need to open the email to do it. My intention is for an unattended workflow.\n3. It's too broad - I only want .ics files that meet certain criteria (ie, only in emails from my work email address), not every invitation that I receive. \n\nA: There is an option in Mail.app that you can set to automatically 'Add invitations to iCal'.\n\n", "Q: How well does Apple Remote Desktop work over the Internet? I have a few family members with Macs that I'd like to be able to help if they have questions or get stuck, and I've been looking into various solutions to be able to remotely connect to their computers over the internet. In the past I've mainly used iChat, but it sometimes just doesn't work (and I do have a few members in my family that have a bit of trouble accepting the screen sharing invitation). My typical fallback is Skype which nearly always works, but I don't have any control over the screen so I have to walk them through what they need to do.\nNow that Apple Remote Desktop is available in the Mac App Store for $80, I'm wondering if it does what I need. Namely, I'd like to be able to automatically connect and control a remote computer over the internet without having to configure the router it's connected to. Does Apple Remote Desktop have this capability?\n\nA: Apple Remote Desktop will involve either having a VPN or open ports and static IPs. I think you will be much better off with LogMeIn.com's free version, which will require zero intraction from your family members and open ports are not necessary. You will need to know a user's credentials on their computer. If they require more privacy they can disable LogMeIn from the menu bar item, as it will always be on as long as they are connected to the Internet. I suggest adding a user to each computer with your name and one password—that will be one less thing for you to remember and if they change their password or don't remember it you can still help them. \nI use both ARD and LogMeIn daily, but ARD is more than you need. \n\nA: It appears that it does do this, with little setup required.\nSee the Apple Remote Desktop 3 Remote Assistance tutorial here.\n\nA: ARD/Screen sharing works super great to servers with static/public IPs.  Not so great behind a NATed home router with port blocking on a dynamic IP.  It can be done, but you will have to go there first to set up the port forwarding, etc.  \nIf you have an outside server hosted somewhere, you could set up VPN on your machine and the machine you want to admin too.  (That's easy to tell your parents to click the VPN icon in the menu bar).\nAlso, I think you can use \"back to my mac\" to make all this easier, but I don't know much about the details.\n\nA: ARD works better for remote support than other VNC solutions since it seems better at controlling the bandwidth needed to send a view of the screen over a slow connection.\nOther than that, it's a plain old VNC wrapper if you only care for keyboard, mouse. It is fully featured in terms of shuttering the remote screen (to hide what you are doing) as well as can be set to remotely poll lists of hardware, script and control updates to tens, dozens, and hundreds of machines.\nIt doesn't do any sort of location brokering, though so you'll still need to manage the routers, port forwarding, client configuration and such as well as use dynamic DNS or BackToMyMac or Screens connect.\nFor most people doing light support, I'd recommend the Screens program over ARD due to cost, better integration and testing of NAT and how it provides DNS tracking to let your Mac know what IP your family's Mac is using at this very moment.\n\nA: Although Apple's Screen Sharing/ARD works well over the internet, Google's Chrome Remote desktop is the best cross-platform solution I have found so far.  \nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is faster than stock VNC.\n\n*Works from/to Mac/PC/Linux (Cross-Platform)\n\n*Encrypted (unlike stock VNC)\n\n*Works with any NAT situation, most firewall situations\n\n*Helper mode to work on other people's PCs\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Requires Google Account login (Big brother and all that)\n\n*Not Multi-User, only works when user is logged into the machine already\n\n*PIN Authentication\n\nIn-Between:\n\n\n*\n*Requires Chrome?  But only requires rights on viewer PC to install Chrome plug-ins\n", "Q: Getting music from a dead iPod Touch I have a 3rd generation iPod touch with a dead battery and want to get the music off of it for my new one. \nIt powers up fine with the AC power cord but nothing with the PC's USB. \nAny short fix besides sending it out for a new battery?\n\nA: It sounds like your touch is consuming more power then your USB port can deliver at run-time.  See if you can find a PC that can supply enough current to get it to boot on a PC and use one of those non-apple sanctified recovery software.\n\nA: I feel like I am perpetuating a myth, but here goes:\nLaptops USB drives supposedly give out less power than workstation USB drives. Try using the USB port on a workstation.\n\nA: Have you checked the USB cable?  Try it with your friends USB cable and see if that works.\nShouldn't your music be in iTunes anyway?\n", "Q: Mac starts up as administrator I just got a new Mac Air for my wife. Every time she starts it up (after installing software, crashes, whatever), it starts up logged in as administrator. This confuses my wife no end (where did all my stuff go?)\nHow can I make it just go to the login screen?\n\nA: You can disable automiatic login by going into System Preferences, Accounts, then selecting \"Login Options\" and changing \"Automatic login\" to \"Off\":\n\n", "Q: Copy tunes to 2nd PC without syncing I just purchased an album on iTunes on work PC but can't sync because it will delete all my existing tunes from the iPad (I only sync with my music at home).\nCan I copy the files to my home PC manually and sync there, or will that not work because of DRM issues ?\n\nA: If you have the same iTunes account you bought the music from on the other machine, you'll be OK. Just go to that machine and choose Store -> Authorize this computer.... You can have up to 5 computers authorized to play your DRM'd music. Also, if you want to transfer music off an iPod, there are ways to do that without erasing it. Here's a link with info on apps for that.\n", "Q: Does OS X file organization works like Ubuntu's? I mean, does mac have a \"home\" folder, and if I want to format and reinstall the system, it'll not affect my home folder? And the Desktop is a folder within the home folder?\n\nA: OS X does indeed have a home folder, in /Users/<username> with a hierarchy of folders, including one for Desktop, in this location - similar to Ubuntu.\nOn most Linux distributions the /home is a different partition on the drive and formatting the primary OS partition would not erase your data. This is not the case with OS X and (unless you've made a concerted effort to the contrary) erasing the OS X drive will erase your data.\n", "Q: Is the white MacBook suitable for software development? I'd like to know if you think the white MacBook (2.26ghz, 2gig ram) is sufficient for software development (using Xcode, Interface Builder etc...)\n\nA: To elaborate on @Martín's answer, a MacBook is perfectly fine for development, I use one myself and never had issues.\nBut you could improve it. Switching to 4GB of RAM would be first thing on the list. Using a second screen could also vastly improve this setup. Another (bigger) investment would be to buy a SSD.\n\nA: XCode 3.x (and possibly 4.x when it's released) will definitely work on that Macbook. I have an old white Macbook 2.4 Core 2 Duo with 2GB of RAM and it works. Compared to the 8 Core Mac Pro, it's really slow, but it's fast enough to use it and do things with it. \nIf you want to compile a big and complex project, it will of course take longer, but other than that, the hardware is perfectly capable of running Xcode and its surrounding tools.\nThe projects will take longer to load after a cold boot, and the whole machine is naturally more limited in terms of absolutely everything (compared to a regular Mac Pro, iMac or even a newer Macbook/Pro), but if you need a light and loyal machine, this will definitely serve you.\nI'm using mine with Mac OS X 10.6.6. I remember even playing World of Warcraft on that machine a year ago.\n\nA: I'm using an old White Macbook with 4gb of RAM and it runs perfectly.\nSpecifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Processor: 2.2 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo\n\n*Memory: 4 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM\n\n*OS: Snow Leopard\n\n\nA: I own a white MacBook (MacBook4,1) with the 13\" screen. I got the RAM upgraded to 4GB right when I bought it, so I unfortunately cannot say whether 2GB would be sufficient for iOS development. However, with 4GB, I run a low-profile Linux VMware Fusion VM for development, and also XCode and IB, and my system runs fine for the most part. Over the years, it has become a bit slower, though.\nI'd like to point out that the 13\" screen may cause problems. While it is an amazing screen in terms of display quality, it is sadly pretty small for most development stuff. I am not saying you cannot get anything done. You can. I did for over two years. But it cuts down on your productivity. In the case of Interface Builder, you will quickly feel the constraint as Interface Builder is fond of spewing countless Windows all over the place. A second display is going to help a lot, but you may probably not be able to get exactly the same quality of display on the external as you would on the laptop screen. It is something that gets to me from time to time. \n", "Q: Playback on ipod touch When I synch downloaded podcasts eg BBC History magazine podcast, they playback so fast on the ipod touch it is unlistenable even though it sounds normal on my laptop. Is there some setting on the ipod I need to change. Audio cds work fine on both.\n\nA: When playing a podcast, a single tap in the album art area toggles the top bar on and off. The top bar shows position in the podcast, has an email icon on the left and a rewind 30 seconds icon in the middle. The icon on the right toggles between 1x, 2x and 1/2x speeds, so check that this is set to 1x. The icons on this bar are different for music tracks than for podcasts (repeat, genius and shuffle).\nIt's possible the ipod has got into 2x speed mode. I had this the other day, and either toggling the speed mode or pausing and playing again solved it, don't remember which.\nEdit: today I had this problem. It seemed that the fast foward button was down, because the pause button was behaving oddly with this weeks \"PC Pro\" podcast, and the x1 x2 button didn't fix it. Strangley, clicking the home button until the spotlight search appeared seemed to be a temporary fix. Then playing with the transport buttons fixed it completely.\n", "Q: Checking for folder/file changes using Automator? Is there there a way to check a folder/file for changes (includes adding files, deleting files, changes in files,...). The 'Folder action' in Automator is only checking if any files are newly added. \n\nA: You can add a \"Run Shell Script\" action with the command:\nfind <directory> -newermm <reference_file>\n\nThis will give you all files and directories inside <directory> that have changed since the last change of <reference_file>. Just make sure you modify the <reference_file> each time you run the Automator script.\nAlso give a look to the find manual page (enter man find in the terminal) for more options. Find is very powerful and further refining your search is usually a matter of a couple of additional options. E.g. to search only for directories modified after <reference_file>:\nfind <directory> -type d -newermm <reference_file>\n\nIf the version that ships with OSX is not enough, you can also try the version that comes with findutils (brew, macports etc) which should have slightly more features.\n\nA: I don't know of a way to do this with Automator, but there is an app in the App Store called Folder Watch that may do what you're asking. \n\nA: So last time I checked, Automater is using Applescript in the background to script your actions. Applescript does not have much depth to it. While it can get the list of files in a directory (and so therefore you could find out when something gets deleted), I don't believe it can calculate changes to a file.\nWhat you really need to harness is file system notifications. And since that's a beast, I would take kraymer's advice and use launchd. It has hooks to execute anytime the contents of a folder is changed. Lingon (see also its outdated SourceForge page) is a great application for helping people jump into launchd. You can write your automator script/application to do whatever you were planning to do when your directory was modified and just have the launchd task call that.\n\nA: You can check at an earlier answer of mine, but it sounds like you want \nfs_usage -f filesys  \n\nLaunchd is not the way to go for file changes, fs_usage uses the underlying machine that powers spotlight.\nEDIT: I'm utterly wrong here. Launchd has exactly that functionality required, ie: do something on a file or directory change.\nYou make a .plist file.\nScream \"XML SUX FOR CONF FILES!\"  ( It really does. )\nand you'll want to use one or both of the keys below in your launchd job.\nWatchPaths <array of strings>\n This optional key causes the job to be started if any one of the listed\n paths are modified.\n\n QueueDirectories <array of strings>\n Much like the WatchPaths option, this key will watch the paths for modi-\n fications. The difference being that the job will only be started if the\n path is a directory and the directory is not empty.\n\n", "Q: Why has moving emails from my inbox in Mail.app become so slow? Sometime in the last few weeks, Mail.app has become painfully slow when moving an email out of the inbox and into a folder. I have five email accounts that I check in Mail.app—one is pop3 and the other four are IMAP (gmail or google apps).\nMoving an email from the pop3 inbox to a local folder still works fine. However, when I drag/move an email from the inbox of an IMAP account to a folder, the email in the inbox turns gray and stays there for 2-4 seconds. This used to not be the case. In the past, even though the move might take time to replicate on the server, in the inbox of Mail.app the email would immediately be removed.\nI've captured a screenshot of the behavior showing the grayed out emails.\n\nDid something change in the last Software Update? I installed the OS X 10.6.6 update on 6-Jan-11, so that could account for when this problem started.\nI'm running Mail.app ver 4.4 (1082) on OS X 10.6.6. \n\nA: Under the View menu, check Hide Deleted Messages. That way, messages marked for deletion are no longer shown, and will be processed the next sync (like they used too).\nIt is possible you activated it unintentionally (it's just a ⌘+L away on the keyboard).\n\nA: I'm not sure if this will help you or not, but you might want to try out Speedmail - I used it in the past when my mail.app was getting very slow, and it made a significant improvement. I don't use mail.app any more though (I switch between GMail and Mailplane) so I'm can't check the issue you've described.\nHowever, supposing the issue you describe is related to update, this might not help, in which case heading over to the Apple support forums might be your best bet. \nGood Luck!\n", "Q: How to disable coalescing of log messages in OS X? I've been using Console to debug some things on my Mac, and I keep seeing --- last message repeated one time --- in the log.  Apparently it's not really essential, and you can turn it off on the command line with the -dup_delay switch on syslogd (see here).  But how do I do that so it turns it off in the Console app?  I don't want to start syslogd again, I just want to change a setting on the currently running process.\n\nA: The Console application is simply reading the log files.  I suspect running syslogd with that flag will cure your problem, as syslogd will then write the log files differently..\n", "Q: Can we load video onto iPad without iTunes? We have a shared iPad at work which is used for trade shows etc.\nIt is a pain to only be able to copy content to this from one PC, i.e. one nominated shared PC with iTunes on it. We have Windows XP on the PC currently.\nIs there a decent way of plugging an iPad into an arbitrary PC and loading content on to it, while not breaking iTunes sync?\nI've tried Dropbox but that will only allow us to stream the video within the Dropbox app, rather than download and save it into the Movies app. We really need to save the video content on to the iPad for offline playback.\n\nA: You can use the \"File Sharing\" feature of various apps THROUGH iTunes, but without having to actually SYNC with iTunes.\nInstall the free CineXPlayer app. This will allow you to play a much broader range of videos.\nThen plug your ipad into any computer with iTunes installed. iTunes will recognize the device, and let you browse it WITHOUT syncing it. If you go to the \"Apps\" tab inside the device's pages in iTunes, you'll see CineXPlayer listed below, in \"File Sharing\". Select CineXPlayer and drag movies to the \"Documents\" pane.\nTa da!\n\nA: *\n\n*Use a free cross-platform program like Handbrake to convert your video into an iPad supported format\n\n*Take an SD card that you've used with a digital camera and put your movie(s) into the DCIM folder\n\n*Use the camera connection kit to  load the movie.  For all the iPad knows, it's a movie you shot with your digital camera\n\n*Note that the movie will load into your \"Photos\" and not your \"Videos\" - that means there are some limitations (no recognition of chapters, no resume functionality) but it will work very well and is a much easier solution than anything that uses a connection to a computer or to the cloud\n\n\nA: \"Instead of syncing have you tried the Manually Manage option? Then you can load content to it from multiple PCs without doing a complete sync. support.apple.com/kb/ht1535 – Ryan Sharp Jan 25 at 16:55\"\nContrary to this being the top rated answer, this is incorrect. In order to actually choose the Manually Manage option, you must first sync the device with that target computer. I just tried it and it tells me that it will erase all content on the iPad and then I will be able to manually manage. This is a DRM requirement. \n\nA: There is PadSync if you are on a mac: http://www.ecamm.com/mac/padsync/\n\nA: You can also use Buzz Player or Buzz Player HD. Allows you to copy media in from a PC or other device on a network thru the wireless connect, without the need for the USB cable. It works great and you can download the app from the Apple Store.\n\nA: I regularly do this with GoodReader. Despite it billing itself as a PDF reader, it has relatively wide support for playing various different types of videos (as well as being an all-round good file manager/viewer too). You can get files on and off in two ways, neither of which require iTunes:\n\n\n*\n\n*By using GoodReaderUSB, which allows you to copy files on and off a USB-attached computer. This is probably closest to what you asked for.\n\n*By using the inbuilt support to expose GoodReader's filesystem via WebDAV and on a web console you can log into from any machine on the same network.\n\n\nA: If you want to avoid iTunes completely, there are out there 3rd party applications to do the same, one of those is called iTransfer\nIt's not for free but does the job.\n\n\nA: You can avoid all this iTunes/sync nonsense by letting the iPad directly acquire files via the network.  I know of two apps that will let you connect to normal file sharing (SMB/CIFS) on your Mac/PC and play directly via the network or save to the ipad for offline playback.  The only disadvantage is you have to play the files back using their app instead of with the built in 'Videos' app.\n\n\n*\n\n*OPlayer HD ($4.99) - Works with iOS compatible formats plus supports avi/mkv/wmv formats without conversion, transfer files with SMB, FTP, HTTP or via DropBox.\n\n*FileBrowser ($4.99) - Same price, but only works with standard iOS compatible content (h264 MP4, MP3, AAC, JPEG, etc) and only connects via SMB.\n\n", "Q: Change the way how finder truncates file names Finder truncates file names (and other things). Is there a way of changing this behaviour?\nexample: i have a file with a names \nlong_file_name_that_i_do_care_about.txt\nlong_file_name_that_i_do_not_care_about.txt\n\nbut what i see is\nlong_file_..._care_about.txt\nlong_file_..._care_about.txt\n\nSo my main question is how get Finder to cut off only the end of the file so i can actually see the difference? And why is Finder truncating dates and file sizes too?\n\nA: I don't believe there is a way to change that - it's thought that it is more common to have the part of the file that differs be at the end of the name (i.e. Holidays and other important days 2010.xls vs. Holidays and other important days 2011.xls).\nAs to the dates and file sizes being truncated, are you using the List view in Finder? You can change the column width to see more.\n\nA: Try enabling Finder > View (Menu) > Show Path Bar.\nNow, at the bottom of each Finder Window, you should see the path to the file and the file name. It appears that the full file name is always shown (if possible) and the truncation occurs in the path portion.\n\nA: About your truncating issue, I don't think there's anything you can do. Except maybe trying apps like PathFinder.\nAbout the date, if you the list view or the coverflow view, use View > Show View Options and uncheck Use relative date\n\nA: You cannot directly set where the truncation occurs.\nTo avoid truncation of long file names, if you are in list or column view, you can make your columns wider. Drag the header when in list view. Drag at the bottom of the separation in column view.\nTo avoid truncation of dates, you can set your date preference to something short. See System Prefs > Language & Text > Formats, and then customize to a short format like YYMMDD HH:MM. You will still have to have columns wide enough to see that.\n", "Q: personal folder in outlook stored on network share available on iphone? I am looking to swap out a BlackBerry for an iPhone from Verizon. On the BlackBerry we use an older version of the desktop synchronization software and I can access personal folders (Outlook 2007 and Exchange Server 2007) stored on a network share. Can you do that from an iPhone?\n\nA: It appears that this works while using a VPN. The iPhone talks to the Exchange group policies, and can use all the mail folders (although, IMAP may be necessary for this). For more info, see this Apple doc (page 9).\n", "Q: What does \"plays\" really count in iTunes? iTunes displays the number of \"plays\" for each track. What exactly does this mean?\nFor example, playing a little bit of a track does not seem to increment the number. But playing most, but not all, of a track seems to.\nDoes playing n seconds trigger the increment? n percent of the track? Or something else?\nI have a 4GB iPod Mini, if that matters.\nThe motivation is, I have iTunes set to automatically delete podcasts after they're played, and I don't want to accidentally trigger a deletion.\n\nA: I believe that you just have to listen to the last few seconds of a song. You can skip all of the beginning part, and it will increment the Plays if you listen to the end.\n\nA: In the behavior I have seen in the 5+ years of podcast listening. iTunes marks it as played based on a percentage listened. My guess is that would be about 98-99% listened. A 5 minute show would basically be the end. An hour and a half show would be just the last few seconds. \n\nA: In case Nathan G's answer wasn't super-clear: play count == number of times the file played right to the very end.  That means you need to let an audio file play right to completion - either until the next track starts to play, or you are returned back to the song list (if it is the last track in the list).\n\nA: Nathan G. answer was right but I want to add some other info, if you let iTunes play last second of your song and go to another song it ++ your plays of that song, but if you click other song to play and the remaining time of current song is <5s still iTunes ++ play for that song.\n", "Q: How to disable Finder's \"is available on your computer\" message I've set up an SSH tunnel to SMB on a remote Windows server, and want to access it using the Finder.  I set up the tunnel using the command:\nssh warren@sshserver.local -p 3484 -L 1445:windowsserver:445\n\n(445 is the default Windows file sharing port, which I haven't changed.  My SSH server is configured to use port 3484 instead of 22).\nThe tunnel sets up all fine and dandy.  Then, in Finder, I click \"Go -> Connect to Server,\" enter \"smb://localhost:1445\" and hit return.  I immediately get the error \"The server 'localhost' is available on your computer.  Access the volumes and files locally.\"  Except, of course, that's a dirty lie, since localhost:1445 is a tunnel, not the ultimate destination.\nIs there any way to suppress this behavior and force Finder to actually connect to the tunnel despite the fact that it has \"localhost\" in the name?\n\nA: You should be able to mount the server from the command line with mount_smb:\nmkdir /Volumes/sharename\nmount_smbfs //smbusername@localhost:1445/sharename /Volumes/sharename\n\n\nA: I'd make a symlink for this. Link the smb:// address to a local folder, so you can go into that folder and see what's on the share. I haven't used symlinks for this specific purpose, but I think they should work. Interested in hearing if they do.\n", "Q: Edit Multiple Places in iPhoto '11? I've recently upgraded from iPhoto '08 to '11 and am in the process of cleaning up my geotagging.  Most of my photos had been geotagged outside of iPhoto, but for a lot of them it wasn't as accurate as I'd like.  So what I've done is flag all of the photos where I'd like to zero in a little more on the map.  Working one at a time I can just select the photo and, in the info pane, drag the existing pin a little bit to a new location on the map.  Works fine.\nHowever, I have large swaths of photos which are all very nearly in the exact same spot (taken in the same room in a building, for example).  When I highlight multiple photos, though, the map in the info pane doesn't let me drag the pin.  (I'm guessing that the pin shown is for only a single photo, such as the first one selected.)  Is there a way I can re-assign the place on the map for multiple photos?\nEdit: Requested screen cap:\n\n\nA: I think I've found a way. Remove any places that are already assigned to individual photos in the album/event. Then select all the photos and set a location. It should now assign that location to all the photos.\n", "Q: How to revert to iOS 4.2 from iOS 4.3 beta? Hello all\nI just installed iOS 4.3 beta version available for developers on my iPhone4. Now I want to go back to version 4.2. But iTunes displays the version 4.3 installed. How can I do this?\nCan somebody throw some light on this?\nThanks\n\nA: It seems you missed the \"Read Me Before Downloading\" section at the top of the 4.3 beta page:\n\nDevices updated to iOS 4.3 beta can not be restored to earlier versions of iOS. Devices will be able to upgrade to future beta releases and the final iOS 4.3 software.\n\nAccording to Apple, anyway, no, you can't revert to 4.2.\n\nA: Well technically if you have jailbroken before and saved your SHSH you can downgrade your iphone (this should apply to all ios devices and exact steps may vary) \n", "Q: How to replace iPhone 4 front glass? My iPhone 4 front glass broke. Screen is OK, I only want to replace the glass. Assuming I get a new glass, is it hard to replace it myself? Can anyone provide some step by step tutorial on how to replace it?\n\nA: As with every \"do it yourself\" and \"Apple\", you have to be careful and know that it will possibly void your warranty. In any case, if you still decide to proceed with this, it is certainly possible to replace your iPhone 4's glass. There's a very nice tutorial with pictures at iFixit.\nInstalling iPhone 4 Front Panel Assembly\n\n\"Replacing the display assembly will\n  give you a new front glass panel,\n  digitizer, and LCD. The LCD is adhered\n  to the glass at the factory and the\n  two parts are not separable without\n  damage.\"\n\n\nA: I wouldn't attempt to remove the glass from the LCD.  The 4 is NOTHING like the 3.  Just replace the whole thing and be done with it.  You can get a new LCD assembly for under $30, including shipping, from Amazon. \n", "Q: How does HTML mouseover work on apple multitouch devices? I asked about this in connection with this network of websites, but it brings up a more general question that I don't know the answer to.\nIs it a problem that mouse over events are not able to be invoked by apple touchscreen - especially in regard to website rollovers?\nIs there a way around this?\nRelated:\nhttp://meta.scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/134/how-to-see-spoilers-on-touchscreen\nhttps://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/75656/cant-see-spoilers-on-touchscreen\n\nA: The way around this is to use a mouseover handler on a \"clickable element\", as Apple explain in their Web Content Guide:\n\nMouse events are delivered in the same\n  order you'd expect in other web\n  browsers [...]. If\n  the user taps a nonclickable element,\n  no events are generated. If the user\n  taps a clickable element, events\n  arrive in this order: mouseover,\n  mousemove, mousedown, mouseup, and\n  click. The mouseout event occurs only\n  if the user taps on another clickable\n  item. Also, if the contents of the\n  page changes on the mousemove event,\n  no subsequent events in the sequence\n  are sent. This behavior allows the\n  user to tap in the new content.\n\nTapping once on a clickable element that has mouseover/mousemove content displays that content.  Tapping a second time does mousedown/mouseup/click.\nA \"clickable element\" is:\n\na link, form element, image map area,\n  or any other element with mousemove,\n  mousedown, mouseup, or onclick\n  handlers.\n\nTherefore to fix the spoiler rollovers they would have to change using CSS to Javascript (i.e. use a mouseover handler on the blockquote, rather than a CSS class).\n(Apple has patent applications for detecting hovering on touch interfaces, so this could go away in the future.  However, it's unlikely that will be soon).\n\nA: There isn't a good way to do this. I've found a bookmarklet that lets you read alt/title text, but not much else. Enjoy.\n", "Q: How is it possible that my Macbook Pro with a failed logic board works just fine? Some weeks ago, I went to a client's site to install a new router (Macs rock for IT work!) and when I opened my MacBook Pro (5,1) it didn't return from sleep; the screen stayed black and the indicator light glowed a steady white.  I opened and closed it a couple times, but still nothing.  I presumed some fault and so I hard-powered-off.  When I powered back on, I got the S-O-S chimes described here (I know that article is for the Air).  This continued several more times.  I returned to the office and I did some searching and people recommended Cmd-Opt-P-R to reset PRAM, which I tried to no avail, until...I was pressing random keys on the keyboard and it started right up.  \nI had to swing by the Apple Store for another user, so I asked one of the Geniuses there what his experience was, and he told me that SOS beeping is the logic board, and that pretty much there's no hope.  I was intrigued, and did not tell him that it was sitting on my desk, running fine, at that very moment.\nFast-forward a couple weeks, and my Mac works perfectly fine, except when it needs to reboot.  I find that if I need to reboot, I have to clear the PRAM and then press S or C to start the computer.  Sometimes it takes more than one try.  It will sleep and wake perfectly every time (usually 2x per day, with car rides) and will never give a single issue while running.  Not a hiccup.  \nSomeone suggested a bad solder joint which is being affected by temperature, but I think that's not the issue:  I can leave the computer in the cold car for an hour, sleeping.  It wakes up completely fine.  There's not enough current to be heating any part of the board to maintain contact on a failing joint.  Similarly, I can finish some photo editing and the system is hot and I can close the lid, put it to sleep, and remember 'one more thing' (It's an Apple thing, what can I say?) open the lid, and it resumes flawlessly.  \nEverything I can find on the SOS chimes is 'Hope you got AppleCare, that means your logic board is gone, man' but that is (in this case) demonstrably not true.  Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  Is there anything else I can or should try?  This has all the symptoms of a firmware glitch to me, or some strange EFI issue.  No one else, apparently is experiencing it at this time.  Anyone?\n\nA: I've heard of a logic board \"limbo state\" where it passes in and out of working. It is broken, but it's letting you use it until it decides to die altogether. You may as well get all the life you can out of it, but don't depend on it to heavily.\nI can't find confirmation of this, but I know I've heard stories of it before. Can anyone confirm?\n", "Q: Uploading pictures on iPhone to Facebook application doesn't work Trying to upload picture from my iPhone to Facebook.  In Facebook app, when I choose a picture and select 'Upload' I should see progress bar as picture uploads.  Instead when I press 'Upload' the upload screen disappears and picture is not uploaded. \nI tried closing the app and restarting it again, it still doesn't work. I reinstalled the application and then it will let me upload couple of pictures until it will start failing again. \nI have iPhone 4 running OS 4.2.1\n\nA: Go to Settings->general->Location Services, switch facebook to \"ON\" and try again.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Magic Trackpad / Mouse very spongy on Windows 7 with Bootcamp Update Drivers It seems to me that both, Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad respond differently on Windows.\nWhile using them with Mac OS X feels natural, on Windows 7 with drivers extracted from Bootcamp Upgrade, it feels spongy / laggy / delayed / with latency, no matter what the mouse settings are. So I feel like I'm not in touch with the mouse pointer (cursor).\nIt makes me sad that I should not be able to use this excellent hardware on my Windows PC, and I would like to know if this can be fixed.\n\nA: I have experienced this as well (from MS mice in O SX and Apple mice in Win7).  I have reported this issue -- I think Apple's \"doesn't work well with Windows\" bugs get tossed on the back burner and forgotten (until they start to cause a stink).\nIn the mean time, this is what I have observed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Completely disconnecting hardware before restart helps (Unpair/disconnect/turn off everything)\n\n*Microsoft USB hardware needs to be physically disconnected during/before reboot to work well in OS X\n\n*Plan B -- Use VMware Fusion to run Windows.  How much is it really necessary to have fu only for serious hardware needs.  I do this just so that I can use my magic mouse and bluetooth keyboard without trouble.\n\n*Have a cheap MS USB wireless arc mouse handy (the top-heavy laser resembles behavior of the magic mouse)\n\n\nOther thoughts:\n\n\n*\n\n*I had this problem in Ubuntu also -- if my MS mouse was left connected during a reboot from Win to Ubuntu (and Ubuntu to Win), the mouse would act funny.  The problem was solved by disconnecting and reconnecting.\n\n\nA: In regards to the Magic Trackpad, I have seen this issue as well, and found it on other sites noted as a probably bug. The workaround they suggested, which I also found beforehand, was to do a physical click (press down to make it click). After that, it becomes responsive. \n\nA: I was having a problem with a bluetooth mouse under Windows 8 with Boot Camp. The mouse worked fine in OS X. \nIn the end I found there is a property on the wireless network card called \n'bluetooth collaboration' that can be enabled when in Windows. This fixed the problem for me and now the bluetooth mouse works perfectly. \nOpen Device Manager, find the network adapter and look at it's properties. On the advanced tab find Bluetooth Collaboration and make sure it is enabled.\nhttp://blog.craigharvey.me/2012/09/08/macbook-pro-boot-camp-and-bluetooth-mice-in-windows/\n", "Q: Monitoring and limiting internet usage I am currently having to access the internet through a wireless dongle which is giving me a 2gb per month download allowance. I need to be really cautious about my internet usage.\nJust this afternoon I ran out due to some process downloading 600mb of something. I have no idea what it was (although I suspect iTunes) or why it would need to download so much.\nIs there anyway I can monitor which processes are using the network, or failing that set up a firewall that only allows the apps I choose to have access?\n\nA: If you install Little Snitch you can monitor which application using internet. Every time any application wants to use internet you must accept or deny it, but it doesn't have an ability to measure bandwidth usage of each application.\nYou can see its demo here.\n\nA: 600 MB doesn't sound like iTunes, unless you told it to do it. \nI'd look into \"Software Update...\", which, in its case, can have its automated run turned off so you can run it manually.\n\nA: HandsOff!

When plugging a USB stick into a Mac, OS X creates a number of hidden files on the stick, including a Spotlight index and Trash folder.\nExample from the terminal for a USB stick \"Untitled\":\n$ ls -a /Volumes/Untitled\n.Spotlight-V100\n.Trashes\n._.Trashes\n.disk\n.fseventsd\n\nIt even does this on the xD memory card for my camera, so after having copied my pictures and deleted them from the card, the card is still full.\nIs it possible to turn this off for USB and memory cards, so OS X either writes these files to the primary disk or doesn't write them at all?\n\nA: MacOS now provides this direct flag that you can toggle from Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteUSBStores -bool true\n\n\nA: Actually touching the .Trashes file will be the best way to solve your main problem since .Trashes is now a file instead of a folder.  This means that Apple can't relocate the files to the .Trashes folder when you delete them and your drive is no longer full.\nAnother option is to hit Cmd-Opt-Shift-Backspace to force Finder to empty the .Trashes content on the card before you eject it.\nThe first method is really the best as the second affects all Trash contents on all drives.\nHowever, it seems from your post that you are more worried about the pollution of the drive by the various dot files.  If you follow the steps mentioned above, you'll save your disk space, but there will be a minimum of dot files created.\n\nA: @ Miles Leacy's post\nand @ qarma's comment:\nNo, this is still possible even in OSX 10.9, but you need to do a few extra steps now:\n1) In Finder click Go then click Go To Folder...\n2) Type /Volumes and click Go.\n3) A Finder window will open, and it should say Volumes at the top.\nThis is the most important step:\n4) Next to where it says Volumes at the top of the Finder window, there is a tiny blue folder icon. Click and drag this icon left into your Favorites panel.\n5) Now you will have access to your Volumes folder anywhere, including in Spotlight settings like Miles Leacy suggested. (Whenever you need it, just click on the Favorites link to select it.)\nHope this helps,\nBest,\nVlad :)\n~ ~ ~\n\n~ ~ ~\nWhat it looks like after adding the Volumes folder to the Spotlight exceptions list:\nNotice in the background you can see my post in Safari. ;)\n\n\nA: Update for Catalina and later\nOn Catalina and later, you might get an error saying \"Operation not permitted\" when trying to delete metadata stores on removable volumes using Terminal. To fix this, enable Full Disk Access for Terminal in System Preferences > Security & Privacy.\n\nNow, if you haven't done so already, disable Desktop Services Store for USB volumes and turn off Spotlight indexing for the volume:\nsudo defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteUSBStores -bool true\nsudo mdutil -i off /Volumes/<FS NAME>\nsudo rm -rf .{DS_Store,fseventsd,Spotlight-V*,Trashes}\n\nThe first line disables .DS_Store files being created on USB volumes and only needs to be run once. The next two lines turn off indexing for Spotlight and delete the files. These need to be run every time the volume is mounted. Although you could add a script to launchd that will run when the volume is mounted, example https://superuser.com/a/132128\n\nA: I use the MacOS Terminal command line to list and delete all these files and folders before ejecting the device from the desktop.  For some files, you may have to sudo the /bin/rm command.\n\nA: I use Clean Eject (free). It doesn’t stop writing the files but will intercept the drive before it gets removed, so it’s better than a tool that you have to run separate from the eject process..\nIn addition I use a custom Automator Service (also free) to be able to assign a hotkey to clean & eject a volume using the app.\n\nA: Dumbest thing ever that I can't simply contribute this to \nMetaxis' answer.  But it's easy to create a bash script that automatically handles this for all folders in /Volumes (or a specific one if you specify).

This is an open source utility that solves this age-old problem by confining all the .DS_STORE directories in one place, by default /usr/local/.dscage\nAfter installation, and a reboot, no more .DS_STORE on USB drives, with the advantage (for some of us) of not having to disable indexing on external drives.\nSince version 1.4 it also supports OS X Mavericks.\nUpdate from Aepsis website: \"Warning: Asepsis is no longer under active development and supported under OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and later.\n\nA: The built-in dot_clean terminal command will remove ._ files:\ndot_clean /Volumes/name_of_drive\n\nand merge them into the existing files, thus not loosing any data.\nThat does still leave .Spotlight-V100 and others, though.\n\nA: UPDATED March 2018\nIt seems my solution is not valid anymore, the solution that works right now is proposed by @ElmerCat in one of the answers below.\nHe is suggesting to use CleanMyDrive 2 \nDeprecated Solution\nAs I know you have 2 choices :\n\n\n*\n\n*TinkerTool (free)\n\n\n\n\n\n*BlueHarvest (commercial)\n\n\n\n\nA: An easy way to stop my car audio trying to read hidden Mac OS files is to remove them in Windows OS. Simply copy your MP3 music to the USB stick from iTunes. Swap the stick into Windows OS and select view hidden files from folder options. This will then allow you to delete every single hidden file that your trusty Mac placed on your USB stick including those pesky .trashes files. Finally a use for Windows OS!\n\nA: I ended up using a free app \"Hidden Cleaner\". My car's MP3 player was trying to read .(MP3filename).mp3 (hollow, empty mp3 files) as well. Go to Macintosh HD in Devices section on the Finder left hand menu and drag your USB drive and drop onto the Hidden Cleaner app. It will cleanup the hollow files and leave the real MP3s and will eject your USB.\nNote: That is not a permanent solution. You need to do above everytime you copy files. I don't mind though.\n\nA: Most of the solutions here are 'clean up dotfiles before eject', rather than 'prevent dotfile creation'.  \nIn my search for a free solution for the former, I've tried a few options, and settled on the applescript here: SuperUser: Does anyone have a Mac Terminal script to remove hidden files? because it allows me to see exactly what's happening along the way.\nNote in my comment on that answer that I made a small edit to get it working on OSX 10.12.1. (I'm not reposting the source in this case, as this seems a pretty 'link friendly' question).\n\nA: *\n\n*Insert the USB drive.\n\n\n*Navigate to Macintosh HD > Applications > Utilities and open Terminal.\n\n\n*At the Terminal prompt, type the following command, replacing path_to_volume with the real path:\nsudo mdutil -i off /path_to_volume\n\n\n*Press return.\n\n\n*If prompted for a password, type your admin password, then press return.\nYou will receive the response:\n/path_to_volume/: Indexing disabled for volume. in Mac OS X 10.4 or\n/path_to_volume: Indexing disabled. under Mac OS X 10.5 or later.\nSpotlight will immediately cease to index the specified volume.\n\n\n*If you are using Mac OS X 10.5 or later, skip to step 9.\n\n\n*At the Terminal prompt, type the following command, again substituting the correct path:\nsudo mdutil -E /path_to_volume and press return\n\n\n*If prompted for a password, type your admin password, then press return.\nYou will receive the response:\n/path_to_volume/: Volume index removed.\n\n\n*At the Terminal prompt, type exit then press return.\n\n\n*Quit Terminal.\nThanks to thexlab.com, their troubleshooting Mac OS X e-books, and their website for the detailed explanation of why other methods sort of work.\n\nA: Another way to deal with (just the) spotlight files, is to add that volume to your Spotlight exclude list.  Plug the device in, and go to the Spotlight prefpane in System Preferences.  Select the Privacy tab.  Now drag that volume from your desktop up into the privacy list.. or use the + button at the bottom to add it.  No more spotlight indexing will happen on that volume.\n\nA: Update — 2021 December\nI tested the latest version of Clean My Drive 2 on an M1 Mac, and am happy to report it still works perfectly. The developer continues to update and support the app, which is still free on the Mac App Store.\n(previous remarks below still apply)\n2017 December\nYou'd think after all these years, Apple would build something into the Finder to deal with this. It's still a very common problem for people using USB disks or SD cards to play media in their cars or other devices.\nNonetheless, developers have filled the void with numerous Apple-approved apps. The apps listed in previous answers might have been good at the time, but they haven't been maintained to work with modern versions of macOS.\nI'd also be a bit wary of installing something that will wield total control of the filesystem, written by unidentified developers. Not wanting to deal with the App Store is one thing, but not wanting to register with Apple as a developer is another. Moreover, something from the AppStore has undergone at least minimal auditing by Apple and can be removed from your computer as easily as it is installed.\nSo, whenever you happen to read this \"answer\", its advice to you is to search the App Store for something up-to-date, well reviewed, and free.\nTL;DR:\nMy choice on ***December 20th, 2017*** is \"CleanMyDrive 2\" from the App Store. Solves the problem, lovely interface, completely free. (Offers in-app purchases of customized icons. Otherwise, everything works for free.)\nTomorrow, something better may come along, but the bottom line is: the App Store has free, easy solutions to j-g-faustus' original but enduring question, posed here so many years ago — a question I had myself today.\nSo I apologize if this seems more like a rant than an answer, but indeed, all of the previous answers were out-of-date and didn't lead to a useful solution. Not saying something would lead more people to waste time fiddling with the Terminal or installing questionable apps. Just go to the App Store — you won't need to pay.\n\nA: For just a particular mounted volume - like a flash drive called yourUSBstick in this example - these commands will remove existing cruft, stop Spotlight indexing now and in the future, stop the related fsevents logging, and disable the Trash feature.\nmdutil -i off /Volumes/yourUSBstick\ncd /Volumes/yourUSBstick\nrm -rf .{,_.}{fseventsd,Spotlight-V*,Trashes}\nmkdir .fseventsd\ntouch .fseventsd/no_log .metadata_never_index .Trashes\ncd -\n\nOther unfamiliar stuff you may still see you probably want to keep, like Apple double \"._*\" files and other Apple DS cruft relating to icons and window placement.\n\nA: I got this to work on Sierra 10.12.3 in Automator.\nFirst, I made this version of the script:\nIt functions the same way as freefly42's, just a different way of writing the same thing.\nTo translate for non-native bash speakers, what it does is:\nIf run with a commandline argument, it tries to see if the argument is a directory, and if that directory contains a file named \".disable_osx_metadata\".\nIf the special file is not there, then nothing happens. That drive is ignored.\nIf the special file is there, the script deletes all the osx metadata and creates a few small new items which prevents anything else. For instance, creating a file named .Trashes prevents the OS from creating a directory named .Trashes and then writing files in there.\nIf run with no arguments, it runs itself once for each directory in /Volumes.\nSo, if you run it manually or click on it, it checks all attached drives.\nIf you create a workflow in Automator, then Automator runs it whenever a drive is attached, just for that drive.\n#!/bin/bash\nx=.disable_osx_metadata\n[[ \"$1\" ]] || exec find /Volumes -type d -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -exec $0 {} \\;\n[[ -e \"$1/$x\" ]] || exit 0\nmdutil -i off \"$1\"\nrm -rf \"$1\"/.{,_.}{fseventsd,Spotlight-V*,Trashes}\nmkdir \"$1/.fseventsd\"\ntouch \"$1/.fseventsd/no_log\" \"$1/.Trashes\" \"$1/$x\"\n\nSave as \"disable_osx_metadata\", chmod 755, copy to /usr/local/bin .\n$ cd Documents/disable_osx_metadata/\n$ chmod 755 disable_osx_metadata\n$ sudo cp disable_osx_metadata /usr/local/bin\n\nThen open Automator, New, Folder Action\nThen I found that even in Sierra 10.12.3 you CAN still add the /Volumes directory in Automator, by a non-obvious way.\nGo to Finder, File, \"Go To Folder...\", manually write in \"/Volumes\" and hit Enter.\nNow this shows you a window with your HD and usb drives, but no obvious \"/Volumes\" folder to click on.\nBut the title bar says \"/Volumes\", and it appears at the bottom too.\nYou can drag the folder icon next to \"/Volumes\", either from the title bar or from the bottom, over to the Automator, and drop it on \"Folder action receives files and folders added to:[______]\"\n\nClose Finder.\nBack in Automator: on the left, scroll down and drag \"Get Folder Contents\" to the right and drop it.\nThen on the left again, scroll down and drag \"Run Shell Script\" to the right and drop it below \"Get Folder Contents\".\nChange \"Pass input:\" to \"as arguments\".\nShell:[ /bin/bash ]     Pass input:[ as arguments ]\nThen drag the script from /usr/local/bin onto the box under \"Run Shell Script\" so it says\n\"/usr/local/bin/disable_osx_metadata\"\nFile, save, disable_osx_metadata.workflow\n\nFor reference, this gets saved in:\n/Users/YOUR_NAME/Library/Workflows/Applications/Folder Actions\nIf you save something wrong, I think you have to manually navigate there in Finder to delete it.\nFinally, for each new usb drive you want to protect, you have to create a file named \".disable_osx_metadata\" in the root folder.\nYou can do it in Terminal:\n    $ touch /Volumes/NO\\ NAME/.disable_osx_metadata\nOr just keep a small text file around with a visible name (no leading dot) and copy it to the root of any new usb drive and rename it .disable_osx_metadata after copying.\nThat drive now gets cleaned each time you attach it from now on.\nNot as clean as I'd like. You have to pollute the drive a little, in order to tell the OS not to pollute it more. There seems to be no way make the OS simply leave it alone and not add any files that you didn't ask for.\nTODO: Add enable/disable functions to create/remove the dot-file.\nTODO: This does not prevent the .DS_Store files in every directory.\nTODO: Is it possible to package up the script and the foo.workflow file so a user can skip most of these manual directions?

I had some very strategic lint block just the right pins to cause this issue on my iPhone. Best of luck.\n", "Q: How to reorder the inbox list in the Mail app I check 3 email accounts on the iPhone.

I have a MBP 2010 with Snow Leopard on it. I put an SSD in the place of DVD Drive and am using an awesome SSD(80GB)+HDD(500GB) combo for speed and efficiency for the right price.\nAll I want to do is store the sleepimage on the HDD rather than the SSD since I have 8GB RAM and I can't afford to use 8GB SSD to store the current state of my Mac. Looked for a plist to make this change but failed. Not even sure if this can be done. \nI have smartsleep pref pane in case anyone is wondering. It is a handy tool(setting) but I want the state to be stored if possible!\nThank you guys!\n\nA: Nice HDD setup!\nLoad Terminal.App in the utilities folder, and use the following command:\n\nsudo pmset -a hibernatefile /Volumes/OtherVolume/sleepimage\n\nObviously change /OtherVolume/sleepimage to /YourOtherVolumesName/sleepimage \nFrom explanatorygap.net.\n(EDIT: that webpage shows even the author did not succeed with this method. Likely reason is the other drive is not ready to read the image when trying to wake up. Apple says the sleepimage must be on the root drive. I myself am getting a crash when trying this.)\n\nA: Mac's normal sleep do not have a sleep image, only \"Safe Sleep\" or hibernate incurs one.\nAs far as I know, hibernate is useful to prevent slow boot-ups; i.e., a fast restore from hibernate is preferable to a slow boot-up.\nSince you've transition to SSD, this is no longer true. SSD boot-ups are in the low teens of seconds (typically 12-15 secs), so unless restore from hibernate can beat that, I don't see much point of hibernate.\n\nA: I tried locating the sleepimage in the HDD and booting from the SSD in a firewire enclosure. It worked perfectly. I use sleep very often, like 5 times a day at least. I don't want to be writing 40GB of info in my SSD every day since it will shorten its life. We will se if it's reliable with the SSD installed on the DVD bay. If not, I'll just write\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\non the terminal so I get a plain sleep mode both with battery and AC power, trying to avoid running out of power while sleeping (the computer and myself).\n\nA: This worked perfectly for me on 10.10.3 (MBP early 2011):\nsudo pmset -a hibernatefile /Volumes/OtherVolume/sleepimage\n\nI created a path on the 2nd SSD to complete the above command \"/Volumes/HD2/var/vm/sleepimage\".\nI have my lidwake turned off so that I have to hit the spacebar to turn the comp on. This might have \"helped\" with the timing of things, but I didn't have any issues.\nOnly thing I experienced was that I had encrypted HD2, so when the comp ran out of juice and was restarted, it could not access HD2 until I had put the encryption key in which resulted in a full restart instead of from hibernation image.\nMoving the sleepimage to another disk improved my time-to-sleep by minutes ( no joke ). I have the original onboard Apple SSD (older 3 Gigabit link speed) which was taking forever to save the 8 GB sleepimage but now with the image on HD2 @ 6 Gigabit link speed, sleep is back to a few seconds.\n", "Q: Is there any app to monitor how long has each app been actively used? What I'm looking for is basically some monitoring application, which will log how long has each of my applications been actively used. By that I mean it got focus.\nThe point of this would be to monitor the workflow and to see where do I spend most time.\n\nA: I believe RescueTime will do this. It will also break down your browser usage by site, which is useful too.\n\nA: I've used Active Timer for this in the past.  Wakoopa will do it as well, but you can't get a very detailed breakdown.\n", "Q: Why does the enter/return key rename a file/folder, instead of opening it? Is there some sort of known logic behind Apple's choice to make the enter key rename a file/folder, rather than open it as is standard on Windows and Linux?\nFor those of you coming here for the substitute key combination, ⌘-O and ⌘-down arrow both work. And I fully understand ⌘-down, since ⌘-up goes \"up\" in the directory tree. But couldn't they have made some other key combination the rename key, and allowed enter to be the \"standard\" open action?\nI understand this is a point of view question, and you could argue Windows and Linux are the weird ones, but \"enter\" or \"return\" is, at least in my mind and experience with others, the universal \"okay\" key. When a dialog pops up, you can smack the enter key for the default action. When you finish typing your password, hit the enter key to submit the form and log in. In terminal, type a command and hit enter. So then why is it browse to the file, select it, and hit enter... to rename?\n\nA: I'm with @ghoppe. Plus, you get the added bonus of avoiding the mindless or accidental opening of an application (to open a file) or executing code when you're really meaning to just browse your filesystem and, well, \"Find\" stuff.\n\nA: \n\"enter\" or \"return\" is, at least in my mind and experience with others, the universal \"okay\" key. When a dialog pops up, you can smack the enter key for the default action.\n\nIn the Finder, the default action is file management. The Finder is not a launcher. You have a bunch of files you want to rename, or move, or whatever. What percentage of files do you actually open regularly from the Finder? Why should the default action in the Finder be \"Open\"?\nYou can learn to use the navigation standard of OS X instead of ENTER/RETURN. The navigation standard is:\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘ + ↑ - goes to Parent Folder\n\n*⌘ + ↓ - goes to Child Folder.\n\n\nOver time I have found these key operations better than Windows navigation where you have to switch between ENTER and Alt+Up.\n\nA: It's standard on Windows and Linux, not OS X. Doesn't mean it \"should\" be standard on OS X. :-)\nI think it's simply because that's the way it's always been, since as far back as I remember.. I think even OS 6 had this.  I know 7/8/9 definitely had it that way.  So I suppose they wanted old users to feel comfortable making the switch to X.\n\nA: Because ⌘+o opens it.\n\nA: I've used Mac OS X on and off for sometime now, and I still can't get my head wrapped around the \"enter to rename\" functionality. In windows you press F2 to rename a file, because you're performing a function, and that makes sense! Back in OS 7 (what I used for 5+ years before switching to windows) I strongly recall using enter to open things.\nI'm going to try ReturnOpen which only works on 10.3 - 10.5, so far it seems to work just fine.\nhttp://www.returnopen.com/\n", "Q: Sync iPhone/iPad with iTunes after library rebuild Short Version\nI rebuilt my iTunes library and now when I try to sync my iPad and my wife's iPhone, iTunes wants to erase and resync. \nI want to know if there's a way to save the stuff added to these devices since last sync.\n\nLonger Version\nEarlier today, I added some mp3s to my iTunes library. I could tell that iTunes had moved them to the iTunes music directory, but when I searched for them in iTunes they couldn't be found.\nGuessing that iTunes needed to be reindexed, I rebuilt the iTunes library by following instructions from Apple.\nTonight when I plugged in my iPad to sync app updates, iTunes informs me that this iPad is synced to another iTunes library... which, technically, it was.\nI'm given two choices -- transfer purchases to this computer or erase and resync. \nI'm leaning towards erase and resync. I know that I have some eBooks (not from iBook store) that I added since my last sync which I think I'll need to add again. \nMy wife's iPhone also syncs to this computer and is a bigger problem. Since her last sync, we took a trip to Disney World and she has a bunch of photos that we don't want to lose. (We could email/upload those)\nIs there a better solution that I'm missing?\n\nA: In researching solutions, I found this discussion at apple.com in which somebody suggests \"damaging\" the iTunes library. This lead to a very useful post which discusses how iTunes uses the data it has to recreate what it doesn't have and gives instructions on how to damage (without deleting) the file -- spoiler: erase the data, leave the file.\nFortunately, I had backed up the iTunes files before I recreated the iTunes library.\nI copied my backed up files back into the iTunes directory and launched iTunes and rebuilt what it needed to. There were no apps listed in the Apps display though.\nWhen I connected my iPad, iTunes didn't complain about this being an unknown device. As it started to sync, it prompted my to transfer purchases (i.e. the apps on my iPad which didn't show in iTunes) -- but with no hint of having to erase anything. The sync took longer than normal, but everything is there and I can even find the songs which were originally hidden.\niPad is fine, will sync my wife's iPhone tonight.\n\nA: The one thing you need to watch out for is any app data that isn't backed up. When iTunes erases an iDevice, it doesn't mess around. It deletes everything. If you plug in and sync often, it backs up your data and you can restore from that backup.\nAll purchases on the App Store are available for re-download so you won't lose anything in just erasing the devices and re-syncing.\nYou can pull the images off with iPhoto, which is a really cool app! It's great for rescuing photos, but also for general organization.\n\nA: *\n\n*You can always import iPhone photos with iPhoto or Image Capture (located in /Applications/Utilities) instead of syncing with iTunes.\n\n*Will transferring purchases erase your computer's library? If not, why not transfer your purchases?\n", "Q: If a buy a mac from another retailer, do I get the same warranty that I would get from Apple? On this page, it shows that without the Apple Care package, you get 1 year limited warranty, and 90 days of complimentary telephone technical support on a mac.\nIf I buy the mac from another retailer (e.g. Amazon), would I still get these same benefits?\n\nA: You'll get the same warranty from an authorized Apple retailer as you would from Apple directly. I don't know how prevalent it is today, but for a while you could buy refurbished Macs from non-authorized retailers and you ended up with little or no warranty. (Note that Apple sometimes sells refurbished machines that do have full warranties; the warranty's existence is dependent upon the authorization status of the retailer.)\nApple provides a way to determine which retailers are authorized on the Solution Professionals portion of their website. Be sure to check that list before making a purchase.\n\nA: Every new Mac comes with 1 year of AppleCare.  The option is to extend that AppleCare up to 3 years.  And, I believe you can do this at any time, IF the Mac is STILL covered by your original 1-year.  As in - I believe you can buy 2 extra years right before your 1 year (that it came with) is up.\nWith regards to a warranty done by \"in house\" staff (IE - FutureShop or BestBuy selling you one of \"their\" warranties, which are supposed to be better), it's usually not worth it.  They usually end up sending your stuff off to Apple to fix, so you just wait longer.\n\nA: One of the big problems you often see when purchasing from a non-authorized dealer, is they'll strip the extras that Apple bundles with the machine, and sell those separately.\nThere's a place near me that does that; Go to buy a replacement power-supply and they will have taken out the cord and wall-outlet adapter, and put those in separate bags, forcing people to buy them separately.\nApple's prices are reasonable, as are the prices from Best-Buy or other authorized dealers, and to avoid any BS like those other places I stick with the real-deal. \n\nA: Yes. The warranty is on the product it does not depend the retailer. \nYou can extend the AppleCare warranty from 1 to 3 years within the first year of its life. \n\nA: In the UK if you buy your Mac from John Lewis you get a 2 year warranty, but TBH the Apple warranty is really effective, it's great being able to walk into an Apple store and have them fix it while you wait.\n", "Q: Free or Cheaper Alternatives to Apple Remote Desktop 3 Apple Remote Desktop isn't a bad program. It's a bit overdue for an update, has some issues, but is an otherwise solid program. The big downside to ARD is the price, however. \nI'm trying to find an option for teachers in primary/elementary classrooms to have all the computers in their class up on the projector (which you can do with remote desktop) but I don't want to pay the US$499 unlimited seat option (education pricing is a bit cheaper, but still too much). I'm aware you can VNC using the Finder in Snowleopard, but I'm hoping for a tidy program that can simultaneously show (view) several macs. VNC Control would be nice, but isn't necessary. Ideally (almost essential) it will use the existing screen sharing engine in Sharing.preferences. \nUpdate\nIt's important that the product can show more than one screen at the same time. Logmein free is a great product but doesn't do this. \n\nA: ARD is now available on the Mac App Store for only $79.99.\nARD aside, you can do pretty much anything ARD can do with Screen Sharing, File Sharing, scp, ssh and AppleScript.\n\nA: LogMeIn has a free Mac/PC remote login/access service.

This is happening a lot more frequently as of late than before. It has the latest OS. It seems quite a few people have the same problem. Does anyone know a solution to this problem? None that I found on the Apple forum seems to solve it.\n\nA: You could try going by the Apple Store to meet with a Genius (if there is one close enough to you). They have diagnostics they'll run for free to see if something weird is going on with your phone. Make an appointment online.\n\nA: Have you tried restoring the iPhone via iTunes? You should sync the iPhone first to back up everything, then press the Restore button in the device management screen.\n\nA: You could try to reset it: Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings. There might be some corrupted preferences somewhere.\nTry to sync your iPhone and look into your ~/Library/iTunes/.../Logs (sorry, can't remember the exact path and I don't have a Mac right now).\nAnd try to find out if there's a crash file that match the time of the issue. From there you'll be able to define if it's an app running in the background or iOS-related.\nIf none of the above, it might be hardware-related (maybe you're holding it wrong!) and will have to send it to an Apple Store.\n", "Q: What substances I can use to clean the touch sensitive screens like iPhone, iPad? I heard that you are not supposed to use substances containing alcohol because it will destroy the anti-grease coating layer that's above the glass.\nThe problems is that just water and microfiber cloth is not always enough and I want to know what is safe to use.\nUpdate: Please do not recommend a specific product, or at least do not recommend it wihout specifing the content. This is important because most products are not usually available outside the US.\n\nA: I've found that the best substance is no substance. If you can grab some microfiber lens cloths online, you won't be disappointed. They absorb the finger oils well. I usually just breathe on my screen a little bit, then use circular swipes with a microfiber cloth.\nIf you are careful, any glass cleaner is fine. The reason this isn't recommended is due to the large percent of the market that would just blindly spray cleaner all over their device (causing a short), and the other percent of the market with non-glass screens. If you spray the cloth you are using, then wipe, it'll be fine.\n\nUpdate 3/21:\nMy favorite method now is using Zeiss Pre-Moistened Lens Cloths Wipes. They're at Amazon and Sam's Club. I keep a box in the office and box at home.\n\nA: I've used iKlear on my iPhone and mac LCD's without any issues.\nhttp://www.klearscreen.com/Default.aspx\n\nA: Wiping it over a clean pair of old jeans does it for me.\n\nA: Using pure alcohol is a bad idea in almost any case.\nCheck this question.\n\nA: I find cotton very effective, completely clean, oil free and dust free within five seconds. \n\nA: Pure alcohol is one of the only cleaners that isn't incredibly caustic, and it's actually usable on circuitry, provided it's turned off.\nI would recommend a microfiber cloth such as the one that comes with the Apple iPad case, or a clean cloth sprayed lightly with any glass cleaner. It is, after all, glass. I haven't heard of it reacting with the oleophobic / lipophobic coating.\n", "Q: Can I redeem EUR iTunes vouchers in any EUR country? Can I redeem a 50 EUR iTunes gift card purchased in Germany in any other country of the Euro zone?\n\nA: No. You can only redeem a gift card purchased in Germany in Germany. See this Apple doc, the section called \"GESCHENKGUTSCHEINE, ITUNES KARTEN, GUTHABENKONTEN UND CONTENT CODES\". Google translate does a very nice job (the doc is in German).\nAnyway, here's the (translated) quote:\n\nGift certificates, iTunes Cards, Content Codes and credit accounts that were purchased in Germany can be redeemed through the stores only in Germany.\n\nIt appears that this is the case for most countries.\n", "Q: How to play Apple ProRes 422 outside of QuickTime? I've received a number of videos encoded in Apple ProRes 422, and it plays fine in QuickTime 7 or X.\nHowever, I can't open them in any other player (VLC, mplayer, etc. etc.). What can I do to let other player be able to read the file?\nThanks.\n\nA: I know that this is an OLD question, but I thought I would add to the answers posted back in 2011.\nWhen it was released you could not open video encoded with ProRes in video players that did not support the Apple QuickTime playback architecture since ProRes was a proprietary Apple encoding format. But in late 2011 an open source decoder became available for ffmpeg as a compile in option.\nJust to be clear, ProRes was never intended as a playback format. ProRes was designed as an intermediate codec for use during video recording and editing, and was a replacement for Apple Intermediate Codec. As a result, it was never intended to be used as a \"playback\" format. That's why you could only play it back with QuickTime or editing software.\nFor optimal high quality video playback across a variety of video players (that have the horsepower to play back your video) you need to encode your video as a H.264 MPEG-4 video. You will want to set both the temporal and spacial compression to minimum, and make sure that the playback bit rate is not capped in the compression software. H.264 and MPEG-4 were designed for playback, and that's why it's the main format behind YouTube, Blu-ray, and virtual all playback systems in use today. While H.265 is starting to become more common, it is not yet as widely playable across a variety of devise.\nIf you do want to try and use ProRes as a playback format, then you need to make sure that the player you are using connects to the QuickTime playback codecs, and that you have the ProRes decoder installed on your system. The only video player that I know that will handle ProRes (other than pro editing systems) is VLC, and you need to have the ProRes decoder installed to make this work.\n\nA: Have you tried QuickTime's Save For Web option? This should let you save it in an MPEG file, which you can play anywhere.\n\nA: Here is a link to the ProRes decoder supplied by Apple:\nhttp://support.apple.com/downloads/Apple_ProRes_QuickTime_Decoder_1_0_for_Mac\nI imagine the only way to get another player to handle the files is to find a way for it to piggy-back on this.\n", "Q: Can iCal merge Events of attendes into one shared event? When I want to see which Events other Users in iCal are attending through the delegates tab then I get the same entry multiple times for Events which my delegates and I have accepted. Is it possible to just show one event in some special color or else so I don't get a cluttered Month view?\n\nA: For the moment it seems that this isn't possible. The logic behind using iCal with delegates is that you don't have the delegates tab activated all the time. Normally a delegate should only be looked at when it's needed. So the problem was more that I used the delegates tab in a wrong way ;)\n", "Q: Why are FTP connections read-only when I use \"Connect to Server...\"? I'm just trying to connect to the server hosting my website through Finder, but it's always read only, even though I'm logging in with my username and password.\nObviously, I can connect with an FTP client (Fetch), and through the terminal, etc. – but what's the trick to FTP-uploading with Finder?\n\nA: From Apple Support:\n\nYou can use the Connect To Server command to connect to an FTP server in the Finder, but you will have read-only access. You cannot copy, or upload, to an FTP volume in the Finder.\n\n", "Q: Can Windows Vista be installed on Mac OS X 10.6.6? I heard that as of Mac OS X 10.6.6, Apple removed wording about installing Vista via Boot Camp, suggesting that they are no longer supporting it.\nIf I have Mac OS X 10.6.6 installed, can I still install a full version of Vista on it?\n\nA: Yes, according to Apple's Snow Leopard Specs.\n\nBoot Camp:\n  requires Windows XP with\n  Service Pack 2 or Windows Vista (sold\n  separately).\n\nAlso, you can install Windows 7 if you update Boot Camp. Info here.\n", "Q: Is a rented movie tied to the download PC? Before I left work today I downloaded a rental movie in iTunes then copied the m4v to a USB key and took it home to watch. However I now can't play the file on my home PC: iTunes asks me to authorise my computer to play films purchased on my account, then when I enter my password it tells me my PC is already authorised but doesn't start the movie. Pressing play brings up the prompt again. Deauthorising and reauthorising the PC acted the same.\nDoes this mean the rental is tied to the machine that downloaded it, my work PC? I did not start the movie there - I simply downloaded it then copied the file. The FAQ, which I had't read beforehand, says:\n\nIf you download a rented movie on your computer: You can transfer it to a device such as your Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, or iPod if it’s a standard-definition film (movies in HD can only be watched on your computer, iPad, iPhone 4, iPod touch (4th generation), or Apple TV). Once you move the movie from your computer to a device, the movie will disappear from your computer's iTunes library. You can move the movie between devices as many times as you wish during the rental period, but the movie can only exist on one device at a time.\n\nIt doesn't discuss moving films between computers. Is that possible? The disappear bit does make me think the ITMS remembers which device the movie is officially on. Is there any way for me to recover this, or will I have to watch the film at work? I rented HD and only have a 2G iPod touch so I can't copy it to that.\nThanks. Both machines are PCs running the latest iTunes, 10.1.1.\n\nA: Without using an iPod that supports HD movies then no. You are correct in thinking that it is tied to the device Apple thinks it is on.\nSource: See Update at the bottom\n", "Q: Why can't I sign into the Mac App Store after updating to 10.6.6?

It's got the ADC connector, so I'm not sure if it's relevant what the size is (and frankly I'm too lazy to measure unless it is). I'm looking to drive this off of my MacBook Pro, and her MacBook, both using Mini DisplayPort.\nIt looks like the prescribed solution is to daisy-chain the Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter with a DVI to ADC adapter, but there's two issues with this:\n1) It costs $130. Ouch.\n2) The DVI to ADC adapter looks discontinued on the US store.\nIs anyone familiar with a cheaper solution that doesn't involve ordering an adapter from the UK?\nhttp://store.apple.com/uk/product/M8661B/B\nDVI to ADC adapter, UK store, £70.46\nThanks in advance for any information.\n(Apparently my StackOverflow reputation doesn't cross over so I can only post one link until I get 10 reputation, so I elected to post the harder to find one. Googling for \"apple mini displayport to dvi adapter\" will find you the other one.)\n\nA: Either get one from ebay as (Mike Scott suggested) or Google for a DVI to ADC adaptor. The looking I did suggests that the UK one may actually be the cheapest. \nThe reason they are so expensive is that ADC carries the DVI connection, USB, and the monitor's power. (That's right: no separate power cord.) Any DVI to ADC adapter you get will, at a minimum, have to plug into your mini DisplayPort adapter and into the wall. Here's Apple's compatibility matrix, but their store links no longer work.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I think your best bet is probably to pick up a second-hand DVI to ADC adaptor on eBay -- it probably won't be much cheaper, but it will be quicker.\n\nA: A cheaper, although not as good, solution is ScreenRecycler. It costs $29.99 (with academic discounts available), but it operates over VNC, requiring the screen to be attached to a dedicated host machine, and over the network. I tried it with a PowerMac G4 on 802.11a/b and it was pretty slow, but it should work like a champ over a wire.\nhttp://www.screenrecycler.com/ScreenRecycler.html\n", "Q: 24' iMac HDMI input solution? Are there any solutions available which will allow HDMI input on my 24' iMac?\n\nA: Your possibilities port-wise for a 24\" iMac are Ethernet, USB, and FireWire. \nI've seen interesting stuff done with converting DVI video on another computer to send over Ethernet, but not at the quality I imagine you're looking for with HDMI.\nUSB suffers on video. It wasn't designed to handle consistent, high levels of data that represents video.\nLet's skip this.\nNow FireWire: FireWire's largest users are those who work with video data, and your 24\" iMac has both a FW400 and FW800 port on the back. With this in-mind I went 'google-ing' and found this:\nThomson Grass Valley ADVC-HD50\nHope this ends up being a worthy solution for you, I had difficulty finding any alternatives.\nNote: I wouldn't assume this thing will handle HDCP.\n\nA: No, there aren't. The 24\" iMacs don't take video input of any kind. If you had a 27\" iMac, then it would take Mini DisplayPort input, and you might be able to find an HDMI to Mini DisplayPort converter.\n", "Q: why does itunes \"optimize\" my photos every time i sync Every time I sync my ipod touch, I sit there and watch \"optimizing photos x of 1000\" which takes forever. \nTo be clear, I am not adding any more photos.  Shouldn't this only be a one time thing to optimize photos?\nWhy does it need to do this step every time?\n\nA: I not sure why it does it every time, but the 'optimising' is basically shrinking their dimensions to the iPod screen size, thus saving space on the iPod.\nI would therefore assume that it does it every time as it doesn't save the 'optimised' ones in order to save space on the computer.\n\nA: Is this on a windows computer or a Mac OS computer?\nCheck properties in itunes for options related to photos.\nIf you're on Mac OS check the iPhoto program for similar \"ipod\" options.\n", "Q: Why won't my MacBook Pro automatically sleep? I have my MacBook set to go to sleep after 2 minutes while on battery (via the Energy Saver preference pane.) However, when I leave it idle, it only turns off the screen—it does not actually sleep. This means that if I leave it and forget to close the lid, it always ends up with a dead battery.\nThe system sleeps correctly if it is triggered manually ( – Sleep) or by closing the lid. I have tested it with no USB devices connected and on a fresh user account, on the chance a background program was preventing sleep. There is no relevant information printed to the Console at the time when the system should sleep.\nI've performed a PRAM and SMC reset to no avail, as well as the usual superstitious Verify Disk Permissions.\nIs there anything else I should try before I reinstall OS X?\nThis is a MacBookPro5,5 running OS 10.6.6.\nIt's worth noting that I suffered from this issue some time ago due to a bug in a helper daemon for the product Things, but that this issue was slightly different and involved display sleep. Also, I have verified that the helper daemon was not running during my tests.\nAdditional information:\nI started working through the Apple document titled \"Why your Mac might not sleep or stay in sleep mode.\" I discovered that this issue does not appear when I Safe Boot my computer. I diff'd the process lists and discovered that the following programs are only running when in normal boot, and are thus possible culprits:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quick Look Helper\n\n*cvmsComp_x86_64\n\n*kextcache              \n\n*launchd                \n\n*mdworker               \n\n*mdworker               \n\n*nmblookup              \n\n*vmnet-bridge           \n\n*vmnet-dhcpd            \n\n*vmnet-dhcpd            \n\n*vmnet-natd             \n\n*vmnet-netifup          \n\n*vmnet-netifup\n\nA: To help debug sleeping issues, try the pmset command in the terminal:\n$ pmset -g assertions\n\nAssertion status system-wide:\n   ChargeInhibit                           0\n   PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep             0\n   PreventUserIdleSystemSleep              1\n   NoRealPowerSources_debug                0\n   CPUBoundAssertion                       0\n   EnableIdleSleep                         1\n   PreventSystemSleep                      0\n   DisableInflow                           0\n   DisableLowPowerBatteryWarnings          0\n   ExternalMedia                           0\n\nListed by owning process:\n  pid 2520: [0x0000012c000009d8] PreventUserIdleSystemSleep named: \"com.apple.audio.'AppleHDAEngineOutput:1B,0,1,2:0'.noidlesleep\" \n\nIn this case, it's the process 2520 messing up.

It’s extremely frustrating. I went so far as to completely reinstall OS X, which didn’t solve the issue. This leads me to believe that it’s likely a hardware issue in my case.\nI’ve given up troubleshooting the issue and just use PleaseSleep.\n\nPleaseSleep is a utility software designed for Mac OS X that helps put your computer to sleep when you know some other app is preventing your Mac from going to sleep.\nPleaseSleep sits in the background and waits for the sleep timer you set in Energy Saver preferences pane. Depending on the preferences you set, PleaseSleep will try to put your computer to sleep when the scheduled sleep timer kicks in. PleaseSleep is very easy to configure, you can enable, disable, and access its preferences via the system menu bar icon. You can choose to have PleaseSleep activate the sleep function all the time, or you can tell PleaseSleep to activate the sleep function only when certain apps are running.\n\n\nA: I finally have my system reliably idle-sleeping again. I changed three things to reach this point, all of which I believe were contributors:\n\n\n*\n\n*I was low on disk space (less than 5% free) on my primary volume. The kernel was complaining about this to system.log (viewable in Console.app) about the time it should have been sleeping.\n\n*I disabled Dropbox, which accesses the disk frequently and obnoxiously, and is reported to prevent sleep in Snow Leopard.\n\n*I upgraded from an embarrassingly old Chromium nightly, and I'm now on 11.0.658.0 (73560). There are several bugs open about this Chrome/Chromium preventing idle sleep. However, I discovered this only after getting the system to idle sleep after a reboot with no programs running.\nTechnical observations follow:\nIt's worth noting that the Energy Saver preference pane lies a little bit. I have it set to sleep and turn off the screen after 1 minute, but the system doesn't actually go to sleep for 3 minutes and 30 seconds, give or take a few seconds to write the Safe Sleep image. The screen actually takes 2 minutes to go to sleep. I suspect this is a case of Apple knowing better than us—1 minute is probably just too fast. Regardless, this makes debugging issues like this hard because you have to wait longer than indicated to see if the system is really going to sleep.\nThat these two applications were contributors despite not doing anything particularly intensive suggests that Snow Leopard changed something about how the system decides whether idle sleep can occur. There is a documented API for disabling idle sleep, but it also appears that disk activity (specifically writes) more than once a minute also resets the sleep timer and thus delays sleep. Any application that writes frequently is thus a possible cause. sudo fs_usage -e grep -f filesys | grep -e write in a Terminal window can help reveal culprits.\n\nA: Might be Spotlight indexing.  You could test this by going to System Preferences > Spotlight > Search Results and unchecking everything.  Then see if your MacBook goes to sleep.\n", "Q: Why is Google maps (the built-in app) so slow on the iPhone 4? My Google Maps app for iOS has gotten too slow to be useful at times.  It doesn't seem to be a bandwidth issue, as it even affects typing- there's often meaningful lag from when i type a letter until it appears.\nI've tried a full restart.    Any ideas?\n\nA: From a MacRumors.com forum post:\n\nMy problem: Typing on the Google Maps app was very slow, independent of network connection.\nMy solution: Apparently there are issues with the GPS multitasking. I went to Settings > General > Location Services. Notice you can toggle the GPS for each app. Apps using the GPS have a purple arrow next to the ON/OFF switch. I turned location services off for every other app with the purple arrow. I went back to the Google Maps application and everything worked well.\nThis might not work for everyone but it worked for me.\n\n\nA: I had this problem. None of the suggested fixes worked. I deleted the app from my phone, then reloaded it. When asked about the app tracking my location, I opted for \"Always\" and the app has worked fine ever since.\n", "Q: One Note alternative for Mac? For some time I've been using the combination of FreeMind and One Note on my Windows machine. About a month ago I migrated to Mac and now I'm trying to search for an alternative.\nSo far I've tried Personal Brain, but it has quite a heavy interface and I don't really like the workflow.\nWhat app(s) would you recommend for managing larger amounts of information on tasks and projects?\n\nA: You have many choices but none of them as good as One Note (It's just my opinion)\n\n\n*\n\n*Omnioutliner\n\n*Journler\n\n*Macjournal\n\n*EverNote\n\nA: Growly Notes is totally free (and very close to the look of oneNote)\nhttp://www.growlybird.com/GrowlyBird/Notes.html\nHowever, nothing is as good as oneNote (if that is what you like).  You can install OneNote 2007 in OSX using crossover (basically 'wine').  This doesn't work with oneNote 2010, only 2007.  It starts quickly and works perfectly.  The only problem I can see is that hot linking crashes oneNote.\nIf you do try to install, look for the oneNote 2007 custom setup in crossover, if during setup it complains about fonts etc... just keep going with the install, and skip and problems.  OneNote 2007 will run fine under OSX 10.6\nhttp://www.codeweavers.com/products/impersonator/\nIf you are looking for something a little different, but just as addictive to use as oneNote, I would recommend trying a program called Scrivener.  It is one of the few programs I've found to be perfect for writing & organising my thoughts.\nhttp://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php\nYou mentioned freemind (mind mapping), I would totally recommend a program called Vue, it's free too, very slick, and not as linear as freemind, also allows you to add notes, keywords, layers etc.. to organise your data.\nhttp://vue.tufts.edu/\nI've used all of the other suggested apps (evernote, yojimbo, etc..) I do like them, and use them.  But I hope that I have highlighted a few very useful/nice apps, that most people don't know about.\n\nA: *\n\n*Things\n\n*OmniFocus\n\n\nand another vote for Evernote.\nAll three offer a form of syncing across devices.\n\nA: I'm currently evaluating DEVONthink and it seems to be a better, if more complicated, alternative to Yojimbo. They have an iOS app (a bit on the expensive side and rough around the edges but usable nonetheless). You can evaluate the product for 150 hours of runtime. \nEvernote is the go-to solution, though, if you need to access your data on different platforms and don't care much about syncing manually.\n\nA: Yojimbo. It only works on Mac OS X though. There's no Windows variant (unlike Evernote)\n\nA: Evernote is great if you're working with multiple computers (including smartphones and tablets) but it doesn't have all of OneNote's features.\n\nA: I have used Things to track to-do items and loved the UI and it's capabilities. They have a great iPhone and iPad app but I strongly disliked the syncing capabilities between the phone, pad and the desktop. It syncs via the network. Not a big deal but it got on my nerves after awhile. If you are using one or more desktops only though, I would highly recommend this as a task tracker.\nI use Yojimbo for research on my macs. I like the bookmarklets for Safari. They work quite well and it is great for throwing all kinds of information in and tagging it. You can create smart folders based on those tags. Again, I would note that the iPhone app is a bit lacking right now. Syncing is done via .mac only at this time. Which might be one of the few good reasons to buy the service. If you are using more than one PC or you want to data gather on a mobile device, I would say that Evernote is a better solution.\n", "Q: iPod Touch 2G broken screen A friend broke her iPod Touch 2G. Additionally, some water got inside. Now the iPod sometimes doesn't start at all, or just freezes and doesn't react to finger touches.\nThere isn't any background light anymore (or at least, I don't remember there was or if there wasn't)\nBecause there's no explicit digitizer included in some offers, my question is, is it even possible to seperate the front glass and the digitizer? \nMy position is that, if there's a cable attached to it, there must be a digitizer too but the owner of the device disagrees with my opinion, so I am asking here for a definitive answer.\n\nA: I haven't seen them sold separately. I imagine it is possible, but good luck finding one or the other by itself.\nYou can get the \"front panel\" assembly here ($70), which includes: touchscreen glass, integrated digitizer, metal frame and home button. Install directions here.\nThe front glass and digitizer should fix the touchscreen problems, but you probably will need a new display to fix the backlight (I haven't seen the light sold separate from the display). You can get that here ($60), with install directions here.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Why does my keyboard switch language in most input fields on the web? I'm basically using US keyboard as my default, but I also have enabled Czech (QWERTY), which has quite different layout for when I need those special characters.\nThe problem is, that in the past few days whenever I put focus in a password field in Google Chrome, it automatically switches from the US to Czech and I can't switch back, as it is grayed out.\n\nBut once I click out of the password field, I can change it back without any problems. What could possibly cause this? I'm using OS X 10.6.6 on Macbook Pro if that's of any relevance.\n\nA: I've had weird input-switching behavior before when the keyboard shortcut to switch input sources was the same as something else I was using, like Quicksilver.  Try disabling or changing the relevant shortcuts in System Preferences (under Keyboard & Text Input).\nUPDATE: Detailed instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Open the Keyboard preference (under Hardware)\n\n*Select Keyboard and Text on the left\n\n*Find \"Select the previous input source\" in the box on the right and uncheck it.  Its shortcut was probably set to Command-Space.\n\n\nA: I could solve the issue by performing the following steps in Chrome:\n\n\n*\n\n*disabling all chrome extensions\n\n*disable chrome extension developer mode\n\n*quit and restart chrome\n\n*enabling the previous settings again\n\n\nA: I'm having the same problem. I ended up just disabling the other two layouts and the problem stopped. Certainly frustrating, when you can't figure out why you're typing gibberish.\n", "Q: Can I stream music from my laptop to my iPod Touch over wifi? Rather than running a long cable from my Laptop to my stereo, I've been thinking for a while about getting one of those wireless devices that lets you transmit audio from your PC to a receiver plugged into the stereo.\nThen I realised I already have hardware that can potentially do this - I have an iPod Touch, and a Wi-Fi network in the house.\nSo, is there some iPod Touch App that will let the iPod act as a Wi-Fi music receiver? And presumably, a corresponding piece of broadcast software for my (Windows Vista) Laptop?\nedit: Bonus points for a solution that lets me stream all audio from the laptop, rather than just streaming music tracks.\n\nA: You can use the Windows version of Airfoil to send any audio to an Airport Express connected to a stereo.  The page above claims it can do the same via an iPod Touch as well.  And you can try it for free.\n\nA: You can also share your iTunes library on your Mac of PC and then stream your music from your computer to your iPod touch by selecting that shared iTunes library in the Music app on your iPod touch.\nThis solution doesn't require any extra software or app.\n\nA: On the road I use the Simplify Media application to do this. It requires an application to be installed on both the computer and the iPod touch/iPhone. Once installed I can play almost any track from my desktop to my iPod touch.\nHowever at my house the simplest solution I have found is to use an Airport Express. I use iTunes to manage my music and then choose to play it on the Airport Express which is connected to my stereo in the living room. I can then use my iPod touch as a remote for iTunes to control what plays.\n\nA: You can use the wifi2hifi app to stream any audio from your Mac but not on your PC to your iOS device.\n", "Q: How do you use your iPhone as a usb key? I saw a friend of mine manage to use his iPhone as a usb key. I had a large file that I needed to transfer to his computer. So he gave me his iPhone cable, had me open iTunes, open his iPhone in iTunes, select some app that was on his iPhone, drag and drop my file there, and then he could get the file to his machine.\nWhich app was he using? I want it, too!\n\nA: I haven't tried it yet, but from this description, it looks like Air Sharing is what I want.\n\nA: Also try Dropbox which is useful even just on Macs no iOS devices. If file is put into a public share then you could see it on your PC as well not just his.\n\nA: Not 100% relevant to the OP, but given the prices of flash memory these days and the hurdles one has to jump through to transfer arbitrary data to/from iOS devices I wouldn't recommend it.\nIf the user instead wants to access/modify the data while it's on the device the practice makes sense, but otherwise it is much more convenient today to just have a USB thumbdrive handy.\n(BTW: The app in question was indeed likely to be Air Sharing, an app that's been available almost as long as the SDK has.)\n\nA: He has probably installed USB Drive. It's a very simple application to convert your iphone as a USB key. I tried both on Windows and Mac and it works with ITunes. On windows you need to reboot to use the Drive Only Mode.\n", "Q: Get rid of text slide in iphoto 11 slide show I added a text slide to a slideshow. I can't get rid of it. If I delete it, the neighboring picture gets deleted, too. If I re-add the picture, the text slide reappears with it.\n\nA: The Title slides in iPhoto work in an odd way.\nWhen you create a title slide iPhoto uses the first photo as the title and then puts text over it.\nSo when you delete it you are deleting the photo with the text on it.\nTo remove the text click on the photo, and in the settings pane, uncheck Show Title Slide'.\nIf you want to add a proper title slide it is better to create it in PowerPoint, Keynote, Paint, Photoshop etc, and save as either a JPEG or PDF and import that as a photo into iPhoto.\n", "Q: Are there personal finance applications offering both an iPhone and a mac version? With the demise of Cha-ching, I find myself in need of an application for managing my expenses which I can use on both platforms.\nIt should work in Europe, and maybe have a decent UI.\n\nA: Add MoneyWell to the list\n\nA: You have iCompta which is the one I use. Well followed by its developer, with upgrades and a quick support through dedicated forum.\nI must admit I was used to Money on PC and wanted to have something which doesn't change my (good or bad) habits too much. It's a good one for this.\n\nA: iBank and SplashMoney do what you want. I haven't tested either.iBank looks like a nicer interface, but costs a lot more.\n\nA: Not an application but mint.com runs in any browser on the desktop and has an iPhone app. Mint is like throwing all of you money up in the air and it lands in neat little stacks with labels. Mint is free.\nI have no affiliation with Mint, I just like it.\n\nA: iBank is a very good desktop application and I found it to be a more than adequate replacement for Microsoft Money when I moved to the Mac.\nThere is a companion iPhone app which I haven't used yet, but apparently it can sync to the desktop app via WiFi (Bonjour), MobileMe and any WebDAV server. (If they supported DropBox it would be ideal for me and I'd have bought it by now).\n(Edit: I should add that I downloaded and evaluated iBank against MoneyWell - for me iBank won hands down though for the life of me now I can't remember why. I think the overall experience just seemed better).\nHTH,\nMaurice\n\nA: I use You Need a Budget. It's a great little app, and also has a mobile version that is really nice.\n\nA: I just found out http://www.squirrelapp.com/, which looks quite bare-bones, but has the required features.\n", "Q: Can iTunes ignore store credit and use a credit card instead? There are times when I've got some store credit from a gift card/certificate on iTunes, but I want to buy something without that. \nI want to buy something with the credit card, regardless of what's prepaid on the account.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Sadly for you, iTunes uses credit in the store before using a credit card.\n\nA: According to Apple's page, it uses the following order for song purchases:\n\n\n*\n\n*Song credits.\n\n*Gift certificate, prepaid card, or allowance credits.\n\n*Credit cards.\n\n\nThus, it would appear that you cannot charge a credit card without using up your credits or gift certificates first.\nHowever, similar to what @Nick said, you could just open up another account, add the credit card to it, and then gift the items you want to your original account.\nUpdate: Based on my own tests of self-gifting, these are my findings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gifts will deduct money from the credit card on your account; they will not use up song credits nor gift card credit. This means that you do not need to open another account, just add it as a credit card and gift it to yourself.\n\n*You cannot send a gift to the same email address as your iTunes account. This can easily be circumvented by sending it to one of your other email accounts.\n\n*The easiest method of gifting to yourself is to select the print option. It will show you a code which you then use to redeem the song. It will allow you to redeem the code on the same account.\n\n\nA: I think if you \"gift\" something you will use a credit card instead of store credit since you can't buy a gift with store credit.\n", "Q: Can i Print to a dell 3010cn from Snow Lepoard i have a dell 3010cn printer, and a iMac\nhaving some trouble getting it installed, i know that its not officially supported but i installed foomatic-rip and ghostscript and downloaded the pxldpl PPD file but i wont actually print though it can connect to the printer\nthe printer is connected to my LAN\n\nA: I was able to achieve success.\nOn my Ubuntu box I got it to print over wifi, \nAnd on the mac I could print through the Ubuntu Box as a print server.\nI used the windows box I have as a server and it worked.

This has    wired and wireless connections. \nBoth    Airports have static IPs and are on    the same subnet and all set to the    same channel (1) as the ESR-9752.  I    can see them all from the ESR-9752.    APXn (Maddie) has the latest    firmware, Airtunes turned on and is    connected to my new speakers.\nI know Maddie is working, because I am also using the ethernet port to connect our BlueRay player to the internet through it's connection.\nMaddie this morning was playing music.\nI can not see Maddie from the Airport Utility or when I try to connect using her MAC.\nAPXb/g (Xena) is sitting in a room 45 feet away pretending to extend the network (bruno) but I think she just sits there with a green light to make me feel better.\nWe no not have any cordless phones in the apt.

None of the others, nor will our iPhones see Maddie.\nI accepted the fact that my 5 year old APX may be going and shelled out for a new one - but that does not seem to be the trick.\nWith 2 AP Expresses here - how can I reliably stream the music from iTunes on all of our devices to at least one of them?\n\nA: I've seen that on a couple of them, and the problem seems to be tied to IPv6 support. Mine would drop connections randomly, sometimes requiring a reboot of the AirPort Express before it would return to the network.\nTurning off IPv6 entirely in the Network Control panel of our Macs seems to have fixed it. I can stream music to it for hours now without problems, so give that a try.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, which I believe I solved by turning off a \"flood limit\" feature that was enabled on my main router.\nHave a look at your EnGenius ESR-9752's configuration pages. Check the firewall settings. If there's anything that seems like it's set to \"limit bursting traffic,\" try disabling it. Also, make sure these TCP/UDP ports are open, and that MAC address filtering is disabled.\nAnd if changing firewall settings doesn't help, be sure to revert any changes to avoid security issues.\n", "Q: Can I use 45/60/85W MagSafe era MacBook chargers interchangeably? I have a 13\" Macbook Pro that came with a 60W power adapter and a 15\" Macbook Pro that came with a 85W power adapter. There seems to be disagreement in the Apple forums.\nCan I use either adapter with any portable Mac?\n\nA: There is a lot of misinformation in some answers. I will give some facts along with my reasoning.\nAll MagSafe adapters, when plugged into a mechanically matching receptacle on a MacBook/MacBook Pro, are designed to run safely. This is a given for the systems to receive safety certifications. So no, a 60W adapter won't overheat when connected to a machine that needs an 85W adapter. It will clearly run at full capacity for longer than a higher wattage adapter or even fail to keep up with the energy demands of a machine using more than 60w giving you a flat battery if you run a deficit of energy “while charging”.\nThe MacBook it's plugged into won't operate in a \"brownout\". It will operate safely, but the CPU performance will be diminshed. The below explains why.\nA MacBook's power management works very simply: it maintains a balance of power between the power consumed by the loads and the power available from the sources. There are two sources of power:\n\n*\n\n*power adapter,\n\n*battery as a power source.\n\nThere are two loads:\n\n*\n\n*battery charger,\n\n*the machine (logic, drives, memory, screen, speakers, USB devices, etc.)\n\nBoth loads are adjustable and the power management's function is to adjust them as needed.\nThe battery as a power source is exclusive of the battery charger: a battery may operate as a power source, or the battery charger may operate, but never both at once.\nThe power management must maintain the following inequality balanced, in terms of power: (power adapter + battery as a power source) >= (battery charger + the machine). The loads are prioritized: the machine has priority over the battery charger. The power management system also knows the electronic nameplate of the power supply and thus its rated power.\nThus, given an available input power, the machine load is satisfied first, and any leftover power is provided to the battery charger. If there isn't enough power left for the charger, the battery is by definition discharging unless it has no charge left. This is important. Conversely, a fully charged battery will demand a zero charger load, and that's fine.\nIf there isn't enough power for the machine, the load shedding kicks in and throttles the CPU (and perhaps GPU - I don't recall offhand). The CPU load shedding will, by design, always manage to balance the power. The 60W supply, even if connected to a 17 inch MBP, will satisfy all internal and external loads (USB, FW, drives, screen), except for the CPU and GPU. So the latter will be throttled to maintain the power balance. That's why the performance will be poor with an inadequate power supply.\nSince the machine load takes priority and doesn't shed until there's insufficient power available, the battery will be always discharging whenever the supply can't provide sufficient power to cover the machine's needs. This means that with a 60W charger, the battery will charge only during light CPU load. If you have both cores going full-throttle, the battery will be always discharging until it reaches a zero charge state.\nThe rate at which the battery charges will also depend on the machine load. The battery charger can consume up to ~30W or so. With an 85W adapter, that leaves about 55W for the machine, and it's insufficient to power a full machine load. Since the machine load takes precedence, the power available to the charger will vary depending on the entirety of the machine load: CPU/GPU, drives, USB/FireWire, screen, etc. With a very high machine load, the charger is left with very little power to use, even with an 85W supply, and will take very long to charge the battery. The longest I've seen was 20+ hours with everything going full blast (full CPU+GPU load, all USB and FireWire ports delivering full rated power, all drives spinning, screen at full brightness, speakers blaring).\nFinally, the supply's electronic nameplate is stored in the chip residing in the MagSafe jack. If the MagSafe jack is damaged or doesn't have the nameplate chip, the power manager does two things:\n\n*\n\n*Assumes a 60W power supply.\n\n\n*Disables the battery charger.\n\nA: Apple's official word on the matter is:\n\nMake sure the proper wattage adapter for your portable computer is used.\n  Select the appropriate power adapter for your Apple portable computer. You can use a higher wattage power adapter, but you cannot use one with less wattage without potential operating issues. (here + discussion here). \n\nSo your 13\" can use your 15\" charger, but not vice versa. \nI've never heard of it voiding a warranty (nor experienced it when we've used the wrong charger), but it's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nA: I did use a 13'/65W power adapter on my 15'er for a long time.\nWhat happened with me was that the battery got significantly bloated (visible from the outer aluminim shell and only after ~150 loadcycles) while still delivering proper batterylife...\nPlease take into consideration that this might be completely unrelated, probably. Plus my battery was replaced at no cost in an Apple store (Macbookpro late 2008, 1st gen unibody) while I'm still not sure if Applecare also covers the battery on 3yrs.\n\nA: Do NOT use a lower-than-spec'd power-supply with your portable. It will power on, but will be running in a brown-out condition, causing shortened life due to excessive heat.\nWe found this out the hard way with an after market power-supply on an iBook. It was just under the needed power output, causing the unit to always run hot, and eventually shutting down because of too much heat. After several months it got so it would run for 10-20 minutes then turned off, and eventually quit entirely. We tried getting it repaired, but it was too far gone.\n\nA: You will not harm anything using the incorrect adapter. The charging circuitry in Intel Macs is very sophisticated and won't let anything bad happen.\nUsing the higher-wattage adapter with a low-power-requirement notebook will work. The computer will only draw as much power from the adapter as it needs.  Using the low-wattage adapter on a high-draw notebook will result in the adapter powering the computer OR charging the battery, but not both. If you plug a 60W adapter in to a MacBook Pro at 50% battery charge, the battery will just stay at 50% (or either drain or charge very slowly) while the computer is on. If the computer is asleep or shut down, the battery will charge at a normal rate.  \n\nA: I took a close look at my '65W' adapter.  Apparently, it's not a 65W adapter after all, but an 85W with the older connector (the fat head connector).  I always assumed it was 65W because of the age of our 2006 MBP... I guess the guy we bought it from used had replaced the adapter. You may want to check yours closely since they can get mixed up.\n\nA: I have been using the 60w adapter from my old 13\"macbook pro(which was stolen a while ago) for my new 15\" macbook pro for about a month because I assumed that all the cables or adapters are the same from Apple(since it is the case for the usb cable) and I did not realize until one day it turned off itself. Most of the time, my macbook pro was connected to the power. Now I have switched to the 85w adapter and everything works fine, thank god. my question is: will this cause any issue or damage to my battery or hard drive or other parts of my macbook pro?\n\nA: Update. Apple has added a support page to break this down. Note that the power adapter (square block) is a separate from the cable on USB Macs\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201700\nDisclaimer: I am not affiliated with Apple inc.\n\nA: I'm using a 60W power adapter for my 2009 15 MacBook Pro. It runs fine if I'm doing light tasks, however, if I'm running an intensive application like Starcraft 2 on Bootcamp the battery will stop charging and drain very slowly.\n\nA: I have both a Macbook Unibody from 2010 and a MacBook Pro early 2008. I swapped the adaptors and it works fine for both machines. Also, the MacBook Pro using the 60 W power adaptor is charging the battery, although it is a little bit slower.\n\nA: Is it a good idea? Nope. Does it work? Yes. The wattage rating is matched up with your particular laptop's needs. If you use a lower rated power supply, in many circumstances it will work ok, it may just charge a little bit slower. If your laptop is powered off, it'll charge decently fast too.\nHowever if you then boot into something less power efficient like linux or windows, you'll notice that despite being hooked up to a power supply, you are slowly losing battery life because there's simply not enough wattage to drive the whole thing and a lot of the power saving features aren't properly implemented. This also can be an issue if you have modified the hardware in your laptop, or if you try to do heavy gaming (anything that gets disks and fans spinning). If this is your situation, you can still use the lower power supply, but you're going to eventually hit a point where the transformer will overheat (really bad), or you will just run out of power.\nSo in a perfect world, you should always have the adapter that apple intended you to have (or a higher rated one). But if you have to use a lower rated one for a little while it won't be the end of the world.\n\nA: Just my two cents.\nI don't think this talk of \"Brown out\" is correct. The MacBook will always have enough power from the battery to operate without \"Brown out\". It's only when the battery gets critically low that the computer may think it's getting sufficient power to operate as it's plugged in but will probably be in a reduced performance mode due to the low voltage of the battery. This will manifest as operation of the computer being sluggish. As a battery nears \"empty\" it will produce more heat, so despite being in low performance, this may cause the fans to spin up, even though the computer isn't doing as much.\nTo prolong the life of a battery it's best to keep it at 50%, perhaps a bit more, especially if you're going to put the computer to sleep when unplugged as this will draw some power. If you're storing a laptop, make sure you charge it before hand and periodically top it up. If possible, remove the battery as this will slow the discharge.\nSo I believe that a low wattage adapter is fine if you only use it to charge the laptop when it's sleeping or off. If you use the adapter while operating the computer then I would keep a careful eye on battery level and stop using it when power gets to say 10%.\nIt's bad to store your computer fully charged as this will age the battery but it's even more detrimental to store your computer fully discharged as some power will still be used, even if the computer is off, and the battery charge will drop below \"0%\" and this will kill your battery faster than anything else and cause battery bloat. Puffed batteries are always a symptom of fully discharging it.\nI have experience with RC batteries that have no intelligence built in. There is however some management built into the systems they're plugged into. I have LiPo batteries that are 12 years old that still perform ok because I make sure to try and store them at 60-70%, or at least not fully charged or discharged.\n", "Q: iBooks automatically generating cover pages for PDFs? I've loaded some lengthy PDFs onto my iPad in iBooks, and I've noticed that for only one of them, it's seemed to have created a beige cover page for the PDF thumbnail with what looks like the file name. It's nice, but I was unaware of this feature and ideally I'd like it to include the author and paper title instead of the file name. Does anyone know more about this functionality or how I can change what this new cover page says?\n\nA: I am pretty sure the thumbnail is created from the first page in the pdf document.\nSo to alter the icon you could add another coverpage to the pdf document.\n\nA: If you open the PDF in Preview on a Mac, you can drag/drop page thumbnails around (hold option to copy a page) and even drag a page from one PDF into another.\nThis way you can use the print system's \"Save as PDF\" feature to set anything as the first page.\nAlternatively switch from bookshelf view to list view, where you can see the filenames.\n", "Q: any bluetooth keyboards with integrated pointing device (trackball/trackpad)? I'm looking for a keyboard and pointing device which I can use when my laptop is plugged into my TV. It needs to be able to connect to the laptop via bluetooth (I want to minimize the time and effort connecting the laptop), and the pointing device must be integrated into it.\nI'm having a big problem finding a device to fit the bill online. I would have thought it was a very popular problem, and that there'd be plenty of devices out there... I've considered buying a bluetooth keyboard and \"apple magic trackpad\", which would be perfect if they were one unit...\nThe laptop is a macbook. I don't care if it's designed for windows, so long as it works with OS X.\nRecommendations?\n\nA: The Logitech diNovo Edge keyboard has a little trackpad on it. It's got a Mac version (~$150).\nAlso, the Adesso SlimTouch Wireless Mini Touchpad Keyboard for Mac (~$110) looks okay. I haven't used this brand, though.\n\nA: Fentek has a mini bluetooth keyboard with nubbin which seems to be perfectly suitable, and it's about $50.\nThere's also an Aldesso bluetooth mouse-keyboard for about $130.\n\nA: If you need rugged solution and price is no object try\nhttps://www.keyboardspecialists.co.uk/Shop/KBS/Product/2992/BT-87-TP/iKeyBT-87-TPDesktopBluetoothKeyboard.aspx\n", "Q: Why is the current provisioning process for iPhone development implemented the way it is? Given the large number of examples of issues with the manual steps necessary to provision devices and install apps using the developer SDK, I am wondering why Apple took this route.  \nSpecifically, the process seems to be error-prone and could likely be automated.  \nIs this just a rite of passage or are there reasons for implementing it this way that I am missing?\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there reasons some of these steps HAVE to be manual?\n\n*Does anyone see a way of improving this or does anyone know of some automation/scripts that make this simpler for developers new to the platform?\n\n\nA: The biggest issue is the key generation. The hardcore security of iOS is that only signed apps are allowed to run on your devices, unless you've jailbroken it and installed a package to bypass this, typically for non-licensed deploying or app pirating.\nYou need to generate a key based on Apple's certificate authority, or CA. Then you upload it to the portal and Apple approves it, provided you're a paid developer. Whenever you deploy an app, be it to the store or to your device for testing, you sign the app with your digital signature, which is backed by Apple. This tells your device, or your testers' or customer's devices, that the app is from a developer who is who he says he is. Since the main way to get an app on your device is through the store, you have the confidence that it is not tampered with (since the developer's signature is invalid with the flip of a single bit in the app) and that it's passed through Apple's checks by being hosted on the store. This is a two-fold assurance of the security.\nProvisioning profiles are a whole other beast. Previously, Apple would let you \"sideload\" an app to any number of devices you wanted. This meant that you could bypass the App Store and sell apps yourself as a download, no different than desktop apps. Apple didn't approve of this and has since limited it to 100 devices per year being listed on a single developers account. You add your devices to the portal by it's UDID, it's unique fingerprint, and you would need to get this from any devices you wish to beta test your app or adhoc deploy to. Since it costs roughly $0.99 / year / device, it's prohibitively expensive to sell apps this way, but it allows you to have plenty of beta testing slots. Of course, a provisioning profile is the list of which devices can run which apps signed by who developer.\nIn recent Xcode's, once you've established your key (which would be difficult to automate from inside Xcode), you can plug in any iDevice, open the organizer and click \"Use for Development\". Xcode will prompt for your credentials and then automatically add the device to the portal and create a provisioning profile for you. Once you've done the initial setup, it's basically one-click to add an extra device. I don't think Apple is as worried about the initial setup being automated, since it's only a one-time process.\n(Sorry, I'm trying to work on my long-windedness.)\n\nA: The free TestFlight service aims to help with test app distribution, although I don't know if it makes it easier to test on your own device.\n\nA: I haven't seen a lot of speculation as to why they have it be this way other than to say that it's probably designed with device and user security in mind to keep the \"riff raff\" out of the process (i.e., creators of malicious software). You are, however, in good company with your frustrations regarding how the whole process works. Near as I can tell, outside of prepping a device for local, hard-wired testing, there is no way to automate any of this.\nIn the end, this is Apple's decision, and they have never said why it is this way. C'est la vie.\n", "Q: How to install iPhone apps through OTA without iTunes interaction? I am following this guide on how to install iPhone apps thru OTA without iTunes.\nI have the following questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*I only have a $99 developer program membership, not the enterprise program. The guide says this also works with normal ad-hoc distribution as well. Can I use my ad-hoc provisioning profile itself to do this?\n\n*I am testing with the iPhone 4 Simulator, as I don't have a physical iOS 4 device. But when I click on the \"Provisioning profile\" link, the simulator throws an error: \n\nCannot install profile. Safari could not install a profile due to unknown error.\n\nWhen I click on the .plist link as mentioned in the guide, it doesn't do anything that looks like this.\nCan I test this installation on the iPhone 4 simulator? What could be the reason for this failing?\n\nA: The Simulator does not use a bundled .ipa file; it uses the constituent application.  Furthermore, the Simulator runs an x86 version of the application with tweaked x86 versions of the iOS frameworks.  In other words, there is no good way to get an .ipa package to run in the Simulator.  The original developer could build for simulator then provide you with the relevant contents of ~/Library/Application\\ Support/iPhone\\ Simulator/User/Applications/ but that's really your only hope as far as I know.\n\nA: I know of two ways to install apps on iPhone without using iTunes: through a complicated process on a jailbreaken phone or through some 3rd party service.\n\nA: Testflight is Apple's inflight service for distributing betas. Absolutely helpful and valuable service. We are picked this service within minutes.\n", "Q: What app can I use to create mockups for websites?  I'm looking for a free or commercial software for Os X to create mockups for websites. Any suggestion?\n\nA: Balsamiq Mockups is a good one, fairly cheap and very good - http://balsamiq.com/\n\nA: You can do all sorts of fun things with Omnigraffle as well. And if you're looking for a way to make easy wireframes of current websites, you might do worse than checking out Wirify. Good luck!\n\nA: WireframeSketcher is a cross-platform rapid wireframing tool.\n\nA: For mocking up websites I swear by Adobe Fireworks, it might be overkill, but the abilty to have a library of buttons etc and set a master page that carries elements to all the other pages, so headers/footers etc only need to be changed once.\n\nA: Check out frame box—a \"lightweight online tool for creating mockups.\"\n\nA: Depending on the definition of \"mockup\", you might be interested in DENIM.\n\nDENIM is a system that helps web site\n  designers in the early stages of\n  design. DENIM supports sketching\n  input, allows design at different\n  refinement levels, and unifies the\n  levels through zooming.\n\n\nA: Just In Mind is probably one of the most extensive commercial website mockup apps, and Mockingbird is a fairly lightweight online mockup tool.\nIf you use Firefox 3, take a look at Pencil, a free wireframe sketching add-on. A version for Firefox 4 is available here, but I haven't tried it.\n\nA: You may try SwordSoft Layout. It also available on the App Store\n", "Q: How can I check if the motherboard has been replaced? An authorized repair center said  they changed the motherboard of my iMac 27\" but I have doubts since I can still experience the problem for what I had it repaired.\nI was told on a forum that if the computer's SN was invisible or started differently in the About this Mac menu it meant that the MB had been replaced.\nI'm seeing the same SN so it should mean that the MB was not replaced, but on the phone the repair guy said this method is wrong.\nWhat do you say ?\n\nA: The MAC address is linked to the logic board. So, if the logic board has been changed, MAC address will have changed too.\nI've been told this by a Genius et Genius Bar when he said they need to change my logic board and asked if my router was checking MAC address for allowing net access, as I will then have to reconfigure it.\nIt also seems to be backed-up by this technical note (look for first occurrence of \"logic board\").\nEdit: For your previous MAC addresses (ethernet and wifi and bluetooth, as I suppose they all change on a logic board exchange), you will find them on your computer's box, if you still have it (but it seems to be the case:)).

Since many days I am trying to achieve this, but I can only delete/ clear all recent dial, received phone numbers.\nIs there an option/ hack to delete only one number at a time on my iPhone ?\nI have iPhone 3GS\n\nA: You will have to wait for iOS 5 to be able to do what you are asking. I'm running iOS 5 and I'm able to do this without a jailbreak.\n\n\nA: If your iPhone is jailbroken you can install the package Ixtension (it's $9.99 from the BigBossRepo)\nDisclaimer: I'm in now way affiliated with the developers.\n\nA: Go to 'recents' on phone.

Does iOS 4.2.1, the latest release at the time of this question, support WebGL?\n\nA: Not at this point, no. WebKit, that which Safari for Mac OS and iOS are both based on, is supposed to support WebGL but I have yet to be able to get it work properly on Mac OS 10.6, much less iOS. I get the impression the whole thing is too new (relatively) for proper support.\n\nA: WebGL resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Main_Page\n\n*http://www.scriptol.com/programming/webgl.php\n\n*http://learningwebgl.com/blog/\n\n*https://developer.mozilla.org/en/WebGL\n\n*http://planet-webgl.org/\nLooks like its only in Webkit, and even then you have to enable it:\nMore info: http://webkit.org/blog/603/webgl-now-available-in-webkit-nightlies/\n\nA: I would not get your hopes up of iOs ever supporting WebGL. Not only because exposing the video drivers to untrusted parties poses a security risk. It would also give game developers a way to circumvent the app store for distributing games.

I know that you can change the format used by ⌘⇧3 and ⌘⇧4 (SE answer and external source), but is it also possible to change the format of Grab.app (uses TIFF)?\n\nA: Doesn't seem to be possible. Even the limited Help for Grab.app suggests using Preview to convert away from TIFF.

I use my iPhone 4 as a GPS device when I go tramping, but since the phone is constantly searching for signal in remote locations it drains through the battery extremely quickly. \nThe simple solution is to remove the sim card, although I've lost one microsim this way, and it's not an ideal solution.\nI'm looking for a method to disable the phone/transmitting functions, while still being able to use GPS. Does anyone know of any apps (I guess from the Cydia store - I doubt Apple would allow this) or method to achieve this?\nEdit: Just to be clear, what I'm meaning is that all transmitting functions on the iPhone are turned off - the only thing that should still be functioning is the GPS.\nThe 'phone' toggle in SBSettings doesn't work because it disables most things including GPS, and just leaves wifi enabled.\nUpdate: Just to be clear, the same result I'm looking for can be achieved by removing the microsim, it's just that it feels like there should be an easier way to accomplish this without removing the sim.\n\nA: If jailbroken, SBSettings allows one to turn off everything: Data, Wifi, Bluetooth, 3G, Edge, Phone, SSH, etc. but leave GPS enabled.\nIf not jailbroken, Settings > General > Network lets you turn off WiFi, 3G, BlueTooth, and Data, which leaves GPS, Edge, and Phone. Turn brightness all the way down. This ought to extend battery life quite a bit.\n\nA: I'd thought I'd share - the best way to do this without needing a paper clip and peeling off your case is to use the SIM PIN function. Turn it on (Settings->Phone-> SIM PIN) and reboot the phone. When it asks to unlock the SIM, just hit cancel. This will have the same effect as removing the SIM\nOf course do to this you'll need the SIM PIN. For AT&T the default is 1111. You should be able to get your SIM PIN from your carrier.\nNot sure if this works with non-SIM iPhones, i.e Verizon.\nhttp://adventurealan.com/iphone4gps.htm\n\nA: Your primary concern is battery life. The number one battery drainer is when the screen brightness is set higher than necessary. Also make sure Auto-Brightness is turned on. This will somewhat automate the process for you, but it unfortunately isn't as effective as manually adjusting the brightness as needed (while still keeping the Auto-Brightness setting turned on).\nThe next two things that drain a lot of battery (excluding GPS) is the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios. Turn them off as often as possible.\nNext I have found that GPS still functions when you turn off 3G and Cellular Data. Those certainly drain a bit of battery. The phone is, in fact, still functional after turning these off, but you should still get longer battery life by sticking with EDGE. And to answer your comment earlier, EDGE is used for for both voice and data. Perhaps the GPS radio is integrated into the cellular radio; possibly explaining the lack of independence here. The reason I suspect this is because the cheaper Wi-Fi iPad lacks GPS functionality.\nPerhaps even a reboot is a good idea to stop any multitasking apps from running in the background or even staying in memory. Also, I'm not sure if it's necessary to turn off Notifications if you already turned off Cellular Data, but it may help too. Especially if you left Cellular Data on, then you wanna at least turn off Notifications.\nAnd here's a thought, perhaps turning off MMS Messaging could also help...?\nAlternative options could be to simply turn off your phone completely between uses or to switch back and forth between Airplane Mode as needed. And finally perhaps a phone call to Apple may clear things up.\nP.S. I also just thought of one more idea, there are ways to disable multitasking with various Cydia apps once jailbroken. I'd imagine this would drain less battery if you turned that off as well.\n\nA: Yet to test but found this in another thread\nIn IOS 5.0 (9a334), on my Apple Iphone 4, you can now go to \"Settings\" - \"General\" - \"Network\" and there:\n\n\n*\n\n*turn off \"Enable 3G\" \n\n*turn off \"Cellular Data\" \n\n*turn off \"Wi-Fi\" \n\n*turn off \"Data Roaming\" \n\n\nThen go back to top menu under \"Settings\" and choose \"Location Services\" then at the very bottom choose \"System Services\" then:\n\n\n*\n\n*turn off \"Cell Network Search\" \n\n*turn off \"Location-Based Iads\" \n\n*turn off \"Traffic\" \n\n\nIt seems to me then that you will be left with GPS and Compass Calibration as items in effect. It is really weird there is no single toggle for \"Enable GPS\". \n\nA: I saw this on the backpackinglight.com forum:\n\"The second option is set up a sim PIN. When you restart the phone, you can choose not to enter the pin. This turns off the phone and allows you to use the gps and prolong battery life. I'm doing a test right now with MotionX. I've been running the track recorder now for almost 15 hrs, and the battery is still at 89%.\"\nThey also mention that 3 incorrect pin attempts locks the sim card so be careful if you try this.\n\nA: I put the iPhone into Airplane mode when I don't need GPS. I turn Airplane mode off when I want GPS. Airplane mode is quite quickly accessible via the Settings app.\nI usually take a photo every now and then to track my locations throughout a tramping track (that's the only case I use GPS for while tramping). Since GPS needs some time to connect and get the location anyway, I don't find it inconvenient to fiddle with the Settings app for 2 seconds upfront.\nI recently went on a 4-day hike and returned with 75% battery life on my 3GS using this technique. This time, I only took <= 10 or so photos with GPS turned on, though. But as you can see, there should be room for quite some more GPS requests.\nOf course, turning off Airplane mode enables every wireless technology on your phone. But I don't think that's too bad. If you turn off 'Cellular Data' and 'WiFi' in the settings, too, before starting a track, the iPhone does not attempt to find a 3G, Edge or Wifi network while in remote areas. Hence you save some more battery power.\n\nA: Since, when in airplane mode you can only use wifi, try getting MYWI from cydia and turn on wifi tethering which will then display your 3g/edge as a wifi network, allowing it to work even when in airplane mode.\n\nA: As far as I can tell, this isn't possible anymore. It used to be that SBSettings had a \"Phone\" toggle that allowed you to turn off the phone chip so to speak. Apparently there were some bugs and no one ever bothered to fix them so they just deleted it :(\nRemoving the sim card is the only way I know of since iOS 4.3 or so when the above mentioned bug was introduced.\nFYI, the SIM PIN \"hiking mode\" hack messes with things quite a bit on jailbroken phones :(\n\nA: Putting in airplane mode turns off all radios, including GPS even though it is not a transmitter.  But then you can turn on WiFi and GPS also turns on.\nI understand that WiFi can make GPS more accurate, but that's not sufficient reason to lock them together that way.  (And WiFi can't improve GPS when you're miles away from any WiFi AP!)  But Apple did tie them that way.\nI also use Motion-X and I also turn on Bluetooth for a heart-rate monitor.\n", "Q: How can I export SMS text messages from my iPhone? When answering this question, please note if the solution is:\n\n\n*\n\n*For Windows and/or Mac OS X users\n\n*The price of the solution\n\n*If you have successfully—and actually—used the solution\n\n\nHow can I export SMS text messages from my iPhone?\n\nA: I rely on PhoneView which you correctly note is a Mac OS X only paid solution.\nIt has always been updated very quickly by the developers each time a new iOS is released. I even received support several times for pre-release / beta versions of iOS and iTunes. Support emails are promptly answered and I have twice received custom builds from them to resolve issues using their product with pre-release iOS versions to assist me in managing the devices I use for iOS development.\nI've used PhoneView to save data from a phone that iTunes said was broken and could only be erased and then restored. It's been a reliable swiss army knife for me filling in many gaps that iTunes and Xcode leave for managing iOS devices. \n\nA: *\n\n*Get /var/mobile/Library/SMS/sms.db\n\n*It is now exported. \n\n\nWhat format do you want the export to be? The existing format is sqlite, so you can convert it to ASCII like so: sqlite3 sms.db .dump > sms.db.txt\nFor step one, you can jailbreak and then scp, or you can just search your backup folder for the file, no jailbreak required.\nIf your phone is not jailbroken, look on OS X in:\n~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/<long_hex_string>/\n\nAnd, in my case, and according to various web sources, although not in all cases, is named:\n3d0d7e5fb2ce288813306e4d4636395e047a3d28\n\n\nTo answer your other questions: Any OS, Free, Successful.\n\nA: I used CopyTrans Contacts for Windows (not sure whether it also operates on Mac) to export my iPhone SMS and iMessage text messages to my PC. \nHere is where I found out about the tool: How to export iPhone SMS\nI do not know the price as I used their free version to export all of my 100+ messages I think you have to pay if you want to export a really large number of SMS text messages.\n\n\nA: I'm on windows and I bought Decipher Text Message (Mac $7, Windows $10). It did the trick for my needs and backed up all my work sms messages from my iphone. My girlfriend uses it too however, she is on a mac. The cool thing is that the program also saved my sms images, which I hadn't even expected. Has anyone tried any of the other tools?? Curious about them.\n\nA: A windows software solution is Save The Message\nThe software is free (trial) however the costs after the 30 day trial are $9.99 for a basic account, $99 for a professional\" account.\n\nA: There are numerous tools (as linked elsewhere here), both free and expensive, to export message data. They all rely on interpreting data from an unencrypted iPhone backup. You can actually do this yourself if you're particular about how the data is exported.\nThe key facts are:\n\n*\n\n*Your backup lives inside ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/{uid}/.\n\n*The manifest.db is an SQLite database mapping all the files in that directory to actual filenames on the device.\n\n*The Library/SMS/sms.db file on your iPhone is another database containing all the message and attachment data.\n\n*Combining the manifest and sms databases lets you query and export all the conversations and attachments from decrypted files in your backup directory.\n\nI wanted to future-proof my exported messages (or make their contents human-readable and easily accessible), so I wrote a script to load these database, export the chats as JSON files, and archive all the attachments alongside each chat (message group).\nThe result is a kind of hacky but working (for me) tool that I've uploaded to GitHub: iPhone message export. This script might be a good starting point if you're interested in doing these backups yourself.\n(The price is free, I've successfully tested on macOS with an iOS 14  backup. I think if windows backups are stored the same way, the same python code should work there as well.)\n\nA: AllYourTexts - free - Windows\nFull disclosure: I'm the author.\n\n\n*\n\n*Allows you to view SMS and MMS data from your PC\n\n*Supports exporting to plaintext or HTML files.\n\n*Shows you graph visualizations of your texting behavior over time.\n\n\nI was looking for a solution to this myself and I was unhappy with the 3rd party offerings. I felt like they were overpriced or poorly designed, so I wrote my own.\n\nA: Believe it or not, there's an app for that!\nThe app SMS Export ($4.99) will allow you to export your SMS to the software on both your Mac and Windows. \nYou can make a back-up of your entire SMS-database or export the SMS-messages to your computer:\n\nYou can converted SMS to HTML, CSV or Text. Then you can load your SMS\n  into any program like Excel or Word and print them.\n\n\nA: My destination for the export was a new Smasung Galaxy Note, so the Samsung Kies software (eventually) managed to import the SMSs from an unencrypted iPhone backup.  Kies is free for Samsung phones.  It was necessary to 'update drivers' from one of the menus in Kies before this worked for me. Kies also prevents me running Android File Transfer on 10.8, so I uninstalled Kies once the import was complete.\nOtherwise, I've successfully used DiskAid on the Mac to export my SMSs to a flat text file.  A useful reference, but I'd rather it exported a friendly (ie standard) SQLite database so I could easily use the data elsewhere.\nDiskAid is $29.90 at the time of answer, but they also offer free educational licenses to folk with email addresses at tertiary institutions.\n", "Q: How can I change a file or folder icon using the Terminal How can I change or set the icon for a file or folder, in the terminal, do I need to use a scripting language?\n\nA: Check out setfileicon (source code), an utility created by Damien Bobillot.\nDownload the binary here: http://maxao.free.fr/telechargements/setfileicon.gz\nAfter unpacking the file, make it executable:\nchmod +x setfileicon\n\nThen you can use it as follows:\n./setfileicon \"my-icon.icns\" \"my-file-or-directory\"\n\n\nA: You'll need the Developer Tools installed, and then the following might work. This takes the graphic in icon.png and applies it to file.ext.\n# Take an image and make the image its own icon:\nsips -i icon.png\n\n# Extract the icon to its own resource file:\n/Developer/Tools/DeRez -only icns icon.png > tmpicns.rsrc\n\n# append this resource to the file you want to icon-ize.\n/Developer/Tools/Rez -append tmpicns.rsrc -o file.ext\n\n# Use the resource to set the icon.\n/Developer/Tools/SetFile -a C file.ext\n\n# clean up.\nrm tmpicns.rsrc\n# rm icon.png # probably want to keep this for re-use.\n\n\nA: With the benefit of several years of hindsight:\nuser588's answer and koiyu's answer work well, but they rely on utilities (Rez, DeRez, and SetFile) that:\n\n*\n\n*are not installed by default (they come with either Xcode or the developer command-line utilities)\n\n*are now deprecated (Rez and DeRez, because they relate to Carbon)\n\nThe osxiconutils project looks interesting, but is no longer maintained and won't compile any longer (as of macOS 10.10.4).\n\n*\n\n*velkoon points out that the linked repo offers downloading a ZIP file with (x64) binaries that still work as of macOS 13 (Ventura). You'll have to authorize the binaries for local execution by running the following against the ZIP file before extracting its contents: xattr -d com.apple.quarantine osxiconutils.zip.\n\n*A notable limitation of the seticon utility is that it can only assign .icns files, not also other image formats - unlike the fileicon utility discussed below.\n\n\nTherefore I've created CLI fileicon, which should work on a pristine macOS machine (no prerequisites); it is a Bash script based primarily on xattr, xxd and an embedded Python script that calls Cocoa, courtesy of this helpful answer. [Update: Since Python no longer comes with macOS, the Python script has been replaced with an ObjC Bridge AppleScript.]\nIt allows setting/removing/extracting custom icons for/from files or folders, including on APFS volumes on macOS 10.13 (High Sierra). [Update: Still works as of macOS 13, Ventura.]\nYou can install it as follows:\n\n*\n\n*If you have Homebrew installed: brew install fileicon\n\n\n*If you have Node.js installed, from the npm registry, with\n[sudo] npm install -g fileicon\n\n\n*Otherwise:\n\n*\n\n*Download the CLI as fileicon (this link will stay current).\n\n*Make it executable with chmod +x fileicon.\n\n*\n\n*Move it or symlink it to a folder in your $PATH, such as /usr/local/bin (requires sudo).\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's the usage information; for complete information, refer to the manual:\n$ fileicon -h\n\nSet a custom icon for a file or folder:\n\n    fileicon set      <fileOrFolder> <imageFile>\n\n Remove a custom icon from a file or folder:\n\n    fileicon rm       <fileOrFolder>\n\n Get a file or folder's custom icon:\n\n    fileicon get [-f] <fileOrFolder> [<iconOutputFile>]\n\n Test if a file or folder has a custom icon:\n\n    fileicon test     <fileOrFolder>\n\n -q ...  silence status output\n\n Standard options: --help, --man, --version, --home\n\n\nA: I have a github project where I create AppleScript \"droplets\" from [shell/bash, python, perl, ruby, etc.] scripts that take file paths as arguments. I wrote this bash function for changing the icon of an folder (because AppleScript bundles are Folders with a .app extension).\nreplace_icon(){\n    droplet=\"$1\"\n    icon=\"$2\"\n    if [[ \"$icon\" =~ ^https?:// ]]; then\n        curl -sLo /tmp/icon \"$icon\"\n        icon=/tmp/icon\n    fi\n    rm -rf \"$droplet\"$'/Icon\\r'\n    sips -i \"$icon\" >/dev/null\n    DeRez -only icns \"$icon\" > /tmp/icns.rsrc\n    Rez -append /tmp/icns.rsrc -o \"$droplet\"$'/Icon\\r'\n    SetFile -a C \"$droplet\"\n    SetFile -a V \"$droplet\"$'/Icon\\r'\n}\n\nOnce defined, you call the function with 2 arguments:\nreplace_icon /path/to/AppleScript.app /path/to/icon.png\n\nor\nreplace_icon /path/to/AppleScript.app http://i.imgur.com/LmUvWqB.png\n\nAs you can see the second argument can be an image on your system, or a URL.\nNOTE: That crazy looking $'/Icon\\r' thing that I do is because the name of the Icon file ends with a literal carriage return \\r. See for yourself with:\nfind my-applescript.app -maxdepth 1 | less -U\n\n\nA: Assuming that we have icns-file already. Create temp resource file which points to icns-file:\n$ echo \"read 'icns' (-16455) \\\"Icon.icns\\\";\" >> Icon.rsrc\n\nAppend the resource file as value of extended attribute \"com.apple.ResourceFork\" to a file:\n$ Rez -a Icon.rsrc -o FileName.ext\n\nShow the icon of the file:\n$ SetFile -a C FileName.ext\n\nAppend resource file as value of extended attribute \"com.apple.ResourceFork\" to a magic icon file inside current folder:\n$ Rez -a Icon.rsrc -o Icon$'\\r'\n\nShow the icon of current folder:\n$ SetFile -a C .\n\nHide the magic icon file inside current folder (press ⇧⌘. to show/hide hidden files in Finder):\n$ SetFile -a V Icon$'\\r'\n\nAdditional details\nIcon data is stored as value of extended attribute \"com.apple.ResourceFork\" (Terminal command \"xattr -p com.apple.ResourceFork FileName.ext\" prints the value). For a folder there is magic (which is empty and hidden) file Icon$'\\r' inside the folder. To extract icon data from extended attribute \"com.apple.ResourceFork\" into plain text resource file (from which we know correct icns-type identifier \"-16455\"):\n$ DeRez -only icns FileWithIcon.ext > Icon.rsrc\n$ DeRez -only icns /Folder/With/Icon/Icon$'\\r' > Icon.rsrc\n\nUnder macOS 10.13 High Sierra command $ sips -i ImageFile.icns/png/jpg generates error \"--addIcon is no longer supported\". Switch \"-i\" means \"--addIcon\" as extended attribute \"com.apple.ResourceFork\" onto this file itself using the content of this image file.\n\nA: I almost started a bounty on this, because I didn't manage to change the icon of a folder using @mankoff's answer. But I found a solution.\n\nTo change folder's icon you don't point Rez -append tmp.rsrc to the folder but a special Icon\\r file inside the folder. If you haven't set a custom icon to the folder before, the file probably will not exist, but Rez creates it on–the–fly. Deleting the Icon\\r file will remove the custom icon, so to prevent accidents it is good to be hidden.\nThese are the modifications to the mankoff's answer:\n# Append a resource to the folder you want to icon-ize.\nRez -append tmpicns.rsrc -o $'myfolder/Icon\\r'\n\n# Use the resource to set the icon.\nSetFile -a C myfolder/\n\n# Hide the Icon\\r file from Finder.\nSetFile -a V $'myfolder/Icon\\r'\n\n\nA: Another option is to use MacRuby:\n/usr/local/bin/macruby -e 'framework \"Cocoa\";NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace.setIcon(NSImage.alloc.initWithContentsOfFile(\"/tmp/a.png\"),forFile:\"/tmp/file\",options:0)'\nYou can download an installer for MacRuby from http://macruby.org.\n\nA: Strangely enough the best solution seems to be not to use Apple's own tools but the Python code because it has various advantages not being limited by:\n\n\n*\n\n*output file resolution\n(it works till 1024x1024)\n\n*input file format\n(tried with ICNS and PNG)\n\n*permissions to install\n(define it as a function)\n\n\nUpdate\nNow (on macOS Sierra) @koiyu’s answer seems to work, so you could use this two-liner to copy the icon from a source folder to your destination folder:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nDeRez -only icns $1/Icon$'\\r' > icon.rsrc; Rez -a icon.rsrc -o $2/Icon$'\\r'\nSetFile -a C $2; SetFile -a V $2/Icon$'\\r'; rm icon.rsrc\n\n\nA: In the recent macOS version (10.14), sips -i icon.png will get a --addIcon is no longer supported error.\nIt also needs Developer Tools installed. This uses the graphic in Icon.png and applies it to file.ext, just like user588's answer:\n# Covert Icon.png to tmpicons.icns:\nsips -s format icns Icon.png --out tmpicns.icns\n\n# Create temporary resource file which points to tmpicons.icns:\necho \"read 'icns' (-16455) \\\"tmpicns.icns\\\";\" >> tmpicns.rsrc\n\n# append this resource to the file you want to icon-ize.\nRez -a tmpicns.rsrc -o file.ext\n\n# Use the resource to set the icon.\nSetFile -a C file.ext\n\n# Clean up\nrm tmpicons.icns && rm tmpicns.rsrc\n\n\nA: Much like the Python solution using PyObjC, it turns out it can be done with just AppleScript (which isn't deprecated in 10.15 Catalina, unlike Python and other scripting languages).\nI found an example of how to do this on GitHub here:\n\nset-finder-icon\n#!/usr/bin/env osascript\n\nuse framework \"AppKit\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# PROPERTY DECLARATIONS:\nproperty this : a reference to current application\nproperty NSWorkspace : a reference to NSWorkspace of this\nproperty NSImage : a reference to NSImage of this\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# IMPLEMENTATION:\non run argv\n  set icon to item 1 of argv\n  set target to item 2 of argv\n\n  setIcon to icon for target\nend run\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# HANDLERS:\nto setIcon to iconPath for filePath\n  set sharedWorkspace to NSWorkspace's sharedWorkspace()\n  set newImage to NSImage's alloc()\n  set icon to newImage's initWithContentsOfFile:iconPath\n\n  set success to sharedWorkspace's setIcon:icon forFile:filePath options:0\nend setIcon\n\n\nAppleScript isn't easy to read, but apparently it's possible to access the Objective-C code to do this through the AppKit framework.\n\nA: In addition to Ruby, here's a Python version:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport Cocoa\nimport sys\n\nCocoa.NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace().setIcon_forFile_options_(Cocoa.NSImage.alloc().initWithContentsOfFile_(sys.argv[1].decode('utf-8')), sys.argv[2].decode('utf-8'), 0) or sys.exit(\"Unable to set file icon\")\n\n./set-image.py image.png myfile\nPython that pre-installed in Mac OS already has PyObjC so you don't have to install any packages.\n\nA: There is some kind of a bug (that happen in folders inside de iCloud sync) with the change of icons of \"folders\" nor files, at last in Catalina: When the Icon change, the UI does not refresh the folder with the new icon when it have an older one. So the second time you set an icon it not refresh all the times. Even if you do it manually with cmd+i and pasting a previously copied image as icon, the iCloud goes crazy with this.\nBy looking to a workaround, found this little fix (no ideal but works): - this is in JXA Javascript for automation\nfunction makeIcon(theFolder, theFile) {\n    var img = $.NSImage.alloc.initByReferencingFile( theFile );\n    var updateUUID = newUUID()+\".txt\";\n    terminal(\"echo -n > \"+ sanityzeForBash(theFolder+\"/Icon\\r\") );\n    terminal(\"rm \"+ sanityzeForBash(theFolder+\"/Icon\\r\") ); \n    writeTextFile(theFolder+\"/\"+updateUUID, \"_\"); \n    $.NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace.setIconForFileOptions(img, theFolder, 0);\n    delay(1);\n    terminal(\"rm \"+ sanityzeForBash(theFolder+\"/\"+updateUUID) );\n}\n\nfunction writeTextFile(fileName, text) {\n    var file = app.openForAccess(Path(fileName), { writePermission: true })\n    app.setEof(file, { to: 0 });\n    app.write( getProperties(text) +\"\\n\\r\", { to: file, startingAt: app.getEof(file) })\n    app.closeAccess(file)\n    return true;\n}\n\nfunction sanityzeForBash(s) {\n    return \"'\"+ s.replace(\"'\",\"\\\\'\") +\"'\";\n}\n\nfunction newUUID(){\n    return ObjC.unwrap($.NSUUID.UUID.UUIDString);\n}\n\nfunction terminal(c) {\n    var app = Application.currentApplication();\n    app.includeStandardAdditions = true;\n    return app.doShellScript(c);\n}\n\nThe idea of the \"trick\" is to create a file inside the folder before to change de icon to force the iCloud to sync, then wait 1s to delete the file.\n", "Q: How to perform cleanup duties on OS X? For all my Windows PCs I use CCleaner to perform cleanup duties. Is there a similar tool that I can use for OS X to clean up any accumulated crap?\n\nA: There was a not immediately relevant question posted a while ago that actually has answers I think you would be interested in. I answered with my regular maintenance routine (Why is my Macbook Pro getting so slow?). The relevant portion of my answer:\n\nApple Certified Technicians are your\n  friends: Third-party system\n  maintenance software is not. I've been\n  working with Macs for years and the\n  one immutable fact that I have learned\n  is that applications designed to help\n  maintain the system are more trouble\n  than they are worth. When all else\n  fails, take it in because there may be\n  a hardware problem at this point.\n\nI put my Macs through the wringer every day and I very rarely have problems since I implemented my maintenance routine. Third-party software is not necessary, if not a waste of money.\n\nA: Every once in a while (every 6 - 12 months, or if things start acting weird), check your disk with /Applications/Utilities/DiskUtility.app\nSelect your hard disk in the left sidebar, then the \"Verify Disk\" button at the bottom right. If everything is OK, good. If not:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Hold CMD+S at the Chime to boot into Single User Mode\n\n*Run /sbin/fsck -fy # this should fix everything\n\n*Type \"reboot\".\n\n\nA: Alex.. please be careful.  OS X generally doesn't need maintenance like most Windows installations do.  If you just leave it, it will be fine.  The only thing I sometimes tell clients who I'm tutoring, is that the maintenance scripts run themselves by default at 3AM.  They're not doing anything too serious, log rotations and the like.  So if they don't run, I don't think it's the end of the world.  But once in a while you may want to leave the computer on all night so they get done.\n\nA: Also, OnyX seems to be the popular choice for those looking for a Mac equivalent to CCleaner.\nhttp://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/11582/onyx\n", "Q: Boot Camp not burning Windows support DVD So, I'm trying to get Boot Camp to work so I can put a partition of Windows 7 on my MacBook.

Am I doing something wrong?\nAlso, I'm a complete noob with OS X, so please be very explanatory.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Okay, so I think I figured it out. Apparently it's a problem with Boot Camp 3.0.4 that came with the 1.6.6 update. I found a link to the discussion on Apple's forums and I'll post it as soon as I can use the MacBook again (it's installing Windows right now and I'm typing this on an iPad...).\nUPDATE\nHere's the link to the Apple forum discussion.\n\nA: Is the DVD mounted for writing in the Finder? If it is, the Boot Camp utility can't get a handle on the burn rights (as the Finder has them). Eject the disk, go to the Disk preferences in System Preferences, and make sure the option for blank discs is \"ask me every time\", then shove the disc back in. It should ask you which app to open; choose \"other application...\", and an open window will appear. Hold down the Command key and drag the Boot Camp utility icon from the Dock to the open window. (The icon should stay in the dock and appear under the mouse while you drag.) The open window will now have the Boot Camp utility app selected, so press the open button and affirm the \"what app to open\" dialog. (Note: I'm not on a Mac right now, so any verbiage is approximate.) Then re-try the burn. \n", "Q: How do I unlock my iPhone-4 so I can use it in Mexico with a Mexican carrier?

What is the safest way to unlock my iPhone so I can continue to use my apps (and new ones I may acquire later) with a non-Apple approved carrier?\n\nA: Do you mean to Jailbreak your phone, or to unlock it so you can use it on a different network? \nUnlocks currently depend on your firmware version, which you can check by going to settings >> general >> about and looking at the version number. If you can confirm then we could find the right unlock for your phone, supposing it can be unlocked. \n\nA: In the UK SIM lock is removed by the carrier themselves, for example O2 customers can simply request that their iPhone be unlocked online. I have done this with my original, 3GS and iPhone 4 and as such they can all be used on any GSM network and receive official software updates from Apple.\nFor AT&T iPhones it appears they are not offering a similar service to their customers in the US and you may need to resort to other means to unlock the device. \n\nO2 UK iPhone Unlock: http://shop.o2.co.uk/update/unlockmyiphone.html\nAT&T Support: http://www.wireless.att.com/answer-center/main.jsp?t=solutionTab&solutionId=KB82027\n\nA: Go to another store named telcel where they sell phones that's where you're going to get it cut to size and fitted to your iPhone, That's how you do it so you don't have to get any kind of contract.\n", "Q: App to video chat between iPod Touch 4 and Android phone?

This happens even for small things, like when a web page is being rendered, sometimes even while nothing is happening.\nAt first I thought batteries might've caused this, even though it was at 50%, so I changed them for new ones, which (subjectively) helped for about two hours, but it's still really laggy.\nI also tried using the mouse on different surfaces, again it seems to work a little better on the table than on my mouse pad, but it's a little laggy everywhere.\nIs this behavior normal for the Magic Mouse?\nedit: I've been using my Macbook with 24\" LCD at 1920x1280 resolution.

For some reason, I can't get the functionality for opening the tabs and windows from the last session to work either browser.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X 10.6.6\n\n*Firefox 3.6.13\n\n*Chrome 8.0.552.237\n\n\nI have tried making different profiles and reinstalling the browsers but nothing works.\nI have looked everywhere and can't come up with a solution. Any help is appreciated.\nEDIT: Safari's \"Reopen All Windows from Last Session\"  also doesn't restore last session windows. \nEDIT 2: I just noticed that quitting the browser (versus closing it by clicking the x button) and restarting it does resume the last session in every browser.\n\nA: Seeing your comment, this is because when you click the X on a Mac app, you are only closing the window, not the Application itself (like it does in Windows). Therefore you were still in a 'current' session, and that session had no windows. \n", "Q: iMac will not boot with anything connected via USB I have a 24\" iMac running 10.6.6 that will not boot if anything is connected to the usb ports on the back. If they are removed, it boots fine. It has been to the Genius bar once but they did not find anything wrong hardware-wise. \n\nA: Try holding down the Opt key (aka Alt) when you are booting. This should give the option of choosing a boot device. If you see anything in addition to the hard disk then it is probably because one of the USB devices has a mass-storage mode. This might make the Mac try and boot off that instead of the hard disk.\nYou can also go to Startup Disk in System Preferences to see if anything invalid has been selected by mistake.\n\nA: I had tht once with an earlier version, but it was fixed by unplugging the power cord for an hour or so. I mean really disconnecting, not just leaving it switched off. As you have been to the Genius bar already, seems that this was already the case once... try starting in verse mode with Cmd + v when you hear the startup chime. Perhaps that leads to helpful log output on the screen.\n", "Q: Are there Greasemonkey scripts for Safari? There's the wonderful Greasemonkey to run user-defined JavaScript on web pages.\nIs there such a thing as Greasemonkey for Safari? Or would one instead write a Safari Extension to customize behavior on other web pages? Maybe there's an alternative that runs on AppleScript instead of JavaScript?\n\nA: Another option to run GreaseMonkey scripts is NinjaKit (which is what I use). It's a Safari 5 extension, which means it's just a tad safer than GreaseKit.\n\nA: I use TamperMonkey and it works surprisingly well. It's also a Safari Extension.\nI have tried used NinjaKit in the past but it no longer works for me, a lot of scripts simply won't work.\n\nA: \nIs there such a thing as Greasemonkey for Safari?\n\nYou can use SIMBL and GreaseKit to run most Greasemonkey scripts in Safari, unmodified. Detailed installation instructions are found at this link, repeated here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install SIMBL\n\n*Quit Safari\n\n*Download GreaseKit\n\n*Drag the GreaseKit.bundle file to ~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins. You may need to create this location if it doesn't exit\n\n*Start Safari and you'll see a GreaseKit menu bar item\n\n*Install scripts from http://userscripts.org -- the installation process is a little different from the Firefox approach, but it works.\n\n\n\nOr would one instead write a Safari Extension to customize behavior on other web pages? Maybe there's an alternative that runs on AppleScript instead of JavaScript?\n\nThe native-to-Safari equivalent of Greasemonkey is AppleScript extensions and plugins. For a nice library of native Safari extensions check out Pimp My Safari.\n\nA: The best place to start is probably going to be here: http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/safari/index.action\nI've seen safari extensions whose only behavior was to customize behavior of web sites; just yesterday I saw one that changed the layout of reddit to be more iOS-friendly.\nhere it is.\n\nA: If you don't want to pay $2 for Tampermonkey, you can try Userscripts, which is free.\nUserscripts is simpler, you will have to add your scripts using the extension page instead of installing them from GreasyFork automatically, for example. But otherwise it does the job of CSS and JS customisations as well. See the documentation of Userscripts for more information.\nMind that you won't be able to install extensions, which tamper with input devices, in recent versions of OSX. After the installation from the App Store you will have to enable them in the safe mode - after restarting holding the Shift key down.

I have a network with the same SSID for multiple access points, and I would sometimes like to specify which specific access point to connect to. Is this something Mac OS X can do natively, or is there a third party tool that can do this?\n\nA: What OS X version do you have?\nIn older versions this is possible:\n\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Resources/airport -A'NETWORKNAME' BSSID='00:11:22:33:44:55' password='PASSWORD'\n\nBut on OS X 10.6 it doesn't work anymore.\nI've searched high and low for a solution for this, but haven't found anything yet. The only solution is going closer to your base station. So that the n -signal is stronger.\n\nA: An updated version of the airport-bssid tool mentioned in the answer by @Lil'Monster works on OS X El Capitan (10.11). A description of the tool is as follows:\n\nConnect to a specific wifi network, based off BSSID (mac address of\nAccess Point).\nusage: ./Build/Release/airport-bssid <ifname> [<bssid>] [<password>]\nConnect to specific wireless network on  interface, provided\nby the access point with  and password .\nIf  and  are excluded, a scan of wireless networks\nfrom  interface is performed and a list of wireless networks\nare returned with ssid, bssid, channel, and signal strength details.\n\n\nA: You can use that tool:\nairport-bssid on github\n\nA: Short answer - you can not.

I have Parallels Desktop 5 for Mac. Does the upgrade to Parallels Desktop 6 means that I have to reinstall Windows 7 and all the other programs?  \n\nA: No, your Windows VM and all the programs installed on it are stored on a virtual hard drive file. Upgrading Parallels won't affect the VM.\n\nA: To extend @Kyle's answer, which is correct by the way, you have to consider the fact that after the upgrade, you might have to re-authorize Windows. I really don't know what Windows is thinking or what Parallels is doing, but I've seen two people who had to re-authorize their Windows 7 Home Premium inside a VM after that upgrade from Parallels 5 to 6. \nThis was not a problem and is generally performed \"automatically\", but just have your product key handy just in case. \nI haven't personally upgraded to 6 yet (and probably won't). Paying 40 dollars a year to Parallels is more expensive than having Windows dedicated machines…\n\nA: I had not trouble upgrading from 5 to 6 with Win 7 Enterprise.\n", "Q: Space in Volume Name; can you remove? I have two drives in my machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*An SSD with the OS on it\n\n*a HDD with all my data. \n\n\nI have a symlink on the SSD for my home directory on the HDD so /Volumes/SSD/Users/Ross/ points to /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/Ross. The Macintosh HD drive is the original boot disk. I'm trying to get rid of the space in the volume name, but when I do I get all kinds of errors. I thought it was a simple as updating the symlink but it doesn't seem to be.\nI tried just option-clicking the drive and renaming, which worked but I started to get a lot of application errors.  For example, Terminal won't even open. Also, a lot of the Ruby gem installers don't handle spaces well.\n\nA: Yes, you can remove it, but you'd need to Reboot for it to take effect.\nI don't recommend renaming it - the vast majority of applications handle the space just fine. \nIf you have a handful of problematic programs, then just create a soft link to your desired location:\nsudo ln -s /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Ruby\\ Stuff /Ruby\n\n", "Q: Wi-Fi auto-disconnect for iPhone? Is there an app to disconnect an iPhone from a Wi-Fi router at a specific time, other than just turning off Wi-Fi?\n\nA: You may be able to configure the router to only allow WiFi access to the iPhone during certain times of day.  This isn't a connection timeout so much as a parental control over the time of day WiFi is allowed.  The setting is located in your routers admin interface.\n", "Q: Alternatives to MetaX? I'm trying to rip some DVDs on my Mac, the boxset for a TV show, using Handbrake. I'd also like to automatically fetch metadata - show name, episode name, etc. But MetaX isn't getting any metadata for me for this particular TV program. Any other Mac apps I can use that do similar?\n\nA: Some that I've found:\n\n\n*\n\n*iFlicks.app\n\n*Vidalin\n\n*iDentify\nI've yet to find one that does everything I want.  iFlicks.app comes close, but the feature I want that's missing is the ability to tag chapters.

Hands down, the best I've tried.\n", "Q: What process is accessing the hard drive? I can hear the hard drive chugging away when it should be idle. Some process is writing/reading from it in semi-random bursts, let's say once every second. Very annoying and wasteful.\nI tried activity monitor, but that did not give me enough information and lsof is overwhelming.\nWhere should I start digging to find out what process is (ab)using the hard drive? \nThis is on 10.6.6.\n\nA: I like using fs_usage to see whats going on. A lot of information is going to go by quick, but you usually can see which app is doing stuff. For example, when idle, ill see safari going pretty crazy at times, plus spotlight, etc.\n\nA: Other thing you can try is the iotop tool.\nExample usage would be\nsudo iotop     # requires root privileges\n\nAnd more info can be found here\nIt give summary over the fs_usage which was mentioned by jmlumpkin.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 Battery Leaked if I Don't Charge to 100% Related question here. \nI find out that when I charge my iPhone, if I don't charge it to 100% before I pull out the charger, sometimes the battery will leak out very fast. \nThe leak manifested in these ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the iPhone setting, I can see that the usage time since last full recharge is the same as the time now minus the time I pull out the charger. This means that the phone is effectively being in used right after I stop charging it, even though there is no one using it. \n\n*The iPhone battery decreases at the rate of 10% per hour, much more higher than the normal idle decreasing rate.\n\n*If I restart my phone, the battery % will still remain the same. So this means that the battery loss is for real.\n\n*If I restart my phone, the leak stops. The battery now decreases at normal idle rate ( which is about 2-4% in 8 hours time)\n\n\nThis problem is intermittent, and I can't reproduce it for sure but it happens from time to time.\nAny idea how to fix this?\n\nA: This sounds like it could be an issue with the your battery's fuel guage. Lithium Ion batteries have a problem with the meter that detects how much charge is left in your device. If you don't full cycle the phone every 30 days, the meter will get worse and worse.\nFull cycling involves:\n\n\n*\n\n*Charge the phone to 100%\n\n*Do not charge your phone again until all the battery is depleted (i.e. until the phone dies on it's own).\n\n\nThis is recommended both by Apple:\n\nBe sure to go through at least one charge cycle per month (charging the battery to 100% and then completely running it down).\n\n... and by Battery University:\n\nBatteries with fuel gauge (laptops) should be calibrated by applying a deliberate full discharge once every 30 charges. Running the pack down in the equipment does this. If ignored, the fuel gauge will become increasingly less accurate and in some cases cut off the device prematurely. \n\n\nA: Sine the problem doesn't persist after booting the phone, it points to one of your apps being the problem.\nI'd imagine something that's using your location all the time or using heavy WiFi connection etc.\nA list of your apps when this problem occurs would be helpfull.\n", "Q: Can I set the sender/reply-to address in iOS mail for an ActiveSync account? I have a Google Apps account for mail.example.com, but actually use addresses @example.com (e.g. tony@example.com, whereas the account is tony@mail.example.com).  This isn't ideal, but I'm stuck with it for now.\nIn iOS mail I have this account setup as an Exchange account (i.e. not IMAP), which means that there isn't much in the way of settings.  Email I send from this account comes from tony@mail.example.com, which works, but I would prefer tony@example.com (this already works fine on the Desktop/browser).\nIs it possible to change the sender/from/reply-to header in this situation?\n(I wasn't sure whether this was an iOS mail issue and so should be asked here, or a Google apps issue and so should be asked on webapps.se, or if it's just not possible. Feel free to bounce me if appropriate!)\n\nA: Unfortunately, no; it's not possible to specify a \"Send From\" address with an Exchange ActiveSync account. An Exchange Activesync account will always use the primary email address associated with it as the address the message is sent from.\n", "Q: How to reduce photos in iPhoto while keeping metadata? I got carried away taking high-res and RAW photos, and now my iPhoto Library is just too big. Most of these photos aren't good enough to take up that much space,  but they're still good enough to keep. How can I reduce the sizes of my photos while maintaining iPhoto metadata (e.g., albums, rating, location) for them?\nExtra props if:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can do it as a batch process.\n\n*I can exclude certain photos from the reduction (e.g., only reduce photos without 5 stars).\n\n*It gracefully handles the relationship between the modified and original photos.\n\n\nA: Short Answer, Automator: \n \nLong Answer: iPhoto cannot create a smart album based upon File Size, so you'll have to either group them by other means or manually create an Album with the offending photos (the big ones). Automator, on the other hand, is perfectly capable of finding iPhoto images by size (and by Rating stars).\nThe first thing you have to decide is: Do I want to scale my images down? Do I want to make them JPG instead of whatever format they have? Do I want to do both for maximum effect? That is, you have to decide what's the best optimization for your photos that has a balance between quality/size.\nEach of those have consequences:  if you don't save a copy of the original photo, and the resulting quality is not something you like, there's no turn back (unless you have a TimeMachine or similar backup of course). \nIn any case, Launch Automator, create a new \"Workflow\" and add the following actions: \n\nNOTE: I've removed the \"Make copy\" actions that Automator asks you to place by default when an operation will \"affect\" files, but leave those to \"experiment\" so you don't alter\nyour original images, at least until you're satisfied with the results.\nI suggest you try with a small set of images before going Coo-Coo with the whole Library. As in create a small album with some of the \"big\" images and try from there. You don't want to wreck your iPhoto library…\nThis should preserve all the metadata and original photo, while making a Batch adjustment. \nIf you have programs like Pixelmator or Acorn, you will have more automator stuff there. The more the merrier. \n", "Q: What exactly is the difference between Badges, Alerts, and Sounds? I specifically want to know what the difference is between badges and alerts in the Notifications options in the iPhone 4.\nCould you provide screenshots of each case?\n\nA: Badges are the little numbered icons, like the one that appears on the Mail and SMS apps when you have new messages.\n\nAlerts are popup messages like this:\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to disable spellcheck for Coda but leave it enabled for other applications? I use Coda as web editor, and I usually have to mix Italian and English nouns and phrases. I don't want spellcheck on (as I use programming-related words such as uid and pid), so I'd like to deactivate it. \nAt the same time, though, I'd like to have it enabled everywhere else on my computer.\nIt appears that Mac OS X doesn't have a way to enable spellcheck for some applications but disable it for others.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Just right click in the working tab, select Spelling and uncheck the option \"Check Spelling While Typing\"\n\n\nA: I don't know if it's possible (I doubt it), but here's a workaround: set a keystroke for the spellcheck menu item in System Preferences so you can easily turn it off or on.\n", "Q: Any way to get Time Machine to backup to Amazon Simple Storage Solution? Just curious if it is at all possible to have Time Machine backup to the 'cloud' using Amazon Simple Storage Solution. I've setup Time Machine to work over the network before to unsupported volumes (NTFS) but wasn't sure if this is possible. Anyone ever tried?\n\nA: If you have an extra ec2 instance, you could use netatalk and s3ql. It is a native time machine solution and works in Lion too. Your backups will be compressed and deduplicated. \nFrom Ubuntu:\nInstall S3QL (1.11.1) and netatalk (2.2.1)\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nikratio/s3ql\n\nsudo aptitude update\n\nsudo aptitude upgrade\n\nsudo aptitude install s3ql netatalk\n\nCreate S3QL authfile\nmkdir ~/.s3ql\nvi ~/.s3ql/authinfo2\n\nEdit S3QL authfile as follows:\n[s3]  \nstorage-url: s3://  \nbackend-login: $AWSKey  \nbackend-password: $AWSSecretKey  \n\nSet permissions on authfile\nchmod 600 ~/.s3ql/authinfo2\n\nCreate S3QL filesystem\nsudo mkfs.s3ql s3://$bucketName\n\nMount S3QL filesystem\nsudo mkdir /mnt/$bucketName\nsudo mount.s3ql --allow-other --nfs --compress lzma s3://$bucketName /mnt/$bucketName\n\nConfigure netatalk\nsudo vi /etc/netatalk/AppleVolumes.default\n\nEdit the bottom of AppleVolumes.default to appear as below:\n(Note: tm is also added to :DEFAULT: options.

Make sure you have port 548 open!\n\nA: Dolly Drive is newly-announced software that lets you do TimeMachine backups to \"cloud storage\". Their docs say the space is their own cloud-based storage space, not S3, so that might be sticking point. But other than that it's pretty much in line with what you're after.\nIn addition to doing the TimeMachine -> cloud bridge, they also help you duplicate your data to a local drive so you can do fast restores without having to wait for delivery of an cloud -> hard drive dump of your data.\nLooks promising. I'm lukewarm on the pricing.\n\nA: There is a FUSE-based project calles s3fs that claims to be able to mount an Amazon S3 bucket as a local volume. Since Time Machine seems to be able to use any locally available volumes as a target, this should work. I was not able to test this, however.\n\nA: A different approach would be to use a local Time Machine backup and then use something like Arq to move it to the cloud (automatically). You get the benefit of local storage + cloud backup.\n\nA: If you can get Time Machine to recognize a FUSE-mounted filesystem, then s3backer should work.\nI have never done this but would be interested to hear if anyone gets it to work (specifically how they got Time Machine to recognize the mount).\nSee also this wiki page.\n", "Q: Why can my laptop connect yet not my iPad/iPod Touch/iPhone? I just moved into a place with free internet.\nUsing Wi-Fi, I can connect with my laptop but not my iPad or iPhone. I can access the router (Netgear WGR614v9), the router setup page, and see the admin portion of it. \nThe SSID is broadcasting (I can see it with my laptop) but it doesn't show up on the list. I tried manually typing in the SSID and joining but my iDevices were unable to connect.\nWhat's wrong?\n\nA: There are several incompatible  WiFi standards such as 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g  and 802.11n. In some cases, manufacturers implemented draft standards before they were ratified and this led to incomptibilities.\nSome iDevices do not support 802.11n - so it may be that your WiFi access point (probably part of your router) is configured to use a standard that is not supported by your iDevices. You can configure your WiFi access point (router) to use a standard that you know your iDevices support.\nAlso some devices are simply better at picking up signals - it depends on product design and aerial size. If your iDevice can get a signal nearer the Wifi access point, you'll know that this is the probable cause.\nApple have some guidance for iPad users experiencing WiFi problems.\n\nA: As per Red's suggestion and the fact that you say you can see the router's admin page, you could try to change the broadcast an 802.11b signal which may provide better compatibility with the iphone/ipad devices you have.\nNote that this would reduce the theoretical speed limit down to 54Mbits/s but virtually any internet services in the US (Cable/DSL) are well below this so you won't throttle internet performance.\nAlso what is the signal strength that the laptop shows?  Typically a laptop will have better signal acquisition than an iphone/ipad.\n", "Q: Can I buy an iPhone 4 in another country? I want to know if I buy a iPhone 4 in another country if I take it home to Denmark where I live, can I then reinstall it so it uses the Danish keyboard and the iPhone is on Danish?\n\nA: Yes, you can buy a SIM-lock free iPhone 4, such as the ones that get sold in the UK or in Belgium and use them anywhere else in the World where iPhones are supported by local providers. \nBe aware that the UK phone ships with a different electrical plug.\nLanguage settings can be set from within the iOS preferences. I have mine running with multiple different keyboard layouts; and you can also set the main language of the device, just as you can set the language of any MacOS device to any installed language (usually quite a few). The nice thing is, that usually all apps also respect that language choice if they provide translations.\n\nA: iOS devices (and I believe Macs too) come with all supported languages, you just need to choose Danish. You will also be able to choose Danish keyboard, on iOS it is very easy to enable more than one international keyboard and switch between them if you want to do that.\nAssuming you are buying an unlocked iPhone 4 all you will need to make sure is that you have a micro sim, or cut down your existing sim card.\n\nA: I can turn on the Danish keyboard and Danish language options on my US iPod touch, so yes.

The linux machine shows up fine in my network list, and when I connect to it, Screen Sharing prompts me for a password (which is how I have the Ubuntu machine configured).\nI finish connected and I'm presented with a view of the desktop in Ubuntu. From the laptop it appears I can't select or do anything. As it turns out, the mouse interaction is working. Its just that the the view itself is frozen. I verified this by having the machines side-by-side.

I know there are no problems either in the MacBook or in the router since:\n\n\n*\n\n*Another computer can connect to my router easily\n\n*I connected my MacBook to other routers\n\n\nMy router is a Linksys WRT160NL that seems to work properly since also my iPhone can connect to it.\nWhen I go to the Airport icon on the top-right of the screen, I can see my router. \nI click on it and wait. A dialog box appears asking me for the password. I type it in (I'm sure I'm typing it right and that it is a WPA password, I guess it is the same of WPA-Personal), the progress bar (the circle one) keeps rotating for about 5 seconds then stops and got replaced by an Annoying-useless-freaking message saying:\n\nConnection Timeout\n\nI googled about this problem. I found some useless thread about this exact problem but they were so old that they date back to the first appearance of Leopard. The others say that this bug was fixed (when obviously it is not) thousands of versions ago.\nWhat should I do to fix this?\n\nA: There are LOTS of reasons for this not to work properly.\nFirst of all - don't rule out the router or the Macbook yet.  They are both suspect until ruled out methodically.  And we're far from ruling either of them out.  :)\nAre you sure it's WPA-Personal?  It could be WPA2.  Check the router settings themselves, by plugging in to the router, and connecting to its web interface.  Check again.  Check the password.  Check if it's AES or TKIP.  Once you're sure you know as much about the router and its wireless config as possible, try again, after unplugging your wired connection to it.\nIn System Preferences, remove the network if it's remembered.  You'll need to go to Network, Airport, Advanced, and then find it in the list, and hit the little minus.  Now try connecting.  I've seen networks that were set to WPA2 come up as WPA-Personal, since the laptop sometimes has trouble figuring it out.\nFor these, I've had to set them up manually, by going into the system preferences, network, airport, advanced.  Add a new network (plus at the bottom), put in the name EXACTLY, and the password, and WPA2-Personal.\nFailing this, check if your router's using a \"key index\".  If the index or key index is NOT set to 1, the macbook will fail to connect.  I've never found a way to force a Mac to use a different key index, and indeed some routers allow you to choose which index you'd like to use.  If the router's key index is not set to 1, your macbook will not be able to connect, period.\nFailing that, reset the router and set it up again, using WEP rather than WPA/WPA2.  Can it connect now?\nTry a different Macbook, or try a PC.  Can it connect?\nAnswer these questions in as much detail and I can help you more.

I could not connect to the internet anymore. What I finally did is change the channel in your router. If too many people are on the same channel you can get this connection timeout issue. You should have multiple channels you can choose from in your router. \nGood luck!\n\nA: Funny I had the same problem after updating to my OSX (Macbook Pro 13\") and kept having the same issues over and over again to no luck... then I plugged in my computer to the router via CAT5 cable... connected to the net.... and tried the wifi again... and it worked.  Weird.\n", "Q: What's triggering my Finder's CPU binges? A few times a week, the Finder on my Macbook shoots up to around 100% CPU use, and the fans start blasting.\nI've done everything I can think of - repaired permissions, rebooted, trashed preferences, turned off \"show preview\" in view options, audited the Activity Monitor for unnecessary processes, scoured the Console for errors, restarted the Finder, and a lot more. Eventually it subsides, and I assume that the source of the error was the last thing I changed.\nBut it's doing it again now, and I am at a loss. I wish there was a way to \"get inside the Finder's head\" and see what it's doing. I've tried running a sample of the Finder process in Activity Monitor, but honestly I don't know what it's doing, much less how to interpret the output.\nThat's really my hope: that someone can explain a better way to investigate CPU spikes like this, not just in the Finder, but any runaway process. There are certainly plenty of details that might help you all diagnose this specific case, but before I spew out even more probably-irrelevant information, I thought I'd see if anyone has general tips for diagnosing this sort of thing.\nThis is my first Stack-anything post btw, so please be gentle. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: \n\"I wish there was a way to \"get inside the Finder's head\" and see what it's doing. I've tried running a sample of the Finder process in Activity Monitor, but honestly I don't know what it's doing, much less how to interpret the output.\"\n\nTaking a sample in Activity Monitor is exactly that: getting inside the Finder's head to see what it's doing. While it may seem like greek, I or others here can interpret it for you. Just post it, or make it available for download or viewing (as they tend to be pretty big).\nWhat version of OS X are you using? In OS X 10.5.x and prior, I believe multimedia content ran within the Finder itself, rather than delegating it off to an agent/helper type process, so then the CPU usage may appear higher. For example, previewing a QuickTime movie might make the 10.5.x-and-earlier Finder spike to 60% CPU, while in 10.6 it might be split to something like 10% CPU for the Finder, 30% CPU to the QTKitHelper background process.\nOtherwise, I've sometimes seen the code the Finder uses to calculate the size of the contents of a folder cause temporary CPU spikes. (You'll notice something like TSomething::HFSSizerSomething in the stack trace of a sample). Usually it seems insistent on finishing its calculation even if the view you had open that warranted the calculation has since been closed.\nIn any case, seeing the sample should help pinpoint the issue along with knowing what context led up to the spike. It'll be easier to explain what taking a sample is doing once we have it in front of us to look at.\n\nA: You have DTrace available.\nman -k DTrace\n\nThose tools, plus fs_usage -f filesys should give you the answer.\n\nA: Change the finder > preferences > General \"New Finder Window Show\" option to anything but \"All my files\".  This helps a lot.\n\nA: Good advice so far. I'll share some experience I had with a Powerbook back in Tiger (but since Leopard also has a FatFinder process, this issue would occur in 10.5 too).\nI remember having an AVI in a folder. The format was a weird format, not a simple Quicktime movie or anything; back then cellphone cameras were bad and used the worst possible codecs ever created. So every time I went to that \"folder\" with Finder, it will hang, because it was trying to \"read\" the file and the codec was bad. \nEventually, either by luck or because I forgot about it (or deleted it), this stopped happening. But it took me a while to figure out what it was. I remember this exact behavior happening to me on Leopard with a \"badly\" formatted video too. Quicklook would hang the finder with that piece of media. \nI had to open it with VLC to \"repair\" it. And then it mysteriously started working again.\nI suggest you try to keep an eye of your usage patterns before the CPU spike to see if there's something in common. A file type, a specific folder, a specific time, etc.\nAt the time of the writing, I don't know your OS X version (10.x?) so this information may be slightly outdated if you are running Snow Leopard. \nAdditionally, follow the advice of trying to output fs_usage, top, and similar tools. It may give us a better hint. Output from Console.app (/Applications/Utilities) could throw some light to the issue. \n\nA: I've found only two tools to be broadly helpful in solving high CPU usage issues on one isolated program. Yes, activity monitor can sample and tell you where it's hung up / processing - but I find Instruments to be better suited to really getting at the nub of the issue if fs_usage can't. DTrace is awesome - I just have never needed to spend the time learning it - Instruments works well enough and the learning curve for me was much lower.\n\n\n*\n\n*fs_usage and grep to narrow down what files are being accessed often lets me know what/where the issues lie so I can take action to remedy / tune it.\n\n*Instruments app - Xcode 3 is provided to free developers or Xcode 4 (purchased in the Mac App Store or as a paid developer). Think of this like sample/activity monitor on steroids - you can poke around at things like memory allocation / leaks and get a much borader view of what's happening inside a slow process as it's running.\n\n\nA: I'd been plagued by high Finder CPU usage for a few weeks (80-100%). Eventually I discovered that it was due to my setting Finder to calculate all the sizes in a folder. This option isn't enabled by default, but it's worth checking just in case\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder\n\n*From the menu bar, select View -> Show View Options\n\n*Make sure \"Calculate All Sizes\" is unchecked\n\n*Click \"Use as Defaults\"\n\n\nOnce I did this I saw my Finder CPU usage drop immediately to 0%.\n\nA: I'm on a MacBook, OSX 10.6.8.  I too have been experiencing innumerable \"Finder CPU binges,\" accompanied by the fan.  Console reports all sorts of puzzling complaints, often multiply repeated [other situations also cause the fan to spin, and Console shows multi-repeat complaints].   \nI recently discovered that turning off my Airport quiets Finder right down.  Not a very useful cure, as right now I have Airport on so I can be here, and yes, Activity Monitor shows Finder consuming upwards of 100% CPU [whatever that might be —?]\n", "Q: How can I view the items in the Spotlight cache?

How can I access Windows PCs from my Mac, and vice-versa, on the same network. I need to transfer files back and forth, and I can't seem to figure out how to do it. I poked around the settings, added the MacBook to the workgroup and all, but the computers still can't see each other. Right now I'm using a USB HDD to shuffle files, but that is far from ideal...\n\nA: Sharing must be enabled.  To see the Mac from your PC's, enable File Sharing (System Preferences/Sharing/File Sharing).  You will need to take the additional step of enabling Samba sharing, since PC's don't use Apple's File sharing Protocol (AFP).  Do this by then clicking on options, and make sure \"Share files and folders using SMB (Windows)\" is checked.  Turn it on for whichever accounts you wish to authorize.\nIn order to see PC shares from your Mac, the PC's must be on the same network, with sharing enabled.  Share a folder or something.  Is it XP, Vista, 7?  If it's XP, disable Simple File Sharing.  Do so by opening a folder, going to Tools->Options, and find it at the bottom of View.  Then right-click a folder, go to Sharing and Security, and enable sharing.\nIf it still doesn't show up, you may have a network/firewall issue, and it warrants further help.. but try that to get you started.\n\nA: Harv's answer is spot on for getting Samba sharing enabled. I am contributing my personal experience with this particular issue.\nI am able to get sharing to work by setting the IP explicitly for the machine I wanted to connect to with Connect to Server via Finder. For instance, smb://192.168.0.100/Shared. This worked well enough for my needs.\nOn the other hand, I was able to see the Mac in the Network view on the Windows machine and access its shares. Just for whatever reason the Mac can't see any other devices on the network via Network in Finder.\n\nA: If the files are < 2.25 GB, an alternative with almost zero setup effort would be to use DropBox. If you are feeling friendly and want 250 MB extra, you can use this link.\nWhen DropBox detects both computers are on the same local network, it will transfer directly between them, not requiring routing the files through their server (although the files will eventually end up there).\n", "Q: Is it possible to mount SharePoint as a volume in 10.6? Background\nMy office uses: \n\n\n*\n\n*Microsoft SharePoint to store and version our documents\n\n*Microsoft Office, with Microsoft Document Connection to connect to the SharePoint site. \n\n\nQuestion 1\nCan Finder connect to a SharePoint server? \nQuestion 2\nCan MacFUSE be extended to mount a SharePoint path as a volume in Mac OS X?\n\nA: System-managed WebDAV connections to SharePoint\nYes, connections are possible.

I can't reproduce this problem when NeoOffice is used to open such files. \nExcel with webdav seems to always open .xlsx spreadsheets read-only. I can't reproduce this problem when NeoOffice is used to open such files.  \n(Side note: without file system type webdav, Microsoft Document Connection 14.2.0 (120402) causes dataloss without warning, of extended attributes such as Spotlight comments.) \nMore about Finder\nWith webdav, for files and folders that are already on the SharePoint server: \n\n\n*\n\n*Finder seems to be a first class app for renaming, moving or removing items. \n\n\nApps that are more compatible\nAnother shortlist: \n\n\n*\n\n*where Microsoft Office applications fail, NeoOffice and LibreOffice succeed. \n\n\nInput/output errors affecting files saved in Microsoft formats\nIf an attempt to open an Office Open XML file (.docx, .pptx, .xlsx etc.) fails with an input/output error: \n\n\n*\n\n*use Microsoft Document Connection to initiate an edit\n\n*save a trivial change to the file, close the window of the app that you used for edition\n\n*if necessary, quit the app that you used for edition.\n\n\nThose two or three steps seem to resolve, or work around, the error. \n(If I discover the exact cause of those types of input/output error, I'll either add to this answer or link to a question elsewhere. Early indications are that they occur only after a Microsoft Office app has failed to save with webdav.)\n\nA: I'm entering this away from Windows world, but if memory serves the URL you are getting from Sharepoint is probably something like \\my.sharepoint.somewhere\\some\\path\\to\\stuff\nYou need to convert that into something more portable.\nGo into Finder, and on the \"Go\" menu choose \"Connect to server...\"\nEnter \"smb://my.sharepoint.somewhere/some/path/to/stuff\"\nYou could also try clicking the \"Browse\" button and as long as the Sharepoint share is being advertised on the local LAN you should be able to locate the server and browse it's shared folders.\nThere are a couple of things to be aware of.\n1) Make sure you can resolve the \"my.sharepoint.somwhere\" name to an IP address. (Use the Lookup option in Network Utility to confirm this.)\n2) Your Mac may need to be a member of the Windows domain to be able to connect. Sorry - it's been a while and I cannot remember if this is a requirement with Sharepoint.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: I'd be curious if you get this working. I can connect to our SharePoint 2010 server via the Finder (Snow Leopard 10.6.6), but any files copied to the share fail with a -36 error. The file appears on the share, but has 0 bytes. Copying with the command line works fine.\nfwiw, I'm using https://my.sharepoint.school.edu/personal/username/ in Go > Connect to Server…\nUsing Transmit works, other linux and Windows clients work, but Finder and apps in Microsoft Office have problems. \nSee http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=809401\nUpdate:\nAfter some more detective work, I think I've found a cause of some problems: SharePoint has filename restrictions that conflict with the way the system stores extended attributes or resource forks on file systems that lack support for those things. \nRestrictions in SharePoint include: disallowing filenames that begin or end with a period.  See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/905231 for the full set of restrictions.\nWhen using Finder to copy a file (example: foo) to a SharePoint WebDAV share, the system may require a counterpart (example: ._foo) during or after the write. Disallowance will cause a write operation to fail.\nThis also explains why third-party WebDAV clients such as Cyberduck and Transmit appear more compatible — with some types of connection, they lose metadata. \nFor a volume mounted by Transmit with a WebDAV HTTPS connection to SharePoint, the file system type is not webdav, it's: \n\n\n*\n\n*transmitdiskfs\n\nUnless the Finder stops the ._filename stuff when writing to webdav shares, or SharePoint starts accepting periods at the beginning of filenames, I don't think you'll be able to reliably use Finder with SharePoint WebDAV shares.\n\nA: wdfs (with FUSE) for a WebDAV connection to SharePoint\nMacFUSE is outdated. Use a successor such as FUSE for OS X. \nTest environments\nI tested the following combination: \n\n\n*\n\n*Finder in OS X\n\n*wdfs 1.4.2, which requires FUSE and neon\n\n*FUSE for OS X 2.3.9\n\n*neon 0.29.6, Revision 1, installed using MacPorts 2.0.4.\n\n\nFor a volume mounted in this way, the file system type is: \n\n\n*\n\n*osxfusefs\nFirst a simple wdfs command, without the volname option of FUSE for OS X.\nThen attempting to work around error -43 (see below), a similar wdfs command with a volname option.\nResults, in brief\nFinder appears to copy and move some types of file to SharePoint without error.

For the same files, dates will appear proper with a system-managed WebDAV connection. \nFolders\nSharePoint will accept, from Finder, a copy or move of folder that is without a .DS_Store (Desktop Services Store) file.  \nMore generally, attempts to copy or move folders may fail with errors such as: \n\n\n*\n\n*-43\n\n*-36 — when some data in .DS_Store can’t be read or written. \n\n\nWhether SharePoint bars comparable Thumbs.db files from Windows clients, I don't know. \nMicrosoft Office 2011\nAs expected: \n\n\n*\n\n*these Microsoft applications can not save to a volume mounted in this way; beware of dataloss and zero byte Word Work File… .tmp debris\n\n*where Word 2011 fails, LibreOffice succeeds, and so on. \n\n\nA: Transmit WebDAV HTTPS connection to SharePoint\nPanic Transmit\nFor a volume mounted in this way, the file system type is:\n\n\n*\n\n*transmitdiskfs\nConflicts\nWhilst transmitdiskfs is used, it may be impossible to use FUSE-oriented file systems: \n\n\n*\n\n*I find that wdfs becomes unusable\n\n*I find that Wuala can no longer mount a volume\n\n*SOLVED???

How do you change back an iPad from Korean to English?\n\nA: Here is a link that shows step by step with images:\n\n\n\n", "Q: External Disk Capacity for Time Machine I have a 500 GB hard drive in my iMac, and I am planning to buy a new external hard drive to use for Time Machine. I don't know if Time Machine synchronizes, or something else. \nWhat size external drive should I get for Time Machine?\n\nA: The Time Machine drive should be equal to or larger than the drive that it backs up. TM images the drive completely, then saves incremental changes. Time Machine saves the hourly backups for the past 24 hours, daily backups for the past month, and weekly backups for everything older than a month.\nIf your internal is 500GB with 100GB free (using 400GB), and your TM is 500GB, then you will get a full image, and then some amount of history (filling up the remaining 100GB of the TM disk). The history length depends on your use habits. \n\n\n*\n\n*Change a few small files occasionally? Lots of history. \n\n*Change lots of big files a lot? Then the 100GB free will save a few hours or days.\n\n\nIf you have a bigger TM, you will have a longer history to browse.\n\nI personally have a mostly full internal, an equal sized TM, and change files quite often, and find that I usually have a few months of history. Plenty of time to restore a file I accidentally delete.\n\nA: There isn't much to add over the previous answers, but I would mix them a bit.\nYour Time Machine drive should be at least as large as the internal one. I've read somewhere a recomendation of it being 1.5 to 2 times the internal drive, but that actually depends on how you use your machine. If you deal with lots of small files, 1.5 will probably do. If you deal with video, and keep them in your internal drive, at least 2 times the internal storage. \nRemember that Time Machine keeps a copy of each version of any file changed, so if you change the metatags of a 1.5 GB video file, you will get 2 copies in your TM storage. If you make lots of individual small changes to your music files, they will be stored as different backups as well.\nAlso, I agree that you should by the largest drive you can afford, and resist the temptation of partitioning it when you see the unused empty storage. I originally had a 250 GB internal drive and a 500 GB TM drive that was ok. I bought a 1.5 GB external drive and moved my backup there. Then I upgraded my internal storage to 500 GB and had to increase my TM storage to 750 GB. Then I found that eventough OS X allows me to change the size of a partition, it isn't able to move the start of a partition. My TM partition was the last one, so I had to use Linux to do that, and since it was a large backup partition I didn't have available storage to backup it. Quite a bit of cold sweating, but everything went ok. I just would avoid repeating that.\n\nA: Time Machine keeps copies of everything on your hard drive, and all revisions. It doesn't keep multiple copies of the same file when it's not been changed. I'd suggest you want a disk with around twice the capacity of the disk space used on your Mac -- so if you're using 300GB of the 500GB on your iMac, you'll want around 600GB for Time Machine. That will allow you to keep a reasonable amount of history of file changes. But it depends on how many changes you're making to your files.\n\nA: Just get the largest within your budget, that way you can migrate to a larger internal HDD if you need in the future as well. Also the larger the HDD, the more version of history it can store. And more space is never wasted. :)\n", "Q: iPhone 4 camera capabilities to read QR code I have no iPhone 4 here now but I need to know how well is its camera for reading small-size QR codes.

I can't seem to find any pattern to it.\nI switch my iPhone off overnight and sync with iTunes every other day or so, but most of the time it's fine and I don't have the problem and the podcast shows up as part of the way through in iTunes itself. Also, I'm not playing anything else on the iPod in the meantime.\n\nA: This could be a memory issue that the developer was forced to handle this way. All apps in iOS are subject to memory warnings at which point the app (developer) is to free up as much memory as it can by clearing out what the developer considered unnecessary information. \nAnother point of of possible quitting is if a phone call is being received. Apps only have a split second to save what is crucial before quitting to make room for the call. Again, the developer has to decide what is truly important and what isn't to save.\nThe save position may not sound like a lot, but mobile devices really don't give developers a lot of room to play with and media of any type is a resource hog.\n", "Q: Custom shortcut executes service twice Following this answer I have created a custom service that executes a shell script that looks like this:\nopen -a FireFox \"http://dict.cc/$1\"\n\nIt works fine when I click.

I assume that during a \"normal\" application installation, there is some sort of registration process that takes place and that's the part I'm missing.\nCan anyone provide some clues as to how the app install process works or shed some light on how I might accomplish a manual install?\n\nA: *\n\n*Make sure you have appsync and installous from cydia installed on your iPhone, installed from the source\n\n*The app has to be a .ipa file.\nPlace the file in /private/var/mobile/documents/installous/downloads.\n\n*Open up installous and install from there.\n\n\n\nOr use iPhone Explorer as described in this LifeHacker post:\n\nUsing iPhone Explorer, you can backup or copy apps (and their settings) to your computer or to other iOS device—and it can do all of that without a jailbreak. To backup system files or default applications, like iOS's built-in calendar, you'll have to jailbreak your iOS device. (Even if you're not interested in backing up apps, iPhone Explorer is still great for mounting your iOS device as a disk.)\n\n\nA: Quoting myself from another answer, this is how I add apps to jailbroken iOS. It's not  easy to setup, but it's really simple and easy once you're done:\n\nI believe the best way is using the iPhone Configuration Utility, yet again like that guide from corona. I've confirmed it works just like using the Organizer, but it doesn't need the Xcode. Just download it (this needs a free login, or find another place on the web with that file, v3.2 is about 10Mb), and drag the app / ipa inside your phone. Dealing with licensing the iphone is a whole nother issue (don't you love self promoting?).\n\n\nA: I think you mean to restore data to an app and not install a new app right? If you wish you install you can use the methods mentioned but to simply restore data which your backing up yourself you simply need to restore/overwrite the Documents and Library folder of the app in question.  It's worked for me numerous times.  There may or may not be other folders in the main application folder but so far Documents and Library have been all that's needed. I use Chronus (from Cydia) to backup data from certain apps every onces in a while. \n\nA: To add to eliben's answer, you can do this directly within your jailbroken iPad at least one way. I like to download stuff with wget directly to my iPad and am able to do this with OpenSSH and a standard regular-AppStore app called prompt which allows me to ssh directly into my iPad (127.0.0.1) as root or as the non-root \"mobile\" user. Password is always alpine by default.\nAnyway, to do this one you can use unix's 'cp' or 'mv' functions\nroot#: cd current/path/of/file\nroot#: cp file.ipa /private/var/mobile/installous/downloads\n\n", "Q: How can I reinstall an application that the Mac App Store thinks is installed already? I'm the developer of an application that is currently on the Mac App Store. I'm trying to download my own application so that I can test out the binary that is on the store. (As opposed to running it in Xcode.)\nI have purchased my own app in the app store previously, but then deleted it. (So that I could install a different version for testing.) Now, the App Store thinks that the application is still installed, even though it is not. (I deleted the development version when I was finished using it.)\nI have removed all instances of the application from:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Applications\n\n*~/Downloads\n\n\nBut the app is marked as \"Installed\" in the App Store, and it doesn't show up in my purchases. Is there a trick to get my binary re-installed?\n\nA: Awesome, I figured it out. Run this command, which rebuilds LaunchServices:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n\nAnd everything should be back to good! Immediately after running, the App Store allowed me to re-purchase the app.\nSource: MacLife Link\n\nA: Just hit Launchpad and delete your app there by clicking and holding down the mouse button and clicking the \"x\" top left. \nNow the Mac App Store knows it's deleted. Just redownload and be HAPPY!\n\nA: It could be that the App Store interface sees your development version(s) as the installed copy.  LaunchServices doesn't care if your app is in the /Applications folder or buried in your Xcode build directory.  See also.\n\nA: On Snow Leopard, I not only had to run the command in Craig's answer, I also had to make sure that Spotlight was up to date and did not show the app in question to still be  on the computer.\nYou can refresh particular folders in Spotlight's index using the mdimport command. So to refresh the /Applications folder:\nmdimport /Applications\n\nI had a Lion partition as well as a SL partition on the machine. Spotlight was set up to index everything on both partitions, and there was a version of the app in question on my Lion partition. I added the entire Lion partition to Spotlight's ignore list, then ran the command in @Craig's answer, and everything worked. Just running the command in @Craig's answer was not enough for me.\n\nA: Nothing helped (El Captain), so I opened Launchpad (F4), found application there, dragged it to Trash and successfully reinstalled.\n\nA: (had it not been that I needed points to do so) I would have upvoted or added a comment that restarting my system like kakhkAtion\nsuggested was what worked.  I was trying to reinstall Affinity Publisher from the app store.  (I had tried to find it in Launchpad (it was gone), I removed it the icon from the doc, but both the App store and the command line tool 'mas' both reported it was still there.  I also tried holding the option key).  Only restarting worked (iMac 2012 running High Sierra 10.13.6) \n\nA: You can also hold down option while clicking the app in the app store to force it to re-install.\n\nA: This will work on OSX Mavericks and Yosemite.\nInstead of launching the App Store app from the dock or the apps folder, launch the App Store app from within the Launcher.  This will rebuild the App Store app and tell you what's installed or not.  \n\nA: Had the same issue. Just restarted my mac and then the app store could see that the app was not installed.\n", "Q: Is there any multiple terminal emulator for Mac OS? I love the command line and I would like to see an app like Terminator (for Linux) in my MacOs:\n\nIt seems there are ports of that app for Mac available using Fink or Ports. But I found it's a hell to install them... it depends on a lot of things which depends on other things which... etc.\nSo I've been wondering if there's a MacOS native app like that (free or not)...\n\nA: Terminator was just ported to Mac OS X via the homebrew package Manager.\nbrew install terminator\n\nSee the PR or the recipe.\nTested on OS X 10.9.2 the main functionalities work. \n\nA: iTerm 2 claims to be able to do this.\n\nEdit: I just downloaded it, and it seems to work well enough that I think I'll switch from iTerm 1:\n\nI'm not sure what's going on with you and macports, but I just installed tmux using macports. it took about 30 seconds, and was completely painless.\n\nFWIW, I've subsequently spent enough time with GNU screen that I basically just use it for everything at this point. iTerm is nice if you want a local, mouse-driven multiplexer, but almost everything I do is server-side at this point, and doing it all over one SSH connection is much better anyways.\n\nA: Install GNU Screen, or TMUX via macports/homebrew or by compiling it by hand. \n\nA: I'm a big fan of SizeUp which lets you tile windows using keyboard commands. This doesn't put different views in one terminal, but it does let me easily have a bunch of views open at once and organized neatly.\n\nA: I think iTerm 2 and TotalTerminal are all great tools to improve the efficiency when working on terminal and command lines.\n\nA: I found that GNU screen does exactly what I want (just type screen in terminal), but only after I spent a few minutes learning some basics.  Here is the jump start I needed on key bindings (straight from the man page) - note that you need to install the GNU version for vertical splits (listed after the FAU version that was in my Mavericks).\nScreen version 4.00.03 (FAU) 23-Oct-06 \n(included in Mavericks and likely similar in earlier)\n\n       The following table shows the default key bindings:\n\n       C-a '       (select)      Prompt for a window name or number to switch to.\n\n       C-a \"       (windowlist -b)\n                                 Present a list of all windows for selection.\n\n       C-a 0       (select 0)\n        a|            a|\n       C-a 9       (select 9)\n       C-a -       (select -)    Switch to window number 0 - 9, or to the blank window.\n\n       C-a tab     (focus)       Switch the input focus to the next region.

Note that this binding defaults\n                                 to  the command character typed twice, unless overridden.  For instance, if\n                                 you use the option \"-e]x\", this command becomes \"]]\".\n\n...\n\n      C-a S       (split)       Split the current region into two new ones.\n\n...\n\n       C-a ?

(though you'll probably want a newer version than what comes with OS X as the ability to split on both axis is newer than the version of screen already installed on your mac.)\n\nA: There is also the following:\ncsshx\n\nA: For macOS 10.12 cssh from https://www.macports.org works great, whereas the homebrew version fails.\n\nA: Check out SecureCRT: https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/mac_osx.html They have a build for Windows, Mac, and Linux. I've used the Windows version for years, and started using the Mac version recently. Although the Mac version isn't as fancy as the Windows version, it is full featured for everything I've ever needed in a multiple terminal emulator. It would be nice to have MobaXterm on Mac, but sadly it's only for Windows.\nBy the way, SecureCRT is not free. It is $99 for 1 year of updates or $139 for 3 years of updates. If you do cloud computing, server management, etc, it is well worth the price.\n\nA: Use Command + T to open new terminal window\n", "Q: Remote desktop iPhone app vs BT Home Hub 2.0 I got an app (RDP Lite) which lets me use my PC remotely when I set the IP address to my PC's and use it at home. So it's fine internally but when I want to try it externally I try setting it to my router's IP address, provided by BT Home Hub Manager under Home Network > IP Addresses, and that doesn't work.\nI know I need to configure my router to allow incoming traffic to my default port for Windows XP, 3389, but I really don't know how. I've tried a few things like letting supported applications VNC to device 'IBM...etc' and removing the firewall temporarily but I'm shooting in the dark here.\n\nA: I was about to buy that app, but I'm a long time user of LogMeIn Free were from here (Denmark) I help my mum and dad as well plenty of friends with their computer related problems back in my home country (Portugal)\nLogMeIn Free was a fantastic as free solution, no hassle with proxies, routers or anything as it works with port 80 (http traffic).\nSo I bought the LogmeIn Ignition App and continue to use my access to all computers that i used before. It's a bit expensive ($29.99) but I bought it within a promotion discount and works marvelous and super fast!\nI can now access any windows or mac computer from my iPhone or iPad with no worries.\nIt's just an idea.\n\nA: You need to do a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up your PC to have a static IP address on your home network, you can do this two ways.  Either tell the router to always assign the same IP address to your PCs MAC address or tell the PC to take the same IP address when it starts up.  Best thing to do here is to search for your routers model number and the phrase 'static ip'\n\n*Have the router forward traffic on port 3389 to your PCs port 3389 via the port-forwarding section of your routers configuration panel\n\n*Identify the external IP of your router (go to www.whatismyip.com) or setup a dynamic DNS entry, try www.dyndns.com or www.no-ip.com\n\n*Tell the firewall on your PC to allow incoming traffic on port 3389\n\n*Make sure the PC is listening for your connection on the right port\n\n\nIt sounds like you're almost there, you might just be missing a small part.\n\nA: It's usually called port forwarding but in your case it's most likely to be found under the 'applications' you mentioned in your router.\nMake sure your PC has a fixed IP address and set up a rule in your router to forward all 'port 3389' traffic (that's the default port for the RDP protocol) to the IP address of your PC. Then try to connect your RDP client on your phone using your public IP address.\nQuit often routers allow you to map inbound traffic on a specific port to a local IP address on another port. That's usefull if you want to control multiple PC's behind a router, if it's just one, use the same portnumber, 3389 in your case.\n", "Q: Mac OS X Terminal [Use option as meta key] overrides backslash in spanish keyboard I already posted this question in stackoverflow:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/4811282/mac-os-x-terminal-use-option-as-meta-key-overrides-backslash-in-spanish-keyboar\nbut I was informed there that this is the right place to ask it.\nI check \"Use option as meta key\" checkbox in Mac OS X Terminal, because I like to use emacs way of moving between words: M-f & M-b.\nBut if I do that, I can't get the backslash (Option + º; i.e.: Option + key-at-the-left-of-1-in-spanish-keyboard). If I uncheck it, then I can input the backslash, but I don't have M-f & M-b.\nIs there a way to get both? This is driving me nuts!\n\nA: And, as I already answered you on stackoverflow, the solution is to put the following line into your ~/.bash_profile, which remaps the unicode character \"∫\" (Unicode: E288AB, which is what is sent to your terminal right now in your desired configuration when you press Option + °) to the backslash character:\nbind '\"\\033\\xE2\\x88\\xAB\"':'\"\\\\\"'\n\n\nA: I have built a solution myself and it doesn't require abandoning Terminal.app in favour of iTerm 2.\nIt is a simple status bar app that runs in the background and rewrites all left Alt + $KEY key events to two key events in rapid succession, Esc, then $KEY; however, it only does this if Terminal.app is in focus.\nYou can find the source for the app here. You'll need Xcode to build it.\n\nA: Asmus' answer does not seem enough because it fixes backslash on bash. But then there's zsh. And Emacs. And etc.\nBut since there's no way to map non-function keys in Terminal.app, I'm afraid I can't see another solution: you'd have to go ahead and map all the keys you want in all the programs you need them, which is a drag and is not optimum, because you won't ever have ƒ and ^[f at once.\nOr try habibalamin's solution, it seems far simpler and it keeps distinct functionality for left alt and right alt. I will vote up after trying it.\nI can't comment with my rep on this stack site, sorry.\n", "Q: Upload video to iPod directly without sync-ing We have a number of iPods and a number of computers and the fact that they need to be matched one-to-one for iTunes sync'ing to work is really a pain.\nIs there a way for me to upload a video directly onto an iPod Nano (a previous generation that can still play them back, not the current one), without having to switch the library it is connected with (which would erase all other content on there)?\n\nA: Another option is to manually manage music and videos.

I don't understand why; I only want to remotely control my Mac from an iPad, so a local network should be enough… right?\n\nA: Macs come with VNC automatically, no additional install. If you can trust everyone on your local network and your VNC ports are closed on your router/firewall, then I would just turn it on. There is a check box under advanced remote management or remote desktop options that says something about allowing VNC users to log in. There's an optional password field. I use iTeleport then to VNC into my mac. There are other cheaper VNC programs too, but iTeleport is pretty excellent.\n\nA: I use www.logmein.com. I am not sure how well it works nativly, but with the $30 ignition app, it works great.  The one thing that might not be best for you is that it is web based - you have to do it over the internet - a local network with no internet access would not work.\n\nA: ActyMac DutyWatch Remote is a good app for remote control, and provides access from an iPad.\n\nA: RemotePC is designed to connect over the internet - i.e. when you are not on the same network. If you want to connect over e.g. a ad hoc network, look for a VNC client such as Screens or iTeleport (my favorites). They are both great.\nhttp://edovia.com/screens\nhttp://www.iteleportmobile.com/\nBoth apps connect to a Screen Sharing enabled Mac. iTeleport can also connect via the internet, i.e. even if you are not on the same WiFi, using an extra application which you run on your Mac.\nAs for remote control - I would recommend either TouchPad or HippoRemote.

I've also checked that the firewall is (Preferences -> Security -> Firewall) turned off.\nWhat else do I need to check to diagnose this?\n\nA: So, Broken MBP can ping anywhere, including other machines in your network, but can it ping itself?  (You have to read that with the \"Will it Blend?\" sound)\nThe rest of the machines can ping each other, but not the Broken MBP. \nAm I correct?\nDoes this only happen via Wi-Fi? Have you tried using a Cable?\nWhat happens if you turn ON the firewall and make sure that in \"Advanced\" the machine is not in Stealth Mode:\n\n(Security -> Firewall -> Advanced)\n\nA: Looks like this is some restrictions on Wi-Fi services in OS X. I have hade the same problem but when I used cable ethernet connection - all went OK.\n\nA: I would remove the range-extending Airport Extreme from the setup, and turn off all other devices except for the two laptops, just for troubleshooting purposes.\nThen I'd set both laptops to normal DHCP, not static IP addresses, in case this was causing a problem, then see whether the \"healthy\" laptop can ping the \"unhealthy\" laptop.\nCheck that the \"System Preferences --> Sharing --> FileSharing\" is enabled, and check through the options, shared folders, and users to make sure that anonymous users can see the files you are trying to share.\nIf all of this works, then I'd slowly add devices one by one, until I'd found which one was causing the problem, and troubleshoot further from there.  \nGood luck!\n\nA: I had a similar problem recently and wasted a lot of time on it only to find out that my MBP was connecting to the guest network from my Time Capsule.\n\nA: Can you\n\n\n*\n\n*ping other devices on the network from the broken MacBook?\n\n*from another computer, ping all devices but just not the broken MacBook?\nIf both of the above are true there must be a firewall somewhere blocking icmp pings to the broken macbook.

If I go into Settings > Trackpad and enable Tap to click, I can enable the settings Dragging and Drag Lock.\nWhat is the difference between these two settings?\nIt appears that they are doing the same exact thing when I try to use them. From my understanding, if I don't have drag lock enabled, I should be able to double tap then drag a window, after I lift up my finger, the dragging should stop. However, that is not the case, I must tap again in order for the dragging to stop.\n\nA: If you enable Drag Lock after you do your desire change you must tap you finger to release dragged item but if you disable it if you do your desire change you only need to put up your finger form trackpad.\n\nA: I believe I figured out the difference:\nDragging:\n\n\n*\n\n*Double tap and hold to begin dragging.\n\n*Release the mouse.\n\n*Depending on the amount of time that has passed, moving the mouse will do one of the following:\n\n*\n\n*Brief delay: moving the mouse continues the dragging, essentially behaving the exact same way as drag lock. The cycle is then repeated once you release your finger.\n\n*Longer delay: dragging is stopped.\n\n\n\nDragging & Drag Lock:\n\n\n*\n\n*Double tap and hold to begin dragging.\n\n*Release the mouse.\n\n*Moving the mouse will continue dragging.\n\n*Tap once to stop the dragging.\n\n\nIt's that brief delay that was throwing me off. There doesn't seem to be any way to customize the length of this delay. One thing that does help, though, is figuring out exactly how long this delay is. One method for figuring this out is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag an icon from the dock a tiny bit so that if you were to release it, it wouldn't be deleted.\n\n*Release the mouse.\n\n*Observe how long it takes for the icon to move back to its place.

I can single tap my trackpad for a left click, and tap it with two fingers for a right click. Is there any way to bind a three finger tap to perform a middle click?\nI tried MagicPrefs, but it's limited to the MagicMouse only, it doesn't work with the trackpad.\n\nA: You can try BetterTouchTool. There might be a setting to do that. Maybe you'll even find another gesture to triple-click that you'll like better.\n\nA: There is also another tool that I like more then BetterTouchTool,\nit's called MiddleClick and does exactly what you expect :-)\n", "Q: How can I get my trackpad settings to work on the login screen? I enabled the System Preferences > Trackpad > Tap to Click which causes it to work while I am logged in. However, in the login screen, it does not work. How can I get this setting enabled in the login screen as well?\n\nA: Open Terminal and enter the following commands\n\n\n*\n\n*defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE\n\n*killall Finder  \n\n\n\nIn Finder\n\n\n*\n\n*open Macintosh HD/Library/Preferences\n\n*Ctl+click/right-click a file called .GlobalPreferences.plist and click 'Get Info'\n\n*Change the permissions to allow you to alter it but make a note/screenshot of what they are first.

So if you enabled the root account, logged in as root, and set whatever trackpad or mouse settings you liked in System Preferences, they would be applied to the login window.\n", "Q: What trackpad gestures does Safari support? Which trackpad gestures does Safari support, and what do those gestures do?\n\nA: As far as i know, Safari supports pinch to change zooming, three finger swipes to navigate back and forward and that's it.\n\nA: Take a look at Jitouch to add a slew of extra gestures to Safari, and window controls in general.\n\n", "Q: How can I restore a file from the trash back to its original folder? If I deleted files on my computer and they went to the trash, how can I send them back to the same folder that they came from?\nOn Windows, I can right-click the files and press restore.\nCopying them to a location manually (e.g. via finder) is not a valid solution, since I don't know where they came from.\n\nA: I think you can just right-click the file and select \"Put Back\"\n\n", "Q: iOS 4.3 Beta for Apple TV I'm wondering if anyone knows what features will be offered in iOS 4.3 for Apple TV?  I'm primarily trying to find out if the Netflix app will be updated to support subtitles.\n\nA: \nI'm wondering if anyone knows what features will be offered in iOS 4.3\n\nWhile in beta, we, Apple Developers with access to the developer portal, are prohibited to say anything regarding the beta iOS.\n\n\nA: There's a good breakdown of new features over on iLounge\nIn summary;\nApple TV  \n\n\n*\n\n*AirPlay improvements (stream some web videos and your own videos)\n\n*iOS Software Number matches other iOS devices\n\n*New On-Screen Keyboard Design\n\n\nThere don't appear to be any changes to Netflix but there's always a chance it'll appear in the final release.  You might have to wait for iOS 5\n", "Q: Toggle between applications via four finger gesture? Currently, if you enable it, the four finger gesture popups a window that shows you the apps you can switch to, You can then select one of them using the mouse.\nIs there any way to modify this gesture a bit to make it faster to use?\nI would be fine with either of these implementations:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you perform the gesture, a right swipe will immediately switch to the next window in the queue, while a left swipe will switch to the previous one. As a result, the queue should not be changed every time you switch windows, otherwise if you keep performing the right gesture, you will just be navigating back and forth between the same two windows.\n\n*When the gesture is performed, you see the popup window which displays the open application's icons as you normally do now; but you can keep the fingers down on the trackpad, and move them left or right to highlight a different icon. Once the application you want to switch to is highlighted, you release the trackpad and it switches to that application. \n\n\nA: Have you looked into BetterTouchTool? It lets you customize every touchpad input under the sun. You could for example remap the four-finger horizontal swipe to Cmd+Tab.\n\nA: On Mac OS 10.6:\n\n\n*\n\n*Swipe with four fingers\n\n*Swipe or scroll with two fingers to select the application\n\n*Four fingers tap (no need to be over the app switcher) and it switches to the application you've selected.\n\n\nA: The best way to do this is with one of the more obscure settings in BetterTouchTool\nIt works like this:\n A three fingered right swipe brings up the application switcher. Lift one finger to covert it into a two finger swipe and slide to whichever application you want.\nIt becomes an incredible natural and fluid gesture The beauty of the gesture is that it works anywhere on the screen and you don't have to position the mouse over the icons.\n\n\n*\n\n*In BTT assign the three finger swipe right to the application switcher.\n\n*In BTT Action Settings -> Stuff(App Switcher) -> Use special application switcher\n\n\nThis answers the problem that bisko and senseful had above and avoids the last click or the necessity to be over the icon.\nSingle best gesture in my 'gesture vocabulary' and I have gestures for everything!\n\nA: What about using the Command-tab keyboard shortcut for faster application switching than with the trackpad? Add the ability to quit or hide selected applications along the way by tapping Q or H. Or, use LiteSwitch X for more enhanced app switching.\n\nA: You can also use the keyboard to control the list of running applications that comes up with the four finger swipe left or right (it's the same thing as holding down ALT+TAB).\nIn particular, the spacebar switches to the selected application, so your first scenario can be accomplished easily: Swipe with four fingers to bring up the switcher (it automatically selects the 'next' application for you), and hit space.\nYour second scenario is the same - swipe with four fingers to bring the window up, use 2 fingers to scroll and select the desired app (you can use the arrow keys or tab too), then space to switch.\nAs the spacebar is right next to the trackpad, I find that this is pretty nice :-)\n\nA: Although I think this thread is intended for 10.6, I came to it via search, as Apple has dropped the described functionality as far as any is aware from OS X 10.7/8. I will describe a method to re-implement it below. (Is there a better venue for this?)\nFollowing up on boertel and Orion Edwards' above;\nBoertel describes the functionality as it exists in 10.6. (Which I use all the time, incidentally)\nFrom Orion's, I wasn't aware of the fact that space selected the highlighted entry. (Return does as well.)\nWith these two facts, and BetterTouchTool, I think i've been able to replicate the behavior on 10.8 .\nSet BTT to advanced mode.\nDeselect Action Settings (Window Snapping etc.) --> Settings for Predefined Actions --> Use special application switcher.\nReturn to Gestures.\nIn Global:\nSet four finger swipe left/right to \"Application Switcher\".\nSet four finger tap to \"Send Keyboard shortcut to specific application\".\nSet the keyboard shortcut to \"space\".\n(We could just define the tap as a global space, but I don't want possible random spaces being executed.)\nSet the application to the dock app found at /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app .\nSet Bring app to front before sending the shortcut. (Switch app back does not seem to be required, as the application switcher is changing the focus anyway.)\nSave.\nTest/Enjoy!\nThus far it is working correctly for me. If anyone can/wants to improve on this, please do! Hopefully this will be of some use in the future, to others looking to regain lost functionality. (Why Apple, Why?!)\n\nA: I use (BTT) 3 finger gesture, ( two finger tiptap left ) what works for me  is tap two fingers( leave the two fingers there) then  followed by double tap with the third finger,(let go) then use the other two remaining fingers to slide witch ever app you wish to use  (only active)\n1. In BTT assign the two finger tiptop left to the \"application switcher\"\n2. In BTT Action Settings -> Settings for predefined actions-> \"check\" Use special application switcher\nhttp://www.bettertouchtool.net\n** BTT is an Awesome APP, plus is FREE\nNOTE: you must do the double tap single finger simultaneously, other wise the sliding won't work.\n", "Q: iPhone application compatibility Does the Nike iPhone Sport Kit will work on a 2nd generation iPhone that has the 3.0 update applied? In the Q&A on the website, some say it will, but others say it only works on a 3GS iPhone.\n\nA: The Nike iPhone Sport Kit only works on the iPhone 3GS and later.\nIt won't work on the first iPhone or on the iPhone 3G.\n", "Q: Is data transmitted over 3G secure? When data is transferred from my iPhone via 3G, is it encrypted, or is it relatively simple for a hacker to read the data that's transferred to AT&T's cell tower? What about after it reaches the tower?\n\nA: If you are operating over https, it doesn't matter through what type of connection you are communicating over. All data is going to be encrypted from your browser to the server program. The only way to brake this is to the eavesdrop mediate the communication between you and the your final destination. To solve this, identity certificate were created. This certifies that you are talking to your final destination and not through some mediator. So as long as identity certificate match, you are safe. If the identity certificate does not match the browser will show you a security warning, saying that the certificate does not match, generally they will leave an option for you to go on with the communication, just in case in the operation you are doing you don't care about security.\n\nA: Not in the least. Even HTTPS is secure only from non government or ISP level actors.  Check EFF.org for more, but I warn you, it's damned depressing.\nEDIT: The past is a country that is very hard to visit:\nBruce Schneier's analysis on SSL:\nhttp://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/09/uae_man-in-the-.html\nMozilla's discussion:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.security.policy/OBrPLsoMAR8\nThe open letter in august detailing the problem from the EFF:\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/08/open-letter-verizon\nIt's not that they decrypt it, you see.  Encryption we are all on equal footing until the quantum key or lock.  But people who don't code are not stupid.  SSL you can guarantee security to the server, but the certs themselves come from a chain of trust.\nThe phrase \"I got that government gig!  Homeland Security!  Mary Anne's new boyfriend... F**k You!\" , or similar must have been said at some point. \nAmazon was not the only place after Wikileaks to have a group of sedans pull up. The FBI is screaming right now for backdoors in fact, or rather, to legitimize the backdoors they must have.  Since government, or industrial actors are not 'actors' but 'people' it is not FUD to question it. \nAn example of FUD, would be to highlight say, the complexity of the mathematics and try to use that to prove an answer wrong, and restore faith in a system that worked in the past, while ignoring the forced trust in humans, and the successful exploit in the wild.\nMake sense?\n\nA: A man-in-the-middle attack or snooping from someone sitting in the same coffee shop is far less likely over 3G.  The equipment to do such is far less commonly available, and the expertise required is higher.\nNeither is guaranteed to be secure from say, a government intelligence organization or other large sophisticated operation, as the 3G encryption is not of that grade.  But HTTPS and SSH should protect you from the average snoop over either.\n\nA: 3G can be secure or insecure, it's really down to the particular implementation.  If you are worried about your data while tethering or using a 3G iPad/iPhone then look at it this way, it's more secure than using free/unsecured WiFi hotspots/networks.\nReally the answer to your question is that 3G is pretty secure, but it has its flaws.\n3G is encrypted, the most common encryption algorithms have been cracked, with the right equipment somebody could intercept your information wirelessly.  However, they would need some knowledge, some money and some motivation to do it.  Then in addition to that, they would need your device to send unencrypted data (non https) so it could be deciphered.  All in all it's pretty unlikely but certainly possible that your information could be intercepted.  However, this is a risk for anyone transmitting data anywhere and is not isolated to 3G/WiFi or other mobile device communication methods.\nTry a google search on 3G security and you'll find plenty of information on the flaws and security holes and how they might be exploited. \nJust as an example, here are a couple of presentations:\n3G Security Overview \nblackhat.com powerpoint\n\nA: A man in the middle attack can also be performed using sslstrip which can easily strip the ssl from https, making it an http connection, intercept all the data and use a fake certificate to re-enable the ssl before sending it out to the destination. In simple words that's the idea.  \nThe user will never know what even happened to him/her. This was showcased in Blackhat in 2009 if I'm not mistaken. If Moxie Marlinspike was able to this in 2009, imagine what other pro hackers are capable of doing these days. He was one of the few revealing this for good purposes. A lot of them won't publish the vulnerabilities that they have at their disposal.   \nDon't want to scare you but if you think ssl is secure think twice. It's really up to the browsers to maintain the security of the users. Your faith is really in their hand. A lot of vulnerabilities exist for many years just like the heartbleed before they do something about it.  \n", "Q: Using timed access control in airport extreme base station I have an airport base station model A1354. I am attempting to setup MAC Timed Access so a laptop can only connect between 5:00AM and 11:00pm through the Airport Utility version 5.5.2 (552.11). My AEBS is running firmware version 7.5.2\nWhen I try to enter the time values by double clicking over the time and entering 05:00 AM and 11:00PM the time values don't stay as soon as it looses focus. Instead they become what is in the following screenshot, and the laptop looses connectivity as soon as I update the base station. I also tried entering the values in military time with the same result. \n\nHere is the requested screenshot:\n\n\nA: When you've altered the times, click the '+' button so a second line appears, then click 'Done'.  \n\nA: Are you typing your times in the following format:\nHH:MM  ?\nas in, with a space between the time and AM/PM?\nI know this sounds like a stupid question, but my AEBS has done some stupid things when I tried to type it without the space (e.g. 12:43PM).\n", "Q: will Airline Power Adapter work in a car lighter as well? Trying to see if I would buy this accessory with a new MacBook Air 11'', does anyone know if the Airline Power Adapter work exactly as a charger that we normally use in the car?\n\n\nA: Nope, it says on the package that it was specifically designed for those Airline plugs and will not work in cars.\nPlus, it will not charge your MacBook, it will only power it to run.\nCheers!\n", "Q: Can I bind multiple key shortcuts to the same action? I do a lot of pair programming. Some developers that I pair with use Linux as their primary desktop. So none of the keyboard shortcuts they are used to work.\nWhat I would like to be able to do is bind multiple key chords to the same action. For example I want both ctrl-t and cmd-t to open a new tab in chrome.\nI know that you can rebind shortcuts in system preferences/keyboard. I just don't know how to set multiple keystrokes to the same action.\n\nA: It seems like adding a shortcut in the Keyboard preferences will override the built-in defaults. You can use Keyboard Maestro (a paid app) to add such things - easiest would be to add a trigger for the alternative combo which translates into a menu action or into the original keyboard shortcut being sent to the application of choice.\n\nA: I ended using Karabiner\nprobably not as powerful as Maestro, but for simple needs it does the job beautifully.\n\nA: I use BetterTouchTool for this. Here you can create a keyboard shortcut which sends a shortcut of your choice. Simply as that!\n", "Q: Third Party Mini Display Port to VGA or DVI Cables curious if anyone has any experience with any third party Mini Display Port to VGA or DVI cables? I noticed the cables on ebay selling for around $16. Compared to the official cables that run for around $35 seems like a bargin. Wasn't sure if the quality is the same or if anyone has any experience with buying them. Thanks!\n\nA: The cables from Monoprice.com have recently changed so they're not shaped as nicely as before, but the quality is still excellent for the price. 6ft cable for $10 shipped.\nhttp://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=102&cp_id=10246&cs_id=1024604&p_id=5999&seq=1&format=2\nThe picture isn't faithful to what you'll receive as the Mini Display Port male plug is now a bit bulkier. Still works flawlessly though.\n\nA: Most third-party cables will work perfectly.  In particular, any cables which are digital should perform exactly as their more expensive counterparts.  I've personally used a couple of third party cables which worked without issue.\nI bought a Mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable when the MacBook Pro 13\" Unibody first came out from www.circuitassembly.com and it's great quality and was cheap too\n\nA: A cheap knockoff Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter in I bought on eBay for $7 worked pretty well, but caused a strange problem on my rMBP. Occasionally, when using it, my Wi-Fi would cut out, and switching to an Apple adapter fixed the issue.\nI tested this six ways to Sunday, and the cheap adapter was definitely the consistent factor. It's a weird issue, but apparently I'm not the only one.\n\nA: We got several mini-display port to DVI, VGA and HDMI cables from http://www.meritline.com/ and they work great.  In particular, they have a mini-displayport to hdmi, dvi and displayport (all in one) dongle.\n", "Q: How do I make a bootable USB OS X installer on a Mac? Does anyone have a Terminal command-line recipe for making a new bootable USB flash drive for one of the new MacBook Air's?  Is there a way to dd copy the USB boot device that comes in the box and make the new copy bootable?  I'd like to make a new backup copy of the USB rescue device for my MBA, preferably on a much larger flash drive with room for a backup of some of my working directories.\nAdded:\nAnd is it possible to make, not just a rescue drive, but a bootable USB drive that will boot a fully updated version of the OS (say 10.6.8 or later)?  If so how on a MacBook Air 11, and how big a USB stick will this require?\n\nA: dd makes a byte-for-byte copy of a disk so wouldn't really fit what you're trying to do.  For example, if you used dd to copy your current USB key to a new bigger USB key, the additional space on that new USB key would not be usable because dd copies the partition table, not just the data.\nWhy not just keep your backups on an external drive.  Then you could boot off your rescue USB disk and have your data saved on another external drive.  \nEDIT\nHere's a method of at least cloning your boot disk from discussions.apple.com which seems to have worked for several people\n\n\n*\n\n*Get an 8GB USB stick and format it for a boot disk (partition it with GUID option and (Mac OS X extended (journaled)).\n\n*Insert the Apple USB stick also. There is a invisible file at the root you need to mount on the desktop called MacOSX.dmg. You can use a utility such as Onyx or use the terminal with the open command to mount it.\n\n*Use carbon copy cloner to clone the mounted \"Mac OS X Installer Image\" to the new USB stick\n\n*Unmount the \"Mac OS X Installer Image\"\n\n*Use carbon copy cloner to then clone the Apple USB stick to the new USB stick. Select the delete exiting files. Steps 2 - 4 are necessary because if you just clone the Apple USB stick the new USB stick won't be bootable.\n\n*After this finishes you will now have a bootable copy. You can then also use Disk Utility to create a disk image of the new copy.  \n\n\nHelpful hints:\nTo allow you to view hidden files, in terminal run this command:\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE (hit Enter after each command)\nthen:\nkillall Finder\nAfterwards, to hide hidden files again, go back to Terminal :\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE\nthen:\nkillall Finder\n\nA: If Apple's supported method of using the createinstallmedia tool doesn't work, you can try other options below:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372 - Create a bootable installer for OS X\n\n\nWith OS X El Capitan, Yosemite, or Mavericks, you can use a USB flash drive or other removable media as a startup disk from which to install OS X.\n\nReally - try the above if you can, but as an alternative, here is a simple recipe for making a USB version of the OS X installer + associated tools. (Migration Assistant, Disk Utility, Network Utility, Terminal (that auto mounts your internal drive as needed), Firmware Utility and Password Reset Utility.\n1) Use Disk Utility backup/restore to image whatever Snow Leopard DVD you prefer onto a HFS+ formatted GUID USB drive. I usually first create a IMG of the DVD, but it should work in one shot. Watch for restore errors - you may need the Disk Utility menu command Images -> Scan images for restore... before restoring an IMG to the USB drive.\n2) bless the USB drive by selecting it in Startup Disk or using the command line. (Note - the manual page for bless may be moved, but the command still works on Mojave to bless an alternate boot. You can’t set this to be the default boot with System Integrity Protection but for this use, bless should still work. \nIt's not that hard to make a bootable image and far more secure to DIY. It also avoids the need of downloading commercial software from the internet. Happy media shifting all!\nIf you simply want a bootable thumb drive, just install OSX onto that volume - turning off all the extras you may not need. You can have your USB on one side and the USB install disk on the other to make your bootable drive ensuring all the Air drivers are on your USB bootable drive (which is often an issue when using another install's image - sometimes the drivers are not all there on older builds of the OS)\nThe best trick I have when you don't have enough space on USB to create the final updated version is to stage the bootable image by install first to a 25G partition on an external hard drive.\nYou can finish installing with lots of free space on the HS, run all the updates newer than your installer (10.6.8 for example), make an admin account, install the tools and apps you need. At the end of the process,  you then thin out the things you don't need. DaisyDisk or WhatSize will show you all the large files and libraries. You can safely get rid of a lot of iLife and the associated Application Support. WhatSize has many options to strip out unneeded files, localizations and PPC code. Once you have slimmed down the bootable image on the HD partition, use the trick below to get it on the USB drive. Leopard was a tight fit in 8G but Snow Leopard is lighter and doesn't need to diet as much.\nEdit: Here are terminal commands for rolling your own installer like the (read-only) one that ships with current MacBook Air. I have a Snow Leopard DVD as /dev/disk5 and my USB is /dev/disk6. The man pages for diskutil and asr are helpful if you run into little gotchas or have different needs than a basic one partition drive.\n$diskutil list\n/dev/disk5\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        *7.8 GB     disk5\n   1:        Apple_partition_map                         30.7 KB    disk5s1\n   2:         Apple_Driver_ATAPI                         1.0 GB     disk5s2\n   3:                  Apple_HFS Mac OS X Install DVD    6.7 GB     disk5s3\n/dev/disk6\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                                                   *8.5 GB     disk6\n$diskutil partitionDisk disk6 GPT HFS+ MacUSB 100%\nStarted partitioning on disk6\nUnmounting disk\nCreating partition map\nWaiting for disks to reappear\nFormatting disk6s2 as Mac OS Extended with name MacUSB\nFinished partitioning on disk6\n/dev/disk6\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *8.5 GB     disk6\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk6s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS MacUSB                  8.2 GB     disk6s2\n$sudo asr restore --source /dev/disk5s3 --target /dev/disk6s2 --erase\n    Validating target...done\n    Validating source...done\n    Erase contents of /dev/disk6s2 (/Volumes/MacUSB)?

Remove that portion and/or ignore any errors. You will need to select the USB another way than having bless perform a one step command. This is another reason to just use createinstallmedia from Apple to perform this.\n\nA: Before you're able to create a bootable OS X installer, you'll need to do the following first:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the OS X Installer app from the Mac App Store.\n\n*Mount the volume you want to convert into a bootable installer. This could be removable media such as a USB flash drive, or a secondary internal partition.\n\n*You can then use the createinstallmedia tool to convert the volume from step two into a bootable installer based off the installer app from step one. To learn how to use createinstallmedia see How to create a bootable installer for macOS.\nFor example, assuming you have a volume mounted at /Volumes/MyVolume and the OS X installer app is at /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app you could erase /Volumes/MyVolume and convert it into a bootable installer with this command:\nmacOS Catalina\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Catalina.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume\n\nmacOS Mojave\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Mojave.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume\n\nmacOS High Sierra\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume\n\nmacOS Sierra\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app\n\nOS X El Capitan\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app\n\nOS X Yosemite\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app\n\nOS X Mavericks\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app\n\n \n\nA: Just restored my flash stick with windows utility as described here\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2011/07/04/format-the-macbook-air-usb-restore-key/\nlink for utility http://www.sendspace.com/file/xek3yk\ndon't try to do this through the Virtual Box, use native Win7\n\nA: OK, it is Very easy to do if you can get your hands on the myriad of \"ISO\" OS X installers that make their way onto the internet shortly after any release..  or create an image your Installer disk yourself.... and simply restore it onto a separate partition of your USB flash drive.. all in good ole' Disk Utility...  \nthey key is... DO NOT insert the *.dmg or *.iso file into the SOURCE box. Instead, INSERT THE VOLUME from the mounted image onto the source box in Disk Utility \"Restore\".\nThe only reason to use DD is if you are doing some crazy custom ISO nonsense, trying to fit the installer onto a 4GB stick..  This is how I made a 4GB rescue drive that I still use to this day \"Snow Leo 911\", it rocks...  but if you've got room to spare... just partition that baby up and you'll be good to go.\nHere's a pretty good write up of a similar approach.  Cheers!\n", "Q: iPhone Search does not find historic SMS messages On my iPhone 4, I have a large number of SMS messages (I don't delete them at all).\nIf I want to search for text in a particular message, it appears not to search historic SMSes. In other words, unless the text is visible in the latest messages, viewable on the screen without tapping \"Load Earlier Messages\", it will not match my string.\nAm I doing it wrong? Is this a known issue?\n\nA: Apple does not search for very old text messages as it makes the search much slower. There is no setting to modify the period of messages it should go through, but if you really need this then you can jailbreak and SSH into your iPhone. You can then edit the .plist file and make it search for messages that are even 2 years old.\nNote: This will significantly make the searching slow.\n\nA: I know it isn't a solution for viewing on the iPhone but there is a program called DiskAid will allow you to view past messages on your computer. It uses your backup files from iTunes.\n\nA: Spotlight search not working as expected.\nTaken from engineerings reply on the issue:\n———\n\"What the customer is experiencing is actually considered expected behaviour.  With the release of iOS 10, customers are now only able to search the last 200 messages with Spotlight or the in app search. This would include the last 200 sent and received messages.\nThe 200 searchable messages limit is only after restoring from a backup prior to iOS 10.  This is why devices that had the same Messages database and were not restored from a backup when they upgraded to iOS 10 can still search prior to the 200 limit.\nIf the customer would like to see this function in a different manner going forward, please encourage the customer to submit feedback at apple.com/feedback. “\n", "Q: Is there any free way to have a Mac function as an AirPlay speaker? I have a stereo system hooked up to my Mac mini, but sometimes I'll play music from my laptop. Is there any way for the Mac mini to be recognized as a speaker and allow me to output sound to it (and the speakers connected to it) from my laptop without paid solutions like Airfoil?\n\nA: This isn't free, but it's only $2.99 AirServer\n\nA: Currently streaming from iTunes is only supported to Apple TV and Airport Express speakers. (Thanks @Jonathan)\nYou could try a pretty ugly hack of using home sharing to access your laptop music library from your Mac Mini and then control the playback by using vnc or some other remote desktop app to control playback on the Mini from the laptop.\n\nA: Try Erica Sadun's AirPlayer. That might very well work. :)\n\nA: There is a free utility called shairport which acts as an airport express. If your computers are on the same network, you can use it to stream music between the two, as iTunes will see the computer it is running on as airplay speakers. I recently used it to stream music from my iPod to my computer.\n\nA: If music only, there are a lot free options. shairport is a great choice, open source, support almost all platforms.\nIf you also need mirroring, most free tools are broken since iOS9. \ncheck this one: lonelyscreen. It is free. Only for mac and windows, no linux. And it can capture and save iOS mirroring. I don't use that much, but it is very convenient sometimes.\n", "Q: What features won't I get with a Magic Mouse under Windows XP and 7? I like the magic mouse for the two-finger scroll and other features under Snow Leopard.  Which of those features will not work under Windows XP and 7.  I have XP on a home machine and 7 at work, so I care about both.\n\nA: I have a Magic Mouse on my laptop, and dual boot between OS X and Windows 7.\nThe basic mouse functionality works well, but the scrolling does not work at all (neither vertical or horizontal), and the gestures do not work either, as all of these functions are done by software and don't use the standard MouseWheel commands that windows expects.\nI set it up a long time ago so my memory has faded, but I think you may also have to install the some apple mouse driver package from the Snow Leopard Boot Camp DVD too, but hopefully I'm wrong and you don't need this.\n\nA: You can get scroll (and maybe a few others) by using Apple's Boot Camp drivers. Article here. All the links to the drivers seem to be gone, so you may have to extract them yourself.\n", "Q: How to stream iTunes content to Apple TV 2G without a Mac or PC? I would like to upgrade my 1st-gen Apple TV and was wondering if it is possible to stream to new Apple TV from a NAS drive with iTunes server or an alternate method. I am not willing to go XBMC way since I would like to control my Apple TV though the Remote app for iOS.\n\nA: You can play media that originates on an iOS device using AirPlay to send it to the Apple TV. AirPlay is built in to iOS.\nIf you have a PC or Mac, you could turn on iTunes Match and send the entire library to the cloud. At that point, you could ditch the PC/Mac and let Apple TV play from the cloud. iTunes Match requires a yearly subscription fee.\nNeither of these features requires you to have a Mac or a PC, but neither helps much if all your media is on NAS.\n\nA: It's not possible to stream directly to the new Apple TV from a NAS.  You need a laptop/Mac in the middle.\n", "Q: Fake rectangle/window visible under some windows tricky question here.\nI don't know how long this has been going on, but I noticed it only recently. My semi-transparent windows have a “fake” square/window beneath them, which is visible (it also project a shadow, but only when the window is in foreground.  \nScreenshot:\n (the textedit window serves just as a white backdrop).\nVideo showing behaviour:\nhttp://cl.ly/132M2T0p3j0E210d0S2K\nI initially thought this was just TextMate, but I noticed this on terminal.app too (semi-transparent too).\nI am running 10.6.6, have no “strange” hacks or input managers installed AFAIR.\nI understand that this is probably a very exotic bug, so tools that can help me track down the cause are welcome, and I'll gladly accept such an answer.\nThanks in advance,\nA.\n\nA: I've seen a similar effect before, awhile ago. It's probably a program running in the background that has a transparent window on the desktop. Do you have anything running in the background that uses transparent windows or window overlays? I seem to remember an old version on Norton AV doing strange things like this many years ago. \n\nA: How fascinating! Personally I would dump your Textmate .plist(s) found in ~/Library/Preferences, and see if the window management preferences are garbled just for that app. Worst case scenario, the rest of the Internet is right and there's simply no fix at present. As always, keep them on the desktop until you're certain you can delete them without having worsened the issue.\n", "Q: How do I type š on an international keyboard? I'm currently writing emails frequently to a Slovenian who has the letter š in his name. I use copy and paste for the letter š, which is quite inconvenient.\nI'm using the US keyboard layout.\nHow can I type this letter directly from the keyboard?\n\nA: Right Option (Alt) v s\nYou must have U.S. Extended keyboard layout enabled for the above to work.\n\nA: You can choose edit menu (in most software)  then choose Special Character .. then go to Accented Latin tab and find your character Š.\n\n\nA: Simply hold down the S key and you'll be presented with three options - press 3 on your keyboard to type š. If you need a capital Š just use the Shift Key or Caps Lock.\n\nA: If you have the patience to configure the keybindings, you can try Ukelele and create a keyboard layout for your needs.\n\nA: I'm not near my iMac right now, so I can't test this. But this usually works for me http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.5/en/8504.html\n\nA: I have long had the same problem. My solution: install the Slovenian keyboard layout and set the shortcut to changing between keyboards to Option+Tab. That works very quickly and gives you all the special letters (they are in place of the paranthesis and quotation keys on an English keyboard.) \n", "Q: Change the function of caps lock to insert underscores when the spacebar is hit Is there a way I can change the function of my caps lock key so that when it's on it inserts_underscores_instead_of_spaces_when_i_hit_the_spacebar?\nIt's fine if it just works in Textmate but would be handy in other apps.\n\nA: You should be able to achieve this with Ukelele.  I tried to do this myself but got distracted and then gave up.  The documentation isn't exactly stellar.  \nNote:  Ukelele is just a GUI to simplify the process of editing the layouts manually as they are large XML files with slightly ambiguous element names.\n", "Q: When can we expect upgrade of 13\" macbook pro?

It will use Intel's new Sandy Bridge architectures.\n", "Q: Select whole words using single finger tap gesture If you double click a word to select it, and keep the mouse held down, you go it starts word selection mode, meaning it will select whole words as you move the mouse over them.\nThis only works when using the physical click on the trackpad. The problem is that I want the same behavior using a tap (i.e. the One Finger Tap to Click feature is enabled). When I try to use a tap, though, it goes into character selection mode rather than word selection.\nIs there ant way to perform word selection using tap gestures on a trackpad?\n\nA: Yep!\nYou double-tap and lift off to select the word.  Then double-tap the selected word and start dragging immediately keeping your finger down.  It's actually kind of tricky to get to work without dragging the word but once you get it a couple of times it gets easier.\nHere's an explanation on how to do it also from macworld.com, same as above:\n\nTo select text (and this works in nearly any program that involves\ntext) on a word-by-word basis, do a double-click-and-hold before you\nstart dragging, instead of a single click. As you move the mouse along\nnow, you’ll see that entire words are added to your selection as soon\nas the cursor touches their first character. So if you’ve got a fair\nbit of text to select, but still need precision, this is a pretty\nquick way to get it done.\n\nHere are my trackpad settings\n\n\nA: I'd try using the three finger dragging method. In the Trackpad System Preference, set Three Fingers to Dragging. Double-tap a word to select it, then use three fingers to drag from that word to highlight more words.\n\nA: Double tap this word. Then hold shift and double tap this word. \n\nA: On my MacBook I can triple tap (keeping the finger on the pad on the third tap) and drag to use whole word selection.\nI can also quadruple tap to select the entire paragraph.\n\nMy trackpad settings:\n\n", "Q: How can the colors of a single window be inverted in OS X? How can the colors of a single window be inverted in OS X?\n\nA: You can use Command ⌘+Option ⌥+Control ⌃+8 to invert the video colours of the whole screen.\nThere's no way to just invert the colours of a single window.\n\nA: In Mountain Lion, the Ctrl+Opt+Cmd+8 shortcut was deactivated. I first had to activate it for it to work via Keyboard Shortcuts in the System Preferences in the Accessibility tab.\n\n\nA: ⌘+⌥+ctrl+8 does the whole screen if that helps.\nYou could make the window full screen!\n\nA: Black light software does it, and it does even more.\n", "Q: What does iTunes do while it's \"Verifying iPod, iPad, iPhone\"? What does iTunes do while it's \"Verifying iPod, iPad, iPhone\" \nI see this most often after an abruptl disconnect and plug it back in but also sometimes when doing a second sync immediately after the last sync completes.\nDoes it fix any errors that have occurred on the device?\n\nA: Your computer iTunes is waiting for the iPhone to \"fix itself\" and clean up from the interrupted sync.\nThe mobile iTunes database (and I'm sure several others) will need to be rebuilt to clean up after an interrupted sync. You can see/test this by disconnecting your iOS device in the middle of podcast or music syncing. If you then immediately start up iTunes for iOS - you will get an Updating LIbrary screen while it itdbprepserver does its work. You'll get a \"verifying message\" until these post-sync and interrupted-sync cleanup activities finish. Once iTunes on the desktop has \"verified\" the phone is ready to start another sync, it commences with the normal backup and sync activities. My timing shows the interrupted recovery to take twice the time of a normal sync completion but usually less than a minute either way.\n\n\nA: connect the ipod to a different computer - one with only a few songs in the library you should find the verifying message disappears and does not come back when you connect it again on the other computer \n\nA: I think it's part of the backup process iTunes does for your iPod/iPhone.  I don't believe it repairs anything on the device as such.  You could try deleting old backups if you feel this message is taking too long to disappear.  Backups normally speed up when you delete old ones off.\n\nA: I don't exactly know what it's doing, but since you disconnected your iPhone during sync, iTunes was probably writing data on the iPhone.\nWhen you reconnect it, iTunes is checking if it finished properly the last time and if not, where it was interrupted and if there is corrupted data that needs to be fixed.\nThat's pretty much it. I don't believe there's a process of verifying with Apple's server if your iPhone is legally activated or anything else.\n", "Q: Hibernation mode shows incorrect value? I'm trying to follow the steps in this article to make it so the contents of my memory aren't written to disk every time the computer goes to sleep.\nI'm having trouble in the \"Check the current setup\" step. Before changing these settings, I want to make sure I understand it 100% so that I can revert the changes. It says that I should have a setting of 3 if hibernate and sleep is enabled, or 7 if hibernate, sleep and secure virtual memory are all enabled.\nI'm on a standard user account, but when I go to System Preferences > Security > General, I see that Use secure virtual memory is enabled.\nThe problem is that when I run pmset -g | grep hibernatemode, it returns 3 instead of 7.\nAny idea why there is this discrepancy?\n\nA: The article is outdated (it's from 2006). There is no hibernatemode = 7 in the pmset manual. If you dont want your macbook to write ram to disk, use hibernatemode = 0 (by issuing sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0).\nWhen I want my computer to hibernate and power off I use this hibernate script.\n\nA: I can say that mine also returns 3 even though it's using the secure virtual memory. But to be honest, it doesn't really matter. Set it to 0 if you don't want it to save to the HDD and 3 if you want it to. :)\n", "Q: Disable mouse acceleration Is there any way to disable mouse acceleration on a mac?\nMouse acceleration is what causes the mouse to move slowly when moving it a tiny bit, and a farther distance when moved fast. In other words, I want the mouse to always move the same distance no matter the speed I use.\nI'm using a trackpad, by the way.\nTo understand what I mean by mouse acceleration, try this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Place your finger on the left most side of the trackpad.\n\n*Very slowly, move your finger all the way to the right of the trackpad, and observe that the cursor doesn't move very much on the screen.\n\n*Now try the same thing, but this time move your finger really fast from one side of the trackpad to the other. You should see that the cursor has moved a significant amount of distance more than it did previously, even though your finger traveled the same distance.\n\n\nA: As far as I know, there is no way to do this without external tools.\nUsb Overdrive lets you do this http://www.usboverdrive.com/ and is what I use.\nSteer mouse also has this setting. http://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/ \nMouse Curves http://triq.net/articles/mouse-acceleration-preference-pane-mac-os-x  Has the advantage of being free, but Apple removing the acceleration API in 10.6 may have ramifications on its utility. \n\nA: Go into System Preferences for Trackpad and turn the tracking speed all the way down to slow. What you can't do, I'm afraid, is have the mouse be unaccelerated and also reasonably fast.\n\nA: i like use Acc ExactMouse Pro For Mac \nhttp://www.zarell.com/product/acc_exactmouse_pro/\nit also can disable mouse acceleration with assign application\nEdit: it's available for free at the bottom of this page.\n\nA: I'm currently using SmoothMouse.\n\nAccording to this forum post it should also reduce lag for pointer movement.\n\nFact: the on-screen pointer lags behind the mouse (or trackpad) in OS X more than in other operating systems, such as Windows or Ubuntu Linux.\nTo sum up:\n\n*\n\n*The problem has been confirmed by an Apple engineer (thanks to him for that) in an email correspondence with me. He has also mentioned that they were working on a solution.\n\n*The problem has existed at least since OS X 10.4 \"Tiger\". The current version of OS X (10.8 \"Mountain Lion\") still exhibits the problem.\n\n*Many people confuse lag with acceleration, this is what my blog post was about.\n\nSolutions:\n\n*\n\n*SmoothMouse.\n\n*Running Mac as a Synergy client with a mouse connected to another computer running Synergy server.\n\n*Using Wacom tablet instead of a mouse.\n\n\n\nA: I would like to complement this good topic, with a related mouse setting: \nMacOS also has Mouse Scroll Acceleration/Inertia. \nAnd it can be disabled: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences -> Accessibility\n\n*Scroll down to Pointer Control\n\n*Click Mouse Options\n\n*Disable Inertia\nPicture below:\n\n\nA: You might also look into a third party tool named MagicPrefs to twiddle with the tracking settings on Mac OS X.\nThey have a nice tips section documenting the ability to set a heavy handed \"speed\" (which they call TrackingMouse and represent as an integer) and a more fine tuned \"speed\" (which they call TrackingMouse and represent as a floating value between 0 and 1). It's not clear if they truly disable the \"acceleration\" that kicks in as you move faster. Since that is so built into the \"apple experience\" it may not be easily changed or overridden.\n\nA: Having faced the similar annoyance with my new Magic Mouse, I've come up with a script that doesn't require any third party solution. You can read about it in my blog post. I have this run as a handy menu option on Keyboard Maestro and keep it in Dropbox, but it's essentially just a shell script. So if you're interested here's the script:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Kill Mouse Acceleration and set Mouse sensitivity\n# Author: [Kaushik Gopal](http://journal.kaush.co/475/run-kill-mouse-acceleration-on-login-with-keyboard-maestro) \n# ----------------------------------------\n# Check if the killmouseaccel script is installed in the Dropbox folder\nif !

I got an iPad back in June 2010 and it worked wonderfully for about 30 days; full bars for 3G all the time. I loved it. Then one day the 3G just seemed to quit working and Apple says it is \"fine.\"  Now I hate it!\nHow can I get Apple to admit my iPad 3G does not work and actually fix or replace it?\nHere are more details:  After the iPad started displaying \"No Service\" for 3G most of the time I went to the local Apple store (a Lenox Mall in Atlanta) and they took it for an hour, said they ran diagnostics on it and that \"it was fine.\"  While in the store it did have 5 bars, but by the time I got to the parking lot it was on \"No Service\" again. I'm assuming that Apple and AT&T put 3G signal boosters in their stores to ensure people have no trouble with the signals when they are trying to decide if they are going to buy an iPhone or iPad.\nI didn't have time to deal with it for a while but finally called tech support and they said I needed to replace the SIM card.  So I travelled to AT&T and they replaced the SIM card, and while in the store it was fine. Before I had travelled 1/4 mile it was on \"No Service\" again. So here I'm assuming that AT&T also has 3G signal boosters in their stores too.\nSo time passed because I didn't have time to deal with it and finally was able to get a tech support support person to offer to return it for repair. Hurray! So I went to the UPS Store to ship it back, and then about 5 days later I get an email from Apple saying \"We found nothing wrong, so we are shipping it back to you.\"* Sure enough when I got it back it was exactly as before: \"No Service.\" where other iProducts have 4 or 5 bars.\nNow you might ask, maybe it's really not the iPad but instead where I'm taking it?  I'd consider that might be true had it not worked flawlessly for about 30 days.  Or if I didn't live in Midtown Atlanta where signal strength is strong. Or if I didn't live across the street from the AT&T tower in Midtown Atlanta. Or if I hadn't seen many times where my iPhone 3G has 3 to 5 bars and my iPad had \"No Service.\" Or if I hadn't seen my iPad with \"No Service\" and iPads of my friends with 5 bars.  I've even started taking photos to prove it:\n\n(source: mikeschinkel.com)\n\n(source: mikeschinkel.com)\n\n(source: mikeschinkel.com) \nAt this point my guess is the 3G antenna inside my iPad has failed and Apple's diagnostics don't detect it because they might not have been designed to detect that exact problem. So what I get is the continuous run-around rather than respectful customer service.\nThus far I've wasted about 20 hours on this problem, and at my $75/hour billing rate that's more than 2x what the iPad cost. I'm beyond sick about this. Does anyone know how I can get this resolved without another 20 hours of my time?\nGracious thanks in advance for your help.\n-Mike\nP.S. I bought the iPad for web access when I'm out at places that don't have WiFi and especially for access to Google Maps. But since the 3G became so unreliable I don't even use it anymore. :-(\nUPDATE #1\nI don't have a resolution yet but I have hope, and a story.  I had my assistant take my iPad to an Apple store again and they told her that it was because I didn't have a current AT&T account which was total BS. A working iPad still shows 3g signal without an AT&T account, but since I was in a meeting when she went to the Apple store I didn't get a chance to tell the Apple store person that they were an unhelpful idiot.  \nThen later in the day she stopped by an Apple Authorized Service Center when I was available via phone and the tech at that store told me the same thing (Ugh!). So I gave her my credit card, she signed up for a $15/month plan and then LO-AND-BEHOLD the service tech experienced EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM I HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING (as I expected): Hallelujah!!!  He offered to send back to Apple with his explanation that it is INDEED a faulty iPad.\nSo, with fingers tightly crossed it seems like the answer to this huge fing time sink thanks to Apple's customer no-service might just be to **get 3rd party validation at an Apple Authorized Repair Center. I'll follow up to let others know if indeed this resolved my problem or not and if so I'll name and praise the service center for their help.\n\nA: So, as a follow up, almost 9 months after buying the iPad and after 8 months of it's 3G not working, I finally got Apple to replace it. How? I had an Apple-authorized 3rd party service center look at it. They confirmed the problems and sent to Apple for repair. But it didn't end there! Apple sent it back to them and said it was fine. Grrr.\nBUT, armed with the 8 months of no-iPad-3G love AND with the fact that the Apple-authorized 3rd party service center agreed I had a problem I berated the tech support guy until he agreed to send me a new one no matter what the results of their diagnostics said. And he made good to his word; a new iPad showed up on my doorstep several days later. \nWith that ends the saga of the failed 3G on iPad that Apple would not admit was a problem.\nNow here's the sad, sad irony and how I still feel that Apple got the last laugh on me. The day I got my iPad back was the very same day Apple announced the iPad 2. With all the bad taste in my mouth from this Apple seriously has me looking at an Android tablet for my next upgrade. :-(\n\nA: To help diagnose, jailbreak and use the Signal app.\nWhile jailbreaking voids your warranty, you can unjailbreak and your warranty is restored.

It's something that drives me crazy. The current version (2.0.2) of the official Twitter app for Mac OS X doesn't behave well with Spaces. It moves from space to space when I select another application (switching with cmd TAB.)\nIs there a way to fix this or do I have to wait for a new release?\n\nA: If you want Twitter to stay in one Space, you can assign it to that Space in the Spaces PrefPane. The downside to this is that you have to remove and re-add that assignment every time you launch Twitter. Can't wait for this bug to be fixed.\n\nA: Having looked at the reviews of the app it seems to be a bug so you will have to wait.\nYou could try its predecessor Tweetie which I think is much better.\n\nA: You should also pay attention to the excellent Kiwi app. I wrote a review of this app a few months ago, which has more customization options than the Twitter and Tweetie\nKiwi is gorgeous and so easy to use!\n\nA: Twitterific is what I use for OS X. As a spaces user, I can assure you it plays nicely. It costs $10 which is a little steep but there is an advertisement version so you can try before you buy.

I keep a lot of information relevant to meetings on DropBox, such as minutes, reports, spreadsheets and so on, and tend to refer to them a lot. I like the fact that I can easily navigate my own directory tree in DropBox, and view common file formats on there. However, whilst I have permission to use dropbox for the files I use, I find that I am limited in scope with some meetings, as I'm not allowed to place others on servers that don't belong to the company. I end up having to either bring a laptop, or, more commonly, look over somebody else's shoulder.\nSo, can anyone recommend a solution similar to Dropbox that would work for shares on Windows Server 2003, and allow me to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Easily navigate a directory tree, possibly with shortcuts to commonly-used folders\n\n*View files in MS Office 2003 and 2007 formats and PDFs without lengthy conversion processes\n\n*Not have to go through an intermediate \"copy to the iPad\" step that I might find with, say GoodReader or Quickoffice\n\n\nI'd ideally lie a solution that works on the company wifi network without further modification of the current server architecture, though I can see that in the future, it may need to work over a secure VPN connection from the field if a few other managers decide to take the plunge, so something that's preferably easy for our system administrators to configure and support. A proxy solution that would work in Linux or Windows is possible.\n\nA: A search on the iTunes store for SMB file browsers finds something called - ahem - FileBrowser that sounds like what you need. Haven't tried it myself - although thinking about it something like this might be a help in my workflow. Did I just cost myself $3 by answering a question? \nIt's at http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/filebrowser-access-files-on/id364738545?mt=8 \n\nA: I've looked for similar things in the past.  I think the best short answer is: \"There is nothing remotely similar to dropbox on the iPad that works on Windows shares.\"\nYou might want to investigate the encryption that dropbox uses.  I think all the files on their server are encrypted using a key which is only stored on your ipad?  You might be able to convince your management/IT people that it's okay for you to use dropbox for documents that need to be secure.\nUpdate:\nI've been using a program called BoxCryptor which sits on top of DropBox and adds another layer of encryption.  It runs on my Mac and on my iPad.  I don't know if it's available for Windows, I don't see why not.  I've been using it for a few weeks for some small spreadsheets and it works fine so far.\n\nA: Box.net may be a suitable replacement. I know other iPad owners who have used it for some of these tasks.\n\nA: I'm not too sure if this will apply on your case, but give Tonido a shot.

To date I have had an Apple ID tied to my personal email address. It uses my personal paypal account for the purchases, and currently it has a credit balance thanks to some Christmas iTunes gift cards.\nWith the App Store recently being released, I'd like to buy an OS X app for business purposes. I don't want to use the credit balance on my personal Apple ID account, so I was thinking about creating a new Apple ID just for when I buy apps that I use for business. This way I could have the business Apple ID tied to my business paypal account.\nHowever, I'm concerned that there might be some gotchas with using two different Apple IDs on the same MacBook by the same user. Before I just try this blindly, does anyone have any experience or know of any gotchas?\n\nA: There are a couple of gotchas I'm aware of.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you buy apps on both iTunes accounts, they all get listed together when updates become available, not just the ones on the account you're currently signed into.  So if you click 'download all free updates' iTunes will only download the updates for the account which is signed in.  This can be confusing because you've told it to download all free updates and it doesn't tell you why it hasn't downloaded the others. \n\n*If you have an Apple TV and you want to use Home Sharing, then you can only share the content for one account at a time.\n\n\nA: I've been using 5 accounts in 3 different countries for the past 18 months. I wouldn't say that there are any gotchas, just some annoyances. \nThe biggest annoyance is related to apps being in different App Stores - if I'm in the US App Store and click an update for an app purchased in th UK App Store (and there's no way to tell by looking at the list), I have to go through the whole process of being sent to the other App Store, signing in, checking updates, clicking Update again. You shouldn't have that problem if your accounts are for the same App Store.   \nThe other annoyance is that even in the same App Store, you'll need to update your Apps in batches. Clicking Updae All will update the apps for the current login, and that will leave you with some remaining apps. Click Update All again, and you'll be asked to sign in with the other account details. \nI would love the App Store to work in a more streamlined way. \n\nA: Won't really be a big deal, it can help you keep your Mac App Store purchases separate from your iTunes Store.\nOnly issue would be if you somehow forgot which account was signed in to a device and started buying on the other account.\nI imagine you can keep that straight though if you are ONLY using the Mac App Store account on the Mac(s) you own.\n\nA: I do have several Apple IDs, one each for the iTunes Store accounts (more than one country, but that's another story) and one for the Apple Developer Program.\nFor the Mac App Store I'm using the same account as for the iTunes Store, though.\nI've not had problems so far.\n\nA: I use a German and a US Apple ID; switching as described by anthonyg works. However, I also find that switching IDs can turn off and even break iTunes Match (which is a strange beast as it is), making syncing with other devices unreliable. Different story. But a way around this problem is to create a separate iTunes library; IDs are connected to libraries and are not hardwired into system preferences.\n(You can switch libraries easily by holding down the Option key while clicking the iTunes icon; a small window pops up asking you whether you want to create a new library or select an old one.)\nI use this separate library every other week or so just for getting app updates and the occasional content item on the German store; after iTunes has downloaded the files, I simply copy them into the \"Automatically add to iTunes\" folder of the main library (which uses my US ID), and they get added next time I switch to this main library. \nI have not experimented to find out whether my main library accepts this \"alien\" content only because I previously had switched to a different ID while using this library, but I suspect this is the case. Anyway, this makes things easier for me.\n\nA: just add additional profiles (users) on your mac.  \n", "Q: Why does my Mac Pro have two ethernet ports on the back of the computer? I'm curious as to how or why I might want to take advantage of two ethernet ports on the back of the tower?\n\nA: @Griffo Had some great ideas, I have one more:\nShare your network connection with another computer. Usually, you'd use a router, but what if you don't have one, or it's misconfigured? You could connect your external network to one port and use network sharing over the other.\n\nA: *\n\n*If you wanted to connect to two different networks you could use this.  So say you had an internal network which you had your own computers all linked to but were not connected to the internet, you could use one port to connect to this network.  Then you could connect the other port to a broadband router/modem and access the internet on your Mac Pro.  It's really more of an interest to businesses than domestic users.\n\n*You could also use the second port to connect to Network Attached Storage (NAS) such as a MyBook World or similar.  This would allow you to use the full bandwidth of one port for backups to disk while not affecting the speed on the other network.\n\n*Backup interface in case one fails.  You could have each interface connect to different switches on your network in case of a failure on one you still have access to the network on the other.\n\n*There's also something called link aggregation which allows you to combine the ports to act as one port with twice the speed.  However, this depends on your other network equipment supporting this mode.\n\n\nA: Provide one of the ports to a Virtual Machine for bridged networking. This allows the guest VM to have direct access to the network on its own IP instead of sharing the host's network card via NAT.\n\nA: *\n\n*Connection to the modem for your regular internet.\n\n*Network connection to an old Windows computer for easy file and data sharing.\n\nI am glad mine has 2 ethernet ports.\n", "Q: Unable to install Boot Camp on iMac For some reasons I could not install Boot Camp on my iMac.  I tried to defrag, reinstalled OS X, repair hard drive but nothing seems to be working. I kept getting error \"The disk cannot be partitioned because some files cannot be moved\".\nI have VMware Fusion but it seems to be very slow to what I want to do on my computer. So my only option is Boot Camp (unless there are other software like Boot Camp out there).\nAny suggestion I should do?\n\nA: Personally, I got around this issue by doing a complete reformat and reinstall of everything. I installed OS X first from disc, then created the Boot Camp partition, then installed Windows. \nIt definitely isn't the prettiest solution, but a solution nonetheless. I would advise at least waiting to see if anyone has an idea for how to move those \"unmovable\" files before diving head first into this. \n\nA: Sounds like boot camp might be running into a space issue.  Boot Camp might have trouble moving your VMWare files.  Can you move them elsewhere (off your iMac) and retry?  The issue may not be due to overall disk capacity but rather that Boot Camp is trying to use a portion of the disk which is occupied by something it doesn't want to move.  As far as I know, the partition you allocate needs to be placed in contiguous space.  Even running a defragmenting program doesn't guarantee you won't have fragmentation.  You could try reducing the size of the partition you're allocating to Windows incrementally until you get success to see if that's the issue.\nEDIT\n@Jon Are you running an Intel-based or PowerPC-based Mac?  Boot camp won't work on PPC-based macs and just by the sounds of an error you were getting on your other question I'm thinking maybe you have a PPC Mac.\n", "Q: How can I activate buttons with just the keyboard?

Hitting ⇥ will cycle between options, with a blue outline around the other button, but the default will remain blue.  Hitting ↩ will always select the default, space will select whichever button is highlighted. \nIn this example, pressing ↩ will 'Keep .txt' and pressing space will 'Use .bak.'\n\n\nA: See full Keyboard Access at the bottom of the following screenshot:  \n\nWhen a prompt window like the one you included appears, the selected button will be highlighted in blue.\nScreenshot:  \n\nThen you press the space to action that button.\n\nA: Tab to move to the next dialog box.\nSpace to select\n", "Q: Is it possible to use an iPhone without a SIM card as an iPod touch? Is it possible to use an iPhone without a SIM card as an iPod touch?\nI have an old iPhone 3G that no longer has a SIM card and I want to use it as an iPod touch.  How can I achieve this?\n\nA: There is an Apple support document on how to do this.  You don't need to keep a sim in the phone but you need to put one into it to activate it before taking it back out.\nHere's the procedure for 3G and 3GS:  \n\nYou can use any SIM card associated\n  with the carrier that your device\n  supports to activate the phone. Simply\n  place a SIM card from the last carrier\n  with which you used your iPhone into\n  the device, and activate it. Then\n  remove the SIM card. You can now use\n  the iPhone 3G or iPhone 3GS as you\n  would an iPod touch (Wi-Fi only, no\n  cellular service).\nNote: You can use the activated SIM card from your new iPhone to do\n  this.\nTo re-activate an iPhone 3G or iPhone\n  3GS that displays the \"Connect to\n  iTunes\" screen:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Insert a SIM card from the carrier with which you used your phone. Note:\n  If you are using the same carrier, you\n  can use the activated SIM card from\n  your new device to do this. If your\n  device is unlocked by your carrier,\n  you can use any SIM card.\n  \n*Connect the iPhone 3G or iPhone 3GS to iTunes on a computer connected\n  to the Internet. iTunes will then\n  activate the device. You can remove\n  the SIM card at this point and use the\n  iPhone as if it were an iPod touch.  \n  \n\n\nA: I use my old iPhone 3G as an iPod with no problems. When I moved to an iPhone 4 I removed the sim, wiped the iPhone 3G, and it works fine. It shows No Sim in the top bar, but it works fine as an iPod and connects to my wifi with no problem. \nWhat kind of problem are you having? Any error messages?\n\nA: You want to keep the old sim in the phone. iTunes servers will remember that specific SIM and allow the phone to be unlocked each time it gets restored.\nThe phone company will have removed that SIM ICCID from service so the phone will say \"waiting for service\" or \"waiting for activation\" but otherwise keep functioning as a wifi only device. GPS will work if installed. Even location will work using GSM triangulation as the phone can see the cell towers even though they won't let it on the network for data.\n\nA: I assume your iPhone already activated, yes you can. Just remove your SIM card while the phone is on. Done.\n", "Q: The application DGAgent quit unexpectedly -- repeatedly pops up every time i \"ignore\", \"report\" or \"relaunch\" Before this problem occurred I have been trying to defrag my disk using Drive Genius 3 and repair using disk utiltity.

This happens every I start up my iMac.  The message pops up every time I click \"ignore\" \"report\" and \"relaunch\" buttons.  Can you tell me what it is and how to fix it?  Also this causes some of my applications such as Skype \"cannot be opened because it is not supported on this architecture\".\n\nA: The error you're getting from Skype is because you're not using an Intel-based Mac.

If so, you might want to install the drivers in the Mac OS X DVD. \nD:\\Boot Camp\\Drivers\\Apple64.msi\n\nA: Try to Uninstall the USB host drivers using device manager and then \"Scan for hardware changes\" to re-install them. \nMight not work but its worth a try.\n\nA: The drivers that come with windows should work already. Bootcamp doesn't install any new driver USB-wise.\nMost likely you got a bad windows installation. I would try the same disc on another machine just to be sure.\nedit: Unless, of course, it's not an issue with the USB itself. Here's a good troubleshooting guide from microsoft. The only thing that it says about the USB itself is that it may be defective - even if it works on Mac. Hardware issues can be quite complex.\n\nA: Finally, I've got the solution.

I've chosen smth like 'decide later' and continued my work. When later I tried to setup time machine preferences I couldn't find the way to set my USB HDD as time machine drive. When I press 'Select drive for backup' i see empty list, nevertheless my drive is plugged in and works well.\nBtw, it is ntfs-formatted, could it be a problem?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: You can backup to an NTFS-formatted volume.\nI backed up my Mac (Yosemite) with Time Machine as per Graham's answer here (https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/57082/134740), but I had to use a .sparseimage, as a .sparsebundle image failed to be created on the NTFS volume – for details on the differences between the two, see: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22247.\nIn terms of restoring that image for recovery purposes, I tested it by restarting and holding the keys Cmd+R to boot into Mac OSX Recovery (https://support.apple.com/en-ie/HT201314) and Time Machine could not find the disk.\nI had to start Disk Utility, mount the image manually, then go back to Time Machine and it could see the volume and all the available backups in it.\nI didn't actually go ahead and start the restore but I assume if it can see the backups, it should be able to restore them : )\n\nA: You can't backup to an NTFS formatted disk as stated below:\n\nNote: Every available disk that can be used to store backups is listed. If you’ve partitioned a disk, the available partitions are listed. Time Machine can’t back up to an external disk that's connected to an AirPort Extreme, or to an iPod, iDisk, or a disk formatted for Microsoft Windows (NTFS or FAT format).  If you select an NTFS or FAT-formatted disk, Time Machine prompts you to reformat the disk. Choose a different disk or reformat the disk in Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format. Because reformatting erases any files on the disk, only do this if you no longer need the files or if you have copies of them on a different disk.\n\nThis quote is from the apple support page for Time Machine \nYou could always reformat the disk in Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format which would allow you to use it.\n\nA: Copied to A Super User answer to Equivalent for Time Machine that writes to NTFS disks:\n\nBackup to NTFS\nIf you wish to use Time Machine in Lion or greater with an NTFS volume – and if you have a  write-enabled driver for NTFS: \n\n\n*\n\n*with tmutil you can configure Time Machine to back up to a sparse bundle disk image, the .sparsebundle stored on NTFS. \n\n\nIn some situations you may find that Time Machine simply offers to use an NTFS volume. This may occur if, say, a write-enabled driver for NTFS is installed before a physical disk with NTFS is introduced to OS X. \nRestore from NTFS\nOS X can read NTFS, and so should be able to restore from a .sparsebundle in this environment. \nWhether Recovery OS is similarly prepared to read from NTFS and restore, I don't know. \n\nA: As others said, you cannot use it directly.\nThe only way I found is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a virtual disk in VMDK format\n\n*Mount it using some freeware tool\n\n*Create a sparsebundle in the VMDK\n\n*Configure TimeMachine to use that VMDK\n\n\nNote that the intermediate VMDK is needed to prevent OSX from unmounting the sparsebundle (expect that behaviour if you mount a sparsebundle directly from an USB disk).\n\nA: If you have some data on the disk and don't want to format whole disk and disk itself is quite big make a certain partition on the NTFS disk. Do it on PC with Windows XP/7 using Partition Magic or Partition Menager then format this partition in Mac OS Disc Utilities with Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format. Next open Time Machine and choose disk. You should see both NTFS and Extended (Journaled) portions. Choose Extended (Journaled) one and backup your Mac.\n", "Q: Do all magsafe power ports have the same form factor? I have a MacBook6,1 with a 60W magsafe power adapter.  The cord on the adapter got chewed up by my rabbit (she's fine) and I would like very much to replace it.  But I really don't want to spend the $79 on the Apple Store!  \nI've seen magsafe adapters for as low as $27 elsewhere, but the connectors look different than mine.  \nThis link, from Amazon, also 60W, claims to work for MacBooks (all of them, or some of them?), but is much less expensive: http://amzn.to/f3Xsc7\nInspecting the connector in the picture, the only difference I can see is mine is \"L\" shaped and the the one in the picture plugs straight in perpendicularly.  If the connectors have the same form factor and the power specs are the same, it seems that I could get away with the cheaper one.\nSo, will all magsafe adapters plug into my macbook and charge it?\n\nA: Yes - the computer side of things is the same, but the newer cord layout is needed for Airs or when the space around the port is restricted.\nThe 'L-shaped' MagSafe adapters were just a newer design which meant the cable went backwards instead of outwards.  They should fit just fine and I've used one or two third-party ones in the past.  Just as long as you pick the right power-output you should be fine.  Here's a TUAW article on the matter\n\nA: I've used a 2007 MacBook MagSafe adapter on my 2010 MacBook Pro with no problems. They are smart enough to switch voltages depending on the model. \nI'd still try and find the right one for your machine though just to be safe.\n\nA: The design was changed to prevent strain on the cables. They can be used interchangeably. \n85 watt adapters can be used on any portable.\n60 watt adapters the 13' MB, MBP, MBAirs and 11' Airs\n45 watt adapters is for the MBAirs\nSome units will work on lower voltages but usually won't charge the battery and if the unit is dead without a charge it won't start. \n", "Q: How to increase size of the Spotlight search results window? Is it possible to increase window width of the Spotlight search results under Mac OS X 10.6.6? I mean the semi-transparent \"instant search result\" window appearing at the top right corner under magnifying glass, not the Finder window.\nThe standard window is too narrow: longer file names or Dictionary word translations just don't fit there. Why not using more screen space for the search result?\n\nA: Have you looked at using 'Alfred' as search tool - It's free on the App Store and very flexible, and has a wider results view. If you try it, take a little time to get familiar with the options - I find it a fantastic time saver.\n\nA: There are hacks for the resultant Finder window but nothing for the actual results pane dropdown\n\nA: I am not sure this answers to the question (and moreover I am using 10.5), but you already know that if you hover over a result for a couple of seconds, it shows the complete file name and path, don't you?\n\nA: I would suggest using Quicksilver. Note that it is still in beta, but it is a pretty stable beta. It is a little complicated to use, but it is more that just a replacement for Spotlight. It has smart capabilities, so it remembers what you typed recently. For me, I use Chrome a lot, so when I type \"C\" it automatically knows that I want Chrome. It also does provide dictionary results from dict.org and it displays them in a way that you can see them. Let me know if you do use this as it can be confusing for new users.\n", "Q: Can I connect an iPad and an Eye-Fi Card? I have the Eye-Fi Pro X2 Card and an iPad.

It didn't really delete them, as in I still have the original files in the /Library/Fonts folder, but they've disappeared from Font Book, so I can't use them. \nNow, Apple says that you can select a folder to install all fonts in that folder, but when I try that, the spinning wheel (not the beach ball) comes up in the lower right hand corner for a few seconds and then leaves, without installing any fonts. The same thing happens if I use the + sign in the menu bar, select multiple, or if I try validating and then installing (actually, that installs one font). \nIs there any way to mass-install these fonts or will I have to install them one by one?\nSystem info: Mac OS X 10.5.8 running Font Book 2.1 (123).\n\nA: I'll bet you have a font corruption problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Split the uninstalled fonts into two groups.\n\n*Import the first group.\n\n*Check to see if they imported successfully.\n\n*\n\n*If yes, you know the problem is in the second group, so go to step #1.\n\n*If no, the second group might be okay, so try importing that.\n\n\n\nAnd so on.\nYou should be able to narrow down the problem without having to import each font one at a time.

I'd like to jailbreak my iPhone but have it appear to my network provider as if it isn't jailbroken. This should be do-able, but what do I need to do to make this happen?  \nI have an iPhone 4 currently running iOS 4.2.\nEDIT:  Canadian politics is tricky.  Part of the potential new copyright law would make defeating any sort of weak sauce encryption illegal. Essentially, the copyright holder would have it's rights fully supported, and as for the user, well they get what's left. This is going on at the same time as our bandwidth cap issues. I just want to be proactive, for when the \"unforseen QoS problems\" begin to arise here. So, not a neutral ISP situation.  \n\nA: The network provider can't see if it's jailbroken or not. They might be able to detect if you're using Skype over 3G or other non-3G apps but they won't be able to discover it by simply jailbraking it.\n\nA: The only visible change that jailbreaking does is the installation of the cydia app on your homescreen.\nwhat i would suggest is to go into cydia and get an app called Poof to hide the cydia icon. You can follow the guide here http://www.iphoneappsandhacks.com/how-to-hide-icons-on-iphone-or-ipod-touch.html, or you can hide it in a folder with a bunch of other apps.\n\nA: If that's true why can some apps detect it anyway? I installed e.g. Voddler on my iPhone yesterday; a free app to see movies without a charge. I can't see any movies because the app detected my iPhone as jailbroken and I got a message saying that jailbroken devices are not allowed to play the movies. \n", "Q: Does a Wireshark implementation exist for iPhone 4?

The Delete key doesn't seem to do anything most of the time. When I try to create a shortcut using it (to display the key code) it acts as if it's dead.  Other keys around it (Home/End/PgUp/PgDn) seem to work fine.  \nNow here's the really interesting part. When I push the key in text edit, it seems to do a delete-forward.\nI want to use this key with Cmd (the Windows key on my keyboard) to move files to the Trash. Can anybody explain why this key is acting the way it is? Can anyone suggest a utility which will tell me which key I am pressing on my keyboard?  I used to use xev on an X Windows system.  Is there something like that on a Mac without X installed?\nActually, I want the Delete key, by itself  to do what Cmd Bkspc does in Finder. It moves a file to the trash.\nBut the standard OS X keyboard shortcut window won't accept any of the keys in the 6-key block with (Ins/Del/Home/End/PgUp/PgDn)\nIt's interesting.  When I first pull up the keyboard viewer, it shows a diagram of a standard Mac keyboard.  As soon as I hit one of the above 6 keys, the map changes to an extended keyboard closer to what I have.  But the diagram has my Cmd/Opt keys swapped.\nIs there any way for me to tell the OS I am using an extended keyboard?\nThe frustrating thing is, Mac OS is training me to use that key.  It does something useful in lots of built-in applications. But I can't assign it to a hot key.\niCal - deletes an appointment (Cmd+Backspace does the same)\ntextedit - deletes forward\n\nA: That's completely normal. The key called delete on Windows is called forward delete on OS X, even though it's often labeled like delete ⌦. It deletes a character forward in text views. It doesn't delete items in many applications like Finder, presumably because it would be too easy to press accidentally.\nMany shortcut recorders don't allow using just forward delete as a shortcut. You can often edit the property lists that store the shortcuts directly though. See How to remap delete and shift+delete keys to delete and permanently delete a file in Mac OS X Lion?.\n\nA: Perhaps you should replace your generic PC keyboard with a modestly-priced external USB keyboard designed specifically for Mac OS X.\nI use the Matias USB 2.0 keyboard, which costs US $30.00.\nMacAlly makes a range of models that start at US $20.00.\n\nA: There's an (albeit old) application called \"AsyncKeys\" (http://asynckeys.mac.findmysoft.com/)\nYou'll need Rosetta for this to run if you're on an intel mac.\nIt should tell you what key you are pressing.\nCheers.\n\nA: You don't say whether you've tried it already, but I'd try the built-in OS X Keyboard Viewer first -- you access it from the menu bar, but you need to turn it on in the Keyboard system prefs, Keyboard tab first.\n\nA: ControllerMate should do the job. \nIt lets you map any key to any function anywhere (aside from hardware keys like the on/off button). All functions are keyboard-specific, that is you can and must consider each keyboard separately. E.g. my ShiftLock keys function as a left-hand equivalent of Return, ⌘-Return, ⌘-P and Delete and Forward Delete key, in combination with modifiers. \nOnly problem: it's not really the most straightforward UI, with flow sheets on a plane and several floating windows. I spent quite some time trying and configuring some media keys... Still, a single reassignment is pretty simple. \nMost important: it's a hack close to hardware but it's been rock solid on Leopard and Snow Leopard, after a short period without a stable version. No comparison to some vendor's drivers.\n\nA: Use BetterTocuhTool to assign cmd+delete to cmd+backspace. I have just done this for my old full USB Mac keyboard (alu/white) on my M1 Macbook Air : \n", "Q: Could an upgrade edition of Windows be used to install boot camp if you connect two external DVD drives? I found the following FAQ on Apple's website:\n\nWhy can't an upgraded version of Microsoft Windows XP or a full version of Microsoft Windows XP that does not include Service Pack 2 (SP2) or later be used for installation?\nAn upgraded version of Microsoft Windows XP cannot be used because you are required to validate your copy of Windows by inserting an original Windows CD, but there is no way to eject the first disc until after Windows installation is complete and the Boot Camp drivers from the Mac OS X 10.6 DVD are installed.\n\nAnd so I was wondering if you had two DVD drives hooked up to a MacBook Air, could you install boot camp using an upgrade version of Windows 7?\n\nA: What are you trying to upgrade it from? If the answer is WinXP, then no.\nFrom Apple's 10.6 bootcamp install pdf:\n\nUpgrading to Windows Vista or Windows 7\nYou can upgrade Windows XP to Windows Vista or Windows Vista to Windows 7.\nNote: If you’re using Windows XP, you cannot upgrade to Windows 7. You can perform\na clean install (also called a custom install), which erases your Boot Camp partition.\nBefore you perform a clean install, make sure you have the installation discs for all your\nprograms and a backup of your personal files and settings. You can restore them after\nthe installation.\n\n\nA: The upgrade version of Windows 7 works slightly differently to Windows XP. While I can't speak with 100% confidence, I believe you can do a full install of Windows 7 from the upgrade media without needing an existing OS disc to insert.\nThis article outlines a method to achieve this, with some caveats (i.e. it's not on a Mac, but on a PC).\nhttp://www.winsupersite.com/article/windows-7/clean-install-windows-7-with-upgrade-media.aspx\n", "Q: How can I work with highlighted text annotations from Good Reader in Preview? Good Reader on the iPad has two forms of annotating PDFs:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can press and hold a location, and press Note to create a note icon with an annotation.\n\n*You can select text, and then press highlight. You can then tap the highlighted text and press open to add a text annotation to this highlighted text.\n\n\nI sent an annotated PDF to my mac via email. Preview handles the first annotations very well by displaying an editable note. The problem is with the second form of annotations. While Preview does show the highlighted text, there doesn't seem to be a way to easily modify, view, or copy the annotation that goes along with that text.\nIf I hover over the text, I can see the annotation text that goes along with the preview. What I would ideally like to do is one or more of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Identify which highlights have text or don't have text. Currently it is very difficult to know if a highlight has text or not. The only method I know of is to hover over the text and see if it contains a tooltip or not. Ideally I want the annotations list on the right panel to show me which highlights have text annotations.\n\n*Copy the text from the annotations. It's currently located in a tooltip which cannot be selected.\n\n*Modify the text in the annotations, e.g. using the same interface that normal text annotations can be modified.\n\n*Convert these highlighted text annotations to the standard text annotations that Preview handles well.\n\n\nA: Probably this is not possible with Preview, but there is another (free) PDF reader that allows you to do this (at least your first three points, don't know about converting into another annotation kind): Skim.\nAfter you've opened your PDF in Skim, you can choose Convert Notes... in the File menu. Then you have all your notes from Goodreader in the drawer panel on the right.\n", "Q: What areas of the MacBook Air should I keep clear? According to the User's Guide of the MacBook Air, it says:\n\nSet up your MacBook Air on a stable work surface that \n  allows for adequate air circulation under and around the computer. Do not operate \n  your MacBook Air on a pillow or other soft material, as the material can block the \n  airflow vents.\n\nThe only airflow vents I see are in the back right where the screen and keyboard meet. Thus, I'm wondering if covering the front 90% of the bottom of the MacBook Air with something soft such as a cloth (i.e. the part with no vents) will have any adverse effects on the cooling mechanism. The only thing I can think of is that the bottom of the laptop acts as passive cooling by having that little bit of air between the bottom of the laptop and the desk its sitting on. Having it on a cloth or something similar would no longer provide this air cushion and would affect the cooling mechanism of the laptop.\nIs my theory about how the passive cooling works correct? Or is it fine to use the laptop on something such as a pillow as long as it doesn't cover the end that has the vents?\n\nA: You are correct. While the major fan vent is in the back, it is important that air can circulate under the laptop. This is because the bottom side of the laptop can get hot, and the space between the laptop and the (hard) surface helps release that heat. A soft, squishy surface will just trap it and push it right back up into the computer.And a computer with only one fan vent needs all the help it can get.\nThat said, you should be OK using the laptop on something soft for most of the time. It's when the fan starts spinning that you really should move to something more solid.\nTo keep an eye on how hot your computer is,\\ and how fast the fans are going, I use the free iStat Pro widget.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Cooling can occur via radiation, in addition to advection, convection, diffusion, etc.\nA fan moves air which both advects and convects. But your laptop can also dissipate heat via radiation, which happens through any surface, and does not require holes or slots.\n", "Q: Does MoneyWell have a \"jars\" system?

Then I want MoneyWell to track that \"jar\" for me, like if it's positive, I'm obliged to spend it (or transfer it to an untouchable savings account). If it's negative, it means I'm over the budget.\n\nA: I think that is how moneywell works.\nEvery month or week depending on your salary period you allocate your income to buckets (which  think correspond to your jars) and then when you spend anything you take hat money from a bucket. If the bucket is positive you are in budget otherwise you had better work out where to cut your budget.\nThe buckets are your budget are are a different split to you accounts which show where all your money is saved etc.\nSee the video tutorials for more examples. \n", "Q: How do I set up DynDNS on my MacBook? I want to create a host name that points to my MacBook dynamically, so I can have a chance to take back the control if it was stolen. I opened ssh and vnc, but I have no idea how to find my machine. Maybe DynDNS is a solution?\n\nA: Go to www.dyndns.com and register.  Then install the dynamic updater on your Mac and follow the installation instructions.  This will then connect to www.dyndns.com and update your DNS information whenever your Mac is connected to the internet.  You could then use SSH or other means to log onto your Mac from an iPhone or other computer/Mac by connecting to the URL (e.g. - mymacbook.dyndns.com) you select upon registering on dyndns.com.\nThere are another couple of steps.  You need to get your broadband router to forward traffic coming in on specific ports to your Mac.  You should be able to find a how-to on www.portforward.com for your router model. You also need to setup a static IP for your Mac which is best done on your router.  Your routers documentation should tell you how to do this.\n\nA: Another option (a bit more pricey) in addition to the one suggested by Griffo's would be signing up for MobileMe (\"Back to my Mac\").\nOr if you are by chance operating your own domain name server somewhere, you can set up dynamic DNS there yourself through the Sharing->Edit... tab.\n", "Q: Duplicating images and resizing one of the copies in Automator I am trying to create an Automator action for a workflow I often need for web publishing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select some images inside Aperture \n\n*Export two copies of the original image with different resizing settings applied (say, a 1000 px version for viewing and a 150 px thumbnail)\n\n*Rename the exported copies, prompting me for a file name\n\n\nI have not yet found a possibility to actually duplicate input files and then work with one of the duplicates in finder.

Is it safe to carry MacBook with HDD in a bag while it has been put sleep? I.e. I know there are some risks of hard disk drive damage if one tries to shake them or rotate them while they're working. But is the HDD working while the Macbook is asleep?\n\nA: The HDD is put to sleep while the computer is sleeping. Unless you wake up the computer, the HDD will be safely spun down with the needle out of the way.\n\nA: MacBooks are fine to be transported when in sleep mode.  When a MacBook goes into sleep, it takes 20-30 seconds to save the current state to the HDD, while this is happening you'll see the status light shine brightly.  Once it goes into a slow pulse, the MacBook is asleep and the HDD is inactive so there is no risk to the HDD from normal movement in a bag for example.  Just make sure you don't throw it into the bag until it's fully asleep.  MacBooks also have a 'Sudden Motion Sensor' which can prevent damage to the HDD by the computer parking the head of the HDD if it detects that it is being shaken or is falling.  Read about it on the apple support pages or in the excerpt below:  \n\nSudden Motion Sensor technology is built-in protection for the hard\n  disk, designed to help prevent disk issues if the computer is dropped\n  or if it senses unusually strong vibration. Apple has adjusted this\n  feature carefully to provide the best balance between protecting the\n  hard drive and preventing unwanted activation of the Sudden Motion\n  Sensor. Most Apple portable owners never need to turn this feature\n  off. Apple suggests that you not modify the settings unless absolutely\n  necessary.\nIn some environments, such as live concert halls, recording studios,\n  or dance clubs, external vibrations may be major enough to cause the\n  module to unexpectedly park the hard drive heads, resulting in\n  interrupted sound or video playback. In these situations, you may find\n  that you want to disable the feature temporarily.\n\nAlso see page 23 of this manual \nand page 16 of this manual\n", "Q: Which Wireless-N Routers are compatible with Apple products? I have an iPhone 4, iPad, and MacBook Air, all of which support Wi-Fi 802.11n.

How do I know which routers will be compatible with my Apple products?\n\nA: The simple answer is buy an Airport Extreme\nOtherwise use the internet and read reviews.  Virtually any draft-N or official N spec routers will 'work'.  As with anything, the only way to be absolutely sure is to try them out.\n\nA: I think you would be hard pressed to find a router that won't work correctly with the products listed. However, if you are concerned get any N router (non-draft) and you will be flying. As for features, I'd go for the cheapest router that supports a USB port (for connecting printers or scanners) and a few wired connections.\n\nA: All n routers should be compatible.\nYou can always check to see if they have firmware updates as well to bring them up from draft to spec and finally, unless all of the devices that are going to be using it are n (I'm thinking our Wii and wireless printer in the apt here), then you'll end up having to turn b/g on as well - which they all can connect to.\n", "Q: Cropping frustration in iPhoto 11 -> iMovie 11 \n*\n\n*set up a slide show.\n\n*select 'sliding panel' theme.

What more do I have to buy if necessary?\n\n*What kind of tuners are in the market? What do you recommend?\n\n\nA: The answer is that it depends on what you have at the moment.  If you just have a cable outlet in the wall and the cinema display then yes you need something in between such as a tuner.  The type of tuner will depend on the type of signal being sent by your cable TV provider (digital/analogue).  Then you'll need a cable which will connect the tuner to the cinema display and you'll also need separate speakers.  This also means that your tuner will have to have an audio outlet to connect to the speakers.\nWith a standard analog TV signal, the TV itself is the tuner.  With a digital signal the tuner can be built into the tv or it can be in a set-top box.  To make the cinema display function as a TV you need to have a digital signal and then you need a set-top box which would allow you to change channels.\nTo recommend specific tuners etc. you would have to describe specifically what your cable TV connection is and how you are expected to connect it to an ordinary TV.  Then you can work on figuring out how to connect the cinema display which is just like a digital TV with no speakers and no remote. \n", "Q: Does the use of SSD give one a dramatic performance boost? I use Mac book pro 15\", and it's time to buy a new one.\nFor HDD, now I see a new option of SSD, which is pretty expensive.\nI can expect shorter boot-up time and faster access of files, but I'm not sure if it's worth the money. \n\n\n*\n\n*Does the use of SSD give one a dramatic performance boost?\n\n*Is buying SSD from Apple a good idea? It seems the price difference between HDD and SSD is more than the price of SSD in retail.\n\n\nA: TRIM is a slightly outdated concern with the latest SSDs, it was a big problem with first or second generation drives. If you choose the right drive - one that has been recommended by many is the OWC Mercury Extreme Pro - then you should have no noticeable speed degradation. If you must have SSD now the Sandforce controller is probably your best option, not what Apple offer as BTO.\nIf I was buying a new Mac today I'd still take the traditional drive just because price/performance is not quite there yet on SSD, even though performance increase is huge. If you can live with your snappy new MacBook Pro for even six months without a SSD (and I bet you can), and then buy a SSD and upgrade yourself you will pay less for more capacity. Additionally you may see drives based on 25nm flash technology become available using even less power with even more speed and capacity.\n\nA: SSDs on MacOS X will be significantly faster, for a while. However, the OS does not support the TRIM command, so it will slow down significantly, to the point where a full wipe (zeroing out the drive) will be necessary.\nMore reading here: http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/apple/2010/07/01/mac-ssd-performance-trim-in-osx/1\nAs you'll see from the review, it's not a good idea to buy from Apple because their SSDs are slow to start with. If you do go with a third party drive, make sure that you're aware of the need to zero it out periodically, at least until OS X supports TRIM.\n\nEDIT: As pointed out in the comments, SSDs that don't have TRIM support can still have an efficient Garbage Collection algorithm that mitigates the problems of not having TRIM, so your net effect is still a superior performance over mechanical drives.\nThat said, I'm sticking to the mechanical drives for now, for personal reasons, in that I find them more reliable over the long term than SSDs. This opinion may well change in the next few months or years.\n\nA: I disagree with Randolph's Answer. If anything, the article says exactly the opposite of the \"good performance for a while\" part. \n\nWhat we found was the exact opposite: an OS that doesn't appear to be affected by SSD performance degradation\n\nAnd I don't have Apple's SSD. I have an OWC on a Mac Pro and haven't had any performance degradation since I brought it, about six month ago. Before that, I had an Intel drive and also never had degradation problems under OSX. I changed the drive because my 1st drive was too small. That Intel-M drive is running on a laptop with Windows 7 Home Premium. \nSo far, it has been proven that OS X doesn't suffer from the lack of TRIM support; what we don't know if that's because the OS/FileSystem is doing something different or because there's TRIM support hidden and not reported.\nIn any case, getting a SSD is really a performance increase. I only use it for the OS and some minor things, the rest sits on a mirrored SATA RAID, but this is a Mac Pro, so things are different. \nOn small Macbooks, the usage of SSD is like day and night and I haven't seen performance degradation over the course of a Year. \nMaybe there is one, but if that's the case, it's so slow that by the time is significant, you'll be either changing the drive or the whole computer. \nI've been using SSD since late 2009. \nI recommend you don't get one from Apple, as they tend to overcharge. Get one of the many SSD's alternatives like Corsairs, Intels or the OWC I have, which I heavily recommend. \nBut the SSD market is in a constant evolution, so read before you buy. \n\nA: Great performance boost, apps cold startup is 1-5 sec, depending on the app\nI have a 2,5\" 120GB Intel 520 SATAIII SSD and HDD setup in 2011 MBP\n\nTRIM enabled with Trim Enabler, after restart 'Yes' appeared.\nExecuted some instructions from http://blog.alutam.com/2012/04/01/optimizing-macos-x-lion-for-ssd/\nIf you have lots of RAM and not using Photoshop or virtualization (VirtualBox, Parallels, etc) than section \"Use RAM disk or HDD for temporary files\" could a performance boost\n\nA: It gives a huge boost. My MacBook now boots in just 8 seconds, down from a minute and a half.\n", "Q: How to make iPhoto library back into bundle I recently recovered from a disk failure and while most of my files are ok, I'm having trouble with my iPhoto library.\nWhile it appears that the data fro the iPhoto library is intact in the recovered files, the library now appears as a folder rather than a bundle.  As a result, iPhoto will not recognize or open the library.\nIs there any way to make it back into a bundle either from the GUI or via the Terminal?\n\nA: EDIT: Changed my answer.  :-)\nI copied my iPhoto Library, and removed the extended attributes (a piece of metadata called com.apple.finderInfo). It then showed up as a folder rather than a proper iPhoto Library. I then fired up iPhoto holding option, and selected this folder as my iPhoto Library. It accepted it and changed the type, putting the metadata back, and all was well. I suspect this is what needs to happen in your case as well, it looks like as long as the files are there, iPhoto will do the work for you. \nOld answer: I think you can rename it to 'iPhoto Library.bundle'.  It will then take the form of a bundle.  You can then remove the '.bundle' from the file name and it should (still) act bundle-like.\nNot really sure though.\nEDIT: or .app\n\nA: You could do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move or rename your existing folder that is not behaving correctly.\n\n*Launch iPhoto with the Opt key and select a new library. \n\n*Select the default location: /Users/*yourname*/Pictures/iPhoto Library\n\n*Quit iPhoto\n\n*Select the new library in Finder and then select \"Show Package Contents\"\n\n*Drag everything from your old mis-behaving folder into the new folder\n\n*Launch iPhoto (without Opt)\n\n", "Q: Using a SuperDrive temporarily for one time installations? Does Apple (or any oter company) have such a service which would let you temporarily use a SuperDrive (or other external DVD Drive)? I have a MacBook Air and in order to install boot camp, I need an external DVD drive. Paying $80 for a one-time use of a DVD drive sounds absurd. For that reason, I was wondering if Apple or any other company has some kind of service which allows you to bring in your laptop and use a SuperDrive for one time installations. I wouldn't even mind paying for such a service as long as it's significantly lower than the $80 for a SuperDrive. \nAny other ideas besides buying a cheaper alternative of the SuperDrive?\n\nA: You can use the CD drive of any other computer (Mac or Windows) on your network, for free. See this Apple doc for directions.\n\nA: Hmm.  If I were you, I'd find a way to image the DVD and deploy it onto a USB stick.  You never know when you might need it.  I think it's as simple as imaging it, and then in Disk Utility, \"restoring\" the image to the USB device of your choice.\nBut I've never done that, so I don't know.\n\nA: If you really want a ONE TIME install, go to any Apple Store and let them use one of the drives there. I'm sure they'll have no problem. Tell them you want to try before you buy ;)\nIn other news, you can put Windows 7 on a USB Stick and install it from there. I've used the DVD only once, to create the USB Stick. There are instructions over the net on how to do that, even from outside Windows (but if you have a Win machine to do it, it's faster because there's a free tool).\n", "Q: What iPad apps are available that support handwriting recognition? What iPad apps are available that support handwriting recognition?\nAre there any good iPad apps for taking notes that can recognize handwriting?\n\nA: You might like to checkout Writepad - it sounds like it does pretty much everything you are asking. I've used it before, and found it worked pretty well. It's only $4.99US at the moment as well, so maybe a good time to give it  a go.\nI also use Plecodict which is an English-Chinese dictionary, which has handwriting recognition for learning new characters (and an optical recognition mode as well) - just mentioning it because you didn't specify a certain language.\nGood luck.\n\nA: WritePad is definitely a good option. PhatPad, from the same publisher (Phatware), also does it, along with standard keyboard input and some drawing capability.\n", "Q: What are the bad points of the iPod Touch? I'm thinking of buying an iPod Touch. But first I'd like to know what its bad points are so I can decide better if it's suitable for me and if I can find better alternatives.\nThe reason why I'm considering the iPod Touch is because I want a device that is not a phone, I can listen to music and podcasts while walking, and it has a browser (wireless connection is fine) on which I can quickly check news and tweets. Perhaps I should add that this would be my first Apple product.\nSo I'd like to learn from your experience. What don't you like about an iPod Touch?\n\nA: Look at it this way. If you want to play games and use apps, browse the internet, all that jazz, you want the touch. If you want to carry every song you own and maybe some videos, get an iPod classic. If you are a jogger who only needs a few songs at a time, get a shuffle or nano.\nAlso, someone said it was slippery. This is correct. Get a case if you have a touch. I dropped my 2nd generation and shattered the screen when it hit at the corner. I have a 4th generation now and got a case for it just in case. The classic isn't as slippery, but it's always nice to have a case for any device you're going to be whipping around with you all the time.\n\nA: No GPS and it doesn't vibrate :)\nOther than that I think Apple has done a fantastic job on it. Make sure to get the latest one though.\n\nA: In my day to day usage I only found on thing missing wich is quite annoying and IMHO a design flaw: There is no mute/pause-resume button or any way to pause and resume the playback with one single click. You always have to get that device out of your pocket, turn the screen on, unlock the screen, go to they playback controls and press pause/play. \nBatterylife is also an issue if you play games or run wifi enabled apps. But you won't find any other device that is better in that regard either.\n\nA: *\n\n*If you're using Windows, you're basically locked into using iTunes to manage your content; some people don't like iTunes.\n\n*Syncing non-media content is weird, too. There isn't a unified sync system. I sync calendar via Google Calendar, notes via SimpleNote, and general files with Dropbox. Some apps only sync with your computer over WiFi, which is a hassle for me at work where the wireless network is not set to permit this. Sync is really important for the iPod Touch because it's nice to have a lot of your data at hand all the time, but it's a pain to type it in manually because it's so small.\n\n*You can't easily update podcasts on the device. I couldn't sync for one week one time and had to update each episode by finding it in the iTunes store.\n\n*It's really smooth, so if your hands are greasy it's easy to drop. Mine has handled drops well. I'm glad I use plastic screen protectors, though.\n\n\nThese are the most potent drawbacks I could come up with. I haven't found any comparable devices that solve these problems any better, though. Non-phone smart devices that fit in your pocket that aren't iPod Touches basically don't exist now; there are some Android devices in the works. I'm delighted by my iPod Touch and absolutely recommend the device.\n\nA: I own an iPod touch, and it is a cool device. The most useful feature it has, in my opinion, is the app which allows you to use it as a remote control for my Mac Mini when using iTunes. The screen is a bit small for most other activities, such as reading and typing. Therefore, based on what you wrote, I would suggest buying an iPad instead. I prefer my Kindle for reading. I plan to buy the new generation iPad so that I can comfortably browse the net while laying in bed or my couch. I can't stand typing on a small or touch screen, therefore I don't see my Macbook losing favor any time soon.\n\nA: After owning an iPhone 4 I really don't like the shiny case any more. It is way slimmer than the iPhone 3 and I just can't grip it or pick it up well since there is so little of it and it is very shiny and slippery.\nApart from that if you don't want 3G networking I don't see many disadvantages.\n\nA: iTunes is horrid at organising music (especially if you have an existing library not created using it), and slow too. It's a shame such good hardware is lumbered with a 3rd rate application. On Windows MediaMonkey is a viable alternative since it keeps pace with Apple's constant tinkering with the database structure of the iPod. If it wasn't for the Upnp apps like PlugPlayer, I wouldn't be so enamoured with mine.\n\nA: I think the lack of a camera and Bluetooth make it much less useful.  \nThe sort of all in one device that does everything but the phone is great.  But not quite there on the Touch yet.\n", "Q: how can i subscribe to a podcast series from itunes on my ipod touch I see i can download individual podcasts one by one but i can't figure out how to subscribe to an entire podcast going forward on my ipod touch. \nis this possible or can you only do this from itunes on your computer??\n\nA: As far as I know, you can't subscribe to them from your iTunes app on your iPod. \nThe easiest way I know of is to subscribe to whatever podcast you want to listen to in your preferred feed reader, and then whenever that podcast is updated you'll see it in your feed. From there you can just choose to play or download it. Hopefully this helps solve your issue.\n\nA: Although it doesn't integrate with iTunes, Instacast will let you subscribe and download new episodes to podcasts.\n", "Q: Best audio converter for Mac I'm searching for an audio converter for mac with wide capabilities. It should be able to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert to flac (not from flac)\n\n*Split cue files into separate tracks\n\n*Grab audio CDs\n\n*Edit ID3-tags in batch mode\n\n\nAbility to convert different audio formats to MP3 and ALAC would be a big plus :)\nIf there is no such ultimate tool, could you please provide links to some separate tools that have the different functionalities listed above.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I use Max converter  It can converts to many format but have some cons too :(\n \n\n\nA: My suggestion is the same presented here previously, but I use them for different things.\nBoth Rip and XLD are good rippers for Mac. They support AccurateRip and use MusicBrainz for metadata, so you get certified rips with good tags.\nI always rip first to FLAC (single FLAC file + CUE) and them convert the rip into individual MP3 files. If I need to rerip, I go for the FLAC file, not the CD.\nIf I used XLD for both tasks, I would be constantly messing with the configuration, changing from FLAC to MP3, and every now and then would forget and rip to the wrong format. So, I use XLD for the initial rip and Max to convert the FLAC into MP3.\nLater I learned about SBooth's Rip and started using it instead of XLD. Rip's advantage is that it adopts a smarter ripping strategy, only resorting to more powerful ripping technique when it finds a problem. So, initially Rip tries to fast rip a CD and match against AccurateRip, if it succeeds it is done otherwise it will try to overrip and else.\nSo, usually, Rip is a lot faster than XLD and will generate a good rip, but now and then it will rip nothing because the CD has a fatal flaw. For those, I use XLD, that will try a lot harder to make a Rip and produce a file even if it can't rip correctly.\n\nA: My favorite converter is XLD. It converts to flac, splits cue files, it supports metadata correction (using CDDB), and embeds album artwork. It is the closest I could find to dBpoweramp.\n\nA: Max always crashes for me, had it on a few different versions of OS X too but it has a tendency to crash when you select the formats pane in the preferences. \nThe best fix for this bug that I have found is to trash the files in ~/Library/Application Support/Max then relaunch the application. \nStay away from mediahuman unless you like being infected with adware, it is infected with Nod32, a variant of Win32 /drweb OpenCandy.A/ Adware.OpenCandy.39. It is only adware but the way that it embeds itself deep into the OS X system means that it has root access and could quite easily do a lot more harm.\n", "Q: How to nuke everything from imac and start it at the beginning from scratch like i first bought it I have some problems that i cannot resolve on my iMac and now I would like to delete everything and start it from scratch like when i first bought it a few years ago.

I've been looking at buying a used ipod touch from craiglist but I'm confused as to what's what. The adds all say things like \"2nd generation 8gb\" or \"3rd generation 16gb\" and I'm not sure what the difference is. \n\nA: The short answer is processing speed, screen resolution and memory. The newer ones are obviously faster, and the lastest generation (4g) includes both front and back cameras for shooting video and video calling.\nFor a full list of the differences check out this wikipedia page.\n\nA: The long answer:\n1st and 2nd have 128MB RAM while 3rd and 4th have 256.\n3rd and 4th also come in 64GB versions as well as 32GB. The 4th added back an 8GB model. \n2nd added Bluetooth (Only in iPhone OS 3.0)\n3rd added voice control.\n4th also has a Retina Display. Though not the same quality as the iPhone 4. Still it's nice and high-resolution. (It's an LCD, not an IPS for price reasons.)\nAnd the 4th has two cameras as well. Still not as nice as the iPhone ones.\nProcessor is as follows: 412MHz, 533MHz, 600MHz ARM processors in first three versions.

Open Console from the Utilities folder, and find kernel.log.  See if there are any interesting lines at the time the crash happens.  Probably a few lines with \"NVDA\" in them.\nIf you open System Preferences and then Energy Saver, you can adjust the graphics mode - try setting it to high-performance (discrete) all the time.  Either the system will freeze right then, or you can attempt the same tests.  If you still see trouble, it's time to talk to Apple.\n", "Q: Can I control the music player on my iPhone from a PC?

Instead of Boot Camp partition, I installed it to OS X :(  So now I cannot repair the drive using disk utility because i grayed out.  The drive is now called \"disk0\".  I tried to reinstall OS X using the Mac OS X install disk but it cannot see the drive.  the drive is not even on the list.  How can I get it back, PLEASE HELP!!!\nFWIW when I boot up my computer without the mac osx install DVD, it says \"no bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key\".  So it's obvious that the mac partition is overwritten by windows (read first post).

Notice the important information, you have to select your DRIVE and not the partition. Then you have to select \"Partition\" in the tabs and finally click the little \"minus\" sign (which is Grayed out in the image).\n\nNow when you boot with your Install DVD, you can open Disk Utility from the Menu during the initial stage of the install, when you're still being \"welcomed\" to OS X's install. \nTry it from there and DiskUtility will launch (it will take a few seconds, since the DVD drive is not as fast as a Hard Drive) and try to remove the partition from there. Remember to \"Apply\" the changes. \n\nA: Boot the install disk and run Disk Utility from that.

I would like to have two iTunes libraries with one being automatically organized and the other letting me choose where to store the files. When I create a second library it seems to share the same preferences as the first (the settings are actually iTunes preferences). Is it possible to have separate settings for my libraries?\n\nA: iTunes preferences are stored in\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist\n\nI presume you access your two libraries by launching iTunes while holding down the Opt key.\nAn alternate method to launch iTunes and swap out pref files at the same time would be to make an Automator or AppleScript app that switches pref files, and makes a link from ~/Music/iTunes to one of the libraries, then launches iTunes for you.\n\nA: Here is an example of an Apple Script someone wrote to solve a similar problem, be sure to read their situation and change the script for your needs:\nhttp://forums.macnn.com/82/applications/358119/itunes-applescript-question/\n", "Q: How can I use Gmail to sync my calendar between Mac OS X and Android? I've recently bought an HTC Desire and I'd like to sync my calendar from my MacBook Pro (Os X 10.6.6) with the calendar from the phone. I suppose it would be easiest to do it over Gmail, but I'm not sure how. I checked their site, and there is a simple tutorial how to do it if you want Gmail calendar events in iCal, but I need the opposite. How to do that?\n\nA: The approach I took was to sync my phone with the gmail calendar and then sync iCal with google calendar. I don't sync directly between phone and mac.\nI can add events on all three now and it will sync between all of them.\nedit: I've been asked to post up a screengrab, but it honestly isn't needed. I've seen the guides on setting up CalDav but it's honestly not required, iCal has a really simply method to add an account which makes it extremely simple to do.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch iCal\n\n*Go to File -> Preferences\n\n*Delete any accounts you think you might have set up incorrectly\n\n*Add an account with the + button\n\n*Leave the account type as Automatic\n\n*Enter your google email address\n\n*Enter your google password\n\n\nThat is IT! I have a personal and work calendar on google calendar and it brought both in.\n\nA: You are correct in thinking that the Google Calendar is the best way to go.\nTo sync between Google and your Mac you can set up the Google calendar as a CalDav, Google have a comprehensive guide for this. If you already have everything in iCal you may have to export them into the Google calendar web interface, this is just a case of selecting \"Export\" in iCal and \"Import\" in Google calendar. FWIW After using this hybrid approach for a while I've actually started using the Google calendar web interface rather than iCal as it is a bit more flexible and gives more are to work with.\nI'm not too hot on how to set stuff up on Android, but I thought everything was linked to your Google account anyway? (Google do have a similar guide for Android, but I've not used it).\n\nA: If you're syncing Google Calendar to a Mac, be sure to checkout BusyCal.\n(It's accurately referred to as \"iCal Pro\" and will sync to Google Calendars, MobileMe, or generic WebDAV calendars.)\nThere's a demo on their website.\n", "Q: How can I map buttons on my PS3 controller to keystrokes on my Mac? I purchased a PlayStation 3 controller for use with my Mac. It's paired via Bluetooth. It works great in emulators such as Snes9x, but I'd like to use it for other things as well. Is there any software that will allow me to map buttons on the controller to keystrokes?\nI've tried USB Overdrive and as far as I can tell, it doesn't do what I want.\nI'm on Mac OS X 10.6.6.\n\nA: Yeah there's an application called \"ControllerMate\" that you can get here http://www.orderedbytes.com/controllermate/ . You pair the controller to the mac with USB (I think Bluetooth will work too but you might have to look up special instructions), then use this app to bind the controller functions to keys and mouse movements.

Whenever I start Safari on my iPhone it insists on bringing up the last bookmarks folder I happened to be in. Is there a way to disable this behaviour and just have it present me with an empty page when I start up the app? I don't use bookmarks and the process of waiting for that bookmark view to show up and then dismissing it is surprisingly time consuming.\nThis is mobile Safari on iOS 4 running on an iPhone 3GS. The phone has not been jailbroken.\n\nA: As of iOS 5.1 Mobile Safari no longer opens your bookmarks folder when you start it on your iPhone. It shows you the empty browser screen and you have to click on the bookmarks icon to bring up the bookmarks list.\n\nA: There is no way to disable this.\nHere is how to reproduce: Close all \"Tabs\" in Mobile Safari on iPhone. Exit Safari. Open Safari again. It will briefly show a blank window and then it will open the Bookmarks, in whatever Bookmarks folder you last looked at. (Note: Mobile Safari on iPad does not do this. It just opens to a blank page.)\nWorkaround: Enter the URL \"about:blank\" in one tab. Open new tabs for your actual browsing then, before exiting Safari, close all but the \"about:blank\" tab. When you re-enter Safari it will show you the \"about:blank\" page and not open the Bookmarks folder.\n\nA: Ok, here is another answer, now that I better understand what is going on. Thanks Stephen W. Carson.\nYou can set a \"Home Page\" in Mobile Safari, via a tweak available in Cydia.  It requires a Jailbroke iPhone, but it is called \"Home Page in Safari\".  You could set \"about:blank\" as your homepage.\n\nA: Are you talking about the bookmark bar like is on the iPad?\nYou can turn that off in Settings->Safari->Always show bookmark bar.\nhttp://www.pocketpccentral.net/iphone/news/2010/04/ipad-safari-tip-turn-on-the-bookmark-bar/\n\nA: \nWhenever I start Safari on my iPhone it insists on bringing up the ... bookmarks folder\n\nIt does this because whenever you stop using Safari you close all tabs.

After I've converted, tagged, etc. all my new shows or movies, I change the preferences in iTunes to the drive that contains whatever I'm about to add to the library. For example, if I'm going to add a new movie, I switch the \"iTunes Media Folder Location\" to the 2TB drive, add the movie, then change the preference back to the 1.5TB drive.\nThis just seems silly to me, and I know I could create a RAID but I don't want to move all that data around so there has to be a better way to do this.\n\nA: What I would do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have only 1 library\n\n*Make sure that iTunes is configured to keep all your media organized (and point your single iTunes Library to your preferred disk)\n\n*When adding files to your iTunes library hold down Option/Alt to let iTunes know that it shouldn't copy the file to where your library is\n\n\nThis way all your data will be organized by iTunes except for the large files that should belong on your largest external disk in the first place.\nCheers...\n\nA: \nI don't want to move all that data around so there has to be a better way to do this\n\nI'm not sure this actually works, but it should. The only solution I can think of is to replace the Movies/Music folders in your \"main\" iTunes folder with alias folders (or symbolic links) to the corresponding folders on separate hard drives.\nYou would need to ensure the hard drives were always mounted when using iTunes.\nThat said, I think the best solution is to get an easily expandable external raid or NAS enclosure like the Drobo or ReadyNAS.\n", "Q: To-do app for Mac OS X I want to organize my to do's for programming an iphone app. I found this, and I really like it, but is not native to Mac OS X.

One disadvantage that it is paid application.\n\nA: iCal that ships with OS X has a ToDo List feature that works well.\nYou'll need to be more specific about which features of MyTinyToDo you like, if you are wanting better recommendations.\n\nA: I use ToodleDo for all of my To Do lists. It's a website so it is accessible anywhere (I use it as the default page in my browser on my laptop) and they have a native iPhone app that does a great job syncing. It's not Mac-native, but it is very agreeable to Mac users and you can export your lists as iCal calendars if you so choose. You get a lot of functionality for being free, but it does pay to subscribe if you have long-term uses for it.\n\nA: Just an idea, but you could run MyTinyToDo locally in apache and put it in a widget and put it on your dashboard.  Or use GeekTool to float it on your desktop.\n\nA: You have a lot of good apps for what you'd like to plan. My suggestions are:\nOmnifocus for iPhone (it's one of the most expensive on the market but the features are excellent)\n-Todo a simple but convenient Todo app, really similar to the one you mentionned and easy to handle, with a cloud sync service for tasks\n2Do the one that I can't live without (no joke!), probably the most complete planner app on iPhone.\nHope this will help you make your mind ;)\n\nA: You have the great wunderlist which is free, provides collaboration and a companion iPhone app (also free). Does what it's made for. Customizable and sexy :)\n(No I don't work at 6wunderkinder!)\n\nA: Well if you want \"native\", Why not simply use Mail? It has a \"notes\" section and it'll sync w/ any ios device out there... Make a new note & at the top type in \"To do\" & go for it, doesn't get much more \"native\" than that. \n", "Q: AppleTV and sorting TV Shows I've been wondering how to organize my shows by Show, then season and then episode because I have, for example, 6 entries for Bones (one for each season), 7 for Star Trek TNG, etc. and it just looks like a mess (Imagine if you had all 22 seasons of The Simpsons), is there something else to clean this up?\n\nA: So far the best solution i've found with an ATV2 is just to use playlists. The files themselves are named ShowName.S01e01.ext, then i've sorted each show into a playlist so that I can watch them continuously without going back to the menu between episodes.\n\nA: You can enter in sorting values for files in the Info window. Select a file and click File>Get Info will open the window, just go to the Sortingtab where you will find two columns, the left being the actual value and the right being the \"Sort\" value. So, for your TV shows, you can enter \"Star Trek: TNG 1.1\", \"Star Trek: TNG 1.2\", \"Simpsons 1.1\", \"Simpsons 1.2\", and they will all appear in the correct order in the list.\n\nA: THe problem is, that ATV \"overrules\" the sort field (\"Sort Name\") entry with it's \"Date Added\" or air date value. The sorting only has effect as long as the \"Date Added\" values are the same...\nUnfortunately there is no way to change this tag in iTunes and no other sort option in ATV (1st gen) other then Show, Date or Unwatched available...\n\nA: Only the first generation did what you're suggesting. I was very disgruntled to learn that newer (HD) AppleTV incarnations did away with this feature. I have hundreds of TB of shows and it's annoying as hell to scroll through a list of multiple seasons, rather than a list of shows.\nYour only real option is to number each episode (ex. 1-100) then select all episodes, \"GET INFO\" and override the season option. Leave it blank. Then when you click on a THE SIMPSONS you will have one long list of episodes in order. It won't be broken down by season, but at least the list of shows will be cleaner.\n", "Q: Mac App Store works like trying to open iTunes via browser Greets everyone.\nI've updated to 10.6.6 but my Mac App Store doesn't behave well - see screen below:\n\nIt seems to be constantly trying to open iTunes for some reason.

They won't clear. The update is clearly installed. I know this because the new features in the changelogs are visible in my apps when I open them. The update process itself also works smoothly; meaning the progress bar gradually fills for each item in the update list and displays no errors. The badges will clear, but whenever I go and click on Updates again the badges and all previous updates return. It's very annoying. How do I fix this?\n\nA: LMAO, I finally figured out the problem! I had completely reinstalled Snow Leopard from scratch and used SuperDuper to make a backup clone of my hard drive beforehand (which I had always been doing for backup). Then before putting anything else on, I had visited the Mac App Store to reinstall some software when I noticed it said I had all my apps already installed. It didn't take long to figure out that the Mac App Store reads any cloned hard drives you have attached and interprets them as installed apps as well. This would certainly explain why it thought I still had the older versions still installed. Huge bug.\n\nA: Try uninstalling and reinstalling the app from the AppStore.\n", "Q: Application to Monitor Battery Usage by Application I want to know what's draining my iPhone battery. Is there an application that can monitor / estimate battery usage by application?\n\nA: This is not feasibly possible or even reasonable. The battery is just used. The system can track the current battery status and current usage, but it is not possible to track where exactly the power goes. It just all goes into the circuitry, the CPU, the Display, all things that the application uses. No application uses more battery than another unless it relies upon the hardware to a different extent, such as more complex apps will require more battery power because they need more CPU threads, and apps that can locate you will take even more because they need to power up the GPS. Using this logic, you can estimate which of your apps use the most battery.\nOn the other hand, you can try to measure battery usage manually. You can close all other apps from backgrounding and keep the phone in airplane mode with battery % display on. Then open an app and track how long it takes to drop by 10% from 100%. Then charge the phone again and do it all over for another app. The most important thing is to ensure the phone is operated at a constant temperature under 50 Degrees F and under completely constant runtime variables. This is the only way.\nIf you built the application, on the other hand, you can use a utility called Instruments to monitor the status of various aspects of the iOS device to determine the approximate battery drain more efficiently. This will get the status for the entire device, however, as, like I said, it's impossible to tell on an app-to-app basis. Instruments also relies upon the iPhone being tethered to the computer, which means it won't be running down the battery anyway, so Instruments only gives power consumption information.\n\nA: The Cydia app \"App Stat\" will show you a rough approximation -- it shows a list of your apps, ranked by # of times each has been started, and also how long each has run. \nThis doesn't directly correlate to power consumption, but it might be just as relevant for you to see app usage?\n\nA: From iOS 7 this information is shown in Settings > General > Usage > Battery Usage.\n\nA: Check out this article if you are a user:\nhttp://9to5mac.com/2014/09/27/ios-8-track-battery-usage/\nAnd this article if you have experience with programming:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/MeasuringEnergyImpact.html\n", "Q: Why should I jailbreak my AppleTV 2G? Why should I jailbreak my AppleTV 2G? I'm confused on what extra functionality it brings. I understand you can browse the full internet with something like a typical web browser, but that doesn't interest me at all. What else is there?\n\nA: Other options are installing XBMC or Plex, and having much more control over your Apple TV - you can then play any media format, more easily access data from your other computers, access the full internet (as you pointed out) and find lots of different plugins for a range of different things.\nIf you are interested, you can check out this article on Lifehacker about jailbreaking and installing XBMC - it's really a very straightforward process.\nIf you'd like to have a play around, you can also download XBMX and Plex for your Mac or PC to see what they are all about. Good luck.\n\nA: Jailbreaking your ATV2, will open up the hardware to utilize software that is available to enhance your usage.\nPersonally I jailbroke my AppleTV2 because I wanted to be able to watch shows / movies from my home server.  Shows / Movies that were NOT in apple approved format, nor were they shows that I wanted to convert and put into iTunes.\nXBMC is great in that regard, as you automatically get access to a TON of options that you don't get with the standard ATV2 iOS software.  Plugins for things like HULU Plus, Amazon Prime, Vimeo, etc.  \nThe jailbreak (untethered) is very simple to do, and the tools available make the whole process painless and easy.  Just google for details and follow the steps.\nAnother approach that you might not think of is for Canadians, who wish to view American programming (due to limitations and Geo locking).  You could easily with a jailbroken TV setup a proxy that would allow someone in Canada to then view US programming without being GEO locked from places like HULU, or AMAZON PRIME, etc;\n", "Q: Why do the keyboard brightness keys sometimes stop working? Occasionally after turning my keyboard brightness all the way down to 0 manually (Which I do sometimes at night if I need to leave the machine running while it processes something) it won't allow me to turn it back on.\nIt gives me this symbol when I try. It usually lasts until I reboot. But is not easy to reproduce as it does not always happen.\nSomething tells me this is unanswerable, but I was hoping someone else might have discovered this problem too.\n2010 2.4GHz MacBook Pro.\n\nA: This is actually quite a clever little battery saver Apple have built into the MacBook.  There is an ambient light sensor next to the iSight camera on the unibody models or on both sides of the keyboard, under the speaker holes, on older models.  If the MacBook determines that the light in the room/outside is too bright for the keyboard backlight to be of any use, it will turn the backlighting off.  Then you can see that overlay to indicate that you don't have control of the brightness because the macbook has disabled it.  \nYou can test this by putting the keyboard brightness up to full brightness and then shining a light/torch at the area around the iSight camera (or speaker holes) and you'll see that you cannot control the keyboard brightness while the light is shining.  \nOnce you turn the light off, the keyboard brightness controls will function again.\n", "Q: Can I plug two external monitors in to a MacBook Pro? I'd like to use two external monitors for some excels, coding, email, not games or video content. \nCan someone please explain how I can go about using two external monitors with my MacBook Pro, and realistically, how good will the performance be of the 2nd external monitor? \n\nA: In order to attach two or three monitors, you could use a third party device like Matrox GXM (Graphics eXpansion Modules) - you can connect two or three monitors from your Display Port, however, there are some limitations (like the OS does not know natively that there are two or three monitors connected and treats it like one). The price is about $350 for the Tripplehead and around $220 for the Dualhead one.\nHere is the GXM homepage.\n\nA: If you don't yet have the monitors, the cheapest solution is to get a USB monitor (for example, Display Link). Performance is fine for your uses. Display Link sells a monitor with HD (1920x1080) resolution.\nIf you have both monitors already, and they are VGA or DVI, then you can buy adapters for them. Performance should improve somewhat.\n\nA: If you have an iPhone or iPad, they can become a second monitor with Air Display.\n\nA: I highly recommend Plugable's USB 2.0 to VGA/DVI/HDMI Adapter. It will do up to 2048×1152 or 1920×1200. I use it at work every day, along with a second monitor plugged right into the display port. It uses DisplayLink's chip and drivers, and works well on Snow Leopard and Lion.\nIt's a bit slower to update than the MacBook's internal monitor or the monitor plugged directly into the display port, but as long as I'm not trying to watch video on it it's great.\n\nA: I've heard good things about the OWC USB to DVI/HDMI/VGA Display Adapter.\nPlug it in with USB, and it drives a monitor connected with DVI, HDMI, or VGA up to 1600x1200 pixels (full HD is 1920x1080).\n\nA: You can now do this with the Thunderbolt equipped MacBook Pros that also have discrete graphic cards. Both displays need to be the new Thunderbolt displays.\nI use a DisplayLink USB adapter on my MacBook Pro 13, which works well for everything except fullscreen video and 3D.\n", "Q: How can I tell if my MacBook's iSight has a hardware problem? I've got a 2006 13\" MacBook (Core Duo; the first ones they produced with an Intel chipset), and the built-in webcam doesn't seem to work anymore.\nHere's what my System Profiler shows in the USB tab: \nWhich makes me believe there's a hardware problem, or a more fundamental problem with my OS (Snow Leopard 10.6.6).  Before I try reinstalling the OS, are there any ways I can test the functionality of the hardware? I'm willing to open up the computer if needed.\nNote: I've already tried resetting the PMU, along with the other steps on Apple's \"How to Troubleshoot iSight\" page.\n\nA: If System Profilier isn't showing it up under USB then the iSight has been physically damaged beyond repair (not accepting power) or has been somehow disconnected from the Bus. System Profiler always displays connected devices, even if they're corrupted or non-functioning.\nTake your Mac to the Apple Store and they will tell you what it will take to fix it. The most likely scenario is that it will be a free repair, and they'll clean up your computer while they're at it :)\nIf you can't get to an Apple Store call 1-800-MY-APPLE and ask them about your options.\n", "Q: Which Mac to develop iPhone apps? I'm a developer working with Windows. I have some cutomers who are interested in iPhone Apps, so I'm looking for a Mac right now. The problem is, that I have no clue at all about what to buy.\nI don't want to use the Mac as my primary machine, I just want do to the coding on it. So it doesn't need to be that powerful I guess. So what would you recommend? New or used ...\nDoes the Mac work with my USB Keyboard/Mouse? Does it work with my monitor with DVI port? Do I need adapters or completely new Hardware?\nI read somewhere that I need an Intel CPU. Is this true?\n\nA: Any current mac would work just fine. Just pick the form factor you like best at the price you are willing to pay.\nI use a mac mini for iphone development and it works fine with all my standard peripherals (monitor, keyboard & mouse). I had to get an adapter for the monitor.\n\nA: I completely disagree with all Mac Mini suggestions.\nGet a macbook. Used or new, depends on what you prefer. Or better yet - get the Air which is same price than the macbook.\nToday a new mini is U$300 cheaper than both the notebooks (which goes for U$999) but you don't have to deal with keyboards, mouses and above all lack of battery. Any computer without a nobreak is a break dealer for developing, from my point of view. Adding all that plus the space used, power consumption and convenience we can easily sum up to macbook being a lot more worth it. Plus, with the air, the SSD makes it worth even a lot more.\nThe mini is good as a home server or any kind of dedicated machine. Never as a desktop nor to have frequent user input - even if it can be set up for such just like any messy PC.\nAnyway, I'm a long time PC user, I never dropped windows or PC, but if you're going to develop to mac, please, go all in. Learn to enjoy the apple way, to hate it as well, and make that software really a Mac OS one, not a ported piece that doesn't fit in. There are many, many nuances to a true software made for mac that can make the difference for your software being successful on the apple market.\nYou can even use bootcamp to install windows on it if you wish, but like everyone else said, as a developer you are going to fall in love for the mac OS and the amazing hardware (which won't happen if you go Mini).\n\nA: Honestly any Mac on the market right now (that is currently being sold by Apple) will do you just fine. Choose based on price, honestly. I would not, however, recommend a Macbook Air if you're not going to be using it like a regular computer. Your best option would probably be a Mac Mini, which has an Intel CPU and plenty of speed and compatibility for what you're trying to do. They are a lot cheaper than alternative Macs, and you can use them with your preexisting monitor/mouse/keyboard setup. This is really nice if you buy one of those little switcher things that allows you to use a single monitor/mouse/keyboard setup with two or more computers. The Mac Mini will work with a DVI port, and if the model you purchase doesn't support DVI on the box, Apple sells a $20 adapter that'll get you what you need cheaply.\nIn summary, Mac Mini is the way to go, imho. The next best option is an iMac, which you might like better (it has a more \"Mac\" experience which I guarantee you'll fall in love with).\n\nA: Agree with the Mac Mini suggestions but just to let you know, if you want a laptop, there'll be no problems either. I have successfully developed 4 apps on a 2009 white Macbook with no issues (I did max out the memory to 4Gig and replace the 120Gb hard drive with a 500Gb one though.)\n\nA: The current low level Mac Mini with an upgrade to 4GB memory is probably the best bang for your buck. That's what I have except with 8GB; got my memory from Amazon for $130, cheaper than Apple memory. It's a very capable machine. If you use a lot of programs simultaneously, the standard 2GB is kinda cramped, but 4GB would do fine; it just seemed like a good deal for 8GB and I use more than your average number of apps simultaneously and lots of Safari tabs.\nThe new MacMini is much nicer than the 2009's. I know this because I had one before this one; with 2GB of course :).\nYou're gonna love OS X by the way. Don't be surprised if you ditch Windows in a year.\nAbout your specific questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Any current Mac has an Intel CPU. Apple switched from PowerPC back in 2006 and yes you need one, but you don't want a computer that old anyway!\n\n*Just about any keyboard or mouse will work fine with OS X. If you are using some kind of fancy mouse or keyboard, then you'll probably will need some third party software to get all those custom parts working, but all the standard parts will work; left click, right click, scroll wheel, cursor control etc. There is a chance however that there is no OS X equivalent of the third party software you may be using.\n\n*Finally, Macs work with standard monitors and even regular modern TV's with DVI, VGA, HDMI inputs (virtually all of them do). The most you'll ever need is a common adapter found at Best Buy, Apple Store etc.\n\nA: I would go wit the Mac Mini first and hook up my keyboard and monitor to that and would use Remote Desktop to connect to my Windows PC.\n\nA: I think for practical reasons you want to use a Mac that has a display large enough to display the entire iPhone4 (or iPad) simulator. It is annoying when you have to move the simulator window up and down on the display to see what's there.\nYou also need a USB port to sync between a real iPhone or iPad and the development machine.\nAny of the machines that Apple sells will run the developer tools (Xcode) admirably, but do a little homework to see how many pixels you need to display the simulator (and the other tools) comfortably. Most of the developers I know use multiple displays, and so tend to use machines that allow you to hook up a second or even a third display. I am using a 4 year-old MacBook Pro 17\".\n\nA: I just started iOS development and bought a Mac Mini, it's actually pretty powerful for such a small machine.  I did upgrade to 4 gigs of ram though.\n", "Q: Oil seeping from mbp keys? I have a pretty recent macbook pro 15in, aluminum unibody, probably not yet one year old.\nIt mainly gets used in clamshell mode connected to an external monitor.  I've noticed frequently now when I take it out for use as a proper laptop, the left side Option and Command keys have an oily substance seeping out of them, with a corresponding spot on the screen where it touches those keys when closed.\nAny ideas on what's causing this?  \n\nA: Sounds like oil from your hands to be honest\n\nA: As far as I know, the only places on a MacBook Pro that have any liquid in them are the LCD and the battery. In either case, it's not pleasant stuff, and definitely shouldn't be leaving it's respective container.\nIf it's only a year old, take it to the Apple store for service. But first, wash your hands.\n", "Q: My iPhone no longer mounts in Windows. Tries to install \"MTP USB Device\" .. which fails When I plug my iPhone 4 into my Windows 7 Ultimate laptop, it syncs just fine with iTunes, but it no longer mounts on the desktop for me to transfer pictures and videos.\nWhen I plug it in, Windows attempts to install a driver named \"MTP USB Device\" and then fails.\nI've tried a number of things, the most drastic being:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall iTunes\n\n*Uninstall MTP USB Device from Device Manager\n\n*Restart\n\n*Install the latest iTunes\n\n*Restart\n\n*Run iTunes\n\n*Plug in the Phone\n\n\nWhen I did that, Windows claimed it was installing a driver named \"iPhone\" (yippee!) but then it switched to \"MTP USB Device\" and failed again.\nI've searched other forums and found strange and bizarre ideas that include exploding the iTunes MSI so I can get the Apple USB Device driver -- but that driver is installed and works just fine.\n\nA: In the mist of giving you an extra idea, and to be frank I have no idea what your problem might be, let me share what I'd do to find the cause and -eventually- fix it.\nYou seem to have done your Windows homework well, yet results haven't been what you expected. Something I remember doing with Windows when things didn't work (in the Windows95 era this was very common!) was rebooting in Safe Mode and see if anything looked unfamiliar. \nIn any case, if you still can't manage to make Windows work, before anything else, it would be interesting to make sure that the problem is not in the iPhone itself (probably nothing that an iPhone restore wouldn't fix if that's the case).\nFirst rule of diagnosing a problem: try it on another system. The result of this simple test is going to rule out 50% of the possibilities. \nIf it works, the problem is in your Windows machine and you might get better luck at Super User (since our userbase here has less Windows experience, tho we have a few geeks around). \nIf it doesn't work, then the problem is not your Windows (stop removing stuff or it will go coo-coo!). \nIn that case, you might want to perform a full Restore of your iPhone. I am not familiar with Windows+iPhone combo, but don't you have to Check some preference in iTunes for that \"mounts on the desktop for me to transfer pictures and videos\" thing to happen? I think it was called \"Enable Disk's use\" on iPods, but I haven't seen that option in iPhones, but then again, Maybe on Windows this is common. Forgive my ignorance in the subject.\nAnyway, just make sure your iPhone mounts on another computer's desktop (with Windows) before destroying your own Windows. For what is worth, I'm not aware of any iPhone mounting on a Mac's desktop, this has got to be a Windows thing, and this is why Super User may be better suited.\n\nA: Folks, \nI had this problem with my PC (windows 7, 64-bit) and my iPad. After messing with it for a long time, I finally found the answer (bad USB driver). The following two step process should help resolve these kinds of problems more quickly. \nThe first step is to verify that the iPad (or iPhone) is really connected to your computer. This can be (really) checked using a program called USBDeview. You can get this (very small) program from download.cnet.com/USBDeview/3000-2094_4-10614190.html or www.nirsoft.net/utils/usb_devices_view.html. Don't worry, it's not Spyware or Malware. \nJust run the program and sort on the 'Connected' column. If your iPad or iPhone doesn't show up as Yes (under 'Connected') then your iDevice is not properly connected to your computer. Could be a cable problem. Could be an iDevice problem. Could be a USB hub problem. Note that your iDevice might be listed as what it is (iPad or iPhone) or it might be listed as 'Apple Mobile Device USB Driver' in the 'Description' column. \nApple has a number of ideas to resolve this sort of basic connectivity issue, including switching USB ports, resetting your iDevice, rebooting your iDevice, rebooting your computer, etc. You will need to try them until your iDevice shows up in USBDeview as 'Yes' under Connected. \nIf you iDevice shows up as 'Yes' under connected, it should also be visible in the Device Manager (found in the Windows 7 Control Panel under Hardware and Sound). You might find it under Portable Devices or it might be under Universal Serial Bus controllers.\nThe iDevice may or may not show up in the Windows Explorer. On some machines it does, on others it does not. Why is not clear. \nIf the Idevice is properly known to Windows and iTunes can't see it, then any number of other things could be wrong. Apple has a list. See the very useful page over at http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1538. Testing shows that the Apple Mobile Device service must be running. Check this using Task Manager (started by right clicking the taskbar). Note that the iPod service and the iphlpsvc service must also be running. These services have different names under the Processes table versus the Services tab of Task Manager. \nAppleMobileDeviceService.exe - Apple Mobile Device\niPodService.exe                      - iPod Service\nItunesHelper.exe                     - iphlpsvc \nStep 4 of http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1538 checks if the Apple Mobile Device USB is installed. This is essential and a common source of problems. In at least some cases, Windows will install the 'MTP USB' driver. Indeed, Windows will reinstall this driver if you uninstall it. The MTP USB driver is essentially a Windows bug (possibly caused by Microsoft). You MUST replace the MTP USB driver with the Apple Mobile Device USB Driver. Step 4 explains how to do this. Note that you MUST use the 'Have Disk' approach. Otherwise, Windows will just reinstall the invalid MTP driver. \nThe Apple doc indicates that you can find the correct driver at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\Apple\\Mobile Device Support\\Drivers. Perhaps this is correct on some systems. You may find the correct driver in C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Apple\\Mobile Device Support\\Drivers. \niTunes could make this a lot easier by checking if the iDevice is known to Windows (what USBDevier does) and if the Apple Mobile Device USB driver is properly installed for the iDevice. Sadly it doesn't perform either check. Note that iTunes does if some of the related services (see above) are actually running.\n\nA: I had the same problem and this sorted it out permanently\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the windows button (start) – in the box where it says search programs and files type “run”\n\n*Under programs at the top of your start menu, it should now show Run, click on this.\n\n*In the dialog box of the run program type “regedit” and click ok,when windows prompts do you want to allow the program to make changes click on YES\n\n*The registory editor window will now open, before doing any more backup the current registry to a location you chose by clicking on file>export- name the file and click save\n\n*In the left hand split of the registory edit window browse for the following file location\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE / SYSTEM / CurrentControlSet / Control / Class\n\n*On the left side, search for the entry {EEC5AD98-8080-425F-922A-DABF3DE3F69A} and click on it (it will be close to the bottom of the file list in the class folder)\n\n*On the right side, you will find a key which begins with “Upper…” – delete it!\n\n*Now unplug your iPhone\n\n*Restart your computer\n\n*Plug in your iPhone and hopefully find it mounted as a drive again!\n\n*Double click my computer, double click iphone, double click internal storage and double click DCIM, you can now select your pictures and copy/paste or drag to the desired location.\n\n\nA: I had pretty much the same issue, and nothing worked for me. But when I disabled the MTP USB in Device Manager, I was able to connect my iPhone to my PC again.\n\nA: Two things:\nFirst, Microsoft's Answers recommends not just uninstalling your iPhone drivers, but all USB drivers.\nI have heard rumors of laptop webcam drivers interfering with the iPhone's camera drivers before, and there is mention of it on iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch: Device not recognized in iTunes for Windows, though this specific problem is a less serious incarnation of the entire device not showing up.\nSecondly, have you tried an alternate USB port? \nLastly, if you're going to restore your device, make sure to follow This article.\n", "Q: iPhone 2G has \"NO SERVICE\" after restore from possibly corrupt backup I'm having a hell of an issue with my iPhone 2G.\nA couple of days ago, I noticed my phone was behaving strangely and appeared to be 'half-synched'. I tried restarting it then did a restore to my last backup using iTunes. To my dismay, I stopped getting any cell service after this; just no bars or \"NO CARRIER\" instead of data or voice service (everything else worked fine).  I called AT&T to report the issue and they were essentially no help and determined it to be a hardware failure. I tried resetting the network data, resetting to factory settings, doing a restore to a different backup but to no avail. The only thing that worked was when I switched the sim card to another spare iPhone I had. \nOK, so now I had my old iPhone working with the sim card so I assumed it was a crazy hardware failure. I tried to restore to the more recent backup (the same one that 'broke' the first phone) and alas, my spare phone also has this problem now! I have tried restoring from an older backup but I still can't get any service; the damage appears to be permanent!\nBy the way, all my bills are paid, I am in an area with good cell reception, etc. \nIt sounds like this post covers the same or a similar issue.\nHas anyone had a similar problem? Is there some way I can do an even lower-level reset than the iTunes restore? Any help would be greatly appreciated! I'm hoping to document the problem well here so that anyone else with a similar problem can hopefully find a solution.\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone OS 3.1.3 - no jailbreaks or any other hacks \n\n*Mac OSX 10.6.6 \n\n*iTunes 10.1.1\n\n*Firmware 04.05.04_G\n\n\nA: Given that you have already tried to set the phone in Recovery Mode and DFU to no avail, there isn't much else you can do on a device with only two buttons and a USB port :)\nAs already suggested, your best bet is to take it to an Apple Store for inspection. Your phone is not Jailbroken or hacked in any way, so AT&T should either replace it or have it fixed. \nMy best bet is that during the restore, the baseband got corrupted and now the phone cannot be properly recognized by iTunes. \nThe Before Disclaimer: I'm sure that since you're a loyal AT&T customer you may want to have them fix your phone, but that'd be in a perfect world. \nDisclaimer #1: The following procedure may be \"illegal\" or \"not approved\" in certain areas, countries, etc. and it may be against your Terms of Services, morale, etc.\nDisclaimer #2: Although I recently did these exact steps in my old iPhone 2G, I live in Europe and you know how we Europeans like to drink tea and laugh at certain things of the American culture and behavior, therefore I do not suggest you do this if you are unsure. \nDisclaimer #3: I've seen phones get bricked (A.k.a rendered useless) after using these steps. I can confirm that I did this myself two weeks ago, downloading the exact same files that I've liked here and it worked like a \"charm\", but \"your mileage may vary\". \nAs with any other \"gray\" procedure, use at your own Risk.\nEnough chit-chat…\nIf -after contacting Apple- you find yourself in a \"you don't have warranty we're sorry, you need to pay for a new phone\" situation, then you can try to save the phone by using a Jailbreak method. \nMy old iPhone 2G crashed two weeks ago and I had to do exactly this. These are the steps I performed: \nFor an iPhone 2G, your \"best\" and only option is to use the old pwnagetool 3.1.5 (latest for that model), which you can download from the \"official\" Website (Torrent file). It's an app called Pwnagetool. Do not download from other sources, you never know.\nYou will also need an old baseband, more specifically 3.9, which you can download from here. It's a file called bl39.bin. Do not unzip the .BIN, just leave it like that. \nSave all that in a Folder somewhere. \nYou will also need the official latest iOS for your 2G phone. Which is -as you already know- iOS 3.1.3\nYou already have that file in your drive if you have been using it before. It should be located in: \n~/Library/iTunes/iPhone Software Updates/\n\nThe file name should be something like: \niPhone1,1_3.1.3_7E18_Restore.ipsw\n\nCopy that file to the folder where you downloaded the above files.\nNow that you have all in place, you're ready to destroy your iPhone forever… so go ahead and launch the Pwnagetool.\nIgnore the \"you don't have iTunes 8.0\" error (because you probably have the super latest 10.x iTunes):\n\nIt works nevertheless, so click ok. \nAt this point, if you have LittleSnitch it will warn you that the App is trying to connect to a place. It's the autoupdater (which doesn't update anyway), you can go ahead and Deny connections, no harm done.\nAnd now you're ready to start. Disconnect you phone, you don't need it yet.\nThe application provides two methods, as you can see in the toolbar: Simple mode, and Expert mode. \nI suggest you try Simple first and then, if it works, you can redo the whole thing with expert and tweak it.\nPlease note that if it works, by default, the Simple mode (and you have to use Expert to change it) will replace the \"Apple\" logo by a PineApple, like the one seen in this screenshot:\n\nI won't go into the full detail of the process because it's rather simple, but I will tell you what this tool does and what it doesn't.\nPwnagetool will take the official \"ipsw\" and modify it to \"jailbreak\" it. This also allows you to perform a carrier unlock (which -in turn- may fix your carrier problem, which is the idea of all this). It will basically take the official file, modify it, and create a new one with a similar name and the suffix: CustomRestore:\niPhone1,1_3.1.3_7E18_Custom_Restore.ipsw\n\nAfter you have this, then you have to proceed to \"restore your iPhone\" the \"normal way\". The app explains what to do, but the important step is that when you go to iTunes to click the \"restore\", you press the  ⌥ opt  and then click the button. This allows you to browse for the ipsw file, instead of iTunes picking the default one. \nAs you have correctly guessed, you have to find the one named Custom_Restore, which will proceed to jailbreak/unlock your phone, maybe fixing it. \nIt will take a while, the phone will restart, the phone will restart and the phone will restart. Kinda like that. At some point an app (BootNeuter) will appear and will ask you a few questions. Then it will restart again and I think again. \nAt some point (if you're patient) iTunes should recognize your phone and ask you if you want to \"restore\" a backup. \nThat's your decision at this point, because you mentioned that the backup is what caused the trouble. I'd try a fresh restore and then proceed to manually re-sync. \nIf, after all this, you phone works, congratulations. If you want to try the expert mode, go ahead, you can always save the ipsw you used in the first place and re-use it to restore the phone at any time. Go ahead, try expert and see the different options (like not replacing the pineapple and restore images, not installing Cydia, etc.).\nIn any case, you can -after all this- try to restore your phone using the original ipsw from Apple (which you used as a base anyway). That should be AT&T happy. \nSorry for the long post and I wish you good luck with it. I have an iPhone 3GS and a 2G and I love the 2G form factor way way more than any other iPhone.\nFINAL COMMENT\nAs I've repeatedly said in the post, this procedure can permanently damage your phone. I don't know how, because I did it in a dozen of iPhones 2G here when the iPhone was originally launched and no phone ever failed on me, but if you google around, there are stories. \nThe only reason why I posted all this method is because your phone is old and if AT&T or Apple refuses to fix it, you can (and should) try to save it. My iPhone 2G has better battery life than my 3GS (albeit at a speed cost) and works fantastically. It was a gift from a friend who lives in the USA that came to Europe two months after the iPhone 2G launch and brought it in the original box for me.\n\n", "Q: Reason for perpetual dynamic DNS updates? (Crossposted from Serverfault)\nI'm using dynamic DNS (the \"adult\" version from RFC 2136, not à la DynDNS), and for a while now I've been seeing my laptops with MacOS 10.6.x churning out updates about every 10 seconds. And seemingly redundant updates at that, as the IP is more or less stable (consumer broadband). I don't remember seeing that frequency in the (distant...) past.\nThe lowest time-to-live that MacOS pushes on the entries is 2 minutes, so I have no clue what's going on.\n...\nJan 12 13:17:18 lambda named[18683]: info: client 84.208.X.X#48715: updating zone 'dynamic.foldr.org/IN': deleting rrset at 'rCosinus._afpovertcp._tcp.dynamic.foldr.org' SRV\nJan 12 13:17:18 lambda named[18683]: info: client 84.208.X.X#48715: updating zone 'dynamic.foldr.org/IN': adding an RR at 'rCosinus._afpovertcp._tcp.dynamic.foldr.org' SRV\nJan 12 13:17:26 lambda named[18683]: info: client 84.208.X.X#48715: updating zone 'dynamic.foldr.org/IN': deleting rrset at 'rcosinus.dynamic.foldr.org' AAAA\n...\n\nAdditionally, I can't find out what triggers the updates on the laptop-side. Is this a known problem, and how would I go about debugging it? One of the machines is freshly purchased and installed. The only \"major\" change was installation of the Miredo client for IPv6/Teredo, but even disabling it didn't make a change (except that AAAA records are no longer published).\n\nA: Hm, must have been something transient: I noticed that the SOA didn't change, and after a zone freeze/thaw, the problem suddenly disappeared. Looks like BIND might have had a hick-up.\n", "Q: How does Apple AppStore rank search results? I have an iOS application - an alarm clock. I released it a little over a month ago. Initially it was paid, but when I saw there were virtually no purchases (from 0 to 4 a day), I changed it to be free for a period of time. When it become free, in less than 10 days it has been downloaded more than 30,000 times, and more importantly (I think) it moved much higher in the search results when the user searches \"alarm\" - it reached 20th place in the results. During that time I also received very good reviews in the AppStore. But today I changed it back to paid, and now when I search \"alarm\" my app is shown at the bottom of the 4TH PAGE. Given that one page contains 120 apps, this is very bad for me and I don't understand why this happened. Can anyone tell me how does AppStore ranks search results and is there a way to move my app higher in the rankings, please? :) Huge thanks!\n\nA: I'd venture to guess and say that the App Store ranking algorithm is a company secret, much like Google's web search rankings. It seems to me that the radical changes in placement you are witnessing are as much the fickleness of App Store customers as anything else. \nCorrelation isn't causation by any means, but it seems fairly clear by your description of the events that if you want a lot of downloads you will either have to make it free (and perhaps ad-supported?), or your alarm clock app needs to do something so unique amongst the plethora of alarm clock apps that customers will feel compelled to pay for it.\n\nA: The rankings are complicated and take many things into account. It's not publicly disclosed and the rankings are being tweaked over time as Apple learns what customers want (filtering shill reviews from demo codes, weighting reviewers and stars, aging older data out faster, recent sales data seems to be very important.) Also, there has been a see saw of whether a recently updated app, an app with an alternate availability date and the original date of release is sorted to the top. I would expect that to settle down to a mix of all three for a blended ranking.\nIn a nutshell - focus on making your app the best it can be - rest assured Apple will want to promote heavily the apps that make the most people happy. Don't try to SEO the store but instead make a small core audience very happy and expand from there. Make them so happy they legitimately want to leave stars and reviews. Initially apps got a bump asking for reviews and stars, but it seems lateely to have a negative back lash effect. How do you feel when you are interrupted at exactly the moment you chose to use an app and it hits you with an ask for promotion. Many reviews now express that rather than what is good about the app.\nYou will hopefully get your moment in the sun and then it will pass. Only the hard work of long term word of mouth will help make an app a long term success.\nDo ask for user feedback in the info or settings menu or in an opt-in mailing list from time to time - somewhere your die hard curious users will find and way out of the way of the normal function of your app.\nI would follow the blogs of some of the best developers and they write often about when they notice changes and trends in the rankings. There have been purges of junk apps, purges of ones that obviously game the keywords, ones that had shill reviews (nonsense 5 stars for obviously crappy apps).\nHere are several blogs worth watching for words of wisdom and astute app store policy commentary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Craig Hockenberry\n\n*Marco Arment\n\n*Neven Mrgan\n\n*The Omni Group\n\n*James Thompson\n", "Q: What are some alternatives to Quicksilver? I'm an avid fan of QuickSilver, and I had been using it for several years already. But then development of the application seemed to have stagnated for a while, and many bugs (specially with plugins and advanced features) were never fixed. I then moved to QSB, which seemed to be where the efforts were being concentrated in order to produce such an application. But then again, development seems to have stopped and several features I still miss (like AppleScript launching) were never properly implemented.\nI'm aware of a few alternatives out there, notably AlfredApp and LaunchBar, but I wanted to ask here for your opinion and recommendations before trying them out.\nSo my question is, as of today, which would be the best replacement for QuickSilver? Ideally I would like support for the following features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launching applications, preference panels and apple scripts.\n\n*Web search, and search within bookmarks of my favorite browser. \n\n*Able to perform actions or operations on files (copy, move, reveal in Finder).\n\n*Custom web searches are a plus. I would love if it could index, e.g., my delicious bookmarks.\n\n*Free. Open-sourced is a plus.\n\n*Some plugin infrastructure.\n\n*A healthy community of developers actively maintaining the application.\n\n*Not too many bugs.\n\n\nIn your answer, please do let me know about the features of your suggested application, and note if there are any missing features from my desired “ wish list”.\n\nA: Despite a period where it looked like the program would languish, Quicksilver is very much alive and being developed in 2013. \nI'd propose an alternative to the Quicksilver from 2011 to be Quicksilver now at http://qsapp.com\nThe open source development is quite active and most of the big problems have been fixed. In fact, it works so well that the developers have finally released the 1.0 version. You can even participate in the development as the code base is hosted on GitHub - Quicksilver.\n\nA: Alfred is the one that meets pretty much all your needs.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launching applications, preference panels and apple scripts.\n\n*Web search, and search within bookmarks of my favorite browser.\n\n*Able to perform actions or operations on files (copy, move, reveal in Finder). paid version only\n\n*Custom web searches.\n\n*Free.\n\n*Plugin infrastructure.\n\n*A healthy community of developers actively maintaining the application.\n\n*Not too many bugs\n\n\nA: In my experience, LaunchBar (which I'm using now) has been the best replacement for QuickSilver. Right after the switch (I used QS too), I missed a few things here and there and had to adjust to others. Truth is, Launchbar ends up being a perfect replacement for most tasks. Perhaps not as \"open\" as quicksilver but very mature and stable.\nAlfred (which is newer) is ok and it delivers (been using it for a couple of weeks). It lacks certain things (I didn't have the powerpack). Clearly the power pack brings it to the level of LB. \nPros of LB? It's stable, been working for years and it delivers. Relatively easy to configure and expand (e.g.: to add a search and/or modify the catalog). \nCons of LB? Development is not what you'd call a fast thing. Other than the ocasional bug-fix, the program hasn't really been updated in a few months. No new features in more than a year. Not that it really \"needs\" more, but… new ideas would be welcomed too.\nIt's also not free.\nPros of Alfred? It's free for basic stuff, works ok and has a nice community. You can change more things and it's more prone to be configurable in the future. \nSome actions are better implemented than LB. Can't recall now an example but I remember smiling at certain details. \nCons of Alfred? If the features you want are not in the free package, you will have to pay. Has less features than LB at the moment and is somewhat slower in certain things. \nSome things you cannot do and I believe LB has better \"file\" management. But it's probably because I'm used to it. \nOf course, if you want Free… you don't have much choice. \n\nA: I'm also a fan of Quicksilver, and having tried LB and Alfred, I'd say that Alfred feels more \"quicksilver-ish\" so it was easier for me to understand.\nFor whatever it's worth, Quicksilver has been open-sourced, and some work is still being done on it, although it's not as active as it once was. It runs fine under Lion.\n", "Q: External sound card I need a good external sound card mainly to record guitars and vocals. What options available? What would you recommend?\n\nA: This is a very \"detailed\" subject, because different people will list different opinions at what good is. \nI have plenty of experience with M-Audio Fast Track Pro and Rig Kontrol.\nFastTrack Pro\nIt works as advertised but, it has some details that I don't like. You have to unplug it (or power it off) every now and then (especially if you slept your computer with the device connected). It has some good things, like Phantom power and stuff like that which will allow you to record more things. It has decent latency and sound quality is ok. If you want to record at high quality, you cannot use more than one input and one output and stuff like that. But for 44/48Khz is ok.\nThe driver is ok at informing you what's going on, but don't expect pages of information or features.\nIt really has two inputs that you can use at the same time and quite a few outputs but depending upon the Khz you use, certain options won't be available. Check the specs in their site. \nThe driver update from Tiger to Leopard and from Leopard to SnowLeopard hasn't been the fastest. It took them a few months (although the old driver worked more or less). There was a beta and it kinda worked but there were some bugs. Their support has been good tho and they eventually fixed it. \nI don't really move it, but its durability has been excellent so far. It's not a \"Pro\" product anyway; ok for small home studios and garage bands, but you'll probably not see one of these in a pro studio. \nIt has a power input, but I couldn't find who sells the power brick, it's nowhere in M-Audio's page so… you'll have to drive it from the USB port. \nI mainly record guitars+voices+basses. Some things are recorded with Condenser Mics (thanks to the Phantom power!).\nThe controls in the unit are ok, tho the Clipping detection could be more precise. \nRIG KONTROLLER\nThis is for guitars and it does what it says. It has cons tho', the \"footpads\" are too \"hard\" and make a noise when you press them, making them look cheap (and they are) and also rendering useless if theres a mic \"too close\" because you are at risk that the sound of the \"click\" might be heard. \nI brought that with Guitar Rig 3 (later upgraded to 4, recommended). For a guitar/bass is very nice. But it's a very simple unit in terms of features, compared to the Fasttrack.\nYou don't mention how many types of inputs/outputs you want or desire, but you can probably also evaluate things like Motu. \nThis is a good guide which I recommend you read (outdated as it is, it still explains certain good points).\n\nA: Apogee Duet or Apogee One\nI've been an Apogee user for a while now.\nThey are excellent sounding, firewire-based interfaces that have rock solid drivers. I can't recall the last time I had to fight with drivers or worry about crashes while I was working. Unprecedented stability IMO really.\nThe converters on the low-end Apogee gear are pristine sounding. Every bit as good as the Rosetta-level stuff.\nThey have XLR inputs that can take a mic or line level signal. And switchable 1/4\" inputs that can be set to high impedance inputs so you can plug your guitar directly in to the unit.\nAnd the design is modern and integrates nicely in to an Apple environment. Good ergonomics without a lot of clutter.\nMy only gripes with the Duet, and these are minor are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The breakout cable ruins some of the elegance. It can be a mess.\n\n*The to-speaker outputs are unbalanced and I get some hum on them. I've been meaning to pick up a third party breakout box that has balanced, isolated speaker outs.\n\n*There's no MIDI in/out on it. That's very, very minor, but it would have been nice to do all my interfacing with one box. I carry an Uno for MIDI interfacing.\n\n\nApogee GiO\nIf you have no need for the microphone inputs of the above products and don't mind a larger, floor based form factor, the GiO is a pretty cool option. Same great converters, but add in DAW controls that you can operate with your feet so you can punch in/out and track without taking your hands off your guitar.\nThere's no mic preamp on it though, so instrument level signals only.\n", "Q: How to synchronize iPhone with new Mac without losing data? I've upgraded my workplace with a new Macbook, but I've run into several problems. One of these problems is iPhone synchronization. \nPreviously, I synchronized my iPhone with a PC notebook. Now I want to sync it with my new Mac, but I don't want to lose all my app data or re-upload all the music, videos, etc.\nIs there any possibility for me to sync with my Mac and not reinstall apps and re-upload music? I know I can use an iPhone file manager (my iPhone is jailbroken) to search all the saves and then reinstall all the apps and then transfer the saves back to phone, but it'll take too much time. Is there a more elegant way to do it?\n\nA: You can move your iTunes library from your PC to your Mac.  As long as the persistent id is the same it won't erase the iPhone.\nYou could also just edit the Mac iTunes library to have the same persistent id your PC library did.\nhttp://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=2137\n\nA: Recently dealt with this problem with my parents upgrading from an iPad 2 to an iPad 3.\nThe iPad 2 was synced to one laptop, the iPad 3 was destined for another.  We synced the iPad 3 to a backup of the iPad 2 and then went to plug it into the new laptop.  (NOTE: the new laptop had all files from the old library synced via home share first.)  iTunes asked whether to leave it alone or erase the iPad and sync.  After playing around and much googling we went ahead and tried hitting erase and sync.  When you do this, if the two iTunes libraries have the same iTunes account, it will actually make a full backup of the iOS device BEFORE it \"erases and syncs.\"\nOnce it was done, all files were there, even each app's files and settings.  (Such as PDFs saved in good reader).\nThis may not have been the case back in 2008 when http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=2137 was posted.  But it seems Apple has caught on, and they just need to reword the message box so they don't scare users into thinking they'll lose everything.\n", "Q: Purchasing an iMac but pay every month I'm not sure about this, but I just want to know if it's possible to purchase a product from the Apple website, but not to pay in full, but pay every month since I cannot fully pay the whole price of a 27\" iMac but I can if I pay every month.\nCheers.\n\nEDIT:\nOk, I had a chat with an Apple Expert on the live chat (via the website) in order to pay monthly, you will have to place an order WITH a financial payment which is label in the payment method (second tab on the panel).\nAfter that, confirm your order and you will be redirected to an Apple \"Apply Now\" which you will place an confirmation for Apple to approve or disapprove, if you are approved you will be sent an application - if you dislike the Terms and Conditions, your order will be canceled.\n\nCheers guys, hope this will help everyone.\n\nA: Apple offers financing for a lot of their products. Typically you will see a link above the \"Select\" button for a given product on its page. See the image below from the Mac Mini catalog page...\n\nThe financing may not come from Apple directly, but it is an option.\n\nA: It appears that you are in the UK, this financing option is available from Apple, if it is a business purchase you can also lease Apple hardware.\nHowever, depending on how long you want to spread the payments over you can look for an interest free offer on a credit card, usually up to 12 months so you can make a big purchase then have 12 months to pay it off, as long as you make the minimum payment each month you don't pay anything extra.\n\nA: Maybe it is reasonable to look through refurbished products https://tech.trade/ . Their price is not so high, that's why it can become good alternative \n\nA: As far as I know, Apple don't offer any hire purchase or leasing arrangements through the Apple store or website. You will need to find a third party to lend you the money.\n", "Q: snow leopard(10.6.5)freezes on startup with bootcamp and windows7 Help! I've installed boot camp and Windows 7 on my black Macbook Santa Rosa (2.4Ghz, 4GB RAM) and have a serious problem where I can no longer boot into OSX.\nOSX freezes with the apple logo and timer, but also has an extra progress bar that I have not seen before.\nHas anyone else encountered or heard of this problem?\nThis is the second time that this exact thing has happened (the last time I just reinstalled everything, as I wanted to increase the size of the windows partition anyway), but really don't have the time to go through all of that again.\nThe first time that this happened, I ran disk utility from the Snow Leopard disk, and attempted to verify permissions and disk but to no avail.\nAny help would be most appreciated...\n\nA: Can you start it in Safe Mode?  \nMethod is explained here:  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1455\n\nA: did you fix the problem in the end?

I use ⌘+⌥+\\ to call up LaunchBar's clipboard history. And it works great everywhere except in TextMate, which has this combination bound to some Bundle action.\nI'd like to unbind this combination in TextMate so I can get to LaunchBar's clipboard history view when I'm in TextMate and pull things off the stack.\nI checked under the Bundles menu for an option that would show me all Bundle commands bound to a particular key combination but couldn't find anything. Short of searching through every single command, or looking at the Bundles -> Select Bundle Item... list, is there any way to figure this out?\n\nA: I figured it out!\nThe key was using the Bundles -> Select Bundle Item... (^+⌘+T) dialog box. When the box options, in the search field at the top of the dialog box, click the down arrow on the magnifying glass and change the search type from \"Item title\" to \"Key equivalent\".\nNow you can press the ⌘+⌥+\\ key combination and the list will filter to show you the commands bound to that combination:\n\n", "Q: Raise/lower/move/resize windows with mouse + modifier keys I'm a longtime FVWM user over on the Linux side and have developed some keyboard + mouse shortcuts that I find very helpful in managing windows. Specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*left click + command + shift = send to back if frontmost, otherwise raise to front\n\n*right click + command + shift = maximize window vertically (horizontal size unchanged)\n\n*left+right chord + command + shift = grab window and move it\n\n*left+right chord + command + control + shift = resize (drag pointer to side or corner and move that to resize)\n\n\nFor all of these, \"click\" means click anywhere in the window.\nIs there Mac software that will let me set this up? I'm on 10.6.\nEdit\nTo clarify, the move/resize operations should begin on mouse-down and end on mouse-up.\n\nA: Easy Move+Resize is a great little tool that does exactly what it says on the tin.\n\nUsage\nEasy Move+Resize is based on behavior found in many X11/Linux window managers  \n– Cmd + Ctrl + Left Mouse anywhere inside a window, then drag to move\n  – Cmd + Ctrl + Right Mouse anywhere inside a window, then drag to resize\n\nThis thing was a breath of fresh air after spending too much time trying to figure out how to get the latest version of BetterTouchTool to do what I wanted. It's also not dependent on SIMBL, which is nice.\nMy only complaint is that the key bindings are not configurable. I'd prefer to use ⌘ Cmd+⌥ Opt+⌃ Ctrl+Left Click for resizing, since clicking and dragging with two fingers on a trackpad is a bit awkward. But hey, it's open source, and as always, there's an issue for that.\n\nA: Not entirely what you are looking for, but you can drag and resize the window without bring it to the foreground. Command-drag on the menu bar (or an empty space on the toolbar) to move the window and command-drag on the resize handle to resize it. \nCommand-clicking on window elements may allow you to use them while the window stays in the back, but that works inconsistently, iirc. \n\nA: You want Zooom/2. Free trial available. It works by holding down a modifier key and simply move your mouse around (no click required!) and then what ever window your cursor is above will resize or move around depending on what key you press, which is customizable. It does more things as well.\nI use JiTouch personally, but that requires a trackpad and to be honest, this specific feature on JiTouch takes a little practice to invoke the gesture required, which is unfortunately not customizable.\n\nA: It's interesting that most OS X users don't easily recognize lower as being the specific feature that's being sought.  If I have a window blocking most of the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't want to disturb its position, so move is useless.\n\n*it's blocking several windows I want to see, so switching to the all-window view and picking one doesn't help much\n\n*I still want to see part of the window, so minimizing it isn't helpful.\n\n\nI want to lower it to be behind the other windows.  In Unix/Linux, I can just keep typing at the parts of it I can see while leaving it in the back.  I just leave the interesting parts of windows visible and interact with all of them without destroying how they're arranged.  So easy.\nOS X allegedly doesn't even support writing code for  pushing a window to the back.  Nor typing and mousing at partially hidden windows without using modifiers.  Nor is it even remotely decent at leaving my windows where I left them through sleep, being moved, etc.  If i kill a window, OS X raises a random number of other windows of the same type, forcing effort to restore order (there may be a setting for this, I'm looking).  If i open a window from a window on one screen, the new window will appear on a screen chosen apparently at random instead of on the one the initiator window was on (also might have a strong, not sure).\nOverall, OS X window management is abysmal compared to the *mix world -  highly frustrating after working with the real thing \n\nA: I think echoing the question is helpful. I havent found a way to lower a window yet and like the original poster states various other things arent a good substitute. The desired behavior is something like option or command + (left, center, or right) mouse anywhere on the window (or instead on the title bar) and the window moves to the lowest (most behind) in the window stacking order, thereby exposing the next window. Pressing again pushes the next one to the back and so on- and with multiple (many) presses you rotate through the entire collection of windows on the screen- its exceptionally fast- say all 10 or 20 windows in in just a few seconds.. Unix window managers let you bind it (lower window is what its called) to most any key and mouse combination. Command left mouse would be a likely choice for many who use it (something you press all the time- thousands of times a day).\nI have found that it appears it can be done in code NSWindowLevel (cocoa routines) but I have found no mention of it in any (macos) utility yet. Next I need to look into the different window managers. Switching window managers on a unix box is definitely doable- but some assemby is definitely required. I'm a bit uneasy about jamming in a new window manager here to see what happens. But perhaps its fine.\n\nA: You can run FVWM as your window manager for X11 apps and have this behavior.\nFor OS X apps, you can move and resize them without the mouse, using just the keyboard, using 3rd party apps (link, link).\nI'm not aware of any other techniques to raise or lower.\n\nA: I have not used JiTouch but it claims to have a \"move/resize\" mode that is based on just the trackpad. If you have a desktop this will work with the external trackpad.\n\nA: Based on this video, you want to use BetterTouchTool.\n\nA: I suggest you to try Afloat.\nIn 10.9 it is working with finder if it is reloaded after afloat.\n", "Q: How do I select a song in a playlist in my library in iTunes 10? In iTunes 9 and earlier, I could go to a playlist and hold down option and click the small arrow next to the name of any song in that playlist to select that song in the main library instead of the playlist. This was very useful, for example if I wanted to remove a song from my library, I could use this to \"reveal\" the song in the main library and remove it from there.\n(This little icon, when clicked on without option, would open the iTunes store for purchasing the selected song)\nIn iTunes 10, there is no more arrow for me to option click on. How can I select a song in a playlist and go to that same song file in the main library in iTunes 10?\n\nA: One way to do this is through the context menu on the selected song. Ctrl + Click (right click), go to the \"Show in Playlist\" item, and select the \"Music\" option.

How do I make it work?\n\nA: Open up the Web Inspector with Command+Shift+I and type in this:\ncopy('\\u202e');\n\nIf this won't throw an error, the right-to-left override is copied to your clipboard. You can try it even in the console, just press Command+V and then type some text.\nThis works cross-platform (just be sure to use Ctrl in Windows), in all WebKit browsers, but only inside the console.\n\nUpdate: I've just installed Safari 5 on Win7 x64, and it seems that the character is copied to the clipboard, but Safari can't handle it.

I installed ProXPN on my Mac and successfully used it. It installs an icon in the menu bar which you can use to enable and disable the application. I was messing around with the settings and clicked on the option which said something like \"show icon near spotlight icon in the menu bar\". After restarting my computer, I no longer see the icon in the menu bar. When I try to launch the application from my Applications folder, it doesn't seem like it's doing anything. \nHow can I access the program or its settings?\n\nA: I tested this on my mac, and all this seems to do is to not place the icon next to the spotlight icon.  When I relaunched proXPN, it placed the icon on the left side of all icons on the top. At first, I couldn't see it either but that was due to the app I had open having too many menu items taking up real estate - I switched to finder and voila!  There the proXPN icon was.\n\nA: It seems that the problem is that when you launch ProXPN and you are not connected to a wireless network, it does not launch.\nYou must first connect to the wireless network, and only then launch ProXPN.\nIf you have set up ProXPN to launch at start up, it will work as long as your computer is set to automatically connect to a network, which will probably happen before ProXPN is launched automatically.\n", "Q: What are the risks of connecting a MacBook to an insecure wireless network? What privacy and security risks am I exposing myself to when I connect my MacBook to an open insecure wireless network?\nAre there any risks that are worse or better when compared to a Windows PC that's connected to an insecure wireless network? \n\nA: Just because we're rocking a very secure OS, doesn't mean viruses, malware and the like can't happen.  Be vigilant, all the time.  It is a misconception that you are not prone to virii.  Basically:  all the same risks as if you connected a PC laptop to an insecure wireless network.  Just with a lower probability of getting attacked.\n\nA: The primary concern is that any HTTP communications (and other non-secured communications) could be intercepted, including cookies, which often contain your login information. Note that secure communications (HTTPS) have other methods to keep your information safe, so financial communications are usually safe.\nThe secondary concern is that your Mac can be directly attaqued by any\nother computer within a 50 m radius. If your Mac doesn't have its firewall on, then this attack may lead to some file access (through guest account), and some remote control (through Apple Remote Desktop, VNC or more secret system vulnerabilities).\nThis security risk exists equally whether you are using OS X, Windows, Linux, or any other operating system, and there are no additional risks (nor less) on any platform.\n\nA: the simples trick is:\n1-someone is looking over your shoulder what you typing (in public place)\nso DO NOT type, use copy/paste for password (stored previously in a document !) so they do not see which keys you are using.\n2- Turn on Firewall, use only httpS in your browser ect...\n3-What kind of Public WiFi are you connecting to?\n3.1- one where you just jump on (fully open).\n3.2 Anyone with logon info can join (bars, hotels, ect (still risky).\n3.3 Connecting to a public router (with many others) but you have your unique/personal log in (only router owner/administrator can screw you).\n", "Q: Mac Pro video card recommendations I am looking for recommendations for a video card for my Mac Pro version 2,1 circa spring 2007. It currently has the ATI 512MB card that Apple sold as an option at the time.\nAre there new cards on the market that would work with this machine? My main reason for asking is that the current card is overheating and crashing the machine. \n\nA: There are very few video cards that will work with the Mac Pro 2,1. When Steam was released in early 2010 and I realized that the stock video card did not have enough power to run Steam games, I searched for a replacement. I ended up purchasing the nVidia GeForce 8800 GT 512MB Video Card from a vendor on eBay. It wasn't especially cheap; it cost me about $260.\nMy criteria were as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Must provide more graphics power than the card it was replacing.\n\n*Must be a drop-in replacement for the stock card; I did not want to mess about with stuff like reflashing the ROM on a card that was intended for Windows machines, for example.\n\n*Not obscenely expensive. The card that I bought really pushed the limit; I had originally wanted to spend no more than $150.\n\n\nThe 8800 GT provided enough power to run Steam games, and also improved screen redraws for everyday work, including my light-duty work in Photoshop and InDesign. Though the 8800 GT is a couple of generations back in terms of the hard-core gamer crowd, it should serve well as a more-powerful replacement for the stock card.\nI'm pleased with the result, as it has allowed me to extend the operational life of my Mac Pro.\n\nA: Sounds like its a X1900. I know the 3870 that ATi later put out was compatible (it worked even with the originals.) Because they are the same architecture the 4870 will likely work as well. Also found this so it looks like the 8800 GT is an option.\nDon't bother with the ATi 2600 as a replacement, it a piece-of-s@#$ card.\nBe careful with whichever card you ultimately decide and make sure its confirmed to be working. More recent models of the Mac Pro did have gfx cards that weren't compatible with older models.\n", "Q: Wet iPhone 4 doesn't know its IMEI and ICCID and displays connect to iTunes but lacks passcode Well, due to a bit of an accident, my iPhone 4 got wet. The bright side is that it seems to not have suffered CPU damage, since it still boots up fine. The downside? It displays the connect to iTunes screen, and doesn't know its IMEI and ICCID when the information icon is selected. Naturally, I connect the phone to iTunes, since that's what it wants. Unfortunately...\n\niTunes could not connect to the iPhone \"iPhone\" because it is locked with a passcode. You must enter the passcode on the iPhone before it can be used with iTunes.\n\nAnd naturally, there's no place to enter the passcode on the iPhone, as it continues to display the connect to iTunes screen. Now I suppose I could take it in to Apple, and they'd probably give me a replacement if I'm lucky (I hear water damage isn't covered), but I'd prefer to get this phone working again, since I haven't backed its photos and contacts up before. (I do know it still has those before when I go to the emergency call screen, it does display my normal photo background as the background). So any help?\n\nA: I dropped mine into water shortly after buying it and I saw some weird behaviour too.  I figured that it was submerged for such a short time, less than a second, that not much water would have penetrated the case so that maybe the weird behaviour was down to some shorting that was happening in the dock connector and the headphone socket so I made sure these were clean and entirely dry.  I plugged a dock connector in and out lots of times and after a day or so the weird behaviour stopped.  You can also try putting the phone into a bag of rice which will dry out any residual moisture.  You could wrap it lightly in tissue paper to prevent any small pieces of rice from entering the body of the phone.\n\nA: Beautiful for you, Apple just changed their water damage policy to be covered under warranty! If possible, take it to an Apple Store and have them look at it. They can probably fix it if you think that you can, and then you can back it up before getting a replacement.

Left and right click work as well as scrolling.\nNow I want smooth/inertial scrolling as well as middle click. Is it possible?\nAlso is there a way to imitate the ability in OS X to scroll any window regardless of whether or not that window has focus?\n\nA: Answering the second part of the question, KatMouse is your solution.  It brings very Mac-like cursor/scroll interaction to Windows.\n\nA: I don't believe there is any way to setup middle click unless you do something like map a key/mouse combination to middle click in some applications.  The fact that the magic mouse doesn't have a middle button means you can never 'tell' window that you've pressed it.  If someone wrote a driver which accepted both right & left buttons being clicked as a middle click that might be possible but I don't know of anything which exists which does that.\n", "Q: DVD to iMovie converter for Mac 10.4.11 First of all, is there such a thing?

I'm a Windows software developer interested in reading the .quizPack file format. It is designed for Apple iQuiz software, and contains text quizzes for iPod. The text file format, unpacked from quizPack, \"trivia.txt\" is fully documented here. But how to unpack these files?\nI cannot find any specification of this format on Apple website or elsewhere. \nHere is a downloadable example of quizPack file.\nThis format can be created, for example, by iQuizMaker software. iTunes can read these files and export them to iPod as \"unpacked\" quizzes.\n\nA: Okay, I dug into this and found that you have a couple of misconceptions, but it now all makes a little sense.\nThe page How to Install an iQuiz Package? says:\nShared iPod Quiz (iQuiz) games on iquizshare.com come in three formats:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Flat file format (e.g. history_albert.txt).\n  \n*Zipped package, which contains readme, trivia.txt, and maybe some customized artworks in .tga format.\n  \n*QuizPack format, which is created using Aspyr Media iquizmaker software.\n  \n\nThat third format? It's created by Aspyr software and read by Aspyr software—and nothing else. It's not an Apple format at all.\nIf you have a .quizpack file and you want to read what's in it, here are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to iquizmaker.com and download the free iQuiz Maker software (available for both Mac and Windows).\n\n*Install iQuiz Maker.\n\n*Launch iQuiz Maker, choose File > Import, and then open your .quizpack file.\nDoing this creates the file (and any necessary folders) ~/Music/iTunes/iPod Games/iQuiz 1.0/<quiz name>/trivia.txt (Mac) or ~\\My Documents\\My Music\\iTunes\\iPod Games\\iQuiz 1.0\\<quiz name>\\trivia.txt (Windows). \n\n*Quit iQuiz Maker, as you've got what you want.\nYou can't do these steps in reverse to turn a trivia.txt file into a .quizpack file, but given that the .quizpack file is fairly useless, there's no reason you'd ever need to.\n\nOld version:\nCan you give an example of what kind of file you have, and what you mean by \"unpack\"?\nThe article you linked to says that:\n\nThe text-based data files you create are not compiled or put into any unreadable form. \n\nand\n\nTip: If you're curious and you've enabled disk access, you'll find your games in /Volumes/(name-of-your-iPod)/iPod_Control/GameData_RO. One of the folders in that directory—possibly 11002—contains the iQuiz game. In that folder, look under UserTrivia/Packs to discover your user-installed game sets.\n\n", "Q: For least power usage, should I turn off or put my Mac to sleep? If I'm not going to be using my Mac for a while, am I better off shutting it down completely or just putting it to sleep?\nObviously it uses more power to \"sleep\" than to be off completely, but it uses much more power during the boot up and shut-down stages... Presumably, if I'm going away for a couple of minutes, I'm better of sleeping it, but if I'm leaving it for some longer period I should shut it down completely (assuming I know how long I'll be away for!).\nHow can I tell when to shut it down vs sleep it?\nI'm interested in knowing the answer for a few different, specific models (me/friends/family):\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Mini (late 2010)\n\n*MacBook Pro 15\" i7 (late 2010)\n\n*MacBook Pro 15\" Core 2 Duo (late 2007)\n\n*MacBook 13\" Core 2 Duo (mid 2008)\n\n\nBut of course it'd be useful to have some more generic information for others too.\n\nA: I have a fairly generic (mathematical) answer, but can only find some of the actual numbers.\nAfter finding the 2010 Mac Mini Environmental Report from Apple, there are four important numbers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tbooting = The time taken to boot up and shut down (s)\n\n*Pbooting = The power consumption while booting or shutting down (W)\n\n*Psleep = The power consumption while sleeping (W)\n\n*Poff = The power consumption while off (W)\n\n\nThe last is actually stated in the Mac Mini's environmental report, and for very low sleep power usage can't just be ignored!\nThe total energy used during a period of sleep is:\nEsleep = time * Psleep\n\nThe total energy used from shutting down, being off for a time and booting up is:\nEshutdown = (time * Poff) + (Tbooting * Pbooting)\n\nRequiring that Eshutdown < Esleep, we can rearrange the inequality to give:\ntime > Tbooting * ( Pbooting / (Psleep - Poff) )\n\nThe Mac Mini's environmental report provides Psleep and Poff, and if we assume say 90 seconds total booting/shutting-down time and about 35W during said times, this would give an answer of 45 minutes.\nI've yet to find similar values for the laptops (they make a big deal about the Mac Mini being so energy efficient), and the booting power/times would really need to be measured to provide accurate figures. But it surprised me that it was only 1 hour (I was expecting somewhat longer based on claims I've read in the past, that went along the lines of this discussion).\nAs @mankoff points out, there's another option which is to hibernate using something like DeepSleep. In my experience this is usually faster than a full shutdown, and of course it uses the same (incredibly low) power while off/hibernating. So to compare mathematically, you can consider it a \"shutdown\" of sorts and use the same equations (with the time taken to enter and recover from hibernate as Tbooting and the power usage while it swaps between RAM and disk as Pbooting). More than likely, this will reduce the the time answer since Tbooting should have been reduced somewhat.\nA final thought is that laptop batteries seem to lose voltage over time, even when off, at a higher rate than the Mac Mini's advertised Poff. So the Poff value might actually be quite a bit higher for a computer with a battery, which may significantly lengthen the threshold between standby and shut-down/hibernate (however the battery and charging circuitry will complicate measurements of Poff). And to further complicate things (and possibly ruin the whole argument!), more recent Mac laptops will write the contents of RAM to the disk even when they go to sleep, in case your battery runs flat while sleeping (effectively preparing for a hibernate in case it's forced).\n\nA: You are asking a very specific question:\n\nHow can I tell when to shut it down vs\n  sleep it?\n\nIf you want to know exactly when the time window is where the cost benefit changes from sleep to off, or vice versa, you'll want to buy a Kill-a-Watt and collect some data, such as exactly what the sleep power draw is of each of those systems, and what the boot power draw is.\nI expect the power draw will be a function of temperature, among other things. And the cost might be a function of time-of-day, depending on your power provider.\nA 3rd option to complicate the choice is hibernate mode, easily available via the DeepSleep widget.\n", "Q: I have 21.5GB free. Why won't my MacBook Air 2010 let me use Boot Camp? I'm trying to install Windows 7 on my MBA, 2010. \nI open up Boot Camp and attempt to use it, but after the first screen it comes up with an error saying it can't install unless theirs 10GB of free disk space. Right now my HDD has 21.5 GB free. Disk Utility won't let me partition my drive either, so a manual install is out of the question.\nI need help! My original thoughts were that my disk needed to be defragged to get 10GB of contiguous space. Is this a possibility?\n\nA: To expand upon my above comment:\n64GB is just not very much space, especially when you consider updates, your own programs, data, etc etc.\nMy recommendation, if it is possible and available, is to run Windows XP from a USB drive. There are a handful of documented procedures for getting WinXP on a flash drive and running it from there. I would recommend following this TechRepublic article to get it all set up for that.\nThis should negate the issue with Boot Camp, let you keep the 64GB of HDD space to your trusty OS X partition, and hopefully provide enough room on your flash drive for WinXP to grow with applications as well. \nHopefully there is nothing Vista or Win 7 specific that you need to do. Good luck!\n\nA: Unfortunately the solution is not a great one.\nI had a similar problem on my MacBook a while ago, and the problem is actually due to file fragmentation, however no defrag tool could actually solve the problem. There are various solutions on Google indicating that a defrag does work, but I had no success with any of them.\nThe problem is related to how the files are spread on the drive, and BootCamp requires a continues 10GB or more of free space on the drive to be able to create the required partition. \nThe only way I got around the problem eventually was to format and reinstall the drive. \nMy honest advice is to look at using something like VirtualBox which is free, and create a virtual image for Windows. Depending on what you need to do, you can get away with a relatively small image. Windows 7 can run quite happily with only a 1GB of RAM if you don't need Aero. You can also look at paid for options like Parallels or VMWare Fusion\nAlternatively, you could look at installing Windows on a secondary drive via USB. The speed won't be great, but if again, depending on what you need it for, it might be a sufficient solution.\n\nA: MacOSX has a defragmenting utility that is run in the background when your Mac is idling. It's possible that the \"Free Space\" being shown in Disk Utility is not accounting for any swap space that the Hard Drive uses. If you are down to about ~20GB of free space, it's probably not enough free space for the Disk Utility to move all of the essential files it needs to move in one piece to fit a new partition in that new space. I might also mention that even if you were to be able to get fit a 10GB partition into that ~20GB of free space, you would only have about ~10GB of free space left on your hard drive which is probably getting close to the point where your system slows down enormously because there isn't enough space on the hard drive to do all of the tasks it needs to do with moving files, file swap, etc.\nMy best advice would be to use a utility like GrandPerspective (http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/) which basically shows you a picture of all the 'stuff' on your hard drive and might give you an idea of some files that you can get rid of and what might be eating up a lot of space. \n", "Q: Is MotionX GPS capable of caching Google Maps Tiles? I've read this post here: How can I save Google Maps in iOS for offline use? but it didn't mention anything about MotionX GPS caching Google Maps tiles. I believe (correct me if I'm wrong) that it can cache proprietary tiles or Bing tiles or something, but can it cache Google tiles? That would be sweet if it could!\n\nA: From the MotionX GPS manual:\n\nUnfortunately due to Microsoft restrictions on Bing maps and Google restrictions on Google maps, these maps types can't be cached or stored onboard. By contrast, MotionX road and terrain maps may be cached and downloaded.\n\n\nA: Yes.\nPrevious answer was correct that it is against the terms of service and licensing agreements, but incorrectly answers the OP's question.\nThe application is (successfully) able to cache Google map tiles (specifically, terrain in the below example) with the following URL scheme: http://mt1.google.com/vt/lyrs=p&x=[X]&y=[Y]&z=[Z].\n", "Q: When minimizing, not have new window of same app come to focus There's a couple of behavior's that I find very frustrating, and no luck yet in fixing them:\nImagine chrome with multiple windows open.

I'm about to format an external hard disk drive (HDD).\nWhat are the key differences between journaling HFS+ and non-journaling HFS+? Apart from the fact that one has journaling and the other does not, how does it affect the drive's performance (with numbers)?\nMy gut-feeling is that in \"normal\" use journaling would be the way to go, but are there any situations where non-journaling HFS+ should be considered? Linux compatibility is one, since it seems that the kernel's hfsplus module supports read & write on non-journaled HFS+, but only read on journaled HFS+.\nAnything else worth mentioning?\n\nA: Journaling adds delay and complexity to every operation that will get journaled. Journal writes force data to be written immediately to the drive which can make other outstanding drive transactions slower.\nA nice treatment of what journaling does is in retired Technical Note TN1150: HFS Plus Volume Format.\nThe journal area on the file system is written heavily and forces the OS to hard sync data on a regular basis. This can interfere with large read and write operations that are happening at the same time as a file system modification that requires journal entries.\nThe advantage of a journaling system is that at mount time, the system can easily complete whatever file creation or directory modification entry that was in the middle of being attempted. The filesystem itself is repaired and made into a consistent state with extreme rapidity compared to a full file system catalog check.\nFor beginning users - having a computer ask them to repair a disk is not fun and provokes uncertainty and forces them to learn a bit about how things work. Yes - it brushes under the rug the fact that they could lose that one picture they were just downloading or moving. In practice, common sense ensures that even new users double checks the file before deleting it off the camera when the \"darn computer\" reboots in the middle of copying their photos to iPhoto. (More likely they call their support system for help at this point if they even notice the next boot was slower or it happens more than twice a week)\nFor advanced users that want the fastest performance, the benefits of journaling start to look more like penalties at the price of slower performance. These penalties can be substantial if the system is already near capacity or needs maximum performance for large sustained data transfers typical of pro video or some database workflows.\nThings like these are good reasons to disable journaling:\n\n\n*\n\n*database storage files\n\n*redundant machines with data healing routines after a failure\n\n*RAID storage that takes care of journaling and more \n\n*just needing extra speed no matter the cost\n\n\nA: I don't have numbers to back up the statement, but using HFS+ non-journaled is a good idea in certain volumes that require absolute speed, without worrying (too much) about a possible \"data loss\" or \"data corruption\" in case of power failure or similar. \nWhen is using HFS+ Non-journaled a BAD idea?\n\n\n*\n\n*External (USB, FW, ESata) drives that are connected and reconnected often: It's usually a bad idea, since these drives tend to be accidentally disconnected very often and or their power sources unplugged.\n\n*Partitions where data integrity is important and protection from an unexpected power loss is a must. (Documents, Music, Videos, Backups, etc).\nWhen is using HFS+ Non-journaled a GOOD idea?\n\n\n*\n\n*Scratch, Temp, trivial storage and similar drives and partitions, where speed is > data integrity in case of power fail. You want your Final Cut scratch volume to be non-journaled (you do have an UPS anyway, don't you?). You want your Photoshop temp to be non-journaled. Drives to copy stuff around (a Pen drive for example if you take care of properly ejecting).\n\n*Any other drive that requires portability and compatibility like you correctly pointed out. \nRemember, maintaining the journal adds a small overhead, but the benefit in case of improper volume dismount are important, no only to avoid a full disk \"scan\" at startup or re-mount, but also in terms of making sure that data is not corrupted in the first place. \nMounting a non-journaled drive that has been incorrectly unmounted, will cause a fsck scan, whereas the journaled drive will be able to be up and running in a shorter period of time (scanning the journal and applying uncommited transactions). \nRegarding Speed and tests, I don't have much info to back up the above claim, however, as far as I know the speed difference not only is very small and even hard to notice, but in some case Journaled filesystem is faster than non-journaled. \nTurn out that despite the overhead of the journal, some operations can be made asynchronously in the Journaled drive, whereas the non-journaled version has to perform things synchronously.\nFor reference I googled a little bit trying to find an old comparison (the numbers are probably valid since HFS+ hasn't really changed much since their first iterations in OSX, other than adding Inline Attribute Data records, and access control list file security and maybe something else.\nHere's the website with the charts:\nComparison Between HFS+ Journaled vs HFS+ Non-journaled\nTL;DR: \n\nThe file copy/duplicate/copy sequence\n  was pretty much equally fast for both\n  journaled/non-journaled HFS. The same\n  sequence with the folder was again\n  somewhat faster with the journaled HFS\n\n(emphasis mine)\nConclusion\nI am somewhat surprised to see the above results, as I was kind of convinced that using Non-Journaled was really faster for some operations, but apparently the little cases where it can make a difference, it's overweighted by the \"safety\" of Journaling. \n\nA: You could have a look at the developer tools to compare disk performance of different filesystems if you were so inclined, there's a guide here: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/DOCUMENTATION/Performance/Conceptual/FileSystem/Articles/MacOSXAndFiles.html\nI can't find any comparison with hard numbers but it probably goes without saying that a journaling filesystem offers fault-tolerance but a non-journaling filesystem offers better performance\nI added the file-system tag too\n", "Q: How do you use your iPod shuffle or nano? I bought my first Apple product a few months ago, an iPod shuffle, a tiny little music gadget that's fun to play with. However its getting a little boring because I don't know what I can do with it or places I can use it. Currently, I'm limited to listening to it during sleeptime as a lullaby machine. What do you do with your iPod shuffle/nano? how do you get the most out of it?\n\nA: Nanos or shuffles are great for workouts at the gym or while running. You can use them just about anywhere. I personally use a Classic for my stuff, but the nano is great if you have a smaller library or want something very mobile.\nAs far as what you can do with it (other than playing music), it really depends on which generation you have. You obviously can't really run 'apps' on it, but many generations (of nanos) had some small games, radios, could play video, etc. \n\nA: My shuffle has two playlists: \n\n\n*\n\n*Sleep: Thirty minutes of soft instrumental music followed by nine hours of rainfall\n\n*Wakeup: One hour of four- and five-star songs lasting two to five minutes that have not been played in the past six months\n\n\nIt needs a recharge every two days.\n\nA: I use my iPod nano in the car to listen to podcasts during my commute. I have a Belkin TuneBase FM Transmitter—the older model of what's shown below—so that I can listen using my car's stereo.\n\n\nA: On my iPod Shuffle (Gen 3) I have one playlist, \"Gym\" - mainly fast paced rock and electronic music, I use this while I'm training. The shuffle is ideal for this as it is lightweight and clips to my gym kit unobtrusively.\nThat is all I use it for as have an iPhone, so use that as my day to day device, however, even the 2GB Shuffle will hold 12 hours of music if you want to listen to it at work etc, although I appreciate it is a bit trickier to navigate music.\n\nA: I use may 6th gen nano (the touchscreen one) as a pedometer and a flashlight when my iPod touch runs out of battery. (Also as practice for iOS accessibility gestures.)\n\nA: I have a long commute to and from work and I find that whether I am in the walking part of the commute or the part that involves buses and trains, it helps me relax, pass time faster or wake up better depending on the tracks I decide to play. \nIf I'm at home and want to work on artistic projects, it's also great to use in conjunction with speakers (I use a Bose SoundLink mini).\nOnce I played music while taking a bath it was really nice. \nBased on how many songs play, you can know exactly how much time passed. Just try to remember the name of the first and last song, and when you're near your computer plug it to iTunes and click from the first to the last song and the total duration will be displayed.\n", "Q: Is it possible to create a Wi-Fi hotspot from iPhone that's not ad-hoc? First off, I am well aware of how to—in general—create a wireless hotspot using an ad-hoc network directly from my iPhone.\nI have previously used the latest version of MyWi (version 4.12.6 at time of writing) but it creates ad-hoc networks and this doesn't work for me.\nI do not want to and cannot create an ad-hoc network from my iPhone to allow another device to share its connection (must be wireless, as bridged connections don't help either).\nDoes anybody know if this is possible?\n\nA: In iOS 4.3 there will be Personal Hotspot integrated in firmware. Just wait\n", "Q: Why do I occasionally get the message \"could not activate cellular data network\" when opening the sms app? It pops up a message telling me this which means I have to tap 'OK'\nThis is seriously annoying, does anyone know why this happens and what terrible event it is supposed to help me avoid?\n\nA: This is annoying but you can't turn it off unfortunately.  If the iPhone detects a momentary loss of connection to the cell tower and it believes the user is interacting with the phone then it will pop this message up.  It's intention is to let you know that you don't have a signal and therefore won't be able to send your SMS, email etc. however more often than not it's a sub-second blip in the signal rather than a total loss.  If you watch closely you'll sometimes see the signal bars disappear and reappear as the signal is reacquired.\nYou could try going to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings to see if somehow you've altered some network setting which is affecting your reception but you'll lose wifi passwords etc I think if you do that.\n\nA: I had the same problem on a new iPad (2012 model) with T-Mobile in the UK.  \nSolution was easy once I found it (credit: this answer) - just go into Settings > Carrier, and turn off Automatic (i.e. selection of carrier).  When your carrier is listed below (may take a minute or two), just select it.\nThis completely fixed the problem, which wasn't fixed by going into airplane mode, rebooting, or tweaking the APN settings.\nUpdate: unfortunately this turned out not to be a complete fix after some time using this, though it did improve matters.  Using a Vodafone SIM worked fine, so I suspect the problem is with T-Mobile UK.\n", "Q: How can I match the text color and background color in Terminal? I use emacs/org-mode which uses color for hiding some of the headlines as is shown here.\n\nThis works well with Aquamcas, but when I run emacs in text mode, I still see the stars in the headline as I didn't make the background color exactly the same as the color of the font.\nHow can I match the text color and background color in Terminal?\n\nA: Open a terminal window and type some of the text whose color you want to set the background the same as.  Then open Terminal preferences.\nClick the Window tab and then the Background Color.  This brings up a color picker window.  Click the magnifying glass in the upper left and move it over the text you want to match the color with.  When you click on the text this will set the color you want.  You could also set it directly in the RGB slider panel shown in the 2nd image which matches the text color from your image in the question.\n\n\nA: You might have not enough colors in the terminal. Try\nexport TERM=xterm-256color\n\nin your ~/.bashrc\nAlso, are you running \n/usr/bin/emacs \n\nor \n/Applications/Aquamacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -nw \n\nThe two behave differently (in /usr/bin/emacs you may have Emacs 22)\n", "Q: How can I open a new customized (color, font, etc.) Terminal window from the command line? I'd like to open a new Terminal window in Terminal.app. I'd also like to be able to customize this window (color, text, etc.), based on one of my pre-defined defaults, or based on something else not yet set in Terminal preferences.\n\nA: *\n\n*CMD+n opens a new terminal window.\n\n*CMD+t opens a new terminal tab.\n\n*If you want to open something other than the default Terminal, use the techniques here to open a pre-defined Terminal setup. You can also do CMD+n,i,Tab to bring up the Inspector, then use up/down arrows, or type the names, which lets you choose a pre-defined Terminal.\n\n*If you want a setup hard-coded and not yet known to Terminal.app, follow these instructions. \n\n", "Q: Define different screen resolution when external monitor is plugged in I have a Macbook Pro that I use both at home and at work. At home when I'm using it as a laptop, the standard resolution of 1440 x 900 is fine as it's closer to my eyes. However, at work I plug in an external LCD so that I can dual screen and the resolution of the Macbook screen is a bit too large for my eyes. \nIs there any way for me dictate a smaller resolution when I have an external monitor plugged in? Or is there an app that does this?\n\nA: You don't need any apps, Snow Leopard and Leopard (and possibly earlier versions) do this out of the box.  I just tested it and it worked without any effort at all.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Displays\n\n*Select the checkbox 'Show displays in menu bar'\n\n*Connect your external display\n\n*Arrange them however you like\n\n*On your menu bar, you'll see an icon shaped like a screen with two legs, click it\n\n*Set your resolutions and that's it\n\n\nWhen you disconnect your external screen, your MacBook screen will return to the original display setting, if you plug the external screen back in, the resolutions you setup last time will be automatically selected.\nNote: I tried this with a Mini-DisplayPort cable because that's all I have.  I don't know if behaviour is different if you use a different connection.  I'm on a 13\" Unibody 2009 model and running OS X 10.6.6\n\nA: From the command line, cscreen lets you adjust monitor resolution.\nTo automate this when you attach your external display, you'll want to begin with MarcoPolo. If it doesn't support changing screen resolution (I think not), then you'll want it to run a shell script or applescript that calls cscreen.\n", "Q: Is it possible to purchase an iPhone app now to download later? I was wondering if there is a way (or at least if it is possible) to purchase an app from the app store now, but do not download it now (to save on disk space) and download it later when required. \nOften there are apps on sale (e.g., Lonely Planet city guides) that are not immediately useful. These are great apps, but not immediately useful. So, instead of downloading the app right away and use up disk space, it would be nice to purchase the app and download later when required.\n\nA: You could purchase the app, then tap on the icon as soon as it appears to pause the download, and leave it paused indefinitely.\n\nA: You can purchase the app through iTunes, rather than the app store.  Then you can download it later.\n\nA: You could purchase the app and delete it. When you need it, go back to the appstore and redownload it for free.(since you purchased it already)\n", "Q: Using a shared DVD burner Machine #1 is a mac mini with a CD burner only.\nMachine #2 is a macbook pro with a DVD burner.\nBoth are current on MacOSX. Burner is shared. Machine #1 is connected to machine #2 in the finder.\niDVD is oblivious on machine #1 to the burner on #2. is this expected?\n\nA: I think that feature is only for sharing discs that are in the drive, not for sharing the drive and it's burning capabilities itself. The manual says:\n\nIf you have installed the DVD or CD Sharing Setup software, you can share DVD or CD discs in your computer’s optical drive with other computers on your Ethernet or wireless network. If another computer on your network doesn’t have an optical drive, you can set up your computer to allow the other computer to use the disc in your computer’s optical drive. \n\nInstead of what you're doing now, try saving from iDVD as a disk image. You can then use Disk Utility on the other mac to burn that disk image to a DVD-R.\n", "Q: Resolution of pictures hopping from iphoto to imovie to idvd So, I've got this pretty big (12 minutes, 3sec/slide) slide show. I may be done with it. I may not.\nThe show is composed of ten iPhoto-11 slideshows. Each one was set up 4:3, then exported, with the kind advice of Nathan in another question to specify H.264, 2048 bit rate, and the second-highest resolution (my pick on the theory that I was not going to be driving an HDTV, just a relatively ordinary projector).\nImported into iMovie-11 at 30fps, arranged, decorated with music, exported to via the share menu iDVD. Didn't touch anything in iDVD. just pushed the burn button.\nInserted resulting disk into nice new-ish dvd player with 30\" LCD TV, 720 resolution. The pictures have a very visible structure of being built of little squares.\nI dont' see artifacts in full-screen preview in iPhoto, or in full-screen imovie preview on my macbook pro. (On my mini, it warns me that full resolution will be degradated, so the presence of them there is not a surprise). But the DVD has this problem.\nedit\nI discovered an option in iDVD to vary the 'encoding quality'. Moving that up to professional looked to me to make a notable improvement.\nIdeas?\n\nA: This issue may have been caused by a variety of issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*The resolution was only at 720p.\n\n*iMovie compressed the movies.\n\n*The \"encoding quality\" may not have been up to par.\n\n\nThese programs have been updated significantly now, however. iPhoto has been replaced with Photos, and iDVD isn't supported now.\n", "Q: Filesorter alternative I found a really cool app in the App Store called FileSorter\nIt automatically sort files. Is there any FREE alternative?  \n\nA: Actually, that application is free.\n\nA: I've found this site a little while ago that let's me see if there are alternatives to apps either because they're on Windows (and the app's not important enough to boot Parallels) or too expensive:\nalternativeto.net\nGive that a try and see what you can find.\nSpecifically for you, this is what I found there.\n", "Q: set up Caps Lock as a shortcut for changing the input language I want to set up Casp Lock as a shortcut for changing the input language. There are some solutions like this. But it requires installing some software and doing tricks. Is there a way to do it in a neat way, say through terminal command?\n\nA: Yes, you can use Caps Lock to change input language without third-party software.\nAll you need is a custom-made keyboard layout (usually made with Ukelele ) that has two alternative sets of characters bound to Caps lock=on and Caps lock=on and Shift=on states.\nPros: zero-lag, no weird key remapping hacks needed\nCons: buit-in input source indicator becomes useless, looking at the Caps LED is not very convenient for touch-typists.\nTo mitigate the \"cons\" I use lightweight third-party app called Capster that changes the icon in the menubar depending on the Caps lock state.\nI also use small Applescript to disable Caps lock delay.\nI'm using this method for many years and never looked back.\nThis is my bundle for Russian language (with additional Ukrainian characters bound to alt+key)\nhttps://github.com/falcn/Caps-layout\n\nA: Unfortunately no, unless someone posts a (possible veery long) command that modifies the keyboard drivers in the same way PCKeyboardHack and KeyRemap4MacBook do, but in general, using these is the way to go.\n\nA: In case people who get here from search engines don't read the linked post, you can change caps lock to something like F19 with PCKeyboardHack:\n\nAnd then change the shortcut for selecting the next input source to F19:\n\n", "Q: How am I supposed to use ProXPN on an insecure network? It seems that ProXPN will only launch after you connect to a wireless network. How, then, can I keep my connection secure while connecting to an insecure wireless connection while using ProXPN?\nThere will be a brief moment where I connect to the insecure network, and only then I can launch and enable ProXPN. Is there any way to make it so there isn't this brief vulnerability? Or is this brief moment not a risk at all since I am not browsing any websites from when I connect to the network to when I enable ProXPN?\nWhat about other risks such as someone hacking into the computer via open ports or shared folders/files?\n\nA: The reason your Proxy will not connect without an active connection is because inherently it encapsulates traffic, pipes it over an insecure connection in a secure fashion, and forwards that traffic to another host which actually makes the request. It is like saying you would like to send a secret letter without using the post service, unfortunately it is the base of how you are communicating.\nIf you join an insecure network and you dont actually perform any actions, there is no risk, that being said, on a mac you do have programs that may automatically request a connection (mail) and send out credentials or try to visit a URL. This is a fairly small risk, you can always keep them closed until you run your proxy software.\nIn terms of open ports or shared files and folders, if you are advertising these services and you connect to an insecure network, the thing to stop them is your firewall. \n", "Q: How can I figure out if a Safari extension is using unreasonable memory/cpu? How can I figure out if a Safari extension is using unreasonable memory/cpu? I'm not really experiencing any unreasonable sluggishness, but I am starting to pile up on the extensions and was considering pruning the most performance draining ones just for good measure.\n\nA: Disable the extension.  Run Safari for an hour (normal use) and note the kind of cpu/memory usages you get from it (using activity monitor or top).\nEnable the extension.  Repeat.\n\nA: You can also use Instruments and attach it to your safari instance and start from there.\n", "Q: Bash or Zsh, what's the difference, why use one or the other? So, the question pretty much says it all. I'm on Snow Leopard, and I do a lot of web development, particularly in Rails 3 which makes heavy use of the console.\nI've seen some notable bloggers etc. mention Zsh as their preference over Bash, but I don't know what difference it would make.\nCould anyone give me a good comparison of what difference there is and what might make one prefer one option or the other?\n\nA: This is from the Zsh FAQ:\n\n2.5: Similarities with bash\n\nThe Bourne-Again Shell, bash, is another enhanced Bourne-like shell; the most obvious \ndifference from zsh is that it does not attempt to emulate the Korn shell. Since both \nshells are under active development it is probably not sensible to be too specific \nhere. Broadly, bash has paid more attention to standards compliancy (i.e. POSIX) for \nlonger, and has so far avoided the more abstruse interactive features (programmable \ncompletion, etc.) that zsh has.\n\nI've used them both, but prefer Bash now days because the machines I work on default to bash consistently. The standards-compliancy comment is important to me because that means consistency between OSes.\nZsh has nice autocompletion abilities, but I kept finding cases where it didn't know what I wanted. That was several years ago, so it might have improved since then.\nI've found that enabling \"vi-mode\" (set -o vi) in Bash makes it a much nicer command-line environment than it normally is, so I do that immediately in my .bashrc file.\nWhen writing shell scripts I don't ever program in either bash or zsh - I program using sh (/bin/sh), because it's the lowest common denominator and the least likely to have compatibility issues. That's just an old habit that has stood me well.\n", "Q: Why are my iPad landscape screenshots rotated the wrong way? All my iPad landscape screenshots end up rotated to portrait view. In other words, they are 90 degrees turned the wrong way. It's annoying. No I don't have the rotation lock on when taking them. I am on 4.2, but it has always done this even before 4.2 update. I am jailbroken, so it may be one of the jailbreak apps. Has anyone else experienced this? Any ideas?\n\nA: This is default behavior and is not an issue with jailbreaking. Even my new iPad 2 straight out the box does this on 4.3. I see this as a bug and hope Apple fixes this.\nThe fastest and simplest iPad app that I've found that I like for rotating, cropping and flipping is called Crop Suey HD.\nUPDATE: It appears as though iOS 5 has finally fixed this annoying bug. And the even better news is that they are now throwing in photo editing tools right in the photo viewer app; including the option to rotate.\n\nA: That is just the way it is... why... I don't know, but they can be rotated using either the photo app, or photoshop express.... don't remember which one I used...\n\nA: When I did all the screenshots for my Keynote for iPad book, I had to solve this problem. The easiest way to do it is with an application that we all have in the Applications folder on our Macs but usually don't think of: Image Capture. Connect your iPad via USB, then fire up Image Capture. There's a toolbar at the bottom of the Image Capture window with buttons that let you rotate selected shots 90 degrees left or right.\nBetter yet, you can use Automator to create an Image Capture plugin that performs a variety of image transforms. The one I created first rotates the picture 90 degrees left (Preview action), then converts it from the native PNG to TIFF (Preview action), then saves it to a specified folder (Finder action). The plugin appears in the Import To pop-up  menu in the Image Capture toolbar.\n", "Q: Use Goal0 Nomad 7m Solar Panel to charge MacBook Air? I've got a Goal0 Nomad 7m solar panel. It produces ~7 amps @ <22V DC on a regular day.\nThe MacBook Air has a 45W charger. The markings on the charger say it runs at 14.5V DC @ 3.1 amps. Unless I'm wrong (and I may be, I'm only a beginning EE student ;) those numbers are smaller than the ones on the output of the solar panel. To confirm it another way, P=IV, (P is power in Watts), so theoretically P=7*22=154 watts. 154>45.\nThe Nomad 7m has a 12v cigarette-lighter style outlet that will fit the MB Airline Adapter. The problem is that it puts out 12v (or so it says, but I'm hoping it's actually around 14) and the Airline adapter needs 14-15 to work right.\nWhat do you guys think? Is this possible? Any recommendations for alternative options (I could always use a 3rd party vehicle adapter if need be). If it puts out this much juice it should also be able to charge a regular MacBook, I think. \n\nA: If you look at the page for the Goal0 Nomad 7M (click \"Tech Specs\") It's rated for 7 Watts. \nI don't where you got the \"~7 amps @ <22V DC on a regular day.\" \nSo the sort answer is - That panel won't even keep the MacBook Air running at idle, let alone charge the battery.\nYour post got me curious, so I broke out a Kill-A-Watt power meter.\n11\" MacBook Air Power Draw, battery already fully charged, measured at the wall:\n\n\n*\n\n*Idle, screen backlight completely off: ~4.7W\n\n*Idle, Minimum Screen Brightness: ~4.9W\n\n*Idle, Half Screen Brightness: ~5.4W\n\n*Idle, Maximum Screen Brightness: ~8.0W\n\n\nFor the active tests, I have the screen set to half-brightness, where I usually use it:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Moving the mouse in circles with the trackpad: ~6.5W\n\n*Scrubbing the Dock (with magnification): ~11.2W\n\n*HD Video Decoding, GPU accelerated: ~15.6W\n\n*SD Video Decoding, GPU Accelerated: ~11.2W\n\n*Flash SD Decoding (not sure if it's accelerated): ~12.7W\n\n\nOk, these figures are VERY approximate (the Kill-A-Watt is not a high precision instrument), but they do put things in the ballpark.\n\nThe theoretical approach -  \nInsolation is the term for the amount of energy that falls on a set area per set time.\nBasically, we can calculate the amount of solar energy which falls on a specific area.\nThe Photovoltaic array wikipedia page gives us a ballpark figure of ~1Kw/M².  \nThen, you have to take the efficiency of the Photovoltaic Panel into account. \nWikipedia gives us a best-case mono crystalline panel efficiency of ~25%, shich means that only 25% of the light which falls on the panel is converted to electrical energy, while the rest is dissipated as heat, reflected away, etc...\nTherefore, a 1m² panel will, at the equator and with a mechanism that points it directly at the sun, manage ~250 W.\nFrom this, we can tell that a 154W panel would have to be ~0.616 m² (154/250 = 0.616), far larger than what you have.\nExamining the 7W panel you have - How big does a panel have to be to produce 7W?\n7/250 = 0.028 m², or 280 cm² or about 14*20 cm, which seems pretty accurate, judging from the pictures on the product page.\n\nAnyways, I went of on a bit of a tangent here, because you mentioned you're an EE, which is one of my main interests.\n\nA: I'm the EE for Goal Zero.  The Nomad-7 is 7 watts, as already noted.  The printed W must have been confused as an A.  All Nomad panels have 12V output ports, which are actually ~15V outputs, which is a good voltage for charging batteries.  I generally don't recommend charging sensitive electronic devices directly from solar panels, because of the potentially inconsistent nature of solar weather.  Instead, use the solar panel to charge a separate battery, which doesn't mind inconsistency, and then use the battery to charge your sensitive electronic device.\nI have a Macbook Air and the airplane adapter.  I have attached this cable to an adjustable power supply, and tested voltages from 13 to 16.5V.  None of these, when driven through the airplane adapter, will alow the Macbook Air to charge -- only run.  There are some electronics in this cable which signal to the laptop not to take a charge, and I have not yet figured out how to reproduce these.  I'm waiting on another magsafe that I can cut apart and experiment with.\nI have run my Macbook Air directly from our 12V batteries and from our larger panels, through the airline adapter.\n\nA: I would also like to thank GZ for responding.\nsince the question is hanging a little i would like to share my experiences.\nmost laptop and phone chargers today  appears to test the current available\nbefore starting to charge.\nas the magsafe is rated at 45w it is no far stretch to assume that it will test\nif it can output 3.1 amps 14.5\nto do this with a power conv factor of perhaps 90% (can be as low as 88 and up to 95%)\nit will need 45/0.9 ~ 50watts. at 15v that would require 3.33A\nFor GZ test, it is fairly common that a variable bench power source 0-24 can only deliver 2A ie it can deliver 50w at peak voltage but only 30W at 15v(have had this problem when trying to power industrial pc at 24)\nhence unless you put a \"buffer\" battery between the panel and the magsafe that can deliver 3.5A temporarily to keep the charger happy. it wont work.\nwhat i would like to know is if the usb port on the nomad 7 is 5.0 or 5.4 volt   \n", "Q: What readers annotate PDFs better than the Preview app? I usually spend around 3 or 4 hours a day working with and annotating PDFs. I've always used Preview, but there's a few things that bother me about it. Mainly the large icons used when you place notes, which can get in the way in tightly formatted documents. \nIs there an alterate PDF reader that is any better for annotating documents?\n\nA: PDF Expert is hands down the best pdf editor made.  Better than Acrobat.\n\nA: PDF Studio Viewer is a free PDF Reader for macOS that can annotate PDF documents with text and graphical comments including text highlights and markup, shape annotations, text box, typewriter, callout, etc. It can also fill interactive forms.\nAll annotations are compliant with PDF specs and Adobe products and can be viewed by other readers on all platforms.\n\nA: Skim is a pdf reader specialy designed to annotate pdf.\nSkim is a PDF reader and note-taker for OS X.

This seems to be a pretty common feature in most Windows-based IM clients and I'm confused as to why I can't find this functionality in Adium. By \"dock\" I mean dragging the buddy list to the edge of the screen and having it essentially turn into a sidebar which no windows overlap and which takes up the entire height of the screen.\n\nA: You can certainly achieve \"something similar\" if you tell it to be above other windows and don't hide when in the background (options I don't use or like)\n\nOf course it won't be a real \"docked\" app like the DOCK, but it will behave mostly like it.\nYou can control the vertical and horizontal size:\n\nAnd here's how mine looks:\n\nUPDATE to be honest, I use it on the right side, but Adium will \"stick\" to the Screen side when close to it.

The reason I am asking is that I have a lot of \"remastered\" albums in my iTunes database that were released in the last couple of years but the original ones had been released much earlier. Now I would like to store the release year of the original album with it. So that for example I would be able to sort and search by original release year OR by acutal release year.\n\nA: As I understand it, there is no such capability in iTunes. However, the ID3 tag description on Wikipedia has some information. Basically, what you want is possible, but varies between ID3 tag version.\n\n\n*\n\n*In ID3 v2.3:\n\n*\n\n*There is a TORY tag for the original release year\n\n*There is a TYER tag for the actual release year\n\n\n*In ID3 v2.4:\n\n*\n\n*There is a TDOR tag for original release time\n\n*There is a TDRL tag for actual release time\nIn effect, v2.4 got more specific with the tags (going from year to time), and any half-decent ID3 tag editor should handle either version of the spec just fine. However, iTunes doesn't handle these tags natively.\n", "Q: How do I suppress the address bar in mobile Safari? When I add the Nibbble web app to my iPhone home page, it not only installs an icon, but when run, also hides all of the mobile Safari chrome.\nHow does it achieve this?\n\nA: You only need the first part of this code to do what you ask, but the rest may also be helpful.\n// hide the browser chrome\n<meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\" /> \n\n//set the phone status bar style; can be grey, black, or black translucent\n<meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\" content=\"black\" />\n\n// set the viewport for iOS\n<meta content=\"minimum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, maximum-scale=0.6667, user-scalable=no\" name=\"viewport\" />\n\n// set a custom icon for when a user bookmarks the app to the home screen\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" href=\"/path/to/icon.png\" />\n\n", "Q: Is there any way to output to two 1920x1200 external monitors with any of MacBook Pro or Air? I understand that you can output to one 1920x1200 monitor while still using the laptop's screen, and one 2560x1600 monitor using the dual-DVI adapter.\nBut can you output to two external 1920x1200 monitors?\nI don't care if you can still use the laptop's screen in that case.\n\nA: Yes you can, you can run one monitor from the normal monitor port and another from a USB port but you need a special connector which makes the Air think it has a 2nd monitor attached.  Here's an example on YouTube\nYou need something like the Matrox Dual Head 2 Go which allows you to have multiple monitors with your MacBook.  The performance of USB-attached monitors tends to be worse than those connected with display cables so they would be fine for regular computer use but probably not for gaming for example.\nEDIT\n\nWith the release of Thunderbolt-capable Macs, you can now drive dual external Thunderbolt displays from MacBooks which have a separate graphics card.\n\nA: I've rencently bought a Matrox Dual Head 2 Go that supports up to two 1920x1200 displays. ! You can still use the MacBook Pro main screen while the 2 externals displays are connected ! Plus the control software by Matrox is nice and simple to use .\n\nA: I highly recommend Plugable's USB 2.0 to VGA/DVI/HDMI Adapter. It will do up to 2048×1152 or 1920×1200. I use it at work every day, along with a second monitor plugged right into the display port. It uses DisplayLink's chip and drivers, and works well on Snow Leopard and Lion.\nIt's a bit slower to update than the MacBook's internal monitor or the monitor plugged directly into the display port, but as long as I'm not trying to watch video on it it's great.\n\nA: In this post, it is shown how to do it by using an external USB accessory, apparently enabling up to six monitors. Sorry the blog is in Italian, but the particular device demonstrated there is evident and some links to further explanations are to English-language sites.\n", "Q: Displays won't stay off when I put them to sleep when I press Shift + Control + Eject the displays go blank for a second, then they turn on again.\nThere's no way I can get them off permanently.\nI also don't want the computer to sleep as I leave it downloading over night.\nI have a MacBook with an external monitor attached.  \n\nA: Sometimes this can be due to the System Management Controller.

If it's locked (uchg flag), you can unlock it in either the Finder's Get Info window, or with chflags nouchg \"Bad File\".  If some other flag is set, use chflags no<whatever> \"Bad File\" to clear it.\nEDIT: The -O flag to la adds another column between the group and size of the files, listing file flags (if any).  Note that flags are entirely separate from extended attributes (what -@ displays).  Here's an example:\n$ touch \"Normal File\" \"Locked File\" \"Invisible, Append-only File\"\n$ chflags uchg \"Locked File\"\n$ chflags uappnd,hidden \"Invisible, Append-only File\"\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 gordon  wheel  0 Feb  4 07:24 Invisible, Append-only File\n-rw-r--r--  1 gordon  wheel  0 Feb  4 07:24 Locked File\n-rw-r--r--  1 gordon  wheel  0 Feb  4 07:24 Normal File\n$ ls -lO\ntotal 0\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 gordon  wheel  uappnd,hidden 0 Feb  4 07:24 Invisible, Append-only File\n-rw-r--r--  1 gordon  wheel  uchg          0 Feb  4 07:24 Locked File\n-rw-r--r--  1 gordon  wheel  -             0 Feb  4 07:24 Normal File\n\nThe uchg flag is what gets set if you check the \"Locked\" box in a file's Get Info window.  BTW, the \"hidden\" flag only affects the Finder -- the only way to hide files from the command line is to put a . at the front of the filename.\n\nA: Another method of unlocking said file would be in Finder itself.  Under the General expansion of Get Info.  This toggles the uchg flag.\n\n", "Q: Why does my WLAN stop working when I plug in my HDTV? I'm facing a strange problem where my WLAN suddenly stops working the moment I plug in my HDTV into my MacBook 13\" (mid-2010) using an HDMI to DisplayPort adapter.\nAny idea why this is happening?\n\nA: Bit of a shot in the dark but have you tried a different cable?  Maybe the one you're using is damaged and is shorting something somewhere which is affecting the wireless antenna.  It is definitely a weird problem by the sounds of it but you could try a couple of tests by first using a different cable, then using a different TV with each cable and see if they all produce the same result.  If they do then it might be worth getting Apple to take a look at your DisplayPort socket if you're under warranty or a good repair shop.  I've seen weird things happen to computers with dodgy USB cables so there's a chance it's something like that.\n\nA: It look like I'm not the only one who is fighting this issue. That guy uses the same router (Linksys WRT54GL) as I do and just switched the WLAN channel to solve the problem.\nThis does also solve the problem for me.\n", "Q: Is it possible to return the iPhone to its very original factory state? Back to the screen that asks for SIM insertion and iTunes connection on background. Is it?\n\nA: Settings -> General -> Reset -> 'Erase all Content and Settings'. On some devices (3gs and 4) this will only return the iPhone to factory settings (but not activation mode). For the latter, I'd just plug it in to iTunes and click 'Restore'.\n\nA: If I understand what you mean is restoring to its original state -\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect iPhone to the computer.\n\n*In iTunes, under the Devices, select your iPhone.\n\n*Select the Summary tab across the top.\n\n*Click Restore.\n\n\nA: Yes assuming you haven't upgraded the firmware or OS past the factory state. \nWhether or not you can revert to factory levels, here is how to get it ready for activation:\nRemove the SIM and power off the device. Then plug it into iTunes while off and holding the home button all the while until you see the connect to iTunes icon. This is recovery mode but the device still has user data on it.\nYour computer then can wipe all content and re-install any OS that is the same or newer than the OS that is currently on the device. You can load iTunes with older images than is current but just not older than is currently on the phone.\nYou can't go backwards in terms of undoing an update on the phone without modifying/jailbreaking the device - even then it's not a given and rarely successful in reverting back to factory OS or firmware.\nOnce the restore is complete disconnect the phone from the computer before replacing the SIM card.\n", "Q: How can I make Growl Tunes start automatically? How can I make GrowlTunes start automatically when either Growl or OSX does?\n\nA: Go to Preferences -> Accounts -> Select your account -> Select the \"Login Items\" button or tab (not sure what I would call it!) -> Then press the + sign to add a new start up item and select GrowlTunes.\n\nA: Another, possibly quicker way, is to drag it into your dock (if not already there), then right-click it, go to Options>Open at Login. Then drag it out of your dock if you don't want it to stay in your dock.\n", "Q: Diagnose periodic slowdowns/freezes When I am watching a YouTube video, the video will pause and freeze for about one second, every 10 seconds on the dot. I've timed it. I have also tried watching activity monitor but it doesn't show anything out of the ordinary spiking. And it's not Flash or the browser in particular, though they show the worst effect. But even as I type this, every 10 seconds it freezes. In other programs too I'm pretty sure I have seen this freeze. (lately I haven't used many other programs, to be honest, so I'm not 100% sure)\nI am trying to avoid the brute force approach of removing things one by one and seeing if it stops. Before I resort to that, is there anything sort of like activity monitor but maybe that will graph usage so I can just look at a spike in usage from a single process? Or is there some other method you can recommend for finding out what is causing this every-10-second freeze?\nThis, by the way, is a few-month-old 17\" MacBook Pro with a 2.8ghz i7 and 4gb of RAM and all updates.\n\nA: Sometimes a good place to look is the syslog.  If you know it's every 10 seconds then there's a chance that a message will get logged for whatever is happening.  Try this in terminal and append the results to your question or even have a look yourself for anything that looks unusual which is happening on 10 second intervals.\ntail -n 20 /var/log/system.log \nYou need to be an admin user to run the above command\n\nA: I gave it a while after posting this question but couldn't find a solution. I uninstalled what I thought was the most likely culprit: Little Snitch. Unfortunately the uninstall required a restart, so I don't know which one fixed the problem (or if it's really fixed) but after restarting, of course, the symptoms are gone. I'm honestly hoping it will happen again so that I can confidently reinstall Little Snitch, because I highly doubt it's the cause of the problem.\nI think I've still noticed the problem but not quite as severe. It's quite possible that I haven't yet been running Firefox long enough, and it's something that happens over time (or at an untimely sleep which Firefox doesn't properly handle, maybe?).\nAlso, next time I notice this severe problem, I found some commands to use to try and monitor firefox: rwsnoop and iosnoop. They are command line tools which monitor application disk activity. If the every-10-second thing accesses the disk then I'll see it and that might help in debugging it.\n\nUpdate:\nIt ended up being Firefox, and I've now been happily using Chrome for months with no Flash problems. Besides this freeze problem (which only showed up after several days of using Firefox, if I remember correctly), Firefox also uses a TON of memory, which is completely unacceptable. So those factors, combined with the fact that I received a Cr-48 shortly after asking this question (thus it runs Chrome and I want to sync with my laptop) means I am now a Google Chrome fan.\nAlso I really don't think it was Little Snitch. I did reactivate it sometime later after asking my question, and a month or two later I thought about how Little Snitch was just sort of allowing everything, and disabled it - but after switching to Chrome I didn't see these freezes again.\n", "Q: If I leave my chargers plugged into the wall socket at all times, do they consume energy or present a safety risk? This is something I always wondered about: when I leave my charger plugged on the wall socket but not charging anything, is it still consuming energy? \nSome notebook chargers have a led that is always on, so I guess it's consuming at least a bit. But what about Apple chargers? I want to leave my iPhone and iPad chargers always plugged under my desk (so I can just connect my device when I want to charge) but I'm worried they shouldn't be plugged all the time due to safety risks or phantom power consumption.\nIs there any way to measure this to be sure?\n\nA: It will consume energy even when not connected to your Mac.  Also, the longer you leave them plugged in, the more likely they will be damaged by an electrical surge or lightening strike etc.  Best thing to do is probably have a multi-socket lead which your chargers plug into under your desk and you can just pull that out of the wall when not in use.  That protects your equipment from electrical issues and saves your back from getting under the desk!\n\nA: All your chargers are designed to support being plugged in 24 hours a day.  Don't worry about them wearing out.  If you are concerned about a small charge to your electric bill or if you're trying to do your part to waste less electricity, then you can plug them all into a power strip.  When you aren't using them, turn off the power strip.\n\nA: That's yet another power consumption myth. Just don't bother about it*.\nYour milage may vary ( and as others said, it does consume energy. Though it is less than 1 watt hour (calculator included) and it will probably cost you a few cents per year at most. At least the macbook adapter, which is probably consuming 0.1 kWh. Some mobile phones adapters may get to 0.5 kWh and even beyond. That makes a lot of difference and then it can cost up to 2 bucks per year. Calculating kWh at $0.2. Still an unnoticeable cost.\nIf you want to actually save money with small actions like that, I'll quote that great Michael link I've already gave it on the top:\n\nYou're much better off addressing your heating, cooling, lighting, laundry, and computer first. \n\nA couple more of interesting related side notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*The macbook is designed to being plugged 24/7, though advised to unplug once a month, even that is not needed. The advise is basically to keep the battery meter calibrated, but it will calibrate just fine any time you do it.\n\n*Funny calculation: if you leave your macbook always plugged in, it will cost roughly those $25 per year another user also calculated. Now, if you unplug it every day for 9 hours you save about $10. But you'll be using battery energy, and charging it will be done at 80 kWh. It takes 2 hours to recharge 80%, so if you do this every day, it will still cost you the same $25. If you drain closer to 0 every day, it will take 4 hours to a full charge and cost you at least $37 total. If you just close the lid and use almost no power while unplugged, then the battery cost won't really kick in, and you can save those $10. Maybe it will be only $9.\n(*) So it is quite ok to leave it on, but I wouldn't. Kind of.\nWe should always have at least a power strip for electronics and switch them down regularly anyway, for safety. At very least on a thunder storm, as hazards may happen. But high voltage discharges don't come only from neighbouring nature nor only from thunder. I just unplug almost all my devices from the wall.\nNow the real point is: do you have an extra U$79 to spend and have handy an extra charger? If so, then just leave it on for convenience (and laziness)!\nAnd if you want to be environmentally friendly, keep in mind those $1 a year multiplied by a over guess-timate of 200 million people who uses a macbook is still nothing ($5 million per year or 20 million kWh or 0.00000002 pentawatt-hour against 144 pentawatt-hour average global consumption estimate in 2008) and it's not like you can convince all those people to get off their convenience anyway.\n\nA: It does consume energy. Feel it, it will feel warm or even hot. It doesn't use much, but it is still a good idea to not waste this. Unplug it, or buy a power strip and turn off the power strip when it isn't needed.\nTo find out exactly how much, you could use a Kill-a-Watt, or read the MacBook Environmental Report (PDF). The current version (MacBook, May 2010, White) says the no-load power draw is 0.010 W. The older version (MacBook, 2008, Metal body) draws 0.15 W at no load. This is quite a difference.\n0.15 W means if you left it plugged in for a year you would use 1.314 Kwh. Given a price of roughly $0.20/Kwh this would cost you about 25 cents per year. If the computer is on the whole time (at 14 Kwh) the cost would be about $25/year.\n\nA: I measured my MacBook Pro’s charger, and the iPhone/iPad chargers, with a Kill-a-Watt-like device, and it didn’t seem to use any significant power when plugged into the wall on its own (e.g. it was less than 1 watt).\nBUT:\n\n\n*\n\n*I’m not sure if my device is sensitive enough to measure very small amounts of power though.\n\n*your mileage may vary. If you’re interested in this sort of thing, I’d get a little dongle of your own and do some measuring. Mine cost about £5.\n\nA: Given the different circumstances, a charger for the iPhone 4/4s/5/5s/6 can be plugged in for 24/7 without a difference with charger. A minor current that is less than 0.01 percent of a watt goes into the basin of the charger and isn't enough to even be considered a worry. It'll equal out to a third of a cent a year.\n\nA: I wouldn't recommend doing this. Also, never keep your devices plugged in constantly... This will reduce its battery life. It's a good idea to do a power cycle every month to keep a healthy battery (let the battery go down until it dies, then recharge fully).\n", "Q: Is there any global Finder setting for \"Keep Arranged By\"? Is there any global Finder setting for \"Keep Arranged By\"?\nI know I can set it on a per folder basis pressing Option - Right Click:\n\nIt is painful having to do this for every folder though...\nJonathan\n\nA: Right-click on the background of the folder and choose \"Show View Options\". Set it up how you like and click on \"Use as Defaults\". \"Show View Options\" is also in the View menu in the top menubar or even available via \"Command + J\" on your keyboard.\nThat's the theory, but honestly I've had mixed results with this.\n\nA: No, unfortunately there is no global setting for this.  If you press ⌘+J in any folder window it opens a dialog where you can set the default view and the sort parameter but this only applies to this folder or any child folder you open directly from this folder.  You could also run an Automator script to apply view styles to subfolders of specific folders on your Mac\nHere's a good article on how it works and what your options are \n", "Q: iOS: how can I disable calendar alerts?

As of MacOS 10.6.6, there's no keyboard shortcut that I know of for zooming (maximizing) the window.\nThere's ⌘M to minimize, though.\nI made a custom shortcut, defined it on the keyboard preferences pane, but as it identifies the menu command by name (\"zoom\"), it clashes with other commands in some applications, for example this one I'm using right now, Firefox.

I have installed emacs with homebrew, with the --cocoa flag, which makes homebrew create an .app bundle in /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/<version>/Emacs.app. I have symlinked the .app bundle into /Applications/, to make it easy to open. The problem is that when I try setting file associations for files, I can't set Emacs.app as the default (the Add button is greyed out):\n\nNow I could just copy or move the .app bundle into /Applications/, but that would require me to copy it over again every time emacs is updated via homebrew. Is there some other way to solve this?\n\nA: I don't know why, but I have figured it out that if I make the symlink to the Contents directory, then associations work fine.\nThat is I do the following in a terminal window, using my personal Applications folder as an example:\n% mkdir ~/Applications/Emacs.app\n% ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/23.2/Emacs.app/Contents ~/Applications/Emacs.app\n\nSomething about putting the symlink inside the Emacs.app gets the bundle recognized.\n\nA: Weird. I just installed emacs through brew and it automatically updated the \"open with\" dialog to include Emacs.app ;\nBut you should be able to do the following: Directly after opening the \"choose an application\" dialog, press \"/\" to get a \"go to folder\" window. Enter the following path:\n/usr/local/Cellar/emacs/\n\nand from there navigate to the Emacs.app (at the current version this should be /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/23.2/Emacs.app) and select it as default application.\n========\nCould you please run the following command to see whether Emacs is registered in your LaunchServices DB?\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -dump | grep Emacs\n\nA: If it's not something you do often, you can navigate to the place where Emacs.app is really and assign it from there.\nDid you try to change the \"Enable: Recommended Applications\" dropdown? I believe there's a \"All applications\" option. Maybe this one will let you select your alias.\nYou said you symlinked the .app. Did you use ln -s? If so, did you try using an alias instead?\n--\nI don't know homebrew very well, but it look like you can extend homebrew with external commands.\nTry to look if you can get the updated .app file and cp to /Applications.\n\nA: My solution is to create a symlink of /usr/local/Cellar in /Applications.  Then, you can find the emacs.app you need to use with the \"Open with\" dialog (in /Applications/Cellar).\nAlternatively, you may use RCDefault (a freeware app) to config the file extension association.\n\nA: The exact paths to your applications shouldn't matter.

And the story you get when you press play seems random.\nAnd I think there's only narration for some of the stories, but I'm not sure, since I can't find a controlled way to navigate.\nCan anyone help to explain how this feature works in detail, so I'll stop feeling like my mom and cursing at the \"broken machine\"?\n\nA: The part starting at about 3:30 of this YouTube video might help.\n\nA: How do I deactivate auto audio @ startup? Currently when I open the app on iPad it disables any other audio I am listening to and cannot read the Daily while listening to radio or music.\n", "Q: MacBook Air issue: Keyboard and in built mic failing The keys 9,o,l and . on the keyboard of my MacBook Air have stopped functioning all of a sudden. Instead of the intended characters, random characters from the same row as the faulty keys appear. \nAlso, the built-in mic is failing.\nWhat could be the problem?\nEDIT: The keyboard and mic problem started to appear after a defective screen panel was replaced a few days ago. I wonder how that could have caused the side effects I'm experiencing.\n\nA: Well to me that sounds like hardware failure.  I'd suggest that you just take it in to your local Apple Store or AASP; I don't see why they WOULDN'T replace the necessary parts (I don't know the MBA assembly well) if it's under warranty.\n", "Q: How do I change my display settings if I can't see my screen? I have a macbook in clamshell mode that's plugged into an HDTV for display output.  Yesterday, I changed my display settings via the System Preferences.  However, I inadvertently picked a setting that is not supported by my screen, and now I can't figure out how to undo the change.  The screen is blank.\nI can open my laptop and go to dual-screen mode and change the settings there, but as soon as I switch back to clamshell mode the system picks the broken display settings again.\n\nA: Try to to go /Library/Preferences/ and search for com.apple.windowserver.plist. It's the file that gets updated when you modify the display in System Preferences (I just tried).\nAccording to this Apple KB, it's safe to delete it. So move it on your desktop and try to reboot.\n\nA: From the command line, cscreen lets you adjust monitor resolution.\n", "Q: Is there an alternative to Find my iPhone to track a lost/stolen iPhone with SMS support? I bought an iPhone 4 recently. I've been using Find my iPhone but I find it a little limited. \nFirst, you need to have Wi-Fi or 3G to be able to deactivate or send a message. That consumes a lot of battery. Second, if you have only 3G enabled (which seems to be a more viable solution), the accuracy isn't that good. I've done some tests and it has detected my phone 100m away from where I am. And finally, if none of those are on, you can't lock your phone with a password, otherwise whoever has it won't be able to turn Wi-Fi or 3G on.\nA friend who uses Android told me about LostPhone, which is capable of doing all the lock and alert functions by SMS too. I dug a bit and found FoneHome and TapTrace, but none of them seem to be SMS capable.\nDoes anyone know a solution to this?\n\nA: If you lose your phone or it is stolen, it is likely to be miles away from your home and just knowing this allows you to use the 'Find My iPhone' feature on www.me.com to remotely wipe (and/or kill) the phone, or to make it bleep and put up a message if you realise you've left it at your friend/family-members' house.\nAn SMS-based app would require you to have another phone to find/lock/wipe your iPhone, plus there's always the chance that you forgot to run the app following a reboot, or that it crashed.\n\"Find My iPhone\" is built into iOS, so you don't have to remember to run it.\nAlthough 3G does use up more battery than 2.5G or 2G, this is not the primary cause of battery drain in a smart phone - try quitting some your apps to find out which one is draining the battery.\nAlso, read through the comments on the link you posted - there are some real unhappy users there who post about the problems. I wonder how many Android phones are out there that somebody could SMS-spam with the magic command to remotely-kill their phone....\n\nA: iLostMyi on BigBoss repo. You're in luck cuz a demo trial was just released today. I think it's exactly what you're looking for. It looks pretty cool.\n", "Q: Striped Macbook mouse pointer For a few months my Macbook (white, 1.83Ghz Core Duo, OS 10.6.recent) has been showing the mouse pointer in a strange way. It's as if alternating vertical rows of the pixels making up the pointer are transparent instead of black. The following photo shows it (try squinting a bit) against a white background:\n\nIt makes using the machine pretty frustrating as the pointer gets lost easily, leading to furious swiping on the trackpad in the hope of catching sight of it.\nI've restarted the machine, installed all updates, reset the PRAM, reinstalled from a Time Machine backup, etc. I'm beginning to suspect a hardware issue, albeit one of the craziest I've seen (and this machine has a long list of hardware problems).\nSo, anyone seen this? Know how to fix it?\n\nA: What is happening is the cursor mask processing is corrupted. It's often one of the first signs of hardware failure in the video system but still could be software.\nTo rule out software you will have to boot from a clean source (install the proper OS onto an external drive, erase your drive and reinstall if you have a great recent backup, or just boot from an install DVD to see if the pointer masking is still mussed up.) \nHardware failure will persist across software installs. It would be worth trying a safe boot - boot with the shift key pressed from the sound until you see the grey apple. \nThis will let you know it's something you added to (or has failed on) the mac after the OS was first installed. A clean install will fix things but you'll want to watch as you reinstall apps in case it's a conflict and not just something that broke along the way in the software. It's possible but not likely you reintroduced the corruption if it was saved on the time machine backup you restored. Did you notice if the cursor was fixed when you booted to the clean system?\nMy experience is this is more often caused by faulty hardware - specifically a faulty GPU or faulty VRAM. This non-unibody mac almost certainly has Intel integrated graphics which use part of the RAM as VRAM. You could try isolating your RAM to see if that helps. If you have a good stick of memory, you would install that while removing your potentially faulty RAM from the system. Also - you could catch one bad stick of RAM by first removing the \"left\" stick and booting. Then remove the right stick and put the \"left\" stick in the right side. That way you'll detect a single failure of the ram slot or ram sticks by moving things around and testing.\nEven though it's irritating, I've seen machines run for stable for years in this state. It's a tiny part of what the GPU does and that machine otherwise was running in a closet and no-one cared most of the time what was on the screen except for when we needed to update or reboot it. You could get a program to make the mouse larger - but that doesn't cure the real issue.\nThe official service diagnostic (as opposed to AHT - the bundled hardware tests will not find this failure) for your machine will diagnose this failure, but I wouldn't pay much to run that since you can rule out the cheaper fixes by the steps outlined above. Hopefully it's the RAM or the software - both of which are relatively cheap and not too time consuming to fix. I have had good luck seeing this diagnosed for free at the genius bar so if you're close that might be worth a visit for help isolating it as well as getting a repair quote.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I am aware this is old, however this happened to me when I attached an old USB mouse. For some reason the cursor started displaying incorrectly like the image posted but for all cursor types. \nAll I had to do to fix it was change my monitor resolution to scaled 720p and then back to what it was originally. The cursor now is displaying correctly.\n\nA: Based upon what Tom C said I simply plugged my monitor into my MBA.  that fixed it on MBA monitor and external monitor.  After unplugging the external monitor it was still fixed on the MBA display.  \n\nA: One of my Mac users has had this happen several times.  Although unlike the picture above the \"stripes\" are horizontal, not vertical.  The cursor stays in this state.  This causes problems in, for example, Outlook, when attempting to resize a calendar event.  Moving the cursor to the edge of the event normally changes the cursor to a double headed arrow, so you can drag the bottom edge of the event to change a half hour meeting to an hour, for example.  When the cursor gets \"stuck\" in the state described above, the user can't make the change they want in Outlook.  The only fix I've found is to restart the computer.  This fixes it every time.  However, this problem has persisted from El Capitan through Sierra.\n", "Q: iPhone E-Mail Cache This is a general iPhone usability question. I wanted to know if we can clear contact cache in email of iPhone mail account?\n\nA: This isn't possible right now, but many people have filed a radar report to request an option to reset this cache in the Settings app (in the same view where it's possible to reset your network settings, etc..).\nThe only way would be to clear the entire contents of your iPhone and don't restore from any backup.\n", "Q: How to make command-key shortcuts work again? I've just upgraded from 10.5 to 10.6.3 and all seemed to go OK, except that now no keyboard shortcuts work in any application. The keyboard viewer shows me that the command keys are working fine, and some global shortcuts work fine when I've configured them to (e.g. command-space to produce the Spotlight search box).\nBut all applications (e.g. Finder, Safari, Chrome, Terminal) ignore any shortcuts I type at them, even if I use the keyboard viewer to type them.\nOh yes, one other strange anomaly: in Chrome, if I type command-C, it brings up the Developer Tools window if the selection is in the main body rather than the URL box.\nAnother anomaly I've just found: in the iTunes search box, the backspace key and the arrow keys don't have their usual function - they produce blanks. If I copy that text, it seems the key codes are going through uninterpreted (here I typed 'a' followed by backspace, left arrow, right arrow, up arrow, down arrow):\n% pbpaste | od -c\n0000000    a  \\b 034 035 036 037                                        \n0000006\n%\n\nWhat on earth is going on, and how can I stop it?!\n\nA: This may not help directly but have you tried creating another account on the system to see if you experience the same issues?\nIf a new account does work then I am willing to bet a plist file in ~/Library/Preferences/ got messed up or not upgraded to the new 10.6 format. I recall a similar key mapping issue when I went from 10.4 to 10.5.\n\nA: Ok I had the same problem and fixed it. I went through all of the Keyboard settings for the Command keys and applications and hit \"Restore Defaults\". \n\nA: My cmd + alt + ctrl keys did't working.\nMy solution: Go to System Preferences -> Universal Access -> Keyboard -> Set key repeat ... and assign the default input for any key because the were turned off!\nI think that this info can be really helpful for someone ;)\n\nA: Try a repair permissions in disk utility.  Sometimes permissions problems after an upgrade can screw up normal functioning of system/application files\n\nA: You could try \"jiggling\" your keyboard layout by temporarily selecting another layout in SysPrefs>Language & Text>Input Sources. I've no idea if that might help, but it's something I'd try.\n\nA: I have now solved this problem by deleting my user account and creating another account with the same name (but a different UID) using the original home directory.\nSome folks at Apple support were baffled by the problem and said they hadn't seen anything like it. If anyone knows where the problem was lurking, I'd still love to know.\n\nA: Ok, a found a solution that worked for me. This might not work and it's probably not the proper way to do it but it worked. Go to System Preferences>Keyboard>Turn on show Keyboard and Emoji Viewer in menu bar, then go to the bar and open keyboard viewer, then press the command key and if it doesn't light up, then press all the keys on your keyboard and then try Command + Q or something.

Also, title, tags, description and geotag info embedding into EXIF is supported. \n\nA: Or you can give flickery a try (www.flickeryapp.com) - it's a full-featured flickr client, downloads EXIF info as far as I know and is currently on sale 48% off on the Mac App Store.\n", "Q: Is there a way to use different network connections for different apps At work we have a firewall that prevents certain outbound connections. But I also have a Clear wireless personal hotspot.  I would like to use the work connection for normal requests but for certain requests such as my Mysql app, I would like to use my personal wireless.  Is there a way to do that without having to switch back and forth.  So all mysql connections just know to use one network interface while other requests use the default.\n\nA: I've asked the same question a long time ago on superuser.com\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/181882/force-an-application-to-use-a-specific-network-interface\n\nA: I suggest you look in to routing with iptables.  I can't remember how off the top of my head, but it would definitely be possible to just catch packets going to a certain host/port and push them off through another interface.\n\nA: To separate traffic by app (and not by destination) would require an OSX version of something like ForceBindIP (for Windows only). No matter how you change the routing tables or ipfw, if you have 2 apps that are trying to reach google.com, they will use the same interface, same route.\nYou might be able to approximate the same kind of behaviour by running each app in a chroot jail that can see only a limited set of devices, and restrict it to a single interface. But that would take a whole lotta configuation for each app.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure there's a way to do this using IPTables, but I'm not an expert at that so I can't really give you detailed information. However, that may point you in the right direction.\nEssentially you would set a route for all outgoing connections on the port you connect to with mysql to use that wireless connection.\n\nA: This is most definitely possible, but like the other people here, I don't know how to do it. Just that it certainly can be done.\nTry asking in https://unix.stackexchange.com/.\n", "Q: iPhone 3G bluetooth unaccessible This is all that's happening. My laptop, my other mobile and my desktop computer all see each other. But my iPhone just keeps \"searching\".\nAny tips on what to try?\n\n\nA: Without a jailbreak, iPhone Bluetooth only supports headsets and wireless tethering.  Developers can also use the Bluetooth API to allow apps to communicate but this has limited functionality.  So basically your iPhone won't discover your phone, laptop (unless it's a MacBook) or desktop because it's not designed to do so.  With the MacBook, it appears that the only functionality allowed is data tethering and no file transfers or other features are enabled.\n\nA: Theres a possibility that the last time a firmware was applied, it mucked the bluetooth part. I would suggest a redo from iTunes.\nAlso, you might want to download the iPhone Configuration Utility so that you can peek into the system logs. Might be a chance theres a log stating why it cant work. \nFrom personal experience, sometimes, certain apps can muck somethings too. I've done these two actions.\n(1-tedious but data safe) remove suspected apps one by one from the device and retrying the BT search again in between apps removal. \n(2-knee jerk & data erased, pls avoid if you really cant part with your data/contacts) backup the device (backup at itunes, backup contacts to sync-able services like yahoo or ms exchange, backup pics and other data to computer), then restore firmware/factory defaults. without restoring your data, test the bluetooth - see if it works. \nIf it does, theres something on your previous setup that is causing it not to work (can be app, or data). Install apps and data one by one and testing BT in between installs to identify which apps is the culprit. Also, you need to recreate/copy/restore/resync your contacts and other data from scratch (not from itunes as it will only bring back the problem again)\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Safe to post iOS crash logs in public? One of the iOS apps I use has been crashing a lot more than usual lately, so I'm posting about it on their forum.  I've got a bunch of crash logs.\nIs it safe to post iOS crash logs in a public place?  Is there any PII in them?\nI see a lot of hashes in them.  Are they completely arbitrary/random, or do they contain my hardware address or something?\n\nA: Crash logs are safe to post in public. There is no identifying information about you in them. All of the random looking text you see are addresses of the various methods that get symbolicated by Xcode into method names. This lets the developers see the exact line of code that caused the problem.\nAlso know, it is harder to symbolicate crash logs that have been copied and pasted. It would be more helpful for the developers to get your crash logs in the original .crash file.\nIt looks like this is no longer the case, I had no problem copy and pasting a crash log and symbolicating using the latest Xcode.\n\nA: No - it is not universally or unequivocally safe.\nAny programmer could save very personal data plainly, so you are at the mercy of the designers and programmers to sanitize and not expose any personal data in a crash. \nThe security by obscurity (values are in hexadecimal) is pretty good and the chance of something sensitive getting exposed is very very low, but sharing a crash report publicly could be hazardous to your privacy. \nI would say don't post anything until you really understand what a device GUID is and how to read a stack trace or hexadecimal characters. Also your risk is directly affected by the nature of the program. Tiny Wings knows nothing because I've told it nothing. It's also unlikely to have scanned my address book or location/contact information.\nOn the other side, my banking program has to store PIN numbers and things I enter clearly before it encrypts them. 1Password works with sensitive data like my social security number. Even though the program may eventually store the data encrypted - a crash report can crash at the point where the data is being turned into something you see clearly on the screen - a sequence of digits. Basically, for a fleeting moment, the data is not protected. \nThe general question \"Is it safe to post?\" has to be no without other qualifications on the data stored in the app. Especially when posting it to something so public and permanent as the internet.\n", "Q: Mac Pro Memory - Should I use 8 RAM slots in dual-channel mode or 6 RAM slots in triple-channel mode? I have a Mac Pro tower with a 2 x 2.66 GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon chipset, and 8 RAM slots. I have been told because of the processor's triple-channel memory capability that I should be installing RAM modules in sets of three. I do a lot of compiling on this machine and want to maximize all the hardware I've got. Does it follow that I should avoid installing RAM in the last two slots?\n\nA: The direct answer to your question is you will get marginally higher peak memory bandwidth with 6 matched memory modules running in triple channel mode than you will with 8 matched memory modules in dual channel mode.  However, there are no guarantees that your machine will perform the tasks you use it for any quicker in either mode.  You need a more in-depth analysis than that.  Firstly, here are the memory replacement instructions for your Mac.  In summary, the instructions for your model go like so:\n\nDual-processor computers have eight\n  memory slots, four per processor. You\n  can install 1 GB, 2 GB, or 4 GB DIMMs.\n  Each processor’s memory controller has\n  three memory channels. DIMM slots 1,\n  2, 5, and 6 have their own channels;\n  slots 3 and 4 share a channel and\n  slots 7 and 8 share a channel. For\n  optimal memory bandwidth, all six\n  memory channels should be used, and\n  memory should be balanced across the\n  six channels. Note: Populating slot 4\n  or 8 slightly drops maximum memory\n  bandwidth, but depending on the\n  applications used, overall system\n  performance may benefit from the\n  larger amount of memory.\n\nIf you have          Fill in these slots\nTwo DIMMs            1 and 2\nThree DIMMs          1, 2, and 3\nFour DIMMs           1, 2, and 5, 6\nSix DIMMs            1, 2, 3 and 5, 6, 7\nEight DIMMs          1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, 6, 7, 8\n\nTo determine whether you would benefit from more total RAM or from keeping your RAM in triple channel mode would require benchmarks.  It's difficult without measuring usage to say whether there will be any benefit from adding more RAM.  If you run a compile with Activity Monitor running are you using all the RAM you have?  Is disk I/O particularly high?  If disk I/O is high but your RAM is not fully utilised you may be better off with an SSD hard drive to run your compilations from rather than adding RAM, check for paging to disk during the compile.  The important thing here is to find the bottleneck rather than hoping that adding RAM will make things run quicker.  It may even turn out that the CPU or the compiler is the bottleneck.  If you have two 6-core CPUs, can your compiler use all that processing power?\nI know I've probably raised more questions than I've answered but it's worth considering them if you're looking for a performance improvement for your investment.\nIf you are a programmer you probably understand these concepts anyway but here's a link to a codinghorror article just explaining the process of finding bottlenecks which I think is easy to read.  The OS in this case is windows but the principles are the same.  You can use Activity Monitor or a third party resource monitoring tool to determine the bottleneck.  \nFor example, to determine whether your system is running out of RAM, fire up Activity Monitor.  Near the bottom of the window, select the tab button labelled 'System Memory' and take a look at the pie chart and figures listed beneath.  Here's an example from my system.  \n \nThe figures in this screenshot you should be interested in are Free and Page Outs.  Free shows how much RAM is currently available, Page Outs is an indicator that your system is running out of RAM and has had to write temporary data to disk.  Anything above 0 in Page Outs means you could potentially benefit from more RAM.  You could perform whatever activity you expect to push your system with Activity Monitor open and monitor these figures throughout.  This should help you determine whether you will get any benefit from more RAM.  For completeness, here's what each item represents.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Free: Memory not in use  \n\n*Wired: Data which must remain in RAM and can't be moved to disk  \n\n*Active: Data which is currently in memory and has been accessed recently  \n\n*Inactive: Data which is currently in memory but is no longer being used.  For example, if you recently quit an application, its data is kept in memory for faster relaunch but it will be used by other application if you run out of Free memory.\n\n*Used: The sum of Wired, Active and Inactive memory  \n\n\nHere's a really nice link too for Mac performance questions http://www.macperformanceguide.com/\n\nA: It all depends on whether you need raw RAM speed or a higher total amount of RAM. Today's RAM is so fast you may not notice the drop from triple channel to single channel. However, considering you can easily put 12GB or more in the first 6 slots using two 3-channel kits, there's really not much reason to use all 8 unless you need to max out the machine for some reason. And just code compiling will not require so much RAM to need to do that.\nSo, in summation, I'd recommend sticking with two 3-channel kits to still get a large amount of RAM at the fastest speed.\n\nA: In almost all consumer or end user uses of a Mac Pro, it's highly unlikely that memory transfer speed will be a performance bottleneck (the reason that SSD's became such an important upgrade despite the initial high cost is that file access times affected almost all Mac users). Where memory bandwidth would count is in scientific use (where the Mac Pro is being run flat out on processor and memory intensive activity).\nLloyd Chambers of Mac Performance Guide did some very in-depth tests of how memory affects performance back in June 2009 when the Mac Pro 2009 first came out. Chambers in particular tests against Photoshop and various raw processing utilities. His conclusion:\n\nWhenever it’s a case of disk access versus memory, more memory is always as good or better. This applies not just to Photoshop, but to the ability of the system to use unused memory for caching, which speeds up all programs.\nBottom line: forget about 8 modules vs 6 and get what you need eg 16GB vs 12GB.\n\nFor some perspective, don't forget that 8 sticks (dual processor configuration, dual channel) is 50% faster than 3 sticks (single processor, triple channel).\nIn my own use (web development, photo processing, research), I'm running 32 GB in dual channel (6 core Mac Pro 2009). I have noticed no slow down over 24 GB in triple channel after trying both. On the other hand, running out of memory will slow your computer down to a crawl.\n", "Q: How can I combine multiple screenshots in Skitch? With Skitch, I often find myself wanting to take screenshots of different parts of the screen, annotating them, and combining them into one image. I could use a separate program for this last step, such as Acorn, but is it possible to do this from within Skitch?\n\nA: Can't do it with Skitch, as noted. But LittleSnapper will work. It creates an image for each screen, then you can drop them all into a photo imaging app and compose into one image. \n\nA: Nope, not possible within Skitch. \nThe quickest workaround I've found to achieve that is using Keynote as a canvas, so you can combine the image in no time : \n\n\n*\n\n*open a new 'White' theme in Keynote\n\n*drag & drop the 2 images from Skitch to Keynote\n\n*align the images in Keynote, resize, do some edits if necessary\n\n*take a snapshot with Skitch\n\n\nA: It's funny, Skitch has some weird limitations, so I use Powerpoint for this.

The best way is to have a primary account that is signed in and all purchases happen with that account, then authorize the machine for any other accounts that want to play music/sync apps.\n", "Q: View Song Lyrics in iTunes Assuming I have songs with lyrics already added to them, how do I easily view them when listening to a song?\n\nA: With reference to the current version (iTunes 10):\nWithout adding third party software, you will need to actively select the currently playing song to view its lyrics.\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘+I opens the Info window for the selected song\n\n*esc closes the Info window\n\n\nIf you open the Lyrics tab in the Info window, it will open in the same tab the next time you open it.\nVisualizers\nIf you want to view the lyrics without interacting with your Mac, you might want to consider adding a third party visualizer. One such visualizer is Cover Version (freeware). \n(NOTE: With OS 10.7.4 & iTunes 10.6.3, CoverVersion shows my lyrics with a upper case letter height of three pixels.  I opened the info window and changed the font from 12 pt. to 144 pt., but it didn't change the Viz.  But it's open source, so I could fix it if I were sufficiently ambitious.)\nAfter you have installed the visualizer, you will need to select it in iTunes. For example:\nView > Visualizer > Cover Version\n\n\n*\n\n*Use ⌘+T to toggle the visualizer on/off\n\n*You can choose the menu item View > Visualizer > Options... to configure some visualizers  (For example, in Cover Version you can switch off the background graphics to make the lyrics easier to read)\n\n\nOther Third Party Software\nIf you want to display lyrics while using your Mac for other tasks, you'll need to use a third party application.\nExamples include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Lyrical from Shullian Productions (Donation Ware)\n\n*LessLyrics from Ixhan (Freeware)\n\n\nA: I’m not sure how long it has been there, but the last three or more versions of Music/iTunes have lyrics display built in.  When a song is playing, if it has lyrics installed, the lyric icon will be highlighted.  Tap it, and the lyrics appear.  When the next song starts, the lyrics will automatically change, too.  Unfortunately, they don’t automatically scroll.\n\n\n\nA: There's no built in way without right-clicking/control-clicking the song and selecting Get Info but you can download widgets such as Desktop Lyrics\n\nA: Get Lyrica from the Mac App Store, it's only $2 and worth much more. This will find lyrics for songs in iTunes and add them automatically to the song file. Very cool.\nAs to displaying lyrics automatically when the song plays... sounds like a feature Lyrica should add! I'll mail the developer.\n\nA: I search a lot about this issue before and the best free solution I was found is to use Get Lyrical. it didn't use your lyric that added to them with iTunes.\n\n", "Q: Macfusion - how can I auto connect on boot? I have Macfusion automatically running when I boot, but how can I have it automatically connect to a server?  Can't find this anywhere..\n\nA: Depending on your version of MacOS, you may be able to use Lingon to create a startup script that runs after you login to your mac.  You will likely need to figure out a command line equivalent to whatever you currently do in the finder to connect to a server.  Run that command in the terminal to verify it works, then create a script using Lingon to execute the command immediately after you login to your Mac.\nThe project used to be hosted on SourceForge, but \"as of 2009-07-06, […] is no longer under active development\". See new link above.\n\nA: Turns out MacFusion is garbage just in case anyone wondered so I abandoned this idea and went back to Cyberduck\n", "Q: Why are there two different sleep states on a MacBook? It seems that there are two different sleep states on my MacBook:\nSleep State 1:\n\n\n*\n\n*Invoked by: closing the lid or by the sleep timer.\n\n*Awaken by: touching the trackpad, clicking the trackpad, pressing a key, or opening the lid.\n\n\nSleep State 2:\n\n\n*\n\n*Invoked by: Apple Menu > Sleep (or its keyboard shortcut).\n\n*Awaken by: touching the trackpad, clicking the trackpad, pressing a key, or opening the lid.\n\n\nYou'll notice that the main difference between the two is that in the first one you can simply touch the trackpad and the computer will wake up.\nI have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why are there two different sleep states?\n\n*Are there any other differences between them besides the one I mentioned?\n\n\nI'm not sure if this is relevant or not, but I changed my MacBook's settings to cause Sleep to only Sleep and not the default 'Sleep and Hibernate'.\n\nA: There are really three, sort of, but they're not exactly as you described:\n\n\n*\n\n*Display sleep: The screen goes blank after a certain amount of time. You can wake up the screen by touching the trackpad or pressing a key.\n\n*Sleep: In this state, the computer goes to sleep: the hard drive stops spinning and the CPU uses much less (almost no) power. This can be invoked by closing the lid of the laptop, selecting Sleep from the Apple menu, or via a timer. You wake up the computer by opening the lid or pressing a key.\n\n*Hibernation: If the battery is almost dead, the laptop will hibernate to save power. This is similar to shutting down, except all the contents of RAM are dumped to the hard drive, which makes it much faster to start up (as well as starting the computer up into the previous state). You have to hit the laptop power key to wake the machine from hibernation.\n\n\nA: One just sleeps the display cuz that is the biggest battery drainer and is quick to turn back on.\nThe other sleeps the display, CPU and hard disks and takes longer to turn on again.\nI'm sure someone else has more to say on this though, so I'll leave it to them.\n", "Q: Deleted hash files; can't login anymore! I've deleted the two hash files in the folder /private/var/db/shadow/hash/, corresponding to my login account. Now, I cannot login, and don't have any other account on my Mac with sudo permissions.\nIs there a way in which I can reset my password? If not, will it be possible to access data belonging to this account? My other accounts do not have permissions to these folders.\n\nA: You can boot into the terminal by holding Command + S at startup. You could create a new user via command line this way. Here is a tutorial. Another option is to insert the installation disc and reinstall the Mac OS X.\n\nA: changing my comments to an answer since Jon was able to solve it using single-user mode\nCan you login using single-user mode? hold command-s on startup.\nI don't know how to reset the password via command line, but if there's a way to do it via command line you should be able to do it via single-user mode.

I do not want to have to put in a password each time my computer sleeps/screen saver turns on. I want a keyboard shortcut to lock the screen while still allowing the computer to wake from sleep without a password. I don't want my session logged out or suspended in any way.\nNote* I would like a keyboard shortcut for this.\n\nA: You can do this with Keychain Access, if you enable its menu bar icon. Directions here.\nI'm not aware of a keyboard shortcut, sorry.\n\nA: The WindowsKey + L combi works to lock the desktop (doesn't necessarily put it to sleep or start screen saver), in Macs its a little different in definition. To \"lock\" the desktop in Macs you would need to invoke a screen saver or turn off the display with a \"Require password after sleep or screen saver\"\nTo put the display to sleep the key combi is Cntrl+Shift+Eject. If your account has no \"Require password\", it wont ask for a password when it comes back on. (note: this isnt a \"sleep\" command - it just turns off the display, mac is still up and running).\nAnother method is to assign a hot corner to \"put display to sleep\"\n", "Q: QuickLook for files with no extension or an unknown extension I'm a programmer, and I find Mac's QuickLook a really great feature for quickly becoming familiar with a particular code base.  Basically, I open up a Finder window in the directory where my code files are, I push the spacebar (to evoke QuickLook), and then I arrow key up/down/left/right through all the files and scroll within QuickLook as needed.\nThe problem that I run into are files with no extension and files with unknown extension.  How can I convince the Mac to attempt to QuickLook these files as text files (which they usually are).  Also, it's really nice how QuickLook automatically colors the code based upon the type of code it thinks it is.  How can I extend the types of code files that the Mac recognizes?  For instance, I want to be able to QuickLook the code in a *.html.erb file or a *.js.erb file.\n\nA: Update 2021 Jan\nIf you are running macOS Big Sur (11.1) and you can't get QuickLook previews of certain files even if you installed QLStephen and other plugins, this is what worked for me.\nBackground\nIn macOS, each file is assigned a UTI. UTIs are used to identify file types (these are the types you see in the Kind column in Finder or in the Kind entry in the General section of the Get Info window). For example, a .txt file (a \"plain text\" file) has the following UTI: public.plain-text.\nTo check which is the UTI of a particular file, you can run:\nmdls -name kMDItemContentType ~/my-file.ext\n\nwhere ~/my-file.ext is the path to the file.\nQuickLook checks the UTI of a file to choose a QuickLook generator to use for display. The QL generators that get shipped with macOS can be found in /System/Library/QuickLook/.\nQL generators have the .qlgenerator extension and you can see their content by right-clicking on them and selecting Show Package Contents. Inside the folder Contents there a file named Info.plist. This file lists which UTIs that generator will be used with.\nSo, the Info.plist of the Text.qlgenerator will list, among others, the public.plain-text UTI. Any file that has that UTI will be previewed using Text.qlgenerator.\nThe generators found in /System/Library/QuickLook/ are locked, meaning that you cannot (in principle) edit them.\nThis is where the QuickLook plugins that can be found on the internet, like QLStephen, come in. These plugins are installed in ~/Library/QuickLook (note that this path starts with ~/, meaning it's your user Library and not /System/Library/) and extend QuickLook capabilities. In other words, they provide the system with new generators that work with UTIs not covered by the system's own generators, or extend them.\nProblem\nWhen you reassign the application a file type is opened with (e.g. Info > Open with > [app] > Change all`), the application might assign that file type a UTI that is not the default, meaning that QuickLook won't recognise the UTI and won't assign any generator (and you just see a file icon rather than the content of the file).\nFor example, the plugin QLColorCode should preview the content of LaTeX .tex files, but in my case it wasn't. This is because I selected Sublime Text as the app that opens .tex files, and ST has assigned a UTI that is different from the UTI used in QLColorCode for .tex files.\nSolution\nThe solution to the problem is simply to let the QL plugin know that it should also work with these \"non-default\" UTIs.\nTo do so, you just need to edit the Info.plist file of the plugin in ~/Library/QuickLook (do not try to edit the system generators in /System/Library/QuickLook).\nMore specifically, you first have to locate the following lines in Info.plist (to open and edit this file, you right-click on it and select TextEdit):\n...\n<key>LSItemContentTypes</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>public.source-code</string>\n    ...\n  </array>\n...\n\nThen, you have to add the \"non-standard\" UTIs in the array, like so:\n...\n<key>LSItemContentTypes</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>public.source-code</string>\n    ...\n    <string>dyn.ah62d4rv4ge80g5dx</string>\n    <string>dyn.ah62d4rv4ge81e5pe</string>\n  </array>\n...\n\nAs mentioned above, to get the UTI of a particular file, do:\nmdls -name kMDItemContentType ~/my-file.ext\n\nIn the output, you will see something like this:\nkMDItemContentType = \"dyn.ah62d4rv4ge80g5dx\"\n\nThe string between double quotes is the UTI of ~./my-file.\nAfter you have added the UTIs, just save the Info.plist file and close it.\nNow QuickLook should work with the chosen generator for the files whose UTIs have been added in Info.plist.\nTo be on the safe side, you can run the following to reset QL and its cache:\nqlmanage -r\nqlmanage -r cache\n\nFin\n\nA: Take a look at the QuickLook Stephen plugin, it opens almost everything I throw at it (as long as it is text based).\n\nA: Fantastic details, much appreciated. A few added items I ran into:\n\n*\n\n*If the ~/Library/Quicklook/ directory doesn't exist, you must manually create it.\n\n\n*In my case, I wanted to extend text previews for .bat and .log. So I had to create the subdirectories for the Text generator Text.qlgenerator. When I look in /System/Library/QuickLook/ I see directories that I don't have in my home directory. These commands create the Quickview subdirectories if I didn't have them, then copy the system file into my home directory:\nmkdir -p ~/Library/Quicklook/Text.qlgenerator/Contents/\ncp /System/Library/Quicklook/Text.qlgenerator/Info.plist ~/Library/Quicklook/Text.qlgenerator/Contents/Info.plist\n\n\n*Next, I determine the UTI with the command provided:\nmdls -name kMDItemContentType ~/my_file.bat\nkMDItemContentType = \"dyn.ah62d4rv4ge80e2py\"\n\n\n*\n\n*And then edit the plist file to add the UTI dyn.ah62d4rv4ge80e2py to my plist file in ~/Library/Quicklook/Text.qlgenerator/Contents/Info.plist\n\n\n*Finally, I can check the quicklook worked correctly with the qlmanage -p option. This prints some debug info and then opens the QuickLook preview window on this file:\nqlmanage -p ~/my_file.bat\n\nA: The simplest way I've found to accomplish this involves installing the plugin QLColorCode. This is a great plugin that includes syntax highlighting of source code for a number of languages.\nOnce it's installed, it's very easy to add support for additional UTIs (Uniform Type Indicator). Get the UTI for your particular file by opening Terminal, or your preferred terminal app, and using this command:\nmdls -name kMDItemContentType /path/to/file.ext\nThis should result in something like this:\nkMDItemContentType = \"dyn.ah62d4rv4ge81s7dg\"\nThen navigate in Finder to ~/Library/QuickLook. Right click on QLColorCode.qlgenerator and choose Show Package Contents. Open Contents/Info.plist in a text editor. Find the following code:\n            <key>LSItemContentTypes</key>\n            <array>\n                <string>public.source-code</string>\n                ...\n            </array>\n\nOn a new line after <string>public.source-code</string>, add <string>dyn.yourUTIhere</string> for each new UTI you want to add.\nSave the file, then run these commands in Terminal or your preferred terminal app:\nqlmanage -r\nqlmanage -r cache\n\nFiles with the UTI you added should now open in QuickLook.\n", "Q: How do I stop iTunes from automatically assigning a hollow star rating to podcasts? I’m having a problem with podcasts in iTunes. Here’s how it seems to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*I listen to a few episodes of a podcast, rating them as I go. (I use the 2-star rating to mark podcasts for deletion once I’ve listened to them. I use higher star ratings for podcasts I want to keep.)\n\n*Once I’ve rated a few (I’m not sure how many), iTunes seems to give the podcast’s “album” a default average rating. This is shown via hollow stars, as opposed to the filled stars for user-assigned ratings.\n\n*This rating gets assigned to all episodes of that podcast, which means:\n\n*\n\n*Episodes of this podcast no longer show up in my “unrated” smart playlist\n\n*If the automatic average rating is two stars, episodes of this podcast show up in my “To delete” list.\n\n\n\nIs there any way to stop iTunes doing this auto-rating? Maybe a plist setting or something?\n\nA: I'm not aware of any way to turn this off. Perhaps you could work around this issue by giving the podcast \"album\" a rating of 3 stars?\nThen your smart playlist for delete could check for 2 star rating. Your smart playlist for \"unreated\" would check for 3 star rating. Your smart playlist for \"keeper\" could be 4+ stars…\n\nA: I have been having this problem and while I don't use the rating quite the way you do, I get annoyed when new episodes are automatically assigned a rating.\nI found this solution tonight for iTunes 12.5.1. I selected the podcast which was getting auto assigned (2 stars in my case). It's a very frequently updated podcast as episodes are short. I set View->View As->List. In the upper right corner there is a circle with three dots across the middle. Click on that and the rating option appears. I set the default back to no rating and all the hollow star auto ratings went away, even for episodes I was finished listening to.\n\nA: When I listen, for the shows I want to save, I tell iTunes to save them all. If there are a few I don't want, I eventually go out there and manually delete them. Otherwise, I have iTunes delete everything I have listened to.\n\nA: I’m currently working around this issue by deleting any podcast subscription that gets the automatic hollow star rating, then resubscribing to it straight away in the iTunes Store. That seems to get rid of the hollow stars for a while.\nIf I’ve saved any podcasts from the subscription, I just tell iTunes to put them in the Trash, then drag them out of the trash and back into iTunes after I’ve resubscribed. They go back into the right place, and the hollow stars don’t reappear for a while.\n\nA: Try assigning a rating to the overall podcast item. Then, click just to the left of the leftmost star on the same line. That cleared it for me. \n", "Q: iPhone headset mic button not working The little button that sits on the microphone of my iPhone headset stopped working. \nNormally, pressing the button will pause a song, go to the next song if you double-click it, and go to the previous song if you triple-click it. \nNow the button doesn't do any of these things, but the headphones and mic are working fine.\n\nA: I discovered that the contact was not flush with the top of the iPhone but was a little bit above. When I looked inside the headphone jack with a flashlight it looked somewhat strange at the bottom. I straightened out a paperclip and managed to fish up a small lump of pocket lint that had probably been forming in there for half a year or so. Just wanted to deliver this as a tip for anyone who runs into the same problem, before you send your headphones back to Apple as broken as so many people seem to have done.\n", "Q: How can I force MacOS to make a binary conversion of filesizes in MB, GB...? I noticed that MacOS (10.6) makes a decimal conversion for file sizes, instead of  binary:\n \nIs there any way to force it to make binary conversions instead in Finder? Because my mind kinda works in powers of 1024, regarding the file sizes.\n\nA: Unfortunately, you can't.  See this apple support document which explains that since 10.6 they started measuring storage capacity according to the decimal GB (Gigabyte) rather than binary GiB (Gibibyte) values.  This matches up with how hardware manufacturers measure the capacity of storage devices.  OS X 10.5 and earlier, along with iPhones, iPads and iPods still use binary measurements.\n\nA: This was changed when OS X 10.6 was released. It is not user-configurable, unfortunately.\nRelated xkcd (comic) strip:\n\n", "Q: How can I allow the cursor to continue moving immediately after clicking the trackpad? I have a Macbook, though I assume this behavior occurs on all of Apple's newer trackpads (the multitouch ones where the entire trackpad acts as a button).\nFor a split second after clicking the trackpad, the cursor won't move (try it!), even if you continue sliding your finger across it. This probably improves usability in some areas (like double clicking), but I don't like it. Is there a way to disable this behavior?\nEdit:\nI went to a local Best Buy, and every single Macbook had the same behavior. The pause is for only a split second. If you try spam-clicking as you move your finger across the trackpad, does the cursor move at all? If you click fast enough, it won't move.\n\nA: I tried moving the curser with my left-hand, and clicking with my right as I dragged. Nothing unexpected happened; The curser changed temporarily during the click then reverted. \n\nA: This really isn't a problem in practice. Your brain gets all the little nuance and adjusts to these refinements with ease. Most come to depend on them and other hardware / OS starts to feel wrong. ( just as you do at present )\nIf you have exquisite motor control, you will end up with the tracking setting very high. The demo macs might be set up even slower than the default to prevent surprise to people using them on the less than ideal store setting. \nSet the double click speed to max and the tracking to max and see if you can immobilize the cursor. \n\nA: It does do this exactly as you say. A way around it is to enable 3 finger dragging, and then instead of clicking, just add 2 more fingers. It will essentially act as a click & hold but it won't pause.\n", "Q: Bootcamp partition migration On my old Macbook pro I had a Windows 7 64bit Bootcamp partition. When I got my new Macbook pro I transferred the Bootcamp partition to the new computer with Winclone. Now when I try to boot into Windows 7 it immediately goes to the BSOD. I can however boot into that partition just fine using VMWare Fusion. \nDoes anyone have any idea how to fix this? My only guess is that it's either a driver issue or perhaps has something to do with the fact that I got the new Mac with a SSD.\n\nA: This has nothing to do with the SSD, but rather the drivers.  Your new MBP has a completely different chipset and CPU, which prevents Win 7 from loading.  When installing Win 7, it makes a specific install for your specific hardware.  When you are dealing with a different chipset/CPU, those \"drivers\" if you will are so low-level that they cannot be updated/modified.\nYou can try booting into safe mode.  When your computer starts to boot into Win 7, hit F8 repeatedly.  If the Windows boot logo comes up, you have waited too long.  When you get to the menu, select Boot into Safe Mode from the list.  It might allow you to boot into Windows, but I'm guessing you will still get a blue screen.\nIf that is the case, the only way to fix it is to do a fresh install of Win 7.  Although you can try to boot from the Win 7 DVD and try a repair, in my experience, this will not work.\n\nA: I highly doubt you will be able to boot Windows 7 on the new machine in Boot Camp without doing some massive, massive troubleshooting and driver changes. I've tried many a time to do the same thing - move a Boot Camp partition to new machine and 100% it goes horribly. Windows makes its install specific to your hardware, unlike an OS X install, which can detect what hardware it's running on when you boot.\nBy far your best, easiest and fastest course of action is to reinstall Windows onto the new machine. Make sure you have your Windows product key handy, it's quite likely you may need to call Microsoft to get them to change the activation to the new machine (darned DRM schemes). \nYou can boot into VMWare because VMWare uses its own specific drivers, fired from the custom BIOS and other virtualization tricks it uses.\n\nA: The BSOD should might give you, or one of the readers of your question, an idea of what is going wrong.\nBefore you proceed further, you absolutely need to create a full backup of both the Mac and the Windows partitions.\nSince it is Windows 7 it might then be worth a try to boot from the Windows 7 DVD and see if it can repair it.\n", "Q: How do I use a keyboard shortcut to execute a shell script I wrote, passing the file selected in Finder as an arg? I suppose you could have it pass in whatever was selected in general in any app (such as text highlighted in a web browser).\n\nA: Use Automator. Generate a .app. A keyboard shortcut can launch the app, and Automator knows how to grab the Finder selections, which it can then pass to the shell script.\n\nA: The easiest way to do this, assuming you're using Snow Leopard, is to create an automator service and assign a keyboard shortcut to it using System Preferences.\nHere's a tutorial to get you started:\nhttp://www.pixelcorps.tv/macbreak235\n", "Q: Using a MacBook Air in the sun? Will using a MacBook Air out in the sun damage it at all? Will it affect any of the paint, the screen, distort the laptop's form, cause excessive heat, or cause any other damage?\n\nA: It's a good idea to keep the machine shaded, if only because it's very hard to read any screen in bright sunlight. Also, on my deck in  Carmel Valley California I've had a thermometer placed in direct sunlight read well over 100 deg F (37+ deg C) when the air temp has been around 80 deg F (26 deg C). Your Mac exposed in direct sunlight could well burst through Apple's upper limit even when the ambient temperature is below.\n\nA: It shouldn't. Apple's specs page says that you can use the computer in an environment between 50 and 95*F, and up to 90% relative humidity.\nAs we know, you have to be careful with how hot a MacBook Air gets anyway (it will always shut itself down before it becomes really damaged). But as for the paint, screen, form, etc., you should be fine as long as it's < 95* in the sun.\n", "Q: Time Capsule Interface List Per my other question on monitoring network throughput, I now have a series of graphs, some of which are distinctly non-obvious as to what they are.\nIs there documentation on what every interface on a Time Capsule (in this case, current generation, 1TB Wireless N Base Station), pollable via SNMP are?\nHere is the list that is available:\ngec0 \nath0\nath1\nwlan0\nwlan1\nwlan2\nwlan3\nvlan1\nrxq0\n\n\nA: gec0 and vlan1 are the most important for monitoring overall traffic flow. \ngec0 corresponds to the local traffic (behind the firewall) and vlan1 represents external traffic upstream to the internet. I haven't seen anything that makes sense what gec0 but on larger cisco switches they were internal routing queues where packets went to get headers constructed and routed across Vlans in the switching fabric. Perhaps it's the same on airport hardware.\nathX are wireless vlans\nwlanX are wired vlans\nApple used to publish MIBs for SNMP back when the first Airport Extremes were around but I don't know of anything better than using a generic MIB for the more recent hardware.\nThere used to be more information on these ports up at http://www.uname.nl/closer-look-airport-extreme/ but I can't find it anywhere (since archive.org respected it's robots.txt directive) - the best is a dated summary from http://gigo.com/archives/blog/monitoring-apples-80211n-airpo.html\n\nA: The wlan[0..3] ones are the wired Ethernet ports.\nath0 and ath1 are the wireless (2x antennas, this is an N model, isn't it?)\nvlan1 is a virtual LAN.  Lots of documentation around about those, just google it.\nNot sure about gec0 and rxq0.  One of those is the WAN port.

I found this like that explained them in better detail:\nhttp://www.staze.org/airport-extreme-dual-band-and-snmp/\n", "Q: Can I test iPhone apps downloaded from iTunes in the iPhone Simulator? Is it possible to test iPhone applications which you downloaded from iTunes Store in the iOS Simulator?\n\nA: Afraid not. The simulator runs on x86 architecture and the iPhone apps are published to run on ARM.\n\nA: That is not the intended purpose of the iPhone Simulator. The purpose of the iPhone Simulator is to give developers a convenient testing platform for the application they are developing in those cases where a physical iPhone isn't readily available. It is currently not possible to install applications compiled by other developers within your own iPhone Simulator.\nAs for testing apps, The App Store does not support demo versions of software or a way to \"try before you buy\" akin to shareware. The closest developers can get to that paradigm is by offering a \"lite\" version of their app for free and then a separate, full version for purchase.\n\nA: No.  \niPhone apps meant for an iOS device or App store are compiled by Xcode completely differently from the apps meant for the iOS Simulator (from the same source code, so this Simulator is only good for testing the source, not the App store binary).  Completely different and incompatible instruction sets, so no simple hack is possible.\nAdded:\nIn addition, apps downloaded from the App store are partially encrypted, so that only an actual device can see the all executable code at all.\n", "Q: Lost iPhone, what action to take? Suppose you lost your iPhone or it was stolen and with your MobileMe subscription you have the choice of tracking it, locking it, displaying a message or remote wiping the phone. What would you do and in which order to maximize your chances to get it back?\n\nA: No need to suppose, that just happend to me (somewhat).\nPreventive measures\nAs of today, suppose you have an iPhone 4, iPad or new iPod Touch running iOS 4 and you had previously activated the free MobileMe \"lost my iphone\". Then you're in the best situation of all. Suppose you don't have any of the new iDevices, but still are on iOS 4 and want to activate it for free. There are ways around that, for now, if you can borrow a new iDevice.\nAll you got to do in that situation is go to the website and get the measures of your choice. It will depend on how you lost the phone. If you know it was stolen, lock it first; don't display any message and track it down. Wiping is always the last resource, unless you're paranoid about leaking data. Be aware you will lose the ability to use everything else - it will reset to factory defaults. If you just forgot it somewhere, send an SMS first - maybe you'll get lucky.\nThere are also many tools on Cydia store to locate an iPhone - lost or not. I personally use and enjoy Longitude. It's, by far, the cheapest one and does the very basic stuff - send location to Google Latitude within a time interval you set. Enough for me.\nBut all that will only work for a couple of days at most. After all, iPhone battery doesn't last too long with 3G enabled. And, of course, only if it's turned on.\nTaken by surprise methods\nYou may have not prepared yourself for the worst. Or you may have done it, but found out about your lost iPhone too late and it's now turned off, battery dead or being re-sold in the black market after being wiped already.\nThere are 2 additional steps to do. Both include reporting it lost or stolen to the carrier. If you just ask for a phone lock, you can save yourself from a big bill made by someone ill intentioned calling to China. That's the SIM lock and it can be undone later at any time.\nNow suppose you didn't have a passcode lock on the phone and have no MobileMe. Then all your data is available to the finder / thief of the iPhone. That can concern a lot of people.\nThere comes the last measure - disable the phone through the IMEI. On most phones you need to have written down the IMEI before it got lost. It may be on the manual, box or some place else. On iPhone, tho, that information is on iTunes and easy to find.\nMake a police report on lost / stolen, get the IMEI, call the carrier and the phone should become useless. Supposedly, nobody will ever be able to use it as a phone again - not even you. My carrier promised me the phone doesn't even turn on anymore. While that's probably not true, at least your data will be supposedly wiped. (disclaimer: I'm still trying to verify all those suppositions)\nIf the thief wipes the phone (by reinstalling the iOS) you won't be able to track it through iCloud / find my phone / or any other tracking app, but the IMEI block is still worth doing. More and more carriers are starting to enforce the IMEI blocks on stolen phones unless the person with the phone goes back and argues to get it lifted. I don't know what would happen then, but I would suppose unless the person had a sales receipt, the carrier wouldn't serve that device after it being reported stolen.\n\nA: First of all I would go onto the Find my iPhone site and let my iPhone be located, if it looks like its in the same area as me I would play the noise to see if I could find it. If it was somewhere I've been recently - ie where I lost it I'd lock the device, then play the noise & put a message on the screen, if it's somewhere I've not been (ie someone has taken it) I'd lock the device then display the message, if I didn't have a response within an hour then I'd wipe it.\n", "Q: How can I mirror the display from an iOS device to an Apple TV? Is there a way to mirror the display of an iPod Touch or iPad to the Apple TV using AirPlay?\nI know I can do it for Applications that support it, but for presentations it's often useful to just mirror the whole display, e.g. when wanting to show something in Safari.\n\nA: If you have an iPad 2 and a iOS developer's account (or patience until this fall) you can try the hot new iOS 5 feature:\nAirPlay Mirroring for iPad 2\n\nA: If you're OK with a wired solution that doesn't use AirPlay, you'd be best off just connecting the device to the TV itself (not the Apple box). Cables/adapters for that (I haven't tested any of these):\niPad/iPhone/iPod Touch 4G       ==>    HDMI\niPad/iPhone 4/iPod Touch 4G    ==>    VGA\niPad/iPod Touch/iPhone/iPod    ==>    Component/RCA\n\nA: On the same line of a wired solution, not airplay, there is an app available in cydia if you are jailbroken called TVOut2 Mirror that works good.\nhttp://tvout2.webs.com/\n", "Q: Deleting photos from an iPhone Is there a tweak that lets me delete any photos from my iPhone - including the ones uploaded with iTunes?\n\nA: You can definitely do it on the phone, but if you have a lot of photos, that could take a while.\nAssuming you are on a Mac...\nConnect your iPhone to your Mac and open Image Capture (in your Applications folder). Click on the iPhone in the device list and it will start building a list of all of your photos. Once it's done, you can select the photos you want to delete (Cmd-A to select all) and then click the delete button at the bottom of the window (looks like a red circle with a slash through it).\n\nA: If you don't care about the other data on your phone, you could erase the phone's data (including the pictures in those albums) by going to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. Warning: all your data will be lost.\nA friend of mine actually had the exact same problem a few weeks ago and ended up using this method.\n\nA: When you are in the Photos app, simply press anywhere in the image you are viewing, and the toolbars will appear. On the far right of the bottom toolbar, there is a trash can icon. Simply press that, confirm you wish to delete the photo, and that's it. If photos keep coming back that you have deleted, then be sure you are not syncing an album that replaces those images.\n\nA: Without using a computer, you have basically 3 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*wipe your phone (as others have pointed).\n\n*get an app that sync your stuff, such as \"Picture Safe\" or iFiles. it will require preparation, the photos must be added to the app rather than syncing on iTunes.\n\n*jailbreak. then you'll at least be able to delete all the synced photos only. one way is trough iFile. go to /private/var/mobile/Media/Photos/ and delete it. The synced photos are in there but all \"encoded\" into databases, unlike the photos taken by the phone. There are ways to decode them, but I don't know of any on the iPhone.\n", "Q: How do I change a calendar's color in iOS 4.2.1? This is very similar to this question however the only problem is that I'm running solely Windows OS on my PC.  I also only sync with google calendars and that's all.  However, it appears the sync doesn't match the calendar colors.  Is there anyway to synchronize or directly change colors on the iPod/iPhone?\n\nA: A partial-workaround is suggested on this Google thread:\n\nThere is a workaround that solved the problem for me.\nThe iPhone assigns calendar colours in\n  this order: red, orange, blue, green,\n  purple (then repeats that cycle). So\n  the first step is to switch off\n  Exchange syncing for Calendars in the\n  iPhone settings then go into the\n  m.google.com/sync web app and just\n  enable one of your calendars. Then\n  re-enable Exchange syncing. Now you'd\n  think it would colour that first one\n  red and it may do in your case but for\n  me it coloured the first calendar\n  orange, possibly because I had some\n  other local calendars already on the\n  iPhone.\nIf it colours your chosen calendar\n  with a colour you were not expecting,\n  just start again (disable\n  Exchange/change sync settings and\n  re-enable) and take whatever colour it\n  chose as the starting point in that\n  cycle above. Once you've got the first\n  calendar/colour combination working as\n  you like, go back into\n  m.google.com/sync and select the\n  calendar you want to go with the next\n  colour in the cycle. Wait a few\n  minutes. Check that it's showing up as\n  expected in the calendar app. And then\n  go back to m.google.com/sync and\n  repeat. If you take this one calendar\n  at a time approach, you can assign\n  colours as you want them, except of\n  course you will face problems if you\n  have say three green calendars and no\n  purple ones...\n\n\nA: I just opened calendars in google on my laptop. Changed the colour of it there. Then just clicked the sync button on my iPod in the list of calendars. The colours and name changes just synced. I have iOS 5.1\n", "Q: iPod lyrics hiding things in <> ... workaround? I bought a CD, ripped it and copied it to my iPod Touch.  Then I found the lyrics on the internet, confirmed that they're the same as in the album booklet, and pasted them into the lyrics section in iTunes.\nEverything's great, except for one track.  It's a collaboration, and in the lyrics, before each section, it says who's doing that part by putting their name in <>.  For one artist, it looked fine, but for the other, the line was blank!\nWhat gives?  And what workaround is there to make both artists names appear?\n\nA: After a bit of experimentation, I found a workaround.  The artist whose name wasn't appearing has a name that starts with an ASCII character.  It looks like iOS is trying to be clever, and ignoring anything that looks like it might be an HTML tag, even if it really isn't!\nOne simple workaround is to put a zero-width space (you can copy/paste one from that article) right after the <.  Your iPod will no longer assume it's HTML, and it will display just fine!\n", "Q: What's in the \"Other\" category on my iPad? When I sync my iPad, iTunes tells me that Video accounts for so many gigabytes of space, Photos another portion, etc. etc.  But iTunes also tells me that a whopping 5.5 GB is being used by \"Other\".  What could this possibly be?  If it's not video, audio, photos, apps, or books, what's left taking up that amount of space?  I don't have that many contacts...\nOf course, you don't know specifically what is and isn't on my iPad.  But any thoughts as to what this could be?  I'd like to reclaim some of that space if I can.\n\nA: The stuff in the Other category is typically documents that have been deleted on the iPad, and also documents that are in use by various apps (for example, PDF documents that are in use by GoodReader, or docs from the iWork programs). Sometimes these documents are available via the Apps tab in iTunes, other times not; it depends on the program. For example, Documents to Go and GoodReader can manage their own documents outside of iTunes using Dropbox.\nDeleted documents should be cleared out when you sync with iTunes. Sometimes, due to a known iTunes bug, the Other category won't shrink as expected.\nThere's more at these Apple Discussions threads:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=12908823\n\n*http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2715603\n\nA: Well when I normally have that on my iPad it's just items I've put on it while I've had it attached to my computer as usb device, that means it's just like a usb drive where you can put folders (in my case backups) and stuff on.\nIt will normally show up in your explorer or on a mac in your devices list.\nMaybe you should check there?\n\nA: I just had the same issue....and per one of the answers above, deleted iBooks so they wouldn't sync but it didn't help. But then I scrolled down further and noticed \"audio books\" were checked. I unchecked that box and instantly my \"other\" went from 12.4 GB down to a trace.  \nSo, many thanks for the lead!\n\nA: iBooks are counted as \"other\" storage.\nMy wife had over 27 GB of \"other\" space taken up on her iPad.  I randomly decided to open up her iBooks app and upon deleting all of the books in that app, her \"other\" category dropped from 27 GB to virtually nothing.\n", "Q: What's the best way to test the battery life on a MacBook Air? I just recently got a MacBook Air and noticed that its battery life is much lower than Apple's estimate of 7 hours.\nSince it is not the same, I would like to benchmark my battery life right now (while the battery is fairly new) so that in the future when the battery feels like it isn't holding as much charge, I can know if it's due to the battery life diminishing, or if it's simply my perception that the battery is not holding as much as it used to.\nFor example, say I find out that my MacBook Air only holds 5 hours of battery life today. A year later, I may notice that the battery isn't holding as much power, and decide I want to benchmark it. I test it again, and find out that its still holding 5 hours of battery (it just seemed like it was holding less). So while it's less than the 7 hours promised by Apple, my battery hasn't actually degraded at all, since it matches the same benchmark I used before. Thus, there is no point of replacing its batteries.\nI have several programs running in the background (BetterTouchTool, KeyRemap4MacBook, DropBox, iAntiVirus), which I expect to be running throughout my MacBooks life. Do you think that when performing these battery benchmarks I should quit these applications or leave them running? My guess is that I should quit as many applications as possible to reduce the chance that one of them won't behave exactly the same between benchmarks.\nIdeally I want the benchmark to not last a long time so that I don't waste time benchmarking, however, at the same time, I don't want to overheat the battery which could cause permanent damage.\nIdeally the benchmark should not require me to be present at the computer and use it constantly (this would mean that I would need to temporarily disable the sleep timers), since then it wouldn't actually reflect a reproducible benchmark (e.g. if I need to use Facebook for 5 hours constantly during each benchmark, its VERY unlikely that I will do the exact same thing during both benchmarks... not to mention that Facebook's code a year later may be less or more efficient, causing more or less battery usage). Thus, I'm thinking an automated program which keeps using the battery at a consistent rate would be the best tool for the job.\nAlso, how would I know how long the battery lasted? I don't want to sit near the computer and constantly monitor if it's still on or not. I want to be able to set it and forget it. Then after recharging it, it will inform me of how long the battery lasted.\nDo you have any suggestions for things that might help perform these kind of benchmarks?\n\nA: Actually, an Apple battery gives you the percentage of its original capacity that it currently has. You can access that number through the free CoconutBattery app.\nIf you want to do your own benchmark, I recommend using BOINC and supporting a grid computing project, like SETI@home. These basically use 100% of your CPU from the moment you turn the program on until the moment you turn it off. This drains the battery pretty quick. Just be careful to check temperatures to make sure the computer doesn't overheat, especially with a MacBook Air. You probably should quit extra apps, but it shouldn't matter too much.\n\nA: I just found out that there's a related feature in OS X called \"Battery conditions\".\nIt's supposed to let you know when your battery is no longer holding as much charge is it originally could. You can access the feature by ⌥-clicking on the battery icon in the menu bar.\n\nA: You can also check out Watts which will help you calibrate your battery.\nBattery Health monitor could also help you.\nLet me know how it's going on!\n\nA: Rob Griffiths (@rgriff on Twitter) just tested the battery life of his 11\" Air. He'd be a good person to ask about testing yours.\n\nA: Please feel free to downvote my answer because I'm not really answering the question.  I guess a mod could just delete this.\nInstead, I have an axe to grid with Apple's battery life claims.  Their seven hour claim is based on a default install of Max OS X on your MBA and a single instance of Safari browsing the internet over WiFi, looking at web pages that are mostly text (read few images and NO FLASH!).\nWho does that?  Who cares?  If you do that, you're battery will last a long time...\n<over-the-top-rant>\nThis is similar to car manufacturer MPG ratings, fast food \"restaurant\" pictures of their products and walkie-talkie range claims.  That is, in PERFECT conditions, things are awesome!  Otherwise, caveat emptor.\n</over-the-top-rant>\nTo try to avoid downvotes/deletion (too late), I'll say that I can't really recommend a good way to establish a baseline battery life that is a repeatable test to determine battery wear and tear, but I'll tell you that I use iStat Menus to track my battery life and it does a good job tracking battery life, remaining time until discharge, remaining time until fully charged and tracking remaining battery health (among other things).\nYou might check it out: http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/\nGood luck and sorry for the rant :-)\n\n", "Q: Binding a keyboard shortcut to shut down I want to bind a gesture in BetterTouchTool to the shut down menu that is invoked by pressing the power button on my MacBook Air.\nIt's fairly simple to bind gestures to keyboard shortcuts, so what I'm really looking for is a way to bind a keyboard shortcut to the shut down menu. You can't use the power button in BetterTouchTool, so I need to bind it to a standard keyboard shortcut such as Command+Shift+S.\n\nA: You don't need to map the power button, that menu is already mapped to control+eject\n\nOther useful shutdown/restart/logoff key mappings are below which might be of interest too  \nPrompt to save work and restart the Mac - Control+Command+Eject \nPrompt to save work and shutdown the Mac - Control+Option+Command+Eject \nSleep - Command+Option+Eject \nSleep displays - Shift+Control+Eject \nIf the computer isn't responding and you need to force it to power off, you can hold down the power button for 6 seconds, you'll lose unsaved work though.  \nThese power shortcuts are listed on the apple support pages\n\nA: Command Shift / will trigger the help menu. Press -> to get to the shutdown menu. Then you can scroll up to the shutdown option. Done.\n\nA: While @Griffo's suggestion is useful, unfortunately the eject button cannot be used in BetterTouchTool.\nIn order to get it to work with BetterTouchTool, I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Created a new shortcut in System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts for All Applications with the menu title Shut Down... and I chose my own keyboard shortcut.\n\n*I then bound a shortcut key in BetterTouchTool to this new keyboard shortcut.\n\n\nIt works as expected. The only drawback is that there are now two Shut Down options in the menu: Shut Down and Shut Down... It's a minor annoyance which I'm not sure how to fix.\n", "Q: Replace Finder with Forklift Is possible to have Forklift open folders, paths, etc instead of Finder?\n\nA: Discussion here on replacing Finder with nautilus.\nYou can add a Quit menu item to Finder and quit it like so:\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder QuitMenuItem 1; killall Finder\n\nNow, run ForkLift.\nYou could try (WARNING: DANGEROUS) to rename ForkLift2.app as Finder.app and replace Finder.app, but I think this would probably just cause problems, possibly severe ones.\nWhat do you mean by \"open folders, paths, etc.\"? Almost all Finder interactions on my computer are initiated by me. Just use ForkLift instead. The only time something else uses Finder is if I double-click on a DMG, then it opens in Finder. If you have this, or other specific use cases that you would like to have interact with ForkLift, please clarify or post additional specific questions.\n\nA: Add these to your ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist\n{   LSHandlerContentType = \"public.folder\";\n    LSHandlerRoleAll = \"com.binarynights.ForkLift-3\";\n}\n\nThen reboot.\nBTW, this answer to Set ForkLift as default file viewer may also work.\n\nA: The official site now suggests:\ndefaults write -g NSFileViewer -string com.binarynights.ForkLift-3;\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure LSHandlers -array-add '{LSHandlerContentType=\"public.folder\";LSHandlerRoleAll=\"com.binarynights.ForkLift-3\";}'\n\nWhile for the SetApp version:\ndefaults write -g NSFileViewer -string com.binarynights.forklift-setapp;\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure LSHandlers -array-add '{LSHandlerContentType=\"public.folder\";LSHandlerRoleAll=\"com.binarynights.forklift-setapp\";}'\n\n\nA: You can change default file manager like this, but ForkLift or Transmit not work as expected, only Path Finder are\n#!/usr/bin/python2.6\n\nfrom LaunchServices import LSSetDefaultRoleHandlerForContentType, kLSRolesViewer, LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme\nfrom CoreFoundation import CFPreferencesCopyApplicationList, kCFPreferencesCurrentUser, kCFPreferencesAnyHost, CFPreferencesSetAppValue, CFPreferencesAppSynchronize\n\napplicationBundleIdentifier = \"com.cocoatech.PathFinder\" #\"com.panic.Transmit\" #\"com.binarynights.forklift2\"\n\nLSSetDefaultRoleHandlerForContentType(\"public.folder\", kLSRolesViewer, applicationBundleIdentifier)\nLSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme(\"file:///\", applicationBundleIdentifier)\n\napplicationIDs = CFPreferencesCopyApplicationList(kCFPreferencesCurrentUser, kCFPreferencesAnyHost)\nfor app_id in applicationIDs:\n    CFPreferencesSetAppValue(\"NSFileViewer\", applicationBundleIdentifier, app_id);\n    CFPreferencesAppSynchronize(app_id);\n\n", "Q: Restoring mail from backup after hard disk died The hard disk on my iMac (Mac OS X 10.5.8) died, and after getting it replaced I have been trying to restore my files from backup.

We recently bought an iPhone 3GS for my stepson. He has my old iMac G5, running OS X 10.4.11 (Tiger), and iTunes 9.2.1.\nWhen we connect the iPhone to this computer, we get an error window saying \"The iPhone cannot be used because it requires iTunes version 10.1 or later. Go to www.itunes.com to download the latest version of iTunes.\"\nHowever, the iTunes download page says that iTunes 10.1.2 requires OS X 10.5 or later, and indeed, trying to download and install that version results in an error window saying \"This package type requires Mac OS X 10.5.\"\nSo, is there any way to get a version of iTunes that supports the iPhone 3GS and runs on OS X 10.4.x?\nIf not, would upgrading the iMac to Leopard solve the problem?\n(This is all a bit surprising, because iTunes 9.2.1 worked fine with an older iPhone and with an iPod Touch. It's hard for me to imagine what new magic in 10.5 is required to support syncing with a slightly newer model of iPhone.)\n\nA: Yes, upgrading the Mac to Leopard will work. \nEach new iDevice has certain identifiers (model number, etc.). When Apple releases a new one, the old version of iTunes would need an update to recognize it. (Sometimes this even happens with new device OS/firmware versions.) They bundle these updates with feature and bugfix updates, so you're stuck with a new version.\n", "Q: Have recent updates caused the iPad battery to not last as long?

Backups to a Time Capsule are stored in a disk image\nin sparse bundle format, you will need to have software that knows how to mount those bundles.\nEither requires your non-Mac system to be able to read HFS+ volumes - but once over that hurdle, you can simply navigate the Backups.backupdb folder and extract whatever files you need. The folder structure is simply organized by the time the backup completed.\n\nA: It's barely a format at all. Time Machine just keeps multiple directories, each containing complete copies of your filesystem, using hard links to prevent storing unchanged files multiple times. You can get the files off just by copying them out of the correct directory. The only requirement is that if you're mounting the disk locally, your machine has to be able to mount a HFS+ filesystem.\n", "Q: Script that outputs number of emails in Mail.app inbox  I'd like to have a command-line script I can invoke at the Terminal that will output the total number of messages in my \"Work\" Inbox in mail.app. Usage would look like this:\n$ inbox-count\n48\n\nWhat does the Applescript code look like to do something like this?\n\nA: If you want to get the number of messages in said inbox, the short form of the code is\ntell application \"Mail\" to ¬\n  get the count of messages of mailbox \"INBOX\" of account \"Work\"\n\nIf you want the global inbox, then you can use get the count of messages of inbox instead.  If you just want unread messages, then you can use get the unread count of mailbox \"INBOX\" of account \"Work\".\nAnd if you want a more complete script, this will do the trick:\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\nproperty defaultAccount : \"Work\"\nproperty defaultMailbox : \"INBOX\"\n\non run args\n  set justUnread to false\n  set theAccount to missing value\n  set theMailbox to missing value\n\n  if defaultAccount = missing value then set defaultAccount to \"-g\"\n  if defaultMailbox = missing value then set defaultMailbox to \"INBOX\"\n\n  set theCount to the count of args\n\n  if theCount > 0 then\n    if item 1 of args = \"-u\" then\n      set justUnread to true\n      set theCount to theCount - 1\n      set args to the rest of args\n    else if item 1 of args = \"-ug\" or item 1 of args = \"-gu\" then\n      set justUnread to true\n      set item 1 of args to \"-g\"\n    else if theCount > 1 and ¬\n            item 1 of args = \"-g\" and item 2 of args = \"-u\" then\n      set justUnread to true\n      set theCount to theCount - 1\n      set args to the rest of args\n      set item 1 of args to \"-g\"\n    end if\n  end if\n\n  tell application \"Mail\"\n    if theCount = 0 then\n      set theAccount to defaultAccount\n      set theMailbox to defaultMailbox\n    else if theCount = 1 then\n      set theAccount to item 1 of args\n      set theMailbox to defaultMailbox\n    else if theCount = 2 then\n      set theAccount to item 1 of args\n      set theMailbox to item 2 of args\n    else\n      error character id 10 ¬\n          & \"Usage: inbox-count [-u] [[account] mailbox]\" & character id 10 ¬\n          & \"       inbox-count [-u] -g [mailbox]\"\n    end if\n\n    set mailboxValue to missing value\n    if theAccount = \"-g\" then\n      if theMailbox = \"INBOX\" then\n        set mailboxValue to inbox\n      else\n        set mailboxValue to mailbox theMailbox\n      end if\n    else\n      set mailboxValue to mailbox theMailbox of account theAccount\n    end if\n\n    if justUnread then\n      return the unread count of mailboxValue\n    else\n      return the count of messages of mailboxValue\n    end if\n  end tell\nend run\n\nMost of that is command-line parsing, because that's a pain to get right in AppleScript.  But the upshot is that with that script in your path as inbox-count, then the following commands work:\n\n\n*\n\n*inbox-count to check the number of messages in the default mailbox/account pair.\n\n*inbox-count -g to check the number of messages in the global (combined) inbox.\n\n*inbox-count Play to check the number of messages in the default mailbox for the account \"Play\".\n\n*inbox-count -g Important to check the number of messages in the global mailbox \"Important\".\n\n*inbox-count Play Facebook to check the number of messages in the mailbox \"Facebook\" for the account \"Play\".\n\n\nYou can also prepend a -u to any of those commands (e.g., inbox-count -u, inbox-count -ug, inbox-count -u Play Facebook) to just get the unread count.  To change the default account and mailbox, change the lines property defaultAccount : \"Work\" and property defaultMailbox : \"INBOX\".  If defaultAccount is missing value or \"-g\", then the default will be to not use an account; if defaultMailbox is missing value or \"INBOX\", then the default will be to either use a mailbox named \"INBOX\" or, if the account is \"-g\", to use the global inbox.\n", "Q: Leopard Mail app keyboard shortcut I've recently switched to Chrome for developing and have thus started using the build-in Developer Tools instead of my previously preferred Firebug workflow. Just today I found a keyboard shortcut (Command-Shift-I) that jumps straight to Inspect Element rather than just opening the Developer Tools like Command-Option-I does.\nThe problem I'm having is that this shortcut also opens the Mail app, which I do not use. I've looked in the Keyboard Shortcuts preferences and I don't see the aforementioned shortcut anywhere.

By now I want to have common albums with my mother and myself.\nIs there anything to do this automatically via Internet or local network?\n\nA: Is it possible that iPhoto Library Manager might be of any use for you in that situation? It’s not free and I don’t have any personal experiences with this software but from what I’ve read it seems to work.\nHope it helps.\nGood luck.\n\nA: What do you mean by \"Sync\".\n \nThe general term means when two Libraries (A and B) are compared and files in Library A are copied to Library B, while files in Library B are also copied to Library A so that both Libraries are identical.\n \nThis is bi-directional copying and you cannot do this automatically with iPhoto. No Syncing software is capable of parsing the iPhoto Library in this manner. One or both of your Libraries will be damaged if you try this.\n \nYou can have uni-directional copying - files in Library A are copied to Library B - this is essentially backing up. Obviously you can also copy from Library B to Library A.\n \nThe nearest you can get to syncing is to use iPhoto Library Manager to move files/Albums/Events plus associated metadata between Libraries. This process cannot be automated. \n", "Q: Is there a Terminal command that will force open the DVD tray? Is there a command I can enter in Terminal that will force eject a CD or DVD? One that will always work, equivalent to a \"Force Quit\" for an app?\nI have an intermittent problem getting the DVD in my Mac Pro to eject. Right now the only solution is to do a full restart, but that is obviously not always convenient. I'm hoping there is a workaround to this through the magical power of UNIX...\n\nA: First of all, try the \"nice\" way using the drive utility\ndrutil tray eject\n\nIf this doesn´t work (probably because the system can´t unmount the volume), the following command will forcefully unmount the Volume with name \"untitled\" (make sure you´re using the right mountpoint!!):\nhdiutil detach -force /Volumes/untitled\n\n", "Q: How to point an Apple TV to an iTunes Library on a NAS? I have my Apple TV linked to my iTunes library stored on a network storage device by linking to my laptop. I would like to point my Apple TV directly to the iTunes library on the storage device without linking through the laptop. Is there an easy way to do this?\n\nA: (Assuming you have an Apple TV 2…) You can't do it without jailbreaking.\nOnce you do that, you just need to run Plex or XBMC. I only have experience with the former, but we're very happy with the results.\n\nA: This cannot be done with a standard AppleTV.  It may be possible with a jailbroken Apple TV or if you put something like XBMC onto it.\n", "Q: MBP not booting, but HD seems fine My late 2009 unibody MBP won't boot.

It never goes into standby mode unless I turn on flight mode. \nWhen I have phone mode on it will keep on running something in the background. I haven't been able to locate what it is. I have tried to close down all the apps which are in the quick access list. I have also turned of the Location Service, Notification, Push. I have practically tried to turn of everything, and nothing help except for if I turn on the flight mode.\nAnyone know what the problem might be? This problem is seriously causing the battery to burn down.\nUPDATE: ok it seems a simple reset to factory setting fixed it and returned it back to normal. Probably some bug in the iphone tick off when I updated to the latest iOS. Thus made iphone never truely go into standby mode.\n\nA: Have you tried Settings > General > Auto Lock?\nNow that you've clarified the question:\nThe reason why I asked if you were in an area of bad coverage/weak signal is if your signal is weak then your battery will drain quicker.  However most people I know with iPhones would only get 24 hours out of a full charge anyway.  I usually plug it in at night and unplug it when I get up in the morning and generally it will last all day.  If you find your battery is draining too quickly for your liking you can do some of the following.  \nTurn off push notifications\nLower screen brightness\nTurn off WiFi\nTurn off 3G\nClose apps which are running in the background  \nI'm guessing you haven't had a smartphone before and are used to getting a few days from a full charge.  Smartphones use battery much more quickly than traditional cell phones because of larger screens, more powerful processors and generally more usage.\n\nA: I too have this problem. For me, the solution is to turn off and turn on the iPhone, and everything is again ok.\n\nA: This is probably because of your cell connection. The carrier probably tries to keep a connection alive, even while the phone is not in use. This is to ensure that when a call or SMS comes in, the phone will notify you about it. The battery will probably drain faster if the signal is weaker. Another process that may actively be running is the visual voice mail, which probably checks the carrier's servers for voicemail periodically as well.\nThe only way to stop these three services (phone, sms, voicemail), is to enter airplane mode. This is probably why you see an increase in battery life when airplane mode is on.\n", "Q: Selecting a minimized window in Expose via the trackpad two finger swipe gesture Normally when you invoke expose, you can use the trackpad's two finger swipe gestures (up, down, left, and right) to highlight a window so that it has a blue border around it. You can then select the window by tapping your third finger down. I really like this method, since it is much quicker than moving the cursor over the window you want and tapping it.\nThe problem I have noticed is that when you have a minimized window, it will appear below all the other non-minimized windows, separated by a horizontal line. Depending on where the cursor is located (above or below this line) the two finger swipe gesture will only highlight windows within that section (e.g. if you are below the line, you can only highlight minimized windows). Moving the mouse above or below the line will allow you to highlight the corresponding windows.\nIs there any way to highlight a window in the opposite section the cursor is located in, without needing to move the cursor?\nFor example, I want to be able to invoke expose and no matter where my cursor is, I want to be able to select any window I want, using only the two finger swipe gesture.\n\nA: Not possible via the trackpad as far as I can tell.  You can use the arrow keys though.\n", "Q: What iPhone apps are available for sending bulk SMSs? What iPhone apps can I use for sending bulk SMSs?\nHopefully something very simple to get started with....\n\nA: Built-in Group Messaging\nOn any iPhone with iOS 4 you can enable group messaging which will allow you to message a group and for responses to be sent to the whole group:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings\n\n*Tap Messages.\n\n*Finally, flip the Group Messaging slider to On.\n\n\nOther soltions include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mass Text Message\n\n*Beluga\n\n*textPlus\n\nA: MassTextMsg app in the app store.   The only one I found that is simple, pulls your contacts from you address book, and doesn't force you to sign-up for an account or a different phone number.\n", "Q: What are the available stylus pens for iPad? Am looking for a good quality stylus primarily to be used for note-taking apps.\n\nA: If you want cheap, there's a youtube video on making your own stylus from the thin metallic-coated wrapper from a powerbar.  \nI cleaned up and cut out a narrow strip of the stuff, looped it over the tip of a comfortable but dried-out rollerball pen, and it seemed to work as well as the expensive foam tip stylus for which I paid $15.\nAdded: Here's the Walt MossPuppet video.\n\nA: I like and use the BoxWave stylus.\n\nA: wired.com reviewed the Alupen recently:\n\nThe weight is good. An aluminum tube would be too light and cause cramp. Like a fountain pen, the Alupen presses itself down for you. At first look, the pen seems to be too short for comfort, like one of those free pencils at Ikea. In use, it is actually long enough (and I have big hands).\nIn fact, the only fault I can find is that the metal pen gets icy cold when left on my desk. But then, my desk is marble, and my apartment has no heating, so it could be that.\n$20 may be too rich for some, although a good fountain pen is much more, and with a stylus you never need to buy any ink. Available now, in silver and a range of anodized candy-coatings.\n\n\nA: Griffin Technologies makes a pretty good Stylus as does TenOneDesign, the Pogo Sketch. I have the Griffin stylus and really like using it. The all metal, except for the tip, construction feels good to use and the clip holds the stylus nicely in a pocket or on a case. The Pogo Sketch runs $15 and the Griffin Stylus runs $20. You can pick up the Griffin at most Best Buys. \n\nA: The Hand stylus is another option you can consider. Same size as an average pen, and has a retractable/replaceable nib. What's more, each time the nib is retracted, it's rotated so that you never end up using the same side of the nib twice (in a row).\nThough I suppose you could just rotate the entire stylus to get the same effect, it's a thoughtful feature to include.\n", "Q: I just upgrade my iPhone to iOS 4.2. Where did all my email go? I just upgraded my iPhone 3G from iOS 3.1.3 to 4.2.1.\n\n\n*\n\n*Backed everything up (8 hours)\n\n*Downloaded the update (1 hour)\n\n*Installed the update, and restored everything (1 hour)\n\n\nEverything looks like it worked… EXCEPT that now, all my email is gone.\nI have three questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How could it restore all my contacts, settings, apps, all email settings, all email boxes, everything… and only skip my email?\n\n*Where did my email go?\n\n*How do I get my email back?\n\nA: Email is not included in the backups according to this apple support page.  This probably makes sense as you would normally have a copy on a server whereas with SMS, MMS etc you wouldn't necessarily have a copy on the server.  So the answer to where is your email gone is it gets wiped by the backup process.\nTo get your email back you should be able to just go into your email accounts and click the circular arrow button to refresh or if you're setup for push mail then it should sync automatically.  You can take a look in Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars for your mail accounts which should still be there.  If they're not syncing try turning the mail off and back on in one of the account setting screens.\n\nA: Unfortunately \"back up\" does not mean \"back up everything\".\n(You think it would... but it doesn't.  Not sure why Apple thinks you want to lose 1000s of emails... but you will.  Instantly and without any warning.)\nYour only choices are based on 2 things that its already too late for you to change:\nIf you \"kept email on server\"... you can have it resent to your phone.\n(Unfortunately, you will also get 1000s of email you do NOT want. Ugh.)\nIf you didn't \"keep email on server\"... you lost everything.\nKind of odd that \"backing up\" CAUSES you to have a massive data-loss.  But unfortunately, some non-thinking people at Apple do it that way.\nNot sure why \"back up my email\" would have been so impossible for Apple to do.  (Or at least give you the choice.  I'm pretty sure nearly everyone would say \"YES, KEEP MY EMAIL\".)\nOr, at least the back-up process should say in huge letters:  \"You are about to lose 100% of your email.\"  Before you start.  (No, you have to later read about it buried in the docs somewhere.)\nI would imagine if enough people contacted Apple about this \"feature\" they might do something about it.\n\nA: I had the same problem when i first upgraded from 3.1 to 4.0 -- my emails were gone.\nIn that case, it was a problem with the download of the .ipsw file from Apple. It seems that it is possible that the downloaded .ipsw file is corrupted (i'm not sure if there is anything that checks the integrity of the file, as happens with .zip for example).\nHere's how i fixed it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleted the .ipsw file from my\ncomputer (i think it should be\niPhone1,2_4.2.1_8C148_Restore.ipsw\nfor the 3G, but it should certainly\nbe something like that).  \n\n*Restored\nthe phone to my last 3.1.3 backup\n\n*Started the upgrade process again,\nwith iTunes downloading a fresh copy\nof the .ipsw file\n\n\nSome people recommend downloading the .ipsw file separately, and using that to upgrade, but i'd try the automatic iTunes route first.\nAfter i upgraded a second time, everything was where i expected it.\n", "Q: Can I turn off IPv4 and just use IPv6 on my Mac? Im really just curious to try IPv6 and see what happens. Is it possible to turn on IPv6 and to turn off IPv4 on my Mac?  If it is possible, how can I do it?\n\nA: I assume you're talking about on your Mac since you don't specify.  Yes you can do this but in all likelihood, you won't see much other than your internet connection probably won't work.  Most ISPs (Internet Service Providers) are not yet ready to handle IPv6 traffic and many won't be right up to IPv6 day on June 8th 2011.  Many won't be ready beyond then either.  But it won't do any harm to try it out if that's what you're worried about.  As an aside, the last batches of IPv4 addresses were distributed recently.\nTo turn IPv4 off go to System Preferences > Network > Advanced > TCPIP  \nThen on the drop-down list next to 'Configure IPv4' select the 'Off' Option.  Then beneath that, you can set the 'Configure IPv6' drop down menu to whatever you want.\n", "Q: Mac Pro in a hot country - bad idea? I'm about to buy a second Mac Pro - I have one in London where the temperature is pretty cool most of the time, but want to get another one for Spain where the temperature gets up to 51 degrees celcius outside sometimes.\nWhat it be a foolish thing to try and use a system that presumably would overheat pretty quickly in such a hot country? I've tried air conditioning, but that really doesn't bring the temperature down much when you're in that kind of heat. Plus it's VERY noisy with AC on and I'm a composer so need as much silence as possible for when I'm recording...\nThanks for any pointers - especially from people in hot countries!\n\nA: From Apple's Mac Pro Technical Specifications:\nElectrical and operating requirements:\nOperating temperature: 50° to 95° F (10° to 35° C)\nIf your indoor temperature reaches 51˚C, that probably spells bad news for microprocessors. You might be in for a very costly climate control system if you need an acoustically isolated space.\n\nA: It gets 120+°F here during the summer sometimes, which is approximately 50°C. In the shade it'll be approx. 10-20° cooler, and indoors approx. 78°F with A/C. \nThe A/C doesn't run full time, so if you were to turn off your A/C while recording then turn it back on periodically, you should be able to maintain a reasonable interior temperature, both for you and the computer without it impacting your recording.\nPlus, if you have good headphones, the only times you'd need to turn off the A/C is while using a microphone to record voices or acoustic instruments. Electric guitars and basses, amps, keyboards and synths should be going direct or be loud enough that ambient noise from the A/C shouldn't be a problem.\n\nA: I don't know the exact numbers, but the temperature in the shade in a ventilated area is significantly lower than the temperature in the sun.  I lived 20 years in Texas where temperatures would often be over 100°F during the summer.  Indoor temperatures were usually in the 80's.  For other desktops, I have \"fixed\" overheating by directing a fan directly inside the case, but the Mac Pro has very good ventilation, so opening the case would probably just make it worse.\nI doubt that there is any habitable place in the world where the indoor temperatures exceed 95°F, as I don't think humans could survive there.  \nAlso, I have left my MacBook in my car, where temperatures get up to 160°F.  It does shut down eventually, but the shutoff temperature is much higher than the officially rated one.\n", "Q: Is there a remote desktop solution that will transfer sound output to the client? I'm looking for a secure and hopefully free remote desktop client that will allow me to interact with my Mac OS X 10.6 machine from a 10.5 machine that will also transfer sound to the client.\nAt a minimum, the software must support a tunnelable connection.\nIf there is a vetted iPad app out there that will do it, that would work, too!\nAny suggestions? I found this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_remote_desktop_software but it's a little heavy and doesn't readily indicate community acceptance/worthiness.\n\nA: RogueAmoeba's AirFoil product may be helpful -- it allows you to send sound from any Mac or Windows machine (or any specific application on that machine) to one or more other Apple devices or Windows PCs on the same LAN.\nThe product has many features, e.g. a custom video player that ensures the sound your receive locally is in sync with any video you are viewing remotely.\nBecause AirFoil only streams audio, you can use it in conjunction with whatever remote desktop viewing solution works best for you.\n\nA: I immediately thought of something like soundflower, and their support page points to a project called jackaudio that may be able to send audio over a local network.  This is, admittedly, separate intended functionality from VNC or other screensharing utilities.  A smart guy I know refers to this as 'a wonderful third-party opportunity'.\niOS/Pad specific stuff would probably only focus on media, like AirView and StreamToMe. \n\nA: This may not fit your needs because I think this requires a person present on both ends, but what I figured out is the simplest free approach I know of: use SoundFlower (a free download from Cycling 74) to pipe your system audio to iChat, and use iChat to send the audio to another computer.\nIn your System Preferences go to Sound and set SoundFlower as both Input and Output. Note that this will make your system sound not go through your speakers, so to turn that back on also run SoundFlowerbed (the front end that comes with SoundFlower) and set SoundFlower's output to the speakers.\nNow launch iChat and go to Preferences. In the Video/Audio preferences you can set what input to use; it'll probably be defaulting to your microphone but you can set that to SoundFlower. Now when you do a voice chat with someone else they will hear your computer's audio.\nThat takes care of audio. For the video you can use either the screen-sharing functionality built into iChat or use Screen Sharing through System Preferences.\n\nA: Logmein Pro will do this.  Not free however.  It does use encrypted connections and also allows for file transfer.  There's an iPad app as well.  I think it exactly suits your needs as you've outlined them here.\n\nA: Both iRAPP and Aqua Connect Terminal Server can do this.  See my reply to this related question for more details and links to those two products. \n\nA: VNC and apple screen sharing do not support this, but RDS does. I got nuoRDS working as a server https://www.nuords.com/products/nuords/ and Microsoft Remote Desktop as a client. It only streams certain apps (system, finder, chrome, safari, simple applications) but their support helped me stream more complex apps (for music/audio with CoreAudio).\n\nA: I tried both Soundflower and Airfoil. \nI must admit Soundflower was a bit tricky to get going, but is free.\nAirfoil works perfectly first time and the price is a reasonable $25 (free trial available).\nThe Rogue Amoeba products are usually pretty solid.\n\nA: For the ones still reading this question:\nFinally found an easy solution for mac, which has a free plan as well!:\nhttps://www.remotepc.com/index.html\n(Be sure to first enable \"Enable remote sound\" on both (streamer and viewer) and set your playback device on the streamer (Settings -> Audio) to the RemotePC output device.\n", "Q: A better workflow for screen real estate than spaces? My impression of the general feeling toward spaces is that it's a good idea that doesn't work very well and so most people don't use it. I do use it and I can't imagine having all my windows open on one screen as being easier to navigate.\nI'm interested in any better workflows people have in play.\nMy primary machine is a 15\" MBP (no separate monitors), with a space each for mailplane, browsers, omnifocus, evernote, and two clear work spaces for whatever projects I am working on with relevant apps and windows within.\n\nA: Really, you can't beat two physical 1080 monitors and an extra, smaller (~1024x768) one (touchscreen a plus). This works best for headless machines, or machines with an integrated 1080 display. Here are example workflows for different scenarios (Big1=1080 main, Big2=1080 extra, Small1=small extra):\nCoder:\nBig1: The piece of code you're actively working on. Big2: The list of related files (like in XCode), and the interface design. Small1: Where the app's windows(s) go when you test it, unless it's big. Or music controls.\nWeb Developer\nBig1: Code. Big2: Browser preview. Small1: FTP client or ebooks or list of files or editor utility panels.\nPhoto Editing/Design\nBig1: Editing window (Ps controls, image, etc). Big2: List of photos w/ previews.\nBig 3: Original image or music controls or editor panels.\nStudent (the one I spend the most time in)\nBig1: Paper/essay on the left and outline on the right. Big2: Research websites, ebooks, works cited, etc (two open simultaneously works well). Small1: Music controls or assignment sheet/project requirements.\n\nA: A partial solution to overcome the lack of real screen estate: I often use cmd+tab to efficiently switch back and forth applications that I use concurrently. This doesn't require 'thinking', I rarely try to pick another app from the multitasking list other than the last used. \nI usually have all apps open and full screen (MBP high-res). Then if I need another app I fall back to Exposé (mapped to a screen corner).\n\nA: You need a bigger screen. Preferably, bigger screen*s*.\nThe other thing you might try is Divvy, which is a sort of tiling window manager thing for OS X. Sink some time into configuring it, and you'll it back hundreds of times over from time saved organizing stuff.\n\nA: When I first switched to Leopard I tried out spaces, both with and without an extra monitor, but I found that I just couldn't get along with it whatever I tried.\nMy current solution is to have spaces switched off, with one hot corner for Expose - all windows and another for show desktop. I also use the dock icons to show all the windows for that particular application and Opt-Tab to switch between applications, using all of these I find it is always easy to get the inforamtion I need on screen when I need it.\n\nA: I tend to use 4-6 Spaces. It sounds like you keep one app in each Space; I tend to use each one for one task or type of work. One of my goals is to remove distractions, so I also tend to have a \"dumping ground\" space for windows I want to go back to later but not be distracted by now. (Articles to read later, etc.)\nIn OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard I had the spaces laid out in a 2x3 grid so it was easier to remember which was which than with them in a 6x1 line in OS X 10.7 Lion. For recurring tasks, I always use the same space so things are consistently in the same place.\nI have keyboard shortcuts set up (in System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts) so that Ctrl+1 (or 2,3,4,5,6) takes me to a specific space.\nI also run the utility Witch to switch between windows. The Cmd+Tab behavior that's built into OS X switches between applications, which isn't helpful when some apps (like the web browser) have lots of windows open. Witch lets you switch between specific windows. I set it up to only list windows in the current space, because the windows belonging to my current focus task are normally all in the same space, and it keeps the list more manageable.\nIt helps to customize the \"assignment\" (or lack thereof) of apps to specific spaces--sometimes I do assign an app to keep the windows together, but mostly I set the assignment to \"None\" so that I can have windows anywhere and not get whip lashed to another space when I activate that app. (In OS X 10.7 Lion, this is done by right-clicking or control-clicking or two-finger-clicking on the app in the Dock and choosing Options > This Desktop or None. For (Snow)Leopard there are some hacks for this that you'll find if you search here.\n\nA: Check out http://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/01/17/being-productive-with-virtual-desktops/ (Disclaimer: My blog) I run desktops for current work, alternate work, email, social and out-of-the-way apps and automated the switches between them.\n\nA: When I first switched to Leopard I tried out spaces, both with and without an extra monitor, but I found that I just couldn't get along with it whatever I tried.My current solution is to have spaces switched off, with one hot corner for Expose - all windows and another for show desktop. I also use the dock icons to show all the windows for that particular application and Opt-Tab to switch between applications, using all of these I find it is always easy to get the inforamtion I need on screen when I need it.A partial solution to overcome the lack of real screen estate: I often use cmd+tab to efficiently switch back and forth applications that I use concurrently. This doesn't require 'thinking', I rarely try to pick another app from the multitasking list other than the last used.I usually have all apps open and full screen (MBP high-res). Then if I need another app I fall back to Exposé (mapped to a screen corner).The other thing you might try is Divvy, which is a sort of tiling window manager thing for OS X.

Yes, I know Acorn isn't Visio, but still let me ask the question: \nHow can you draw an arrow with Acorn? \nI am talking about the kind of arrows that Skitch or Jing would draw, and that you typically add to a screenshot to take the viewer's attention to part of the image.\n\n\nA: Acorn doesn't really have native support for complex shapes / arrows like Skitch does - however, you can make an arrow using the Bezier pen tool.  You'd select it from the vector tools palette, and click around until you got your arrow.  It'll be super annoying to rotate or resize however, and it probably won't look as good.\nAdding something like this has been on the todo list for a long long time, so hopefully it'll happen in a future release.\n-gus\n", "Q: Sort trash files by date trashed One of the nice features of the recycle bin in Windows is the ability to sort it by the date an item was deleted. This way if you accidentally delete something, you can easily find it because it will be at the top of the list.\nIs there any way to do something similar in Mac OS X's Trash folder?\nI see that there is a date modified field, but that is not updated when the file is deleted.\n\nA: This hint from Mac OS X Hints describes how to create a simple Automator Folder Action that performs touch on every file that's trashed.\n\nA: Update for OSX 10.9 Mavericks:\nIt appears that you can now sort by Date Added in OSX Mavericks. In Trash right click one of the columns and click to check the Date Added column.

I do not have a right click option on any of my Mac devices, but was able to do this:\n    With Trash folder open, use CTRL + click on a column head. Then choose Date Added from the drop-down menu. Worked perfectly for me, and I hope it works for you. Should be a default column if you ask me!\n", "Q: How can I copy files from my Mac to PC via Microsoft Remote Desktop? I installed Microsoft's Remote Desktop and connected to a PC. How can I share files between my Mac and PC?\nWhen I use RDP on Windows, I can simply add a file to the clipboard and paste it inside the RDP window. The same thing doesn't seem to work in the mac version of RDP.\nIf I try to share one of my Mac's folders with the RDP computer, and then double click that drive in RDP it says:\n\n\\\\tsclient\\Downlo1 is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions.\nAccess is denied.\n\n\nA: Clipboard RDC is a free open source cross platform utility that uses clipboard to transfer files much like we transfer text to/from servers in RDP.\nNote, requires Java. \nDisclaimer: I am the author\n\nA: Another possibility is to use a dropbox (et.al.) account.  Just log into the same one from both the Mac and the PC.\n\nA: Good news, copy and paste seems to work now (and for single files even)!  But drag and drop does not seem to.  At all.\ncopy and paste:\ncopy (command + c) in OS X Finder, then open an explorer window in rdp and \"ctrl+v\" in windows\n\nA: I ran into the same issue but I was able to paste to \\\\tsclient\\OSX\\Users\\Shared\n\nA: When copying files from Mac to PC using Microsoft Remote Desktop I prefer to share a subfolder, not the entire drive.\nHere's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Remote Desktop on your Mac select your PC in the \"My Desktops\" section. \n\n*Click the \"Edit\" button (pencil icon).\n\n*In the popup click the \"Redirection\" button (folder icon; see image below).\n\n*Check the \"Enable folder redirection\" box.\n\n*Click the \"+\" button at the bottom of that window and browse to the Mac folder you want to share.\n\n*Connect to the remote PC. \n\n*Look for your shared Mac folder in your PC's \"My Computer\"\ndirectory (see image below).\n\n\nFinally, as noted by @Bart and @robbpriestley in the comments below, if you are already connected to the remote computer you need to re-establish your connection in order to see the shared folder.\n\nA: Troubleshooting steps for the inability to copy between a Mac and PC - http://mac2.microsoft.com/help/office/14/en-us/rdc/item/2aae839c-7f91-4738-aea7-9ffb25dbfe2e?category=ff488916-8b5e-4a0c-af96-37d065645612.\nI think this answer will likely fix it:\nSolution: Before you start the Remote Desktop session, make the Mac disks available to the Windows-based computer. \n1.On the RDC menu, click Preferences.\n2.Click Drives, and then on the pop-up menu, select the option that you want. \nYour disk or folder is now available so that you can access files that are on your Mac from the Windows-based computer.\nIf you make this change after you connect, the disk or folder that you select becomes available the next time that you connect.\n3.On the Start menu, click Computer or My Computer.\nThe Mac disk or folder that you have made available is listed with all other disks and folders on your Windows-based computer. \nNote  If you can't see the Start menu, on the View menu, click Full Screen.To return to window mode later, point to the top edge of the screen until the RDC menu bar appears. On the menu bar, click View, and then clear the Full Screen check box. \n4.Open the disk or folder that you want to copy from.\n5.On the Start menu, click Computer or My Computer.\n6.Open the disk or folder that you want to copy to.\nYou should now have two windows open, one for the location that you want to copy from, and one for the location that you want to copy to.\n7.Drag the document that you want to copy to the location that you want.\n\nA: Try copy pasting the whole folder.

Try calling the share \"foo,\" connecting to terminal services, and then accessing \\\\tsclient\\foo.\n\nA: I will second the Dropbox recommendation. This is the single greatest way to keep many different machines in sync with files there is. If you save a file on your Mac, within seconds it seems, the same file is updated on your PC.\nA second approach is to use LogMeIn Pro which can do this but it costs money. In my experience, the speed of LogMeIn is much faster than RDP for remotely controlling another machine.\n\nA: If you right-click on the folder on your Mac and then \"Get Info\", what permissions do you see?\nMake sure your username (the user that initiated the RDC session) has read and write access to the folder. If that doesn't work, give \"read & write\" to \"everyone\" (be careful with this one - anyone with access to this folder will be able to modify the contents).\n", "Q: Recovering a deleted photo on iPhone I have a 32GB iPhone 4 version 4.0.1. I have many photos on my phone, but I have deleted an important photo from my iPhone. How can I get this photo back from my iPhone?\n\nA: Unless you have synced your iPhone and thus have your photo somewhere in your computer, or uploaded it to some service you can't recover it easily.\nMost likely you don't have any copies of it and you'll have to find some professional to recover it from the iPhone memory. Maybe, and I say really just maybe, apple care support would be able to do it.\nHere's one thing you could try, though: manage to get access to iPhone file system somehow (jailbreak, iPhone Explorer, anything you want) and get some file recovery software. Keep in mind recovering deleted files are complicated and expensive business. You'll only be able to do it this way if you get lucky.\n", "Q: iTunes artwork doesn't change I change the cover images for the songs in my iTunes library using:\nRight Click > Get Info > Artwork > Drag-Drop > OK \n\nand in most cases the artwork updates immediately. On some tracks, though, it doesn't.\nI then tried removing the artwork (so nothing should appear in Cover Flow), but the track then keeps the image it had previously.\n\nA: iTunes holds its data in an XML structure. On the surface what may appear to you to be a single Album file consisting of 10 separate tracks may, in fact, be 10 separate tracks, each with a separate link to the Album artwork. How this comes about I am not sure, but I think it's related to how the files were input to iTunes. For example, ripping your own CD may produce a different result from 'acquiring' the same album from - shall we say, a download sharing site.\nNormally what I do is \n(1) if an album has no artwork, I select all the tracks and drag'n'drop the artwork (from Amazon for example) into the box for Selected Item. Normally this will lock the artwork to EVERY track in the album. If, however, the structure isn't 'correct' the artwork will only be locked to a single track. You can check by clicking on several tracks in the same album. \n(2)If the artwork isn't there for all the tracks, you can select all the tracks, then go to File>Get Info and drop the artwork into  the Artwork Box. You should then have artwork for every track\n(3)Failing all this, as a last resort I drop the artwork in for each track separately.\nOne of these methods always works for me.\nBit tedious for a few albums, but for more than 1500 albums in my Library, I've only had to go the most tedious route a few times.\nI should add that iTunes allows you to include several versions of the artwork for each track. If you replace artwork you may in fact simply be adding another version. Which one gets displayed is determined in the following way. Click a track. Go to File>Get Info>Artwork... here you will see all the versions of the artwork. Delete the ones you don't want. The one you are left with is the one that gets displayed.\nI know.. it's confusing..\n\nA: I was having this problem and managed to fix it by changing the tracks to MP3s (they were previously WAVs). You can do this by going into iTunes > Preferences > Import Settings > Import Using > [Select] MP3 Encoder.\nNext, right click the tracks and choose > Create MP3 Version. It will create copies of the original files, which will allow you to add artwork.\n\nA: Use an external tool like jaikoz which displays in a synthetic manner (table view) the artworks embedded in files. \nScreenshot: http://www.jthink.net/jaikoz/images/osx/osxscreenshot1024x768.jpg\n\nA: Just go to the location of your music and\n1) select all files required with  ⌘ A\n2) right click and select Get Info\n3) Unmark the \"Read-Only\" or \"locked\" Box\n4) Apply and Done\nThen you can change the iTunes artwork \n\nA: Some files might be write-protected. Go to the MP3 file, select all of them and untick the read only box.\n", "Q: How can I know which Wi-Fi protocol my MacBook is using? If I have a router that supports 802.11 N, G, and B, how can I know which one of these my MacBook is currently using to connect to the router?\nI'd like to see proof that it's connected using the fastest protocol available, rather than hoping everything is working correctly. For example, the N protocol may not be compatible with the MacBook (if it's an early draft), so it would use G instead. Another situation may arrise if the N protocol is disabled on the router via its settings, which would also cause G to probably be used. Thus, rather than assuming that it's using the fastest protocol, I want actual proof that shows which protocol is being used.\n\nA: Try to Option+click on the wifi icon on the menu bar. You'll see a lot more information about your current wifi connection.\nIt looks something lijke this:\n\n\nA: Your Airport card should default to the fastest protocol it is capable of.\n", "Q: Editor or notes application with Markdown support? Are there any editors or notes applications out there that support Markdown? \nI am often having to make notes or documents where markdown formatting would be ideal, and have gotten into the habit of using markdown on a daily basis.\n\nA: It's not a note taker per se, but Textmate has a Markdown mode that will make it easier to use some of the syntax. Like bold, italic, list, etc.  \n\n\nA: If you want a Mac app that actually looks like a Mac app, supports Markdown out of the box (no plugins or add-ons required), and updates on a regular basis, you want BBEdit. I can't recommend it too highly.\n\nA: Since you are using MacVim, you might want to try the vim-pandoc plugin, which supports highlighting, folding, snippets, and conversion (though that can also be done from the shell, even within vim, using things like markdown2pdf) to other formats.\n\nA: emacs supports markdown if you like it, but I guess if you are not used to it, the learning curve is a bit steep.\n\nA: I use Byword with pleasant results.\n\n\nA: I use iA Writer and I am very satisfied (iA Writer is available at the Mac AppStore)  \n\n\n\nA: I used TextMate when I was co-writing a book using Markdown a few years ago. I still write a lot of Markdown, but now my tools of choice are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sublime Text\n\n*plus Markdown Editing plugin\n\n*plus OmniMarkupPreview\nOne nice thing about Markdown is you don't get locked in to a specialized app like Microsoft Word just to write and read it. \nWhat makes for a good toolchain in my experience is a solid text editor as the base, plus good live previewing and some custom coloring of the source. Sublime Text is an excellent text editor (available for Windows and Linux too) and those two (free) plugins trick it out for Markdown nicely.\n\nA: On mac try Marked2 http://marked2app.com/\nYou can basically use the editor of your choice and it will display the markdown when you save the text.

A tutorial for ext3 is on this blog.\n\nA: If you are planning on doing this a lot, there are commecial packages too: \nhttp://www.paragon-software.com/home/extfs-mac/\nThere is a free alternatives also though through MacFuse/FUSE:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse-ext2/files/\n\nA: Mac OS X can read (but not necessarily write):\n\n\n*\n\n*HFS+ (Mac OS X default format, in plain, journaled, case-sensitive, or journaled/case-sensitive varieties)\n\n*NTFS (but not write, by default)\n\n*FAT (32 and 64 as seen in Christian Correa's comment)\n\n\nI would expect it can read but I haven't tested it:\n\n\n*\n\n*HFS (the older Mac OS file system [Hierarchical File System])\n\n*UFS (Unix File System; older versions of OS X could format and be installed on UFS partitions)\n\n\nI know for a fact that OS X will not read:\n\n\n*\n\n*ReiserFS\n\n*ext* (any of the various versions of the ext Linux file system)\n\n*just about anything else\n\n\nCheck out the Mac OS X column at the incredibly complete Wikipedia article comparing file systems.\n\nA: Disk Utility can format a new hard drive using the following formats: \n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X format\n\n*Mac OS X format (Journaled)\n\n*FAT32 (MS-DOS)\n\n*FAT64, also known as exFAT\n\n\nI believe those would be the same file systems that the operating system can read. \n", "Q: How can I crop a video? How does one remove a black border around a video. The input video has the size 720x576 and has the output video should be 720x480. I need to crop away 96 pixels from top and bottom.\nI have gazed through this list of video tools for Mac, but I'm unsure which tools can do this. I have tried MPEG Streamclip and avidemux2, but they doesn't seem capable of it.\nPreferable a free tool.\n\nA: If you are using MacBook or iMac the best app is iMovie.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create new project in iMovie\n\n*Import video to iMovie and then drag and drop it in your new project\n\n*Select you video in project and use crop button in preview window\n\n*Export your new video and use it\n\n\nIf it is a large file that you need a small part of then first trim the video by pressing command+t when the file is opened in quicktime. Import time to iMovie will decrease by a lot\n\nA: You can do this on the command line using ffmpeg and the crop filter.  Handbrake is a great tool, however it uses the same ffmpeg libraries that you can use directly from the command line.\nThe basic command is as follows:\n% ffmpeg -i input_filename -filter:v \"crop=w:h:x:y\" output_filename\n\n\n*\n\n*w = width of the output video\n\n*h = height of the output video\n\n*x:y = coordinate of the top left corner of the crop box (0,0 is top left)\n\nYour specific example, since you want to remove just the top and bottom, you will crop using the center point and just specify the size of the crop box:\n% ffmpeg -i input_filename -filter:v \"crop=720:480\" output_filename\n\nUsing some examples from the ffmpeg page\nCrop area 100x100px starting at coordinate (12,34)\n% ffmpeg -i input_filename -filter:v \"crop=100:100:12:34\" output_filename\n\nSame as above, but using the named options\n% ffmpeg -i input_filename -filter:v \"crop=w=100:h=100:x=12:y=34\" output_filename\n\nCrop an area 100x100px from the center point\n% ffmpeg -i input_filename -filter:v \"crop=100:100\" output_filename\n\n\nA: It's kind of hacky, and probably not the best answer but works if you don't want to download any other tools and just use quicktime, and since I love hacks...\n\n\n*\n\n*Open video in Quicktime.\n\n*Select new screen recording from file menu.\n\n*Setup audio source to be built in input from the arrow next to the record button.\n\n*After pressing the record button, Select the area you want to record (instead of doing full screen) in the original video.\n\n*Start the recording.\n\n*Start the original movie playback.\n\n*When original movie finishes stop the recording by clicking the Stop button in the menu bar.\n\n\nA: Handbrake is the way to go here, as mentioned by roguesys and  canary_in_the_data_mine in the accepted answer. \nI am using Catalina. MPEG Streamclip does not support this version of OSX, and iMovie's cropping tool is married to the 16:9 aspect ratio. \nAs soon as you open your clip, if it has black bars (which was my case), handbrake will crop them automatically and it will show you in its summary how the converted video will look like. \nYou can tweak out things in the other tabs (dimensions where you can do a fine tune of the cropping, video for the compression codec and other things, filters, audio, etc). \nOnce you're satisfied with the settings in the summary, go to the bottom of the App window, choose the folder where you will save the video, and press the green Start button at the top. \n\nA: I've used all built-in video editors on mac. I found that\n\n*\n\n*Quicktime cannot crop videos unless you upgrade it to Quicktime Pro. But it needs the assistance of a Photoshop mask. Moreover, Apple stopped selling Quicktime Pro since 2017.\n\n\n*iMovie can crop videos but at a fixed aspect ratio of 16:9.\n\n\n*The Photos app on Mac, which used to be ignored, now is upgraded to a decent video editor. It is able to crop the video at a free form.

In the file system on the iPhone, Photos are located under /User/Media/DCIM/*\nBut where should I found Images of \"Photo Library\" ?\n\n\nA: In case you are still wondering where it is located inside your iPhone, as I just answered elsewhere, this is the place: /private/var/mobile/Media/Photos/ all files inside that folder are relevant.

My iTunes library, that's shared on our network, has some songs that have a bit rate of 320 kbps.  These songs will not play when I try to play them from a client computer - accessing them through the Shared library.\nWhy won't they play?  Is there a work around besides downgrading the bit rate?\n\nA: Do you know for sure it is the 320 kbps that is keeping the songs from being played? Can you play songs with a lower bitrate successfully? \nThere are three reasons I can think of that would make a song not play in Shared Library: \n\n\n*\n\n*You have reached the 5-computer limit\non Shared Library.

I'm looking for a way to obtain an updated installation media for OS X 10.6.x, currently 10.6.6\nI am looking for a similar solution to the Windows slipstreamed installation media and preferably a solution to put the kit on a USB drive in order to improve the installation speed.\nIs this possible, and if it is how it is possible to get such a media?\n\nA: Same Answer as given here:\nBasically you want to use the System Image Utility to create a bootable .dmg you can than put on a USB drive.\nHave a look at this post, it covers this process in detail (you probably can leave out some steps); this should get you started.\n\nA: There is no official method to 'slipstream' updates into OS X installation media.\nTo install OS X from a USB drive you can make an image of your OS X DVD and then restore that image to your USB drive and boot from it.\nYou could then download and put on that drive the Combo update:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/dl1349\nYes, you have to run them separately, but then you don't have to wait for slower i/o and download times.\n\nA: If your machines are all desktops the using MacOS Server and Netboot might be what you want.\nOtherwise if your machines are all similar you might be able to get away with \n1) Disc Copy the original to the USB drive\n2) Boot new machine off USB\n3) Disk copy from USB.\nbut I would probably use @zevlag's solution \n", "Q: Change Terminal.app's Default Shell to BASH How can I change Terminal.app's default shell to BASH?\nFor some reason, my friend's Mac (10.6.6) defaults to using TCSH instead of BASH. The obvious remedy is to choose /bin/bash as the command to open shells with (as below), but then it fails to load .bashrc and .bash_profile (even if I give a --source or --rcfile parameter).\n\nHow can I switch it to use bash the right way?\n\nA: By using chsh from Terminal. It changes default shell for user. Alternatively you may setup Terminal to use /bin/bash -l ... this will cause BASH to behave as login shell, i.e. it will read .bash_profile.\n\nA: Open System Preferences, select user and right click on its name.\n\"Advanced options...\" will appear. Change shell there.\nIf you're die hard Apple user, you probably will have to enable right click first.\nDepending on your computer model, it can be done under Trackpad or Mouse Preferences.\n\nA: As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal will create login shells even if you choose a custom shell in Startup preferences. So your initial problem should no longer be an issue on Lion. (Although I recommend setting the shell via System Preferences to ensure it's set for the user account and not just for the Terminal application.)\n", "Q: How can I password protect the web.me.com/USER?

At my job, we get specific emails that need to be responded to right away.\nCurrently, I filter and forward those emails to my SMS gateway address provided by AT&T (1234567890@txt.att.net). The problem is that they result in 16 text messages because there are 4 emails and each one results in 4 text messages.\nCan anyone recommend a service or app that provides an email address that will result in an iPhone popup?\n\nA: I'm not sure about Popups, but your iPhone can get emails pushed through gmail. Would that help?\nAlso, whatever forwards to SMS could trim the email so that each only takes 1 SMS to deliver.\n\nA: I don't know that you'll find a free one, because it costs money to maintain a server, the server in which you need to use with some software set up to communicate with the Apple Push Notification Service (\"APNS\").\nWe use Prowl (link goes to homepage, here is an iTunes App Store Link) at work in order to send Monitoring (NAGIOS) notifications to our phones. It's a $3 app, but it's also infinitely flexible.\nIt gives you an e-mail address you can use to just shoot notifications too, but it also offers an API you can use to do a lot of special things with.\nMore details if requested after you check out Zac's site. (Zac is the developer/maintainer/operator of Prowl app and it's associated server backend.)\n\nA: My original intent was to enable push support for my mail server and the following recommendation works pretty well for dozens of mails per hour with usually brilliant, rarely not-so-jolly response times.\nThere are a couple of choices in the App Store. The first I found bearable is Boxcar. It is an app coupled with a service that provides you access to Apple Push Notification Service in a form of a unique e-mail address which you can forward mail to.\nIt has a variety of notifications, but the best idea is to set it to merely display badges with mail information and play a sound.\nThe downside is that you have to pipe your mail through a third party but you have a choice to filter forwarded mail on your own mail server, which you already do.\nI find it blazing fast most of the time (95%) with response times measured in sub-4 seconds, but there are cases (5%) where the delivery lag jitters highly. I have seen messages appear on the desktop computer 15 minutes before the push arrived.\nStill, it's easy to configure and it is actually convenient.\n\nA: You can send whatever notification using phone pipe: \nhttps://github.com/drewcrawford/Phone-Pipe\nYou will need the free Notifo app for this, check the itunes store.\n\nA: Google Voice is pretty good for this kind of stuff, and it's free.\n", "Q: Microphone to use with OS X's Speech features I'm currently using the built-in microphone on my early 2007 MacBook Pro to access the Speech features.  I'd like to use an actual microphone that I can clip to my shirt or something (since Speech seems to work better when I'm closer to the mic).  What do you use for a mic?  Can I just use the mic on the default iPhone headphones?\n\nA: I am not sure the iPhone headphones with the built-in microphone will work on older MacBooks, since I believe they do require a headphone jack capable of sending the microphone input. Headphone jacks on MacBooks shipped after the iPhone was introduced all have that capability. \nAs fas as microphone recommendations, the following two seem to be regarded as very good by different sources I trust, such as the Equipment Guide that 5by5's Dan Benjamin writes every year: \n\n\n*\n\n*For beginners: Plantronics .Audio 655 USB Multimedia Headset\n\n*For pros:  Heil PR40 Dynamic Microphone\n\n\nHope this helps. \n", "Q: How do I replace the hard drive in my circa 2008 iMac? My circa 2008 iMac hung up today and wouldn't reboot -- it just hung on boot with the Apple logo and the spinner. I booted the Snow Leopard DVD and ran Disk Utility on the drive. It told me the drive needed repairing but during the repair cycle stopped, and said the drive couldn't be repaired. That I should format it and restore from a backup.\nSo I did. Or, am doing. The restore from my TimeMachine drive is about 75% done now.\nEven if this is successful, I'm nervous. I'm not sure if that drive failure was some sort of uncorrectable filesystem corruption that occured because when the iMac was hung up I hard stopped it with the power button, or if the drive is starting to fail.\nI'd like to replace the drive in it just to be on the safe side. Is this hard to do? I couldn't find anything about this procedure on Apple's support web site. If I replace it is there a brand of drive that I should buy or is the OS accepting of anything I put in there? Is it a 2.5\" or a 3.5\" SATA drive in there?\n\nA: If you're talking about an aluminum iMac, getting to the HDD involves removing the built in display monitor to be able to get behind it. YouTube seems to have several video walk-throughs that show the process (including this one; the link is to the first part). Additionally, a quick search turned up a site with written, step by step instructions. The process seems too complex to provide here.\nIf you're comfortable with this level of complexity in hardware repair, then the video or text walk throughs should help you. I suspect, all things considered, if you're not confident enough to perform the upgrade yourself just by looking at videos of others who have done it, then this probably falls into the class of \"take your iMac to your local Mac service centre and get them to do it\": yes, it will cost you money, but they can also guarantee their workmanship...\n\nA: Yes, this is hard to do.  Go to iFixit.com and look up the repair guide for your particular version of the iMac to see just how difficult.\nYou can use any 3.5\" SATA drive in the iMac.  Choose a replacement drive based on your criteria such as capacity, price, manufacturer's reputation, etc.  \nThe drive should report its S.M.A.R.T. status in the Disk Utility application.  If this status is good, I wouldn't bother replacing the drive.  \n", "Q: iMac refuses to boot, Disk Utility always says there are drive errors it can't repair -- what to do? This is a follow on to the question I asked about replacing the hard drive in my iMac. The restore from TimeMachine finished and the machine still won't boot. Just the white screen, Apple logo and spinner. I booted to the Snow Leopard DVD and ran Disk Utility on it again -- and again Disk Utility told me:\n\nVerify and Repair volume \"Main\"\n  Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume.\n  Checking extents overflow file.\n  Checking catalog file.\n  Invalid node structure\n  The volume Main could not be verified completely.\n  Volume repair complete.\n  Updating boot support partitions for the volume as required.\n  Error: Disk Utility can't repair this disk. Back up as many of your files as possible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files.\n\nIs this drive dead? Seems odd I could restore to it if it's dead. Should I try an older backup from TimeMachine? Could the most recent backup be restoring something so corrupt to the disk that it's un-bootable after the restore?\nEdit: SMART status for the drive was fine. No problems reported.\nEdit: I restored from a TM backup that wasn't the latest. A few hours before that. It still won't boot, but I get a little further in the Repair Disk function now. Mean anything to anyone?\n\nVerify and Repair volume \"Main\"\n  Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume.\n  Checking extents overflow file.\n  Checking catalog file.\n  Invalid sibling link\n  Rebuilding catalog B-tree.\n  Invalid key length\n  The volume Main could not be verified completely.\n  Volume repair complete.\n  Updating boot support partitions for the volume as required.\n  Error: Disk Utility can't repair this disk. Back up as many of your files as possible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files.\n\nUpdate: it was an issue with my primary drive. It had something going on with that was preventing it from being boot-able. Replacing the drive (more or less) fixed the problem.\n\nA: Having solved the problem I can answer my own question.\nIt was a problem with the iMac's internal hard drive. Scanning the drive after the fact revealed a whole host of bad sector errors. Not sure why I couldn't pick this stuff up when I was trying to restore to it.\nIn any case, even with a new drive installed in the machine I couldn't get the Utilities -> Restore method of restoring the machine from my TimeMachine drive to work. It did the same thing with a new drive: it's just hang forever on boot, no chime, just Apple logo and a spinner for hours and hours.\nThe solution was to do a clean OS X install from the OS X DVD (instead of using the Utilities -> Restore menu option to restore the machine). Then, on first boot, when you first log in to OS X it'll ask you if you want to restore this machine from a TimeMachine drive. I said \"Yes\" to this option, it found my TimeMachine drive, I selected all the available types of things to restore (System Settings, User Data, Applications and Other) and let it do its thing for a few hours.\nAnd this time it worked. Reboots were fine. My data is there and intact. All is well.\n\nA: It sounds like this is a file system issue, rather than a drive issue, and you're right to consider restoring to an older backup. Unfortunately it's going to be hit-and-miss for a while, until you find a backup that works.\nOnce you're able to restore to a working version, I would do as DiskUtility says and backup your files and reformat the drive/reinstall the operating system, then make a brand new Time Machine backup from that.\nLikely, the drive is fine, it's only something to do with a corrupt backup.\n", "Q: What is the iPad's screen refresh rate? Is it 60 Hz like the phones/touches?\n\nA: 60Hz.\nApple DTS has not changed any of their answers about 60Hz refresh rates with respect to any device model, and no one has reported any higher rate.\nUpdate: In 2017, Apple introduced new iPad Pro devices capable of higher display refresh rates than 60 Hz.\n\nA: Apple introduced 2nd generation of iPad Pro models in June 2017 which feature ProMotion display technology, which delivers refresh rates of upto 120Hz. ProMotion also improves display quality and reduces power consumption by automatically adjusting the display refresh rate to match the movement of the content.\nIt comes in two variants with 10.5\" and 12.9\" screen sizes.\n", "Q: Update/backup iPod via iTunes on virtual Windows XP? All the programs I use on my Mac these days are either in a Linux VM (in Virtualbox), or open-source apps which are also available on Linux.  With one exception: iTunes, which I only use to feed my iPod Touch (4gen).\nI'm tempted to switch over to Linux entirely, but I don't want to completely lose the ability to update/backup my iPod, and I don't want to deal with the hassle of dual-booting.  (I can buy apps on my iPod itself, but apparently I can't download MP3s or subscribe to podcasts without using iTunes on a computer.)\nI've heard that you can't run (non-server) Mac OS X in a virtual machine, even on Apple hardware.  I do, however, have an old Windows XP license.\nIs it possible to run iTunes 10, including iPod Touch (4gen) syncing, in a virtualized Windows XP on a Linux host?  I've the most experience with Virtualbox (at work and home), but I'd be willing to entertain the possibility of switching to another VM.\nI found this article that says it's possible, but is rather old: it only speaks of the iPod Touch 1gen.  This other article has no date but mentions iTunes 8 (which Wikipedia says was shipped with the iPod Touch 2gen).\nIt doesn't need to be terribly convenient.  If CD ripping doesn't work, for example, I'm happy to rip elsewhere and copy the files to Windows for iTunes.  I really just want the ability to copy data onto my iPod, including iOS updates, and do backups.\nHas anyone tried this more recently?  Is it still possible with iTunes 10 / iPod Touch 4gen?\n\nA: \nIs this possible? Legal? If so, what are the drawbacks and tricks\n\nAs of OS X Lion 10.7, the EULA permits you to use the OS in two virtual machines, on Apple hardware:\n\n(iii) to install, use and run up to two (2) additional copies or instances of the Apple Software within \n  virtual operating system environments on each Mac Computer you own or control that is already \n  running the Apple Software.\n\nThis was first allowed with OS X Server 10.5, and both VMWare Fusion and Parallels Desktop allow you to easily setup an OS X guest machine, as does VirtualBox\nAn OS X guest on non-Apple hardware is possible with some fiddling, but is in violation of the software's EULA (i.e doing so is of questionable legality..)\n\niTunes, running in a VM, will be able to see the iPod/iPhone/iPad. As long as the USB can be connected to the VM. So this depends on which setup you are using. The above should explain the legalities of the OS X and VMs.\nYou can install Linux on Apple hardware, then run a VM of OS X (10.7 and above) on the machine to be able to use iTunes to keep the library in sync and updated, etc., and it won't cause you any issues.\n", "Q: Safari slowdown issues Safari is quite slow when I open new tabs. I get a busy cursor, and I cannot interact with other tabs.\nIs there any way to make it faster?\nI have a 2010 MacBook Pro, MacOS 10.6.6, Safari 5.0.3.\n\nA: Install clicktoflash or some other flash blocking thing.\nAlso disable java and other plugins. These are particularly useful for Safari 4.\n\nA: Here are some good tips on reviews.cnet.com on speeding up Safari.  Some of the tips are detailed below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try dragging the folder Icons -- where these icons are cached -- within the ~/Library/Safari folder to the trash and restarting Safari.\n\n*Try deleting ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist if you are experiencing slow launches, but note that you will lose some easily recoverable settings, such as whether or not tabbed browsing is enabled.\n\n*A blanket approach to deleting many of the potentially problem-causing items is the Reset Safari... command, available under the Safari menu in Safari. Note, however, that this command also deletes your browser history, personal data -- such as stored login passwords, search entries, cookies and more -- that you may not want to clear. Still, it's a good initial cleansing step.  On recent versions of Safari you can select the kinds of data you want to delete/keep.\n\n*Try temporarily disabling plugins to see if that's a potential cause.  Go to the Safari menu within Safari, and select Preferences.  Click on the Security tab and deselect 'Enable plug-ins'.  Restart Safari and see if the slowness has disappeared.  If it has then the problem is likely to be an errant plugin.\n\n\nA: First thing to try is to clear the cache and history, and restart Safari (and even your MacBook).\n", "Q: HFS+ case-sensitive or case-insensitive -- which type to use for the primary drive partition? What reasons are there for choosing the case-insensitive version of HFS+ when formatting the primary drive partition? Would case-sensitive not always be the best choice?\n\nA: One or other can break applications, case-insensitive is the default however.  If you've been using case-insensitive without issues then there are no guarantees that a transition to case-sensitive will go well.  Here's one example from the apple support pages:  \n\n...don’t assume your\n  third-party software solutions work\n  correctly with case sensitivity.\n  Important:  Case-sensitive names do\n  not ignore Unicode ignorable\n  characters. This means that a single\n  directory can have several names that\n  are considered equivalent using\n  Unicode comparison rules, but they are\n  considered distinct on a\n  case-sensitive HFSX volume.\n\n\nA: There is a good reason to choose a case sensitive file system.\nIf you are concerned by the quality and the security of the applications you run you might be interested by any early mechanism which may discriminate badly programmed applications.\nAn application which at one time create a file named conf and later\ntry to open the same file with the name CONF is at\nleast poorly written. This is just plain bad programming practice.\nThis kind of application is filled with vulnerabilities with the same\naverage probability all over its code length. This is a dangerous application.\nThis dangerous application will most probably crash on a case sensitive file system.\nThis dangerous application will not crash on a case insensitive file system.\n(Some applications will crash on both,\nbut we are not highly motivated to sort out these ones.)\nHence a case sensitive file system may be considered as a good tool to early detect and block poorly programmed applications.\nOn the other hand, this level of programming quality control is far from sufficient to ensure that you don't have any other vulnerability.\n\nA: There are some significant applications that will not work correctly with case sensitive. And there's really no reason to do it. I'm assuming since you're asking that you really don't have a reason to do it. You're definitely better off not doing it unless you have a specific reason, and don't care that many applications don't work right with it.\n\nA: Use the default (case-insensitive) unless you both a) know what you're doing and b) you absolutely have to. There are several programs (Norton Antivirus comes to mind) that won't work properly on a case-sensitive file system.\nHFS is, by default, case-insensitive but case-preserving (i.e. it doesn't care what you type for comparison purposes, but it will remember what you type). \n\nA: One good reason to use case sensitive file system is using git repositories. Syncing them to the repo causes problems again and again, if not using case.\nBut I suggest adding another partition using HFS+ formatted case sensitive for such an application and link the directories you need to that partition. My system partition is still case insensitive not because I kwow why but just because I'm afraid.\n\nA: Adobe Creative Cloud apps will not run on a case sensitive system, and can be a major problem\n\nA: Adobe programs are infamous for not working on case-sensitive filesystems. Adobe says:\n\nYou cannot install Adobe products on a volume that uses a case-sensitive file system, such as HSFX (HFS+) or UFS. This limitation applies to both the startup drive as well as the drive onto which the software is installed.\n\nhttps://helpx.adobe.com/creative-suite/kb/error-case-sensitive-drives-supported.html\nSteam cannot be installed on case-sensitive filesystems either.\n\nSteam does not currently support case sensitive filesystems or partitions.\n\nhttps://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8601-RYPX-5789\n", "Q: What do these dashed-box symbols mean on Japanese keyboard? What do these dashed boxes mean and how to use them?\n\n\nA:  \nYour image seems to have disappeared so I added one myself.\nThe dashed boxes represent the space that a normal character would occupy so you can see how the characters you're typing will be positioned.  On the middle row shown, the first key puts a mark in the lower-left position, the second key has the same position, the third shows that the dot will be in the middle of the character space and the last one shows the line will be beneath the normal character space, almost like an underscore\n\nA: The Japanese characters on the depicted white keys are hiragana, these are what is used during direct input. So, the K key will produce の. The characters are arranged slightly differently on my keys; see my image. Using shift (or caps) as a modifier inputs the character in the right position. For instance, Shift < produces 、 and Shift > produces 。. Also, using option as a modifier will input dotted boxed characters in the upper position (only ＿ exist for me).\n\nIf you are using Mac OS X 10.6, you should have an IME menu on your menubar. In this OS X Japanese writing tutorial reference the steps to reach the utilitiy in Fig. 4 Kotoeri to change Input style to Kana typing.\nI hope this helps.\nCheers!\n", "Q: OS X Automator “Take Screenshot” Issue I need to automate a screenshot task, so I thought why not use automator?\nI found the \"Take Screenshot\" Action and started to play with it. The problem is is that is sets the file name and when the workflow is ran again it overwrites the prior screenshot.

If that's not the case, then I would completely remove the account from Mail or explore around ~/Library/Mail and edit/remove some files if necessary.\n", "Q: Comparison of Microsoft Word to Apple Pages I'm thinking about getting a word processor for my Mac. The two most popular options are probably Microsoft's Word or Apple's Pages. Before I decide to buy one I need to make sure that it will have all of the features I need. Is there feature matrix which compares Word to Pages and shows which features each application supports?\nI'd like to see an exhaustive list of all the features each one supports, or something very close to it. Ideally it should be in table format so that it's very easy to read.\n\nA: I was recently in a similar position because I needed something for school, and I went with Pages, pretty much on price alone. A 5-license family pack of Pages costs a whole third less than the Home & Student version of Word, so I can put Pages on both home and work laptops and still have extra for my wife's and mum-in-law's Macs.\nThe article linked in @mybrainishuge's response is pretty much spot on in comparing the two. Each application does the same thing just in different ways. Some good, some not so much, but then all word processor apps have their quirks. Since my needs are humble (I have easy access to InDesign for any heavy page layouts) I figured how bad could Pages be compared to the bloat and \"kludginess\" that is Word these days; fifteen years I've been working with Office and I can safely say I genuinely don't like Microsoft products, so Pages it was.\nYMMV, so I suggest working with the demos for each (I know Pages has a demo, but I'm not sure about Word as the companies I work for always just gave it to me) and see which one meets your needs.\n\nA: Wikipedia is the best source for comparison tables:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_word_processors\nIf you have questions about features not on the table, edit your question.\n\nA: If you're familiar with Microsoft Word, then buy Word.

Switched recently from a Lenovo PC and one thing on my mac bothered me. Headphones plugged into my Macbook pro 13\" (latest version) \"hum\" with static when there is no audio playing. Then after a short period of time, they stop humming, as if all power to the port is turned off. When any sound plays, it starts again. Anybody know of any setting in the Mac \"bios\" (or whatever they call it) or with drivers or software to get it to stop humming? It's rather annoying.\n\nA: What you are hearing is the intrinsic noise of the Macbook's DAC and output buffers.\nThe output does actually power down when it goes unused for a certain period of time, which is why the noise goes away. The analog output is powered down to save battery.\nUnfortunately, since the noise is intrinsic to the system, the only way to disable it is to completely disable the ability to output any sound.\nThere may be a way to modify the period of time it takes before the output gets powered down, but I am not familiar with any.\n\nA: Closing my web browser solved my buzz problem!\nMy Mac Pro started an electronic type of buzzing sound suddenly in the past few weeks.\nThe sound was coming from the audio output (headphone jack or firewire audio output - same issue)\nI had incorporated some new speakers recently and I thought maybe it was some kind of new grounding problem. While attempting to pursue a solution to the problem, on a whim I decided to shut down my mac to see if that might do anything.\nWhile preparing to shut down I was closing various programs. Then I closed down Google Chrome, on which I had about 10-15 tabs open... and the sound went away!\nI've never experienced something like this before.  I'm imagining perhaps it was some kind of issue with one of the pages I had up.\nI've often had multiple browsers windows, each with multiple tabs open and never had this kind of thing happen... so this was unique experience for me.\n\nA: The hum is also present for me, even with unplugging everything. Actually, if you have a look (or at least, for me, this is the case) if you touch the body of the machine, it ceases to hum. It must be some kind of static buildup of charge on the aluminium body, and when you touch it, your body acts as a very large condenser. \nWhen you can ground the machine with your body, you might want to check the power cord and replace an ungrounded \"duck head\" or cord with one that goes to a properly grounded wall receptacle. Also, take a toothbrush to the magsafe connectors to ensure all the springs work and make contact to the connector on the mac. \nIf you use an external USB I/O (I use a mixer, for I'm a session musician), the hum is not plagueing the alternative sound source. \n\nA: Any of the above may apply, but this solved mine;\nAs soon as I unplugged from power, the buzz went. Nothing to doo with ground loops, or bad connectors ( even though 3.5 mm plugs differ surprisingly ).\nThe answer was that the laptop Battery was long overdue for replacement. When power is put through this for charging, you get the hum. I have about 40min of battery life without main charging. so it is enough to drive some midi gear from a sound font sampler for a few songs, then mute the channel while I feed it mains power again during the break.\nI double checked the exact setup by plugging to a refurbished MacBook Air and confirmed it. ( actually the wife suggested this solution, you know what they say, don't argue with a woman, she's always right :)\n\nA: I found the solution to my problem. For some reason (who knows why) the headphone output was set to 16-bit. Of course that's going to sound awful.\nTo fix this, head to 'Audio MIDI Setup' (can be found with Spotlight) and change the 'Built-in Output' to 32-bits.\n\nA: My macbook air also hums into my Bose earbuds. Disconnecting the magsafe power cable lessens it, but not by much. Touching the body of the computer dramatically decreases the hum (the more skin that touches, the greater the decrease).\n\nA: Bmike above said that when he touched his, it got rid of the problem. if it's true for you as well OP, try touching the base and a brick wall or something, or lick your fingers and wipe the bottom with them a little. for any other solutions look up how to get rid of static electricity on google.\n\nA: My solution: plug in three pronged charger instead of two pronged charger\nOther answers have mentioned this but with other cruft in the way.\n\nA: This is happening for those who are using the MagSafe adapter without the ground. The MagSafe you can connect to the power wall socket in two ways:\n\n*\n\n*Using the 1.5-meter cable which has grounding pins.\n\n*Using the adapter that has only 2 pins and no grounding that's causing the noise.\n\nBuy a cable with grounding and the noise will disappear.\n\nA: iMac 27 inch - late 2012, i7\nWell, Apple probably won't like this advice but it EASILY worked for me :\n\n\n*\n\n*I use the headphone jack output for audio playback from my iMac (Pro Tools, iTunes, etc) and after upgrading to the iMac from my Mac Pro (early 2008, quad core) physically configured the same way (headphone jack output to my speakers) the iMac would constantly emit a BUZZ shortly after any sound was outputted from it.  i.e. : something like a system sound would play, there would be silence, and then after about 10 seconds or so the BUZZ would constantly output.\n\n*read and tried a few things that were completely useless and weird to even give a try (but I did regardless) - things like : 'zap the PRAM' ... reset the SMC ... switch to 32bit .... all weird, misguided and did not solve the problem.\n\n*I shut down the iMac, unplugged the power cable from the wall, grabbed a pair of needle nose pliers and then ripped off the GROUND PLUG from the power cable.  Plugged it back in, booted back up and SOLVED.  Apple's mention of a \"ground loop\" possibly being the problem in other posts was the best advice I found.  They did/would not offer this solution but for me, after working in recording studios for more than 25 years now and experiencing MANY types of grounding issues with regard to BUZZ in the audio signal - it led me to just rip that ground plug off and move forward.\n\n*As a professional I cannot profess to know that the possible negative implications might be from having a non-grounded iMac but let me just say that this is not the first time that I have done this with a computer or any type of gear for that matter to just basically \"move on\".\n\n\nLet's see if Apple allows this post.  Believe me - try it!  If it doesn't help then make sure that you have a replacement IEC power cable (the one that has a female 3-pronged end and a male 3-pronged end) to swap out to if not successful.\n\nA: This post is now the highest ranked answer when you Google\n\nmacbook headphone buzzing\n\n, so I thought I´d leave my answer to this question as well.\nAs others have mentioned above, I also had the issue where I heard a low frequent buzzing/humming sound when I had my headphones (Bose QuietComfort) connected to my Macbook. If I touched the Macbook chassis with my hand, the sound faded. If I lifted my hand, the sound was more present.\nThere appears to be multiple ways to resolve this issue, depending on the root cause!\nIn my experience, adjusting the output in \"Audio Midi Setup\" did nothing. Instead, I discovered the audio jack connected to my headphone (and not my Macbook) was not fully inserted. When I pushed the connector back into the headphones, the buzz was gone!\n", "Q: How can I change the location which Anki uses to save files? The program Anki saves its data to the Documents folder.

However, you might need to set it in a Launch Daemon / Agent for Anki to figure it out if you use Spotlight. Tested 2.1.0beta4.\n\nA: Actually, that is not the best way. You can run Anki in portable mode and specify the path to a different data folder. Create a shortcut to Anki.exe and change the target path to this:\nanki.exe -b \"D:\\Anki\"\n\nClose Anki, move your Anki data files to D:\\Anki (or whatever folder you choose) and restart Anki.\n", "Q: How can I install boot camp off a Windows 7 USB flash drive? I'm trying to follow the directions on how to create a Windows 7 installation USB flash drive. I was able to create the drive and when I insert it into a Windows computer, it shows the installer correctly.\nThe problem is that when I get to the \"Start Windows Installation\" step in boot camp, it asks to insert the Windows disk. I inserted the USB drive, and it appears on the desktop, however, when I click Start Installation, I get the following error message:\n\nThe installer disc could not be found.\n  Insert your Windows installer disc and wait a few seconds for the disc to be recognized.\n\n\nA: long story short. To create a boot disk on USB do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*open bootcamp app contents (finder, right-click on bootcamp app at applications folder)\n\n*Copy info.plist file to another place (like desktop), rename the original to something like \"OLDinfo.plist\" to preserve a backup.\n\n*Right-click that copied file and open it with textedit\n\n*Search for a line containing the string(close to the bottom):\n PreUSBBootSupportedModels\n\n*Remove the \"Pre\" string so the line look like:\n USBBootSupportedModels\n\n*Save the file and copy it back to the bootcamp package contents.\n\n*Run the bootcamp and select the corresponding USB generating option that now shows up there at second screen.\n\n*Use the rEFIt thing as noted before.\n\n*Profit!\n\n\nA: I'm having the exact same problem. I tried holding the option key when rebooting to see if I could boot from the USB key but I could not find a way to do this, so I installed rEFIt (then rebooted twice!) and THEN plugged in the USB key and the next time I rebooted it did show up as an option to boot from the USB key. \nI tried that and the windows installer loaded and it found the new bootcamp FAT32 partition. It said I couldn't install to the bootcamp partition because it requires NTFS.\nThis SuperUser post suggests \"simply format the partition using the Windows installer's built-in utility (in other words, as part of the installation process)\" so I did that continued with the install and everything works fine!\n\nA: This is just a wild guess, but what about pressing and holding the alt key while booting and see if it will allow you to choose the USB drive the boot drive.\nI don't know if the mac will boot from USB at all.\n\nA: If you are using Lion, there is an easy way to use Bootcamp to install Windows. Bootcamp in itself has support to create Windows 7 install disk from iso file, but by default it is disabled for Macbook Pros. \nCheck out this link for how to do it.\n\nWith Lion, Apple has added an option to BootCamp that will create a\n  bootable USB Windows 7 install disk. \n  Unfortunately, Apple only allows this on computers that support\n  booting from a USB drive (a.k.a. they don't have optical drive) which\n  include the MacBook Air and 2011 Mac Mini. Their is a way around this,\n  and after searching and finding the solution, I decided to pass it one\n  to you.\n\n\nA: Use a trial verion of DAEMON Tools for mac, and mount the image file.\n\nA: What the guy above says about the DAEMON Tools works, though there are more steps needed. First you'll need an ISO file, which you can actually make out of the flash drive by simply creating a new image file in Disk Utility by clicking on the New Image icon on the Toolbar, though obviously first you need the flash drive selected in the left hand column, make the Image Format DVD/CD Master (I don't think its necessary to have a encryption), and save it where you find convenient (like the Desktop). Now you can rename it from .cdr to .iso (it needs to be an ISO I believe). Now download and open DAEMON Tools (just use the 20 day trial), and press the Quick Mount icon at the bottom and navigate and open your ISO file. Now Boot Camp Assistant should be able to see your ISO file/data from flash drive, and the rest should be handled without problem. You can also get the rEFIt boot manager if you want, be my guest. (Oh yeah, and this is using the latest software, Yosemite, though on a MacBook Pro 15 inch, Mid 2010) If the whole flash drive converting to ISO (I did here) doesn't work or isn't recognized, just get the Windows (whatever version) ISO file from the Microsoft website.\n", "Q: Why do I need an admin password to change the VPN PPP Password in my keychain? It's MY local personal keychain after all. I can edit other passwords, but not the VPN PPP pasword. See screenshot for details.\n\n\nA: I think because VPN is a network interface, your basically changing preferences for that (so that´s a global change, not only for your keychain item). So the same way you need to identify as an admin to unlock \"System Preferences...\">\"Network\" for being able to change interfaces, you would need to do that here, too.\n\nA: Because it's YOUR keychain.

Technically, you can't Boot Camp Ubuntu as it is a specialized way to streamline Windows dual boot installs on Macs. \nHowever, you can use it to create an initial partition, which you delete and format for Ubuntu's use. Alternatively, you can use Disk Utility to decrease the size of your OS X partition. Then use Ubuntu's installer to modify that empty space into usable partitions for Ubuntu. From there, install Ubuntu as usual. (Be sure to hold down C while booting to ensure you boot from the disc.)\nFinally, you would have to choose your virtualization platform:\n\n\n*\n\n*VirtualBox supports raw disc access but has very large warnings against its usage due to data corruption concerns, etc. Chapter 9 of their manual covers raw disc access.\n\n*VMware Workstation supports raw disk access, but unfortunately doesn't work on OS X. Even worse, VMware Fusion doesn't appear to support setting up raw disk access from the GUI.\n\n\nThe workaround, should you choose the VMware approach, is to use the command line tools and manually editing config files to give you access to raw disk access. This forum thread has useful discussion on this process, as well as other concerns. \n\nA: To my knowledge, you can't have an Ubuntu virtual machine (VMware, VirtualBox or even Xen) and then be able to native boot the same. Seems kind of crossed purposes to me... :)\n\nA: Yeah your only option is to install Ubuntu and OS X in a dual boot scenario and install VirtualBox on both. the OS X (guest) inside V-Box is pretty difficult to do but definitely possible because I have done it. Ubuntu (guest) inside OS X is simple to set up.\n", "Q: How does autorotation work on the iPhone (in terms of hardware, not software) I have always wondered how the orientation/autorotation hardware works inside an iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch.\nOriginally I thought it was the accelerometer but I don't think it is as an accelerometer can only measure movement and the iPhone knows it's current orientation without any movement.\nI have assumed until now that there is a little tilt switch inside the phone as well as the accelerometer and that this is used, but really I have no idea and Google isn't helping much! ;)\nAnyone know how it works?\n\nA: It´s called a gyroscope. Have a look at  this article on iFixit, it explains it (within an iPhone 4) quite well.\n\nA: In the older iOS devices it's the accelerometer - it is detecting the constant acceleration due to gravity.\nNormal motion produces only short bursts of acceleration, not long enough to trigger rotation.\nIf you put your iOS device in a fast car and accelerated it for several seconds you could probably get it to autorotate the wrong way.\n\nA: From what I know, the iPhone (and iPod Touch) didn't have a gyroscope until the latest model. Are you guys sure it's not the accelerometer that did this, and now it is the gyroscope in the most recent models?\n\nA: I talked to a person about this topic (who was skilled in electronics as well as in software development), he answered, there is a special IC (integrated circuit) integrated on the circuit boards of some modern mobile phones that determines which edge of the phone is currently downwards which is used in autorotation of screen using software (the driver of the IC).

How can I type a backtick (accent grave, or \"`\") on an European (Dutch) apple keyboard ?\n\nA: According to this image from Apple's KB article, it appears to be between the Z and shift.\n\n\nA: On European keyboard, press alt + 9.\n", "Q: Boot 2010 iMac from 2007 MacBook Pro's drive? I am considering purchasing a 2010 27\" iMac to replace my 2007 MacBook Pro as my everyday development machine.  Ideally, I would like to work on the iMac when I am in my home office and work on the MacBook Pro when I am out at a clients office, coffeeshop, etc.  I would like both machines to be in sync so I don't have to worry about not having an application installed, missing project files, etc.\nIs it possible to use the internal drive on the MacBook Pro as the boot drive of the iMac?  This would enable me to simply shut the machines down, disconnect my MacBook Pro and have a less powerful but functionally equivalent machine to go.  If it is possible what are the drawbacks?  Are things like system updates machine specific which would prevent me from updating the OS using the iMac and then trying to boot into the MacBook?\nI am not interested in using an external drive to boot the MacBook as it would be too cumbersome, nor am I interested in using the iMac as merely a display for the MacBook since the iMac will be significantly faster.\nIf using the laptop as a boot drive is not feasible are their other options I should consider?\n\nA: It may be possible, but not recommended. While you don't really have to worry about drivers so much - there may be minor incompatibilities. That is if you get it to boot - especially if the MacBook Pro isn't running the latest version of the OS thats after whatever originally came on the iMac. \nSystem updates can be used across machines, but when the install is being done it does check the hardware. You may end up installing iMac specific things on your MacBook Pro, which may cause issues. \nYou really have two routes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy a new MacBook Pro instead, and an external monitor. Therefore you have the same machine, and can go wherever. \n\n*Sync the two machines using items like Dropbox, etc. I understand maybe application differences, but thats a very small issue (almost a non issue). Keep most of your files on dropbox, and everythings always in sync.\n\n\nI would go (and do use) the second solution. My primary machine is a 27\" iMac, but I constantly use my wifes 13\" MacBook Pro when going out or not at my desk. I then keep most all active documents in Dropbox and sync between. Both are outfitted with the software I need (in my case, Aperture, TextWrangler, Xcode, etc).\n\nA: I'm slightly surprised that this problem hasn't been solved yet for home use. It must be a fairly common problem. Or possibly just a problem that people wish was solved but never get around to doing anything with.\nI'm not sure how to solve you're actual problem of booting off the MacBook Pro hard drive. But I have two other options shown below. \nFor a while, I was using Unison File Synchronizer to sync between my MacBook Pro and a Hackintosh netbook I had. Wasn't a bad solution  and seemed pretty quick to sync but I never trusted it 100%, assuming that I would probably lose everything if something went wrong.\nAs another option, I wonder if you can set up a Portable Home Directory. This is where there is a copy of your home directory on the server. Each computer that you use creates a local copy which is synced back to the server. It can either be connected to the network (as the iMac will be) or synced later if you take it out of the house (like the MacBook Pro). This seems to be suited more to a workplace or similar but you could probably get it working at home. At fairly decent looking guide is available here but clearly YMMV. I'm tempted to try this at home at some point but haven't bothered yet. \nAs another option, it might be possible to automount the MacBook Pro home directory from the iMac and use that as your home directory... but that sounds a little messy.\n", "Q: Transfer OS X Dashboard Widgets Between Computers Can anyone tell me an easy way to transfer my dashboard widgets from one OS X computer to another?  If there was a way to keep their positioning/settings too that would be great.\n\nA: macOS does not have the /Users/[user]/Library/Widgets/ folder on a fresh install. Simply create the Widgets folder and place your widget file in it. Your widget will appear in the Dashboard.\n\nA: Widgets are saved at /Library/Widgets/ and /Users/[user]/Library/Widgets/\nIf you copy /Users/[user]/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dashboard.plist that will copy your Dashboard configuration.\nEach widget will have it's own configuration file in /Users/[user]/Library/Preferences/, for example widget-com.apple.widget.weather.plist\n", "Q: Tools for prototyping iPad applications (I asked in stackoverflow but repeat it here)\nI would like to build a GUI prototype for an iPad application. The prototype can use static data (e.g. an xml file) but should look good and be fully functional, i.e. support user gestures, etc.\nObviously, I can program it in Objective-C. I wonder if I can use any other tool to build such a GUI easier. Does such a tool exist ?\nMaybe I should use a GUI builder to build a \"static\" GUI and add some Objective-C code to make it react on user gestures. Does it make sense ?\n\nA: Balsamiq: http://balsamiq.com/\n\nA: Interface lets you make the mockup in the iOS device, and looks and acts like a real app. The mockup can then be exported to xcode. \n\nA: I have been using iMockups for my prototyping purposes for several months now and have been pleased with it so far. \nThe only downside can also be its greatest strength (depending on your needs): it is designed to be flexible. For instance, you can do quick web mockups as well in the app. Since it isn't specialized, you don't get features such as exporting code for Xcode to use, but the added flexibility can be a great boon.\n\nA: If you're a Mac user I would highly recommend using Travis Isaacs's very cool Wireframe Toolkit for Keynote. Keynote provided the ability to link areas in your mockup to other slides and use a lot of the transitions and animations that are very close to their iOS counterparts.\n\nA: WireframeSketcher comes with dedicated stencils for iPad applications. You can use links for simple interactivity. You can even test your prototype on iPad by exporting it to HTML that you can put online via Dropbox.\n", "Q: Can I access TimeMachine data from a machine other than the one that was being backed up? I have an iMac with a dead internal drive. And I have it's TimeMachine drive. I'd like to know that the TimeMachine-based data is safe and sound so I'd like to restore it to my MBPro. But not over top of my MBPro data.\nIs it possible to connect the iMac's TM drive to the MBPro and rebuild my Documents folder in to a random location (not over top of the MBPro's Documents folder) on my MBPro?\n\nA: You can navigate your backup drive in the Finder. \nMount it, go to the Backup folder > [name of machine] > [name of volume] > latest > Users > [user name] and restore the files you want.\n(You can also choose a date instead of latest to restore earlier versions of the files/files that have been deleted.) \n\nA: You can use the Time Machine UI to restore from the backups of a different Mac by option-clicking the Time Machine icon in your menubar or right-clicking the Time Machine icon in your Dock, and selecting \"Browse Other Time Machine Disks\".  (See question 17 from the Time Machine FAQ for more details.)  You'll still need to navigate to \"Latest\" (or an earlier backup) as zevlag describes in his answer if you choose to do this.\nIf you do elect to use the comfort of Time Machine to choose what to restore, you'll want to read question 16 from the FAQ: \"How can I restore a file/folder to an alternate location?\"\n", "Q: Is it possible to send message to shared iTunes library owners on the network? I wonder if this is a way (or an app) to send instant messages to iTunes library shared owners, visible on the network.\nIt would be really handy to be allowed to communicate with them :-)\n\nA: I don't know about a specific app to send instant messages (I doubt one exists) BUT I like to rename my own shared library something akin to \"if you don't stop stealing my internet I'll steal your credit card info\".  Not that I actually know how to do that, but it usually scares them off my wireless.  \n", "Q: How do you view more than 20 podcasts in the iTunes app on the iPhone? When viewing a podcasts on the iPod app on the iPhone, there's an option below to \"Get more episodes\". When you click on that, iTunes app is launched, and you're shown the latest 20 episodes.\nIs there a way to view more than the last 20 episodes? I want to download even older ones.\n\nA: In the iPhone app, at the bottom of the list of episodes you will always find the link you can tap to \"Get More Episodes\". That is a hardwired link to that podcast's page on iTunes. This link will be shown regardless of whether or not there are more episodes actually available. \nThe podcast pages in the iTunes app and in iTunes on the desktop are the same and contain the same episode list. The episode lists themeselves are not controlled or determined by Apple or iTunes, but by the makers of each podcast. Podcast makers use different feed systems (like adlib or feeedburner) and they have different bandwith limitations depending on their own usage terms. \nPodcasts like This American Life, for example, in order to minimize bandwith costs, will only keep the latest episode on their episode list. So when you tap on \"Get More Episodes\" you will only get a list of one. Podcasts like This Week In Tech, for example, have bandwith sponsors that allow them to host most of their back catalogue. So when you tap on \"Get More Epidodes\", you will get a list of fifty or more. It basically all depends on how each podcast maker handles their feed and bandwith costs. \nHope this helps. \n\nA: It seems that the 20 limit you see is a limitation set by the podcast provider, not Apple. When I tried this with several podcasts, some had their full archive of podcasts available, while others limited it to the last 10, for example.\nYou could try to find the podcast in iTunes on your desktop and see if that limitation exists there as well. Most likely it will have the same 20 episode limitation. If that is the case, you could try going to the podcast's website to see if they have an archive of old podcasts available.\n", "Q: Terminal window as its own app During my work day as a software developer, I frequently have multiple Terminal windows open, each dedicated to a specific purpose and directory. I switch between them on a regular basis.\nI'd like to create entirely separate applications for each of them. This would give me several benefits over and above the normal windows I have now:\n\n\n*\n\n*Separate icons in the Dock\n\n*Separate icons in the Command-Tab task switching\n\n*I could pin each window to separate spaces.\n\n\nIs there some way to accomplish this?\n\nA: @mankoff got me on the right path. Here's what I had to do in order to get what I want:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy Terminal.app to a new file (ex: MyTerminal.app)\n\n*Change the icon of the app by:\n\n*\n\n*Copy an icon image to the clipboard from Preview \n\n*Right-click (Command-click) on the app\n\n*Select \"Get Info\"\n\n*Click the app icon in the upper left corner\n\n*Pasting the new icon image from the clipboard\n\n\n*Right-click on the App and choose \"Show Package Contents\"\n\n*Change the following values in Contents/Info.plist:\n\n*\n\n*\"Bundle display name\" -> \"MyTerminal\"\n\n*\"Bundle identifier\" -> a unique app-specific string. I chose \"ca.softcraft.myterminal\" as I own the domain \"softcraft.ca\"\n\n*Bundle name -> \"MyTerminal\"\n\n*Document Types -> Delete\n\n*URL Types -> Delete\n\n*Application has localized display name -> uncheck\n\n*Exported Type UTIs -> Delete\n\n\n*I deleted a bunch of the localization settings (Contents/Resources/*.lproj) as they're not necessary for me; I just need English\n\n*In Contents/Resources/English/InfoPlist.strings, I deleted the \"CFBundleName\" and \"CFBundleDisplayName\" override settings\n\n*In Contents/Resources/Initial Settings, I deleted all but one of the *.terminal files.\n\n*\n\n*I'm using a custom terminal setting, but there's no reason you couldn't use Basic\n\n*In Contents/Resources/Initial Settings/settings.plist, I made sure my \"Default Settings\" value was set to the name of my .terminal file\n\n\n*I set the values in the .terminal file to match what I wanted on open\n\n*\n\n*This is just a .plist file with a different extension; you can use Property List Editor to modify it\n\n*You can also set these using Terminal itself and then export them\n\n*I mainly changed \"CommandString\" to be what I want launched when I run the new \"app\".\n\n\n\nThis works excellently. The new \"Terminal\" apps are independent of each other and of the main Terminal. I can spin off new ones fairly quickly now.\nI also did this with Firefox to create a site-specific browser for my development website. (I had tried Mozilla Prism but found it too limiting).\n\nA: You could do something like this but with iTerm or Terminal.\n\nA: Just copy Terminal.app or iTerm.app and rename each copy ProjectA.app, ProjectB.app.\n", "Q: How to run Applescript on Disk mount I want to run an Applescript when I mount a specific disk. It isn't if the script is located on the disk or not, it should just run when OS X mounts the disk.\nI tried to accomplish this with folder actions, but it looks like it isn't possible to do it this way.\nClarification:\n\n\n*\n\n*I get home with my Macbook\n\n*I plug my USB Hub into the device\n\n*External disks are mounted in OS X\n\n*My Applescript gets run, does some stuff on those disks \n\n\nI want to automate step 4.\n\nA: You don't mention under which context you are mounting the disk, but what about going the other way and mounting the disk with the Applescript? \nI mention context because when mounting a disk with Applescript is the big caveat that if it is a network volume, and the network is password-protected, then the user name and password would have to be stored as plain text in the script for a seamless execution.\nUPDATE: A bit of searching found a similar question elsewhere. Essentially, a script can be made to do this by applying the script as a Folder Action to /Volumes: \non adding folder items to this_folder after receiving these_items\n    repeat with aItem in these_items\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n            if (local volume of aItem) and (name of aItem is \"[Name of Hard Drive]\") then\n                -- do something with the drive\n                -- eject aItem\n            end if\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend adding folder items to\n\n\nA: Use a Finder FolderAction that monitors /Volumes. When a new folder appears, that means a new disk has been attached. Now your FolderAction can run an Automator action, AppleScript, or shell script to do your thing.\n\nA: The likely most robust solution is to create a launchd job with the StartOnMount property set to -boolean YES:\n\nStartOnMount <boolean>\n  This optional key causes the job to be started every time a filesystem is mounted.\n\nThis is how Time Machine does it (see /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-attach.plist).\n\nA: MarcoPolo can do actions based on disk attachment.\n\nA: A solution would be to create an Automator application chaining the 3 following actions :\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Specified Finder Items \n\n*Mount Disk Image\n\n*Run AppleScript\n\n\nA: Depending on your needs, this can be applied to specific folder/mount points and is great to use when mounting a USB flash drive for example...\nhttp://www.jbmurphy.com/2011/07/15/os-x-running-a-script-when-a-usb-drive-is-inserted/\n", "Q: How to make an alias (Cmd-L) using command line?

I've got a rather peculiar problem. My wife's iPhone got stolen and we bought a new one from the insurance money. When trying to restore the backup file to her new phone, iTunes asks for the password:\nEnter the password to unlock your iPhone backup file.\nThe problem is, that she removed the password a long time ago. Hence she can not remember it. All we know is that it must be a number between 1111 and 9999.\nIs there any way to brute force this?

Are there any known issues?\n\nA: I haven't heard of any specific issues with 5.0.3 and 10.6.6. \nHowever, there are times when upgrades to Safari will break things like plugins or extensions. I recommend disabling all extensions and plugins via the Safari preferences. Then you can enable one plugin or extension at a time and visit a website that you know will crash your browser. If things work fine, repeat this process for each plugin or extension until you discover the one that is causing things to break. Once you find the culprit, you might have to wait until they issue a new version. \nHaving said all of this, there is a very good chance your crashes are related to Flash. Flash is a known vector for Safari crashes on Mac OS X and Apple has repeteadly stated that a majority of the crash logs they receive are Flash-related. \nEven if you were not experiencing these crashes, I would still recommend getting something like Click2Flash to disable Flash on all websites--this is a great way to get rid of pesky ads. This should considerably reduce the number of crashes in Safari, assuming what Apple says is true. With Click2Flash, you can always whitelist specific websites so you can unblock their Flash content or you can unblock Flash elements on a click-by-click basis (hehce the name, Click2Flash). \nHope this helps. \n", "Q: Is it safe to install Windows Updates on a Boot Camp'ed OS? I just installed Windows 7 on Boot Camp, and when I login to windows, it says that there are Windows Updates available. The problem is that one time when I tried to install these updates, it prevented Windows from starting up again. So I'm wondering if it's okay to run all of the Windows updates as they appear, if I have to avoid some of them, or if I have to wait until Apple releases a patch which would permit the updates to be installed without any adverse effects.\nHere is the series of events that occurred as I remember them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed boot camp\n\n*Installed Apple's drivers via a USB flash drive\n\n*Restarted\n\n*Connected to internet\n\n*Windows noticed that there were a few recommended updates and installed them.\n\n*Restarted\n\n*I manually checked for updates in Windows Update to see if there were any more, it showed 40 or so.\n\n*I began the update process.\n\n*While it was downloading and installing the updates, I ran Apple's Software Update. It showed that there was an update to Boot Camp (3.2, I believe). I didn't install it since Windows Updates was already in the process of installing updates.\n\n*Restarted\n\n*Windows didn't load, instead Startup Repair loaded which said that Windows was unable to load normally.\n\n*One of its suggestions was to perform a system restore, I approved this.\n\n*After some time, Startup Repair said that wasn't successful at finding a solution. (It's ambiguous as to whether or not the restore worked.)\n\n*Restarted\n\n*This time it launched Windows correctly.\n\n*I checked how many updates there were in Windows Updates, and it showed only 4.\n\n*I launched Apple's Software Update, and updated to the latest Boot Camp.\n\n*Restarted\n\n*This time when I checked for Windows Updates, it showed more than 40.\n\n\nMy guess is that the restore did work, since after restarting, Windows launched. Plus, it showed more than 40 updates left.\n\nA: For practical purposes, when you boot into your Boot Camp partition you are on a regular PC: All updates pushed thru Windows Update should work as expected. I have used Boot Camp since the beta period all the way to Snow Leopard and I have never experienced a situation like the one you describe. \nI believe that Windows Update will only push updates that are critical (like security updates) and everything else (like driver updates) is listed as optional. I recommend enabling the option that makes Windows Update prompt you whether or not it should install updates when available. That way if you are in doubt, you can always review and make sure any driver updates are not pushed into your system, and things like security updates are. \nIt might be a good idea to stick to the drivers provided by Apple. \nI am unsure why you had to manually install the drivers on a USB drive, since they are usually installed automatically from the Mac OS X DVD right after Windows completes its setup. I wonder if there is a particular situation with your system and that the fact you had to install the drivers separately is related to what is causing your hardware to be unreponsive now. \n\nA: You should be just fine to install Windows Updates.\nIt sounds like you have Apple updates already installed, which I would highly recommend before doing Windows Updates.\n\nA: The cautious Bootcamper will disable multi-touch prior to updating:\nThe Apple-authored driver appletmp.sys halts Windows 7 startup on Macbook Air\n\nA: There are lots of windows updates that can cause BOOTCAMP to stop working correctly on Apple Hardware. It is good practice to boot back into MacOS occasionally and run any updates on the MacOS side (which may include Firmware updates for the hardware).\nIt is a good idea to run Apple Software Update on the Windows side to also update any BOOTCAMP drivers specific to the Apple Hardware.\nI also disable Windows Update from downloading and installing Drivers.\n\nHow to stop updates for drivers with Windows Update using Group\nPolicy.\n\n*\n\n*Use the Windows key + R keyboard shortcut to open the Run command.\n\n*Type gpedit.msc and click OK to open the Local Group Policy Editor .\n\n*Browse the following path: Computer Configuration > Administrative    Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update.\n\n*On the right side, double-click the Do not include drivers with    Windows Update policy.\n\n*Select the Enabled option.\n\n*Click Apply . Click OK .\n\n\nMost other Windows Updates are installed as they become available.\nSome previously released Windows updates have broken Wifi as well as caused Bluetooth issues with Magic Mouse and Magic Keyboard devices (Currently fixed with the third party 'Magic Utilities'). Graphics drivers are usually the worst and it is best to stick with the Apple Supplied drivers, rather than using the GPU Manufacturer or Windows supplied drivers.\n", "Q: Can a MacBook Air use another computer's optical drive when running Windows on Boot Camp? I installed boot camp on a MacBook Air by following these directions. In step 2 under \"Step 4:  Install the Windows Support Software\", I did exactly as the guide said, and launched WindowsSupport/Boot Camp/setup.exe instead of WindowsSupport/setup.exe. I noticed that the latter has a Read Me.rtf associated with it which reads:\n\nDouble-click setup.exe, in the root level of this disc, to install the following:\n•   Boot Camp drivers, which allow you to use your Mac-specific hardware with Windows, including your Apple keyboard, mouse, trackpad, and built-in iSight camera. For more information on Boot Camp, see http://www.apple.com/bootcamp.\n•   Remote Install Mac OS X, which allows MacBook Air users on your local network to install Mac OS X using a Mac OS X installation disc in your computer's optical drive. For more information, refer to the MacBook Air User's Guide.\n•   DVD or CD Sharing, which allows MacBook Air users on your local network to use your computer's optical drive. For more information, refer to the MacBook Air User's Guide.\n\nI believe that by double-clicking the setup.exe in the Boot Camp directory, the first of these bullet points was installed. The second refers to something about installing Mac OS X, which isn't relevant to me. The third bullet point sounds like the exact opposite of what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to read a DVD off another computer, not have another computer read the DVD off of mine. Therefore, I don't think that it's a problem of not installing the right drivers.\nIs it possible to use the optical drive of other computers on the same network in Windows as I can do in OS X?\n\nA: Not as seamless as OS X, but you just share the optical drive via Windows File Sharing (SMB).\n", "Q: Can I override the error AutoCAD gives about my older video card? I have a macbook 2,1 upgraded to 4GB ram and 500 GB hard drive. When installing AutoCAD, it complains that i have an older video card. Granted, that is true, I only use autocad for 2d purposes only. Is there a way to override that error?\n\nA: Thanks to Asmus's suggestion I found that if you remove your graphic card's model from the file unspt_gfx_cards you can install AutoCad. So to recap:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the .mpkg package out of the DMG file to some place like your Desktop\n\n*Right click on the package and select 'Show Package Contents'\n\n*Browse to Contents/Resources/unspt_gfx_cards\n\n*Right click unspt_gfx_cards and open with textedit\n\n*Remove all lines that contain Intel or GMA(for your macbook) and save\n\n*Double click on the .mpkg to install without hardware restrictions\n\n\nNot sure if you will have any problems running Autocad but at least you should be able to install it.\n\nA: Yes, that would work but you still won't be able to use it as it will give a WHIP error.\nSolution: Buy a new i5/i7 Mac, or use BootCamp to boot into Windows XP or 7 and run from there.\n", "Q: How to start with a brand new battery? Is there a special procedure to be followed when installing a brand new battery ? \nLike \n\n\n*\n\n*discharging it completely, or not;\n\n*leave it fully charged for a certain amount of time,\n\n*etc...\n\n\n(It's a battery of a MacBook Pro)\n\nA: AFAIK, there's no special procedure for a new MB/MBP battery. I recently replaced my MBP's battery myself, and searched Apple support documents for care instructions, but I couldn't find anything other than the standard \"drain it once in a while.\"\nBtw, my new battery was completely discharged, and it took about 12 hours to fully charge it. I left it on charge overnight and started using the MBP as usual the next day.\n\nA: Calibrating your battery means you will preserve the battery life for longer.\nOn its own website Apple says that you should calibrate your battery during the first week and then once every month, and then whenever you purchase new batteries. \nSource: Apple Support\n\nA: Even better: http://www.apple.com/batteries/\nIt has a lot of good information which can be applied across the board. Although portables with built-in batteries are pre-calibrated and do not require the calibration procedure outlined in this article\n1- charge battery until it is full charged and let sit for 2-4 hrs fully charged.\n2- remove external power source and let unit run until you get the \"battery running on reserve\" message from the system (usually around the 2-5% mark).\n3- Allow the system to put itself to sleep at this point, or you can put the computer to sleep yourself (waiting for the front LED to ebb) and then remove the battery from the system and leave battery out of the computer for 2-4 hrs at 0% charge.\n3.1- I like to tell people that they could set their computers up to run over night playing a DVD with full brightness. This usually kills the battery quickly and then the battery and system will sit the rest of the night inactive (this is also a nice way to make sure the system isn't doing anything to data-critical during calibration).\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug the battery into unit and external power to the computer and charge battery to 100%. \n\n*That is it. Li-Ion batteries need to be calibrated only once. If used appropriately the battery life space (and charge capacity) will hold longer than manufacturer definitions.\n", "Q: In Mail.app, how can I set a recipient's default email address? When typing a recipient's name in the \"To:\" field, Mail.app will bring up an autocomplete menu showing all email addresses for that recipient (e.g., Home and Work). If I don't pay attention and just hit Enter or Tab to autocomplete the recipients name, Mail.app picks the first address.\nIs there a way to choose the default email address that Mail.app selects for the autocomplete of a recipient? I'm not sure if this settings resides in Mail.app or the Address Book.\nExample\nIn the example below, there are two email addresses for the recipient. Mail.app defaults to the Home email, whereas I'd prefer it to default to the Work email for this contact.\n\n\nA: Remove the email address you don't want to be the default from the 'Previous Recipients' list in Mail.app:\nMail -> Window -> Previous Recipients -> Search for Name\nThis will make the default (and much faster) first address the one in the Previous List and any others in the address book will be further down the auto-complete list.\nThis works until that recipient sends you a new email from that same address, which puts that email address back into the queue.\n\nA: You can if you have the contact in a group in Address Book. Select the group, then go to Edit > Edit Distribution List... You can select the contact's default email address (the default one is marked in bold). As far as I know, this only sets the default address when emailing that group, though. I don't know of a way to set a default address for a \"normal\" contact. (After trying to figure out a way off and on for several years, I'm inclined to say it isn't possible, but hopefully someone will prove me wrong.)\n\nA: What order are the addresses in in Address Book? If you put the work address first there, it might be on top in the Mail list and be the default selection.\n\nA: I had to perform the following steps to make this work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit addresses in Contacts using cut-and-paste to make the one I wanted as default at the top\n\n*Mail -> Window -> Previous Recipients -> Search for Name -> Delete\n\n*Send email to new default address\n\n*Restart Mail\n\n\nAll of which is a bit of a PITA, but at least it's working now. \n", "Q: Buy AppleCare for MacBook Pro in different country than I bought MacBook \nI bought a MacBook Pro 13\" in june 2010 in Poland. I want to buy AppleCare Protection, I'm going to Hong Kong where it is 50% cheaper than in Poland. So can I buy it there? Or are there any law/guarantee restrictions?\nMateusz\n\nA: I know of quite a few people based in the UK who have bought their Apple Care from eBay in the states.\n\nA: I purchased my Applecare from China (while I was living there), my MacBook came from Canada, and now I live in New Zealand, where I can still use my Applecare. \nMobile products (like MacBooks) have a worldwide warranty, and that extends to purchases for Applecare as well. Just make sure you are purchasing from a trustworthy seller and you should be set.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Is there a way to reach the multitasking bar on the iPad via a keystroke on the keyboard dock? When the iPad is plugged into the keyboard dock, you can reach the home screen by pressing the \"square\" button in the upper left corner of the dock's keyboard. Is there a keyboard analogue to the double-press that brings up the multitasking bar, or do you have to reach for the physical button?\n\nA: Double-hitting the Home key (at the Escape key place) will bring the multitasking bar much like the Home button on your iPad.\nConfirmed on my iPad Apple keyboard dock.\n", "Q: What replacement SMS/MMS app for iPhone will allow me to change convo color, etc? My best friend and a client of mine have the same name, and it's way too easy to accidentally click on the client when I'm having a more adult or humorous conversation with my buddy at the same time as my client. \nIs there a replacement iPhone texting app that uses the native SMS (I have unlimited texting plan so don't want to bother with giving all my contacts a new handle nor requiring them to download an app themselves), but allows a couple other features like choosing what color a contact's talking bubbles will be or choosing the messaging font?\nI really don't want to jailbreak if at all possible.\n\nA: There are loads of \"messaging\" apps on the App Store, however, none of them use SMS. And if they do, it's one-way, it's send only. All the rest of them are data calls using an external service that invariably requires registrations, and (in some cases) perhaps payment!\nThis is one of the infamous \"duplicates Apple functionality\" zones. There is one way in or out of SMS, and that's Messages.app built into the iPhone. It is unfortunate that messages can't be customized beyond how it works external to the app, and the minor details such as showing a subject field, counting characters, etc.\nWithout Jailbreaking, you will not find a full on frontend replacement for communicating via actual SMSes in the iOS App Store. Other, more \"creative\" solutions must be done here.\nPer @mankoff's comment on your question itself, you could perhaps find a better way to have his name displayed, be it by Nickname or other ways.\n", "Q: How can I wake up my Mac from sleep mode remotely? I use logmein to remotely control my computers.\nCan I wake up the Mac when it's in sleep mode so that it's offline to the outside world?\n\n\nA: From this post:\n\nMost modern computers offer a feature\n  called \"Wake on LAN\". This is designed\n  to allow a network administrator to\n  turn on a computer remotely, even when\n  it is turned off, by sending a \"magic\n  packet\". This is used, for instance,\n  to allow backup programs to run at\n  night.\nHere is a Python script that does this\n  (if your MAC address is01-23-45-67-89-0a:\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python \nimport socket \ns=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM) \ns.sendto('\\xff'*6+'\\x01\\x23\\x45\\x67\\x89\\x0a'*16, ('192.168.1.255', 80))\n\nOr you can use Wake550.\nor use this site.\n\nA: Historically, I've accomplished this by two means. First, both methods require you to check \"Wake for Network Access\" in System Preferences -> Energy Saver\n\n(1) If you open Finder, expand the \"Shared\" section if necessary, and connect to the sleeping computer!\nThis works occasionally, but not every time. The bonus is that (presumably) at this point, I'm doing what I needed to do anyways.\n(2) If that failed, I generally open Wake On LAN and manually send a Wake request to the computer.\n\nA: @Am1rr3zA, I had to add one line to your Python script to make it work, as documented on this page:\n#!/usr/bin/env python \nimport socket \ns=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\ns.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, 1)\ns.sendto('\\xff'*6+'\\x01\\x23\\x45\\x67\\x89\\x0a'*16, ('192.168.1.255', 80))\n\n\nA: You can also wake up your Mac over wireless.\nFirst, your Mac must support Wake on Wireless. Second, your router must support Wireless Multimedia Extensions (WME), also known as Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM).\nAfter your enabled WME on your router, you must enable \"Wake for network access\" on your Mac. Then check the MAC address of your wireless card of your Mac. Put your Mac into sleep. From a second computer log in to your router and with the WOL (Wake on LAN) option wake up your Mac wirelessly by entering the MAC address. \nRemember, not every router supports WME.\n", "Q: Apps rearrange themselves after iPhone restart Occasionally, after i do a forced reboot on my iphone (holding power and home) all the apps rearrange themselves to alphabetical order and it removes all my folders. Is there a way to fix this?\nI have a jailbroken iPhone 3gs 4.1.2 \n\nA: Since your phone is jailbroken, there's no telling what's installed on the phone, so getting help for the issue may be problematic.\nThat said, there is an option in Settings to reset your Home Screen, which is what you're seeing. My bet is there's a flag somewhere that does that when the phone is reset.\n", "Q: How to debug Detect Displays? Having trouble using an external monitor I have a MacBookPro (MacBookPro5,4) with the DVI output connection and I can't seem to get it to connect to my Dell Monitor.  I've tried using Detect displays and made sure the monitor is using the DVI input.  It says there's no power coming from the cable and enters power save.  Detect Displays does nothing.  Any ideas?\n\nA: A few steps to try:\nTry a different cable\nTry a different screen\nTry a different laptop/macbook \nIf you get success with one of these then the problem probably lies with whatever you left out, after that you'll have to try combinations of the above.  \n", "Q: Why does iTunes re-open after I quit the app? Whenever I quit iTunes, it restarts itself. I have iTunes 10.1.12 (the newest one) installed on my Mac.  I don't remember exactly when it started—with either version 10 or 10.1.\nIs there any solution to this?\nADDED\nIt was caused by the GimmeSomeTune, after reinstalling it, everything seems to working fine.\n\nA: I used to have this problem when I had SRS iWow installed in iTunes. Is that the case for you?\nIf not, do you have any other plugins installed?\n\nA: I've experienced this problem with iTunes. No matter how many times I quit the app it kept launching again. I believe it has something to do with the headphone jack and the way earbuds with remote controls can play or stop music. It seems like the headphone signal gets stuck in play mode.\nUnplugging the cord from my MacBook Pro's headphone jack and plugging it back in always solves the problem.\n", "Q: What apps are available for subscribing to podcasts directly on the iPhone I listen to a lot of podcasts - A lot of stuff from twit, cnet, smodcast and npr.  I sync my phone about once every two weeks or so which for a lot of my daily podcasts is not good.  For twit there's a decent mediafly app that is specifically for twit but it seems buggy - when you go back to listening to a podcast after stopping for a while it goes back in time and will skip back anywhere from 30 or so seconds to about 20 mins and  you then have to scrub to find out where you were.  There is also a standalone mediafly app that is supposed to be for alternate podcast locations but it doesn't seem to do a good job handling the RSS and misses quite a bit plus it has some of the same bugs as the twit version.  Also as with any background audio api (aside from the iTunes app) they never properly are able to display the right info on the lock screen - some times it shows the title of the app, sometimes it shows the last thing you were playing in itunes (even though it doesn't play that and plays what you want it to), sometimes it's blank - and it never shows the artwork.\nRight now I've resorted to subscribing via iTunes on mac, then on my iPhone go to the podcast, get more episodes and them download from there. It works but it sucks if I'm away from wifi when I want to do that as there is still the 20 meg limit.  I'd settle for a single download limit going away and a button to download all new episodes being wifi only\nWhat I would like ideally is to press one button that will download all of the latest versions of my podcasts to the itunes app - this isnt likely to happen.  \nFailing that I'd like to have an app that lets me do the same thing, download the latest episodes with a single button, delete older episodes automatically, play nicely in the background, and have a good browser/management interface.\n\nA: You could try Podcaster which does over-the-air podcast streaming.  \nCheck out the features\n\nA: Instacast let's you subscribe to podcasts, synchronize over wifi and 3G and allows you to cache (download) or stream episodes. \n\nA: Vemedio's Instacast app will do the trick. It's incredibly well-designed and allows you to add subscriptions from within the app and you can tweak the settings to allow downloading over 3G. \n\nA: I've been using Downcast recently and it's great! I can subscribe (either via search or directly with the RSS URL) and the app automatically downloads new episodes however I've configured it - via Wifi only, ever 4 hours, or with geofencing.  It handles automatic playlist building so that I don't have to switch files while I'm driving.\n", "Q: Is there any way to turn off the automatically opening window for a preview in Marsedit? Whenever I open a post to edit it a whole preview window opens up along with it. I find this effect disorienting. I looked in the preferences and couldn't find anything.

Or is my launchctrl command wrong in options?\n\nA: The immediate problem is that your .plist file isn't correctly formatted -- the contents of <string>...</string> should be encoded with HTML entities, i.e. & needs to be encoded as &amp; (note: you can check the format of .plist files with plutil -lint filename.plist).  But there are some other changes that need to be made...\nStarting programs with launchd is rather different than starting them from a shell.  The biggest difference is that from the shell, you want the program to go into the background and run independently of the shell, so you wrap it in nohup ... &.  With launchd, it's actually best for the program to stay in the \"foreground\" so launchd can keep an eye on it.\nAlso, the elements of ProgramArguments won't get parsed by a shell, so listing the command and its arguments with spaces between them doesn't work -- make each argument a separate element of the array.\nHere's my stab at a synergy .plist.  I haven't tested this, so it may need a little tweaking to work properly (see notes below):\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd >\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>local.synergy</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/usr/bin/synergys</string>\n        <string>-f</string>\n        <string>--config</string>\n        <string>/Users/USER/bin/conf/synergy.conf</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>Nice</key>\n    <integer>10</integer>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>AbandonProcessGroup</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThe last two keys above deal with how launchd should react if/when the synergys program exits.  By default, it kills any surviving subprocesses and launches a new instance; these two keys supress both parts, which may or may not be what you want.  Also, one thing this doesn't do that your version with nohup does is redirect stdin and stdout to nohup.out (in case the terminal goes away); instead IIRC launchd logs things that get sent to them.  If synergys is in the habbit of sending output, you might want to add something like this to the .plist:\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n    <string>/dev/null</string>\n    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n    <string>/dev/null</string>\n\nAlso, as mankoff said, you should put this in ~/Library/LaunchAgents so it'll be autoloaded every time you log in.  Oh, and you should probably add a local. prefix to the filename (as I did with the label) to conform to the reverse-DNS naming convention.\n", "Q: How can I activate my iPod if my PC is running Linux? I just bought an iPod, and when I turn it shows an image with the USB cable and iTunes. It wants me to plug it to a computer with iTunes? But I use Linux, what do I do?\n\nA: A few solutions, not all of them good:\n\n\n*\n\n*If possible, update to iOS 5 (probably at the Apple Store) and don't use iTunes.\n\n*Find a friend with a Mac or a PC and get them to activate it.\n\n*Go to the Apple Store (as Randolph said) and ask them.\n\n*Run Windows in VirtualBox (or another VM solution), and use iTunes from there.

I have issues with my iPod Touch 4G where it disconnects from the access point for no apparent reason, and I need to go into the settings app and toggle the airplane mode to get the wifi working again.  \nIs there an app that I could run to automatically turn the wifi off and then turn it on again so that I don't have to waste so much time opening the settings and toggling airplane mode?  I haven't been able to find one in the appstore.\n\nA: Not without a jailbreak.  If you get a jailbreak there are various ways to do things such as switch airplane mode on/off, adjust screen brightness, turn wifi/3G on or off.  The app SBSettings is one such example.  You'd be better off diagnosing your AP problem than jailbreaking your phone for just this feature though in my opinion.\n", "Q: Can I repair my system disk (10.6) by booting off a 10.5 install CD? I'm running Snow Leopard (10.6) and OnyX told me I need to boot from my install CD and use Disk Utility to repair my drive. (It wasn't any more specific as to what the actual problem was.) I can't find my Snow Leopard disc anywhere, but I've got a 10.5.8 disc here. Will it work too?\n(Just to be clear, I'm talking about a filesystem repair, not a permission repair. Repairing permissions with a Disk Utility from an older version of the OS won't work.)\n\nA: Can you boot into Snow Leopard at all?  If you can, try this command from terminal: \nsudo diskutil repairPermissions /\nBroken down this does the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo - run this command as superuser/admin\n\n*diskutil - run the diskutil program\n\n*repairPermissions - obviously this means to repair the permissions\n\n*/ - act on the whole file system\n\n\nIf you can't get into Snow Leopard, you might be able to get into single-user mode by holding ⌘+S on boot\nYou can run Disk Utility from within Snow Leopard but whether it can repair it will depend on what's wrong.\nYou can do a Repair Permissions on any disk, or a Repair Disk on any disk which is not your startup disk. If you need to do a Repair Disk, you will need to do that from your CD and I think the 10.5 disk would be OK to use for a Repair Disk when booted from, it may not do a Repair Permissions though.\nIt's worth trying the Repair Permissions first from Snow Leopard.

Somehow I have gotten my Mac Mini into a state where every time I press a modifier key - shift, option, command or control - it shows an image of the symbol of the modifier key around the upper right of the screen. This is quite annoying and I do not know what this feature is called so it is difficult for me to find information about it. How can I disable this \"feature\"?\n\nA: Go to System Preferences then select \"Accessibility\" then in both \"General\" and \"Keyboard\" sections, disable the sticky keys in the Keyboard and de-select the Sticky Keys in the Keyboard section.\n\nA: It sounds like you have the “Sticky Keys” feature enabled.\nTo control the setting, open the System Preferences application ( > System Preferences…), load the Universal Access preference pane, goto the Keyboard tab. You can turn “Sticky Keys” Off (or On) there. You may also want to disable the “Press the Shift key five times to turn Sticky Keys on or off” feature. Or, if you want the sticky feature without the display, just disable “Display pressed keys on screen” and leave it enabled.\n", "Q: What is it about 3G that kills the iPhone battery? Why does turning on 3G data make my iPhone's battery die faster?\n\nA: The 3G radio requires more power. If you live in a weak 3G signal area, it may also cycle a lot between EDGE and 3G; setting up the 3G connection draws more power. Finally, you may be able to save power by setting the iPhone to Fetch New Data less often (Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendar > Fetch New Data).\n\nA: Do you get less bars with 3G on than with Edge?\nIf you get less than a strong 5 bars, you phone will turn up the power on the radios (which will drain the battery faster).\nSo it could, in part, be due to your location (distance from the nearest cell tower, buildings in the way, etc.).\nFurthermore, a 3G radio uses more power to send data at the higher bandwidth.\n", "Q: can't get HTML to display in Apple Mail signature I'm stumped.

I have 355 notes on the iPhone, and 350 in Gmail.\nI seem to recall that after pressing the done button in the Notes application, the working indicator would appear showing that there is network activity (i.e. that it's syncing with Gmail). It no longer shows the spinner when I press \"Done\".\nI tried restarting the phone to no avail. I tried deleting an email in Gmail in case there is a 350 limit, but that didn't help either.

I'm running an iPhone 4 with iOS 4.2.1. My iPhone is connected to the internet via Wi-Fi.\n\nA: The problem is that Google's implementation of IMAP isn't really 100% IMAP, so it doesn't really support notes. I've been trying to get it to work for quite a while which ended up with me losing all my notes (although they may still be in the Google Mail archive somewhere).\nI've actually given up trying to sync notes between my Mac/iPhone/Google and have gone for the Plain Text app which stores the notes on DropBox, this seems to work so much better.

I also assign apps to specific Spaces based on the kinds of activities I do there.\nHere's how I've set up my 9 Spaces:\n\n*\n\n*Space 1: GTD (OmniFocus, Livescribe)\n\n*Space 2: Email + Calendar (Mail, iCal, Google Voice Fluid Window)\n\n*Space 3: Photos (Aperture)\n\n*Space 4: Reading (Safari, Chrome for my daily RSS catchup)\n\n*Space 5: Music (iTunes)\n\n*Space 6: Social Networking (Twitter, mostly, but I often do all of my social networking reviews in a quick 20-minute session and will open some browser windows here to do it)\n\n*Space 7: Financial (Quicken Essentials, browser page for Xero.com, the online accounting service I use for my business)\n\n*Space 8: Utilities (1Password, CrashPlan, SuperDuper, etc.)\n\n*Space 9: Working (An empty space I leave for whatever I'm working on)\n\nSome apps I set to be available across every space, such as Skype. Others, such as the Finder, Safari or Chrome, are not assigned at all, and can appear in whatever space is currently active.\nTo really make Spaces work for me, here are some of the things I do.\n\n*\n\n*Use HyperSpaces. Hyperspaces is a fantastic utility that adds some of the features to Spaces that Apple should have built into the OS. There's lots of things it can do, but I use three things in particular. First, I use it to make every Space look different. I'm not a fan of distracting wallpaper, so I have chosen a simple background and then use Hyperspaces' ability to color them to apply a hue to each one. At a glance, I can see which Space I'm in. Green for Utilities, Purple for GTD, etc. I also name each Space and display it in the lower right corner of the desktop. I use the name from the list above. It's another simple visual clue as to where I am. The latest version can also show it in the Menu Bar icon, which is good, too, and has the benefit of not possibly being obscured by a window. Finally, I set the animation between Spaces to be very quick. I still like to have it on so I know I've switched a space, but I don't need a lot of fanfare when it happens, so I drag that slider way to the left.\n\n*Alfred. Alfred is an excellent app launcher that I've started using in the past year or so. Being able to quickly launch or switch to an app is what prevents you from having to search through your Spaces, and Alfred is key to that for me. There's nothing magical about Alfred here, though, so any launcher will do: QuickSilver, Launchbar, etc.\n\n*QuickSilver Triggers. Even though I use Alfred, I also run QuickSilver for the one thing Alfred cannot do: assign keyboard shortcuts to launch apps. QuickSilver calls them Triggers and I've set up a bunch. Without hunting through my Spaces, I can jump between Mail (trigger: ⌘OptionShiftM), iTunes (trigger: ⌘OptionShiftU) and Safari (trigger: ⌘OptionShiftS) in seconds.\n\n*Keyboard Shortcuts. ⌘1–9 switches between Spaces, and I use this all the time to move not only between Spaces, but since the frontmost app gets activated when the Space appears, it's often how I switch between apps, too.\n\n*Moving Windows. Sometimes a window will open inside the current Space, but I want it somewhere else. Happens all the time with Safari windows, for example. The fix is easy, though: just click and hold on the title bar of the window, then press the ⌘1–9 for the Space you want to move it to and zip, off it goes. Great way to keep your Spaces clean and clutter-free.\n\nAs I say up front, Spaces isn't perfect, but with some effort, I've managed to make it work for me. I hope that some of you find this helpful.\n\nA: I too experimented with Spaces when I first got 10.6 and found it a little unweidly. I think I would prefer it more if I could \"lock\" myself to a space for a time. So that Cmd-Tab didn't jump around spaces, but instead only let me switch between Windows in my current space. The jumping around was a bit nauseating.\nNow I run a 2-space setup. I have a work space and then I have a space where I throw stuff I don't really interact with. Like my VMWare Fusion player running a Linux machine I'm doing dev work on, it's over in the second space right now because I just ssh in to it from iTerm2. And I'll put remote desktop sessions in that second space -- stuff I'll visit occasionally and don't want cluttering up my main work space (because remote desktop, VNC session windows are annoyingly large).\nBut everything I'm interacting with (Mailplane, iTerm2, Chrome, Skype, TextMate) they're all on my primary space.\nI do keep different backgrounds on each space so they're easier to identify when I'm Cmd-Tab'ing around and shifting spaces.\n\nA: When I first got OS 10.5 I experimented with spaces, one for email/calendar/Skype etc, one for photography stuff, one for development stuff and one for everything else.\nHowever I found it wasn't too easy to work with so went back to one desk top and used hot corners/Expose and Alt-Tab for application switching, personally I find this a lot easier to work with, but all you can do is try these things out.\n", "Q: What's kern_sploit proccess that apears in my iPhone 4? After jailbreaking iPhone 4, I was noticed that some processes were added to the process list, like kern_sploit. What is this?\n\nA: It's Greenpoison's exploit. It's legit. According to the GitHub source, Snowbreeze installs it.\n", "Q: Is there somewhere I can write my name on iPod touch, for if I lost it? Where in my iPod Touch I can write my name and phone number, so if I lost it or it been stolen and found by the police (as I read that happened), someone could call me to go get it back?\n\nA: No, but you can create an image that has your name and contact info on it, then use that as your lock screen wallpaper.\nYou could also create a note on the device or an \"emergency/lost\" contact in the address book, but both of those require you to not use a passcode to use the device. A wallpaper with contact info works even if the person who finds your iPod can't unlock it.\n\nA: If you are really fussed about this then you can go to an engraver and get your name and phone number engraved on the back.\n\nA: You can also install Find My iPod Touch if you have a 4th gen iPod Touch. I'm not sure if it works on earlier models, but it might.\nApple's page on Find My iPod Touch\n\nA: I put a sticker on back containing my work contact information in large print.  Easy to read even if the batteries are dead.\n", "Q: Where do you get games for the click wheel iPods? I've got an iPod classic, and I can't for the life of me find any of the games that work with it on the iTunes Store.\nI know they are there, because I've seen them recently I just can't find them.\n\nA: Open the iTunes store, click the triangle at the end of the App Store tab at the top, and choose iPod Click Wheel Games at the very bottom.\n\n", "Q: Entourage window resizing issue Could someone tell me how to retain the email window to the full page size eachtime I open entourage.?\nWhen I open the new email window it opens in a small window, in then have to drag the window to use it comfortably.\nI close down reataining these sizes and when I open the entourage later it always goes back to the small window!\nIt is driving me crazy?\n\nA: It's most likely that your Entourage preferences file is corrupted in some fashion. Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Entourage. \n\n*Navigate to ~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.Entourage.plist.\n\n*Move the file to the Desktop. \n\n*Open Entourage, resize the window to your preferred size. Entourage will automatically make a new preferences file. \n\n*Close and open Entourage again to test that the change sticks.\n\n\nIf all is well, you can trash the original com.microsoft.Entourage.plist file from your Desktop.\n", "Q: Is there any way to see what OS X is doing when it's booting up when no chime is played? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I see the system status during boot? \n\nI have had the hard drive in my iMac replaced and now I'm trying to restore it from my TimeMachine back up.

Have a look at this apple support document on what to do if this happens.\n\nA: RESET THE SMC. HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WORKED FOR ME\nThis is how to reset SMC on most modern Mac laptops, none of which have a removable battery:\n-Shutdown your MacBook Air / MacBook Pro\n-Connect the power adapter to the Mac\n-On the MacBook / Pro’s keyboard, hold down the Shift+Control+Option keys and the Power button at the same time\n-Release all keys and the power button at the same time – the little light on the MagSafe adapter may change colors briefly to indicate the SMC has reset\n-Boot your Mac as usual\n\nA: I ran into the same issue on my MBP 2012 machine. Had an attempted dual-boot setup go south on me and re-format my entire drive, so even lost the recovery partition. \nI attempted what @IanC described in his comment above - after booting into the internet recovery system and re-installing Mountain Lion (that's what I was offered by the recovery tool!), I did a first boot into the OS, but did not bother proceeding through the setup wizard. I rebooted into the now restored local recovery partition and did a Time Machine restore from my backup drive. \nIt appeared to complete successfully, but I had the same problem where the progress bar reached the end on the boot screen, but the machine never finished booting. No resetting of PRAM or SMC helped either.\nIn the end, I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Started from scratch again with the internet recovery\n\n*Re-installed Mountain Lion from there\n\n*Upgraded that to El Capitan\n\n*Re-booted into the local recovery partition\n\n*Restored from TM\n\n\nSuccess!\nOne minor note is when performing the TM restore the second time, I selected the second last restore point rather than the last, just in case it would make a difference. I am assuming the El Capitan upgrade was the actual solution, but in the interests of completeness, I thought this worth mentioning also, in case it is materially significant.\n", "Q: How does Office 2008 for Mac store its Recent items? I don't have access to Office 2008, but require the information for a project I'm working on. I'm mainly interested in Word, Excel and Powerpoint.\nThis is the information I have gathered so far...\nThe preference file is: ~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office.plist\nThe property keys take the form:\n2008\\File Aliases\\{APP}{n}\n2008\\MRU Access Date\\{APP}{n}\nwhere {APP} represents an Office application, and {n} represents a number starting from 0.\nThe applications are represented by the following values:\nMSWD (Word)\nXCEL (Excel)\nWhat value represents PowerPoint?\nIn the property list I've seen, the numbers represented by {n} range from 0-10 (11 items).\nIs 10 the limit? or is this unrestrained?\nFinally, I've noticed that Office 2011 does not add its Recent Items to the Apple System menu:\nApple -> Recent Items\nIs Office 2008 the same?\n\nA: At least on my machine, this is what I'm seeing:\n\n\n*\n\n*PPT3 does appear to be the PowerPoint value\n\n*I have lots of items.

How can I enter in the enter in the Apple symbol () in an application such as text edit?\nIIRC, Safari automatically converts this symbol when it sees the text &apple;.\nUpdate: Does it exist in the Edit > Special Characters... list?\n\nA: Neil's ⇧ + ⌥ + K might work in (presumably) the US, but the exact combination is keyboard layout specific. In addition, some keyboard layouts — Thai, for example — might not even have the symbol available.\nE.g. I'm using a Finnish keyboard layout and  is typed simply by ⌥ + A.\nTo find this and other symbol shortcuts, you can enable the keyboard & symbol menulet from Preferences → Keyboard and use the menulet to open a virtual keyboard. Pressing any modifier key, or modifier key combination, will change the keys on the virtual keyboard accordingly. For example, here is how the virtual keyboard looks with Finnish layout while option/alt is being pressed:  \n\nTo find the  from Special characters menu the fastest way is to type f8ff to the search box (this is its unicode-code; the  hasn't any other name assigned). \nOther way is to change the view to glyphs or to code tables[1] from the drop-down list and browse the for the symbol manually — but this is not exactly user-friendly or fast, unless you know where to look for.\n\n[1]: I don't know for sure if these are exact translations as my UI is also in Finnish. However, the items are (respectively) last and third-last in the list.\n\nA: ⇧+⌥+K will type the Apple logo. \n", "Q: Does PlainText transmit data securely? Does the iPhone App PlainText transmit data securely (i.e. does it use SSL?), or it there a risk of my data being read by third parties when I sync with dropbox?\n\nA: On dropbox's web site, it says:\nAll transmission of file data and metadata occurs over an encrypted channel (SSL).\nFurthermore, data send over the 3G cellular connection uses a 3G over-the-air encryption protocol (which will likely be unencrypted for forwarding to the internet past the cell tower).\n\nA: I emailed the company, and according to them:\n\nPlainText syncs using the provided Dropbox SDK, which specifies\n  SSL/https\n\n... meaning that everything is transmitted securely.\n", "Q: What Math/Calculator software is available for the iPod touch?

It's an iOS emulator for the HP-41CX calculator, and is very faithful (except for having way more memory than the original): for example, synthetic programming is supported. I have not found an HP-48 emulator for iOS yet.\nI have i41CX+ installed on my (second-generation) iPod Touch. It's probably overkill for the uses I have for a calculator these days, but it works the way I expect a calculator to work.\n\nA: I use (and rate) Missing Calculator, although by the looks of things it isn't in the App store (UK) any more..\n", "Q: How to \"synchronize now\" the ipod touch with google calendar? My ipod touch synchronized well with google calendar. But I would like a \"synchronize now\" button, is there something like that?\n\nA: It's possible that, for some reason, push can't go through. In those situations, your iPhone will fall back on the fetch schedule. Go to Settings->Mail, Contacts, Calendars->Fetch New Data and make sure that you select the most frequent Fetch, which is 15 minutes. It's certainly a far cry from the instantaneity of push, but you shouldn't have to wait more than 15 minutes for stuff to come through.\nAlso, you should check under Advanced just in case your schedule for your Google account was changed for some reason - it should be \"Push\".\n\nA: Have you followed the instructions here?  My understanding is that if you set up your google account for 'Push' then your calendars should be synced immediately as long as you have an internet connection at the time.\n", "Q: Virtual Box on an non-intel Mac is it possible to install VirtualBox on a non-intel Mac ?\nMy configuration : G5 with Mac OS X 10.5.8\n\nA: No as VirtualBox does not emulate the CPU but virtualizies it as described by Oracle. \nYou would need to find Virtual PC or Bochs (I have used both in the past) or others in a list from www.macwindows.com\nHowever now getting an extra second hand intel box might well be the easiest thing to do and would definitely provide the faster solution.\n\nA: No you can't unfortunately.

I installed rEFIt in order to install boot camp via a USB key. Now that Boot Camp is installed, I no longer need rEFIt, so I'm trying to uninstall it. \nI followed the uninstall directions for \"Removal when using rEFItBlesser\", because when I installed it, I ran \"rEFIt.mpkg\" (i.e. the installer package). I trashed the \"efi\" folder, and \"rEFItBlesser\". I restarted the computer twice, and the menu still appears when the computer starts up.\n\nA: It seems that the solution is the same one listed there under \"troubleshooting\". Initially I was thrown off by the wording used. I thought that \"If Mac OS X no longer starts up..\" meant OS X didn't start up at all, but what it really means is \"If Mac OS X does not start up automatically instead of rEFIt...\"\nI just followed the directions listed there and now it uses the default boot sequence.\n\nA: Here is a video link that I hope you find helpful:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxq8nLX-Uzw\n", "Q: Can Parallels and VMware Fusion use the same boot camp volume?

My question is if both of these applications can use the same Boot Camp partition without modifying it; such that both could be installed at the same time without it affecting the other.\nUpdate: I installed the VMware Fusion trial version. In order to enable many of VMware Fusion's features, they require that you install VMware tools on the virtual machine. I'm not sure if its compatible with Parallels or if Parallels has its own software they recommend you install on the virtual machine as well.\n\nA: Yes.

Image the drive.\nThen get yourself some data rescue software (I like Data Rescue 3 -- but there are many out there), and run your recovery software on the image.\nWorst case scenario is you send the hard-drive (that you've manipulated very little since you've been operating from a disk image) to a recovery centre.\n", "Q: Select all songs as compilations How do I select all songs as compilations in my iTunes. I don't want to modify each song one at a time, I have about 2000 songs.\n\nA: Command+A -> Command+I -> Options -> Part of Compilation -> Yes -> OK\nNot sure why you'd want to do this and I didn't test it because I don't want to do this to my library but that should be it.\n", "Q: What are some reasons to run Windows on a Mac? I'm interested in knowing why one would run Windows on a Mac. I may be required by my school to do so, and I'm curious about potential reasons.\nSo, what are some of the reasons to run Windows on your Mac?\n\nA: As a professional software developer, I often use various versions of Windows inside VMWare on a Mac. Reasons include:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's easy to back up the virtual machine, so if it gets malware, I can just snuff and restore it.\n\n*If I need to run a Windows program or utility, it can be a lot quicker to start up one of my virtual machines on an already-running Mac than to start a physical Windows computer\n\n*All of my non-Mac Intel machines are usually already doing something useful running Linux, so I'd have to bring one of those down to run Windows on a physical box.\n\n*Most of my Windows software development is maintenance of legacy code from many years ago, and coding/running/testing it in a virtual machine is often faster than the hardware it was originally developed on.\n\n\nAlso, Intel Macs simply are very high-quality Windows machines- Apple's quality control is the best in the industry. Also, Boot Camp doesn't use the stock drivers from NVidia and so on; Apple has their own team that writes Windows drivers custom-tuned for their specific hardware, and they're really great.\nHow great?\n\n\n*\n\n*When Apple first started shipping Intel-based MacBooks and MacBook Pros, a lot of Windows magazines had articles like, \"The best Windows laptop you can buy is a Mac\"\n\n*My wife and a friend are gamers, and my wife's MacBook Pro runs rings around his custom Windows gaming laptop\n\n*When my wife's desktop gaming rig croaked recently, she almost got a Mac Pro to replace it\n\n\nA: the main reason might be compatibility:\nThere is a lot of software for MacOS X and you can do nearly everything with a Mac and there is software which is even unique on MacOS X.\nOn the other hand, there is \"standard\" software for Windows in some areas e. g. \n\n\n*\n\n*in engineering \n\n*\n\n*CAD\n\n*CAE and \n\n*simulation software \n\n\n\nwhich does not exist afaik for MacOS X.\nConverting and exchange with Mac-based applications might be possible, but for such complex data formats like 3D CAD data there is always some (or much) \"loss\" by converting from one format to another, so it's sometimes the best if everyone uses the same software and maybe even the same version.\nIf somebody needs to be compatible to such a software, MacOS X might be only the second (or even 3rd) choice (as UNIX or Linux might be more \"compatible\"), unfortunately.\n\nA: First of all, I would investigate the reasons behind your school asking you to use Windows. It may just be that they're unaware that a lot of Mac software can handle 'Windows files' such as .doc, .xls, .zip (!). Indeed, there's a ton of open source software such as OpenOffice that works equally well on both platforms.\nThe reasons I have to boot into Windows (using Boot Camp):\n\n\n*\n\n*To use Windows itself, for learning or understanding the new features.\n\n*Software that just has no Mac or online equivalent. There are very few of these but if you've been using a legacy application such as QuickBooks account software for 5 years, it's hard to move away.\n\n*Internet Explorer, to see its' different behaviour.\n\n*Games\n\n*Weird hardware devices where there's no Mac drivers available. Usually, this is a sign of a poor design decision, but there are some obscure bits of hardware that can be manipulated by Windows by not by Mac.\n\n\nA: At work, it's usually because the company has some application, maybe in-house developed or maybe bulk licensed, that's Windows only.  Or the company uses some web service that is only certified to run on MSIE, not Safari (et.al.)\nAdded:\nOne company I was visited solved this problem neither by running Windows on their Macs, nor by providing everybody with a Windows PC, but by running virtual instances of Windows PCs (somewhere in the server room or cloud?), and using Remote Desktop apps on Macs and Linux desktops to view the Windows desktops and/or run Windows apps.  (It may have been either a VMWare or Citrix infrastructure on the back end.)\n\nA: Microsoft OneNote - It's not in the Mac Office suite.\n\nA: *\n\n*Games\n\n*Internet Explorer: If you are a web developer and want to test your website in IE (which you have to).\nAlso some corporate intranet applications work only on IE(6/7/8 compatibility mode).\n\n*Microsoft Office: Yes, there is a version for the Mac, but some prefer the Windows version (I remember reading sometime before somewhere, (unable to find the link) that the Windows version is better). Also, people like me who have a Windows PC (my wife's) and a Macbook Pro at home, I can buy one Office Home and Student edition (it comes with licence for 3 installs) and use it on both.  \n\n*Learning Windows specific technology. For instance I want to learn C#. C# is best learnt in Microsoft Visual Studio (IMHO). \n\n*Games\n\n*Games\n\n*Games\nThere was something else too... oh yeah, games.\n\nA: Developing and running .Net applications.\nAnd, no, Mono is not a viable alternative, and likely will never be while MS keeps extending .Net.\n\nA: Work VPN, aventail, not supported on Mac by IT department (even though it sort-of works on a mac...getting IT to do even basic troubleshooting impossible...frustrating as heck)\nAlso .NOT (sorry, .NET) corporate applications, and communication with the Windows drones.\n", "Q: Mac Mini fan gone furious \nsomething awful happened to my mini.\nI placed it under my aircon, and for some reason, the aircon started to drip.\nright on the fan grills on the mini.\nnot a lot, probably like an eighth of a glass of water.\nso, i rushed to unplug everything from the mini.\nand leave it to dry.\nproblem is... when i plug it all in, i start with the power cable.\njust when i plug it, the fan gone furious. like 6000rpm furious.\nthe state of the mini is currently OFF.\nthat's one thing i'm confused about.\nsecond, after a while the fan speed goes down..\nbut never really really low.\neven when it's off, and the room is cold (not just cool) it's still noticeably whirring.\nand the mini is still OFF.\nwhen i turn it on.. after just 15-20 minutes the fan goes furious again.\nlike 6000rpm.\nwhat can i do to fix this, and how much damage have i done.\nand to answer a few preliminary questions.\nthe mini is a late 2009 mini, C2D, 4GB ram, and usually running on 18C room.\nand i've never upgraded any hardware, RAM, HDD, everything.. still as it was.  \n\nA: Since it got wet, I'm inclined to believe this is hardware damage.\nI recommend that you give it another few days to dry, without use. Keep it completely unplugged for this time.\nIf that doesn't work, run Apple Hardware Test. If it finds problems, take it to the Apple Store for service.\nGood luck.\n\nA: After you've waited for it to dry as Nathan said, if the problem persists you can try to reset the SMC, as it's a common solution for fans not behaving correctly.\n\nA: Is it the older, taller Mini or the newer shorter one? Also, did you take it apart at all while you were drying it?\nIf the answer to both of these questions is \"Yes,\" then you may have unplugged the fan control cable. Unplugging this cable makes the fan run constantly. You will need to open the case back up and make sure that the little, tiny cable on the front of the logic board is properly plugged in.\n", "Q: Last import in Address Book A little history: I had a old Nokia 5310. Lost it. I had the contacts backed up in a .vcf file. So imported them to a old Sony Ericsson W700i. Used the W700i for sometime, added some more contacts.\nNot got a new Nokia C5. Wanted to import all the contacts to the Nokia and at the same time add them to Address Book so that I can manage all contacts from Address Book and sync with the new Nokia. (Address Book has some old contacts, that are not required to be on the phone but nevertheless necessary, my wife's contacts imported sometime before etc). (Thanks for reading)\nI exported the contacts from the phone to a .vcf file and imported it in Address Book.\nWanted to move only these contacts to the Nokia. So thought will open Last Import and sync all of them with the new phone.\nBut looks like Last Import holds all of my imports, not just the most recent one.\nI tried to select a group and then import, but the import does not happen to the group. They are imported to the \"All Contacts\".\nIs there any way to get/select only the most recent imported contacts?\n\nA: Are you comfortable with AppleScript? If so, you could write a script to export the contacts created after a date of your choosing.\n\nA: A smart group with a rule of \"card was updated after (date)\" would get you close to the correct list.  Also, in Lion, Last Import resets the list correctly for each import performed.\n", "Q: Accessing files from Mac OS X in VMWare Fusion? I'm running VMWare Fusion on a Boot Camp partition. When I launch the virtual machine, I see the C:\\ drive which is the BOOTCAMP partition, but I don't see the other hard drive (D:) which is visible when launching boot camp directly. I realize that I can drag and drop files between OS X and the virtual machine, but I was wondering if this is the only method of accessing OS X files from the virtual machine. Is there no way to have it show the second hard drive so that every file I want to access doesn't have to be copied over?\n\nA: I recommend using the Shared Folders feature in VMware Fusion. \nI have a Boot Camp partition as well running Windows 7. When I need to access files that are on the Mac OS X side from within Windows, I go the VM preferences and enable each folder I want to share (you can share multiple folders form different locations). All shared folders will then be shown on the Z:\\ drive in Windows. \nHope this helps.  \n", "Q: Is there a way to assign a keyboard shortcut Outlook 2011 to move email to a specified folder? In Microsoft Outlook 2011, I'd like to be able to quickly highlight an email and move it to a folder (e.g. \"Processed\") with a simple keyboard shortcut.\n\nA: By default there isn't a shortcut to move an email to a specific folder. You can use SHIFT+⌘+M to choose the folder. \nHowever, you can create an Applescript and then map that to a shortcut through System Preferences > Keyboard. Here is a sample script that will move emails to a folder named Processed (here is the original source if you would like to learn more). \nYou can save the file wherever you'd like, but the default Outlook scripts are saved in:\n ~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Outlook Script Menu Items/\n\nNote: as of Office 11 SP2, this location has been changed to: \n ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Microsoft/Office/Outlook\\ Script\\ Menu\\ Items/\n\nTo create the shortcut, open up the Keyboard Shortcuts panel, and under Application Shortcuts hit +. It will give you a list of applications to choose from (Outlook 2011), and then for the menu title make sure you choose the name of the name of the script as it appears in the menu. \n\nA: This is pretty easy in the version I'm using (14.4.6). Simply select a message and hit the Move button. Move the message to whichever folder you desire. This will create a menu item for moving to that folder in the dropdown.\nOpen up Keyboard Preferences and select App Shortcuts. Add a new shortcut for Microsoft Outlook. Title it 'Archive Folder Name (Name of your account)' and then select your shortcut.\nNow, go back to Outlook and click the Move button, you will see your shortcut is now appended to the new menu item that was created earlier.\n\nA: There's a simpler way with just adding a keyboard shortcut to the app, outlined here.\nI'm a big GMail user, and I wanted to map a keyboard shortcut to move a message to an \"Archive\" folder that I'd created within Outlook on the Mac, just like GMail has an archive keyboard shortcut. That article worked for me.\n\nA: As per akpd's answer but the directory (as of Mac Office 2011) for the Outlook script items is:\n~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/Outlook Script Menu Items\n(I don't have enough rep to just comment this)\nThe Applescript should be saved as a script bundle (\".scptd\") and a shortcut can quickly be added by adding shortcut strings to the filename e.g. \"\\cm\" on \"Move to Processed\\cm.scptd\" will activate with Control-M.  The examples of this technique are in the Automator Workflow examples \"Sample Automator Workflows\" provided by Microsoft.\n", "Q: Prevent Bonjour Announcements Over OpenVPN We have an OpenVPN server at work, which I use frequently to access private work resources. When I do, the \"Shared\" listed in Finder populates with all the automatically announced servers/resources at work, but the reverse is also true. My local resources appear to anyone at work, and/or on the VPN as well.\nIdeally, I would like to prevent my announcements from going over the VPN link, but would like to have the shares physically at work available to me while on the VPN. If the only method is to disable Bonjour (temporarily), I'll be fine with that, but is there a way to make it only one-sided?\nAnd of course the master question: How do I accomplish this, at all, in the first place.\n\nA: How about blocking udp traffic on port 5353?\n\nA: Usually, Bonjour only works on the local network and only its extension Wide-Area-Bonjour works through VPNs. Did you configure your Computer to use that or did you setup your router to handle that? Also, which other resources appear for the others at work?\nBut anyway, you don´t have to have File Sharing \"turned on\" on your computer (which will then cause the broadcasting of your computer´s name over Bonjour) to access others, so just turn off the services you don´t want others to see and you should be good.\n\nA: If you are using OpenVPN, I assume you are using Linux on the server side.\nSince OpenVPN is working in layer 2 bridge mode, applying a standard filter with iptables will not work. iptables works on layer 3 and your VPN is before that in the layer 2.\nThe trick is to use ebtables wich is like iptables but at layer 2.\nYou can block UDP port 5353 with ebtables.\n", "Q: iTunes keeps respawning \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhy does iTunes re-open after I quit? \n\nHey,\nI have some rather annyoing behavior with my system:\nWhenever I close or kill -9iTunes it just keeps coming back up.\nAny ideas how I can find the root cause of this?\n\nA: Do you use any add-ons / controllers for iTunes, like Media Servers (eg. Plex, Front Row) or others for global hot-keys or song notifications? Sometimes these apps use applescript, which tends to launch applications if they´re not already running.\n", "Q: Can I stream movies from external drive to the new Apple TV? Is it possible to stream movies from an external hard drive (attached to a Mac Mini) to an Apple TV2? The movies on my external drive show up in iTunes on my Mini, but the Apple TV says there are no videos in my library. I don't have room to store them on my internal drive, but it seems like that might be the only way to get them to stream. I have \"Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library\" unchecked. Any thoughts?\n\nA: My iTunes music folder and all of my movies (in separate folders) are on an external drive.  In fact, it's a NAS RAID box, but it's mounted on my Mac mini.\nYou just have to load the movies into iTunes.  When you do, they'll be visible to the Apple TV.  Of course, they have to be in the MP4/M4V favored by Apple.  If you want to watch AVIs, etc., you'd have to \"hack\" your Apple TV.  Haven't done this, but it sounds pretty easy these days.\nMaybe we'll get an ATV Apps Store soon, and it will be easy to load other apps and stream all sorts of stuff to the ATV...\n", "Q: Cut command shortcut problem I cannot find the way to change the key shortcut for cut command on my macBook pro.\nWhere can I change that setting?\nI can't find it with the rest of the key command preferences.\n\nA: On my machine, the following works:\nGo to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Application Shortcuts. Press the [+] button. Select All Applications, type Cut, press your shortcut, and press Add.\nNote that on systems still running OS X 10.8 and earlier, it's: System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Application Shortcuts\n\n", "Q: Are there any iPhone apps which can display/edit OPML documents? I'm looking to view/edit OPML files on the iPhone/iPad. Is there an app that can do this?\n\nA: Depends on what you want to do exactly but since OPML is just another Markup Language you can use any text editor or maybe one that's also able to highlight XML. You could also try online tools such as google docs, tho I couldn't myself. Here's another way to read only OPML using iGoogle.\nI'll also give a shot and guess what kind of OPML you'd be using and suggest this app.\n\nA: Take a look at CarbonFin and the website https://cfoutliner.appspot.com/ (accessible on any iOS device)\n\nA: Lots of iOS apps support OPML in different ways. All depends on what you want to do with it.\nFor editing the actual code, you could use Textastic with its super-nice syntax highlighting. Use the built-in XML syntax definition or easily add your own customized for OPML.\nFor editing it as a mind-map, check out iThoughts or MindNode.\nFor working with it in outline form, hey! There's OmniOutliner, CarbonFin or MagicalPad.\nAnd coming soon, but not quite yet, writing app Storyist will be supporting OPML. So you can import that finished outline and use it to start writing your novel, thesis, or crackpot manifesto.\n\nA: Outline pro is a really good app\n", "Q: VMWare Fusion is opening .docx files in Wordpad I enabled the VMWare Fusion setting Open your Mac files and web links using Windows Applications. When I double click a .docx file in Finder, it launches Wordpad in the virtual machine, instead of Word. If I open the file again, it launches Word. If I launch it a third time, it opens Wordpad. It keeps alternating between these two programs.\nOn Windows, I tried right-clicking the file and going to the \"Open With\" command. It lists both Microsoft Office Word and WordPad as Recommended Programs. There doesn't seem to be an option to remove WordPad from this list.\nWhen I launch the .docx file from inside Windows, it always opens it up with Word, leading me to believe that this is a VMWare Fusion bug and not a Windows bug.\nIs there any way to have .docx files only open up in Word?\n\nA: Take a look at these two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Problem with \"Always Open With\" in OS X\n\n*How to setup a default program opening an unknown file extension?\nIt sounds to me as if the correct application will launch once you tell OS X which application it should use.\n\n", "Q: Seeing the desktop while in Unity mode in VMWare Fusion? When I run VMWare Fusion in Unity mode, is there any way to see the desktop or access the files on the desktop? Or must I switch into Single Window/Full Screen mode?\n\nA: You can view the Desktop as a folder in Windows Explorer.\n\nA: You cannot view the windows desktop as the \"Desktop\" in Unity (As @mankoff said, you can open it as a folder). The intention of Unity is to Run Windows apps \"side by side\" with Mac apps. This means the Mac desktop is the desktop.\nI remember there was an option to \"Show taskbar in unity\" in a older version. Unable to find it in version 3 (did not look for long, anyway I think this is not very useful)\nBTW, the way I use VMWare is only for application installs. All my data still stays on my mac (in a special folder if required) but not inside the VM. Helps me back them up, email them if required (even when the VM is suspended). So I never felt a need to see the desktop.\n", "Q: Auto login boot camp partition in VMWare Fusion? My VMWare Fusion is set up to use a Boot Camp partition. Is there any way to have it automatically login to a user account when the virtual machine starts up, but still require a password when booting via Boot Camp?\nThe reason I ask is because when launching VMWare Fusion in unity mode, you always have to interact with the machine the first time it logs on. It would be nice if you can just run an application from the VMWare Fusion menu, and have it seamlessly startup the virtual machine, login, and launch the application without any interaction required.\n\nA: As the auto-login or password is in Windows, and Windows doesn't know if it is booted via BootCamp or VMWare, I don't think you can do this from the Windows side.\nIt doesn't seem likely, but perhaps you can set it to always require password, but then use AppleScript and VMWare, or Automator GUI Scripting, to enter the password for you.\n", "Q: How do I make an AppleScript file into a Mac App? I have an Applescript that simply opens a Dialog Box, asks for a user input and runs a Terminal Command and spits out the answer. It works great in AppleScript Editor yet I am trying to work out how I could package this Script File along with an icon to make a Mac App for my personal use. Thoughts.\n\nA: In El Capitan at least you can use osacompile, e.g:\nosacompile -o MyScript.app MyScript.scpt\n\n\nA: In Script Editor, select File > Save As and set File Format to Application. (In Mojave and later, the Save As choice in the File menu is not visible unless you hold down the Option key.)\nOpen Bundle Contents drawer and see the applet.icns file, copy your icon to that.\nSee \"Saving a script as an application\" in Script Editor help.\n\nA: to export an an application, do File -> Export and set the drop-down list to \"Application\"\n\nA: Open the information window for your Application cmd+i and drag your icon file (icns format) onto the top left default icon.\n", "Q: Is there a Simple minimalistic Twitter iPhone application? I am searching for an iPhone application that does not show or load the timeline. On my phone, I am just interested in tweeting text and/or photos, and consequently, that's what I want my twitter iPhone to do, nothing more, nothing less.\nNow I found a good app for just tweeting, but it doesn't let me tweet photos; it's called Birdhouse, it's a really good app. I also have instagram, but it resizes the photos and forces the user to add all kinds of effects. For mentions, which I also care about, I use Notifio which does an amazing job.\nSo is there an iphone twitter app that let's the user just tweet text and photos, AND that is up to date (by that I mean that it uses oAuth and has been updated once at least in the last three months)? Otherwise, is there a good minimalistic app that just let's users tweet photos with optional text (no effects, no bloat)?\n\nA: Found exactly what you are looking for. It's called SuperPost by, of all people lol,... MySpace. Needless to say, it's free and also can optionally post to Facebook & MySpace simultaneously. It's not too shabby actually.\n\nA: I like echofon and simplytweet. Both of which you can customize to your taste by disabling most, if not all, of other features.\n\nA: Weet & Twitterific are the most minimal of everything I have used. Weet is pretty barebones and lightweight, basically the iPhone version of Itsy. I'm a Tweetbot guy, which is a totally awesome app but it sounds like it does way more than you want.\n\nA: I would say that Twitterific is as close as you can get to minimalist for an iPhone Twitter App - http://twitterrific.com/iphone/\n\nA: If you don't like Instagram, there's also Picplz. It does not alter the image, nor does it force you to add a filter.\nBut it does not let you tweet just text.\n\nA: I would highly recommend Weet as a minimilistic replacement of the official Twitter application.\nHonorable mentions include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Icebird\n\n*Brizzly\n\nA: Personally, I love it when apps have as little chrome as possible. Two twitter apps that are gorgeous and minimalistic (and manage to retain tons of functionality) are Osfoora and Icebird.\nIcebird is great because it has little chrome and there are plenty of options (including picture and video uploading to flickr)\nOsfoora is great because of its intuitive jump screen, and its minimal tweet composition UI. They also make an iPad version that is absolutely stellar. \nBoth of these are paid apps though, but I wouldn't hesitate on the $2 or $3 purchase.\n"]
