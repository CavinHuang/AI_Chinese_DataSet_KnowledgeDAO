["Q: Moving to ssd: do a fresh install; or is \"dd\" of old hdd \"good enough\"? our generous management considers handing out SSDs to replace the HDDs in our laptops. \nI am told that SSDs will have the same size as the HDDs; so I am now wondering: should I simply use \"dd\" to copy my existing xubuntu 14.04 installation (and maybe then, afterwards do the tunings listed for that  related question)?\nOr are there any major \"technical\" advantages in doing a \"completely fresh\" installation of xubuntu on that SSD?\nIn other words: will doing such a \"full binary\" copy have any negative effects regarding SSD performance, caching ... ?\nEDIT no. 2: my current installation was created using the \"default\" ubuntu installer; meaning it uses LUKS and LVM.

Not even a second one and a third one would be.\nA MLC commercial SSD is going to surive between 2000-3000 full writes. Not to speak about SLC SSDs. \nWhat is relevant instead is how you will use the new drive over time. If the SSD is going to be subjected to a great number of Program/Erase cycles (e.g. creation / deletion / creation of files), its lifespan is going to decrease drastically.\nSo to sum up, I'd blindly go for the dd solution and rather pay attenction on how to not decrease its lifespan by making a clever use of it over time.\n\nA: There is a good chance to move all the data using LVM tools. There is short info on how to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get USB connector for your SSD disk and attach it to your laptop with SSD connected\n\n*Repartition your devices same way as your current disk (actually doesn't matter how, but your new LUSK partition should be same or bigger than your current LUKS partition\n\n*Copy your boot folder partition to new SSD partition. If your SSD detected as /dev/sdb you can follow this steps:\nsudo mkfs.ext2 /dev/sdb1\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\nsudo rsync -a /boot/* /mnt/\nsudo umount /mnt\n\n*Setup crypt partition on your /dev/sdb2 (second partition of new SSD disk) and attach it to your current VG (LVM volume group)\nsudo cryptsetup -y luksFormat /dev/sdb2\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb2 crypt_ssd\nsudo vgextend xubuntu-vg /dev/mapper/crypt_ssd\n\n*Move physical data from your current physical partition to new SSD physical partition (be sure it can be long, ensure you have strong USB connection to your SSD, NO INTERRUPTIONS should be happened)\nsudo pvmove /dev/mapper/sda5_crypt\nIt will automatically move all the data to your free SSD encrypted physical partition.\n\n\n*Since all the moving will be online you should check new UUID of boot partition\nsudo blkid\nFind there /dev/sdb1 (your new boot partition) and edit /etc/fstab /boot UUID entry accordingly (yes, all the files already on new SSD disk, next time you can boot only with this disk attached)\n\n\n*Remove old disk from volume group\nsudo vgreduce xubuntu-vg /dev/mapper/sda5_crypt\n\n*Cross your fingers and reboot (I did about ten such movings, but without using LUKS, as I see your should enter password at boot to open your devices\nDon't do that if you don't know anything about LUKS or LVM, it's just recommendations, feel free to ask something more or consult with your engineer. I don't want you to make loss of any data. I suggest this way because dd for 500G device really not good. There is almost same question there How to migrate an encrypted LVM install to a new disk but they created new LVM VG and copy data using rsync (pvmove move data using blocks, not files - in other words pvmove really faster and will not corrupt any permissions, bits and etc). And I think where will be need of some edit of /etc/crypttab, but believe no need to do that. Please backup all of necessary data and get live-cd or usb before this move.\nEDIT:\nBy the way, answering on your primary question I can say there was a bug about two years ago that tearing data with pvmove on SSD link. If you have no problems and you not borried to do fresh install it's actually way too, to safe you from any disasters.\n", "Q: How to install gitg version 2.7 under 15.04? I updated to Ubuntu 15.04.

I read a post that suggested I close the lid and open it again, and this actually solves the problem.\nBut I need to do this every time. \nMy machine is a HP Pavilion g6 with AMD Quad-Core A6-3420M  with Radeon 6520G graphics card.\nI tried several options, which I describe below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Removed 14.04 and reinstalled Ubuntu Gnome 15.04 from a bootable stick. Black screen appeared after grub screen. I tried to install proprietary drivers from Software Sources -> Additional Drivers. After this, even closing and opening the lid stopped working.\n\n*Reinstalled 14.04.\n\n*Ran upgrade from the command prompt using sudo do-release-upgrade\n\n*This upgraded the system to 14.10, but this also produced the black screen. Closing lid and opening worked though.\n\n*Brimming with hope, I ran the upgrade command again.\n\n*Upgraded to 15.04, but black-screen remained, with the lid closing and opening still working.\n\n*Based on another post, stopped lightdm, ran dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, restarted lightdm. Rebooted machine. Nothing changed.\n\n*Per another post, (did not keep track of the URL), I moved .local, .cache, .kde and .config to .local.old etc and restarted. The black screen still comes, the lid closing routine works, but my desktop looks messed up and the resolutions have gone awry.\n\n*Tried another method. I had my home and root on different partitions, and I was leaving home untouched till now. I formatted both partitions and tried again from an ubuntu 15.04 ISO download, from which I created a bootable startup stick. The result is still the same: black screen, but lid closing works.\n\n\nAll my fonts and icons have become bigger than before, and the fonts are not sharp either.\nThe black screen is certainly a video/graphics problem and not a boot problem because I can hear the sound played by Ubuntu on bringing up the login screen.\nAwaiting some help!\nAs per release notes of 14.10, \n\nMachines with ATI/AMD video cards may be getting blank or entirely turned off screen at boot. The screen will switch on when the X server starts. If you need it to turn on prior to that, for example to unlock an encrypted harddisk hitting ESC twice should reset the video card to a working state. \n\n\nA: My problem was finally solved after I applied the latest updates from Ubuntu a couple of days ago. I am unable to get hold of any version number to say which update I am running - if anyone has suggestions on how to get that, I'll be glad to post that information also.\nBefore applying the updates, I had tried out one more option: adding nomodeset to the Grub start-up script, as described here. That did not help me though. Now I don't know if it is a combination of both which works, but I don't want to play around to find out, as you can well imagine!\nHope this helps others too.\n\nA: I upgraded to 15.04 from 14.04 and didn't have any issues until I updated and then I was having the same issue, but closing lid didn't fix it. I tried a clean install of 15.04 and found that it started happening after an update of the kernel to 3.19.0-22.

Just give it a bit of unallocated space and the installer will set it up properly.\nInside the Ubuntu installer, you (or the installer automatically) will create a root partition (format as ext4 and select: \"Use as /\") and a swap partition (format as linux-swap\"). That is enough, you could even omit the swap partition (but it's not recommended to do so!).\nYou can also create a separate home partition (format usually as ext4 and select: \"Use as /home\") for the users' personal data and configuration, which makes reinstalls and backups a bit easier. Otherwise that directory is included in your root partition /.\nYou will be able to mount and access all your NTFS partitions from Ubuntu, but the other way round, accessing Ubuntu's ext4 partitions from Windows, will not work. Note that writing files from both Windows and Ubuntu to the NTFS partitions might lead to permission problems...\n", "Q: Can not connect to Windows HomeGroup and Internet at the same time I Ubuntu 14.04 and made all the changes on Samba to allow me to connect to my Windows Homegroup.

Ubuntu is Definitely Consuming More Power Than Windows! \nSystem details: Intel Core i5 2.50GH, Nvidia, 2GB RAM, 32bit O/S for both Linux and Windows.\n\nWell I have been using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for nearly 1 week. I have noticed whenever my laptop runs on Ubuntu its battery last only half an hour. On the other hand when I run laptop on Windows 7 battery last nearly 1 hour! This is amazing. I always thought Linux is far away than windows in every technical aspects. But unfortunately this is not true when it comes to power management technology! Well I did read some old posts in Ubuntu forum and here on askubuntu too. I see many experts (or at least experienced users) not acknowledging this fact and often they are saying this is simply not true. They showed many statistics from their end but to me none of them are convincing at all.

The script would have to go something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nterminator -l TestProfile --command=\"xdotool key Ctrl+Tab;$SHELL\"  &\n\nPros ? Does exactly what you ask of it. If you'd want to focus on window 2, your --command= would look like --command=xdotool key Ctrl+Tab;xdotool key Ctrl+Tab;$SHELL, i.e., emulate pressing Ctrl+Tab twice.\nCons: need to install xdotool\nand remember to make the script executable with chmod +x\n\nA: I wanted to do basically the same and came up with a solution using the terminal \"order\" setting in the config, after a bit of trial and error. In my case I have one terminal per tab and want to give initial focus to the first (leftmost) tab, which I achieved as follows:\nIt's not as simple as it should be because terminator seems to always leave focus at the last tab opened (the highest numbered terminal entry) so what you need to do is this. If your terminal configuration is currently:\n[[[terminal2]]]\n  order = 0\n  parent = child1\n  profile = Profile-1\n  type = Terminal\n[[[terminal3]]]\n  order = 1\n  parent = child1\n  profile = Profile-2\n  type = Terminal\n[[[terminal4]]]\n  order = 2\n  parent = child1\n  profile = Profile-3\n  type = Terminal\n\nThen change it to:\n[[[terminal2]]]\n  order = 2\n  parent = child1\n  profile = Profile-3\n  type = Terminal\n[[[terminal3]]]\n  order = 1\n  parent = child1\n  profile = Profile-2\n  type = Terminal\n[[[terminal4]]]\n  order = 0\n  parent = child1\n  profile = Profile-1\n  type = Terminal\n\nYou'll now end up with the same terminals in the same tabs, but the initial focus is now the left-most tab.\nNote that if you have labels set in the child entries then don't change those - they still apply to the tabs left-to-right, as before the change.\nI would imagine that the same solution can be applied for the original question's config with terminals in different child entries too.\n", "Q: black screen after install Nvidia drive 304.125 on ubuntu 15.04 After install Nvidia drive 304.125 on ubuntu 15.04 display black screen i tried nomodeset but still the problem\n\nA: It happen to me as well, i am sure there is a way to make it work but i recommend you to boot a live cd, save everything you need and re install ubuntu 15.04.\nVisit this link to learn how to upgrade your other drivers :)\nHow do I install additional drivers?\n", "Q: Get proper boot on Grub2 This question is very similar to others one but I haven’t find a precise answer to my problem.\nI have one hard drive, with 4 partitions :\n\n\n*\n\n*A first system partition with window's bootloader\n\n*A partition with windows 8.1\n\n*A partition with ubuntu 12 and ubuntu bootloader\n\n*And a storage one\n\n\nI've installed windows first.

I've already added Bumblebee ppa and aparently that should solve the problem BUT it doesn't. \nTrying to install virtualgl and others.\napt-get install virtualgl virtualgl-libs virtualgl-libs-ia32:i386 virtualgl-libs:i386\n\nI get an error that says something like: package virtualgl isn't available but is referenced by another package ( I can't copy and past it directly because my system language isn't english and you woudn't understand it )\nUsing the apt-cache search virtualgl I get this as result:\nbumblebee - NVIDIA Optimus support for Linux\nprimus - client-side GPU offloading for NVIDIA Optimus\nAnd this is my first problem.\nAbout the error I get when trying to run optirun APP, I've read that it can be solved by installing virtualgl and the others packages i've already metioned. Anyway, as the problem might be something else, here is what I get when I try to run, for example, optirun glxspheres64\n[ 5386.790679] [ERROR]Cannot access secondary GPU - error: Could not load GPU driver\nUPDATE 1: apparently when I and do nvidia-detector is returns none ... So am I to suppose that the nvidia driver was not installed ?\n\nA: You can download latest version here. \nI also had difficulties with optirun+primus, that optirun -vv outputted a segmentation fault with any process that actually used 3D acceleration, which made it useless. But optirun -b virtualgl solved it.\n", "Q: Is running Burg on 15.04 possible? Is it possible to have grub2 replaced with burg on Ubuntu 15.04? I had it on 14.04 but I'm struggling to get it on 15.04, does there need to be in a repository for 15.04 or something like that? If so, is there a manual method in getting it?\n\nA: I have two partions on the same disk, one with Windows10 and one with Ubuntu 15.04.\nI followed these instructions: http://www.unixmen.com/how-to-install-burg-boot-loader-in-ubuntu-1304-and-linuxmint/\nexcept for the part which allows you to choose boot drives (I didn't pick either of my drives). Then I ran...\nsudo burg-install /dev/sdb\n\nNote: my boot drive is 'sdb'\nAnd then \nsudo update-burg\n\n...and tested with \nsudo burg-emu\n\nAnd it works! I also tried rebooting and it works fine, I can choose theme and everything.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I had the same problem after updating ubuntu and I got it back to work just by running:\nsudo burg-install /dev/sda\n\nReplacing /dev/sda for your hard drive and then:\nsudo burg-update\n\nNOTE: If you installed BURG using ppa:n-muench/burg apt repo, you will get 404 errors when doing apt-get update (not a big deal but a bit annoying for me). To fix this go to Software & Updates, and under Other Software tab, edit that repo and change Distribution from 'vivid' to 'utopic'.\n", "Q: Keyboard suddenly using wrong layout, do not recall editing any configs Last night after restarting I found that my keyboard layout changed from the normal uk layout I use.

What caused the change and how do I remedy the situation?\n\nA: Super+space switched the keyboard input source. This solved my problem.\n", "Q: Gnome-terminal not working properly with screen-256colors Today I noticed I did not have 256 color support in Weechat. I decided this would be a quick fix. It isn't.\nFirst thing I googled was how to test the color support in terminal. I have installed colortest on my local machine and when I run it it shows me 256 colors. However, when I run echo $TERM it kept showing me xterm.\nSince I don't know the details about all these things I tried to configure it such that it matches up with every tutorial on the topic. They all say it should give me screen-256colors.\nFirst thing I did was add this to my .zshrc file:\n# If the $term variable is xterm, change it to 256 colors!\nif [ \"$TERM\" = \"xterm\" ]; then\n    # No it isn't, it's gnome-terminal\n    export TERM=\"xterm-256color\"\nfi\n\nIt says xterm-256colors instead of screen-256colors. That's okay, some tutorial told me to do that.\nI start a new terminal, echo $TERM and I notice that it is indeed set. Fire up a tmux and see what that tells me when I type echo $TERM. It says screen. So that should show me screen-256colors for it to work properly in weechat. So next I tried to change the xterm-256colors in my .zshrc file to screen-256colors but when I do that, I get garbled output. See the screenshot.\n\nSo next I googled on how to change the variable for tmux. I found this link. It shows an option to configure tmux to use 256 colors. It is an option that is shown in almost all the tutorials. \nset -g default-terminal \"screen-256color\"\n\nSo I tried it, yet it didnt change a thing. So I googled around some more and found this question. Quote:\n\nTmux is relatively picky about having a terminal set correctly. If you can, set the term value in gnome-terminal's configuration, not in your .bashrc. Failing that, surround those settings with a check for \"screen\" or \"screen-256color\" TERM, and don't reset them in that case.\n\nOkay, so I understand that outside of tmux I should not use screen* values for $TERM. That's okay because it is set to xterm-256colors. Then it clearly states that I should not override the $TERM variable if it is set to screen. Which I have made sure of using the if test in my .zshrc file.\nThe thing that mainly confuses me is that 256 colors actually work in tmux. See the screenshot below. When I run echo $TERM inside tmux it shows screen. When I run colortest-256 it shows me all colors properly. Yet, I think weechat bases itself on the $TERM variable to show colors. And because I run it inside tmux with $TERM set to screen it assumes I don't have 256 color support.\n\nI am stumped on how to solve this issue. All I wanted were some colors in weechat :>\nFor completeness below are my two configuration files.\n.zshrc\n# Path to your oh-my-zsh installation.\nexport ZSH=/home/christophe/.oh-my-zsh\nZSH_THEME=\"flazz\"\nplugins=(git command-not-found common-aliases dircycle lein)\n\n\n# Show dots for progress\nCOMPLETION_WAITING_DOTS=\"true\"\n\n##########\n## PATH ##\n##########\n\n# Export directory if it exists.\n#if [ -d \"/usr/local/go/bin\" ]; then\n#    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n#fi\n\n#############\n## ALIASES ##\n#############\n\nalias randompass=\"< /dev/urandom tr -dc _A-Z-a-z-0-9 | head -c${1:-32};echo;\"\n\n############\n## TWEAKS ##\n############\n\n# Disable shared history\nsetopt no_share_history\n\n\n# Start existing or new tmux session each shell startup\n#[[ $TERM != \"screen\" ]] && exec tmux attach -d\nalias chat='tmux attach -dt weechat || tmux new -s weechat \\; new-window htop'\n\n\n# If the $term variable is xterm, change it to 256 colors!\nif [ \"$TERM\" = \"xterm\" ]; then\n    # No it isn't, it's gnome-terminal\n    export TERM=\"xterm-256color\"\nfi\n\n\n######################\n# User configuration #\n######################\n\nexport PATH=\"/home/christophe/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\"\nsource $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh\n\n.tmux.conf\n# 256 color support\nset -g default-terminal \"screen-256color\"\n\n\nA: First of all I'd like to confirm what you've already figured out, namely that directly under gnome-terminal (that is, outside of tmux or screen) you should set TERM=xterm-256color, whereas inside tmux or screen it should be set to TERM=screen-256color.\nApparently your .zshrc segment properly sets it for the shell that's run directly by gnome-terminal.\nI'm not sure what needs to be put in .tmux.conf, I have solved it in my .bashrc similarly to your .zshrc fragment for xterm-256color. I also remove TERMCAP which is set by screen and causes some problems, but apparently tmux doesn't set it so it shouldn't make a difference for you.\nif [ \"$TERM\" = \"xterm\" ]; then\n    export TERM=xterm-256color\nfi\nif [ \"$TERM\" = \"screen\" -o \"$TERM\" = \"screen-256color\" ]; then\n    export TERM=screen-256color\n    unset TERMCAP\nfi\n\nDoes this solve the problem for you?\nBy the way, instead of this snippets, copying your .tmux.conf also sets this properly for me (on Vivid), so you're on the right track, it should work. Is there maybe something else sourced by your zsh (e.g. the global config, or oh-my-zsh) that reverts to the 8/16-color TERM=screen?\n", "Q: right click menus, dropdown menus have no shadows and borders I installed kubuntu-desktop on existing unity installation but for some bugs disliked it and removed it.

And I had found the solution to the GRUB2 issue.\nWhat happened was from my understanding secure boot was turned on and was doing it's job, preventing things from accessing and/or installing unwanted programs onto the drive. Simply turning off secure boot did not fix everything completely but it did allow grub to access the other partition. Here are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your computer and boot into the BIOS settings (In my case it was done by pressing F12 on Dell)\n\n*Find the boot options, they should be near the bottom\n\n*I'm sure the option might differ but in my case I chose to turn off secure boot with UEFI turned on, It worked for me but I have heard using Legacy over UEFI works best on Ubuntu systems.\nIF YOUR COMPUTER BOOTS INTO THE WINDOWS PARTITION AFTER THE RESTART\n\n\n*Boot into BIOS the same way you did in the first step.\n\n*Boot into the Ubuntu (or elementary) partition under the UEFI list.\n\n*Download, install and run Boot-Repair inside of a terminal window Installing boot repair- via help.ubuntu.com\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\n\n*Run boot-repair using the recommended settings button. This will reinstall Grub2 and change the boot order in the BIOS to boot to the partition GRUB has been installed to.\n\n*Save the link at the end of the process in case you have issues.\n\n*Restart your computer.\n\n*Windows should be in the Grub list, and when selected will boot you into windows.\n--\nNow that you can boot into windows using grub you can change the grub boot order to have the windows partition selected by default in the timeout rather than Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Is there an IDE for Ubuntu that combines Python, Gtk and Glade in one unique program?

You can use Glade with PyCharm, too.\n\nA: Yes, there is. :) Rather different from PyCharm, but Stani's Python Editor is a great IDE for Python and ships with wxGlade (among other useful tools such as Kiki).\nIt can be installed from Ubuntu repositories with:\nsudo apt-get install spe\n\n", "Q: how to restrict time used for using computer in Ubuntu I want to restrict the access to user accounts for employees to the working hour daily.\nMonday to Friday (8:00-17:00)\nSaturday (8:00-13:00)\nHow to do this?!\nCommand line and GUI apps are well accepted\n\nA: Since you're an experienced user, I suggest you use pam_time:\n\nThe pam_time PAM module does not authenticate the user, but instead it\n  restricts access to a system and or specific applications at various\n  times of the day and on specific days or over various terminal lines.\n  This module can be configured to deny access to (individual) users\n  based on their name, the time of day, the day of week, the service\n  they are applying for and their terminal from which they are making\n  their request.\n\n\nA: Here is the improved version of my original script I've linked in the comments. This script uses all the tools that come with ubuntu, namely at(for task scheduling) , date, and gnome-session-quit so no additional installation of software is necessary.  This script can be called from ~/.config/autostart or /etc/xdg/autostart in a .desktop file.\ndate will determine current hour of the day as well as day of the week (number). Case structure then decides which parameter to give to logthemout function; the parameter is the clock-out hour of the day. For monday - friday it is 17:00, and for Saturday that's 13:00. logthemout function will  in turn check if the current time is within working hours range (if statement with logical \"or\" ). If it is, the user will receive appropriate notification that they will be logged out at specific time. If the working hours are not within the range, the user will be logged out. Technically speaking, what is happening is that the user logs in, but the script logs them out right away. The shortcomings of this script is that the script depends on system time. If a user has ability to alter system time, they have ability to bypass the script. Otherwise, this should work.\n#!/bin/bash\nset -x\n\nHOUR=$(date +%H)\nDAYOFWEEK=$(date +%u)\n\nfunction logthemout\n{\n    if [[ $HOUR -gt $1 || $HOUR -lt 8 ]]; then\n\n        gnome-session-quit --no-prompt\n\n    else \n        notify-send \"AUTO-LOGOUT AT $1 pm\"\n        echo \"gnome-session-quit --no-prompt\" | at $1:00\n    fi\n}\n\n\n\ncase $DAYOFWEEK in\n    1|2|3|4|5) logthemout 17;;\n    6) logthemout 13;;\n    7) gnome-session-quit --no-prompt ;;\nesac\n\nClarification:\nTypically if you want to run something on GUI login, you'd have to create something like /home/username/.config/autostart/mystartup-prog.desktop , which should have a format similar to this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=<Name of application as displayed>\nExec=<command to execute>\nIcon=<full path to icon>\nComment=<optinal comments>\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\n\nIf you have a lot of workers, this might be inefficient, so better way would be to have one such entry in /etc/xdg/autostart/mystartup-prog.desktop.\n\nA: I think TimeKpr will do the job.

This can be confirmed by comparing the downloaded files MD5 checksum to the one listed on the AMD checksum reference page. The archive downloaded using wget will have a different checksum than the one listed on that page.\n\n*\n\n*If you download AMD-APP-SDK-v2.9-lnx64.tgz from the AMD website, you will need to agree to a License Agreement before being able to download it.\n\n*If you use wget to download the SDK, you will not be agreeing to the license agreement and thus, archive will have the wrong MD5 Checksum:\n\n*\n\n*MD5 (AMD-APP-SDK-v2.9-lnx64.tgz) = 649b53fccfa8262de835d554fdd56dfc\n\n\n\n*However, if you download it properly from the website, the checksum will be:\n\n*\n\n*MD5 (AMD-APP-SDK-v2.9-lnx64 (1).tgz) = 24ca89856d41aa82dea8370b7a24fb4e\nAMD lists the correct checksums on this page.\nSo, in order to download it using a script, you will most likely have to upload the correctly downloaded archive somewhere else. However, this may be against the License Agreement, I'm not sure. I copied AMD's license agreement to this gist if you'd like to take a look.\nYou can refer to this answer for how to check the md5sum.

There is a lot of contradicting information about publishing for Desktop. Some sources say that from 14.10 onwards Click packages also for Desktop can be submitted to USC.

And then there are Snappy packages.\nThere are bugs open about submitting free open source apps to USC being impossible (see e.g. https://bugs.launchpad.net/developer-portal/+bug/1409749). I'm SO confused right now.

And PPA is a lot easier if you already have a .DEB.\nClick (What are Click packages?) and Snappy are basically the same (where Snappy is an improved version of Click intended for server side installation and Click is intended for client side installation). Both are intended for mobile phones and as a side effect usable on the desktop. \nWe will turn from .DEB installers since the 15.10 release will have Snappy installation.

I'm using vsftpd and apache2, and I am having a camera to upload pictures taken once an hour to a local server over FTP. But I am unable to view them on the website I am running apache2 on as the pictures gets uploaded to a folder in apache2 which is /var/www/uploads.\nAll pictures that gets uploaded automatic gets chmod 600, however it has to be 777 or 664 at least.\n\nA: Here is your answer.\nHow Rinzwind said, you need a maximum of 664. Therefore 777-664=113\nlocal_umask=0113\n\nI quote:\n\nIn case you are wondering where to set your umask, it can be set in\n  the vsftpd config file (/etc/vsftpd.conf) as anon_umask for anonymous\n  access and local_umask for users.\nFor the mask to work properly (even without anonymous access) it seems\n  necessary to set anon_upload_enable=YES and\n  anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES. If these are not set, writing, reading\n  and executing will not be allowed for groups or others on files\n  uploaded via ftp (even though the standard privileges may be set for\n  something else).\nIn your case, if you need user-authenticated access, you should set\n  the following:\nanonymous_enable=NO\nlocal_enable=YES\nwrite_enable=YES\nlocal_umask=0002\nanon_upload_enable=YES\nanon_mkdir_write_enable=YES\nfile_open_mode=0777\n\nHere, file_open_mode sets the default setting of files. 777 makes it\n  readable, writeable and executable for anyone. With local_umask set to\n  002, this gives you 775, as you requested.\nNotice that local_umask defaults to 077, disabling groups and others\n  to access files in any way (hence it is set here).\n\n", "Q: Mobile Broad Band connection Problem I recently Bought Huawei E303F Data card It is working nice in windows 8.1 but in ubuntu connection cant be established using it \nModem is recognised but when i tried to connect it is is failing to do so\nAny solution for the problem?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: I had this same problem: lsusb was detecting the card properly, and so was NetworkManager but it was unable to connect.\nThe solution that finally worked for me was to use wvdial. Running wvdialconf in the terminal with my modem plugged in automatically detected it and generated the config file (/etc/wvdial.conf) which I then edited. But you can also directly create the file without running that command.\nHere's how my /etc/wvdial.conf file looks, after editing:\n[Dialer Defaults]\nInit1 = ATZ\nInit2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0\nStupid Mode = 1\nModem Type = USB Modem\nISDN = 0\nNew PPPD = yes\nModem = /dev/ttyUSB0\nBaud = 460800\n\n[Dialer vodafone]\nUsername = vodafone\nPassword = vodafone\nPhone = *99#\n\nTo edit /etc/wvdial.conf, you need to have root permissions. Typing sudo gedit /etc/wvdial.conf in the terminal will open the required file\nNow, running wvdial vodafone should get you connected to the net.\nYou may need to change ttyUSB0 with some other modem, depending on which port your modem is set to.\nAnother problem I've heard some people encounter is that the usb sticks has several modes: one for the \"CD\" with drivers, one for the optional microSD card, and one for the modem itself. So it may get detected as a wrong device, making the connection fail (eg. trying to connect to the Internet through the microSD reader). There are other forums, like this one,  which describes how to do this using usb_modeswitch.

But knowing MicroSoft you need to sign up 1st so a command line method is not possible. \nAnd then use something like brasero to burn it to a dvd or use the USB disk creator to install it into an USB.  \n", "Q: Dell M3800 with Nvidia Driver and External Monitor I have problems with my notebook DELL Precision M3800 with NVIDIA Quadro K1100 and Intel. \nI need to use the proprietary driver nvidia (I tested the 331 that 349) with my external monitor. \nMy external monitor (DELL) has a resolution of 1920*1200, I connect via DVI-miniDP adapt but my system at each session view this error: \ncould not set the configuration for CRTC 64.\nSetting:\nNotebook Resolution: 1920*1080 \nExt Monitor: 1920*1200\nantodc@gandalf:~$ xrandr\nScreen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 3840 x 1200, maximum 16384 x 16384\neDP1 connected 1920x1080+0+0 346mm x 194mm\n   3840x2160      60.0 +   48.0  \n   2048x1536      60.0  \n   1920x1440      60.0  \n   1856x1392      60.0  \n   1792x1344      60.0  \n   1920x1200      60.0  \n   1920x1080      59.9* \n   1600x1200      60.0  \n   1680x1050      60.0     59.9  \n   1600x1024      60.2  \n   1400x1050      60.0  \n   1280x1024      60.0  \n   1440x900       59.9  \n   1280x960       60.0  \n   1360x768       59.8     60.0  \n   1152x864       60.0  \n   1024x768       60.0  \n   800x600        60.3     56.2  \n   640x480        59.9  \nVGA1 disconnected\nHDMI1 disconnected\nDP1 disconnected\nHDMI2 connected 1920x1200+1920+0 518mm x 324mm\n   1920x1200      60.0*+\n   1600x1200      60.0  \n   1680x1050      59.9  \n   1280x1024      60.0  \n   1280x960       60.0  \n   1024x768       60.0  \n   800x600        60.3  \n   640x480        60.0  \n   720x400        70.1  \nVIRTUAL1 disconnected\n\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier \"layout\"\n    Screen 0 \"nvidia\"\n    Inactive \"intel\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier \"intel\"\n    Driver \"intel\"\n    BusID \"PCI:0@0:2:0\"\n    Option \"AccelMethod\" \"SNA\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier \"intel\"\n    Device \"intel\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier \"nvidia\"\n    Driver \"nvidia\"\n    BusID \"PCI:2@0:0:0\"\n    Option \"ConstrainCursor\" \"off\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier \"nvidia\"\n    Device \"nvidia\"\n    Option \"AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration\" \"on\"\n    Option \"IgnoreDisplayDevices\" \"CRT\"\nEndSection\n\nI am trying in every way but I can not make them work.

I just downloaded VSCode-linux-x64 from the Microsoft website. It's a 62 MB zip file. How can I install it on my Ubuntu system?\n\nA: Visual Studio Code enabled official Linux repositories on February 2017 (v1.10)\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys EB3E94ADBE1229CF\nsudo add-apt-repository -y \"deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main\"\nsudo apt -y install code\n\nYou can upgrade / dist-upgrade as usual\nsudo apt -y upgrade\nsudo apt -y dist-upgrade\n\n\nA: Visual Studio Code doesn't have to be installed, per se. Instead you can unzip the archive wherever you want it, then run the program by double-clicking the file called code (which is the main executable).\nHere's a GUI-oriented procedure for doing so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Visual Studio Code site and click Download Code for Linux. (You should probably also review the license terms and privacy policy.)\n\n*Make a new folder where you want Visual Studio Code to go. It's best to do this within your home folder (if other users want to use Visual Studio Code, it could be extracted separated for them--then any modifications or configuration changes will be per-user).\nThis destination folder should be empty, as the .zip archive provided for download does not have everything in a top-level folder inside. For example, if you put software installed for your own user in ~/opt, you could create a new folder inside there called VSCode-linux-x64.\n\n*Right click the downloaded .zip file and click Extract To..., then select the folder you created.\nIf you prefer, or if your file browser doesn't show an Extract To... option, you could instead move the .zip file into the destination folder, right-click the icon, and click Extract Here.\n\n*To run Visual Studio Code, double-click on the code executable, which is one of the files that was extracted.\nCurrently Visual Studio Code is \"preview\" software, which means it is still being developed and is not yet fully stable. Therefore you might prefer to launch it from a terminal so that you can see possibly useful errors and warnings. To do that, open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T), cd to the directory where you extracted it, and run ./code.\n\nA: Now there's a .deb package for Ubuntu and Debian besides the rpm/zip. It is available here and may be installed as usual:\nsudo dpkg -i vscode-amd64.deb\n\nWorks fine on Xenial. Maybe someone creates a PPA to simplify updates. Or it 'll become part of the official repository.\nUpdate 03/17: Since version 1.10 (February 2017) there is built-in support for official Linux repositories. VS Code now can auto-update on Linux, although you have to install it one time manually.\n\nA: Installing VS Code on Ubuntu\ncurl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg\nsudo mv microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list'\n\nThis will download the gpg key and copy and make the apt files.\nThen you can simply update and install vs code:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install code\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The advantage of this installation method is that you can simple update vscode using the apt-get update command. Works fine and I use vs code with the vim plugin for over 2 years (c, c++, python, md, latex, html, javascript ...).\n\n\nBTW, VS Code will be a standard package in Ubuntu 18.04 (end of april 2018)!\n\nA: Install the snap.\nsudo apt install snapd-xdg-open\nsudo snap install code --classic\n\n\nA: Update\nVSCode is now available as DEB file. You can download it and then run:\nsudo dpkg -i ~/path/to/code_1.XXX.deb\n\nIn case dpkg complains about missing dependencies, run:\nsudo apt -f install\n\nafterwards to fix the problem.\nOld answer\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Visual Studio Code for Linux\n\n*Extract it: unzip VSCode-linux-x64.zip -d ~/path/to/VSCode\n\n*Run the code executable to open Visual Studio Code\n\n*(Optional) Create a symbolic link to conveniently run code from the terminal:\nsudo ln -s /path/to/VSCode/code /usr/local/bin/code\nSource (install instructions): https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux\n\nA: Since they provide a .deb file now I recommend using that instead of the approach below.\nThe way I've done it is as follows. Using a terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a directory for the files and change to this directory:\nmkdir msvs && cd msvs\n\nThe directory name is arbitrary.\n\n\n*Unpack the zip file in your new folder:\nunzip ../Downloads/VSCode-linux-x64.zip\n\n\n*Run the ide using\n./VSCode-linux-x64/code &\n\nYou can also create a desktop link so that you can start it directly from the desktop or double-click in nautilus.\nTo create a menu entry:\n\n\n*At the terminal, create a file\nsudo gedit /usr/share/applications/MSVS.desktop\n\nand copy and paste the following:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nExec=/opt/msvs/code\nName=MSVS\nIcon=/opt/msvs/flurry_ios_visual_studio_2012_replacement_icon_by_flakshack-d5nnelp.png\nCategories=Development\n\nIn my case the executable resides inside /opt/msvs.\nsudo cp -R ~/Downloads/VSCode-linux-x64 /opt/msvs\n\nI also downloaded an MS icon for this application from\nwget http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/344/9/1/flurry_ios_visual_studio_2012_replacement_icon_by_flakshack-d5nnelp.png\n\nand moved it to /opt/msvs:\nsudo mv flurry*png /opt/msvs\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Install gdebi package installer\n\n*Download .deb VSCode package from here\n\n*Install downloaded package using gdebi\n\nA: I can't comment on the correct answer above (using PPA as of February), so I will add another detail here.\nVisual Code depends on libgtk2.0-0 which it does not list as a dependency in the meta data. You might come across this problem if you, like me, setup minimal virtualbox installations just to troubleshoot difficult system level problems where you have to hack and slash packages which you don't want to do on your real host.\nOn minimal hosts, therefore the following is required in addition to what was mentioned above to get Visual Code to run:\nsudo apt install libgtk2.0-0\n\n\nA: From Visual Studio Code's official docs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the .deb package from this page.\n\n*Run the following command:\nsudo dpkg -i ~/path-to-file.deb\n\n*If you get dependency errors when using dpkg with a package, run:\nsudo apt-get install -f\nNote: Installing the .deb package will automatically install the apt repository and signing key to enable auto-updating using the regular system mechanism.\n\nA: You can use new FLATPAK (flathub) repository to install on any linux distribution https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.visualstudio.code\nFLATPAK automaticaly updates installed packages.\n\nA: *\n\n*Download the Powerbase installer script for Visual Studio Code\n\n*Become root\nsudo -i\n\n\n*Change to your download directory (probably ~/Downloads/)\ncd /home/*yourusername*/Downloads/\n\n\n*Run the installer script.  If there are no errors, it will just exit…\nsh ./vscodeinstaller.sh\n\nThat’s it. Nothing special about this one and it should work in any Linux distribution.  Just open your launcher and start typing Visual Studio Code. \n", "Q: Impossible to trash files from a folder which is a symbolic link to a NTFS partition folder Since a few days and the upgrade of my Ubuntu from 14.10 to 15.04, I cannot send files to trash anymore from some folders.\nWhen deleting from Nautilus, I now get a popup saying:\n“aaa.png” can't be put in the trash. Do you want to delete it immediately?\n\nThat worked perfectly for years :(\nI have a dual boot system Ubuntu/Windows.\nUbuntu is on EXT4 partitions while Windows and data are on NTFS ones.\nThe NTFS partitions are mounted via gvfs at login:\ngvfs-mount -d /dev/sdb9\n\nIn my home folder, I have several symbolic links to folders on the NTFS partitions, like this one:\nDownloads -> /media/stephane/dmn/User/Downloads/\n\nI tried from terminal in ~/Downloads:\ngvfs-trash aaa.png\nError trashing file: Unable to trash file: Invalid cross-device link\n\nBut in the original folder /media/stephane/dmn/User/Downloads/, the same command works perfectly !\nWhile I kind of understand the error, that setup has been in place for years and I have been trashing files without looking back and without problems either.\nSo what happened to gvfs-trash and why isn't it suddenly able to trash such files anymore?\nIs there a way to make it work again?\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*check the permissions of ~/.local/share/Trash: it's all mine as well as its subfolders\n\n*check the permissions of .Trash-1000/ on the NTFS partitions: same thing, I have all the right permissions\n\n*mount NTFS via fstab instead of gvfs-mount: not a thing changed\n\n\nA: I have not found any real solution for this but i do have a work around that is slightly less annoying that browsing to the downloads folder on the other partition.. i created a softlink to the Downloads folder in the downloads folder... I know this sounds weird but it does not throw up the error when you go to the 2nd downloads folder and delete something.\nSo basically this happens:\nbrowse to ~/Downloads (which itself is a softlink to the other partition)\nclick on the \"Downloads\" softlink in that folder (which basically links to itself)\nnow you can delete files without the annoying error. its one extra click but saves browsing the other partition. \n", "Q: Mistakenly encrypted partition while installing Ubuntu My friend has tried to install Ubuntu on her USB (with live-usb) and used LMV encryption for the USB. Right now, it is not possible to load Windows normally.

Lowering the priority for configuration questions will allow you to specify an alternative name.\n\nI don't know how to solve this problem and recover the windows without loosing the data.\n\nA: You might be able to get it back but you'd have to move the whole file system (or all files) to another drive or partition (with enough free space) or an external HDD. Then, remove the encrypted container, and recreate the file system in its entirety without encryption. Finally, make sure that the new file system is properly recognized and that nothing has gone wrong. \nThe processes used are \n1) Very complex \n2) very time consuming \n3) error prone. \nThere is no \"quick fix\" unfortunately but there is a lot of information available if you look. \nGood luck! \n\nA: I could not find any simple solution because all data were deleted and the whole HDD was encrypted but I used TestDisk to recover all data.

Since planning to use Ubuntu as main OS, I want to store files in the larger space in the HDD while running OS from the SSD. \nNow should I make a partition in the 500GB HDD for such storage purpose? If I make a folder, say 'LinuxStorage', as in 'C:/Users/UserProfile/LinuxStorage' and store all Linux files and folders in it, could it cause any problem? Thanks\n\nA: What you can do is to boot live USB, and partition your 500 GB HHD to have an ext4 partition, say of 250 GB in size, and leave the other 250 GB for Windows 8. Once done, boot into Ubuntu normally, and find out the UUID of the partition that you created. For that , use sudo blkid, or sudo blkid | awk '/ext4/ {print }'.  Once you know it, edit /etc/fstab to be mounted on each boot; use this as reference\nThus your files will be stored on that other hard drive, and under filesystem that linux understands, which should help you avoid any trouble. Something similar is done when moving home onto separate partition\n", "Q: getting rid of nouveau and using intel graphics I'm running a Asus N550JK notebook, which uses an Intel HD4000-something-something Integrated GPU together with a proprietary nVidia GTX850m (known as nVidia Optimus).\nI just installed Ubuntu-Server 15.04, because of the reasons listed afterwards.\n(previously running Ubuntu 14.04, both as a dualboot together with Win8.1)\nNow I am fighting with that stupid nouveau, which is giving me a hard time now, since it crashes my system before I can even log in...only way to get there is to boot into recovery mode and then proceed to launch the standard thingy.

The command which is causing this much usage is kworker (I dont know what this is). I think this is not normal since my macbook also becomes warmer. On ubuntu 14 I did not have this problem. Is it already known why this happens or do I have to wait until this bug is fixed? \n\nA: I can't take credit for this but this tutorial has an answer:http://teslabs.com/articles/ubuntu-15-04-mbp-11-2/#comment-2020153043\nHigh CPU usage by kworker\nThe most important issue I have found so far is the high CPU usage by kworker (i.e. Linux Kernel worker thread), which seriously affects the battery life. Apparently this is caused by an interrupt storm on ACPI interrupt GPE06, as described here. You can verify it by checking if interrupt GPE06 contains a high value:\n$ grep . -r /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/\n\n...\n/sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe05:       0   invalid\n/sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe06: 2938373   enabled <---\n/sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe07:       0   enabled\n\n...\nA quick solution for this issue is to disable this interrupt, i.e.\necho disable > /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe06\n\nIn order to disable it on every boot, you can add the previous line to /etc/rc.local, just before exit 0.\n", "Q: How do I get Ubuntu voices to turn off Somehow suddenly Ubuntu is reading menu's to me - with a computer voice.

questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible that power management was always off on my previous version of Ubuntu (14.10)?\n\n*Is it normal that there is a file iwlwifi.conf in /etc/modprobe.d with the following content?\n# /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\n# iwlwifi will dyamically load either iwldvm or iwlmvm depending on the\n# microcode file installed on the system.  When removing iwlwifi, first\n# remove the iwl?vm module and then iwlwifi.\nremove iwlwifi \\\n(/sbin/lsmod | grep -o -e ^iwlmvm -e ^iwldvm -e ^iwlwifi | xargs/sbin/rmmod) \\\n&& /sbin/modprobe -r mac80211\nEdit 2: It seems that my problem could now be completely solved. Let me make a few clarifications: the \"instability\" of my connection can be summed up by two \"symptoms\":\n\n\n*\n\n*Slow rates (concretely, max download speed at around 150Kb/s instead of 1Mb/s when it worked properly) \n\n*\"Effective disconnection\" very frequently (every 30 seconds, say). What I mean by that is that the connection is not working at all, but the wifi does not \"officially\" disconnect. It comes back after waiting a few seconds (10 to 20s, say) or reconnecting to the network.\n\n\nAt first I thought that doing sudo iwconfig wlan0 power off solved these issues completely, even if turning off power management is apparently not a \"sustainable\" solution (see spinxz's comments below). However I then realized that symptom #2 is still there, although much less frequently.\nOn the French Ubuntu forum (here), someone suggested I try to manually put the latest version of the version 12 firmware (downloadable here: https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/_media/en/users/drivers/iwlwifi-7260-ucode-25.17.12.0.tgz) in /lib/firmware. I did that, and now the problem seems to be solved completely. To be honest, it might also have something to do with recent Ubuntu updates (they were a lot recently), I don't know. I am still not 100% certain the connection is back to working perfectly, or if it is only as good as the \"power management off\" solution, for example. I will let you know if that is the case.\n\nA: Before you go messing with your kernel as lpbug suggested, I think you should try tinkering with other things that don't have such a high risk of breaking things.\nThe fact that your device seems to be loading data slowly leads me to believe that the problem might be an issue between your router and your computer. Have you tested the data rate in another network while comparing to another device as a benchmark (your phone)? That might help us narrow down what is wrong.\nHave you tried turning off 802.11n in your /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf? I have the same wireless card and turning this off greatly improved my network's performance.\nTo turn it off, add the following line to /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf:\noptions iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\n\nNow restart the module:\nsudo modprobe -r iwlmvm\nsudo modprobe -r iwlwifi\nsudo modprobe iwlwifi\n\nNote for other readers with a similar problem to OP: you might have to replace iwlmvm above with iwldvm, depending on your system.\nLet me know if that helps at all.\nBy the way, to address your second question from your edit, yes, the iwlwifi config file should have the exact lines you listed.\n\nA: First of all, I should preface this with the fact that my network card is the Dual band version of the Intel Wireless N 7260 REV=0x144. but according to the 3rd post of this thread, it seems like out hardware is the same. I've had this unstable wifi problem for close to a year now and it seems like other with this card have had the same issue. This persisted until I recently tried different kernels. \nThe symptom for the unstable wifi would include (in order of most common occurence): Not being able to connect to wifi network upon returning from suspsend unless the computer has been restarted, or iwlwifi restarted; taking a really, really long time to connect to a network (on the order of a minute); being disconnected randomly from the wifi network I am on. \nI dual boot windows 7 with this and the same piece of hardware performs very well. This lead me to believe that this is more of a software problem. I tried out the 3.17.0 rc2 mainline kernel and my unstable wifi problem disappeared, now it only takes me about 10 seconds to connect to a wifi network and connections are rock solid. To my knowledge, the 3.17 kernels use firmware:iwlwifi-7260-9.ucode so if you can just try that version of iwlwifi it may work better.\nHOWEVER...\nYou should read this post before considering to do the same thing as I had. Before, I was getting 120 mbps up and down easily when I had a good wifi connection. Now, I only get 20 mbps up and down (tested this in windows 7 as control, and it seems like it is also getting 120+ mbps as before). I am unsure if this is a result of the kernel switch. In my case, it is a tradeoff between speed and stability and I would take 20 mbps of stable wifi over 120 mbps of unstable wifi. \nIf you decide to proceed: the steps I took for installing the new kernel: \ncd /tmp\nthen \nwget the following from the 3.17.0 rc2 mainline page: \nlinux-headers-3.17.0-031700rc2-lowlatency_3.17.0-031700rc2.201408251935_amd64.deb\nlinux-headers-3.17.0-031700rc2_3.17.0-031700rc2.201408251935_all.deb\nlinux-image-3.17.0-031700rc2-lowlatency_3.17.0-031700rc2.201408251935_amd64.deb\nfinally, sudo dpkg -i linux-headers-3.17.0-*.deb linux-image-3.17.0-*.deb\nthen reboot and check that the firmware loaded is version 9. \nI really hope this works for you. \n\nA: I have similar problems with my Intel 7260 wifi and did some research on how to fix these issues. \nIt turns out that lots of people have problems with this wifi card and its related driver the iwlwifi. However, it seems there is no easy apply and forget fix as people are reporting different problems (also due to different APs being used of course). Hence, some testing is has to be done.\nThe following links should be helpful:\nI found several related bug reports on launchpad, see here, here, here, and here.\nFurthermore, on the Archwiki there is a useful troubleshooting section for the iwlwifi driver. \nLast but not least here is also a brief summary on how to fix iwlwifi related problems.\nSome suggested solutions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off bluetooth (use rfkill or turn off in Bios)\n\n*Turn OFF 802.11n mode (in /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf add options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1)\n\n*Turn ON link aggregation (in /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf add options iwlwifi 11n_disable=8)\n\n*Turn OFF watchdog (in /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf add options iwlwifi wd_disable=1)\n\n*Turn off power saving features ($ sudo iw wlan0 set power_save off)\n\n*Set regulatory domain ($ sudo iw reg set <country code>)\n\n\n\nIn my case the stability problems were coming from frequent disconnects showing up in the syslog (-> dmesg) as follows:\nwlan0: deauthenticating from ....... by local choice (Reason: 3=DEAUTH_LEAVING)\n\nI am running Ubuntu 15.04 (x64) with a 3.19 Linux kernel.\nIn my case it seems that the problems are fixed just by turning on link aggregation (11n_disable=8). Turning off power saving also seems to help. This holds for the 2.4GHz network.\nFor the 5GHz network I could not solve the problems and the link is highly unstable.\n\nFor how to turn off wifi power management permanently see here and here.\n\nA: I couldn't fix this problem so wrote the following script to restart my card when it went down. Just put it in /etc/init.d/ and make it executable. It's not ideal but I barely notice the problem anymore.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile sleep 1\ndo\n    wget -q --tries=10 --timeout=20 --spider http://google.com\n    if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then\n        echo \"Online\"\n    else\n    echo \"Offline - restarting\"\n    rfkill block wifi\n    sleep 1\n    rfkill unblock wifi\n    sleep 1\n    ifconfig wlan0 down\n    sleep 1\n    ifconfig wlan0 up\n    sleep 10\n    fi\ndone\n\n\nA: These commands were helpfull to me on linux lite 3.2 \nHave you tried turning off 802.11n in your /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf? I have the same wireless card and turning this off greatly improved my network's performance.\n\" To turn it off, add the following line to /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf:\noptions iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\nNow restart the module:\nsudo modprobe -r iwlmvm\nsudo modprobe -r iwlwifi\nsudo modprobe iwlwifi  \" \nThank you \n\nA: In my case the only solution that worked was to \"disable 11n functionality\", but this:\noptions iwlwifi 11n_disable=2\n\nAlso gives stability and speed is a little better. It supposedly only disables \"agg TX\":\nmodinfo iwlwifi | grep 11n_disable\nparm:           11n_disable:disable 11n functionality, bitmap: 1: full, 2: disable agg TX, 4: disable agg RX, 8 enable agg TX (uint)\n\n\nA: What worked for me with the Intel 6 AX200 is having the latest firmware drivers and updating the /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf file with the following:\noptions iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\noptions iwlwifi 11n_disable=8\n\nThe first line only partially worked. It got the download speed up from 0.1 mbps to 20 mbps. In contrast, my other laptop was downloading a 200 mbps.\nThe second line is the one that fixed iwlwifi to work correctly and hit ~175 mbps.\nYou can try commenting out one or the other line to see which one works for you.\n", "Q: How to run sh file from terminal? I installed Viber on Ubuntu:\n/home/nazar/Software/Viber/Viber.sh\n\nI can run it from terminal specifying this path. I want to achieve some short command as:\nviber\n\nFor lunching application.\nHow to solve this issue?\n\nA: You can create an alias of the full command by running the following in the terminal:\nalias viber=/home/nazar/Software/Viber/Viber.sh\n\nNow you can run the script by just typing viber.\nNote that this will be working for the current session of the shell only. To make it permanent save it in ~/.bash_aliases (or ~/.bashrc):\n$ echo 'alias viber=/home/nazar/Software/Viber/Viber.sh' >> ~/.bash_aliases\n$ source ~/.bash_aliases \n\nThe first command will save the alias permanently in ~/.bash_aliases, the preferred file to save aliases. It will create the file if not exists already. The second command will make the alias working from the current shell session.\nAn alternate method is to create a symbolic link of the executable script in the /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin directory(given they are in your PATH environment variable).\nsudo ln -s /home/nazar/Software/Viber/Viber.sh /usr/local/bin/viber\n\nAs the directory is owned by user root and group root, make sure /usr/local/bin/viber has execute permission for all others (a+x).\nBy using any one of the above methods, you can run the script by simply typing viber.\n\nA: Another option is to create a script with that name somewhere on your PATH. This is a little overkill for this specific case; overall heemayl's answer is probably better for you.\nFirst, make the directory ~/bin if you don't have it already:\nmkdir ~/bin\n\nNow edit the file ~/bin/viber and save it with the following contents (change the first line if you use a different default shell):\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n/home/nazar/Software/Viber/Viber.sh\n\nFinally make the script executable:\nchmod +x ~/bin/viber\n\nAnd now you should be able to run the program with just viber.\n", "Q: Resolve domain names in QEMU VDE setup I have re-built QEMU with VDE support. For the uninitiated, VDE attaches a virtual switch program (vde_switch) to a TAP device which allows multiple VDE-enabled programs to utilize a single TAP device.\nMy ultimate goal here is to be able to resolve my virtual machines by hostname such as \"test1.qemu\" \"machineb.qemu\", etc from my host -- this will ease configuration for me in many circumstances since I use DHCP via dnsmasq on the TAP interfaces.\nReally this is probably a matter of not fully understanding how name resolution works, so I'm hoping to learn something out of this =)\nFirstly, my dnsmasq configuration file:\nuser=nobody\ninterface=tap0\nexcept-interface=lo\nlisten-address=192.168.1.1\n#Assign IP's 192.168.1.2-192.168.1.253 for 8 hrs\ndhcp-range=192.168.1.2,192.168.1.253,255.255.255.0,192.168.1.255,8h\npid-file=/var/run/dnsmasq_tap0.pid\ndhcp-leasefile=/var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.vde.leases\ndomain=qemu\nserver=/qemu/\n#Only really run on tap0, needed so there is no confliction with\n#NetworkManager's dnsmasq\nbind-interfaces\ndhcp-authoritative\ndhcp-no-override\nstrict-order\n\nAs you can see, I have configured dnsmasq to answer for \"*.qemu\" names. I can ping 192.168.1.1 properly, but as is stands, 'ping qemu' doesn't work. I assumed this was because my host machine didn't know how to resolve 'qemu', so I added it to the /etc/hosts file. Though, I'm not sure this is the proper way to do this. Of course, after adding the entry to /etc/hosts, qemu resolves but not i386.qemu (one of my VM's).\nI guess a good starting point would be: how do I tell my machine to forward all *.qemu requests to the dnsmasq running on 192.168.1.1 (local interface tap0)?\nAlso, if it's any help, here is my /etc/network/interfaces entry for tap0:\nauto tap0\niface tap0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.1\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    vde2-switch -\n    pre-up /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\n    pre-up /sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE\n    up /usr/sbin/dnsmasq -C /etc/dnsmasq.d/vde-network --pid-file=/var/run/dnsmasq_tap0.pid --bind-interfaces\n    post-down /bin/bash -c \"kill -9 $(cat /var/run/dnsmasq_tap0.pid)\"\n    post-down /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0\n    post-down /sbin/iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE\n\n\nA: So, I figured out the answer, and it was a bit of a facepalm moment.\nI had a file called /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/qemu which contained an incorrect DNS IP for my qemu dnsmasq instance (192.168.100.1 rather than 192.168.1.1). So, I think what was happening was that when I queried qemu, the default NetworkManager instance of netmask attempted to pass the query to 192.168.100.1 which didn't work for obvious reasons.\nOnce I changed the address to 192.168.1.1 in the config file and restarted NetworkManager (and thus its instance of dnamasq), everything works great! The /etc/hosts entry was not required as I had thought.\nNow I just have to figure out how to resolve my VM host's hostname to my LAN address within my VM's rather than returning 127.0.1.1 which is incorrect from my VMs' perspective.\n", "Q: How to fix huge FS Icons in Ubuntu 15.04 menubars? The FS Icons in Ubuntu 15.04 appear huge in the menubars of some applications like Nautilus, Gedit, Calculator, etc.  How can the FS icon sizes be corrected to work in Ubuntu 15.04?\nHere is what the icons look like in Nautilus.  This makes the operating system difficult to use when FS Icons are installed and used.\n\nHere is an example of the icons in Gedit.\n\n\nA: Apparently, scalable icons are used in the menubars for Ubuntu 15.04.  The FS Icon set specifies a minimum value for the scalable icons as 257 pixels.  The solution is to set the minimum value appropriately, so the icons can be scaled down to the required size.\nsudo sed -i \"s|MinSize=|MinSize=8\\n#MinSize=|g\" /usr/share/icons/fs-icons-ubuntu*/index.theme\n\nIn the above command, change /usr/share/icons to the location where you have installed your FS Icon set.\nAdditionally, in order to fix the icon sizes in Gedit, follow the steps outlined in the following question, since the fix still applies to Ubuntu 15.04.\nHow to use 22 pixel size icons for toolbars in Ubuntu 14.04\nNote that fs-icons-ubuntu-mono-dark were used in these screen shots, but this solution will fix all of the icons included in the FS Icons set.\nHere is what Nautilus looks like after applying the fix.\n\nHere is what Gedit looks like after applying the fix.\n\n\nA: I just edited the index.theme file which is placed in the icon theme folder. I inserted the line MinSize=24 under each [icon size] with Type=Scalable. For me it worked for MeliaeSVG icon on Ubuntu 15.10 using Unity.

The problem was due to my user old profile.The old profile uses old Ubuntu settings and it has problems so I have refreshed my configuration using the steps given in this Ubuntu Forums thread. I also reinstalled lightdm.\nSteps from the post:\n\nUbuntu keeps all user settings and data in each users home folder (/home/username). Most of the settings files for all applications are hidden files and folders (dot files as they start with a . eg .bashrc). This makes up any user's \"user profile\".\nI simply wanted to reset my user profile to default as I had upgraded from 8.10 and wanted a clean slate with settings for 9.04 (I would copy most data/documents over etc)\nThe easiest way would be to just create another user and use that for testing but I wanted to keep the same username. So you would think it would be easy but there are more steps than you think...\nTarget username is fred\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Create another administrator user (needs sudo access etc) under Administration > Users and Groups \n  \n*Log on as that new user and go to the terminal\n  \n*First back up the old profile just in case:\nsudo mv /home/fred /home/fred.old\n\n  \n*Create new home folder\nsudo mkdir /home/fred\n\n  \n*copy the skeleton (default) profile folder contents into the new folder. this gives you tab completion for bash and some other default settings etc\nsudo cp -r /etc/skel/* /home/fred\n\nand to copy the hidden dot files/folders\nsudo cp -r /etc/skel/.??* /home/fred\n\n(originally I did sudo cp -r /etc/skel/.* /home/fred as it made sense to me but laughed when I saw all of /etc (included because the glob catches ..) in my home folder)\n  \n*You don't need to do this but to move the old profile folder back into the new one for easier browsing etc do the following:\nsudo mv /home/fred.old /home/fred/\n\n  \n*Last we need to set the ownership and the group membership for the new folder back to fred so (note the capital R):\nsudo chown -R fred /home/fred\nsudo chgrp -R fred /home/fred\n\n  \n*That should do it. Now log off and on to your old user and everything should be back to defaults and you should be able to browse the fred.old folder in your home (probably delete it after you have moved everything over)\n\n\nA: I've got an ASUS laptop with Nvidia Optimus GM820 and I installed Kubuntu 15.04 with Plasma 5.2 (5.3 version seems buggy in my computer, with several crashes in configuration options and others).\nAccording to Kubuntu Drivers Settings, my nvidia recommended driver was 340.47. If I selected this choice, I got a black screen instead of my login screen. I had to press Ctrl-Alt-F1 and change the nvidia mode from nvidia to intel (sudo prime-select intel). After days of searching through the web, this is what I did to fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Drivers configuration select the nouveau driver, so I left the nvidia 340.47 driver without use.\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Go to Terminal and type: \nsudo apt-get remove ^nvidia \n\n(this erases all the files of the 340.47, or other drivers version, installed previously)\n\n*Go to Accounts and mark autologin in your user\n\n*Go to SDDM advanced settings an mark autologin, selecting your user (with these two configurations, you'll be able to avoid the SDDM login screen that is the guilty of the black screen)\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Go to Terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-346 nvidia-prime nvidia-settings\nsudo apt-get update\n\n(It's very important to install the 346 version because I wasn't able to make it work with the 340.47 version)\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nIf everything goes ok, you'll be able to access your desktop directly (without the SDDM login screen) and you'll be working with the ndivia driver (type \"nvidia\" in the menu and the application nvidia-settings will appear, showing the working mode of your graphical card). If you run glxgears you'll see a very higher rate of FPS than before (with nouveau or nvidia intel mode I got 60FPS and with nvidia 346 I got 1700FPS).\n\nA: Not sure if it is the same issue as I'm on ubuntu with Unity. But here with an optimus laptop nvidia 650M with drivers 355.11 and 358.16 (and older with prime) I have a similar issue. I couldn't solve but if like me you can hear the login sound but the screen is frozen here is an ugly but simple workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch sleep mode (using keyboard key or closing your laptop screen depending on your sleep mode config)\n\n*Recover from sleep mode\n\n\nYou are now back on the login screen and it's unfrozen.\nThe reason seams to be that nvidia drivers are not loaded on login screen or something like that.\n", "Q: How to copy (or move) a file to a folder that is not existing while i am performing the copy (or move) operation?

The command is designed to work without user  inter‐\n         action.\n\nThis is curl.\nThe command sudo apt-get install curl means you are going to download and install curl into your system.\nSo when you use sudo and every time you use sudo you will be asked for your password to ensure that you have permissions to do things for your system\nRead this and this for more information about sudo.\n\nA: First let's look at each part of the command individually:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo is short for \"substitute user do\" and executes commands as another user. Most commonly, it is used to temporarily become \"root\" (Linux equivalent of admin). Software installation would not work without sudo in the front. This is the part of the command that needs your password. For security reasons, you should always try to use sudo rather than straight-up logging in as root.\n\n*apt-get is one program in the apt suite, which deals with software installation and management. Linux distributions typically feature a package manager that is used to install, configure, and remove software; Ubuntu uses apt as described here.\n\n*install tells apt-get to install a package on your computer. The command will search through your repositories (typically just the official Ubuntu repositories via the internet) for a package, download it, copy it to your computer, and configure it. For more specifics see this question.\n\n*curl tells apt-get what package to install. Specifically, curl is a data transfer program, and is commonly used to download websites or files via the command line. More details available on its manpage.\nSo, putting everything together, you are going to download the package curl from the internet and install it by giving the apt-get program root privileges.\nAs Calimo noted in his comment, you should be careful executing random terminal commands you find on the internet. And you should be VERY careful executing any command that starts with sudo, since it has the potential to damage the really important parts of your system.\n\nA: Running a sudo someCommand will not even check if that command exists/is valid/in the PATH. The moment the shell sees sudo, it will prompt for a password.\n\nA: whenever you use a command  starting with sudo, it means that you are using the computer as a root privileged. And every command that make change to a computer should start with sudo because Linux needs to make sure the administrator is making those changes. \nyou can also prompt a sudo sucommand before any other commands. so that you do not need to enter your pass-phrase every time you want to change the computer settings. \n", "Q: Lock specific apps for each workspace in Ubuntu How can I make unity launcher remembers which apps are pinned to  it for each workspace and  automatically changes the Launcher when I switch between workspaces.\nKnowing that I'm using Ubuntu 15.04\n\nA: Unity LauncherSwitcher (LSwitcher) is a new tool which can be used to to control which apps should be pinned on the Launcher depending on the current workspace.\n\nAvailable in  Ubuntu 15.04, 14.10 and 14.04.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:vlijm/lswitcher\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install lswitcher\n\nWatch this video\nsource\n", "Q: Tether Ubuntu bq phone How do you tether a bq Ubuntu phone to a laptop by usb or bluetooth? -- [is there an application?]\n\nA: Does not seem to have an app for it, but can be done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your device via USB, enable Developer Mode in: \"System-Settings->About This Phone->Developer Mode\"\n\n*Run (from your PC, making sure to have the phone screen unlocked, else adb will refuse to let you in):\nadb shell android-gadget-service enable rndis\nThis will enable tethering. It will also disable MTP (USB file access). You can re-enable MTP later with:\nadb shell android-gadget-service enable mtp\nIf the adb command above fails, it might be because the vendor of the phone is unkown (it was for me in 14.04).

In the device \"System Settings\" there is now a \"Hotspot\" section to achieve it painlessly.\n\nA: Now there is an app. But you have to install the Open Store as described here.\n\n*\n\n*In summary you just have to run the following two lines in the phone terminal (taken from the comments from Zachary Igielman):\n\n\nwget http://notyetthere.org/openstore/v1/openstore.mzanetti_0.2_armhf.click\npkcon install-local --allow-untrusted openstore.mzanetti_0.2_armhf.click\n\n\n*\n\n*Then open up the Open Store via the now installed app with the same name and update it.\n\n*Then install TweakGeek (no password request) or Ubuntu Touch Tweak Tool (password request).

I tried:\nxterm -title whatever (that is what xterm --help suggests)\n\nxterm -T whatever (according to man pages, this is the same as --title)\n\nbut well, my xterm always comes up showing username@hostname:~ in the title. I guess that this title comes from some environment variable; but I would prefer if I do not have to make a permanent change to my .bashrc or .profile just to be able to create one xterm with a fixed title?!\nThis is xubuntu 14.04\n\nA: I know this thread was active a few years ago, but here is what I did recently. First, realize that the default configuration for XTerm is a little bit different now than it was in 1993 and just using the -T command line option won't work without changing a few configuration items for your X session files, .xinitrc and .Xresources. (You can check if these files exist by typing ls -a in your home (~) directory.)\n\n*\n\n*The .xinitrc text file in your home directory must have the first line\nxrdb -merge .Xresources\n(or whatever your resources file is named (it could be .Xdefaults)).\nThis will activate the resources when X starts. If there is no .xinitrc file, you will need to create one. Make sure the last line in the file executes your window manager exec mwm, exec twm, etc.\n\n\n*The .Xresources text file in your home directory must have the line\nxterm*allowTitleOps: false\nxterm*Title: yourtitle (if you want a custom default title for all xterm windows)\nAgain, if the .Xresources file doesn't exist, just create one.\n\n\n*Last of all, use the xrdb -merge .Xresources command to make the changes take effect immediately. You should now be able to use the -T and -n options for any new xterm windows.\n\nA: Use\nxterm -xrm 'XTerm.vt100.allowTitleOps: false' -T whatever\n\n\nA: To answer the \"question\" from the comment\n\nI have to start a command line tool that should sit in the background (doing port-forwarding for me)\n\n\nInstead of relying on an open xterm, you can run the program with nohup in the background, e.g.\nnohup /path/to/port-forwarding-tool 2>&1 &\n\nnohup will answer with\n\nnohup: ignoring input and appending output to 'nohup.out'\n\nThis will keep the programm running, even if you close the xterm.\nIf you're not interested in the program's output, redirect it to /dev/null\nnohup /path/to/port-forwarding-tool >/dev/null 2>&1 &\n\n\nAnother option would be to start the tool as part of your desktop session, although this might depend on the desktop used, e.g. .xsession or autostart folder.

Have installed Ubuntu 14.04 on an old HP Probook 5310m & a HP 431. I installed it from USB stick and overwrote Windows 7.\nEverything looks good EXCEPT, WiFi doesn't work on either computer. On the Probook, the hard WiFi button on the right of the keyboard is orange (meaning off). Pressing it doesn't help. The system doesn't even seem to see that the pc has a WiFi adapter. On the HP 431, the WiFi is on the F12 key, but no combination of buttons will turn it green (constantly orange).\nI've tried running rfkill unblock all in the terminal, but am unsure if I did correctly (how can I tell if I'm \"running as root\"?). Anyway, didn't help, still no WiFi and orange button.\nAlso tried the \"take battery out, reboot, F10\" suggestion above. Didn't help, there was no options in the BIOS setup that seemed to be related to WiFi state.\nInterestingly, on the Probook, if I go to \"Settings/Network\" pressing the WiFi switch seems to turn on and off Airplane mode, but still no WiFi with or without airplane mode being pressed. On the 431 it at least sees there is a WiFi adapter, but under the wireless sign, \"WiFi is disabled\" is shown but is grey and can't be changed. When I go into settings, it won't let me turn on the WiFi...\nCan anyone help? I can supply more information, but you may need to instruct this noob into how to get it.\n\nA: In case of your probook, you can install the b43 firmware and see if the issue is solve. A detailed description and how-to is here. \nIn summary, if you can use LAN connection in your probook, follow there instructions (if you are using Ubuntu 12.04 - 14.04). In the terminal type:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\n\nRestart your computer.\nThere is also an option to install this if you can not access internet from your probook.

Will it fit on 30-40GB drive?\n\nA: It depends on how much Windows needs and we can't answer that here.\nUbuntu / can be as small as 10 Gb. If you add 5 Gb for a /home/ and do not create a different partition and do not use that /home/ but put the directories inside it onto the 2nd hard disk you will have more than enough with 15Gb. \nFrom Ubuntu's view you can do\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1 mount as NTFS for C: Size will be size of disk -/- 15 Gb for ...\n\n*/dev/sda2 mount as ext4 to / with 15 Gb\n\n*/dev/sdb1 mount as NTFS to a directory you name with all of the Gb's that 2nd disk holds and you can mark this in Windows as D: \n\n\nThis also makes it so that you can share personal files between the 2 operating systems.  The remainder in the SSD can be used for Windows but you will have to check how much is needed. \nI would go for a 120 Gb SSD though. The relative price seems to be better for this size and that size makes it certain you will have enough space (basically you could give Ubuntu 20 Gb for / with /home/ in it and have roughly 100Gb for Windows (that should be more than enough for all software you install).\n", "Q: arm linux gcc compiling.. exported path in .bashrc doesn't work with sudo but it works with su I'm a 1 week long linux user.\nI've added \nexport PATH=$PATH:/opt/FriendlyARM/toolschain/4.5.1/bin\n\nto .bashrc for friendlyarm project and it works nice.

Any idea.\n\nA: It is fairly normal to have a few megabytes between partitions (some software do this purposefully, and as some have said, are necessary to have). To remove these few megabytes you will need to move the partitions above the unallocated space down. This will group the unallocated space so that you can combine the space left over into another partition.\nFor a few megabytes, this is simply not worth it. This would take quite a while (many hours), can put quite alot of wear on the disk, and has the potentiality of data loss, or corruption.\n\nA: Partitions need to be aligned on particular boundaries. Although disk data is referred to in 512 byte sectors, modern drives work on much bigger sectors internally. So having a partition boundary that is not aligned to the disk physical page size can have a very serious performance hit. \nThis is especially relevant for SSD drives. These have page sizes of 4096 bytes or 8192 bytes. \nThe gParted software will try and make sure that partitions are aligned so will leave small portions of the disk unused to achieve this. \nThere is a good discussion of Partition Alignment here.\n", "Q: Cannot configure tex-common after failed font installation I tried to install some fonts for my university's corporal design, this failed.

There are \"local user\" tex-related files in /root, which is the  root user's home directory --- seems like you tried to do a user-local font installation as root, which is a no-no.\nNow, even if you un-installed everything with something like apt-get remove --purge, notice that the files in the home directories are never touched by the package system --- even the /root ones. \nThere should be no tex-related things in /root --- you are not supposed to run TeX &co as root, really.

I want to download programs like Cmap tools or Geany to a removable drive, but I don't now how.\n\nA: If you want that you need to install and compile the source version of that package and during compilation provide an installation path to the removable drive.\n\n*\n\n*Geany building from source.\n\n*Cmap tools is not open source so it totally depends on what is inside the .BIN file you get when you download it. If installing it asks for an installation path you can provide it but it probably will extract itself to the default locations. If so it will not be possible to put onto a removable drive.\n\nFor Ubuntu to work with that software that removable drive needs to be EXT and can not be NTFS.\nI would suggest to forget this idea. It is a lot of work and you will also have to manually update this software when there is a new version or if there are bugfixes.\n\nA: The nature of .deb packages doesn't allow you to change the install location of programs. The whole philosophy of the Unix-like systems is based on the strict directory settlement: we have separate place for configs (/etc/), for libraries (/var/lib), etc. \nIf you want to carry a program, it must to be compiled as static at least, and it will not be upgradable in the normal way.   \nIt would be better to carry just the user-specific settings (found in your home directory).\n", "Q: Rebuilding a RAID 1 array on a production server (Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS) I manage a production server which has a RAID 1 array with two identical hard drives.

It doesn't work even if launched manually. Returns 102 every time.\nsystemctl stop works fine for my service. \nSomehow the invoke-rc.d works for the web server:\nsudo invoke-rc.d nginx stop\n\nWhat is going on?\n\nA: The invoke-rc.d command is for sysv init scripts (as its manpage says), not Upstart or systemd. Nginx still has a sysv init script (look for init.d in the filelist), which is probably why invoke-rc.d works for it (or seems to, anyway).\nEven though the Debian guides use invoke-rc.d, on Ubuntu, prefer using the service command. It is a wrapper script that can handle sysv init, Upstart and systemd files.\nThe systemd documentation recommends using service too:\n\nIf your distribution removes SysV init scripts in favor of systemd\n  unit files typing /etc/init.d/foobar start to start a service will\n  not work, since the script will not be available. Use the more correct\n  /sbin/service foobar start instead, and your command will be\n  forwarded to systemd. Note that invoking the init script directly has\n  always been suboptimal since too much of the caller's execution\n  context (environment block, umask, resource limits, audit trails, ...)\n  ended up being inherited by the service, and invocation via\n  /sbin/service used to clean this up at least partially. Invocation\n  via /sbin/service works on both SysV and systemd systems. Also, LSB\n  only standardizes invocation via /sbin/service anyway. (Note that\n  some distributions ship both systemd unit files and SysV scripts for\n  the services. For these invoking the init scripts will work as\n  expected and the request be forwarded to systemd in any case.)\n\nOf course, for Ubuntu, service is located at /usr/sbin/service.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Centrify Not able to login through GDM We have an Active Directory Server running in my company.

Usually I can find help just by googling cause stuff is so well documented. But I can't figure this problem out when I try to install gparted I get this error. Any ideas?!

One of the first bad habits you have break coming from windows is downloading software. \nI know how it can be to be used to downloading an .exe from where ever and running it to install but Ubuntu has a secure repository containing tens of thousands of apps preconfigured for your specific arch and version (no more downloaded viruses!).\nTo install gparted (or any software for that matter) you have a few choices.\n\nFirst, you can do this via the command line line by executing the following two commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nIf you still get the same errors, run the following command:\nsudo apt-get install gparted=0.18.0-1\n\nor \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall gparted=0.18.0-1\n\nYou should have the proper dependencies available for this version (0.18.0-1).\nAlso, to search for software via the command line you can execute the following commands:\napt-cache search gparted\n\nTo narrow the search results, use grep like so:\napt-cache search gparted | grep gparted\n\n\nNext, use the ubuntu software center:\nThis method is probably the easiest, just search for software center on your dash, open the app, do a search, and if you see something you want to install, click install.\n\nFinally, use the synaptic package manager:\nTo install:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install synaptic policykit-1\n\nThen, to run synaptic, press ALT + F2, type:\nsynaptic-pkexec\n\nand then press ENTER \nSearch for and select software. Click on apply to install selected applications.\nYou can even use synaptic to fix broken packages.

Unlike I stated above, communications from the shell back to the terminal application is possible, very limited, through such escape sequences (there are a few more).\nAbout this from above:\nPROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne \"\\e]0;YOUR TITLE GOES HERE\\a\"'\n\nIt can work, but it doesn't always. PROMPT_COMMAND is a variable which contents is executed each time you send a command, so it also sends this escape sequence. However, this can be overriden by an escape sequence in the PS1 variable, which sets the command line prompt. This is why the above had no effect here.\nFrom an older Ubuntu installation I grabbed this, which sets the command prompt (right part, after the ]) and also sends the required escape sequence (left part, up to and including the ]):\nPS1=\"\\[\\e]0;\\u@\\h: \\w\\a\\]\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ \"\n\nThis likely performs better, because there's no need to interpret $PROMPT_COMMAND each time. It also has many more options, because Bash has more escape sequences here, e.g. \\u for the current user name, \\W for the current directory name or \\w for the entire path of the current working directory, optionally trimmed to just the last few by the number in $PROMPT_DIRTRIM.  See chapter PROMPTING in the Bash man page. Also take note that the escape sequence has additionally to be surrounded by \\[ and \\] here.\nTo set a fixed title, this works:\nPS1=\"\\[\\e]0;YOUR TITLE GOES HERE\\a\\]\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ \"\n\nEnjoy!\n\nDuring my investigation I also tried to understand gnome-terminal source code, which leads to vte source code and there the support for title setting and reading escape sequences is considered to be a security risk: See here (case 20, case 21) and here (\"Window Title Reporting\").\n\nA: Setting $PROMPT_COMMAND as shown above has zero effect here. No surprise, because Bash runs inside the terminal and parent processes (here: gnome-terminal) can't read a child's environment on a unix-like OS. \nUsing something more simple, like\nPROMPT_COMMAND='echo bla'\n\nExecutes echo bla, nothing else happens.\nEdit: one has to wrap this in escape sequences, see my other answer. Despite reading the child environment isn't possible, some communication back to the parent is, through these sequences.\nIn Gnome bug 740188 they talk about defining a title() function in .bashrc. A different one for each tab opened? Severe ugly hacking ahead, if possible at all!\nEven other explanations on Stackexchange talk about setting $PS1 (and get upvoted). Sorry, no, that's not the title, that's the command prompt.\nIn short: they messed it up beyond repair to save a tiny bit of space in the preferences dialog. OMG\nNow, the only chance to get a developer decision reverted is to kindle a severe shitstorm, else they simply close your bug report in seconds (tried many many many times). How would we create this shitstorm?\n\nA: The .bashrc solution proposed by Kirby worked for me:\nset-title(){\n  ORIG=$PS1\n  TITLE=\"\\e]2;$@\\a\"\n  PS1=${ORIG}${TITLE}\n}\n\nthen from my prompt: $ set-title test-title\n\nA: Answered here\nI quote:\n\nThe user title code was removed1 from gnome-terminal 3.14. There's only one way to set the title, using an escape sequence - e.g. with bash:\nPROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne \"\\033]0;YOUR TITLE GOES HERE\\007\"'\n\n\n1: see gnome bug 724110 and gnome bug 740188.\n\n\nA: I can't believe they removed such a user friendly feature like this one.\nI'm switching to ROXTerm (http://roxterm.sourceforge.net), which does the job nicely. It's packaged in Ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install roxterm\n\nThen, let the dinosaur continue its own way ;-)\n\nA: I've tried RoxTerm as suggested above, with good results.  But I settled on MATE Terminal, which is part of the MATE Project, a continuation of Gnome 2, on 15.04:\nsudo apt-get install mate-terminal\n\nThat terminal is based on the Gnome Terminal code.\n\nCommentary:  It's hard to understand the mindset of the Gnome Terminal devs.  There's a lot of discussion over there about \"how\" to name terminal tabs, and how it's difficult to get right.  If that's the case, why make it harder for the user to name them?  Not very smart at all.\n", "Q: Problem with keyboard after reinstall 'ubuntu-desktop'?

I'm using Gnome classic on 15.04 and this world seems to not allow the old xfonts in. Yes, I have a terminus true-type version in my .fonts, but it's garbage. I'd like to use the real xfonts version of terminus in my terminal and in Emacs.\n\nA: Most modern programs use fontconfig to access all sorts of fonts so you usually don't see the old-style font specifiers like -xos4-terminus-medium-r-normal--12-120-72-72-c-60-iso10646-1 any more.\nFontconfig prefers fonts you install in ~/.fonts/ over system-wide installed ones with the same name. So in your case fontconfig used the TrueType version of Terminus in ~/.fonts. When you removed the TrueType font fontconfig used the system-wide installed Terminus font from the xfonts-terminus package.\n", "Q: Can I choose which OS I want to startup with while booting I have Windows 7 Professional. Will the system ask me with which OS it will start (Windows or Ubuntu) on startup or will it load only Ubuntu?\n\nA: Yes, if you installed Ubuntu after Windows 7, GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) will keep track of all the OSes on your system and allow you to choose which you want to boot on startup.\nGRUB is what is known as a Bootloader, and Windows uses a transparent one that just boots the OS.

It normally defaults to Ubuntu, and will load the default OS after a 10 second wait period, but you can manually choose and have it boot Windows.\n", "Q: AMD Catalyst Installation on Ubuntu; No supported adapters detected I'm trying to install AMD Catalyst on my Linux Mint 17 (Ubuntu 14.04) OS.\nMy notebook has switchable graphics, Intel HD 3000 and Radeon HD 7550M.\nFollowing lots of instructions here and other blogs, I was able to install Catalyst 14.9.

Most of the available holes are on your end. For instance, storing your passwords for your banking site on your system is likely a bad idea unless you keep your computer in a vault. You might want to avoid banking over wireless (especially public wifi which isn't typically encrypted to the level available on  private wifi) to avoid broadcasting encrypted data (which could possibly be decrypted). I would consider the combination of login and security questions along with the other security features (which differ slightly from bank to bank) to be sufficient.\n\nA: Does your bank not have two-factor authentication?  Most nowadays have a keypad you need a code from to access the banking. Other than that, man in the middle attacks are the main concern as far as I see it.\n", "Q: Trouble installing Elementary desktop environment on Ubuntu 15 I am trying to install elementary-desktop on Ubuntu 15.04 but when running sudo apt-get install elementary-desktop I get a slew of recommends/errors with this at the top:\nelementary-desktop : Depends: ubuntu-extras-keyring but it is not    installable\n... long list of Recommends\n\nand this at the bottom:\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nEDIT: To clarify, yes this post is about Ubuntu.

I have a Ubuntu 14.04 installation on my 32gb USB drive. I recently read that having a Swap causes a lot of reads and writes to the drive making the OS slow and reducing the lifespan of the drive. When I checked my RAM usage yesterday using free, out of 4GB about 3GB was being used, and out of 1.5GB of Swap, 900MB was being used. Is it safe for me to just delete the swap partition?\n\nA: Read below first!\nHi Ian,\nyes you could delete Swap with a live stick, but I don't recommend this. This may cause issues, depending on what OS you are using.\nThere is a much nicer way to do that:\nFire up a terminal (ctrl + alt + t), then type\nsudo swapoff /dev/hdb2\n\nreplace hdb2 with your swap partition directory. You can get the directory by typing\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nSo now your swap should be disabled. Then just remove the swap entry from /etc/fstab.\nYou can do this by typing\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nThen hit enter and remove the line which extends the swap informations.\nREBOOT!\nAfter that you can easily delete the swap partition with gparted or a partition application of your choice. But I recommend you to first let it be there.\nSTOP, BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING MENTIONED ABOVE, READ THIS:\nYou are right, a swap partition produce much of traffic, but this might not make the OS slower.\nAnother possibility instead of deleting the swap is to customize it:\nFire up a terminal and run this:\nsudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nThen add this line:\nvm.swappiness=10\n\nThis customizes the swap, when it should be used. As lower the swapiness is, as less swap will be used. 10 is already extreme less. So swap will only be used in the worst case when there is absolutely no more RAM available.\nThat's it!\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I turn off swap permanently?\n\n*Removing Swap Space\n\nA: Not really, no.\nHowever, instead of disabling swappiness, you can run a script such as Zram to use compressed ram memory as swapspace instead of using a physical partition so that your system doesn't crash.\nSTEP ONE:\nExecute the following command in an open terminal:\nsudo nano /etc/init.d/zram\n\nAnd copy/paste the following into the file:\n### BEGIN INIT INFO\n# Provides: zram\n# Required-Start:    $local_fs\n# Required-Stop:     $local_fs\n# Default-Start:     S\n# Default-Stop:      0 1 6\n# Short-Description: Use compressed RAM as in-memory swap\n# Description:       Use compressed RAM as in-memory swap\n### END INIT INFO\n\n# Author: Antonio Galea <antonio.galea@gmail.com>\n# Thanks to Przemysław Tomczyk for suggesting swapoff parallelization\n\nFRACTION=75\n\nMEMORY=`perl -ne'/^MemTotal:\\s+(\\d+)/ && print $1*1024;' < /proc/meminfo`\nCPUS=`grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo`\nSIZE=$(( MEMORY * FRACTION / 100 / CPUS ))\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n  \"start\")\n    param=`modinfo zram|grep num_devices|cut -f2 -d:|tr -d ' '`\n    modprobe zram $param=$CPUS\n    for n in `seq $CPUS`; do\n      i=$((n - 1))\n      echo $SIZE > /sys/block/zram$i/disksize\n      mkswap /dev/zram$i\n      swapon /dev/zram$i -p 10\n    done\n    ;;\n  \"stop\")\n    for n in `seq $CPUS`; do\n      i=$((n - 1))\n      swapoff /dev/zram$i && echo \"disabled disk $n of $CPUS\" &\n    done\n    wait\n    sleep .5\n    modprobe -r zram\n    ;;\n  *)\n    echo \"Usage: `basename $0` (start | stop)\"\n    exit 1\n    ;;\nesac\n\nThen, press CTRL + o to save the file and press CTRL + x to exit the file.\n\nSTEP TWO:\nFirst, disable disk swappines:\nsudo swapoff -a\n\nThen, execute the following three commands in an open terminal to make the script executable, to start zram, and to make zram automatically start at boot:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/zram\nsudo /etc/init.d/zram start\nsudo update-rc.d zram defaults\n\n\nSTEP THREE:\nOnce you have enabled zram swap, you must edit /etc/fstab so that disk swappiness is not enabled at boot:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nLocate the line that begins with:\n# swap was on . . .\n\nAnd place a # at the beginning of the following line to change it from:\nUUID= . . . \n\nto this instead\n#UUID= . . .\n\nexample:    \n# swap was on /dev/sdb5 during installation\n#UUID=abcd65432-d109-e8765-f43-210987ghi654 none            swap    sw              0       0\n\nor you can delete the line instead.\nFinally, press CTRL + o to save the file and press CTRL + x to exit the file.\nNo need to reboot. Also, you can verify zram is in use by executing the following command:\nsudo swapon -s\n\nSources:\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/ZRam\nhttps://code.google.com/p/compcache/\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zram\n\nTo explain:\nWhile you may have 4GB of ram and may not be \"using\" a lot of ram for what you are running, linux uses up the remaining ram as cached ram to actually reduce disk activity by caching used applications to ram rather than having to page them from disk next time you open the application. When cached ram fills up ram or when an application needs to use the ram the cached data occupies, the system swaps out some of the cached ram to the swap partition to free up ram for applications in use and to cache more recently used applications in ram.\nAlso, some form of swappiness is necessary in order to hibernate and/or suspend.\nBecause of swappiness, your system is able to better utilize your available ram, reduce overall disk activity, and dramatically increase system responsiveness when under a heavy load all while preventing system crashes from maxed out ram. \n", "Q: What is the release schedule for Lubuntu Alternate patch releases?

Arch Linux was installed successfully and I made new EFI partition when installing arch linux. I can boot to Arch Linux.\nWhen I select Ubuntu in grub, I enter in emergency mode and GUI is not started, instead I get single user mode.\n\nA: It sounds like Arch hasn't set up its GRUB to handle Ubuntu properly. In a sense, that's an Arch problem, not an Ubuntu problem; but I do have a suggestion for how to repair the problem using Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Prepare a boot medium from the downloaded files.\n\n*Boot to your rEFInd medium.\n\n*Test rEFInd's ability to boot both Arch and Ubuntu. Ubuntu is the priority. Depending on how you installed, you might be able to boot by selecting a kernel and hitting the Enter key; or you might need to hit F2 or Insert twice and add a root={whatever} option, where {whatever} is a partition device filename, LVM device filename, or UUID number. Entering boot options is most likely to be required if you used a separate /boot partition, but Arch is weird in its kernel naming and so it may require adding an explicit initrd={initrd-file} option to work, too.\n\n*If you can boot either OS, back up your EFI System Partition (ESP). A file-level backup (using cp or tar) to a USB flash drive should be sufficient.\n\n*At this point:\n\n*\n\n*If Ubuntu boots from rEFInd but Arch doesn't, try re-installing GRUB from Ubuntu. Note that you'll need to adjust /etc/fstab to mount your new ESP at /boot/efi and then run sudo grub-install.\n\n*If Ubuntu and Arch both boot from rEFInd, you can do as above; or you can install rEFInd from its PPA or Debian package and use it as your primary boot manager instead of GRUB.\n\n*If Arch boots from rEFInd but Ubuntu doesn't, or if neither OS boots from rEFInd, then you've got a bigger problem. I recommend running Boot Info Script, posting its RESULTS.txt file to a pastebin site, and posting the URL to your file here.\n\n\n\nNote that re-installing GRUB from Ubuntu is something of a gamble, particularly with respect to its ability to boot Arch. The worst likely scenario is that re-installing GRUB in this way will reverse your problem -- you'll be able to boot Ubuntu but not Arch. It's conceivable it will make everything much worse, though. That's where the ESP backup comes in handy; if you make things work, you can restore your ESP to its current state using an emergency system, and with any luck it will begin to work as it does now and you'll be able to try something else.\n\nA: Since Arch Linux made new EFI partition, I just had to update the new UUID of this partition in the /etc/fstab of Ubuntu installation which can be done by live booting and edit the file.\nA point to conclude here is that EFI partition made by one linux distro can be used by other.\n", "Q: How do I set up Awesome with MATE?

I figured MATE desktop is a modern version of GNOME 2, so I am trying to set up Awesome with MATE, but to no effect.\nI am trying to use the part of the tutorial that describes steps for GNOME <2, namely:\ngconftool-2 --type bool --set /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop false\n\nand\ngconftool-2 --type string --set /desktop/gnome/applications/window_manager/current /usr/bin/awesome\n\nor\ngconftool-2 --type string --set /desktop/gnome/applications/window_manager/current /usr/bin/awesome\n\nthen writing\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=Awesome\nComment=The awesome launcher!\nTryExec=awesome\nExec=awesome\n\nto ~/.local/share/applications/awesome.desktop.\nThere's no effect. Here's what another tutorial on the topic says to do:\nCreate the following file at /usr/share/xsessions/Xsession.desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Awesome + MATE\nComment=Awesome + MATE\nExec=/etc/X11/Xsession\n\nCreate the following file at ~/.xsession\n#!/bin/sh\nmate-session &\nawesome\n\nSign out, then choose \"Awesome + Mate\" clicking on the little cog in the upper right corner.\nRemove the MATE panel at the bottom, remove the notification area from the one at the top, go to \"Properties\", and uncheck \"Expand\".\nDisable the desktop icons in Control Panel -> Look and Feel -> MATE Tweaks\n(where is Control Panel?)\nAnyway, this still doesn't quite work. Firstly, I install MATE on Ubuntu with\nsudo apt install mate-desktop\n\nBut the option to select MATE when clicking at the cog in the greeter doesn't appear until I install\nsudo apt install mate-session-manager\n\nas well (should I install something else?) Now, when I do everything above, when I choose \"Awesome + Mate\" at the greeter cog, the awesome desktop briefly flashes, to be replaced with MATE completely. Now, when I log off in MATE, I am back in awesome. When I quit awesome, I'm back at the greeter. Not what I expected when I opted for \"Awesome + Mate\" experience.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: The tutorial you mention didn't work for me at first.\nFirst, the file in ~/.local/share/applications/awesome.desktop is not recognized; you should put it in /usr/share/xsessions\nSecond, with this desktop entry you would only start awesome, but you may also want to have gnome-session, mate-session or xfce4-session (or whatever your session manager is, as long as its loads the Gtk theme, Wifi applet, sound manager, etc.) To do this, create a desktop entry that just calls Xsession:\n$ cat /usr/share/xsessions/Xsession.desktop \n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Xsession\nComment=Xsession\nExec=/etc/X11/Xsession\n\nThen write a .xsession file in your user directory:\n$ cat ~/.xsession\n#!/bin/sh\nxfce4-session &\nawesome\n\nFinally, select the \"Xsession\" entry in lightdm and you should see awesome fire up with the rest of your session.

I am trying to upgrade to Ubuntu 15.04 but I need to delete some files in the /boot directory. When I cd /oot I can't type a b. So, I thought, I will list the files in the / directory and copy/paste, but to no avail. I can't even paste a b.\nUpdate 2\nI recently added some lines to the /etc/inputrc file in order to get better tab auto-completion:\nset completion-ignore-case on\nset show-all-if-ambiguous on\nTAB: menu-complete\nbind TAB:menu-complete\n\n\nOriginal Question\nWhen I ssh into my ubuntu server I can't type the letter \"b\". I can however type a capital \"B\" using either shift keys.\nI'm using a MacBook Pro with Retina display from 2012, and I'm ssh-ing into a custom built ubuntu box. It is here that I can't type a lower case \"b\".\nI have restarted the server and yet I still can't type a \"b\". Every other letter is fine.\nIt hasn't done that before, I've had the server up and running for about two years and haven't come across an issue like this before. I also haven't done anything notable to cause it to do that.\nAt first I thought the keyboard was a little sticky but when I closed the connection it works fine. I've restarted the server, ssh'd back in and the \"b\" key stops working again.\nI've tried my bluetooth keyboard and still no luck.\nCould this be something that is a rule in a .profile or .bashrc file or something similar? A setting to not allow certain characters.\nWhen I try to type the letter \"b\" I get the terminal bell sound as if it is not allowed.\n\nA: Inside the ssh session, start a cat command and see whether you can type b there. I'm almost sure it'll work, which means that it's your shell that decides not to act on b.\nAssuming the default bash, you should check readline's configuration files: ~/.inputrc, /etc/inputrc, or the one referred by $INPUTRC. Chances are you'll find an accidental lone b on its own line (or something similar), instructing readline not to do anything upon encountering this character.\nUpdate\nLooks to me that the first three lines of your .inputrc are correct, it's the fourth line (bind TAB:menu-complete) causing the trouble. Change its first letter to anything else (e.g. find instead of bind) and then that letter (e.g. f) will misbehave. Apparently bind is not a recognized keyword in this context.\n\nA: TAB: menu-complete\nbind TAB:menu-complete\n\nShould just be\nTAB:menu-complete\n\n", "Q: sweethome3d and easytether not working on ubuntu 15.04 I clicked the upgrade button from version 14.10 to 15.04. sweethome3d and EasyTether do not work. I went to Ubuntu Software Center uninstalled sweethome3d and reinstalled and it still will not start. \nI also got the latest copy of EasyTether (easytether_0.7.4-1_amd64.deb) reinstalled it and it connects but it will not connect to the internet. I have a dual boot to 14.10 and both these programs work fine on 14.10 with the same hardware. Which is HP TouchSmart 14 Sleekbook and using HTC Droid DNA for the easyTether connection.\n\nA: For easytether, autoconfig does not work because they upgraded network-manager.\nConfigure the network interface manually with dhclient, there should be instructions in the terminal when you run easytether. \n\nA: This problem with SweetHome3D, which I also experience, may caused by the 'systemd' switchover in Ubuntu 15.04. A similar issue has been found with ESET Nod32 Antivirus and is solved for that specific app here... \nhttp://kb.eset.com/esetkb/index?page=content&id=SOLN3723&locale=en_US\nThat worked for me with ESET but to compose an analogous script to put into /lib/systemd/system for SweetHome3D is well above my paygrade. Hopefully, if the solution does lie in that direction, someone may oblige? \nEDIT - OK, so I thought I'd try opening Ubuntu 15.04 in Advanced Mode - 'Upstart' option. Because if the recent systemd switchover is the main cause, then this should work round the problem. But it still wouldn't launch. So back to normal boot and Terminal: sudo sweethome3d . Then it launched, after a delay and some comment about creating a particular folder for Java.\nI haven't tried actually using it yet. So, who knows...  \n\nA: Easytether\nI had the same problem with easytether, and running the recommended dhclient command did not correct the issue. My solution was to download instead the package intended for Mint 17.1 (v.0.8.3-1) and install it. From there, I ran from the terminal:\nnohup sudo easytether-usb &\nsudo dhclient tap-easytether\n\nWhich allowed me to connect, albeit easytether is no longer showing up as a network connection as it did when I ran Ubuntu 14.X. I haven't had much opportunity to test the stability or security of this - I frankly have a limited knowledge of the differences between Ubuntu and Mint, but I haven't had any issues so far.\nSweethome3d\nI was able to download the newest version of Sweethome3d (v.4.6) from the download page and it ran without issue on my Ubuntu 15.04 installation. I then tried downloading and running the version from the Ubuntu Software Center (v.4.5+dfsg-3) and was unable to get it to run (it just throws a LOT of exceptions).

The workaround to that is to add gnome-settings-daemon to Startup Applications or add it as a .desktop entry, into /home/yourusername/.config/autostart/ directory. The .desktop entry could be named gnome-settings-daemon.desktop and look something like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=gnome-settings-daemon\nHidden=false\nName=gnome-setting-daemon\n\nThis is my guess on why that daemon isn't starting: Ubuntu 15.04 , from what I've heard, has switched for different system for starting processes at boot - there used to be upstart and 14.04 (which is what I use) has that. Meanwhile 15.04 uses systemd .

I've got a number (lets say 13) and I want to find where it would belong in an incomplete numbered list.  Here is an example list:\n1\n3\n4\n5\n9\n16\n17\n21\n\nObviously the 13 would go between the 9 and the 16, but how do I grep for the next highest number given that I have the number 13.  i.e.  How would I create a grep for 16 given that I have 13?\nThe reason I'm asking is because I want to use sed or awk to insert a line based on a search parameter, but I can't figure out how to grep to find the location.\nPlease let me know if I need to clarify as it's somewhat hard for me to explain.\n\nA: Maybe not what you wanted, but as you are actually trying to insert a value, I'd personally append the number to the list and then use sort -n to bring things into the correct order.\nSuch a command could look like this (if the list is in a file):\necho 13 | cat listfile - | sort -n | sed '/^$/d' | cat - > listfile\n\n(Replace the 13 by the number you want to insert, maybe the variable x, so the command sequence would start with echo $x |)\nFor explanation, I'll split it up:\n\n\n*\n\n*echo 13 | outputs the number 13 to stdout, which is then piped into the next command\n\n*cat listfile - | first takes the contents of the listfile, afterwards   everything from stdin until an EOF, and then pipes the concatenated result to the next commands' stdin\n\n*sort -n | takes the piped list and sorts it taking the numeric nature of the input into consideration (as given by the -n switch, also see man sort)\n\n*sed '/^$/d' | removes any empty lines from the string, and forwards it again\n\n*cat - > listfile puts the whole thing back into listfile again. Yes, this works as opposed to things like sed 's/a/b/g somefile > somefile', which would empty the file.\n\n\n\nIf you want to split it up into multiple commands, you can make the thing a bite more legible by always operating on the file:\necho 13 >> listfile\nsort -n listfile\nsed -i '/^$/d' listfile\n\nThis can also come in handy if you need to add multiple entries. Simply append them all and then sort (which may be faster than searching for insertion positions each time).\n\nAbove command also works if you are operating on variables. For this, the content of the var has to be present as a string using newline separation so it can be sorted line-wise.\nIf the values are e.g. space separated, you could use the following command\nlist=$(echo $list 13 | sed -r 's/\\s+/\\n/g' | sort -n | sed '/^$/d')\n\nApart from the variable assignment, the only new command is the first sed, which replaces any contiguous sequence of whitespace characters (including newlines) by newlines to create line-separation. In the variable assignment, the list will be automatically converted back into space-separation.\n\nA: AFAIU it is nearly impossible to GUESS unless you know the range of numbers next to the number you got. For example, the next number could be 14, could be 50, could be 1000. If you know the range the next number will be in then you can do it easily:\n$ grep -E -m 1 \"1[4-9]|2[0-9]|3[0-9]|4[0-9]\" file.txt\n16\n\nHere i am searching for numbers greater than 13 and the range is 14<= NUM <= 49. -m 1 ensures that grep will stop after finding the first match, in this case the next number after 13 in the file.\nEDIT: If you are not sure, you can try this script:\n#!/bin/bash\ni=14\nwhile :; do\n    grep \"$i\" file.txt 2>/dev/null && break || i=$((i+1))\ndone\n\nSet i as the number you got plus 1. It will go through the file searching for numbers greater than 13, if found the number is shown and the operation ends otherwise the number will be incremented by one and the search will continue.\n\nA: If you want use awk to insert something, then use it directly:\nawk 'flag { print \"I am inserting stuff\"; flag = 0} $1 > 13 && !seen {flag = 1; seen = 1} 1'\n\nWith your example:\n$ awk 'flag { print \"I am inserting stuff\"; flag = 0} $1 > 13 && !seen {flag = 1; seen = 1} 1' foo\n1\n3\n4\n5\n9\n16\nI am inserting stuff\n17\n21\n\n", "Q: monitors.xml and LightDM Firstly some background information:\nI have a 4 monitor situation, with varying resolutions - 2 monitors landscape (1680×1050,1920×1200) and 2 monitors portrait (both 1050×1680). Once I'm logged in my resolutions and monitors relative positions are all set up fine, but the trouble I'm having is with the login screen. \nAt the login screen all 4 displays are on, however their positions and rotations are all incorrect. \nI've temporarily fixed the problem using an xrandr script and a display-setup-script in my lightdm.conf however I'm after a neater solution as this will fail if any monitor is unplugged before login. \nFrom guides here and elsewhere, I've found that apparently creating a symbolic link of ~/.config/monitors.xml in /var/lib/lightdm/.config/ should allow my login screens resolutions to follow my desktops resolutions. \nMy problem is when I create the link, I get a permissions error upon login. \"Unable to apply screen configuration from /var/lib/lightdm/.config/monitors.xml:Permission denied. \nI've chown'ed the symbolic link lightdm:lightdm and even tried giving all rwx permissions to both monitors.xml and the symbolic link and finally i've ensured that my monitors.xml is current by deleting it and re-applying my screen settings. \nAny idea on where my permission denied error is originating?

Here's output of mine:\n$ ls .mozilla/firefox/b1ygiwi1.default/ | head      \naddons.json\naddons.sqlite*\nblocklist.xml\nbookmarkbackups/\ncert8.db*\ncert_override.txt*\ncompatibility.ini*\ncontent-prefs.sqlite*\ncookies.sqlite*\ncookies.sqlite-shm*\n\nThe other directory actually contains different types of cache, as wie5Ooma already mentioned.\nSo if something would be going wrong, you'd might want to try altering or deleting completely whatever is in ~/.mozilla/firefox/ to restore settings to default. \nThere is also cache in .macromedia/Flash_Player\\#SharedObjects/ which belongs to flash player if you use that, like s.ytimg.com from youtube.\n\nA: This is my location for all stuff, including songs from sites .cache/mozilla/firefox/[random characters].default/cache2/entries\n", "Q: Pre-installed GStreamer 0.10 does not recognized the installed element \"ladspa-gate\" I am new to gstreamer, and wanted to set it up such that I can explore most plugins (good, bad, ugly, etc.).\nI recently started using gstreamer 0.10 and intended to use it to process audio files.\nI needed to use \"ladspa-gate\" which belongs to the GStreamer Bad Plugins 0.10.\nRunning gst-launch-0.10 --version to show what version of gstreamer is preinstalled shows gst-launch-0.10 version 0.10.36.\nI also ran the following to install gstreamer-plugins-bad (not sure if I needed all of them but I just thought it wouldn't hurt to get them all)\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse-dbg gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-doc gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-dbg\n\nAfter the installation, I was expecting ladspa-gate to work because it belongs to gstreamer-plugins-bad (according to - http://www.freedesktop.org/software/gstreamer-sdk/data/docs/latest/gst-plugins-bad-plugins-0.10/gst-plugins-bad-plugins-plugin-ladspa.html), but when I tried running\ngst-launch-0.10 filesrc location=\"audio.mp3\" ! mad ! ladspa-gate Threshold=-30.0 ! alsasink\n\nit resulted in\nWARNING: erroneous pipeline: no element \"ladspa-gate\"\n\nAfter that, I started to look for similar issues on the internet, and tried removing the old registry\nrm -fv ~/.gstreamer-0.10/registry*\n\nIt still did not work.\nThen I proceeded to run\ngst-inspect-0.10 ladspa\n\nwhich resulted in\nPlugin Details:\n  Name:                 ladspa\n  Description:          All LADSPA plugins\n  Filename:             /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-0.10/libgstladspa.so\n  Version:              0.10.23\n  License:              LGPL\n  Source module:        gst-plugins-bad\n  Source release date:  2012-02-20\n  Binary package:       GStreamer Bad Plugins (Ubuntu)\n  Origin URL:           https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/gst-plugins-bad0.10\n\n  0 features:\n\nand ll /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-0.10/libgstladspa.so did show that there is such file (-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 18920 Apr 15 14:07 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-0.10/libgstladspa.so).\nHowever, if I run gst-inspect-0.10 | grep ladspa it shows nothing, which I interpret it as ladspa plugins are not properly setup (maybe even the entire gst plugins bad), therefore is not registered as a ready-for-use plugin.\nAnother thing probably worth mentioning is that there are two directories under /usr/lib which contains gstreamer-0.10 related files, which are /usr/lib/gstreamer-0.10/ and /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-0.10/; I suspect that /usr/lib/gstreamer-0.10/ came from other gstreamer related packages I installed along the path of trying to solve the issue, because my other ubuntu machine does not have such directory, but does have the other directory.\nNext thing I might try is doing a fresh install from source, but I hope I don't have to go there. I'd like to avoid unnecessary messing-around.\n\nA: I made the assumption that there are no other dependencies needed other than the gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad package.\nHowever, I was stupid, and I was wrong.\nRunning\nsudo apt-get install ladspa-sdk cmt\nrm -fv ~/.gstreamer-0.10/registry*\n\nwould solve the problem.\nNow gst-inspect-0.10 | grep gate gives ladspa:  ladspa-hard-gate: Hard Gate\n", "Q: Preserve files in /tmp using systemd in 15.04 If possible I'd like to preserve /tmp/foo/* across boots.

My laptop is a Dell XPS 13, model 9333. The behaviour started when I upgraded to 15.04 (from 14.10), and to Gnome 3.16 (from 3.14).  Unfortunately I'm not sure which upgrade caused it, because I did them both at the same time.\nWhat happens is pretty straight forward.  I hit shutdown, the shutdown process does its thing until the screen goes blank, but the laptop remains powered on (the little light at the front of the laptop, and the keyboard backlight, stay powered on).\nWhen this happens my laptop does disconnect from Wi-Fi. Nothing appears to happen when I try to switch to other TTY (ctrl alt F1,2,3,4...) - perhaps something is happening and I'm not seeing it because the screen is off, I don't know.  The machine DOES appear to disable it's wi-fi when I use the fn+wifi toggle button (because on my next boot the laptop is in \"airplane mode\").\nThe only way to power my laptop down when this happens is to hold the power button.  After powering down like this I have sometimes (not always) had the next boot run a filesystem check and then dump me into an emergency console, where reviewing the logs in journalctl -xb tell me I need to run e2fsck on sda9 before I can boot - so I do that e2fsck /dev/sda9 -y and then reboot, and everything works fine.\nDoes anybody have any ideas how to start debugging this issue?  Are there any logs I can check, and anything in particular to look for to identify why the laptop is not powering off?\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks,\nRob\n(edit) Looks like this must be a gnome 3.16 problem.  Shutting down after logging into Unity works fine, but shutting down from the Gnome lock screen or from logging in to Gnome consistently fails.  Any idea how to debug this further?\n(edit 2)  More info.  Running sudo shutdown -h now fails when ran via a terminal window in Gnome.  Running sudo shutdown -h now via tty1 (when logged in to gnome or when the gnome lock screen is open, on tty7 (i think)) results in a successful shutdown. Running sudo shutdown -h now via unity results in a successful shutdown.  The problem is clearly confined to Gnome 3.16 then. :\\\n\nA: I have upgraded to Gnome 3.16.1 and I am no longer having this problem.

it took me 2 hours to figure out what it was. \nIn the USB stick I was using there were remaining deb files from a Debian distro in the hidden trash folder (.local/share/Trash/). I had erased the USB stick using nautilus and I did not worried about hidden files. Ubuntu in some way mapped those files into its apt repository and used in the install.\nTo solve this issue, I formated the USB stick and installed again the Ubuntu. I used UNetbootin.

Either that or your drivers aren't working properly... I had this issue with an old monitor and a custom modeline sorted it right away :P\nYou can add the native resolution modeline (1920x1080_60.00?) and then you should be able to switch to it, any other resolutions will probably need one too...

I then bookmarked the different shares on the drive individually and it works like a charm when I'm at home. Of course, when I'm at work or on any other WiFi network, the bookmarks won't work, so how do I access my WD MyCloud in Ubuntu when I'm not home? Under Windows, you would use the WD MyCloud software to gain access, but of course there is no Linux version available (yet?). Any ideas? I couldn't find any existing posts, the ones I saw where only concerned to get access while you are on your home network, and that works fine.\n\nA: First, you need the public IP address assigned to your router/modem by your ISP. Most ISP assign dynamic IP's, which can change regularly. E.g. the public IP of my router changes daily at 3AM.\nSome routers (like some AVM FRITZ!Box or D-Link models) offer a service which, when a new IP address is being assigned, the automatically upload this IP to a webserver. When you register for such services, you are given a URL which will then always be redirected to the IP stored on the server.\nShouldn't your router provide such a service, your ISP may. (Although I don't know any specific ISP that does.)\n\nNow, after above problems are dealt with (or if you receive a static IP), we can take care of the SMB access. SMB uses port 445 by default, which means that you have to create a forwarding rule in your router, which may look like this:\nIncoming port: 44555 # or whatever... just something else than 445 to prevent\n                       automatic attacks against port 445 on random IPs\nForward to:   <smb share IP/MAC> #whatever your router offers\nForward to port: 445\n\nNow you should be able to access your SMB share from all over the internet. Should you have multiple NAS's, the easiest way is to either use a different \"Incoming port\" for each share, or attach them all to a single host, which has to run a SMB server (although I think that could be problematic with MyCloud...)\n", "Q: Create a file command to terminal I have downloaded a program that does not need installation through the web;\nHow can i create a command for the terminal to open that specific command:\nExample: open terminal, type unity-control-center to open system-settings\n\nA: I assume your question goes like that: \"How do I execute a downloaded program, which is not installed in the systems default executables directory?\"\nIf you only want to use the program for a short period of time, simply mark it as executable with\nchmod +x path/to/my-program\n\nNow, you can run it with\npath/to/my-program\n\nShould your working directory be the one the program is inside, it doesn't suffice to write program. Instead, you have to do\n./my-program\n\n\nIf you're gonna keep it, though, the most practicable thing to do is to install it manually by placing it in /usr/local/bin, the directory intended for executables not managed by the package manager.\nMove or copy the executable there using\nsudo mv /path/to/my-program /usr/local/bin/ # or sudo cp...\n\nAlso ensure the file is marked as executable, which is normally not true when it was downloaded from somewhere:\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/my-program\n\n\nShould the program come with any special libraries or resource files, things may become a bit more complicated. If you want to comply to standards, you should move those files to /usr/local/share/my-program/, else just move them to /usr/local/bin, too (and hope noone ever sees that except for you ☺ )\nNow, your program may not find those files on its own. If this is true, you can create a launcher script, e.g. /usr/bin/local/start-my-program or whatever you like:\n#!/bin/bash\nenv PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/share/my-program/ /usr/local/bin/my-program\n\nAlso, make this one executable again with \nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/start-my-program\n\n\nA: Couple of points :\n1) That fine/binary has to be placed somewhere in your path. echo $PATH to know what folders are available. Preferably you'd place it in /usr/bin or create bin folder in your home folder, and add that folder to your $PATH\n2) The binary/executable must have permissions -rwxr-xr-x when you list it with ls -l mybinary. Use chmod +x mybinary to achieve that that.\n3) Once binary is in folder that is part of your $PATH and is executable, there is a myriad of ways to run it. One, you can type it in terminal just like you wrote in your question, another way is to create alias to it; there's also an option to create a custom shortcut that will open the terminal and run that command. For that open System Settings -> Keyboard -> shortcuts tab -> Custom -> click + sign, and name it whatever you want; for command , write gnome-terminal -e /path/to/your/binary or xterm -hold -e /path/to/your/binary\n", "Q: How do I setup a tunnel piercing scenario on my Ubuntu client to access the internet through my own server including port knocking on it? Google isn't my friend with this long term issue which is up to date for my upcoming holidays again.  \nIt would be great if you could provide a road warrior setup for DNS as well as IP tunneling as a backup solution. \nKeywords are: iodine (DNS) httptunnel (IP) \nand maybe these programs for the port knocking(?):\nfwknop-apparmor-profile, fwknop-client/server, knockdd (IP and DNS)\n\nI would also really appreciate any hints to howtos or other tutorials or best practices.\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: IP Tunneling could be achieved by a PPTP VPN.

Curtin by default will call \"curtin block-meta simple\". The command searches for a disk to perform the installation on, the error you are seeing is because your system has no disks that curtin can install to. Make sure that the system you are deploying to has a disk that is writeable.\nIf you system does have a disk present, this most likely means that the kernel is unable to enumerate this storage device. You can try a hardware enablement kernel to see if drivers for your device are available in a newer kernel. Set the architecture on a node to \"amd64/hwe-u\" or higher to get a newer kernel. If this still does not work then it means your need some other driver enablement to allow the curtin to be able to install to your device.\nI have documented this information in bug 1451490 as well.\n", "Q: Drupal Runtime error...

Unfortunately it doesn't exist in Vivid and was dropped.  It was replaced by a more updated libgcrypt - libgcrypt20.\nInform the upstream where you got the .deb from that they should test against libgcrypt20 and if it still works they need to specify that as the dependency instead of libgcrypt11.  If it won't work with that newer package then the software won't work at all.\nUltimately the people producing the .deb have to fix this - there's nothing you can really do to fix this yourself.\n\nA: Same problem here with an older version of Atom, install an older version of the library from here and it works and there are no conflicts.\nsudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/<your_library>\nsudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/Brackets*\n\nIf the dependence is corrected later, then you can remove this library with:\nsudo apt-get remove libgcrypt11\n\n", "Q: After new Ubuntu 15.04 installation, startup asks for password even though no disk encryption was set up I installed a brand new SSD into my laptop and did a fresh install of Ubuntu 15.04, with NO system encryption used (only Home directory encryption).

Swap is always encrypted in case encryption for home was activated as userdata might be swapped out and then become unencrypted. \n\nA: This is not the correct solution and as Christian says in the comments bellow it will make it less secure. But if the encryption is not a priority for you you could use this workaround.\nFirst find the partition that has the swap\nsudo fdisk -l\n[sudo] password for kempe: \n\nDisk /dev/sda: 233,8 GiB, 251000193024 bytes, 490234752 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\nDisklabel type: gpt\nDisk identifier: B59D4149-AC8E-4B71-B51F-8926B2E82C14\n\nDevice         Start       End   Sectors   Size Type\n/dev/sda1       2048    409599    407552   199M EFI System\n/dev/sda2     409640 253319775 252910136 120,6G Apple HFS/HFS+\n/dev/sda3  253321216 269320191  15998976   7,6G Linux swap\n/dev/sda4  269320192 490233855 220913664 105,3G Linux filesystem\n\nIn my case swap is on /dev/sda3\nthen turn off swap\nsudo swapoff -a\n\ndisable cryptswap\nsudo cryptsetup remove /dev/mapper/cryptswap1\n\nRemove the corresponding line in /etc/crypttab. I only had one line in there but you might have more so be sure that you remove the correct on\nsudo vim /etc/crypttab \n\nSetup new swap area (remember fstab output)\nsudo /sbin/mkswap /dev/sda3\nsudo swapon /dev/sda3\n\nand finally fix fstab line\nsudo vim /etc/fstab\n\nreplace /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 with /dev/sda3\nEnable and disable encrypted swap - Ubuntu\n\nA: I was able to solve this issue with the following steps:\nFrom a command prompt, run gnome-disks\nFind which device is your swap drive. Mine was /dev/sda3\nls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/\nFind the ID that is symlinked to your swap partition\nsudo vim /etc/crypttab\nOn the line beginning with cryptswap1, change the UUID=… portion to /dev/disk/by-id/ID-HERE. Save and reboot.\nIf you are still prompted for a password, run:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdaX bs=512 count=20480\nReboot again.\n\nA: Run sudo fdisk -l to find swap partition (i.e. /dev/sda6)\nGrab UUID in /etc/crypttab or sudo blkid for /dev/sda6 (replace device with your swap)\nRun sudo swapoff /dev/sda6\nRun sudo mkswap -U UUID /dev/sda6 (replace UUID and device with your swap)\nAppend ,offset=1024 to the end of cryptswap line in /etc/crypttab\nAdd \"/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0\" to /etc/fstab\nRun sudo update-initramfs -u\nRun sudo swapon -a\nCheck swap is active with sudo systemctl status /dev/mapper/cryptswap\n\nA: This problem still exists even on Ubuntu 15.10. I've made temporarily solution - turned off encryption for the swap partition (home is still encrypted). This guide worked for me in this case. This passphrase request is no longer warring me on booting system and updating software.\nMaybe, later I will turn on the encryption of the swap partition back (using the same guide), when I will know, that this bug is fixed.\n\nA: The best solution is to deactivate (uncomment) the classic swap line in fstab(not the mapper). if you then reboot and type sudo swapon --summary you should get a swap partition on /dev/dm-X (usually 0). If yes, be happy cryptswap is working well.\n\nA: As an alternative to solve the bug, the init process may be switched to upstart, since this is a bug related with systemd. Here is stated that upstart may be used as a workaround.\nTo do so, the easiest way is to install the corresponding package:\nsudo apt-get install upstart-sysv\n\nAfter the installation, you still are able to start the system with systemd in the grub \"Advanced options for Ubuntu\" sub-menu, with an option called “Ubuntu, with Linux … (systemd).”\n", "Q: How to identify malicious .deb files / sources? When I download and a .deb file from the web and open it in the Ubuntu Software Center it says \"Only install this file if you trust the origin.\" But it's not at all clear to me how I am supposed to evaluate an origin such as www.whatever.com is trustworthy or not. \nI understand the degree of risk inherent in installing software which is not in a trusted repository and/or not open source. I'm interested in managing that risk because I have found a number applications fall into this category (e.g. Skype).\nSo is there not a website or something that tracks packages which are known to be malicious or suspicious?\n\nA: After asking this, I noticed that even for these kinds of packages, user reviews show up in Software Center. At least if there were ransomeware or something very obviously malicious in a package, users could report it as a negative review.\n", "Q: Error message on booting up Ubuntu 14.04.2 After upgrading from kernel linux-image-3.13.0-49-generic to linux-\nimage-3.13.0-51-generic, I am getting this error message in dmesg on startup:\n[ 6.352555] mei_me 0000:00:16.0: irq 47 for MSI/MSI-X\n[ 6.355708] mei_me 0000:00:16.0: version message write failed: ret = -5\n[ 6.355712] mei_me 0000:00:16.0: hbm_start failed ret = -5\n[ 6.355714] mei_me 0000:00:16.0: reset failed\n[ 6.355716] mei_me 0000:00:16.0: link layer initialization failed.\n[ 6.355717] mei_me 0000:00:16.0: init hw failure.\n[ 6.355880] mei_me 0000:00:16.0: initialization failed.\n\nWhat do I do to correct this?\n\nA: Are you able to log-in?

Mysql is a huge bottleneck for my server.  I have tried everything of which I am aware to raise the open files limit for mysql.  I have added open-files-limit = 2097152 to my.cnf.  I have added the following to limits.conf:\n* soft nofile 2097152\n* hard nofile 2097152\n* soft nproc 2097152\n* hard nproc 2097152\nmysql soft nofile 2097152\nmysql hard nofile 2097152\nmysql soft nproc 2097152\nmysql hard nproc 2097152\n\nI have added session required pam_limits.so to /etc/pam.d/common-session* and /etc/pam.d/sudo and a couple of others.  I have tried restarting mysql after reboot - no change.  I also checked /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld to see if it was involved but the file is empty.  After all that I still get the following:\n# ulimit -Sa\ncore file size          (blocks, -c) 0\ndata seg size           (kbytes, -d) unlimited\nscheduling priority             (-e) 0\nfile size               (blocks, -f) unlimited\npending signals                 (-i) 256538\nmax locked memory       (kbytes, -l) unlimited\nmax memory size         (kbytes, -m) unlimited\nopen files                      (-n) 1024\npipe size            (512 bytes, -p) 8\nPOSIX message queues     (bytes, -q) 819200\nreal-time priority              (-r) 0\nstack size              (kbytes, -s) 8192\ncpu time               (seconds, -t) unlimited\nmax user processes              (-u) 2097152\nvirtual memory          (kbytes, -v) unlimited\nfile locks                      (-x) unlimited\n\nWhen I run # mysqld --verbose I get this:\n150501  0:19:35 [Warning] Could not increase number of max_open_files to more than 1024\nDoes anyone have any idea as to what is blocking this change???\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no straight answer here. The stuff in /etc/security/limits.conf is read only by PAM stuff, during login, not during boot.\nSo, if you want mysqld to have it's ulimits altered you'll have to twiddle with the init script. \n", "Q: I want to ignore \"apt-get -f install\" When I want to install a new package, I get this error:\nYou might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:\nThe following packages have unmet de pendencies:\ncndrvcups-capt:i386 : Depends: cndrvcups-common:i386 (>= 2.60) but it is not installable\nE: Unmet dependencies.

First Inbox worked fine, but now Inbox is pretty much unusable with Firefox. Switching to a fresh Firefox profile didn't solve the problem, weirdly the glitches were now mostly black.\nDo you have any scaling enabled?

I want to build a package for my app, written with C++ and QML.

I can run the app without any trouble using qmlscene.\n\nA: You didn't specify what type of package you wish to build.  I'm going to assume that you want to build a click package, suitable for installation on an Ubuntu phone.\nIf you're using Qt Creator with the Ubuntu SDK plugin, there is a \"Publish\" tab on the the left-hand side. Select that, and then click the \"Build and validate click package\" button.  The click package will be placed in your build directory.\nTo build a click package from the command line, first place all the files into the correct (relative) hierarchy in a temporary directory.  The manifest.json file must be in this directory.  Keep in mind that any architecture-dependent files must have been generated in an appropriate chroot.  You probably want your make install step to set this up for you.  Then run click build /path/to/temp/directory, and you'll get the click package, named with the appropriate values from the manifest file.\nClick packages are very similar to deb files.  You can inspect their contents with file-roller, but only if you rename them to end in .deb.\nFor more details about building click packages, including some helpful commands for building in chroots, see this blog post.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS showing 'version message write failed' message while booting The following lines are getting displayed while Ubuntu is booting.\n[   27.981086] mei_me 0000:00:16.0: irq 60 for MSI/MSI-X\n[   27.985007] mei_me 0000:00:16.0: version message write failed: ret = -5\n[   27.985071] mei_me 0000:00:16.0: hbm_start failed ret = -5\n[   27.985123] mei_me 0000:00:16.0: reset failed\n[   27.985166] mei_me 0000:00:16.0: link layer initialization failed.\n[   27.985224] mei_me 0000:00:16.0: init hw failure.\n[   27.987404] mei_me 0000:00:16.0: initialization failed.\n\nI've been using it for around 4-5 months now and this is the first time I got this message.

I have multiple instances of Firefox running in Ubuntu 14.04. How can I close the most recently opened window/instance from the Terminal?\nI tried using the cfct alias defined in an answer to a related question, but it didn’t work.\n\nA: To close a window (also with many opened tabs) use that command:\nwmctrl -a firefox; xdotool key Ctrl+Shift+w\n\nNotice, that wmctrl and xdotool must be installed:\n$ sudo apt-get install wmctrl xdotool\n\nSee also that answer: Close current tab firefox using terminal.\nMy answer is a bit modified, because Ctrl+Shift+w closes a firefox window.\n\nFor all shortcuts, see Firefox Keyboard shortcuts.\n\nA: To make a command that finds the id of the last window, created by Firefox (and to close it), you will need wmctrl to be installed:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nThe command\nThen use the command:\nwmctrl -ic \"$(wmctrl -l | grep 'Mozilla Firefox' | tail -1 | awk '{ print $1 }')\"\n\n\nExplanation:\nwmctrl -l\n\nlists all windows, but an important property of the command is that it lists the windows in the order they were created. \nTherefore:\nwmctrl -l | grep 'Mozilla Firefox' | tail -1 | awk '{ print $1 }'\n\nwill:\n\n\n*\n\n*list all windows:\nwmctrl -l\n\n\n*find the ones (the lines) with 'Mozilla Firefox' in their name:\ngrep 'Mozilla Firefox'\n\n\n*find the last one (which is also the last created one):\ntail -1\n\n\n*extract the first string in the line (which is the window -id):\nawk '{ print $1 }'\n\nThe command:\nwmctrl -ic\n\nwill then kill the most recent Firefox window by its id (gracefuly).\nOr even more reliable:\nWhile the command above works well in practically all cases, there is a small chance of name clashes, if e.g. another window exists with \"Mozilla Firefox\" in its name, but not a window from Firefox (unlikely, but still).\nWhat should work \"waterproof\" is therefore to identify the windows in the window list (using wmctrl -lp) by the pid of firefox, instead of the string in the window name:\nwmctrl -ic \"$(wmctrl -lp | grep \"$(pgrep firefox)\" | tail -1 | awk '{ print $1 }')\"\n\nAs you can seen, in this command,\nwmctrl -l | grep 'Mozilla Firefox'\n\nproducing the lines containing 'Mozilla Firefox', is replaced by:\nwmctrl -lp | grep \"$(pgrep firefox)\"\n\nproducing the lines containing the pid of firefox (as the output of pgrep firefox)\n", "Q: BlueZ gatttool notifications I am working over the BlueZ Library gatttool but when I run the gatttool  command as mentioned below, it starts giving me notification endlessly.

Similarly I don't know any superuser do password. I am confused in this password matter.\nEXAMPLE:\n$ sudo aplay -l\n[sudo] password for deepak:\n\nI don't know what to do in the previous password asking command. Similarly like above example, for many times I am asked for sudo password. How can I resolve it?\n\nA: It's just your regular password.\nThe password to run commands with sudo is your password, not a separate password. It is the same password that:\n\n\n*\n\n*you came up with and typed in when you installed Ubuntu or created your account\n\n*you type in on the login screen (unless you have automatic login)\n\n*you type in to unlock the screen\n\n\nWhen you're asked for your password in a terminal, it is normal that nothing is shown while you are typing it. To enter your password for the sudo command, type it in and press Enter.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you enter your password correctly and you are an administrator--which on Ubuntu means a user who is allowed to perform actions as the root user through sudo and polkit--then the command will run. (Non-administrators can be permitted to run certain commands with sudo too, but this is not set up by default.)\n\n*If you enter your password correctly but you are not an administrator and aren't allowed to run the command as root with sudo, you'll get an error:\nusername is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.\n(\"Reported\" just means written to a log file. Attempting to run a command with sudo on your own computer that your user account isn't set up to be allowed to run is harmless, and the scary \"This incident will be reported\" thing can be ignored.)\nTo see if you're set up to sudo to root, check if you're in the sudo group.\nAnother way to find out if your user account is an administrator and allowed to run commands as root with sudo is to check if it's a member of the sudo group. To list all the groups you're in, run:\ngroups\n\nUsers are usually in their own group (named the same as their username) and several other groups. If you're an administrator the output of groups will look something like:\nusername adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare\nIf you're not an administrator it will look something like this (i.e., it will not contain sudo):\nusername adm cdrom dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare\nIf you only have one user account and it's been removed from the sudo group, see How do I add myself back as a sudo user? This is not a very common situation, though.\nFor more detailed information, you can ask sudo about your abilities.\nA third way to find out if you're an administrator is to run sudo -l. You'll have to enter your password. Then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Non-administrators who aren't set up to run any commands with sudo will see the message\nSorry, user username may not run sudo on host.\nwhere username is your username and host is the hostname (computer name) of your Ubuntu system.\n\n*Administrators (i.e., members of the sudo group) will see some information ending in the lines:\nUser username may run the following commands on host:\n(ALL : ALL) ALL\n\n*Users who are set up to run some commands as root but not all commands will see output documenting their abilities. (See man 5 sudoers for technical details.)\nFurther Reading\n\n\n*\n\n*RootSudo (in the Ubuntu help wiki -- I highly recommend reading this, to understand sudo in Ubuntu)\n\n*The manpage for sudo, which you can read by running the command man sudo, or online.\n\n*sudo and Superuser on Wikipedia\n\n*Ask Ubuntu's tag wiki for sudo\n\n*How to NOT become a root user?

There is no dead-keys problem with any other app.\nNB02. This doesn't occur in Opera; dead-keys for Greek are OK.\nNB03. This does happen in Mindori (for UTF-8).  \nI did sudo apt-purge firefox, reboot, re-installation but the problem remains.\nCan someone suggest antoher workaround\nIs this due to some bug referring to a Ubuntu 15.04 system parameter?\nPS. I re-installed Kubuntu 15.04; then I installed software and fonts I need checking firefox at each step. The problem re-appeared when I ran ttf-mscorefonts-installer. Un-installation didn't work. So, I un-installed ibus as you guys suggested, and now I have back my dead-keys.\n\nA: I was able to make it work by permanently disabling IBus with the following command (based on this answer):\nim-config -n xim\n\nNot sure whether IBus should be the default input method or not in new  Kubuntu/KDE. So I don't know if this is more workaround or an actual fix (and IBus should not be used at all). Would be nice if someone with more in-depth knowledge can comment on that.\n\nYou can get rid of ibus package completely by sudo apt-get remove ibus (see comments).\n\nA: Try the code im-config -l, if it shows problems setting LC_ALL, put this in your /etc/invironment file:\nLC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\n\naccording with your locale.\nReboot and LibreOffice should now process dead keys.\n\nA: I had similar problems on 14.04 (and now on a freshly installed 15.04), mainly with LibreOffice and Netbeans. A solution was to unset the XMODIFIERS variable:\nunset XMODIFIERS && commandYouWant\n\nSo I made some aliases for those commands. But honestly, I have no clue why this worked (apart from the fact that the problem had something to do with ibus), and what was the exact nature of the problem (more over, the problem was sometimes present, sometimes not, and sometimes suddenly the dead keys stopped working (mostly after switching windows)). \n", "Q: \"A start job is running for /etc/rc.local Compatibility\": how to fix? I just upgraded to Ubuntu Vivid (15.04) today, and after the restart I experienced a very long boot process. My laptop usually boots in 5 seconds or less, and now it hadn't finished even after a few minutes.\nPressing Esc showed the following screen:\n\nThe last line says \"A start job is running for /etc/rc.local Compatibility (7 min 24s / no limit)\".\nDespite the \"no limit\" part, it gave up (or completed ?) after exactly 10 minutes, and the boot process finished.\nThis happens on every boot.\nCould it be related to the transition to systemd? How can I fix this? (Right now, I think twice before shutting down my laptop). Should I report a bug? And if so, where?\nMy /etc/rc.local file:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\nfstrim -v /\nfstrim -v /home\nexit 0\n\nThe file is executable:\n$ ls -l /etc/rc.local\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 333 aug 14  2013 /etc/rc.local\n\nI added the 2 fstrim lines almost 2 years ago, when I installed a SSD, following the instructions from Easy Linux tips project.\nApparently these are the cause of my problem (I removed them and rebooted - the problem was gone), but I still think the system shouldn't hang like that for 10 minutes. Also, how can I run fstrim at boot now?\n\nA: If you put long-running commands in rc.local, your startup will be delayed. You should send these to the background:\n( fstrim -v /; fstrim -v /home ) &\n\nThat said, you  probably don't have to do this yourself. Ubuntu 14.10 added a weekly job for fstrim.\n\nA: Strange that this is suddenly a problem in Ubuntu 15.04, whereas it has always worked well for you in Ubuntu 14.04....\nYou might also add a sleep parameter before the trim, so that the two trim commands will be executed after a set number of seconds. This should allow the boot process to complete, causing the trim commands to be run in the background.\nLike this (40 seconds delay):\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\nsleep 40\nfstrim /\nfstrim /home\nexit 0\n\nThe -v (verbose) parameter for trim has in this case no use, by the way, because it's being run in the background. I've changed that in my Easylinuxtips how-to as well.\nNote: I've only tested such a sleep parameter in rc.local in Ubuntu 14.04 and Linux Mint 17.x (for another purpose than trim), so I'm not sure whether this will work similarly in Ubuntu 15.04.\n\nA: I had the same issue, basically this happens when something in rc.local does not terminate normally such as a daemon of some sort.\nTo find which command in rc.local is the culprit simply to a killall -9 command/from/etc.local and it will reboot once all commands from rc.local are terminated.\n", "Q: Wireless power management turns back on in 15.04 I have turned off power management for my wireless.

The server main task is running a MongoDB installation along with several NodeJS applications. The NodeJS applications will run continuously and will accept requests from outside.\nEvery now and then large requests will come in causing some NodeJS application to use a lot of RAM for a short amount of time. I have been trying to monitor this but am not sure what to make of my findings.\nSo far I have used two commands to get insights in the RAM usage. These are\nfree -m\n\nand\nsudo htop\n\nThe first shows this:\n                        total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached                                           \nMem:                     3442       3158       283          6        111       1203                                           \n-/+ buffers/cache:                  1842       1599                                                                         \nSwap:                    0          0          0    \n\nWhen I look at this I would say that about 280MB of RAM is free. Which does not seem like a lot. \nhtop tells me the following:\n  1  [|||                                         0.8%]     Tasks: 61, 129 thr; 2 running\n  2  [|||                                         1.0%]     Load average: 1.16 1.15 0.93\n  Mem[|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||1979/3442MB]     Uptime: 29 days, 00:23:31\n  Swp[                                           0/0MB]   \n\nI don't really now how to read this. Can anyone help me out here?\nI guess my question in the end boils down to these:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I get some insight in how much RAM is available?\n\n*When is the RAM memory too little? Is 300MB considered very little? Dangerously so?\n\n\nA: TL;DR: You don't have to worry as long as the -/+ buffers/cache row shows enough free memory. If it shows low free memory and you are continuously being swapped to disk then you need to be concerned.\nExplanation:\nYou are good with your current RAM usage scenario. Lets take the output of free -m to break it down:\nAll columns of free -m is self explanatory. The important thing to note that you don't need to be alarmed when the memory usage is high without seeing the amount of memory cached and buffered. \nFrom the output, you have used 3158 MB of your 3442 MB RAM, a plain subtraction would say that you have only 283 MB free to be allocated to new programs. This is not right, you need to look at the cached and buffers columns too, cached will show the a mount of disk data cached by RAM for faster access to the commonly used files and buffered shows the amount of data to be written to the disk. \nAs you know, disk access is much slower that RAM, so to improve performance its a good thing to store some of disks data into RAM. You have 1203 MB of cached and 111 MB of buffered data. This is  a good thing that your memory is caching this amount without just keeping this amount of RAM idle. It will improve your performance greatly. \nTo get the actual amount of RAM that is being used without caching/buffering, look at the -/+ buffers/cache: row. This result is shown subtracting the cached/buffered amount. As you can see you have 1599 MB free, so everything seems Ok at this state. If you see the values in this row is low, then you need to be concerned and take a look at the RAM usage.\nAlso note that, when a new program is to be started and there is not sufficient memory after caching, the older caches will be cleared automatically to make space for the new program. So, as long as the actual memory usage is not high and your are continuously being swapped to disk, it's a good thing to have substantial amount at cache as it is \"using\" your memory efficiently.\n\nA: heemayl already has covered good portion of info about the actual available memory. My post here is merely couple oneliner that you can add to your .bashrc as an alias to use as quick overview of actual usage:\nfree -h | awk '/free/ {getline; x=$2; getline; print \"Used \"$3 \" Out of \" x  }'\nAnd sample output:\n$ free -h | awk '/free/ {getline; x=$2; getline; print \"Used \"$3 \" Out of \" x  }'                                                                 \nUsed 1.2G Out of 5.6G\n\nIf you interested in more in-depth investigation of memory, use cat /proc/meminfo, which lists whole lot of info, and this blog will help you understand how free command calculates stuff from that file.\n", "Q: alt tab doesnt work for citrix xenapp in full screen This question is related, but about 12.04: Alt+Tab doesn't work when Citrix is in full screen \nI am using citrix 13.1 xenapp on Kubuntu 14.04, and the suggestions in that post don't work in this configuration.\nI am unable to get alt-tab window switching working.

My guess is that dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=4096 will work out well for me. I have some concerns though:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the ideal bs size?\n\n*Is it advisable to use a live cd? I simply don't want to include running applications, temp files and other useless files in my clone.\n\n*How much size should the destination be? I hope this will not as be as big as the source.\n\n*How to restore the clone (from the removal disk) back to the laptop?\n\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: bs stands for block size. which mean size of block taken by the dd command.\nIdeal bs refers to your file system files.as u make bs larger as you move faster in cloning.\nand yes it's better to use a live CD to not clone those temp and other unneeded files\nThe size of the destination must be the same or bigger (you can still clone to smaller hdd but it need much more configuration and fixing issues you'll face)\nTo restore the clone easily reuse the dd tool again. now the laptop hdd will be the destination\nTo clone to smaller hard disk refer to How to clone to a smaller harddisk?\n\nOut of dd you can use clonezilla which is a great application for cloning. download the iso file and use it as live CD . It will be much easier for newbies to try \n\nA: I have just gone through this exact process successfully, so at the risk of bumping an oldish thread here it is.\nScenario: Ubuntu 16.04, windows xp dual-boot. There are old windows games I still love which won't run under wine...\nOld Disks:\n1x ancient IDE, with / and swap\n1x 450GB SATA with home directory and winxp partition\nNew Disk: \nspanking new 2TB SATA.\nProcedure: \n\n\n*\n\n*power down. Add 2TB disk. Boot from ubuntu liveCD (I used workstation 16.04). You will need to set up networking somehow for the next step--unfortunately not everything you need is on the liveCD.\n\n*Enable ubuntu universe and install uuid.\n\n    # apt update\n    # apt install uuid\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Start gparted. This tool has a copy function which can resize a partition on the fly. It's a winner.\n\n\nGparted will show the existing partitions and most likely unallocated space on the new drive. Delete everything on the new drive, no need to prepare partitions.\nUsing gparted copy and paste, you can copy any partition and paste it into the unallocated space on the new disk. gparted will do everything needed for the copy and resize operation.\nSo much for the easy bit...\nNow you have your original partitions and the new copies under the liveCD root. At this point you need to do four more things for success:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the partition UUIDs on the copies to new ones. For each copied partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*use uuid to generate a new UUID\n\n*use tune2fs -U [UUID from above step] /dev/[device] to apply it to\nyour COPY. This is so you don't mangle your existing, working system. NOTE:do not do this to an NTFS partition. The UUID is used by windows to validate itself and as I understand it, you are in for trouble if you change it. See below, Cleanup.\nUPDATE: gparted can create a new UUID for you. Only noticed this just now.\n\n\n*Edit fstab\n\n\n*\n\n*assuming you mount your \"/\" drive copy on /mnt\n\n*edit /mnt/etc/fstab and replace the UUID for all old your mounts with those of your copies which you have just changed. If you have mounts using devices only, consider changing this approach which is now well and truly legacy.\n\n\n*Reinstall GRUB2. I used the chroot method, and heartfelt thanks go to Nathan Kidd.\n\n\n\n    mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\n    for dir in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do\n        mount --bind $dir /mnt$dir\n    done\n    chroot /mnt\n    update-grub2\n\n\nThis bind-mount bit appears to be essential but I do not know why grub even cares about these run-time things. However, it seems to be magic. This step even worked out the new location of my XP partition.\n\n\n*In XP itself, the boot.ini may need to be modified. You will most likely need to change the default and multi incantations so the windows boot loader can find everything else. Documentation for this part is in the usual microsofty places. You will know this is the case if you get a message about missing HAL.DLL. Don't start copying files, fix up boot.ini and it should come good. I did this by fuse-mounting the NTFS partition on the liveCD root and editing it by hand.\n\n\nThen you remove your old drives and reboot into the new drive. Worked for me, including windows with no invalidation of licence. YMMV, it seems to be pretty random in my experience.\n\n\n*\n\n*Cleanup: Now that I have a working new drive, I'm going to reboot into liveCD with both of the SATA disks and zap the contents of the old 450GB disk. This is because I believe that if you have two NTFS partitions with the same UUID mounted on the system, Bad Things can happen. I could be wrong...but why risk it? Also, make sure you disable any previously bootable disk in your BIOS. I forgot to do this and wasted a bit of time with a not-booting system until I worked out what was going on.\n\n\nIt can then be reused for something else.

The following code instructs the ifupdown suite to use stateless autoconfiguration and two additional static IPv6 addresses for the eth0 network interface:\niface eth0 inet6 auto\niface eth0 inet6 static\n  address 3ffe:ffff::dead:beef\n  netmask 32\niface eth0 inet6 static\n  address 3ffe:ffff::c0de:d00d\n  netmask 32\n\n\nA: Here is what I did for multiple v6 addresses in interfaces file. First thing to consider is there cannot be two gateways, so you add a route below the second address.\niface ens802f0 inet6 static\n    address 1154::1154\n    netmask 64\n    gateway 1154::130\n\n\niface ens802f0 inet6 static\n     address 1063::105\n     netmask 64\n     up ip -6 route add 1063::/64 via 1063::254 || true\n\n\nA: In the question you reference, the second answer shows the equivalent solution for IPv4. In the case of IPv6, the /etc/network/interfaces file should contain something like this:\niface eth0 inet6 static\n  address 2001:db8:1:2::2\n  netmask 64\n  # Add additional IPv6 addresses when $IFACE goes up\n  up ip -6 addr add 2001:db8:1:2::3/64 dev $IFACE\n  up ip -6 addr add 2001:db8:1:2::4/64 dev $IFACE\n  # Remove them when $IFACE goes down\n  down ip -6 addr del 2001:db8:1:2::3/64 dev $IFACE\n  down ip -6 addr del 2001:db8:1:2::4/64 dev $IFACE\n\nYou will need the iproute2 package installed, but you should use ip instead of ifconfig anyway.\n\nFor adding a whole /64 to an interface: There are some Q&As in serverfault.se, like \"Adding a whole IPv6 /64 block to an network interface on debian\" or \"Can I bind a (large) block of addresses to an interface?\".

In many cases, though, manufacturers or vendors make flat-out false claims about how installing an \"unauthorized\" OS will void the machine's warranty.

How do I have to format the drive in order to create a bootable USB?\nI'd appreciate it if I could get an answer soon... Thanks!\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge, it does not matter how you format (i.e. choice of filesystem) your pendrive. If your aim is to make a bootable pendrive with e.g. Unetbootin it is probably the best to format in VFAT. Given that the pendrive is plugged into the computer and mounted (i.e. you can browse its content) you can proceed as follows from the terminal:\nIdentify the device name /dev/sd* of the pendrive (from its size and/or mounting point) by typing\ndf -h\n\nwhich will produce a list of all partitions currently mounted in Linux. Let us say that your device is called \"/dev/sdc1\". Unmount the pendrive by typing \numount /dev/sdc1  \n\nthis will unplugg it from Linux (do not remove the pendrive physically). To format the pendrive you simply have to type\nsudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdc1\n\nwhich will erase your pendrive and create a new empty VFAT filesystem. (Check that you selected the correct device name before formating.) Now you can toggle the disk as bootable with the cfdisk utility.

But I want to make Windows 8.1 as my parent OS.Can anyone please help me with a complete tutorial that how can I do that. I exactly want my PC ask me to choose an OS on start screen under windows 8.1\n\nA: (Disclaimer: I've only done this on Windows 7, however I understand it should work just as well on 8.1.)\nStep 1\nInstall EasyBcd on Windows.\nStep 2\nMake sure you have a recovery or installation cd/usb for Windows 8. You'll need it. You can generate one from within Windows 8 itself if you don't have one. See http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive for instructions. It might be a good idea to write down your Windows 8 key as well.\nStep 3\nInstall Ubuntu. Follow whatever guide you find for that. Just make sure you don't erase the Windows partition. At this point, you should be able to boot into Ubuntu only using grub, not Windows. You may have an option for Windows in grub, but that isn't what you want.\nStep 4\nBoot into your recovery/installation cd/usb. Choose repair Windows and let it fix the startup problems. When this is done, you should be able to boot into Windows, but not anything else.\nStep 5\nBoot into Windows. Start EasyBcd. Add an booting option, choose \"linux\". Save.

For instance if I open it in nano, gedit, cat, or even the main log viewing program, I get a crash such as this one because there is just too much data in the file to load:\n\nSo really my question is, how can I view syslog without the viewer crashing? Am I doing something wrong? Or is there just a better way that everyone use and I am not aware of?\n\nOS Information:\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.04\nRelease:    15.04\n\n\nA: Try less /var/log/syslog\nPress shift-f to go to the end of file and monitor changes like tail -f /var/log/syslog\nYou should see your log file.\nThere must be some garbage on them or maybe size issues that are preventing the Syslog app to view them. So, rename it and try to open the Syslog app again. You should be able to see your new log file.\n\nA: TL;DR :\nThe problem was due to the file var/log/syslog being very large in size with kernel especially ufw dumping a lot of UFW_AUDIT logs regularly. To solve the problem we need to set the LOGLEVEL of ufw as low in the ufw configuration file /etc/ufw/ufw.conf:\nsudo sed -i '/^LOGLEVEL/s/=.*/=low/' /etc/ufw/ufw.conf\n\nFrom man ufw:\nLoglevels above medium generate a lot of logging output, and may \nquickly fill up your disk. Loglevel medium may generate a lot of \nlogging output on a busy system.\n\nDETAILS :\nThere might be many reasons why the error\nStream has outstanding operation\n\nis shown. The most common two being the file is too large in size to be read and file has unusual contents that could not be read.\nAt first we have considered the first cause i.e. file is too big (i will show the steps one by one as we have done it):\n\n\n*\n\n*At first we need to check how many lines are there in /var/log/syslog and it turned out to be quite unusual:\n$ wc -l /var/log/syslog\n1308061 /var/log/syslog\n\n\n*As the file has 1308061 number of lines which is quite big, we need to check how the logrorate is configured for rsyslog by:\nsed -n '/\\/var\\/log\\/syslog/,/^}$/p' /etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog\n\nThis have shown that /var/log/syslog will rotate every day with logs older than one week being deleted, which is the default.\n\n\n*\n\n*Next we need to check /var/log/syslog to see which process is writing most logs to the file using the command:\nless /var/log/syslog | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f5 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn\n\nThis will show us the processes written most lines in the file in a descending order. We found that kernel has written to file the highest with the count being very high (1761519). The next is thermald with its several processes wrote about 5K times.\n\n\n*\n\n*Considering 1kernel1 as the source of this anomaly, we have checked for a pattern in the /var/log/syslog that is occurring regularly by:\ngrep \"kernel\" /var/log/syslog | less \n\nand found one that was about UFW AUDIT and it was very very regularly writing in the log file.\n\n\n*\n\n*ufw will dump these messages if the LOGLEVEL is set as medium and more. To find the current value:\n$ grep -i \"^loglevel\" /etc/ufw/ufw.conf\nLOGLEVEL=full\n\nThats the source of the problem, to get rid of these regular messages it needs to be LOGLEVEL=low, it should be sufficient in most cases. From man ufw:\nlow    logs all blocked packets not matching the default policy \n(with rate  limiting), as well as  packets  matching  logged rules.\n\nCheck the LOGGING section of man ufw to get more idea on ufw logging.\n", "Q: Applications can no longer access your online account When i try to start my laptop with Ubuntu 15.04 it just says: \"Applications can no longer access your @gmail.com online account\". And then it just reboot. So there is no possible chance for me to login, only in guest session. So what can i do? :)\n\nA: Those are two separate issues. If you have automatic login enabled, you need to login to Gmail in Settings. If you don't have auto login, your system Gmail session expired and you still need to login in Settings. The reboot is not connected to this at all. Make sure your battery is charged and that the power button isn't stuck down.\n", "Q: Managing Events in Shotwell Running Shotwell 0.20.2.\nShotwell recognizes events based on the date of the photo.\nI have three cases where this leads to problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Multiple events on the same day.

Maybe you should use digiKam or darktable.\n\nA: For your first case (multiple events on the same day), there's a workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select photos from a specific event.\n\n*Go to Events menu->New event (or press CTRL+N).\n\n\nA new event will be created with the same date, but just with the photos you choosed. Rename it as you like, and repeat for each event in the day.\n\nA: As for Collections (photos on different dates that you want to see together), you can always create an event (for example with the first photo in the collection) and then drag all remaining photos to this newly created event. \nYou will lose somewhat the perception of dates (the full collection will show in a specific day until you open it), but since the theme is probably more important than the date, perhaps it's not such a big deal.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 on Mac using live USB gives corrupt display I have been trying to get Ubuntu to work on my desktop Macintosh running on OS X Yosemite but it doesn't seem to be starting up properly.

Why not? Are Ubuntu builds deterministic? I assumed they are, that is, if I recreate the process of building Ubuntu installation media, I will get the same image, (bit-for-bit, with the same checksums) as the one on the Ubuntu mirrors.\nRecent post by Joanna Rutkowska (lead developer of Qubes OS distro) suggests that it isn't so:\n\ncurrently most projects, including all Linux distributions, do not build deterministically\n\nWhy not?\n\nA: No they're not. Let's clarify a distinction here,\n\n\n*\n\n*Does the system support \"reproducible builds\"?\nYes all systems support packages that are deterministic. \n\n*Does the system enforce \"reproducible builds\"?\nNope, though it does help diagnose problems, and works is being done to make packages reproducible -- bugs are being reported and handled anyway.\n\n*Is everything, without exception, reproducible?\nNot even close.\nNow let's define \"reproducible builds\"\n\nA build is reproducible if given the same source code, build environment and build instructions, any party can recreate bit-by-bit identical copies of all specified artifacts.\nThe relevant attributes of the build environment, the build instructions and the source code as well as the expected reproducible artifacts are defined by the authors or distributors. The artifacts of a build are the parts of the build results that are the desired primary output.\n\nNow let's talk about what is required\nCheck out this page under \"How\" which lays down three criteria\n\n\n*\n\n*the build system needs to be made entirely deterministic: transforming a given source must always create the same result. Typically, the current date and time must not be recorded and output always has to be written in the same order.\n\n*the set of tools used to perform the build and more generally the build environment should either be recorded or pre-defined.\n\n*users should be given a way to recreate a close enough build 3., perform the build process, and verify that the output matches the original build.\nYou can find more documentation about all of that here.\nAs to why Ubuntu isn't currently reproducible, things like Perl currently fail because -V stores the compiler args for convenience -- they're waiting on GCC to patch this upstream. A lot of this functionality could simply nuked. Some other problems: some man pages and programs have the build dates compiled in, others compile in mutable paths to shared libraries and the like.\nNot being reproducible isn't a problem or a vulnerability. It just makes it harder to verify that you haven't been tampered with, and currently that functionality is being viewed as more valuable.\nYou can follow Debian's progress towards determinism here\n\nA: For starters, I don't think Rutkowska was talking about building installation media deterministically, but about packages (deb, rpm).\nDebian is working on building packages reproducibly  (https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds) but there are still lots of packages that don't build that way...\nBuilding a whole distribution deterministically surely is even more of a challenge.\n", "Q: Can't boot into Linux Dual Boot.

Because everyone wants details on this site:\nI am ATTEMPTING to write a P2P powered, Linux OS (LFS). I am going to make it where users can message and walkie-talkie each other. Packages will also be distributed between users. My current thinking is to box executives up into virtual drives and run the executives from those mounted drives. Updates will also be distributed this way. This has nothing to do with Ubuntu, so the project shouldn't be discussed here.\nThat being said, the question itself has plenty to do with Ubuntu. It has to do with Linux. How many loopback devices can a system support at once? Is there a better way to support a higher number of mounted virtual drives? All I will need is read capabilities.\n\nA: The amount of loopbacks is a setting in modules.conf. It used to be /etc/modules.conf and before that /etc/conf.modules but looks like in 15.04 is is /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf. \nYou can add 64 loopbacks with\noptions loop max_loop=64 \n\nIt looks like 256 is a hard coded limit in loop.ko. From a redhat system:\n# modinfo loop\n...\nparm:           max_loop:Maximum number of loop devices (1-256) (int)\n\n\nIf all fails execute this from a root session: \nfor i in $(seq 0 255); do\n  mknod -m0660 /dev/loop$i b 7 $i\n  chown root.disk /dev/loop$i\ndone\n\nThat will attempt to create them.

If you want to manually view the logs, then open your file browser to the home directory, then press Ctrl+H to show hidden folders. You should now see a folder named .Skype. From there, navigate to .Skype/<username>/chatsync.

You can just unplug your windows hard drive and install it as your \"only\" operating system on the other drive. Follow any installation guide you want. \nWith both drives plugged in, you will be able to select which drive to boot from using the BIOS. It might also be possible to use GRUB, but with separate drives it would probably be more trouble than it's worth. Your BIOS should let you pick your default boot device in setup. When you want to boot your secondary boot device, most BIOSes will say something along the lines of \"Press F12 to select boot device.\"\n", "Q: No WiFi after upgrade to 15.04 After upgrading to 15.04, wifi doesn't enable an internet connection.

However, syslog shows that you connect with no obvious and therefore fixable issues, but immediately disconnects.\nFirst, check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it temporarily:\nsudo iw reg set IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Set it permanently:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit. Change the last line to read:\nREGDOMAIN=IS\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nNext, I'd set IPv6 to Ignore in Network Manager: http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Installation_Guide/images/netconfig/network-connections-ipv6-ignore.png  This example is for ethernet, but you want wireless.\n\nA: Detect and install additional Ubuntu driver with ubuntu-drivers package.\nOpen a terminal Ctrl+Alt+T and type following:\nsudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall\n\n\nA: just in case try to set off power management:\niwconfig wlan0 power off\n\n\nA: It is possible that you have a conflict with the old driver for the previous version not working.

How can I do this from the command line or with script?\n\nA: In the bash shell, you can remove a 'dot extension' (shortest trailing pattern matching a period followed by any number of characters) from a variable that contains a file name using parameter expansion e.g. if  f=00004.time then ${f%.*} evaluates to 00004.\nPutting that in a loop over a shell glob, \nfor f in *.time; do printf '%s\\n' \"${f%.*}\"; done\n\nThe order will be determined by the glob (*.time) expansion, and will be the default collation order for your locale - which should be numeric ascending for the input you show. To send the results to a file, use shell redirection\nfor f in *.time; do printf '%s\\n' \"${f%.*}\"; done > somefile\n\nIf you really want to remove the last 5 characters instead of the (more general) dot extension, you can modify that to\nfor f in *.time; do printf '%s\\n' \"${f%?????}\"; done > somefile\n\n\nA: In addition to steeldriver's answer, as the substring to be excluded is same for all files, you can use substitution operation of the bash's parameter expansion:\nfor file in *.time; do echo \"${file/.time/}\"; done | sort -n > file.txt\n\nThis will replace .time with empty string i.e. .time is excluded from the file names.\nThe syntax for substitution operation is \n${Parameter/OLD/NEW}\n\nThis will substitute only the first occurrence of OLD with NEW, if you want all occurrence of OLD to be replaced with NEW:\n${Parameter//OLD/NEW}\n\n\nA: So you just want numbers, and do not want .time part. My two cents here:\nls /path/to/*.time | cut -d '.' -f1  > toSomeFile.txt\n\n\nA: Do the same by combination of find and basename commands as follows:\nfind /path/to/dir -name '*.time' -exec basename {} .time \\; > someFile\n\nThe basename {} .time, strips the \".time\" suffix from fileNames.\nThe {} represent the current found fileName.\n", "Q: In Ubuntu 15.04, simply moving the mouse via touchpad scrolls the window When I first boot the system everything works fine. But then something happens (not sure what triggers it) and many programs start scrolling just by moving the mouse over the window. So far I see this happens in Nautilus, Document Reader, Archive Manager, Ubuntu Software Center, Meld, and System Monitor (what do they all have in common, GTK?). It does NOT happen in web browsers, thunderbird, programs using Mono, Java, etc, for some reason.\nTo be more specific of the issue: if the mouse starting position is over a document in Document Reader, for example, and then I move the mouse via touchpad, it'll scroll the document like an anchor, where the position of the mouse over the document doesn't change (yet it scrolls). I have already tried disabling \"two finger scroll\", \"disable while typing\", and the \"tap to click\" options, but they made no difference (after the glitchiness starts).\nThe other odd case is that in Nautilus, if the mouse starting position is over a file or directory, it sometimes selects it instead of scrolling. Single-clicking a directory will open the directory (so the initial touch acts like a clicks, and letting go acts as the second click).\nThe only thing I can do to temporarily fix the problem is restart the computer. There are no issues when using a mouse.\nUpdate 2015/05/03: I see how to reproduce it now. It appears to be a glitchy two-finger scroll issue. If you scroll any window with two fingers a lot, eventually it'll start causing this problem. Try various actions with two fingers, like \"clicking\" with two fingers, or scrolling in various directions quickly, etc, and it will start happening. It's interesting that it only happens in certain programs and not in others, which makes me wonder whether it is really a trackpad issue or some framework's issue. I can confirm that this is happening on the 15.04 Live CD, so this happens out of the box. If anyone has any clues, please update me!\nThe only work-around for this issue is to disable two-finger scroll (if it's already glitchy you'll need to restart). Not sure if it matters, but I'm using the Dell XPS 13 2015 9343.\nUpdate 2015/05/05: Apparently this bug can still happen even with two-finger scroll off, though it's more rare. Again, only certain programs have the issue, so it's hard to tell if it's a touchpad issue or something else.\nUpdate 2015/05/12: I have filed a bug report here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1454473\n\nA: Blacklisting the psmouse improves the situation but xchat gnome is still having issues. \nI followed instructions on https://github.com/mpalourdio/xps13\nCheck that your BIOS is version A03 or later, and touchpad firmware is up to date Touchpad firmware A00.\nblacklist psmouse driver so that the trackpad uses i2c instead. Make sure there is no PS/2 in the output of xinput -list.\nI noticed that xchat-gnome seems to be ignoring the touch-to-click setting and some other applications too (like VLC, but only the preference window).\nIn Xorg.log I see this error when the touchpad goes nuts:\n(EE) [dix] DLL0665:01 06CB:76AD UNKNOWN: unable to find touch point 0\n\nThe only way I have to solve temporarily the issue is to disable the trackpad completely from the Settings panel and enable it again.

Using the configuration that Stefano Maffulli suggested in the above comments seems to be working so far.  It was in the glitchy state when ran the command, so its possible just updating the synclient settings might have kicked it out of some bad mode.

What I wish to accomplish is create an output text file similar to the following for ls:\n$ ls > file.txt 2>&1\n\nMay I ask for someone to explain to me what is going on?\nFinally, the following produce results I cannot explain:\n$ $(ud) > file.txt\nLa commande « Ign » est introuvable, vouliez-vous dire :\n La commande « tgn » du paquet « tgn » (universe)\nIgn : commande introuvable\n\n$ echo $(ud) > file.txt\n\n\nA: Run the command in a subshell:\n(ud) > file.txt 2>&1\n\nThis will have the commands in the alias ud to run in a subshell and the STDOUT and STDERR of all the commands will be directed to the parent shell so that we can redirect the STDOUT and STDERR of all commands to the same file from our parent shell at once.\nOr as @steeldriver suggested you could also set the alias as following so that all the commands are grouped together and their STDOUT and STDERR will be redirected at once:\nalias ud='{ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y && sudo apt-get clean -y ;}'\n\nNow you can run the command as:\nud > file.txt 2>&1\n\nNow, lets get what you were doing wrong:\nYou have set the alias as:\nalias ud='sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y && sudo apt-get clean -y'\n\nNow as you run :\nud > file.txt 2>&1\n\nOnly the last successful or failed command's STDOUT and(or) STDERR gets redirected to file.txt, all previous commands run and depending on that command's exit code (success &&) the next command will run.

If another user has permissions to the directory, can they still see/modify/delete the file, even though they don't have permissions to the file itself?\n\nA: Bellow you can see me make a test folder and change the ownership of that folder to another user. I cannot create a file if the directory isn't owned by me. Similarly, as testuser, I couldn't remove a test file owned by my account.

There are no \"view\" permissions. As long as you can read a directory, you will be able to see all the files in it. Whether or not you can modify the file or read its contents will depend on whether you have execute permissions on the directory (needed to delete the file). In more detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have no read access to the directory, you can see the names of its contents but not their characteristics (permissions, owner, creation date etc.). This is because you need read access to, well, read that information:\n$ ls -l\ntotal 4\ndrw-rw-rw- 3 terdon terdon 4096 May  2 20:21 dir1\n$ ls -l dir1/\nls: cannot access dir1/subdir1: Permission denied\nls: cannot access dir1/file1: Permission denied\ntotal 0\n-????????? ? ? ? ?            ? file1\nd????????? ? ? ? ?            ? subdir1\n\n\n*If you don't have execute permission on the directory, you can't read its contents even if you have read access to the directory because listing its contents requires you to be able to open (\"execute\") the directory:\n$ ls -l \ntotal 4\nd-wx-wx-wx 3 terdon terdon 4096 May  2 20:21 dir1\n$ ls -l dir1/\nls: cannot open directory dir1/: Permission denied\n\n\n*If you don't have write access to the directory, you can see its files but can't delete/create them, even if you have read/write access to the file. This is because creating or removing a file from a directory involves modifying the directory itself (since you're modifying its contents) and you need write access for that:\n$ ls -l\ntotal 4\ndr-xr-xr-x 3 terdon terdon 4096 May  2 20:21 dir1\n$ ls -l dir1/\ntotal 4\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 terdon terdon    0 May  2 20:21 file1\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 terdon terdon 4096 May  2 20:19 subdir1\n$ rm dir1/file1 \nrm: cannot remove ‘dir1/file1’: Permission denied\n$ touch dir1/file2\ntouch: cannot touch ‘dir1/file2’: Permission denied\n\nThe first step is to have access to the directory the file resides in. As you saw above, having all rights to the file is not enough if you don't have the needed rights to the parent directory. Assuming you have full access to the directory, yes, the file can be seen irrespective of the file's permissions:\n$ ls -l dir1/\ntotal 0\n---------- 1 bob bob 0 May  4 15:45 file1\n$ cat dir1/file1 \ncat: dir1/file1: Permission denied\n$ echo \"foo\" > dir1/file1 \nbash: dir1/file1: Permission denied\n\nI have no rights whatsoever to the file above but can still see it. I can neither edit it, nor read it, but I can see that it exists. I can, however, delete it:\n$ rm dir1/file1 \nrm: remove write-protected regular empty file ‘dir1/file1’? y\n\nThis is because I have write access to the parent directory. I can therefore modify its contents, including any files there. If I were to remove the write access from the directory, then I wouldn't be able to delete the file, as explained above.\nSo, to hide a file from a user, you need to make sure that user has no read access to the file's parent directory. The permissions of the file itself are irrelevant. \n", "Q: My ubuntu 15.04 file system is not writable The problem started when my lightdm config got messed up and would only boot to a black screen with a cursor.

I ran into the same problem while using Unity.\nPPS: Audio from Audacity is also \"staticky\".\n\nA: It probably isn't the software that is making it 'staticky', it will most likely be a hardware problem. Specifically, it could  be either the microphone itself, or microphone input port on your computer.\nAlso, sometimes having the microphone volume too high can cause some form of static and feedback.\nTry using the microphone on another computer, and if the issue doesn't persist, you could try using a USB audio adapter for it, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sabrent USB External Stereo Sound Adapter for Windows and Mac\n\n*Griffin Technology iMic USB Audio Device\n..or something similar.\n", "Q: wireshark crashes when using flow graph feature ubuntu 14.04 Using the flow graph feature on wireshark Version 1.10.6 causes wireshark to crash.

TL;DR : what is the easiest way to create desktop shortcut to a program ?\nWhen I first started using GNOME with Ubuntu I immediately tried to find ways of creating desktop shortcuts/launchers to launch common programs.\nMy attempt to get desktop icons into GNOME lead me to pages like this one which describe several hacks to get desktop icons for common programs.\nI've found that these solutions are convoluted despite this being a common request.\nThere is already a question which attempts to ask the same thing, but it was closed, presumably because it wasn't particularly clear:\nWhy isnt there a create launcher on desktop right click?\n\nA: \n[W]hat is the intended way to quickly launch common programs in Ubuntu with GNOME?\n\nYou use the overview:\n\nTo reach the overview, you can do any one of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Super.\n\n*Press AltF1.\n\n*Move your mouse to the top-left corner.\n\n*Click on the Activities on the top corner.\n\n\nFrom here, simply type (part of) the name of the program, or something in its description, and press enter when it is highlighted:\n\nThe list of icons on the left is customizable. If you want to add an icon to it, for commonly-used applications, you can go to the Applications overview and drag an icon to it:\n\nOr right click an icon and Add to Favourites:\n\n\nTo get to the Applications overview, you can do any one of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the matrix of dots: \n\n\n*Press SuperA.\n\n\nIf you use an application often enough, it will get added to the Frequent section in the Applications overview.\n\nSo, the short answer is:\nYou don't use the desktop for launchers.\nIt might take some time getting used to this.\n\nCheck out:\n\n\n*\n\n*A tour of GNOME Shell\n\n*GNOME Shell cheat sheet\nThe only times the desktop is faster to reach than the overview are when you login or switch to a new workspace (in both cases the desktop is displayed by default). You can have the overview shown on startup.\n\nA: TL;DR : Linux calls it \"Create a link\", Windows calls it \"Create a Shortcut\". Same stuff, different wording. It's not hard, it's just how everything was designed. Windows' design is actually what's confusing users, because what it does is named different from what it shows in right click. And back to basics from this Wikipedia article\nIf you ever have tried opening windows partition with linux you will see that essentially, a windows desktop shortcut is nothing more than a link file. Now, just because windows days \"create a shortcut\" doesn't mean that unix-like file system has to call their way of doing think \"create a shortctu\",too.\nFor instance, bellow you will see a screenshot of my windows desktop opened with Ubuntu's default file manager - nautilus. Highlighted is a shortcut to Open Broadcaster Software , which is used to broadcast videos on sites like twitch.tv\n\nNow, unix-like systems have implemented creating links to files and folders long ago before windows existed. If you right click in Nautilus, you \nwill see a line saying \"Create a Link\". Same idea as windows shortcut ( which is actually a link, but windows calls it shortcut ) !\nNow, let's go to /usr/share/applications folder on Ubuntu. You will see there a list of all installed applications on your system. Now you can either copy one of those files to desktop and open with double click; alternatively, press AltF2 and run gksu nautilus /usr/share/applications, which opens file manager in that directory, right click and chose create link. Now you can move that link to desktop.\nBellow you can see my folder, with a link created to a solitaire game.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 OpenSSL Heartbleed I spun up a new Rackspace server with Ubuntu Server 15.04, choosing 15.04 believing that I was getting the latest and greatest software.

I first removed the application and then entered into the directory /etc/bash_completion.d and removed the directory as follows:\nsudo rm -rf sheepdog\nand restarted the terminal. It worked perfectly.\n\nA: There are various files that are read when you start a new shell (e.g. open a new terminal window). Which ones depend on the type of shell you are running, but the error could be caused by various files. The simplest way to check is to search all of them for the name of the script that is causing the error:\ngrep -H \"bash_completion_dog\" ~/.bashrc ~/.profile ~/.bash_profile ~/bash.login \\\n       ~/.bash_aliases /etc/bash.bashrc /etc/profile /etc/profile.d/*\\\n      /etc/environment 2>/dev/null\n\nThe command above will search for bash_completion_dog in all of the various files your shell might be reading. If that returns nothing, then the file in question is being called by something which is in turn being called by one of those files. Therefore, if the above returns nothing, edit your question to add that you tried this and we can take it from there. Also try searching through the files in /etc:\ngrep \"bash_completion_dog\" /etc/* 2>/dev/null\n\n", "Q: Can't connect to PPTP server on Ubuntu 14 I am trying to set up a PPTP server on an Ubuntu VPS hosted at Digital Ocean.

Download it, go to the download folder and open it. \nThe Ubuntu Software Center will show up and you'll be able to install the drivers, no terminal or complicated stuff to do :)\nBe sure to have enabled partner repositories. If you don't, go to Software & Updates -> Other Software tab and enable Canonical Partners and Canonical Partners (Source Code). \n\n\nA: If the .deb file doesn't work on your system, or you need a PPD for installing in a different manner than CUPS/LPR, Brother has some directions on their site that can be partially automated. https://help.brother-usa.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/164936/~/how-to-create-a-brother-ppd-file-for-installation---linux\nFirst you need to download the BR-Script driver (Postscript language emulation) for your printer model, this is actually under the Windows downloads, so change the operating system to \"Windows\" on the driver download page, and then click Show All under the Drivers section and then download the BR-Script file.\n\n*\n\n*Ironically the instructions that are ostensibly for Linux seem to be assuming you are running these steps on Windows.\n\nIf you are running on Linux you can use unzip, mscompress and the msexpand command provided by the latter to extract the .exe you downloaded (normally a self extracting zip if run on Windows) and then extract/expand the .pp_ file using msexpand yourprinter.pp_ and change the resulting file extension from .pp to .ppd and then you should be able to use it with the program that wants the PPD.\n", "Q: How to read systemd journal file on system that has no systemd?

Try\napt-get install --reinstall python3-requests\npip as any other application require certain libraries. In this case it requires requests lib to download files from net. If you check python3-pip package requirements ( apt-cache show python3-pip ) you will see all the required packages. After installation you can use pip to update those libraries as well as pip itself ( pip install --upgrade pip ).\nYou can try to update pip ( as above ) and requests or simply download pip directly from net:\nwget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py && python get-pip.py\nNOTE: if you have python3-requests installed and it still is not working, it means that you have either requests lib in too old version or something is wrong with your python path.

(See 2nd screenshoot below).\nVLC Screenshot\n\nTotem/Video Screenshot\n\n\nA: Okey, I did some research and managed to get menus back in VLC!  In summary you need to reset the preferences. You can try these commands in terminal:\nrm -r ~/.config/vlc\nrm -r ~/.cache/vlc\nvlc --reset-config\n\nThis is how it looks now!\n\n\nA: It seems that this is a bug/regression in 15.04 that is not fixed until now. I found a bug report at launchpad that describes my problem quiet well. \nIt seems that there is a problem with the unity appmenu that appeared in 15.04.\nEDIT: A possible workaround for VLC is to remove appmenu-qt from the system. You have to execute the following command in a terminal window:\nsudo apt-get remove appmenu-qt\n\nThis brings the menu of VLC back into the window (disabling the global menu for it). Now it's possible to select audio/track subtitle again!\nAnyway, thanks for your help!\n", "Q: Problem accessing old data on btrfs /home in ubuntu 14.04 I recently did a fresh installation of ubuntu 14.04 64 bit on my pc. Previously I was dual booting ubuntu 14.04 with windows(both 32 bit). My hdd is 500 GB. The previous structure of the hard disk was as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*partition 1:type-primary, size:100GB, file system:NTFS(windows)\n\n*partition 2:type-primary, size:100GB, file system:NTFS(data)\n\n*partition 3:type-primary, size:100GB, file system:NTFS(data)\n\n*partition 4:type-extended, size:(remaining), contents:following:-\n\n\n*\n\n*sub-partition 1: size:100GB, file system:NTFS(data)\n\n*sub-partition 2: size:1GB, file system:ext4(/boot)\n\n*sub-partition 3: size:50GB, file system:ext4(/)\n\n*sub-partition 4: size:16GB, file system:ext4(/home)\n\n*sub-partition 5: size:2GB, file system:swap\n\n\n\nNow first I copied data from partition 2 into partition 3. then after creating ubuntu 14.04 live usb on a 8GB pen drive, I deleted partition 1, 2 using Gparted in live session and created a new partition of size 106 GB. Then I copied partition 3 data (both backup of part. 2 and data of part. 3) into new 105GB partition (let's call it root_new) of type:primary and file-system:btrfs. then I copied sub-partition 1 data into root_new and old /home data in root_new. I put all these in separate directory to identify them later. Then I archived old /etc in root_new. After this total backup size was 48GB approx.\nThen I deleted partitions 3, 4 and created a new partition on remaining free space of type:primary and file-system:btrfs. let's call it home. Its size is approx. 370GB. Then I copied root_new backup data in home. Then I deleted root_new and created new partitions as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*partition 1:type-primary, size:1GB, file-system:btrfs(/boot)\n\n*partition 2:type-primary, size:100GB, file-system:btrfs(/)\n\n*partition 3:type-swap, size:remaining.\n\n\nThen I installed ubuntu in the partitions with configurations shown in new part.1, 2, 3 (with formatting) and using home as /home without formatting so that I could access backups on home after installation.\nUbuntu installed successfully.

In short, you need to change the value of GRUB_DEFAULT in the file /etc/default/grub. To know what value you should put in for GRUB_DEFAULT, you have to refer to the order of boot entries listed in the grub menu. This information comes from the file /boot/grub/grub.cfg. This basically involves counting the menuentries and matching it with the position of your old-kernal as listed in the grub menu.\n", "Q: Wifi stopped working after update to 15.04 I can still see the wifi networks that are available and attempt to connect to them but the connection doesn't work.

You might try downloading a newer emulator image, but I'm not sure if the 15.04 framework has made it onto them yet.\nThe --force-missing-framework option is meant for the install command running on the emulator, not your build command.  If you copy your click package over to the emulator, you may be able to install it with the command sudo click install --force-missing-framework --user=$USER *.click.  (I believe this method is deprecated in favor of using pkcon, but that doesn't seem to have this option.)\nBut before you go through any of this trouble, do you need the newest framework?

First I wasn't able to start Ubuntu, but after Bootrepair I was. Unfortunately I just changed the problem, since now I'm not able to boot Windows. The following link is of the Bootrepair report: http://paste.ubuntu.com/10971525/ .\nWindows 8 is not installed on the first hd and according to some that is a problem, see: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#DOS_002fWindows . It say's something about disk swapping. Should I try that or is there a different solution?\n\nA: Your Windows on sda, uses MBR(msdos) so Windows can only boot in CSM mode. CSM - UEFI Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which emulates a BIOS mode. And Ubuntu is on sdb in UEFI boot mode. UEFI & CSM are not compatible or you have to totally reboot to change from one system to the other and may have to change UEFI settings turning on UEFI or off CSM or vice versa. Better to have all systems in same boot mode. \nTo restore Windows boot in BIOS mode, you must install a Windows boot loader to the MBR of sda. Your Windows repair flash drive can do that or use Advanced mode in Boot-Repair. And then turn on CSM mode in UEFI to boot Windows.  \nYou can use Boot-Repair to convert Ubuntu 's install  from UEFI to BIOS, but be sure to only install grub to drive that is sdb not all drives like the default autofix in Boot-Repair. To boot in CSM mode you also must turn off secure boot in UEFI.\nYou do show grub installed to the MBR of sdb for BIOS boot, but fstab still shows mounting of efi partition for UEFI boot updates. So at some point you may have had BIOS boot on sdb?\n\nA: You can try to add a windows entry in grub. Open /etc/grub.d/40_custom file and add the following entry by substituting the details to suit your installation:\nmenuentry \"Windows 8\" {\n    set root='(hd0,gpt1)'\n    chainloader /EFI/microsoft/BOOT/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nThen run update-grub and hopefully you'll see an entry in grub.\n\nA: Thanks for your thorough responses. I'll try those tomorrow (hours of fiddling with Grub got the best of me). \nIn the mean-time I found a less ideal solution: in the CLI of GRUB I type: \nchainloader (hd0,1)+1\nboot\n\nThat were the commands to start Windows. It isn't as convenient as the normal way, but I settle for that at the moment. There must be a way to put those commands in the configuration file...

I recently bought an external monitor which I use in Portrait mode attached to my laptop.

To find out what that name of the input is, look at the first acronym that appears just before the list of numbers when you run xrandr.  In my case these were LVDS1 and VGA1 (the first is my laptop, the second my external monitor).\nIn case anyone is interested, here are the four commands that I used for the four items I added to a panel's launcher:\nxrandr --output VGA1 --auto --rotate left --left-of LVDS1 (This rotates my monitor in portrait mode, keeping it to the left of my laptop's monitor)\nxrandr --output VGA1 --auto --rotate normal --left-of LVDS1 (This rotates my external monitor horizontally, say because I want to watch a video. It also keeps it to the left of my monitor).\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --auto --right-of VGA1 (This turns on my laptop monitor, placing it to the right of my external monitor)\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --off (This turns off my laptop monitor)\n\nA: https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/arandr/ \n\nARandR is a visual front end for XRandR 1.2/1.3 (per display options), which provides full controll over positioning, saving and loading to/from shell scripts and easy integration with other applications.\n\nThis is a program that allows you to save scripts.

At first I thought the errors were related to my squid3 cache, but I have ruled that out as now it is affecting my email as well.\nWhat happens is that sometimes, when I am browsing the web or otherwise using the network (IPv4 only, IPv6 turned off, wired Ethernet connected to a LinkSys WiFi router connected to a cable modem), the system complains that it cannot find DNS info, or cannot connect to, a particular host. This is a very selective outage, because the rest of my connections will be fine in the meantime, and it is only temporary, because if I try again in a couple of minutes, I can successfully connect to the bad host.\nI attempted to Google this issue and found no related complaints, so I am wondering if I am unique, or this is something new to 15.04, or I am just going slightly crazy here.\n\nA: Since upgrading to Ubuntu 15.04 I have experienced similar problems of intermittent internet outages. I believe in my case this is an issue with the routing. The problem for me only happens when I am connected on the internet both through ethernet and through WiFi. The symptom is that I would occasionally lose internet connection for a few seconds. I clearly have a problem with the routing, as my WiFi connection shares priority with my ethernet connection for the addresses related to the DNS server. Check your DNS server address with:\ncat /etc/resolv.conf\n\nAnd your routing table with:\nroute -n\n\nThis issue seems related to a failure of network manager to set priority of ethernet over WiFi since the update to Ubuntu 15.04 and it is being described here:\n\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/1436330\n\nI have installed network-manager_0.9.10.0-4ubuntu16_amd64.deb libnm-util2_0.9.10.0-4ubuntu16_amd64.deb but I believe the issue is still not thoroughly fixed yet.\n\nA: I can confirm that I have exactly the same problem after upgrading to 15.04 on my wired connection.

Since this particular project seems to be using a PHP/nginx backend, Node is probably just being used for Javascript-based tools that build the frontend.\nNPM is used to manage third-party packages in the Javascript world. Running npm install with no additional arguments will try to find a package.json file in the directory the command is run from. It will read a list of dependencies from that file and install them in a folder called node_modules.\nMaybe a fix?\nFrom the output you pasted above, it looks like you're running npm install from your /var/log/nginx folder. Since that directory doesn't have a package.json file, npm is confused and doesn't know what to install.\nFrom those directions, the npm install -g gulp bower will do a global (the -g part) install of the gulp and bower tools.\nThe next step (npm install) is probably the one that's throwing you off. Somewhere you cloned git clone https://github.com/twostairs/paperwork.git. You'll need to cd into the paperwork directory and npm install from inside that folder.\n", "Q: I need speech recognition software for Ubuntu (like \"Dragon NaturallySpeaking 13 professional\" for Windows) I am disabled and use Dragon NaturallySpeaking version 13 professional in order to use my computer. \nIt does not play well under Wine and is the only thing stopping me from completely switching to Linux, which is a real shame, but unfortunately something that cannot be helped. \nCan anybody help me to make my Software run on Ubuntu or suggest me an equal alternative?\n\nA: My suggestion is you try native applications like Gnu/Linux.\nSimon Speech Recognition:\nSimon is highly configurable, targeted speech recognition software.

I bought a new SSD for my Lenovo Thinkpad W530 (I am not sure if hadware is relevant). I installed 15.04 on the new SSD in EFI-only mode with manual partitioning (/efi, / and /home partitions, bootloader installed to /efi).\nSo far, so good. I then tried to insert my old drive because I wanted to copy some files on an external drive and then a new ssd drive. To my dismay, it refused to boot. I had to install repair-boot which solved the problem. I then inserted my new SSD and it againd refused to boot. Again, repair-boot solved it. What is going on? Is something written to some circuits on the motherboard in the laptop?\n\nA: Pretty much. EFI-mode booting involves two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot loader files written to the EFI System Partition (ESP) on the hard disk.\n\n*Pointers to the ESP-based files stored in NVRAM on the motherboard.\n\n\nThe intent is that you can install as many boot loaders as you like and provide an order in which the computer should try them. Users should also be able to override that order using their computers' built-in boot manager. In principle, this should greatly simplify multi-boot configurations.\nUnfortunately, many computers delete NVRAM entries that point to devices that aren't available when the computer boots. Thus, when you swap disks, you can lose the ability to boot from them. IMHO, this is a design flaw in EFI.\nFortunately, there is a relatively easy workaround, but it requires some foresight to implement: In addition to the stored boot loader locations, a special one exists: EFI\\BOOT\\boot{arch}.efi, where {arch} is an architecture code -- normally x64 for x86-64 (AMD64) systems. This location is tried if no other boot entry works. It's normally used on removable media, but most EFIs will use it as a fallback for hard disks, too. Thus, if you copy GRUB or some other valid boot loader to EFI\\BOOT\\bootx64.efi on the ESP (normally /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi in Ubuntu), the disk will remain bootable even if the EFI boot entries are deleted. Note that you may need to copy boot loader configuration and support files, too.\nFWIW, Fedora's got a boot loader called fallback.efi that's designed to restore deleted NVRAM entries. I've not looked into it in depth, but putting it in the EFI\\BOOT\\bootx64.efi location should fix this problem, too. The last I heard, though, some (broken) EFIs cause this file to run on every boot, and the result is an ever-increasing number of boot entries. This bug may well have been fixed by now, but I've not checked up on it recently.\n", "Q: How to allow desktop to be used in Kubuntu 15.04 Hi guys I recently installed Kubuntu 15.04 and I cant for the life of me figure out to to unlock the desktop so that I can drag and drop files there.

Any advice would be great!\n(I tried to post a screen shot but my rep is too low)\n\nA: Documents\nKDE Userbase Plasma: https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma\nTo start\nRight click the desktop - unlock the widgets if they are locked\n\nLeft click the toolbox or right click the desktop - pick the Desktop Settings.\n\nChange the Wallpaper type to Folder View\n\n", "Q: Bluetooth not connecting to devices even though it recognizes them I'm runing 15.04 on a dell xps 13\nbluetooth recognises devices when i  try to add them but won't let me connect to them\nHere is the results from my terminal.\n~ $ uname -a; lspci -nnk | grep -iA2 net; lsusb; dmesg | grep -i bluetooth; dmesg | grep -i firmware; lsmod | grep bluetooth\n\nLinux aaron-XPS-13 3.19.0-15-generic #15-Ubuntu SMP Thu Apr 16 23:32:37 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n02:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM4352 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter [14e4:43b1] (rev 03)\n    Subsystem: Dell Device [1028:0019]\n    Kernel driver in use: wl\nBus 003 Device 002: ID 8087:8001 Intel Corp. \nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub\nBus 001 Device 003: ID 0bda:5682 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. \nBus 001 Device 002: ID 0a5c:216f Broadcom Corp. \nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\n[    8.164048] Bluetooth: Core ver 2.20\n[    8.164065] Bluetooth: HCI device and connection manager initialized\n[    8.164069] Bluetooth: HCI socket layer initialized\n[    8.164073] Bluetooth: L2CAP socket layer initialized\n[    8.164079] Bluetooth: SCO socket layer initialized\n[    8.353160] bluetooth hci0: Direct firmware load for brcm/BCM20702A0-0a5c-216f.hcd failed with error -2\n[    8.353166] Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: patch brcm/BCM20702A0-0a5c-216f.hcd not found\n[   20.289452] Bluetooth: BNEP (Ethernet Emulation) ver 1.3\n[   20.289455] Bluetooth: BNEP filters: protocol multicast\n[   20.289459] Bluetooth: BNEP socket layer initialized\n[   20.310897] Bluetooth: RFCOMM TTY layer initialized\n[   20.310907] Bluetooth: RFCOMM socket layer initialized\n[   20.310912] Bluetooth: RFCOMM ver 1.11\n[  886.399085] Bluetooth: hci0 urb ffff8800d8c15e40 failed to resubmit (2)\n[  895.471190] Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: patching hci_ver=06 hci_rev=1000 lmp_ver=06 lmp_subver=220e\n[  896.113983] Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: firmware hci_ver=06 hci_rev=1624 lmp_ver=06 lmp_subver=220e\n[    8.353160] bluetooth hci0: Direct firmware load for brcm/BCM20702A0-0a5c-216f.hcd failed with error -2\n[  896.113983] Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: firmware hci_ver=06 hci_rev=1624 lmp_ver=06 lmp_subver=220e\nbluetooth             491520  22 bnep,btusb,rfcomm\n~ $ \n\n\nA: For anyone wondering what the source of the files is in Jeremy31's answer, here's an alternative method.\nDownload the Windows driver from Microsoft to /tmp.\nhttp://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/ScopedViewRedirect.aspx?updateid=87a7756f-1451-45da-ba8a-55f8aa29dfee\nUnpack it using cabextract:\ncabextract 20662520_6c535fbfa9dca0d07ab069e8918896086e2af0a7.cab\n\nDownload and build hex2hcd:\ngit clone https://github.com/jessesung/hex2hcd.git\npushd hex2hcd\nmake\npopd\n\nMake the .hcd.\n./hex2hcd/hex2hcd BCM20702A1_001.002.014.1443.1572.hex BCM20702A0-0a5c-216f.hcd\n\nMove it to your firmware folder:\nsudo cp BCM20702A0-0a5c-216f.hcd /lib/firmware/brcm/\n\nAnd reload the module:\nsudo modprobe -r btusb\nsudo modprobe btusb\n\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://ftbeowulf.wordpress.com/2015/06/23/dell-xps-13-9343-developer-edition-bluetooth-firmware/\n\n*http://tech.sybreon.com/2015/03/15/xps13-9343-ubuntu-linux/\n\nA: wget \"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/r2pb41rhx65t9zi/BCM20702A0-0a5c-216f.hcd\"\nsudo cp BCM20702A0-0a5c-216f.hcd /lib/firmware/brcm/\nsudo modprobe -r btusb\nsudo modprobe btusb\n\nFor source of the hcd file see @Ian's answer\nSee if it works\nFor Ubuntu 15.10+ and 14.04 with kernels 4.2+ the second command should be\nsudo cp BCM20702A0-0a5c-216f.hcd /lib/firmware/brcm/BCM.hcd\n\n\nA: If you are using XPS 13 9350 (2016 edition), the previous answers won't work, because you need the newest driver.\nThe following should make your bluetooth work properly (tested on Debian Stretch with kernel 4.6.0-1-amd64):\n$ wget http://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER03272920M/1/9350_Network_Driver_XMJK7_WN32_12.0.1.720_A00.EXE\n$ 7z x 9350_Network_Driver_XMJK7_WN32_12.0.1.720_A00.EXE\n$ cp Win32/BCM4350C5_003.006.007.0095.1703.hex ./\n$ hex2hcd BCM4350C5_003.006.007.0095.1703.hex\n$ sudo mv BCM4350C5_003.006.007.0095.1703.hcd /lib/firmware/brcm/BCM-0a5c-6412.hcd\n\nThen restart your computer and enjoy!\nSource: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dell_XPS_13_(2015)#Bluetooth\n\nA: Probably not the most appreciated way, but it might be the most pragmatic. I.e. this worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download one of the windows VM's for testing MSIE. Run it in Virtualbox with the Extension pack enabled for USB 2.0 support. Before you start the VM, add yourself to the vboxusers group and login again.\n\n*After you logged in, add all USB devices to the VM. In my case I wasn't sure which device was the bluetooth adapter.\n\n*Download the drivers. In my case I entered my serial number on the Dell website and got the wireless drivers.\n\n*Install drivers.

I want the VM to provide a clean install and a clean uninstall respectfully so I don't want to leave data scattered around.\n\n*Is Virtual Box the best choice for Ubuntu or should I use something else?\n\n*Will Ubuntu have any issues after the creation of the virtual machine regarding its performance (when the VM is turned on and when it is turned off)? \nI know that these may seem ridiculous questions but I have used virtual machines before without ever thinking about any of these. Also when I searched for these questions nobody seems to care about those and as a result I couldn't find any source to even mention them.\n\nA: *\n\n*All of the memory will be dedicated to the virtual machine when it is started. (I recommend that you buy more RAM if you want to use this VM regularly though.)\n\n*It is enough to just press Delete. That will delete the virtual machine entirely from your system.\n\n*Oracle VM VirtualBox is easily the best choice for running Windows 8.1 in a virtual machine. Just make sure you install the VirtualBox Guest Additions after you get Windows installed.\n\n*Ubuntu will (obviously) run slower when the VM is running. However, Ubuntu will not be slower when the VM is not running, as VirtualBox nor Windows will be running.\n", "Q: Ubuntu will not boot without the CD I installed Ubuntu but it will not boot unless I have the CD in it.

You can easily check if your connection has an agent running and if so if it is filled with your ssh keys by typing the following on the commandline:\nssh-add -L\n\nAnother possibility could be the use of the predefined identity file as defined by the 'IdentityFile' parameter in your global ssh config file /etc/ssh/ssh_config or your local ssh config file ~/.ssh/config\nThe way to figure out which key it has been using is to use a more verbose ssh output:\nssh -vv user@host\n\n", "Q: Bluetooth audio device connected but not showing up in audio devices Ubuntu 15.04\nDell XPS-13\nI can connect my audio devices via Bluetooth, but I can not use them as they don't show up in sounds settings as an output option (or input option).\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: I tried to load the module first but I got a Failure: Module initialization failed so you have to unload the module first:\npactl unload-module module-bluetooth-discover\n\nand then load it again:\npactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover\n\nAfter that I was able to see the audio device in audio settings.\n\nA: I had the same issue here with Ubuntu Gnome 15.10 and 16.04.

The battery was shot and I had a spare so I decided to do a hot swap while it was running. I guess I forgot the power, pulled out the battery and it shuts down.

I currently own a system with Windows 7 and Ubuntu dual boot. I want to remove the entire dual boot system and install a single Ubuntu OS.\nCan I directly install Ubuntu via the flash drive without bothering about the dual boot partitions (I don't want the previous OS Windows 7 and Ubuntu partions)?\n\nA: Yes and it's very easy.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download an Ubuntu OS iso. Click me.\n\n*Create a bootable USB drive. Click for explanation from ubuntu.com. The documentation explains also how to create it from a Linux distribution. I'm sorry but I can't post that link, I don't have enough reputation.\n\n*Insert the USB drive and boot it. For this step, you can just restart and press the boot key for your motherboard (usually F8) and select the USB drive. Otherwise, enter the BIOS and then, in the Boot Menu, put the USB drive to the top.\n\n*The OS will boot and you can choose between \"Try Ubuntu\" or \"Install Ubuntu\". You can try it live if you want, but a direct installation is the best solution in most of the cases.\n\n*The only thing you need to change is the partition table. When asked, select \"Something Else\". Now you can edit your partitions. If you want to erase all other partitions, just select every partition and click the - symbol to delete it. \n\n\nWARNING: THIS WILL DELETE ALL THE FILES IN THE PARTITION. BE SURE TO HAVE A BACKUP OF YOUR IMPORTANT DATA.\n\n\n*Now you only have free space. Click the + symbol to add partitions. You'll need 3 partitions for a standard setup: a 20~30GB ext4 partiton with mount point set to /. A 2048MB (= 2GB) partiton as swap area. A xxGB (remaining space) ext4 partition with mount point set to /home.\n\n\nYou're done. Complete the installation and you have your Ubuntu OS with nothing more.\n\nA: All your data and files on Windows and Ubuntu and shared data partitions will be lost! Make a backup.\nIf you want to overwrite everything you can choose the corresponding option in the installation menu or partition manually.\nTip: You should think about whether you want to change from msdos to gpt partition table using gparted in the live distribution before you install. It makes sense to think about it is you make such a drastic change.\n", "Q: How to install Stack Applet on 15.04 I have download stackapplet from here and PPA from from Here. \nI can't follow after this what to do.  \nI have refered this question but can't follow. \n\nA: After installation, confirm that you have installed by using:\ndpkg -s stackapplet | grep Version\n\nIf you get a result you should be able to run the application directly from the dash.\nNOTE that you have also to install the python-appindicator package.\nsudo apt-get install python-appindicator\n\n", "Q: error while cron scheduling a sh script This is my shell script which i want to schedule using cron job.\nparser.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsource .profile\nworkon venv\ncd /home/ashish/deployments/myproject\n\nexport DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=myproject.settings_production\npython /home/ashish/deployments/myproject/myproject/manage.py parse_data\n\nCron job-\n*/15 * * * * . /home/ashish/parser.sh\n\nWhenever this cron job runs i receive a mail with errors:\n/bin/sh: 6: /home/ashish/parser.sh: source: not found\n/bin/sh: 7: /home/ashish/parser.sh: workon: not found\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/ashish/deployments/myproject/myproject/manage.py\", line 8, in <module>\n    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line\nImportError: No module named django.core.management\n\nWhen i run this script from terminal -\n. parser.sh    #this gives no error\n\nsh parser.sh   #this gives errors\n/bin/sh: 6: /home/ashish/parser.sh: source: not found\n/bin/sh: 7: /home/ashish/parser.sh: workon: not found\n\nWhat can be the possible error in this script ?\n\nA: */15 * * * * . /home/ashish/parser.sh\n\ncron uses sh, not bash, so when you source the script (that's what the . does), it is run under sh, not bash.

Thanks.\n\nA: This is a matter of resource usage that generates the heat.  As alluded to in comments, PhpStorm takes a lot of resources and CPU usage.  This in turn means your CPU needs to run and generate heat (as a byproduct) to process the requirements.  This is a side effect of resource-intense programs, and unfortunately there's no good solutions to this problem.  (Windows is plagued by the same problem too)\nShort of manually throttling your CPU power (which would impact overall performance of the system and maybe make PhpStorm not work), there's no real way to overcome this issue.\n", "Q: 14.04 LTS on a Dell XPS 2015 only boots with nomodeset as the title says, I'm running 14.04 on a Dell XPS 2015 with Intel Broadwell Graphics.

Make sure the very first line of the script reads:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nor\n#!/bin/bash\n\nOn a side note, you should avoid putting .sh extension on a bash script, since bash is not sh. Preferably use no extension at all.\n\nA: This sounds like a known, existing bug: lubuntu-default-settings does not specify the proper command to execute in terminal\nThat bug report suggests the following workaround (using X-terminal instead.)\n\nWORKAROUND:\nIn pcmanfm preferences, under the advanced tab, change the terminal to \"x-terminal-emulator -e %s\". You can also change the \"terminal\" value in ~/.config/libfm/libfm.conf.\n\nAn alternative workaround I've used before is creating a desktop shortcut - but then you're limited to only being able to double-click on the desktop.\nTo create a shortcut, you can run the command:\nlxshortcut -o ~/Desktop/test.sh\n(Where test.sh is the name you want the file to have on the desktop.)\nThis will open lxshortcut, which will create a .desktop file from your responses in a GUI.\nManually creating a .desktop file should also work.\n", "Q: \"Failed to build vmnet\" for kernel 3.19 Because this answer is only for kernel 3.13, so I'd like to share a solution for the problem Failed to build vmnet for kernel 3.19 and earlier versions.

Just find their specifications page and the information is right there.\nSimilarly AMD do the same for their graphics processors, so if you are looking at a Radeon based graphics card then again just completely ignore the reseller and go straight to AMD and find their specifications sheet.\nPicking one at random again the Radeon HD 6970 has, hidden near the bottom of their specifications page (in amongst a huge wodge of information you'll not care about) shows:\nDisplayPort 1.2\n    Max resolution: 2560x1600 per display\n    Multi-Stream Transport\n    21.6 Gbps bandwidth\n    High bit-rate audio\nHDMI 1.4a with Stereoscopic 3D Frame Packing Format, Deep Color, xvYCC wide gamut support, and high bit-rate audio\n    Max resolution: 1920x1200\nDual-link DVI with HDCP\n    Max resolution: 2560x1600\nVGA\n    Max resolution: 2048x1536\n\nSo basically just ignore the reseller, as they'll just be throwing impressive sounding numbers at you in a bid to get you to buy their products, while the actual chip makers will tell you what it can actually do.\nBasically just search either the Nvidia or AMD sites for whatever graphics processor you are looking at and you should, somewhere on the specifications page, find the information you are after.\n\n", "Q: Bluetooth not working after upgrade to 15.04 After upgrading from 14.04 to 15.04, my Bluetooth is not working anymore.

It happens on, or about, the time of login.\nI watched this traffic with iftop from a router computer.\nTwo part question:\n\n*\n\n*What is that traffic, and what is it for. Is it phoning home? Handing out information? Latest software check?\n\n\n*Regardless of why its there, how do I stop/disable/un-install/break/prevent, that from happening?\nThere is no reason why the computer should be connecting to the Internet behind the scenes unsolicited.\n\nUPDATE:\nI have made sure all the privacy setting in Ubuntu have on-line searches off. I have used both the privacy settings and tweak tools to do this.\nI have tracked down the sites in which the computer reached out and in the process, found out that the Ubuntu does it also when you shut down (not just start up).\nThe computer reached out to barbadine.canonical.com, mulberry.canonical.com, golem.canonical.com and juniperberry.canonical.com.\nThis is exactly what I want stop, regardless of the purposes or reason for the traffic. None of the setting toggle options I have come across, seem to stop this. It seems to be hardwired phone-home type stuff perhaps. Short of blocking it with an external firewall, I am at a loss as to how to stop it.\n\nA: GOT IT!\nOr at least, for now, I think I have the answer (thanks to the Q&A and research noted below). I now have a computer that does not reach out to the Internet  until I ask it to do so (we will see how periodic auto updates do [which I am ok with])... ahh finally the soothing tranquil sound of an Internet quiet machine at boot/start and shut down (still talks to router, broadcasts ect. Ok with that)\nThe following is what I did. I will explain it as best I can, and will not get into the merits of why one should, or should not do this. I don’t want to get into it with anyone regarding what traffic they are OK with  their computer doing behind the scenes. This post is not intended to be a “freak out” session or imply that Canonical's phones-to-home and NTP checks are evil, sinister or anything of the sort. I asked these questions for a specific reason and I thank all of you who responded with tips, suggestions, and information. I found most of it very helpful and learned from some of it (popcon.ubuntu.com - gone; another bites the dust). \nThe Solution (so far, at least)\nFiguring that some of the traffic was clock related and  usage related, I continued researching the subject and came up with the websites referenced below (credit where credit is due). I believe the culprit here is a program called Zeitgeist. It sits around on your computer and monitors the user. It, along with some nasty co-conspirators called GeoClue and geoip, feverishly work to compile info about the user. The bandits collect, statistic-izes, package, and ship off what your doing to Canonical (oh, ...and they keep your time right, in case you're warping through a wormhole). Then (not before), I believe, Canonical makes the data anonymous and stores it for their usage needs (debug, develop, commercial, or otherwise). Either way it's got to go. \nSo: \nsudo apt-get remove zeitgeist zeitgeist-core zeitgeist-datahub python-zeitgeist \\\n  rhythmbox-plugin-zeitgeist geoclue geoclue-ubuntu-geoip geoip-database\n\nrunning that ultimately removed:\nactivity-log-manager activity-log-manager-control-center geoclue\ngeoclue-ubuntu-geoip geoip-database libunity-webapps0 python-zeitgeist\nrhythmbox-plugin-zeitgeist unity-webapps-common unity-webapps-service\nxul-ext-unity xul-ext-websites-integration zeitgeist zeitgeist-core\nzeitgeist-datahub\n\nA bunch of stuff I could live without. In an anticipation that it would “break” unity, I put on “flashback” and Gnome Shell for a few other options. But as it turns out to my surprise, Unity still works! No errors. Time is looking good, Dash works (minus the bloated web searches/live searches/lense searches as desired) I have not (yet) be forced off unity.\nthen:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/ntpdate\n\nand on the first line; \nexit 0\n\nput an end to NTPD requests (juniperberry, golem, ect)\nThe referenced sites below talk about possibly removing Whoopsie too, but I kept that in for now, since you usually invoke the transmission at the time of the problem. (emphasis … for now.)\nSo there you go! Now a nice quiet start to my computer in the network neighborhood! Thanks again for all your comments and help guys. I will keep an eye on this, and if the problem returns, perhaps you'll be hearing from me. Good luck if you try this.\nREFERENCES:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2000108\nand \nStrange connections by gvfsd-http --spawner\n\nA: You can use wireshark to sniff network traffic and analyze all exchanges made by your ubuntu box. Here is my results made by installing Ubuntu 14.04 in virtualbox (for easier traffic sniffing):\nOn boot:\n\n\n*\n\n*DHCP Request, Offer, ACK\n\n*various MDNS query/response to 224.0.0.251\n\n*DNS query for ntp.ubuntu.com then NTP traffic to ntp.ubuntu.com\n\n*DNS query for daisy.ubuntu.com\n\n*DNS query for changelogs.ubuntu.com and some HTTP data, only once\n\n\nSo there is nothing unusual here. You can have all the explanation about this automatic connections alongside ways to prevent them, here.\nMy only recommendation is not to disable NTP request but either use your router if it has a NTP server  or use public NTP server like the one from ntp.org. You need to change the variable NTPSERVERS in /etc/default/ntpdate file.\nYou can even block MDNS with your firewall if you really want to and know what you are doing.\n\nA: Go to system settings and there should be security and privacy option.\nTap on it and turn the privacy mode on. should solve your querys\nfor your first answer yes its does send information to canonical but if you turn the privacy on that should do the trick no more sending data\nThey mostly do it for seeing what type of software you use.\n\nA: Leaving the Linux kernel aside and concentrating on the Canonical side , answering to your questions in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your clean, fresh install of Ubuntu is indeed \"phoning home\" to Canonical (the company behind Ubuntu) to multiple servers (E.g. canonical.com, ubuntu.com, ...) for a variety of reasons without user interaction on start-up and on shut down to accomplish the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Time server updates\n\n*Software updates\n\n*Crash reports\n\n*...\n\n\nAdditionally, with user interaction, it is also \"phoning home\" for software installation purposes (the software centre), on-line searches (which you've disabled), ...\nWhy and what is going on?\nAs this is all open source, you can verify for yourself on http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ or, for specific packages, by downloading the source code and seeing for yourself what is going on exactly, but answering this in detail would require a bit more text then is appropriate for a Q&A site.\nNote that Canonical is only collecting anonymous data to guide their packaging and development efforts (Canonical is more a packager then a developer), so Ubuntu is not \"phoning home\" in the malicious sense of the word as Canonical went through great lengths to ask your permission prior to sending personally identifiable information (E.g. it will ask you, the user if your system is allowed to send your network config with MAC addresses or your fstab with blkids when a crash occurs and Canonical needs the information for filing bug reports)\n\n*There are various ways of stopping this, but the easiest way of doing so would be to add canonical.com and ubuntu.com to your local hosts file and pointing it to the local loop adapter.\nWould I do this?\nNo!  Ubuntu is the most common variety of Linux out there and a ton of security researchers and buffs use it as their primary OS and any malicious connections would be ousted within a few minutes of Canonical deploying it for the entire planet to see and gladly used by some large company in Redmond, WA as propaganda to use their proprietary OS... \n", "Q: Virtual Box Resolution Stuck at 640 x 480 I am running Windows 8, and Ubuntu 14.04.2.

I'm having a problem regarding the cloning of my disk; Clonezilla requires as much free space as the size of my original drive. So, I decided to re-install Ubuntu manually following the instructions here. In fact, I ended up with the setup here and here.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does the overall process look like ok to you? Should I do anything in\naddition / different?\n\n*I feel like I ended up encrypting only the home folder, however, I would like to have every single partition encrypted. What do you think?\n\n*Which of the partitions should I clone afterwards? Is it enough to clone the sda5 (/) partition?\n\n*And finally, how to restore the corrupted / faulty partition later on?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Your partitions look ok.\n\n\n*If you want to enable full disk encryption after installation, most probably you will have to reinstall ubuntu. There is a good reference on different options you have for disk encryption here. There are also tools like Cryptkeeper, DM-Crypt, and LUKS which you could try. And yes, this method works well and is comparatively easier to do.\nIn addition if you want to clone your encrypted drives to smaller drivers have a look at ResizeEncryptedPartitions docs from ubuntu. there are some resources here in Ask Ubuntu as well. Do go through them before making a final call.\n\n\n*That depends on what all things you want to backup.\n\n\n*Depends on the extend of damage to the partition. Sometime it will be as easy as booting in live USB/CD and automatically fix the partition. But in more serious damages it might be even impossible to recover data.\n\nA: \nDoes the overall process look like ok to you? Should I do anything in\n  addition / different?\n\nIn a single word. Yes, your partitions are just Ok and more.\nPutting /var on a separate partition prevents a misbehaving applications like  database server, and other log files in /var/log from consuming   the space of your disk.\nPutting /tmp on a separate partition prevent some tmp files from some apps from consuming the disk space.\nPutting /boot on a separate partition was needed in some old times  when machines had trouble addressing large hard drives, but this is not needed anymore. So you can get rid of this partition.\nPutting /home on a separate partition can save your data, configurations ,etc.. specially if you install a new Ubuntu version. Moreover, it becomes more easy to resize your /home if you need some space. Plus it would save your data  when  you have some booting problems.\nAnd of course you need the / partition.\n\nI feel like I ended up encrypting only the home folder, however, I\n  would like to have every single partition encrypted. What do you\n  think?\n\nI'm afraid to say that you can't do a full disk encryption after you finish Installation. But anyway you still has the ability to obtain a disk encryption using many applications such cryptsetup,...\n\nWhich of the partitions should I clone afterwards? Is it enough to\n  clone the sda5 (/) partition?\n\nNow, for cloning purpose, indeed it's up to you. But you should specify your needs.\nIf you want to clone the full HDD then you have to clone the all partitions. If you just need your user data then you can install anyother version of Ubuntu and clone the /home. So this is related to what do you want to do in real.\n\nAnd finally, how to restore the corrupted / faulty partition later on?\n\nAlso this is directly  related to what is the fault. Those problems raise from file system errors which can be solved using fsck commands, and may extend to the need of installing a new Version. So to solve the problem you have first idetifying the problem, But in simple words, The paritioning module you use will help you much in being flexible for solving system errors.\n", "Q: default location of postgresql when installing through apt-get When you install postgresql on 14.04, it sticks the main server program postgres at:\n/usr/lib/postgresql/9.3/bin/postgres\n\nthe data directory where all the database clusters will be stored at:\n/var/lib/postgresql/9.3/main\n\nand the configuration file at:\n/etc/postgresql/9.3/main/postgresql.conf\n\nNow I can understand why postgresql.conf and other configuration files are stored in /etc/postgresql/9.3/main. After all, /etc is where configuration files are stored in a linux system.\nHowever, why place the database storage area in /var/lib? I can understand /var, since that is the place for nonstatic data and databases are nonstatic. But why /var/lib in particular?\nFurther, I believe that /bin is for programs required for boot. /usr/bin is for programs included in the distribution. and /usr/local/bin should be for programs not included in the distribution but available for system-wide use. And thus since postgresql is intended for system-wide use, it should be available in /usr/local/bin. Yet, they place it in /usr/lib, which I have no idea why.\nWhy do I ask this question? Because without order and structure, it is difficult to remember the location of programs you use everyday.\n\nA: In the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, `/var/lib/ is stated as (in italic the most important part): \n\n5.8.1 Purpose\nThis hierarchy holds state information pertaining to an application or\n  the system. State information is data that programs modify while they\n  run, and that pertains to one specific host. Users must never need to\n  modify files in /var/lib to configure a package's operation.\nState information is generally used to preserve the condition of an\n  application (or a group of inter-related applications) between\n  invocations and between different instances of the same application.\n  State information should generally remain valid after a reboot, should\n  not be logging output, and should not be spooled data.\nAn application (or a group of inter-related applications) must use a\n  subdirectory of /var/lib for its data. There is one\n  required subdirectory, /var/lib/misc, which is intended for state\n  files that don't need a subdirectory; the other subdirectories should\n  only be present if the application in question is included in the\n  distribution.\n/var/lib/ is the location that must be used for all distribution\n  packaging support. Different distributions may use different names, of\n  course.\n\nIn short: /var/lib/ is for data that is used locally.\nSo it makes perfect sense to put a database's data into /var/lib/{mysql|postgress}/ directory but... the FHS is a standard created mostly for use by distributions. As a user you are free to put your data wherever you want and it is mostly a matter of opinion.\n\nYou are misunderstanding the word \"local\". /usr/local/bin/ is not for system software but for your own software (basically anything with \"local\" in must never be touched by the system. As explained by FHS:  \n/usr/local/\n\n4.9.1 Purpose\nThe /usr/local hierarchy is for use by the system administrator when\n  installing software locally. It needs to be safe from being\n  overwritten when the system software is updated. It may be used for\n  programs and data that are shareable amongst a group of hosts, but not\n  found in /usr. Locally installed software must be placed within\n  /usr/local rather than /usr unless it is being installed to replace or\n  upgrade software in /usr.\n\nAn executable installed from system software should never go to anything local. \n\nNow for /usr/lib/. \n\n4.7.1 Purpose\n/usr/lib includes object files, libraries, and internal binaries that\n  are not intended to be executed directly by users or shell\n  scripts. Applications may use a single subdirectory under\n  /usr/lib. If an application uses a subdirectory, all\n  architecture-dependent data exclusively used by the application must\n  be placed within that subdirectory.\n\npostgressql is probably a daemon started at boot? If so it makes sense to put it here. You are not suppose to use the command yourself but start a service. The files in /usr/lib/ tend to have their own user and group and/or a daemon that restricts access to /var/lib (only mysqld can access /var/lib/mysql/ for instance; this will be the same for postgressql) \n", "Q: How to Remove the bootloader and automativally start ubuntu 14.04 Currently I am using Ubuntu alongside Windows 7.I have decided to get rid of windows and gain some extra disk space.That's easy.

Laptop support in Ubuntu is rather disappointing. It's like Ubuntu and Kubuntu are two different worlds. Is there a script to disable touchpad while running full screen applications? I tried to write it myself but no success at the end. My guess is to combine xdotool with xinput. \nAny different approach as well as suggestions of similar scripts are much welcomed.\nAnd no, I'm not interested in setting shortcuts! Script should automatically disable touchpad when full screen application is active.\n\nA: After some research I have managed to write a functional script. It will automatically disable touchpad while full screen application is active and mouse is connected. So it is suitable for full screen gameing.\nWhat you need to do is copy the text into Gedit and save file as e. g. : .auto_disable_touchpad.sh (Since it got . in front of name it is hidden file, but you can name it whatever you want.). Then: right click/properties/permissions/allow executing file as program. To add it to startup open Startup applications and add the folowing command your/script/folder/.auto_disable_touchpad.sh . \n#!/bin/bash\n\nSC1=$(xdpyinfo | grep dimensions)\nSC2=\"${SC1#*dimensions: }\"\nSC3=\"${SC2%% pixels*}\"\n\nwhile :\ndo\n    TP=$(xinput list --name-only | grep -i Touchpad)\n    TPS1=$(xinput --list-props \"$TP\" | grep -i \"device enabled\")\n    TPS2=\"${TPS1#*:}\"\n\n    MO=$(xinput list --name-only | grep -i mouse)\n\nif [ ! -z \"$MO\" ];then\n    WN1=$(xdotool getactivewindow getwindowgeometry)\n    WN2=\"${WN1#*Geometry: }\"\n\n    WNN=$(xdotool getactivewindow getwindowname)\n\n    case ${WNN,,} in\n        desktop|*vlc*|*smplayer*|*mozilla*firefox*) WNN=1;;\n        *) WNN=0;;\n    esac\n\n        if [ $SC3 == $WN2 ] && [ $WNN == 0 ]; then\n                xinput -disable \"$TP\"\n        elif [ $TPS2 == 0 ]; then\n                xinput -enable \"$TP\"\n        fi\nelse sleep 2\nfi  \nsleep 1\ndone\n\nIf you are watching films or full screen youtube video it will also disable touchpad while the mouse is present. So, you might want to add exceptions. I have already added some for: desktop, firefox (plugin-container), VLC and SMPlayer.\nWhen you want touchpad active while full screen application running then add name of the application to this line:\ndesktop|*vlc*|*smplayer*|*mozilla*firefox*) WNN=1;;\nE.G. to add Ubuntu's default video player Videos to  exceptions add |*videos* before\n) WNN=1;; so it will look like this:\ndesktop|*vlc*|*smplayer*|*mozilla*firefox*|*videos*) WNN=1;;\nNote that name of the application is case sensitive so you must use lowercases only (smplayer but not SMPlayer).\n", "Q: Will it be possible to use ReactJS Native for Ubuntu Touch development? Facebook are developing React Native for iOS and Android development. This seems to be a game-changer for mobile app development. \nI guess Facebook won't expend resources to develop a React Native bridge for Ubuntu Touch, at least not while Ubuntu Phone market penetration is neglible compared to Android and iOS.\nUbuntu SDK supports QML and HTML5, which are both similar to React Native, in some ways. Nevertheless, React Native looks tremendously exciting for mobile app development, and will be opensourced by Facebook. Moreover, Facebook have announced Nuclide.io, and Atom-based IDE for React Native and web development.\nIs Canonical considering integrating React Native for Ubuntu Touch development? \n\nA: Maybe yes, it seems that they are working on it.\nthe source code:\nhttps://github.com/CanonicalLtd/react-native\nthe blog entry:\nhttps://developer.ubuntu.com/en/blog/2016/08/05/introducing-react-native-ubuntu/\n", "Q: Ubuntu boot menu showing up instead of Windows I'm totally a newbie to Ubuntu, disk partitioning and stuffs.\nI had installed and un-installed Ubuntu(14.04 LTS) in an atypical way several times and screwed up my disk partitions. But when I thought I wouldn't face much issues, it all started when I installed it again.\nStraight to the point:\nBefore, I used to see Windows boot menu where I could select Windows or Ubuntu. But now, I get directly sent to Ubuntu GRUB boot menu and Windows will be listed at the bottom and if I don't select Windows within 10 seconds, I'll be logged in to Ubuntu without my consent (as it automatically does after 10 seconds).\nBut when I select Windows from GRUB, only then I can see the Windows boot loader again, with Ubuntu listed as the second OS.\nI need my Windows boot loader back!\nOr atleast I need Windows option at the top so that I could hit that as soon as it loads up or when 10 seconds hits.\nHow to fix this? I tried googling this issue before posting this issue here and tried many commands through Ubuntu but didn't resolve the issue.\nI've even tried EasyBCD but it only helps for Windows boot loader, not on GRUB.\n\nA: *\n\n*You can use Boot-Repair tool to set default OS in GRUB. Under advanced menu you can set OS to boot by default and for how long GRUB will be shown.\n\n\n\n\nOf course,be careful when using this tool.\n\n\n*This probably happens because your partitions aren't mounted at startup, or at least not by same order.\n\n", "Q: PHP/Apache runs as which user on Ubuntu Server I have a PHP script (in /var/www) that is supposed to write down the logs of operation in a file deploy.log (also in /var/www) and perform operations on a file situated in other directories of the system (Like /home/<user>/repo/my-repo.git and /srv/pr). However, it is not doing so currently. When I change the permission of my log file to 777, the PHP is able to write it to that file. For obvious reasons, I'm unable to keep the permissions at 777.\nI read somewhere that the files you wish to operate on should have the same permissions as the user that runs the PHP files.

And I have read this guide here: Ubuntu BIOS Upgrade\nAnd I know that this is the download for my BIOS upgrade: Lenovo B590 BIOS upgrade H9ET84WW\nBut the problem is, even though I have read the instructions in the first link, I am still unsure about how to upgrade my BIOS if I have this .exe file designed for Windows systems only. And I see that as my BIOS version is older than H9ET75WW that I first need to upgrade to that version, before upgrading it to the latest, and a .zip file is provided to do that, but I am also unsure about how to boot of the .zip file and what to do with it.\nSo I was wondering if anybody could advise me on this BIOS upgrade as I have never done this on Ubuntu before?\nInformation Update:\nI recently checked in my BIOS settings, and it is apparently allowing both UEFI and Legacy mode.

I will call this the \"flavor\".\nxx and y.yy signify the version.  We're only concerned with the UEFI BIOS Version, not the Embedded Controller Version.\nMine looks like this, I have the \"H5\" flavor and will need to install the files that begin with \"H5\":\nUEFI BIOS Version                H5ET69WW (1.12 )\nUEFI BIOS Date (Year-Month-Day)  2012-11-15\nEmbedded Controller Version      H5EC31WW(1.11)\n\nUnderstanding versions and available files\nCurrently these three versions are available:\n\n\n*\n\n*h9et75ww.zip\n\n*h9et84ww.exe h9et84ww.txt\n\n*h9et92ww.exe h9et92ww.txt\nEven though the filenames indicate the \"H9\" flavor, the first two also contain BIOS updates for the \"H1\" and \"H5\" flavors.  h9et75ww.zip contains these versions:\n\n\n*\n\n*H1ET80WW\n\n*H5ET80WW(1.19) 2013-09-09, EC: H5EC33WW(1.13)\n\n*H9ET75WW\n\n\nWhen run, h9et84ww.exe extracts its contents to a directory, which contains these versions:\n\n\n*\n\n*H1ET85WW\n\n*H5ET85WW(1.23) 2014-04-15, EC: H5EC34WW(1.14)\n\n*H9ET84WW\n\n\nBased on the file size, I believe h9et92ww.exe only contains H9ET92WW for the \"H9\" flavor.\nNote that the two digits before 'WW' are different for the \"H9\" flavor as compared to the others.  I've provided the version, date, and embedded controller version for the \"H5\" flavor after upgrading.  h9et84ww.txt contains lots of conflicting information about versions and dates, and should not be trusted.\nIt is not clear whether the instructions to upgrade to H9ET75WW before upgrading to H9ET84WW or H9ET92WW only apply to the \"H9\" flavor, or all flavors.

This is worth a try before you re-import your entire collection. \n\nA: Had the same problem with Ubuntu 16.04. First installed clementine instead of rythmbox. Worked fine. Later I opened an .ogg soundfile with rythmbox and immedeatly after that, rythmbox started to import all .mp3 files. Now I have both players that work. Maybe it helps for someone.\n\nA: I had a similar problem of no music imported or playable which began when Rhythmbox tried to import my music before the mp3 codecs were loaded. Having subsequently loaded the correct codecs, my solution was to close Rhythmbox, then open the Files browser, selecting Show Hidden Files from the View drop down, then clicking through the folders .local, share, rhythmbox,then right-clicking on the rhythmdb.xml database file and selecting rename to rhythmdb.bakxml and then restarting Rhythmbox which immediately began importing all the files from my default music folder. Rhythmbox created a brand new rhythmdb.xml file on its own and now all my mp3 files have been imported to the library and are playable.\n", "Q: .nano_history permissions error I use rkhunter and I was wanting to check its logs with:\nnano /var/log/rkhunter.log\n\nBut nano outputted this error:\nError reading /home/arthur-dent/.nano_history: Permission denied\n\nPress Enter to continue starting nano.\n\nAnd if I press ENTER I am able to view the file. I have checked the permissions for that file and they are now:\n-rw-------   1 root        root           12 May  3 20:26 .nano_history\n\nSo I guess that I just change ownership back to me? But as I was literally just using nano, why would the permissions and ownership (possibly, as I do not know what the original ownership was) just suddenly change? Was it because I was just using it with sudo, if so, it is odd as nothing like this has ever happend before and I use sudo with it a lot?\n\nOS Information:\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.04\nRelease:    15.04\n\nPackage Information:\nnano:\n  Installed: 2.2.6-3\n  Candidate: 2.2.6-3\n  Version table:\n *** 2.2.6-3 0\n        500 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\n\nA: This can happen when you don't own the .nano_history file that's normally contained inside your home directory. This happened to me when I ran nano for the first time on my Ubuntu install along with sudo. This meant that .nano_history was owned by root and not readable unless sudo was used with nano each time. When it wasn't used, nano complained on startup with 'Permission denied'. Copy and paste this exactly into your terminal to fix the issue:\nsudo chown $USER:$(id -gn) $HOME/.nano_history\n\n\nA: This is possible if .nano_history does not exist and you edit any file as root. Start a search action with Ctrl+W and .nano_history has the wrong ownership.\nsudo chown arthur-dent:arthur-dent /home/arthur-dent/.nano_history\n\nLater, the ownership of the file will not be changed.\nI've tested:\n% ls -l .nano_history\nls: cannot access .nano_history: No such file or directory\n\n% sudo nano ~/tmp/<any_file>\n\nCtrl+W\nSearch anything.\nCtrl+X\n% ls -l .nano_history\n-rw------- 1 root root 6 Mai  3 22:08 .nano_history\n\n% sudo chown aboettger:aboettger .nano_history\n% ls -l .nano_history                    \n-rw------- 1 aboettger aboettger 6 Mai  3 22:08 .nano_history\n\n% sudo nano ~/tmp/<any_file>\n\nCtrl+W\nSearch anything.\nCtrl+X\n% ls -l .nano_history  \n-rw------- 1 aboettger aboettger 11 Mai  3 22:11 .nano_history\n\n", "Q: Libreoffice doesnt work since update to ubuntu 15.04 The update to Ubuntu 15.04 causes following problem.

What command do I use in the Terminal to switch to root? I have tried --help but I get lost with all the listed help. I'm looking for a recent download/install so I can use it.\n\nA: This is my way.\nOpen a terminal an run this command:\nsudo su -\n\nThe command starts a login shell and you will find yourself in root's home directory with root's environment.\n\nA: Just type su -\nYou gone be asked for your password and after putting it in you'll be logged in as the root user\n\nA: Launch an instance of your terminal (press CTRL+ALT+T or search for \"terminal\" in the Dash). This will give you your normal shell from which you can run commands or programmes without root access.\nTo get root access, you can use one of a variety of methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo <command> and type in your login password, if prompted, to run only that instance of the command as root. Next time you run another or the same command without the sudo prefix, you will not have root access.\n\n*Run sudo -i. This will give you an interactive root shell. Note that the $ at the end of your prompt has changed to a #, indicating that you have root access. But you fall in the root home directory (/root/). From here you can run any sequence of commands as root, or run the command exit to leave the root shell.\n\n*Use the su (substitute user) command to get a root shell. This is effectively the same as using sudo -i. Note that when you use this command it will ask for the root password and not your login password. These are not the same. You may have to set or change the root password by running sudo passwd root first.\n\n*Run sudo -s. This gives you root access, but maintains your current SHELL. Shell specific settings, including your current directory, are preserved. For instance if you use bash (Ubuntu's default shell), aliases (and any other settings from ~/.bashrc) are kept when you switch to the root user. To leave the root access, type exit as in the cases above.\nBe advised that playing around with root access is dangerous, and if you had to ask about root access, you probably shouldn't have the privilege. You have the potential to completely ruin your entire system with the mis-execution of many commands. Be careful and verify what you are doing before you do it. Google is Search engines are your friends.\n\nA: You can use sudo -i which will ask for your password. You need to be in the sudoers group for that or have an entry in the /etc/sudoers file.\nAnother way is the command su - which will ask for the password of root, but accomplish the same.\n", "Q: Reuse front headphone jack as microphone jack I have a Realtek ALC 882 internal audio device in my computer, which supplies three front jacks.

I run it as the special user on one of my machines, and it doesn't prevent me from adding torrents.\nYou should set the config option 'message-level' to 3 and see if the log file provides useful info. My guess is you're trying to save something (the torrent, the target file, resume data, etc) to a location transmission-demon can't write to, because you've changed the default locations for saving these files. If you want them saved to a particular place, you can set up transmission to move the files to a new location when the dl completes, with permissions set up such that transmission-daemon can write there.\nPossibly (i forget my permissions-fu) you could add the transmission-daemon user to the $YOUR_USER_NAME group. this will probably allow it to write where you want it to write.\nin re the security thing: the idea is that since one use of transmission-daemon is to listen to requests from the internet so you can send download jobs to your computer at home or something, it's an attack target. so in the event that somebody hacks it, you want to be sure they don't thereby control your whole machine. so you make a user called transmission-daemon which can only do a few things like run transmission-daemon. this makes it harder to turn hacking transmission-daemon into full-fledged pwnage.\nof course, adding transmission-daemon to your user group will probably make it a lot easier, but whaddaya gonna do?\n", "Q: Increase and decreasing screen brightness crashes Minecraft Problem:\nWhen increasing or decreasing the screen brightness, Minecraft crashes and to an extent freezes my computer UI.

Today I discovered a folder in my home directory with the name .android.\nInside the folder are just two files, adbkey and adbkey.pub.\nI have searched around and have found out that adbkey.pub is a Windows trojan. The files were last modified in January, but were just accessed a few hours ago. I have never used an Android device or Android SDK on my computer.\nI have WINE installed on my computer. I also ran a ClamAV scan on the folder and it didn't detect anything.\nAny ideas what this is and if I should be concerned?\n\nA: If your computer has never had an Android device connected, then I don't know where those files came from. \nOn my computer (as I use both Android and its SDK) those files are an SSH key-pair that allow me to mark my computer as \"trusted\" to my phone.\nSSH keys shouldn't be harmful. \nIf you want to verify that these are SSH keys, open \".android\" in the file browser (Nautilus), right-click on \"adbkey\", and select Properties. The file's Type should be \"PKCS#8 Personal Key in PEM format (application/pkcs8+pem)\" and its Size exactly 1,704B. \"adbkey.pub\" should be a little over 700B.\n(\"adbkey.pub\" is unhelpfully described as a Microsoft Publisher file: I put this down to Nautilus making a guess from the extension; equally unhelpfully, the file command describes them both as \"ASCII text\".)\nI can attach a sample copy of each file, if you want to confirm yours have the correct format.\n\nA: Someone might have plugged their Android phone into one of your USB sockets.

To remove a directory from that, I suppose the easiest way is to edit it directly.

Start by defining each section for networking separately like below,  with different auto entries corresponding with each interface.  Also remember you need to provide a different iface line for each device as well.\nLike this:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\n", "Q: Open multiple firefox tabs from command line I'm trying to open firefox with two tabs from the command line, with two separate web addresses.

When I was running 14.10, konversation worked without issue, but when I upgraded to to 15.04, I was no longer able to right click and save links. When I tried, I received the following message:\n\ncould not start process cannot talk to klauncher the name org.kde.klauncher5 was not provided by any .service files\n\nHow can I solve this problem and be able to right-click and save links again?\n\nA: SUMMARY: apt-get install kinit kio kio-extras kded5\n\nLONG VERSION: \nAfter much searching and experimenting, I was able to find a solution for this problem.\nklauncher is a daemon for service activation in KDE and is controlled by kdeinit supplied by the kinit package.

Before I upgraded to 15.04, the last folder I saved something to was remembered the next time I tried to save something. \nNow, this is not the case.

Suppose the main user name is Umain, and the second one is Uclone.\nThis time, I tried to create the Uclone with the same id as Umain. (I wanted to have everything the same and I didn't consider the consequences) So, I created the Uclone by:\n sudo useradd Uclone -m -N -o -g 1000 -u 1000\n\nThe userid and group id of Umain are 1000, and I tried to create the clone of my user with above command to assign the same userid and groupid to Uclone.\nEverything was fine, until I restart my system. I can't login to Umain anymore and the Uclone is the one that is available in the login page. The Umain exist in the /etc/passwd, however, I can not login to gdm or kdm with Umain user anymore.\nI tried to remove the Uclone but I couldn't. It always replied that there is some process that are running by this user. So, I killed the process and it came back again. I just realized that as the userid are the same, now the system have to problem to recognize the Umain and Uclone. I tried to change the groupid of the Uclone and I was successful. However, I can't change the userid of Umain or Uclone since I get below response.\n $ sudo usermod Uclone -u 1010\n [sudo] password for AnotherUser:\n usermod: user Uclone is currently used by process pid\n\nSo, I am wondering what options I have to fix my system. I think the last hope would be using rescue mode, but I think there should be more easier way to handle this. I appreciate if you can help me to resolve this problem.\nSide note: I am using Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: That's the same user. You can use vipw and vipw -s commands to remove the line that points to the Uclone user. Vipw command use vi as default editor, so you can replace it with some easier, like for example is nano:\nsudo EDITOR=nano vipw\n\n\nA: Actually Umain and Uclone are the same user.\nAnd yes you can't modify the UID of your user since you are login using its credentails and thus you can't chnage ot modify its behavior unless you are not using any other process of your system.\nTo solve your problem(if you think it's) you have many solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a live cd and do whatever you want\n\n*Easiest is create another sudoer user suppose tempUser. Logout from Uclone and use the tempUser to login and then edit whatever for other users.\n\n", "Q: fatal error: netlink/genl/genl.h: No such file or directory I am cross-compiling hostapd for openwrt.

It will copy sector by sector, raw disk data; so it will work only if the partitions are exactly the same size and layout (leading to corruption otherwise). And then you have again another almost-full partion, that you have to extend... messy. And if the source filesystem is almost full, it's probably quite fragmented, and using dd will copy the fragmentation over. \nrsync is a good option, but in this case, giving that you are copying locally to a blank, new disk, I think that the good old cp will do(1). Use it as(2)(3) \ncd sourcedir; cp -av . /destdir \n\n...and be patient. This will rewrite all files, and in the process, the fragmentation of the new filesystem will be better than the original one. \nOn the speed point of view, this should fill the I/O buffers and then the copy will proceed at the maximum data transfer that the disks (and the bus) allow. If the system is otherwise idle, I do not think that there will be huge difference in speed between any method. \n\nNotes:\n(1) caveat: if you have a LOT of small files, cp can be slow. There is an old tar trick for this case... but it's a bit dangerous, so ask if you need it. \n(2) v here means verbose, it will print each file it's copying. It will slow down a bit (or a lot if you have a lot of small files) the copy. YMMV. \n(3) if there are files of different users, you will need to say sudo cp... to maintain correct ownerships and modes. \n\nA: you can either use some tools like clonezilla , redo backup\nor you can use command line tools such the command dd\ndd if=/dev/sdXX of=/dev/sdXX bs=4096 \n\ncheck this for how to dd\nor the command rsync\nrsync -av /mount-point-of-first-drive /mount-point-of-second-drive\n\nbased on @Rman, for your case it's better to use rsync. Else if you want to use dd you shoulf specify the hdd size to copy and then you have to correct the partition size using gparted.\n", "Q: In 15.04, Ubuntu SDK \"make\" is failing to build and run Ubuntu Core apps for the desktop.

Having the command promt on full brightness looks nice, but eats battery like hell, and i don't need it.\nI've read about using systemd-backlight - something, but I can't find anything on how to use it or make it so it restores my brightness on bootup...also, does this work without starting up X? Is there even a way to change the screen brightness without starting X?\n(if it matters: running an Asus N550JK which has an intel and nvidia dual graphics thing, called optimus...I'm not using that, only using the intel one. xBacklight changes the value in /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness, my desired value would be 244)\nThanks for everything!\n\nA: \nI've read about using systemd-backlight - something, but I can't find anything on how to use it or make it so it restores my brightness on bootup\n\nMany of these things are quite poorly documented in systemd.  The documentation pretty much boils down to \"systemd-wibble.service is a service that runs systemd-wibble, and systemd-wibble is a program run by systemd-wibble.service; and it wibbles.\".  There's no real explanation of how, when, or where; or clue as to how this fits into an overall system.  The systemd-backlight manual page is a case in point.\nWhat happens is this:\nYou don't run the service, or the program, directly.  Instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*A udev rule is triggered by the presence of \"backlight\" or \"leds\" devices on your system.  (It's in the the 99-systemd.rules list.)  \n\n*udev takes the name of the device that triggered the rule and incorporates it into a service name. \n\n*This service is an instantiation of the systemd-backlight@.service service template unit file.\n\n*udev tells systemd to activate the service.\n\n*The service unit file causes the template parameter to be passed as a command-line argument to the systemd-backlight command, which then does its thing.\n\n\nIn your case, this would end up activating a systemd-backlight@backlight:intel_backlight.service service, which would end up running systemd-backlight start backlight:intel_backlight \nSo your basic problem could be one of three things:  your service unit is masked, the udev rule isn't triggering, or it's not triggering as the right kind of device.\nsystemctl status systemd-backlight@backlight:intel_backlight.service should give you some idea.\n\nA: Try the suggestion here and see if it works for you. So open the file:\nsudo nano /etc/rc.local\nand add the following line:\necho 244 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\nReboot and see if this helped you.\n\nA: I have a Dell laptop with Nvidia and Intel graphics and was facing a similar problem.\nWith help from the answer above by JdeBP and this post from the ArchLinux forums here is what I did to resolve the problem(for now):\nAs root:\necho 1 > /sys/class/backlight/dell_backlight/brightness\n\n/lib/systemd/systemd-backlight save backlight:dell_backlight\n\nThis created a file in /var/lib/systemd/backlight named platform-dell-laptop:backlight:dell_backlight with the value 1. A similar attempt with intel backlight did not seem to work.\nIt appears for now that the systemd-backlight service is reading this value on boot and setting the display brightness accordingly.\n", "Q: ZFS with existing data on 1 HDD I'm thinking about adding a ZFS Raid-5 to my Ubuntu Server (Home use only). Currently, I have 2 HDD, 1 is 120GB for OS and the other is 4TB for download and torrent.\nI will purchase an addition HDD to use ZFS with the existing 4TB HDD. \nBut my question is how to setup ZFS with the 4TB HDD with existing data on it. I have too much data on it, and it will be a pain to back up about 2TB to another HDD and install ZFS and retransfer it back to ZFS.\nMany thanks guys,\nBest regards,\nLong\n\nA: There is no way to convert in place a non ZFS file system to a ZFS one. You need to backup the former, create the pool and restore your data.\nIt is also unclear how you want to create a RAIDZ pool with only two 4TB disks. You can only create a mirror or a stripe with two devices.\n\nA: It is not possible to reformat your drive without losing all the data stored on it.\n\nA: Resize (shrink) partition to have free space, create the ZFS on free space, transfer info from non ZFS to ZFS, then remove old non ZFS partition and grow ZFS.\nNO need to copy data to other disk, just have a lot of care when shrink partition and ensure data copied to ZFS is identical (verify the 'copy').\n", "Q: HTTP Proxy Using Squid on Ubuntu 12.04 and anonymizing the traffic I read this great step-by-step. I would like to use this and anonymize the traffic too.\nBasically I want to create an HTTP Proxy Using Squid on Ubuntu 12.04 and anonymizing the traffic. The proxy will be reached from non-local sources. I used this tutorial initially but although it works with some programs it apparently does not allow for browsers to get http-data for some reason (\"the proxy servers is refusing connections\" is what my browser tells me).\nSo: I would like to use the step-by-step (first link) and add the lines to anonymize the traffic. How would one go about that?\nMy idea is to just add the code below to the squid.conf file:\n  forwarded_for off\n  request_header_access Allow allow all\n  request_header_access Authorization allow all\n  request_header_access WWW-Authenticate allow all\n  request_header_access Proxy-Authorization allow all\n  request_header_access Proxy-Authenticate allow all\n  request_header_access Cache-Control allow all\n  request_header_access Content-Encoding allow all\n  request_header_access Content-Length allow all\n  request_header_access Content-Type allow all\n  request_header_access Date allow all\n  request_header_access Expires allow all\n  request_header_access Host allow all\n  request_header_access If-Modified-Since allow all\n  request_header_access Last-Modified allow all\n  request_header_access Location allow all\n  request_header_access Pragma allow all\n  request_header_access Accept allow all\n  request_header_access Accept-Charset allow all\n  request_header_access Accept-Encoding allow all\n  request_header_access Accept-Language allow all\n  request_header_access Content-Language allow all\n  request_header_access Mime-Version allow all\n  request_header_access Retry-After allow all\n  request_header_access Title allow all\n  request_header_access Connection allow all\n  request_header_access Proxy-Connection allow all\n  request_header_access User-Agent allow all\n  request_header_access Cookie allow all\n  request_header_access All deny all\n\nBut then I am absolutely not sure if that holds up, and I would like to know for sure.\n\nA: Looks good to me. It matches my proxy settings except that the first line for you comes after all of my \"request_header_access ...\" lines.\nThat line forwarded_for off is what makes the difference between your true client IP being passed as the originating IP (on) or the proxy's IP being used as the origin (off). This is important when trying to access geo-specific resources from outside of the allowed geographic location.\nFor insurance I also have always_direct deny all as the last line in the file to make sure that no traffic is passed directly to the client. All traffic must go through the proxy. \n", "Q: Re-install and keep home partition with btrfs - lost files So, I was running Arch Linux with separate / and /home. Both were btrfs partitions, but the whole drive was not managed by btrfs.\nI decide to install Ubuntu 14.04. I carefully select to format / and do-not-format /home. I set the new (Ubuntu) username to the same as the old (Arch) username.\nI expected that I would boot up into my old account. Instead it boots into a fresh account and all of my files are deleted.\nHowever, btrfs now reports 99% space used in /home, even though there are no files. So it looks like the old files are there somewhere, and the filesystem was not formatted.\nWhat exactly has happened here? Is there any way to recover my lost files?\nBut I still don't really understand what happened here.\n\nA: your files are still there since you don't format the partition that contains that your home files.\nBut they don't appear since the partition is not mounted so what you need to do is to mount the old partition.\nmkdir /media/old_partition\n\nsudo mount -t btrfs /dev/sdXX /media/old_partition\n\nReplace XX with number of hdd and partition number that contains your /home\n", "Q: Is there a way to feed commands to ubuntu at runtime? what I want is way to feed commands to Ubuntu at runtime that is to so that i don not have to wait for resources that gets locked to be free for example during during update\nwe get this error messsage while trying to execute other commands with sudo access \nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?\n\nwhat i want is way to execute my scripts at like batch processing but i could remove any batch jobs any time i want\nI would like a dynamic script/program with root access to do all my jobs.\n\nA: The error message you displayed is not shown because some process is using sudo. \nThis indicates that you are doing some package management for your system (update, upgrade, install....) \nSo with regard to your demand I'm afraid to say for you that you can't do that in Linux, since the package management always demand the lock to disable other user of using the package management in the time another process is running.\nImagine for example: \nuser1 is updating the vim package whilst  user2 is removing the vim package.\nHow can you deal with this situation?!\nFor that and from the  basics of the package management I could say you can't do that.\n", "Q: Problem with partioning my drive [Ubuntu 14.04] I am only running ubuntu 14.04 on my system.

[partition: /dev/sda1, File System: ext4, Size: 694 GB, Unused: 503 GB, Flags: boot]\n\n*Select resize\n\n\nAt step 3 it does not allow me to resize. I cannot drag the bar or type in my free size box. \nWhat should I do to create a new partition?\n\nA: This answer is based on the assumption that you are trying to modify the partition which you are booted off and currently using (/dev/sda1), from what you described. Gparted won't allow you to modify a partition that is mounted and in use.\nTo modify your /dev/sda partitions you can boot from a live CD or other boot media that has Gparted installed on it (your Ubuntu live media will have it installed already) and perform the same procedure that you mentioned in your question. In theory this should work absolutely fine because the /dev/sda partitions shouldn't be in use.\nBefore going ahead with this I highly advise to **back up any data that you need** as it may be lost if you do an operation incorrectly when modifying the partitions.\nKind regards,\njkrix\n", "Q: Live DVD and status DRDY I am trying to install Linux on my pc as dualboot.

And I am new user of Linux. I have installed ubuntu for programming purpose. But when I am using Android Studio with 2 or 3 applications runnning in background. System hangs even I cant move the cursor. I always run my application on phone. I dont use emulator. My phone is Xperia L(C2104). This is not the problem of phone because maximum time it hangs while indexing or gradling the project.\nDoes anyone know the possible causes of system hanging in these situation ?\n\nA: Does Ubuntu hang when you are not using the Android virtual mobile device emulator? Genymotion is much faster than the Android emulator in Android Studio, and the HP Pavilion dv6-6155tx with its Core i5 processor and 4GB RAM could easily run it. \nSince the laptop is hanging when you run your application on the phone, you could try developing your application on a virtual Android OS in Genymotion. This would buy you some time to keep on developing your application, while you try to find out why the phone is making your laptop hang. \nBecause your existing project is getting stuck in Gradle, I wonder if you created a new project in Android Studio to print something to the screen if it would build properly. \n", "Q: Want to start few services automatically during system boot I am using latest ubuntu version: Ubuntu 15.04 (GNU/Linux 3.16.0-36-generic x86_64)\nWhen i reboot my whole system, i need to restart telnet, nagios services manually. \nWould you please let me know how to add this in crontask or any other easy way to do that. So, that i don't need to restart those services manually.\n\nA: Ubuntu has a program where you can set certain programs to run at startup. I'm in KDE right now, so I can't get the exact name, but it should come up with a search of startup. Here, point to the script you use to start the services (make sure the script is executable) and apply. If you use commands to start the services, make a .sh file with #!bin/bash at the top and your commands below. If you start the two services with programs, find the paths to those and point the startup app to them.\nIf this is completely wrong, tell me: I'll delete it.\n\nA: A possibility to start application on boot can be done with crontab.\nExample\n/etc/crontab\n @reboot    root    /usr/local/bin/your-programm.sh\n\nThe @reboot will also apply when you only boot your system.\n", "Q: Connect to a SFTP-server using FileZilla  I have an issue when I'm trying to connect to a SFTP-server using FileZilla.

I have 2 screen where one is normal horizontal, and the other one is vertical. \n\nAfter I changed that files that I download to desktop are no longer visible. I can see them in Nautilus->Desktop, but not by bare eye. I guess Ubuntu puts those files in the virtual area below BenQ monitor and leftOf the vertical monitor.\nAny ideas how to solve this?\nNote: Files on my desktop are manually sorted and Keep Aligned is ticked off!\nThis is not the duplicate of How to configure GNOME 3 to show icons on desktop as this does not deal with desktop icons like Trash, My Network, etc. The actual file is not visible on BENQ screen. I also installed this app, but it neither helps nor has the feature mentioned in that post. I guess the post is too old and the app had changed as of then. \n\nA: What happens\nYour assumption that the downloaded files \"landed\" in the \"blind\" area is correct: You can get the icons position with the command:\ngvfs-info <item>\n\nThis outputs the coordinates 64,1382 (x/y), which makes clear the icon is positioned below the left screen (1382 > 1080).\nThis is most likely the result of a bug.\nThe script below can be used to move newly created files on the virtual (spanning) desktop from one area (e.g. the invisible section) to another location (in this case: the visible section).\nProperties of the script\nAlthough the script seems extended, it is written in such a way that unnecessary actions and routines are avoided. If no new items appear on the desktop, it only checks for new files, causing a processor load of practically none.\nWhat it does\n\n\n*\n\n*Once per second, the script checks for new items in the desktop folder\n\n*If new item(s) are found, it checks the location, moves them into the visible area if necessary\n\n\n\nHowever, the desktop needs to be refreshed after the items are moved, which can only be done if the desktop is the frontmost \"folder\". The script therefore sets refresh to True. On the first occasion the desktop is in front, the script:\n\n\n*\n\n*refreshes the desktop.\n\n\nHow to use\nThe script needs both xdotool and wmctrl to be installed:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nxautomation should already be on your system, but in case it is not:\nsudo apt-get install xautomation\n\nThen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as blind_area.py\n\n*In the head section of the script, set the size of your left screen:\nleft_scr = [1920, 1080]\n\n\n*Set the localized name for your desktop folder (probably just \"Desktop\", but in Dutch it would be \"Bureaublad\" for example)\n\n*Set the resolution of the left screen if it is different from what I set\n\n*Test-run the script by the command:\npython3 /path/to/blind_area.py\n\n\n*I test-ran it by setting the vertical size of my screen to half its actual size, which moved all new(!) icons to the top 50% of my screen.\n\n*Note that the move actions will be visible once you clicked the desktop (or have the desktop in front in any way).\n\n*If all works fine, add it to your startup applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15&&python3 /path/to/blind_area.py\"\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport time\n\n#--- set localized name of the Desktop folder below\ndesktop_name = \"Desktop\"\n#--- set the resolution of the left screen below\nleft_scr = [1920, 1080]\n#---\n\nget = lambda cmd: subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\")\nhome = os.environ[\"HOME\"]\ndr = home+\"/\"+desktop_name\n# used strings\nval = \" 'metadata::nautilus-icon-position' \"\nsearch = \"gvfs-info -a\"+val\nset_val = \"gvfs-set-attribute -t string \"\nrefresh_cmd = \"xte 'key F5'\"\n# function to check if desktop is in front\ndef check_frontmost():\n    try:\n        frontmost = str(hex(int(get(\"xdotool getwindowfocus\").strip())))\n        frontmost = frontmost[:2]+\"0\"+frontmost[2:]\n        w_list = [l.split() for l in get(\"wmctrl -lG\").splitlines()]\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        return False\n    else:\n        check = len([l for l in w_list if all([str(space[0]) in l, frontmost in l, str(space[1]) in l])]) > 0\n        return check\n# function to get the resolution\ndef get_res():\n    xr = get(\"xrandr\").split(); pos = xr.index(\"current\")\n    return [int(xr[pos+1]), int(xr[pos+3].replace(\",\", \"\") )]\n\ndtfiles_1 = []\nrefresh = False\n\nwhile True:\n    # check current files\n    time.sleep(1)\n    dtfiles_2 = os.listdir(dr)\n    # check for new files, move if necessary\n    newfiles = [f for f in dtfiles_2 if all([\n        not f in dtfiles_1,\n        not f.endswith(\"~\"),\n        not f.startswith(\".\"),\n        ])]\n    if len(newfiles) != 0:\n        # check desktop size (only if new files appear)\n        space = get_res()\n    for f in newfiles:\n        fdir = os.path.join(dr, f);  fdir = \"'\"+fdir+\"'\" if fdir.count(\" \") != 0 else fdir\n        try:\n            loc = [int(n) for n in eval(get(search+fdir).split()[-1:][0])]\n        except:\n            pass\n        else:\n            if all([loc[0] < left_scr[0], loc[1] > left_scr[1]]):\n                command = set_val+fdir+\" \"+val+str(loc[0])+\",\"+str(loc[1]-left_scr[1])\n                subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n                refresh = True\n    if all([refresh == True, check_frontmost() == True]):\n        subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", refresh_cmd])\n        refresh = False\n    dtfiles_1 = dtfiles_2\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*Although I tested it for a long time on my system, the bug does not appear on my system, so the \"real\" test can only be done by you :)\n\n*If the desktop is really crowded with lots if items, the refresh action might arrange icons into a \"forbidden\" area. I could not test however if that is the case in your situation, for the same reason as above.\n\n*The script, as it is, assumes the screens are top-alligned, so the \"blind\" area is only on the left bottom corner.\n\n", "Q: I don't have permission to access the subdirectories of a mounted share I created After I mounted a domain share I tried to find duplicates with fdupes, but then I found out that I don't have permissions to the subdirectories of the share.\nThis is how I mounted the share:\nFirst I made the /media/sharename with mkdir.\nThen I added this line in /etc/fstab:\n//servername/sharename /media/sharename cifs credentials=/home/ubuntuusername/.smbcredentials,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm 0 0\n\nAnd I made the file with the credentials with:\ngedit ~/.smbcredentials\n\nusername=msusername\npassword=mspassword\ndomain=DOMAIN\n\nThen I used the sudo mount -a to mount the share.\nI can reach the share (also at the GUI) but I cannot open the subdirs because I don't have permissions.\nIs the share not looking at the permissions of my MS account/credentials?\nOr do I have to change something in the fstab line to do that? Or is it possible to do this another way?\n\nA: I found a way what worked for me! I changed the /etc/fstab to:\n//servername/sharename /media/sharename cifs credentials=/home/ubuntuusername/.smbcredentials,rw,nounix,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777,sec=ntlm 0 0\n\nAlso I made my account sudoer by adding a line in /etc/sudoers\n%Group ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n", "Q: Install Click build targets in Terminal The recommended/normal procedure is to install click build targets in Ubuntu SDK but I wanted to know if it's possible to install them in terminal.\n\nA: AFAIK the recommended way is to use pkcon. Copy your .click file to the device and run the following command on the device itself (by using adb shell or SSH):\npkcon --allow-untrusted install-local com.ubuntu.developer.abc.def_0.123_armhf.click\n\nThis does not require root privileges.\n\nA: You can use the click command to install packages on your device.\nFirst copy the .click file on your device.\nThen use the following commands (e.g after creating a remote session with phablet-shell):\nsudo click install --all-users ./com.ubuntu.foo_1.0.click  --allow-unauthenticated\nclick register com.ubuntu.foo 1.0\n\nJust change the name of the package for your needs.\n", "Q: copy from python to excel (xlwt) I'm trying to copy data to an excel file using xlwt in a python code\n  worksheet.write(globdat.cycle,1,fint)\n\nglobdat.cycle is a count.

You have to specify which row/column you're writing to so we can use the builtin enumerate to count out each item in the array.\nYou want something like this:\nfor i, fintitem in enumerate(fint, start=1):\n    worksheet.write(globdat.cycle, i, fintitem)\n\n", "Q: Cross compling Gstreamer for ARM Hi i was trying to compile Gstreamer for ARM platform.

Since these programs are third-party and i'm not always 100% sure of their reliability, i would run these programs with specific permissions. Since these programs will need to write file to disk, i want to set up permissions to deny access to the entire hard disk (i dont want even read-only), except for one directory where these programs will write into. \nI thought that the easiest way to achieve this is:\n\n\n*\n\n*create the group \"third-parties\"\n\n*create the user \"third-parties-user\"\n\n*deny access to the entire hard disk (even not read-only) to group \"third-parties\"\n\n*allow read-write into /var/example/thirdparties\n\n*set \"third-parties-user\" as the owner of the programs i have to run\n\n*write a cronjob under \"third-parties-user\" to start programs at startup (something like @reboot sh /var/example/thirdparties/run-all-thirdparties-programs.sh )\n\n\nMy question is..technically talking, how can i create those group/user and set up permissions? if i run a program owned by specific user, will that program inherit permissions from his owner group/user?\ni'm completely new in Ubuntu Server..\nAlso.. if anyone has a better idea to reach my goal, i have big ears :)\nthanks\n\nA: The standard permission system in Linux does not support well the use case that you are describing (for example \"deny access to the entire hard-disk\"). A better approach would be to try using chroot or docker, to make sure that the program runs in an environment that is isolated from the main system.\n", "Q: hide grub on computer start I tried all the methods that comes in google search for \"hide the grub menu on computer start\", but still no luck, I guess things work differently on Ubuntu 15.04 ?\nthis is my grub\n # If you change this file, run 'update-grub' afterwards to update\n # /boot/grub/grub.cfg.\n # For full documentation of the options in this file, see:\n #   info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration'\n\n GRUB_DEFAULT=0\n GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\n GRUB_TIMEOUT=0\n GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\n GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"libahci.ignore_sss=1 vesafb.invalid=1 quite nopat drm.debug=0xe\"\n GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\n # Uncomment to enable BadRAM filtering, modify to suit your needs\n # This works with Linux (no patch required) and with any kernel that obtains\n # the memory map information from GRUB (GNU Mach, kernel of FreeBSD ...)\n #GRUB_BADRAM=\"0x01234567,0xfefefefe,0x89abcdef,0xefefefef\"\n\n # Uncomment to disable graphical terminal (grub-pc only)\n #GRUB_TERMINAL=console\n\n # The resolution used on graphical terminal\n # note that you can use only modes which your graphic card supports via VBE\n # you can see them in real GRUB with the command `vbeinfo'\n #GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480\n\n # Uncomment if you don't want GRUB to pass \"root=UUID=xxx\" parameter to Linux\n #GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true\n\n # Uncomment to disable generation of recovery mode menu entries\n #GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY=\"true\"\n\n # Uncomment to get a beep at grub start\n #GRUB_INIT_TUNE=\"480 440 1\"\n GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=text\n\ngrub.cfg file:\n #\n # DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE\n #\n # It is automatically generated by grub-mkconfig using templates\n # from /etc/grub.d and settings from /etc/default/grub\n #\n\n ### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/00_header ###\n if [ -s $prefix/grubenv ];

My BIOS is UEFI\nUPDATE:  I triple boot Ubuntu (default, since I use it 90% of time), arch linux, windows( for games occasionally). so I select Ubuntu most of the time i want to boot directly to it, but occasionally if i want to boot to other OS, i would like to \"press shift key and see the grub and select the desired OS\", thats why I want to hide grub\nUPDATE2: when i set grub timeout to 0 it becomes 10sec on boot, dont know why...\n\nA: In /etc/default/grub set:\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=\"1\"\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=\"true\"\n#GRUB_TIMEOUT=\"1\"\n\nThat will allow you to have a very short time interval of 1 second to still press Shift while booting to get the advanced menu, while not running into the 10-second problem in \nif [ \"${timeout}\" = 0 ]; then\nset timeout=10\nfi\n\nin /boot/grub/grub.cfg.\n(Meaning, \"0\" is allowed, but just gets set to \"10\" in a deeper level of the config to protect users from themselves)\n\nA: Did you try to replace\n...\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\n...\n\nwith \n...\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE='hidden'\n...\n\n?\nAccording to the docu (`info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration') the first\nis deprecated and one should use the ''less confusing'' style option.\n\nA: I have solved the \"grub not hiding at boot\" problem in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS only by installing the Boot Repair software. \nBefore that, I have tried plenty of suggestions found on google by typing: \"how to hide grub in Ubuntu 18.04 at boot\".\n\nNote: To install the mentioned software, first add the PPA in terminal:\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\n\n$ sudo apt update\n\nThen, install Boot Repair software:\n$ sudo apt install boot-repair\n\nOnce installed and opened (by typing: \"$ boot-repair\"), the \"Recommended repair (repairs most frequent problems)\" button made the grub hide at boot for my case.\nSource: https://linuxconfig.org/ubuntu-boot-repair\n\nA: Edit the config file.\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nWhen the file opens, remove “#” before “GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0″ and set “GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true”. So it looks like:\n…\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=”`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`”\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash”\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=”\"\n…\n\nSave the file and apply the changes by running below command:\nsudo update-grub\n\nFor your case i assume you haven't do update-grub\n\nA: Open /etc/default/grub in your favorite text editor (I'm using nano here):\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nFind the line that says:\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=<some number here, eg: 10>\n\nand change it to:\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=1\n\nThis will show the menu, but for just a second and after that it will boot the default entry. If it is set to 0, still you will see it for 10 seconds as a security measure. So put 1 there.\nSave and exit. Run sudo update-grub\nAnother suggestion: Add the following line in your /etc/default/grub file:\nGRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=\"true\"\nAfter the line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=”\"\nNote This will deactivate os-prober (so other OSs will not be listed)\nIf you want other OSs to be shown, remove the line GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=\"true\" from /etc/default/grub (if you followed the above suggestion and added the line) and put the following code in /etc/grub.d/00_header:\n### BEGIN Hidden Menu Test ###\ncat << EOF\nif [ ${timeout} != -1 ]; then\nif sleep --verbose --interruptible ${GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT} ; then\nset timeout=${GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT}\nfi\nfi\nEOF\n### END Hidden Menu Test ###\n\nSave and exit. Run sudo update-grub\nYou can now plug-in different values as you like in GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT in /etc/default/grub to set the time for which you want the menu to be hidden. This 'fix' is discussed in more detail here.\n\nA: Have you tried this solution (works for me from 13.10 to 15.04)?\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0.0\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0.0\n\nPerhaps you've tried it, but rather to ask.\n\nA: You can try running a few commands after changing GRUB_TIMEOUT (at grub defaults file) to 0:\nsudo update-initramfs -u\nsudo update-grub\nsudo update-grub2\n\n\nA: I just dealt with this and found that setting\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=countdown\n\nor\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden\n\nin /etc/defaults/grub caused a countdown to be displayed our a blank screen to be displayed for the duration of the timeout.\nSee the following link for more information\n", "Q: ifconfig sets wrong broadcast until ran again This issue is very confusing for me. ifconfig sets a different broadcast address than specified, until I run the same command again.\nI'm trying to change the eth0 interface:\ninet addr:172.23.5.1  Bcast:172.23.5.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n\n\nI then run ifconfig eth0 broadcast 172.23.6.255 netmask 255.255.255.0 172.23.6.1\n(note how Bcast is now .255.255 instead of the specified .6.255.):\ninet addr:172.23.6.1  Bcast:172.23.255.255  Mask:255.255.0.0\n\nWhen I run the same command again, the Bcast is as specified:\ninet addr:172.23.6.1  Bcast:172.23.6.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is this happening?\n\n*Is there a way to fix this?\n\n\nA: Usually you don't need to specify broadcast. The broadcast address is the last address in subnet. The network mask already specifies the range of the subnet. When you configure an interface, you may set the IP address and network mask only.\nThe order of the parameters in your command is wrong.\nYou tell your NIC to set broadcast and netmask before ip address. That's why you run into this problem.\nifconfig sets broadcast and netmask and after that sets the ip address.\nIP address 172.23.6.1 is B class of address, more here, and the default network mask is 255.255.0.0. You have to set your broadcast to 172.16.255.255 before setting the IP address.\n\nWith the right order of parameters you'll not have that problem.\nifconfig ethX xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx broadcast xxx.xxx.xxx.yyy netmask yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy\n\nor\nifconfig ethX  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx netmask yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy\n\nYou don't need to specify the broadcast\n", "Q: Nautilus occasionally stops working On ubuntu 14.04 LTS, sometimes my computer fails to launch Nautilus.

I'm trying to make (what I think) is a very simple setup with my server, but I'm finding a ton of conflicting information.  I'm using my server to share folders via samba to two Windows 8.1 machines and various Android devices.  I'm also running Transmission and have a separate folder system set up for that. \nFor my purposes, I effectively have 4 users. root userA userB debian-transmission\nI want userA and userB to have read/write permissions on all current and all created files in multiple directories, including the directories owned and written by debian-transmission.  However, when transmission downloads a file, it is the owner and userA and userB cannot access the files and move them to another folder without SSHing into the server and manually changing the permissions on the files.\nMy research results so far fall into two camps.  The first is that I should be using a ACL approach, the second is that ACL is overkill and all of this can be done with standard permissions.  I've tried multiple guides for making it work with standard permissions, but have gotten nowhere.\nAny guidance would be appreciated.\n\nA: SETGID was the answer I was looking for.  I opted to avoid the ACL approach as most reading I did indicated it was overkill for my purposes.\nFirst step was to go to create a new group to hold my users:\nsudo groupadd MyNewGroup\n\nThen add my users to it:\nsudo usermod -aG MyNewGroup userA\nsudo usermod -aG MyNewGroup userB\nsudo usermod -aG MyNewGroup debian-transmission\n\nAssign ownership to the folder and all its child folders:\nsudo chown -R userA:MyNewGroup /mnt/ParentFolder\n\nAdd permissions as needed to all existing files:\nchmod -R 770 /mnt/ParentFolder\n\nAnd this was the part eluding me, set the GID so that all new files are owned by the group:\nchmod g+s /mnt/ParentFolder\n\nAll new files created in directories set like this will allow anyone in the group to have the permissions you have set.\n", "Q: Using Menu key as Compose key in Ubuntu 15.04 pops up a menu instead I configured my Compose key to be the Menu key as in this question.

This causes any mounts made no to show up in /run/user//gvfs.\nWhere can I find the mount point for SMB shares in 13.04?\nVLC uses these mounts to access and play files.\nIf the mounts are not available, vlc uses the samba-plugin to create a connection.\nA workaround is to kill the gvfsd, so a new deamon will be created when the files are accessed.\nkillall --user $(id -un) gvfsd\n\n\nA: I was having trouble getting VLC in Ubuntu to play a windows share, nothing would be displayed if I navigated to the folder.

The Display manager (in this case, lightdm) creates and manages the login/x session.

Inkscape Stable\n\n\n\n*Use the link View package details\n\n\n\n*Use the link eg. inkscape - 0.91.0+47~ubuntu15.04.1\n\n\n\n*Use the link eg. inkscape_0.91.0+47~ubuntu15.04.1_amd64.deb\n\n\nA: I just needed this too, but wanted an automated way to get the latest version of the .deb, without needing a browser every time. \nHere's a full list of commands that you can put in a script and which always gets you the latest version .deb from the phpmyadmin ppa, whatever the latest version is at the time (replace nijel/phpmyadmin with the source of the ppa you're interested in):\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:nijel/phpmyadmin\nsudo apt-get update\ncd /tmp\napt-get download phpmyadmin\nsudo add-apt-repository -y -r ppa:nijel/phpmyadmin\nsudo apt-get update\n\nYou will then have some phpmyadmin*.deb file in /tmp. The above will add and then remove the phpmyadmin ppa source from your system. If you don't want it removed, then just comment the last two lines.\n", "Q: Does the UEFI partition either \"MUST\" or \"SHOULD\" be first for some reason? If so why? In a non-English Ubuntu-it.org wiki page it's stated that the UEFI partition MUST be always placed at the start of the disk.\nThis is not the case in the English Ubuntu Community Help Wiki page.\nSo does the UEFI partition either \"MUST\" or \"SHOULD\" (assuming a bad wording in the former page) be first for some reason? If so why? Or this is totally irrelevant?\n\nA: The EFI specification specifically states that there are no limits on this detail:\n\nUEFI does not impose a restriction on the number or location of System Partitions that can exist on a system.\n\n(Version 2.5, p. 540.)\nAs a practical matter, putting the ESP first is advisable because this location is unlikely to be impacted by partition moving and resizing operations. For instance, suppose the ESP exists between OS A and OS B partitions, and you decide to delete OS B and give its space to OS A. In this case, you'll need to move the ESP before you can expand the OS A partition. Also, some tools, such as efibootmgr, use /dev/sda1 as the default location for the ESP. Thus, if you place the ESP elsewhere and then forget to override the defaults, you can create an unbootable entry.\nPutting the ESP at the end of the disk can work almost as well in most cases, but there are some subtle problems with that approach. For one thing, if you change the number of partitions, the number of the ESP may no longer match its position on the disk, or some partitioning tools may renumber it. Either outcome can cause confusion or require reconfiguration. Also, if you use RAID and add disk space, an ESP at the end of the disk will suddenly become one in the middle, which may require you to move it.\nMany pre-installed Windows systems put the ESP at position #2, with #1 being occupied by a small manufacturer-specific partition. Such a configuration works fine, and since the manufacturer's partition is also unlikely to be moved or deleted, this configuration isn't really any worse than putting the ESP at position #1. I wouldn't go out of my way to \"fix\" such a configuration, but I also wouldn't do it that way myself, if I were given a blank disk and told to start installing OSes.\nOverall, if you have some compelling reason to create an ESP at other than the first position, feel free to do so; but if you're starting with a blank disk and have no compelling reason otherwise, I'd put the ESP first.\n\nA: The key words \"SHOULD\", \"MUST\" and \"MAY\" (capitalised) in this answer are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\nAn (U)EFI System Partition (ESP from now on):\n\n\n*\n\n*MAY reside at the beginning of the disk\nand \n\n*SHOULD be FAT32 because of Windows compatibility.\n\n\nThe only official limit is:\n\n\n*\n\n*the ESP MUST reside in the first 2.2 Terabytes of the disk.\n\n\nSo, the ESP MUST reside anywhere in those first 2.2 TB of the disk, but there is absolutely no need for the ESP to be the first partition or reside on the beginning of the disk whatsoever.\n(It's just that some large company in Redmond, WA advises system integrators differently)...\nI would put it as the last partition on the disk (if < 2.2TB) as it's only used to load other OSes, but that's just a personal, totally subjective opinion!\n", "Q: Where can I find a Ubuntu 12.04 image for ARM v6?

Then i restarted Windows and Windows failed to boot and then Ubuntu booted.\nWindows don't boot until i remove the secondary disk.\nUbuntu uses UEFI and i think that is the problem, but i am not sure.\nThat would mean that as far as there is a second disk in your computer, windows can't boot.\nBut it's a different disk, and i am not using grub to boot windows. Windows is still the first boot device. And i don't want to boot Ubuntu from the BIOS att all. I just want to start ubuntu through VMware.\nAny ideas why windows fails to boot when there is another disk that has a MBR even if that is not in the boot list of the BIOS?\nEdit:\nI don't want to boot Ubuntu and I don't want a dual boot.\nI just want to boot Windows while the Ubuntu disk is connected, so I can later start VMware in Windows that is configured to load that Ubuntu from a separate disk.\nBut windows don't boot as long as the Ubuntu disk is connected. It's only connected at a SATA port, its is not configured as a boot option, only Windows is.\nBut I think that is not possible with UEFI (some security thing?) but I thought I ask for help before I reinstall Windows without UEFI...\n\nA: Try using EasyUEFI in Windows. It's a GUI tool for managing EFI boot loaders, and it should enable you to set Windows as the default boot option.\nIf you wanted to do the same thing in Ubuntu, you'd use the efibootmgr program: Type sudo efibootmgr to see the options, then use the -o option to set the boot order as desired.\n", "Q: Unable to upgrade or remove broken virtualbox package I'll start with some details of what led up to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm using Ubuntu 14.0 (KDE on top although presumably that's irrelevant)\n\n*a few days ago I let the system do an auto-upgrade.\n\n*It crashed partway through when trying to update Virtualbox, which I assumed to be due to my having it up and running at the time.

In short, after you insert your SIM card, type Network connections in the dash and click Add, select Mobile Broadband and follow the on-screen instructions.\nAlso you need appropriate drivers for the slot to work. To see if there's any, go to System Settings - Software and Updates - Additional Drivers. Install the listed drivers (if any) that you can relate to WWAN.\nEDIT: According to the output of your lsusb, I think the Gobi 2000 is the driver you want to use. If you can not find this from 'Additional drivers' from the above step try installing gobi-loader by (you need internet connection (wifior ethernet, I hope you can enable there in your laptop):\nsudo apt-get install gobi-loader\nand following instructions here or here help you. \nBasically you need to extract the drivers from windows.\n", "Q: Is iwlwifi or iwldvm or wext the wireless driver? From https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/iwlwifi:\n\niwlwifi is the wireless driver for Intel's current wireless chips.\n\nFrom https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/iwlwifi#firmware\nDevice  Kernels     Module  Firmware\nIntel® Wireless WiFi 5150AGN    2.6.29+     iwldvm  iwlwifi-5150-ucode-8.24.2.2.tgz\n\nwhich says iwldvm is the \"module\".\n\n\n*\n\n*Isn't a driver a module?\n\n*which  is the wireless driver (module) for the wifi adapter,   iwlwifi or iwldvm?\n\n*Is wext also some kind of driver module, but why is it not listed in lsmod or lshw? See also https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/198509/674 \nThanks.\n\nA: Not every module is a driver, and drivers can use multiple modules. For further information read this U&L thread.\nAs for your specific question:\n$ modinfo iwlwifi | grep description\ndescription:    Intel(R) Wireless WiFi driver for Linux\n$ modinfo iwldvm | grep description\ndescription:    Intel(R) Wireless WiFi Link AGN driver for Linux\n$ modinfo iwldvm | grep depends\ndepends:        iwlwifi,mac80211,cfg80211\n\nAs you see, the iwldvm module belongs to a driver for a very specific group of Intel WiFi chips. It is optimized to work the best with the WiFi Link AGN devices.\nHowever, it says to depend on iwlwifi, which, on the contrary, simply states to be a \"Intel WiFi driver\", so it is a generic driver, which should work with a lot of Intel WiFi devices.\nI don't know the exact way Intel drivers work, but I could imagine the following:\niwlwifi enables basic interaction with the WiFi device. If you only had iwlwifi, your WiFi could work perfectly, reduced or not at all.\nFor the latter two cases, here comes a more specified module, such as iwldvm, which contains operations needed for more complex tasks. With this driver, the WiFi should work properly, but it still requires iwlwifi.\n", "Q: Regarding installing adobe flash player for ubuntu 14.04 I am using Ubuntu 14.04 .

Then run xinput list-props $id where $id is your touchpad id in the list.\nYou will have a list of options like this:\n$ xinput list-props 13\nDevice 'SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad':\n    Device Enabled (135):   1\n    Coordinate Transformation Matrix (137): 1.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 1.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 1.000000\n    Device Accel Profile (268): 1\n    Device Accel Constant Deceleration (269):   2.500000\n    Device Accel Adaptive Deceleration (270):   1.000000\n    Device Accel Velocity Scaling (271):    12.500000\n    Synaptics Edges (292):  1765, 5371, 1637, 4453\n    Synaptics Finger (293): 25, 30, 0\n    Synaptics Tap Time (294):   180\n    Synaptics Tap Move (295):   234\n    Synaptics Tap Durations (296):  180, 180, 100\n    Synaptics ClickPad (297):   1\n    [...]\n\nYou can change all of these on-the-fly with xinput set-prop $id $propId $value where $id is the device id, $propId is property id in brackets and $value is what you want it to be. For example:\nxinput set-prop 13 135 0 sets Device Enabled (135) to 0 and this will disable the touchpad.\nYou will need descriptions of properties and a way to make your changes permanent.\nDescriptions can be found in man synaptics, but wait, they are in another cryptic format! Let's see why.\nTo make changes permanent, you need to create conf file in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d, for example 30-tochpad.conf with contents like these:\n    Section \"InputClass\"  # you can read more in `man xorg`\n            Identifier \"all touchpads\"  # just a name for this config\n            MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"  # enables this config for all detected touchpads\n            Driver \"synaptics\"  # enables synaptics-specific options below\n\n            # This will disable the device\n            #Option \"Ignore\" \"1\"\n\n            # There are options that are generic for input-devices or mouse-like devices, see `man evdev`:\n            Option \"ButtonMapping\" \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"  # i disabled all buttons here, for example\n\n            # Here go options from `man synaptics`\n            Option \"VertTwoFingerScroll\" \"1\"\n            Option \"HorizTwoFingerScroll\" \"1\"\n            Option \"PalmDetect\" \"1\"\n            Option \"ClickPad\" \"0\"                \n            # ...etc...\n    EndSection\n\nSo, man synaptics describes options for xorg.conf and tells how they correspond to xinput list-props output.\nPS. I tried to configure trackpoint on my ThinkPad X220 to have only two-fingers-scroll enabled, without clicks or mouse movement. I failed. Maybe you will manage to do what you want (there was an option to disable everything but clicks, maybe Synaptics Off).\nSources, more examples and unicorns:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Input\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics\n\nA: Alternatively You could download the \"GnomeTweakTool\" and configure or deactivate it under Mouse&Keyboard > Click Emulation.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu 15 with Windows 8.1 How do I have to make the partitions with Ubuntu 15.0 thus I can choose from the Boot Sector when I turn on the pc.

Here is my problem: the Minecraft icon in the Unity launcher is inconsistent with the icon theme, even though the icon theme has a minecraft icon in it. The theme I am using is Numix-Circle and I am on Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS Unity. The way I even got Minecraft in the launcher was by installing Graham Edgecombe's minecraft-installer package. Here is a screenshot:\n\n\nA: I think, actually, this needs to be an answer. Tell me if I'm wrong.\nThe Minecraft icon has no circle and isn't flat because that's not the way the icon was made. The rest of the icons are part of the Numix set, which has specially made icons for most programs on Ubuntu. Not everything is going to conform with your theme, since the theme makers can't possibly make a special icon for every app out there.\nIf you really want it to conform with the rest of your icons, you're going to have to edit the icon manually, with GIMP or PhotoShop, to put a circle around it and flatten out the colors.\n", "Q: Google Chromium asks for keyring to unlock 14.04, but I don't want the password to be the same as my ubuntu login I don't want this prompt to use my default ubuntu login, I would like this to match the password I would use either on a chromebook, mac, or windows.

When I try to manually load the boot option corresponding to Ubuntu in the Bios boot menu, nothing happens (the screen blinks and returns me to the menu). The machine is a Dell Optiplex, and when I try to \"Add Boot Option\" I get a message saying \"File System Not Found!\". I've checked with a bootable Ubuntu USB that all my partitions do still exist and are accessible though.\nI've tried repairing the EFI partition with the boot-repair tool but no luck. I'm not sure what else I can do. Any ideas?\n\nA: Your installation is very strange:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your partition table is MBR, which almost always indicates a BIOS-mode boot. In the case of Windows, MBR requires a BIOS-mode boot.\n\n*You've got the Windows boot loader installed in the MBR.\n\n*Your first partition has a FAT filesystem and contains EFI boot loaders, apparently for both Linux and Windows (although the Windows files might actually be copies of GRUB created by Boot Repair). Note that EFI is not BIOS, so there's an inconsistency with the first two points.\n\n*Your first partition's type code is 0x83, which is normally used only by Linux. Its contents imply that it's an EFI System Partition (ESP), though. An MBR ESP should have a type code of 0xEF.\n\n*You have no obvious NTFS partitions, so if there's a Windows installation involved, it's not clear where it is. The presence of both BIOS and EFI Windows boot loaders is therefore puzzling, although perhaps explicable.\n\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say you had a Windows installation, but you installed Ubuntu over it, and that you either converted from a BIOS-mode boot to boot in EFI mode or you installed in EFI mode and then changed the partition table from GPT to MBR.\nFor recovery, my first advice is to proceed cautiously. Your installation is strange enough that you could easily make matters worse if you start making random changes. When you make changes, begin with changes you can easily undo. Part of proceeding cautiously is to use an emergency boot disc to back up any important personal data from your disk. A mistake or unidentified problem could easily result in actual data loss, so you should be prepared for that with a backup.\nOne cautious way to proceed is to try using the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager to see if it will boot your system. It should boot it, assuming the OS itself is in order. If rEFInd can boot your OS, then you can proceed to make adjustments to your partition table (described shortly). If not, then you should start investigating the possibility of filesystem corruption or accidentally-damaged files. Reporting the details of what shows up in the rEFInd menu, and what happens when you select each option, may be helpful in providing further advice in this case.\nIf rEFInd can boot Ubuntu, I'd start by changing the type code of /dev/sda1 from 0x83 to 0xEF. You can do this in fdisk by using the t option. You might then be able to get it to boot by adjusting items in your firmware, by re-installing GRUB (grub-install), or by installing rEFInd to your hard disk. It's at least as likely, though, that you'll need to convert your MBR disk to GPT form. You can do this with gdisk; see here for detailed instructions. This conversion is reversible, but not as easily as a change to the first partition's type code, so I'd start with that simple step first. After converting from MBR to GPT, you'll almost certainly have to setup or re-install GRUB or install rEFInd to your hard disk to get the system booting.\n", "Q: Building an OpenStack cloud: where do I install the maas and openstack packages? http://www.ubuntu.com/download/cloud/install-ubuntu-openstack\nThe instructions don't tell me where the packages need to be installed.

I want my windows operating system back. I want my computer to ask which operating system to open when the computer starts.\nI seriously need help.\n\nA: Try opening up the boot disk selector menu. As far as I am aware, most computers have an option to select which disk is used at boot, for example with Lenovo laptops, the onekey recovery button gives you an option for boot menu. If you see Ubuntu and your hard disk both, select the hard disk.\nDepending on how your BIOS works, you may need to re-enable secure boot in order to get Windows. Just keep in mind you'll have to shut it off for Linux. This means that you will have to manually switch bios configuration every time you switch.\nIf you're lucky enough to have the option, try asking the BIOS to do both UEFI and Bios modes. On my Lenovo g580 you can even specify which you want checked first. Again, you may have to use the BIOS boot menu, but at the very least you can boot.\nUEFI is a tricky subject for dual booting, and I still have yet to see reports of a decent one.\nGood luck, you may need it.\n\nA: If your Windows partition is still there (it probably is), SuperGrub2 will be able to find it and fix a GRUB option for Windows.\nAfter burning it and booting it, follow these instructions to detect all available OSs on your disk: http://www.supergrubdisk.org/wiki/SuperGRUB2Disk#Detect_any_OS\n\nA: I think you wiped out your entire disk during setup or somehow you need secure boot or windows boot loader to load windows 8. If you didn't, and/or if secure boot or windows boot loader isn't involved, then try installing GParted. If the partition is still there, then try looking into a volume.

Why Ubuntu dumping .deb packages and moving to .snap packages?\nAt least for now they are keeping .deb package for normal distributions. .deb is already the most popular packaging format out there.\nThis gives an idea about what the Snap package format is. But what will happen to the existing deb packages? Is there any clear advantage on moving to Snap? Is it worth the pain?\n\nA: Snappy Personal, their new approach to package management/updating that's designed to be faster, more reliable, transactional, and with stronger security. \nSnappy for at least one of their desktop spins -- the plan is to switch Ubuntu's Desktop-Next spin from .deb over to Snappy Personal. \n.deb will still there and a normal user can still use it regularly by the time converting the .deb to snappy.\nSnappy will be used to unify the concept of package management among the ioT which is using snappy now as its core Os. moreover snappy provide a better way in updating and get rid of problem while update/upgrade since it use the concept of whole image which means the update will be just one piece and therefore no means of fail\nRead those articles for more info:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2015/04/ubuntu-desktop-to-eventually-switch-to.html\nhttp://www.itworld.com/article/2914850/linux/is-ubuntu-moving-away-from-deb-packages-here-is-the-complete-story.html\nThere is also a QA video from ubuntu on air that answers a great many questions\nhttps://youtu.be/lHO8j8uo5Z4\n\nA: It's just simple. Snappy package contains all the required files, where .deb packages have dependencies to other packages.\nThe negative side is that snappy is bigger because it contains all the files. But the big advantage is that you don't get in trouble with other packages and if you remove this package, no other package will be affected by missing dependencies.\n\nA: Consider moving to snappy Ubuntu Core today if you are thinking of creating something for others to use, in other words, a product.\nThe software is delivered in snaps, which given its traits, we can have confidence that installation and upgrades will work on every system as the original creator intended. Other traits are security, such as isolated execution and clean interfaces to talk to the system and configure the installed snaps.\nTo achieve such a thing, snaps differ a lot from are much different than a debian package:\n\n\n*\n\n*snaps live in an isolated system determined location while debian packages\ncan spread files all over the place.\n\n*there are no maintainer scripts for snaps.\n\n\nGoing back to the original question of to use or not to use, if you plan to replace your desktop with Ubuntu Core I suggest you stick with regular Ubuntu desktop. Ubuntu Core, I personally like to call, the nothing distro, because alone it is nothing, but provides a very good building block to offer something and this is why it is popular in IoT these days.\n\nA: Snap attempts to solve one of the fundamental problems with Linux as a desktop operating system: software availability and software distribution. Snap is not intended to completely replace debs, however. Snaps and Debs work alongside each other.\nI am a Linux enthusiast and a project manager of a Linux application. While I love Linux systems as a whole, I can't stand the current state of package distribution. Universal App Formats like Snaps aim to solve this fundamental problem.\nIn Linux, packages are specifically built for a single version of a single distribution. With a lot of tweaking, it is possible to make one .deb package that runs on all Debian based systems, but this is complicated and limits developers. It's also not practical at times due to version locking of dependencies.\nIf I create a deb package for Ubuntu 20.04, it will only work on that version. I also have to make a different package for 16.04, 18.04, 20.10 and so on. I already have to make four packages just for Ubuntu. I also need to make one for every Debian version, every Fedora version and every openSUSE version. RPM is more flexible in this regard but the locked dependency issue still gets in the way.\nThis means if I want to release a new version of my application, I have to create over 20 packages to cover the majority of Linux distributions, and that still won't cover every distro. A second possibility is to wait for distribution maintainers to add your package to the distribution but this usually takes an absurd amount of time. Moreover, then the distribution maintainers decide which version their users get instead of the software developer.\nWith Snap, a single package runs on every version of every distribution that supports snap. See Installing snapd for a list of many distros that support it.\nAdditionally, with Snap, the developer publishes and maintains the package, instead of the distribution maintainer. So I as a developer can release new a version to all my users without having to wait on anyone else.\nEssentially, everything I hate about traditional Linux package distribution is trying to be solved by Snaps. Though it's important to note that these core issues are also trying to be solved by Flatpaks & to a degree by AppImages. The discussion for which format is better is highly debated and a much longer conversation than makes sense for this reply. For now, I will say that I am fine with running any of the universal formats since they all work differently and thus do not conflict with each other making it possible to run all 3 and traditional packages at the same time. If I had to choose, I'd probably go Flatpak as they seem to be more universal with feature compatibility.\nTL;DR\nLinux package distribution is awful for both developers and users. Snaps,  Flatpaks & AppImages are intended to solve this fundamental problem with Linux based systems.\n\nThis question is really about why the move but if anyone is interested in learning more about what Snaps are and how they work.

We are using HP ENVY 17 Laptops with the HDMI port running an external monitor. \nSince upgrading to 3.13.0-51 all of the machines no longer detect the HDMI port, and hence the external monitor is no longer displaying anything.\nThe machines have on-board Intel graphics and also GeForce GT 740M discreet graphics cards.\nOne of my colleagues has tried to install NVIDIA drivers and he could no longer boot into Unity.\nIs there anything else we could try, or should we roll back to 3.13.0-49 ?\nUPDATE\nTried installing 3.13.0-52-generic and the problem remains.\n\nA: Hate to report that we've solved the problem by removing the HDMI cable, fully shutting down the computers (we'd only been 'restarting' before) and replacing the HDMI cable once booted up and logged in.\nNow we can restart without removing the cable and it works fine.\n", "Q: 14.04: Unlocking the screen after sleep logs user off and back on This happened to me just now.

I think what happened is that after the first password my user was logged off instantly, because after typing my password again I am logged in to my user in a new session.\nAre there any logs I can provide to explain this?\n\nA: I couldn't find a bug for this - astoundingly - so I've submitted one.

Part of this process, I installed Nvidia drivers from the Ubuntu Software Center. Everything went ok and I never thought anything about it until recently when I've noticed that I wasn't receiving kernel updates when running apt-get dist-upgrade.\nAfter carrying out some investigation it seemed that I didn't have the linux-generic meta package installed. When I looked into the logs to see when it was removed, it was removed when the Nvidia drivers were installed.\nStart-Date: 2014-09-21  11:56:30\nCommandline: aptdaemon role='role-commit-packages' sender=':1.63'\nInstall: fakeroot:amd64 (1.20-3ubuntu2, automatic), screen-resolution-\nextra:amd64 (0.17.1, automatic), lib32gcc1:amd64 (4.9.1-0ubuntu1, \nautomatic), dkms:amd64 (2.2.0.3-1.1ubuntu5, automatic), \nlibcuda1-331:amd64 (331.38-0ubuntu7.1, automatic), nvidia-settings:amd64 \n(331.20-0ubuntu8, automatic), nvidia-331:amd64 (331.38-0ubuntu7.1), \nnvidia-libopencl1-331:amd64 (331.38-0ubuntu7.1, automatic), bbswitch-\ndkms:amd64 (0.7-2ubuntu1, automatic), nvidia-opencl-icd-331:amd64 \n(331.38-0ubuntu7.1, automatic), libfakeroot:amd64 (1.20-3ubuntu2, \nautomatic), nvidia-prime:amd64 (0.6.2, automatic), libc6-i386:amd64 \n(2.19-0ubuntu6.3, automatic), libvdpau1:amd64 (0.7-1, automatic)\nRemove: linux-generic:amd64 (3.13.0.35.42)\nEnd-Date: 2014-09-21  11:57:24\n\nOn my work's computer with an almost identical setup the same thing occurred. I was missing the linux-generic package as it was uninstalled when the Nvidia drivers were installed and I couldn't update the kernal. The only difference regarding installing the drivers between the two was on my work's machine I installed the drivers manually through apt.\nIs it normal for this package to be removed when installing Nvidia drivers and can I simply install it again or will it have any negative side effects? \nRegards, Ian\n\nA: That's probably just an older version of linux-generic that was updated then. The newest version is 3.13.0.51.58 and the one that was uninstalled was 3.13.0.35.42.\nRun the following commands in an open terminal:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic\n\nIt will probably say something like \"newest version is already installed\". If not, you will see a list of what will install and what will uninstall if you install the package. Review this list before accepting the changes.\n\nALSO\nYou can always check to see what is installed by running the following command:\ndpkg -l | grep linux-image\n\nor\ndpkg -l | grep generic\n\nand so on.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04, Asus Flipbook TP500LN No Internet and touchpad did use NDISwrapper So I installed Ubunutu 15.04 on my Asus Flipbook TP500LN, but I don't have acces to wi-fi (ethernet does work).

I will accept any of those solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*redirect the notifications to Unity\n\n*move them in an other angle of my screen\n\n*move to an other monitor (I'm using Chrome on the secondary monitor)\n\n\nAlso...\nI also found this on Chromium FAQs:\n\nQ. Why don't Chromium notifications use the D-BUS-based notifications\n  system (aka libnotify / notification-daemon)?\nA1. HTML5 notifications can contain arbitrary HTML, which is not\n  supported by the notification protocol.  (This is the same reason we\n  don't use Growl on OS X.)\nA2. Chromium's notifications include a button that brings up an\n  options menu, which is also not supported by the notification\n  protocol.\nA3. The glitzy Ubuntu notifications daemon, by design, does not allow\n  the user to interact with notifications at all, which doesn't work\n  when the notification HTML includes clickable links.\nA4. It would be nice to extend the protocol to allow Chromium to\n  integrate.  Any takers?\n\n\nA: So here's the problem. Like you mentioned, NPAPI is on its way out and Webkit applications are going to make heavy use of their own in-built notification system instead of respecting the one provided by a desktop environment [1]. Unless someone comes up with a way with intercepting the notification requests for the browser and have it to speak at a local daemon that can in turn speak with notify-osd; we're out of luck.\nExpanding on this, KDE allows for button manipulation in its notification service whereas Ubuntu does not. If they've unified this one action as a generic feature, it might be even more feasible to implement the above. But alas.\n[1]: More likely, they want to make it as rich as possible but without worrying too much about cross platform support.\n\nA: Have you tried this?\nStep 1: install patched libnotify\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:leolik/leolik \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install libnotify-bin\npkill notify-osd\n\nStep2: Install config utility\n\n\n*\n\n*32-bit version\n\n*64-bit version\n\nA: Rather than waiting for Chrome to move to system notifications, I decided a temporary hack was in order.  This looks for the popop and moves it. I run it\nonce a minute from cron.  This is, of course, *nix only.\nhttps://github.com/tonyaiuto/settings/tree/master/move_chrome_notify\nThe basic idea is\n- enumerate all children of the root window (xwininfo)\n- look for the one at a specific position from the bottom right corner\n- move (and resize) it with xdotool\nYMMV: The default X position to move to is almost certainly wrong for everyone but me.\n", "Q: Invoicing Visual Basic software replacement or web application? I have a pc that is still fairly powerful but with Windows XP (Pentium 4 3Ghz 4 Gb Ram). \nIt is used by someone who is not computer expert (I would say a really basic user) only for browsing and printing invoices.\nThe invoicing software is something that I developed like 10 years ago in Visual Basic, it is simple and functional and still running well.\nThis VB software is only the reason why I still keep XP in this computer, I would like to get rid of it and switch to Ubuntu latest release.\nFrom what I have read here, the solutions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use & configure Wine with a default printer.\n\n*Rewrite the software with Gambas.\n\n*Rewrite the VB software as a PHP/MySql web application and use Firefox or Chromium for printing to a default printer.\n\n\nNow I never used Wine or Gambas, but I can easily creare the web application.\nI am kind of afraid that with the first 2 solutions I will have to spend a lot of time in configuration, test and acquire knowledge that I don't have. Also I read about many people having troubles with printers in Wine and Gambas.\nAnd with the 3rd solution I am afraid that it will turn out to be not much professional/slow/problematic because it needs a working internet connection and everything will be online.\nWhat do you think it will be the best approach?\n\nA: I don't know if you resolve this issue, a application web is the best solution, you don't need internet connection. You can develop a web application and put on the web server using LAMP or LEMP server of local way. Also, if you develop a application with Gambas you don't need Wine, this is need only if you try run de VB app in Linux.\n", "Q: Ubuntu cannot log in My Ubuntu only allowed guest login to desktop.Once I login to System as user ,It jump to login interface again and very quick \nplease i need a simple answer with a simple langauge  \n\nA: Ok.

How should I behave in this situation? Should I upgrade the kernel manually?\nUPDATE\nThanks to @Oli I finally solved my issue that confused me for a long time. In point release 2 of 14.04 LTS to check the current available HWE kernel:\napt-cache policy linux-generic-lts-utopic\n\nit'll relpy e.g.:\nlinux-generic-lts-utopic:\n  Installed: 3.16.0.37.29\n  Candidate: 3.16.0.37.29\n   Version table:\n *** 3.16.0.37.29 0\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty-updates/main i386 Packages\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty-security/main i386 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\nIf it has newer candidate you can upgrade it using the commands in the answer below. \n\nA: LTS \"point releases\" often ship the latest hardware enablement stack. These are the Kernel, X server and graphics driver versions from the latest non-LTS, backported to the LTS. This allows people to keep using the same old software, supported for a long time, but with modern hardware support (and performance boosts from newer drivers/kernel/etc).\nBut these improvements aren't automatic. 14.04 users have to opt-in with something like:\nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-lts-utopic xserver-xorg-lts-utopic libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-utopic libegl1-mesa-drivers-lts-utopic\n\nThese meta-packages either install packages alongside (ie kernels) or replace older versions with provides metadata, in a way that stock 14.04 wouldn't auto-upgrade to. This is why linux-image-generic still points to the stock [but maintained] 14.04 Kernel version.\nGetting back to your question, to get the latest version —and keep getting regular updates— you need to install the latest HWE meta-package. These are keyed to the release they represent so there isn't a nice automated way of achieving this; you have to rub some brain cells together. Currently the latest is Utopic (Vivid should be here soonish) so for now, you can just run:\nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-lts-utopic\n\nThough I'd probably recommend taking X and your graphics drivers along for the ride too.\n", "Q: Cannot auto-start LXC containers created with LXD I have created a lxc container easily with LXD tools however I couldn't find a way to auto-start it on reboot. (Ubuntu 15.04)\nFor LXC it's said that adding lxc.start.auto = 1 to the container config would be enough however I couldn't find the config file for the container created with LXD. I tried\nlxc config set my_machine raw.lxc \"lxc.start.auto=1\"\n\nwithout any luck. The configuration is saved but the container didn't start... Any ideas?\n\nA: It's a few months later now, and autostart is (for some time now) supported in lxd itself.  You can just\nlxc init ubuntu u1\nlxc config set u1 boot.autostart true\n\nNow u1 will autostart on each reboot.\n\nA: Based on the official documentation here LXC container startup was designed using upstart. As of March 9, 2015 Ubuntu 15.04 changed to systemd by default. More detail regarding the impact of this change  and how to switch from systemd to upstart and back again is available on this page.\nTo check to see if your system is using systemd vs. upstart you can test by issuing the command sudo initctl version which will return upstart if upstart is handling init. another useful method is to issue the command dpkg -S /sbin/init which will tell you which package installed it (in my case on 14.04 it's upstart) you you can find more very good answers on how to do so from our friends at Unix & Linux. Further detail regarding identifying the init system is also available.\nTo see if your LXC container auto-starts under upstart as designed, you can install the upstart-sysv package, which will remove ubuntu-standard and systemd-sysv (but should not remove anything else. Give the developers a heads up if it does!), and run sudo update-initramfs -u. After that, grub's \"Advanced options\" menu will have a corresponding \"Ubuntu, with Linux ... (systemd)\" entry where you can do an one-time boot with systemd. \nYou can revert back to systemd installing systemd-sysv and ubuntu-standard packages.\nFurther sources (not linked elsewhere):\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/196166/how-to-find-out-if-a-system-uses-sysv-upstart-or-systemd-initsystem\n\nA: I asked the lxc/lxd developers themselves and it appears that it's not possible to do it with configuration if lxd is used to create the containers. It's not implemented yet, but planned they say...\nlxd is somewhat different from lxc scripts: i.e. the default directory for the containers is /var/lib/lxd/lxc/ instead of /var/lib/lxc/ and the container configurations are held in a central sqlite db instead of some config file per container.\nSo I had to create a systemd job by creating the file: /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/lxd-autostart.service with this content:\n[Unit]\nDescription=Start lxc containers created with lxd\nAfter=lxd.service\nRequires=lxd.service\n\n[Service]\nExecStartPre=/usr/local/bin/lxd-autostart-check.sh\nExecStart=/usr/bin/lxc start my_machine\nRestart=on-failure\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nand /usr/local/bin/lxd-autostart-check.sh is:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor i in {1..10}\ndo\n    echo \".\"\n    [ -S /var/lib/lxd/unix.socket ] && exit 0\n    sleep 1\ndone\n\necho \"/var/lib/lxd/unix.socket not detected!\"\nexit 1\n\n", "Q: Problem with serial port I am unable to access the serial port on my PC with Ubuntu 12.04.\nThe command:\ndmesg | grep ttyS\n\nOutputs: \n[    0.590705] 00:08: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A\n\nI think serial port is not getting detected.\nCan anyone please help me in solving the problem?\n\nA: \n[    0.590705] 00:08: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A\n\n\nThe line above tell us that the kernel detected a 16550 UART chip in your PC, which provides a serial port (ttyS0), and there's some resources allocated to it (0x3f8 I/O address, IRQ 4).\nThe default permissions for serial devices are the following:\ncrw-rw---- 1 root dialout ... /dev/ttyS0\n\nSo, if you are a member of the dialout group, you'll be able to access (read from/write to) the serial port devices. Add yourself to the dialout group by running:\nsudo adduser $USER dialout\n\nOr:\nsudo adduser <username> dialout\n\nThen log out and log in again. Now you should have access to the serial port. Of course, you must also input the correct settings (speed, data bits, parity, stop bits, flow control) in the program you're using to access the device.\n", "Q: Is Intel accessing my machine without permission through mei_mei module?

I encourage you to read it.\nFrom what I understand, AMT must be enable in the BIOS/EFI (using CTRL-P to access the config page). It is only in that case that your PC is reachable via AMT.\nIf AMT is enabled, you can disable it in the BIOS/EFI. If it is and using SMB (or password scheme), there is a default password of admin.

I would like to create one user for that and set nologin to that user. When logging on using an FTP client, I want that particular user to be able to see the entire system directory. \nHow do I restrict one user like that to one directory (E.g. /usr/local/example)?\n\nA: For vsftpd (“Very Secure File Transfer Protocol Daemon”), the configuration is exceedingly simple:\nsudo apt-get install vsftpd\n\nthen:\nsudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf\n\nensure you have the following parameters set right:\n# Depending on the version you're running, you might want to set the following \n# parameter to YES \n# (if affected by https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vsftpd/+bug/1313450)\nlisten=YES\n# to allow local users to log on:\nlocal_enable=YES\n#if you want write access too:\nwrite_enable=YES\n# Set anonymous user directory to /srv/ftp (no default)\nanon_root=/srv/ftp\n# Uncomment this to allow the anonymous FTP user to upload files. This only\n# has an effect if the above global write enable is activated. Also, you will\n# obviously need to create a directory writable by the FTP user.\n#anon_upload_enable=YES\n#\n# Uncomment this if you want the anonymous FTP user to be able to create\n# new directories.\n#anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES\n\n# following for debugging purposes (to ensure you're on the right server)\nftpd_banner=Welcome to Aravind's FTP service.\n\n# Now restrict users to their home directories:\nchroot_local_user=YES\nallow_writeable_chroot=YES\n\nAnd now, if you want to set a particular user to a particular directory, just create a user with a particular directory:\nsudo adduser ftpuser --home /usr/local/example\n\nTo test:\nGo to a terminal on the machine running vsftpd and type: ftp 127.0.0.1 and if you're greeted by your own banner, vsftpd works!\nThen test on the same machine to its public address: ftp 1.2.3.4 and finally from a remote machine to the public address.  If something goes wrong with the public addresses, check your firewall settings.\nAdditional notes:\nIf you don't want the user to log on, add the --shell /bin/false parameter to the adduser command.\nYou might also want to delete all the directories/files (Desktop, Pictures, ... that the adduser created if you don't want them there...\nDone!\n\nA: Is there a reason you need to use that specific FTP server software? What you're looking for is mostly called \"chroot\" (change the root directory per user) or something similar. According to this bug report the netkit ftp server, that's contained in the linux-ftpd package, doesn't offer that feature. Event the launchpad page says\n\nThis is the netkit ftp server. It is recommended for you to use one of its\n   alternatives, such as wu-ftpd or proftpd.\n\nI know from experience that pure-ftpd (setting VIRTUALCHROOT) and ProFTPd (by virtual hosts) offer the feature you're looking for. Both are available from the standard Ubuntu repositories. Other ftp server software probably offers similar features.\n", "Q: disabling usb and dvd rom in ubuntu 14.04 I need to disable CD/DVD ROM and USB ports for desktop on which 14.04 Ubuntu is installed.Tried updating in  modprobe.conf but no luck.Please tell me if any other alternativies.\n\nA: *\n\n*edit this file blacklist.conf :\nfrom Terminal :\nsudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nfrom GUI:\npress Alt+F2 then use the command\ngksu gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\n\n*Add now the following two lines:\n# Block access to USB  \nblacklist usb_storage\n\n\n*Save the file and close it, then restart your system.

Noticed a spike in disk usage.\nTurns out the culprit is lastlog. Overwrote it with >/var/log/lastlog.\nAfter logging out of the session and logging back in, lastlog increases in size again:\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 root utmp 4.2G May  5 06:32 /var/log/lastlog\n\nIs this something known? How can I stop lastlog from using up so much space?\nThank you!\n\nA: /var/log/lastlog is a sparse file meaning its real size is not reported by ls -l but by ls -s. This means that your lastlog might not be as huge as you think:\nTry:\nls -s /var/log/lastlog\n\nto get a report of its size in blocks.\nThe sudden growth of /var/log/lastlog means a high UID user as logged out. Look at lastlog man page\nEdit - To fix it:\nYou can found out the last logged out user by using lastlog command.\nAnd  after making sure the user is not logged in with w command, change its UID. See how in \"How to change user gid and uid\"\nThen clear /var/log/lastlog like you already did with \n> /var/log/lastlog\n\nNote: Using an uid of 6565666, I only got 1.8G for /var/log/lastlog. So your user must have an uid higher than 26262664 ???\n\nA: As already explained in the accepted answer, this is a sparse file which is not really as big as it seems.\nHowever, this can be a problem with backups where the backup file actually will be that big. So for others landing here as I did because the backups are getting too large:\nIf doing backups of /var/log, do them with rsync and use its --sparse (or -S) option.\nFrom man rsync :\n\n-S, --sparse\nTry to handle sparse files efficiently so they take up less space on the destination.\nIf combined with --inplace the file created might not end up with sparse blocks with some combinations of kernel version and/or filesystem type. If --whole-file is in effect (e.g. for a local copy) then it will always work because rsync truncates the file prior to writing out the updated version.\nNote that versions of rsync older than 3.1.3 will reject the combination of --sparse and --inplace.\n\n", "Q: Clickable file that adds code in terminal and runs it automatically? As my wi-fi driver is doing a bit weird I need to add codes into the terminal everytime I restart my PC to use Wi-Fi.\nI get that opening the terminal and typing in two lines of code isn't that much work, but I was kind of curious if there was a way to just be able to click on a file, and that the file would paste the codes in the terminal and run them automatically.\nEDIT :\nThe codes: \nsudo modprobe mt7630e\nsudo modprobe mt76xx\n\n\nA: From the commands you have provided, it is clear that you are trying to load two modules into the kernel in the runtime after just starting your computer.\nThis can be done easily by the /etc/modules file. This file is the designated place to put the modules that will be loaded into the kernel upon system boot every time.\nIn your case, to load the mentioned two modules use the following command:\nprintf \"mt7630e\\nmt76xx\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules\n\n", "Q: TSC unstable switching to hpet Current clocksource is hpet, which simply does not work with the applications I am trying to run and acpi_pm gives the same errors.

Also, the cracking only happen in 1 speaker (right side near the audio outlet)\nMy laptop is dell xps L502x\nDoes anyone knows how to fix it?\n\nA: This sounds like an ubuntu \"issue\".\nThat said, it sounds more like Windows8 just has a workaround for this, because it is common in all audio hardware. When you unplug audio hardware, the current flows through whatever touches the contacts. Since the plug is moving, different poles contact different contacts and cause the popping sound. It's not a hardware defect, it just looks like Windows has a way of detecting when you unplug hardware quicker, so it can mute that effect. In Ubuntu it does the mute effect, but not in time to stop the cracking in that one channel.\n", "Q: How move the biggest file in each subdirectory to current directory?

Change your find to:\nfind \"$d\" -type f -exec ls -al {} \\; | sort -nr -k5 | head -n 1\n\nHowever, a safer way would be:\n#!/bin/bash\nfor d in */ ; do\n    file=$(find \"$d\" -type f -printf \"%s\\t%f\\n\" | sort -n | tail -n 1 | cut -f 2- )\n    echo \"$file\"\n    mv \"$d${file}\" .\ndone\n\nWhile this will still break if your file names contain newlines, at least it will work with file names containing spaces. \n\nIf your files can also contain newlines, you can try this instead:\n#!/bin/bash\nfor d in */ ; do\n    max=0\n    file=\"\"\n    for f in \"$d\"/*\n    do\n        ## If this is a file and its size is greater than the max so far,\n        ## save it as \"$file\" and uts size as \"$max\".\n        [[ -f \"$f\" ]] && [[ $(stat -c \"%s\" \"$f\") -gt $max ]] && max=\"$size\" && file=\"$f\"\n    done\n    ## move the largest file.

How do I answer a call on the Ubuntu phone? I have tried pressing the answer button (green) and swiping across the screen, and nothing happens. \nIt is like the touch screen is inactive. The phone otherwise works normally as I can make outgoing calls and receive texts etc. I just cannot seem to answer incoming calls!\n\nA: Roger, it sounds like you know how to answer the call but it's not working for you. This happened me a few times before the update. I'd get a call and be swiping like a mad man but nothing happened... touch screen would work with everything else just not answering calls. This ended when I got the most recent update, maybe this could help you?\n\nA: you can answer an incoming call by wiping the \"button\" (the grey rectangle with \"< >\" on it) to the right side. Or decline the call by wiping the rectangle in the other direction towards the red icon.\nAnswers this your question?\nBest wishes,\nMatthias    \n\n\nA: When you receive a call and want to take it, the standard way is to move the white “button\" with the 2 arrows from its middle position towards the green phone. If you want to close it, you move it towards the red phone.\n", "Q: MAAS can't download boot images On my MAAS Gui and \"Images\" I've got these errors\nBoot image import process not started. Nodes will not be able to provision without boot images. Visit the boot images page to start the import.\nFailed to import images from boot source \nhttp://maas.ubuntu.com/images/ephemeral-v2/releases/: \nHTTPConnectionPool(host='maas.ubuntu.com', port=80): \nMax retries exceeded with url:\n/images/ephemeral-v2/releases/streams/v1/index.sjson \n(Caused by : [Errno 110] Connection timed out)\n\nand \n    Error: No boot sources provide Ubuntu images.\nSo I tried to do lot of commands.\nI did:\nmaas root node-groups import-boot-images\nnothing appended.\nand:\nmaas root boot-resources import\nnothing appended.\nand:\nmaas-import-pxe-files --sources-file ****\nbut I don't know which sources file used.\nI tried everything and I don't get any images, same goes for the web ui.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The import operating is dependent on the version of MAAS that you are using. I would recommend using version 1.7 or higher. In version 1.7 starting the images import can be done on the images page or using the API.\nmaas root boot-resources import\n\nThe error you are seeing is because MAAS is unable to reach maas.ubuntu.com to download the images. Check your upstream network connectivity on the MAAS server to make sure it can access that location. The /var/log/maas/regiond.log will also contain more information on this error and could be helpful in diagnosing the issue you are experiencing.\n\nA: I have also experienced this error and like you, tried all possible solutions. Turned out that it was much simpler than I had imagined. Going trough /var/log/maas/regiond.log just after typing the command \nmaas <user> boot-resources import\n\nGave me this error:\n\nkey 476CF100 was created 152222276 seconds in the future (time warp or clock problem)\\n gpg: Can't check signature: timestamp conflict\\n\")\n\nSince this many seconds ammount to 4.8 years, I decided to check my system time with timedatectl: \nLocal time: Tue 2008-01-01 02:27:44 BRST\n\nAfter rebooting the machine and correctly configuring the date settings in the BIOS, I got:\nLocal time: Tue 2016-04-05 16:01:50 BRT\n\nNow everything works fine.\n\nA: If you have enabled firewall, your firewall is blocking port 8000 which is used by MAAS proxy to download images. MAAS docs for version 2.9 say:\n\nInternal proxy (MAAS proxy)\nMAAS provides an internal proxy server. Although it is set up to work well with APT/package requests, it is effectively an HTTP caching proxy server. If you configure the MAAS region controller as the default gateway for the machines it manages then the proxy will work transparently (on TCP port 3128). Otherwise, machines will need to access it on TCP port 8000.\n\n", "Q: How can I remove Ubuntu and reinstall a fresh Ubuntu 15.04 to my computer? I don't really know what I'm doing, and don't want to get this wrong. \nI've made a backup of everything I want to keep on an external hard drive, and wish to do a clean install of Ubuntu 15.04 from a completely ghosted system. I do not have a partition, I only have the Ubuntu OS. \nDoes anyone have any information regarding what I must do? \nI have no problem removing everything off my computer and restarting from scratch. I cannot update to newer kernels due to various issues and I am having a few other problems with my computer that I would rather just reinstall instead of fix. Thanks.\n\nA: If Ubuntu is going to be the only OS on your machine, then you're kind of ready already.\nDownload the correct version of the 15.04 installation .iso file from the Ubuntu downloads page, bearing in mind whether you have a 64bit or 32bit machine. The installer will need to be burnt onto a dvd, or a bootable usb (slightly trickier, but by no means difficult).\nYou will need to make your BIOS boot from the installation DVD, right at the beginning of your boot process, you'll need to press something like Del to choose your boot media, though this info will flash on screen quickly. \nWhen installing, choose the option to install Ubuntu as your main OS, this will remove any other OS. If you have a particular partition setup in mind, select manual partitioning when you reach that option, but the automatic partitioning works well for most users.\nJust remember, so long as you have your files backed up, you can always start again with the installation process so be brave!

It seems to be a known Unity bug related to 'Window Spread' setting:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/1462841?comments=all\nThe workaround is to disable 'Windows Spread' (thus losing that feature until the bug is fixed). Lame, but at the moment I'm not aware of anything better.\n\nA: I had the same issue. Uninstalling unity-tweak-tool removed the problem.\nsudo apt-get purge unity-tweak-tool\n\n", "Q: How to make an application use local shared library instead of the system one I have qtcreator installed using the qt online installer. It ships which its own version of qt library. The qt library are also installed in the system directories, but those are older.\nI have problems with qtcreator (see qt-forums). Suspecting this might be because Qt is using the old system libraries, I ran qt using\nstrace -e open qtcreator.sh\n\nand indeed, it uses the libraries in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qtcreator/\nTo load the correct libaries, the qrcreator.sh script sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH to\n/home/<me>/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/lib:/home/<me>/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/lib/qtcreator\n\nthis is correct, but still, the libraries from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qtcreator are used.\nHow can I tell qtcreator to use the local libraries despite the existence of the system wide libraries?\n\nA: One can preload libraries using the \"LD_PRELOAD\" environment variable. Simply specify the full path of the so files like this:\nexport LD_PRELOAD = \"/path/to/so1.so /path/to/so2.so\"\n\n\nA: To Nathan's option, I would add patchelf which allows to change the RPATH of an executable. I personally prefer patching RPATH over defining LD_LIBRARY_PATH and the like, since Ubuntu has issue defining these in profile and also as if not defining this in profile, this save the need of a wrapper script.\nTo define an executable RPATH which is relative to the application's directory (if you wish to, that's not mandatory to do so), you have to use $ORIGIN taking care to escape the $ which must appears literally (so use \\$ORIGIN if you invoke patchelf from a shell). Ex. if the application belongs a bin directory and the libraries belongs to a peer lib directory, you will use $ORIGIN/../lib for the RPATH.\nYou may as well use an absolute RPATH if you prefer.\nSee Patchelf (nixos.org).\n", "Q: How can one boot to a second hard drive where Ubuntu is installed I have installed a dual boot (windows 7 Ubuntu 14.04) on my HP Pavilion p7-1155 desktop.  Windows resides on the first hard drive (SATA0) and Ubuntu resides on a second hard drive (SATA1). Everything seems to work fine except that I would like to boot from the second hard drive.  It seems however, from the research that I have done, HP desktops are not able to boot from the second hard drive. It is possible to boot from a second drive on a one off basis, but not on a permanent basis.  The BIOS permits you to set the boot drive as SATA1 and the system boots accordingly, however the next time the desktop is booted the BIOS reverts to booting from SATA0.   Is there a way to get around this limitation? \nEDIT from comments:  My BIOS is CAR_714.ROM v7.14\nWould something as simple as physically swapping the drive cables on the motherboard work.  I am reluctant to do it as I don't want to crash my system, because of my lack of technical knowledge.\nThanks in advance.  \n\nA: Navigate through your system BIOS to set boot order to boot from your second drive. How to do this exactly depends on what version of the BIOS you are using. Details on how to navigate the BIOS are provided by your manufacturer here. Based on the information provided if you have version 6 or less look under the boot tab and if it's 7 or greater look under the storage tab. You should find boot options there. Pay close attention to the details provided by the manufacturer on how to make a choice and save it.\nGRUB2 will boot off of any available drive. As long as the OS's in question and GRUB are installed and configured properly, GRUB will boot any OS configured from any drive it's on. There's no need for swapping cables or changing BIOS settings.\nYou can use Grub Customizer to set default OS to boot, as well as other fun customizations. Grub Customizer is available via Daniel Richters' PPA here. Simply choose your release from the list and filter the results. Opening the source drop down (as shown) will open up the list of available source and pre-compiled packages. \n\n\nA: Your computer's bios will boot into whatever drive is on top of the priority list, put the drive you wish to boot from on top of the priority list.

I have a Dell m3800 developer edition pre-installed with Ubuntu. I'm currently running 14.10. I am wondering if it is possible to triple boot Windows 10 and OS X Mavericks onto the computer?\nFurthermore how would I go about downloading them and installing whilst making sure that grub isn't affected. Also I do not have any Ubuntu CD or install media\n\nA: You could only do this, to my knowledge, if you had bought a Mac with OS X already on it or obtained a copy of the OS illegally as I am pretty sure Apple has copyright laws against purchasing the OS off of the machine. Someone please correct me if I am mistaking about this.\nHowever yes, if you get a copy of any of these OSes and create either a bootable CD or USB, create a separate hard drive partition for each it should be possible for you to triple boot your computer. There are videos on how to do this if you do a quick youtube search though it sounded like your question was more trying to figure out if triple booting is possible and the answer is yes as long as you have enough space to partition. Just search for dual boot instead of triple boot cause that is what all the tutorials seem to do but it will be the same idea when you get to dual booting.\nLike I said, Apple doesn't sell their OS outside of their machines so unless you download it illegally you can't download it but Windows does sell them. In fact, Windows 10 is still in development so that is free at the moment and available for download here http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso \n\nA: It is possible to install Windows, and that should be pretty easy, but your computer isn't compatible with Mac OS. I checked online and the only result I found for your computer was one saying it only boots into Safe Mode, which obviously isn't helpful. For Windows, though, get the Windows 10 Technical Preview ISO from Saige's link and burn it to a CD or a USB drive using UNetBootin. When you install WIndows, GRUB will break, but you should be able to get it as default again by using an Ubuntu LiveCD to chroot to your Ubuntu drive and reconfigure GRUB. You could also just use boot-repair which is provided as an ISO on the Ubuntu website. This should automate the process and get Ubuntu working as the default again.\n\nA: There will be no problem with GRUB being overwritten by any other bootloader when you install all operating systems in UEFI mode, which is the default since computers ship with Windows 8. Just install every operating system as intended.\nos-prober should be able to detect and include Windows and Mac OS in GRUB's menu, the answer to this question may be helpful: GRUB does not detect Windows\nFurther more downloading and installing Mac OS on a non-Mac systems looks very off-topic for this site to me and the same goes for instructions specific to a preview version of Windows that won't be available any more in a few weeks or months.\n", "Q: How to download and install fqrx-amcccle to Ubuntu 15.04?

I'm running 14.04 Server with a ~16 GB SSD and ran out of room.  I was able to clean up and get some free space but Thunderbird was using 1.7 GB in my home directory in .thunderbird.  I've uninstalled Thunderbird since it wasn't essential and ran various apt-get commands to clean up but the directory is still there.  Is it safe to just delete .thunderbird?\n\nA: Yes. If you have uninstalled it you can remove the preferences file.\nAll archived mail will be removed. As will all emails if you had a pop account. I assume that is what you want.\n\nA: Most of the 1,7 GB will be emails and their corresponding attachments. Since you uninstalled it, one may assume you do not need the emails/passwords, attachments etc. anymore. If that is the case, yes, it is save to remove.\nHowever\nBe aware that emails you have in a POP account will possibly be lost.

From what i understood, update-grub tries to dynamically find all the possible partitions and operating systems in them for generating the most complete grub.conf file. one of the options(one of the last ones actually) that update-grub tries for mounting an unknown partition, is ufs. This is a bug however as it could be misleading and confuse the user.\nMore info: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1374759\n\nA: I got this error and I fixed it updating to kernel 3.19.0-26. I think it was some bug in 3.19.0-25.\n\nA: This is a bit \"me too\" but I saw this during a different kernel upgrade to 4.2 (most recent at time of writing)\nSeems some installation code (acer recovery partition) tries to mount all partitions including a partition that should not be mounted /dev/sda4 which is an extended partition block created to have more than 4 partitions on a disk.   Its not just UFS, the script tries to mount it as ext4, fat, and some others, each have a different error message, only the UFS error message looks a bit scary.\nSo I think this is a cosmetic issue and the messages can be ignored.\n\nA: This may happen, for example, when you attach a FreeBSD installation image to a virtual machine using virt-manager (or the like). The FreeBSD image has a partition with UFS on it and when it gets attached (as a loopback device, e.g. with losetup) on the host, it will get scanned for filesystems by udev and friends. UFS may be discovered at that point.\nAs a side note, this^^^ only happens with raw ISO images treated as loopback devices, not with QCOW2 images preferred for writable (and trimmable) storage. (Reading QCOW2 as a block device would require a conversion or a nbd setup.)\nUsually lsblk -pf can help reveal where exactly the UFS may be.\n", "Q: Is running packages from Ubuntu universe more risky than running the same packages on Debian? I am running Ubuntu LTS Server. Are there any concerns with security patching of universe packages? I mean am I in risk of running vulnerable system if having universe packages when compared to the alternative of running a similar Debian server?\n\nA: Even in Debian, there are many many packages that don't get regular security updates.  From the Debian security channel on OFTC IRC:\n\nThe security team provides support for all packages, with the help of the package maintainers (and upstream developers).\n\nFrom the general discussion, we can assume that major security breakages get their attention, but there is obviously a threshold for severity.\nFrom the Debian Security FAQ for the question \"How is security handled in Debian?\":\n\nOnce the security team receives a notification of an incident, one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not). If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done, an advisory is published.\n\nHowever, the consideration point is that the security team isn't going to be fluent in all packages, and will rely on the support from package maintainers and upstream devs as well to 'fix' problems.\nUpon further discussion in the Debian Security IRC channel, it was said that my analysis here sums up the situation nicely:\n\nThe Debian security team provides support for all with the help of package maintainers and upstream, but they don't personally patch everything.\n   -- teward\n\n\nUbuntu is no different, except that the community supports 'universe'.  The Universe packages are not actively maintained by the Ubuntu Security Team, and security fixes for those packages are community provided (with some exceptions, such as the nginx package which almost exclusively I provide patches for to the Ubuntu Security Team).  While you are not guaranteed any updates for these packages, a lot of the popular ones will have enough attention to usually have someone working to try and patch security issues.\nTo specifically answer, though, you'd need to provide the package list(s) you're curious about, but not on this site as that becomes an open ended unending set of questions and answers.\nTo truly answer the question of 'vulnerable system' is impossible within the scope of this site though, because while there are 'safeguards' you can take to mitigate some of the nonpatched software due to the nature of those packages, analyzing your use cases and determining mitigation for each thing also goes outside the scope of this site and the ability to answer within the restrictions set forth here.\n", "Q: How to restore Dell M3800 Developer Edition How do I completely restore Ubuntu to factory on the Dell M3800 Developer Edition?

I have Windows 8 and Kali Linux along with my Ubuntu. How should I update my Ubuntu to 15.04 without losing my other operating systems. I was thinking of downloading Ubuntu 15.04 and then installing it over Ubuntu 14.04, instead of updating Ubuntu 14.04 via terminal or update manager. Will that be a good option? \n(Moreover I cannot update my Ubuntu via terminal or update manager as I use internet through a proxy server which requires authentication. I asked about it in my previous question and none of the techniques given by others worked)\nThanks in advance :)\n\nA: Directly upgrade to Ubuntu 15.04 from 14.04 is not possible, but this does not mean that you can't do this. No USB sticks etc. needed. I do the update through SSH from remote PC :)  \nNote:\n\nPlease keep in mind, that all operations below should be completed under root permissions or sudo, as you are modifying system settings.\n\nBefore you upgrade, you need to install these upgrade helpers:\nsudo apt-get install update-manager update-manager-core\n\nAfter that, go to /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades file and change Prompt=lts to Prompt=normal. Make sure that meta-release file in same folder looks like this. If it isn't there, add it at the bottom of the file: \n[METARELEASE]\nURI = http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/meta-release\nURI_LTS = http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/meta-release-lts\nURI_UNSTABLE_POSTFIX = -development\nURI_PROPOSED_POSTFIX = -proposed\n\nUpgrading from 14.04 to 15.04 will looks like this: 14.04 -> 14.10 -> reboot -> 15.04 -> reboot -> done\nHere are the next steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*execute do-release-upgrade -d in terminal\n\n*[follow screen instructions], reboot at the end. 14.10 will be installed\n\n*execute do-release-upgrade -d in terminal\n\n*[follow screen instructions], reboot at the end. 15.04 will be installed\n\n\nEnjoy! :) \nP.S. All data and software will be preserved. Also after the upgrade don't forget to update custom apt repositories, as they probably will be disabled for the upgrade period.\n\nA: It is best to download the ISO from Ubuntu website and create a live USB with it using UNetbootin. Then while booting from USB you will be given an option to upgrade. This will preserve your data. \nEdit: As pointed out below, you will have to first update to 14.10 to upgrade to 15.04, but you can follow the same strategy.\n", "Q: How to add a Kernel from another distro I've been using archlinux with a patched kernel on my surface pro 3.\nI switched to ubuntu now and want to use the kernel that includes all the patches from arch with ubuntu.\nWhat is the best way to add the Kernel?\nCan I simply copy the vmlinuz and initramfs and update-grub?\nI copied the files and updated grub, which worked fine.\nBut when I boot the new Kernel I get a Kernel panic:\nUnable to mount root filesystem.\nThe Kernel here was provided precompiled with with /usr and /lib as a .tar.gz archive.\nThe Kernel package I used does not provide that,it just contains the patches, so I can't justcopy /usr and /lib from the archive.  \nI could copy them from my arch distribution running this Kernel, but what specific directories would I have to copy, the whole /usr and /lib?\n\nA: simply copying the vmlinuz and initramfs and update-grub might work, but you might also need lib and usr.

I searched but topics on thinkpad yoga are rare and I didn't find other people with the same issue.\n\nA: It sounds like Ubuntu boots successfully but cannot display anything. The reason is that you have a new graphic card that partially supported in Ubuntu 14.04. Ubuntu 14.04 supports nvidia 331 drivers by default while your card was first supported on nvidia 337+ drivers.\nTherefore, you have two options for fixing it: Installing Ubuntu 14.10 (Note: it's not LTS!) or trying to install newer drivers.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get install nvidia-349 nvidia-settings\n\nA: In the end I resolved my problem by installing ubuntu 15.04.

This great answer by @AaronD (please do upvote him) has details on how to do that using htpasswd editor.\nOnce you have created that alternative passwords file, save it to /etc/gdm.passwd (or somewhere) and add this line to the beginning of /etc/pam.d/gdm-password:\nauth     required  pam_pwdfile.so pwdfile /etc/gdm.passwd\n\nwhere /etc/gdm.passwd is the path where you saved the passwd file.  And comment out the system-local-login line that follows.  This switches the required authentication from pulling from normal local account to your new configuration.\nNo restarting or anything should be required, just save that file and Super+L to test it out!\n\nThis is just a compliation of the procedure that worked out for me.

The only way I've figured out how to fix it is to boot into safe mode, drop into a root prompt, and run the NVIDIA driver installer.\nIt wasn't just a one-time thing; it's been probably the past 5-6 updates.\nI'd imagine this perhaps has something to do with X settings, but I'm not completely sure.

After that, when you run the nvidia installer, it will ask you whether you want to register with DKMS. Tell it to do so.\nNext time when a kernel update happens, it will recompile the shim code automatically.\nThe only thing you need to watch out for are MESA updates. Those tend to clobber the OpenGL setup. It's fixed by re-running the installer. I'm currently waiting to see if step no. 10 of this tutorial fixes the problem permanently.

Keep getting this pop-up requiring me to enter my password when I have Modem Manager GUI open. It happens every 5 mins, as long as Modem Manager is open.\nHow do i change my system policy to allow the manager.?\nUbuntu 15.04 \n\nA: The message is defined and raised by polkit in the file /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.policy.\nIdeal is for the author of Modem Manager GUI to define a polkit policy (see the \"Declaring Actions\" section in the polkit documentation) that would be shipped in future versions of the application.\nMeanwhile, you can add a set of authorization rules in /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/ in a file named something like 30-modem-manager-gui.rules as per the \"Authorization Rules\" section in the polkit docs I referenced above.\nAn example rule that checks for the specific message you get and that won't show the message if you are a sudo user:\npolkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {\n  if (action.id == \"org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Device.Control\" &&\n        subject.local && subject.active && \n        (subject.isInGroup (\"sudo\"))) {\n    return polkit.Result.YES;\n  }\n});\n\nOther users, please help improve this answer with a better example. This is my first stack exchange answer.\n\nA: Just as a direct alternative to Njenga's answer, you can edit file /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.policy directly.

I know this question may have been asked before but the solutions are all out of date or don't work.\nI am running Ubuntu as a VM in VMWare on a Mac. If I try to switch from Ubuntu (in VMWare) to the host computer's OS (Mac OS X) but pressing command-tab, it almost always brings up the search box as I switch since the \"command\" button is the \"super\" key. When I command-tab back to Ubuntu the search box is now up cover my app and I have to manually click the window I was working on to get back to it. This is very frustrating and makes switching from Ubuntu to a Mac OS X app very difficult. \nI've tried using Compiz Config Settings Manager. I've tried changing the keyboard settings.

One of the textboxes asks you to enter your password, and the other asks you to confirm it.\nIf during that step the installer tells you it doesn't match, which appears to be what you are describing, then as Zacharee1 says this means you did not enter them the same each time.\nIn this step, you are creating a new password for yourself. Your password will be whatever you decide. It is not a problem that you didn't create one before or that you were never given one. Just type exactly the same text in both password boxes, and you should be able to continue with the installation.\n", "Q: Combining keys (e.g., \" + e = ë) not working in KDE applications (dead keys) I have been using 'combining keys' such as + e = ë, ~ + a = ã, ^ + <space> = ^ for the longest time in my Kubuntu setup. I do not remember if the system came like that out of the box or if I configured it somehow.\nAfter upgrading to Kubuntu 15.04 this functionality does not seem to work in KDE applications anymore, but it's still working fine in Firefox, Thunderbird, Atom, etc.\nFirefox, Thunderbird, Atom: all the ones I tested work (~,`,',\",^)\nKonsole, Kate: none work\nRekonq: some work (~,`,^), other do not (\", ')\n\nI have looked through all the settings but couldn't find the relevant one.\nDoes anyone have any idea on how to fix this? Especially the \" and ~ keys are fairly important when using the command prompt.\nI have filed a bug report for the same on https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=347137, but as it might be a user error rather than a bug I'm asking it here as well.\nCheers,\nChris.\n\nA: I had the same problem where the keys were working in GTK based applications such as Firefox, but not in the Qt based applications of KDE. Some recommendations I found online were suggesting to configure or remove IBus or XIM but doing so did not help me.\nWhilst checking the output of locale (displays current locale settings) I found the system was using nds_DE.UTF-8 (Low Saxon). After changing this to de_DE.UTF-8 (ordinary German) the keyboard works as expected.\nThe locale can be switched in KDE's System Settings in Regional Settings → Formats. After doing so locale outputs:\n\nLANG=de_DE.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=en_US\nLC_CTYPE=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=POSIX\nLC_PAPER=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_NAME=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_ADDRESS=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_TELEPHONE=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\"de_DE.UTF-8\"\nLC_ALL=\n\nThis gives me the system messages and UI in English whilst the formatting is German.\nIn order to type the characters of several European languages, using a composite key seems comfortable to me. I've set this up in KDE's System Settings in Input Devices → Keyboard → Advanced. Here you want to check “Configure keyboard options” and select “Caps Lock” in “Position of Compose key” below to give this annoying key a sensible job.\nNow, you enter the characters like so:\n^ +  → ^\n~ → ~\n\" → \"\n^ + a → â\nCaps Lock + e + \" → ë\nCaps Lock + a + a → å\nCaps Lock + n + ~ → ñ\nhttps://cyberborean.wordpress.com/2008/01/06/compose-key-magic/ lists more of those sequences and gives some background information. Using this composite key and typing the sequences is a matter of taste but works nicely for me for languages with the occasional special character such as German, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, … and does not require switching keyboard layouts constantly.\n\nA: The solution is to specify the layout under system settings > input devices > keyboard > layouts > configure layouts. Choose one with variant containing 'with dead keys'.\n\nA: Use your compose key for that:\n\n\n*\n\n*ë press Compose+\" and release, press e\n\n*ã press Compose+~ and release, press a\n\n*ê press Compose+^ and release, press e\nMy compose key is the menu key:\n$ gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options\n['terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp', 'compose:menu']\n\n", "Q: What is .Trash-0 and why does it act up every so often? I noticed that despite deleting several large files from my hard drive my hard drive space wasn't opening up any, and remembered that every once in a while that .Trash-0 folder (no .Trash-1000 in my /home) will hold on to my files for some reason.

While this is usually done as part of the /etc/fstab file for persistent options for specific partitions or media, you can manually provide options for a given mount command if you wish.\nMounting with the following command should do what you need it to do without modifying your own user's UID or GID.  This makes a MacOS folder in /media/username/, where we'll mount the drive partition to:\nsudo mkdir -R /media/username/MacOS\nsudo chown --recursive username:username /media/username\nsudo mount -t hfsplus -o uid=USERUID,gid=USERGID /dev/sdx /media/username/MacOS\n\nReplace /dev/sdx with the actual partition identifier, and all instances of 'username' with the user's name.  Similarly, replace USERID and USERGID with the actual values there.\nTo make it persistently user mountable, you should add an fstab entry that allows users to mount and unmount the drive, while providing the uid and gid accordingly.\n(Note: the uid and gid arguments were obtained from kernel.org documentation.  You must have the prerequisite libraries to read hfsplus partitions to make this work.)\n", "Q: Ubuntu live USB installer won't boot Can anyone help me in regards to the installation of Ubuntu 15.04.

I'm having trouble importing .mp3 files into Rhythmbox. Whenever I try and select my ~/Music/ folder that has the .mp3 files, I can just see the files but grayed out. I've tried dragging one of the files into the music playing area, but it just tells me that \nProblem occurred without error being set. This is a bug in Rhythmbox\nor GStreamer.\n\nI've installed the ubuntu-restricted-extras package the gstreamers packages as well.\nI'm happy to post the contents of my Rhythmbox plugins folder if that will help.\nThanks.\nUpdate\nI no longer run Ubuntu GNOME and have no way of verifying what the correct answer to my question is.

Having subsequently loaded the correct codecs, my solution was to close Rhythmbox, then open the Files browser, selecting Show Hidden Files from the View drop down, then clicking through the folders .local, share, rhythmbox,then right-clicking on the rhythmdb.xml database file and selecting rename to rhythmdb.bakxml and then restarting Rhythmbox which immediately began importing all the files from my default music folder. Rhythmbox created a brand new rhythmdb.xml file on its own and now all my mp3 files have been imported to the library and are playable.\n\nA: An update. The gstreamer package nowadays looks like it is gstreamer1.0 instead of gstreamer0.10. Then I had to follow the trick posted by Mehrotra, and it worked. The new xml list did indeed work!\nWhat kind of bizarre bug is this related to Rhythmbox, and nobody takes care of it?\n\nA: Solved the importing problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*install the gstreamer plugins\n\n*exit rhythmbox\n\n*run the following command to remove its database records: \nrm ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/rhythmdb.xml\n\n*open rhythmbox and try again.\n\n", "Q: LibreOffice crashes on startup after upgrade to Ubuntu 15.04 I would have up-voted or responded to this thread but I do not have enough rep: Libreoffice doesnt work since update to ubuntu 15.04\nAfter an upgrade to Ubuntu 15.04 LibreOffice (Writer, Calc etc) crashes on startup.

I just tried Kubuntu 15.04. I installed Thunderbird with minimizetotray addon. But window disappears instead of minimize to tray. How can I fix it?\n\nA: In KDE5 the usual minimize-to-tray plugin works except you can't see icon but notification popup does appear so workaround is to add thunderbird app icon to panel to simulate its notification icon when minimized.  The only difference is the app icon is a little bigger than the one which appears after minimizing.  This way the behavior is exactly the same, in fact better since to open Thunderbird you click on the app icon just once.  Fire-tray plugin never worked for me in KDE5.\n\nA: Firetray does not work in current/newer versions of KDE's plasmashell, since the indicator rewrite.  The author of Firetray was working on actual indicator support, but unfortunately has decided to discontinue the project (https://foudil.fr/blog/209/the-web-is-not-the-platform/).  This is a shame, because I've not found any better option that works with thunderbird myself.\nThe only workaround I've found is to continue using the last release (0.6.0.1) of firetry and also install stalonetray.  If you configure stalonetray correctly, it can displaying the firetray icon (and any other legacy apps without real indicator support).\n\nA: This thread is a little old, but the problem regarding minimizing Thunderbird to system tray still remains, at least for me having Debian 10 along with KDE Plasma desktop.\nMy today's workaround was successful!

The installation has stalled at about 60% and hasn't moved in an hour.\nThe message at the bottom says: Configuring bcmwl-kernal-source (i386).\nI have no experience with Ubuntu (or with Linux, for that matter), coming from a strictly-Windows background). Can anyone offer some advice?\n\nA: You can't install Ubuntu on a Compaq Presario R3000 because it doesn't meet the minimum systems requirements for installing Ubuntu. There is only one currently supported *buntu iso file that meets the minimum systems requirements for installing it on a Compaq Presario R3000 and that is Lubuntu 14.04 32-bit. Lubuntu 14.04 desktop requires a Pentium II or Celeron system with at least 128MB of RAM and at least 5GB of disk space.\nEvery other currently supported *buntu iso file requires at least 512MB RAM and some of them require more RAM than that. Lubuntu 14.04 is similar in look and feel to Windows XP, so it looks like it could be a good replacement for Windows XP, but Lubuntu 14.10, 15.04, 15.10 and 16.04 require at least 512MB RAM too.\nWhen Lubuntu 14.04 reaches end of life in April, 2017, the Ubuntu Minimal CD will still be compatible with your hardware, if you select the command line install. The command line install of the Ubuntu Minimal CD installs nothing but the core packages required to run Ubuntu text-only from a text-only console.\nAfter booting the Ubuntu Minimal CD, follow these instructions:\n\n*\n\n*You need a wired Ethernet connection.\n\n*At the \"boot:\" prompt, press the Enter key.\n\n*Select \"Command Line Install\".\n\n*Select your language and country.\n\n*Select your keyboard layout.\n\n*Specify hostname for your system (for use on the network).\n\n*Choose your archive mirror for downloading the base system from.\n\n*Partitioning - Most will simply want Guided - use entire disk.\n\n*Updates - Select No Automatic Updates.\n\n*Let it install GRUB onto the disk.\n\n*Other than that, just answer the questions as you are asked.\n\nWhen the installation is complete, it will reboot to a text-only console. Login to the console with your username and password, and then run these commands:\nsudo apt-get install lightdm xorg fluxbox eterm hsetroot xloadimage fbautostart fbdesk fbpager wm-icons\nsudo reboot  \n\nUpdate: The fbdesk package has been discontinued in Ubuntu 16.04, so instead of fbdesk just install wm-icons.\nThe reason why I recommend the optional add-ons to fluxbox that appear after fluxbox in the above apt-get install command is to provide additional functionality to fluxbox window manager while keeping the systems resources usage low.\nThis will give you a very basic desktop experience, so that you can continue to use Ubuntu on your laptop for years to come. By \"basic desktop experience\" I mean that you get to use the mouse, instead of only the keyboard, use menus for selecting things, and if you want to use applications you will have to install them yourself.\n", "Q: Why Ubuntu isn't installed in UEFI by default? I have seen some posts about installing Ubuntu in BIOS and in UEFI. In the Community Wiki mentions that UEFI will replace the BIOS in all PCs. Also it mentions that if it is not absolutely necessary we should install Ubuntu in BIOS and not UEFI. \nWindows 8.1 to my understanding already are installed only in UEFI. So my question is why Ubuntu isn't installed in UEFI by default (like Windows 8.1) if UEFI is going to be the replacement of BIOS?\nMoreover Ubuntu not only isn't installed by default in UEFI but installing in it is discouraged (in the Community Wiki). Why is that?\n\nA: Ubuntu automatically detects whether a machine has been booted in legacy mode or in UEFI mode and chooses the installation type based on that.\nSo the installation type is determined based on how the installer has been booted.\nSo this is really dependant on the UEFI settings rather than on how Ubuntu is designed.\n\nA: I'd first like to reiterate what kos wrote: The Ubuntu installer installs Ubuntu in the mode in which it was booted. You as a user have no choice on the matter once the installer has booted. Your only choice in the matter comes before that point, when you boot the medium. Unfortunately, how to force the medium to boot in a particular mode varies from one computer to another, so it's difficult to describe succinctly and in a way that's universally applicable.\nThe Ubuntu installer could, in theory, install a BIOS-mode boot loader when booted in EFI mode; but it cannot fully install an EFI-mode boot loader when booted in BIOS mode. The reason is that EFI boot loaders rely on NVRAM settings that can only be manipulated from an EFI-mode boot. This, really, is the reason for linking the installation mode to the boot mode.\nAs to why the wiki discourages installation in EFI mode, you'd have to ask its authors. Personally, I think that detail is wrong. VERY wrong. (I also never noticed it before now. Maybe it's relatively new.) In a dual-boot configuration, the Ubuntu boot mode should be matched to the boot mode of whatever OS is already installed on the computer. Doing it otherwise requires jumping through post-installation hoops to either synchronize the two boot modes or to create a way to easily switch boot modes on a per-boot basis. In fact, I've written a Web page that provides my own advice. It's not Ubuntu-specific, but it applies quite well to Ubuntu.\n\nA: Well, Ubuntu's live media does boot and install in UEFI mode when\nthe machine is in UEFI mode.  The problem is each vendor seems to\nput their own non-UEFI standard tweaks into the UEFI boot process,\nso each machine has it unique set of issues when installing in\nUEFI mode.  When Windows 8.1 is installed in UEFI mode, that is the\nnecessary condition to use UEFI mode for Ubuntu.  If you are just\nputting Ubuntu on a machine without Windows, there is no reason\nto put up with all the vendor nonsense, just switch over to\ncompatibility/legacy/BIOS mode and install works as it always has.\nIt doesn't hurt to try a straight UEFI install even it that case.\nSome machines which follow the UEFI standard will install in UEFI\nmode  just as easily as the BIOS/legacy installs.\n", "Q: How can I know which file is being used in a bash for loop?

I've installed the latest Intel drivers and they appear to be loading correctly.\nI can manually set the resolution to 2560x1440p using xrandr - and it works correctly for a short period of time, however for some reason some applications will reset it back to 1920x1200\nFor example - if I run \"Dropbox\" it'll revert back to 1920 and refuse to switch using xrandr until I've killed the offending application.\nThe Ubuntu screen settings dialog also resets the resolution, and then only lets me choose a lower 1920x1200 resolution.\nIs there any way to force xorg to explicitly recognize 2560x1440 as a valid resolution, therefore presumably not resetting to a lower point whenever any application hits whatever API is forcing it to revert?\n\nA: Also, it's helpful to cut out adapters when testing.

I'm pretty bad at the whole computer literacy thing, but for the most part I can Google things pretty well. From what I've read, partitioning deallocates everything on the partition that is getting modified. However, I've also read on the Installer package that if it's installed alongside my current OS, I won't lose my stuff (I've got Windows 8, and UEFI kinda sucks, but I can get the try Ubuntu to work. It's just not a cursor based GUI, and it's a lot less pretty). Does Ubuntu Desktop identify and reallocate everything as it was? Because I gotta say, if it does, that's pretty rad. If not, while I've got backups, I don't want to reinstall software. I can just wait until I get a new laptop and use have the clean slate with a dual boot.\nThanks,\nIf this is on another thread, please point me in the right way. I've spent 40 minutes trekking through these forums.\n\nA: You should allocate a separate partition for Ubuntu if you are planning to dual-boot with windows. If you choose so, make sure that you have moved all data from these partition(s) to some other partition because installing Ubuntu will format this partition and you will lose data if you put anything here. In addition, installing Ubuntu alongside windows like described above will not harm your data that is still in windows. There are a lot of information on Ubuntu-Windows dual boot. To start with look at the official documentation.\n\nA: It's possible to resize partitions in such a way that data are not lost, although the amount of free space on the resized partition(s) will change. New partitions for Ubuntu can then be created in the space \"vacated\" by the resized partition(s). The Ubuntu installer can do this automatically or semi-automatically in some cases.\nBEWARE, THOUGH! There are numerous posts here from people who've mistakenly wiped out their Windows installations by accidentally selecting an option that allocates the entire disk to Ubuntu when they'd intended to have Ubuntu coexist alongside their existing Windows installation. I haven't thoroughly investigated these cases, so I don't know what specific mistake they're making or what specific bug might exist in the Ubuntu installer that creates this problem. It's best to make a backup of all your important data before installing Ubuntu, just in case you run into this problem. When you do your installation, be sure to follow a procedure that explicitly states your Windows installation will remain intact. Pay particular attention to any partitioning instructions and the option on the \"Installation Type\" screen. If you don't see the option your procedure specifies on this screen, do not shrug your shoulders and select something else at random, since that could be the mistake that costs you your Windows installation. Research what each of the options you see does before picking one. (The available options vary depending on your current configuration and boot mode.)\n", "Q: How to find relevant log file to report crashes?

I have a 1 TB hard drive in a Macbook Pro 6,2 (mid-2010) partitioned with 900 GB for Mac OS X and 100 GB for Ubuntu 14.04. I wanted to make the HFS+ partition (with OS X installed as a boot drive) readable from Ubuntu. I followed another user's answer and did this:\nsudo mkdir -R /media/username/MacOS\nsudo chown --recursive username:username /media/username\nsudo mount -t hfsplus -o uid=USERUID,gid=USERGID /dev/sdx /media/username/MacOS\n\nThe chown step seems to go through every file on the HFS+ partition (mounted at /media/username/MacOS) and changes ownership to the user indicated by username. After each change, the process says \"Read-only file system\". When I access the MacOS partition using sudo nautilus, the files are also read-only.\nBased on my research, this is good; HFS+ is supposed to be read-only for Ubuntu unless journaling is turned off, so it seems to be operating as it should. My question, then, is what is chown actually changing? Is it changing the permissions of the files on the HFS+ partition itself, or is it just changing whether Ubuntu gives access to those (read-only) files to my user? In other words, is chown actually making any changes to my Mac OS X files/permissions? Can chown make changes to permissions on a drive that is read-only?\n\nA: chown cannot make changes to read-only filesystems.\n", "Q: Uninstall VirtualBox before uninstalling Ubuntu I have installed VirtualVox VM and then installed Ubuntu.\nThen after some days I uninstalled VirtualBox from add/remove program.

Currently I am sitting at another computer...)\nI tried to boot Ubuntu from a Live-CD. Ubuntu does not start (hangs, when the dots are blinking). I tried all possible options in UEFI-configuration (boot-order, secure-boot off, UEFI-mode...)\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI says:\n2. If the other systems (Windows, GNU/Linux...) of your computer are installed in Legacy (not-UEFI) mode, then you must install Ubuntu in Legacy mode too. \nBecause I installed Windows, Grub, and Ubuntu with the old motherboard, I suspect, that now I have to use legacy mode = CSM. Which I tried...\nAny Ideas?\nHere is a screenshot taken after removal of 'splash quiet':\n\n\nA: The fact that GRUB starts, and can start Windows, means that GRUB is starting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. GRUB cannot switch boot modes (BIOS to EFI or EFI to BIOS), so GRUB must be trying to start Linux in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, too. In other words, EFI support is not your issue. If you try messing with those settings in the firmware, or make EFI-related changes to your disk partitioning or boot loader configuration, you're only likely to make matters worse.\nMy guess is that you've got a problem with your video configuration, but it could be something else like disk issues. You might get some more clues this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*When GRUB starts, highlight the Ubuntu entry, but do not press Enter.\n\n*Press the e key to edit the GRUB entry. A simple text editor will start.\n\n*Locate the kernel line and remove the words quiet splash from that line.\n\n*Start the entry. (There's a prompt for what key to press to do this at the bottom, but I don't recall what it is offhand.)\n\n\nThe result will be an attempt to start Ubuntu, but with verbose text-mode messages about the startup procedure displayed to the screen.

Therefor you have a private key and the server has the public key in its ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\nThe reason why your friend gets access is probably because he has uploaded his public key to the server.\nBut your friend probably doesnt want you to have his private key - because then you could authenticate as him on all servers he has uploaded his public key to.\nSo to get access - you need to upload your public key into the account that you are using.\nIf this is a plain ssh server - then you can scp it over and append the key to the '~/.ssh/authorized_keys'.

To do that, it uses the Python subprocess.Popen with shell=True, which defaults to using /bin/sh. On Ubuntu systems, /bin/sh is the dash shell rather than the bash shell (see DashAsBinSh), which doesn't support much of the syntax in the .bashrc file. \nI can think of a couple of fixes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the installer.py file in a text editor and tell the runProcess function to use bash by changing\n\ndef runProcess(cmd, verbose=1):\n    if verbose:\n        print cmd\n    process = subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)\n\nto\n\ndef runProcess(cmd, verbose=1):\n    if verbose:\n        print cmd\n    process = subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True, executable='/bin/bash', stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)\n\n\n*Temporarily symlink sh to bash before you run the installer\nsudo ln -sf bash /bin/sh\n\nYou can revert it when you're done with\nsudo ln -sf dash /bin/sh\n\n", "Q: Can't locate LWP After recent upgrade I can't launch only one of my apps it always gives me this error:\nCan't locate LWP/UserAgent/Cached.pm in @INC (you may need to install the \nLWP::UserAgent::Cached module) (@INC contains: /etc/perl /usr/local\n/lib/perl/5.18.2 /usr/local/share/perl/5.18.2 /usr/lib/perl5 /usr/share\n/perl5 /usr/lib/perl/5.18 /usr/share/perl/5.18 /usr/local/lib/site_perl .) \nat /usr/share/perl/5.18/WWW/YoutubeViewer.pm line 242.\n\nI followed as in instructed in the first answer here but all of those commands return positive outputs I got libwww-perl installed and running apt-get dist-upgrade doesn't give anything to upgrade either.\nWhat else could I be missing?\n\nA: Try to install the missing module from CPAN:\nsudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install LWP::UserAgent::Cached'\n\n\nA: you'll need to install libwww-perl.\nwget http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/LWP/libwww-perl-6.06.tar.gz\ntar xvzf libwww-perl-6.06.tar.gz\ncd libwww-perl-6.06\nperl Makefile.PL\nmake\nmake install\n\nor  \napt-get install libwww-perl\n\nOr you can try this solution\nperl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::LWP'\n\n", "Q: How to use an exisiting OpenPGP key from Launchpad I want gpg to use my existing active OpenPGP key from Launchpad without having to generate and import a new key. \n\n$ gpg --list-keys returns nothing.\nBtw I'm trying to sign the Code of Conduct\n$ gpg --clearsign UbuntuCodeofConduct-2.0.txt \ngpg: no default secret key: secret key not available\ngpg: UbuntuCodeofConduct-2.0.txt: clearsign failed: secret key not available\n\n\nA: To sign the code of conduct, you need to have the secret key of the key you're signing it with. Launchpad (and other key servers) only store the public key. Therefore, if you don't have the secret key of the key that's registered with your account on Launchpad, you'll need to generate a new key.\n\nA: I faced a similar issue, after some research and struggle I came out with this:\nInstead of: $ gpg --list-keys and $ gpg --clearsign UbuntuCodeofConduct-2.0.txt,\nuse: $ gpg2 --list-keys and $ gpg2 --clearsign UbuntuCodeofConduct-2.0.txt.\nAlso, in order to see your secret key, use gpg2 --list-secret-keys.

It seems to me that sometimes there's a significant difference in behaviour between \"reboot\" and \"switch off\". For example, rebooting the phone from a normal state (without any problems) results in getting into a very long boot phase (flashing bq logo and so on for about 3 - 4 minutes).

I want to convert this laptop to Ubuntu 15.4. with NO dual boot. I want it to be an exclusive Linux machine. This laptop can boot off the E Drive with a USB Drive.\nI used a brand new Kingston 4 GB USB Drive. I followed Ubuntu installation instructions to the letter \n\n\n*\n\n*I went to Pendrivelinux.com and downloaded the Universal USB Installer V1.9.5.9 to my USB Drive.\n\n*I went to Ubuntu and downloaded Ubuntu Linux V15.04 to my USB Drive.\n\n*Using The Universal USB Installer I installed Ububtu Linux 5.4 on my USB Drive.\n\n*My BIOS is updated to the latest BIOS from Lenovo's Website, which was posted on March 9, 2015, Filename/BIOS Version: accn22ww(v2.08&v1.1).\n\n*My BIOS is configured to boot from the USB Drive first\n\n*When I reboot the USB Drive is not recognized as a boot drive and the system still boots into Windows.\nAgain, I want to boot up and install Ubuntu Linux 15.04 and have the system be an exclusive LINUX machine. I have an identical Lenovo S20-30 rynning the standard Windows 8.1 and want to compare functionality and performance running the same applications on identical machines.\nHas anyone installed Ubuntu Linux on a Lenovo S20-30 before?\nWhat do I need to troubleshoot and check?\nI am an experienced Windows person but new to Linux so please be gentle and don't assume I know much about Linux. That's what this is all about, I want to become Linux expert and hope I can one day soon be fully on Ubuntu Linux and never look back\n\nI went back in to my BIOS and look at the configuration very carefully setting by setting. I was finally able to find the best combination of BIOS settings to get my Lenovo S20-30 to boot up from my USB Drive and Ubuntu 15.4 is fully installed now as the ONLY operating system on myS20-30.\nI have painstakingly documented every BIOS setting below along with the settings I changed to sucessfully boot up from my Ubuntu Boot USB.\nSo now its time tolearn learn learn Ubuntu. I hope my post below proves helpful to others.\n\nHere is some  additional BIOS Information\nInformation:\nProduct Name: LenovoS20-20\nBIOS Version (Mostcurrent): ACCN22WW(V2.0)\nEC Version:ACEC22WW(V1.1)\nCPU: Intel CeleronCPU N2830 @ 2.16GHz\nWindows License: WIN\nConfiguration:\nUSB XHCI Controller: Enabled\nWireless: Enabled\nSATA ControllerMode: AHCI\nPower Beep: Disabled\nBIOS Back Flashisabled\nHotkey Mode: Enabled\nSecurity:\nSupervisor Password:Not Installed\nUser Password: NotInstalled\nHDD Password: NotSet\nSecure Boot: Enabled\nSecure Boot Status:Enabled\nPlatform Mode: UserMode\nReset to Setup Mode: Enter\nRestore FactoryKeys: Enter\nBoot:\nBoot Mode: UEFI is set now.

Other Legacy OS please use Legacy Support Mode\nAdditionally I havereset the Bios to Legacy Support with the same result whenbooting up\nWhen selecting BootMode of Legacy First I am presented with two choices for“Boot Priority”.\n1. Legacy First\n2. UEFI First\nWiththe following note: Determine EFI Device first or LegacyDevice first. If Enable it is the EFI Device first,If Disable it is the Legacy Device First\nI did cold boots with each combination selected:\nUnsuccessfulBoot configuration to boot from the USB Drive: \nLegacySupport\nUEFI First\nSuccessful Bootconfiguration to boot from the USB Drive:\nLegacy Support\nLegacy Device First\n\nA: There is a detailed tutorial on installing Ubuntu alongside Windows in Lenovo S20-30. You can refer this link to get your USB booted.\nTo completely remove windows and install Ubuntu, refer to this or this thread and have a look at the Official documentation on UEFI firmware. After you have understood what you have to do, then boot from live cd/USB and select Use the Entire Disk option to install Ubuntu over windows.\n\nA: First of all I didn't understood what you meant by: \"This laptop can boot off the E Drive with a USB Drive\".\nDoesn't matter.\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't know for sure why Ubuntu recommend to use Universal USB Installer, it didn't work for my Lenovo Y580 as well. UNetbootin might not work either, assuming you have UEFI/GPT machine since Windows 8.1 was preinstalled. Use Rufus instead.\n\n*You shouldn't download ISO to USB but to HDD. I guess you misspelled that.\n\n*To use Rufus firs you should select ISO and then adjust other settings(UEFI/GPT), otherwise it wil reset your options(small bug in software).\n\n*Again, I don't believe you have BIOS rather UEFI. Enable USB boot and set order to first boot from USB. If you considering don't use Legacy mode no need for that.\n\n\nSo, your bootabe USB is set to go. You can use it in Live mode, before installation, to check if your devices are working properly: ethernet, bluetooth, WiFi...If not look around this site for an answer.You won't be disappointed because Ubuntu is much lighter on resources than Windows.\nAnd since you are now to askubuntu , do check if anyone else has post a similar question first.\n", "Q: how to run scheduled task ,after resume from sleep,only if computer was sleeping at the time of schedule i have a cron backup job set up, but i would like it to run after resume from sleep, if my computer was asleep at the scheduled time.\nexample: \nbackup script runs every night at 2:00.\noften i put my computer to sleep before night.\nat morning i start my computer.\ni would like to run the backup script as soon as possible,after resume.\nis there any simple way to make it work,\nwithout making double backups if i don't put my computer to sleep ?\n(somehow the cron/ or any other scheduler must know and remember it didnt do the scheduled task in the specified time and execute it as soon as possible)\nthank you very much\n\nA: Anacron can you what you are asking and is available in the Ubuntu repo's.

Now the network doesn't work.\nThe new plasma network manager either doesn't save the network settings\nat reboot or it goes to a default setting. In either case it doesn't work\nand I cannot even set it up manually. I had no problem at all with the older\nversion, it was very user friendly and usually set up automatically. Why doesn't this one. \n     Is there any way, without the use of the Internet, can I change the network manager back to the version that came with 12.04 and keep the new version 14.0 Kubuntu. At least it works.\nNow I am without network and Internet in my shop. \n\nA: If this is a stay at home computer, it may be preferable to remove Network Manager altogether and simply set up manual methods. First, be very certain that the driver and hardware seem to be working as expected. Check:\nifconfig\n\nDo you see an eth0 interface? Does it respond as expected if you do:\nsudo dhclient eth0\n\nBecause NM is trying to control networking, this command will probably not actually acquire an IP address; the hope is that it will produce no errors. Please open a terminal and do:\nsudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit. Add several lines to the file so that it reads as follows:\n# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static  \naddress 192.168.1.100  \nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\ndns-nameservers 192.168.1.1 8.8.8.8\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor. Of course, substitute your details here. Now do:\nsudo service network-manager restart\nsudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0\n\nIt might take a reboot.\nOnce you are satisfied, you may remove Network Manager in Software Center.\n", "Q: plain text can be enctypted like password in vi editor?

This file tells apt which repositories to check for updates. \nWhen several extra repositories are added, the list can get long and hard to maintain; so .list files are sometimes added to /etc/apt/sources.list.d. This makes it easier to enable and disable repositories as you need them. Behind the scenes apt just reads them all in the main list file before executing the check for updates.\nYou used sed to change the file names of all of the files in sources.list.d to .list.disable, which -- well, disabled them.\nThe message from apt is:\n...it has an invalid filename extension\n\nYou need to change the extensions of these files back to just .list in order to enable them again.\n", "Q: WHERE to add more IPv6 addresses I have a script to add many new IPv6 addresses on reboot and that code is in /etc/rc.local.

Well I did search through AskUbuntu and found some threads where people are asking about how can they install multiple fonts at once? I know the process. I have to copy-paste all the fonts, .ttf/.otf files inside of .font hidden folder and then rebuild the font cash via this command...\nfc-cache -rv\n\nThis is crystal clear. I just want to know this...\nI downloaded 10+ .zip font files. When I extracted the .zip folders I see within each folder there are couple of files. A readme file, a .ttf/.otf file and in some cases some variants of the fonts. Like bold.ttf, ultra_bold.ttf, semi_bold.ttf, black.ttf etc. I am not sure what these additional files are but I guess these are mainly variants of the core fonts. However my question is...\nDo I need to extract all the .zip files manually and then copy only .ttf/.otf files and then paste them manually in .font folder? Or I can use a terminal command which will do everything on behalf of me. Here by the word everything I meant...\n\n\n*\n\n*Extracting the .zip files\n\n*Copying only .ttf/.otf files\n\n*Pasting only the .ttf/.otf files into .font folder\n\n*Finally installing the .ttf/.otf files in Ubuntu\n\n\nSorry for asking a broad question. But to avoid down votes I had to make sure I am not asking anything which is asked before. And thanks in advanced for all your helps. \n\nA: Addendum to the accepted answer:\nRun fc-cache -f -v without sudo.\nIf you use sudo, as indicated by the accepted answer, fc-cache will only process the root's fonts folder, while ignoring the user's fonts folder.\n\nA: This is a one-liner in a terminal. Open a terminal with Ctr+Alt+T and run the commands below. Replace <your_font_zips> with the folder name, where you have placed your zip font files.\ncd <your_font_zips>\n# next command extracts all TTF and OTF files into your `.fonts` folder.\nunzip \"*.zip\" \"*.ttf\" \"*.otf\" -d ${HOME}/.fonts\n# next command rebuilds font cache\nsudo fc-cache -f -v\n\nIf you want to remove the fonts again, then simply delete the TTF files in your .fonts folder and rebuild the font cache.\nMore about fonts and Ubuntu here.\n\nAnd yes, you need all TTF files.\nTTF and/or OTF\nI quote:\n\nOTF is more likely to be a “better” font, as it supports more advanced\n  typesetting features (smallcaps, alternates, ligatures and so on\n  actually inside the font rather than in fiddly separate expert set\n  fonts). It can also contain either spline (TTF-style) or Bezier\n  (PostScript Type 1-style) curves, so hopefully you're getting the\n  shapes the font was originally designed in and not a\n  potentially-poorer-quality conversion.\n\nSource\n\nA: Not a one liner but here is slightly more robust script that works on Linux as well as OSX.

Mostly because we are moving from a hosted 2010 EXCH to 365, and once the migration is completed, I shouldn't need that plugin.\nI switched to the DavMail solution, and it worked flawlessly.  I wanted to avoid the popup and tray icon, so I tried the server install.  This created problems for me because the davmail.properties file was also created in /home/USER/.davmail.properties.  Once I removed the duplicate file, I could check email, but it would not send.  Doh, I had my outgoing port at 25,not 1025.  With that simple fix it worked perfectly.  I'm using Mint and followed these instructions: \nhttp://davmail.sourceforge.net/serversetup.html\n\nA: If you have web services enabled on the exchange server, then Davmail will do the trick: http://davmail.sourceforge.net\nHere's how to set up :\nOnce davmail is installed, go ahead and run it.\n\n*\n\n*Right-click the tray icon\n\n*Go to Settings→General  and enter your OWA exchange URL (ask your IT for this URL, or whoever set up exchange).\n\n*You can leave the rest of the settings as default if you wish- But do take note of the Local IMAP port (it defaulted to 1143 for me) as well as the SMTP port (it defaulted to 1025 for me).\n\n*Now, open up thunderbird and add an account.\n\n*Enter your email/password as normal and hit continue.  It will try to connect and fail, but go ahead and click Manual Config.\n\n*Change the incoming server to localhost and the port to 1143.\n\n*Change the outgoing server to localhost and the port to 1025.  Use your existing exchange email/password.\n\nVoila.\nKeep in mind davmail does not automatically start after reboot, so you will need to make sure it starts before trying to connect with thunderbird.\nTo explain what davmail is doing:\nDavmail is acting as a man-in-the-middle to your exchange server, relaying info to and from: thunderbird <-> davmail <-> exchange.  Thunderbird just connects to Davmail (which is running on your localhost) and davmail connects to your exchange server.\n\nA: You might be interested in BlueMail.\nIt's not a Thunberbird Add-on but it might be worth mentioning since it's available on many platforms, it's free (as in free beer), easy to install and supports Exchange via ActiveSync or EWS.\n# Make sure snapd is installed :\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install snapd\n# Install Bluemail :\nsudo snap install bluemail\n\nFor the ActiveSync URL, I simply used the OWA URL without https:// or /owa. So someexchangeserver.com instead of https://someexchangeserver.com/owa/.\nPS : I'm not affiliated to BlueMail, just pleasantly surprised by the ease of use.\n\nA: Exquilla is free, without cost and with modification freedom since March 2018, so now you can just use it.\nFor me, it works much better than davmail.\nIt just installs and works in Thunderbird 60, or you can get free licences from site for Thunderbird 52-60.\n", "Q: What are the best especial effects programs for Ubuntu ?

I installed 15.04 mainly to speed up my shutdown times from 15+ seconds to much less: now my laptop shuts down in three seconds, which is alright.\nAs systemd offers tools to analyze and speed up boot process like systemd-analyze, I played with it (found kexec-tools package along the way) and by disabling NetworkManager-wait-online.service and privoxy.service (I was not using the latter actually), I manged to get to here:\n Startup finished in 3.571s (firmware) + 3.404s (loader) + 2.054s (kernel) + 2.470s (userspace) = 11.501s\n\nHowever, when I actually measure with my phone the bootup time till the moment unity desktop, launcher and the top bar actually appear from the moment I press the power button, it is about 14-15 seconds. Where are the 3 seconds lost? Does systemd cheat a bit:-)?\n\nA: Not sure, but systemd-analyze records time until the default target has been reached which is graphical.target.\nYou can look at systemd-analyze critical-chain output to make this apparent.\nThis certainly means it records time until lightdm (or your dm) has been launched and not after. Which means it did not take into account the 3s that unity needs to open your session (I'm guessing you are using auto-login).\n", "Q: Downgrade PHP 5.6 to PHP 5.5 I installed Ubuntu 15.04, but I need to use PHP 5.5 and in 15.04 the standard is PHP 5.6\nI added the PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php5\n\nBut when I tried to install, I got:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies: \n\n    php5-mcrypt : Depends: phpapi-20121212 Depends: php5-common (= 5.5.24+dfsg-1+deb.sury.org~vivid+1) \nbut 5.6.4+dfsg-4ubuntu6 is to be installed\n\nHow should I proceed?\n\nA: If you really need PHP 5.5, than install this version with this command (for version 5.5.24+dfsg-1+deb.sury.org~vivid+1) and check the correct version here:\nsudo apt-get install php5=5.5.24+dfsg-1+deb.sury.org~vivid+1\n\nand set the package on hold:\nsudo apt-mark hold php5\n\nOtherwise you'll get in the next update again version 5.6\n\nA: The PPA maintainer has a separate PPA for use with PHP 5.6.

I have used Linux already, but that was some years ago and it was a really ugly distro made for schools, so I thought that Linux was s*** and just stuck to Windows. A few days ago I found out about Ubuntu, and decided I would give it a try.\nSince my computer DVD port won't open, I decided to use a USB drive. My first try was using Universal USB Installer. The process went fairly quickly in this old 2006 PC and I thought I would just plug it in, choose USB-HDD as boot and everything would work fine. Unfortunately, I got an error saying that something called syslinux was missing, so I just restarted the computer, booted into Windows XP and did some research. \nI used WinMD5Sum on my .iso and it was OK. I tried renaming isolinux, isolinux.bin and isolinux.cfg to syslinux, syslinux.bin and syslinux.cfg, but still no luck. So I thought my computer just wouldn't boot from FAT32, and since it was not formatting things properly, I used my cousin's Windows 8.1 machine, but I soon found out I couldn't format in FAT16, because the pendrive is 8GB. So I formatted it in NTFS because someone said it worked. \nI then did the process again with Universal USB Installer, but now, instead of giving me the syslinux error, it just booted straight to Windows, even if I choose USB-HDD. Then I tried UNetbootin and same problem. As I type this in, I'm doing the process one more time in FAT32 now using Universal USB Installer, because at least that gave me some sign of life. Please, anyone that has some experience with Ubuntu, help me. I have to quickly get rid of the Windows XP in this machine because it's so full of crap, it's even scary to use.\n\nA: This is most likely going to be a duplicate but I'll post my answer anyways.\nFirst I would be really interested in knowing from where you downloaded your iso images? AFAIK, you are not using Ubuntu.\nSo it is very simple. \n\n\n*\n\n*Download the appropriate Ubuntu installer from here\n\n*Follow the instructions given in the ubuntu website on how to create a bootable USB in windows (alternatively you can use UNetbootin instead of the tool suggested in the link)\n\nA: Personally, I use Win-Flash Novicop to create the Bootable USB Drives. This is a free application and works well to create bootable USBs, however only downside is that this program will recognize the mounted ISO's either in the default CD-ROM or if the CD/DVD Rom doesn't work for you then you can download Daemon Tools Light which is another free program to mount the ISO files by creating a virtual drive in your computer(Avoids Burning the External DVD's or CDs).\nTry creating the bootable CD, using Novicop and then make sure you change the boot order in BIOS for your USB Prior to other Devices (such as HDD or CD/DVD Writer). \nPlease post any further problems, if presist, during the install.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: Gustavo!\nI prefer to use RMPrepUSB to create bootable USB drives.\nI think it's more customizable and offers more flexibility to change Linux boot variables, like \"kernel\" and \"initrd\" (initial ramdisk).\nGive it a try...\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all, undo any modifications to the ISO file (I advise you to download a new fresh one);\n\n*Follow this tutorial to make a bootable USB drive;\n\n*Then paste into your \"menu.lst\" file (created at previous step) the code I've posted in my answer;\n\n*Boot your machine with the bootable USB drive, and choose the menu entry you want.\n\n\nI hope it helps! \nLaters!\n\nA: I always use rufus to make USB drive as boot-able one. \nSimple two steps will make it easy\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the proper iso file for UBUNTU. \n\n*Install the rufus, select the UBUNTU ISO file path.

Like that\ngit clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-precise.git\ncd ubuntu-precise\n\nAnd you will see \"debian\" in ls.\nBut actually you do not need to set +x.

It seems to be related to the swap file usage/management.  Adam (from the bug link above) points out that if you turn your swap off, wait for it to process, before you shutdown the hang never happens.  When you are ready to shutdown your machine, open a terminal window and type;\nsudo swapoff -a\nWait for the command to process and give your prompt back then you should be able to perform normal shutdown.  This is working for many including me.\nend update\nIf the shutdown or reboot has hanged with this message Reached target Shutdown\nTry Sysrq\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down the Alt and SysRq (Print Screen) keys.\n\n*While holding those down, type the following keys in order, several\nseconds apart: REISUB\n\n*Computer should reboot.\n\n\nYou can also try the following after it hangs.\nsee if you can login tty1 and reboot\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+F1 or Ctrl+Alt+F2 or Ctrl+Alt+F3 ...\n\n*Write your username (lowercase, the name of the user folder in\n/home) and hit Enter\n\n*Write your password (nothing will appear) and hit Enter\n\n\nIf your password and username are correct, you are now logged in.\nIf that fails try Ctrl+Alt+Del a couple times at that point in the tty1 screen\nYou might see a message that states the machine is going to reboot and then it should do just that after a minute or so.\nIts better than a hard boot - until its fixed\nIn the bug notes it is reported that you can upgrade to Vivid-Proposed and it fixes the issue but some still see this after that upgrade.

I've done this successfully on a raspberry pi running Raspbian-Wheezy, and another headless Ubuntu 14.04 server.\nFor both the successful attempts and this latest unsuccessful attempt I've been following the directions in this guide.\nInstall Dropbear/busybox:\nsudo apt-get install busybox dropbear\n\nCopy generated ssh keys to client:\nsudo cp /etc/initramfs-tools/root/.ssh/id_rsa ~/id_rsa_dropbear\nsudo scp ~/id_rsa_dropbear client@client:~/.ssh/id_rsa_dropbear\n\nSince my client is a windows client running cygwin, change permissions on new key:\nchgrp Users ~/.ssh/id_rsa_dropbear\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa_dropbear\n\nDropbear automatically appends the public key to authorized_keys file on key generation.  Created crypt_unlock.sh script as stated in above link, made executable:\nsudo vi /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/crypt_unlock.sh\nsudo chmod +x /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/crypt_unlock.sh\n\nUpdate initramfs:\nsudo initramfs-update -u\n\nReboot server, trying to SSH root@serverip asks for a key passphrase and then for the root user's password.  There is no passphrase for this key, I thought dropbear doesn't support encrypted keys?  What should happen is the key should be recognized and I should be at a busybox prompt, where I can type 'unlock' and then enter the encryption passphrase to unlock the root disk on the server.\nI can enter the encryption passphrase locally (when server is directly connected to a keyboard/monitor) and the server will boot correctly.  What I can't figure out is why dropbear isn't playing nice with the private key.  I've even tried manually recreating the private/public keys using the directions in the cryptsetup readme multiple times.  Dropbear is successfully starting with initramfs, it can be seen at the local passphrase prompt.\nIf anyone has any suggestions, it would be greatly appreciated.  I'm really flustered as like I said, I've done this twice before with zero issues.

The relevant lines from my fstab are:\n//192.168.1.110/Public /mnt/titanpublic cifs iocharset=utf8,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0\n//192.168.1.110/backups /mnt/titanbackups cifs iocharset=utf8,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0\n\nThe relevant lines from journalctl are:\nMay 06 11:28:11 Skyhawk-5 systemd[1]: Mounting /mnt/titanbackups...\nMay 06 11:28:11 Skyhawk-5 systemd[1]: Started Forward Password Requests to Plymouth.\nMay 06 11:28:11 Skyhawk-5 systemd[1]: Started Forward Password Requests to Plymouth.\nMay 06 11:28:12 Skyhawk-5 ntpdate[1193]: adjust time server 91.189.94.4 offset 0.327939 sec\nMay 06 11:28:13 Skyhawk-5 NetworkManager[848]: <info> WiFi hardware radio set disabled\nMay 06 11:28:13 Skyhawk-5 NetworkManager[848]: <info> WWAN hardware radio set enabled\nMay 06 11:29:42 Skyhawk-5 mount[1210]: Timed out\nMay 06 11:29:42 Skyhawk-5 systemd[1]: mnt-titanpublic.mount mounting timed out.

I have a network with 2 machines. machine A has IP 192.168.1.100 , machine B has\nIP 192.168.1.101. Now i want to resolve machine B IP address to test. I don't want to pass\nthrough a dns server. \nInstead I want to modify  /etc/hosts, /etc/resolv.conf ... so that when I type \"test\" on machine's A browser, I am directed to machine B . Is this approach feasible and if yes, how.\n\nA: Edit you /etc/hosts and below put like fallow\nsudo nano /etc/hosts\n127.0.0.1       localhost\n127.0.1.1       xxx.yyy.com        xxx\n\n# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts\n::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\nfe00::0 ip6-localnet\nff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix\nff02::1 ip6-allnodes\nff02::2 ip6-allrouters\n\n192.168.1.101    test\n\n\nA: You can do this by modifying Machine A's /etc/hosts file.\nOpen the file and add the following:\n192.168.1.101  test  \n\nNow you can reach Machine B by just using hostname test, you can also add an alias like:\n192.168.1.101  test  machine-b\n\nAlso make sure the /etc/nsswitch.conf file's hosts database lookup starts with the files data source. For example, in my computer:\nhosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns\n\nThis means that while doing hostname resolution the relevant files in the /etc directory will be checked first.\n", "Q: wifi problem after connecting to wired connection in kubuntu 15.04 A few days ago I installed Kubuntu 15.04 on my laptop. in first day I had no problem using WiFi at home but in my office I have no WiFi and I have to use a wired Ethernet cable to connect to the Internet and Kubuntu couldn't connect to wired connection!\nI searched and found this solution: adding two line of following commands to the /etc/network/interfaces file:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nand my problem with wired connection solved!\nbut a new problem was born!\nafter this, my WiFi disconnects every time after a few minutes!\nand when I remove that code it will be OK!\ncan anyone tell me how I can have WiFi and wired Internet together?\n\nA: You do not need to edit /etc/network/interfaces.\nWhen you connect to a wired network, just disable wireless in Network Manager. And wired network card will receive an ip address by dhcp.\nIt should work this way. \n", "Q: Unable to boot Live CD with hard drive attached I am attempting to fix an OS drive that had some problems after installing updates. The hard drive is currently not bootable. My main goal right now is just to get some data off this drive.\nI have a live CD which I am able to boot from when the hard drive is not attached. When I attach the hard drive however I get an error message after clicking \"Try Ubunutu before installing\".\nThe error message looks like this:\n[    14.071718] ata2: COMRESET failed (errno=-16)\n[    24.087575] ata2: COMRESET failed (errno=-16)\n\nBusyBox v1.22.1 (Ubuntu 1:1.22.0-8ubunutu1) built-in shell (ash)\n\n(initramfs) Unable to find a medium containing a live file system\n\nAny thoughts on how I can get into this hard drive or what is keeping the Live CD from booting properly when the hard drive is connected?\n\nA: ACPI needs to be turned off during boot.  When booting to the LiveCD, before selecting Try Ubuntu without installing, press the F6 key for Other Options and select acpi=off.  Press ESC to exit the Other Options menu, and press Enter to continue the boot.\nFor further help about selecting Other Options from a live boot, refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions\n\nA: Before chosing \"Try ubuntu without installing\" press the letter's e key to edit the boot option. In the longest line add --noacpi and press F10. The LiveCD will boot fine.\n", "Q: Can not turn off GRUB Menu There seems to be a lot of info on the web on how to turn off grub menu on a dual boot system (Ubuntu 14.04/Windows7) and a whole lot of answers which all seem to end in \"It didn't work\"! \nIs there a way to do it???\nI have done all the things suggested and \"It didn't work\"!! APPARENTLY there is NO way to correct this problem currently.\n\nA: To hide the grub menu follow the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the terminal, type:\n\n\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n\n*Find the line that says:\n\n\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=false\nand change it to GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\n\n\n*Find the line that says:\n\n\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=<some number here, eg: 10>\nand change it to:\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=1\n\nThis will show the menu, but for just a second and after that it will boot the default entry. If it is set to 0, still you will see it for 10 seconds as a security measure. So put 1 there.\n\n\n*Save and close the file.\n\n*Run sudo update-grub\nTry and post back if there are any errors.\n", "Q: Dual Monitors Stayed Mirrored I am running a T450 with Intel HD Graphics 5500 with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nI am also using a Lenovo Ultra Dock that supports a DVI input and a VGA input. \nWhenever I connect two monitors to both the DVI and VGA to my dock, and when I dock my T450, the monitors are only mirroring one monitor. Ubuntu isn't even recognizing the other monitor in \"Displays\", but it is still mirroring everything from the opposite monitor. The monitor is working, I am seeing a picture, but \"Displays\" isn't allowing me to control anything.\nAny ideas?\nThank you so much!\nEdit: I think it would be nice to know, that the monitors are of the same model/brand.\n\nA: It may be worth a shot to upgrade your kernel to 3.17 as a user reported he was then able to get his dual monitors fixed with his T440P which also used Intel graphics.\n", "Q: Error when using command 'make' I get error whenever I'm trying to 'make' file, I did this before I typed 'make':\ntar xjf xarchiver-0.5.4.tar.bz2 \ncd ./xarchiver-0.5.4 \n./configure\n\nConfigure command: \nthomas@thomas-pc:~/Downloads/xarchiver-0.5.4$ ./configure\nchecking build system type... x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nchecking host system type... x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nchecking target system type... x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nchecking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c\nchecking whether build environment is sane... yes\nchecking for gawk... no\nchecking for mawk... mawk\nchecking whether make sets $(MAKE)... yes\nchecking whether to enable maintainer-specific portions of Makefiles... no\nchecking for style of include used by make...

Thank you in advance, any help with this would be much appreciated!\n\nA: In fact, buffering in UNIX depends on the context: when stdout is redirected to something interactive like a console - it is usually line-buffered, otherwise it is fully buffered.\nBuffering may be changed inside the application using setvbuf library call.\nBut it can also be done with stdbuf command on launch:\nExecStart=/usr/bin/stdbuf -oL /opt/foo/.cabal-sandbox/bin/foo\n\n(for line-buffered case)\n\nA: By default on Ubuntu 15.04, systemd journals are only volatile and kept in /run/systemd/journal and are lost at each reboot. To use persistent systemd journal, you need to create the /var/log/journal directory (and restart systemd-journald.service).\nSo, may be, stdout output is just redirected to syslog and not kept in systemd journal. For that, you may need to use a persistent systemd journal as explained above.\nHave you checked /var/log/syslog for your foo log ?\n", "Q: How to get rid of templates folder I have a simple problem: Whenever I delete the templates folder in my home directory (/home/[username]/ in case that info is of use) it seems to come back.

I just want to browse randomly. I know of the software center, but maybe I'm not using it correctly. Is there a way to make IT display a simple list of every possible app? Is there some web page with them all on it? \n\nA: The apps website will show you everything Ubuntu Software Center has with the same categories.

Is there a separate file I should be looking at? I have no idea what else could be wrong.\n\nA: Normally, .bashrc is only sourced for interactive shells, but many linux distributions decide to build bash with a special option to also source it for non-interactive shells if a SSH_something variable is in the environment. However, it doesn't switch the shell to interactive mode when doing this, so the following case command near the top of the default .bashrc:\ncase $- in\n    *i*) ;;\n      *) return;;\nesac\n\nFinds that the shell is not interactive, so it returns. \nIf you put the PATH assignment above that block, it should work.

This question on apple support has all the links, but they are only accessible from OS X (if you had access to a live OS X at this point - you probably would've just used createinstallmedia already, right?). So, you'll need to find an alternative source.\n\n\n*Convert .dmg file to ISO (dmg2img -v -i <imagename>.dmg -o <isoname>.iso).\n\n\n*Mount .iso image. You can do it from GUI (right click, \"Open with disk image mounter\") or something like mount -o loop <isoname>.iso <iso_mount_point>\n\n\n*Find BaseSystem.dmg in the mounted image. Convert it to .iso as well (dmg2iso -i BaseSystem.dmg -o BaseSystem.iso)\n\n\n*Copy it to a thumb drive: dd if=BaseSystem.iso of=/dev/sdX BS=1M. In my case (High Sierra 10.13.6), 4Gb stick was sufficient, even though createinstallmedia requires 8Gb. It probably misses some utilities.\n\n\n*Mount the thumb drive (you might need to apt-get install hfsprogs to mount an HFS filesystem). From the first iso, obtained on step 3, copy BaseSystem.chunklist and BaseSystem.dmg on the thumb drive (actually, the latter might not be necessary - but it worked for me at this step and I stopped experimenting). sync, just in case.\nThis is it, you have a bootable OS X usb drive.\n", "Q: what are the issues if any when installing Ubuntu only OS on a 2009 MacBook pro I have recently purchased a MacBook pro cause I like the way it is built...but only want Ubuntu to run it. are there drivers and such to make it all work right?\n\nA: You do not need any extra drivers.

It's true that I did not understand the difference between sudo apt-get upgrade and do-release-upgrade. Thanks for explaining this point.\nTo clarify my process, Muon Update Manager could not download any data, regardless of the settings I used, and believe me, I tried them all.\nSo I decided to work exclusively in Terminal, which helps my understanding when things get a bit complicated.\nInitially, I tried do-release-upgrade, which gave an error message.\n\nIn order to perform sudo apt-get update, I needed to set `Prompt=normal.\n\nI researched this online, and similar to the experience of others, at least in 13.10, sudo apt-get update would not run, with Prompt=lts.

As there were only four entries, all for third-party apps I don't really need, I ended up deleting them all, i.e., sources-list.d is now empty.\nWhen I looked at sources-list, I discovered it was a real mess (created by Update Manager), with several duplicate entries, a few bastardized entries, and archives from different locations.

You've been very helpful. I have three follow-up questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Given what I've now explained, do you still recommend running do-release-upgrade.\n\n*For my edification, based on what I've now explained, what would sudo apt-get upgrade do?\n\n*My desire is to upgrade to 14.04 while keeping the app that was installed remotely in tact. Which of these methods, if either, will accomplish this?\nAgain, much appreciated. Look forward to your response. :)\n\nA: \nIn order to perform \"sudo apt-get update\", I needed to set \"Prompt=normal\".\n\nYou seem to be confusing apt-get update with upgrading your version of Ubuntu.  apt-get update just updates APT's list of available software versions for your current Ubuntu version, it does not change your Ubuntu version.\nPrompt=normal has no effect on a normal call to apt-get update.\n\n\"sudo apt-get update\" completed successfully (after much tweaking of existing repos in sources.list.d and sources.list).\n\nWhat tweaking?  Did you tweak these and if so, how?  You should not have to do this to upgrade Ubuntu, just run do-release-upgrade.  Depending on how you have modified sources.list, you may find yourself unable to do a apt-get upgrade (or dist-upgrade) properly and may even break your system.  Hopefully do-release-upgrade can still sort it out for you, but pay attention to what it is doing.\n\nI am concerned that running \"sudo apt-get upgrade\" now will take me all the way to 14.10, which I do not want.\n\nThat all depends on what you did to sources.list or sources.list.d, which you don't mention.  It would still be worth running do-release-upgrade at this point, as that will not only find out what version you can upgrade to, but it will handle the updating of sources.list for you if you choose to proceed.  Hopefully the changes you've made to sources.list already will not interfere with it.\nDo NOT run apt-get upgrade (or dist-upgrade) at this point if you have messed with your sources.list and are not sure if you will break your system.  You don't want it to try and upgrade direct from 13.10 to 14.10 and skip the version in between, because attempting to do that is likely to cause serious problems.  Ff you use do-release-upgrade to do the upgrade instead, and don't mess with sources.list, it won't try and do something silly like that.\n\nWill changing update-manager back to \"Prompt=lts\" at this point, ensure I get 14.04, or will that even work now that the \"trusty\" files have been downloaded?\n\nIf you are on 13.10, then it will not matter whether you have lts or normal, because either way the next version, and the version that do-release-upgrade will recommend, is 14.04.  However, it will affect whether an upgrade to 14.10 is offered the next time you run do-release-upgrade after you have upgraded to 14.04 (or check for upgrades in the desktop interface).\n\nYour follow-ups:\n\nGiven what I've now explained, do you still recommend running do-release-upgrade.\n\nYes.  I'm fairly confident it'll still work, but if you can easily revert the changes you did to sources.list first, or at least revert to a basic sources.list with only the regular saucy sources, then I'd do so.\nNote that your current sources.list only includes main and restricted, and omits universe and multiverse, which effectively omits a huge amount of software.  Unless you have a reason not to include them (particularly universe) I'd put them back in.\n\nFor my edification, based on what I've now explained, what would sudo apt-get upgrade do?\n\nIt would upgrade some packages to the version in Trusty.  Note that apt-get dist-ugprade would upgrade even more.  In theory, this is how upgrades to new releases work in Debian (which is where this system comes from), but Ubuntu has its own upgrade procedure housed in do-release-upgrade which takes some additional steps and is a little more fool-proof and is therefore the recommended way to upgrade to a new Ubuntu release.  For example, it does things like notify you about software that does not have an equivalent in the new release.\n\nMy desire is to upgrade to 14.04 while keeping the app that was installed remotely in tact. Which of these methods, if either, will accomplish this?\n\ndo-release-upgrade would be preferred.\n\nA: You can run apt-get upgrade command.

The icon that is displayed in that directory for the Pale Moon program is a simple grey box which when dragged to the gnome launcher bar appears with a question mark on it.  Of course, it does run the program. \nThere is the appropriate \"pretty\" blue icon, Mozicon128.png in the path /opt/palemoon25.1.0/browser/icons/. Is there a way to replace the box with the question mark on the launcher bar with the Mozicon128.png icon?\n\nA: I had the same problem with the icon, and then I found well-maintained repositories for Ubuntu (including kubuntu, lubuntu, etc.) 12.04 - 16.04 14.04 – 18.04 at opensuse. So I followed the instructions to completely de-install Pale Moon, then I added the repository and re-installed with apt-get.

(Note that it's a little 'x' with a capital 'U' because it it doesn't mean 'xubuntu'; the 'x' is a like a wildcard, so it means any Ubuntu.) Also add the key (with appropriate release number):\nsudo wget http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:stevenpusser/xUbuntu_14.04/Release.key\nsudo apt-key add - < Release.key  \n\nVoila!

I want a separate  partition on my SSD (about 10 GB or so) since I re-install often. I want to be able to put things that are really important to me that I don't want to upload to the cloud. I would like it to be accessible by windows as well. If I could encrypt it, that would be nice too.\n\nA: There is no way to stop the root user (sudo) from doing all and everything with drives attached to our computer. This includes deleting files, formatting partitions, and partitioning drives.\nThere are means to protect files on a partition from being accidentally overwritten by mounting it as read-only in Ubuntu but this alone will of course not stop Windows, and it will not stop Root to remount the drive with write access. We can even hide a partition but it will not be accessible then and as soon as we try to re-partition it this will be gone too.\nWhile installing any OS we inevitably need to be Root. We then will always be able to partition and format all drives attached to our computer, hence will also be able to delete all data with a single bad command.\nTherefore the only means to protect our data is performing regular backups on an external drive that will not be attached to our computer on installing any OS. This backup should always be made before we install anything, or re-partition.\nFor data in the GB rather than the TB range such an external storage could also be a pen-drive or an SD-card we can write protect with a hardware switch, provided the hardware switch was read correctly by the new OS (which sadly appears to not always be the case).\n", "Q: Screen dimming doesn't work (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) I have an Asus laptop (G53SW), on which I installed Ubuntu 12.04 (because I had it laying around) which upgraded itself to 14.04LTS.\nFor the most part it works well but the one annoying issue is that I can't dim the screen at all. Moving the slider or toggling the checkbox does nothing at all.\nI have found this previous question and tried the solution involving editing the grub file but that did not help as after making the change and running sudo update-grub the slider still had no effect.\nI also found this page but not only did I not have the \"Graphics\" section mentionned in the post, when I ran: ls /sys/class/backlight what I got back was acpi_video0  acpi_video1, also the post seems to mention this only works for integrated video cards but my laptop has a GTX 460M (for which I'm fairly certain I installed the drivers).\nHow do I go about restoring the screen dimming functionality?\n\nA: You have an outdated or incompatible proprietary driver for your card. Open the Additional Drivers program and check for new drivers. Select the newest one, apply and reboot.\n", "Q: Installing Nvidia Drivers: open source vs proprietary I have a fresh installation of Ubuntu 14.04.2, and now I want to start using Nvidia's official drivers, rather than the Nouveau drivers that come as default with Ubuntu. So, on the Nvidia website, I found which driver is needed for my graphics card, which is version 346. I ran sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa to update the repository, and then sudo apt-get install nvidia-346 to install the Nvidia driver.\nNow, if I open Ubuntu Software Centre and go to Additional Drivers, it lists six drivers: five Nvidia drivers, and one Nouveau driver (which is currently selected). The Nvidia drivers are nvidia-331, nvidia-331-updates, nvidia-340, nvidia-346, and nvidia-349.\nI have two questions:\n1) Seeing as I only told Ubuntu to install nvidia-346, why has it also installed all of these other Nvidia drivers (331, 340 and 349)?\n2) All the Nvidia drivers, except for nvidia-331-updates, are described as \"open source\". However, nvidia-331-updates is described as \"proprietary\". Why are these drivers open source, when I thought that all official Nvidia drivers would be proprietary, and only Nouveau would be open source?\nThank you!\n\nA: \nSeeing as I only told Ubuntu to install nvidia-346, why has it also installed all of these other Nvidia drivers (331, 340 and 349)?\n\nAdditional Drivers lists every possible driver that your system is known to be able to use. It doesn't mean that it's installed, but rather that it's available and (likely) works with your hardware.\nYou can see what NVIDIA drivers and support packages you've actually installed using this command:\ndpkg --get-selections | grep nvidia\n\nFor example, note the discrepancy on my system:\n\n\nAll the Nvidia drivers, except for nvidia-331-updates, are described as \"open source\". However, nvidia-331-updates is described as \"proprietary\". Why are these drivers open source, when I thought that all official Nvidia drivers would be proprietary, and only Nouveau would be open source?\n\nThis appears to be a bug with drivers added from a PPA. Note, again, that the nvidia-370 driver is listed as \"open-source\" even though it's very much not. This is because my driver comes from a PPA, and apparently didn't have the attached metadata (or similar) that marked the as proprietary. The only open-source driver is the actual Nouveau driver.\n\nA: *\n\n*The list you're seeing in Additional Drivers is not necessarily drivers that you have installed, just drivers that are available for you (which Ubuntu believes would be compatible with your hardware).  It will install them on demand if you choose one and it's not installed.\n\n*All those nvidia- packages are in restricted, so none of them should be listed as open source.  I'd say that's a mistake.  It's possible that it's because the ones showing as \"open source\" are actually showing the ones from the PPA you added and Ubuntu doesn't have a way of knowing whether those are open source, but that would be pure speculation.\n", "Q: Programs opening but not visible OS: ubuntu 14.04 LTS\nProcessor: Intel® Core™2 CPU 6320 @ 1.86GHz × 2 \nGraphics: Intel® 965Q\nOS type: 64-bit\n\nI have spent about a week researching a solution to my problem, which only occurred after upgrading from Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubuntu 14.04. Every article I have read online, has not resolved my issue. Neither has a fresh install from live CD. I am able to boot and login successfully but some programs activated (either from dash, launcher or terminal) are not available. These are programs like Gimp, System Monitor, and Gparted.\nEven when I have tried to re-burn my ISO file, my CD/DVD is not recognised in Startup Disk Creator. The brand is recognised, but says it only has 2MB of memory, when it has up to 4.7GB. I have tried different disks and all are recognised as only having 2MB of memory, even though the brand of the disk is proven to change. \nEverything only seems to work after a fresh install of the ISO (from live CD) and I re-install my back-up files. All programs work perfectly. Then I shut down or logout and into a new user, and that's when I can no longer access programs. I can open them through all the methods available, but the window doesn't open on desktop. The icon locks to the launcher as if the program is open, with the outline of a triangle, rather than the full triangle I get next to Firefox and Thunderbird, which I can always open without issue.\nFrom my research, the outline of a triangle next to the icon in launcher, means the program is open, but its at a different location. When I use Ctrl-Alt-Tab, I can see the window has clearly been activated as if it is operational, but I cannot access the window from my desktop. I only have one monitor, so the information is not being redirected to a second monitor, as I've read has been the case for some.\nUpon reading another article, I followed advice issuing commands in terminal (I cannot remember which command, I apologise) but the output was \"Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?\" This gave my first indication the system is perhaps operating under two identities, or my xsessions are not being executed properly, thus causing a misfire to home directory.\nI have tried creating a new user and installing my back-up files there, but the same problem occurs after logging out or shutting down. I have also tried installing kubuntu in an attempt to resolve issues which may be occurring in unity - but I have the same problem of the program opening, but no window making it accessible to the user.

I was going to install 15.04, but it was not able to install (it could only run in LiveCD mode). Surprisingly enough, some things that worked in 15.04 don't work in 14.10.\nThings that don't work in 14.10, but that did in 15.04:\n1. Touchscreen (goodix brand)\n2. ACPI (battery detection, power management)\nI can't just install Ubuntu 15.04, it won't install on my tablet (keeps freezing, randomly restarting). Is there any way I could take the working drivers that I need from Ubuntu 15.04, and put them into 14.10 without having to upgrade the entire kernel?\nAlso, anyone who knows where I can find the realtek rtl8723bs (WiFi/Bluetooth) drivers, that would be much appreciated, they don't come with any Ubuntu version yet.\n\nA: the wifi drivers (bt doesn't) are available and they must be compiled (so forget to \"intall & go\"), but it seems (i've understood into the nebulous galaxy of intel bay trail's obscure engineering) to have some problems with the kernel 3.18 of ubuntu 15.04 because on many different moatherboard can't enumerate correctly. \nThe reason could be the nature of the adapter, SDIO type, and all they have done for successful start is only on wifi side and without wpa supplicant (so open wifi only), almost until few weeks ago.\nThe best should be compile manually starting from sources of Ubuntu's kernel  14.10.\nSee on this link: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2249936\nand this:https://github.com/hadess/rtl8723bs/issues/10\nI'm sorry to be without a best solution but i'm in the same problem too and \nthere's no easy ways at the moment therefore many people is trying to solve and i'm sure soon there will be driver for a good ubuntu experience...\n\nA: I have the same tablet, Winbook TW100, and could never install 15.04 from the USB drive although 15.04 did work when running from the USB drive. So I installed 14.10 and ran it for a week. Today I tried a new approach and changed the software sources to look for upgrades (newer versions of Ubuntu) It found 15.04 and I was able to upgrade from 14.10 to 15.04 using the default ubuntu upgrade method on my TW100. I am still searching for more info to get everything else working but wanted to pass along what worked to get 15.04 running on the TW100.\n\nA: To install Ubuntu 15.04 and 15.10, add the following to the kernel line before booting the live system\nintel_idle.max_cstate=1 intel.pstate=disable\n\nThis will stop it from freezing and other weird stuff. \nAfter installation you need to add these lines to your systems kernel line. On some SoC versions you also need to add \"nomodeset\" and remove the \"gfxmode\" line. \nsed -i '/gfxmode \\\\\\$linux_gfx_mode/s/.*/echo \\-n/' <INSTALLATION>/etc/grub.d/10_linux\nsed -i '/GRUB_CMDLINE_DEFAULT=/s/\".*\"/\"intel_idle.max_cstate=1 intel.pstate=disable nomodeset\"/' <INSTALLATION>/etc/default/grub\n\nAnd you need to install a proper boot loader version\napt-get purge grub-efi-amd64 grub-efi-amd64-bin\napt-get install grub-efi-ia32 grub-efi-ia32-bin\ngrub-install --efi-directory=/boot/efi --boot-directory=/boot\nupdate-grub\n\nWhich of cause needs to be done from chroot.\nTo get the touchscreen to work a little better, I found the 4.3.3 mainline kernel to be a good choice for both 15.04 and 15.10.\nIf you like Gnome Shell, I would stick with Ubuntu 15.04.

I have done so but am not sure how to start Jack or check to see if it is running. I also don't know how to tell Rosegarden to use Jack for audio input and output. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: You can ignore the warnings about needing Jack running. \nWhat I now have running is MIDI file playback via Rosegarden and QSynth. \nThe process as of Ubuntu 17.10 is largely the same as here, but follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*install QSynth apt-get install fluidsynth\n\n*install a soundfont library apt-get install fluid-soundfont-gs\n\n*configure QSynth to Enable MIDI Input by checking the box in Setup > MIDI \n\n*configure QSynth to use alsa Audio Driver under Setup > Audio\n\n*configure QSynth to use the soundfont under Setup > Soundfonts; point to /usr/share/sounds/sf2/FluidR3_GM.sf2 or your soundfont location\n\n*allow QSynth to restart when it prompts you\n\n*install Rosegarden apt-get install rosegarden\n\n*with QSynth open, launch Rosegarden\n\n*Tell Rosegarden to play through QSynth Studio > Manage MIDI Devices and set the General MIDI Device to whatever QSynth broadcasts as its MIDI input option, ie 129:0 Synth input port or similar.\n\n\nA: Using RoseGarden (Jack method)\n\n*\n\n*Tested on Ubuntu Mate 20.04.1 x86_64, from the live CD.\n\n*This guide looks rather long but it's very screenshot heavy\n\n*This can be done almost entirely through the GUI after the initial setup is done, hopefully this will help people get more familiar with all the \"moving parts\" involved.\n\nPrerequisites\nsudo apt install rosegarden pulseaudio-module-jack qsynth\n\nA window showed up asking me if I wanted to run jackd with realtime priorities, I selected \"Yes\". I am not sure if this setup will work if I would have selected \"No\".\nConfiguring PulseAudio to work with Jack\nWhy this is necessary\n\n*\n\n*When you run Jack, it will pretty much take over the audio system on your OS.\n\n*Most of the sounds in Ubuntu (e.g., system sounds, your browser, etc.) use PulseAudio\n\n*If you want any program on your computer to make sounds while Jack is active, I suggest running this step.\n\n*There are other ways to work around this like having a second sound card, but this can get cumbersome (I can only wear one pair of headphones at a time)\n\nProcess\nRun these commands\npacmd load-module module-jack-sink\npacmd load-module module-jack-source\npacmd set-default-sink jack_out\n\n(it will run and end displaying no message)\nAt this point we need to start QSynth, but I think this is a good time to provide a bit of background information:\nQSynth\nWhat is QSynth\n\n*\n\n*QSynth is a GUI frontend to FluidSynth.\n\n*FluidSynth is a SoftSynth\n\n*A SoftSynth is basically a piece of software that interprets MIDI events as sounds.\n\n*A midi event is basically a note being played on a given instrument.\n\nSo basically QSynth is what actually \"makes the instrument noises\" to be played back through your speakers.\nWhat would somebody use instead of FluidSynth?\n\n*\n\n*There have been a lot of other output devices than a SoftSynth that can interpret MIDI events as sound\n\n*For example, the Roland MT-32 can accept MIDI events and play it in its own (built in to the hardware) soundfont.\n\n*If you had one of these devices, you could have Jack send MIDI output to one of these instead, e.g., over a MIDI cable or USB cable.\n\nSetting up QSynth\nFor me, this program is in Sound & Video -> QSynth.\nYou can also start it from command line, starting it with the qsynth command.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Setup... on the main window\n\n\n\n\n*Go to the soundfonts tab\n\n\n\n\n*Click Open to select a soundfont.\n\nThere are some soundfonts in /usr/share/sounds/sf2, you can use these, or provide your own.\nPersonally I selected FluidR3_GM.sf2 for this test for convenience's sake, because it appears to be downloaded with Fluidsynth but for my own use I use SGM-v2.0.1.sf2\nIn Ubuntu 19, a user LKTS points out that you may need to also do this step:\n\n\n*On the Audio tab, set the Audio Driver to \"jack\"\n\nClick OK, and let it restart the fluidsynth engine. You're done with QSynth but leave it open.\nJack\nWhat is Jack?\nJack stands for JACK Audio Connection Kit.\n\n*\n\n*If you are trying to search for documentation / help on this online something I would recommend searching for \"jack audio connection kit ...\"\n\n*There are quite a lot of unrelated search hits for \"jack\"\n\n*In this setup Jack is responsible for connecting our input (RoseGarden) to our output (QSynth)\n\nSetting up Jack\nThis tutorial will use QJackCtl. For me this program was found in Sound & Video -> QJackCtl, but you can also start it command line with qjackctl.\nThe main window of the UI will look like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Connect button to show connectable devices.\n\n\n*Expand All Nodes, your Audio tab should look something like this:\n\nNotes about the audio tab\n\n*\n\n*I didn't have to do anything here (it was wired up like this by default), but here's some information about this tab:\n\n*The \"PulseAudio JACK Sink\" inputs are connected to the \"system\" outputs (playback_1-6), you can think of these playback_# outputs as your speakers.\n\n*capture_1 and capture_2 represent my microphone.\n\n*qsynth left and right are also connected to my speakers, this is how we will hear the midi events (notes) being played through RoseGarden while we are composing.\n\n*If your audio tab is not set up correctly, you may not hear system sounds or Rosegarden sounds.\n\nALSA Tab: Connecting FluidSynth\n\n\n*Switch to the ALSA tab and expand all nodes, it should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n*Click and drag to connect a wire:\n\n\n*\n\n*from: 14:Midi Through/0:Midi Through Port-0 on the left\n\n*to 129:FLUID Synth (8169)/0:Synth input port (8169:0) on the right\n\nThe numbers on these entries may be different on your system.\nAfter you do that, it should look like this:\n\nWe're done in this window, close the connections window, but leave the Jack window open.\nStart RoseGarden\nFor me the menu entry was just in Sound & Audio -> RoseGarden\nIf for some reason it's not there, you can run it with just the rosegarden command.\n1. Configure Midi Devices\nIn the main menu, click Studio -> Manage MIDI Devices\nYour setup should look something like this:\n\n2. To test our setup, using the pencil tool, just draw a track somewhere\n\n3. Double click on that track\n4. Click to insert notes on the staff\nYou should hear piano sounds coming from your speakers when you click to insert a note.\n\nAdditional note: Drum tracks.\nThis is a bit off topic from the setup, but I figured I'd include it here.\n\n*\n\n*If you are adding a drum track, you should set the track to use the D channel.\n\nI guess the \"D\" stands for \"Drums\"?\n\n\n\n*Then you can right click on the track and use the Percusson Matrix Editor, which will give you a nice labeled interface so you can see which instrument is which.\n\nTesting PulseAudio\nAt this point I think it is a good idea to verify that the sound on your PC still works.\nYou should be able to go to a youtube video or play some music on your PC and it should work without shutting down Jack or closing RoseGarden.\nStarting RoseGarden after setup\nIf you want to start RoseGarden after the initial setup, here's what you need to do:\n\n*\n\n*Start QSynth\n\n*Start QJackCTL\n\n*Run these commands\n\npacmd load-module module-jack-sink\npacmd load-module module-jack-source\npacmd set-default-sink jack_out\n\n\n\n*Start RoseGarden\n\n", "Q: source of tcpdump outgoing requests I ran the following command:\nsudo tcpdump 'port 80' and src host 172.31.0.198 -w /tmp/http.log\n\nThis should have started tracking my outgoing activity on port 80 as that is my local address, then sent it to http.log.

(It gets restarted automatically, and in my experience that is enough to get it working again) To test if this works for you, run this from a terminal:\nsudo pkill wpa_supplicant\n\nIf that fixes things, then you may want to check out the script given in the link above.\nIf that doesn't help, one other thing to try: unload and reload iwldvm kernel module.\nsudo modprobe -r iwldvm && sudo modprobe iwldvm\n\nI used to have intermittent wifi problems that would be cleared up by doing the above. I \nWondering what the difference is between iwlwifi and iwldvm? I was too, and there's a good explanation here: \nIs iwlwifi or iwldvm or wext the wireless driver?\nThose are two pretty easy things to try.\nIf those don't work, here's a somewhat more involved approach from someone who has a similar sounding post-upgrade problem with the same iwlwifi driver: Unstable wireless with Intel 7260 + iwlwifi after upgrade to 15.04\nThis involves installing a newer mainline kernel package which requires a few steps and may lead to other problems as noted here: Should I upgrade to the \"mainline\" kernels?\nSo I would recommend trying the first two simpler fixes first.\n", "Q: How to connect from home PC to Virtualbox/KVM that hosted on Ubuntu server?

In the sound settings, there are 3 channels: Digital Output, Headphones, and Line Out. However, changing the audio on either Headphones or Line Out affects both the speaker volume and the headphone volume.\nOn Ubuntu 14.04, the channels had been Headphones, Digital Output, and Analog Output.

I prefer to do it via the terminal, but if there is a easy way to do it via the GUI it's also fine.\nMy shares are at /media/*sharename*\n\nA: It is not advisable to add a separate icon to the launcher, calling nautilus. The reason is that then the new icon will \"steal\" the arrow that you see when an application (in this case: a directory) is opened. The Unity launcher (in principle) only allows one icon at a time to represent an application.\nAdd a shortcut to the Files icon manually\nInstead, add the location to the existing nautilus icon, as described here.\nVia GUI\nAlternatively, if you'd like to do it via GUI, you could use a quicklist editor, much more convenient:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:vlijm/qle\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install qle\n\n\nI wouldn't mention my own stuff, but it fits the question.\nSince nautilus will be active possibly when you edit its launcher for the first time, you might have to log out/in the first time to see the result (The editor cannot refresh an icon if an application runs).\n\nA: you can use this tricky solution.\ncreate a launcher on your desktop using the old GUI dialog, run the command\ngnome-desktop-item-edit --create-new ~/Desktop\n\n\nNow In Name write the name of your launcher suppose ShareMount\nIn command entry write the command \nnautilus /media/share*\n\nThen press ok.\nNow you have create a .desktop launcher on your Desktop.\nTo put it on unity launcher easily drag and drop the .desktop file from desktop to unity launcher.\n", "Q: How to recover files, after Windows partition deleted (installing Ubuntu) \n*\n\n*Was running Windows 7 (64-bit).\n\n*Downloaded Ubuntu, and booted it from USB\n\n*Started installing Ubuntu OS.

If you were already installing ubuntu on the drive, likely some data will be lost but you should be able to recover most of what you had on there.\nDo not attempt recovery on the same disk by trying to install anything onto it such as an OS (because you only have one PC).

This is a special address meaning in effect \"any address\". If it were to bind to for example localhost or 127.0.0.1, you could only connect to it from the local machine, because 127.0.0.1 belongs to the loopback device. But with 0.0.0.0, the server's binding to lo, eth0 and any other network devices you might have.\nSo, your little server should be reachable from other machines in your network. That it is not indicates that something (other than your little server) prohibits it, maybe a firewall. You could check the state of port 8000 with nmap from another machine (you might need to install nmap). Say your little server is running on ip 192.168.0.1, the other machine is 192.168.2.101. Then you'd do from 192.168.2.101\nnmap -p 8000 192.168.0.1\n\nThe output should be something like\nPORT     STATE SERVICE\n8000/tcp open  http-alt\n\nIf the state is \"open\", the port is reachable and there's something listening there, so your little server should be reachable.\nIf the state is \"closed\", the port is reachable, but there's nothing listening there. In that case, maybe your server has terminated or you mixed up ip or port numbers.\nIf the state is \"filtered\", there's some kind of ip filtering firewall at play that keeps you from accessing your little server.\n", "Q: What cool features/applications are there to change the way ubuntu GUI interface looks and feels?

Thanks :)\n\nA: For first there is standard settings , go to the System settings and Personal box which have Appearance , where you can change theme , size of icons and wallpapers.\nHere you will find new icons and themes : Deviant Art\nIf you want more customize install with console Ubuntu Tweak:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nOr Unity Tweak Tools:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:freyja-dev/unity-tweak-tool-daily\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\n", "Q: QML Blinking animation I need a blinking animation for an icon, I did this so far:\nIcon{\n                    id: bigLike\n                    name: \"like\"\n                    color: \"white\"\n                    opacity: 0\n                    width: parent.width / 2.5\n                    height: parent.height / 2.5\n                    anchors.centerIn: parent\n                    PropertyAnimation { id: animationOne; target: bigLike;alwaysRunToEnd: true; property: \"opacity\"; to: 1; duration: 1000 }\n                    PropertyAnimation { id: animationTwo; target: bigLike;alwaysRunToEnd: true; property: \"opacity\"; to: 0; duration: 1000 }\n                }\n\nand here I start animatons:\nanimationOne.start()\nanimationTwo.start()\n\nBut Nothing happens.\nAfter changing parameters to this:\nPropertyAnimation { id: animationOne; target: bigLike;alwaysRunToEnd: true; property: \"opacity\"; to: 1; duration: 1000 }\nPropertyAnimation { id: animationTwo; target: bigLike;alwaysRunToEnd: true; property: \"opacity\"; to: 0.5; duration: 1000 }\n\nthe animation played and it changed the opacity to 0.5 without changing it to 1 first.\nSo it seems the problem is the animation calculate the final outcome and plays it.\nThe question is how to achieve the blinking animation ? \n\nA: I found a workaround, although it may not be the best way to do it but it works.\nfirst, animations should be changed to \nPropertyAnimation { id: animationOne; target: bigLike;alwaysRunToEnd: true; property: \"opacity\"; to: 1; duration: 500\n                        onStopped: animationTwo.start()}\nPropertyAnimation { id: animationTwo; target: bigLike;alwaysRunToEnd: true; property: \"opacity\"; to: 0; duration: 300 }\n\nthis way we are sure that the second animation (fading animation) starts after the completion of first animation.\nthe when starting animations we need to just start the first one:\nanimationOne.start()\n\n", "Q: How to edit the core dump pattern without disabling apport? Currently I have enabled core dumps by editing /etc/limits.conf and addig * soft core unlimited as well as using ulimit -c unlimited.\nBut the core_pattern is this:\nkernel.core_pattern = |/usr/share/apport/apport %p %s %c %P\n\nSo the core is transmitted to apport. I don't mind, and I don't want to mess with apport (I have a memory of something going wrong once when doing so), moreover apport nicely generates a core file in the directory of my binary when it crashes.\nIs there any way to edit the location where apport saves the core, or its file name (instead of a simple core)? Similar to what I could do by disabling apport and editing the core_pattern, but without disabling apport.\n\nA: You can edit the apport python file to do this. \nChanging the location of the core is straight forward:\ninstead of \ncore_path = os.path.join(cwd, 'core') \n\nyou can put\ncore_path = os.path.join('my_custom_path, 'core)\n\nthe name can also be changed in a similar manner i.e.\nfrom:\ncore_path += '.' + str(pid)\n\nto\ncore_path += '.' + str(my_custom_name) + '.' + str(pid)\n\nnote that if you want to add the binary name to the core file, you will have to pass it to apport using the core_pattern\ni.e something like\n|/usr/share/apport/apport %p %s %c %d %P %e\n\nNotice the %e above which passes the executable name to the apport script\nRemember to restart the apport service after making a change in the script\n\nA: Replying late to OP but maybe this will help someone else. \nI was trying to do something similar, enable core dumps on startup using a systemd service (in case settings were changed by another developer/deployment).\nI also got stuck with apport overwriting the core_pattern:\nkernel.core_pattern = |/usr/share/apport/apport %p %s %c %P\n\nSince I didn't want to disable apport, I was able to bypass the apport path by just triggering my service after apport:\n[Unit]\nDescription=Enable Core Dumps\nAfter=apport\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/usr/bin/enable_core_dump.sh\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nThen from the bash script I could change core dump location and naming convention.\n\nA: I found a better way to do this as making changes to apport means that every time we upgrade apport we will have to add in our changes.\nLinux allows you to provide a shell script as the program to execute every time a core is generated. Inside this core file, you can call apport as always and then do your custom stuff. This includes changing the name and location of the core file.\nTo find the path of the core generated by apport, you can use the following\ncore_dir=realpath '/proc/$1/cwd'\n\n", "Q: Error processing package Likewise-open whenever I try updating/upgrading/installing I get this:\nSetting up likewise-open (6.1.0.406-0ubuntu5) ...\nError: /usr/sbin/lwsmd --start-as-daemon returned 1 (aborting this script)\ndpkg: error processing package likewise-open (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n likewise-open\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\n\nA: likwwise-open has been rebranded, and removed from official repositories.

GIMP unfortunately isn't. And it's also difficult to use a software that has a different GUI for me after so many years spent inside Photoshop.\n\nA: Krita is a creative sketching and painting application based on Calligra technology.\n\nKrita is a KDE program for sketching and painting, offering an end–to–end solution for creating digital painting files from scratch by masters.\nsudo apt-get install krita\n\nBut for a note, you can't find anything same as Photoshop.

The question is better made to Adobe --- they are the ones who can decide to ship it or not. \nI understand your problem (I too need some Windows-only software for my work too). So the options you have are: \n\n\n*\n\n*Pest Adobe to release a version for Linux; \n\n*Use a quite powerful machine and use a virtual machine for photoshop (I use it for a photobook software I need);\n\n*Try to see if things like wine or crossover can help;\n\n*Get used to a different workflow (I am quite happy with darktable + gimp when needed) \n", "Q: How to check architecture needs before installing Ubuntu? I am planning on installing Ubuntu on my computer that already has windows on it. I have a x64 based processor and windows is also in 64 bit operating system.\nBy using the uname -mcommand in the Ubuntu OS I get that it is x86_64 which I am guessing means that the Ubuntu I want to install also is a 64 bit operating system.\nI have created an additional 20GB partition so all that is done too.\nIs there anything else I should check before I install it or should it be fine to go ahead?\n\nA: I am sure you are good to go. Just for reference you can see this link that lists the requirements for installing Ubuntu. \nTo install Ubuntu alongside Windows have a look at the official docs (and if you have Windows 8, look at this tutorial also). There are plenty of resources out there on this topic.\nSo, enjoy Ubuntu!\n", "Q: Multiple sftp users and access to a /var/www subdirectory I have some users on my Ubuntu server with vsftpd installed.\nThe server is used as web server and has a shared sftp directory that is accessed by public clients (by giving them the user and password).\nDue to that architecture, my goal was to restrict the public client user to access his home directory only and restrict the access to the other directorys. I did it using ChrootDirectory as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*create the public user: public_sftp with the home dir: /home/public_sftp/\n\n*/home/public_sftp is owned by root\n\n*Inside /home/public_sftp, there are two dirs owned by public_sftp:www-data\n\n*create a group sftponly\n\n*add the public_sftp in the sftponly group\n\n*Change the /etc/ssh/sshd_config and add at the end\nMatch group sftponly\n    ChrootDirectory %h\n    X11Forwarding no\n    AllowTcpForwarding no\n    ForceCommand internal-sftp -u 73\n\nThis works perfectly fine, except for a script that I need to run from another server using www-data user.

They allow a finer-grained permission model compared to the user:group:other model. I have found them to be easier to keep straight in my head since I can be more explicit and can also set the \"default\" behavior for a branch of the file system.\nFor example, you can specify each user's permissions explicitly:\nsetfacl -Rm d:u:userA:rwX,u:userA:rwX /var/www\nsetfacl -Rm d:u:userB:rwX,u:userB:rwX /var/www\n\nOr you can do it based on some shared group:\nsetfacl -Rm d:g:groupA:rwX,u:groupA:rwX /var/www\n\nAnd perhaps you want to keep your web server user as read-only\nsetfacl -Rm d:u:www-data:rX,u:www-data:rX /var/www\n\nMan pages:\nhttp://linux.die.net/man/1/setfacl\nhttp://linux.die.net/man/1/getfacl\nhttps://websistent.com/linux-acl-tutorial/\n", "Q: ClamAv Installation problem Error ERROR: initgroups() failed I get the following error installing VlamAc on my Ubuntu Server 14.04:\nERROR: initgroups() failed. when starting ClamAv Daemon\n\n\nA: This error has been known to appear sometimes when clamav-daemon loads incorrectly.

If you are really interested you can read the Debian Policy Manual also.\nTo answer your questions:\n\n*\n\n*X is the Debian version of the package.\n\n\n*ubuntuY is the Yth Ubuntu version of the Debian package.\nTo quote verbatim from the first link, package-XubuntuY means:\n\n\n*\n\n*package = this is the name of the program/library.\n\n\n*X = this is the debian version of the package\n‐ if X=0 this means that there is no debian package (or that the ubuntu team has forked a debian package to a newer version than the one found in the debian repositories)\nex: bzip2-1.0.3-0ubuntu2\n(as shown in this example the debian package might be updated in the meantime and the ubuntu package will probably merged with it on the next version)\n\n\n*ubuntuY = this is the Yth ubuntu version of the debian package.\n‐ if this is missing this mean that it is a clean, unchanged debian package\nex: gzip-1.3.5-12\n(in this sample, this is the original debian package included in ubuntu)\n‐ if this is present it means that Ubuntu has taken the debian package and released it with some additional patches or bug fixes.\nex: sudo-1.6.8p12-1ubuntu6\n(in this sample this is the 6th version of the ubuntu package based on the debian version 1.6.8p12-1 of sudo).\n\n", "Q: Remove upstart option from GRUB For each Kernel I use with my 15.04 install I have three options in GRUB:\n\n\n*\n\n*normal (systemd)\n\n*upstart\n\n*recovery\n\n\nHow can I remove the upstart option for all my Kernels?\n\nA: There are several ways you may wish to approach this one, I have tried to be complete as possible and hope that one of these solves your problem.\nIs it needed?\nOn systems up to at least 16.04, yes, you need Upstart if you want to log in. \nBut if you are completely sure that you don't need upstart at all, just uninstall it:\nsudo apt-get purge upstart\n\nthat will cause it to be removed from automatically from the menu too\nIn the case that you NEED upstart (probably something that depends on it) and want it still around but not to start up your system, you can get rid of the entry manualling by editing your grub configuration files. There are two ways of going about it (first one being the more dangerous of the two).\nTemporary Removal\nYou can edit the /boot/grub/grub.cfg for TEMPORARY removal (regenerating with grub-mkconfig will UNDO this change). Remove the menu_entry block that bears the names Ubuntu ....... (upstart) { .. many lines .. }.1\nPreferred Removal\nThe annoying upstart entry is generated because of a single variable inside the /etc/grub.d/10_linux template file, which is what you should edit. The variable in question is called SUPPORTED_INITS and is set very close to the beginning of the file. If you want to get rid of support for starting upstart, you must remove it from here.\nChange this:\nSUPPORTED_INITS=\"sysvinit:/lib/sysvinit/init systemd:/lib/systemd/systemd upstart:/sbin/upstart\"\n\nTo This:\nSUPPORTED_INITS=\"sysvinit:/lib/sysvinit/init systemd:/lib/systemd/systemd\"\n\nThen you need to rebuild your boot configuration file from the template you just edited1:\nsudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nBackup Your Changes\nWhen making these changes, make a backup of the file you are changing, and put it in a safe place like a ~/Documents directory or something to ensure that a package manager operation doesn't accidentally delete it. If that is too much work, just make a copy of the line you are changing, and comment it out (of course in the case of grub.cfg, grub-mkconfig would overwrite those changes the next time it was run.\n\n1You should always check your script after changing it to verify it will run. You can use grub-script-check /boot/grub/grub.cfg to ensure there are no syntax errors in your script after editing or generating a new one, and definitely before rebooting.\n\nA: What about Grub Customizer?

This also means that I can't load anything in the home folder (Documents, downloads, etc) in the GUI OR the terminal.\nAny advice is appreciated. Not sure what to do at this point. The files are not mine and if I can't recover them I might die. Thanks.\n\nA: The simplest solution would be to move the files to a different directory. That way, at least your $HOME will load. Open a terminal and run these commands:\nmkdir jpeg-dir\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f -iname '*jpg' -or -iname '*jpeg' -exec mv {} jpeg-dir +\n\nThat will move all files whose name ends in jpg, jpeg, JPEG, JPG etc, to ~/jpeg-dir. That should let you load your home directory normally. \nHowever, this means that you'll now have trouble seeing the jpeg-dir directory. So, now that you have everything in ~/jpeg-dir, you can create sub-directories, each of which holds, for example, 5000 files:\ncd ~/jpeg-dir\njpegs=(*)\nc=0; \nfor((i=0;i<${#jpeg[@]};i+=1500)); do \n    let c++ \n    mkdir -p dir\"$c\"\n    mv \"${jpegs[@]:$i:1500}\" dir\"$c\"\ndone\n\n\nA: What is happening is that the filemanager is creating a list (with ls) and that is going to take a long long time when there are lots of files.\nSo 1st thing to do is to clean up /home/$USER/. Go into console mode.\ncd ~\nmkdir tmp\n\nThis will create a tmp directory in your /home/$USER/. \nNow do an ls -l | more and press enter to get an idea about what naming these files have; in general those files will have a specific extension. Let's assume that they all end in *.ext (replace to what you need in the command below). Then move all those files over to ~/tmp/ with: \n echo !(*.ext) | xargs mv -t ~/tmp/\n\nBe careful what you type at (*.ext) and make sure you do have it include anything that should stay in /home/$USER/. \nThat will get you a working Desktop and /home/. If you do an ls inside ~/tmp/ you will still run into problems. \n\n2nd part of the problem. Easiest method would be to have a script put all those files into subdirectories: this answer on SO seems to be perfect for this.\n", "Q: Advanced text replacement How can I replace a text in all files in all subfolders when my search includes \"*\"\nfor example I have many text files containing such pattern (some wrong paths that I want to correct)\n/folder1/(abc)/params.launch\n/folder2/(efd)/gui.launch\n/folder3/(ghi)/robot.launch\n\nNow I want to add /launch before each file to have such a result \n/folder1/(abc)/launch/params.launch\n/folder2/(efd)/launch/gui.launch\n/folder3/(ghi)/launch/robot.launch\n\nI thought about searching for the string pattern \n\n\")/*.launch\"\n\nbut then how can I replace it while keeping the content of those \"*\"\n\nA: Should be fairly simple with sed:\nsed 's;\\([^/]*.launch$\\);launch/\\1;'\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You can group matched text by surrounding the expression in brackets (\\( ... \\)). You need to escape the parentheses to make sed see them as special syntax.\n\n*The groups can be referred to using the position - the first group is \\1, the second is \\2, etc.\n\n\nExample output:\n$ sed 's;\\([^/]*.launch\\);launch/\\1;' foo   \n/folder1/(abc)/launch/params.launch\n/folder2/(efd)/launch/gui.launch\n/folder3/(ghi)/launch/robot.launch\n\nThis is for Basic Regular Expressions. For Extended Regular expressions, one can use sed -r, in which case the parentheses need not be escaped:\nsed -r 's;([^/]*.launch);launch/\\1;'\n\nLastly, in sed, and some other tools, the complete matched text can be referred to using &, avoiding the need for groups and backreferences altogether:\nsed 's;[^/]*.launch;launch/&;' foo\n\n\nA: Using bash:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n  ini=\"${line%/*}\"\n  last=\"${line##*/}\"\n  repl=\"${line##*.}\"\n      echo \"${ini}/${repl}/${last}\"\ndone <file.txt\n\nOutput :\n/folder1/(abc)/launch/params.launch\n/folder2/(efd)/launch/gui.launch\n/folder3/(ghi)/launch/robot.launch\n\nHere we have used the parameter substitution of bash to have three variables:\n\n\n*\n\n*The ini variable will contain the part before last / e.g. /folder1/(abc)\n\n*The last variable will contain the part after last / e.g. params.launch\n\n*The repl variable will contain what to be put inside the ini and last variables i.e. launch\nThen we have printed the values of the variables in the specified pattern puting / between them.\n", "Q: External monitor is disabled after resume (only on 15.04) I recently installed ubuntu 15.04 and most things just work out of the box, awesome!\nBut there is on annoying thing: I have an external screen connected to my machine (T450s, via docking station) and after resuming from suspend, my external monitor is disabled.\nAfter some trial and error I made an interesting observation: The external monitor only stops working if suspend via systemctl suspend, sudo pm-suspend, or via the hotkey on my keyboard (K750).\nHowever, this problem does not occur if I suspend via the menu entry in the upper right corner.\nHow is this even possible?\nMapping the suspend command from the upper right corner to a hotkey would be a sufficient workaround.

PPP may require\n     kernel support for MPPE, which may require patching your\n     kernel.\n  \n*verify that the pppd program is in the /usr/sbin/ directory.\nOn some distributions, it is in /usr/bin, or somewhere else.\nIf it isn't in the default directory, edit the Makefile, and\nchange the PPPD variable to point at the pppd program.\n\nYou may even want to run a separate pppd program with MPPE\nsupport.\n\n  \n*compile\nType 'make'.  This should generate the 'pptp' executable.\n\n  \n*install binaries\nType 'make install' to have the program and the manual page\n  installed.\n\n", "Q: Cant install libsdl2-dev or cmake glfw.. (libxinerama-dev problem) So I was going to continue learning Opengl after switching to Ubuntu,\nI tried this explanation to compile glfw and use it, but I got this:\n-- Using X11 for window creation\n-- Using GLX for context creation\nCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:268 (message):\n  The Xinerama library and headers were not found\n\n\n-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!\n\nThis is the CMakeError.log and this is the CMakeOutput.log.\nOk, after failing at glfw, I moved on to libsdl2:\nsudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev\n\nAnd the result (shocking..):\nSome packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have\nrequested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable\ndistribution that some required packages have not yet been created\nor been moved out of Incoming.\nThe following information may help to resolve the situation:\n\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n libsdl2-dev : Depends: libxinerama-dev but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nWhat can I do?\nI tried this:\nsudo apt-get install libxinerama-dev\n\nThe result I get is this:\nSome packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have\nrequested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable\ndistribution that some required packages have not yet been created\nor been moved out of Incoming.\nThe following information may help to resolve the situation:\n\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n libxinerama-dev : Depends: libxinerama1 (= 2:1.1.3-1) but 2:1.1.3-1+b1 is to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I also ran into same problem while installing the glfw lib. This is how I solved it:\n\n*\n\n*I navigated into my home directory using:\ncd ~\n\n\n\n*I then ran:\nsudo apt-get install libxinerama-dev\n\n\n\n*I navigated again to the directory of glfw and ran:\ncmake -G \"Unix Makefiles\"\n\n\n\n*This time the error was xcursor lib not found. So I repeated the above steps and installed the xcursor lib with:\nsudo apt-get install libxcursor-dev\n\n\n\n*After this I navigated back to the glfw  directory and the cmake command was successful.\n", "Q: Windows flash player I have a game that requires windows flash for Firefox to play, I installed flash for Firefox 17 but when I check version it says Linux 11 still and game cant detect it so how can I get the game to detect the windows flash player?\n\nA: So that you may retain your ubuntu specific firefox and flashplugin installation for purposes other than running that particular game, I suggest you install the windows version of firefox and adobe flashplugin using wine. To do this, run the following commands in an open terminal:\nmkdir FF; cd FF\nsudo apt-get update\nwget https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/firefox/releases/37.0.2/win32/en-US/Firefox%20Setup%2037.0.2.exe\nsudo apt-get install p7zip-rar\n7z e Fire*\n\nIt may ask you if you would like to overwrite a file; press u to rename the file and then run the following commands:\nwine setup.exe\n\naccept the basic options but decline to \"make firefox your default browser\" and keep the option to \"automatically start firefox\" at the end. After firefox starts up for the first time, close firefox.\nNext, run the following commands to install adobe flash on your windows version of firefox:\nwget https://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/pdc/17.0.0.169/install_flash_player.exe\nwine install_flash_player.exe\n\nfollow the instructions accepting the default options and accept the licensing agreement if the installer asks you to do so.\nThere should be a firefox icon on your desktop, click the icon to run the windows version of firefox and don't forget to go to settings > addons > plugins to enable the flashplugin.\n\nA: You could use pipelight to install the windows version of Flash. It will co-exist with your linux version so you can choose depending on your needs which to use.\nInstructions on the website are very clear and easy to follow.\nPipelight also makes other plugins like Unity and Silverlight (and more) available to Linux users.\n", "Q: Way to skip, pause songs rhythmbox when screen locked? How can I skip a song when the screen is locked?  I use the short cut keys when its not locked, and I hate having to log back in when screen is locked just to skip a song. \n\nA: You can try using GDM as a lockscreen instead lightdm, it features music controls on the lockscreen when music is playing, like on a android phones lockscreen. \nHowever I don't know if keyboard shortcuts will work as the lockscreen is supposed to prevent anyone using the computer while it is locked, so keyboard access to the desktop may be locked out.\nInstall it\nsudo apt-get install gdm\n\nStart it\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm \n\nStop lightdm, so you don't have two lockscreens\nsudo service lightdm stop\n\nIf the music controls don't show\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver show-notifications true\n\nTo switch back to lightdm\n sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm && service gdm stop\n\n", "Q: KDE hangs after login if rebooting from Windows in a dual-boot computer I run a dual-boot computer with(Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04, over which I have installed KDE 4.13.3.\nAfter booting on Windows, the first time I try to log in to KDE, KDE hangs on splash window after KDM login.\nIf I restart the computer and try to log in to KDE again, it doesn't hang anymore, until I boot on Windows again.\n\nA: You probably have \"UTC=yes\" on the file /etc/default/rcS.\nWhen you log in to KDE, it sets the KDE time to the correct local time, and changes the BIOS time to the UTC time. When you log in to Windows, it sets Windows time to the correct local time, and changes the BIOS time to the local time.\nFor some reason, the first time you log in to KDE, having the local time (instead of the UTC time) on the BIOS make KDE hang. However, this boot on Ubuntu (and/or log in to KDE) is enough to change the BIOS time back to the local time. Then, if you restart the computer and try to log in to KDE again, you don't have the problem anymore.\nI can't tell why having the BIOS time set to local time make KDE hang, but here is a solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*make Ubuntu/KDE interpret BIOS time the same way that Windows does: it should be set to local time. To do this, edit the file  /etc/default/rcS and replace \"UTC=yes\" by \"UTC=no\".\n\n\nThis solution worked for me (in fact, the question was just a way of sharing the solution found), but bear in mind that I have tried it during Daylight Saving Time (DST) from a place where the local time is UTC+0 when we are not in DST. Since I have not tried it outside the DST period, I am not sure I did correctly by interpreting the times as \"local\" and \"UTC\". Maybe they should be interpreted as \"local with DST\" and \"local without DST\". In this case, the solution would not be valid all around the world in every moment of the year.

Do you guys know any free software that can do so? Thanks!\n\nA: the best software for your usage willl be Handbrake. It is a very advanced software with lots of options for you to choose.\n\nAs shown in image you can set any value of width or height of video, in your case height=480p\n\nInstallation\ndownload deb from here.

Aspect ratio is most usually 16:9. The 'p' simply stands for progressive scan, i.e. non-interlaced.\n\n*480p: Has a vertical resolution of 480 pixels, horizontal resolution usually of 640 pixels. Aspect ratio is most usually 4:3. Again the 'p' stands for progressive scan, i.e. non-interlaced.\n\n\nRequired Software:\nThe great news is that FFmpeg will do the calculations for the horizontal resolution for you as well as maintaining the required aspect ratio, it is only required for you to give the desired vertical resolution. So first install FFmpeg:\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg libavcodec-extra \n\nThe libavcodec-extra package will install some often-needed extra codecs for FFmpeg.\nThe 'Resize' Syntax:\nThe basic syntax to resize your video is as follows:\nffmpeg -i input -vf scale=-1:480 output\n\nThe scale filter uses width:height and you can see in my example that I have specified a height (vertical resolution) of 480 while the '-1' tells FFmpeg to resize the width (horizontal resolution) as necessary to maintain the existing aspect ratio. Pretty cool :).\nA Full Example:\nBear in mind that you will need to also re-encode when you are resizing and your selected settings will depend very much on your source material. To give an example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resize the video stream to 480p and export as an H.264 stream\n\n*Copy the audio stream\n\n\nFor this use the following command line:\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 \\\n-vf scale=-2:480 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 22 \\\n-c:a copy output.mp4\n\nNote that I have specified -2:480 for width and height, this allows FFmpeg to calculate a number for width that is divisible by 2 which will give more efficient encoding.\nThere is a great deal more to scaling with FFmpeg, I have included a reference at the base if you wish to dig a little deeper...\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Scaling (resizing) with ffmpeg\n\nA: Mobile Media Converter by Miksoft can be an easier way to do transcoding tasks.\n\nIn the above screenshot we can see a queue of videos (one in this example) to be processed with the same customised properties which includes transcoding for one or more of the next:\nFor Audio\n\n\n*\n\n*Audio Bitrate\n\n*Audio Frequency\n\n*Audio Channels\n\n*Audio Codec\n\n\nFor Video\n\n\n*\n\n*Video Bitrate\n\n*Video FPS\n\n*Video Size\n\n*Video Codec\n\n\nOf course you will be in need to add (on your own) the proper codecs for which you wish transcoding your video files so that they will become available in the \"Video Codec\" Drop Down.\nBut please have in consideration that the most of the times it is not just about changing the video dimensions but the bitrate itself. I would suggest you to do some transcoding with small portions of video (just for testing) and watch how the results behave on your computer. Perhaps (and just perhaps) you can have a 720p video file with balanced compression which give you enough quality and also light enough for your computer to play it. \nPlease have a look at this answer in which I explain something related.\nHow can I maximum compress video files? \nGood luck!\n\nA: I use avidemux.\nsudo apt-get install avidemux\n\n\nA: I use WinFF, it's quick and simple - and saves you having to learn how to do complex tasks with FFMpeg.\nhttp://winff.org/html_new/\n", "Q: export SOCKS_SERVER not working I try $ export socks_proxy=127.0.0.1:9150 and $ wget http://icanhazip.com/ but still show previous IP (icanhazip.com show IP).

Firefox supports socks proxy that's why you can simply change the proxy settings in Firefox to make it work. \nHowever, for apps that don't support Socks proxy, you can use Proxychains instead. It is very easy to setup and use.

After making these installations, Ubuntu would not load. It would freeze at the splash screen, displaying the Ubuntu logo with the dots, but never progressing to the log-in screen.\nSo, I did another fresh installation of Ubuntu, and slowly made the installations incrementally until Ubuntu failed to load again. Here are those installations:\n1) Ran apt-get update and apt-get upgrade to upgrade all existing packages.\n2) Downloaded Nvidia proprietary driver (nvidia-346) for my graphics card (GTX 880M) and selected to use it in Additional Drivers.\n3) Installed a number of packages: apt-get install cmake build-essential libopencv-dev libbost-all-dev freeglut3-dev libglu-dev libglew-dev libcheese7 libcheese-gtk23 libclutter-gst-2.0-0 libcogl15 libclutter-gtk-1.0-0 libclutter-1.0-0 xserver-xorg-input-all.\nI rebooted after steps 1 and 2, and Ubuntu loaded up fine both times. However, after step 3, it fails. But this time, rather than freezing at the splash screen, it goes as far as making the short noise that normally sounds just as the log-in screen displays, but then just goes to a black screen with a small dash in the top-left. I cannot type anything to this screen.\nMy intuition is that this might be something to do with the Nvidia driver, because it seems like a display problem. But then why would Ubuntu load successfully after step 2?\nI could now go ahead and reinstall Ubuntu again, then reboot after installing each of these packages, but this seems a little exhaustive and not really addressing the issue in the right way...\nI'm also puzzled as to why it froze at the Ubuntu logo screen the first time, and now it is freezing at a black screen...\nAny help?

Look around for it.\nIt might also be called CPU virtualization.\nEDIT: See my comment below.\nNested virtualization is not supported by VirtualBox. In other words, you can't run AVD inside a guest OS. The first guest (Ubuntu in this case) will use VT-x on the host, but will not be able to provide VT-x to the nested guest (AVD). The solution here is to dual-boot and run Ubuntu as the host OS.\n", "Q: Why was pulseaudio installed on Ubuntu server 14 after dist-upgrade?

ATTRS{manufacturer}==\"VTech\", ATTRS{product}==\"Kidizoom\", SYMLINK+=\"toy_cam\"\n\nI save the rule in /etc/udev/rules.d/toycam.rules. I then reload the rules and plug in the camera and yet there's no \"/dev/toy_cam\".\nI'm sure I'm missing something obvious but I'd love to understand why it's not working. \nI'm running ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: Use lsusb to list the basic attributes of your device. Once you have it, you can use the VendorID and the ProductID to make the rule. For example, the output of lsub:\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub\n\nTake a look on this numbers: 8087:0024\nThese are the vendorId and the productId, so, your rule could look like:\nATTRS{idVendor}==\"8087\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"0024\", MODE = \"0660\", GROUP=\"whell\"\n\nIn the GROUP part, make sure your user is in that group, for example, if you want your user to be part of the group whell, run:\nsudo usermod -aG whell <user>\n\nwhere <user> is your username\nRemember, this rule must be in the /etc/udev/rules.d directory and must have 0664 permissions. The name of the file could be like:\n30-Camera.rules\n\nThen use:\nsudo chmod 0644 30-Camera.rules\n\nTo make it work. Finally, reboot your PC.\nFor more information about udev rules writing, take a look at: Writing udev rules\n", "Q: Blank screen after locking screen I just updated my Xubuntu 14.10 desktop to 15.04 and I'm having the following issue:\nWhen I lock my computer (or when the inactivity timer locks it for me), the screen goes blank and I cannot get into my session.

A while ago I had a triple boot system, but problems with OSX made me more reliant on Ubuntu, and recently I've been using it as my daily OS. A while ago I removed the Windows partition, and today I removed the OSX partition, since it was essentially unusable with how frequently it crashed. I'd read the only downside was it made getting firmware updates more difficult, and I was fine with that. I had been using refind to boot into Ubuntu, but I had wiped and restored the OSX partition a number of times without reinstalling refind to it, and it kept working, so I figured OSX wasn't integral to whatever refind is doing. But guess I was wrong.\nFirst time I tried rebooting after deleting OSX partition, I got a black screen for 30 seconds, then a Windows 8 message popping up saying computer is unable to boot (again I'd uninstalled windows about a month and a half earlier). Using a live usb, I tried reinstalling refind on ubuntu, which has worked... sorta. Refind for some reason installed to the sdcard which I forgot was plugged in. So now in order to boot I need to hold alt to boot into the sdcard refind, and can continue from there. \nNone of this is a major problem, but seems a bit unstable. I was wondering what is telling the OSX firmware to try to boot windows, and how to instead point it to ubuntu, or just delete the windows ghost partition so that refind boots automatically\nThanks in advance for any help \n\nA: First, I recommend you examine your disk to determine if you have a hybrid MBR. This is most easily spotted with gdisk:\n$ sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.0\n\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: protective\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: present\n\nThis example shows a legal GPT with a conventional protective MBR. If the MBR: line reads hybrid instead of protective, you've got a hybrid MBR.\nIf you've got a hybrid MBR, as I suspect you do, your disk is basically in a precariously-balanced state that might be causing at least some of your problems. Thus, you've got two choices of what to do. (You can do either of these things even if you've got a protective MBR, but in that case option #1 will be simpler.)\nOption #1: EFI-mode booting\nYou can configure the system to boot in EFI mode, using rEFInd or another EFI-mode boot manager and boot loader of your choice. If you've got a hybrid MBR, your first step is to convert that to a protective MBR:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch gdisk on the disk, as in sudo gdisk /dev/sda.\n\n*Type p to view the partition table.\n\n*Type x to enter the experts' menu.\n\n*Type n to create a fresh protective MBR, wiping out the hybrid MBR.\n\n*Type p to view the partition table. Compare that to the earlier view. You shouldn't need to compare every character of output; the point is to spot accidents like accidentally trashing all your partitions with a typo before you commit your changes to disk.\n\n*Type w to save your changes.\n\n\nWith that done, you have to re-install rEFInd or restore it to bootability. You might be able to get this done by installing the rEFInd PPA or Debian package in the normal (Linux) way; however, Macs are a bit weird, so this might not work. I've even heard of Mac firmware being damaged by Linux tools, but I haven't heard substantiated cases of this in at least two years, so I think the relevant bugs have been fixed. If you try it this way, mount your EFI System Partition (ESP) at /boot/efi first.\nAnother way to install rEFInd is to boot an OS X emergency system (such as an OS X install disc), launch an OS X Terminal window (there's an option for that in the menu bar, once it appears), and run rEFInd's install.sh from that environment. This should work even without re-installing OS X, but I've never verified this.\nOption #2: BIOS-mode booting\nAs a general rule, if you remove OS X from a Mac, it's generally easier to manage the OS(es) on that computer using the Mac's Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which enables BIOS-mode booting. To do this, you should convert the disk from GPT to MBR (full-on regular MBR, not hybrid MBR). This procedure is described here. You'll have to reboot after this conversion, but your Linux installation will no longer be bootable, so be prepared with an Ubuntu live image.\nOnce the disk is converted, you'll need to install a BIOS-mode boot loader. The simplest way to do this is probably to run Boot Repair. You must be careful, though, to run Boot Repair from a BIOS-mode boot of an emergency disc. You can verify a BIOS-mode boot by looking for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi; if it's present, you've booted in EFI mode, and if it's absent, you've booted in BIOS mode. If you boot your emergency system in EFI mode, try using the Option or Alt key when you reboot to boot the medium in another way. In an extreme case, prepare a USB flash drive emergency disk and remove the EFI directory tree from the FAT partition on that disk. This should render it unbootable in EFI mode.\nAs you're currently booting in EFI mode (at least as far as rEFInd), even if a bit strangely, converting to a strictly BIOS-mode boot carries some risk that you'll make matters worse. It should work, but in an (almost) worst-case scenario, you might have to try various repair utilities until something \"clicks.\"\n", "Q: Brighness control problem I'm using 14.04LTS.

How can I \"root\" my phone so that I can install \"normal\" .deb packages?\nI tried it myself. I know the first thing is to make your filesystem writable.

However, doing so in your home directory wastes a lot of valuable space. Instead, it can be done on your SD-card using a computer running on an appropriate Linux OS (tested on Linux Mint 17 and Ubuntu Trusty). As I did not find any information about this anywhere else, I put it here as an answer to an old question.\nThe following instructions assume you want to install a debian jessie chroot in the directory jessie.\nCreating and populating the image file on a desktop computer\nCreating an empty image file\nTo create an 1GB image called IMAGE.img in the current working directory, do:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=IMAGE.img bs=1G count=1\nNote that the B in GB is left out. \"if\" stands for \"input file\", \"of\" for\n\"output file\" and \"bs\" for \"block size\".\nThere are more efficient commands out there, but those only work on certain\ntypes of file systems, as far as I know.  This one also works on an SD-card or\na tempfs.  Please note the use of /dev/zero and not /dev/random or /dev/urandom\nas that would take a lot longer and make it take a lot longer to transfer the\nimage between devices later on.\nCreating a file system on the image\nWithout the file system, the phone would not be able to store any data on the\nimage. Without a file system, you cannot yet mount the image to a directory,\nonly to a block-device.\nThis bash-command will output the next empty loop device into the variable LOOP:\n$LOOP=$(sudo losetup -f)\nNext, assign the image to a block device:\nsudo losetup $LOOP IMAGE.img\nNext, create the ext4 file system on it:\nsudo mkfs -t ext4 $LOOP\nNext, detach the image from the loop device:\nsudo losetup -d $LOOP\nIf you get command not found errors, just install the missing programmes.\nMount the image file on the computer to access it\nNow, create a temporary directory in the working directory:\nmkdir jessie\nand mount the image file IMAGE.img to it:\nsudo mount -o loop IMAGE.img $(pwd)/jessie\nThe command pwd will make sure you give mount an absolute path to your\ncurrent working directory.\nPopulating the image with the new operating system with qemu-debootstrap\nThe next step will be to use qemu-debootstrap to download the necessary files.\nThis is easy if qemu-debootstrap is available as is the case on Ubuntu and\nderived OSes. If you get command not found errors when executing\nqemu-debootstrap --help, try to install the appropriate package, which can be\ndone on Ubuntu via:\nsudo apt-get install qemu-user-static\nTo download all required files and ready the new OS, run the following command:\nsudo qemu-debootstrap --arch=armhf jessie ./jessie http://http.debian.net/debian\nPlease note that the first jessie stands for the OS version whereas the\nsecond jessie stands for the directory where the files are to be installed.Now you can unmount the image as the rest of the work has to be done on the\nphone. Do so via:\nsudo umount $(pwd)/jessie\nIf you cannot install qemu-debootstrap, see the next section.\nPopulating the image with the new operating system without qemu-debootstrap\nPlease skip this section if you have qemu-debootstrap available. You will still\nneed a native debootstrap for you architecture, though. If this happens to be\narmhf, just use the above command line but replace qemu-debootstrap by\ndebootstrap. If not, follow this section.\nTo download all required files for the new OS, run the following command:\nsudo debootstrap --arch=armhf --foreign jessie ./jessie \\\n    http://http.debian.net/debian\n\nNow you can unmount the image as the rest of the work has to be done on the\nphone. Do so via:\nsudo umount $(pwd)/jessie\nTransfer image to the phone\nNow best create a tar archive from this which you then copy to your\nphone. It does not matter whether the archive is put on the SD-card or\nthe internal storage. Create the archive on the desktop using:\ntar -cvzf jessie.tar.gz IMAGE.img\nNow, on your phone, turn on ssh support to copy the image over. You might also\ndo that using a USB-cable instead. Since the ssh server is reset on every\nreboot, start the ssh service on the phone via:\nsudo service ssh start\nNext, copy the image via:\nscp jessie.tar.gz phablet@ubuntu-phablet:$COPYDIR\nwhere the variable COPYDIR contains the directory where the image shall be\nstored.  This command assumes that your username on the phone is phablet and\nthe phone's hostname is ubuntu-phablet. You can find out both by issuing echo $USER\nand echo $HOSTNAME on the phone, respectively.\nNow you only have to extract the archive wherever you want the image to reside. Assume the directory where you want the image to be located\nis stored in the variable IMAGEDIR. Extract the image there via the bash\ncommand:\n( cd $IMAGEDIR; tar -xvzf $COPYDIR/jessie.tar.gz; )\nYou might now remove the archive:\nrm $COPYDIR/jessie.tar.gz\nFinalizing and using the image on the phone\nIf you did not turn on the ssh server on the phone, do so now via:\nsudo service ssh start\nNext, mount your image to a directory of your choice (in this case \"jessie\"):\nsudo mount -o loop $IMAGEDIR/IMAGE.img $(pwd)/jessie\nNow, enter your chroot for the first time via:\nssh localhost \"sudo chroot $(pwd)/jessie /bin/bash\"\nIf you had qemu-debootstrap available on your computer, you're all done. Use\nthe above 2 commands to connect to your chroot. If not, you still have to\nexecute the following command once you are inside your chroot, in order to\nproperly setup the OS:\n/debootstrap/debootstrap --second-stage\nSummary of how to access the chroot\nIf you followed the above steps, you should be able to access your chroot using\nthis simple script on the phone:\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo service ssh start\nssh localhost \"sudo chroot jessie /bin/bash\"\n\nYou have to first ssh into your own phone from the phone due to apparmor restrictions of the terminal app. The terminal app is only allowed to execute binaries in certain locations and neither your home directory nor the SD card are among those. The ssh service, however, does not have such restrictions.\n\nA: Create a chroot inside the home directory:\n\nmkdir -p vivid-chroot\ncd vivid-chroot\nwget http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-touch/vivid/daily-preinstalled/current/vivid-preinstalled-touch-armhf.tar.gz\nsudo tar -zxvf vivid-preinstalled-touch-armhf.tar.gz\n\nThen, use the chroot and install whatever CLI tools you need to use, within that chroot:\n\ncd ~/vivid-chroot\nsudo chroot .\napt-get update\napt-get install git\n\nIn order to perform certain things, it may be required to bind mount some directories.

The VPN protocol we use is PPTP.\nI have been running Ubuntu 14.04/14.10 (Unity) for about a year, and did not have any trouble setting up the PPTP VPN using the standard Network Manager.

The problem is that I cannot get the VPN to connect to the work network from Ubuntu MATE.  \nI can confirm that the VPN configuration is EXACTLY the same as it was in my previous Ubuntu versions;  in fact, I can live boot to Ubuntu 14.04 (from DVD) and get the VPN to connect using the same configuration, but for some reason it doesn't work on this fresh Ubuntu MATE 15.04 install.  \nI haven’t tried yet on a live boot of Ubuntu 15.04 (Unity), but I am planning to do that to see if it is a 15.04 problem or a MATE problem.\nWhat am I missing?  I've made sure ppp and all the libraries it is dependent on are installed.  Is there a configuration switch somewhere in MATE that is causing issues, or am I missing some required libraries? \nEDIT: I can now confirm that pptp vpn does not work for me in Unity 15.04, either.  The notification I get when the connection fails states 'The VPN connection failed because the VPN service returned invalid configuration.'

For me, the fix was to remove the gateway from the routes.

The canonical way to enable/disable a service in an init system agnostic way is update-rc.d  enable|disable, which will translate to init system specific actions such as adding/removing symlinks (SysV and systemd) or creating/removing job override files (upstart). For systemd in particular, admins also often call systemctl enable|disable  directly.

Once I put my settings into /etc/default/tomcat8 then deleted /usr/share/tomcat8/bin/setenv.sh tomcat started up just fine.\nThe reason appears to be that /etc/init.d/tomcat8 tries to figure out which JVM is used but ignores /usr/share/tomcat8/bin/setenv.sh.  It uses the JVM info to look at the process list and see if tomcat is running.   If you use setenv.sh, tomcat gets started with a different JVM than the one that init.d expects.

And there end the similarities with the aforementioned link, because even after reboot the frozen desktop remained.\nAfter retrying the install without the nvidia proprietary driver, the desktop showed, and it was usable after disabling compositing (Nouveau has the 'virtue' to corrupt many widgets in my machine). Leaving the compositing disabled allowed me to install the nvidia-304 and get into the desktop without hassle.\nBut here begins my problem: the performance of my graphics are quite poor compared to what I was accustomed in 14.14 and even some OpenGL aplications like glmark2 show error messages like\nInconsistency detected by ld.so: dl-version.c: 224: _dl_check_map_versions: Assertion `needed != ((void *)0)' failed!\n\nApplies that glmark runs with Nouveau without error messages, but it does with a disappointing performance.\nI'm suspecting of a kwin issue, but I can't seem to find nothing of relevance beyond pre-release issues.\nAnyone knows of a definitive solution besides returning to 14.10?\nThanks for your help\nEDIT: This is not a driver install issue at all, because the driver is the one suggested by kubuntu and the last one supported by Nvidia.\nGiven that my card is just a old AGP card (a GeForce 6200 as mentioned above) it is unsupported by the newest drivers, and because the card worked fine with the same driver with all the previous kubuntu versions until 14.10, desktop compositing included, I still expecting the same behaviour for this release with the same driver version.\nThe only things that I think could break the setup are wayland or a buggy kwin, because of the locked desktop screen after the update (driver 304 running with compositing enabled in 14.10)\n\nA: I think the problem is with the NVidia driver and the use of OpenGL.\nWhen you experience the black screen login on to an other tty and try the following:\n- sudo vi ~/.config/kwinrc\n- Change Backend=OpenGL to Backend=XRender\n- then restart with kill -9 -1\nYou should now be able to login using Plasma.\nIt is however very slow but you can sometimes switch back to OpenGL.

If I remain in the same terminal session and repeat the command, I don't get the password prompt (my authentication seems to persist) and yet I still get the same error (as if my authentication is not applying to the /dev write operation).  The same error occurs when executed from a /bin/sh script.\nHow should I construct my command(s) to uncompress my image to the device?\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS in a terminal window.  \n\nA: You are missing sudo in the other side of the pipeline:\nsudo gzip -dc sda1.image.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/sda1\n\nIn a <command> | <command> | [...] command format, each command of the pipeline which requires sudo should be run using sudo, not only the first one.\nIn this case you might not need to use sudo on gzip -dc sda1.image.gz, unless you don't have read permission on the file:\ngzip -dc sda1.image.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/sda1\n\nIn general, if all the commands to be run in a pipeline require sudo, one way around having to write sudo in each command is to run the whole command in a subshell invoked using sudo:\nsudo bash -c '<command> | <command> | [...]'\n\n\nA: Found this question and answer a few years later and it helped me resolve the same issue.\nFor future situations, it might be useful to save the command used in creating the image to a text file, along with the command needed to move the image back to another partition.\nFor example:\nsudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 | gzip > YYYYMMDD_Rasp4_Backup.img.gz\nto move to a new partition:\nsudo cat YYYYMMDD_Rasp4_Backup.img.gz | sudo gunzip | sudo dd of=/dev/sdb\nSave those commands in a text file alongside the .img.gz file as a reminder.\n", "Q: LVS-NAT doesn't work with passive FTP. Active FTP is fine On Ubuntu 14, I'm trying to set up a load balancer that uses haproxy for web connections and LVS-NAT for FTP, controlled by ldirectord, with pacemaker for automatic failover to a redundant host.  The em1 interface has a public IP address and the em2 interface has a private IP address for talking to the back end servers.\nPassive FTP through the kernel load balancer doesn't work, but active FTP does.  When using a passive FTP client, the data connection will not establish, so directory listings and file transfers don't work.  The FTP control channel on port 21 does work.  There are two FTP servers for high availability.\nI have the ip_vs_ftp module loaded.  The ufw firewall is entirely disabled, because there is a Cisco firewall in front of all the hardware.  I would really prefer to not have the firewall enabled ... but I did notice that every HOWTO out there for getting FTP to work through LVS also mentions how to set up the firewall.\nThis is the ldirectord config:\n\nchecktimeout=5\n  checkinterval=10\n  negotiatetimeout=20\n  autoreload=yes\n  logfile=\"/var/log/ldirectord.log\"\n  quiescent=no\nvirtual=XX.XXX.XXX.71:21\n\n fallback=127.0.0.1:21  \n real=10.100.2.61:21 masq 65535  \n real=10.100.2.60:21 masq 1  \n service=ftp  \n request=\"monitortest.txt\"  \n receive=\"good\"  \n login=\"USER\"  \n passwd=\"PASSWD\"  \n scheduler=wrr  \n protocol=tcp  \n checktype=negotiate  \n\n\n\nI'm migrating a working setup from CentOS 5, which is ancient.  This all works perfectly on that CentOS 5 machine.  The firewall is disabled on that machine.\nHow can I make this work like it does in the much older kernel?\n\nA: Shawn,\nAs discussed on the HAProxy mailing list, I'm pretty sure you need to enable conntrack as well as ip_vs_ftp, then it should work fine.\n", "Q: Openstack, login to my instance I've installed devstack, downloaded a trusty ubuntu server image, launched a heat flavor instance, created a public ssh key, ssh to my instance, all fine.\nNow it may be a silly question but when ssh(ing) to the instance, how to login to the instance using the console provided by openstack dashboard?\n\nA: With the default image - you can't.\nMost cloud images don't have username/password authentication enabled, and rightfully so - using key pairs is much safer. But the console will not allow you to log in with a key-pair.\nFor development/debugging purposes, it is a good idea to add a 'debug' user to your image, with a configured password. Just don't use this image for production, or on a public cloud.\nYou can, of-course, ssh into the VM, set a password for the user and then use the openstack console.

(During this time you will probably see a logo of your computer manufacturer.)\nQuickly press and hold the Shift key, which will bring up the GNU GRUB menu. (If you see the Ubuntu logo, you've missed the point where you can enter the GRUB menu.)\n\n*Select the line which starts with \"Advanced options\".\n\n*Select the line ending with \"(recovery mode)\", probably the second line, something like: \"Ubuntu GNU/Linux, with Linux 3.8.0-26-generic (recovery mode)\"\n\n*Press Return and your machine will begin the boot process.\n\n*After a few moments, your workstation should display a menu with a number of options. One of the options (you may need to scroll down to the bottom of the list) will be \"Drop to root shell prompt\". Press Return with this option highlighted.\n\n*The root partition is mounted read-only. To mount it read/write, enter the command:\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\n\n*If you have /home, /boot, /tmp, or any other mount point on a separate partition, you can mount them with the command (unsure if this step is needed, but unless I'm corrected by someone, I recommend you type in this command as well, otherwise you may not be able to uninstall fglrx.

The question is simply this that I have two PC's one is running Ubuntu and the other windows 7. What I want to do is to completely forget about windows but I want to use all windows apps. \nI know that in Ubuntu, WINE is present for running some windows apps but that is only a drop out of an ocean. So If I copy all windows dll's i.e. in Windows\\system32(from my windows computer) into the wine directory of system32(the ubuntu computer). Will all windows application run? \nWill I have to do something further i.e. setting the dll's using winecfg into native/local etc.\n\nA: The short answer to your question is No. All the windows applications out there are not compatible with wine. The best place to see if a particular windows application is compatible with wine is browsing/searching in WineAppDB. In addition there are certain DLLs that Wine does not support (for eg: copy protection etc.). Read Wine HowTo to get a detailed view on this topic.\n\nA: Wine is an open source Windows API implementation (which means it runs Windows apps natively under Linux Kn), you must install programs directly, not just copy the files as it emulates the registry too, however wine is no replacement for windows.\nIt can be very hit and miss depending on the version of wine, the version of the program you want to install and many many other factors.\nDon't remove your Windows just yet, look for native alternatives to the apps you want first and if you must look at playonlinux, it is a wine front end making it easier to use and can auto-install many popular programs.\nI don't think you quite know what a .dll is\nDLL stands for dynamic link library and contains references to other files windows programs need to run but they are only a tiny part of it.\nWine or playonlinux are capable of downloading them there self when they need them\nI would not recommend wine for every day use at all, you should read up on it first\nhttps://www.winehq.org/\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man1/wine.1.html\nhttps://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&sTitle=Browse%20Applications&sOrderBy=appName&bAscending=true\n", "Q: Can't install Virtualbox on 15.04 I was using Ubuntu 14.10 on my setup and I had Virtualbox running fine.\nThen my OCZ Vertex 2 (SSD) died unexpectedly and I had to reinstall everything.\nBut, because the Intel Graphics Drivers weren't installing on Ubuntu 14.10 (February 2015), I chose to install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

It's same as if you are a root then su to any other user will not ask for password because you are a root.\nWhen you just run the command su, you are running it as a regular user.

Since 13.04 I sometimes get accidental middle clicks/middle click emulation. I can tell this is happening because text in my clipboard pastes itself (default behaviour on Ubuntu) at random times.\nCan anyone tell me why this is happening and how I can disable it?\n\nA: Run the following command:\nxmodmap -e \"pointer = 1 25 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\"\n\nTo persist this behavior, edit ~/.Xmodmap and add\npointer = 1 25 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n\nA: For Ubuntu 18.04 and later (which have middle mouse button emulation enabled by default):\nCreate a script called disable-middle-button-emulation with following contents:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# to through all input devices\nxinput list --id-only | while read id\ndo\n    # if this device supports middle button emulation, disable it (both evdev and libinput variants)\n    xinput --list-props \"$id\" | grep -qF \"Evdev Middle Button Emulation\" && xinput set-prop \"$id\" \"Evdev Middle Button Emulation\" 0\n    xinput --list-props \"$id\" | grep -qF \"libinput Middle Button Emulation\" && xinput set-prop \"$id\" \"libinput Middle Button Emulation\" 0\n    xinput --list-props \"$id\" | grep -qF \"libinput Middle Emulation\" && xinput set-prop \"$id\" \"libinput Middle Emulation\" 0\ndone\n\nThen run chmod a+x disable-middle-button-emulation to set execute enabled bit and then you can run it with ./disable-middle-button-emulation. If you put the file in your home directory under subdirectory bin, you don't need to prefix the command. As an alternative, you can put all of the above in file ~/.xsessionrc which gets automatically executed whenever you start a new X session.\nTo verify the system behavior (before or after the above change), run xev, move mouse pointer over the xev window and press both left and right buttons simultaneously. If you get \"button 2\" (middle mouse button) in the terminal output, emulation is still active. You should get separate events for \"button 1\" (left mouse button) and \"button 3\" (right mouse button). Note that if the simulation is active, the event from pressing mouse button 1 or 3 down will be delayed 50 ms which causes extra lag for everything in the system. If you truly want to use emulation but reduce lag, you can modify the above script to look for Button Emulation Timeout and adjust it to your liking. The default value is 50 which means 50 ms.\n", "Q: Is GPT BIOS partition is really needed? I have notebook with GPT partition format, EFI, LUKS, LVM, 64bit system and everything works perfectly. I wasn't created GPT BIOS partition. Now I want to test some Ubuntu features on virtual machine, GPT, 32bit system, LUKS, LVM and while installing system grub-install it display message that I dont have GPT BIOS partition.\nQuestion is: in which cases GTP BIOS partition is needed?\n\nA: Two types of specialized boot partitions are common on GPT disks:\n\n\n*\n\n*The EFI System Partition (ESP) is used to store EFI-mode boot loaders. The ESP is a FAT partition on which EFI boot loaders appear as ordinary files, normally with filename extensions of .efi. The EFI spec doesn't say what size is appropriate, but most ESPs created by OS installers range between 100MiB and 512MiB. I generally recommend making ESPs at least 550MiB in order to avoid bugs on some (mostly older) EFIs. The ESP has a GPT type code of C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B (\"EF00\" in gdisk, or a \"boot flag\" set in parted or GParted). On MBR disks, it has a type code of 0xEF (set as such in fdisk; there's no way to properly identify an MBR ESP in parted or GParted).\n\n*The BIOS Boot Partition holds BIOS-mode GRUB code on GPT disks. There's no equivalent to a BIOS Boot Partition on MBR disks. (Under MBR, GRUB stashes part of itself in an unpartitioned portion of the disk instead.) The BIOS Boot Partition is usually about 1MiB in size and has no filesystem; GRUB stores its code there \"raw.\" It has a GPT type code of 21686148-6449-6E6F-744E-656564454649, which shows as a type of \"EF02\" in gdisk or as having the \"bios_grub flag\" set in parted or GParted.\n\n\nThe ESP is needed for EFI/UEFI-mode booting and is useless for BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode booting; and the BIOS Boot Partition is used by GRUB for booting from GPT disks under BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and is useless when booting in EFI/UEFI mode or when using non-GRUB boot loaders such as SYSLINUX or LILO.\n", "Q: Recover deleted full disk encryption partition What I have:\nI have Xubuntu 14.04 installed on 500 GB HDD. The HDD consists of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some small partition that seems to be for some EFI stuff\n\n*a partition that holds /boot\n\n*some free space at the end of the HDD\n\n*and in between a partition (lvm?) that was created using the full disk encryption option of the Xubuntu install wizard\n\n\nNo. 4 holds the actual system (except /boot of course) and a swap partition.\nWhat I did:\nBeing tired and under time pressure, I deleted No. 4 (using gparted). I intended to delete some partition on an USB key but wasn't paying attention (stupid, I know). As everythign was still working I thought I had deleted said USB Key partition and still saved files to the then already deleted partition. All went fine, so I didn't think anything was broken.\nI switched off the computer, when I turned it on again it wouldn't boot. It takes a long time (obviously searching for the gone lvm-partition) and then sends me to a initramfs prompt.\nI found out testdisk was some utility to recover deleted partitions. I tried out some rescue system (ALT Linux) with testdisk 6.14 and then, when I realized there's a version 7 of it, I even tried testdisk 7.00 (static). This gives me (I treid quick search and deep search) more then the one partition I was looking for, so I hesitated doing anything I don't fully understand.\nAfter an internet search, I found out that I could use hexeditor to look for the luks header (by searching for '4c554b53babe'). I did find two luks headers on the drive. One at\nOne at 0x206FEBD4/0x7470C06000\nand\none at 0x2F500000/0x7470C06000\nWhat I presume:\nI presume that the actual data is intact, as I only deleted the partition in gaparted which I think only means some altering in the partition table, so resetting the partition table to normal would set the whole system back to normal.\nI do have /boot so I should be able to decrypt the lvm partition and then get to the presumably intact ext4 partition.\nI am not sure if I need to know the exact size of the lvm partition (as noted, there was some free space at the end of the drive, I don't know why, it wasn't much and this was how the Xubuntu install left it) or if that might be stored somewhere in the luks header or somewhere else.\nWhat I hope:\nI hope that by some command line magic I am yet not capable of, I can reset the disk to normal so I can boot into my system as I always did.\nSorry for the lengthy explaination, I want to provide you with a smuch info as possible. If you need more, do tell me and I'll deliver.\n\nA: Just came back after over two years and saw some people looked at the question so there might be in interest in how I solved the problem:\nIt was really just the partition table. By just recreating the before deleted lvm partition, all went back to normal.\nI didn't even have to remember the exact size of the lvm partition, I just opened gparted and created a new partition to the end of the disk, using all free space. The data was still there, the system is still running today (though updated to recent Xubuntu).\n", "Q: Resolution of 4320x900 with TripleHead2go Kubuntu 15.04 I used to have a resolution of 4320x900 but since I upgrade nvidia to 340.76 it gives me a max resolution of 3840x1024.

How can I set default settings of vim.\n\nA: If you paste from the system clipboard, vim thinks the pasted text is user input and, if confiured to provide autoindent, vim makes it's job and automatically indents the code.\nYou can turn off that autoindent when you paste code into vim directly. Type that in the command mode:\n:set paste\n\nNow, your pasted code should be written without indent. To re-enable autoindent again use:\n:set nopaste\n\nTo simplfy that, you can define a shortcut in you .vimrc as follows:\nset pastetoggle=<F2>\n\nNow, when you press F2 in insert mode to have the desired behavior. Then press again F2, to work with autoindent as before.\n\nA: I learnt this neat automation from coderwall, write the following into your .vimrc file\nlet &t_SI .= \"\\<Esc>[?2004h\"\nlet &t_EI .= \"\\<Esc>[?2004l\"\n\ninoremap <special> <expr> <Esc>[200~ XTermPasteBegin()\n\nfunction!

On 15.04, sometimes (fairly often) my fn shortcuts stop working. The problem is in the OS, they are still able to change brightness, but no notification is displayed and I cannot change the volume with them. I found out that running ccsm and enabling and disabling the commands plugin is a reliable way to reenable those fn keys. Is there a programatic way I could do the same so I could write a script that would re-enable the shortucts every five minutes and I would not have to worry about this?\nI know this is most likely a bug, but I have not noticed any regularity, so I wouldn't know what to report - and I am interested in a workaround.\n\nA: I have created this script that I run upon startup and hourly in cron, it should fix that (since disabling and reenabling compiz commands plugin fixes this and that is what the script does in an ugly way - I am sure the bash could be much better, but it works).\n#!/bin/bash\nsleep 5\na=`gsettings get org.compiz.core:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/ active-plugins`\nb=`echo $a | sed \"s/'commands', //\" | sed \"s/, 'commands'//\"`\nc=`echo \"${b::-1}, 'commands']\"`\ngsettings set org.compiz.core:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/ active-plugins \"$c\"\nsleep 0.1\ngsettings set org.compiz.core:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/ active-plugins \"$b\"\nsleep 0.1\ngsettings set org.compiz.core:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/ active-plugins \"$a\"\n\n\nA: I was facing similar issue some days ago.

But the others...\nstat: cannot stat ‘(another’: No such file or directory\nstat: cannot stat ‘copy)’: No such file or directory\n\nChanging $(ls) to \"$(ls)\" or $file to \"$file\" does not work. What can I do?\nEdit:\necho '\nfor files in *\ndo\nstat \"$files\"\ndone' | bash\n\ndoes the trick! As I'm new to bash, I want to keep things as simple as possible - so nothing with trying to escape spaces, or using xargs or the solution with read -r, although they solve the problem.\nAs some have asked: Yes, using this instead of stat * is weird. But I just wanted to find a general way to apply the same command on a bunch of file names in bash, using a for loop. So stat could stand for gzip, gpg or rm.\n\nA: On a side note: you can split long / complicated commands over multiple lines by adding a space followed by a backslash and hitting Enter everytime you want to start writing into a new line, instead of forking multiple processes by using echo [...] | bash; also you should enclose $file in double quotes, to prevent stat from breaking in case of filenames containing spaces:\nfor file in $(ls); \\\ndo \\\nstat \"$file\"; \\\ndone\n\nThe problem is that $(ls) expands to a list of filenames containing spaces, and the same will happen also with \"$(ls)\".\nEven solving this problem, this method will still break on filenames containing backslashes and on filenames containing newlines (as pointed out by terdon).\nA solution for both problems would be to pipe the output of find to a while loop running read -r so that, at each iteration, read -r will store one line of find's output into $file:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f | while read -r file; do \\\n    stat \"$file\"; \\\ndone\n\n\nA: Use the good old find, works with hidden files, newlines and spaces.\nfind . -print0 | xargs -I {} -0 stat {}\n\nor any other instead of stat\nfind . -print0 | xargs -I {} -0 file {}\nfind . -print0 | xargs -I {} -0 cat {}\n\n\nA: The multiple quote from the echo ' is complicating the thing. \nYou can just use:\nfor f in *; do stat -- \"$f\"; done\n\nBut also \nstat -- * \n\n...and if you want to collect the files and then apply the command (why?) you can go with (but be careful with file containing new lines...(1))\nfor f in *; do echo \"$f\"; done | xargs stat --\n\n...and if you want hidden files too, just use * .* as a pattern, but then remember that . and .. will be in the set. \nAs an aside, you shouldn't parse ls output. \n\n(1) but if you have file names with newlines, you somewhat deserve it... ;-)\n\nA: As a R guy, I already found a workaround in R:\nfilenames <- dir(); # reads file names into an array.\n                    # It works also recursively\n                    # with dir(recursive=TRUE)\nfor (i in 1:length(filenames)) {\nsystem(     # calls a system function\n paste(     # join stat and the file name\n  \"stat\",\n  filenames[i]\n )\n)\n}\n\nI know, it's mad. I wish the output of ls would be easier to parse... R can deal with spaces, because dir() returns a quoted character value. Anything between the quotes is then a valid file name with spaces.\n\nA: I have run into other instances of whitespace issues in for loops, so the following (imo more robust) command is what I generally use. It also fits nicely into pipes.\n$ ls | while read line; do stat \"$line\"; done;\n\nYou could combine this with grep or use find instead:\n$ find ./ -maxdepth 2 | grep '^\\./[/a-z]+$' | while read line; do stat \"$line\"; done;\n\n\nA: This answer will solve the problem of parsing ls and take care of the backspaces and new lines\nTry this, it will solve your problem using Internal Field Separator IFS.\nIFS=\"\\n\" for f in $(ls); do   stat \"$f\"; done\n\nBut Also you can eaisly solve it without need to parse ls output using \nfor f in *; do   stat \"$f\"; done\n\n\nA: Instead, you can rename your files replacing the space with some other character such as underscore, so you get rid of this problem:\nTo do that easily run the command:\nfor file in * ; do mv \"$f\" \"${f// /_}\" ; done\n\n", "Q: How to block email addresses in Thunderbird?

I made a file in my home dir called .bc and inside it I put scale=2 on the first line followed by a carriage return.\nPermissions on ~/.bc are: -rw-rw-rw-. Is that right? \nThen I did set BC_ENV_ARGS=~/.bc; export BC_ENV_ARGS.

Say there are files with names:\nbatman.c\ndebate.c\ncricketbat.c\n\nWhat command and how should I use it to list all these files by using the searchtag bat?\n\nA: Finding Files with bat Anywhere\nTo find all files anywhere inside /path/to/folder whose names contain bat, you can use:\nfind /path/to/folder -name '*bat*'\n\nI have quoted the search pattern *bat* because, if the quotes were omitted and files match *bat* in the current directory, the shell will expand *bat* into a list of them and pass that to find. Then find wouldn't work right. (\\*bat\\* and \"*bat*\" also work.)\nTo search in the folder you're currently in (e.g., that you've cded to), use ., as usual:\nfind . -name '*bat*'\n\nTo search your whole computer, use /. To search your home directory, use ~, or the full name of your home directory. (The shell expands ~ to your home directory's fully qualified path.)\nBroadening or Narrowing Your Search, Based on Name\nIf you want to search case-insensitively, so files containing BAT, bAt, and so forth are matched, use the -iname test instead of the -name test:\nfind /path/to/folder -iname '*bat*'\n\nI've noticed all your files end in .c. If you only want to find files like that, use:\nfind /path/to/folder -name '*bat*.c'\n\nI noticed all your filenames have bat either at the very beginning or the very end of the part preceding the .c suffix. If you want to avoid matching files like embattled.c, you could use:\nfind /path/to/folder -name '*bat.c' -o -name 'bat*.c'\n\n-o is the or operator.\nMatching Only Files\nTo find only regular files--and not folders, symbolic links, and special device nodes--you can use -type f. This is frequently recommended and sometimes quite appropriate... but often not what you really want, especially if you're running find for the purpose of examining the output yourself. If you had a symbolic link that matched your search, wouldn't you want to know about it?\nIf you want to find both regular files and symbolic links, you can use:\nfind /path/to/folder -name '*bat*' \\( -type f -o -type l \\)\n\nThat uses the -o operator and also parentheses for grouping (which must be quoted so the shell does not treat them specially; otherwise you'll get a syntax error).\nBut suppose you only want to see symbolic links that ultimately point to a regular file (and not symbolic links to directories, device nodes, etc.). That's actually even simpler: use -xtype instead of -type. Provided you're not running find with -L flag, -xtype on a symbolic link tests the type of the file the link points to.\nfind /path/to/folder -name '*bat*' -xtype f\n\nIf you have a symlink to another symlink to a file, -xtype f will match it even though its direct target is another symlink rather than a regular file. This is almost always what you want.\nOften people think they want -type f, but really they want -xtype f.\nGetting Detailed Output\nfind's default action if you don't specify one is -print. All the commands given above are equivalent to themselves with -print tacked on at the end.\nfind is often used to run commands based on the files found--often, commands that make changes. But there are also other actions whose purpose is to display results, besides -print. Of particular interest is -ls:\nfind /path/to/folder -name '*bat*' -ls\n\nThis gives detailed information on each file, in a multi-column format, similar to (though not quite the same as) what you would see by running ls file.\nFurther Reading\nFor more information on find and other ways to find files, see:\n\n*\n\n*The find manual page, accessible online or by running man find in a terminal.\n\n*The GNU findutils reference manual, providing extensive documentation on the find, locate, and xargs utilities.\n\n*FindingFiles in the Ubuntu help wiki, which shows how to use find as well as several other methods.\n\n\nA: If the files are in the current directory use:\n$ ls *bat*\nbatgirl.c  batman.c  batwoman.c  cricketbat.c\n\nOr (to have them line by line):\n$ ls -1 *bat*\nbatgirl.c\nbatman.c\nbatwoman.c\ncricketbat.c\n\nIf you want to search the system for that files, use:\n$ find / -name \"*bat*\"\n/path/to/cricketbat.c\n/path/to/batgirl.c\n/path/to/batwoman.c\n/path/to/batman.c\n\n\nA: You want to use the find command, with the -iname option for case insensitive file name matching, or the -name option for case sensitive file name matches. Both of these will let you use wildcard names. So, to find any file names which contain \"bat\" you would use:\nfind / -iname '*bat*'\n\nOr\nfind / -name '*bat*'\n\nThe * means \"any character(s)\", so the search is looking for bat with any characters, including none, before or after it. The / searches from the root directory recursively, you can use . which will search recursively from the current directory, or the absolute path for where you want to search from.\nTake a look at how search for files using regex in linux shell script\n\nA: Use the good old find.\nfind <path_for_search> -type f -iname \"*bat*\" \n\neg.:\n% find . -type f -iname \"*bat*\" \n./batgirl.c\n./batwoman.c\n./cricketbat.c\n./batman.c\n\nfrom man find:\n-type c\n          File is of type c:\n          [..]\n          d      directory\n          [..]\n          f      regular file\n          [..]\n\n-iname pattern \n          Like -name, but the match is case insensitive.\n\n\nA: The easiest way is to run\nlocate bat\n\nThis way you can search through the whole computer for files containing \"bat\" in the file name\nTo refresh the list of files on your PC run\nupdatedb\n\nRun this command when you have recently added new files to your account \n\nA: Open the terminal and change directories to the directory from where you want to start searching and then run this command:\nfind . -name \"*bat*\" -type f \n\nThe . starts  the find command from the current directory.\nThe -name matches the string bat and is case sensitive.

Is there an alternate way to start and stop processes in 15.04?\n\nA: The service management system has changed.\nEvery system management toolset has own utilities.  The utilities that you are used to using are the ones that come with upstart, which are trivial shims for initctl start and initctl stop.  But this is Ubuntu version 15.  You aren't using upstart any more. \nYou're using systemd, and the service control commands are subcommands of systemctl rather than of initctl.  So services are started with systemctl start, stopped with systemctl stop, enabled with systemctl enable, disabled with systemctl disable, and queried with systemctl status.\nServices and service configuration have changed.\nYou've presumably followed instructions like the Serial Console How-To to turn the supplied /etc/init/tty1.conf into an /etc/init/ttyS0.conf.  This is an upstart configuration file and it will simply be ignored by systemd.  None of what you have learned from there applies to systemd, not even the concept of run levels, which is \"obsolete\" in the systemd world.\nThe systemd configuration file for a getty on a real terminal device is /lib/systemd/system/serial-getty@.service.  This is a template unit, parameterized on the name of the serial device file.  So the actual service name to use will be serial-getty@ttyS0.service.  You just enable/disable/start/stop it like any other service.\nIf you want an actual serial console, rather than just an ordinary serial terminal, then you don't even do that.  systemd has a mechanism that automatically instantiates serial-getty@.service whenever the kernel is told to not have its console on a virtual terminal.\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*Lennart Poettering (2013-10-07).  systemctl. systemd manual pages.  freedesktop.org.\n\n*James Hunt and Clint Byrum (2014).  \"Utilities\".

Why is it insecure to use the combination of -execdir action of find while using -exec isn't?\nWhen I'm running the below command I'm getting the following prompt message:\n/path/to/currentDir/$ find . -type f -name 'partOfFileNames*' -execdir rm -- {} +\n\nfind: The current directory is included in the PATH environment variable, which is insecure \nin combination with the -execdir action of find.  Please remove the current directory \nfrom your $PATH (that is, remove \".\" or leading or trailing colons)\n\nWhat may caused this prompt appearing? \n\nA: There is a much detailed information here. Another excellent reference is here. To quote from the first reference:\n\nThe option -execdir  is a more modern option introduced in GNU find\nis an attempt to create a more safe version of -exec. It has the same\nsemantic as -exec with two important enhancements:\nIt always provides absolute path to the file (using relative path to a\nfile is really dangerous in case of -exec).\nIn addition to providing\nabsolute path it also checks the PATH variable for safety  (if dot is\npresent in the PATH env variable, you can pickup executable from the\nwrong directory)\n\nFrom second reference:\n\nThe ‘-execdir’ action refuses to do anything if the current directory\nis included in the $PATH environment variable. This is necessary\nbecause ‘-execdir’ runs programs in the same directory in which it\nfinds files – in general, such a directory might be writable by\nuntrusted users. For similar reasons, ‘-execdir’ does not allow ‘{}’\nto appear in the name of the command to be run.\n\n\nA: The main problem is with the value of system variable PATH which contains relative folders in it, so for security reasons find command won't allow you to execute binaries, because potentially it can execute wrong programs.\n\nSo for example, if you have your current dir in your PATH as per warning which you get:\n\nThe current directory is included in the PATH environment variable.\n\nand you'll run your command:\nfind . -type f -name 'partOfFileNames*' -execdir rm -- {} +\n\nin case you'll have local script (rm with executable flags) containing rm -fr / in it, it can remove all your files, because instead of executing expected /bin/rm, you'll execute rm from the current dir, so probably it's not what you wanted.\n\nAs a side note, this is known issue in Travis CI (GH #2811) when it fails with the error:\n\nfind: The relative path `./node_modules/.bin' is included in the PATH environment variable, which is insecure in combination with the -execdir action of find.  Please remove that entry from $PATH\n\nSo the solution is to remove affected entry from PATH variable, e.g.\nPATH=`echo $PATH | sed -e 's/:\\.\\/node_modules\\/\\.bin//'`\n\nas proposed by drogus. The progress of this bug, can be followed at GH #4862.\n\nHere is Bash version workaround:\nPATH=${PATH//:\\.\\/node_modules\\/\\.bin/}\n\nExample usage (passing filtered PATH to specific command):\nenv PATH=${PATH//:\\.\\/node_modules\\/\\.bin/} find . -type f\n\n\nA: Set PATH=/usr/bin\nThis is not ideal, but it tends to solve most use cases, supposing both find and the program to be used (rm here) are in that directory:\nPATH=/usr/bin find -execdir rm ...\n\nYou can just add any missing PATHs as needed.\nxargs and bash -c cd workaround\nOK, I give up:\nfind . -type f |\n  xargs -I '{}' bash -c 'cd \"$(dirname \"{}\")\" && pwd && echo \"$(basename \"{}\")\"'\n\nsed workaround\nA bit less nice than the previous workaround:\nPATH=\"$(echo \"$PATH\" | sed -E 's/(^|:)[^\\/][^:]*//g')\" find . -execdir echo '{}' \\;\n\nA testcase:\n[ \"$(printf '/a/b::c/d:/e/f\\n' | sed -E 's/(^|:)[^\\/][^:]*//g')\" = '/a/b:/e/f' ] || echo fail\n\nFor rename specifically, you can also work around with some Perl regex-fu: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16541582/finding-multiple-files-recursively-and-renaming-in-linux/54163971#54163971\nRTFS hope crushing\nFor those who have hopes that there exists a way to ignore find's opinionatedness, let me crush that with some source:\n\n*\n\n*https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/findutils.git/tree/find/parser.c?h=v4.6.0#n2847\n\n*https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/findutils.git/tree/find/parser.c?h=v4.6.0#n2944\nFrom that we see that there seems to be no way to turn off the path checking.\nThe exact rule it checks is: fail if the PATH is either empty or does not start with /.\n\nA: You could run the wrong program. Someone could make you run their program.\nThe -execdir action runs your command from the directory that contains the file(s) found. When $PATH contains relative paths, such as . or anything that doesn't start with /, -execdir is insecure because a directory where a file is found (or another directory resolved relative to it) could also contain an executable of the same name as the one you are trying to run. That potentially untrusted executable would then get run instead.\nThis could be deliberately exploited by another user to cause you to run their program, which might cause harm or breach data security, instead of the program you are trying to run. Or, less often, it might simply result in the wrong program inadvertently being run, even without anyone trying to make the problem happen.\nIf everything in your PATH environment variable is an absolute path, this error should not occur, even if the directory you're searching and -execdiring from is contained in PATH. (I've checked that this works.) If you believe you don't have any relative directories in $PATH but are still getting this error, please update your question with details including the output of echo \"$PATH\".\nA concrete example.\nAs an example of what could go wrong, suppose:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alice has . in her $PATH because she wants to be able to run programs in whatever directory she's cd'd to, without bothering to prepend their names with ./.\n\n*Alice's frenemy Eve has shared /home/eve/shared with Alice.\n\n*Alice wants statistics (lines, words, bytes) on the .c files Eve has shared with her.\n\n\nSo Alice runs:\nfind ~eve/shared -name \\*.c -execdir wc {} \\;\n\nUnfortunately for Alice, Eve has created her own script, named it wc, set it executable (chmod +x), and placed it clandestinely in one of the directories under /home/eve/shared. Eve's script looks like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n/usr/bin/wc \"$@\"\ndo_evil    # Eve replaces this command with whatver evil she wishes to do\nSo when Alice uses find with -execdir to run wc on the files Eve has shared, and it gets to files in the same directory as Eve's custom wc script, Eve's wc runs--with all of Alice's privileges!\n(Being crafty, Eve has made her wc script act as a wrapper for the system wc, so Alice won't even know something has gone wrong, i.e., that do_evil was run. However, simpler--and also more sophisticated--variations are possible.)\nHow find prevents this.\nfind prevents this security problem from happening by refusing to take the -execdir action when $PATH contains a relative directory.\nfind offers two diagnostic messages depending on the specific situation.\n\n\n*\n\n*If . is in $PATH, then (as you've seen) it says:\nfind: The current directory is included in the PATH environment variable, which is insecure in combination with the -execdir action of find.  Please remove the current directory from your $PATH (that is, remove \".\" or leading or trailing colons)\nIt probably has a special message for the . case as it's especially common.\n\n*If a relative path other than .--say, foo--appears in $PATH and you run find with -execdir, it says:\nfind: The relative path `foo' is included in the PATH environment variable, which is insecure in combination with the -execdir action of find.  Please remove that entry from $PATH\nIt's better not to have relative paths in $PATH at all.\nThe risk of having . or other relative paths in $PATH is especially heightened when using a utility that automatically changes the directory, which is why find won't let you use -execdir in this situation.\nBut having relative paths, especially ., in your $PATH is inherently risky and is really best avoided anyway. Consider the fictional situation in the example above. Suppose instead of running find, Alice simply cds to ~eve/shared/blah and runs wc *.c. If blah contains Eve's wc script, do_evil runs as Alice.\n\nA: The workaround is to pass custom PATH before the command, e.g.\nPATH=/usr/bin find . -type f -name 'partOfFileNames*' -execdir echo rm -- {} +\n\nAbove workaround will prevent loading the global $PATH, but our own.\n\nHere is another example (more flexible), assuming we want to run cat command:\nPATH=$(dirname $(which find)):$(dirname $(which cat)) find /etc -name hosts -execdir cat {} ';'\n\nor:\nPATH=$(dirname $(which cat find) | paste -sd:) find ...\n\nby running $(dirname $(which cat)) we calculate where our command to run is located.\n", "Q: Change minimum size of a window?

Select Line from the menu.\n\nSelect the style you want for the box's border and click ok.\n\n\nA: IMO it's better to use \"Insert > Frame > Frame...\" -- do not use a text box.\nSeveral reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Text in frames can use paragraph styles. Text that you enter into a text box may be formatted only by hand. If it's a large document, you will want to create a paragraph style for code, and use the paragraph style instead of direct formatting. Suppose you need to change the code font later. If you used styles, you can change the style and all code examples update. If you used text boxes and direct formatting, you will have to edit every text box by hand. Not recommended.\n\n*AFAICS normal paragraph text automatically avoids frames, whereas, when I tried text boxes, I had to set text wrapping manually.\nThe point about styles is important.

Logical volumes are contained by one or more physical volumes, which are partitions. This extra level of indirection buys flexibility -- but the details of that would be a significant detour from an answer to your question.\nIf you use the \"Something Else\" installation option and plan to re-use your existing LVM configuration, you must explicitly assign at least two or three partitions or volumes, and possibly some others:\n\n\n*\n\n*/boot -- If you use LVM, /boot must be a partition and outside of the LVM. This is true of Ubuntu, CentOS, or any other Linux. Thus, there's probably already a /boot partition, with a device filename such as /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, or something similar. This partition is normally pretty small -- typically in the 500MiB range.\n\n*root (/) -- You must assign one partition or logical volume as your root (/) filesystem -- that is, its \"mount point\" is /. People who are unfamiliar with Linux partitioning often neglect to set a device as root (/) and then don't understand why the installation won't proceed. In an LVM configuration, this filesystem is usually a logical volume. Note also that root (/) is the base of the filesystem tree; it is not the same as /root, which is the superuser's home directory. The root (/) filesystem can be as small as a few gibibytes or as big as the whole disk, depending on your needs and preferences.\n\n*swap -- Swap space is not strictly required, but most installations assign a partition or logical volume of one to two times the available RAM as swap space. In an LVM configuration, swap space is usually implemented as a logical volume.\n\n\nYour CentOS installation probably has a /boot partition and at least the two logical volumes I've just described. It may have other logical volumes for /home, /var, and other purposes. If you want to re-use these existing partitions and logical volumes, you may, but it's up to you to figure out what partitions and logical volumes to use for what purposes. The old functions should be pretty obvious, unless there are numerous logical volumes.\nAs to the installer entering an endless loop if you try to use the option to overwrite existing partitions, that definitely sounds like a bug. I recommend you file a bug report. Bugs will only be fixed if developers know about them, and it's unlikely that the right developer will stumble upon your post here.\nIf you don't want to use an LVM configuration (Ubuntu doesn't use LVM by default), you should be able to work around the bug you've found by using any partitioning tool to delete the existing partitions, then re-run the Ubuntu installer. If you do this, you don't need to worry about the LVM setup's logical volumes; when you delete the containing physical volume partition, the logical volumes will disappear. You should reboot after deleting a physical volume, though, to be sure the kernel isn't still trying to use the logical volumes.\n", "Q: Which process is accessing which IPs? After installing Conky and listing all my inbound and outbound connections I start to wonder what's actually happening and what and why things are happening.\n\nI'm getting a bit suspicious. How can I know which process is accessing which of these addresses?  \n\nA: If you only want to see those connection that arouse your suspicion you can really use lsof.\nsudo lsof -i | egrep -i \"cloudfront|poneytelecom|dark\"\n\nlsof -i restricts the output to internet connections.\nUse egrep (instead of grep) to be able to supply alternatives in the search string (separated by |), -i tells egrep to ignore case (DARK vs. dark).\nIf you have IP-addresses instead of hostnames use\nsudo lsof -ni | egrep -i \"10\\.0\\.8|193\\.170\"\n\n\nA: You can run lsof -n|grep TCP to know which programs are connecting to which IPs.\n\nA: My favorite tool dealing with processes and network usage is nethogs (install it with sudo apt-get install nethogs).\nThis tool displays every process and the bandwidth it consumes, it doesn't show the IP-addresses where the processes are connecting though.

Pressing Super + S on Ubuntu with workspaces enabled activates a workspace switcher/expo thing (I'm not sure what it's called, exactly, so I'm not sure what to search for). One thing that's bothering me about it (for purely aesthetic reasons) is that the launcher always appears on the left. \nI have no idea where I should go to configure the settings of whatever this is, because I'm not even sure what it's called. Is there a good way to do this in Ubuntu 14.04? I'm willing to go so far as removing or hiding the launcher completely (though it seems that that's not so easy), or installing another program to accomplish this.\n\nA: I know I'm answering my own question, but if anyone else is wondering how to do this, I discovered with a little tinkering that you can do this with the Compiz configuration settings manager.\nIn ccsm, under 'Expo' (what this thing is apparently called), there is an option in the 'Appearance' tab to 'Hide Panels/Docks'.

As locate just for the file names in the database file (thats why it is fast) while searching, you can consider it's technique not live.\nAlthough locate is showing the location of the file, it is very possible that the file is not present there (might be removed or moved to somewhere else). \nYou have two ways to be sure of whats going on:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can update the locate database file by sudo updatedb and then run the same locate command. \n\n*Alternately, you can use find to do a live search. To look for the file in your home directory recursively:\nfind ~ -type f -iname 'Origin90SR2DVD.iso' -print -o -path ~/.gvfs -prune\n\n-path ~/.gvfs -prune (thanks to Eliah Kagan) is used so that we do not descend into ~/.gvfs directory while searching. Otherwise we will get a distracting permission denied message, since the directory is owned by root. You can omit this (and see the message) by removing -print -o -path ~/.gvfs -prune.\nYou can also look for all possible places in the filesystem hierarchy. Here I have considered few places that can contain the file, it will be unusual if your file is found under any other directory.\nsudo find /home /root /opt /usr/local /mnt -type f -iname 'Origin90SR2DVD.iso'\n\nEDIT :\nlocate's database is updated by cron on a daily basis. In my system it is run at 6:25 AM everyday (check your's on /etc/crontab). \nActually anacron will run the cron job to ensure that if the computer is Off at that time, the job will be run after the computer is turned On next time.

No terminal needed.\nTo have the indicator-cpufreq program run at startup (so you don't need to start it yourself), go to Startup Applications (gnome-session-properties), and on the right hand side where you have Add, Remove, Edit, click Add.

It was not enough for my requirements so I had to uninstall it.

However, it has created the new problem that ipsec is not a recognized service.\n", "Q: Why does the system report 7.7Gb of total Ram when I installed 8Gb? Why does the system report 7.7Gb of total Ram when I installed 8Gb? I'm using 14.04 on a Dell Vostro 2011\n\nA: The BIOS will reserve some memory, as will the most primitive level of the kernel, including some for video, perhaps. What is reported to you via system-info (which I don't use) or free -m is what is left.\nIf you observe the entries in the /var/log/kern.log file from during boot, you will see many having to do with reserving memory and such, and finally, a summary line:\nMay  3 14:27:20 s15 kernel: [    0.000000] Memory: 15975452K/16472972K available (8029K kernel code, 1240K rwdata, 3736K rodata, 1424K init, 1292K bss, 497520K reserved, 0K cma-reserved)\n\n\nA: My system claimed to have 8 GB (gigabyte) of RAM. Ubuntu says it has 7.7 GiB (gibibyte). \n7.7 GiB (gibibyte) = 8.26781 GB (gigabyte)\n8 Gb (gigabit) = 1 GB (gigabyte)\n\nA: Because that's the actual size of your RAM.

So I have no way to answer the call, and the phone keeps ringing until the person calling eventually hangs up. very frustrating! I noticed also that when this hapens, the call does not even appear as a missed call in the notifications. I have to reboot the phone to get it back to normal. What causes this? is there a fix? How can I report this bug to the comunity?I am using the 21 version of the OS, and got the phone from bq a couple of weeks ago. many thanx ZTB\n\nA: It pretty clearly sounds like a bug.

Is there a way I can ask juju to do this for me before it bundles and pushes the files to the machine?\n\nA: Since you want to run charm_helpers_sync.py everytime you deploy the charm, I suspect you want to always have the latest version of python-charmhelpers. There is a much easyer way to accomplish this:\nAutomatically install charmhelpers using python-pip\nThe following function installs the charmhelpers using the repository and python-pip.\ndef install_charmhelpers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Install the charmhelpers library, if not present.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        import charmhelpers  # noqa\n    except ImportError:\n        import subprocess\n        subprocess.check_call(['apt-get', 'install', '-y', 'python-pip'])\n        subprocess.check_call(['pip', 'install', 'charmhelpers'])\n\nCall this function on the top of your hook scripts, above the charm-helper imports. Juju's python charm template shows a clean way to do this.\nWrite a Juju plugin to download charmhelpers source\nIf you really want Juju to download the charmhelpers code and include it in the charms, you'll have to write a Juju plugin.\n\n\n*\n\n*There was a talk about writing plugins on the Ubuntu Online Summit\n\n*You can find other Juju plugins on the Juju plugin github page\n", "Q: If someone switches user from my lock screen, can I get back into my session? Someone accessed my lock screen and switched user while I had some unsaved work in progress. Can I get back to my session? When I try to access it, it just appears as a new session.\n\nEDIT: I've just observed something that makes me think my original session still exists. Just to be clear, the progression of events is as follows: Someone accesses my lock screen and attempts to switch user to another account. That person doesn't access the other account. I switch back to my user account in the lock screen and unlock. A new session starts for me.\nI think that my original session exists because I can hear Skype (running in my old session and not in my new session) making noises. So... is there any way I could access this session?\n\nA: As you said, when you try to go back it says to create a new session, so probably the session was killed.

What should I do?\n\nA: Fixed it by:\nsudo dpkg -P unity-scope-gdrive account-plugin-google account-plugin-facebook\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nThis removes the packages listed in the first command and thus resolves the package conflict.\n\nA: By default, the package manager refuses to overwrite files that also appear in other installed packages (whether the file is actually there or not), which is a sane decision to not inadvertently corrupt packages. In your case, this means, that the packages are incompatible. I can see that one seems to come from a PPA, so you should write to the maintainer of that PPA to investigate the issue.\nMeanwhile, since the conflicting file is only and icon, it's pretty safe to override the package manager's decision with --force-overwrite:\ncd /tmp\napt-get download kde-config-telepathy-accounts\nsudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite kde-config-telepathy-accounts_*.deb\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\n\nA: I solved with the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the deb that is causing the problems:\nsudo find /var/cache -name \"kde-config-telepathy-accounts*\"\n\nIn my case the package was at\n/var/cache/apt/archives/kde-config-telepathy-accounts_4%3a15.12.3-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb\n\n\n*Install it with --force-overwrite:\nsudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/kde-config-telepathy-accounts_4%3a15.12.3-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb\n\nThe command will complete with errors anyway\n\n*Fix the installation\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n", "Q: Rename launchers If you have an application running, you can right click on the item in the unity starter, select \"Lock to Launcher\", and the program will stay there even if it is closed.\nThe problem is that the new launcher now has the title the window had when it was locked. This is often not only the name of the program, but also includes additional information, like app.js - My Project - Visual Studio Code. It will stay even after unlocking the app.\nIs it possible to rename the launcher without taking the hassle of creating a .desktop file? Where does unity saves the information of locked launchers?\n\nA: As @doug mentioned in his comment, all launchers can be found in dconf:\ndconf-editor com canonical unity launcher favorites or retrieve from cli with:\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites\n\nIn my case, it contained the entry application://code.desktop, and I found the code.desktop file via find in ~/.local/share/applications using:\nsudo find / -name \"code.desktop\"\n\n(this file was generated by unity when I locked the app). \nAfter editing the Name property in the .desktop file I restarted unity via unity --replace and the launcher now displays the appropriate name.\n", "Q: Skyrim Audio Choppy I am currently running Ubuntu 14.04.2. When I load Skyrim via PlayonLinux, the audio always becomes choppy and unbearable at times.

If your entire system's sound is OK and only Skyrim has this bug, then probably it is a Wine performance bug.\n", "Q: Juju - Cant login phpmyadmin I am using ubuntu 14.04.2, have juju installed in my MaaS server.\nIn my phpmyadmin logs:\n2015-05-08 22:48:49 INFO unit.phpmyadmin/0.config-changed logger.go:40 + install_phpmyadmin\n2015-05-08 22:48:49 INFO unit.phpmyadmin/0.config-changed logger.go:40 + [ -z  ]\n2015-05-08 22:48:49 INFO unit.phpmyadmin/0.config-changed logger.go:40 + [ aptitude != aptitude ]\n2015-05-08 22:48:49 INFO unit.phpmyadmin/0.config-changed logger.go:40 + [ !

You can do this through the UI after your cloud is deployed on the Openstack Dashboard.\nIf you want to know what happens under the covers\nJuju underneath supports expanding capacity of services and the nova compute charm also supports expanding capacity, that said, you could run into issues doing this, and it's entirely unsupported, dirty, messy and all that.  I would not recommend trying it if you are using the deployed cloud for anything live.\nSimilar to this question, you need to get access to the underlying openstack juju environment first.

Attempting to check the value of foo this way doesn't work in any Bourne-style shell--to examine the value of a variable with [, you must perform parameter expansion with $ (see below). This particular aspect of the problem is not shell-specific; for example, here's a test in 7 Bourne-style shells.\nFixing the Original Code\nPerhaps instead you meant to check the value of the foo variable (i.e., its contents, rather than its name) against those strings. In that case, your original code would become like:\nif [ \"$foo\" = bar -o \"$foo\" = car -o \"$foo\" = jar -o \"$foo\" = foo ]; then\n    echo yes\nfi\n\nThis can be shortened slightly with the short-circuit && operator:\n[ \"$foo\" = bar -o \"$foo\" = car -o \"$foo\" = jar -o \"$foo\" = foo ] && echo yes\n\nBut it's still longer and more complicated and repetitive than you probably prefer. So, moving on...\nShorter Forms via Pattern Matching\nYou can use the [[ facility's built-in regular expression matching operator:\n[[ $foo =~ ^(bar|car|jar|foo)$ ]] && echo yes\n\nWhile using case is probably the most common way, [[ with =~ is:\n\n\n*\n\n*the same length as a compact use of case (see below)\n\n*arguably truer to the logic of your original code, in that it uses [[, which works much like a test expression.\n\n\nSo you might prefer that. It's the method I would probably use, to do this in bash.\nIf you wanted to do something like that but match using grep instead of [[ with =~, this is similar:\ngrep -Eq '^(bar|car|jar|foo)$' <<< \"$foo\" && echo yes\n\nOr this:\ngrep -Fqe{bar,car,jar,foo} <<< \"$foo\" && echo yes\n\nA One-Liner with case\nAs Serg says, can be simplified using case instead of if and [. That's the classic and probably the most common way.\nThe method in Serg's answer works perfectly well, but for the particular code you're refactoring, we can write something simpler, by using only one pattern for case. There is no need to have a catch-all *) match at the end. If the string doesn't match any of the patterns, control simply falls through the case construct and no commands are executed, which is equivalent to your if construct with no else.\ncase $foo in bar|car|jar|foo) echo yes;; esac\n\nThat makes it short and simple enough to easily fit--and be readable--on a single line (which seems to be what you're looking for). This method is also portable to Bourne-style shells other than bash.\n\nA: I suggest using case structure. Something like:\ncase $foo in\n    foo|car|bar|jar) echo yes ;;\n    *) ;;\nesac\n\nIf you like, you can add a command between *) and ;; to be executed when $foo doesn't match foo, car, bar, or jar. For example, you could print a message with echo 'wrong input' or something like that.\n", "Q: Cloning Playonlinux Virtual Drives I have a virtual drive on Playonlinux with some application which only allows one instance of itself to run.

It's obviously got to be recursively descended to find the dependencies of the dependencies but apt can obviously do that as well.  \nOnce the dependencies are all worked out and placed in the correct order (some dependencies need to be installed before other dependencies can be installed), apt is simply asked to install the dependencies.  Then the package which was given as an argument to Gdebi is installed.\nThe dependencies and the target package are installed in two operations for two reasons. First the format of an apt call to install a local .deb is different from an apt call to install dependencies from a repository.  Second, separating the calls ensures the dependencies are all installed before the target package.\n\nA: Actually gdebi is just a front-end to the dpkg with added functionality that it can check for dependency packages in the repositories and can install them in one-operation, while dpkg -i requires two operations manually (later being apt-get -f install). \nQuestion 1:\n\n1) How gdebi do this? install .deb Packages with Dependencies without using Apt PPA links added manually in configuration files?\n\nBeing a dpkg front-end, it can use all of the functionality of dpkg. Since every .deb package file contains (provided that they are not corrupt) metadata about that deb file (like package name, maintainer, dependencies etc), it can easily check this file's dependency. \nFor example, you can check a .deb file's metadata using dpkg --info package-name.deb \nAnd then it uses these information to construct dependency map and mark the locally available .deb files as already downloaded and download other .deb files from Internet.\nTake note that, those needed extra packages must be available (with proper version) in at least one of the repositories, which are configured in the system.\nThen it proceed to like a normal apt installation. The difference is it doesn't re-download the main .deb file\nQuestion 2:\n\n(2) Can I use same gdebi command ( sudo su -c gdebi my.deb )to install all other deb packages without adding a PPA? or do I have to change format sudo su -c myn.deb where n is version of software etc?\n\nThe PPAs exists for a reason. The main reason is they provide latest versions of packages . And these higher versioned package usually depends on higher versions of sub-packages also, which are also normally served from the PPA, not from standard Ubuntu repository.\nExample Scenario:\nSuppose, A package named mother-package has the highest version of 2.0 in Standard Ubuntu repositories, and this mother-package depends on a package named child-package of version 2. Also suppose, some PPA provides mother-package of version 3.0 which requires on child-package of 3.0, both of them are available via that PPA repository. \nThe problem is, if you now download mother-package-3.0.deb from the repository page and try to install it with gdebi, you'll (or gdebi) fail. \nBecause, checking the mother-package-3.0.deb file, gdebi knew that this mother-package needs child-package of version 3.0 or higher, but It only knows the location of version 2.0. It doesn't know where to fetch the version 3.0 of child-package from. This is expected because, You didn't tell the system where you get this latest mother-package. In other words, You didn't configured the repository list to include that PPA. \nSo, the Obvious answer is of this question is It depends. If the necessary dependencies can be found in already configured repositories, the installation will be successful. But if not, then it'll fail to install this highered versioned package. That's why you still need PPAs and that is the easiest way without manually doing all these.\nThe second part of the second question didn't make sense to me.\n", "Q: Reduce Grub Menu Items I have done quite a bit of fiddling and reinstalling of grub.

I installed it from the packages via apt-get.\nNow wordpress complains almost every day about available updates per mail and that an auto-update has failed. Trying to update it from the wordpress dashboard fails as well.\nSo my general question is: what is the best practice on updating wordpress on ubuntu?\n\n\n*\n\n*Going with the ubuntu packages only. If there are any security problems with the ubuntu version, will it be fixed automatically via the daily security updates? If so, how one can disable the nagging update emails?\n\n*Going with the wordpress updates directly. Besides making that work within ubuntu, is that recommended? What happens, if I performed updates via wordpress directly, but now comes and update from the package manager? Will it probably downgrade my wordpress? Will it maybe break the updated package?\n\n*Going with a \"native\" wordpress installation. Forgetting about the ubuntu wordpress packages at all and install wordpress via tar.gz or whatever.\nTo be clear: I'm not after the latest wordpress features and fancy plugins, but after a stable, security-managed version.\nAny recommendations?\n\nA: You could go with either the first or third option, but your middle option is not really cleanly possible.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Going with the ubuntu packages only\n  \n\nIf you do this, you rely on Ubuntu for security updates rather than getting them from Wordpress.  The advantage to this is that you'll benefit from the work Ubuntu (well, Debian) has done getting Wordpress to integrate well with your OS and it'll be easy to set up.  But the disadvantage is you will stay on older versions.\nAs for security support, the wordpress package is in \"universe\" meaning that Ubuntu don't promise to give official security support.  It also means that it's imported with relatively few changes from Debian's repositories, so ultimately security support will depend both on Debian and on Ubuntu's ability to migrate across any major bug fixes.  If your PHP and MySQL installation is securely set up in general, this will probably be fine.\nThe nagging you get about updates would probably be considered a bug by Debian and/or Ubuntu, but they can't/won't fix it because only security related issues are important enough to fix in an existing release.  So in other words it may be fixed in a future version of Ubuntu, who knows.\n\n\n  \n*Going with the wordpress updates directly. \n  \n\nYou won't be able to get this working cleanly if you're using Ubuntu's wordpress packages.  If you did, as you said, an update from Ubuntu would wipe away and potentially downgrade all the changes you did.  Modifying files installed by Ubuntu packages is not recommended in most cases.\n\n\n  \n*Going with a \"native\" wordpress installation.\n  \n\nThis would be my recommendation in this case as you will be able to upgrade it on your own schedule and get updates directly from Wordpress.\n\nA: In my experience #3 will serve your purpose, since the native WordPress updater works well. As you've already found, it also conflicts with Ubuntu packaging.\nOn LTS, don't expect patches other than for stability and security. The 14.04.1 Wordpress package is on version 3.8.2+dfsg-1ubuntu0.1. Upstream is at 4.2.2. There does not seem to be a Vivid backport available.\nHere are my notes from a quick 4.4.2 Wordpress.org test install on 14.04.1:\nsudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mysql mysql-server ## write down password for mysql root user\nsudo service apache2 reload\nwget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz\ntar xzvf latest.tar.gz\nsudo mv wordpress/ /var/www/html/\nsudo chown -R www-data.root /var/www/html/wordpress/\n\nmysql -u root -p ##enter password at prompt\ncreate database my_wordpress;\ncreate user 'my_wordpress'@'localhost' identified by 'my_password';\ngrant all on my_wordpress.* to 'my_wordpress'@'localhost';\nexit\n\nVisit localhost/wordpress in your browser and follow the wizard to complete setup.

How do I do that?\nAnd the /Debian thing, is missing too many applications like Web Browser and doesn't even have icons. How can I make it update, and seperate the directories in /Debian out like CrunchBang?\n\nA: Changing the color of the openbox menu can be done with the program openbox configuration manager or obconf from the command line. Lubuntu comes with several different themes preinstalled. To choose that particular theme for the color of the menu looks like oynx-Citrus. If you wish to add an external theme like one you downloaded from boxlook.org you can click the install new theme and point it at the .obt archive. If you have lxappearnce and lxappearnce-obconf the window border tab also lets you have the same functionality just in a different application. \nThe content and the items in the menu are actually stored in an xml file. The full specification is found at http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Menus. If you want a GUI application to make your own custom menus I suggest the obmenu package. http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/utopic/en/man1/obmenu.1.html\n\nA: All you need to add to your menu.xml is something like\n<separator label=\"Openbox 3\"/> \n\nThis produces a separator with the label (or title) Openbox 3. If you just have:\n<separator/>\n\nyou'll get a simple line between items. For example, if you do this:\n<item label=\"term\">\n  <!-- stuff goes here -->\n</item>\n<separator label=\"Applications\"/>\n<item label=\"emacs\">\n  <!-- stuff goes here -->\n</item>\n<separator/>\n<item label=\"www\">\n  <!-- stuff goes here -->\n</item>\n\nYour Openbox menu will have an Applications-labelled separator between the items term and emacs, followed by a thin line separating emacs from www.\nOf course, there's a lot more to the specification, but adding labelled separators is quite easy.\n", "Q: How can I install ffmpeg on Lubuntu 14.04? It seems that the original ffmpeg has been dropped by Debian for the moment (in favour of the fork libav)  but will be back in 15.\nSome people seem to think ffmpeg is deprecated or stale: it's not, it's just that in 2011,  a group of devs decided to fork it as avcodec (libav).\nI use get_iplayer for BBC downloads and that requires ffmpeg for its automated format conversions. So I was a bit surprised to find that a brand new install of Lubuntu 14.04 (LTS)  doesn't include ffmpeg.\nHow can I install ffmpeg?\n\nA: Answer posted as Question:\n\nThere are lots of bits of advice on the web most of which doesn't work because of stale repositories and so on.

Wants to Remove Ubuntu and Install Win7 I recently purchased a desktop just for office use. It did not come with an OS. I had someone install Ubuntu to prepare it for ViciDial because I work at home and some clients ask for me to provide for my own dialer. The guy said that I need Ubuntu for the ViciDial to work but he did not finish what he started and I can no longer find him.\nI don't know how to use Ubuntu. I searched online on what to do. I followed instructions on what keys to press and my partner and I even went as far as pressing keys from ESC to F12, to Shift (press and hold) and Del but we were still not able to access the boot menu so we can install the Win7 from a CD. Every time we turn the PC on, it just shows a black background with a gray text field in the middle asking for a password. We don't know what the password is.\nI'm sorry if I cannot provide other details. I don't have any other information on what he did with the computer. I'm lost and I just want to use my PC again.\nIn addition, can I still use Win7 if I setup ViciDial? \n\nA: it's a boot password i think, this article may help:\nHow to Secure Your Computer With a BIOS or UEFI Password\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't boot after installing alongside windows 7 I'll tell you my problem first then explain how it all happened.

I am reasonably new to Linux, so any assistance that can be offered would be helpful.\nIf it helps, I am running Ubuntu 14.04 x64 on two VirtualBox machines.\nI've installed MySQL server on a machine that appears to be working as I can create databases, tables, insert and remove data and run queries without any issue.  I've create a database called my_db and a user called db_root within MySQL.\nI am now trying to connect to this MySQL server from another machine but I don't seem to be able to get the ODBC connection working.  I've looked at a number of online instructions, but they pretty much all give the same set of instructions.\nStarted off by install unixODBC, unixODBC-dev and libmyodbc.  Then edited the /etc/odbcinst.ini file.  Mine looks like:-\n[MySQL]\nDescription = ODBC for MySQL\nDriver = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/odbc/libmyodbc.so\nSetup = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/odbc/libodbcmyS.so\nFileUsage = 1\n\nThen edit the /etc/odbc.ini file.  Mine looks like:-\n[mysql-connector]\nDriver       = MySQL\nDescription  = ODBC for MySQL\nServer       = 192.168.1.1\nPort         = 3306\nUser         = db_root\nPassword     = password\nDatabase     = my_db\nOption       = 3\nSocket       =\n\nThis is where some instructions change.  Some say that there should be a file called mysql.sock or mysqld.sock in the directory /var/lib/mysql and this file should be set as the path for the SOCKET in the odbc.ini file. I have no mysql directory inside /var/lib and searching my machine for mysql.sock and mysqld.sock turns up blank.  Some instructions do include the SOCKET field in the odbc.ini file.\nAll the instructions then say, test your connection with the command something like echo \"select 1\" | isql -v mysql-connector.  I always get the same error of [S1000][unixODBC][MySQL][ODBC 5.1 Driver]Can't connect to MySQL server on '192.168.1.1' (111).\nI've been searching for days, but can't seem to find anything that might point me in the right direction to resolving this.\n\nA: After a bit more searching, I found the answer was the MySQL setup.  In the /etc/mysql/my.cnf, MySQL was only listening on port 3306 for local traffic.  This was fixed by removing the line bind-address = 127.0.0.1 in the my.cnf file.\n", "Q: How to make wallpaper that changes throughout the day- brightness to be precise How to change brightness of wallpapers with time of the day, like the default wallpaper given.\nWhat tutorials suggest is to use a picture slide-show or applications like F.lux.\nBut I want to automate the brightness only of the image based on time, just like the default wallpaper given in Ubuntu.\n\nA: Wherever I've written USER, change it to your username (e.g. mine is tim).\nCreate a new folder, perhaps in your pictures folder, and navigate to it:\nmkdir /home/$USER/Pictures/Wallpaper\ncd /home/$USER/Pictures/Wallpaper\n\nmake a new file, make it executable, and edit it:\ntouch bgchange.sh\nchmod +x bgchange.sh\ngedit bgchange.sh\n\nAdd the following to the file (where is says USER below you need to change this to your user):\n#! /bin/bash\n\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri 'file:///home/USER/Pictures/Wallpaper/'$(date +%H)'.png'\n\nThat will change the image on the hour to an image with the hour name (i.e. at 1pm (13:00) it will change the background to an image called 13.png.\nNow to create the images. Simply run this command:\nfor i in {0..23}; do convert -brightness-contrast $(($i*2))x0 image.png $i.png; done\n\nYou will end up with a series of images, each \"2\" brighter than the previous. The darkest (original) will be 0.png, the brightest 23.png. It will look a little like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may want to rename these to change the order, but make sure there is an image for every hour (0 to 23).\nFinally, the script needs to start at boot:\nRun this command, and press enter (2 is selected by default):\ncrontab -e\n\nand add this line:\n0 * * * * /home/USER/Pictures/Wallpaper/bgchange.sh\n\nThen press Ctrl+X, type Y and press enter.

First, as you already know, the file /etc/default/crda should have, in your case, one uncommented line:\nREGDOMAIN=DE\n\nSecond, it is the module cfg80211 that is complaining in dmesg; let's try to fix it:\nsudo -i\necho \"options cfg80211 ieee80211_regdom=DE\"  >  /etc/modprobe.d/cfg80211.conf\nexit\n\nFinally, since your wireless interface is \"Managed,\" that is, managed by the router as to channels, bit-rate, etc., I strongly suspect that if the router or more especially its firmware, was built for use in the USA, the router sets a CRDA allowing only certain channels to be used. I suggest you update the firmware from the router manufacturers' German or at least European website to see if it helps.  Reboot the router.\nReboot and see if connectivity has improved. CRDA is but one recommendation I make to help issues like yours.

The country code is evidently hard-coded in the device ROM. The only way I can connect is to check this in dmesg:\ncfg80211: Calling CRDA for country: CN\n\nAnd then set the same region:\nsudo iw reg set CN\n\nThe USB connected immediately.\n", "Q: what to do if I accidently changed .bin file?

Even for real-world use that's reasonable--if you needed excellent performance you wouldn't be using bash, and a hundred (or so) assignments is still fast. But it would stop being reasonable if extended to a way bigger range (like a million).\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\np(){ for i in `seq $2 $3`; do g[$i]=$1; done; }\np A 90 100; p B 80 89; p C 70 79; p D 60 69; p F 0 59\nwhile read -r n && [[ ! $n =~ ^[qQ] ]]; do echo ${g[$n]}; done\n\nAdvantages:\n\n*\n\n*It's not really that esoteric. Although it's longer than the shortest solutions, and not quite as self-documenting as the longer solutions... it's reasonably self-documenting, while still decidedly on the tiny side.\n\n*It allows easy modification to change grade ranges or add/remove grades.\n\n*It operates in a loop and quits on q, quit, or anything starting with q/Q.\n\n*Lists the higher grades first, to help you think positive. :)\n\n*Hmm, this does the job, keeps making sense even after you look at it, and has the essential features. You could actually use this!\nDisadvantages:\n\n*\n\n*It gives you an F when you put in non-numeric input... but that's not really so bad, is it? If you give a non-number where a number is needed, maybe you deserve an F!\n\n*Ambiguous, possibly octal input is treated as octal (since g is a one-dimensional indexed array). As the old saying goes, \"It's not a bug, it's a feature!\" Well, maybe.\n\n*Input that's out of range or not a number causes an empty line to be printed. There's nothing really wrong with that though: it tells you what letter grade corresponds to your input, and for wrong input there isn't one.\n\n*Put in a negative number, and it... well, call it an easter egg.\n\n*Still significantly longer than Tim's python solution. Yeah, I can't really spin that to seem like an advantage.\n\nKinda cool, huh? (Well, I think so.)\nHow It Works\n\n*\n\n*The p function populates a numerically indexed array g of grades, at indexes ranging from its first argument to its second, with the (letter) value given in its third argument.\n\n*p is called for each letter grade, to define its numeric range.\n\n*Keep reading user input as long as it's available and doesn't start with q (or Q), checking the g array for which letter grade corresponds to the number entered, and printing that letter.\n\n\nA: And here is my awk version:\nawk '{\n  if($_ <= 100 && $_ >= 0) {\n      sub(/^([0-9]|[1-5][0-9])$/, \"F\", $_);\n      sub(/^(6[0-9])$/, \"D\", $_);\n      sub(/^(7[0-9])$/, \"C\", $_);\n      sub(/^(8[0-9])$/, \"B\", $_);\n      sub(/^(9[0-9]|100)$/, \"A\", $_);\n      print\n    }\n    else {\n      print \"Only numbers between 0..100\"\n    }\n}' -\n\nor as one-liner:\nawk '{if($_ <= 100 && $_ >= 0) { sub(/^([0-9]|[1-5][0-9])$/, \"F\", $_); sub(/^(6[0-9])$/, \"D\", $_); sub(/^(7[0-9])$/, \"C\", $_); sub(/^(8[0-9])$/, \"B\", $_);sub(/^(9[0-9]|100)$/, \"A\", $_);   print} else { print \"Only numbers between 0..100\"}}' -\n\n\nA: Here's another \"esoteric\" answer\nperl -E '\n    print \"number: \"; \n    $n = <>; \n    say qw/A A B C D E F F F F F/[11-($n+1)/10]\n       if $n=~/^\\s*\\d/ and 0<=$n and $n<=100\n'\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*perl -E : the -E, like -e, allows passing a script as a command line argument. This is a way to run perl one-liners. Unlike -e, -E also enables all optional features (such as say, which is basically a print with a trailing newline. ).\n\n*print \"number: \"; : prompt the user to enter a number.\n\n*$n = <>; : save that number as $n.\n\n\nThe next bit needs to be broken down a little. qw/string/ evaluates to a list made by breaking string at whitespace. So, qw/A A B C D E F F F F F/ is actually this list:\n0 : A\n1 : A\n2 : B\n3 : C\n4 : D\n5 : E\n6 : F\n7 : F\n8 : F\n9 : F\n10 : F\n\nTherefore, say qw/A A B C D E F F F F F/[11-($n+1)/10] is equivalent to\nmy @F=(\"A\",\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"D\",\"E\",\"F\",\"F\",\"F\",\"F\",\"F\");\nprint \"$F[11-($n+1)/10]\\n\"\n\nNow, Perl allows using negative indices to retrieve elements counting from the end of the array. For example, $arrray[-1] will print the last element of the array. In  addition, floating point array indices (e.g. 10.7) are automatically truncated to the next lower integer (10.7, or 10.3 or whatever all become 10.)\nThe result of all this is that the index 11-($n+1)/10 always evaluates to the appropriate element (grade) of the array. \n\nA: You already have the basic idea. If you want to code this in bash (which is a reasonable choice since it is the default shell on Ubuntu and most other Linuxes), you can't use case because it doesn't understand ranges. Instead, you could use if/else:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nread -p \"Please enter your choice: \" response\n\n## If the response given did not consist entirely of digits\nif [[ ! $response =~ ^[0-9]*$ ]]\nthen\n    ## If it was Quit or quit, exit\n    [[ $response =~ [Qq]uit ]] && exit\n    ## If it wasn't quit or Quit but wasn't a number either,\n    ## print an error message and quit.\n    echo \"Please enter a number between 0 and 100 or \\\"quit\\\" to exit\" && exit\nfi\n## Process the other choices\nif [ $response -le 59 ]\nthen\n    echo \"F\"\nelif [ $response -le 69 ]\nthen\n    echo \"D\"\nelif  [ $response -le 79 ]\nthen\n    echo \"C\"\nelif  [ $response -le 89 ]\nthen\n    echo \"B\"\nelif [ $response -le 100 ]\nthen\n    echo \"A\"\nelif [ $response -gt 100 ]\nthen\n    echo \"Please enter a number between 0 and 100\"\n     exit\nfi\n\n\nA: Brevity vs. Readability: A Middle Ground\nAs you've seen, this problem admits to solutions that are moderately long and somewhat repetitive but highly readable (terdon's and A.B.'s bash answers), as well as those that are very short but non-intuitive and much less self-documenting (Tim's python and bash answers and glenn jackman's perl answer). All these approaches are valuable.\nYou can also solve this problem with code in the middle of the continuum between compactness and readability. This approach is almost as readable as the longer solutions, with a length closer to the small, esoteric solutions.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nread -erp 'Enter numeric grade (q to quit): '\ncase $REPLY in [qQ]) exit;; esac\n\ndeclare -A cutoffs\ncutoffs[F]=59 cutoffs[D]=69 cutoffs[C]=79 cutoffs[B]=89 cutoffs[A]=100\n\nfor letter in F D C B A; do\n    ((REPLY <= cutoffs[$letter])) && { echo $letter; exit; }\ndone\necho \"Grade out of range.\"\n\nIn this bash solution, I've included some blank lines to enhance readability, but you could remove them if you wanted it even shorter.\nBlank lines included, this is actually only slightly shorter than a compactified, still pretty readable variant of A.B.'s bash solution. Its main advantages over that method are:\n\n*\n\n*It's more intuitive.\n\n*It's easier to change the boundaries between grades (or add additional grades).\n\n*It automatically accepts input with leading and trailing spaces (see below for an explanation of how (( )) works).\n\nAll three of these advantages arise because this method uses the user's input as numeric data rather than by manually examining its constituent digits.\nHow it Works\n\n*\n\n*Read input from the user. Let them use the arrow keys to move around in the text they've entered (-e) and don't interpret \\ as an escape character (-r).\nThis script is not a feature-rich solution--see below for a refinement--but those useful features only make it two characters longer. I recommend always using -r with read, unless you know you need to let the user supply \\ escapes.\n\n*If the user wrote q or Q, quit.\n\n*Create an associative array (declare -A). Populate it with the highest numeric grade associated with each letter grade.\n\n*Loop through the letter grades from lowest to highest, checking if the user-provided number is low enough to fall into each letter grade's numeric range.\nWith (( )) arithmetic evaluation, variable names don't need to be expanded with $. (In most other situations, if you want to use a variable's value in place of its name, you must do this.)\n\n*If it falls in the range, print the grade and exit.\nFor brevity, I use the short-circuit and operator (&&) rather than an if-then.\n\n*If the loop finishes and no range has been matched, assume the number entered is too high (over 100) and tell the user it was out of range.\n\nHow this Behaves, with Weird Input\nLike the other short solutions posted, that script doesn't check the input before assuming it's a number. Arithmetic evaluation ((( ))) automatically strips leading and trailing whitespace, so that's no problem, but:\n\n*\n\n*Input that doesn't look like a number at all is interpreted as 0.\n\n*With input that looks like a number (i.e., if it starts with a digit) but contains invalid characters, the script emits errors.\n\n*Multi-digit input starting with 0 is interpreted as being in octal. For example, the script will tell you 77 is a C, while 077 is a D. Although some users may want this, most probably don't and it can cause confusion.\n\n*On the plus side, when given an arithmetic expression, this script automatically simplifies it and determines the associated letter grade. For example, it will tell you 320/4 is a B.\n\nAn Expanded, Fully Featured Version\nFor those reasons, you may want to use something like this expanded script, which checks to ensure the input is good, and includes some other enhancements.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nshopt -s extglob\n\ndeclare -A cutoffs\ncutoffs[F]=59 cutoffs[D]=69 cutoffs[C]=79 cutoffs[B]=89 cutoffs[A]=100\n\nwhile read -erp 'Enter numeric grade (q to quit): '; do\n    case $REPLY in  # allow leading/trailing spaces, but not octal (e.g. \"03\") \n        *( )@([1-9]*([0-9])|+(0))*( )) ;;\n        *( )[qQ]?([uU][iI][tT])*( )) exit;;\n        *) echo \"I don't understand that number.\"; continue;;\n    esac\n\n    for letter in F D C B A; do\n        ((REPLY <= cutoffs[$letter])) && { echo $letter; continue 2; }\n    done\n    echo \"Grade out of range.\"\ndone\n\nThis is still a pretty compact solution.\nWhat features does this add?\nThe key points of this expanded script are:\n\n*\n\n*Input validation. terdon's script checks input with if [[ ! $response =~ ^[0-9]*$ ]] ..., so I show another way, which sacrifices some brevity but is more robust, allowing the user to enter leading and trailing spaces and refusing to allow an expression that might or might not be intended as octal (unless it's zero).\n\n*I've used case with extended globbing instead of [[ with the =~ regular expression matching operator (as in terdon's answer). I did that to show that (and how) it can also be done that way. Globs and regexps are two ways of specifying patterns that match text, and either method is fine for this application.\n\n*Like A.B.'s bash script, I've enclosed the whole thing in an outer loop (except the initial creation of the cutoffs array). It requests numbers and gives corresponding letter grades as long as terminal input is available and the user hasn't told it to quit. Judging by the do...done around the code in your question, it looks like you want that.\n\n*To make quitting easy, I accept any case-insensitive variant of q or quit.\n\nThis script uses a few constructs that may be unfamiliar to novices; they're detailed below.\nExplanation: Use of continue\nWhen I want to skip over the rest of the body of the outer while loop, I use the continue command. This brings it back up to the top of the loop, to read more input and run another iteration.\nThe first time I do this, the only loop I'm in is the outer while loop, so I can call continue with no argument. (I'm in a case construct, but that doesn't affect the operation of break or continue.)\n        *) echo \"I don't understand that number.\"; continue;;\n\nThe second time, however, I'm in an inner for loop which is itself nested inside the outer while loop. If I used continue with no argument, this would be equivalent to continue 1 and would continue the inner for loop instead of the outer while loop.\n        ((REPLY <= cutoffs[$letter])) && { echo $letter; continue 2; }\n\nSo in that case, I use continue 2 to make bash find and continue the second loop out instead.\nExplanation: case Labels with Globs\nI don't use case to figure out which letter grade bin a number falls into (as in A.B.'s bash answer). But I do use case to decide if the user's input should be considered:\n\n*\n\n*a valid number, *( )@([1-9]*([0-9])|+(0))*( )\n\n*the quit command, *( )[qQ]?([uU][iI][tT])*( )\n\n*anything else (and thus invalid input), *\nThese are shell globs.\n\n*\n\n*Each is followed by a ) that is not matched by any opening (, which is case's syntax for separating a pattern from the commands that run when it is matched.\n\n*;; is case's syntax for indicating the end of commands to run for a paticular case match (and that no subsequent cases should be tested after running them).\n\nOrdinary shell globbing provides * to match zero or more characters, ? to match exactly one character, and character classes/ranges in [ ] brackets. But I'm using extended globbing, which goes beyond that. Extended globbing is enabled by default when using bash interactively, but is disabled by default when running a script. The shopt -s extglob command at the top of the script turns it on.\nExplanation: Extended Globbing\n*( )@([1-9]*([0-9])|+(0))*( ), which checks for numeric input, matches a sequence of:\n\n*\n\n*Zero or more spaces (*( )). The *( ) construct matches zero or more of the pattern in the parentheses, which here is just a space.\nThere are actually two kinds of horizontal whitespace, spaces and tabs, and often it's desirable to match tabs also. But I'm not worrying about that here, because this script is written for manual, interactive input, and the -e flag to read enables GNU readline. This is so the user can move back and forth in their text with the left and right arrow keys, but it has the side effect of generally preventing tabs from being entered literally.\n\n*One occurrence (@( )) of either (|):\n\n*\n\n*A nonzero digit ([1-9]) followed by zero or more (*( )) of any digit ([0-9]).\n\n*One or more (+( )) of 0.\n\n\n\n*Zero or more spaces (*( )), again.\n\n*( )[qQ]?([uU][iI][tT])*( ), which checks for the quit command, matches a sequence of:\n\n*\n\n*Zero or more spaces (*( )).\n\n*q or Q ([qQ]).\n\n*Optionally--i.e., zero or one occurrences (?( ))--of:\n\n*\n\n*u or U ([uU]) followed by i or I ([iI]) followed by t or T ([tT]).\n\n\n\n*Zero or more spaces (*( )), again.\n\nVariant: Validating Input with an Extended Regular Expression\nIf you prefer to test the user's input against a regular expression rather than a shell glob, you might prefer to use this version, which works the same but uses [[ and =~ (like in terdon's answer) instead of case and extended globbing.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nshopt -s nocasematch\n\ndeclare -A cutoffs\ncutoffs[F]=59 cutoffs[D]=69 cutoffs[C]=79 cutoffs[B]=89 cutoffs[A]=100\n\nwhile read -erp 'Enter numeric grade (q to quit): '; do\n    # allow leading/trailing spaces, but not octal (e.g., \"03\")\n    if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^\\ *([1-9][0-9]*|0+)\\ *$ ]]; then\n        [[ $REPLY =~ ^\\ *q(uit)?\\ *$ ]] && exit\n        echo \"I don't understand that number.\"; continue\n    fi\n\n    for letter in F D C B A; do\n        ((REPLY <= cutoffs[$letter])) && { echo $letter; continue 2; }\n    done\n    echo \"Grade out of range.\"\ndone\n\nPossible advantages of this approach are that:\n\n*\n\n*In this particular case, the syntax is a little simpler, at least in the second pattern, where I check for the quit command. This is because I was able to set the nocasematch shell option, and then all case variants of q and quit were covered automatically.\nThat's what the shopt -s nocasematch command does. The shopt -s extglob command is omitted as globbing isn't used in this version.\n\n\n*Regular expression skills are more common than proficiency in bash's extglobs.\nExplanation: Regular Expressions\nAs for the patterns specified to the right of the =~ operator, here's how those regular expressions work.\n^\\ *([1-9][0-9]*|0+)\\ *$, which checks for numeric input, matches a sequence of:\n\n*\n\n*The beginning--i.e., left edge--of the line (^).\n\n*Zero or more (*, applied postfix) spaces. A space does not ordinarily need to be \\-escaped in a regular expression, but this is needed with [[ to prevent a syntax error.\n\n*A substring (( )) that is one or the other (|) of:\n\n*\n\n*[1-9][0-9]*: a nonzero digit ([1-9]) followed by zero or more (*, applied postfix) of any digit ([0-9]).\n\n*0+: one or more (+, applied postfix) of 0.\n\n\n\n*Zero or more spaces (\\ *), as before.\n\n*The end--i.e., right edge--of the line ($).\n\nUnlike case labels, which match against the whole expression being tested, =~ returns true if any part of its left-hand expression matches the pattern given as its right-hand expression. This is why the ^ and $ anchors, specifying the beginning and end of the line, are needed here, and don't correspond syntactically to anything appearing in the method with case and extglobs.\nThe parentheses are needed to make ^ and $ bind to the disjunction of [1-9][0-9]* and 0+. Otherwise it would be the disjunction of ^[1-9][0-9]* and 0+$, and match any input starting with a nonzero digit or ending with a 0 (or both, which might still include non-digits in between).\n^\\ *q(uit)?\\ *$, which checks for the quit command, matches a sequence of:\n\n*\n\n*The beginning of the line (^).\n\n*Zero or more spaces (\\ *, see above explanation).\n\n*The letter q. Or Q, since shopt nocasematch is enabled.\n\n*Optionally--i.e., zero or one occurrences (postfix ?)--of the substring (( )):\n\n*\n\n*u, followed by i, followed by t. Or, since shopt nocasematch is enabled u may be U; independently, i may be I; and independently, t may be T. (That is, the possibilities are not limited to uit and UIT.)\n\n\n\n*Zero or more spaces again (\\ *).\n\n*The end of the line ($).\n\n\nA: #!/bin/bash\n\nwhile true\ndo\n  read -p \"Please enter your choice: \" choice\n\n  case \"$choice\"\n   in\n      [0-9]|[1-5][0-9])\n          echo \"F\"\n          ;;\n      6[0-9])\n          echo \"D\"\n          ;;\n      7[0-9])\n          echo \"C\"\n          ;;\n      8[0-9])\n          echo \"B\"\n          ;;\n      9[0-9]|100)\n          echo \"A\"\n          ;;\n      [Qq])\n          exit 0\n          ;;\n      *) echo \"Only numbers between 0..100, q for quit\"\n          ;;\n  esac\ndone\n\nand a more compact version (Thx @EliahKagan):\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nwhile read -erp 'Enter numeric grade (q to quit): '; do\n    case $REPLY in\n        [0-9]|[1-5][0-9])   echo F ;;\n        6[0-9])             echo D ;;\n        7[0-9])             echo C ;;\n        8[0-9])             echo B ;;\n        9[0-9]|100)         echo A ;;\n\n        [Qq])               exit ;;\n        *)                  echo 'Only numbers between 0..100, q for quit' ;;\n    esac\ndone\n\n\nA: Although you asked for a bash solution, I think in python, this can be done in an elegant an short way. Covering both handling errors in case of incorrect input and the \"conversion\" of a number between 0 and 100 into letters from A to F (or any other):\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\ntry:\n    n = int(input(\"number: \")); n = n if n>0 else \"\"\n    print(\"FEDCBA\"[[n>=f for f in [50,60,70,80,90,101]].count(True)])\nexcept:\n    print(\"invalid input\")\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*First we need to get the number from the user:\nn = int(input(\"number: \"))\n\n\n*We test this number to be valid for a number of conditions:\nn>=50, n>=60, n>=70, n>=80, n>=90\n\nFor each of these tests, the result will be either False or True. Therefore (compressing the code a bit):\n[n>=f for f in [50,60,70,80,90]].count(True)]\n\nwill produce a figure from 0 to 5\n\n*Subsequently, we can use this figure as an index for a string, to produce a character as output, e.g.\n\"ABCDEF\"[3] \n\nwill output \"D\" (since the first character = \"A\")\n\n*The additional 101 to the list is to generate an (Index-) error in case the number exceeds 100, since \"ABCDEF\"[6] does not exist. The same goes for n = n if n>=0 else \"\", which will create a (Value-) error if a number below 0 is entered\nIn those cases, as well as if the input is not a figure, the result will be:\ninvalid input\n\nThe tests:\nnumber: 10\nF\n\nnumber: 50\nE\n\nnumber: 60\nD\n\nnumber: 70\nC\n\nnumber: 80\nB\n\nnumber: 90\nA\n\nnumber: 110\ninvalid input\n\nnumber: -10\ninvalid input\n\nnumber: Monkey\ninvalid input\n\n", "Q: dmesg full of problems after startup This morning, my Ubuntu 14.04 installation booted to terminal rather than Gnome shell. startx got me in, but without sound (hardware not shown), and on a reboot instead tried sudo start gdm which got me what looked like another reboot, but this time back into gnome shell, with everything apparently working again.\nCertainly not good times, so I thought I'd take a look at the dmesg to see if there's anything obviously wrong.

The kernel is capable of automatically determining the sample rate without affecting the performance of the system. Here is a thread on this from the Arch forum.\n\nA: This answer from the Arch Forum sums it up:\n\nThis message is informational and nothing to worry about.\nIt has to do with the Linux perf tool which is included in the kernel. The kernel automagically determines the sample rate that could be used without impacting system performance too much; and it logs this even when perf isn't active, or even installed.\nMessages like this are triggered by high(er) system load or a cpu that is scaling.\n\n", "Q: Can I install the vanilla MATE desktop environment alongside the Ubuntu MATE Remix desktop environment (15.04 Vivid Vervet)?

It will be better to create an additional partition (that has the size of your RAM) by shrinking one of these partition so as to use that as the swap partition. You can use the remaining two partitions for / and /home. If you wish you can create another partition (which is 500MB-1GB) for /boot.

If so, then it's an issue with Ubuntu.  To solve that, connect your wired and wireless mouse BOTH to the machine, and see if either of them works.  If the wired mouse works, then it sounds like you have need to find a driver for the wireless.

I first did something in the 'GRUB options' in 'Advanced options' of Boot-repair disk, where I disabled the boot of sta2. \nAt the boot menu I just 'disabled' legacy (EFI was already enabled). Then I started Boot-repair disk and a totally new screen appeared with only 1 option, the boot-repair disk. Then I had no more problems and the Boot-repair did what it should, and now Ubuntu has launched.\nSo I'm not sure if only disabling legacy boot was enough or if what boot repair did was needed as well.\n\nA: Does your computer even get to the bootloader (I assume you're using a bootloader and not just swapping drives)?  If so, then you may have a messed up kernel.  \nIf not, it sounds like you may have a bad BIOS.  If you never get to the bootloader, try powering down your machine, unplugging it, removing the BIOS battery, and wait 10 minutes.  Then replace the battery, plug in the machine, and try to boot.  \nIf that doesn't fix it, you might try taking the hard drive out, and doing a 100% new install on a second hard drive.

You can choose i.e. to hibernate, when close the lid, etc.\nBy default it is same.\nYou can try pm-hibernate, ot pm-suspend-hybrid too. They are different.\nAnd also suspend menu item can be linked to \"hybrid\". But this does not work well on all systems.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 uses upstart so yes suspend in all the cases you mentioned will trigger pm-suspend.

Is there a way to make it so that administrators (there are multiple on this system) cannot interfere with the accounts of other administrators (i.e. they could only manage users \"below\" them)?\n\nA: The important property of administrators on Ubuntu is that they can perform whatever actions they choose, as root, using sudo and polkit. This is necessary, in order for them to have the power to fully administer the system. And this is already how an administrator changes the password of another user.\nConsiderable restrictions would have to be put in place in order to stop this effectively, which would result in the administrator not effectively being an administrator anymore. Even if you painstakingly configured the system with numerous exceptions (perhaps via AppArmor or SELinux) to keep them from doing this, they could pretty easily regain this power if they can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run some command as root that itself lets them inject and run an arbitrary command.\n\n*Edit arbitrary files on the system.\n\n*Edit or create a configuration file that controls who can run commands as root and what commands they can run (such as /etc/sudoers, or files in /etc/sudoers.d), even if they are not permitted to edit all root-owned files.\n\n*Edit a configuration file involved in automatically running commands as root, such as /etc/crontab. Or, similarly, schedule at jobs for root.\n\n*Install arbitrary software. They could make a package that does any of the above things automatically as root during the configuration step of its installation. Or they could make a package that lets them do it when they run the software it installs (for example, it could install setuid executables owned by root written to break the restrictions imposed).\n\n*And those are just examples. This is nowhere near an exhaustive list.\nI suspect that what you really want may be one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*To create a limited user with some additional powers, but not the full power of an administrator, and not the power to run arbitrary commands as root or edit most systemwide configuration files.\nThis would start with the simple step laid out in ByteBOT's answer--the user needs not to be an administrator, for the limitations to effectively be imposed.\nWhether or not this is practical depends on the specific powers and limitations you want to them to have. (It is not practical if you want them to be able to do everything except reset administrators' passwords, see above.) If the powers you want to give them are well defined and not too expansive, it may well be feasible.\n\n*To stop fellow administrators, or perhaps personnel who are officially supposed to do as you say, from behaving in a way you consider wrong or harmful. If this is the situation, that's not really a technical problem. Attempts to solve this sort of problem through technical means usually have many more disadvantages than advantages.\nOne of the reasons for this is that it creates a technical contest to resolve (read: perpetually fail to meaningfully resolve) a disagreement that should instead be solved by some combination of discussion, negotiation, explanation of the situation, or redefinition/dissolution of the relationship between personnel. Probably (hopefully) you do not really want to officialize petty squabbling and territorial infighting between members of your team.\n\n*To create an automated mechanism that reminds administrators of this system that they are not generally supposed to change the passwords of other administrators.\nIf that's what you want, and you understand it will not really keep an administrator who wishes to reset any password from doing so, then I believe it is doable.\nIf you are trying to solve problem 1 or problem 3, you might consider posting a new question about it, with details.\n\nA: For the reason muru stated in his comment above, it is impossible to restrict some actions for administrator accounts. Even if you can achieve that the admin may not do this from within his/her own account, he/she still has the right to become root (sudo) and have no restrictions at all. \nSorry, but the only thing to restrict an admin's rights is to convert his admin to a normal account...\n", "Q: Anyway to get full bash working on Windows? So I love the Linux CLI environment and I like to use bash for almost every task I can. \nFor some reasons too long to explain, I'm leaving my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to move to Windows 7. I have heard there are a couple of bash emulators there, like Cygwin and MSys.\nMy question is, can you in anyway get all the bash programs to work? For example, could I install packages using apt-get or yum or any other package provider and have them work on my Cygwin? I understand this is impossible as all the programs included with Cygwin are compiled as win32 executables, and therefore, any program provided by a package shouldn't work because they are Linux executables. Am I right?\nIn case this was impossible, is there any DYI way to get it solved? Could I run a Debian system on a Virtual Machine and have the bash affect the Windows filesystem? Could there be a way to run a Linux kernel directly on Windows and then load a bash from there and have it work? I'm clueless, but I'm quite excited to get to work on this project. I think the best idea would be a virtual machine, but these are normally too slow and don't affect the host filesystem, or it's hard to get it done I have heard. \nAny help is sincerely appreciated.

Software is not installed into /boot directory. But it could run out of place because of kernel image and headers update. You can remove old kernels by using synaptic.\nGenerally speaking it is not a good idea to make a separate /boot partition. This has no benefits for desktop computers, but may cause problems like you have.\nThere is no good way to keep kernel images anywhere ele, but /boot. I suggest to merge /boot with /, but it is not quite easy for a novice. Maybe it makes sense to reinstall the system, keeping your /home partition. I guess you have it separate. You can remove /boot partiton and increase / in gparted.

Why are these error happening?\n\nA: Powering off a running Ubuntu (or Windows or any PC) with the power switch or reset button can often lead to corrupted filesystems, OS's, and data loss, it's a terrible habit.\nOn Linux you can often use the \"Magic SysRq\" codes, like REISUB, to have the kernel more safely reboot a misbehaving system. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key\n\n*http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/12/safe-reboot-of-linux-using-magic-sysrq-key/\nYou use them by pressing ALT+SysRq+letter\nOr maybe CTRL+ALT+SysRq+letter\nOr possibly including the Fn key on laptops, it can get complicated so practice to see what works for yours before needing it\nThat's if they've been enabled, sometimes they're not by default. This enables them:\necho \"1\" > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq\n\n\nI don't know about the earlier network path can't find error, maybe googling it could have found a solution, or maybe the upgrade just didn't work, doing a fresh install of the version you want should be more reliable than trying an upgrade from an old version.\n", "Q: Wireless-LAN TL-WN821N is not starting automatically on startup I installed a USB-WLAN-Stick by using Windows Wireless Drivers-Application and windows drivers.

Is there a possibility to make WLAN start automatically on ubuntu startup?\nThank you for your ideas!\n\nA: Your pastebin implies, because of the timestamp, that the driver doesn't load on boot. It may be blacklisted as a part of the process to install ndiswrapper. Check:\ngksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf \n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit.

Any improvement?\nYou may be able to improve stability by checking the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router.\nIf these changes are ineffective, you might try a driver parameter:\nsudo -i\necho \"options ath9k_htc nohwcrypt=1\"  >  /etc/modprobe.d/ath9k_htc.conf\nmodprobe -r ath9k_htc\nmodprobe ath9k_htc\nexit\n\n", "Q: Can not set proper resolution on this one monitor I have a laptop with Intel HD graphics and running on Linux trusty 3.13.0-45-generic.\nI never had problems connecting external displays to my Display Port, but now I got a new monitor and can not get my laptop to output the proper resolution.\nThe display is the Asus ROG Swift PG278Q.\nWhen I run xrandr, all I get for the Display Port is\nDP1 connected 1024x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 0mm x 0mm\n   1024x768       60.0* \n   800x600        60.3     56.2  \n   848x480        60.0  \n   640x480        59.9 \n\nThen I tried to add the proper mode manually, so I ran:\n$ cvt 2560 1440 60\n# 2560x1440 59.96 Hz (CVT 3.69M9) hsync: 89.52 kHz; pclk: 312.25 MHz\nModeline \"2560x1440_60.00\"  312.25  2560 2752 3024 3488  1440 1443 1448 1493 -hsync +vsync\n\nThen added the mode:\nxrandr --newmode \"2560x1440_60.00\"  312.25  2560 2752 3024 3488  1440 1443 1448 1493 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode DP1 \"2560x1440_60.00\"\n\nUpon activating the mode with\nxrandr --output DP1 --mode 2560x1440_60.00\n\nAll I see on the display is the message\nOUT OF RANGE\n\nI also tried other resolutions and refresh rates with no success.

I have a recent backup of all of / except for /proc /sys /mnt /media /run /tmp /dev.\nStarting from a clean 14.04.1 installation, I have tried copying the entire contents of the tar archive over the new installation.  It core dumped, when copying the /lib files.\nI copied the directories from the tar archive individually and managed to get almost all files to copy apart from some /sbin executables, which were in use.  But when I rebooted, it did not boot up and never reached a command prompt.\nIs there a better way to use the tar archive to recover the system?  Do I have to ensure that the new USB boot drive is physically the same size?  Should I pick some key config files/directories to restore rather than the whole archive?  If so, which ones?\n\nA: You can restore your whole tar archive but do it from a Live CD/USB instead. tar will not core dump this time.\nIn either case, once done you need to run update-grub to update grub config file.\nIf you do it from a Live CD/USB you need to chroot into the mounted  partition before running update-grub like this:\nsudo -i\nmount /dev/sda4 /mnt\n# you need to mount your boot partition if you have one\nmount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys\nmount -o proc /mnt/rpoc\nmount -o dev /mnt/dev\nchroot /mnt\nupdate-grub\nexit\numount /mnt/sys\numount /mnt/proc\numount /mnt/dev\n\n\nA: In the end it was easier to rebuild the server from scratch, so that is what I did.

First the screen saver is shown, a little later you can suspend/hibernate or minimize electricity use (i.e. make a PCI board go to a sleep mode like because it is not used for long periods of time.)\n\nOn a server, this can be a problem. Some servers allow for a Wake On LAN (WOL) setting in their BIOS / OS, but that takes a little while and many times the client will not wait long enough for the server to wake up.\nAlso, certain things such as network traffic can be considered to be a user activity. But I do not think that X11 offers that option. My server such goes to its screen saver even if the network runs full time all day.\n\nA: Not a direct answer to your question, but to prevent going into suspend (e.g. while running your backup script) there are inhibitors which can be set by gnome-session-inhibit or by directly calling the dbus method org.gnome.SessionManager /org/gnome/SessionManager org.gnome.SessionManager.Inhibit\n$ gnome-session-inhibit --help\ngnome-session-inhibit [OPTION...] COMMAND\n\nExecute COMMAND while inhibiting some session functionality.\n\n  -h, --help        Show this help\n  --version         Show program version\n  --app-id ID       The application id to use\n                    when inhibiting (optional)\n  --reason REASON   The reason for inhibiting (optional)\n  --inhibit ARG     Things to inhibit, colon-separated list of:\n                    logout, switch-user, suspend, idle, automount\n  --inhibit-only    Do not launch COMMAND and wait forever instead\n\nIf no --inhibit option is specified, idle is assumed.\n\n", "Q: How can I execute the last line of output in bash? I know I can run the last command in bash, with !!, but how can I run the last line of output?\nI am thinking of the use case of this output:\nThe program 'git' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install git\n\nBut I don't know how I can run that. I'm thinking of something like the !!, maybe @@ or similar?\n\nSuper User has this question too.\n\nA: TL;DR: alias @@='$($(fc -ln -1) |& tail -1)'\nBash's history interaction facilities don't offer any mechanism to examine the output of commands. The shell doesn't store that, and history expansion is specifically for commands you have yourself run, or parts of those commands.\nThis leaves the approach of rerunning the last command and piping both stdout and stderr (|&) into a command substitution. heemayl's answer achieves this, but cannot be used in an an alias because the shell performs history expansion before expanding aliases, and not after.\nI can't get history expansion to work in a shell function either, even by enabling it in the function with set -H. I suspect !! in a function will never be expanded, and I'm not sure what it would be expanded to if it were, but right now I'm not sure precisely why it isn't.\nTherefore, if you want to set things up so you can do this with very little typing, you should use the fc shell builtin instead of history expansion to extract the last command from the history. This has the additional advantage that it works even when history expansion is disabled.\nAs shown in Gordon Davisson's answer to Creating an alias containing bash history expansion (on Super User), $(fc -ln -1) simulates !!. Plugging this in for !! in heemayl's command $(!! |& tail -1) yields:\n$($(fc -ln -1) |& tail -1)\n\nThis works like $(!! |& tail -1) but can go in an alias definition:\nalias @@='$($(fc -ln -1) |& tail -1)'\n\nAfter you run that definition, or put it in .bash_aliases or .bashrc and start a new shell, you can simply type @@ (or whatever you named the alias) to attempt to execute the last line of output from the last command.\nek@Io:~$ alias @@='$($(fc -ln -1) |& tail -1)'\nek@Io:~$ evolution\nThe program 'evolution' is currently not installed.

Normally pipe | will take the STDOUT of the left sided command and pass it as STDIN to the command on the right side of |, in your case the previous command prints its output on STDERR as an error message. So, doing | would not help, we need to pass both the STDOUT and STDERR (or only STDERR) to the right sided command. |& will pass the STDOUT and STDERR both as the STDIN to the right sided command. Alternately, better you can only pass the STDERR:\n$(!! 2>&1 >/dev/null | tail -1)\n\n\n*tail -1 as usual will print the last line from its input. Here rather than printing the last line you can be more precise like printing the line that contains the apt-get install command:\n$(!! 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep 'apt-get install')\n\n\nA: As Eliah Kagan mentioned, the shell does not store the command output.

I can finish the installation and the when I reboot, the Ubuntu partition doesn't show up. \nHow can I do this without rEFIt?\n\nA: If I remember correctly, rEFInd is the successor of refit, since this stopped their development  long time ago.\nNow as the rEFInd web page indicates, the new 0.8.4 version works as it should work but, if the automatic installer fails you can always follow the manual installation, indicated in the same web page.\nNow I'm not aware if refind can search in the SD cards, I believe that is a hardware thing, but don't listen to me in this, I'm not fully aware of this.\nCheck the web page, is really complete and really clever on the instructions.\nAs an extra comment, Yosemite is a really unstable system, if you want to use both (ubuntu and OS X) I personally recommend to downgrade to Maveriks, since this is more friendly with the boot. \nGood luck with this. :D\n", "Q: Restore Windows 8.1 bootloader after installing Ubuntu on a separate HDD I have Windows 8 installed on a separate HDD and Ubuntu on a separate HDD as well. \nSo I re-installed Ubuntu 14.14 because my previous installation was corrupted.

I have two kernels installed on my system. 3.16... and 3.19.3...I'm running Ubuntu 14.10 and it came with the 3.16...kernel. I decided to try the latest possible kernel (3.19.3...), but I sometimes get errors and the system feels unstable. I see no reason to keep this new kernel. Is there any issue I might run into if I choose to boot into the older kernel, and then remove the newer one using say, Synaptic? Will I run into issues once I reboot, or will Ubuntu just boot automatically into the older kernel with no fuss?\nAny advice on the proper procedure and what methods to best achieve my goal would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: You can remove kernels the same way you remove other packages, as long as you are not booted in that kernel.\nTo get a list of the kernels you have installed, use dpkg -l with a grep as in:\ndpkg -l | grep linux\n\nThere you will see the list of packages that got installed.\nThen use the remove command of apt-get\nsudo apt-get remove linux-...<name as shown by dpkg -l>\n\nThe headers do not need to be removed, the linux-image-... are the actual binaries that need removal.\nNote that apt-get should automatically re-run the necessary commands to update grub and the startup RAM disk.\nOf course, if you use apt-get update + apt-get upgrade (or the auto-upgrade which does the same), the newer kernel will get re-installed...\nI think you can prevent re-installation, but I do not know the command for that.\n\nA: This is very simple. First you need to know a few things about the kernel you want to remove. You gotta have its full name (For example, 3.19.0-15-generic). You can find this by booting with 3.19 kernel, opening Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and running the command\nuname -r\n\nTake note of the output. Reboot with 3.16 kernel and open Terminal again, running the commands\nsudo apt-get remove linux-headers-$(uname -r)\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-$(uname -r)\nsudo update-initramfs -d -k $(uname -r)\nsudo update-initramfs -u\nsudo update-grub\n\nAnd it is done! The next time you see GRUB, 3.19 kernel will not be there anymore.\n\nA: Login using older kernel.\nMy targeted version was: 5.13.0-28\nRun this command\nsudo apt-get remove --purge linux-image-5.13.0-28-generic linux-image-5.13.0-28-lowlatency linux-headers-5.13.0-28-generic linux-headers-5.13.0-28-lowlatency linux-modules-5.13.0-28-generic linux-modules-5.13.0-28-lowlatency linux-hwe-5.13-headers-5.13.0-28\n\n", "Q: E: Unable to lock the administration directory After trying somefixes I still get the error:\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?\n\n\nA: Enter terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run\nsudo killall dpkg\n\nThere are a few programs that may be using it, try to discover them and post an edit.

So, I have 8 virtual Desktops in Unity (with Compiz) because I have many projects I'm working on simultaneously.\nProblem is, every time I need to reboot or accidentally close Chrome (which constitutes a large part of the windows I need for work) I have to manually go an open those windows again and then set them up (open files, go to the correct urls etc.).\nHow would you go about writing a script that will do all that for me? That is: 1) Open windows 2) Put them into the correct coordinates at correct virtual screens\n(1) is obvious, for Google Chrome you just run 'google-chrome'. But then how do you put it in the right place? (2)\nOr is there a script/software that already exists that would do it for me?\n\nA: It can be done very well, but you need some understanding on Unity/viewports. I hope the story below is understandable, if not, please leave a comment.\nThe script below can be used to open a window of any application on any of your viewports, on any position, if you run it with the right arguments. The script is an edited version of this one, but now prepared to place windows on the spanning virtual desktop.\n1. Understanding viewports and window coordinates\nWorkspaces in Unity\nIn Unity, unlike other window managers, you actually only have one spanning workspace, which is divided into viewports. In your case, your workspace is divided into eight viewports.\nHow the position of the windows is defined\nThe window position, as the output of the command:\nwmctrl -lG\n(you need to have wmctrl installed to run the command)\n\nis described as the position, relative to the upper left corner of the current viewport:\n\nSo if you are on viewport 1:\na window on viewport 2 to could be positioned on e.g. 1700 (x-wise) x 500 (y-wise)\n(my screen is 1680x1050)\n\n\nHowever, if you are on viewport 6:\nthe same window would be positioned on 20 (x), -550 (y)\n\n\nUsing these coordinates correctly is important to run the script with the right arguments, as described below:\n2. How to use the script\nThe script below can be used to place a new window of an application on your virtual (spanning) workspace.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure wmctrl is installed:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as setwindow (no extension) in ~/bin. Create the directory if it doesn't exist yet. Make the script executable.\n\n*If you just created ~/bin, either run the command source ~/.profile or log out/in to make the directory available in $PATH.\n\n*Test run the command:\nsetwindow <application> <x_position> <y_position> <horizontal_size> <vertical_size>\n\ne.g.\nsetwindow gedit 100 100 200 200\n\nA gedit window should show up on the current viewport.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep in mind that not all applications allow window sizes below a certain width or height. The minimum width of a gedit window on my system is e.g. appr. 470 px.\n\n*The script only works fine if the whole window fits on the targeted viewport, choose your coordinates/sizes accordingly. Also mind that the Unity Launcher and the panel use some space (!) which can influence the position of the window.\n\n*Use negative <x_position> to place windows on the left of the current viewport(s)\n\n*Use negative <y_position> to place windows above the current viewport(s)\n\n*To open new windows on different viewports at once, you can simply chain commands. Looking at the viewport setup in the \"Long story\" example, If I am on viewport 1, I can open gedit windows on viewport 1, 2, 3 and 4 with the command:\nsetwindow gedit 100 100 200 200&&setwindow gedit 1780 100 200 200&&setwindow gedit 3460 100 200 200&&setwindow gedit 5140 100 200 200\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport sys\n\napp = sys.argv[1]\n\nget = lambda x: subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", x]).decode(\"utf-8\")\nws1 = get(\"wmctrl -lp\");

The above example will open agoogle-chrome window on viewport 3, opening the url http://askubuntu.com.\nYou can chain commands to open multiple windows/urls on different workspaces in one command, e.g.:\nsetwindow google-chrome 0 0 600 600 8 \"--new-window http://askubuntu.com\"&&setwindow google-chrome 0 0 600 600 7 \"--new-window www.google.com\"\n\n\nA: This expands on @Jacob Vlijim's great answer above with a slightly modified setwindow script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport time\nimport argparse\nimport subprocess\n\nDEFAULT_WIDTH = '1920'\nDEFAULT_HEIGHT = '1080'\n\n\ndef get_window_list():\n    window_list = subprocess.check_output(['/bin/bash', '-c', 'wmctrl -l'])\n    parsed_list = []\n    for line in window_list.splitlines():\n        window_info = line.split()\n        if window_info[1] != '-1':\n            parsed_list.append(window_info[0])\n    return parsed_list\n\n\ndef main(params):\n    old_list = get_window_list()\n    subprocess.Popen(['/bin/bash', '-c', params.command])\n\n    def get_diff(old):\n        new_list = get_window_list()\n        return list(set(new_list) - set(old))\n\n    diff = get_diff(old_list)\n    x = 0\n    while not diff:\n        if x == 10:\n            print 'window not found'\n            return\n        x += 1\n        diff = get_diff(old_list)\n        time.sleep(1)\n    if len(diff) > 1:\n        raise Exception(diff)\n    window_id = diff[0]\n    command_list = []\n    command_list.append('wmctrl -ir %s -t %s' % (window_id, params.desktop))\n    command_list.append('wmctrl -ir %s -b remove,maximized_horz,maximized_vert'\n        % window_id)\n    command_list.append('wmctrl -ir %s -e 0,%s,%s,%s,%s' %\n        (window_id, params.x_pos, params.y_pos, params.width, params.height))\n    for command in command_list:\n        subprocess.call(['/bin/bash', '-c', command])\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n    parser.add_argument('command', type=str)\n    parser.add_argument('-d', '--desktop', default='0', type=str)\n    parser.add_argument('-x', '--x-pos', default='0', type=str)\n    parser.add_argument('-y', '--y-pos', default='0', type=str)\n    parser.add_argument('-w', '--width', default=DEFAULT_WIDTH, type=str)\n    parser.add_argument('-t', '--height', default=DEFAULT_HEIGHT, type=str)\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n    main(args)\n\nA description of the changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*python3 to python (just a personal preference)\n\n*sys.argv to argparse for a better command line interface\n\n*strict window id (and not process id) window parsing\n\n\n*\n\n*some programs use a single process id for multiple windows\n\n\n*while loop 0.5 second to 1 full second sleep time\n\n*more verbose/readable variable names and pep8 adherence\n\n*global constant variables for screen size instead of xrandr reliance\n\n\nNOTE: This is a just a slightly improved version I wrote for personal use on Debian Jessie LXDE.

Since gcc will automatically set its output file to be executable, if you don't have any other executables in that directory, this might be enough:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f -executable \n\n\n*Search through your history for gcc commands, extract the output name and list all matching files:\nls $(history | grep -Po \"gcc -o\\s*\\K.*?\\s\")\n\nNote that this assumes your output file names contain no spaces or newlines and that you've never used variables as file names (for example for file in *c; do gcc -o $file.exe $file or similar commands.)\n\nA: with ls command we have option like hide\n--hide=PATTERN\n          do not list implied entries matching shell  PATTERN  (overridden\n          by -a or -A)\n\nSo it will hide all matched and show what not matched. \nFor example as in your case\nls --hide='*.c'\n\nAs you said your directory contains C Programs and its output files , the above command will exclude all .c files and show what else.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: I cannot re-install Ubuntu 15.04 alongside windows 8.1 This question may seem repeated but I have other more issues.\nI installed 8.1 in my dell 5537 and dual booted it with ubuntu 14.04..I worked well..I installed with alongside windows option..It took 30gb(as I selected the space) space from my logical drive which was last drive...I have four partitions c:,D:,E:,F:(or local drives).

It uses either an old-style BIOS firmware or BIOS emulation (\"CSM\" or \"legacy\") on a more modern firmware. It's usually paired with an MBR partition table. Note that on a modern computer, BIOS/CSM/legacy mode is the non-native boot mode; using it is like using WINE to run Windows programs in Linux.\n\n*EFI/UEFI mode -- Modern firmware uses the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) or its 2.x variant, UEFI. UEFI-mode booting is completely different from BIOS-mode booting and almost always uses a GUID Partition Table (GPT). Unfortunately, there's a lot of misinformation and bad advice about EFI-mode booting, which is making the transition from BIOS to EFI harder than it should be.\n\n\nI strongly recommend you read up on these subjects. The Wikipedia articles referenced above are a start, although they're a bit dry and divorced from practical concerns. Three others you might read are:\n\n\n*\n\n*My EFI Boot Loaders for Linux page, which covers (of course) EFI boot loader software.\n\n*My Linux on UEFI page, which gives more practical advice on installing Linux on EFI/UEFI systems.\n\n*Adam Williamson's UEFI boot: how does that actually work, then? blog post, which describes EFI/UEFI theory and how that impacts Linux.\n\n\nIt sounds like you've converted from an EFI/GPT setup to a BIOS/MBR setup, but you did so with a tool that does an incomplete GPT-to-MBR conversion. Thus, you're not really using your EFI/UEFI firmware as such, so the preceding references may seem of only peripheral interest -- but your firmware is an EFI, not a BIOS, and this fact means that you're dealing with EFI issues even when you boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. If I'm right, the fix to your specific problem is to use FixParts (part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu) to remove the stray GPT data. See here for more information:\nUnable to recognize and create partitions for Ubuntu Installation on Dell Inspiron 15R 5520\n\nA: I have Ubuntu 15.04 running alongside Windows 8.1 on a newish Asus laptop that has UEFI.\nWindows was there first and basically I had to do two things before I could add Ubuntu.  First turn off UEFI in the BIOS.  BIOSes vary and you may have to hunt around for the settings - meaning 1) google for the information but 2) drop into the BIOS and look around carefully.  \nSecond, I don't like the Windows Disk Mgmt application for partitioning.  For one, it'll show you less space than you have because it operates within the context of a running system (not a separate boot) and so it can't move, say, the pagefile limiting the amount of space you get.\nSo the best, imo, partition manager I've used is gparted:\nhttp://gparted.org/\nYou'll have to download and burn it to a writeable disk and then boot into that - and to do this successfully, you'll probably have to have turned off UEFI first hence that was #1 above.\nUsing gparted is very nice.  It has a GUI interface and you can repartition simply by dragging sliders.  Actually performing the repartition is a separate operation so you have time to look it over and feel comfortable with the process.  Beyond that, I'd refer you to reading gparted documentation and simply playing with it since, short of the actual repartition operation, you haven't made any lasting changes.\nGparted has been around a long time, is current, and has a large community.\nThis leaves grub as the master boot manager which if you're unfamiliar with Linux you may be uncomfortable with but I find that it works fine.\n", "Q: What is the extension of output files of gcc operation? If I do gcc filename.c, I get a.out\nAfter performing gcc -o output_name filename.c we get the executable file output_name.\nWhat is the extension of this file?\n\nA: Unlike windows, Linux does not depend upon extension of a file to determine what type of file it is. Instead, it will check first few bytes of the file and determine what type of  file it is.\nHence the output file given by gcc requires no extension. You may add whatever extension you want(by changing -o output_name to say -o output_name.abcd), but it is not going to mke any difference.\nYou can have a look at the output of the command\nfile ./filename\n\nfor example\n:~$ file output_file \noutput_file: ELF 32-bit LSB  executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=9bc9fabf05a3d2e58c7780c48cd873cb2955b2ec, not stripped\n:~$ \n\n\nA: It does not have one. You can do gcc -o myprog.exe filename.c and it  will be called myprog.exe. Unlike Windows there is no default extension for executable files on Linux. If you want to mark a file as executable do chmod +x file.\nls -l shows you if the x (executable) flag is set for your file:\nuser@host# ls -l filename\n-rwxr-x--x 1 ubu users 42 Mai 10 08:16 filename\n\n- means its a file (d would be directory,see below)\nr means readable\nw means writeable\nx means executable\n\nThe first triple is for the owner (ubu in this case),\nthe second triple is for the owning group (users) and the\nlast triple is for everyone else.\nFor directories the x means \"can enter directory\", so if x is not set you cannot do cd directory.\nOn Linux File Extensions are not special, the are just part of the files name.\n", "Q: Recover a NAS hard drive My NAS hard drive died today and I want to recover its data by connect it to a PC, how can I do it with Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: It depends on what you mean by \"died\". Connect the drive, run dmesg -T to see what the system thinks, where/if the drive is mounted.  sudo fdisk -l will give you more information. gparted is a powerful disk destruction/recovery tool.\n", "Q: manually change the startup scripts in /etc/rc2.d I use ubuntu 14.10 and I want to stop the SSH service from auto startup. Will it be enough to change the start up script to be /etc/rc2.d/K03ssh or I should do \nsudo update-rc.d -f ssh remove also \n\nA: Yes and no. As explained in /etc/rc2.d/README, to disable a service in that runlevel you can rename as you suggest but should also run update-rc.d script defaults to reorder the scripts:\n\nTo disable a service in this runlevel, rename its script in this\n  directory so that the new name begins with a 'K' and a two-digit\n  number, and run 'update-rc.d script defaults' to reorder the scripts\n  according to dependencies.  A warning about the current runlevels\n  being enabled not matching the LSB header in the init.d script will be\n  printed.  To re-enable the service, rename the script back to its\n  original name beginning with 'S' and run update-rc.d again.\n\nHowever, it is much simpler and safer to use the tools provided. Instead of removing the ssh service, use update-rc.d to disable it on runlevel 2:\nsudo  update-rc.d -f ssh disable 2\n\n", "Q: Not able to upgrade to 14.04 version from Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS I am completely new to this ubuntu world ,\nI went to upgrade manager and see that I have 12.10 version and not 14.04 version don’t why \nbut when i click upgrade for 12.10 also I am not able to do it.\nI have selected For any new Version under updates.\n\nA: You should be upgrading to Ubuntu 15.04, open a terminal and write the following and then enter your password(repeat untill you have the latest version installed)\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\n", "Q: How do I install Sage on Ubuntu 15.04?

Install it from within windows using wubi installer on a NTFS partition. First change UEFI to legacy in BIOS.\n\nA: If you did everything fine, yes, Windows is still there but GRUB (Ubuntu boot manager) does not recognize it. Open Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis will make GRUB search for OSs in all of your partitions. After update-grub command is done, reboot and you should see Windows as an option at GRUB menu.\n\nA: Have you tried to use gparted from an ubuntu stick or dvd? You should be able to see the partitions, note them, mount them, and check for data. If it doesn't recognize windows during the ubuntu install prompts, Ubuntu hasn't overwritten it, yet. It might be a grub issue. gparted will search and report what OS is where. if the Windows disk manager is used, MS won't recognize some partition types. Gparted does. Think Knoppix on a stick.

It pairs completely effortlessly not even a PIN required - but then I can't do anything else with it.\n\nThe \"Connection\" switch won't activate, and the mouse itself doesn't seem to acknowledge that my computer exists.\nI've  not had trouble with other bluetooth mice before; my guess is that it has to do with this mouse supporting Bluetooth 4.0 Smart; but so does my hardware, so I would think it should be fine. The mouse itself works fine if I switch to the Unifying receiver, but I'd really prefer to use bluetooth.\n\nA: So since people still seem to come around here looking for an answer (I don't blame you, it's a good mouse), I decided to do some copy-pasting from my MX Anywhere 2 answer. Anyway, enjoy:\nUPDATE FOR >15.10:\nIn my original answer I said that the problem would most likely be fixed when 15.10 comes around. While 15.10 does indeed have bluez 5, there is still some problem with pairing. Honestly, it was quite a while since I fixed this problem myself, but if I remember correctly, the MX Master (MX Anywhere 2) uses a PIN-less pairing method which isn't quite properly implemented yet in Ubuntu. Here are some commands which you can use as a quick fix:\nhciconfig hci0 sspmode 1\nhciconfig hci0 down\nhciconfig hci0 up\n\nIf you're using another Bluetooth device than hci0, you obviously have to change that part of the commands, otherwise, they should be good to go.\nORIGINAL ANSWER (for < 15.10):\nI had this problem a while back. Basically what's happening is that the MX Master requires Bluetooth Smart and Ubuntu ships with bluez (the Bluetooth driver) 4 which does not have support for Bluetooth Smart. Bluez 5, which adds support for Bluetooth Smart, is supposed to start shipping with 15.10, but for now, you'll have to install bluez 5 manually if you want to use it.\nJust a heads up, if you want to have a stable system, DON'T DO THIS. First of all, this will break the built in Bluetooth control in the settings panel. This method that I'm about to describe adds a PPA too, which is supposed to be bad for your system when upgrading and stuff. Only do this if you know how to remove a PPA and revert to bluez 4 or if you just don't care and want to get it working. ;P\nFirst, you need to add a PPA with bluez 5. I would recommend the bluez 5 PPA made by Austin since that's the one I have used before. Add it with this command:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:vidplace7/bluez5\n\nThen refresh apt-get:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAfter that you can install bluez 5 with this command:\nsudo apt-get install bluez\n\nNow that you have bluez 5, you need a way of controlling Bluetooth since, as stated earlier, the built in control panel will not work anymore.\nThere are two ways which I have tried for this. If you want to have a GUI then Blueman is your best option. You can install it simply with:\nsudo apt-get install blueman\n\nThis will install the Blueman Bluetooth interface which you can open for your app launcher. It should be straight forward to use and not require any in depth explanation.\nThe method I recommend however is to use the command line. I found this to be much more stable (worked on login screen while Blueman didn't) and actually surprisingly intuitive to use for being a command line.\nThe way it works is that you type bluetoothctl in to the command line where you'll now have a command interface to interact with Bluetooth devices. You can type help to get a list of commands and what they do. The command that you'll want to use first for pairing the MX Master is the scan command. If you type scan on, your computer will start searching for Bluetooth devices. While in this mode, put your MX Master in to pairing mode and wait for it to show up in the console. It will show up something like this:\n[NEW] Device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX MX Master\n\nThe \"XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\" string is the MAC address of your MX Master. To pair it and connect it, type:\npair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\nconnect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\n\nMake sure to change all the \"XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\" to the MAC address you got when scanning.\nAnd that should about do it. Hope it works for you!\n\nA: I have the same problem, I've used blueman software but it didn't work either. \nI've only noticed that pairing process ends with \"Authentication failed\"\nSadly logitech don't support linux for MX Master (unable to configure gestures etc...). I've noticed that wireless communication in MX Master is encrypted, maybe BLE cannot handle this. \nTo be 100% sure is this software problem, i've checked on same machine Windows 8.1 - it's compared with BT smooth and easy and it's working.\n", "Q: problem in intalling xdman I have tried to download the xtreme download manager via terminal by executing following from the command line:\nadd-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/apps.\napt-get update\napt-get install xdman\n\nHowever I receive the following output: \nCannot add PPA: 'ppa:noobslab/apps'.\nPlease check that the PPA name or format is correct.\n\nWhat is the cause of this and how to I solve the issues?\n\nA: You can add the ppa manually:\nJust add the following line to your /etc/apt/sources.list:\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/noobslab/apps/ubuntu trusty main \ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/noobslab/apps/ubuntu trusty main \n\nJust run apt-get update afterwards.\n", "Q: Instructions to install pepper flash on ubuntu 12.04 Can anyone show the way to do this step-wise instead of all in one paragraph?\n\nA: Try to Install it from here.

I made an alias in my .bshrc so I can type X directly, and I have created a launcher so I can access X directly from my GUI. However, with both methods I have a terminal screen running along side X, doing nothing.\nIf I type setsid path/to/folder/X;sleep 10;exit, X runs independent of the terminal and the terminal closes automatically (if I don't put the sleep 10, appearantly setsid does not have enough time to start X). However, I can't find a way to 'shortcut' this command, either in my terminal or in a launcher. Plugging the above line into a launcher doesnt work, and setsid doesnt recognize .bshrc aliasses.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I don't really understand what you're doing or why you chose such a complex way. All you need to do is add path/to/folder/ to your PATH variable (that is the list of directories that will be searched for executables). Edit ~/.profile and add this line:\nPATH=$PATH:path/to/folder/\n\nNow you will be able to run X directly, be it from the commandline or a launcher.

It is in portuguese but it is very simple. First, open Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and install Lynx (text browser):\nsudo apt-get install lynx\n\nthen run this command to download the script:\nwget https://www.dropbox.com/s/fwkeja3cijdbk7l/kernel-update\n\nChange its permission with chmod:\nchmod +x kernel-update\n\nNow you can run this script whenever you want to update your kernel with the command \nsudo ./kernel-update\n\nIt is in Brazilian Portuguese, but...\n1) Click A to verify/install a new kernel\n2) Click B to delete older kernels\n3) Click Q to exit.\nWell, do not forget to run in a terminal:\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nto update linux image and\nsudo update-grub \n\nso GRUB will recognize the new Kernel.\nHope it helps!\nEDIT: I got this tutorial from this website.\n", "Q: How can all postfix alerts to root be disabled? I've recently installed Postfix on Ubuntu 14.04 and I'm using a gmail account to send messages from it.\nFrom time to time I get delivery failure messages to root@mydomain.com. The title of those messages is:\n*** SECURITY information for myhost\n\nThe content was one time related to unresolved host; another time an incorrect password attempt for a sudo command.\nHow can all these types of messages can be turned off? Is it possible to make all messages with root@mydomain.com recipient be ignored by Postfix?\n\nA: You can edit /etc/aliases file and change the line with postmaster to something like:\npostmaster: /dev/null\n\nThis will redirect every mail to postmaster to the trash. It could be better to redirect it to a local file instead of trashing them. Look at your option in man page of aliases\nAfter you have made your change to /etc/aliases, run\nnewaliases\npostfix reload\n\n\nA: Your system writing security alerts and postfix sending them on to you indicates that something is wrong. Simply sending these alerts to /dev/null is going to hide genuine security issues. In this case you will have a security problem, probably being send when someone attempts to log in. The fix is to check through your auth.log to see what is triggering these messages (search for \"problem\" - grep problem /var/log/auth.log) and work out why before fixing it.\n", "Q: How to add sound effects in Ubuntu I just was wondering how you can add sound affects i.e. start up sound effect, minimize windows etc. to ubuntu 14.10.\nI know this is possible in KDE, but how to go about doing this in ubuntu?\n\nA: There are certain sounds built in. Open the DConf Editor (Alt+F2 and then type dconf-editor) and navigate to org.gnome.desktop.sound. Make sure to select both the checkboxes. Make sure the sound scheme name is \"ubuntu\" if you just want the default sounds.\nTo install DConf editor if you haven't installed it already, find it on Synaptic or do sudo apt update && sudo apt install dconf-editor in the terminal.\nDConf Editor on org.gnome.desktop.sound\n", "Q: Create periodically screenshots using scrot excluding time when screen is locked I do one screenshot per minute using next bash script\nwhile true;\ndo\n    scrot -d 60 -q 1 '%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S.png' -e 'mkdir -p ~/screen-snapshots/%Y-%m-%d & mv $f ~/screen-snapshots/%Y-%m-%d/';\ndone\n\nBut screenshots are made also if screen is locked. How to do screenshots only is screen is not locked?\nSystem - Ubuntu 14.10 with Unity\n[Solution]\nThanks for @solsTiCe. Whole script is\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction isScreenLocked() {\n    gdbus call -e -d com.canonical.Unity -o /com/canonical/Unity/Session -m com.canonical.Unity.Session.IsLocked | grep -q false\n}\n\nwhile true;\ndo\n    sleep 60;\n    if isScreenLocked\n    then\n        scrot -q 1 '%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S.png' -e 'mkdir -p ~/screen-snapshots/%Y-%m-%d; mv $f ~/screen-snapshots/%Y-%m-%d/';\n    fi\ndone\n\n\nA: you can use gdbus to check for unity locked property.\ngdbus call -e -d com.canonical.Unity -o /com/canonical/Unity/Session -m com.canonical.Unity.Session.IsLocked\n\nSo in bash you can make a function like this\nfunction IsScreenLocked() {\n    gdbus call -e -d com.canonical.Unity -o /com/canonical/Unity/Session -m com.canonical.Unity.Session.IsLocked|grep -q true\n}\n\n", "Q: mount partition on ubuntu startup in similar way when clicks on partiton I want to mount /dev/sda8  partition on startup.

If I am able to find it, will I mess up anything by clicking on unused kernel and hitting delete button?\n\nA: Boot directory is not hidden, you can easily find it by clicking \"Computer\" in your file manager. But do not just delete files from there. It will break all your system. To remove unused kernels you can use synaptic.\nAnd generally it is not a good idea to have a separate /boot partition for a desktop computer.\nHere is a guide\n\nA: It is not hidden. If you want to remove some older/unused kernels, do not do this with a file manager, but through command-line or synaptic (I recommend command-line). For this, you need to find the name of the kernel you want to remove. Boot Ubuntu with this kernel, open Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run the command\nuname -r\n\nTake note of the output.\nNow reboot with the kernel you want to keep. Open Terminal and remove the unused kernel with the commands\nsudo apt-get remove linux-headers-*here comes the output you noted*\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-*output again*\nsudo update-initramfs -d -k *output*\nsudo update-grub\n\nAnd you are done. If possible, NEVER do this process with a file manager (nautilus, for example).

I'd like to get as close as possible on this Linux computer I'm setting up for him as certain processes they use could depend on that wdiff behave accurately.  I don't really know what --with-gettext does or why they needed it.\n\nA: gettext is a library for internationalization and localization. The --with-gettext flag makes brew configure and build wdiff with that library, enabling i18n and l10n. However, the wdiff package for Ubuntu is not built with it. If you do need i18n, you'll have to build wdiff yourself. If you don't need it, sudo apt-get install wdiff is sufficient.\n\nA: Not sure about the --with-gettext option, but wdiff is in the repos and you can install it with \nsudo apt-get install wdiff\n\n\nA: It is:\nsudo apt-get install wdiff\n\n", "Q: Messed up with my ssh_config file.

But with graphical stack it is not that straight forwared because of dependencies, especially on 64-bit systems.

It took me months to discover this fix!\n\nA: Actually, you can't, unless your OEM gives you the colour software for Linux or calibrated .icm/.icc profiles. I've Samsung NP370R4V-XXXX, I've a motherboard software called \"display colour profiles\", and \"Settings\" software. In settings software, there are calibrated profiles I can choose. Unless the screen is blueish, bad colour like on Linux.\nSo, you need calibrated profiles or colour software by your Manufacturer. Or buy a colour calibration machine. It would be better if anyone can build a software that copies current calibrated/applied colour RGB, display colour info from windows, convert, and set into Linux. Intel HD Graphics Control Panel is a better place for RGB, related colours info. The display colour is the only thing that forces me to stay in Windows, I would love to use Linux.

I do not want to  have to use a flash drive each time I boot the computer.  How can I download and install with a memory stick. (USB flash)\nthanks \n\nA: That's pretty simple. Find another usable PC and follow the steps. First you'll have to download the Ubuntu (or one of its flavors) ISO image from ubuntu.com/download. If you are using Windows 7, download the program UNetBootIn (unetbootin.sourceforge.net). This program allows you to make a bootable flash drive with Ubuntu ISO. Follow the steps of the program. \nAfter you're done, plug your USB stick and restart your PC.

You can install Ubuntu on your PC from there.\n", "Q: rEFInd showing 3 ubuntu .efi instead of 2 This is not really a problem, though I am just curious to why do I suddenly see 3 ubuntu, instead of the usual 2. It should be grub64.efi and shim64.efi. Though now it is grub64.efi, vm-linuz-3.13.0.32-generic.efi.signed by UBUNTU\nand vm-linuz-3.13.0.52-generic.efi.signed by UBUNTU\nWhy is this? Which one should I use? I use grub64.efi, and I am asking what is the difference and should I use some of the other?\nThis change happened as soon as I installed bcmwl to get my Wi-Fi working.\n\nI am using linux 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr)\nThe native OS is Mac OS X 10.10.3\n\nA: rEFInd is designed to automatically remove certain redundant entries. One of these redundancies is shimx64.efi, if grubx64.efi is also present. Thus, your statement that \"[i]t should be grub64.efi and shim64.efi\" is not correct, unless you created a manual boot stanza for one or both of these files.\nIn your case, you've got three entries:\n\n\n*\n\n*grubx64.efi -- This is the GRUB binary that Ubuntu installed. Selecting it launches GRUB, which loads the Linux kernel and boots it using the GRUB boot loader mechanism for the Linux kernel. GRUB may present its own menu or not, depending on its configuration. This menu is likely to include options for all your Linux kernels, and perhaps for other OSes or special functions. If you don't select any option from the GRUB menu, it probably launches the latest (currently 3.13.0-52) kernel\n\n*vm-linuz-3.13.0.32-generic.efi.signed -- This option loads the 3.13.0-32 Linux kernel, which is the kernel that ships with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (the version released in April of 2014). rEFInd launches the kernel as if it were an EFI application, relying on the EFI stub loader as a boot loader and bypassing GRUB.\n\n*vm-linuz-3.13.0-52-generic.efi.signed -- This option is just like the preceding one, except that it launches the more up-to-date 3.13.0-52 kernel, which includes bug fixes and new features collected over the past year.\n\n\nAs a practical matter, you should use whatever works best for you. In most cases, the GRUB option and the rEFInd option for the latest kernel will result in systems that function identically by most measures. There may be some tiny differences, like a slightly different Command line: line in your dmesg output, but these will have no practical effects. Depending on your GRUB configuration and the contents of /boot/refind_linux.conf, there could be other differences, such as graphical vs. text-mode startup messages; or in extreme cases one might boot and the other might not. A direct kernel boot is likely to be easier to fix if something goes wrong, because GRUB can be complex and difficult to debug. Also, if you want to boot an older kernel for some reason, doing so from the rEFInd menu may be a little easier than doing it from GRUB, especially if GRUB is configured to boot without showing you its own menu. OTOH, if there's no /boot/refind_linux.conf file or if it's misconfigured, GRUB might boot properly where rEFInd's direct kernel launch might fail or set things up sub-optimally.\nAs you continue to use and upgrade the system, you may see additional direct kernel options appear in rEFInd's menu. You can manually uninstall kernels you know you're not going to use; or typing sudo apt-get autoremove in a Terminal will remove all but three of them (usually the original kernel and the two most recent ones). It's generally a good idea to keep at least two kernels around. The reason is that kernel bugs are sometimes introduced, so you want to have the option of booting back to an older kernel in case you run into such a problem.\nIf you want to remove options you're not using from rEFInd's display, you can do so in various ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use the dont_scan_volumes, dont_scan_dirs, and dont_scan_files options in refind.conf (usually in /boot/efi/EFI/refind/ from Ubuntu). These options remove particular boot loaders from the menu based on locations or filenames without actually deleting them.\n\n*You can set scan_all_linux_kernels false in refind.conf. This will cause rEFInd to ignore Linux kernels that lack .efi extensions. (Note that your kernels have .efi.signed extensions, which will be ignored with this option set to false.)\n\n*You can remove the EFI driver for the filesystem on which your kernel resides. This driver is usually in /boot/efi/EFI/refind/drivers_x64 from Linux. Removing this driver will remove all of the direct Linux boot options.\n\n*You can delete the files entirely. This is not an option if you want to remove the entries that directly boot the Linux kernel, since GRUB needs those files to boot Linux; but you might consider it if you don't want to see the GRUB option or if something else is showing up (say, an old Windows boot entry for a Windows installation you've deleted). Most boot entries will show up in subdirectories of /boot/efi/EFI/ under Ubuntu, but some may be elsewhere.\n\n\nIf you've got precisely the three entries you described, if you were to remove the direct-kernel entries, you'd probably be better off bypassing rEFInd and using GRUB directly -- after all, there's little point to having a boot manager with just one boot option. Removing the GRUB entry might make some sense, but having it available is also worthwhile in case you run into a problem with the EFI stub loader down the line.\n\nA: The answer is given in the description of the boot entries:\n3.13.0.32-generic vs. 3.13.0.52-generic, i.e. the latter one will boot a more recent kernel.\nThis is due to Ubuntu's (other Distros do this, too) practice of keeping older kernel images when a new one is installed, so you can easily revert if the update doesn't work as intended or refuses to boot after all.\nYou can, however, uninstall older generic kernel images manually using\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-(old version string)-generic\n\nATTENTION: Do never uninstall multiple kernels at once using regexes or globs, but only remove one at a time and always check the output of uname -r, giving you your current kernel version, which you shouldn't remove. Else, you'll take the risk of a single typo deleting all your kernels and render yous system unbootable...\n", "Q: Uninstalling Dependencies. Is This a Good Practice? As far as I know I can uninstall a program from Ubuntu using this command...\n$ sudo dpkg -r packagename\n\nBut this does not remove the dependencies while the packagename installed. To remove all files including dependencies we need to apply this command...\n$ sudo apt-get --purge autoremove packagename\n\nBut my question is removing the package and all its dependencies is really a good practice? Will --purge autoremove command make my system as it before installing the packagename package? Or occasionally I might end up with some broken files and my system might crash while trying to remove everything? Actually I am afraid to implement the --purge autoremove command and want to know expert opinion before practising this!\n\nA: It should be quite safe. Autoremove removes only packages, which were installed by dependency of a removed package. They should not be needed.\nYou are correct. Your system should be as before you installed 'packagename'.\n\nA: Autoremove only removes orphaned packages. Meaning that it is completely safe to use without disrupting any functional or currently installed programs.\n\nA: It is quite safe most of the times, but when you use it you must check your terminal for the names of the packages that are about to be removed because sometimes errors happen. Do not agree to the removal of dependencies without having double checked the names of the packages that are about to be removed and see if there is any that shouldn't normally be there.

In this way you can run the script from any shell by ./script.sh, the script will be interpreted as a bash script and hence will be executed accordingly.\n\nA: Thought I'd contribute to the discussion a little bit.\nIt's already been mentioned that the syntax used in your script is a bashism and hence isn't portable, even though this is C-like and is well understood by those familiar with java and C. From asking my own question on unix.stackexchange.com , I've also learned that syntax such as for i in $(seq 1 5) generates a set of numbers first and then iterates , which can be wasteful if you have a very large set.\nA better way to simulate C-like behavior, which is portable, is to use while loop, with a variable that can be incremented. For instance,\n#!/bin/sh\nnumber=0\nwhile [ \"$number\" -lt 10 ]\ndo\n        printf \"\\t%d\" \"$number\"\n        number=`expr $number + 1 `\ndone\n\nThis works with bash, dash, zsh, ksh, mksh . . . or basically any shell related to bourne shell. In fact, I've a Unix System V book from like 1995, and I've tested their example for bourne shell and it still works. The behaviour is also that of C-like for loop: you have initial condition, testing condition within while [ . . .], and update condition at the end.\ncsh and tcsh have syntax closer to C language, but its not portable to other shells, and they're not recommended to be used in scripting.\nAddition:\nConcerning portability of $RANDOM, according to this page on ubuntu wiki, with dash random number generation should rely on using /dev/urandom\n\nA: As heemayl's answer points out, your construction is a bashism. The standard way of doing what you want would be:\nfor i in 1 2 3 4 5\ndo\n  echo \"Random number $i: $RANDOM\"\ndone\n\nOr, more easily expandably:\nfor i in $(seq 1 5)\ndo\n  echo \"Random number $i: $RANDOM\"\ndone\n\n(See man seq for more detail).\n", "Q: Is my windows 8.1 still available or not ?

For\n  example, the files in user home directories are shareable whereas\n  device lock files are not.\n\nI know that a device lock file is a file created when a process is in use. And obviously that information shouldn't be placed on different host computer, but at the same time, why would you want to place the files in a user's home directory on another host computer? Is that not a security risk? I don't really see why we should categorize files as shareable and unshareable, or maybe I misunderstood the concept?\n\nA: In large-scale environments, like labs, or corporate systems, to facilitate administration and allow users to work on multiple PCs, home directories are made available over the network, typically via NFS. In such cases, user accounts are also served over the network, using LDAP or something similar. \nA lot of things can be served over NFS - for example, if every system is nearly identical, /usr can be (with a bit of work). But, as anybody who has a home directory on NFS and left Firefox open on some system can tell you, lock files really shouldn't be on NFS shared over multiple systems.\nAnd typically, in such cases, the average user does not have administrative access to any common system.\n", "Q: error: ELF header smaller than expected So I had updated ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04 and while computer was rebooting I turned it down and automaticly this showed:\nerror : ELF header smaller than expected .\nGrub rescue>\n\n\nA: Boot from a LiveCD of your distribution, select the Advanced mode, then choose Recovery mode (you have to enter the shell).

I have 4GB of RAM and about 650MB are what I regularly use with Firefox open.\nWhat you really need to understand about Xubuntu is that not only is the Desktop Environment which is XFCE light but the applications that come with XUbuntu are exclusively selected based on how much resources they consume (abiword, firefox, parole video player). Using these apps will guarantee you a freeze-free experience, outside of that I don't know how fast or fluid your experience will be with your specs.\nRegarding measuring performance in a LiveCD context, you are better off checking benchmarks of the Linux distros online as running on LiveCD will not grant you an accurate measure.\nTo conclude I would honestly recommend Lubuntu or Xubuntu as both are more lightweight than elementary OS.\nElementary OS recommended requirements (1GB of system memory):\nhttp://www.elementarynow.com/what-is-elementary-3/\nXubuntu recommended requirements (512MB of system memory):\nhttp://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/requirements/\nLubuntu recommended requirements (128MB of system memory):\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubuntu\nOf course when resource consumption goes down so does functionality and with that in mind I have to say that your best option is Xubuntu still but with applications that are less resource intensive. \n", "Q: Upgraded to 15.04 after manually install graphics driver, system now hangs on login screen Based on the symptoms, I believe this is an issue with GRUB boot flags, or perhaps something to do with the graphics driver.\nI'm running a GeForce GTX 750Ti, and installed the driver for it manually so I could see what I was doing in order to install the package managed one.\nWhen I boot normally, I get to the login screen, but it flashes like crazy, isn't the right resolution, the Ubuntu drum sound plays over and over again, and my fan spins up to a speed I've never heard it go before.\nHere's the weird part (which leads me to believe it's something with GRUB)...

I would like to exclude specific packages from installation with apt-get, that is, install a metapackage without the list of specific packages, preferably with one invocation of apt-get.\nFor example, in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS command-line, I am installing MATE desktop environment. In 14.04 LTS MATE is not an official flavour, so I'm adding a PPA:\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common # need them for 'apt-add-repository'\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-mate-dev/ppa\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-mate-dev/trusty-mate\nsudo apt-get update\n\nthen installing:\nsudo apt-get install xorg mate-core --no-install-recommends\n\nEven without the recommended extras, mate-core installs 3 terminal emulators: xterm, uxterm and mate-terminal , the latter lacking proper fonts while installed in this minimal configuration.\nSuppose I decide that 3 terminal programs would be too many and I'd like to install xorg and mate-core without xterm and mate-terminal.

Repeat the same for other packages to be excluded.\nAdmittedly this is quite an effort and a --without option would be nice. Maybe a wishlist bug can be opened to provide such functionality in the future, but I somehow doubt that this will be implemented.\nHowever, a more realistic option would be to petition the PPA owner to provide another meta package for MATE with lesser Depends packages set.\n\nA: There's a special apt syntax for scenarios like this: appending a hyphen (minus sign) to a package will remove/not install it, so the closest to your sudo apt-get install xorg mate-core --without xterm mate-terminal\nis\nsudo apt-get install xorg mate-core xterm- mate-terminal-\n(spotted on https://askubuntu.com/a/1011439/182923)\nIt will not help in this case, as you will run into\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n mate-desktop-environment-core : Depends: mate-terminal (>= 1.20) but it is not going to be installed                                                                        \nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nbut it seems to be the answer to your specific question. So for reference, this cross-post.\n\nA: If you use aptitude or a graphical package manager (Synaptic, etc.), then you can unselect which packages should be installed as long as it doesn't cause a dependency issue.\nIn the case of aptitude, before installing a package (in the graphical view), it will show you why a dependent package is being installed. In my case, I use KDE, and so don't have any MATE packages. If I tell it to install mate-core, I get the following:\n\nNotice that mate-core is marked as being manually installed, and many other packages are being installed. For the mate-terminal package, in the bottom, it says, \"mate-desktop-environment-core [universe] depends on mate-terminal (>= 1.0.0)\". Going over to the entry for mate-desktop-environment-core,\n\n\"mate-core [universe] depends on mate-desktop-environment-core (>= 1.8.0+9)\". This is why mate-terminal is being installed.\nIf, instead, a recommended package is being installed (rather than something that is dependent on another package), aptitude will tell you so, and you can tell it not to install that package without any broken dependencies. For example:\n\n\nA: Another method  \nDownload main package which depend on the other. Extract the package, remove the unwanted dependencies, repack it. Now open the new package with gdebi package installer.

Suppose I have a script that receives a path as a parameter. How could I execute all the scripts located in that path? \n\nA: Assuming by path you meant path to a directory, use run-parts. From man run-parts:\nrun-parts - run scripts or programs in a directory\n\nAt first you need to set execute permission on all the scripts you want to run. Normally run-parts will ignore the directories and also the files that are not executable resides in that directory.\nAlthough before running you should check which files will be run by the --test option:\nrun-parts --test /path/to/directory\n\nI should mention that run-parts has a strict naming convention for the scripts to be executed:\nIf neither the --lsbsysinit option nor the --regex option is given \nthen the names must consist entirely of ASCII upper- and\nlower-case letters, ASCII digits, ASCII underscores, and ASCII minus-hyphens.\n\nCheck man run-parts to get more idea.\n\nA: Run-parts will work if your scripts have the correct names. If you don't want to deal with renaming your scripts to fit run-parts's complex naming scheme, you could do something as simple as\nfor file in ~/target/*; do $file 2>/dev/null; done\n\nThat will attempt to execute all files (and directories) found in ~/target. The 2>/dev/null redirects error messages so it won't complain when attempting to run directories or non executable files. \nAlternatively, you can try the more sophisticated\nfor file in ~/target/*; do\n    [ -f \"$file\" ] && [ -x \"$file\" ] && \"$file\"\ndone\n\nThis will check whether each of the results is a file ([ -f $file ]), is executable ([ -x $file ]) and only if both those tests are successful will it attempt to execute the file. \n", "Q: Installed ubuntu 14.04 on mac now I want to go back to osx I installed ubuntu 14.04 to my MacBook Pro and now I want to return to OS X but I deleted it while I was Installing ubuntu.

I still had no boot options. I then booted up with a live USB with gparted. When I did It would not boot up right. It booted into Emergency Mode. I can't boot into anything. I tried booting into a live fedora USB and I got an error. Its been a while since this so I may have missed some details. I just tried booting into Ubuntu on a USB and it worked.

Install Ubuntu somewhere. Boot with Ubuntu, open Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run the command\nsudo update-grub\n\nNow restart your PC. You should see both Windows and Ubuntu options at GRUB boot menu.\nThat's all the help I can provide with the information you gave, hope it helps!\n\nA: First, your teacher was wrong in saying you can't have two EFI-based OSes on a single hard disk; there's no problem with such a configuration. In fact, once you understand the rules and the quirks of your particular computer, it's generally easier to install more OSes on an EFI-based computer than on a BIOS-based one. Those two caveats are important, though; most people underestimate the differences between EFI and BIOS and so make mistakes. There are also some pretty substantial EFI bugs that can cause problems on specific computers.\nIt's hard to know what sort of problem you've got because you haven't presented the sort of detailed information required for diagnosis. Three likely possibilities are a damaged NVRAM boot manager entry, a damaged EFI boot loader, and a completely-destroyed Windows installation. If you need more help, you'll need to post the RESULTS.txt file created by Boot Info Script -- and if you want to post it here, you should at least attempt an Ubuntu install first, since this is an Ubuntu site. (OTOH, for best safety, you should run Boot Info Script before doing anything else, lest you make matters worse. Thus, you may need to take your problem to another site.)\nFor more general information on installing Ubuntu or other Linux distributions on EFI-based computers, see my Web page on the subject.\nOne thing you might want to try in the interim is to prepare a USB flash drive or CD-R with my rEFInd boot manager. (That page includes download links for images for both media.) If you boot with it, rEFInd should present options to boot any OS with a valid EFI boot loader. If you see a Windows entry, try booting it. If it boots, then your problem is a simple one of a bad NVRAM entry. This can be fixed by Windows utilities, but you'd best ask about that on a Windows site.

Yet the HPLIP does not recognize the printer from the USB connection (although the lsusb command from terminal shows that a printer is indeed connected: Bus 002 Device 004: ID 03f0:cd11 Hewlett-Packard. \nI can actually print using the installation from the system setting, but I don't have the scanner and let alone the fax. Neither of 'Simple scan', 'Acquire Images' and 'Xsane' identify a scanner. The CUPS web interface shows that there is a printer named 'HP_Officejet_5740_series', with description 'HP Officejet 5740 series' and 'Driver: HP Officejet 5740 Series, hpcups 3.15.2 '; connection 'usb://HP/Officejet%205740%20series?serial=TH4A6330Q805ZF&interface=1'; location 'Gigiux'. I can even print the test page. Yet the HP Device Manager does not identify a printer neither from USB (thus the wireless connections are also non available) nor from CUPS. Hence no scanner (let alone the fax). Even providing the direction of the usb (002:004) does not help.\nSo the question is: how can I properly install the HP officejet 5740 e-all-in -one and specifically how can I set the scanner (and optionally even the fax)?\nThank you\nGigiux\n\nA: I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 and I download and install the newer Hplip driver from this page\nhttp://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/models/officejet/officejet_5740_series.html\nEverything works for me (I do not test fax) with a wireless connection.\nhplip version is 3.15.7 and\nXSanne recognize the scanner immediately\nFred\n", "Q: Is the latest version of Ubuntu 100% FREE I really need to know if the latest version of Ubuntu is free ?\n\nA: There are a few different things you might be asking. While you've asked about the latest version, the answers do not really depend on release, architecture, or flavor. If what you want to know is where to download the latest version of Ubuntu, scroll down to the bottom of this post. You don't have to pay anyone anything to obtain Ubuntu, but that is neither the only nor the primary meaning of \"free\" in the context of Ubuntu.\nDoes a default installation of Ubuntu contain any non-free software?\nIn the free and open source software community, often when we say \"free\" we are talking about freedom rather than price. I don't know which meaning of \"free\" you had in mind as you asked your question.\nThe great majority of software included in Ubuntu is free software.\nThe kernel contains some non-free (i.e., proprietary) loadable firmware blobs as part of some device drivers, and when you install you're given the option to include some commonly wanted non-free components.\nDoes Ubuntu officially facilitate installing any non-free software?\nYes. Besides the mechanisms listed above, the restricted and multiverse repository components provide non-free software, and both proprietary \"freeware\" and proprietary payware are available for purchase through the Ubuntu Software Center. (Also, Landscape is proprietary.)\nWhile proprietary software is made available for your use through those means, you need not choose to install it. Unless you happen to rely on hardware for which there are no working free drivers, it is not generally necessary to install proprietary software to use Ubuntu, except for the firmware blobs in the kernel. (You can use linux-libre to avoid them, but it's not one of Ubuntu's officially provided kernels.)\nAn operating system, or distribution, is a collection of many different software components. Many users who prefer to run only free open-source software are happy with Ubuntu. However, for more information on these issues, you may wish to read the Free Software Foundation's explanation of why they don't endorse most of the popular GNU/Linux distributions (including Ubuntu).\nIs payment is required to obtain Ubuntu?\nNo, you do not have to pay for Ubuntu. There are several ways to obtain it at no charge online, and they are the generally recommended ways to get Ubuntu.\nBoth the latest release and the latest LTS release are available from the download page. You're probably looking for the desktop version of Ubuntu, which is here.\n\n*\n\n*The latest LTS release is shown first.\n\n*When there is a more recent release that is not LTS, that appears below.\n\nThe website might be redesigned at some point in the future, but it should still offer you easy access to both.\nIf you prefer to download the network installer (a small ISO image that downloads most of the system during installation), or want to download with bittorrent, or want to select your download mirror manually, you can use the Alternative downloads page.\nYou can also manually browse the releases server, the cdimage server (hosting some less commonly downloaded files), and the old-releases server (which you'll probably never need).\nAs of the time of this writing, the latest release of Ubuntu is 15.04. Here are the release notes, which also contain information on ways to download Ubuntu 15.04, as well as other information.\nWelcome to Ubuntu!\n\nA: Yes, all versions of Ubuntu are free in that they do not cost money.  \nUbuntu repositories do provide \"non-free\" software though, so it is not necessarily 100% free in that sense. \n\nA: It's free. The Linux kernel is under GPL license, which means it can be copied and distributed free of charge and is open source. When you go to Ubuntu download page, it will ask you to donate some money, but you do not need to do so to get Ubuntu: just unmark all donation options and download it!\nDownload Ubuntu and join our community!\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu is open source, that does not only mean it's free but that you can view it's source code and modyfy it.\n", "Q: LibreOffice Base under Ubuntu 12.04 I am using LibreOffice v.3.5.7.2 under Ubuntu 12.04.  I would like to use Base, but it is greyed out.  Is there a way that I can download and install  a version of Base for my LibreOffice, or do I have to upgreade to a new version? \n\nA: If you don't have LibreOffice Base installed, you can obtain it by installing the libreoffice-base  package. This package is available for Ubuntu 12.04, as well as other releases.\nYou can install it in the Ubuntu Software Center or Synaptic Package Manager. Or you can install it from the command line (Ctrl+Alt+T) by running:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice-base\n\nIf you are able to install it, or find it is already installed, but you are still unable to run it, please update your question with details.\n", "Q: Prevent usb HDD Sleep mode?

The solution was simple: make sure the music tags are properly used in the mp3 files. Now the phone recognizes all my music nicely.\n"]
